     id="bk1">BOOK I. EROS</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="ch1-01"
     id="ch1-01">I</a>. &mdash; THE IVORY GATE</h2>

  <p class="first">DARK and stern, in their weird beauty, lower the sad brows
  of the Queen of Hell. Dear to her are the pomp and power, the shadowy
  vastness, and the terrible splendour of the nether world. Dear to her the
  pride of her unbending consort; and doubly dear the wide imperial sway, that
  rules the immortal destinies of souls. But dearer far than these&mdash;dearer
  than flashing crown and fiery sceptre, and throne of blazing gold&mdash;are
  the memories that glimmer bright as sunbeams athwart those vistas of gloomy
  grandeur, and seem to fan her weary spirit like a fresh breeze from the
  realms of upper earth. She has not forgotten, she never can forget, the dewy
  flowers, the blooming fragrance of lavish Sicily, nor the sparkling sea, and
  the summer haze, and the golden harvests that wave and whisper in the garden
  and granary of the world. Then a sad smile steals over the haughty face; the
  stern beauty softens in the gleam, and, for a while, the daughter of Ceres is
  a laughing girl once more.</p>

  <p>So the Ivory Gate swings back, and gentle doves come forth on snowy wings,
  flying upwards through the gloom, to bear balm and consolation to the weary
  and the wounded and the lost. Now this was the dream the birds of Peace
  brought with them, to soothe the broken spirit of a sleeping slave.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The old boar has turned to bay at last. Long and severe has
  been the chase; through many an echoing woodland, down many a sunny glade, by
  copse and dingle, rock and cave, through splashing stream, and deep, dank,
  quivering morass, the large rough hounds have tracked him, unerring and
  pitiless, till they have set him up here, against the trunk of the old
  oak-tree, and he has turned&mdash;a true British denizen of the
  waste&mdash;to sell his life dearly, and fight unconquered to the last. His
  small eye glows like a burning coal; the stiff bristles are up along his huge
  black body, flecked with white froth that he churns and throws about him, as
  he offers those curved and ripping tusks, now to one, now to another of his
  crowding, baying, leaping foes.</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1400421h-images/TheGladiators-01.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Have at him! Good dogs!">

    <p class="caption">"Have at him! Good dogs!"</p>
  </div>

  <p>"Have at him! Good dogs!" shouts the hunter, running in with a short,
  broad-bladed boar-spear in his hand. Breathless is he, and wearied with the
  long miles of tangled forests he has traversed; but his heart is glad within
  him, and his blood tingles with a strange wild thrill of triumph known only
  to the votaries of the chase.</p>

  <p>Gelert is down, torn and mangled from flank to dewlap; Luath has the wild
  swine by the throat; and a foot of gleaming steel, driven home by a young,
  powerful arm, has entered behind the neck and pierces downwards to the very
  brisket. The shaft of the spear snaps short across, as the thick unwieldy
  body turns slowly over, and the boar shivers out his life on the smooth
  sward, soft and green as velvet, that exists nowhere but in Britain.</p>

  <p>The dream changes. The boar has disappeared, and the woodland gives place
  to a fair and smiling plain. Vast herds of shaggy red cattle are browsing
  contentedly, with their wide-horned heads to the breeze; flocks of sheep dot
  the green undulating pastures, that stretch away towards the sea. A gull
  turns its white wing against the clear blue sky; there is a hum of insects in
  the air, mingled with the barking of dogs, the lowing of kine, the laughter
  of women, and other sounds of peace, abundance, and content. A child is
  playing round its mother's knee&mdash;a child with frank bold brow and golden
  curls, and large blue fearless eyes, sturdy of limb, quick of gesture, fond,
  imperious, and wilful. The mother, a tall woman, with a beautiful but
  mournful face, is gazing steadfastly at the sea, and seems unconscious of her
  boy's caresses, who is fondling and kissing the white hand he holds in both
  his own. Her large shapely figure is draped in snowy robes that trail upon
  the ground, and massive ornaments of gold encircle arms and ankles. At
  intervals she looks fondly down upon the child; but ever her face resumes its
  wistful expression, as she fixes her eyes again upon the sea. There is
  nothing of actual sorrow in that steadfast gaze&mdash;still less of
  impatience, or anger, or discontent. Memory is the prevailing sentiment
  portrayed&mdash;memory, tender, absorbing, irresistible, without a ray of
  hope, but without a shadow of self-reproach. There is a statue of Mnemosyne
  at one of the entrances to the Forum that carries on its marble brow the same
  crushing weight of thought; that wears on its delicate features, graven into
  the saddest of beauty by the Athenian's chisel, just such a weary and
  despondent look. Where can the British child have seen those tasteful spoils
  of Greece that deck her imperial mistress? And yet he thinks of that statue
  as he looks up in his mother's face. But the fair tall woman shivers and
  draws her robe closer about her, and taking the child in her arms, nestles
  his head against her bosom and covers him over with her draperies, for the
  wind blows moist and chill, the summer air is white with driving mist, huge
  shapeless forms loom through the haze, and the busy sounds of life and
  laughter have subsided into the stillness of a vast and dreary plain.</p>

  <p>The child and its mother have disappeared, but a tall, strong youth, just
  entering upon manhood, with the same blue eyes and fearless brow, is present
  in their stead. He is armed for the first time with the weapons of a warrior.
  He has seen blows struck in anger now, and fronted the legions as they
  advanced, and waged his fearless unskilful valour against the courage, and
  the tactics, and the discipline of Rome. So he is invested with sword, and
  helm, and target, and takes his place, not without boyish pride, amongst the
  young warriors who encircle the hallowed spot where the Druids celebrate
  their solemn and mysterious rites.</p>

  <p>The mist comes thicker still, driving over the plain in waves of vapour,
  that impart a ghostly air of motion to the stones that tower erect around the
  mystic circle. Grey, moss-grown, and unhewn, hand of man seems never to have
  desecrated those mighty blocks of granite, standing there, changeless and
  awful, like types of eternity. Dim and indistinct are they as the worship
  they guard. Hard and stern as the pitiless faith of sacrifice, vengeance, and
  oblation, inculcated at their base. A wild low chant comes wailing on the
  breeze, and through the gathering mist a long line of white-robed priests
  winds slowly into the circle. Stern and gloomy are they of aspect, lofty of
  stature, and large of limb, with long grey beards and tresses waving in the
  wind.</p>

  <p>Each wears a crown of oak-leaves round his head; each grasps a wand
  covered with ivy in his hand. The youth cannot resist an exclamation of
  surprise. There is desecration in his thought, there is profanity in his
  words. Louder and louder swells the chant. Closer and closer still contracts
  the circle. The white-robed priests are hemming him in to the very centre of
  the mystic ring, and see! the sacrificial knife is already bared and whetted,
  and flourished in the air by a long brawny arm. The young warrior strives to
  fly. Horror! his feet refuse to stir, his hands cleave powerless to his
  sides. He seems turning to stone. A vague fear paralyses him that he too will
  become one of those granite masses to stand there motionless during eternity.
  His heart stops beating within him, and the transformation seems about to be
  completed, when lo! a warlike peal of trumpets breaks the spell, and he
  shakes his spear aloft and leaps gladly from the earth, exulting in the sense
  of life and motion once more. Again the dream changes. Frenzied priest and
  Druidical stone have vanished like the mist that encircled them. It is a
  beautiful balmy night in June. The woods are black and silver in the
  moonlight. Not a breath of air stirs the topmost twigs of the lofty elm cut
  clear and distinct against the sky. Not a ripple blurs the surface of the
  lake, spread out and gleaming like a sheet of polished steel. The bittern
  calls at intervals from the adjacent marsh, and the nightingale carols in the
  copse. All is peaceful and beautiful, and suggestive of enjoyment or repose.
  Yet here, lying close amongst the foxglove and the fern, long lines of
  white-robed warriors are waiting but the signal for assault. And yonder,
  where the earthwork rises dark and level against the sky, paces to and fro a
  high-crested sentinel, watching over the safety of the eagles, with the calm
  and ceaseless vigilance of that discipline which has made the legionaries
  masters of the world.</p>

  <p>Once more the trumpets peal; the only sound to be heard in that array of
  tents, drawn up with such order and precision, behind the works, except the
  footfall of the Roman guard, firm and regular, as it relieves the previous
  watch. In a short space that duty will be performed; and then, if ever, must
  the attack be made with any probability of success. Youth is impatient of
  delay&mdash;the young warrior's pulse beats audibly, and he feels the edge of
  his blade and the point of his short-handled javelin, with an intensity of
  longing that is absolutely painful. At length the word is passed from rank to
  rank. Like the crest of a sea-wave breaking into foam, rises that wavering
  line of white, rolling its length out in the moonlight, as man after man
  springs erect at the touch of his comrade; and then a roar of voices, a rush
  of feet, and the wave dashes up and breaks against the steady solid
  resistance of the embankment. But discipline is not to be caught thus
  napping. Ere the echo of their trumpets has died out among the distant hills,
  the legionaries stand to their arms throughout the camp. Already the rampart
  gleams and bristles with shield and helmet, javelin, sword, and spear.
  Already the eagle is awake and defiant; unruffled, indeed, in plumage, but
  with beak and talons bare and whetted for defence. The tall centurions
  marshal their men in line even and regular, as though about to defile by the
  throne of Caesar, rather than to repel the attack of a wild barbarian foe.
  The tribunes, with their golden crests, take up their appointed posts in the
  four corners of the camp; while the praetor himself gives his orders calm and
  unmoved from the centre.</p>

  <p>Over the roar of the swarming Britons sounds the clear trumpet-note
  pealing out its directions, concise and intelligible as a living voice, and
  heard by the combatants far and wide, inspiring courage and confidence, and
  order in the confusion. Brandishing their long swords, the white-clad
  warriors of Britain rush tumultuously to the attack. Already, they have
  filled the ditch and scaled the earthwork; but once and again they recoil
  from the steady front and rigid discipline of the invader, while the short
  stabbing sword of the Roman soldier, covered as he is by his ample shield,
  does fearful execution at close quarters. But still fresh assailants pour in,
  and the camp is carried and overrun. The young warrior rushes exulting to and
  fro, and the enemy falls in heaps before him. Such moments are worth whole
  years of peaceful life. He has reached the praetorium. He is close beneath
  the eagles, and he leaps wildly at them to bring them off in triumph as
  trophies of his victory. But a grim centurion strikes him to the earth.
  Wounded, faint, and bleeding, he is carried away by his comrades, the shaft
  of the Roman standard in his hand. They bear him to a war-chariot, they lash
  the wild galloping steeds, the roll of the wheels thunders in his ears as
  they dash tumultuously across the plain, and then...the gentle mission is
  fulfilled, the doves fly down again to Proserpine, and the young, joyous,
  triumphant warrior of Britain wakes up a Roman slave.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-02"
     id="ch1-02">II</a>. &mdash; THE MARBLE PORCH</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was the sound of a chariot, truly enough, that roused the
  dreamer from his slumbers; but how different the scene on which his drowsy
  eyes unclosed, from that which fancy had conjured up in the shadowy realms of
  sleep!</p>

  <p>A beautiful portico, supported on slender columns of smooth white marble,
  protected him from the rays of the morning sun, already pouring down with the
  intensity of Italian heat. Garlands of leaves and flowers, cool and fresh in
  their contrast with the snowy surface of these dainty pillars, were wreathed
  around their stems, and twined amongst the delicate carving of their
  Corinthian capitals. Large stone vases, urn-shaped and massive, stood in long
  array at stated intervals, bearing the orange-tree, the myrtle, and other
  dark-green flowering shrubs, which formed a fair perspective of retirement
  and repose. Shapely statues filled the niches in the wall, or stood out more
  prominently in the vacant spaces of the colonnade. Here cowered a marble
  Venus, in the shamefaced consciousness of unequalled beauty; there stood
  forth a bright Apollo, exulting in the perfection of godlike symmetry and
  grace. Rome could not finger the chisel like her instructress Greece, the
  mother of the Arts, but the hand that firmly grasps the sword need never want
  for anything skill produces, or genius creates, or gold can buy; so it is no
  marvel that the masterpieces and treasures of the nations she subdued found
  their way to the Imperial City, mistress of the world. Even where the sleeper
  lay reclined upon a couch of curiously-carved wood from the forests that
  clothe Mount Hymettus, an owl so beautifully chiseled that its very
  breast-plumage seemed to ruffle in the breeze, looked down upon him from a
  niche where it had been placed at a cost that might have bought a dozen such
  human chattels as himself; for it had been brought from Athens as the most
  successful effort of a sculptor, who had devoted it to the honour of Minerva
  in his zeal. Refinement, luxury, nay, profusion, reigned paramount even here
  outside the sumptuous dwelling of a Roman lady: and the very ground in her
  porch over which she was borne, for she seldom touched it with her feet, was
  fresh swept and sanded as often as it had been disturbed by the tread of her
  litter-bearers, or the wheels of her chariot.</p>

  <p>Many a time was this ceremony performed in the twenty-four hours; for
  Valeria was a woman of noble rank, great possessions, and the highest
  fashion. Not a vanity of her sex, not a folly was there of her class, in
  which she scrupled to indulge; and then, as now, ladies were prone to rush
  into extremes, and frivolity, when it took the garb of a female, assumed
  preposterous dimensions, and a thirst for amusement, incompatible with reason
  or self-control.</p>

  <p>There is always a certain hush, and, as it were, a pompous stillness,
  about the houses of the great, even long after inferior mortals are astir in
  pursuit of their pleasure or their business. To-day was Valeria's birthday,
  and as such was duly observed by the hanging of garlands on the pillars of
  her porch; but after the completion of this graceful ceremony, silence seemed
  to have sunk once more upon the household, and the slave whose dream we have
  recorded, coming into her gates with an offering from his lord, and finding
  no domestics in the way, had sat him down to wait in the grateful shade, and,
  overcome with heat, might have slept on till noon had he not been roused by
  the grinding chariot-wheels, which mingled so confusedly with his dream.</p>

  <p>It was no plebeian vehicle that now rolled into the colonnade, driven at a
  furious pace, and stopping so abruptly as to create considerable confusion
  and insubordination amongst the noble animals that drew it. The car, mounted
  on two wheels, was constructed of a highly-polished wood, cut from the wild
  fig-tree, elaborately inlaid with ivory and gold; the very spokes and felloes
  of the wheels were carved in patterns of vine-leaves and flowers, whilst the
  extremities of the pole, the axle, and the yoke, were wrought into exquisite
  representations of the wolf's head, an animal, from historical reasons, ever
  dear to the fancy of the Roman. There was but one person besides the driver
  in the carriage, and so light a draught might indeed command any rate of
  speed, when whirled along by four such horses as now plunged and reared and
  bit each other's crests in the portico of Valeria's mansion. These were of a
  milky white, with dark muzzles, and a bluish tinge under the coat, denoting
  its soft texture, and the Eastern origin of the animals. Somewhat thick of
  neck and shoulders, with semicircular jowl, it was the broad and tapering
  head, the small quivering ear, the wide red nostril, that demonstrated the
  purity of their blood, and argued extraordinary powers of speed and
  endurance; while their short, round backs, prominent muscles, flat legs, and
  dainty feet, promised an amount of strength and activity only to be attained
  by the production of perfect symmetry. These beautiful animals were harnessed
  four abreast the inner pair, somewhat in the fashion of our modern curricle,
  being yoked to the pole, of which the very fastening-pins were steel overlaid
  with gold, whilst the outer horses, drawing only from a trace attached
  respectively on the inner side of each to the axle of the chariot, were free
  to wheel their quarters outwards in every direction, and kick to their
  heart's content a liberty of which, in the present instance, they seemed well
  disposed to avail themselves.</p>

  <p>The slave started to his feet as the nearest horse winced and swerved
  aside from his unexpected figure, snorting the while in mingled wantonness
  and fear. The axle grazed his tunic while it passed, and the driver,
  irritated at his horses' unsteadiness, or perhaps in the mere insolence of a
  great man's favourite, struck at him heavily with his whip as he went by. The
  Briton's blood boiled at the indignity; but his sinewy arm was up like
  lightning to parry the blow, and as the lash curled round his wrist he drew
  the weapon quickly from the driver's hand, and would have returned the insult
  with interest, had he not been deterred from his purpose by the youthful,
  effeminate appearance of the aggressor.</p>

  <p>"I cannot strike a girl!" exclaimed the slave contemptuously, throwing the
  whip at the same time into the floor of the chariot, where it lit at the feet
  of the other occupant, a sumptuously-dressed nobleman, who enjoyed the
  discomfiture of his charioteer, with the loud frank glee of a master jeering
  a dependent.</p>

  <p>"Well said, my hero!" laughed the patrician, adding in good-humoured,
  though haughty tones, "Not that I would give much for the chance of man or
  woman in a grasp like yours. By Jupiter! you've got the arms and shoulders of
  Antaeus! Who owns you, my good fellow? and what do you here?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, I would strike him again to some purpose if I were on the ground
  with him," interrupted the charioteer, a handsome, petulant youth of some
  sixteen summers, whose long flowing curls and rich scarlet mantle denoted a
  pampered and favourite slave. "Gently, Scipio! So-ho, Jugurtha The horses
  will fret for an hour now they have been scared by his ugly face."</p>

  <p>"Better let him alone, Automedon!" observed his master, again shaking his
  sides at the obvious discomfiture portrayed on the flushed face of his
  favourite. "Through your life keep clear of a man when he shuts his mouth
  like that, as you would of an ox with a wisp of hay on his horn. You silly
  boy! why he would swallow such a slender frame as yours at a gulp: and nobody
  but a fool ever strikes at a man unless he knows he can reach him, ay, and
  punish him too, without hurting his own knuckles in return! But what do you
  here, good fellow?" he repeated, addressing himself once more to the slave,
  who stood erect, scanning his questioner with a fearless, though respectful
  eye.</p>

  <p>"My master is your friend," was the outspoken answer. "You supped with him
  only the night before last But a man need not be in the household of
  Licinius, not have spent his best years at Rome, to know the face of Julius
  Placidus, the tribune."</p>

  <p>A smile of gratified vanity stole over the patrician's countenance while
  he listened; a smile that had the effect of imparting to its lineaments an
  expression at once mocking, crafty, and malicious. In repose, and such was
  its usual condition, the face was almost handsome, perfect in its regularity,
  and of a fixed, sedate composure which bordered on vacuity, but when
  disturbed, as it sometimes, though rarely, was, by a passing emotion, the
  smile that passed over it like a lurid gleam, became truly diabolical.</p>

  <p>The slave was right. Amongst all the notorious personages who crowded and
  jostled each other in the streets of Rome at that stormy period, none was
  better known, none more courted, flattered, honoured, hated, and mistrusted,
  than the occupant of the gilded chariot It was no time for men to wear their
  hearts in their hands it was no time to make an additional enemy, or to lose
  a possible friend. Since the death of Tiberius, emperor had succeeded emperor
  with alarming rapidity. Nero had indeed died by his own hand, to avoid the
  just retribution of unexampled vices and crimes; but the poisoned mushroom
  had carried off his predecessor, and the old man who succeeded him fell by
  the weapons of the very guards he had enlisted to protect his grey head from
  violence. Since then another suicide had indued Vitellius with the purple;
  but the throne of the Caesars was fast becoming synonymous with a scaffold,
  and the sword of Damocles quivered more menacingly, and on a slenderer hair
  than ever, over the diadem.</p>

  <p>When great political convulsions agitate a State, already seething with
  general vice and luxury, the moral scum seems, by a law of nature, to float
  invariably to the surface&mdash;the characters most destitute of principle,
  the readiest to obey the instincts of self-aggrandisement and expediency,
  achieve a kind of spurious fame, a doubtful and temporary success. Under the
  rule of Nero, perhaps, there was but one path to Court favour, and that lay
  in the disgraceful attempt to vie with this emperor's brutalities and crimes.
  The palace of Caesar was then indeed a sink of foul iniquity and utter
  degradation. The sycophant who could most readily reduce himself to the level
  of a beast in gross sensuality, while he boasted a demon's refinement of
  cruelty, and morbid depravity of heart, became the first favourite for the
  time with his imperial master. To be fat, slothful, weak, gluttonous, and
  effeminate, while the brow was crowned with roses, and the brain was drenched
  with wine, and the hands were steeped in blood&mdash;this it was to be a
  friend and counsellor of Caesar. Men waited and wondered in stupefied awe
  when they marked the monster reeling from a debauch to some fresh feast of
  horrors, some ingenious exhibition of the complicated tortures that may be
  inflicted on a human being, some devilish experiment of all the body can
  bear, ere the soul takes wing from its ghastly, mutilated tenement, and this
  not on one, but a thousand victims. They waited and wondered what the gods
  were about, that divine vengeance should slumber through such provocations as
  these.</p>

  <p>But retribution overtook him at last. The heart which a slaughtered
  mother's spectre could not soften, which remorse for a pregnant wife's fate,
  kicked to death by a brutal lord, failed to wring, quailed at the approach of
  a few exasperated soldiers; and the tyrant who had so often smiled to see
  blood flow like water in the amphitheatre, died by his own hand&mdash;died as
  he had lived, a coward and a murderer to the last.</p>

  <p>Since then, the Court was a sphere in which any bold unscrupulous man
  might be pretty sure of attaining success. The present emperor was a good-
  humoured glutton, one whose faculties, originally vigorous, had been warped
  and deadened by excess, just as his body had become bloated, his eye dimmed,
  his strength palsied, and his courage destroyed by the same course. The
  scheming statesman, the pliant courtier, the successful soldier had but one
  passion now, one only object for the exercise of his energies, both of mind
  and body&mdash;to eat enormously, to drink to excess, to study every art by
  which fresh appetite could be stimulated when gorged to repletion&mdash;and
  then&mdash;to eat and drink again.</p>

  <p>With such a patron, any man who united to a tendency for the pleasures of
  the table, a strong brain, a cool head, and an aptitude for business, might
  be sure of considerable influence. The Emperor thoroughly appreciated one who
  would take trouble off his hands, while at the same time he encouraged his
  master, by precept and example, in his swinish propensities. It was no slight
  service to Vitellius, to rise from a debauch and give those necessary orders
  in an unforeseen emergency which Caesar's sodden brain was powerless to
  originate or to understand.</p>

  <p>Ere Placidus had been a month about the Court, he had insinuated himself
  thoroughly into the good graces of the Emperor. This man's had been a strange
  and stirring history. Born of patrician rank, he had used his family
  influence to advance him in the military service, and already, whilst still
  in the flower of youth, had attained the grade of tribune in Vespasian's
  army, then occupying Judaea under that distinguished general. Although no man
  yielded so willingly, or gave himself up so entirely to the indolent
  enjoyments of Asiatic life, Placidus possessed many of the qualities which
  are esteemed essential to the character of a soldier. Personal bravery, or we
  should rather say, insensibility to danger, was one of his peculiar
  advantages. Perhaps this is a quality inseparable from such an organisation
  as his, in which, while the system seems to contain a wealth of energy and
  vitality, the nerves are extremely callous to irritation, and completely
  under control. The tribune never came out in more favourable colours than
  when everyone about him was in a state of alarm and confusion. On one
  occasion, at the siege of Jotapata, where the Jews were defending themselves
  with the desperate energy of their race, Placidus won golden opinions from
  Vespasian by the cool dexterity with which he saved from destruction a whole
  company of soldiers and their centurion, under the very eye of his
  general.</p>

  <p>A maniple, or, in the military language of to-day, a wing of the cohort
  led by Placidus was advancing to the attack, and the first centurion, with
  the company under his command, was already beneath the wall, bristling as it
  was with defenders, who hurled down on their assailants darts, javelins, huge
  stones, every description of weapon or missile, including molten lead and
  boiling oil. Under cover of a movable pent -house, which protected them, the
  head of the column had advanced their battering-ram to the very wall, and
  were swinging the huge engine back, by the ropes and pulleys which governed
  it, for an increased impulse of destruction, when the Jews, who had been
  watching their opportunity, succeeded in balancing an enormous mass of
  granite immediately above the pent-house and the materials of offence,
  animate and inanimate, which it contained. A Jewish warrior clad in shining
  armour had taken a lever in his hand, and was in the act of applying that
  instrument to the impending tottering mass; in another instant it must have
  crashed down upon their heads, and buried the whole band beneath its weight.
  At his appointed station by the eagle, the tribune was watching the movements
  of his men with his usual air of sleepy, indolent approval. And even in this
  critical moment his eye never brightened, his colour never deepened a shade.
  The voice was calm, low, and perfectly modulated in which he bade the
  trumpeter at his right hand sound the recall; nor, though its business-like
  rapidity could scarce have been exceeded by the most practised archer, was
  the movement the least hurried with which he snatched the bow from a dead
  Parthian auxiliary at his feet and fitted an arrow to its string. In the
  twinkling of an eye, while the granite vibrated on the very parapet, that
  arrow was quivering between the joints of the warrior's harness who held the
  lever, and he had fallen with his head over the wall in the throes of death.
  Before another of the defenders could take his place the assaulting party had
  retired, bringing along with them, in their cool and rigid discipline, the
  battering-ram and wooden covering which protected it, while the tribune
  quietly observed, as he replaced the bow into the fallen Parthian's hand. "A
  company saved is a hundred men gained. A dead barbarian is exactly worth my
  tallest centurion, and the smartest troop I have in the maniple!"</p>

  <p>Vespasian was not the man to forget such an instance of cool promptitude,
  and Julius Placidus was marked out for promotion from that day forth. But
  with its courage, the tribune possessed the cunning of the tiger, not without
  something also of that fierce animal's outward beauty, and much of its
  watchful, pitiless, and untiring nature. A brave soldier should have
  considered it a degradation, under any circumstances, to play a double part;
  but with Placidus every step was esteemed honourable so long as it was on the
  ascent. The successful winner had no scruple in deceiving all about him at
  Rome, by the eagerness with which he assumed the character of a mere man of
  pleasure, while he lost no opportunity the while of ingratiating himself with
  the many desperate spirits who were to be found in the Imperial City, ready
  and willing to assist in any enterprise which should tend to anarchy and
  confusion. While he rushed into every extravagance and pleasure of that
  luxurious Court&mdash;while he vied with Caesar himself in his profusion, and
  surpassed him in his orgies&mdash;he suffered no symptoms to escape him of a
  higher ambition than that of excellence in trifling&mdash;of deeper projects
  than those which affected the winecup, the pageant, and the passing follies
  of the hour. Yet all the while, within that dainty reveller's brain, schemes
  were forming and thoughts burning that should have withered the very roses on
  his brow. It might have been the strain of Greek blood which filtered through
  his veins, that tempered his Roman courage and endurance with the pliancy
  essential to conspiracy and intrigue&mdash;a strain that was apparent in his
  sculptured regularity of features, and general symmetry of form. His
  character has already been compared to the tiger's, and his movements had all
  the pliant ease and stealthy freedom of that graceful animal. His stature was
  little above the average of his countrymen, but his frame was cast in that
  mould of exact proportion which promises the extreme of strength combined
  with agility and endurance. Had he been caught like Milo, he would have
  writhed himself out of the trap, with the sinuous persistency of a snake.
  There was something snake-like, too, in his small glittering eye, and the
  clear smoothness of his skin. With all its brightness no woman worthy of the
  name but would have winced with womanly instincts of aversion and repugnance
  from his glance. With all its beauty no child would have looked up frankly
  and confidingly in his face. Men turned, indeed, to scan him approvingly as
  he passed; but the brave owned no sympathy with that smooth set brow, that
  crafty and malicious smile, while the timid or the superstitious shuddered
  and shrank away, averting their own gaze from what they felt to be the
  influence of the evil eye. Yet, in his snowy tunic bleached to dazzling
  white, in his collar of linked gold, his jewelled belt, his embroidered
  sandals, and the ample folds of his deep violet mantle, nearly approaching
  purple, Julius Placidus was no unworthy representative of his time and his
  order, no mean specimen of the wealth, and foppery, and extravagance of
  Rome.</p>

  <p>Such was the man who now stood up in his gilded chariot at Valeria's door,
  masking with his usual expression of careless indolence, the real impatience
  he felt for tidings of its mistress.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-03"
     id="ch1-03">III</a>. &mdash; HERMES</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was customary with the more refined aristocracy of Rome,
  during the first century of the Empire, to pay great respect to Mercury, the
  god of invention and intrigue. Not that the qualities generally attributed to
  that power were calculated to inspire admiration or esteem, but simply
  because he had acquired a fortuitous popularity at a period when the graceful
  Pantheism of the nation was regulated by general opinion, and when a deity
  went in and out of fashion like a dress. At Valeria's porch, in common with
  many other great houses, stood an exquisite statue of the god, representing
  him as a youth, of athletic and symmetrical proportions, poised on a winged
  foot in the act of running, with the broad-leaf hat on his head, and the
  snake-turned rod in his hand. The countenance of the statue was expressive of
  intellect and vivacity, while the form was wrought into the highest ideal of
  activity and strength. It was placed on a square pedestal of marble
  immediately opposite the door; and behind this pedestal, the slave retired in
  some confusion when a train of maidens appeared from within, to answer the
  summons of Julius Placidus in his chariot.</p>

  <p>The tribune did not think it necessary to alight, but producing from the
  bosom of his tunic a jewelled casket, leaned one hand on the shoulder of
  Automedon, while with the other he proffered his gift to a damsel who seemed
  the chief among her fellows, and whose manners partook largely of the
  flippancy of the waiting-maid.</p>

  <p>"Commend me to your mistress," said Placidus, at the same time throwing a
  gold chain round her neck on her own account, and bending carelessly down to
  take a receipt for the same, in the shape of a caress; "bid her every good
  omen from the most faithful of her servants, and ask her at what hour I may
  hope to be received on this her birthday, which the trifle you carry to her
  from me will prove I have not forgotten."</p>

  <p>The waiting-maid tried hard to raise a blush, but with all her efforts the
  rich Southern colour would not deepen on her cheek; so she thought better of
  it, and looked him full in the face with her bold black eyes, while she
  replied: "You have forgotten surely, my lord, that this is the feast of Isis,
  and no lady that is a lady, at least here in Rome, can have leisure to-day
  for anything but the sacred mysteries of the goddess."</p>

  <p>Placidus laughed outright; and it was strange how his laugh scared those
  who watched it. Automedon fairly turned pale, and even the waiting-maid
  seemed disconcerted for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of these mysteries," said he. "my pretty Myrrhina, and who
  has not? The Roman ladies keep them somewhat jealously to themselves; and by
  all accounts it is well for our sex that they do so. Nevertheless there are
  yet some hours of sunlight to pass before the chaste rites of Egypt can
  possibly begin. Will not Valeria see me in the interval?"</p>

  <p>A very quick ear might have detected the least possible tremor in the
  tribune's voice as he spoke the last sentence; it was not lost upon Myrrhina,
  for she showed all the white teeth in her large well-formed mouth, while she
  enumerated with immense volubility those different pursuits which filled up
  the day of a fashionable Roman lady.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" burst out the damsel. "She has not a moment to spare from
  now till sunset. There's her dinner, 1 and her fencing-lesson, and her bath,
  and her dressing, and the sculptor coming for her hand, and the painter for
  her face, and the new Greek sandals to be fitted to her feet. Then she has
  sent for Philogemon, the augur, to cast her horoscope, and for Galanthis, who
  is cleverer than ever Locusta was, and has twice the practice, to prepare a
  philtre. Maybe it is for you, my lord," added the girl roguishly. "I hear the
  ladies are all using them just now."</p>

  <p>1 The dinner or prandium of Rome was the first meal in the day.</p>

  <p>The evil smile crossed the tribune's face once more; perhaps he too had
  been indebted to the potions of Galanthis, for purposes of love or hate, and
  he did not care to be reminded of them.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said he meaningly, "there is no need for that. Valeria can do more
  with one glance of her bright eyes, than all the potions and poisons of
  Galanthis put together. Say, Myrrhina&mdash;you are in my interest&mdash;does
  she look more favourably of late?"</p>

  <p>"How can I tell, my lord?" answered the girl, with an arch expression of
  amusement and defiance in her face. "My mistress is but a woman after all,
  and they say women are more easily mastered by the strong hand, than lured by
  the honey lip. She is not to be won by a smooth tongue and a beardless face,
  I know, for heard her say so to Paris myself, in the very spot where we are
  now standing. Juno! but the player slunk away somewhat crestfallen, I can
  tell you, when she called him 'a mere girl in her brother's clothes' at the
  best. No; the man who wins my mistress will be a man all over, I'll answer
  for it! So far, she is like the rest of us for that matter."</p>

  <p>Arid Myrrhina sighed, thinking, it may be, of some sunburnt youth the
  while, whose rough but not unwelcome wooing had assailed her in her early
  girlhood, ere she came to Rome; far away yonder amongst the blushing vines,
  in the bright Campanian hills.</p>

  <p>"Say you so?" observed the tribune, obviously flattered by the implied
  compliment; for he was proud in his secret heart of his bodily strength.
  "Nay, there was a fellow standing here when I drove up, who would make an
  easy conquest of you, Myrrhina, if, like your Sabine grandams, you must be
  borne off to be wed, on your lover's shoulders. By the body of Hercules! he
  would tuck you up under his arm as easily as you carry that casket, which you
  seem so afraid to let out of your hand. Ay, there he is! lurking behind
  Hermes. Stand forth, my good fellow! What! you are not afraid of Automedon,
  are you, and the crack of that young reprobate's whip?"</p>

  <p>While he spoke, the slave stepped forward from his lurking-place behind
  the statue, where the quick eye of Placidus had detected him, and presented
  to Myrrhina with a respectful gesture the offering of his lord to her
  mistress a filigree basket of frosted silver, filled with a few choice fruits
  and flowers&mdash;</p>

  <p>"From Caius Licinius, greeting," said he. "in honour of Valeria's natal
  day. The flowers are scarce yet dry from the spray that brawling Anio flings
  upon its banks; the fruits were glowing in yesterday's sun, on the brightest
  slopes of Tibur. My master offers the freshest and fairest of his fruits and
  flowers to his kinswoman, who is fresher and fairer than them all."</p>

  <p>He delivered his message, which he had obviously learned by rote, in
  sufficiently pure and fluent Latin, scarcely tinged with the accent of a
  barbarian, and bowing low as he placed the basket in Myrrhina's hand, drew
  himself up to his noble height, and looked proudly, almost defiantly, at the
  tribune.</p>

  <p>The girl started and turned pale it seemed as if the statue of Hermes had
  descended from its pedestal to do her homage. He stood there, that glorious
  specimen of manhood, in his majestic strength and symmetry, in the glow of
  his youth, and health, and beauty, like an impersonation of the god.
  Myrrhina, in common with many of her sex, was easily fascinated by external
  advantages, and she laughed nervously, while she accepted with shaking hands
  the handsome slave's offering to his master's kinswoman.</p>

  <p>"Will you not enter?" said she, the colour mantling once more, and this
  time without an effort, in her burning cheeks. "It is not the custom to
  depart from Valeria's house without breaking bread and drinking wine."</p>

  <p>But the slave excused himself, abruptly, almost rudely, losing, be sure,
  by his refusal, none of the ground he had already gained in Myrrhina's good
  graces. It chafed him to remain even at the porch. The atmosphere of luxury
  that pervaded it, seemed to weigh upon his senses, and oppress his breath.
  Moreover, the insult he had sustained from Automedon, yet rankled in his
  heart. How he wished the boy charioteer was nearer his match in size and
  strength! He would have hurled him from the chariot where he stood, turning
  his curls so insolently round his dainty fingers&mdash;hurled him to earth
  beyond his horses' heads, and taught him the strength of a Briton's arm and
  the squeeze of a Briton's gripe. "Ay! and his master after him!" thought the
  slave, for already he experienced towards Placidus that unaccountable
  instinct of aversion which seems to warn men of a future foe, and which, to
  give him his due, the tribune was not unused to awaken in a brave and honest
  breast.</p>

  <p>Placidus, however, scanned him once more, as he strode away, with the
  critical gaze of a judge of human animals. It was this man's peculiarity to
  look on all he met as possible tools, that might come into use for various
  purposes at a future and indefinite time. If he observed more than usual
  courage in a soldier, superior acuteness in a freedman, nay, even uncommon
  beauty in a woman, he bethought himself that although he might have no
  immediate use for these qualities, occasions often arose on which he could
  turn them to his profit, and he noted, and made sure of, their amount
  accordingly. In the present instance, although somewhat surprised that he had
  never before remarked the slave's stalwart proportions in the household of
  Licinius, whose affection for the Briton had excused him from all menial
  offices, and consequent contact with visitors, he determined not to lose
  sight of one so formed by nature to excel in the gymnasium or the
  amphitheatre, while there crept into his heart a cruel cold-blooded feeling
  of satisfaction at the possibility of witnessing so muscular and shapely a
  figure in the contortions of a mortal struggle, or the throes of a painful
  death.</p>

  <p>Besides, there was envy, too, at the bottom&mdash;&mdash;envy in the proud
  patrician's breast, leaning so negligently on the cushions of his gilded
  chariot, with all his advantages of rank, reputation, wealth, and influence
  envy of the noble bearing, the personal comeliness, and the free manly step
  of the slave.</p>

  <p>"Had he struck thee, Automedon," said his master, unable to resist
  taunting the petted youth who held the reins; "had he but laid a finger on
  thee, thou hadst never spoken again, and I had been rid of the noisiest and
  most useless of my household. Gently with that outside horse; dost see how he
  chafes upon the rein? Gently, boy, I say! and drive me back into the
  Forum."</p>

  <p>As he settled himself among the cushions and rolled swiftly away, Myrrhina
  came forth into the porch once more. She seemed, however, scarcely to notice
  the departing chariot, but looked dreamily about her, and then re-entered the
  house with a shake of the head, a smile, and something that was almost a
  sigh.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-04"
     id="ch1-04">IV</a>. &mdash; APHRODITE</h2>

  <p class="first">A NEGRO boy, the ugliest of his kind, and probably all the
  more prized for that reason, was shifting uneasily from knee to knee, in an
  attitude of constraint that showed how long and tiresome he felt his office,
  and how wearied he was of Valeria's own apartment. Such a child, for the
  urchin seemed of the tenderest age, might be initiated without impropriety
  into the mysteries of a lady's toilet; and, indeed, the office it was his
  duty to undertake, formed the most indispensable part of the whole
  performance. With a skill and steadiness beyond his years, though with a
  rueful face, he was propping up an enormous mirror, in which his mistress
  might contemplate the whole galaxy of her charms&mdash;a mirror formed of one
  broad plate of silver, burnished to the brightness and lucidity of glass, set
  in an oval frame of richly chased gold, wrought into fantastic patterns and
  studded with emeralds, rubies, and other precious stones. Not a speck was to
  be discerned on the polish of its dazzling surface; and, indeed, the time of
  one maiden was devoted to the task alone of preserving it from the lightest
  breath that might dim its brightness, and cloud the reflection of the stately
  form that now sat before it, undergoing, at the hands of her attendants, the
  pleasing tortures of an elaborate toilet.</p>

  <p>The reflection was that of a large handsome woman in the very prime and
  noontide of her beauty&mdash;a woman whose every movement and gesture bespoke
  physical organisation of a vigorous nature and perfect health. While the
  strong white neck gave grace and dignity to her carriage&mdash;while the deep
  bosom and somewhat massive shoulders partook more of Juno's majestic frame
  than Hebe's pliant youth&mdash;while the full sweep and outline of her figure
  denoted maturity and completeness in every part&mdash;the long round limbs,
  the shapely hands and feet, might have belonged to Diana, so perfect was
  their symmetry; the warm flush that tinted them, the voluptuous ease of her
  attitude, the gentle languor of her whole bearing, would have done no
  discredit to the goddess, hanging over the mountain-tops in the golden summer
  nights to look down upon Endymion, and bathe her sleeping favourite in floods
  of light and love.</p>

  <p>Too fastidious a critic might have objected to Valeria's form that it
  expressed more of physical strength than is compatible with perfect womanly
  beauty, that the muscles were developed overmuch, and the whole frame,
  despite its flowing outlines, partook somewhat of a man's organisation, and a
  man's redundant strength. The same fault might have been found in a less
  degree with her countenance. There was a little too much resolution in the
  small aquiline nose, something of manly audacity and energy in the large
  well-formed mouth, with its broad white teeth that the fullest and reddest of
  lips could not conceal&mdash;a shade of masculine sternness on the low wide
  brow, smooth and white, but somewhat prominent, and scarcely softened by the
  arch of the marked eyebrows, or the dark sweep of the lashes that fringed the
  long laughing eyes.</p>

  <p>And yet it was a face that a man, and still more a boy, could hardly have
  looked on without misgivings that he might too soon learn to long for its
  glances, its smiles, its approval, and its love. There was such a glow of
  health on the soft transparent skin, such a freshness and vitality in the
  colour of those blooming cheeks, such a sparkle in the grey eyes, that
  flashed so meaningly when she smiled, that gleamed so clear and bright and
  cold when the features resumed their natural expression, grave, scornful,
  almost stern in their repose; and then such womanly softness in the masses of
  rich nut-brown hair that showered down neck and shoulders, to form a
  framework for this lovely, dangerous, and too alluring picture. Even the
  little negro, wearied as he was, peeped at intervals from the back of the
  mirror he upheld, fawning like a dog for some sign of approval from his
  haughty, careless mistress. At length she bade him keep still, with a
  half-scornful smile at his antics; and the sharp white teeth gleamed from ear
  to ear of the dusky little face, as it grinned with pleasure, while the boy
  settled himself once more in an attitude of patience and steady
  submission.</p>

  <p>Nor was Valeria's apartment unworthy of the noble beauty who devoted it to
  the mysterious rites of dress and decoration. Everything that luxury could
  imagine for bodily ease, everything that science had as yet discovered for
  the preservation or the production of feminine attractions, was there to be
  found in its handsomest and costliest form. In one recess, shrouded by
  transparent curtains of the softest pink, was the bath that could be heated
  at will to any temperature, and the marble steps of which that shapely form
  was accustomed to descend twice and thrice a day. In another stood the ivory
  couch with its quilted crimson silks and ornamental pillars of solid gold, in
  which Valeria slept, and dreamed such dreams as hover round the rest of those
  whose life is luxury, and whose business is a ceaseless career of pleasure.
  On a table of cedar-wood, fashioned like a palm-leaf opening out from a
  pedestal that terminated in a single claw of grotesque shape, stood her
  silver night-lamp, exhaling odours of perfumed oil, and near it lay the waxen
  tablets, on which she made her memorandums, or composed her love-letters, and
  from which, as from an unfinished task, the sharp-pointed steel pencil had
  rolled away upon the shining floor. Through the whole court for court it
  might be called, with its many entrances and recesses, its cool and shady
  nooks, its lofty ceiling and its tesselated pavement choice vases, jewelled
  cups, burnished chalices, and exquisite little statues, were scattered in
  systematic irregularity and graceful profusion. Even the very water in the
  bath flowed through the mouth of a marble Cupid; and two more winged urchins
  wrought in bronze, supported a stand on which was set a formidable array of
  perfumes, essences, cosmetics, and such material for offensive and defensive
  warfare.</p>

  <p>The walls, too, of this seductive arsenal, were delicately tinted of a
  light rose-colour, that should throw the most becoming shade over its
  inmates, relieved at intervals by oval wreaths wrought out in bas-relief,
  enclosing diverse mythological subjects, in which the figure of Venus,
  goddess of love and laughter, predominated. Round the cornices stretched a
  frieze representing, also in relief, the fabulous contests of the Amazons
  with every description of monster, amongst which the most conspicuous foe was
  the well-known gryphon, or griffin, an abnormal quadruped, with the head and
  neck of a bird of prey. It was curious to trace in the female warriors thus
  delineated, something of the imperious beauty, the vigorous symmetry, and the
  dauntless bearing that distinguished Valeria herself, though their energetic
  and spirited attitudes afforded, at the same time, a marked contrast to the
  pleasing languor that seemed to pervade every movement of that luxurious lady
  reclining before her mirror, and submitting indolently to the attentions of
  her maid-servants.</p>

  <p>These were five in number, and constituted the principal slaves of her
  household; the most important among them seemed to be a tall matronly woman,
  considerably older than her comrades, who filled the responsible office of
  housekeeper in the establishment&mdash;a dignity which did not, however,
  exempt her from insult, and even blows, when she failed to satisfy the
  caprices of a somewhat exacting mistress; the others, comely laughing girls,
  with the sparkling v eyes and white teeth of their countrywomen, seemed
  principally occupied with the various matters that constituted their lady's
  toilet a daily penance, in which, notwithstanding the rigour of its
  discipline, and the severities that were sure to follow the most trifling act
  of negligence, they took an inexplicable and essentially feminine
  delight.</p>

  <p>Of these it was obvious that Myrrhina was the first in place as in favour.
  She it was who brought her mistress the warm towels for her bath; who was
  ready with her slippers when she emerged; who handed every article of
  clothing as it was required; whose taste was invariably consulted, and whose
  decision was considered final, on such important points as the position of a
  jewel, the studied negligence of a curl, or the exact adjustment of a
  fold.</p>

  <p>This girl possessed, with an Italian exterior, the pliant cunning and
  plausible fluency of the Greek. Born a slave on one of Valeria's estates in
  the country, she had been reared a mere peasant, on a simple country diet,
  and amidst healthful country occupations, till a freak of her mistress
  brought her to Rome. With a woman's versatility&mdash;with a woman's
  quickness in adapting herself to a strange phase of life and a total change
  of circumstances&mdash;the country girl had not been a year in her new
  situation, ere she became the acutest and cleverest waiting-maid in the
  capital, with what benefit to her own morals and character, it is needless to
  inquire. Who so quick as Myrrhina to prepare the unguents, the perfumes, or
  the cosmetics that repaired the injuries of climate, and effaced the marks of
  dissipation? Who so delicate a sempstress; who had such taste in colours; who
  could convey a note or a message with half such precision, simplicity, and
  tact? In short, who was ever so ready, in an emergency, with brush,
  crisping-iron, needle, hand, eye, or tongue? Intrigue was her native element.
  To lie on her mistress's behalf, seemed as natural as on her own. He who
  would advance in Valeria's goodwill, must begin by bribing her maid; and many
  a Roman gallant had ere this discovered that even that royal road to success
  was as tedious as it was costly, and might lead eventually to discomfiture
  and disgrace.</p>

  <p>As she took the pouncet-box from one of the girls, and proceeded to
  sprinkle gold-dust in Valeria's hair, Myrrhina's eye was caught by the gift
  of Placidus, lying neglected at her feet, the casket open, the jewels
  scattered on the floor. Such as it was, the waiting -maid owned a conscience.
  It warned her that she had not as yet worked out the value of the costly
  chain thrown round her neck by the tribune. Showering the gold-dust liberally
  about her lady's head, Myrrhina felt her way cautiously to the delicate
  theme.</p>

  <p>"There's a new fashion coming in for headgear when the weather gets
  cooler," said she. "It's truth I tell you, madam, for I heard it direct from
  Selina, who was told by the Empress's first tirewoman, though even Caesar
  himself cannot think Galeria looks well, with that yellow mop stuck all over
  her head. But it's to be the fashion, nevertheless, and right sorry I am to
  hear it; nor am I the only one for that matter."</p>

  <p>"Why so?" asked Valeria languidly; "is it more troublesome than the
  present?"</p>

  <p>Myrrhina had done with the gold-dust now, and, holding the comb in her
  mouth, was throwing a rich brown curl across her wrist, while she laid a plat
  carefully beneath it. Notwithstanding the impediment between her lips,
  however, she was able to reply with great volubility.</p>

  <p>"The trouble counts for nothing, madam, when a lady has got such hair as
  yours. It's a pleasure to run your hands through it, let alone dressing and
  crisping it, and plaiting it up into a crown that's fit for a queen. But this
  new fashion will make us all alike, whether we're as bald as old Lyce, or
  wear our curls down to our ankles, like Neaera. Still, to hide such hair as
  <i>yours</i>;&mdash;as my lord said, only this morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What lord? this morning!" interrupted Valeria, a dawn of interest waking
  on her handsome features; "not Licinius, my noble kinsman? His approval is
  indeed worth having."</p>

  <p>"Better worth than his gifts," answered Myrrhina pertly; pointing to the
  filigree basket which occupied a place of honour on the toilet-table. "Such a
  birthday present I never saw! A few late roses and a bunch or two of figs to
  the richest lady in Rome! To be sure, he sent a messenger with them, who
  might have come direct from Jove, and the properest man I ever set eyes
  on."</p>

  <p>And Myrrhina moved to one side, that her lady might not observe the blush
  that rose, even to her shameless brow, as she recalled the impression made on
  her by the handsome slave. Valeria liked to hear of proper men; she woke up a
  little out of her languor, and flung the hair back from her face.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said she, as Myrrhina hesitated, half eager and half loth to
  pursue the pleasing topic.</p>

  <p>But the waiting-maid felt the chain round her neck, and acknowledged in
  her heart the equivalent it demanded.</p>

  <p>"It was the tribune, madam," said she. "who spoke about your
  hair&mdash;Julius Placidus, who values every curl you wear, more than a whole
  mine of gold. Ah! there's not a lord in Rome has such a taste in dress. Only
  to see him this morning, with his violet mantle and his jewels sparkling in
  the sun, with the handsomest chariot and the four whitest horses in the town.
  Well! if I was a lady, and wooed by such a man as that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Man</i> call you him?" interrupted her mistress, with a scornful
  smile. "Nay, when these curled, perfumed, close-shaven things are called men,
  'tis time for us women to bestir ourselves, lest strength and courage die out
  in Rome altogether. And you, too, Myrrhina, who know Licinius and Hippias,
  and saw with your own eyes two hundred gladiators in the circus only
  yesterday, you ought to be a better judge. Man, forsooth! Why, you will be
  calling smooth-faced Paris a man next!"</p>

  <p>Here maid and mistress burst out laughing, for thereby hung a tale of
  which Valeria was not a little proud. This Paris, a young Egyptian, of
  beautiful but effeminate appearance, had lately come to Italy to figure with
  no small success on the Roman stage. His delicate features, his symmetrical
  shape, and the girlish graces of his pantomimic gestures, had made sad havoc
  in the hearts of the Roman ladies, at all times too susceptible to histrionic
  charms. He lost nothing, either, of public attention, by bearing the name of
  Nero's ill-fated favourite, and embarked at once, unhesitatingly, on the same
  brilliant and dangerous career. But although it was the fashion to be in love
  with Paris, Valeria alone never yielded to the mode, but treated him with all
  the placid indifference she felt for attractions that found no favour in her
  sight. Stung by such neglect, the petted actor paid devoted court to the
  woman who despised him, and succeeded, after much importunity, in prevailing
  on her to accord him an interview in her own house. Of this he had the bad
  taste to make no small boast in anticipation; and Myrrhina, who found out
  most things, lost no time in informing her mistress that her condescension
  was already as much misrepresented as it was misplaced. The two laid their
  plans accordingly; and when Paris, attired in the utmost splendour, arrived
  panting to the promised interview, he found himself seized by some half-dozen
  hideous old negresses, who smothered him with caresses, stripped him from
  head to foot, forced him into the bath, and persisted in treating him as if
  he were a delicate young lady, but with a quiet violence the while, that it
  was useless to resist. The same swarthy tirewomen then dressed him in female
  garments; and despite of threats, struggles, outcries, and entreaties, placed
  him in Valeria's litter, and so carried him home to his own door. The ready
  wit of the play-actor put upon his metamorphosis the construction least
  favourable to the character of its originator; but he vowed a summary
  vengeance, we may be sure, nevertheless.</p>

  <p>"I think Paris knows what you think of him only too well," resumed
  Myrrhina; "not but that he has a fair face of his own, and a lovely shape for
  dancing, though, to be sure, Placidus is a finer figure of a man. Oh! if you
  could have seen him this morning, madam, when he lay back so graceful in his
  chariot, and chid that pert lad of his for striking with his whip at the tall
  slave, who to be sure vanished like a flash of lightning, you would have said
  there wasn't such another patrician in the whole city of Rome!"</p>

  <p>"Enough of Placidus!" interrupted her mistress impatiently; "the subject
  wearies me. What of this tall slave, Myrrhina, who seems to have attracted
  your attention? Did he look like one of the barbarians my kinsman Licinius
  cries up so mightily? Is he handsome enough to step with my Liburnians, think
  you, under the day-litter?"</p>

  <p>The waiting-maid's eyes sparkled as she thought how pleasant it would be
  to have him in the same household as herself; and any little restraint she
  might have experienced in running over the personal advantages that had
  captivated her fancy disappeared before this agreeable prospect.</p>

  <p>"Handsome enough, madam!" she exclaimed, removing the comb from her mouth,
  dropping her lady's hair, and flourishing her hands with true Italian
  emphasis and rapidity,&mdash;"handsome enough! why he would make the
  Liburnians look like bald-headed vultures beside a golden eagle! Barbarian,
  like enough, he may be, Cimbrian, Frisian, Ansibarian, or what not, for I
  caught the foreign accent tripping on his tongue, and we have few men in Rome
  of stature equal to his. A neck like a tower of marble; arms and shoulders
  like the statue of Hercules yonder in the vestibule; a face, ay, twice as
  beautiful as Pericles on your medallion, with the golden curls clustering
  round a forehead as white as milk and eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Myrrhina stopped, a little at a loss for a simile, and a good deal
  out of breath besides.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Valeria, who had been listening in an attitude of languid
  attention, her eyes half closed, her lips parted, and the colour deepening on
  her cheek. "What were his eyes like, Myrrhina?"</p>

  <p>"Well, they were like the blue sky of Campania in the vintage; they were
  like the stones round the boss of your state-mantle; they were like the sea
  at noonday from the long walls of Ostia. And yet they flashed into sparks of
  fire when he looked at poor little Automedon. I wonder the boy wasn't
  frightened! I am sure I should have been; only nothing frightens those
  impudent young charioteers."</p>

  <p>"Was he my kinsman's slave; are you sure, Myrrhina?" said her mistress, in
  an accent of studied unconcern, and never moving a finger from her listless
  and comfortable attitude.</p>

  <p>"No doubt of it, madam," replied the waiting-maid; and would probably have
  continued to enlarge on the congenial subject, had she not been interrupted
  by the entrance of one of the damsels who had been summoned from the
  apartment, and returned to announce that Hippias, the retired gladiator, was
  in waiting&mdash;" Would Valeria take her fencing-lesson?"</p>

  <p>But Valeria declined at once, and sat on before her mirror, without even
  raising her eyes to the tempting picture it displayed. Whatever was the
  subject of her thoughts, it must have been very engrossing, she seemed so
  loth to be disturbed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-05"
     id="ch1-05">V</a>. &mdash; ROME</h2>

  <p class="first">MEANWHILE the British slave, unconscious that he was already
  the object of Valeria's interest and Myrrhina's admiration, was threading his
  way through the crowded streets that 'adjoined the Forum, enjoying that vague
  sense of amusement with which a man surveys a scene of bustle and confusion
  that does not affect his immediate concerns. Thanks to the favour of his
  master, his time was nearly at his own disposal, and he had ample leisure to
  observe the busiest scene in the known world, and to compare it, perhaps,
  with the peace and simplicity of those early days, which seemed now like the
  memories of a dream, so completely had they passed away. The business of the
  Forum was over: the markets were disgorging their mingled stream of
  purveyors, purchasers, and idle lookers-on. The whole population of Rome was
  hurrying home to dinner, and a motley crowd it was. The citizens themselves,
  the Plebeians, properly so called, scarcely formed one half of the swarming
  assemblage. Slaves innumerable hurried to and fro, to speed the business or
  the pleasure of their lords; slaves of every colour and of every nation, from
  the Scandinavian giant, with blue eyes and waving yellow locks, to the sturdy
  Ethiopian, thick-lipped, and woolly-haired, the swarthy child of Africa,
  whose inheritance has been servitude from the earliest ages until now. Many a
  Roman born was there, too, amongst the servile crowd, aping the appearance
  and manner of a citizen, but who shrank from a master's frown at home, and
  who, despite the acquirement of wealth, and even the attainment of power,
  must die a bondsman as he had lived.</p>

  <p>Not the least characteristic feature of the state of society under the
  Empire was the troop of freedmen that everywhere accompanied the person, and
  swelled the retinue of each powerful patrician. These manumitted slaves were
  usually bound by the ties of interest as much as gratitude to the former
  master, who had now become their patron. Dependent on him in many cases for
  their daily food, doled out to them in rations at his door, they were
  necessarily little emancipated from his authority by their lately acquired
  freedom. While the relation of patron and client was productive of crying
  evils in the Imperial City, while the former threw the shield of his powerful
  protection over the crimes of the latter, and the client in return became the
  willing pander to his patron's vices, it was the freedman who, more than all
  others, rendered himself a willing tool to his patrician employer, who
  yielded unhesitatingly time, affections, probity, and honour itself, to the
  caprices of his lord. They swarmed about the Forum now, running hither and
  thither with the obsequious haste of the parasite, bent on errands which in
  too many cases would scarce have borne the light of day.</p>

  <p>Besides these, a vast number of foreigners, wearing the costumes of their
  different countries, hindered the course of traffic as they stood gaping,
  stupefied by the confusing scene on which they gazed. The Gaul, with his
  short, close-fitting garment; the Parthian, with his conical sheepskin cap;
  the Mede, with his loose silken trousers; the Jew, barefoot and robed in
  black; the stately Spaniard, the fawning Egyptian, and amongst them all,
  winding his way wherever the crowd was closest, with perfect ease and
  self-possession, the smooth and supple Greek. When some great man passed
  through the midst, borne aloft in his litter, or leaning on the shoulder of a
  favourite slave, and freedmen and clients made a passage for him with threat,
  and push, and blow, the latter would invariably miss the Greek to light on
  the pate of a humble mechanic, or the shoulders of a sturdy barbarian, while
  the descendant of Leonidas or Alcibiades would reply in whining sing-song
  tones to the verbal abuse, with some biting retort, which was sure to turn
  the laughter of the crowd on the aggressor.</p>

  <p>If Rome had once overrun and conquered the dominions of her elder sister
  in civilisation, the invasion seemed now to be all the other way. With the
  turn of the tide had come such an overflow of Greek manners, Greek customs,
  Greek morals, and Greek artifice, that the Imperial City was already losing
  its natural characteristics; and the very language was so interlarded with
  the vocabulary of the conquered, that it was fast becoming less Latin than
  Greek. The Roman ladies, especially, delighted in those euphonious syllables,
  which clothed Athenian eloquence in such melodious rhythm; and their choicest
  terms of endearment in the language of love, were invariably whispered in
  Greek.</p>

  <p>That supple nation, too, adapting itself to the degradation of slavery and
  the indulgence of ease, as it had risen in nobler times to the exigencies of
  liberty and the efforts demanded by war, had usurped the greater portion of
  art, science, and even power, in Rome. The most talented painters and
  sculptors were Greeks. The most enterprising contractors and engineers were
  Greeks. Rhetoric and elocution could only be learned in a Greek school, and
  mathematics, unless studied with Greek letters, must be esteemed confused and
  useless; the fashionable invalid who objected to consult a Greek physician
  deserved to die; and there was but one astrologer in Rome who could cast a
  patrician horoscope. Of course he was a Greek. In the lower walks of criminal
  industry; in the many iniquitous professions called into existence by the
  luxury of a great city, the Greeks drove a thriving and almost an exclusive
  trade. Whoever was in most repute, as an evil counsellor, a low buffoon, a
  money-lender, pimp, pander, or parasite, whatever might be his other
  qualifications, was sure to be a Greek. And many a scrutinising glance was
  cast by professors of this successful nation at the Briton's manly form as he
  strode through the crowd, making his way quietly but surely from sheer weight
  and strength. They followed him with covetous eyes, as they speculated on the
  various purposes to which so much good manhood might be applied. They
  appraised him, so to speak, and took an inventory of his thews and sinews,
  his limbs, his stature, and his good looks; but they refrained from accosting
  him with importunate questions or insolent proposals, for there was a bold
  confident air about him, that bespoke the stout heart and the ready hand. The
  stamp of freedom had not yet faded from his brow, and he looked like one who
  was accustomed to take his own part in a crowd.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a stoppage in the traffic arrested the moving stream, which
  swelled in continually to a struggling, eager, vociferating mass. A dray,
  containing huge blocks of marble, and drawn by several files of oxen, had
  become entangled with the chariot of a passing patrician, and another great
  man's litter being checked by the obstruction, much confusion and bad
  language was the result. Amused with the turmoil, and in no hurry to get
  home, the British slave stood looking over the heads of the populace at the
  irritated and gesticulating antagonists, when a smart blow on the shoulder
  caused him to wheel suddenly round, prepared to return the injury with
  interest. At the same instant a powerful hand dragged him back by the tunic,
  and a grasp was laid on him, from which he could not shake himself free,
  while a rough good-humoured voice whispered in his ear&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Softly, lad, softly! Keep hands off Caesar's lictors an' thou be'st not
  mad in good earnest. These gentry give more than they take, I can promise
  thee!"</p>

  <p>The speaker was a broad powerful man of middle size, with the chest of a
  Hercules; he held the Briton firmly pinioned in his arms while he spoke, and
  it was well that he did so, for the lictors were indeed forcing a passage for
  the Emperor himself, who was proceeding on foot, and as far as was
  practicable <i>incog</i>., to inspect the fish-market.</p>

  <p>Vitellius shuffled along with the lagging step of an infirm and bloated
  old man. His face was pale and flabby, his eye dim, though sparkling at
  intervals with some little remnant of the ready wit and pliant humour that
  had made him the favourite of three emperors ere he himself attained the
  purple. Supported by two freedmen, preceded and followed only by a file of
  lictors, and attended by three or four slaves, Caesar was taking his short
  walk in hopes of acquiring some little appetite for dinner: what locality so
  favourable for the furtherance of this object as the fish-market, where the
  imperial glutton could feast his eyes, if nothing else, on the choicest
  dainties of the deep? He was so seldom seen abroad in Rome, that the Briton
  could not forbear following him with his glance, while his new friend,
  relaxing his hold with great caution, whispered once more in his
  ear&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ay, look well at him, man, and give Jove thanks thou art not an emperor.
  There's a shape for the purple! There's a head to carry a diadem! Well, well,
  for all he's so white and flabby now, like a Lucrine turbot, he could drive a
  chariot once, and hold his own at sword and buckler with the best of them.
  They say he can drink as well as ever still. Not that he was a match for Nero
  in his best days, even at that game. Ay, ay, they may talk as they will:
  we've never had an emperor like <i>him</i> before nor since. Wine, women,
  shows, sacrifices, wild-beast fights; a legion of men all engaged in the
  circus at once! Such a friend as he was to <i>our</i> trade."</p>

  <p>"And that trade?" inquired the Briton good-humouredly enough, now his
  hands were free: " I think I can guess it without asking too many
  questions."</p>

  <p>"No need to guess," replied the other. "I'm not ashamed of my trade, nor
  of my name neither. Maybe you have heard of Hirpinus, the gladiator? Tuscan
  born, free Roman citizen, and willing to match himself with any man of his
  weight, on foot or on horseback, blindfold or half-armed, in or out of a war-
  chariot, with two swords, sword and buckler, or sword or spear. Any weapon,
  and every weapon, always excepting the net and the noose. Those I can't bear
  talking about&mdash;to my mind they are not fair fighting. But what need I
  tell <i>you</i> all about it?" he added, running his eye over the slave's
  powerful frame. "I must surely have seen you before. You look as if you
  belonged to the Family* yourself!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* A technical term for a school of gladiators trained by
  the same master.]</p>

  <p>The slave smiled, not insensible to the compliment.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a manlier way of getting bread than most of the employments I see
  practised in Rome," was his reply, though he spoke more to himself than his
  companion. "A man might die a worse death than in the amphitheatre," he added
  meditatively.</p>

  <p>"A worse death!" echoed Hirpinus. "He could scarce die a better! Think of
  the rows of heads one upon another piled up like apples to the very awnings.
  Think of the patricians and senators wagering their collars and bracelets,
  and their sesterces in millions, on the strength of your arm, and the point
  of your blade. Think of your own vigour and manhood, trained till you feel as
  strong as an elephant, and as lithe as a panther, with an honest wooden
  buckler on your arm, and two feet of pliant steel in your hand, as you defile
  by Caesar and bid him 'Good-morrow, from those who have come here to die!'
  Think of the tough bout with your antagonist, foot to foot, hand to hand, eye
  to eye, feeling his blade with your own (why a swordsman, lad, can fence as
  well in the dark as the daylight!), foiling his passes, drawing his attack,
  learning his feints, watching your opportunity; when you catch it at last, in
  you dash like a wild-cat, and the guard of your sword rings sharp and true
  against his breastbone, as he goes over backwards on the sand!"</p>

  <p>"And if <i>he</i> gets the opportunity first?" asked the slave, interested
  in spite of himself at the enthusiasm which carried him irresistibly along
  with it. "If your guard is an inch too high, your return a thought too slow?
  If you go backwards on the sand, with the hilt at your breastbone, and the
  two feet of steel in your bosom? How does it feel then?" "Faith, lad, you
  must cross the Styx to have that question fairly answered," replied the
  other. "I have had no such experience yet. When it comes I shall know how to
  meet it. But this talking makes a man thirsty, and the sun is hot enough to
  bake a negro here. Come with me, lad! I know a shady nook, where we can
  pierce a skin of wine, and afterwards play a game at quoits, or have a bout
  of wrestling, to while away the afternoon."</p>

  <p>The slave was nothing loth. Besides the debt of gratitude he owed for
  preservation from a serious danger, there was something in his new friend's
  rough, good-humoured, and athletic manhood that won on the Briton's favour.
  Hirpinus, with even more than their fierce courage, had less than the usual
  brutality of his class, and possessed besides a sort of quaint and careless
  good-humour, by no means rare among the athletes of every time, which found
  its way at once to the natural sympathies of the slave. They started off
  accordingly, on the most amicable terms, in search of that refreshment which
  a few hours' exposure to an Italian sun rendered very desirable; but the
  crowd had not yet cleared off, and their progress was necessarily somewhat
  slow, notwithstanding that the throng of passengers gave way readily enough
  before two such stalwart and athletic forms.</p>

  <p>Hirpinus thought it incumbent on him to take the Briton, as it were, under
  his protection, and to point out to him the different objects of interest,
  and the important personages, to be seen at that hour in the streets of the
  capital, totally irrespective of the fact that his pupil was as well
  instructed on these points as himself. But the gladiator dearly loved a
  listener, and, truth to tell, was extremely diffuse in his narratives when he
  had got one to his mind. These generally turned on his own physical prowess,
  and his deadly exploits in the amphitheatre, which he was by no means
  disposed to underrate. There are some really brave men who are also boasters,
  and Hirpinus was one of them.</p>

  <p>He was in the midst of a long dissertation on the beauties of an encounter
  fought out between naked combatants, armed only with the sword, and was
  explaining at great length a certain fatal thrust outside his antagonist's
  guard, and over his elbow, which he affirmed to be his own invention, and
  irresistible by any party yet discovered, when the slave felt his gown
  plucked by a female hand, and turning sharply round was somewhat disconcerted
  to find himself face to face with Valeria's waiting-maid.</p>

  <p>"You are wanted," said she unceremoniously, and with an imperious gesture.
  "You are to come to my lady this instant. Make haste, man; she cannot brook
  waiting."</p>

  <p>Myrrhina pointed while she spoke to where a closed litter borne aloft by
  four tall Liburnian slaves, had stopped the traffic, and already become the
  nucleus of a crowd. A white hand peeped through its curtains, as the slave
  approached, surprised and somewhat abashed at this unexpected appeal.
  Hirpinus looked on with grave approval the while. Arriving close beneath the
  litter, of which the curtain was now open, the slave paused and made a
  graceful obeisance; then, drawing himself up proudly, stood erect before it,
  looking unconsciously his best, in the pride of his youth and beauty.
  Valeria's cheek was paler than usual, and her attitude more languid, but her
  grey eyes sparkled, and a smile played round her mouth as she addressed
  him.</p>

  <p>"Myrrhina tells me that you are the man who brought a basket of flowers to
  my house this morning from Licinius. Why did you not wait to carry back my
  salutations to my kinsman?"</p>

  <p>The colour mounted to the slave's brow as he thought of Automedon's
  insolence, but he only replied humbly. "Had I known it was your wish, lady, I
  had been standing in your porch till now."</p>

  <p>She marked his rising colour, and attributed it to the effect of her own
  dazzling beauty.</p>

  <p>"Myrrhina knew you at once in the crowd," said she graciously; "and indeed
  yours is a face and figure not easily mistaken in Rome. I should recognise
  you myself anywhere now."</p>

  <p>She paused, expecting a suitable reply, but the slave, albeit not
  insensible to the compliment, only blushed again and was silent. Valeria,
  meanwhile, whose motives in summoning him to her litter had been in the first
  instance of simple curiosity to see the stalwart barbarian who had so excited
  Myrrhina's admiration, and whom that sharp-sighted damsel had recognised in
  an instant amongst the populace, now found herself pleased and interested by
  the quiet demeanour and noble bearing of this foreign slave. She had always
  been susceptible to manly beauty, and here she beheld it in its noblest type.
  She was rapacious of admiration in all quarters; and here she could not but
  flatter herself she gathered an undoubted tribute to the power of her charms.
  She owned all a woman's interest in anything that had a spice of mystery or
  romance, and a woman's unfailing instinct in discovering high birth and
  gentle breeding under every disguise; and here she found a delightful puzzle
  in the manner and appearance of her kinsman's messenger, whose position
  seemed so at variance with his looks. She had never in her life laid the
  slightest restraint on her thoughts, and but little on her actions&mdash;she
  had never left a purpose unfulfilled, nor a wish ungratified&mdash;but a
  strange and new feeling, at which even her courageous nature quailed, seemed
  springing up in her heart while she gazed with half-closed eyes at the
  Briton, and hesitated to confess, even to herself, that she had never seen
  such a man as this in her life before. It was in a softened tone that she
  again addressed him, moving on her couch to show an ivory shoulder and a
  rounded arm to the best advantage.</p>

  <p>"You are a confidential servant of my kinsman's? You are attached to his
  person, and always to be found in his household?" she asked, more with a view
  of detaining him than for any fixed purpose.</p>

  <p>"I would give my life for Licinius!" was the prompt and spirited
  reply.</p>

  <p>"But you are gentle born," she resumed, with increasing interest; "how
  came you in your present dress, your present station? Licinius has never
  mentioned you to me. I do not even know your name. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Esca," answered the slave proudly, and looking the while anything but a
  slave.</p>

  <p>"Esca!" she repeated, dwelling on the syllables, with a slow soft cadence;
  "Esca! 'Tis none of our Latin names; but that I might have known already. Who
  and what are you?"</p>

  <p>There was something of defiance in the melancholy tone with which he
  answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"A prince in my own country, and a chief of ten thousand. A barbarian and
  a slave in Rome."</p>

  <p>She gave him her hand to kiss, with a gesture of pity that was almost a
  caress, and then, as though ashamed of her own condescension, bade the
  Liburnians angrily to " go on."</p>

  <p>Esca looked long and wistfully after the litter as it disappeared; but
  Hirpinus, clapping him on the back with his heavy hand, burst into a hearty
  laugh while he declared</p>

  <p>"'Tis a clear case, comrade. 'Came, saw, and conquered,' as the great
  soldier said. I have known it a hundred times, but always to men of muscle
  like thee and me. By Castor and Pollux! lad, thou art in luck. Ay, ay, 'tis
  always so. She takes thee for a gladiator, and they'll look at nothing but a
  gladiator now. Come on, brother; we'll drink a cup to every letter of her
  name!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-06"
     id="ch1-06">VI</a>. &mdash; THE WORSHIP OF ISIS</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was the cool and calming hour of sunset. Esca was
  strolling quietly homewards after the pursuits of the day. He had emptied a
  wineskin with Hirpinus; and, resisting that worthy's entreaties to mark so
  auspicious a meeting by a debauch, had accompanied him to the gymnasium,
  where the Briton's magnificent strength and prowess raised him higher than
  ever in the opinion of the experienced athlete. Untiring as were the trained
  muscles of the professional, he found himself unable to cope with the
  barbarian in such exercises as demanded chiefly untaught physical power and
  length of limb. In running, leaping, and wrestling, Esca was more than a
  match for the gladiator. In hurling the quoit, and fencing with wooden foils,
  the latter's constant practice gave him the advantage, and when he fastened
  round his wrists and hands the leathern thong or <i>cestus</i>, used for the
  same purpose as our modern boxing-glove, and proposed a round or two of that
  manly exercise to conclude with, he little doubted that his own science and
  experience would afford him an easy victory. The result, however, was far
  different from his expectations. His antagonist's powers were especially
  adapted to this particular kind of contest; his length of limb, his quickness
  of eye, hand, and foot, his youthful elasticity of muscle, and his unfailing
  wind, rendered him an invincible combatant, and it was with something like
  pique that Hirpinus was compelled to confess as much to himself.</p>

  <p>At the end of the first round he was satisfied of his mistake in
  underrating so formidable an opponent. Ere the second was half through, he
  had exhausted all the resources of his own skill without gaining the
  slightest advantage over his antagonist; and with the conclusion of a third,
  he flung away the <i>cestus</i> in well-feigned disgust at the heat of the
  weather, and proposed one more skin of wine before parting, to drink success
  to the profession, and speedy employment for the gladiators at the
  approaching games in the amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>"Join us, man!" said Hirpinus, dropping something of the patronising air
  he had before affected. "Thou wert born to be a swordsman. Hippias would
  teach thee in a week to hold thine own against the best fencers in Rome. I
  myself will look to thy food, thy training, and thy private practice. Thou
  wouldst gain thy liberty easily, after a few victories. Think it over, man!
  and when thou hast decided, come to the fencing-school yonder, and ask for
  old Hirpinus. The steel may have a speck of rust on it, but it's tough and
  true still; so fare thee well, lad. I count to hear from thee again before
  long!"</p>

  <p>The gladiator accordingly rolled off with more than his usual assumption
  of manly independence, attributable to the measure of rough Sabine wine of
  which he had drunk his full share, whilst the Briton walked quietly away in
  the direction of his home, enjoying the cool breeze that fanned his brow, and
  following out a train of vague and complicated reflections, originating in
  the advice of his late companion.</p>

  <p>The crimson glow of a summer evening had faded into the serene beauty of a
  summer night. Stars were flashing out, one by one, with mellow lustre, not
  glimmering faintly, as in our northern climate, but hanging like silver
  lamps, in the infinity of the sky. The busy turmoil of the streets had
  subsided to a low and drowsy hum; the few chance passengers who still paced
  them, went softly and at leisure, as though enjoying the soothing influence
  of the hour. Even here, in the great city, everything seemed to breathe of
  peace, and contentment, and repose. Esca walked slowly on, lost in
  meditation.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the clash of cymbals and the sound of voices struck upon his
  ear. A wild and fitful melody, rising and falling with strange thrilling
  cadence, was borne upon the breeze. Even while he stopped to listen, it
  swelled into a full harmonious chorus, and he recognised the chant of the
  worshippers of Isis, returning from the unholy celebration of her rites. Soon
  the glare of torches heralded its approach, and the tumultuous procession
  wound round the corner of the street with all the strange grotesque
  ceremonies of their order. Clashing their cymbals, dashing their torches
  together till the sparks flew up in showers, tossing their bare arms aloft
  with frantic gestures, the smooth-faced priests, having girt their linen
  garments tightly round their loins, were dancing to and fro before the image
  of the goddess with bacchanalian energy.</p>

  <p>Some were bareheaded, some crowned with garlands of the lotus-leaf, and
  some wore masks representing the heads of dogs and other animals; but all,
  though leaping wildly here and there, danced in the same step, all used the
  same mysterious gestures of which the meaning was only known to the
  initiated. The figure of the goddess herself was borne aloft on the shoulders
  of two sturdy priests, fat, oily, smooth, and sensual, with the odious look
  of their kind. It represented a stately woman crowned with the lotus, holding
  a four-barred lyre in her hand. Gold and silver tinsel was freely scattered
  over her flowing garments, and jewels of considerable value, the gifts of
  unusually fervent devotees, might be observed upon her bosom and around her
  neck and arms. Behind her were carried the different symbols by which her
  qualities were supposed to be typified; amongst these an image of the sacred
  cow, wrought in frosted silver with horns and hoofs of gold, showed the most
  conspicuous, borne aloft as it was by an acolyte in the wildest stage of
  inebriety, and wavering, with the uncertain movements of its bearer, over the
  heads of the throng. In the van moved the priests, bloated eunuchs clad in
  white; behind these came the sacred images carried by younger votaries, who,
  aspiring to the sacerdotal office, and already prepared for its functions,
  devoted themselves assiduously in the meantime to the orgies with which it
  was their custom to celebrate the worship of their deity. Maddened with wine,
  bare-limbed and with dishevelled locks, they danced frantically to and fro,
  darting at intervals from their ranks, and compelling the passengers whom
  they met to turn behind them, and help to swell the rear of the procession.
  This was formed of a motley crew. Rich and poor, old and young, the proud
  patrician and the squalid slave, were mingled together in turbulent
  confusion; it was difficult to distinguish those who formed a part of the
  original pageant from the idlers who had attached themselves to it, and,
  having caught the contagious excitement, vociferated as loudly, and leaped
  about as wildly, as the initiated themselves. Amongst these might be seen
  some of the fairest and proudest faces in Rome. Noble matrons reared in
  luxury, under the very busts of those illustrious ancestors who had been
  counsellors of kings, defenders of the commonwealth, senators of the empire,
  thought it no shame to be seen reeling about the public streets, unveiled and
  flushed with wine, in the company of the most notorious and profligate of
  their sex. A multitude of torches shed their glare on the upturned faces of
  the throng, and on one that looked, with its scornful lips and defiant brow,
  to have no business there.</p>

  <p>Amongst the wildest of these revellers, Valeria's haughty head moved on,
  towering above the companions, with whom she seemed to have nothing in
  common, save a fierce determination to set modesty and propriety at defiance.
  Esca caught her glance as she swept by. She blushed crimson, he observed even
  in the torchlight, and seemed for an instant to shrink behind the portly form
  of a priest who marched at her side; but, immediately recovering herself,
  moved on with a gradually paling cheek, and a haughtier step than before.</p>

  <p>He had little leisure, however, to observe the scornful beauty, whose
  charms, to tell the truth, had made no slight impression on his imagination;
  for a disturbance at its head, which had now passed him some distance, had
  stopped the progress of the whole procession, and no small confusion was the
  result. The torch-bearers were hurrying to the front. The silver cow had
  fallen and been replaced in an upright position more than once. The goddess
  herself had nearly shared the same fate. The sacred chant had ceased, and
  instead a hundred tongues were vociferating at once, some in anger, some in
  expostulation, some in maudlin ribaldry and mirth. "Let her go!" cried one.
  "Hold her fast!" shouted another. "Bring her along with you!" reasoned a
  drunken acolyte. "If she be worthy she will conform to the worship of the
  goddess. If she be unworthy she shall experience the divine wrath of Isis!" "
  Mind what you are about," interposed a more cautious votary. "She is a Roman
  maiden," said one. "She's a barbarian!" shrieked another. "A Mede!" "A
  Spaniard!" "A Persian!" "A Jewess! A Jewess!"</p>

  <p>In the meantime the unfortunate cause of all this turmoil, a young girl
  closely veiled and dressed in black, was struggling in the arms of a large
  unwieldy eunuch, who had seized her as a hawk pounces on a pigeon, and
  despite her agonised entreaties, for the poor thing was in mortal fear, held
  her ruthlessly in his grasp. She had been surrounded by the lawless band, ere
  she was aware, as she glided quietly round the street corner, on her homeward
  way, had shrunk up against the wall in the desperate hope that she might
  remain unobserved or unmolested, and found herself, as was to be expected, an
  immediate object of insult to the dissolute and licentious crew. Though her
  dress was torn and her arms bruised from the unmanly violence to which she
  was subjected, with true feminine modesty she kept her veil closely drawn
  round her face, and resisted every effort for its removal, with a firm
  strength of which those slender wrists seemed hardly capable. As the eunuch
  grasped her with drunken violence, bending his huge body and bloated face
  over the shrinking figure of the girl, she could not suppress one piercing
  shriek for help, though, even while it left her lips, she felt how futile it
  must be, and how utterly hopeless was her situation. It was echoed by a
  hundred voices in tones of mockery and derision.</p>

  <p>Little did Spado, for such was the eunuch's name, little did Spado think
  how near was the aid for which his victim called; how sudden would be the
  reprisals that should astonish himself with their prompt and complete
  redress, reminding him of what he had long forgotten, the strength of a man's
  blow, and the weight of a man's arm. At the first sound of the girl's voice,
  Esca had forced his way through the crowd to her assistance. In three strides
  he had come up with her assailant, and laid his heavy grasp on Spado's fat
  shoulder, while he bade him in low determined accents to release his prey.
  The eunuch smiled insolently, and replied with a brutal jest.</p>

  <p>Valeria, interested in spite of herself, could not resist an impulse to
  press forward and see what was going on. Long afterwards she delighted to
  recall the scene she now beheld with far more of exultation and excitement
  than alarm. It had, indeed, especial attraction for an imagination like hers.
  Standing out in the red glare of the torches, like the bronze statue of some
  demigod starting into life, towered the tall figure of Esca, defiance in his
  attitude, anger on his brow, and resistless strength in the quivering outline
  of each sculptured limb. Within arm's length of him, the obese, ungraceful
  shape of Spado, with his broad fat face, expressive chiefly of gluttony and
  sensual enjoyment, but wearing now an ugly look of malice and apprehension.
  Starting back from his odious embrace to the utmost length of her
  outstretched arms, the veiled form of the frightened girl, her head turned
  from the eunuch, her hands pressed against his chest, every line of her
  figure denoting the extreme of horror, and aversion, and disgust. Round the
  three, a shifting mass of grinning faces, and tossing arms, and wild
  bacchanalian gestures; the whole rendered more grotesque and unnatural by the
  lurid, flickering light. With an unaccountable fascination Valeria watched
  for the result.</p>

  <p>"Let her go!" repeated Esca, in the distinct accents with which a man
  speaks who is about to strike, tightening at the same time a gripe which went
  into the eunuch's soft flesh like iron.</p>

  <p>Spado howled in mingled rage and fear, but released the girl nevertheless,
  who cowered instinctively close to her protector.</p>

  <p>"Help!" shouted the eunuch, looking round for assistance from his
  comrades. "Help! I say. Will ye see the priest mishandled and the goddess
  reviled? Down with him! down with him, comrades, and keep him down!"</p>

  <p>There is little doubt that had Esca's head once touched the ground it had
  never risen again, for the priests were crowding about him with wild yells
  and savage eyes, and the fierce revelry of a while ago was fast warming into
  a thirst for blood. Valeria thrust her way into the circle, though she never
  feared for the Briton&mdash;not for an instant.</p>

  <p>It was getting dangerous, though, to remain any longer amongst this
  frantic crew. Esca wound one arm round the girl's waist and opposed the other
  shoulder to the throng. Spado, encouraged by his comrades, struck wildly at
  the Briton, and made a furious effort to recover his prey. Esca drew himself
  together like a panther about to spring, then his long sinewy arm flew out
  with the force and impulse of a catapult, and the eunuch, reeling backwards,
  fell heavily to the ground, with a gash upon his cheek like the wound
  inflicted by a sword.</p>

  <p>"<i>Euge</i>!" exclaimed Valeria, in a thrill of admiration and delight.
  "Well struck, by Hercules! Ah! these barbarians have at least the free use of
  their limbs. Why, the priest went down like a white ox at the Mucian Gate. Is
  he much hurt, think ye? Will he rise again?"</p>

  <p>The last sentence was addressed to the throng who now crowded round the
  prostrate Spado, and was but the result of that pity which is never quite
  dormant in a woman's breast. The fallen eunuch seemed indeed in no hurry to
  get upon his legs again. He rolled about in hideous discomfiture, and gave
  vent to his feelings in loud and pitiful moans and lamentations.</p>

  <p>After such an example of the Briton's prowess, none of her other votaries
  seemed to think it incumbent on them to vindicate the majesty of the goddess
  by further interference with the maiden and her protector. Supporting and
  almost carrying her drooping form, Esca hurried her away with swift firm
  strides, pausing and looking back at intervals, as though loth to leave his
  work half finished, and by no means unwilling to renew the contest. The last
  Valeria saw of him was the turn of his noble head bending down with a
  courteous and protecting gesture, to console and reassure his frightened
  charge. All her womanly instincts revolted at that moment from the odious
  throng with whom she was involved. She could have found it in her heart to
  envy that obscure and unknown girl hurrying away yonder through the darkening
  streets on the arm of her powerful protector&mdash;could have wished herself
  a peasant or a slave, with some one being in the world to look up to, and to
  love.</p>

  <p>Valeria's life had been that of a spoiled child from the day she left her
  cradle&mdash;that gilded cradle over which the nurses had repeated their
  customary Roman blessing with an emphasis that in her case seemed to be
  prophetic&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"May monarchs woo thee, darling! to their bed,<br>
  And roses blossom where thy footsteps tread!"</p>

  <p>The metaphorical flowers of wealth, prosperity, and admiration, did indeed
  seem to spring up beneath her feet, and her stately beauty would have done no
  discredit to an imperial bride; but it must have been something more than
  outward pomp and show&mdash;something nobler than the purple and the diadem
  &mdash;that could have won its way to Valeria's heart.</p>

  <p>She was habituated to the beautiful, the costly, the refined, till she had
  learned to consider such qualities as the mere essentials of life. It seemed
  to her a simple matter of course that houses should be noble, and chariots
  luxurious, and horses swift, and men brave. The <i>nil admirari</i> was the
  maxim of the class in which she lived; and whilst their standard was thus
  placed at the superlative, that which came up to it received no credit for
  excellence, that which fell short was treated with disapproval and contempt.
  Valeria's life had been one constant round of pleasure and amusement; yet she
  was not happy, not even contented. Day by day she felt the want of some fresh
  interest, some fresh excitement; and it was this craving probably, more than
  innate depravity, which drove her, in common with many of her companions,
  into such disgraceful scenes as were enacted at the worship of Juno, Isis,
  and the other gods and goddesses of mythology.</p>

  <p>Lovers, it is needless to say, Valeria had won in plenty. Each new face
  possessed for her but the attraction of its novelty. The favourite of the
  hour had small cause to plume himself on his position. For the first week he
  interested her curiosity, for the second he pleased her fancy, after which,
  if he was wise, he took his leave gracefully, ere he was bidden to do so with
  a frankness that admitted of no misconception. Perhaps the only person in the
  world whom she respected was her kinsman Licinius; and this, none the less,
  that she possessed no kind of influence over his feelings or his opinions;
  that she well knew he viewed her proceedings often with disapprobation, and
  entertained for her character a kindly pity not far removed from contempt.
  Even Julius Placidus, who was the most persevering, as he was the craftiest,
  of her adorers, had made no impression on her heart. She appreciated his
  intellect, she was amused with his conversation, she approved of his deep
  schemes, his lavish extravagance, his unprincipled recklessness; but she
  never thought of him for an instant after he was out of her sight, and there
  was something in the cold-blooded ferocity of his character from which, even
  in his presence, she unconsciously recoiled. Perhaps she admired the person
  of Hippias, her fencing-master, a retired gladiator, who combined handsome
  regularity of features with a certain worn and warlike air, not without its
  charm, more than that of any man whom she had yet seen, and with all her
  pride and her cold exterior, Valeria was a woman to be captivated by the eye;
  but Hippias, from his professional reputation, was the darling of half the
  matrons in Rome, and it may be that she only followed the example of her
  friends, with whom, at this period of the Empire, it was considered a proof
  of the highest fashion, and the best taste, to be in love with a
  gladiator.</p>

  <p>Strong in her passions, as in her physical organisation, the former were
  only bridled by an unbending pride, and an intensity of will more than
  masculine in its resolution. As under that smooth skin the muscles of the
  round white arm were firm and hard like marble, so beneath that fair and
  tranquil bosom there beat a heart that for good or evil could dare, endure,
  and defy the worst. Valeria was a woman whom none but a very bold or very
  ignorant suitor would have taken to his breast; yet it may be that the right
  man could have tamed, and made her gentle and patient as the dove. And now
  something seemed to tell her that the void in her heart was filled at last.
  Esca's manly beauty had made a strong impression on her senses; the anomaly
  of his position had captivated her imagination; there was something very
  attractive in the mystery that surrounded him; there was even a wild thrill
  of pleasure in the shame of loving a slave. Then, when he stood forth, the
  champion of that poor helpless girl, brave, handsome, and victorious, the
  charm was complete; and Valeria's eyes followed him as he disappeared with a
  longing loving look, that had never glistened in them in her life before.</p>

  <p>The Briton hurried away with his arm round the drooping figure of his
  companion, and for a time forbore to speak a word even of encouragement or
  consolation. At first the reaction of her feelings turned her sick and faint,
  then a burst of weeping came to her relief; ere long the tears were flowing
  silently; and the girl, who indeed showed no lack of courage, had recovered
  herself sufficiently to look up in her protector's face, and pour out her
  thanks with a quiet earnestness that showed they came direct from the
  heart.</p>

  <p>"I can trust you," she said, in a voice of peculiar sweetness, though her
  Latin, like his own, was touched with a slightly foreign accent. "I can read
  a brave man's face&mdash;none better. We have not far to go now. You will
  take me safe home?"</p>

  <p>"I will guard you to your very door," said he, in tones of the deepest
  respect. "But you need fear nothing now; the drunken priests and their
  mysterious deity are far enough off by this time. 'Tis a noble worship,
  truly, for such a city as this&mdash;the mistress of the world!"</p>

  <p>"False gods! false gods!" replied the girl, very earnestly. "Oh! how can
  men be so blind, so degraded?" Here she stopped suddenly, and clung closer to
  her companion's arm, drawing her veil tighter round her face the while. Her
  quick ear had caught the sound of hurrying footsteps, and she dreaded
  pursuit.</p>

  <p>"'Tis nothing," said Esca, encouraging her; "the most we have to dread now
  is some drunken freedman or client reeling home from his patron's supper-
  table. They are a weakly race, these Roman citizens," he added
  good-humouredly; "I think I can promise to stave them off if they come not
  more than a dozen at a time."</p>

  <p>The cheerful tone reassured her no less than the strong arm to which she
  clung. It was delightful to feel so safe after the fright she had undergone.
  The footsteps were indeed those of a few dissolute idlers loitering home
  after a debauch. They had hastened forward on espying a female figure; but
  there was something in the air of her protector that forbade a near approach,
  and they shrank to the other side of the way rather than come in contact with
  so powerful an opponent. The girl felt proud of her escort, and safer every
  minute. By this time she had guided him into a dark and narrow street, at the
  end of which the Tiber might be seen gleaming under the starlit sky. She
  stopped at a mean-looking door, let into a dead-wall, and applying her hand
  to a secret spring, it opened noiselessly to her touch. Then she turned to
  face her companion, and said frankly, "I have not thanked you half enough.
  Will you not enter our poor dwelling, and share with us a morsel of food and
  a cup of wine, ere you depart upon your way?"</p>

  <p>Esca was neither hungry nor thirsty, yet he bowed his head, and followed
  her into the house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-07"
     id="ch1-07">VII</a>. &mdash; TRUTH</h2>

  <p class="first">THE dwelling in which the Briton now found himself presented
  a strange contrast of simplicity and splendour, of wealth and frugality, of
  obscure poverty and costly refinement. The wall was bare and weather-stained;
  but a silver lamp, burning perfumed oil, was fixed against its surface on a
  bracket of common deal. Though the stone floor was damp and broken, it was
  partially covered by a soft thick carpet of brilliant colours, while shawls
  from the richest looms of Asia hung over the mutilated wooden seats and the
  crazy couch, which appeared to be the congenial furniture of the apartment.
  Esca could not but remark on the same inconsistency throughout all the minor
  details of the household. A measure of rich wine from the Lebanon was cooling
  in a pitcher of coarse earthenware, a draught of fair water sparkled in a cup
  of gold. A bundle of Eastern javelins, inlaid with ivory and of beautiful
  finish and workmanship, kept guard, as it were, over a plain two-edged sword
  devoid of ornament, and with a handle frayed and worn as though from constant
  use, that looked like a weapon born for work not show, some rough soldier's
  rude but trusty friend. The room of which Esca thus caught a hasty glance as
  he passed through, opened on an inner apartment, which seemed to have been
  originally equally bare and dilapidated, but of which the furniture was even
  more rich and incongruous. It was flooded by a soft warm light, shed from a
  lamp burning some rare Syrian oil, that was scarcely to be procured for money
  in Rome. It dazzled Esca's eyes as he followed the girl through the outer
  apartment into this retreat, and it was a few seconds ere he recovered his
  sight sufficiently to take note of the objects that surrounded him.</p>

  <p>A venerable man with bald head and long silvery beard was sitting at the
  table when they entered, reading from a roll of parchment filled to the very
  margin with characters in the Syriac language, then generally spoken over the
  whole of Asia Minor, and sufficiently familiar at Rome. So immersed was he in
  his studies, that he did not seem to notice her arrival, till the girl rushed
  up] to him, and, without unveiling, threw herself into his arms with many
  expressions of endearment and delight at her own return. The language in
  which she spoke was unknown to the Briton; but he gathered from her gestures,
  and the agitation which again overcame her for an instant, that she was
  relating her own troubles, and the part he had himself borne in the
  adventures of the night. Presently she turned, and drew him forward, while
  she said in Latin, with a little sob of agitation between every
  sentence&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Behold my preserver&mdash;the youth who came in like a lion to save me
  from those wicked men! Thank him in my father's name, and yours, and all my
  kindred and all my tribe. Bid him welcome to the best our house affords. It
  is not every day a daughter of Judah meets with an arm and a heart like his,
  when she falls into the grasp of the heathen and the oppressor!"</p>

  <p>The old man stretched his hand to Esca with cordiality and goodwill; as he
  did so, the Briton could not but observe how kindly was the smile that
  mantled over his serene and gentle face.</p>

  <p>"My brother will be home ere long," said he. "and will himself thank you
  for preserving his daughter from insult and worse. Meantime Calchas bids you
  heartily welcome to Eleazar's house. Mariamne," he added, turning to the
  girl. "prepare us a morsel of food that we may eat. It is not the custom of
  our nation to send a stranger fasting from the door."</p>

  <p>The girl departed on her hospitable mission, and Esca, making light of his
  prowess, and of the danger incurred, gave his own version of the night's
  occurrence, to which Calchas listened with grave interest and approval. When
  he had concluded, the old man pointed to the scroll he had been reading,
  which now lay rolled up on the table at his hand.</p>

  <p>"The time will come," said he. "when the words that are written here shall
  be in the mouths of all men on the surface of the known earth. Then shall
  there be no more strife, nor oppression, nor suffering, nor sorrow. Then
  shall men love each other like brothers, and live only in kindliness and
  goodwill. The day may seem far distant, and the means may seem poor and
  inadequate now, yet so it is written here, and so will it be at last."</p>

  <p>"You think that Rome will extend her dominions farther and farther? That
  she will conquer all known nations, as she has conquered us? That she means
  to be in fact what she proudly styles herself, the Mistress of the World? In
  truth, the eagle's wings are wide and strong. His beak is very sharp, and
  where his talons have once fastened themselves, they never again let go their
  hold!"</p>

  <p>Calchas smiled and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The dove will prevail against the eagle, as love is a stronger power than
  hate. But it is not of Rome I speak as the future influence that shall
  establish the great good on earth. The legions are indeed well trained, and
  brave even to the death; but I know of soldiers in a better service than
  Caesar's, whose warfare is harder, whose watches are longer, whose
  adversaries are more numerous, but whose triumph is more certain, and more
  glorious at the last."</p>

  <p>Esca looked as if he understood him not. The Briton's thoughts were
  wandering back to the tramp of columns and the clash of steel, and the
  gallant stand made against the invader by the white-robed warriors with their
  long swords, amongst whom he had been one of the boldest and the best.</p>

  <p>"It is hard to strive against Rome," said he, with a glowing cheek and
  sparkling eye. "Yet I cannot but think, if we had never been provoked to an
  attack, if we had kept steadily on the defensive, if we had moved inland as
  he approached, harassing and cutting him off whenever we saw an opportunity,
  but never suffering him to make one for himself&mdash;trusting more to our
  woods and rivers, and less to our own right hands we might have tamed the
  eagle and clipped his wings, and beat him back across the sea at last. But
  what have I to do with such matters now?" he added, while his whole
  countenance fell in bitter humiliation. "I, a poor barbarian captive, and a
  slave here in Rome!"</p>

  <p>Calchas studied his face with a keen scrutinising glance, then he laid his
  hand on the young man's shoulder, and said inquiringly</p>

  <p>"There is not a grey hair in your clustering locks, nor a wrinkle on your
  brow, yet you have known sorrow?"</p>

  <p>"Who has not?" replied the other cheerfully; "and yet I never thought to
  have come to this."</p>

  <p>"You are a slave, and you would be free?" asked Calchas, slowly and
  impressively.</p>

  <p>"I am a slave," repeated the Briton. "and I shall be free. But not till
  death."</p>

  <p>"And after death?" proceeded the old man, in the same gentle inquiring
  tone.</p>

  <p>"After death," answered the other. "I shall be free as the elements I have
  been taught to worship, and into which they tell me I shall be resolved. What
  need I know or care more than that in death there will be neither pleasure
  nor pain?"</p>

  <p>"And is not life with all its changes too sweet to lose on such terms as
  these?" asked the older man. "Are you content to believe that, like one
  walking through a quicksand, the footsteps you leave are filled up and
  obliterated behind you as you pass on? Can you bear to think that yesterday
  is indeed banished and gone for ever? That a to-morrow must come of black and
  endless night? Death should be really terrible if this is your conviction and
  your creed!"</p>

  <p>"Death is never terrible to a brave man," answered Esca. "A Briton need
  not be taught how to die sword in hand."</p>

  <p>"You think you are brave," said Calchas, looking wistfully on the other's
  rising colour and kindling eyes. "Ah! you have not seen my comrades die, or
  you would know that something better than courage is required for the service
  to which we belong. What think ye of weak women, tender shrinking maidens,
  worn with fatigue, emaciated with hunger, fainting with heat and thirst,
  brought out to be devoured by beasts, or to suffer long and agonising
  tortures, yet smiling the while in quiet calm contentment, as seeing the home
  to which they are hastening, the triumph but a few short hours off? What
  think ye of the captains under whom I served, who here at Rome, in the face
  of Caesar and his power, vindicated the honour of their Lord and died without
  a murmur for His cause? I was with Peter, I tell you, Peter the Galilean, of
  whom men talk to this day, of whom men shall never cease to talk in after
  ages, when he opposed to Simon's magic arts his simple faith in the Master
  whom he served, and I saw the magician hurled like a stricken vulture to the
  ground. I was present when the fiercest and the wickedest of the Caesars,
  returning from the expedition to Greece, wherein his buffooneries had earned
  the contempt even of that subtle nation of flatterers, sentenced him to death
  upon the cross for that he had dared to oppose Nero's vices, and to tell Nero
  the truth. I heard him petition that he might be crucified with his head
  downward, as not worthy to suffer in the same posture as his Lord and I can
  see him now, the pale face, the noble head, the dark keen eye, the slender
  sinewy form, and, above all, the self-sustaining confidence, the triumphant
  daring of the man as he walked fearlessly to death. I was with Paul, the
  noble Pharisee, the naturalised Roman citizen, when he, alone amongst a crowd
  of passengers and a century of soldiers, quailed not to look on the black
  waves raging round our broken ship, and bade us all be of good cheer, for
  that every soul, to the number of two hundred and seventy-five, should come
  safe to shore. I remember how trustfully we looked on that low spare form,
  that grave and gracious face with its kindly eyes, its bushy brows and thick
  beard sprinkled here and there with grey. It was the soul, we knew, that
  sustained and strengthened the weakly body of the man. The very barbarians
  where we landed acknowledged its influence, and would fain have worshipped
  him for a god. Nero might well fear that quiet, humble, trusting, yet
  energetic nature; and where the imperial monster feared, as where he admired,
  loved, hated, envied, or despised, the sentiment must be quenched in
  blood."</p>

  <p>"And did he too fall a victim?" inquired Esca, whose interest,
  notwithstanding occasional glances at the door through which Mariamne had
  gone out, seemed thoroughly awakened by the old man's narrative.</p>

  <p>"They might not crucify him," answered Calchas. "for he was of noble
  lineage and a Roman citizen born; but they took him from amongst us, and they
  let him languish in a prison, till they released him at last and brought him
  out to be beheaded. Ay, Rome was a fearful sight that day; the foot was
  scorched as it trod the ashes of the devastated city, the eye smarted in the
  lurid smoke that hung like a pall upon the heavy air and would not pass away.
  Palaces were crumbling in ruins, the shrivelled spoils of an empire were
  blackening around, the dead were lying in the choked-up highways half-
  festering, half-consumed&mdash;orphan children were wandering about starved
  and shivering, with sallow faces and large shining eyes, or, worse still,
  playing thoughtlessly, unconscious of their doom. They said the Christians
  had set fire to the city, and many an innocent victim suffered for this foul
  and groundless slander. The Christians, forsooth! oppressed, persecuted,
  reviled; whose only desire was to live in brotherhood with all men, whose
  very creed is peace and goodwill on earth. I counted twenty of them, men,
  women, and children, neighbours with whom I had held kindly fellowship,
  friends with whom I had broken bread, lying stiff and cold in the Flaminian
  Way on the morning Paul was led out to die. But there was peace on the dead
  faces, and the rigid hands were clasped in prayer; and though the lacerated
  emaciated body, the mere shell, was grovelling there in the dust, the spirit
  had gone home to God who made it, to the other world of which you have not so
  much as heard, yet which you too must some day visit, to remain for ever. Do
  you understand me? not for ages, but <i>for ever</i>&mdash;without end!"</p>

  <p>"Where is it?" asked Esca, on whom the idea of a spiritual existence,
  innate from its very organisation in every intelligent being, did not now
  dawn for the first time. "Is it here, or there? below, or above? in the
  stars, or the elements? I know the world in which I live; I can see it, can
  hear it, can feel it; but that other world, where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Where is it?" repeated Calchas. "Where are the dearest wishes of your
  heart, the noblest thoughts of your mind? Where are your loves, your hopes,
  your affections, above all, your memories? Where is the whole better part of
  your nature? your remorse for evil, your aspirations after good, your
  speculations on the future, your convictions of the reality of the past?
  Where these are, there is that other world. You cannot see it, you cannot
  hear it, yet you know that it must be. Is any man's happiness complete? is
  any man's misery when it reaches him so overwhelming as it seemed at a
  distance? And why is it not? Because something tells him that the present
  life is but a small segment in the complete circle of a soul's existence. And
  the circle, you have not lived in Rome without learning, is the symbol of
  infinity."</p>

  <p>Esca pondered and was silent. There are convictions which men hold
  unconsciously, and to which they are so accustomed that their attention can
  only be directed to them from without, just as they wear their skins and
  scarcely know it, till the familiar covering has been lacerated by injury or
  disease. At last he looked up with a brightening countenance, and exclaimed.
  "In that world, surely, all men will be free!"</p>

  <p>"All men will be equal," replied Calchas. "but no mortal or immortal ever
  can be free. Suppose a being totally divested of all necessity for effort,
  all responsibility to his fellows or himself, all participation in the great
  scheme of which government is the essential condition in its every part, and
  you suppose one whose own feelings would be an intolerable burden, whose own
  wishes would be an unendurable torture. Man is made to bear a yoke; but the
  Captain whom I serve has told me that His yoke is easy and His burden is
  light. How easy and how light, I experience every moment of my life."</p>

  <p>"And yet you said but now that death and degradation were the lot of those
  who bore arms by your side in the ranks," observed the Briton, still intently
  regarding his companion.</p>

  <p>A ray of triumphant courage and exultation flashed up into the old man's
  face. For an instant Esca recognised the fierce daring of a nature
  essentially bold, reckless, and defiant; but it faded as it came, and was
  succeeded by an expression of meek, chastened humility, whilst he
  replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Death welcome and long looked-for! Degradation that confers the highest
  honours in this world and the next! at least to those who are held worthy of
  the great glory of martyrdom. Oh! that I might be esteemed one of that noble
  band! But my work will be laid to my hand, and it is enough for me to be the
  lowest of the low in the service of my Master."</p>

  <p>"And that master? Tell me of that master," exclaimed Esca, whose interest
  was excited, as his feelings were roused, by converse with one who seemed so
  thoroughly impressed with the truth of what he spoke, who was at once so
  earnest, so gentle, and so brave. The old man bowed his head with unspeakable
  reverence, but in his face shone the deep and fervent joy of one who looks
  back with intense love and gratitude to the great epoch of his existence.</p>

  <p>"I saw Him once," said he. "on the shore of the Sea of Galilee&mdash;I
  that speak to you now saw Him with my own eyes&mdash;there were little
  children at His feet. But we will talk of this again, for you are weary and
  exhausted. Meat and drink are even now prepared for you. It is good to
  refresh the body if the mind is to be vigorous and discerning. You have done
  for us to-night the act of a true friend. You will henceforth be always
  welcome in Eleazar's house."</p>

  <p>While he spoke, the girl whom Esca had rescued so opportunely entered the
  apartment, bearing in some food on a coarse and common trencher, with a
  wineskin, of which she poured the contents into a jewelled cup, and presented
  it to her preserver with an embarrassed but very graceful gesture, and a soft
  shy smile.</p>

  <p>Mariamne had unveiled; and, if Esca's expectations during their homeward
  walk had been raised by her gentle feminine manners, and the sweet tones of
  her voice, they were not now disappointed with what he saw. The dark eyes
  that looked up so timidly into his own, were full and lustrous as those of a
  deer. They had, moreover, the mournful pleading expression peculiar to that
  animal, and, through all their softness and intelligence, betrayed the
  watchful anxiety of one whose life is passed in constant vicissitudes and
  occasional danger. The girl's face was habitually pale, though the warm blood
  mantled in her cheek as she drooped beneath Esca's gaze of honest admiration,
  and her regular features were sharpened, a little more than was natural to
  them, by daily care and apprehension. This was especially apparent in the
  delicate aquiline of the nose, and a slight prominency of the cheek-bones. It
  was a face that in prosperity would have been rich and sparkling as a jewel,
  that in adversity preserved its charms from the rare and chastened beauty in
  which it was modelled. Her dress betrayed the same incongruity that was so
  remarkable in the furniture of her home. Like her veil it was black, and of a
  coarse and common material, but where it was looped up, the folds were
  fastened by one single gem of considerable value; and two or three links of a
  heavy gold chain were visible round her white and well-turned neck.</p>

  <p>Moving through the room, busied with the arrangements of the meal which
  she must herself have prepared, Esca could not but observe the pliant grace
  of her form, enhanced by a certain modest dignity, very different from the
  vivacious gestures of the Roman maidens to whom he was accustomed, and
  especially pleasing to the eye of the Briton.</p>

  <p>Calchas seemed to love the girl as a daughter; and his kind face grew
  kinder and gentler still, while he followed her about in her different
  movements, with eyes of the deepest and fondest affection.</p>

  <p>Esca could not but observe that the board was laid for three persons, and
  that by one of the wooden platters stood a drinking-cup of great beauty and
  value. Mariamne's glance followed his as it rested on the spare place. "For
  my father," said she gently, in answer to the inquiry she read on his face.
  "He is later than usual to-night, and, I fear&mdash;I fear; my father is so
  bold, so prompt to draw steel when he is angered. To-night he has left his
  sword at home; and I know not whether to be most frightened or reassured at
  his being alone in this wicked town, unarmed."</p>

  <p>"He is in God's hand, my child," said Calchas reverently. "But I should
  not fear for Eleazar," he added, with a proud and martial air. "were he
  surrounded by a score of such as we see prowling nightly in the streets of
  Rome, though they were armed to the teeth, and he with only a shepherd's
  staff to keep his head."</p>

  <p>"Is he, then, so redoubtable a warrior?" asked Esca, on whom good manhood
  seldom failed to produce a favourable impression. While he spoke he looked
  from one to the other with increasing curiosity and interest.</p>

  <p>"You shall judge for yourself," answered Calchas, "for it cannot now be
  long ere he return. Nevertheless, the man who could leap down from the walls
  of a beleaguered city, as my brother did, naked and unarmed; who could break
  the head off a Roman battering-ram by main force, and render that engine
  useless; who could reach the wall again with his prize, covered with wounds,
  having fought his way through a whole maniple of Roman soldiers, and could
  ask but for a draught of water, ere he donned his armour, and took his place
  once more upon the rampart, is not likely to fear aught that can befall him
  from a few idlers in a common street-broil. Nevertheless, as I said before,
  you shall judge for yourself."</p>

  <p>"And here he is!" exclaimed Mariamne, while the outer door shut to, and a
  man's step was heard advancing through the adjoining apartment, with a firm
  and measured footfall.</p>

  <p>She had been pale enough all night in the eyes of Esca, who was watching
  her intently; but he thought now she seemed to turn a shade paler than
  before.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-08"
     id="ch1-08">VIII</a>. &mdash; THE JEW</h2>

  <p class="first">THE man who entered the apartment with the air of one to
  whom every nook and corner was familiar, must have been fully three-score
  years of age, yet his dark eye still glittered with the fire of youth, his
  thick curling beard and hair were but slightly sprinkled with grey, and the
  muscles of his square powerful frame seemed but to have acquired solidity and
  consistency with age. His appearance was that of a warrior, toughened, and,
  as it were, forged into iron, by years of strife, hardship, and unremitting
  toil.</p>

  <p>If something in the line of his aquiline features resembled Calchas, no
  two faces could have been more different in their character and expression
  than those of Eleazar and his brother. The latter was all gentleness,
  kindliness, and peace; on the former, fiery passions, deep schemes, continual
  peril, and contention, had set their indelible marks. The one was that of the
  spectator, who is seated securely on the clifF, and marks the seething waters
  below with interest, indeed, and sympathy, but with feelings neither of
  agitation nor alarm; the other was the strong swimmer, breasting the waves
  fiercely, and battling with their might, striving for his life inch by inch,
  and stroke by stroke, conscious of his peril, confident in his strength, and
  never despairing for an instant of the result. At times, indeed, the
  influence of opposite feelings, softening the one and kindling the other,
  would bring out the family likeness clear and apparent upon each; but in
  repose no two faces could be more dissimilar, no two types of character more
  utterly at variance, than those of the Christian and the Jew.</p>

  <p>As Eleazar's warlike figure came into the light, Esca could not but remark
  with what a glance of mistrust his quick eye took in the presence of a
  stranger, how the strong fingers closed instinctively round the staff he was
  in the act of laying down, and the whole form seemed to gather itself in an
  instant as though ready for the promptest measures of resistance or attack.
  Such trifling gestures spoke volumes of the character and habits of the
  man.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless Calchas rapidly explained to his brother the cause of this
  addition to their supper-party; and Mariamne, who seemed in considerable awe
  of her father, busied herself in placing food and wine before him, with even
  more alacrity than she had shown when serving their guest.</p>

  <p>The Jew thanked his new friend for the kindness he had rendered his
  daughter, with a few brief cordial words, as one brave man expresses his
  gratitude to another, then fell to on the meat and drink provided, with a
  voracity that argued well for his physical powers, and denoted a strong
  constitution and a long fast. As he took breath after a deep draught of wine
  in which, though he pledged him not, he challenged his guest to join, Calchas
  asked his brother how he had sped in the affairs that kept him from home all
  day.</p>

  <p>"Ill," answered the other, shooting from under his thick eyebrows a
  penetrating glance at the Briton. "Ill and slowly, yet not so ill but that
  something has been gained, another step taken in the direction at which I
  aim. Yet I have been to-day in high places, have seen those bloated gluttons
  and drunkards who are the ministers of Caesar's will, have spoken with that
  spotted panther, Vespasian's scheming agent forsooth! who thinks he hath the
  cunning, as he can doubtless boast of the treachery and the gaudy colours, of
  the beast of prey. Let him take care! Weaker hands than mine have ere this
  strangled a fiercer animal for the worth of his shining skin. Let him beware!
  Eleazar Ben-Manahem is a match, and more than a match, for Julius Placidus
  the tribune!"</p>

  <p>Esca glanced quickly at the speaker, as his ear caught the familiar name.
  The look was not lost upon his host.</p>

  <p>"You know him?" said he, with a fierce smile that showed the strong white
  teeth gleaming through his bushy beard. "Then you know as cool and
  well-taught a soldier as ever buckled on a sword. I wish I had a few like him
  to officer the <i>Sicarii</i>* at home. But you know, also, a man who would
  not scruple to slay his own father for the worth of the clasp that fastens
  his gown. I have seen him in the field, and I have seen him in the council.
  He is bold, skilful, and he can be treacherous in both! Where met you him
  last?" he added, with a searching glance at Esca, while at the same time he
  desired Mariamne to fill the stranger's cup and his own.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sicarii</i>," or homicides&mdash;bands of
  assassins, regularly organised in Judaea, who made a trade of murder. ]</p>

  <p>The latter proceeding engrossed the Briton's whole attention. It was with
  the utmost carelessness that he replied to the question, by relating his
  interview, that very morning, with the tribune at Valeria's door. He scarcely
  marked how precisely the father noted down the name in his tablets, for the
  daughter's white arm was reaching over his shoulder, so close that it almost
  touched his cheek.</p>

  <p>It was indeed well worth Eleazar's while to obtain information, from
  whatever source, of any influence that might affect those in authority with
  whom he was in daily contact at Rome. His position was one which called for
  courage, tact, skill, and even cunning, to a great extent. Charged by the
  Supreme Council at Jerusalem, then in the last stage of perplexity and sorely
  beset by Vespasian and his legions, with a private mission to Vitellius, who
  much mistrusted the successful general, he represented the hopes and fears,
  the temporal and political prosperity, nay, the very existence of the Chosen
  People. Nor to all appearance could a better instrument have been selected
  for the purpose. Eleazar, though a bigoted and fanatical Jew of the strictest
  sect, was a man of keen and powerful intellect, whose obstinacy was open to
  no conviction, whose perseverance was to be deterred by no obstacle. A
  distinguished and fearless soldier, he possessed the confidence of the large
  and fighting portion of the nation, who looked on Roman supremacy with
  abhorrence, and who clung dearly to the notion of earthly dominion, wrested
  from the heathen with the sword. His rigid observance of its fasts, its
  duties, and its ceremonials, had gained him the affections of the priesthood,
  and the more enthusiastic followers of that religion in which outward forms
  were so strictly enjoined and so faithfully observed; while a certain fierce,
  defiant, and unbending demeanour towards all classes of men, had won for him
  a character of frankness which did him good service in the schemes of
  intrigue and dissimulation with which he was continually engaged.</p>

  <p>Yet perhaps the man was honest too, as far as his own convictions went. He
  esteemed all means lawful for the furtherance of a lawful object. He was one
  of those who deem it the most contemptible of weakness to shrink from doing
  evil that good may come. Like Jephthah he would have sacrificed his daughter
  unflinchingly in performance of a vow; nay, had Mariamne stood between him
  and the attainment of his ambition, or even the accomplishment of his
  revenge, he would have walked ruthlessly over the body of his child. Versed
  in the traditions of his family and the history of his nation, he was steeped
  to the lips in that pride of pedigree which was so essential a feature of the
  Jewish character: he was convinced that the eventual destiny of his people
  was to lord it over the whole earth. He possessed more than his share of that
  haughty self-sufficiency which bade the Pharisee hold aloof from those of
  lower pretensions and humbler demeanour than himself; while he had all the
  fierce courage and energy of the Lion of Judah, so terrible when roused, so
  difficult to be appeased when victorious. In his secret heart he anticipated
  the time when Jerusalem should again become a sovereign city, when the Roman
  eagles should be scared away from Syria, and a hierarchy established once
  more as the government of the people chosen by Heaven. That he should be a
  second Judas Maccabaeus, a chief commander of the armies of the faithful in
  the new order of things, was an ambition naturally enough entertained by the
  bold and skilful soldier; but, to do Eleazar justice, individual
  aggrandisement had but little share in his schemes, and personal interest
  never crossed those visions for the future, on which his dark and dangerous
  enthusiasm so loved to dwell.</p>

  <p>It was a delicate matter to intrigue with Vitellius in Rome against the
  very general who held supreme authority, at least ostensibly, from the
  Emperor. It was playing a hazardous game, to receive power and instructions
  from the Council at Jerusalem, and to use or suppress them according to the
  bearer's own political views and future intentions.</p>

  <p>It was no easy task to hold his own against such men as Placidus, in the
  contest of finesse, subtlety, and double-dealing; yet the Jew entered upon
  his perilous career with a strenuous energy, a cool calculating audacity,
  that was engraved in the very character of the man.</p>

  <p>Another draught of the rich Lebanon wine served to improve their
  acquaintance, and Eleazar, with considerable tact, drew from the Briton all
  the information he could obtain as to the habits and movements of his
  antagonist the tribune, while he seemed but to be carrying on the courteous
  conversation of a host with his guest. Esca's answers, notwithstanding that
  thoughts and eyes wandered frequently towards Mariamne, were frank and open
  like his disposition. He, too, entertained no very cordial liking for
  Placidus, and experienced towards the tribune that unconscious antipathy
  which the honest man so often feels for the knave.</p>

  <p>Calchas, meanwhile, had returned to the perusal of his scroll, on which
  his brother cast occasional glances of unfeigned contempt, notwithstanding
  that the reader was the person whom he most loved and respected on earth.
  Mariamne, moving about the apartment, looked covertly on the fair face and
  stately form of her preserver, approving much of what she saw; once their
  eyes met, and the Jewess blushed to her temples for very shame. So the time
  passed quickly; the night stole on, the Lebanon was nearly finished, and Esca
  rose to bid his entertainers farewell.</p>

  <p>"You have done me a rare service," said Eleazar, feeling in his breast
  while he spoke, and producing, from under his coarse garment, a jewel of
  considerable value, "a service neither thanks nor guerdon can requite; yet, I
  pray you, keep this trinket in remembrance of the Jew and the Jew's daughter,
  who come of a people that forgive not an injury, and forget not a
  benefit."</p>

  <p>The colour mounted to Esca's forehead, and an expression of pain, almost
  of anger, came into his face, while he replied</p>

  <p>"I have done nothing to merit either thanks or reward. It is no such
  matter to put a fat eunuch on his back, or to defend an unprotected woman in
  a town like this. Take back your jewel, I pray you. Any other man would have
  done as much."</p>

  <p>"It is not every man who could have interposed so effectually," replied
  Eleazar, with a glance of hearty approval at the thews and sinews of his
  friend, replacing the jewel meanwhile in his vestment, without the least sign
  of displeasure at its being declined. He would have bestowed it freely, no
  doubt, but if Esca did not want it, it would serve some other purpose:
  precious stones and gold would always fetch their value at Rome. "At least
  you will let me give you a safe-conduct home," he added; "the night is far
  advanced, and I should!be loth that you should suffer wrong for your
  interposition in our behalf."</p>

  <p>Esca burst out laughing now. In the pride of his strength, it seemed so
  impossible that he should require protection or assistance from anyone. He
  squared his large shoulders and drew himself to his full height.</p>

  <p>"I should wish no better pastime," said he. "than a bout with a dozen of
  them! I, too, was brought up a warrior, in a land you have never heard of,
  many a long mile from Rome; a land fairer far than this, of green valleys and
  wooded hills, and noble rivers winding calmly towards the sea; a land where
  the oaks are lofty and the flowers are sweet, where the men are strong and
  the women fair. I have followed the chase afoot from sunrise to sunset
  through many a summer's day. I have fronted the invader, sword in hand, ever
  since my arm was long enough to draw blade from sheath, or I had not been
  here now. You too are a soldier, I see it in your eye&mdash;you can believe
  that my limbs grow stiff, my spirits droop for lack of martial exercise. In
  faith, it seems to me that even a vulgar broil in the street makes my blood
  dance in my veins once more!"</p>

  <p>Mariamne was listening with parted lips and shining eyes. She drank in all
  he said of his distant home with its woodland scenery, its forest trees, its
  fragrant flowers, and, above all, its lovely women. She felt so kindly
  towards this bold young stranger, exiled from kin and country, she attributed
  her interest to pity and gratitude, nor could she help wondering to find
  these sentiments so strong.</p>

  <p>Calchas looked up from his studies.</p>

  <p>"Fare thee well!" said he. "Take an old man's warning, and strike not
  unless it be in self-defence. Mark well the turning from the main street to
  the Tiber, so shalt thou find thy way to our poor home again."</p>

  <p>Esca promised faithfully to return, and fully intended to redeem his
  promise.</p>

  <p>"Another cup of wine," said Eleazar, emptying the leathern bottle into a
  golden vessel; "the sun of Italy cannot ripen such a vintage as this."</p>

  <p>But the rich produce of the Lebanon was all too cloying for the healthy
  palate and the thirst of youth. Esca prayed for a draught of fair water, and
  Mariamne brought him the pitcher and gave him to drink with her own hand. For
  the second time to-night their eyes met, and although they were instantly
  averted, the Briton felt that he was drinking from a cup more intoxicating
  than all the wine-presses of Syria could produce a cup that made him
  unconscious of the past as of the future, and only too keenly sensible of the
  present by its joy. He forgot that he was a barbarian, he forgot that he was
  a slave.</p>

  <p>He forgot everything but Mariamne and her dark imploring trustful
  eyes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-09"
     id="ch1-09">IX</a>. &mdash; THE ROMAN</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is time to give some account of Esca's anomalous position
  in the capital of the world&mdash;to explain how the young British noble (for
  that was indeed the rank he held in his own country) found himself a slave in
  the streets of Rome. In order to do so it is necessary to take a glimpse at
  the interior of a patrician's house about the hour of supper; perhaps also to
  intrude upon the reflections of its owner, as he paces up and down the
  colonnade in the cool air of sunset, absorbed in his own thoughts, and deep
  in the memories of the past.</p>

  <p>His mansion is of stately proportion, and large size, but all its
  ornaments and accessories are chastened by a severe simplicity of taste. An
  observer might identify the man by the very nature of the objects that
  surround him. In his vestibule the columns are of the Ionic order, and their
  elaborate capitals have been wrought into the utmost degree of finish which
  that style will allow. In the smaller entrance-hall or lobby, which leads to
  the principal apartments, and which is guarded by an image of a dog, let into
  the pavement in mosaic, there are no florid sculptures nor carvings, nor any
  attempt at decoration beyond the actual beauty of the stonework and the
  scrupulous care with which it is kept clean. The doors themselves are of
  bronze, so well burnished as to need no mixture of gold or silver inlaid to
  enhance its brightness; whilst in the principal hall itself, the room in
  which friends are welcomed, clients received, and business transacted, the
  walls, instead of frescoes and such gaudy ornaments, are simply overlaid with
  entablatures of white and polished marble. The dome is very lofty, rising
  majestically towards the circular opening at the top, through which the sky
  is visible; and round the fountain or cistern immediately below this are
  ranged four colossal statues, representing the elements. These, with the
  busts of a long line of illustrious ancestors, are the only efforts of the
  sculptor's art throughout the apartment. A large banqueting-hall, somewhat
  more luxuriously furnished, opens from one side of the central room, and as
  much as can be seen of it displays considerable attention to convenience and
  personal comfort. Frescoes, representing scenes of military life, adorn the
  walls, and at one end stands a trophy, composed of deadly weapons and
  defensive armour, arranged so as to form a glittering and conspicuous
  ornament. Large flagons and chalices of burnished gold, some of them adorned
  with valuable jewels, are ranged upon a sideboard; but it is evident that no
  guests are expected to-night, for near the couch against the wall has been
  drawn a small table, laid for one person only, with a clean napkin, and a cup
  and platter of plain silver thereon. That person is none other than the
  master of the house, bodily pacing up and down his own colonnade in Rome,
  mentally gazing on a fair expanse of wood and vale and shining river,
  drinking in the cool breezes, the fragrant odours, and the wild luxuriant
  beauty of distant Britain.</p>

  <p>Five-and-twenty years! and yet it seems but yesterday. The brow wrinkles,
  the hair turns grey, strength wastes, energy fails, the brain gets torpid,
  and the senses dull, but the heart never grows old. Business, ambition,
  pleasure, dangers, duties, difficulties, and successes have filled that
  quarter of a century, and passed away like a dream; but the touch of a hand,
  the memory of a face, have outlived them all. Caius Lucius Licinius, Roman
  patrician, general, praetor, consul, and procurator of the Empire, is the
  young commander of a legion once more, with the world before him, and the
  woman he loves by his side. This is what he sees now, as he has seen it so
  often in his dreams by night, and his waking visions by day.</p>

  <p>An old oak-tree, a mossy sward soft and level as velvet, delicate fern
  bending and whispering in the summer breeze, fleecy clouds drifting across
  the blue sky, and a graceful form, in its white robes, coming shyly up the
  glade, with faltering step, and sidelong glance, and timid gesture, to keep
  her tryst with her Roman lover. She is in his arms now. The rich brown curls
  are scattered over his breastplate, and the blue eyes are looking up into his
  own, liquid with the love-light that thrills to a man's heart but from one
  pair of eyes in a lifetime. She is, indeed, no contemptible prize, in the
  glory of her beauty and the pride of her blooming womanhood. With the rounded
  form, the noble features, and the dazzling colour of her nation, she
  possesses the courage and constancy of a high-born race, and a witchery half
  imperious, half playful, peculiarly her own. There are women who find their
  way to the core of a man's heart, who pervade it all, and saturate it, so to
  speak, with their influence.</p>

  <p class="verse">"<i>Quo semel est imbuta recens, servabit odorem<br>
  Testa diu&mdash;"</i><br>
  [You may break, you may ruin, the vase if you will,<br>
  But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.]</p>

  <p>The vessel that has once held this rich and rare liquid is ever after
  impregnated with its fragrance, and even when it has been spilt every drop,
  and a fresh infusion poured in, the new wine smacks strangely and wildly of
  the old. She is one of them; he knows it too well.</p>

  <p>They should have nothing in common, these two, the British chieftain's
  daughter and the Roman conqueror. But there is a truce between the nations; a
  truce in which the elements of discord are nevertheless smouldering, ready to
  blaze out afresh at the first opportunity, and they have seen each other
  accidentally, and been thrown together by circumstances, till curiosity has
  become interest, and interest grown into liking, and liking ripened into
  love. The British maiden might not be won lightly, and many a tear she wept
  in secret, and sore she strove against her own heart; but when it conquered
  her at last she gave it, as such women will, wholly and unreservedly. She
  would have lived for him, died for him, followed him to the end of the world.
  And Licinius worshipped her as a man worships the one woman who is the
  destiny of his life. Most men have at some time or other experienced this
  folly, infatuation, madness, call it what you will. They are not likely to
  forget it. Possibly&mdash;alas! probably&mdash;the bud they then watched
  opening has never expanded into bloom, at least for <i>them</i>. The worm may
  have destroyed it, or the cold wind cut it to the earth, or another's hand
  may have borne it away in triumph to gladden another's breast; but there is
  something in the May mornings that reminds them of the sweet flower still,
  and they wander round the fairest gardens of earth rather drearily to-day,
  because of the memory that has never faded, and the blank where <i>she</i> is
  not.</p>

    <p class="caption">Licinius holds the British maiden to his breast.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Licinius holds the British maiden to his breast, and they discourse of
  their own happiness and revel in the sunny hour, and plan schemes for the
  future&mdash;schemes in which each is to the other all in all, and dream not
  that when to-day is past for them there will be no to-morrow. The woman,
  indeed, heaves a gentle sigh at intervals, as though in the midst of her
  happiness some foreboding warned her of the brooding tempest; but the man is
  hopeful, buoyant, and impetuous, playful in his tenderness, and joyous in his
  own triumphant love. They parted that evening more reluctantly than usual.
  They lingered round the oak, they found excuse after excuse for another
  loving word, another fond caress. When at last they went their several ways,
  how often Licinius turned to look after the receding form that carried with
  it all his hope and all his happiness! Little did he think how, and when, and
  where, he would see Guenebra again.</p>

  <p>Ten years went heavily by. The commander of a legion was the chief of an
  army now. Licinius had served Rome in Gaul, in Spain, in Syria. Men said he
  bore a charmed life; and, indeed, while his counsels showed the forethought,
  the caution, and the patience of a skilful officer, his personal conduct was
  remarkable for a reckless disregard of danger, which would have been esteemed
  foolhardy in the meanest soldier. It was observed, too, that a deep and
  abiding melancholy had taken possession of the once light-hearted patrician.
  He only seemed to brighten up into his former self under the pressure of
  imminent danger, in the confusion of a repulse, or the excitement of a
  charge. At other times he was silent, depressed, preoccupied; never morose,
  for his kindly heart was open to the griefs of others, and the legionaries
  knew that their daring general was the friend of all who were in sorrow or
  distress. But the men talked him over, too, by their watch-fires; they
  marvelled, those honest old campaigners, how one who was so ready in the
  field could be so sparing of the winecup; how the leader who could stoop to
  fill his helmet from the running stream under a storm of javelins, and drink
  composedly with a jest and a smile, should be so backward in the revel,
  should show such a disinclination to those material pleasures which they
  esteemed the keenest joys of life.</p>

  <p>One old centurion, who had followed his fortunes from the Thames to the
  Euphrates, from the confines of Pannonia to the Pillars of Hercules, averred
  that he had never seen his chief discomfited but once, and that was on the
  day when he had been accorded a triumph for his services in the streets of
  Rome. The veteran used to swear he never could forget the dejected look upon
  those brows, encircled with their laurel garland, nor the weary listlessness
  of that figure, to which all eyes were directed in its gilded chariot; the
  object of admiration to the whole city, and, for that day, scarcely second
  even to Caesar himself. It was a goodly triumph, no doubt; the spoils were
  rich, the car was lofty, the people shouted, and the victims fell. But what
  was glory without Guenebra? and the hero's eye could not rest in peace on one
  of all those gazing thousands, for lack of the loving face framed in its rich
  brown hair.</p>

  <p>On the very night Licinius and Guenebra parted, a long-meditated rising
  had broken out among the islanders&mdash; conquered, but not subdued. Nothing
  but the cool courage of its young commander, and the immovable discipline of
  the legionaries, saved the Roman camp. Ere morning, Guenebra had been forced
  away by her tribe many miles from the scene of action; the Britons, too,
  retired into their strongholds, those natural fastnesses impregnable by
  regular troops. The whole country was once more in a state of open warfare.
  Prompt and decisive measures were taken; Publius Ostorius, the Roman general,
  in execution of a manoeuvre by which he preserved his line of operation,
  despatched Licinius and his legion to a different part of the island, and
  with all his exertions and all his influence, the young officer could never
  obtain tidings of Guenebra again. It was after this event that the change
  came over Licinius which was so commented on by the soldiers under his
  command.</p>

  <p>Ten years of brilliant and successful services had elapsed when he
  returned to Britain. Nero had but lately succeeded to the purple, nor had he
  then degenerated into the monster of iniquity which he afterwards became.
  Until sapped by his ungovernable passions, the Emperor's administrative
  abilities were of no mean order; and he selected Licinius for the important
  post assigned to him, as being a consummate soldier, and experienced in the
  country with which he had to deal. The latter accepted the appointment with
  alacrity; through all change of time and fortune, he had never forgotten his
  British love. Under the burning skies of Syria, by the frozen shores of the
  Danube, at home or abroad, in peace or war, Guenebra's face was ever present
  to him, fond and trustful as when they last parted under the old oak-tree. He
  longed but to see it once more. And so he did. Thus</p>

  <p>A partial insurrection had been quelled beyond the Trent. The Roman
  vanguard had surprised the Britons, and forced them to fly in great
  confusion, leaving their baggage, their valuables, in some cases even their
  arms, behind. When Licinius came up with the main body of his forces, he
  found, indeed, no prisoners taken, for everything animate had fled, but a
  goodly amount of spoil, over which Roman discipline had placed a strong
  guard. One of his tribunes approached him with a list of the captured
  articles; and when his general had perused it, the officer hesitated as
  though there was still some further report to make. At last he spoke
  out&mdash;</p>

  <p>"There is a hut left standing within the lines of the enemy. I would not
  order it to be destroyed till I had provided for the burial of a dead body
  that lies beneath its shelter."</p>

  <p>Licinius was counting the arms taken.</p>

  <p>"A dead body!" said he carelessly; "is it an officer of rank?"</p>

  <p>"'Tis a woman's corpse," answered the tribune; "a fair and stately woman,
  apparently the wife of some prince or chieftain at the least."</p>

  <p>For Guenebra's sake, every woman, much more every British woman, was an
  object of respect and interest to Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Lead on," said he. "I will give directions when I have seen it;" and the
  general followed his officer to the place already indicated.</p>

  <p>It was but a rude hut made of a few planks and branches hastily thrown
  together. It seemed to have been erected at a moment's notice, probably to
  shelter an inmate in the last stage of dissolution. Through a wide rent in
  the roof the summer sun streamed in brilliantly, throwing a sheet of light on
  the dead face below. The prostrate form was swathed in its white robe, the
  bridal garment of the destroyer. A band of white encircled the head and chin,
  and the brown hair was parted modestly on the smooth forehead calm and
  womanly as of old. It was Guenebra's face that lay there so strangely still.
  Guenebra's face, how like and yet how changed! As he stooped over it, and
  looked on the closed eyes beneath their arching brows, the fair and noble
  features chiseled by the hand of death&mdash;the sweet lips wreathed even now
  with a chastened loving smile&mdash;he could not but mark that there were
  lines of thought upon the forehead, streaks of silver in the hair, the result
  it might be of regrets, and memories, and sorrows, and care for
  <i>him</i>.</p>

  <p>Then the warm tears gushed up into the soldier's eyes, the pressure on his
  heart and brain seemed to be relieved. As when the spear is drawn out of a
  wound and the red stream spouts freely forth, the previous agony was
  succeeded by a dull hopeless resignation, that in comparison seemed almost
  akin to peace. He pressed his lips hard upon the cold dead forehead, and
  turned away&mdash;a man for whom from henceforth there was neither good to
  covet, nor evil to be feared.</p>

  <p>And thus it was that here, on earth, Licinius looked once more upon his
  love.</p>

  <p>Fresh victories crowned his arms in Britain&mdash;a fresh triumph awaited
  his return to Rome; but still as of old with Licinius, the glory seemed to
  count for nothing, the service seemed to be all-in-all. Only, now, the
  restless, eager look had left his face. He was always calm and unmoved, even
  in the uncertainty of conflict or the triumph of success. Still kindly in his
  actions, his outward demeanour was very stern and cold. He kept aloof from
  the intrigues, as from the pleasures, of the Court; but was ever ready to
  serve Rome with his sword, and on many occasions by his coolness and conduct
  redeemed the errors and incapacity of his colleagues or predecessors. Fortune
  smiled upon the man who was insensible to her frowns. Honours poured in on
  the soldier who seemed so careless of their attainment; and Caius Lucius
  Licinius was perhaps the object of more respect and less envy than any other
  person of his rank in Rome.</p>

  <p>It fell out that shortly before the death of Nero, the general, in
  traversing the slave-market on the way from the Forum, felt his sleeve
  plucked by a notorious dealer in human wares, named Gargilianus, who begged
  him earnestly to come and examine a fresh importation of captives lately
  arrived from Britain. To mention their country was at once to excite the
  interest of Licinius, who readily acceded to the request, and spoke a few
  kind words in their native language to the unhappy barbarians as he passed
  through their ranks. His attention was, however, especially arrested by the
  appearance of one of the conquered, a fine young man of great strength and
  stature, who seemed to feel painfully the indignity of his position, placed
  as he was on a huge stone block, whereon his own towering height rendered him
  a conspicuous object in the throng. He had been severely wounded, too, in
  several places, as was apparent from the scars scarce yet healed over.
  Indeed, had it not been so, he would never probably have been here. There was
  something in his face, and the expression of his large blue eyes, that roused
  a painful thrill in the Roman general's breast. He felt a strange and
  undefinable attraction towards the captive, for which he could not account,
  and, pausing in his walk, scanned him with a wistful searching gaze, which
  was not lost on the practised perceptions of the dealer.</p>

  <p>"He should have been shown in private," whispered Gargilianus, with an
  important and mysterious air. "Indeed, my man was just taking him away, when
  I saw you coming, my honoured patron, and I called to him to stop. Ay! you
  may examine him all over&mdash;tall, young, and healthy. Sound, wind and
  limb, and stronger than any gladiator in the amphitheatre. They are men of
  iron, these barbarians, that's the truth, and he has only just come over.
  There! look for yourself, noble general; you will see the chalk-marks* on his
  feet"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* According to Pliny, the distinguishing sign of a
  newly-arrived slave. ]</p>

  <p>"But he is badly wounded," observed Licinius, beginning to scan him, as
  the other instinctively felt, with the eye of a purchaser.</p>

  <p>"That is nothing!" exclaimed Gargilianus. "Mere scratches, skin deep, and
  healed over now. You will not be able to run your nail against them in a
  week. Eyesores, I grant you, to-day, otherwise I would ask two thousand
  sesterces at least for him. These islanders are cheap at any price."</p>

  <p>"I will give you a thousand," said Licinius quietly.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" burst out the dealer, with a quiver of his fingers, that
  expressed a most emphatic negative. "I should lose money by him, generous
  patron! What! A man must live. Caesar would give more for him to die in the
  circus. Look at his muscles! He would stand up for a good five minutes
  against the tiger!"</p>

  <p>This last consideration was probably not without its influence. After a
  little more haggling, the British captive became the property of Licinius at
  the cost of fifteen hundred sesterces; and Esca found the most indulgent and
  the kindest-hearted master in Rome.</p>

  <p>We must return to that master, pacing thoughtfully up and down the
  colonnade, in the cool and pleasant evening air.</p>

  <p>It is, perhaps, one of the most consoling and merciful dispensations of
  Providence that the human mind is so constituted as to dwell on past
  pleasures, rather than past pain. The sorrow that is done with, returns
  indeed at intervals vividly and bitterly enough; but every fresh recurrence
  is less cruel than the last, and we can look back to our sufferings at length
  with a calm and chastened humility which is the first step towards
  resignation and eventual peace. But the memory of a great happiness seems so
  interwoven with the imperishable part of our being, that it loses none of its
  reality by the lapse of time, none of its brightness from the effect of
  distance. Anger, sorrow, hatred, contentions, fleet away like a dream; but
  the smile that gladdened us long ago, has passed into the very sunlight of
  noonday; the whisper that softened our sternest moods, steals with the breeze
  of evening to our heart, gently and tenderly as of yore, and we know, we
  feel, that while crime, and misery, and remorse, are the temporary
  afflictions of humanity, pardon, and hope, and love are its inheritance for
  evermore.</p>

  <p>Licinius, pacing his long shadowy colonnade, dwells not on the anxieties,
  and the separation, and the sorrows of years; on the loss of his dearest
  treasure and its possession by another; not even on the calm dead face bound
  with its linen band. No; he is back in Britain once more with his living
  love, in the green glade where the bending ferns are whispering under the old
  oak-tree.</p>

  <p>A step in the hall rouses him from his meditations, and a kind grave smile
  steals over the general's face at the approach of his favourite slave.</p>

  <p>The Roman patrician looks what he is&mdash;a war-worn veteran, bronzed and
  hardened by the influence of many campaigns in many climates. He is not yet
  past the prime of his bodily vigour, and there is a severe beauty about his
  noble features, and beard and hair already touched with grey, that possesses
  considerable attraction still. Valeria, no mean judge, asserts that he is,
  and always will be, a handsome man, but that he does not know it. She
  respects him much, likes him a good deal, and he is the only person on earth
  for whose good opinion she has the slightest value. In truth, though she
  would not confess it even to herself, she is a little afraid of her
  good-hearted, brave, and thoughtful kinsman.</p>

  <p>A man who has reached mature age without forming family ties is always to
  a certain extent in a false position. No amount of public interest will stop
  up the little chinks and corners, so to speak, which are intended by Nature
  to contain the petty cares and pleasures and vexations of domestic life.
  Without the constant association&mdash;the daily friction&mdash;of wife and
  children, a cynical disposition becomes selfish and morose; a kind one,
  melancholy and forlorn. Licinius feels a blank in his existence, which
  nothing he has yet found serves to fill; and he often wonders in himself why
  the barbarian slave should be almost the only creature in Rome for whom he
  entertains a feeling of interest and regard.</p>

  <p>As he takes his place on the couch by the supper-table, Esca gives him to
  drink; and the patrician cannot help thinking the while, how he would like to
  have such a son, tall and handsome, with so warlike an air; a son whom he
  could instruct in all the intricacies of his glorious profession, whose mind
  he could educate, whose genius he could foster, and whose happiness he could
  watch over and ensure. They converse freely enough during the general's
  temperate meal&mdash;an egg, a morsel of kid, a few grapes, and a flask of
  common Sabine wine. Esca tells his master the encounter of the previous
  evening, and the friendship he had made in consequence, after nightfall.
  Licinius laughs at his account of the skirmish, and the eunuch's
  discomfiture.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," says he. "I trust he did not recognise you. It can have
  been none other than Spado, whom you treated so unceremoniously; and Spado is
  just now a prime favourite with Caesar. I might find it difficult to protect
  you if he knew where to find you, for charms and philtres are deadlier
  weapons in such hands as his, than sword and spear in yours and mine. Did he
  take note of your person, think you, Esca, ere he went down?"</p>

  <p>"I can hardly believe it," answered Esca. "The evening was dark, and the
  confusion great. Moreover, I fled with the poor girl they had surrounded, the
  very instant I could snatch her out of the throng."</p>

  <p>"And you saw these Jews in their home, you say?" pursued Licinius gravely.
  "I have heard much of that people, and, indeed, served against them in Syria.
  Are they not morose, cruel, bloodthirsty? Slayers of men, devourers of
  children? Have they not fearful orgies in which they feast upon human flesh?
  And one day in the week that they devote to solitude and silence, and schemes
  of hatred against all mankind? Are you sure that your entertainers belonged
  to this detestable nation?"</p>

  <p>"Christians and Jews," replied Esca, who had caught the sound of the
  former title in the course of his conversation with Calchas.</p>

  <p>"Are they not the same?" returned Licinius, and to this question the
  barbarian was unable to furnish a reply.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-10"
     id="ch1-10">X</a>. &mdash; A TRIBUNE OF THE LEGIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">UNDER the porch of one of the most luxurious houses in Rome,
  two men jostled in the dubious light of early morning. Exclamations of
  impatience were succeeded by a mutual recognition, and a hearty laugh, as
  Damasippus and Oarses, freedmen and staunch clients of Julius Placidus,
  recognised each other's eagerness to pay court to their joint patron. They
  had risen from their beds while it was yet dark, and hurried hither in order
  to be the first to salute the tribune at his morning levee. Yet they found
  the great hall filling already with a bustling crowd of friends, retainers,
  clients, and dependents. Damasippus was a short, square, beetle-browed man,
  with a villainous leer; Oarses, a pale, sedate, and somewhat precise
  personage. But with this marked difference of exterior, an expression of
  unscrupulous and thorough-paced knavery was common to both. Said Damasippus
  to Oarses, with a shrug of affected disgust&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It may be hours yet ere he will see us! Look at this wretched crowd of
  parasites and flatterers! They will follow the patron to his bath! They will
  besiege him in his very bed! Oh, my friend! Rome is no longer the place for
  an honest man."</p>

  <p>To which Oarses replied, in subdued and humble tones&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The flies gather round the honey, though it is only for what they can
  get. But the sincerest gratitude and affection draw you and me, my dear
  companion, to the side of the illustrious tribune."</p>

  <p>"You speak truth," returned Damasippus. "It is sad to see how few clients
  are uninfluenced by mean and sordid thoughts. An honest man is becoming as
  rare at Rome as at Athens. It was not so in the days of the republic&mdash;in
  the golden age&mdash;in the good old times!"</p>

  <p>"Oh for the good old times!" exclaimed Oarses, still in the same low and
  unmoved voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh for the good old times!" echoed Damasippus; and the two knaves, with
  their arms on each other's shoulders, fell to pacing the extremity of the
  hall, and exchanging spiteful remarks on the concourse with which it was
  filled.</p>

  <p>The tribune's house was the most perfect of its kind in the whole city.
  Standing apart and surrounded by a wall and garden of its own, it combined
  the luxurious splendour of a palace with the comfort and seclusion of a
  private residence. Everything of ornament that was most costly and gorgeous,
  had been procured by Placidus to decorate his mansion. Everything of art that
  was most conspicuous and effective hung on his walls, stood in picturesque
  groups about his apartments, or lay scattered in rich profusion on his floor.
  The hangings that veiled his own sleeping-room from the public eye, were of
  embroidered crimson silk, woven in the looms of Asia, and probably taken by
  the strong hand of the successful soldier as spoils of war. The very pavement
  of the hall was of the richest mosaic, traced in fanciful patterns and inlaid
  with gold. As the morning drew on, it was trodden by a multitude of feet. No
  one of his rank held so numerous a levee as Julius Placidus. In the concourse
  that thronged it now, might be seen men of all countries, classes,
  characters, professions, and denominations. Unlike Licinius, who, indeed,
  owed his influence solely to the firm consistency and unbending rectitude of
  his character, the tribune let no opportunity pass of binding an additional
  partisan to his cause by the ties of self-interest and expectation. They were
  crowding in now through the wide open doors; and while the spacious hall was
  nearly filled, the approach to it, and the street itself outside, were choked
  with applicants, who had one and all, directly or indirectly, something to
  get, or ask, or hope for, from the tribune. Here, an artist brought his
  picture carefully draped in the remains of an old garment; yet not so
  entirely concealed but that a varnished corner might be visible, and the
  painter, nothing loth, might be prevailed on by earnest solicitations to
  reveal, bit by bit, all the beauties of his production. There, a sculptor was
  diligently preserving the outlines of his model, wrapped in its wet cloth,
  from collision with the bystanders, and assuming credit for the mysterious
  beauties of a work, which, perhaps, if uncovered, would have grievously
  disappointed the eyes that scanned it so curiously. In one corner stood a
  jeweller, holding in his hand a gorgeous collar of pearls and rubies,
  prepared by the patrician's orders, and testifying at once to the ingenuity
  of the tradesman, and the munificence of his employer. In another, waited a
  common-looking slave, with a downcast eye and a bloated unwholesome face;
  who, nevertheless, assumed an important air that seemed to say he was sure of
  an early audience, as, indeed, was more than probable in consideration of his
  tidings, a message from venal beauty to the admirer who paid his welcome
  tribute in gold. Parasites and flatterers elbowed their way insolently in the
  midst, as though they had a right to be there, whilst honest men, brown with
  toil, and sighing wistfully for the fresh breezes of Tibur or Praeneste, kept
  aloof, abashed and shrinking, though they had but come to ask for their due.
  Nearest the hangings that concealed the bedroom, stood a dirty slave,
  bespattered with the filth of the fish-market, and exhaling an odour of
  garlic that cleared for him an ample breathing-space even in a Roman crowd;
  but the knave knew the value of his intelligence, and how it would obtain him
  favour in the tribune's eyes. No less important a communication than this,
  that a mullet had been taken the night before of nearly six pounds weight,
  and that so lavish a patron as Placidus should have the first offer to
  purchase at a thousand sesterces a pound. He waited with his eyes intently
  fastened on the curtains, and took no notice of the jabber and confusion that
  pervaded the hall.</p>

  <p>Presently the crowd gave way a little, ebbing backward on either side, and
  forming a lane as it were for three men, who were regarded as they passed
  with glances of great awe and admiration. There was no mistaking the deep
  chest and broad shoulders of one of these, even apart from the loud frank
  voice in which Hirpinus the gladiator was wont to convey his observations,
  without much respect for persons. He was accompanied, on the present
  occasion, by two individuals, obviously of the same profession as
  himself&mdash; Hippias the fencing-master, and Euchenor the boxer. All three
  conversed and laughed boisterously. It was obvious that even at that early
  hour they had not broken their fast without a generous draught of wine.</p>

  <p>"Talk not to me," said Hirpinus, rolling his strong shoulders, and
  observing with great complacency the attention he excited " talk not to me: I
  have seen them all&mdash; Dacians, Gauls, Cimbrians, Ethiopians, every
  barbarian that ever put on a breastplate. By Hercules, they were fools to
  this lad. Why, the big yellow-haired German, whom Caesar gave us for the lion
  last summer, would not have stood up to him for a quarter of an hour. He was
  taller, maybe, a little, but he hadn't the shape, man&mdash;he hadn't the
  shape! You'll hardly call <i>me</i> a kid that hasn't put his horns out, will
  ye? Well, he gave me so much to do with the <i>cestus</i>, that I wouldn't
  have taken it off for a flagon of cheap wine, I tell ye. What think ye of
  <i>that</i>, my little Greek? You don't call it so bad for a beginner, I
  hope?"</p>

  <p>He turned to Euchenor as he spoke, a beautifully-made young man, of
  extraordinary strength and symmetry, with the regular chiseled features of
  his country, and as evil an expression as ever lowered on a fair face. The
  Greek pondered awhile before he answered. Then he made the apposite
  inquiry&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Were you sober, Hirpinus, when you stood up to him? or had you sucked
  down a skinful of wine, before you took your bellyful of boxing?"</p>

  <p>The other burst into a loud laugh.</p>

  <p>"Drunk or sober," said he. "you know the stuff I am made of, just as well
  as I know your weight to an ounce, and your reach to an inch. Ay, and your
  mettle too, my lad! though it don't take a six-foot rod to get to the bottom
  of <i>that</i>. Hark ye, this Briton of mine would eat such a man as you,
  body and bones and all, just as I would eat a thrush, and be ready for
  another directly, without so much as washing his mouth out."</p>

  <p>A very sinister scowl passed across Euchenor's face, who did not quite
  relish this low valuation of his prowess, and, above all, his courage; but he
  was a professional boxer, and, as such, necessarily possessed thorough
  command of temper, so he only glanced a little scornfully over the other's
  frame, which was getting somewhat into flesh, and observed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"There will be money to be made out of him then in the arena, if he falls
  into good hands, and is properly trained."</p>

  <p>Hitherto, the fencing-master had joined but carelessly in the
  conversation, and, indeed, scarcely seemed aware of its purport; but the
  concluding sentence arrested his attention, and turning upon Hirpinus rather
  angrily, and with the air of one accustomed to command, he said
  abruptly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Why did you not bring him to me at once? If you have let him slip through
  those great fingers of yours, it will be the worst job you have been
  concerned in for many a day. Have a care, Hirpinus! Better men than you have
  been under the net ere now, and the great games are not so far off. It needs
  but a word from me to send you into the arena to-morrow, a fair prey for a
  clumsy trident and a fathom or two of twine. You know that as well as I
  do."</p>

  <p>Hippias spoke truth. A retired gladiator, celebrated for his deadly
  swordsmanship and the number of his victories, he had been long ago invested
  by Nero with the wooden foil, which represented a free discharge and immunity
  from future services in the amphitheatre. Habituated, however, to the
  excitement of the fatal sport, and rejoicing in that spurious fame which so
  distinguished men of his class at Rome, he had set up a school for the
  express purpose of training swordsmen for the arena; and had won such favour,
  under two successive emperors, by the proficiency to which he brought his
  pupils, and his talent for arranging the deadly pageants in which they
  figured, that he had gradually become an incontrovertible authority on such
  matters, and the principal manager of the games in the amphitheatre. Of his
  reputation for gallantry, and the strange fascination such men possessed for
  the Roman ladies, we have already spoken; but if his smiles were courted
  amongst the fair spectators of their contests, his word was law with the
  gladiators themselves. He it was who paired the combatants, supplied them
  with weapons, adjusted their disputes, and, in most cases, held the balance
  on which their very lives depended. A threat from Hippias was more dreaded by
  these ruffians than the home-thrust of spear and sword.</p>

  <p>Now, Hirpinus, although a fearless and skilful fighter, had his assailable
  point. On one occasion, when he had entered the circus as a <i>secutor</i>,
  that is to say, a combatant armed with sword and helmet, against the
  <i>retiarius</i>, who bore nothing but a trident and net, he had the
  misfortune to find himself involved in the meshes of the latter, and at the
  mercy of his antagonistic. The Roman crowd, though fickle in its approval,
  and uncertain in its antipathies, spared him in consideration of the gallant
  fight he had made; but Hirpinus never forgot his sensations at that moment.
  Bold and fierce as he was, it completely <i>cowed</i> him; and the
  boisterous, boastful prize-fighter would turn pale at the mention of a
  trident and a net. There was something ludicrous in the manner in which he
  now quailed before Hippias, eyeing him with the same sort of imploring glance
  that a dog casts at his master, and obviously persuaded of the speedy
  fulfilment of his threat.</p>

  <p>"Patience, patron!" he growled apologetically. "I know where the lad is to
  be found. I can lay my hand on him at any time. I can bring him with me to
  the school. Why I talked myself well-nigh hoarse, and stayed out the drinking
  of two flagons of sour Sabine to boot, while I canvassed him to become one of
  <i>us</i>, and join the Family forthwith. Why, you don't think, patron, I
  would be so thick-witted as to let him go without finding out where he lives?
  He is either a freedman, or a slave of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush, fool!" interrupted Hippias angrily, observing that Damasippus and
  Oarses were hovering near, and listening intently for a piece of intelligence
  which he had resolved should be conveyed by himself, and none other, to the
  tribune's ear. "There is no occasion to publish it by the crier. Hadst thou
  but brains, man, in any sort of proportion to those great muscles of thine, I
  could tell thee why, with some hope of being understood. Enough! lose not
  sight of the lad; and, above all, keep thy tongue within thy teeth!"</p>

  <p>The big gladiator nodded a sulky affirmative, puzzled, but obedient; and
  the two freedmen, with many courteous bows and gestures, accosted the
  champions with all the humility and deference to which such public characters
  were entitled.</p>

  <p>"They say there will be two hundred pairs of swordsmen, matched at the
  same moment," observed Damasippus, in allusion to the coming games; "and not
  a plate of steel allowed in the circus, save sword and helmet. But of course,
  my Hippias, you know best if this is true."</p>

  <p>"And three new lions from Libya, loose at once," added Oarses. "with a
  scene representing shepherds surprised over their watch-fires; real rocks, I
  have been told, and a stream of running water in the amphitheatre, with a
  thicket of live shrubs, from which the beasts are to emerge. Your taste,
  illustrious Hippias, the people say, is perfect. It has obviously been
  consulted here."</p>

  <p>Hippias smiled mysteriously, and a little scornfully.</p>

  <p>"There <i>is</i> a lion from Libya," said he; "I can tell you thus much.
  I, myself, saw him fed only yesterday at sunset."</p>

  <p>"Is he large? is he strong? is he fierce?" questioned the two almost in a
  breath. "When did he come? is he quite full-grown? will they keep him without
  flesh? Of course the shepherds are not to be armed? Will they be condemned
  criminals, or only paid gladiators? Not that it matters much, if the lion is
  a pretty good one. We had a tiger, you know, last year, that killed five
  Ethiopian slaves, though they all set on him at once."</p>

  <p>"But they were unarmed," interrupted Euchenor, whose cheek had turned a
  shade paler during the discussion. "Give me the proper weapons, and I fear no
  beast that walks the earth."</p>

  <p>"Unarmed, of course!" repeated Damasippus. "and so was the tiger. A more
  beautiful creature was never seen. Do you not remember, Oarses, how he waved
  his long tail and stroked his face with his paws, like a kitten before it
  begins to play? And then, when he made his spring, the first black was rolled
  up like a ball? I was in the fifth row, my friends, yet I heard his bones
  crack, distinctly, even there."</p>

  <p>"He was a great loss, that tiger," observed Oarses, more sadly than usual;
  "they should never have pitted him against a tusked elephant. The moment I
  saw the ivory, I knew how the fight must end, and I wagered against the
  smaller animal directly. I would have lost my sesterces, I think, willingly,
  for it to have won; but the beautiful beast never had a chance."</p>

  <p>"It was the weight that did it, patrons&mdash;the weight," observed
  Hirpinus. "Man or beast, I will explain to you that weight must
  always&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But here the gladiator's dissertation was broken off by the movement of
  the crimson hangings, and the appearance of Placidus emerging on his levee of
  expectants, bright and handsome, ready dressed for the day.</p>

  <p>The tribune owned one advantage at least, which is of no small service to
  a man who embarks on a career demanding constant energy and watchfulness; he
  possessed that good digestion which is proverbially held to accompany an
  elastic conscience and a hard heart. Though supper the previous evening had
  been a luxurious and protracted meal&mdash;though the winecup had passed
  round very often, and the guests with singing brains had shown themselves in
  their own characters to their cool-headed and designing host the latter,
  refreshed by a night's rest, now appeared with the glow of health on his
  cheek, and its lustre in his eye. As he looked about him on the throng of
  clients and dependants, his snow-white gown fastened and looped up with gold,
  his mantle adorned with a broad violet hem, his hair and beard carefully
  perfumed and arranged, a murmur of applause went round the circle which,
  perhaps, for once was really sincere, and even the rough gladiators could not
  withhold their approbation from a figure that was at once so richly attired,
  so manly, and so refined.</p>

  <p>"Hail, my friends!" said the tribune, pausing in the entrance, and looking
  graciously around him on the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Hail, patron!" answered a multitude of voices, in every key, from the
  subdued and polished treble of Oarses to the deep hoarse voice of the
  gladiators.</p>

  <p>Placidus moved from one to the other, with an easy though dignified
  cordiality of manner which he well knew how to assume when disposed to
  cultivate the favour of his inferiors. Clear-headed and discerning, in a
  wonderfully short space of time he had despatched the various matters which
  constituted the business of his morning levee. He had admired the model,
  declined the painting, ordered the statue, bought the jewels, answered the
  fair suppliant's message, and secured the mullet by sending to the market for
  it at once. The honest countrymen, too, he dismissed sufficiently well
  pleased, considering they had received nothing more substantial than smiles;
  and he now turned leisurely to Hippias, as if life had no duty so engrossing
  as the pursuit of pleasure, and asked him eagerly after the training of his
  gladiators, and the prospects of the amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>Hippias knew his own value; he conversed with the patrician as an equal;
  but Hirpinus and Euchenor, appreciating the worth of a rich patron, gazed on
  Placidus with intense respect and admiration. The latter, especially, watched
  the tribune with his bright cunning eye, as if prepared to plant a blow on
  the first unguarded place.</p>

  <p>"But your swordsmen are all too well known," urged the patrician on the
  fencing-master. "Here is old Hirpinus covers his whole body with two feet of
  steel as if it were a complete suit of armour, and never takes his point off
  his adversary's heart the while. The others are nearly as wary; if they
  encounter ordinary fencers they are sure to conquer; if we match them against
  each other and the people would see blood drawn, they must fight blindfolded,
  and it becomes a matter of mere chance. No, what we want is a new man one
  whom we can train without his being discovered, and bring out as an unknown
  competitor to try for the Emperor's prize. What say you, Hippias? 'Tis the
  only chance for a winning game now."</p>

  <p>"I have heard of such a one," answered Hippias. "I think I can lay my hand
  on an untried blade, that a few weeks' training will polish up into the
  keenest weapon we have sharpened yet; at least, so Hirpinus informs me. What
  say'st thou, old Trojan? Tell the patron how thou earnest to light on thy
  match at last."</p>

  <p>Thus adjured, the veteran gladiator related at considerable length,
  interrupted by many exclamations of wonder from Damasippus and Oarses, his
  chance meeting with Esca in the Forum, and subsequent trial of strength and
  skill at the gymnasium. Somewhat verbose, as we have seen, when he could
  secure an audience, Hirpinus waxed eloquent on so congenial a theme as the
  beauty and stature of his new friend. "As strong as an ox, patron," said he.
  "and as lithe as a panther! Hand, and foot, and eye, all keeping time
  together like a dancing girl's. The spring of a wild-cat, and the light
  footfall of a deer. Then he would look so well in the arena, with his fair
  young face, set on his towering neck, like that of the son of Peleus. Indeed,
  if he should be vanquished, the women would save him every time. Why, one of
  the fairest and the noblest ladies in Rome stopped her litter in the crowded
  street while we walked together, and bade him come and speak to her from
  sheer goodwill. In faith, he was as tall, and twice as handsome, as the very
  Liburnians who carried her on their shoulders."</p>

  <p>The tribune was laughing heartily at the athlete's eloquence; but
  Damasippus, who never took his eyes off his patron's face, thought the evil
  laugh was more malicious than usual at the mention of the Liburnians, and
  there was a false ring in the mirthful tones with which he asked for more
  information as to this young Apollo, and the dame on whom his appearance
  seemed to have made such an impression.</p>

  <p>"I know most of the great ladies pretty well by sight," answered the
  honest swordsman. "Faith, a man does not easily forget the faces he sees
  turned on him in the arena, when he has his point at his adversary's throat,
  and they bid him drive it merrily home, and never spare. But of all the faces
  I see under the awning, there's not one looks down so calm and beautiful on a
  death-struggle as that of the noble Valeria."</p>

  <p>"Like the moon on the torrent of Anio," observed Damasippus.</p>

  <p>"Like the stars on the stormy Aegean," echoed Oarses.</p>

  <p>"Like nothing but herself," continued Hirpinus, who esteemed his own
  judgment incontrovertible on all matters relating to physical beauty, whether
  male or female. "The handsomest face and the finest form in Rome. It was not
  likely I could be mistaken, though I only caught a glimpse of her neck and
  arm for a moment, as she drew back the curtains of her litter,
  like"&mdash;and here Hirpinus paused for a simile, concluding with infinite
  relish,&mdash;"like a blade half drawn, and returned with a clash into the
  sheath."</p>

  <p>Again Damasippus thought he perceived a quiver on his patron's face. Again
  there was something jarring in the tribune's voice, as he said to
  Hippias&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We must not let this new Achilles escape us! See to it, Hippias. Who
  knows? He may make a worthy successor, even for thee, thou artist in
  slaughter, when he has worked his way up, step by step, and victory by
  victory, to the topmost branch of the tree."</p>

  <p>Hippias laughed good-humouredly, turning at the same time his right thumb
  outward, and pointing with it to the roof. It was the gesture with which the
  Roman crowd in the amphitheatre refused quarter to the combatant who was
  down.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-11"
     id="ch1-11">XI</a>. &mdash; STOLEN WATERS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE broken column of one of the buildings destroyed in the
  great fire of Rome, and not yet restored, was glowing crimson in the setting
  sun. Beneath its base, the Tiber was gliding gently on towards the sea. There
  was a subdued hum even in the streets of the Imperial City that denoted how
  the burden and heat of the day were now past; and the languor of the hour
  seemed to pervade even those who were compelled to toil on in the struggle
  for bread, and who could only in imagination abandon themselves to repose. On
  a fragment of the ruin sat Esca, gazing intently on the water as it stole by.
  To all appearance his listless and dreamy mood was unconscious of surrounding
  objects, yet his attitude was that of one prepared to start into action at a
  moment's notice; and though his arms were folded and his head bent down, his
  ear was watching eagerly to catch the faintest sound.</p>

  <p>It is a patience-wearing process, that same waiting for a woman; and under
  the most favourable circumstances is productive of much irritation,
  disappointment, and disgust. In the first place a man is invariably too soon,
  and this knowingly and as it were with <i>malice prepense</i>. Taking time
  thus by the forelock, delays his flight considerably, and indeed reduces his
  pace to the slowest possible crawl; so that when the appointed moment does
  arrive, it seems to the watcher that it has been past a considerable period,
  and that his vigil should be already over, when in reality it is only just
  begun. Then, as the minutes steal on, come the different misgivings and
  suspicions which only arise on such occasions, and which in his right senses
  the self-torturer would be incapable of harbouring. Circumstances which, when
  the appointment was made, seemed expressly adapted to further his designs,
  now change to insurmountable difficulties, or take their place as links in a
  chain of deception which he persuades himself has been forged with unheard-of
  duplicity, expressly for his discomfiture. He thinks badly of everyone, worst
  of all of her, whose unpardonable fault is that she is now some fifty seconds
  late. Then comes a revulsion of feeling, and his heart leaps to his mouth,
  for yonder, emerging on the long perspective, is a female figure obviously
  advancing this way. The expected object is tall, slim, pliant, and walks with
  the firm free step of a deer on the heather. The advancing shape is short,
  fat, awkward, and waddles in its gait; nevertheless, it is not till it has
  reached within arm's length that he will allow himself to be convinced of his
  disappointment. If its ears are pretty quick, the unoffending figure may well
  be shocked at the deep and startling execration which its presence calls
  forth. Then begins another phase of despondency, humiliation, and bitter
  self-contempt, through all which pleasant changes of feeling the old feverish
  longing remains as strong as ever. At last she comes round the corner in good
  earnest, with the well-known smile in her eyes, the well-known greeting on
  her lips, and he forgets in an instant, as if they had never been, his
  anxiety, his anger, his reproaches, all but the presence that brings light to
  his life and gladness to his heart once more.</p>

  <p>Esca rose impatiently at intervals, walked a few paces to and fro, sat
  down again, and threw small fragments of the ruin into the water. Presently a
  figure, draped in black and closely veiled, moved down to the river's side
  near where the Briton sat, and began filling a pitcher from the stream. It
  could hardly have passed the column without seeing him, yet did it seem
  unconscious of his presence; and who could tell how the heart might be
  beating within the bosom, or the cheek blushing behind the veil? That veil
  was lifted, however, with an exclamation of surprise, when Esca stooped over
  her to take the pitcher from her hand, and Mariamne's cheek turned paler now
  than it had been even on the memorable night when he rescued her from the
  grasp of Spado and his fellow-bacchanals. He, too, murmured some vague words
  of astonishment at finding her here. If they were honest, for whom could he
  have been waiting so impatiently? and it is possible, besides, Mariamne might
  have been a little disappointed had she been allowed to fill her pitcher from
  the Tiber for herself.</p>

  <p>The Jewess had been thinking about him a good deal more than she intended,
  a good deal more than she knew, for the last two days. It is strange how very
  insensibly such thoughts gain growth and strength without care or culture.
  There are plants we prune and water every day which never reach more than a
  sickly and stunted vitality after all, and there are others that we trample
  down, cut over, tear up by the very roots, which nevertheless attain such
  vigour and luxuriance that our walls are covered by their tendrils, and our
  dwellings pervaded by their fragrance.</p>

  <p>Mariamne was no bigoted daughter of Judah, for whom the stranger was an
  outcast because a heathen. Her constant intercourse with Calchas had taught
  her nobler truths than she had derived from the traditions of her fathers.
  And with all her pride of race and national predilections, she had imbibed
  those principles of charity and toleration which formed the groundwork of a
  new religion, destined to shed its light upon all the nations of the
  earth.</p>

  <p>It was not precisely as a brother, though, that Mariamne had yet brought
  herself to regard the handsome British slave. They were soon conversing
  happily together. The embarrassment of meeting had disappeared with the first
  affectation of surprise. It was not long before he told her how tired he had
  been of watching by the broken column at the riverside.</p>

  <p>"How could you know I should come here?" asked the girl with a look of
  infinite simplicity and candour, though she must have remembered all the
  time, that she had not scrupled to hint at the daily practice in course of
  conversation with Calchas, on the night when Esca brought her safely
  home.</p>

  <p>"I hoped it," he replied, with a smile. "I have been a hunter, you know,
  and have learned that the shyest and wildest of animals seek the waterside at
  sunset. I was here yesterday, and waited two long hours in vain."</p>

  <p>She glanced quickly at him, but withdrew her eyes immediately, while the
  blood mounted to her pale face.</p>

  <p>"Did you expect to see me?" she asked in a trembling voice; "and I never
  left the house the whole of yesterday! Oh, how I wish I had known it!"</p>

  <p>Then she stopped in painful embarrassment, as having said too much. He
  appeared not to notice her confusion. He seemed to have some confession to
  make on his own part&mdash;something he hardly dared to tell her, yet which
  his honest nature could not consent should be withheld. At last he said with
  an effort&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You know what I am! My time is not my own, my very limbs belong to
  another. It matters not that the master is kind, good, and considerate.
  Mariamne, I am a slave!"</p>

  <p>"I know it," she answered, very gently, with a loving pity beaming in her
  dark eyes. "My kinsman Calchas told me as much after you went away."</p>

  <p>He drew a long breath as if relieved.</p>

  <p>"And yet you wished to see me again?" he asked, while a gleam of happiness
  brightened his face.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she replied, with a kind smile. "Though that hand is a slave's,
  it struck my enemy down with the force of a hundred warriors; though that arm
  is a slave's, it bore me home with the care and tenderness of a woman. Ah!
  tell me not of slavery when the limbs are strong, and the heart is brave and
  pure. Though the body be chained with iron fetters, what matter so long as
  the spirit is free? Esca, you do not believe I think the worse of you because
  you are a heathen and a slave?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was very soft and low while she spoke his name. No voice had
  ever sounded so sweetly in his ears before. A new, strange sense of happiness
  seemed to pervade his whole being, yet he had never felt his situation so
  galling and unendurable as now.</p>

  <p>"I would not have you think the worse of me," he answered eagerly, "upon
  any account. Listen, Mariamne. I was taken captive in war and brought here
  with a hundred others to Rome. We were set up like cattle in the
  slave-market. Like cattle also we were purchased, one by one, by those who
  esteemed themselves practised judges of such human wares. I was bought by
  Caius Lucius Licinius at the price of a yoke of oxen, or a couple of
  chariot-horses. Bought and sold like a beast of the field, and driven home to
  my new master!"</p>

  <p>He spoke with a scorn all the more bitter from having been repressed so
  long. Yet he kept back and smothered the indignation rising within him. This
  was the first ear that had ever been open to his wrongs, and the temptation
  was strong to pour them freely forth to so interested and partial a listener.
  To do him justice, he refrained from the indulgence. He had been taught from
  childhood that it was weak and womanish to complain; and the man had not
  forgotten the lessons of the boy.</p>

  <p>Her gentle voice again interposed in soothing and consoling accents.</p>

  <p>"But he is kind," she said. "kind and considerate&mdash;you told me so
  yourself. I could not bear to think him otherwise. Indeed, Esca, it would
  make me very unhappy to know that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here she broke off suddenly, and snatched up the pitcher he had been
  filling for her with such haste as to spill half its contents over his dress
  and her own.</p>

  <p>"There is someone watching us! Farewell!" she whispered in a breathless,
  frightened voice, and hurried away, turning her head once, however, to cast a
  glance over her shoulder, and then hastened home faster than before. Esca
  looked after her while she continued in sight, either unconscious of their
  vicinity, or at all events not noticing a pair of bold black eyes that were
  fixed upon him with an expression of arch and ludicrous surprise. He turned
  angrily, however, upon the intruder, when the black eyes had gazed their
  fill, and their owner burst out into a loud, merry, and mocking laugh.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-12"
     id="ch1-12">XII</a>. &mdash; MYRRHINA</h2>

  <p class="first">MYRRHINA'S voice was at all times pitched in a high key; her
  accents were very distinct and shrill, admirably adapted for the expression
  of derision or the conveyance of sarcastic remarks.</p>

  <p>"So I have run you into a corner at last," she said. "and a pretty hunt
  you have given me. "'Tis to draw water, of course, that you come down to the
  Tiber-side, just at sunset; and you met her quite by accident, I daresay,
  that slip of a girl in her wisp of black clothes, who flitted away just now
  like a ghost going back again to Proserpine. Ah! you gape like a calf when
  they put the garland on him for sacrifice, and the poor thing munches the
  very flower-buds that deck him for destruction. Well, you at least are
  reserved for a nobler altar, and a worthier fate than to give your last gasp
  to a sorceress in the suburbs. Jupiter! how you stare, and how handsome you
  look, you great, strong barbarian, when you are thoroughly surprised!"</p>

  <p>She put her face so close up to his, to laugh at him, that the gesture
  almost amounted to a caress. Myrrhina had no slight inclination to make love
  to the stalwart Briton on her own account, pending the conclusion of certain
  negotiations she felt bound to carry out on her mistress's. These were the
  result of a conversation held that morning while the maid was as usual
  combing out her lady's long and beautiful hair.</p>

  <p>Valeria's sleep had been broken and restless. She tossed and turned upon
  her pillow, and put back the hair from her fevered cheeks and throbbing
  temples in vain. It was weary work to lie gazing with eyes wide open at the
  flickering shadows cast by the night-lamp on the opposite wall. It was still
  less productive of sleep to shut them tight and abandon herself to the vision
  thus created, which stood out in life-like colours and refused to be
  dispelled. Do what she would to forget him, and conjure up some other object,
  there was the young barbarian, towering like a demigod over the mean
  effeminate throng; there were the waving linen garments, and the reeling
  symbols, and the tossing hands, and the scowling faces of the priests of
  Isis; there was the dark-clad girl with her graceful pliant form; and there,
  yes, always there, in his maddening beauty, was the tall brave figure,
  gathering itself in act to strike. She could not analyse her feelings; she
  believed herself bewitched. Valeria had not reached the prime of her
  womanhood, without having sounded, as she thought, every chord of feeling,
  tasted of every cup that promised gratification or excitement She had been
  flattered by brave, courted by handsome, and admired by clever men. Some she
  fancied, some she liked, some she laughed at, and some she told herself she
  loved. But this was a new sensation altogether. This intense and passionate
  longing she had never felt before. But for its novelty it would have been
  absolutely painful. A timid girl might have been frightened at it; but
  Valeria was no timid girl. She was a woman, on the contrary, who, with all
  the eagerness and impetuosity of her sex, possessed the tenacity of purpose
  and the resolution of a man. Obviously, as she could not conquer the
  sentiment, it was her nature to indulge it.</p>

  <p>"I have a message to Licinius," said she, turning at the same time from
  the mirror, and suffering her long brown hair to fall over her face like a
  veil; "a message that I do not care to write, lest it should be seen by other
  eyes. Tell me, Myrrhina, how can I best convey it to my kinsman?"</p>

  <p>The waiting-maid was far too astute to suggest the obvious arrangement of
  a private interview, than which nothing could have been easier, or to offer
  her own services, as an emissary who had already proved herself trustworthy
  in many a well-conducted intrigue; for Myrrhina knew her business too well to
  hesitate in playing into the hands of her mistress. So she assumed a look of
  perplexity and deep reflection while, finger on forehead, as the result of
  profound thought, she made the following reply</p>

  <p>"It would be safest, madam, would it not, to trust the matter to some
  confidential slave?"</p>

  <p>Valeria's heart was beating fast, and the fair cheek was pale again now,
  while she answered, with studied carelessness</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would, if I could think of one. You know his household,
  Myrrhina. Can I safely confide in any of them?"</p>

  <p>"Those barbarians are generally faithful," observed the maid, with the
  most unconscious air. "I know Licinius has a British slave in whom he places
  considerable trust. You have seen him yourself, madam."</p>

  <p>"Have I?" answered Valeria, moving restlessly into a more comfortable
  attitude. "Should I know him again? What' is he like?"</p>

  <p>The blood had once more mounted to her forehead, beneath the long hair.
  Myrrhina, who was behind her, saw the crimson mantling even on her neck. She
  was a slave, and a waiting-maid, but she was also a woman, and she could not
  resist the temptation; so she answered maliciously</p>

  <p>"He is a big awkward-looking youth, of lofty stature, madam, and with
  light curly hair. Stupid doubtless, and as trusty, probably, as he is thick-
  witted."</p>

  <p>It is not safe to jest with a tigress unless you are outside the bars of
  her cage. Valeria made a quick impatient movement that warned the speaker she
  had gone too far. The latter was not wanting in readiness of resource.</p>

  <p>"I could bring him here, madam," she added demurely, "within six
  hours."</p>

  <p>Her lady smiled pleasantly enough.</p>

  <p>"This evening, Myrrhina," she said; "I shall scarcely be ready before. By
  the way, I am tired of those plain gold bracelets. Take them away, and don't
  let me see them again. This evening, you said. I suppose I, had better leave
  it entirely to you."</p>

  <p>Both maid and mistress knew what this meant well. It implied full powers
  and handsome remuneration on one side, successful manoeuvring and judicious
  blindness on the other. Valeria disposed herself for a long day's dreaming:
  stretched indeed in bodily repose, but agitating her mind with all the
  harassing alternations of anticipation, and hope, and doubt, and fear not
  without a considerable leavening of triumph, and a slight tinge of shame:
  while Myrrhina set herself energetically to work on the task she had
  undertaken; which, indeed, appeared to possess its difficulties, when she had
  ascertained at the first place she sought, namely, the house of Licinius,
  that Esca was abroad, and no one knew in what direction he was likely to be
  found.</p>

  <p>A woman's wit, however, usually derives fresh stimulus from opposition.
  Myrrhina was not without a large circle of acquaintances; and amongst others
  owned a staunch friend, and occasional admirer, in the person of Hirpinus,
  the gladiator. That worthy took a sufficient interest in the athletic Briton
  to observe his movements, and was aware that Esca had spent some two or three
  hours by the Tiber-side on the previous evening&mdash;a fact which he
  imparted to Myrrhina, on cross-examination by the latter, readily enough,
  professing at the same time his own inability to account for it, inasmuch as
  there was neither wineshop nor quoit-ground in the vicinity. Not so his
  intriguing little questioner. "A man does not wait two or three hours in one
  spot," thought Myrrhina, "for anything but a woman. Also, the woman, if she
  comes at all, is never so far behind her time. The probability then is, that
  she disappointed him; and the conclusion, that he will be there again about
  sunset the following day."</p>

  <p>Thus arguing, she resolved to attend at the trysting-place, and make a
  third in the interview, whether welcome or not; killing the intervening time,
  which might otherwise have hung heavily on her hands, by a series of
  experiments on the susceptibility of Hirpinus&mdash;an amusing pastime, but
  wanting in excitement from its harmlessness; for the gladiator had arrived at
  that period of life when outward charms, at least, are esteemed at their real
  value, and a woman must possess something more than a merry eye and a saucy
  lip if she would hope to rival the attraction of an easy couch and a flagon
  of old wine. Nevertheless, she laughed, and jested, and ogled, keeping her
  hand in, as it were, for practice against worthier occasions, till it was
  time to depart on her errand, when she made her escape from her sluggish
  admirer, with an excuse as false and as plausible as the smile on her
  lip.</p>

  <p>Hirpinus looked after her as she flitted away, laughed, shook his head,
  and strode heavily off to the wineshop, with an arch expression of amusement
  on his brave, good-humoured, and somewhat stupid face. Myrrhina, drawing a
  veil about her head and shoulders so as effectually to conceal her features,
  proceeded to thread her way through the labyrinth of impoverished streets
  that led to the riverside, as if familiar with their intricacies. When she
  reached her destination at last, she easily hid herself in a convenient
  lurking-place, from which she took care not to emerge till she had learned
  all she wished to know about Esca and his companion.</p>

  <p>"What do you want with me?" asked the Briton, a little disturbed by this
  saucy apparition, and not much pleased with the waiting-maid's familiar and
  malicious air.</p>

  <p>"I am unwelcome, doubtless," answered the girl, with another peal of
  laughter; "nevertheless you must come with me whether you will or no. We
  Roman maidens take no denial, young man; we are not like your tall, pale,
  frozen women of the north."</p>

  <p>Subscribing readily to this opinion, Esca felt indignant at the same time
  to be so completely taken possession of. "I have no leisure," said he. "to
  attend upon your fancies. I must homeward; it is already nearly supper
  time."</p>

  <p>"And you are a slave, I know," retorted Myrrhina with a gesture of supreme
  and provoking contempt. "<i>A slave!</i> You, with your strength, and
  stature, and courage, cannot call an hour of this fine cool evening your
  own."</p>

  <p>"I know it," said he, bowing his head to conceal the flush of indignation
  that had risen to his brow. "I know it. A slave must clean his master's
  platter, and fill his cup to drink."</p>

  <p>She could see that her thrust had pierced home; but with all her
  predilections for his handsome person, she cared not how she wounded the
  manly heart within.</p>

  <p>"And being a slave," she resumed. "you may be loaded and goaded like a
  mule! You may be kicked and beaten like a dog! You cannot even resent it with
  hoofs and fangs as the dumb animal does when his treatment is harsher than he
  deserves! You are a man, you know, though a barbarian! You must cringe, and
  whine, and bite your lips, and be patient!"</p>

  <p>Every syllable from that sharp tongue seemed to sting him like a wasp: his
  whole frame quivered with anger at her taunts; but he scorned to show it, and
  putting a strong constraint upon his feelings, he only asked
  quietly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What would you with me? It was not to tell me this that you watched and
  tracked me here."</p>

  <p>Myrrhina thought she had now brought the metal to a sufficiently high
  temperature for fusion. She proceeded to mould it accordingly.</p>

  <p>"I tracked you here," she said. "because I wanted you. I wanted you,
  because it is in my power to render you a great service. Listen, Esca; you
  must come with me. It is not every man in Rome would require so much
  persuasion to follow the steps of a pretty girl."</p>

  <p>She looked very arch and tempting while she spoke, but her attractions
  were sadly wasted on the preoccupied Briton; and if she expected to win from
  him any overt act of admiration or encouragement, she was woefully
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I cannot follow yours," said he; "my way lies in another direction. You
  have yourself reminded me that I am not my own master."</p>

  <p>"That is the very reason," she exclaimed, clapping her hands exultingly.
  "I can show you the way to freedom.</p>

  <p>No one else can help you but Myrrhina; and if you attend to her directions
  you can obtain your liberty without delay."</p>

  <p>"And why should you be disposed to confer on me such a benefit?" he asked,
  with instinctive caution, for the impulsive nature that jumps so hastily to
  conclusions, and walks open-eyed into a trap, is rarely born north of the
  Alps. "I am a barbarian, a stranger, almost an enemy. What have you and I in
  common?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have fallen in love with you myself," she laughed out; "perhaps
  you may be able to serve me in return. Come, you are as cold as the icy
  climate in which you were bred. You shall take your choice of the two
  reasons; only waste no more time, but gird yourself and follow me."</p>

  <p>Though it had never been dormant, the desire for liberty had, within the
  last two days, acquired a painful intensity in Esca's breast. He had not
  indeed yet confessed to himself that he cherished an ardent attachment for
  Mariamne; but he was conscious that her society possessed for him an
  undefinable attraction, and that without her neither liberty nor anything
  else would be worth having. This new sensation made his position more galling
  than it had ever been before. He could not ignore the fact, that it was
  absurd for one whose existence was not his own, to devote that existence to
  another; and the degradation of slavery, which his lord's kindness had veiled
  from him as much as possible while in his household, now appeared in all its
  naked deformity. He felt that no effort would be too desperate, no sacrifice
  too costly, to make for liberty; and that he would readily risk life itself,
  and lose it, to be free, if only for a week.</p>

  <p>"You have seen my mistress," resumed Myrrhina, as they hurried on through
  the now darkening streets; "the fairest lady and the most powerful in Rome; a
  near kinswoman, too, of your master. It needs but a word from her to make of
  you what she pleases. But she is wilful, you must know, and imperious, and
  cannot bear to be contradicted. Few women can."</p>

  <p>Esca had yet to learn this peculiarity of the sex; but he heard Myrrhina
  mention her mistress with vague misgivings, and forebodings of evil far
  different from the unmixed feelings of interest such a communication would
  have called forth a while ago.</p>

  <p>"Did she send for me expressly?" he asked, with some anxiety of tone. "And
  how did you know where to find me in such a town as this?"</p>

  <p>"I know a great many things," replied the laughing damsel; "but I do not
  choose everyone to be as wise as myself. I will answer both your questions,
  though, if you will answer one of mine in return. Valeria did not mention you
  by name, and yet I think there is no other man in Rome would serve her turn
  but yourself; and I knew that I should find you by Tiber -side, because you
  cannot keep a goose from the water, nor a fool from his fate. Will you answer
  my question as frankly? Do you love the dark pale girl that fled away so
  hastily when I discovered you together?"</p>

  <p>This was exactly what he had been asking himself the whole evening, with
  no very conclusive result; it was not likely, therefore, that Myrrhina should
  elicit a satisfactory reply. The Briton coloured a little, hesitated, and
  gave an evasive answer.</p>

  <p>"Like tends to like," said he. "What is there in common between two
  strangers, from the two farthest extremities of the empire?"</p>

  <p>Myrrhina clapped her hands in triumph.</p>

  <p>"Like tends to like, say you?" she exclaimed exultingly. "You will tell
  another tale ere an hour be past. Hush! be silent now, and step softly; but
  follow close behind me. It is very dark in here, under the trees."</p>

  <p>Thus cautioning him, she led Esca through a narrow door out of the by-
  street, into which they had diverged, and stepped briskly on, with a
  confidence born of local knowledge that he imitated with difficulty. They
  were now in a thickly planted shrubbery which effectually excluded the rays
  of a rising moon, and in which it was scarce possible to distinguish even
  Myrrhina's white dress. Presently they emerged upon a smooth and level lawn,
  shut in by a black group of cedars, through the lower branches of which
  peeped the crescent moon that had not long left the horizon, and turning the
  corner of a colonnade, under a ghostly-looking statue, traversed another
  door, which opened softly to Myrrhina's touch, and admitted them into a long
  carpeted passage, with a lamp at the farther end.</p>

  <p>"Stay here while I fetch a light," whispered the damsel; and, gliding away
  for that purpose, returned presently to conduct Esca through a large dark
  hall into another passage; where she stopped abruptly, and lifting some
  silken hangings, that served for the door of an apartment, simply observed,
  "You will find food and wine there," and pushed him in.</p>

  <p>Floods of soft and mellow light dazzled his eyes at first; but he soon
  realised the luxurious beauty of the retreat into which he had been forced.
  It was obvious that all the resources of wealth had been applied to its
  decoration with a lavish hand, guided by a woman's sensibility and a woman's
  taste. The walls were painted in frescoes of the richest colouring, and
  represented the most alluring scenes. Here the three jealous goddesses
  flashed upon bewildered Paris, in all the lustre of their immortal charms. A
  living envy sat on Juno's brow; a living scorn was stamped on Minerva's pale,
  proud face; and the living smile that won her the golden apple, shone in
  Aphrodite's winning eyes. There glowed imperial Circe in her magic splendour;
  and the very victims of her spell seemed yet to crave, with fiery glances and
  with thirsty lips, for one more draught from the tempting; luscious, and
  degrading cup. A shapely Endymion lay stretched in dreams of love. A
  frightened Leda shrank while she caressed. Here fair Adonis bled to death,
  ripped by the monster in the forest glade; there, where the broad-leaved
  lilies lay sleeping on the shady pool, bent fond Narcissus, to look and long
  his life away; an infant Bacchus rolled amongst the grapes, in bronze; a
  little Cupid mourned his broken bow, in marble. Around the cornices a circle
  of nymphs and satyrs, in bas-relief, danced hand-in-hand&mdash;wild woodland
  creatures, exulting in all the luxuriance of beauty, all the redundancy of
  strength; and yonder, just where the lamp cast its softest light on her
  attractions, stood the likeness of Valeria herself, depicted by the cunning
  painter in a loose flowing robe that enhanced, without concealing, the
  stately proportions of her figure, and in an attitude essentially her own an
  attitude expressive of dormant passion, lulled by the languid insolence of
  power, and tinged with an imperious coquetry that she had found to be the
  most alluring of her charms.</p>

  <p>It was bad enough to sit in that voluptuous room, under that mellow light,
  drinking the daintiest produce of Falernian vineyards, and gazing on such an
  image as Valeria's an image of one who, beyond all women, was calculated to
  madden a heated brain, whose beauty could scarcely fail to captivate the
  outward senses, and take the heart by storm. It was bad enough to press the
  very couch of which the cushions still retained the print of her form to see
  the shawl thrown across it, and trailing on the floor as though but now flung
  off to touch the open bracelet hastily unclasped, yet warm from its contact
  with her arm. All this was bad enough, but worse was still to come.</p>

  <p>Esca was in the act of setting down the goblet he had drained, and his eye
  was resting with an expression of admiration, not to be mistaken, on the
  picture opposite, when the rustling of the hangings caused him to turn his
  head. There was no more attraction now in bounding nymph or brilliant
  enchantress; haughty Juno, wise Minerva, and laughing Venus with her
  sparkling girdle, had passed into the shade. Valeria's likeness was no longer
  the masterpiece of the apartment, for there in the doorway appeared the
  figure of Valeria herself. Esca sprang to his feet, and thus they stood, that
  noble pair, confronting each other in the radiant light. The hostess and her
  guest&mdash;the lady and the slave&mdash;the assailant and the assailed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-13"
     id="ch1-13">XIII</a>. &mdash; NOLENS VOLENS</h2>

  <p class="first">VALERIA trembled in every limb; yet should she have remained
  the calmer of the two, inasmuch as hers could scarcely have been the
  agitation of surprise. Such a step, indeed, as that on which she now
  ventured, had not been taken without much hesitation and many changes of
  mind.</p>

  <p>No woman, we believe, ever becomes utterly unsexed; and the process by
  which even the boldest lose their instinctive modesty, is gradual in the
  extreme. The power, too, of self-persuasion, which is so finely developed in
  the whole human race, loses none of its efficacy in the reasonings of the
  less logical and more impulsive half. People do not usually plunge headlong
  into vice. The shades are almost imperceptible by which the love of
  admiration deepens into vanity, and vanity into imprudence, and imprudence,
  especially if thwarted by advice and encouraged by opportunity, into crime.
  Nevertheless, the stone that has once been set in motion, is pretty sure to
  reach the bottom of the hill at last; and " I might " grows to " I will," and
  " I will," ere long, becomes " I must." Valeria's first thought had only been
  to look again upon an exterior that pleased her eye; then she argued that
  having sent for her kinsman's slave, there could be no harm in speaking to
  him indeed, it would seem strange if she did not; and under any
  circumstances, of course there was no occasion that her colloquy should be
  overheard by all the maidens of her establishment, or even by Myrrhina, who,
  trusty as she might be, had a tongue of surpassing activity, and a love of
  gossip not to be controlled.</p>

  <p>She ignored, naturally enough, that any unusual interest in the Briton
  should have caused her thus to summon him into her own private and peculiar
  retreat; thus to surround him with all that was dazzling to the eye, and
  alluring to the senses; thus to appear before him in the full glow of her
  personal beauty, set off by all the accessories of dress, jewels, lights,
  flowers, and perfumes, that she could command. If she sent for him, it was
  but natural that he should find her encircled by the usual advantages of her
  station. It was no fault of hers, that these were gorgeous, picturesque, and
  overpowering. He might as well blame the old Falernian for its seduction of
  the palate, and its confusion of the brain. Let him take care of himself! she
  would see him, speak to him, smile on him, perhaps, and be <i>guided by
  circumstances</i>. A wise resolution this last in all cases, and by no means
  difficult to keep when the circumstances are under our own control.</p>

  <p>Valeria, womanlike, was the first to speak, though she scarcely knew what
  to say. With a very becoming air of hesitation she kept clasping and
  unclasping a bracelet, the fellow of the one on the couch. She was doubtless
  conscious that her round white arm looked rounder and whiter in the
  process.</p>

  <p>"I have sent for you," she began. "because I am informed I can rely
  implicitly on your truth and secrecy. You are one, they tell me, who is
  incapable of betraying a trust. Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>It is needless to say that Esca was already somewhat bewildered with the
  events of the evening, and in a mood not to be surprised at anything.
  Nevertheless, he could only bow his head in acknowledgment of this tribute to
  his honesty, and murmur a few indistinct syllables of assent. She seemed to
  gain confidence now the ice was broken, and went on more fluently.</p>

  <p>"I have a secret to confide&mdash;a secret that none but yourself must
  know. Honour, reputation, the fame of a noble family, depend on its never
  being divulged. And yet I am going to impart this secret to you. Am I not
  rash, foolish, and impulsive, thus to place myself in the power of one whom I
  know so little? What must you think of me? What do you think of me?"</p>

  <p>The latter question, propounded with a deepening colour and a glance that
  conveyed volumes, was somewhat difficult to answer. He might have said.
  "Think of you? Why, that you are the most alluring mermaiden who ever tempted
  a mariner to shipwreck on the rocks!" But what he did say was this&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have never feared man, nor deceived woman yet. I am not going to begin
  now."</p>

  <p>She was a little disappointed at the coldness of his answer; yet her
  critical eye could not but approve the proud attitude he assumed, the stern
  look that came over his face, while he spoke. She edged a little nearer him
  and went on in a softened tone.</p>

  <p>"A woman is always somewhat lonely and helpless, whatever may be her
  station, and oh! how liable we are to be deceived, and how we weep and wring
  our hands in vain when it is so! But I knew <i>you</i> from the first. I can
  read characters at a glance. Do you remember when I called you to my litter
  in the street while you were walking with Hirpinus, the gladiator?"</p>

  <p>Again that warm crimson in the cheek&mdash;again that speaking flash from
  those dangerous eyes. Esca's head was beginning to turn, and his heart to
  beat with a strange sensation of excitement and surprise.</p>

  <p>"I am not likely to forget it," said he, with a sort of proud humility.
  "It was such an honour as is seldom paid to one in my station."</p>

  <p>She smiled on him more kindly than ever.</p>

  <p>"I looked for you again," she murmured. "and saw you not. I wanted one in
  whom I could confide. I have no counsellor, no champion, no friend. I said
  what has become of him? who else will do my bidding, and keep my secret? Then
  Myrrhina told me that you would be here to-night."</p>

  <p>She seemed to have something more to say that would not out. She looked at
  the Briton with expectant, almost imploring eyes; but Esca was young and
  frank and simple, so he waited for her to go on, and Valeria, discouraged and
  intimidated for the first time, proceeded in a colder and more becoming
  tone.</p>

  <p>"The packet with which I intrust you must be delivered by yourself into
  the hands of Licinius. Not another creature must set eyes on it. No one must
  know that you have received it from me, nor, indeed, that you have been here
  to-night. If necessary you must guard it with your life! Can I depend upon
  you?"</p>

  <p>He was beginning to feel that he could not depend upon himself much
  longer. The lights, the perfumes, the locality, the seductive beauty near
  him, so lovely and so kind, were making wild work with his senses and his
  reason. Nevertheless, the whole position seemed so strange, so impossible,
  that he could hardly believe he was awake. There was plenty of pride in his
  character, but no leavening of vanity; and, like many another gentle and
  inexperienced nature, he shrank from offending a woman's delicacy, with a
  repugnance that in some cases is exceedingly puzzling and provoking to the
  woman herself. So he put a strong constraint upon his feelings, and undertook
  the delivery of the missive with incredible simplicity and composure. The
  statue of Hermes at the door could not have looked colder and more
  impenetrable. She was a little at a loss. She must detain him at all hazards,
  for she felt that when once gone he would be gone for ever. She determined to
  lead him into conversation; and she chose the topic which, originating,
  perhaps, in the instinctive jealousy of a woman, was of all others the most
  subversive of her plans."</p>

  <p>"I saw you once again," she said. "but it was in the hurry and confusion
  of that sudden broil. It was no fault of mine that the priests committed so
  gross an outrage on the poor thing you rescued. I would have helped you
  myself had you required assistance, but you carried her off as an eagle takes
  a kid. What became of the girl?"</p>

  <p>The question was accompanied by a sharp inquisitive glance, and a forced
  smile of very perceptible annoyance wreathed her lip when she perceived
  Esca's embarrassed manner and reddening brow; but she had unwittingly called
  up the Briton's good genius, and for all women on earth, save one, he was a
  man of marble once more.</p>

  <p>"I placed her in safety with her father," he replied; adding, with an
  assumption of deep humility, "Will you please to give me your commands and
  let me depart?"</p>

  <p>Valeria was so totally unused to opposition in any of her whims or
  caprices that she could scarcely believe this obvious indifference was real.
  She persuaded herself that the Briton was so overpowered by her
  condescension, as to be only afraid of trespassing too far on such unexpected
  kindness, and she resolved that it should be no fault of hers if he were not
  quickly undeceived. She sank upon the couch in her most bewitching attitude,
  and, looking fondly up in his face, bade him fetch her tablets from the
  writing-stand. "For," said she. "I have not yet even prepared my
  communication to Licinius. Shall you be very weary of me, if I keep you my
  prisoner so long?"</p>

  <p>Was it accident or design that entangled those rosy fingers with Esca's,
  as she took the tablets from his hand? Was it accident or design that shook
  the hair off her face, and loosed the rich brown clusters to fall across her
  glowing neck and bosom? It was surely strange that when she bent over the
  tablets her cheek turned pale, and her hand shook so that she could not form
  a letter on the yielding wax. She beckoned him nearer and bent her head
  towards him till the drooping curls trailed across his arm.</p>

  <p>"I cannot write," said she, in trembling accents. "Something seems to
  oppress me&mdash;I am faint&mdash;I can scarcely breathe&mdash;Myrrhina shall
  give you the missive to-morrow. In the meantime, we are alone. Esca, you will
  not betray me. I can depend upon you. You are my slave, is it not so? This
  shall be your manacle!"</p>

  <p>While she yet spoke, she took the bracelet from her arm and tried to clasp
  it round his wrist; but the glittering fetter was too narrow for the
  large-boned Briton, and she could not make it meet. Pressing it hard with
  both hands, she looked up in his face and laughed.</p>

  <p>One responsive glance, the faintest shadow of yielding on those impassible
  features, and she would have told him all. But it came not. He shook the
  bracelet from his arm; and while he did so, she recovered herself, with the
  instantaneous self-command women seem to gather from an emergency.</p>

  <p>"It was but to try your honesty!" she said, very haughtily, and rising to
  her feet. "A man who is not to be tempted, even by gold, can be safely
  trusted in such an affair as mine. You may go now," she added, with the
  slightest bend of her head. "To-morrow, if I require you, I shall take care
  that you hear from me through Myrrhina."</p>

  <p>She looked after him as he disappeared under the silken hangings of the
  portal, her face quivered, her bosom heaved, and she clenched both hands till
  the round white arms grew hard as marble. Then she bit her lip once,
  savagely, and so seemed to regain her accustomed composure, and the usual
  dignity of her bearing. Nevertheless, when the despised bracelet caught her
  eye, lying neglected on the couch, she dashed it fiercely down, and stamped
  upon it, and crushed and ground the jewel beneath her heel against the
  floor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-14"
     id="ch1-14">XIV</a>. &mdash; CAESAR</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN a woman feels herself scorned, her first impulse seems
  to be revenge at any price. Some morbid sentiment, which the other sex can
  hardly fathom, usually prompts her in such cases to select for her instrument
  the man whom in her heart she loathes and despises, whose society is an
  insult, and whose attentions are a disgrace. Thus lowering herself in her own
  esteem, she knows that she inflicts a poisoned wound on the offender.</p>

  <p>With all Valeria's self-command, her feelings had nearly got the better of
  her before Esca left the house. Had it been so, she would never have forgiven
  herself. But she managed to restrain them, and preserved an outward composure
  even while Myrrhina prepared her for repose. That damsel was much puzzled by
  the upshot of her manoeuvres. From a method of her own, which long practice
  rendered familiar, she had made herself acquainted with all that occurred
  between her mistress and the handsome slave. Why their interview should have
  had no more definite result, she was at a loss to conceive. Altogether,
  Myrrhina was inclined to think that Esca had been so captivated by her own
  charms, as to be insensible to those of Valeria. This flattering supposition
  opened up a perspective of hazard, intrigue, and cross-purposes, that it was
  delicious to contemplate. The maid retired to her couch exulting. The
  mistress writhed in an agony of wounded pride and shame.</p>

  <p>Morning, however, brought its unfailing accession of clear-sightedness and
  practical resolve. There are hours of the night in which we can abandon
  ourselves to love, hatred, despair, or sorrow with a helplessness that
  possesses in it some of the elements of repose; but with dawn reality resumes
  her sway, and the sufferer is indeed to be pitied, who can turn away from
  daylight without an impulse to be up and doing, who wishes only, in the
  lethargy of utter desolation, that it was evening once more.</p>

  <p>Valeria was not a woman to pass over the slight she had sustained. Few of
  them but will forgive an injury more readily than an insult. Long before she
  rose she had made up her mind where, and when, and how to strike; nothing
  remained but to select the weapon, and put a keener edge upon the steel. Now
  Valeria had long been aware, that, as far as was compatible with his
  disposition, Julius Placidus was devoted to her service. Indeed, he had told
  her so many a time, with an assumption of off-hand gallantry which, perhaps,
  she estimated at less than its proper value. Nevertheless, the compliments
  she received from the tribune were scarcely so well turned as might be
  expected from a man of his outward polish, refined manners, and general bad
  character. The woman's ear could detect the ring of truth, amidst all the
  jingle that accompanied it; and Valeria felt that the tribune loved her as
  much as it was possible for him to love anything but himself. To do her
  justice, she liked him none the better on that account. He was a man whom she
  must have hated under any circumstances, but perhaps she despised him a
  little less for this one redeeming quality of good taste. Here was a weapon,
  however, keen, and strong, and pliant, placed moreover, so to speak, within
  reach of her hand. She rose and dressed, languid, haughty, and composed as
  usual; but Myrrhina, who knew her, remarked a red spot burning on either
  cheek, and once a shudder, as of intense cold, passed over her, though it was
  a sunny morning in Rome.</p>

  <p>Julius Placidus received a letter ere noon that seemed to afford him
  infinite satisfaction. The gilded chariot flashed brighter than ever in the
  sun, the white horses whirled it like lightning through the streets.
  Automedon's curls floated on the breeze, and the boy was even more insolent
  than usual without rebuke. Lolling on his velvet cushions the tribune's smile
  seemed to have lost something of its malice; and though the tiger-look was on
  him still, it was that of the sleek and satisfied tiger who has been fed.
  That look never left him all day, while he transacted business in the Forum,
  while he showed his grace and agility at ball in the Fives' Court, while he
  reposed after his exertions at the bath; but it was more apparent still when
  the hour of supper arrived, and he took his place in the banqueting-hall of
  Caesar, with some of the bravest soldiers, the noblest senators, the greatest
  statesmen, wits, gluttons, and profligates in the empire.</p>

  <p>A banquet with Vitellius was no light and simple repast. Leagues of sea
  and miles of forest had been swept to furnish the mere groundwork of the
  entertainment. Hardy fishermen had spent their nights on the heaving wave,
  that the giant turbot might flap its snowy flakes on the Emperor's table
  broader than its broad dish of gold. Many a swelling hill, clad in the dark
  oak coppice, had echoed to ringing shout of hunter, and deep-mouthed bay of
  hound, ere the wild boar yielded his grim life by the morass, and the dark
  grisly carcass was drawn off to provide a standing-dish that was only meant
  to gratify the eye. Even the peacock roasted in its feathers was too gross a
  dainty for epicures who studied the art of gastronomy under Caesar; and that
  taste would have been considered rustic in the extreme, which could partake
  of more than the mere fumes and savour of so substantial a dish. A thousand
  nightingales had been trapped and killed, indeed, for this one supper, but
  brains and tongues were all they contributed to the banquet, while even the
  wing of a roasted hare would have been considered far too coarse and common
  food for the imperial board.</p>

  <p>There were a dozen of guests reaching round the ivory table, and so
  disposed that the head of each was turned towards the giver of the feast.
  Caesar was, indeed, in his glory. A garland of white roses crowned his pale
  and bloated face, enhancing the unhealthiness of its aspect. His features had
  originally been well-formed and delicate, expressive of wit, energy, and
  great versatility of character. Now the eyes were sunken, and the vessels
  beneath them so puffed and swollen as to discolour the skin; the jowl, too,
  had become large and heavy, imparting an air of sensual stupidity to the
  whole countenance, which brightened up, however, at the appearance of a
  favourite dish, or the smack of some rich luscious wine. He was busy at
  present with the eager, guzzling avidity of a pig; and he propped his
  unwieldy body, clad in its loose white gown, on one flabby arm, while with
  the other he fed himself on sharp-biting salads, salted herrings, pickled
  anchovies, and such stimulants as were served in the first course of a Roman
  entertainment, to provoke the hunger that the rest of the meal should
  satisfy. Now and then his eye wandered for an instant through the long
  shining vistas of the hall, amongst its marble pillars, its crimson hangings,
  its vases crowned with blushing fruit and flowers, its sideboards blazing
  with chalices, and flagons, and plates of burnished gold, as though he
  expected and winced from a blow; but the restless glance was sure to return
  to the table, and quench itself once more in the satisfaction of his
  favourite employment.</p>

  <p>Next to the Emperor was placed Paris, the graceful pantomimist, whose
  girlish face was already flushed with wine, and who turned his dark laughing
  eyes from one to another of the guests with the good-humoured insolence of
  incipient intoxication. The young actor's dress was extravagant in the
  extreme, and he wore a collar of pearls, the gift of an empress, that would
  have purchased a province. He was talking volubly to a fat, coarse-featured
  man, his neighbour, who answered him at intervals with a grunt of
  acquiescence, but in whose twinkling eye lurked a world of wit and sarcasm,
  and from whose thick sensual lips, engrossed as they were with the business
  of the moment, would drop ever and anon some pungent jest, that was sure to
  be repeated to-morrow at every supper-table in Rome. Montanus was a crafty
  statesman and a practised diplomatist, whose society was sought for at the
  Court, whose opinions carried weight in the Senate; but the old voluptuary
  had long discovered that there was no safety under the Empire for those who
  took a leading part in the council, but that certain distinction awaited
  proficiency at the banquet&mdash;so he devoted his powerful intellect to the
  study of gastronomy and the fabrication of witty sayings; nor did he ever
  permit the outward expression of his countenance to betray a consciousness of
  the good things that went into and came out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>Beyond him again reclined Licinius; his manly face and noble bearing
  presenting a vivid contrast to those who surrounded him, and who treated him,
  one and all, including Caesar himself, with marked deference and respect. The
  old soldier, however, appeared somewhat weary, and out of his element. He
  loathed these long entertainments, so opposed to his own simple habits; and
  regarded the company in his secret heart with a good-humoured, yet very
  decided, contempt. So he sat through the banquet as he would have kept watch
  on an outpost. It was tedious, it was disagreeable. There was nothing to be
  gained by it; but it was duty, and it must be done.</p>

  <p>Far different, in the frank joyous expression he knew so well how to put
  on, was the mien of Julius Placidus, as he replied to a brief, indistinct
  question from the Emperor (murmured with his mouth full), by a sally that set
  everyone near him laughing, and even raised a smile on the pale face of
  Vitellius himself. It was the tribune's cue to make his society universally
  popular&mdash;to be all things to all men, especially to win the confidence
  of his imperial host. There is an art in social success, no less than in any
  other triumph of natural ability. The rein must never be completely loosed,
  the bow never stretched to its full compass. Latent power ready to be called
  forth, is the secret of all grace; and while the observed does well, it must
  be apparent to the observer that he could do better if he chose. Also, to be
  really popular, a man, though a good deal liked, should be a little feared.
  Julius Placidus excelled in the retort courteous, which he could deliver
  without the slightest hesitation or change of countenance; and a nickname or
  a sarcasm once inflicted by the ready-witted tribune clung afterwards to its
  object like a burr. Then he possessed besides the invaluable qualification of
  a discriminating taste in seasonings, the result of a healthy palate,
  refined, but not destroyed by the culture bestowed on it; and could drink
  every man of them, except Montanus, under the table, without his stomach or
  his brain being affected by the debauch.</p>

  <p>Our acquaintance Spado was also of the party. Generally a buffoon of no
  mean calibre, and one whose special talent lay in such coarse and practical
  jests as served to amuse Vitellius when his intellects had become too torpid
  to appreciate the nicer delicacies of wit, the eunuch was to-night peculiarly
  dull and silent. He reclined, with his head resting on his hand, and seemed
  to conceal as much as he could of his face, one side of which was swollen and
  discoloured as from a blow. His fat unwieldy form looked more disgusting than
  usual in its sumptuous dress, fastened and looped up at every fold with
  clasps of emeralds and pearls; and though he ate slowly and with difficulty,
  he seemed determined to lose none of the gratifications of the meal.</p>

  <p>There were a few more guests&mdash;one or two senators&mdash;who, with the
  caution, but not the genius of Montanus, were conspicuous for nothing but
  their fulsome adulation of the Emperor. A tall sullen-looking man, commander
  of the Praetorian Guard, who never laid aside the golden breast-plate in
  which he was encased, and who seemed only anxious for the conclusion of the
  entertainment. Three or four unknown and undistinguished persons, called in
  Roman society by the expressive term "Shades," whose social position, and,
  indeed, whose very existence, depended on the patrons they followed. Amongst
  these were two freedmen of the Emperor, pale anxious-looking beings, with
  haggard eyes and careworn faces. It was their especial duty to guard against
  poison, by tasting of every dish served to their employer. It might be
  supposed that, as in previous reigns, one such functionary would have been
  enough; but the great variety of dainties in which the enormous appetite of
  Vitellius enabled him to indulge, rendered it impossible for any one stomach
  to keep pace with him throughout the whole of a meal, and these devoted
  champions took it by turns to guard their master with their lives. Keen
  appetites and jovial looks were not to be expected from men engaged on such a
  duty.</p>

  <p>The first course, though long protracted, came to an end at last. Its
  greatest delicacy, consisting of dormice sprinkled with poppy-seed and honey,
  had completely disappeared. The tables were cleared by a band of Asiatic
  youths, richly habited, who entered to the sounds of wild Eastern music, and
  bore off the fragments that remained. As they emerged at one door, a troop of
  handsome fair-haired maidens&mdash; barbarian captives&mdash;simply clad in
  white muslin, and garlanded with flowers, entered at another, carrying the
  golden dishes and vessels that contained the second course. In the meantime,
  hanging curtains parted slowly from before a recess in the middle of the
  hall, and disclosed three Syrian dancing-girls, grouped like a picture, in
  different attitudes of voluptuous grace. Shaded lamps were so disposed as to
  throw a rosy light upon their limbs and faces; while soft thin vapours curled
  about them, rising from braziers burning perfumed incense at their feet.
  Simultaneously they clashed their cymbals, and bounded wildly out upon the
  floor. Then began a measure of alternate languor and activity, now swelling
  into frantic bacchanalian gestures, now sinking into tender lassitude or
  picturesque repose. The warm blood glowed in the dark faces of these
  daughters of the sun, the black eyes flashed under their long eyelashes, and
  their white teeth showed like pearls between the rich red lips; while the
  beautifully turned limbs, and the flexible, undulating forms, writhed
  themselves into attitudes suggestive of imperious conquest, coy reluctance,
  or yielding love.</p>

  <p>The dance was soon over; wilder and faster flitted the glancing feet, and
  tossed the shapely hands, encircled with bracelets and anklets of tiny silver
  bells. When the measure was whirling at its speediest, the three stopped
  short, and at once, as if struck into stone, formed a group of rare fantastic
  beauty at the very feet of Caesar's guests; who one and all broke into a
  murmur of unfeigned applause. As, touching their mouths and foreheads with
  their hands in Eastern obeisance, they retired, Placidus flung after them a
  collar of pearls, to be picked up by her who was apparently the leader of the
  three. One of the Emperor's freedmen seemed about to follow his example, for
  he buried his hand in his bosom, but either changed his mind or else found
  nothing there, since he drew it forth again empty; while Vitellius himself,
  plucking a bracelet from his arm, threw it after the retreating dancers,
  remarking that it was intended as a bribe to go away, for they only
  distracted attention from matters of real importance, now that the second
  course had come in; to which Montanus gave his cordial approval, fixing his
  eyes at the same time on the breast of a flamingo in which the skilful carver
  had just inserted the point of his long knife.</p>

  <p>It would be endless to go into the details of such a banquet as that which
  was placed before the guests of Caesar. Wild boar, pasties, goats, every kind
  of shellfish, thrushes, beccaficoes, vegetables of all descriptions, and
  poultry, were removed to make way for the pheasant, the guinea-hen, the
  turkey, the capon, venison, ducks, woodcocks, and turtle-doves. Everything
  that could creep, or fly, or swim, and could boast a delicate flavour when
  cooked, was pressed into the service of the Emperor; and when appetite was
  appeased and could do no more, the strongest condiments and other remedies
  were used to stimulate fresh hunger and consume a fresh supply of superfluous
  dainties. But the great business of the evening was not yet half finished.
  Excess of eating was indeed the object; but it was to excess of drinking that
  the gluttons of that period looked as the especial relief of every
  entertainment, since the hope of each seemed to be, that when thoroughly
  flooded, and, so to speak, washed out with wine, he might begin eating again.
  The Roman was no drunkard like the barbarian, for the sake of that wild
  excitement of the brain which is purchased by intoxication. No, he ate to
  repletion that he might drink with gratification. He drank to excess that he
  might eat again.</p>

  <p>Another train of slaves now cleared the table. These were Nubian eunuchs,
  clad in white turbans and scarlet tunics, embroidered with seed pearls and
  gold. They brought in the dessert&mdash;choice fruits heaped upon vases of
  the rarest porcelain, sweetmeats in baskets of silver filigree, Syrian dates
  borne by miniature golden camels of exquisite workmanship&mdash; masses of
  flowers in the centre, and perfumes burning at the corners of the table.
  Behind each couch containing its three guests stood a sable cup-bearer, deaf
  and dumb, whose only business it was to fill for his especial charge. These
  mutes were procured at vast expense from every corner of the empire; but
  Caesar especially prided himself on their similarity in face and figure.
  To-day he would be served by Germans, to-morrow by Gauls, the next by
  Ethiopians, and so on; nor, though deprived of the organs of speech and
  hearing, were these ministers of Bacchus unobservant of what took place
  amongst the votaries on whom they waited; and it was said that the mutes in
  the palace heard more confidences, and told more secrets, than all the old
  women in Rome put together.</p>

  <p>And now, taking his cue from the Emperor, each man loosened the belt of
  his tunic, shifted the garland of flowers off his brows, disposed himself in
  an easier attitude on his couch, and proffered his cup to be filled by the
  attendant. The great business of eating was for the present concluded, and
  deep drinking about to commence. When marvelling, however, at the quantity of
  wine consumed by the Romans in their entertainments, we must remember that it
  was the pure and unadulterated juice of the grape, that it was in general
  freely mixed with water, and that they thus imbibed but a very small portion
  of alcohol, which is in reality the destructive quality of all stimulants, to
  the welfare of the stomach and the brain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-15"
     id="ch1-15">XV</a>. &mdash; RED FALERNIAN</h2>

  <p class="first">CAESAR'S eye, though dim and sunken, flashed up for a moment
  with a spark of enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"The beccaficoes," said he. "were a thought over-seasoned, but the capon's
  liver stewed in milk was perfection. Varus, see that it is served again at
  the imperial table within the week."</p>

  <p>The freedman took out his tablets and made a note of the royal commands
  with a somewhat unsteady hand, while Vitellius, draining his cup to the
  dregs, smacked his lips, and let his great chin sink on his breast once
  more.</p>

  <p>The other guests conversed freely. Licinius and one of the senators were
  involved in an argument on military matters, with which the man of peace
  seemed almost as conversant as the man of war, and on which he laid down the
  law with far more confidence. Placidus was describing certain incidents of
  the campaign in Judaea, with an air of unassuming modesty and a deference to
  the opinions of others, which won him no little favour from those who sat
  near and listened, throwing in, every now and then, a chance expression or
  trifling anecdote, derogatory, by implication, to Vespasian's military skill,
  and eulogistic of Vitellius; for this reason doubly sweet in the ears of him
  at whose board the tribune sat. Montanus, whose cup was filled and emptied
  with startling rapidity, looked about him for a subject on which to vent some
  of the sarcasm with which he was charged, and found it in the woebegone
  appearance of Spado, who, despite the influence of food and wine, seemed
  unusually depressed and ill at ease. The eunuch on ordinary occasions was a
  prince of boon-companions, skilled in all the niceties of gastronomy, versed
  in the laws of drinking, overflowing with mirth and jollity, an adroit
  flatterer where flattery was acceptable, and a joyous buffoon who could give
  and take with equal readiness and good-humour, when banter was the order of
  the day. Now, less thirsty than usual, the feast seemed to have no enlivening
  effect on his disposition. He was silent, preoccupied, and, to all
  appearance, intent only on concealing his bruised cheek from the observation
  of those about him. He had never been struck in anger, never even stood face
  to face with a man before, and it had cowed him. The soft self-indulgent
  voluptuary could neither forget nor overcome his feelings of combined wrath,
  dismay, and shame. Montanus turned round and emptied a brimming goblet to his
  health.</p>

  <p>"You are cheerless to-night, man!" quoth the senator; "you drink not,
  neither do you speak. What, has the red Falernian lost its flavour? or has
  some Canidia bewitched you with her evil eye? You used to be a prince of
  boon-companions, Spado, thirsty as a camel in the Libyan desert, insatiate as
  the sand on which he travels, and now your eye is dull, your face dejected,
  and your cup stands untasted, unnoticed, though bubbling to the brim. By the
  spear of Bacchus, 'tis not the fault of the liquor!" and Montanus emptied his
  own goblet with the air of a man who thoroughly appreciated the vintage he
  extolled.</p>

  <p>Vitellius looked up for an instant, roused by the congenial theme.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing the matter with the wine," said Caesar. "Fill
  round."</p>

  <p>The imperial hint was not to be disregarded, and Spado, with a forced
  smile, put his goblet to his lips and drained it ,to the last drop. In doing
  so the discoloration of his face was very apparent; and the guests, who had
  now arrived at that stage of conviviality where candour takes the place of
  politeness, proceeded to make their remarks without reserve.</p>

  <p>"You have painted too thick," said one of the freedmen, alluding to an
  effeminacy of the times which the male sex were not ashamed to practise.</p>

  <p>"You have taken off the paste and the skin with it," continued the other,
  whose own mistress was in the daily habit of spreading a kind of poultice
  over her whole countenance, and who might therefore be a good judge of the
  process and its results.</p>

  <p>"You have been in the wars!" sneered one guest. "Or the amphitheatre!"
  echoed another. "'Tis a love-token from Chloe!" laughed a third. "Or a
  remembrance from Lydia!" added a fourth. "Nay," interposed Montanus. "our
  friend is too experienced a campaigner to come off second-best with a foe of
  that description. There must have been a warm encounter to leave such traces
  as those. She must have been a very Amazon, Spado, that could maul thee
  thus."</p>

  <p>The eunuch looked from one to another of his tormentors with rather an
  evil smile. He well knew, however, that any appearance of annoyance would add
  tenfold to the ridicule which he must make up his mind to undergo, and that
  the best way for a man to turn a jest, even when to his own disadvantage, is
  to join in it himself; so he glanced at the Emperor, took a long draught of
  red Falernian, and assumed a face of quaint and good-humoured self-
  commiseration.</p>

  <p>"Talk not to me of Amazons," said he, whereat there was a general laugh.
  "Tell me not of Chloes, and Lydias, and Lalages, and the rest. What's a Helen
  of Troy compared to a flask of this red Falernian? Why good wine gets better
  the longer you keep it, while woman loses her flavour year by year. 'Faith,
  if you only wait till she is old enough, she becomes very sour vinegar
  indeed. Even in the first flush of her beauty, I doubt whether any of you in
  your hearts think she is worth the trouble of catching. Still, you know, a
  man likes to look at a pretty face. Mine had not otherwise been so disfigured
  now. I had an adventure on that score but two nights ago. Would Caesar like
  to hear it?"</p>

  <p>Caesar gave a nod and a grunt that signified acquiescence. Thus
  encouraged, Spado went on&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It was the feast of Isis. I was coming from the worship of the goddess,
  and the celebration of those sacred rites, which may not be disclosed to the
  vulgar and the profane mysteries too holy to be mentioned, save to pure and
  virgin ears." Here the countenance of Montanus assumed an expression that
  made even Caesar smile, and caused the rest to laugh outright. "The
  procession was returning filled with inspiration from the goddess. The
  acolytes leaping and dancing in the van, the priests marching majestically
  under her symbols, and some of the noblest matrons in Rome bringing up the
  rear. The noblest and the fairest," repeated Spado, glancing round him
  complacently. "I name no names; but you all know that ours is not a vulgar
  worship, nor an illiberal creed."</p>

  <p>Here Placidus stirred somewhat uneasily on his couch, and buried his face
  in his cup.</p>

  <p>"The Roman people have ever paid the highest honours to our Egyptian
  goddess," proceeded the eunuch; "we lack the support of the plebeian no more
  than the worship of the patrician. Thus we flourish and drain draughts of
  plenty from the silver udders of our sacred cow. Well, they made way for us
  in the streets, both men and women&mdash;all but one slender girl dressed in
  black, who, coming quickly round a corner, found herself in the midst of us,
  and seemed too frightened to move. In another minute she would have been
  trampled to death by the crowd, when I seized hold of her in order to draw
  her into a place of safety while they passed."</p>

  <p>"Or to see what sort of a face she hid under her black hood?" interrupted
  Montanus.</p>

  <p>"Not so," replied the narrator, though obviously gratified by the
  impeachment. "Such follies I leave to senators, and statesmen, and soldiers.
  My object was simply to afford her my protection. I had better have plucked a
  nettle with my naked hand. The girl screamed and struggled as if she had
  never looked in a man's face before."</p>

  <p>"She was frightened at your beard," said one of the freedmen, looking at
  Spado's smooth fat face. The latter winced, but affected not to hear. "Coax a
  frightened woman," said he, "and frighten an angry one. I flatter myself I
  know how to deal with them all. The girl would have been quiet enough had I
  been let alone; when just as she began to look kindly in my face, up comes an
  enormous barbarian, a hideous giant with waving yellow hair, and tries to
  snatch the maiden by main force from my grasp. I am a strong man, as you may
  perhaps have observed, my friends, and a fierce one when my blood is up. I
  showed fight. I struck him to the earth. He rose again with redoubled fury,
  and taking me at a disadvantage while I was protecting the girl, inflicted
  this injury on my face. I was stunned for an instant, and he seized that
  opportunity to make his escape. Well for him that he did so. Let him keep out
  of the way if he be wise. Should he cross my path again, he had better be in
  Euchenor's hands than mine; I will show him no mercy; "and Spado quaffed off
  his wine and squared his fat shoulders with the air of a gladiator.</p>

  <p>"And what became of the girl?" asked Paris, who had hitherto listened to
  the recital with utter indifference.</p>

  <p>"She was carried off by the barbarian," replied Spado. "Poor thing! I
  believe sorely against her will. Nevertheless, she was borne off by the
  Briton."</p>

  <p>"A Briton!" exclaimed Licinius, whose intense contempt for Spado had
  hitherto kept him silent, and who had already heard the truth of the story
  from his slave.</p>

  <p>"A Briton," repeated the eunuch. "It was impossible he could be otherwise
  from his size and ferocity. The Gaul, you see, is bigger than the Roman. The
  German than the Gaul. The Briton, by the same argument, must be bigger than
  the German; and this hideous giant must consequently have been one of those
  savage islanders. I take my logic from the Greeks."</p>

  <p>"But not your boxing, it seems," observed Montanus, "We must have Euchenor
  to give you some lessons, if you run your head into these street brawls
  whenever you come across a woman with a veil."</p>

  <p>"Nay," answered the eunuch. "he took me at a disadvantage; nevertheless he
  was a large and powerful athlete there is no denying it."</p>

  <p>"They are the finest men we have in the empire," said Licinius, thinking
  in his heart that the women were the fairest too.</p>

  <p>"Their oysters are better than ours," observed Caesar, with an air of
  profound and impartial judgment.</p>

  <p>"I grant the oysters, but I deny the men," said Placidus, reflecting that
  his patriotism would be acceptable to his audience. "The Roman is the natural
  conqueror of the world. They cannot stand against our countrymen in the
  arena." The guests all joined in a cordial assent. Had it not been so,
  perhaps Licinius would have scarce thought it worth while to continue the
  argument. Now, though half ashamed of his warmth, he took up the matter with
  energy.</p>

  <p>"There is a Briton in my house at this moment," said he, "who is a
  stronger and finer man than you will produce in Rome."</p>

  <p>"You mean that long-legged lad with the mop of light hair?" said Placidus
  contemptuously. "I have seen him. I call him a boy, not a man."</p>

  <p>Licinius felt somewhat irritated. He did not particularly like his
  company; and between two such opposite natures as his own and the tribune's
  there existed a certain hidden repugnance, which was sure sooner or later to
  break forth. He answered angrily&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I will match him against any one you can produce to run, leap, wrestle,
  throw the quoit, and swim."</p>

  <p>"Those are a boy's accomplishments," retorted the other coolly. "What I
  maintain is this, that, whether from want of courage or skill or both, these
  islanders are of no use with the steel. I would wish no better sport than to
  fight him myself in the arena, with the permission of Caesar&mdash;" and the
  tribune bowed gracefully to his imperial host, who looked from one to the
  other of the disputants, without the slightest apparent interest in their
  discussion.</p>

  <p>At this period of the Empire, when, although manners had become utterly
  dissolute, something was still left of the old audacity that had made the
  Roman a conqueror wherever he planted his foot, it was by no means unusual
  for men of patrician rank to appear in their own proper persons, a spectacle
  for the vulgar, in the amphitheatre. It was, perhaps, not unnatural that a
  desire for imitation should at last be aroused by the excessive fondness for
  these games of bloodshed, which pervaded all classes of the community. We
  have nothing in modern times that can at all convey to us the passion of the
  Roman citizen for the amusements of his circus. They were as necessary to his
  existence as daily bread. <i>Panem et Circenses</i> had passed into a
  familiar proverb. He would leave his home, neglect his business, forfeit his
  bath, to sit for hours on the benches of the amphitheatre, exposed to heat
  and crowding, and every sort of inconvenience, and would bring his food with
  him rather than run the risk of losing his place. And all this to see trained
  gladiators shedding each other's blood, wild beasts tearing foreign captives
  limb from limb, and imitation battles which differed in no respect from real,
  save that the wounded were not spared, and the slaughter consequently far
  greater in proportion to the number of combatants engaged. If a statesman
  wished to court popularity, if an emperor desired to blot out a whole page of
  enormities and crimes, he had but to give the people one of these free
  entertainments of blood&mdash;the more victims the better&mdash;and they were
  ready to approve of any measure, and to pardon any atrocity.</p>

  <p>Ere long some fierce spirits panted to take part in the sports they so
  loved to contemplate; and the disgraceful exhibition ceased to be confined to
  hireling gladiators or condemned slaves. Knights and patricians entered the
  arena, to contend for the praises of the vulgar; and the noblest blood in
  Rome was shed for the gratification of plebeian spectators, who, sitting at
  ease munching cakes and sausages, could contemplate with placid interest the
  death agonies of the Cornelii or the Gracchi.</p>

  <p>Julius Placidus, like many other fashionable youths of the period, prided
  himself on his skill in the deadly exercises of the circus. He had appeared
  before the Roman public at different times, armed with all the various
  weapons of the gladiator; but the exercise in which he considered himself
  most perfect was that of the trident and the net. The contest between the
  <i>retiarius</i> and the <i>secutor</i> was always a favourite spectacle with
  the public. The former carried an ample casting-net upon his shoulders, a
  three-pronged spear in his hand; beyond this he was totally unarmed either
  for attack or defence. The latter with a short sword, vizored helmet, and
  oblong shield, would at first sight appear to have fought at great advantage
  over his opponent. Nevertheless the arts of the <i>retiarius</i> in
  entangling his adversary had arrived at such perfection that he was
  constantly the conqueror. Once down, and involved in the fatal meshes, there
  was no escape for the swordsman; and from some whimsical reason the populace
  seldom granted him quarter when vanquished. Great activity and speed of foot
  were the principal qualities required by the <i>retiarius</i>, for if he
  failed in his cast he was compelled to fly from his adversary while preparing
  his net for a fresh attempt, and if overtaken his fate was sealed. Placidus
  possessed extraordinary personal activity. His eye was very correct, and his
  throw generally deadly. It may be, too, that there was something pleasing to
  the natural cruelty of his disposition in the contemplation of an antagonist
  writhing and helpless on the sand. It was his delight to figure in the arena
  with the deadly net laid in careful festoons upon his shoulder, and the long
  barbed trident quivering in his grasp. Licinius fell into the snare, if snare
  it was, readily enough.</p>

  <p>"I would wager a province on Esca," said he. "against anyone but a trained
  gladiator; and I think he could hold his own with the best of <i>them</i>,
  after a month's practice."</p>

  <p>"Then you accept my challenge?" exclaimed Placidus, with a studied
  carelessness of manner that dissembled an eagerness he could scarcely
  control.</p>

  <p>"Let us hear the terms over a fresh flask of Falernian," observed the
  Emperor, glad of such a stimulant with his wine.</p>

  <p>"I ask for no weapons but the trident and the net," said Placidus, looking
  fixedly at Licinius. "Esca, if you so call him, may be armed as usual with
  sword and helmet."</p>

  <p>"And shield," interrupted the other; too old a soldier, even in the
  excitement of the moment, to throw a chance away.</p>

  <p>Placidus affected to demur.</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "after a few moments' hesitation, "'tis but a young
  swordsman, and a barbarian; I give you the shield in."</p>

  <p>A vision crossed the brain of Licinius, that already made him repent of
  his rashness. He saw the fine form writhing in those pitiless meshes, like a
  beast taken in the toils. He saw the frank blue eyes, looking upward, brave
  and kindly even in their despair. He saw the unsparing arm raised to strike,
  and the bright curling locks dabbled all in blood. But then he remembered the
  Briton's extraordinary strength and activity, his natural courage and warlike
  education&mdash;he was irritated, too, by the insolent malice that gleamed in
  the tribune's eyes; and he persuaded himself that nothing but renown and
  triumph could accrue to his favourite from such a contest.</p>

  <p>"Be it so," said he; "<i>retiarius</i> and <i>secutor</i>. You will have
  no child's play, I can tell you; and now for the terms of the wager. I stake
  no man's life against a morsel of tinsel or a few polished pebbles, I warn
  you at once."</p>

  <p>He glanced while he spoke, somewhat contemptuously, over the costly
  ornaments that decorated the tribune's dress. The latter laughed good-
  humouredly.</p>

  <p>"A dozen slaves would scarce fetch the value of my sleeve-clasps. At
  least, a dozen of these islanders, whom you may capture by scores every time
  a legion moves its camp. Listen, I will wager two of my white horses against
  your picture of Daphne, or the bust of Euphrosyne that stands in your
  bath-room. Nay, I will give you more advantage still. I will stake the whole
  team, and the chariot into the bargain, against the British slave
  himself!"</p>

  <p>Again had the other been watching him narrowly; he must have perceived a
  strange suppressed eagerness on the tribune's face, but he was preoccupied
  and annoyed; he had gone too far to retract, and a murmur from the listening
  guests denoted their opinion of the generosity displayed in this last
  proposal. When a man has placed himself in a false position, his efforts at
  extrication generally plunge him deeper than before. Quick as lightning,
  Licinius bethought him that the present bargain might probably save Esca's
  life, in the unlikely event of his being conquered, so he closed with it
  unhesitatingly, though he regretted doing so a moment afterwards.</p>

  <p>The match was accordingly made upon the following terms: That Esca should
  enter the amphitheatre during the approaching games of Ceres, armed with
  sword, shield, and helmet, to oppose Placidus, whose only weapons were to be
  the trident and the net. That in the event of the latter being worsted, his
  four white horses and gilded chariot should become the property of Licinius;
  but that if he obtained the victory, and the populace permitted him to spare
  the vanquished, then his late antagonist should become his slave; and how
  enviable would be that position could only be known to the tribune himself
  and one other person from whom he had that day received kinder looks and
  smiles than she had ever before granted to an unwelcome suitor.</p>

  <p>The business of drinking, which had been somewhat interrupted by these
  complicated discussions, was now resumed with greater energy than before;
  Placidus emptying his goblet with the triumphant air of one who has
  successfully accomplished a difficult task; Licinius like a man who seeks to
  drown anxiety and self-reproach in wine. The Emperor quaffed and quaffed
  again with his habitual greediness; and the remainder of the guests acted
  studiously in imitation of the Emperor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-16"
     id="ch1-16">XVI</a>. &mdash; THE TRAINING-SCHOOL</h2>

  <p class="first">BUT Licinius had an ordeal to go through on the following
  day, which was especially painful to the kind heart of the Roman general.
  When the terms of the combat were explained to the person chiefly interested,
  that young warrior eagerly accepted the challenge as affording an opportunity
  for indulgence in those feats of arms which early education had rendered so
  pleasing to his martial disposition. He could vanquish two such men as the
  tribune, he thought, at any exercise and with any weapons; but his face sank
  when he learned the penalty of failure, and a shudder passed through his
  whole frame at the bare possibility of becoming a slave to anyone but his
  present master. It nerved him, however, all the more in his resolution to
  conquer; and when Licinius, reproaching himself bitterly the while, promised
  him his liberty in the event of victory, Esca's heart beat fast with joy and
  hope and exultation once more.</p>

  <p>A thousand vague possibilities danced through his brain; a thousand wild
  and visionary schemes, of which Mariamne formed the centre figure. Life that
  had seemed so dull but one short week ago, now shone again in the rosy light
  with which youth&mdash;and youth alone&mdash;can tinge the long perspective
  of the future. Alas for Licinius! he marked the glowing cheek and the
  kindling eye with a sensation of despondency weighing at his heart.
  Nevertheless the lot was cast, the offer was accepted. It was too late for
  looking back. Nothing remained but to strain every nerve to win.</p>

  <p>In all bodily contests, in all mental labours, in everything which human
  nature attempts, systematic and continuous training is the essential element
  of success. The palm, as Horace says, can only flourish where the dust is
  plentiful; and he who would attain a triumph either as an athlete or a
  scholar, must cultivate his natural abilities with the utmost attention, and
  the most rigid self-denial, ere he enters for the prize. It is curious, too,
  how the mind, like the body, acquires vigour and elasticity by graduated
  exertion. The task that was an impossibility yesterday, is but a penance
  to-day, and will become a pleasure to-morrow. Let us follow Esca into the
  training-school, where his muscles are to be toughened, and his skill
  perfected for the deadly exercises of the arena.</p>

  <p>It is a large square building, something like a modern riding-house,
  lighted and ventilated at the top, and is laid down three inches deep in
  sand, an arrangement which increases, indeed, the labour of all pedestrian
  exertion, but renders a fall comparatively harmless, and accustoms the pupil,
  moreover, to the yielding surface on which hereafter he will have to struggle
  for his life. Quoits, dumb-bells, ponderous weights, and massive clubs are
  scattered in the corners, or propped against the walls of the edifice, and a
  horizontal leaping-bar, placed at the height of a man's breast, denotes that
  activity is not neglected in the acquisition of strength. Beside these
  insignia of peaceful gymnastics, the <i>cestus</i> hangs conspicuous, and
  racks are placed at intervals supporting the deadly weapons and defensive
  armour with which the gladiator plies his formidable trade. There are also
  pointless spears, and blunted swords for practice, and a wooden figure,
  hacked and hewed out of all similitude to an enemy, on which the cuts and
  thrusts most in request have been dealt over and over again with increasing
  skill and severity.</p>

  <p>At one end of the building paces the master to and fro; now glancing with
  wary eye at the movements of his pupils; now pausing to adjust some implement
  of instruction; now encouraging or chiding with a gesture; and anon catching
  up, as though in sheer absence of mind, one of the idle weapons, and whirling
  it round his head with a flourish that displays all the power and skill of
  the practised professional. Hippias, the retired gladiator, is a man of
  middle age, and of somewhat lofty stature, rendered more commanding by its
  lengthy proportions, and the peculiar setting on of the head. Constant
  exercise, pushed, indeed, to the verge of toil, and continued for many years,
  has toughened each shapely limb into the hardness and consistency of wire,
  and has rendered his large frame lean and sinewy, like a greyhound's. All his
  gestures have the graceful pliant ease which results from muscular strength,
  and his very walk&mdash;light, smooth, and noiseless&mdash;is like that of a
  panther traversing the floor of its cage. His swarthy complexion has been
  deeply tanned by exposure to heat and toil, but the blood courses healthfully
  beneath, and imparts a warm mellow tint to the skin. The fleshless face, in
  spite of a worn eager look, and a dash of grey in the hair and beard, is not
  without a wild defiant beauty of its own; and though its expression is
  somewhat dissolute and reckless, there is a bold keen flash in the eye, and
  the man is obviously enterprising, courageous, and steel to the backbone.</p>

  <p>The Roman ladies, with that depravity of taste which marks a general
  deterioration of manners and morality, delighted at this period to choose
  their favourites from the ranks of the amphitheatre. There was a rage for
  warlike exercises, Amazonian dresses, imitations of the deadly sports, played
  out with considerable skill and ferocity, nay, for the very persons of the
  gladiators themselves. It was no wonder then, that the handsome
  fencing-master, with his reputation for strength and courage, should have
  been a marked man with the proud capricious matrons of the Imperial City. The
  favour of each, too, was doubtless his best recommendation to the good graces
  of the rest; and Hippias might have sunned himself in the smiles of the
  noblest ladies in Rome.</p>

  <p>He made but little account, however, of his good fortune. The peaches
  fallen on the ground are doubtless the ripest, yet they never seem so
  tempting as those which sun themselves against the wall, a hand's-breadth
  above our reach. Nor can a man pay implicit obedience to more than one
  dominion (at a time); and unless the yoke be very heavy, it is scarce worth
  while to carry it at all. Hippias was neither dazzled nor flattered by the
  bright eyes that looked so kindly into his war-worn face. He loved a flask of
  wine nearly as well as a woman's beauty&mdash;two feet of pliant steel and a
  leathern buckler far better than either; nevertheless, amongst all the dainty
  dames of his acquaintance, he was least disposed to undervalue Valeria's
  notice, the more so, that she rarely condescended to bestow it on him; and he
  took more pains with her fencing lessons, than those of any other female
  pupil, and stayed longer in her house than in that of any lady in Rome. He
  approved of her strength, her resolution, her quickness, above all her cold
  manner and her pride, besides admiring her personal charms exceedingly, in
  his own practical way. There is a gleam of interest, almost of tenderness in
  his eyes, as he pauses every now and then in his walk, and reads a line or
  two from a scroll he carries in his hand, which Myrrhina brought him not an
  hour ago.</p>

  <p>The scroll is from Valeria. She has heard of Esca's peril&mdash; nay, she
  has herself brought it on his head; and who knows the price it cost her
  haughty wilful heart? Yet in all her bitter anger, vexation, shame, she
  cannot bear to think of the noble Briton down on the sand, writhing and
  helpless at the mercy of his enemy. It is the weapon now she hates, and not
  the victim. It would give her intense pleasure, she feels, to see Placidus
  humbled, defeated, slain. Such is the sense of justice in a woman's breast;
  such are the advantages gained by submission at any sacrifice to do her
  bidding. We need not pity the tribune, however, in his dealings with either
  sex; he is well able to take care of himself.</p>

  <p>Valeria accordingly sat her down and wrote a few friendly lines to the
  fencing-master, who had always stood high in her favour, and whose frank bold
  nature she felt she could trust. Womanlike, she thought it necessary to
  fabricate an excuse for her interest in the Briton, by affirming that she had
  staked heavily on his success in the coming contest. She adjured Hippias to
  spare no pains in counsel or instruction, and bade him come to see her
  without delay, and report the progress of his pupil. He raised his eyes from
  the scroll, and watched the said pupil holding his own gallantly at sword and
  buckler with Lutorius.</p>

  <p>"One, two&mdash;Disengage the blade! A feint at the head, a cut at the
  legs, and come in over the shield with a lunge! Good! but scarce quick
  enough. Try that again&mdash;the elbow turned outwards, the wrist a little
  higher. So&mdash;once more. Now, look at me. Thus."</p>

  <p>The combatants paused for breath, Hippias seized a wooden foil, and,
  beckoning to Hirpinus, engaged him in the required position, for Esca's
  especial benefit. Trained and wary, the old gladiator knew every feint and
  parry in the game. Yet had those blades been steel, Hirpinus would have been
  gasping his life out, at the master's feet, ere the close of their second
  encounter. Hippias never shifted his ground, never seemed to exert himself
  much, yet the quickest eye in Rome was puzzled to follow the movements of his
  point, the readiest hand to intercept it where it fell. Again he pitted Esca
  and Lutorius in the mimic strife, and stood with well-pleased countenance to
  watch the result. The Briton had, indeed, lost no time in beginning a course
  of instruction which he hoped was to ensure him victory and its reward his
  much desired freedom. That morning Hirpinus had brought him to the school;
  and the veteran gladiator watched, with an interest that was almost touching,
  the preparations which were to fit his young friend for a career that at best
  must end ere long in a violent death. Hippias was delighted with the stature
  and strength of his new pupil. He had matched him at once with Lutorius, a
  wiry Gaul, who was supposed to be the most scientific swordsman of " the
  Family," and smiled to observe how completely, with an occasional hint from
  himself, the Briton was a match for his antagonist, who had expected an easy
  victory, and was even more disgusted than surprised. As the encounter was
  prolonged, and the combatants, warming to their work, advanced, retreated,
  struck, lunged and parried; now traversing warily at full distance&mdash;now
  dashing boldly in to close, the other gladiators gathered round, excited to
  unusual interest, by the excellence of the play, and the dexterity of the
  barbarian.</p>

  <p>"He is the best we've seen here for a lustre at least," exclaimed Rufus, a
  gigantic champion from Northern Italy, proud of his stature, proud of his
  swordsmanship, but above all, proud that he was a Roman citizen, though a
  gladiator; " those thrusts come home like lightning, and when he misses his
  parry, see, he jumps away like a wild-cat. Faith, Manlius, if they match him
  against thee at the games, thou wilt have a handful. I would stake my rights
  as a Roman citizen on him, toga and all, barbarian though he be. What, man!
  he would have thee down and disarmed in a couple of passes</p>

  <p>Manlius seemed to think so too, though he was loth to confess it. He
  turned the subject by vowing that Lutorius must be masking his play, and not
  fighting his best, or he never could be thus worsted by a novice.</p>

  <p>"Masking his play!" exclaimed Hirpinus indignantly, "let him unmask, then,
  as soon as he will! I tell thee this lad of mine hath not his match in the
  empire. I shall see him champion of the amphitheatre, and first swordsman in
  Rome, ere they give me the wooden foil with the silver guard,* and lay old
  Hirpinus on the shelf. I shall be satisfied to retire then, for I shall leave
  some good manhood to take my place."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The form by which a gladiator, who had repeatedly
  distinguished himself, received his dismissal and immunity from the arena for
  life.]</p>

  <p>"Well crowed!" replied Manlius, not quite pleased at the value placed on
  his own prowess in comparison. "To hear thee, a man would say there never was
  but one gladiator in Rome, and that this young mastiff must pull us all down
  by the throat, because he fences like thyself, wild and wide, and by main
  strength."</p>

  <p>"It is no swordsmanship to run in like a bull and take more than you
  give," observed Euchenor, listening with his arms folded, and an expression
  of supreme contempt on his handsome features.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless his blows fall thick and fast, like a hail-storm, and
  Lutorius shifts his ground every time the young one makes the attack," argued
  honest Rufus, who had not a grain of either fear or jealousy in his
  disposition; and who considered his profession as a mere trade by which he
  could obtain a livelihood for wife and children in the meantime, and a remote
  chance of independence with a vineyard of his own beyond the Apennines,
  should he escape a violent death in the amphitheatre at last.</p>

  <p>"He thrusts too often overhand," observed Manlius. "and his guard is
  always open for the wrist."</p>

  <p>"He is a strong fencer, but he has no style," added Euchenor; and the
  boxer looked around him with the air of a man who closes a controversy by an
  unanswerable argument.</p>

  <p>Hirpinus was boiling over with indignation; but his eloquence was by no
  means in proportion to his corporeal gifts, and he could not readily find
  words to express his dissent and his disdain. Banter, too, and a coarse,
  good-humoured sort of wrangling, was the usual form by which difference of
  opinion found expression in the training-school. Quarrelling, amongst men
  whose very trade it was to fight to the death, seemed simply absurd; and to
  come to blows except in public and for money, a mere childish waste of time.
  Indeed, with all their contempt for death, and their extraordinary courage
  when pitted against each other to amuse the populace, these gladiators,
  perhaps from the very nature of their profession, seem to have been unsuited
  for any sustained efforts of energy and endurance. When banded together under
  the eagles, they were often so undisciplined in camp, as by no means to be
  relied on before an enemy. Perhaps there was something of bravado in the
  flourish with which they entered the circus, and hailed Caesar with their
  greetings from <i>those about to die!</i>* Moreover, they had to fight in a
  corner, and with the impossibility of escape. Courage is of many different
  kinds. Men are brave from various motives from ambition, from emulation, from
  the habit of confronting danger; some from a naturally chivalrous
  disposition, backed by strong physical nerves. The last alone are to be
  trusted in an emergency; and a really courageous man faces an unexpected and
  unaccustomed peril, if not with confidence, at least with an unflinching
  determination to do his best.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The well-known "Morituri te salutant!" ]</p>

  <p>Hirpinus turned upon Euchenor, for whom he had no great liking at any
  time.</p>

  <p>"You talk of your science," said he. "and your Greek skill, against which
  even our Roman thews and sinews are of no avail. Dare you stand up to this
  barbarian with the <i>cestus</i> on? Only to exchange half a dozen friendly
  buffets, you know, in sheer sport."</p>

  <p>But Euchenor excused himself with great disdain. Like many another
  successful professor, be owed no inconsiderable share of his fame to his own
  assumption of superiority, and the judgment with which, when practicable, he
  matched himself against inferior performers. Champions who exist on their
  reputation, such as it is, are not to peril it lightly against the first tyro
  that comes, who has everything to gain and nothing to lose by an encounter
  with the celebrity; whereas the celebrity derives no additional laurels from
  a triumph, and a defeat tends to take the very bread out of his mouth.
  Euchenor said as much; but Hirpinus was not satisfied, till the subtle Greek,
  who had learned the terms of the match in which Esca was engaged, observed
  carelessly, that all the time the Briton had to spare should be devoted to
  practice in the part he was about to play before the Emperor. The suggestion
  took effect upon Hirpinus at once. He sprang across the school to where the
  master had resumed his walk. The old gladiator positively turned pale while
  he entreated Hippias to instruct his pupil in all the scientific devices by
  which those deadly meshes could be foiled.</p>

  <p>"Nothing but art can save him," said he, in imploring accents, which
  seemed almost ludicrous from one of his Herculean exterior. "Courage and
  strength, ay, and the activity of a wild-cat, are all paralysed when that
  accursed twine is round your limbs. I know it! I have felt it! I was down
  under the net myself once. If a man is to die, he should die <i>like</i> a
  man, not like a thrush caught in a springe. He must learn, Hippias, he must
  practise day by day, and hour by hour; he must study every movement of the
  caster. Pit him against Manlius, he is the best netsman in the Family. If he
  learns to foil <i>him</i>, he will take the conceit out of Placidus readily
  enough. I tell you I shall not be easy till I see him with his foot on the
  gay tribune's breast!"</p>

  <p>"Patience, man," replied Hippias. "thou fearest but one thing in the
  world, and that is a fathom of twine. Thinkest thou all others are scared at
  the same bugbear? Mind thine own training,&mdash;thou art yet too lusty by
  half to go into the circus,&mdash;and leave this young barbarian to me."</p>

  <p>The master kept up his influence amongst these lawless pupils, partly by a
  reserved demeanour and a silent tongue, partly by never suffering his
  authority to be disputed for a moment. To have said as much as he now did was
  tantamount to a confession of interest in the Briton's success; and Hirpinus
  resumed his own labours with a lightened heart, whilst Esca, in all the
  delightful flush of youth and health, and muscular strength developing itself
  by scientific practice, plied his antagonist with redoubled vigour, and
  enjoyed his pastime to the utmost.</p>

  <p>It was like taking an old friend by the hand to grasp a sword once
  more.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-17"
     id="ch1-17">XVII</a>. &mdash; A VEILED HEART</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR three whole days Mariamne had not set eyes on the
  Briton, so she felt listless and dispirited. Not that she acknowledged, even
  to herself, the necessity of Esca's presence, nor that she was indeed aware
  how much it had influenced her thoughts and actions ever since she had known
  him&mdash;a period that seemed now of indefinite length. She found herself
  perpetually recalling the origin and growth of their acquaintance; she dwelt
  with a strange pleasure on the gross insult offered her by Spado, which
  scarce seemed an agreeable subject of contemplation; nor, be sure, did she
  forget its prompt and satisfactory redress. She remembered every step of her
  subsequent walk home, and every syllable of their conversation in that hasty
  and agitated progress; nay, every look and gesture of her companion's and of
  her own. It pleased her to think of the favourable impression made on her
  father and his brother by their guest; and the earthen pitcher, from which
  she gave the latter to drink, assumed a new and unaccountable value in her
  eyes. Also she strolled to Tiberside, whenever she had a spare half-hour, and
  sat her down under the shadow of a broken column, with a strange persistency,
  and a vague expectation of something, she knew not what For the first day
  this dreamy imaginative existence was delightful. Then came a feeling of
  want; a consciousness that there was a void, which it would be a great
  happiness to fill. Soon this grew to a thirst&mdash;a craving for a
  repetition of those hours which had glided by so sweetly and so fast. At rare
  intervals arose the startling thought, "suppose she should never see him
  again," and her heart stopped beating, and her cheek paled with the bare
  possibility; yet was there something not wholly painful in a consciousness of
  the sorrow such a privation would create.</p>

  <p>Though young, Mariamne was no foolish and inexperienced girl. Her life had
  been calculated to elicit and bring to perfection some of woman's loftiest
  qualities. She had early learned the nobility of self-sacrifice, the
  necessity of self-reliance and self-denial. Like the generality of her nation
  she possessed considerable pride of race; suppressed, indeed, and kept down
  by the exigencies in which the Jews had so often found themselves, but none
  the weaker nor the less cherished on that account. Notwithstanding his many
  chastisements and reverses,&mdash;from his pilgrimage through the wilderness
  to his different captivities by the great Oriental powers, and final
  subjection under Rome,&mdash;the Jew never forgot that he sprang from a stem
  more especially planted by the hand of the Almighty; that he could trace his
  lineage back, unbroken and unstained, to those who held converse with Moses
  under the shadow of Mount Sinai; nay, to the Patriarch himself, who held his
  authority direct from Heaven, and who was thought worthy to entertain angels
  at his tent door on the plains of Mamre. Such a conviction imparted a secret
  pride to every one of his descendants. Man, woman, and child, were persuaded
  that to them belonged of right the dominion of the earth.</p>

  <p>It may be supposed that one of Eleazar's disposition was not likely to
  bring up his family in any humble notions of their privileges and their
  importance. Mariamne had been early taught to consider her nationality as the
  first and dearest of her advantages; and, womanlike, she clung to it all the
  closer that her people had been forced to submit to the Roman yoke. Habits of
  patience, of reflection and endurance, had been engendered by the everyday
  life of the Jewish maiden, witnessing her father's continued impatience of
  the existing state of things, and his energetic, though secret, efforts to
  change the destinies of his countrymen; whilst all that such an education
  might have created of hard, cunning, and unfeminine in his daughter's mind,
  the society and counsels of Calchas were eminently qualified to counteract.
  Losing no opportunity of sowing the good seed; of teaching, both by precept
  and example, the lessons he had learned from those who had them direct from
  the Fountain-head; it was impossible to remain long uninfluenced by the
  constant kindliness and gentle bearing of one who understood Christianity to
  signify, not only faith, and purity, and devotion even to the death, but also
  that peace and goodwill amongst men, which its first teachers inculcated as
  its fundamental principle and essential element. Calchas, indeed, lacked not
  the fiery energy and the tameless instincts of his race. His nature, perhaps,
  was originally fierce and warlike as his brother's, but it had been subdued,
  softened, exalted by his religion; and, while his heart was pitiful and
  kindly, nothing remained of the warrior but his loyalty, his courage, and his
  zeal.</p>

  <p>Cherishing a true attachment for that brother, it was doubtless a cause of
  daily sorrow to observe how totally Eleazar's principles and conduct were
  opposed to the meek and holy precepts of the new faith. It seemed to human
  reasoning impossible to convert the Jew from his grand and simple creed, to
  modify or to explain it, to add to it, or to take away from it, in the
  slightest degree to alter his belief in that direct thearchy, to which he was
  bound by the ties of gratitude, of tradition, of national isolation and
  characteristic pride of race. A religion which accepts the first great
  principles of truth, the omnipotence and eternity of the Deity, the
  immortality of souls, and the rewards and punishments of a life to come,
  stands already upon a solid basis from which it has little inclination to be
  removed; and in all ages, the Jew, as in a somewhat less degree the
  Mahometan, has been most unwilling to add to his own stern tenets the mild
  and loving doctrines of our revealed religion. Eleazar's was a character to
  which the outward and tangible ceremonials of his worship were essentially
  acceptable. To him the law, in its severest and most literal sense, was the
  only true guide for political measures as for private conduct; and where its
  burdens were multiplied or its severities enhanced by tradition, he upheld
  the latter gladly and inflexibly. To offer the sacrifices ordained by Divine
  command; to exact and rigidly fulfil the minutest points of observance which
  the priests enjoined; to keep the Sabbath inviolate by word and deed; also,
  when opportunity offered, to smite the heathen hip-and-thigh with the edge of
  the sword; these were the points of faith and practice on which Eleazar took
  his stand, and from which no consideration of affection, no temptation of
  ambition, no exigency of the times, would have induced him to waver one
  hair's-breadth. The fiercest soldier, the wildest barbarian, the most
  frivolous and dissolute patrician of the Imperial Court, would have been a
  more promising convert than such a man as this. Yet did not Calchas despair:
  well he knew that there is a season of seed-time and a season of harvest,
  that the soil once choked with weeds, or sown with tares, may thereafter
  produce a good crop; that waters have been known to flow freely from the bare
  rock, and that nothing is impossible under heaven. So he loved his brother
  and prayed for him, and took that brother's daughter to his heart as though
  she had been his own child.</p>

  <p>It must have required no small patience, no small amount of self-control
  and humility, to engraft in Mariamne the good fruit, which her father held in
  such hatred and disdain. These, too, were difficulties with which the early
  Christians had to contend, and of which we now make small account We read of
  their privations, their persecutions, their imprisonments, and their
  martyrdoms, with a thrill of mingled horror and indignation&mdash;we pity and
  admire, we even glorify them as the heroic leaders of that forlorn hope which
  was destined to head the armies of the only true conqueror, but we never
  consider the daily and harassing warfare in which they must have been
  engaged, the domestic dissensions, the insults of equals, the alienation of
  friends; above all, the cold looks and estranged affections of those whom
  they loved best on earth; whom they must give up here, and whom, with the new
  light that had broken in on them, they could scarce hope to see hereafter.
  So-called heroic deeds are not always deserving of that superiority which
  they claim over mortal weakness, when emblazoned on the glowing page of
  history. Many a man is capable, so to speak, of winding himself up for one
  great effort, even though it be to perish on the scaffold or the breach; but
  day after day, and year after year, to wage unceasing war against our nearest
  and dearest, our own comforts, our own prosperity, nay, our own weaknesses
  and inclinations, requires the aid of a sustaining power that is neither
  without nor within, nor anywhere below on earth, but must reach the suppliant
  directly and continuously from above.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless the example of a true Christian, in the real acceptation of
  the word, is never without its effect on those who live under its constant
  influence. Even Eleazar loved and respected his brother more than anything on
  earth, save his ambition and his creed; while Mariamne, whose trusting and
  gentle disposition rendered her a willing recipient of those truths which
  Calchas lost no opportunity of imparting, gradually, and almost insensibly,
  imbibed the opinions and the belief of one whose everyday practice was so
  pure, so elevated, and so kindly; to whom, moreover, she was accustomed to
  look as her counsellor in difficulty, and her refuge in distress.</p>

  <p>It was Calchas, then, whose studies she interrupted as he sat with the
  scroll before him, that was seldom out of his hand, perusing those Syriac
  characters again and again, as a mariner consults his chart, never weary of
  storing information for his future course, and verifying the progress he has
  already made. It was to Calchas she had determined to apply for comfort
  because Esca came not, and for assistance to see him again&mdash;not that she
  admitted, even to herself, that this was her intention or her wish.
  Nevertheless, she hovered about the old man's seat, more caressingly than
  usual, and finding his attention still riveted on his employment, she laid
  one hand lightly on his shoulder, and with the other parted the thin grey
  hair that strayed across his forehead. He looked up with a pleasant
  smile.</p>

  <p>"What is it, little one?" said he, with the endearing diminutive he had
  used in addressing her from her childhood. "You seem unusually busy with your
  household affairs to-day. Is this room to be decorated for a guest? My
  brother makes no acquaintances here in Rome; and we have given no stranger so
  much as a mouthful of food since we arrived, save that goodly barbarian you
  brought home with you the other evening. Is he coming again to-night?"</p>

  <p>A bright blush swept over her face, yet when it faded, Calchas could not
  but remark that she was paler than her wont; and her manner, usually so
  gentle and composed, was now restless, anxious, and ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"Nay," she replied. "what should I know of the barbarian's movements? It
  was but a chance meeting that led him to our quiet dwelling in the first
  instance; and save by the merest accident we are never likely to see him
  more."</p>

  <p>She turned away while she spoke, trying to steady her voice and give it a
  tone of cold indifference, but failing utterly in the attempt.</p>

  <p>"There is no such power as chance," said Calchas, looking her keenly in
  the face.</p>

  <p>"I know it," replied Mariamne, smiling sadly; "and I know, too, that
  whatever befalls us is for the best. Yet some things are hard to bear,
  nevertheless. Not that I have aught to complain of," she added, shrinking
  instinctively from the very topic she wanted to bring on. "save my constant
  anxiety for my father in these tumultuous times."</p>

  <p>"He is in God's hand," said Calchas. "who will bring him safe through all
  his perils, though they seem now to environ him as the breakers boil round a
  stranded galley, when the wild Adriatic is leaping and dashing for its prey.
  Take comfort, little one; I cannot bear to see your step so listless and your
  cheek so pale."</p>

  <p>"How can they be otherwise?" returned the girl, not very candidly. "It is
  a weary lot to be a soldier's daughter. I could even find it in my heart to
  wish we had never left Judaea; never come to Rome."</p>

  <p>He tried his best to soothe and comfort her&mdash;his best such as it was,
  for the good old man knew but little of a woman's heart&mdash;its wild hopes,
  its indefinite aims, its wayward feelings, and its inexplicable tendency to
  self-torture. He thought in his simplicity the real grievance was that which
  she avowed, and he strove to remove it in his own kind hopeful way.</p>

  <p>"My child," said he. "the evils that are raging in Italy, the horrors that
  we hear of every day, cannot but make Eleazar's position more important and
  less hazardous, as they increase the difficulties of the imperial councils.
  It is, indeed, no child's play to bridle such a nation as ours with one hand,
  and to grasp at the imperial diadem with the other. It takes a bold heart to
  draw the sword against Judah, and a long arm to buffet Caesar across the
  seas. Vespasian will have little leisure to persecute our race; and the
  Emperor, sore beset as he is, will surely lend a favourable ear to my
  brother's proposals for peace. Even now the legions are declaring, far and
  wide, against Vitellius; and civil war, the most dreadful of all scourges, is
  desolating the provinces and entering Italy herself. It was but yesterday
  that news reached Rome of the revolt of the whole fleet at Ravenna and ere
  this Cremona has perhaps fallen into the power of Antonius, that
  soldier-orator, with the iron arm and the silver tongue. Well we know, for we
  have been told by One whose words shall never be forgotten, that a house
  divided against itself cannot stand; and is this a time, think you, my child,
  for the worn-out sensualist who wears the purple here, to make conditions
  with such a man as your father? It is all in God's hand, as I never cease to
  insist; yet I cannot but feel that a better day must at last be dawning upon
  Judaea, that her enemies will be confounded, her armies victorious, and her
  chiefs&mdash;but what have we to do with the sword?" he broke off abruptly,
  while his kindling eye and animated gestures bore witness to the ardent
  spirit that would flash out here and there even now. "Our weapon is the
  Cross, our warfare is not of this world, our triumph is in our humility, and
  when most we are brought low, then are we most exalted. Oh, that the time
  were come, as come it surely will, when Caesar shall be content to take only
  that which is Caesar's, and men shall be gathered under one banner, and in
  one brotherhood, from all corners of the world!"</p>

  <p>It was no exaggerated account Calchas thus gave of the dilemma in which
  the empire was placed at this juncture. Vespasian, with great political
  talents, with coolness, patience, and audacity, was playing a game against
  which the besotted brains of Vitellius were powerless to compete. The former,
  adored by the army, who saw in him a successful general, an intrepid soldier,
  and a man of simple virtuous habits, contrasting nobly with the luxurious
  gluttony and sensuality of his rival, lost none of his influence by the
  moderation he displayed, and the modesty, real or affected, with which he
  declined the purple. Not afraid to wait till advantage ripened into
  opportunity, he could seize it when the time came with a bold and tenacious
  grasp, could turn it deftly to his own profit and guide those circumstances
  of which he seemed to be the mere puppet, with a master-hand. Though at a
  distance from the scene of warfare, and to all appearance little more than an
  unwilling observer of the disturbances carried on in his name, he directed as
  it were from behind a curtain the operations of his generals, and pulled the
  strings that set in motion his numerous partisans with a clear head, a
  delicate touch, and that tenacity of purpose which is the essential element
  of success. Vitellius, on the other hand, whose natural abilities had been
  weakened, nay destroyed, by an unceasing course of sensual gratification,
  wavered in council and hesitated in action; now determined to abdicate the
  diadem and retire into obscurity; anon persuaded to fight for dominion to the
  death; and ever paralysing the energies of his warmest partisans by the
  distrust he entertained for honest advisers, and the reliance he placed on
  the counsels of those traitors who surrounded him.</p>

  <p>The empire was, perhaps, at this period in a more disheartening position
  than even under the ferocious sway of Nero. Monster as the latter was, he at
  least held the reins with a firm hand; and tyranny, however oppressive, is
  doubtless one degree better than anarchy and confusion. Now, the mighty
  fabric, of which Romulus laid the first stone and Augustus completed the
  pinnacle&mdash;the work of seven centuries, to which every generation had
  added its labours and its enterprise, till it embraced the confines of the
  known world was beginning perceptibly to sink and crumble from its own
  enormous size and weight. The legions (and it must never be forgotten that
  the dominion of Rome was essentially that of the sword) were now recruited
  from natives of her distant colonies. The Syrian and the Ethiop guarded the
  eagles as well as the tall turbulent sons of Germany, and the ever-changing,
  ever-faithless Gaul. Armies thus gathered under one standard from such
  various climates could have but little in common save a certain, professional
  ferocity, and an ardent liking for plunder, no less than pay. Mercenaries
  have in all ages been easily bought by the one and seduced by the other. Each
  legion gradually came to consider itself a separate and independent power, to
  be sold to the highest bidder. Perhaps the fairest vision of all was a march
  upon Rome, and a ten hours' sack of the city they were sworn to defend. A
  great and good man, backed by the glory of name, race, and illustrious
  actions, could alone have ruled such discordant elements, and united these
  conflicting interests for the common good; but fate ordained that the weak,
  worn-out, besotted Vitellius should be seated on the throne of the Caesars,
  and that the cool, unflinching, and far-seeing Vespasian should be watching
  with sleepless eye and ready hand to snatch the diadem from his bewildered
  predecessor, and place it firmly on his own head.</p>

  <p>While the destinies of the world were thus trembling in the balance, while
  her own nation was fighting for its very existence, and the storm gathering
  all around, obviously to burst in its greatest fury on the Imperial City, the
  care that weighed heaviest at Mariamne's heart was that she had that day
  noticed a barbarian slave walk into the training-school of a Roman
  gladiator.</p>

  <p>"Is it true, then," asked the girl. "that civil war is indeed raging here,
  as we have seen it at home? That we shall have an enemy ere long at the very
  gates of the city?"</p>

  <p>"Too true, my child," replied Calchas; "and the Roman people seem, as
  usual, to make light of the emergency, to eat, drink, buy, sell, and feast
  their eyes on bloodshed in the circus, as though their idolatrous temple,
  where Janus overlooks the usurers and money-changers of the city, were shut
  up once for all, never to be opened again."</p>

  <p>She turned pale and shuddered at the mention of the circus.</p>

  <p>"Are they making no preparations?" she asked timidly. "Did I not hear my
  father say they were collecting the gladiators, and&mdash;and&mdash;some of
  the nobles had enrolled their German and British slaves, and were arming them
  against an attack?"</p>

  <p>"It may be so," answered Calchas; "but a slave can scarcely be expected to
  fight very stoutly for a cause which only serves to rivet his chains. As for
  the gladiators, those tigers in human form, it were surely better for them to
  perish in open warfare, than to tear one another to pieces in the arena, like
  the very beasts against which I have seen them pitted. Yet these, too, have
  souls to be saved."</p>

  <p>"Surely have they," exclaimed Mariamne, with kindling eyes. "and none to
  help them; none to show them so much as a glimpse of the true light. These
  men go out to die as the citizen goes to his business or his bath; and who is
  answerable to man for their blood? who is answerable to God for their
  souls?"</p>

  <p>His eye brightened while she spoke, and he raised his head like a soldier
  who hears the trumpet summoning him to the front.</p>

  <p>"If I have a well in my court," said he, "and a man fall down and die of
  thirst at my gate, who is answerable? Surely I am guilty of my brother's
  blood, that I never so much as reached him the pitcher to drink. Shall these
  men go down daily to death, and shall I not stretch out a finger lest they
  perish everlastingly? Mariamne, it seems there is a task set to my hand, and
  I must accomplish it."</p>

  <p>She was far from wishing to hinder him. Actuated as human nature too often
  is by mixed motives, she could yet respond, in her womanly generosity of
  heart, to that noble self-sacrifice which was so distinguishing a
  characteristic of the new religion; and could appreciate the devotion of
  Calchas, while she hoped through his intervention to obtain some alleviation
  of her anxiety on Esca's behalf. She had caught a glimpse of the slave's
  figure that very day as it entered the portals of the training-school; and
  this rapid glance had not served to quiet her misgivings on his account.</p>

  <p>If Calchas should now think it right to interest himself about a class of
  men the most reckless and desperate of the whole Roman population, it was
  probable that he would at the same time learn something of Esca's movements;
  perhaps be able to dissuade him from joining the fierce band in which she now
  feared he was about to be enrolled. "It may be that he has some wild hope of
  thus obtaining his liberty," thought the girl; and her heart throbbed while
  she reflected that it was for her sake liberty had now become so dear to the
  barbarian. "It may be that he has extorted some vague promise from his lord,
  and, in his pride of strength and courage, he never dreams of danger or
  defeat; but oh! if he should come to harm for my sake, what will become of
  me? I would rather die a thousand times than that his white skin should be
  disfigured with a scratch!"</p>

  <p>"They are practising for their deadly pastime in the next street," said
  she; "I can hear the blows as I go down to draw water. Blows dealt, as it
  were, in sport; what must they be in earnest?"</p>

  <p>"There is no time to be lost," said Calchas. "The games of Ceres are to be
  soon celebrated, and the Roman crowd will think it but a poor show if some
  hundreds of gladiators are not slaughtered at the least. Child, I will visit
  these men to-morrow; they will revile me, but after a time they will listen.
  If I can even gain over one, be he the lowest and most degraded of the band,
  it will be a triumph greater than a thousand victories; a gain infinitely
  more precious than all the treasures of Rome."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow may be too late," she returned, moving across the room at the
  same time so as to hide her face. "The school is full to-day. I&mdash;I think
  I saw that barbarian who was here lately go into it an hour or two ago."</p>

  <p>"The Briton!" exclaimed Calchas, starting from his seat. "Why did you not
  tell me so before? Quick, girl, fetch me my gown and sandals. I will go there
  without delay."</p>

  <p>She helped him, nothing loth. In a few minutes Calchas was ready to go
  forth, and as she watched him from the door, and saw him turn the corner of
  the street, Mariamne clasped her hands and muttered a thanksgiving for the
  success of her well-meant artifice; while the old man strode boldly to his
  destination, confident in the integrity of his purpose, and rejoicing in the
  breastplate of proof which covers a good heart bound on a pious mission. "It
  is no business of mine," was a maxim unknown to the early Christian. Fresh in
  his memory was the parable of the Good Samaritan; and it never occurred to
  him that, like the Pharisee, he might pass by on the other side. The world is
  some centuries older, yet is that tale of the friendless wounded wayfarer
  less suggestive now than it was then?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-18"
     id="ch1-18">XVIII</a>. &mdash; WINGED WORDS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE gladiators were pausing from their toil. Brawny chests
  heaved and panted, deep voices laughed and swore with returning breath;
  strong arms looked heavier and stronger as the athlete rested his wide hands
  upon his hips, and not unconsciously brought his huge muscles into full
  relief in the attitude. Esca and his late antagonist were wiping the sweat
  from their brows, and looking at one another with wistful eyes, as if by no
  means loth to renew the contest, so equally had the last bout been waged.
  Hirpinus laid down the weighty clubs he had been wielding, with a grunt of
  relief. No unpractised arm could have lifted those cumbrous instruments from
  the ground, yet they were but as reeds in the hands of the gladiator;
  nevertheless, he lamented piteously the tendency of his mighty frame to
  increasing bulk, which rendered such heavy and uninteresting work necessary
  to fit him for the arena.</p>

  <p>"By the body of Hercules!" complained the giant. "I would I were but such
  a half-starved ape as thou, my Lutorius! See what the master calls training
  for a man of some solidity, and thank the gods that an hour's girls'-play
  with sword and buckler is enough to keep that slender waist of thine within
  the compass of a knight's finger-ring."</p>

  <p>"Girls'-play, call you it?" answered Lutorius. "In faith 'tis a game that
  would put thy fat carcass on the sand, from sheer want of breath, in a
  quarter of the time. No more girls'-play for us, my lads, till after the
  feast of Ceres. The school will be thinner then, or I am mistaken. How many
  pairs are promised by the Consul for this coming bout? I heard the crier tell
  us in the street, but I have forgotten."</p>

  <p>"One hundred at least, for sword and buckler alone. And twenty of them out
  of the Family!" answered Euchenor readily, and with a malicious smile. His
  profession as a boxer freed him from any fatal apprehensions; but he took
  none the less pleasure in recalling to his comrades the more deadly nature of
  their encounters. Rufus alone looked grave; perhaps he was thinking of his
  wife and children while he listened; perhaps that humble cottage in the
  Apennines seemed farther off than ever, and the more desirable on that
  account. The others smiled grimly, and a wolfish expression gleamed for an
  instant from their eyes all but Esca, whose glowing young face displayed only
  courage, excitement, and hope.</p>

  <p>"Bird of ill-omen!" said Hippias sternly. "What do you know of the clash
  of steel? Keep to your own boys'-play, and do not meddle with the game that
  draws blood at every stroke. I think I am master here!"</p>

  <p>Euchenor would have answered sullenly, but a knock at the door arrested
  his attention. As it swung open, to the surprise of all, and of none more
  than Esca, Calchas stood before them.</p>

  <p>"<i>Salve!</i>" said the old man kindly, as he looked around, his
  venerable head and calm dignified bearing contrasting nobly with the brute
  strength and coarser faces of the gladiators. "<i>Salve!</i>" he repeated,
  smiling at the astonishment his appearance seemed to call forth.</p>

  <p>Hippias was not lacking in a certain rough courtesy of the camp. He
  advanced to the new-comer, bade him welcome as a stranger, and inquired the
  cause of his visit; "for," said he. "judging by your looks, O my father! it
  can scarcely be a mission connected either with me or my disciples here,
  whose trade, you may observe, is war."</p>

  <p>"I too am a soldier," answered Calchas quietly, looking the astonished
  fencing-master full in the face. The gladiators had by this time gathered
  round; like schoolboys at play they were ripe for mischief, and, like
  schoolboys, it needed but the merest trifle to urge them into any extreme,
  either of good or evil.</p>

  <p>"A soldier!" exclaimed Euchenor. "then you fear not steel!"&mdash;at the
  same moment he snatched a short two-edged sword from the wall, and delivered
  a thrust with it full at the old man's breast. Calchas moved not a muscle;
  his colour neither rose nor fell; his eyelash never quivered as he looked
  steadily at the Greek, who probably only intended a brutal jest, and cared
  but little how dangerous might be its result. The point had reached the folds
  of the visitor's gown, when Rufus dashed it aside with his hand, while
  Hippias dealt the offender a buffet, which sent him reeling to the opposite
  wall.</p>

  <p>"What now?" exclaimed the professor, in a tone with which a man rates a
  disobedient hound. "What now? Am I not master here?"</p>

  <p>The others looked on approvingly. The jest was well-suited to their
  habits. They were amused at the discomfiture of the Greek, and pleased with
  the coolness shown by an old man of such unwarlike exterior. Esca, however,
  strode up to his friend's side, and glared about him in a manner that boded
  no good to the originator of any more such aggressions, either in sport or
  earnest.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast hurt the youth," remarked Calchas, in as unmoved a tone as
  would have become the fiercest gladiator of the school. "Thou hast hurt him,
  and he was but in jest after all. In truth, Hippias, I have not seen so
  goodly a buffet dealt since I came to Rome. That arm of thine can strike to
  some purpose, and thy pupils are, like their master, brave, and strong, and
  skilful. I have heard of the legion called Invincible, surely I have found it
  here. My sons, are you not the Invincibles?"</p>

  <p>He spoke so quietly they knew not whether he was jesting with them; but
  the flattering title tickled their ears pleasantly enough, and the gladiators
  crowded round him, with shouts of encouragement and mirth.</p>

  <p>"Invincibles!" they laughed. "Invincibles! Well said, old man! yes, we are
  the Invincibles. Who can stand against the Family? Hast come to join us? We
  shall have plenty of space in the ranks ere another moon be old."</p>

  <p>"Give him a sword, one of you!" exclaimed Rufus; "let us see what he can
  do with Lutorius. The Gaul has had a bellyful already; press him, old man,
  and he must go down!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, let him have a bout with the wooden foils," laughed Hirpinus. "He is
  but young and tender. He would sicken at the sight of blood."</p>

  <p>"Or a cast with the net and trident," continued Manlius.</p>

  <p>"Or a round with the <i>cestus</i>" observed Euchenor; adding with a
  sneer. "I myself am ready to exchange a buffet or two with him, for sheer
  goodwill."</p>

  <p>"Hold! my new comrades," interposed Esca, with rising colour. "In my
  country we are taught to venerate grey hairs. If ye are so keen for
  <i>cestus</i>, lance, and sword-play, here am I, untried and inexperienced,
  willing to stand against the best of you, from now till sundown."</p>

  <p>The gladiators gathered round the last speaker somewhat angrily; the
  challenge was indeed a bold one in such company, and a contest begun in play
  amongst those turbulent spirits, might end, not improbably, in too fatal
  earnest; but Hippias cut the matter short by commanding silence, in loud
  imperious tones, and, turning to the newcomer, bade him state at once the
  business that had brought him there and have done with it.</p>

  <p>"I came here," said the old man, looking round with a glance of mingled
  pity and admiration; "I came here to see, with my own eyes, the band of
  Invincibles. I have already told you that I too am a soldier, whose duty it
  is to go down, if need be, daily unto death."</p>

  <p>There was something so quiet and earnest in the speaker's manner, such an
  absence of self-consciousness or apprehension, a sincerity and goodwill so
  frank and evident, that the rude fierce men whom he addressed could not but
  give him their attention. There was all the interest of novelty in beholding
  one whose appearance and habits were so at variance with their own, thus
  throwing himself fearlessly on their forbearance, and trusting, as it were,
  to that higher nature, which, dormant though it might be, each man felt to
  exist within himself. Even Hippias acknowleged the influence of his visitor's
  confidence, and answered graciously enough&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If you are a soldier, I need not tell you that we are but on the drill-
  ground here. You will see my band to better advantage when they defile by
  Caesar at the games of Ceres."</p>

  <p>Calchas looked inquiringly round.</p>

  <p>"And the chorus," said he. "that I have heard ring out in such a warlike
  tone, as your ranks marched past the imperial chair; are you perfect in it,
  my friends? Do you practise the chant as you do your sword-play and your
  wrestling?"</p>

  <p>He had fixed their attention now. Half-interested, half-amused at his
  strange persistency, they looked laughingly at each other, and their deep
  voices burst out into the wild and thrilling cadence of their fatal
  dirge&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Ave, Caesar! Morituri te salutant!</i></p>

  <p>As the last notes died away, silence pervaded the school; to the rudest
  and most reckless, there was something suggestive in the sounds they knew too
  well would be the last music they should hear on earth. Calchas turned
  suddenly upon Hippias.</p>

  <p>"And the wages Caesar gives your men?" said he; "since he buys them body
  and bones, they must be very costly. How many thousand sesterces doth he pay
  for each?"</p>

  <p>A brutal laugh echoed round him at the question.</p>

  <p>"Sesterces!" answered Hippias. "Nay; Caesar's generosity provides
  handsomely for the training and nourishment of his swordsmen."</p>

  <p>"True enough!" added Rufus, at which there was another laugh. "He finds us
  in meat, and drink, and burial!"</p>

  <p>"No more?" said Calchas. "Yet I have been told that in Rome everything
  fetches its price; but little did I think such men as these could be bought
  for less money than a Syrian dancing-girl, or a senator's white horses. So
  you are willing to toil day after day, harder than the peasant on the
  hillside, or the oarsman in the galley, to live simply, temperately, ay,
  virtuously, for months together, and then to face certain death, often in its
  ghastliest form, for the wages a Roman citizen gives his meanest
  slave&mdash;a morsel of meat and a draught of wine! If you conquer in the
  struggle, a branch of palm may be added to a handful of silver, and you deem
  your reward is more than enough. Truly, I am old and feeble, these hands are
  little worth to strike or parry, yet would I grudge to sell this worn-out
  body of mine at so mean a price."</p>

  <p>"You told us you were a soldier," observed Rufus, on whom the argument of
  relative value seemed to make no slight impression.</p>

  <p>"So I am," replied Calchas; "but not at such a low rate of pay as yours.
  My duties are not heavy. I am not forced to toil all day, nor to watch all
  night. My head aches with no weighty helmet; breastplate and greaves of steel
  do not gall my body nor cumber my limbs. I have neither trench to dig, nor
  mound to raise, nor eagles to guard. I need not stand, like you, against my
  comrade and my friend, with my point at his throat, and slay the man who has
  been to me even as a brother, lest he slay me. Yet, though my labours be so
  easy, and my service be so deficient and inadequate, all the gold and jewels
  you have seen glistening in a triumph, all the treasures of Caesar and of
  Rome, would not equal the reward I hope to earn."</p>

  <p>The gladiators looked from one to the other with glances of astonishment
  and curiosity. This was a subject that spoke to their personal interest, and
  roused their feelings accordingly.</p>

  <p>"Are there vacancies in your ranks, comrade?" asked Hirpinus, using the
  military form of speech habitually affected by his profession. "Will you
  enrol a man of muscle like myself, who has been looking all his life for a
  service in which there is little to do and plenty to get? Take my word for
  it, you will not long want for recruits."</p>

  <p>"There is room for all, and to spare," answered Calchas, raising his voice
  till it rung through every corner of the building. "My Captain will enlist
  you freely, and without reserve. Only you come to Him and range yourselves
  under His banner, and stand by Him for a few short watches, a week, a month,
  a decade or two of years at the most, and He will stand by you when Caesar
  and his legions are scattered to the four winds of heaven; ay, and long after
  that, for ages and ages rolling on in a circle that has no end! Will you
  come, brave hearts? I have authority to receive you, man by man."</p>

  <p>"Where is your Captain?" asked Hirpinus. "He must needs have a large
  following. Is he here in Rome? Can we see him ere we take the oaths and raise
  the standard? Comrades!" he added, looking round. "this old man speaks as
  though he were in earnest. Nay, he would scarcely dare to laugh in our very
  beards!"</p>

  <p>"You might have seen Him," answered Calchas. "not forty years ago, as I
  myself did, on the sunny plains of Syria. You will not see Him now, till a
  pinch of dust has been sprinkled on your brow, and the death-penny put into
  your mouth. Then, when you have crossed the dark river, He will be waiting
  for you on the other side."</p>

  <p>The gladiators looked at one another. "What means he?" said they. "Is he
  mad?" "Is he an augur?" "Doth he deal in magic?" Rufus reared his tall head
  above the throng. "Would you have us believe in what we cannot see?" was the
  apposite question of that practical swordsman. The old man drew his mantle
  round his shoulders with the air of one who prepares for argument. All he
  wanted was a fair hearing.</p>

  <p>"Which is the nobler gift," he asked. "a strong body, or a gallant heart?
  Ye have fought many times, most of you, in the arena. Answer me
  truly&mdash;which is the conqueror, courage or strength?"</p>

  <p>"Courage," they exclaimed, with one voice; all except Euchenor, who
  muttered something about skill and good fortune being preferable to
  either.</p>

  <p>"And yet you cannot see it," resumed Calchas. "Will you therefore argue
  that it cannot exist? Is there one of you here that doth not feel a something
  wanting to complete his daily existence? Why do you long for the smiles of
  women, and the bubble of the winecup? Why can you not rest when the training
  of to-day is over, for thinking of the labours of to-morrow? Why are you
  always anxious, always anticipating, always dissatisfied? Because a man
  consists of two parts, the body and the spirit; because his life is made up
  of two phases, the present and the future. Your bodies belong to Caesar, let
  him have them to do with them what he likes, to-day, to-morrow, at the games
  of Ceres, at the feast of Neptune, what matter? But the spirit, the man
  within you, is your own. He it is who doth not wince when the javelin pierces
  to the quick, or the wild beast rends to the marrow. He it is who quails not
  when the level sweep of sand seems to rock beneath him, and heave up against
  his face; when the white garments and eager faces of the crowd spin round him
  faster and faster as they fade upon his darkening eye. He is the better man
  of the two, and he will live for ever. Shall you not provide for him'} What
  is your present? Much trouble, many hours of toil. A foot or two of steel in
  the hand, and a dash at a comrade's throat, then a back-fall below the
  equestrian benches, and so the future begins. Do you think there is nothing
  better there than old Charon's ferry-boat, and the pale misty banks of the
  uncertain river? I know the way to a golden land far brighter and fairer than
  the fabled islands of the West. There is a high wall round it, and the gate
  is low and narrow; but the key stands in the lock, and you need no
  death-penny to purchase entrance for the poorest of you. Go to the door in
  rags, with no other possession but the hope and trust that you may crawl in
  upon your knees, and it opens ere you have knocked."</p>

  <p>Something in each man's heart told him, as he listened, that if he could
  but believe this, the conviction was worth more than all the treasures of the
  empire put together. Liable as were these gladiators to stand in the jaws of
  death at a day's notice, there was something inexpressibly elevating in the
  idea that the supreme moment which the most careless of them could not but
  sometimes picture to himself, was the mere passage to a nobler state of
  existence. The words of a man who is telling what he himself implicitly
  believes to be the truth, carry with them no small amount of persuasion; and
  when Calchas paused, the swordsmen looked doubtingly at him with eyes in
  which incredulity and admiration were strangely mingled; not without a
  certain wistful gleam of hope. Hippias, indeed, whose tastes inclined him to
  materialism, and his reflections to utter disbelief in everything save the
  temper of a blade, seemed disposed to cut the matter short, as being a waste
  of valuable time; but the anxiety of his pupils, and especially of Esca, to
  hear more of the glowing promises held out, induced him to fold his arms and
  listen, with a smile of conscious superiority, not devoid of contempt.</p>

  <p>"And the Captain who leads us?" asked the Gaul, after a whisper and a push
  from Hirpinus. "What of him? Your promises are fair enough, I grant you, but
  I would fain know with whom I serve."</p>

  <p>Not one of them but noted the gleam on the old man's face, as he
  replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The Captain went up to death with a patient, calm, and kindly face, for
  you, and you, and you, and me for those who had never seen Him; for those who
  mistrusted Him; for those who failed Him, and turned back from Him at His
  need. Nay, for those who tortured and slew Him, and whom He forgave with the
  free full forgiveness of a God!&mdash; ay, of a God! Which of your gods has
  done as much for you? When did one of them leave their Mount Olympus, save
  for some human need, or some human mission of bloodshed and crime? Where is
  the king who would give up an earthly throne, and go voluntarily to a
  shameful death for the sake of his people? You are men, my friends&mdash;
  brave, resolute, hearty men; what would you have in him whom you serve?
  courage, patience, mercy, goodwill to all? What think ye of Him who left the
  rulership of the whole universe, and went so willingly to die, that He might
  buy you to be His own here and hereafter? Come and range yourselves under His
  standard. I will tell you of Him day by day. There is no jealousy amongst His
  soldiers. The service is easy; He has told us so Himself; and neither mine
  nor any mortal tongue can calculate the reward."</p>

  <p>"Enough of this!" interrupted Hippias, noting the eager looks and excited
  gestures of the swordsmen; interpreting, as he did, the words of Calchas in
  their literal sense, and fearing lest he might, indeed, lose the services of
  the daring band, on whose blood it was his trade to live. "Enough of this,
  old man! We have heard you patiently, and now begone! My gladiators have
  enlisted under Caesar, and they will not desert their standard for any
  inducement you can offer. I know not why I have listened to you so long; but
  trespass not further on my forbearance. This building is no Athenian school
  of rhetoric; and the only arguments acknowledged by Hippias, are those which
  may be parried with two foot of steel. Nevertheless, go in peace, old man,
  and fare you well."</p>

  <p>So Calchas went out from amongst these fierce and turbulent spirits,
  unharmed and well satisfied. He had sown a handful of the good seed, and knew
  that somewhere it would take root. More than one of the gladiators was
  already pondering on his words; and the young Briton, with his ardent nature,
  his kind heart, and his predisposition in favour of Mariamne's kinsman, had
  resolved that he would hear more of these new doctrines, which seemed to dawn
  upon him like light from another world.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-19"
     id="ch1-19">XIX</a>. &mdash; THE ARENA</h2>

  <p class="first">A HUNDRED thousand tongues, whispering and murmuring with
  Italian volubility, send up a busy hum like that of an enormous beehive into
  the sunny air. The Flavian amphitheatre, Vespasian's gigantic concession to
  the odious tastes of his people, has not yet been constructed; and Rome must
  crowd and jostle in the great circus, if she would behold that slaughter of
  beasts, and those mortal combats of men, in which she now takes far more
  delight than in the innocent trials of speed and skill for which the
  enclosure was originally designed. That her luxurious citizens are
  dissatisfied even with this roomy edifice, is sufficiently obvious from the
  many complaints that accompany the struggling and pushing of those who are
  anxious to obtain a good place. To- day's bill-of-fare is indeed tempting to
  the morbid appetites of high and low. A rhinoceros and tiger are to be pitted
  against each other; and it is hoped that, notwithstanding many recent
  failures in such combats, these two beasts may be savage enough to afford the
  desired sport. Several pairs of gladiators, at least, are to fight to the
  death, besides those on whom the populace may show mercy, or from whom they
  may withhold it at will. In addition to all this, it has been whispered that
  one well-known patrician intends to exhibit his prowess on the deadly stage.
  Much curiosity is expressed, and many a wager has been already laid, on his
  name, his skill, the nature of his conflict, and the chances of his success.
  Though the circus be large enough to contain the population of a thriving
  city, no wonder that it is to-day full to the very brim. As usual in such
  assemblages, the hours of waiting are lightened by eating and drinking, by
  jests, practical and otherwise, by remarks, complimentary, sarcastic, or
  derisive, on the several notabilities who enter at short intervals, and take
  their places with no small stir and assumption of importance. The nobility
  and distinguished characters of this dissolute age are better known than
  respected by their plebeian fellow-citizens.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one exception. Though Valeria's Liburnians lay
  themselves open to no small amount of insolence, by the emphatic manner in
  which they make way for their mistress, as she proceeds with her usual
  haughty bearing to her place near the patrician benches&mdash; an insolence
  of which some of the more pointed missiles do not spare the scornful beauty
  herself&mdash;it is no sooner observed that she is accompanied by her
  kinsman, Licinius, than a change comes over the demeanour even of those who
  feel themselves most aggrieved, by being elbowed out of their places, and
  pushed violently against their neighbours, while admiring glances and a
  respectful silence denote the esteem in which the Roman general is held by
  high and low.</p>

  <p>It wants a few minutes yet of noon. The southern sun, though his intensity
  is modified by canvas awnings stretched over the spectators wherever it is
  possible to afford them shade, lights and warms up every nook and cranny of
  the amphitheatre; gleams in the raven hair of the Campanian matron, and the
  black eyes of the astonished urchin in her arms; flashes off the golden
  bosses that stud the white garments on the equestrian benches; bleaches the
  level sweep of sand so soon to bear the prints of mortal struggle, and
  flooding the lofty throne where Caesar sits in state, deepens the broad
  crimson hem that skirts his imperial garment, and sheds a deathlike hue over
  the pale bloated face, which betrays even now no sign of interest, or
  animation, or delight. Vitellius attends these brutal exhibitions with the
  same immobility that characterises his demeanour in almost all the avocations
  of life. The same listlessness, the same weary vacancy of expression,
  pervades his countenance here, as in the senate or the council. His eye never
  glistens but at the appearance of a favourite dish; and the emperor of the
  world can only be said to <i>live</i> once in the twenty-four hours, when
  seated at the banquet.</p>

  <p>Insensibility seems, however, in all ages to be an affectation of the
  higher classes; and here, while the plebeians wrangle, and laugh, and
  chatter, and gesticulate, the patricians are apparently bent on proving that
  amusement is for them a simple impossibility, and suffering or slaughter
  matters of the most profound indifference. And on common occasions who so
  impassible, so cold, so unmoved by all that takes place around her, as the
  haughty Valeria? but to-day there is an unusual gleam in the grey eyes, a
  quiver of the lip, a fixed red spot on either cheek; adding new charms to her
  beauty, not lost upon the observers who surround her.</p>

  <p>Quoth Damasippus to Oarses (for the congenial rogues stand, as usual,
  shoulder to shoulder)&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I would not that the patron saw her now. I never knew her look so fair as
  this. Locusta must have left her the secret of her love philtres."</p>

  <p>"Oh, innocent!" replies the other. "Knowest thou not that the patron
  fights to-day? Seest thou her restless hands, and that fixed smile, like the
  mask of an old Greek player? She loves him; trust me, therefore, she has lost
  her power, were she subtle as Arachne. Dost not know the patron? To do him
  justice, he never prizes the stakes when he has won the game."</p>

  <p>And the two fall to discussing the dinner they have brought with them, and
  think they are perfectly familiar with the intricacies of a woman's feelings.
  Meantime Valeria seems to cling to Licinius as though there were some spell
  in her kinsman's presence to calm that beating heart of which she is but now
  beginning to learn the wayward and indomitable nature. For the twentieth time
  she asks: "Is he prepared at all points? Does he know every feint of the
  deadly game? Are his health and strength as perfect as training can make
  them? And oh, my kinsman! is he confident in himself? Does he feel sure that
  he will win?"</p>

  <p>To which questions, Licinius, though wondering at the interest she betrays
  in such a matter, answers as before</p>

  <p>"All that skill, and science, and Hippias can do, has been done. He has
  the advantage in strength, speed, and height. Above all, he has the courage
  of his nation. As they get fiercer they get cooler, and they are never so
  formidable as when you deem them vanquished. I could not sit here if I
  thought he would be worsted."</p>

  <p>Then Valeria took comfort for a while, but soon she moved restlessly on
  her cushions.</p>

  <p>"How I wish they would begin!" said she; yet every moment of delay seemed
  at the same time to be a respite of priceless value, even while it added to
  the torture of suspense.</p>

  <p>Many hearts were beating in that crowd with love, hope, fear, and anxiety;
  but perhaps none so wildly as those of two women, separated but by a few
  paces, and whose eyes some indefinable attraction seemed to draw irresistibly
  towards each other. While Valeria, in common with many ladies of distinction,
  had encroached upon the space originally allotted to the vestal virgins, and
  established, by constant attendance in the amphitheatre, a prescriptive right
  to a cushioned seat for herself and her friends, women of lower rank were
  compelled to station themselves in an upper gallery allotted to them, or to
  mingle on sufferance with the crowd in the lower tier of places, where the
  presence of a male companion was indispensable for protection from annoyance,
  and even insult. Nevertheless, within speaking distance of the haughty Roman
  lady stood Mariamne, accompanied by Calchas, trembling with fear and
  excitement in every limb, yet turning her large dark eyes upon Valeria, with
  an expression of curiosity and interest that could only have been aroused by
  an instinctive consciousness of feelings common to both. The latter, too,
  seemed fascinated by the gaze of the Jewish maiden, now bending on her a
  haughty and inquiring glance, anon turning away with a gesture of affected
  disdain; but never unobservant, for many seconds together, of the dark pale
  beauty and her venerable companion.</p>

  <p>When she was at last fairly wedged in amongst the crowd, Mariamne could
  hardly explain to herself how she came there. It had been with great
  difficulty that she persuaded Calchas to accompany her; and, indeed, nothing
  but his interest in Esca, and the hope that he might, even here, find some
  means of doing good, would have tempted the old man into such a scene. It was
  with many a burning blush and painful thrill that she confessed to herself,
  she must go mad with anxiety were she absent from the death-struggle to be
  waged by the man whom she now knew she loved so dearly; and it was with a
  wild defiant recklessness that she resolved if aught of evil should befall
  him to give herself up thenceforth to despair. She felt as if she was in a
  dream; the sea of faces, the jabber of tongues, the strange novelty of the
  spectacle, confused and wearied her; yet through it all Valeria's eye seemed
  to look down on her with an ominous boding of ill; and when, with an effort,
  she forced her senses back into self-consciousness, she felt so lonely, so
  frightened, and so unhappy, that she wished she had never come.</p>

  <p>And now, with peal of trumpets and clash of cymbals, a burst of wild
  martial music rises above the hum and murmur of the seething crowd. Under a
  spacious archway, supported by marble pillars, wide folding-doors are flung
  open, and two by two, with stately step and slow, march in the gladiators,
  armed with the different weapons of their deadly trade. Four hundred men are
  they, in all the pride of perfect strength and symmetry, and high training,
  and practised skill. With head erect and haughty bearing, they defile once
  round the arena, as though to give the spectators an opportunity of closely
  scanning their appearance, and halt with military precision to range
  themselves in line under Caesar's throne. For a moment there is a pause and
  hush of expectation over the multitude, while the devoted champions stand
  motionless as statues in the full glow of noon; then bursting suddenly into
  action, they brandish their gleaming weapons over their heads, and higher,
  fuller, fiercer, rises the terrible chant that seems to combine the shout of
  triumph with the wail of suffering, and to bid a long and hopeless farewell
  to upper earth, even in the very recklessness and defiance of its
  despair&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ave, Caesar! Morituri te salutant!"</p>

  <p>Then they wheel out once more, and range themselves on either side of the
  arena; all but a chosen band who occupy the central place of honour, and of
  whom every second man at least is doomed to die. These are the picked pupils
  of Hippias; the quickest eyes and the readiest hands in the Family; therefore
  it is that they have been selected to fight by pairs to the death, and that
  it is understood no clemency will be extended to them from the populace.</p>

  <p>With quickened breath and eager looks, Valeria and Mariamne scan their
  ranks in search of a well-known figure: both feel it to be a questionable
  relief that he is not there; but the Roman lady tears the edge of her mantle
  to the seam, and the Jewish girl offers an incoherent prayer in her heart,
  for she knows not what</p>

  <p>Esca's part is not yet to be performed, and he is still in the background,
  preparing himself carefully for the struggle. The rest of the Family,
  however, muster in force. Tall Rufus stalks to his appointed station with a
  calm business-like air that bodes no good to his adversary, whoever he may
  be. He has fought too often not to feel confident in his own invincible
  prowess; and when compelled to despatch a fallen foe, he will do it with
  sincere regret, but none the less dexterously and effectually for that.
  Hirpinus, too, assumes his usual air of jovial hilarity. There is a smile on
  his broad good-humoured face; and though, notwithstanding the severity of his
  preparation, his huge muscles are still a trifle too full and lusty, he will
  be a formidable antagonist for any fighter whose proportions are less than
  those of a Hercules. As the crowd pass the different combatants in review,
  none, with the exception perhaps of Rufus, have more backers than their old
  favourite. Lutorius, too, notwithstanding his Gallic origin, which places him
  but one remove, as it were, from a barbarian, finds no slight favour with
  those who pride themselves on their experience in such matters. His great
  activity and endurance, combined with thorough knowledge of his weapon, have
  made him the victor in many a public contest. As Damasippus observes to his
  friend, "Lutorius can always tire out an adversary and despatch him at
  leisure; "to which Oarses replies. "If he be pitted to-day against Manlius, I
  will wager thee a thousand sesterces blood is not drawn in the first three
  assaults."</p>

  <p>The pairs had already been decided by lot; but amongst the score of
  combatants who were to fight to the death, these formidable champions were
  the most celebrated, and as such the especial favourites of the populace.
  Certain individuals in the crowd, who were sufficiently familiar with the
  gladiators to exchange a word of greeting, and to call them by their names,
  derived, in consequence, no small increase of importance amongst the
  bystanders. The swordsmen, although now ranged in order round the arena, are
  destined, for a time at least, to remain inactive. The sports are to commence
  with a combat between a lately imported rhinoceros, and a Libyan tiger,
  already familiarly known to the public, as having destroyed two or three
  Christian victims and a negro slave. It is only in the event of these animals
  being unwilling to fight, or becoming dangerous to the spectators, that
  Hippias will call in the assistance of his pupils for their destruction. In
  the meantime, they have an excellent view of the conflict, though perhaps it
  might be seen in greater comfort from the farther and safer side of the
  barrier.</p>

  <p>Vitellius, with a feeble inclination of his head, signs to begin, and a
  portable wooden building which has been wheeled into the lists, creating no
  little curiosity, is now taken to pieces by a few strokes of the hammer. As
  the slaves carry away the dismembered boards, with the rapidity of men in
  terror of their lives, a huge, unwieldy beast stands disclosed, and the
  rhinoceros of which they have been talking for the last week bursts on the
  delighted eyes of the Roman public. These are perhaps a little disappointed
  at first, for the animal seems peaceably, not to say indolently, disposed.
  Taking no notice of the shouts which greet his appearance, he digs his horned
  muzzle into the sand in search of food, as though secure in the overlapping
  plates of armour that sway loosely on his enormous body, with every movement
  of his huge ungainly limbs. So intent are the spectators on this rare
  monster, that their attention is only directed to the farther end of the
  arena by the restlessness which the rhinoceros at length exhibits. He stamps
  angrily with his broad flat feet, his short pointed tail is furiously
  agitated, and the gladiators who are near him observe that his little eye is
  glowing like a coal. A long, low, dark object lies coiled up under the
  barrier as though seeking shelter, nor is it. till the second glance that
  Valeria, whose interest, in common with that of the multitude, is fearfully
  excited, can make out the fawning, cruel head, the glaring eyes, and the
  striped sinewy form of the Libyan tiger.</p>

  <p>In vain the people wait for him to commence the attack. Although he is
  sufficiently hungry, having been kept for more than a day without food, it is
  not his nature to carry on an open warfare. Damasippus and Oarses jeer him
  loudly as he skulks under the barrier; and Calchas cannot forbear whispering
  to Mariamne, that "a curse has been on the monster since he tore the brethren
  limb from limb, in that very place, for the glory of the true faith." The
  rhinoceros, however, seems disposed to take the initiative; with a short
  labouring trot he moves across the arena, leaving such deep footprints behind
  him, as sufficiently attest his enormous bulk and weight. There is a flash
  like real fire from the tiger's eyes, hitherto only sullen and watchful his
  waving tail describes a semicircle in the sand and he coils himself more
  closely together, with a deep low growl; even now he is not disposed to fight
  save at an advantage.</p>

    <p class="caption">With a short labouring trot he moves across the
    arena.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A hundred thousand pairs of eyes, straining eagerly on the combatants,
  could scarce detect the exact moment at which that spring was made. All they
  can now discern is the broad mailed back of the rhinoceros swaying to and
  fro, as he kneels upon his enemy, and the grating of the tiger's claws
  against the huge beast's impenetrable armour can be heard in the farthest
  corner of the gallery that surrounds the amphitheatre. The leap was made as
  the rhinoceros turned his side for an instant towards his adversary; but with
  a quickness marvellous in a beast of such prodigious size, he moved his head
  round in time to receive it on the massive horn that armed his nose, driving
  the blunt instrument, from sheer muscular strength, right through the body of
  the tiger, and finishing his work by falling on him with his knees, and
  pressing his life out under that enormous weight. Then he rose unhurt, and
  blew the sand out of his nostrils, and left, as it seemed, unwillingly, the
  flattened, crushed, and mangled carcass, turning back to it once and again,
  with a horrible, yet ludicrous, pertinacity, ere he suffered the Ethiopians
  who attended him to lure him out of the amphitheatre with a bundle or two of
  green vegetable food.</p>

  <p>The people shouted and applauded loudly. Blood had been drawn, and their
  appetite was sharpened for slaughter. It was with open undisguised
  satisfaction that they counted the pairs of gladiators, and looked forward to
  the next act of the entertainment.</p>

  <p>Again the trumpets sound, and the swordsmen range themselves in opposite
  bodies, all armed alike with a deep concave buckler, and a short, stabbing,
  two-edged blade; but distinguished by the colour of their scarves. Wagers are
  rapidly made on the green and the red; so skilfully has the experienced
  Hippias selected and matched the combatants, that the oldest patrons of the
  sport confess themselves at a loss which to choose.</p>

  <p>The bands advance against each other, three deep, in imitation of the real
  soldiers of the empire. At the first crash of collision, when steel begins to
  clink, as thrust and blow and parry are exchanged by these practised
  warriors, the approbation of the spectators rises to enthusiasm; but men's
  voices are hushed, and they hold their breath when the strife begins to waver
  to and fro, and the ranks open out and disengage themselves, and blood is to
  be seen in patches on those athletic frames, and a few are already down,
  lying motionless where they fell. The green is giving way, but their third
  rank has been economised, and its combatants are as yet fresh and untouched;
  these now advance to fill the gaps made among their comrades, and the
  fortunes of the day seem equalised once more.</p>

  <p>And now the arena becomes a ghastly and forbidding sight; they die hard,
  these men, whose very trade is slaughter; but mortal agony cannot always
  suppress a groan, and it is pitiful to see some prostrate giant, supporting
  himself painfully on his hands, with drooping head and fast closing eye fixed
  on the ground, while the life-stream is pouring from his chest into the
  thirsty sand. It is real sad earnest, this representation of war, and
  resembles the battle-field in all save that no prisoners are taken and
  quarter is but rarely given. Occasionally, indeed, some vanquished champion,
  of more than common beauty, or who has displayed more than common address and
  courage, so wins on the favour of the spectators, that they sign for his life
  to be spared. Hands are turned outwards, with the thumb pointing to the
  earth, and the victor sheathes his sword, and retires with his worsted
  antagonist from the contest; but more generally the fallen man's signal for
  mercy is neglected; ere the shout " A hit!" has died upon his ears, his
  despairing eye marks the thumbs of his judges pointing upwards, and he
  disposes himself to welcome the steel with a calm courage, worthy of a better
  cause.</p>

  <p>The reserve, consisting of ten pairs of picked gladiators, has not yet
  been engaged. The green and the red have fought with nearly equal success;
  but when the trumpet has sounded a halt, and the dead have been dragged away
  by grappling-hooks, leaving long tracks of crimson in their wake, a careful
  enumeration of the survivors gives the victory by one to the latter colour.
  Hippias, coming forward in a suit of burnished armour, declares as much, and
  is greeted with a round of applause. In all her preoccupation, Valeria cannot
  refrain from a glance of approval at the handsome fencing-master; and
  Mariamne, who feels that Esca's life hangs on the man's skill and honesty,
  gazes at him with mingled awe and horror, as on some being of another world.
  But the populace have little inclination to waste the precious moments in
  cheering Hippias, or in calculating loss and gain. Fresh wagers are, indeed,
  made on the matches about to take place; but the prevailing feeling over that
  numerous assemblage is one of morbid excitement and anticipation. The ten
  pairs of men now marching so proudly into the centre of the lists, are
  pledged to fight to the death.</p>

  <p>It would be a disgusting task to detail the scene of bloodshed; to dwell
  on the fierce courage wasted, and the brutal useless slaughter perpetrated in
  those Roman shambles; yet, sickening as was the sight, so inured were the
  people to such exhibitions, so completely imbued with a taste for the
  horrible, and so careless of human life, that scarcely an eye was turned
  away, scarcely a cheek grew paler, when a disabling gash was received, or a
  mortal blow driven home; and mothers with babies in their arms would bid the
  child turn its head to watch the death-pang on the pale stern face of some
  prostrate gladiator.</p>

  <p>Licinius had looked upon carnage in many forms, yet a sad, grave
  disapproval sat on the general's noble features. Once, after a glance at his
  kinswoman's eager face, he turned from her with a gesture of anger and
  disgust; but Valeria was too intent upon the scene enacted within a few short
  paces to spare attention for anything besides, except, perhaps, the vague
  foreboding of evil that was gnawing at her heart, and to which such a moment
  of suspense as the present afforded a temporary relief.</p>

  <p>Rufus and Manlius had been pitted against each other by lot. The taller
  frame and greater strength of the former were supposed to be balanced by the
  latter's exquisite skill. Collars and bracelets were freely offered at even
  value amongst the senators and equestrians on each. While the other pairs
  were waging their strife with varying success in different parts of the
  amphitheatre, these had found themselves struggling near the barrier close
  under the seat occupied by Valeria. She could hear distinctly their
  hard-drawn breath; could read on each man's face the stern set expression of
  one who has no hope save in victory; for whom defeat is inevitable and
  instant death. No wonder she sat, so still and spell-bound, with her pale
  lips parted and her cold hands clenched.</p>

  <p>The blood was pouring from more than one gash on the giant's naked body,
  yet Rufus seemed to have lost neither coolness nor strength. He continued to
  ply his adversary with blow on blow, pressing him, and following him up, till
  he drove him nearly against the barrier. It was obvious that Manlius, though
  still unwounded, was overmatched and overpowered. At length Valeria drew in
  her breath with a gasp, as if in pain. It seemed as if she, the spectator,
  winced from that fatal thrust, which was accepted so calmly by the gladiator
  whom it pierced. Rufus could scarcely believe he had succeeded in foiling his
  adversary's defence, and driving it deftly home, so unmoved was the familiar
  face looking over its shield into his own&mdash;so steady and skilful was the
  return which instantaneously succeeded his attack. But that face was growing
  paler and paler with every pulsation. Valeria, gazing with wild fixed eyes,
  saw it wreathed in a strange sad smile, and Manlius reeled and fell where he
  stood, breaking his sword as he went down, and burying it beneath his body in
  the sand. The other strode over him in act to strike. A natural impulse of
  habit or self-preservation bade the fallen man half raise his arm, with the
  gesture by which a gladiator was accustomed to implore the clemency of the
  populace, but he recollected himself, and let it drop proudly by his side.
  Then he looked kindly up in his victor's face.</p>

  <p>"Through the heart, comrade," said he quietly. "for old friendship's
  sake;" and he never winced nor quailed when the giant drove the blow home
  with all the strength that he could muster.</p>

  <p>They had fed at the same board, and drunk from the same winecup for years;
  and this was all he had it in his power to bestow upon his friend. The people
  applauded loudly, but Valeria, who had heard the dead man's last appeal, felt
  her eyes fill with tears; and Mariamne, who had raised her head to look, at
  this unlucky moment, buried it once more in her kinsman's cloak, sick and
  trembling, ready to faint with pity, and dismay, and fear.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-20"
     id="ch1-20">XX</a>. &mdash; THE TRIDENT AND THE NET</h2>

  <p class="first">BUT a shout was ringing through the amphitheatre that roused
  the Jewish maiden effectually to the business of the day. It had begun in
  some far-off corner, with a mere whispered muttering, and had been taken up
  by spectator after spectator, till it swelled into a wild and deafening roar.
  "A Patrician! a Patrician!" vociferated the crowd, thirsting fiercely for
  fresh excitement, and palled with the vulgar carnage, yearning to see the red
  blood flow from some scion of an illustrious house. The tumult soon reached
  such a height as to compel the attention of Vitellius, who summoned Hippias
  to his chair, and whispered a few sentences in his ear. This somewhat calmed
  the excitement; and while the fencing-master's exertions cleared the arena of
  the dead and wounded, with whom it was encumbered, a general stir might have
  been observed throughout the assemblage, while each individual changed his
  position, and disposed himself more comfortably for sight-seeing, as is the
  custom of a crowd when anything of especial interest is about to take place.
  Ere long Damasippus and Oarses were observed to applaud loudly; and their
  example being followed by thousands of imitators, the clapping of hands, the
  stamping of feet, the cheers, and other vociferations rose with redoubled
  vigour, while Julius Placidus stepped gracefully into the centre of the
  arena, and made his obeisance to the crowd with his usual easy and somewhat
  insolent bearing.</p>

  <p>The tribune's appearance was well calculated to excite the admiration of
  the spectators, no mean judges of the human form, accustomed as they were to
  scan and criticise it in its highest state of perfection. His graceful figure
  was naked and unarmed, save for a white linen tunic reaching to the knee, and
  although he wore rings of gold round his ankles, his feet were bare to ensure
  the necessary speed and activity demanded by his mode of attack. His long
  dark locks, carefully curled and perfumed for the occasion, and bound by a
  single golden fillet, floated carelessly over his neck, while his left
  shoulder was tastefully draped, as it were, by the folds of the dangling net,
  sprinkled and weighted with small leaden beads, and so disposed as to be
  whirled away at once without entanglement or delay upon its deadly errand.
  His right hand grasped the trident, a three-pronged lance, some seven feet in
  length, capable of inflicting a fatal wound; and the flourish with which he
  made it quiver round his head displayed a practised arm and a perfect
  knowledge of the offensive weapon.</p>

  <p>To the shouts which greeted him&mdash;"Placidus! Placidus!" "Hail to the
  tribune!" "Well done the patrician order!" and other such demonstrations of
  welcome&mdash;he replied by bowing repeatedly, especially directing his
  courtesies to that portion of the amphitheatre in which Valeria was placed.
  With all his acuteness, little did the tribune guess how hateful he was at
  this moment to the very woman on whose behalf he was pledged to engage in
  mortal strife&mdash;little did he dream how earnest were her vows for his
  speedy humiliation and defeat. Valeria, sitting there with the red spots
  burning a deeper crimson in her cheeks, and her noble features set in a mask
  of stone, would have asked nothing better than to have leapt down from her
  seat, snatched up sword and buckler, of which she well knew the use, and done
  battle with him, then and there to the death.</p>

  <p>The tribune now walked proudly round the arena, nodding familiarly to his
  friends, a proceeding which called forth raptures of applause from
  Damasippus, Oarses, and other of his clients and freedmen. He halted under
  the chair of Caesar, and saluted the Emperor with marked deference; then,
  taking up a conspicuous position in the centre, and leaning on his trident,
  seemed to await the arrival of his antagonist. He was not kept long in
  suspense. With his eyes riveted on Valeria, he observed the fixed colour of
  her cheeks gradually suffusing face, neck, and bosom, to leave her as pale as
  marble when it faded, and turning round he beheld his enemy, marshalled into
  the lists by Hippias and Hirpinus&mdash;the latter, who had slain his man,
  thus finding himself at liberty to afford counsel and countenance to his
  young friend. The shouts which greeted the new-comer were neither so long nor
  so lasting as those that did honour to the tribune; nevertheless, if the
  interest excited by each were to be calculated by intensity rather than
  amount, the slave's suffrages would have far exceeded those of his
  adversary.</p>

  <p>Mariamne's whole heart was in her eyes as she welcomed the glance of
  recognition he directed exclusively to her; and Valeria, turning from one to
  the other, felt a bitter pang shoot te her very marrow, as she instinctively
  acknowledged the existence of a rival. Even at that moment of hideous
  suspense, a host of maddening feelings rushed through the Roman lady's brain.
  Many a sunburnt peasant woman, jostled and bewildered in the crowd, envied
  that sumptuous dame with her place apart, her stately beauty, her rich
  apparel, and her blazing jewels; but the peasant woman would have rued the
  exchange had she been forced to take, with these advantages, the passions
  that were laying waste Valeria's heart. Wounded pride, slighted love, doubt,
  fear, vacillation, and remorse, are none the more endurable for being clothed
  in costly raiment, and trapped out with gems and gold. While Mariamne, in her
  singleness of heart, had but one great and deadly fear&mdash;that he should
  fail&mdash;Valeria found room for a thousand anxieties and misgivings, of
  conflicting tendencies, and chafed under a distressing consciousness that she
  could not satisfy herself what it was she most dreaded or desired.</p>

  <p>Unprejudiced and uninterested spectators, however, had but one opinion as
  to the chances of the Briton's success. If anything could have added to the
  enthusiasm called forth by the appearance of Placidus, it was the patrician's
  selection of so formidable an antagonist. Esca, making his obeisance to
  Caesar, in the pride of his powerful form, and the bloom of his youth and
  beauty, armed, moreover, with helmet, shield, and sword, which he carried
  with the ease of one habituated to their use, appeared as invincible a
  champion as could have been chosen from the whole Roman Empire. Even
  Hirpinus, albeit a man experienced in the uncertainties of such contests, and
  cautious, if not in giving, at least in backing his opinion, whispered to
  Hippias that the patrician looked like a mere child by the side of their
  pupil, and offered to wager a flagon of the best Falernian " that he was
  carried out of the arena feet foremost within five minutes after the first
  attack, if he missed his throw!" To which the fencing-master, true to his
  habits of reticence and assumed superiority, vouchsafed no reply save a
  contemptuous smile.</p>

  <p>The adversaries took up their ground with exceeding caution. No advantage
  of sun or wind was allowed to either, and having been placed by Hippias at a
  distance often yards apart in the middle of the arena, neither moved a limb
  for several seconds, as they stood intently watching each other, themselves
  the centre on which all eyes were fixed. It was remarked that while Esca's
  open brow bore only a look of calm resolute attention, there was an evil
  smile of malice stamped, as it were, upon the tribune's face&mdash;the one
  seemed an apt representation of Courage and Strength the other of Hatred and
  Skill.</p>

  <p>"He carries the front of a conqueror," whispered Licinius to his
  kinswoman, regarding his slave with looks of anxious approval. "Trust me,
  Valeria, we shall win the day. Esca will gain his freedom; the gilded chariot
  and the white horses shall bring him and me to your door to-morrow morning,
  and that gaudy tribune will have had a lesson, that I for one shall not be
  sorry to have been the means of bestowing on him."</p>

  <p>A bright smile lighted up Valeria's face, but she looked from the speaker
  to a dark-haired girl in the crowd below, and the expression of her
  countenance changed till it grew as forbidding as the tribune's, while she
  replied with a careless laugh&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I care not who wins now, Licinius, since they are both in the lists. To
  tell the truth, I did but fear the courage of this Titan of yours might fail
  him at the last moment, and the match would not be fought out after all.
  Hippias tells me the tribune is the best netsman he ever trained."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a vague surprise; but following the direction of his
  kinswoman's eyes, he could not but remark the obvious distress and agitation
  of the cloaked figure on which they were bent. Mariamne, when she saw the
  Briton fairly placed, front to front with his adversary, had neither strength
  nor courage for more. Leaning against Calchas, the poor girl hid her face in
  her hands and wept as if her heart would break.</p>

  <p>Myrrhina, who no more than her mistress could have borne to be absent from
  such a spectacle, had forced her way into the crowd, accompanied by a few of
  Valeria's favourite slaves. Standing within three paces of the Jewess, that
  voluble damsel expatiated loudly on the appearance of the combatants, and her
  careless jests and sarcasms cut Mariamne to the quick. It was painful to hear
  her lover's personal qualities canvassed as though he were some handsome
  beast of prey, and his chance of life and death balanced with heartless
  nicety by the flippant tongue of a waiting-maid; but there was yet a deeper
  sting in store for her even than this. Myrrhina, having got an audience, was
  nothing loth to profit by their attention.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure," said she. "whichever way the match goes I don't know what my
  mistress will do. As for the tribune, he would get out of his chariot any day
  on the bare stones to kiss the very ground she walks on; and yet, if he dare
  so much as to leave a scratch upon that handsome youth's skin, he need never
  come to our doors again. Why, time after time have I hunted that boy all over
  the city to bring him home with me. And it's no light matter for a slave and
  a barbarian to have won the favour of the proudest lady in Rome. See how he
  looks up at her now, before they begin!"</p>

  <p>The light words wounded very sore; and Mariamne raised her head for one
  glance at the Briton, half in fond appeal, half to protest, as it were,
  against the slander she had heard. What she saw, however, left no room in her
  loving heart for any feeling save intense horror and suspense.</p>

  <p>With his eye fixed on his adversary, Esca was advancing, inch by inch,
  like a tiger about to spring. Covering the lower part of his face and most of
  his body with his buckler, and holding his short two-edged sword with bended
  arm and threatening point, he crouched to at least a foot lower than his
  natural stature, and seemed to have every muscle and sinew braced, to dash in
  like lightning when the opportunity offered. A false movement, he well knew,
  would be fatal, and the difficulty was to come to close quarters, as,
  directly he was within a certain distance, the deadly cast was sure to be
  made. Placidus, on the other hand, stood perfectly motionless. His eye was
  unusually accurate, and he could trust his practised arm to whirl the net
  abroad at the exact moment when its sweep would be irresistible. So he
  remained in the same collected attitude, his trident shifted into the left
  hand, his right foot advanced, his right arm wrapped in the gathered folds of
  the net which hung across his body, and covered the whole of his left side
  and shoulder. Once he tried a scornful gibe and smile to draw his enemy from
  his guard, but in vain; and though Esca, in return, made a feint with the
  same object, the former's attitude remained immovable, and the latter's snake
  -like advance continued with increasing caution and vigilance.</p>

  <p>An inch beyond the fatal distance, Esca halted once more. For several
  seconds the combatants thus stood at bay, and the hundred thousand spectators
  crowded into that spacious amphitheatre held their breath, and watched them
  like one man.</p>

  <p>At length the Briton made a false attack, prepared to spring back
  immediately and foil the netsman's throw, but the wily tribune was not to be
  deceived, and the only result was that, without appearing to shift his
  ground, he moved an arm's length nearer his adversary. Then the Briton dashed
  in, and this time in fierce earnest. Foot, hand, and eye, all together, and
  so rapidly, that the tribune's throw flew harmless over his assailant's head,
  Placidus only avoiding his deadly thrust by the cat-like activity with which
  he leaped aside; then, turning round, he scoured across the arena for life,
  gathering his net for a fresh cast as he flew. "Coward!" hissed Valeria,
  between her set teeth; while Mariamne breathed once more nay, her bosom
  panted, and her eye sparkled with something like triumph at the approaching
  climax.</p>

  <p>She was premature, however, in her satisfaction, and Valeria's disdain was
  also undeserved. Though apparently flying for his life, Placidus was as cool
  and brave at that moment as when he entered the arena. Ear and eye were alike
  on the watch for the slightest false movement on the part of his pursuer; and
  ere he had half crossed the lists, his net was gathered up, and folded with
  deadly precision once more.</p>

  <p>The tribune especially prided himself on his speed of foot. It was on this
  quality that he chiefly depended for safety in a contest which at first sight
  appeared so unequal. He argued from the great strength of his adversary, that
  the latter would not be so pre-eminent in activity as himself; but he omitted
  to calculate the effects of a youth spent in the daily labours of the chase
  amongst the woods and mountains of Britain. Those following feet had many a
  time run down the wild goat over its native rocks. Faster and faster fly the
  combatants, to the intense delight of the crowd, who specially affect this
  kind of combat for the pastime it thus affords. Speedy as is the tribune, his
  foe draws nearer and nearer, and now, close to where Mariamne stands with
  Calchas, he is within a stride of his antagonist. His arm is up to strike!
  when a woman's shriek rings through the amphitheatre, startling Vitellius on
  his throne, and the sword flies aimlessly from the Briton's grasp as he falls
  forward on his face, and the impetus rolls him over and over in the sand.</p>

  <p>There is no chance for him now. He is scarcely down ere the net whirls
  round him, and he is fatally and helplessly entangled in its folds. Mariamne
  gazes stupefied on the prostrate form, with stony face and a fixed unmeaning
  stare. Valeria springs to her feet in a sudden impulse, forgetting for the
  moment where she is.</p>

  <p>Placidus, striding over his fallen enemy with his trident raised, and the
  old sneering smile deepening and hardening on his face, observed the cause of
  his downfall, and inwardly congratulated himself on the lucky chance which
  had alone prevented their positions being reversed. The blood was streaming
  from a wound in Esca's foot. It will be remembered that where Manlius fell,
  his sword was buried under him in the sand. On removing his dead body the
  weapon escaped observation, and the Briton, treading in hot haste on the very
  spot where it lay concealed, had not only been severely lacerated, but
  tripped up and brought to the ground by the snare.</p>

  <p>All this flashed through the conqueror's mind, as he stood erect, prepared
  to deal a blow that should close all accounts, and looked up to Valeria for
  the fatal sign.</p>

  <p>Maddened with rage and jealousy; sick, bewildered, and scarcely conscious
  of her actions, the Roman lady was about to give it, when Licinius seized her
  arms and held them down by force. Then, with a numerous party of friends and
  clients, he made a strong demonstration in favour of mercy. The speed of
  foot, too, displayed by the vanquished, and the obvious cause of his
  discomfiture, acted favourably on the majority of spectators. Such an array
  of hands turned outwards and pointing to the earth met the tribune's eye,
  that he could not but forbear his cruel purpose, so he gave his weapon to one
  of the attendants who had now entered the arena, took his cloak from the
  hands of another, and, with a graceful bow to the spectators, turned
  scornfully away from his fallen foe.</p>

  <p>Esca, expecting nothing less than immediate death, had his eyes fixed on
  the drooping figure of Mariamne; but the poor girl had seen nothing since his
  fall. Her last moment of consciousness showed her a cloud of dust, a confused
  mass of twine, and an ominous figure with arm raised in act to strike; then
  barriers and arena, and eager faces and white garments, and the whole
  amphitheatre, pillars, sand, and sky, reeled ere they faded into darkness;
  sense and sight failed her at the same moment, and she fainted helplessly in
  her kinsman's arms.</p>

  <h2><a name="bk2"
     id="bk2">BOOK II. ANTEROS</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="ch2-01"
     id="ch2-01"></a>I. &mdash; THE LISTENING SLAVE</h2>

  <p class="first">WOUNDED, vanquished, transferred from his kind master, and
  farther from liberty than ever, Esca's was now indeed a pitiable lot. The
  tribune, entitled by the very terms of his wager to the life and person of
  his antagonist, was not the man to forego this advantage by any act of
  uncalled-for generosity. In the Briton he believed he now possessed a tool to
  use with effect, in furtherance of a work which the seductive image of
  Valeria rendered every day more engrossing; an auxiliary by whose aid he
  might eventually stand first in the good graces of the only woman who had
  ever obtained a mastery over his unyielding disposition and selfish heart.
  None the more on this account did he cherish the captive, nor alleviate his
  condition as a slave. From the effects of his injury, Esca could not be put
  to any harder kinds of labour, but in all menial offices, however degrading,
  he was compelled to take his share. Different, indeed, was his condition here
  from what it had been in the service of the high-minded Licinius, and
  bitterly did he feel the exchange.</p>

  <p>Submitting to sarcasm, insult, continued ill-treatment, and annoyance, the
  noble barbarian would have failed under the trial, had it not been for a few
  well-remembered words, on the truth of which Calchas had so often insisted,
  and in which (for when were human thoughts without an earthly leavening?)
  Mariamne seemed to cherish an implicit belief.</p>

  <p>Those words breathed hope and consolation under the very worst misfortunes
  that life could offer; and Esca suffered on, very silent, and tolerably
  patient, although, perhaps, there was a fiercer fire smouldering in his
  breast than would have been approved by his venerable monitor&mdash;a fire
  that only waited occasion to blaze out all the more dangerously for being
  thus forcibly suppressed.</p>

  <p>With a malicious pleasure, natural to his disposition, Placidus compelled
  the Briton to perform several domestic offices which brought him about his
  person. It flattered the tribune's vanity to have continually before his eyes
  the athletic frame he was so proud to have overcome; and it pleased him that
  his friends, guests, and clients should be thus led to converse upon his late
  encounter, which had created no small gossip in the fashionable world of
  Rome. It happened, then, that Esca, while preparing his master's bath, was
  startled to hear the name that was never long out of his own thoughts spoken
  in accents of caution and secrecy by the tribune himself, who was in the
  adjoining apartment, holding close consultation with Hippias the
  fencing-master and the two freedmen, Damasippus and Oarses. All were
  obviously interested in the subject under discussion, and, believing
  themselves safe from eaves -droppers, spoke energetically, though in tones
  somewhat lower than their wont.</p>

  <p>He started, and the blood ebbed painfully from his heart. "Mariamne!" yes,
  the word was again repeated, and while Oarses said something in a whisper, he
  could clearly distinguish the tribune's low mocking laugh. It was plain they
  were unaware of his presence; and, indeed, it was at an earlier hour than
  usual that he had made ready the unguents, perfumes, strigil, and other
  appliances indispensable to the luxurious ablutions of a Roman patrician. The
  bathroom was inside the favourite apartment of Placidus, where he was now
  holding counsel, and could only be entered through the latter, from which it
  was separated by a heavy velvet curtain. Esca, surrounded by the materials of
  the toilet, had been sitting for a longer time than he knew, lost in thought,
  until aroused by the mention of Mariamne's name. Thus it was that the four
  others believed the bathroom empty, and their conversation unheard.</p>

  <p>Anxious and excited, the Briton scarcely dared to draw his breath, but
  crept cautiously behind the folds of the heavy curtain, and listened
  attentively. The tribune was walking to and fro with the restless motions and
  stealthy gait of a tiger in its cage. Hippias, seated at his ease upon a
  couch, was examining the device of a breastplate, with his usual air of
  good-humoured superiority; and Damasippus, appealing with admiring looks to
  Oarses, who responded in kind, seemed to endorse, as it were, with a
  dependent's mute approval, the opinions and observations of his patron.</p>

  <p>"Two-thirds of the legions have already come over," said Placidus, rapidly
  enumerating the forces on which Vespasian's party could count. "In Spain, in
  Gaul, in Britain, the soldiers have declared openly against Vitellius. The
  surrender of Cremona can no longer be concealed from the meanest populace.
  Alexandria, the granary of the empire, has fallen into the hands of
  Vespasian. Those dusky knaves, thy countrymen, Oarses, will see us starve,
  ere they send us supplies under the present dynasty; and think ye our greasy
  plebeians here will endure the girdle of famine, thus drawn tighter, day by
  day, round their luxurious paunches? The fleet at Misenum was secured long
  ago, but the news that Caesar could not count upon a single galley in blue
  water only reached the capital to-day. Then the old Praetorians are ripe for
  mischief; you may trust them never to forget nor to forgive the disgrace of
  last year, when the chosen band was broke, dismissed, and, worst of all,
  deprived of rations and pay; I tell thee, Hippias, those angry veterans are
  ready to take the town without assistance, and put old and young to the
  sword. Fail! it is impossible we can fail; the new party outnumbers the old
  by ten to one!"</p>

  <p>"You have told off a formidable list," replied Hippias quietly; "I cannot
  see that you are in need of any further help from me or mine."</p>

  <p>Placidus shot a sharp questioning glance at the fencing-master, and
  resumed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Half the numbers that have given in their adhesion to Vespasian would
  serve to put my chariot-boy on the throne; Automedon's long curls might be
  bound by a diadem tomorrow, were he the favourite of the hour, so far as Rome
  is concerned. You know what the masses are, my Hippias, for it is your trade
  to pander to their tastes, and rouse their enthusiasm. It is true that the
  great general is, at this moment, virtually ruler of the empire, but a pebble
  might turn the tide in the capital. I would not trust Vespasian's own son,
  young and dissipated as he is, could he but make a snatch at the reins with
  any hope of holding them firmly when once within his grasp. Titus Flavius
  Domitian might be emperor to-morrow, if he would be satisfied to wear the
  purple but for a week, and then make room for someone else. Nay, the people
  are fickle enough to be capable of turning round at any moment, and retaining
  our present admirable ruler on the throne. Rome must be coerced, my Hippias;
  the barbers, and cobblers, and water-carriers must be kept down and
  intimidated; if need be, we must cut a few garlic -breathing throats. It may
  be necessary to remove Caesar himself, lest the reactionary feeling should
  burst out again, and we should find ourselves left with nothing for our
  pains, but the choice of a cup of poison, a gasp in a halter, or three inches
  of steel. We <i>must</i> succeed this time, for not a man need hope for
  pardon if Caesar is thoroughly frightened. Hippias, there must be no
  half-measures now!"</p>

  <p>"Well said!" exclaimed the freedmen in a breath, with very pale faces,
  nevertheless, and an enthusiasm obviously somewhat against the grain.</p>

  <p>Hippias looked quietly up from the breastplate resting on his lap.</p>

  <p>"There will be shows," said he. "and blood flowing like water in the
  circus, whoever wears the purple. While Rome stands, the gladiator need never
  want for bread."</p>

  <p>"Now you speak like a man of sense," replied the tribune, in the same
  tone; "for after all, the whole matter resolves itself into a mere question
  of money. The shows are tolerably lucrative, at least to their contriver, but
  it takes many a festival ere the sesterces count by tens of thousands; and
  Hippias loves luxury and wine, and women too&mdash;nay, deny it not, my
  comely hero; and if the Family and their trainer could be hired at a fair
  price, for an hour's work or so, why they need never enter the arena again,
  save as spectators; nay, poorer men than their chief might be have sat in the
  equestrian rows, ere now."</p>

  <p>"You want to hire my chickens and myself for a forlorn hope," retorted
  Hippias impatiently. "Better say so at once, and be plain with me."</p>

  <p>"It is even so," resumed Placidus, with an assumption of extreme candour.
  "For real work I have few I can depend upon but the old Praetorians; and
  though they stick at nothing, there are hardly enough of them for my purpose.
  With a chosen two hundred of thine, my dealer in heroes, I could command Rome
  for twenty-four hours; and when Placidus soars into the sky, he carries
  Hippias on his wings. Speak out; thy terms are high, but such a game as ours
  is not played for a handful of pebbles or a few brass farthings. What is the
  price, man by man?"</p>

  <p>"You would require two hundred of them," observed the other reflectively.
  "Five thousand sesterces a man, and his freedom, which would come to nearly
  as much more."</p>

  <p>"The killed not to count, of course," bargained the tribune.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," repeated Hippias. "Listen, most illustrious; I will take
  all chances, and supply the best men I have, for eight thousand a-head. Two
  hundred swordsmen who would take Pluto by the beard without a scruple, if I
  only lifted my hand. Lads who can hold their own against thrice their number
  of any legion that was ever drilled. They are ready at two hours'
  notice."</p>

  <p>He was speaking truth, for Hippias was honest enough in his own particular
  line. Amongst the thousands who owed their professional standing, and the
  very bread they ate, to the celebrated fencing-master, it was no hard task to
  select a company of dare-devils, such as he described, who would desire no
  better sport than to see their native city in flames, with the streets knee-
  deep in blood and wine, while they put men, women, and children
  indiscriminately to the sword. The tribune's eye brightened, as he thought of
  the fierce work he could accomplish with such tools as these ready to his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Keep them for me, from to-day," he answered, looking round the apartment,
  as though to assure himself that he was only heard by those in his
  confidence. "My plan cannot but succeed if we only observe common secrecy and
  caution. Ten picked men, and thyself, my Hippias, I bid to sup with me here,
  the rest of the band shall be distributed by twenties amongst the different
  streets opening on the palace, preserving their communication thus: one man
  at a time must continually pass from each post to the next, until every
  twenty has been changed. This secures us from treachery, and will keep our
  cut-throats on the alert. At a given signal, all are to converge on the
  middle garden-gate, which will be found open. Then they may lead the old
  Praetorians to the attack, and take the palace itself by assault, in defiance
  of any resistance, however desperate, that can be made. The German guard are
  stubborn dogs, and must be put to the sword directly the outer hall is
  gained. I would not have them burn down the palace if they can help it; but
  when they have done my work, they are welcome to all they can carry out of it
  on their backs, and you may tell them so."</p>

  <p>Hippias noted in his own mind this additional incentive with considerable
  satisfaction. After a moment's pause, he looked fixedly in the tribune's
  face, and inquired&mdash;</p>

  <p>"How would you wish your guests armed for the supper-party? Shall we bring
  our knives with us, kind host?"</p>

  <p>Placidus flushed a dark red, and then grew pale. He averted his eyes from
  Hippias, while he answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"There are few weapons so true as the short two-edged sword. There will be
  work for our brave little party inside the palace, of which we must make no
  bungling. Is it such a grave matter, my Hippias, to slay a fat old man?" he
  added inquiringly.</p>

  <p>The other's face assumed an expression of intense disgust.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said he. "I will have no murder done in cold blood. As much
  fighting as you please, in the way of business, but we are no hired
  assassins, my men and I. To put one Caesar off the throne, and another on, is
  a pretty night's amusement enough, and I have no objection to it; but to take
  an old man out of his bed, even though he be an emperor, and slay him as you
  slay a fat sheep, I'll none of it. Send for a butcher, tribune; this is no
  trade of ours!"</p>

  <p>Placidus bit his lip, and seemed to think profoundly for a moment, then
  his brow cleared, and he resumed with a light laugh.</p>

  <p>"Far be it from me to offend a gladiator's scruples. I know the morals of
  the Family, and respect their prejudices. Half the money shall be in your
  hands within an hour; the rest shall be paid when the job is done. I think we
  understand each other well enough. Is it a bargain, Hippias? Can I depend
  upon you?"</p>

  <p>The fencing-master was not yet satisfied.</p>

  <p>"About the guests," he asked sternly; "how are we to pay for our
  supper?"</p>

  <p>Placidus clapped him on the shoulder, with a jovial laugh.</p>

  <p>"I will be frank with thee," said he. "old comrade. Why should there be
  secrets between thee and me? We go from my supper-table to the palace. We
  enter with the storming-party. I know the private apartments of the Emperor.
  I can lead our little band direct to the royal presence. Here we will rally
  round Vitellius, and take his sacred person into our charge. Hippias, I will
  make it ten thousand sesterces a man, for each of the ten, and thou shalt
  name thine own price for thine own services. But the Emperor must not escape.
  Dost thou understand me now?"</p>

  <p>"I like it not," replied the other; "but the price is fair enough, and my
  men must live. I would it could be so arranged that some resistance might be
  made in the palace; you slay a man so much easier with his helmet on and his
  sword in his hand!"</p>

  <p>"Pooh! prejudice!" laughed the tribune. "Professional fancies that spring
  from thy coarse material trade. Blood leaves no more stain than wine. You and
  I have spilt enough of both in our time. What matter, a throat cut or a
  cracked flagon of Falernian? Dash a pitcher of water over a marble floor like
  this, and you wash away the signs of both at once. Said I not well,
  Damasippus? Why, what ails thee, man? Thy face has turned as white as thy
  gown!"</p>

  <p>Damasippus, indeed, whose eyes were fixed upon the floor to which his
  patron had just alluded, presented, at this juncture, an appearance of
  intense terror and amazement. The freedman's mouth was open, his cheeks were
  deadly pale, and his very hair seemed to bristle with dismay. Pointing a
  shaking finger to the slabs of marble at his feet, he could only stammer out
  in broken accents: " May the gods avert the omen!" over and over again.</p>

  <p>The others, following the direction of his gaze, were no less astonished
  to see a narrow stream of crimson winding over the smooth white floor, as
  though the very stones protested against the tribune's reckless and inhuman
  sentiments. For an instant all stood motionless, then Placidus, leaping at
  the velvet curtain, tore it fiercely open, and discovered the cause of the
  phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Listening attentively for some further mention of the name that had roused
  his whole being, not a syllable of the foregoing conversation had been lost
  upon Esca, who, kneeling on one knee, with his wounded foot bent under him,
  and his ear applied close to the heavy folds of the curtain, had never moved
  a hair's-breadth from his attitude of fixed and absorbing attention. In this
  constrained position, the wound in his foot, which was not yet healed over,
  had opened afresh, and though he was himself unconscious of all but the cruel
  and treacherous scheme he overheard, it bled so freely that a dark stream
  stole gradually beneath the curtains, and crept gently along the marble to
  the very feet of the horror-stricken Damasippus.</p>

  <p>Esca sprang to his full height; in that moment his blood curdled, as it
  had done when he was down upon the sand, with his enemy's eye glaring on him
  through the cruel net. He knew the tribune, and he felt there was no hope.
  The latter laughed loud and long. It was his way of covering all disagreeable
  emotions, but it boded no good to the object of his mirth. When Esca heard
  that laugh he looked anxiously about him as though to seek a weapon. What was
  the use? He stood wounded and defenceless in the power of four reckless men,
  of whom two were armed.</p>

  <p>"Hold him!" exclaimed Placidus to his freedmen, drawing at the same time a
  short two-edged sword from its sheath. "It is unfortunate for the barbarian
  that he has learned our language. The necessity is disagreeable, but there is
  only one way of ensuring silence. My bath, too, is prepared, so I can spare
  him for to-day, and my freedmen will see that his place is supplied by
  to-morrow. Hold him, cowards! I say; do you fear that he will bite you?"</p>

  <p>Neither Damasippus nor Oarses, however, seemed much inclined to grapple
  with the stalwart Briton. Wounded and outnumbered as he was, without a chance
  of rescue or escape, there was yet a defiant carriage of the head, a fierce
  glare in the eye, that warned the freedmen to keep hands off him as long as
  they could. They looked at each other irresolutely, and shrank from the
  patron's glance. That moment's hesitation saved him. Hippias, who regarded
  every six feet of manhood with a brave heart inside it as his own peculiar
  property, had besides a kindly feeling for his old pupil. He put his muscular
  frame between the master and the slave.</p>

  <p>"Give him a day or two, tribune," said he carelessly. "I can find a better
  use for him than to cut his throat here on this clean white floor, and an
  equally safe one in the end, you may be sure."</p>

  <p>"Impossible, fool!" answered Placidus angrily. "He has heard enough to
  destroy every hair on the head of each of us. He must never leave this room
  alive!"</p>

  <p>"Only twenty-four hours," pleaded the fencing-master, who well knew how
  much at that time in Rome a day might bring forth. "Put him in ward as close
  as you will, but let him live till to-morrow. Hippias asks it as a favour to
  himself, and you may not like to be refused by him, when it is <i>your</i>
  turn. What if I should say 'No' in the private apartments of the palace?
  Come, let us make a compromise."</p>

  <p>The tribune reflected for a moment. Then striking his right hand into that
  of Hippias&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Agreed," said he. "Twenty-four hours' grace on one side, and the sharpest
  blade in Rome at my disposal on the other. Ho! Damasippus, call some of my
  people in. Bid them put the new collar on the slave, and chain him to the
  middle pillar in the inner court."</p>

  <p>The order was punctually obeyed, and Esca found himself a helpless
  prisoner, burdened with a secret that might save the empire, and with
  maddening apprehensions on behalf of Mariamne tearing at his heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-02"
     id="ch2-02">II</a>. &mdash; ATTACK AND DEFENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">SUCH beauty as the Jewess's, although she seldom went
  abroad, and led as sequestered a life as was compatible with the domestic
  duties she had to perform, could not pass unnoticed in a place like Rome.
  Notwithstanding the utter contempt in which her nation was held by its proud
  conquerors, she had been observed going to market in the morning for the few
  necessaries of her household, or filling her pitcher from the Tiber at
  sunset; and amongst other evil eyes that had rested on her fair young face
  were those of Damasippus, freedman to Julius Placidus the tribune. He had
  lost no time in reporting to his patron the jewel he had discovered, so to
  speak, in its humble setting; for, like the jackal, Damasippus never dared to
  hunt for himself, and followed after evil, not for its own sake, but for the
  lust of gold.</p>

  <p>His patron, too, though he had only seen the girl once, and then closely
  veiled, was so inflamed by the description of her charms, on which the client
  dwelt at great length, that he resolved to possess himself of her, in the
  sheer insolence of a great man's whim, promising the freedman that after the
  lion was served he should have the jackal's reward. It was in consequence of
  this agreement that a plot was laid of which Esca overheard but half a dozen
  syllables, and yet enough to render him very uneasy when he reflected on the
  recklessness and cruelty of him with whom it originated, and the slavish
  obedience with which it was sure to be carried out. It would have broken the
  spirit of a brave man to be chained to a pillar, fasting and wounded, with
  only twenty-four hours to live; and a keen suspicion that the woman he loved
  was even then all unconsciously walking into the toils, added a pang to
  bodily suffering which might have turned the stoutest heart to water, but
  Esca never lost hope altogether. Something he could not analyse seemed to
  give him comfort and support, nor was he aware that the blind vague trust he
  was beginning to entertain in some power above and beyond himself, yet on
  which he felt he could implicitly rely, was the first glimmer of the true
  faith dawning on his soul.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the slave in his chain, under sentence of death, bore a lighter
  heart than his luxurious master, washed, perfumed, and tricked out in all the
  glitter of dress and ornament, rolling in his gilded chariot to do homage to
  the woman who had really mastered his selfish heart. Automedon, whose eyes
  were of the sharpest, remarked that his lord was nervous and restless, that
  his cheek paled, and his lip shook more and more as they proceeded on their
  well-known way, and that when they neared the portals of Valeria's house the
  tribune's hand trembled so that he could scarcely fasten the brooch upon his
  shoulder. How white against the crimson mantle, dyed twice and thrice till it
  had deepened almost into purple, looked those uncertain fingers, quivering
  about the clasp of gold!</p>

  <p>However reckless, unprincipled, and cunning a man may be, he is inevitably
  disarmed by the woman he really loves. This is even the case when his
  affection is returned; but when he has fallen into the hands of one who,
  disliking him personally, has resolved to make him her tool, his situation is
  pitiable indeed. These hopeless passions, too, have in all ages been of the
  fiercest and the most enduring. Ill-usage on the one side or the other has
  not produced the effect that might be expected, and the figurative shirt of
  Nessus, instead of being torn off in shreds and cast away, has been far
  oftener hugged closer and closer to the skin, burning and blistering into the
  very marrow. It generally happens, too, that the suitor, whose whole
  existence seems to hang upon his success, blunders into the course that leads
  him in a direction exactly contrary to his goal. He is pretty sure to say and
  do the wrong thing at the wrong time. He offers his attentions with a
  pertinacity that wearies and offends, or withdraws them with a precipitation
  so transparent as to compel remark. When he should be firm, he is plaintive;
  when he is expected to be cheerful, he turns sulky. To enhance his own value
  he becomes boastful to the extreme verge, and sometimes beyond it, of the
  truth; or in order to prove his devotion, he makes himself ridiculous, and
  thereby deals the final and suicidal blow, if such indeed be necessary, that
  is to shatter like glass the fabric of his hopes.</p>

  <p>The tribune knew women thoroughly. He could plead no lack of experience,
  for ignorance of that intricate and puzzling labyrinth, a woman's heart. He
  had, indeed, broken more than one in the process of examination, and yet the
  boy Automedon, sitting by his side in the chariot, with the wind lifting his
  golden curls, would hardly have been guilty of so many false movements, such
  mistakes both of tactics and strategy, as disgraced his lord's conduct of the
  unequal warfare he waged with Valeria. Yet this engrossing affection, stained
  and selfish as it was, constituted perhaps the one redeeming quality of the
  tribune's character; afforded the only incentive by which his better and
  manlier feelings could be aroused.</p>

  <p>Possibly Valeria expected him. Women have strange instincts on such
  matters, which seldom deceive. She was dressed with the utmost magnificence,
  as though conscious that simplicity could have no charms for Placidus, and
  sat in a splendour nearly regal, keeping Myrrhina and the rest of her maidens
  within call. Lovers are acute observers; as he walked up the cool spacious
  court to greet her, he saw that she was gentler, and more languid than her
  wont; she looked wearied and unhappy, as though she, too, acknowledged the
  sorrows and the weaknesses of her sex. Lover-like, he thought this unusual
  shade of softness became her well.</p>

  <p>For days she had been fighting with her own heart, and she had suffered as
  such undisciplined natures must. The strife had left its traces on her pale
  proud face, and she felt a vague unacknowledged yearning for repose. The
  wild-bird had beat her wings and ruffled her plumage till she was tired, and
  a skilful fowler would have taken advantage of the reaction to lure her into
  his net. Perhaps she had been thinking what happiness it must be to have one
  in the world in whom she could confide, on whom she could rely; one loyal
  manly nature on which to rest her woman's heart, with all its caprices, and
  weaknesses, and capacity for love; perhaps she may have been even touched by
  the tribune's unshaken devotion to herself, by the constancy which could
  withstand the allurements of vice, and even the distractions of political
  intrigue; perhaps to-day she disliked him less than on any former occasion,
  though it could hardly have been for <i>his</i> sake that her eye was heavy,
  and her bosom heaved. If so, whatever favour he had unconsciously gained, was
  as unconsciously destroyed by his own hand. He approached her with an air of
  assumed confidence, that masked only too well the agitation of his real
  feelings.</p>

  <p>"Fair Valeria," said he. "I have obeyed your commands, and I come like a
  faithful servant to claim my reward."</p>

  <p>Now a woman's commands are not always intended to be literally obeyed.
  Under any circumstances she seldom likes to be reminded of them; and as for
  <i>claiming</i> anything from Valeria, why the very word roused all the
  rebellion that was dormant in her nature. At that instant rose on her mind's
  eye the scene in the amphitheatre, the level sand, the tossing sea of faces,
  the hoarse roar of the crowd, the strong white limbs and the yellow locks
  lying helpless beneath a dark vindictive face, and a glitter of uplifted
  steel. How she hated the conqueror then! How she hated him now! She was
  clasping a bracelet carelessly on her arm, the fair round arm he admired so
  much, and that never looked so fair and round as in this gesture. It was part
  of his torture to make herself as attractive as she could. Her cold eyes
  chilled him at once.</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten all about it," said she. "I am obliged to you for
  reminding me that I am in your debt"</p>

  <p>Though somewhat hurt, he answered courteously. "There can be no debt from
  a mistress to her slave. You know, Valeria, that all of mine, even to my
  life, is at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked, with a provoking persistency of misapprehension.</p>

  <p>He began to lose his head; he, ordinarily so calm, and cunning, and self-
  reliant.</p>

  <p>"You bade me enter on a difficult and dangerous undertaking. It was
  perhaps a lady's caprice, the merest possible whim. But you expressed a wish,
  and I never rested till I had accomplished it."</p>

  <p>"You mean about that wretched slave?" said she, and the colour rose
  faintly to her cheek. "But you never killed him after all."</p>

  <p>How little he knew her! This, then, he thought, was the cause of her
  coldness, of her displeasure. Esca had in some way incurred her ill-will, and
  she was angry with the conqueror who had spared him so foolishly when in his
  power. What a heart must this be of hers that could only quench its
  resentment in blood! Yet he loved her none the less. How the fair round arm,
  and the stately head, and the turn of the white shoulder maddened him with a
  longing that was almost akin to rage. He caught her hand, and pressed it
  fervently to his lips.</p>

  <p>"How can I please you?" he exclaimed, and his voice trembled with the only
  <i>real</i> emotion he perhaps had ever felt. "Oh! Valeria, you know that I
  love the very ground you tread on."</p>

  <p>She bade Myrrhina bring her some embroidery on which the girl was busied,
  and thus effectually checked any further outpouring of sentiments which are
  not conveniently expressed within earshot of a third person. The waiting-maid
  took her seat at her mistress's elbow, her black eyes dancing in malicious
  mirth.</p>

  <p>"Is that all you have to tell me?" resumed Valeria, with a smile in which
  coquetry, indifference, and conscious power were admirably blended. "Words
  are but empty air. My favour is reserved for those who win it by deeds."</p>

  <p>"He shall die! I pledge you my word he shall die!" exclaimed the tribune,
  still misunderstanding the beautiful enigma on which he had set his heart. "I
  have but spared him till I should know your pleasure, and now his fate is
  sealed. Ere this time to-morrow he will have crossed the Styx, and Valeria
  will repay me with one of her brightest smiles."</p>

  <p>A shudder she could not suppress swept over the smooth white skin, but she
  suffered no trace of emotion to appear upon her countenance. She had a game
  to play now, and it must be played steadily and craftily to ensure success.
  She bade Myrrhina fetch wine and fruit to place before her guest, and while
  the waiting-maid crossed the hall on her errand, she suffered the tribune to
  take her hand once more nay, even returned its caressing clasp, with an
  almost imperceptible pressure. He was intoxicated with his success, he felt
  he was winning at last; and the jewelled cup that Myrrhina brought him, as he
  thought all too soon, remained for a while suspended in his hand, while he
  uttered fervent protestations of love, which were received with an equanimity
  that ought to have convinced him they were hopelessly wasted on his idol.</p>

  <p>"You profess much," said she. "but it costs men little to promise. We have
  but one faithful lover in the empire, and he is enslaved by a barbarian
  princess and another man's wife. Would you have turned back from all the
  pleasures of Rome, to fight one more campaign against those dreadful Jews,
  for the sake of Berenice's sunburnt face?"</p>

  <p>"Titus had consulted the oracle of Venus," replied the tribune, with a
  meaning smile; "and doubtless the goddess had promised him a double victory.
  Valeria, you know there is nothing a man will not dare to win the woman he
  loves."</p>

  <p>"Could you be as true?" she asked, throwing all the sweetness of her
  mellow voice, all the power of her winning eyes, into the question.</p>

  <p>"Try me," answered he, and for one moment the man's nature was changed,
  and he felt capable of devotion, self-sacrifice, fidelity, all that
  constitutes the heroism of love. The next, nature reasserted her sway, and he
  was counting the cost.</p>

  <p>"I have a fancy for your barbarian," said Valeria carelessly, after a
  pause. "Myrrhina loves him, and&mdash;and if you will give him to me I will
  take him into my household."</p>

  <p>Placidus shot a piercing glance at the waiting-maid, and that well-
  tutored damsel cast down her eyes and tried to blush. There was something,
  too, in Valeria's manner that did not satisfy him, and yet he was willing to
  believe more than he hoped, and nearly all he wished.</p>

  <p>"I seldom ask for anything," resumed Valeria, raising her head with a
  proud petulant gesture of which she knew the full effect. "It is far easier
  for me to grant a favour than to implore one. And yet, I know not why, but I
  do not feel it painful to beg anything to-day from you!"</p>

  <p>A soft smile broke over the haughty face while she spoke, and she raised
  her eyes and looked full into his for an instant, ere she lowered them to toy
  with the bracelet once more. It was the deadliest thrust she had in all her
  cunning of fence, the antagonist could seldom parry or withstand it; would it
  foil him in their present encounter? He loved her as much as such a nature
  can love, but the question was one of life and death, and it was no time for
  child's play now, as Esca was in possession of a secret that might annihilate
  his lord in an hour. The tribune was not a man to sacrifice his very
  existence for a woman, even though that woman was Valeria. He hesitated, and
  she, marking his hesitation, turned pale, and shook with rage.</p>

  <p>"You refuse me!" said she, in accents that trembled either with suppressed
  fury or lacerated feelings. "You refuse me. <i>You</i>, the only man living
  for whom I would have so lowered myself. The only man I ever stooped to
  entreat. Oh! it is too much, too much."</p>

  <p>She bowed her head in her hands, and as the wealth of brown hair showered
  over her white shoulders, they heaved as if she wept. Myrrhina looked
  reproachfully at the tribune, and muttered. "Oh! if he knew, if he only
  <i>knew</i>!"</p>

  <p>In his dealings with the other sex Placidus had always been of opinion
  that it is better to untie a knot than to cut it.</p>

  <p>"Fair Valeria," said he. "ask me anything but this. I am pledged to slay
  this man within twenty-four hours; will not that content you?"</p>

  <p>The exigency of the situation, the danger of him for whom she had
  conceived so wild and foolish a passion, sharpened her powers of deception,
  and made her reckless of her own feelings, her own degradation. Shaking the
  hair back from her temples, beautiful in her disorder and her tears, she
  looked with wet eyes in the tribune's face, while she replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you think I care for the barbarian? What difference can it make to
  Valeria if such as this Briton were slain by hecatombs? It is for Myrrhina's
  sake I grieve; and more, far more than this, to think that you can refuse me
  anything in the whole world!"</p>

  <p>Duplicity was no new effort for the tribune. He had often, ere now,
  betaken himself to this mode of defence when driven to his last ward. He
  raised her hands respectfully to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Be it as you will," said he; "I make him over to you to do with him what
  you please. Esca is your property, beautiful Valeria, from this hour."</p>

  <p>A dark thought had flitted through his brain, that it would be no such
  difficult matter to destroy an inconvenient witness, and retain the favour of
  an exacting mistress at the same time. It was but a grain or two of poison in
  the slave's last meal, and he might depart in peace, a doomed man, to
  Valeria's mansion. He would take the chance of his silence for the few hours
  that intervened, and after all, the ravings of one whose brow was already
  stamped with death would arouse little suspicion. Afterwards it would be easy
  to pacify Valeria, and shift the blame on some over-zealous freedman, or
  officious client. He did not calculate on the haste with which women jump to
  conclusions. Valeria clapped her hands with unusual glee. "Quick! Myrrhina,"
  said she. "my tablets to the tribune. He shall write the order here, and my
  people can go for the slave and bring him back, before Placidus departs."</p>

  <p>"Nay," interposed the latter in some confusion. "it is indispensable that
  I go home at once. I have already lingered here too long. Farewell, Valeria.
  Ere the sun goes down you shall see that Placidus is proud and happy to obey
  your lightest whim."</p>

  <p>With these words, he made a low obeisance, and, ere his hostess could stop
  him, had traversed the outer hall, and mounted in his chariot. Valeria seemed
  half stupefied by this sudden departure, but ere the rolls of his wheels had
  died away, a light gleamed in her eyes, and summoning the little negro, who
  had lain unnoticed and coiled up within call during the interview, she bade
  him run out and see which direction the chariot took, then she stared wildly
  in Myrrhina's face, and burst into a strange, half-choking laugh.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-03"
     id="ch2-03">III</a>. &mdash; "FURENS QUID FOEMINA"</h2>

  <p class="first">"THE chariot has turned into the Flaminian Way," said the
  urchin, running breathlessly back to his mistress. "Oh! so fast! so fast!"
  and he clapped his little black hands with the indescribable delight all
  children take in rapidity of movement.</p>

  <p>"The Flaminian Way!" repeated Valeria. "He must go round by the Great Gate
  and the Triumphal Arches to get home. Myrrhina, if we make haste, we shall
  yet be in time."</p>

  <p>In less than ten minutes the two women had crossed the wide pleasure-
  grounds which skirted Valeria's mansion, and had let themselves out by a
  pass-key into the street. So complete, however, was their transformation that
  the most intimate friend would have failed to recognise in these shrouded,
  hurrying figures, the fashionable Roman lady and her attendant. A wig of
  curling yellow hair covered Valeria's nut-brown tresses, and the lower part
  of her face was concealed by a mask, whilst Myrrhina, closely-veiled and
  wrapped in a dark-coloured mantle, stained and threadbare with many a
  winter's storm, looked like some honest child of poverty, bound on one of the
  humble errands of daily plebeian life. As they tripped rapidly along a narrow
  and little frequented street,&mdash;one of the many inconvenient
  thoroughfares which Nero's great fire had spared, and which still intersected
  the magnificence of the Imperial City,&mdash;they had to pass a
  miserable-looking house, with a low shabby doorway, which was yet secured by
  strong fastenings of bolts and bars, as though its tenant had sufficient
  motives for affecting privacy and retirement. The women looked meaningly at
  each other while they approached it, for the dwelling of Petosiris the
  Egyptian was too well known to all who led a life of pleasure or intrigue in
  Rome. He it was who provided potions, love philtres, charms of every
  description, and whom the superstitious of all classes, no trifling majority,
  young and old, rich and poor, male and female, consulted in matters of
  interest and affection; the supplanting of a rival, the acquisition of a
  heart, and the removal of those who stood in the way either of a fortune or a
  conquest. It is needless to observe that the Egyptian's wealth increased
  rapidly; and that humbler visitors had to turn from his door disappointed,
  day after day, waiting the leisure of the celebrated magician.</p>

  <p>But if Valeria hurried breathlessly through the dirty and ill-conditioned
  street, she stopped transfixed when she reached its farthest extremity, and
  beheld the tribune's chariot, standing empty in the shade, as though waiting
  for its master. The white horses beguiled their period of inaction in the
  heat, by stamping, snorting, and tossing their heads, while Automedon, now
  nodding drowsily, now staring vacantly about him, scarcely noticed the
  figures of the two women, so well were they disguised.</p>

  <p>"What can he be doing there?" whispered Valeria anxiously; and Myrrhina
  replied in the same cautious tones, "If Placidus be trafficking for philtres
  with the Egyptian, take my word for it, madam, there will be less of love
  than murder in the draught!"</p>

  <p>Then they hurried on faster than before, as if life and death hung upon
  the rapidity of their footsteps.</p>

  <p>Far back, up a narrow staircase, in a dark and secluded chamber, sat
  Petosiris, surrounded by the implements of his art. Enormous as his wealth
  was supposed to be, he suffered no symptoms of it to appear, either in his
  dwelling or his apparel. The walls of his chamber were bare and
  weather-stained, totally devoid of ornament, save for a mystic figure traced
  here and there on their surface, while the floor was scorched, and the
  ceiling blackened, with the burning liquids that had fallen on the one, and
  the heavy aromatic vapours that clung about the other. The magician's own
  robe, though once of costly materials, and surrounded with a broad border, on
  which cabalistic signs and numerals were worked in golden thread, now sadly
  frayed, was worn to the last degree of tenuity, and his linen head-dress,
  wound in a multiplicity of folds, till it rose into a peak some two feet
  high, was yellow with dirt and neglect. Under this grotesque covering peered
  forth a pair of shrewd black eyes, set in a grave emaciated face. They
  denoted cunning, audacity, and that restless vigilance which argued some
  deficiency or warping of the brain, a tendency, however remote, to insanity,
  from which, with all their mental powers, these impostors are seldom free.
  There was nothing else remarkable about the man. He had the deep yellow tint
  with the supple figure and peculiar nostril of the Egyptian, and when he rose
  in compliment to his visitor, his low stature afforded a quaint contrast to
  his trailing robes and real dignity of bearing.</p>

  <p>The tribune for he it was whose entrance disturbed the calculations on
  which the magician was engaged accosted the latter with an air of abrupt and
  almost contemptuous familiarity. It was evident that Placidus was a good
  customer, one who bought largely while he paid freely; and Petosiris,
  throwing aside all assumption of mystery or preoccupation, laughed pleasantly
  as he returned the greeting. Yet was there something jarring in his laugh,
  something startling in his abrupt transition to the profoundest gravity; and
  though his small glittering eyes betrayed a schoolboy's love of mischief,
  gleams shot from them at intervals which expressed a diabolical malice, and
  love of evil for evil's sake.</p>

  <p>"Despatch, my man of science!" said the tribune, scarcely noticing the
  obeisance and expressions of regard lavished on him by his host. "As usual I
  have little time to spare, and less inclination to enter into particulars.
  Give me what I want you have it here in abundance and let me begone out of
  this atmosphere, which is enough to stifle the lungs of an honest man!"</p>

  <p>"My lord! my illustrious patron! my worthiest friend!" replied the other,
  with evident enjoyment of his customer's impatience, "you have but to
  command, you know it well, and I obey. Have I not served you faithfully in
  all my dealings? Was not the horoscope right to a minute? Did not the charm
  protect from evil? and the love philtre ensure success? Have I ever failed,
  my noble employer? Speak, mighty tribune; thy slave listens to obey."</p>

  <p>"Words! words!" replied the other impatiently. "You know what I require.
  Produce it, there is the price!"</p>

  <p>At the same time he threw a bag of gold on the floor, the weight of which
  inferred that secrecy must constitute no small portion of the bargain it was
  to purchase. Though he affected utter unconsciousness, the Egyptian's eyes
  flashed at the welcome chink of the metal against the boards; none the more,
  however, would he abstain from tantalising the donor by assuming a
  misapprehension of his meaning.</p>

  <p>"The hour," said he. "is not propitious for casting a horoscope. Evil
  planets are in the ascendant, and the influence of the good genius is
  counteracted by antagonistic spells. Thus much I can tell you, noble tribune,
  they are of barbarian origin. Come again an hour later to-morrow, and I will
  do your bidding."</p>

  <p>"Fool!" exclaimed Placidus impatiently, at the same time raising his foot
  as though to spurn the magician like a dog. "Does a man give half a helmetful
  of gold for a few syllables of jargon scrawled on a bit of scorched
  parchment? You keep but one sort of wares that fetch a price like this. Let
  me have the strongest of them."</p>

  <p>Neither the gesture, nor the insult it implied, was lost on the Egyptian.
  Yet he preserved a calm and imperturbable demeanour, while he continued his
  irritating inquiries.</p>

  <p>"A philtre, noble patron? A love philtre? They are indeed worth any amount
  of gold. Maid or matron, vestal virgin or Athenian courtesan, three drops of
  that clear tasteless fluid, and she is your own!"</p>

  <p>The tribune's evil smile was deepening round his mouth&mdash; it was not
  safe to jest with him any further; he stooped over the magician and whispered
  two words in his ear; the latter looked up with an expression in which
  curiosity, horror, and a perverted kind of admiration, were strangely
  blended. Then his eyes twinkled once more with the schoolboy's mirth and
  malice, while he ransacked a massive ebony cabinet, and drew forth a tiny
  phial from its secret drawer. Wrapping this in a thin scroll, on which was
  written the word <i>Cave</i> (beware!) to denote the fatal nature of its
  contents, he hurried it into the tribune's hands, hid away the bag of gold,
  and in a voice trembling with emotion, bade his visitor begone, an injunction
  which Placidus obeyed with his usual easy carelessness of demeanour, stepping
  daintily into his chariot, as though his errand had been of the most
  benevolent and harmless kind.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Valeria, accompanied by her attendant, had reached the
  tribune's house, which she entered with a bold front indeed, but with shaking
  limbs. Despite her undaunted nature, all the fears and weaknesses of her sex
  were aroused by the task she had set herself to fulfil, and her woman's
  instinct told her that, whatever might be her motives, the crossing of this
  notorious threshold was an act she would bitterly repent at some future time.
  Myrrhina entertained no such misgivings; she looked on the whole proceeding
  as an opportunity to display her own talents for intrigue, and make herself,
  if possible, more necessary than ever to the mistress with whose secrets she
  was so dangerously familiar.</p>

  <p>In the outer hall were lounging a few slaves and freedmen, who welcomed
  the entrance of the two women with considerably less respect than one of them
  at least was accustomed to consider her due. Damasippus, indeed, with a
  coarse jest, strove to snatch away the mask that concealed the lower part of
  Valeria's face, but she released herself from his hold so energetically as to
  send him reeling back half a dozen paces, not a little discomfited by the
  unexpected strength of that shapely white arm. Then drawing herself to her
  full height, and throwing her disguise upon the floor, she confronted the
  astonished freedman in her own person, and bade him stand out of her way.</p>

  <p>"I am Valeria!" said she. "and here by your master's invitation, slave!
  for what are you better than a mere slave after all? If I were to hint at
  your insolence, he would have you tied to that doorpost, in despite of your
  citizenship, and scourged to death, like a disobedient hound. Pick up those
  things," she added loftily, "and show me, some of you, to the private
  apartment of your lord. Myrrhina, you may remain outside, but within
  call."</p>

  <p>Completely cowed by her demeanour, and no whit relishing the tone in which
  she threatened him, Damasippus did as he was commanded; while a couple of
  slaves, who had remained till now in the background, ushered the visitor into
  another apartment, where they left her with many obsequious assurances that
  their lord was expected home every moment.</p>

  <p>Every moment! Then there was no time to lose. How her heart beat, and what
  a strange instinct it was that made her feel she was in the vicinity of the
  man she loved! As yet she had formed no plan, she had made no determination,
  she only knew he was in danger, he was to die, and come what might, at any
  risk, at any sacrifice, her place was by his side. Imminent as was the peril,
  critical as was the moment, through all the tumult of her feelings, she was
  conscious of a vague wild happiness to be near him; and as she walked up and
  down the polished floor, counting its tesselated squares mechanically, in her
  strong mental excitement, she pressed both hands hard against her bosom, as
  though to keep the heart within from beating so fiercely, and to collect all
  its energies by sheer strength and force of will.</p>

  <p>Thus pacing to and fro, running over in her mind every possible and
  impossible scheme for the discovery and release of the slave, whose very
  prison she had yet to search out, her quick ear caught the dull and distant
  clank of a chain. The sound reached her from an opposite direction to that of
  the principal entrance; and as all Roman houses were constructed on nearly
  the same plan, Valeria had no fear of losing her way among the roomy halls
  and long corridors of her admirer's mansion. She held her breath as she
  hurried on, fortunately without meeting a human being, for the household
  slaves of both sexes had disposed themselves in shady nooks and corners to
  sleep away the sultriest hours of the day; nor did she stop till she reached
  a heavy crimson curtain, screening an inner court, paved and walled by slabs
  of white stone that refracted the sun's rays with painful intensity. Here she
  stood still and listened, while her very lips grew white with emotion, then
  she drew the curtain, and looked into the court.</p>

  <p>He had dragged himself as far as his chain would permit, to get the
  benefit of some two feet of shade close under the stifling wall. A water-jar,
  long since emptied, stood on the floor beside him, accompanied by a crust of
  black mouldy bread. A heavy iron collar, which defied alike strength and
  ingenuity, was round his throat, while the massive links that connected it
  with an iron staple let into the pavement would have held an elephant. It was
  obvious the prisoner could neither stand nor even sit upright without
  constraint; and the white skin of his neck and shoulders was already galled
  and blistered in his efforts to obtain relief by occasional change of
  posture. Without the key of the heavy padlock that fastened chain and collar,
  Vulcan himself could scarcely have released the Briton; and Valeria's heart
  sank within her as she gazed helplessly round, and thought of what little
  avail were her own delicate fingers for such a task. There seemed no nearer
  prospect of help even now that she had reached him; and she clenched her hand
  with anger while she reflected how he must have suffered from heat, and
  thirst, and physical pain, besides the sense of his degradation and the
  certainty of his doom.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, extended there upon the hard glowing stones, Esca was
  sleeping as sound and peacefully as an infant. His head was pillowed on one
  massive arm, half hidden in the clustering yellow locks that showered across
  it, and his large shoulders rose and fell regularly with the measured
  breathing of a deep and dreamless slumber. She stole nearer softly, as afraid
  to wake him, and for a moment came upon Valeria's face something of the deep
  and holy tenderness with which a mother looks upon a child. Yet light as was
  that dainty footstep it disturbed, without actually rousing, the watchful
  instincts of the sleeper. He stirred and turned his face upwards with a
  movement of impatience, while she, hanging over him and drinking in the
  beauty that had made such wild work with her tranquillity, as if her life had
  neither hope nor fear beyond the ecstasy of the moment, gazed on his fair
  features and his closed eyes, till she forgot time and place and hazard, the
  emergency of the occasion, and the errand on which she had herself come.
  Deeper and deeper sank into her being the dangerous influence of the hour and
  the situation. The summer sky above, the hot dreamy solitude around, and
  there, down at her feet&mdash; nay, so near, that, while she bent over him,
  his warm breath stirred the very hair upon her brow&mdash;the only face of
  man that had ever thrilled her heart, sleeping so calmly close to her own,
  and now made doubly dear by all it had suffered, all it was fated to undergo.
  Lower and lower, nearer and nearer, bent her dainty head to meet the slave's;
  and as he stirred once more in his sleep, and a quiet smile stole over his
  unconscious countenance, her lips clung to his in one long, loving, and
  impassioned kiss.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-04"
     id="ch2-04">IV</a>. &mdash; THE LOVING CUP</h2>

  <p class="first">AS he opened his dreamy eyes she started to her feet, for
  voices now broke in on the silence that had hitherto reigned throughout the
  household, and the tread of slaves bustling to and fro announced the return
  of their lord, a master who brooked no neglect, as well they knew, from those
  who were in his service. She had scarcely risen from her posture of soothing
  and devoted affection; scarcely had time to shake the long hair off her face,
  when Julius Placidus entered the court and stood before her with that
  inscrutable expression of countenance which most she hated, and which left
  her in complete ignorance as to whether or not he had been in time to witness
  the caresses she had lavished on the captive. And now Valeria vindicated the
  woman's nature of which, with all her faults, she partook so largely. At this
  critical moment her courage and presence of mind rose with the occasion; and
  though, womanlike, she had recourse to dissimulation, that refuge of the
  weak, there was something on her brow that argued, if need were, she would
  not shrink from the last desperate resources of the strong. Turning to the
  tribune with the quiet dignity and the playful smile that she knew became her
  so well, she pointed to the recumbent figure of the Briton, and said
  gently&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You gave him to me, and I am here to fetch him. Why is it that of late I
  value your lightest gift so much? Placidus, what must you think of me, to
  have come unbidden to your house?"</p>

  <p>Then she cast down her eyes and drooped her stately head, as though ready
  to sink in an agony of love and shame. Deceiver, intriguer, as he had been
  ever since the down was on his chin, he was no match for her. He shot,
  indeed, one sharp inquisitive glance at Esca, but the slave's bewildered gaze
  reassured him. The latter, worn out with trouble and privation, was only half
  awake, and almost imagined himself in a dream. Then the tribune's looks
  softened as they rested on his mistress; and, although there was a gleam of
  malicious triumph on his brow, the hard unmeaning expression left his face,
  which brightened with more of kindness and cordiality than was its wont.</p>

  <p>"It is no longer house of mine," said he. "but of yours, beautiful
  Valeria! Here you are ever welcome, and here you will remain, will you not,
  with him who loves you better than all the world besides?"</p>

  <p>Even while he spoke she had run over in her mind the exigencies and
  difficulties of her position. In that instant of time she could think of
  Esca's danger&mdash;of the necessity that she should herself be present to
  save him from the fate with which, for some special reason that she was also
  determined to find out, he was obviously threatened of the tribune's infamous
  character, and her own fair fame; for Cornelia might not have left such a
  house as that with her reputation unscathed, and Valeria could far less
  afford to tamper with so fragile and shadowy a possession than the severe
  mother of the Gracchi. Yet her brow was unclouded, and there was nothing but
  frank good-humour in her tone while she replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nay, Placidus. You know that even we of the patrician order cannot do
  always as we would. Surely I have risked enough already;
  because&mdash;because I fancied you left me in anger, and I could not bear
  the thought even for an hour. I will but ask you for a cup of wine and
  begone. Myrrhina accompanied me here, and we can return, unknown and
  unsuspected, as we came."</p>

  <p>He wished nothing better. A cup of wine, a sumptuous feast spread on the
  moment, garlands of flowers, heavy perfumes loading the sultry air; soft
  music stealing on the senses gently as the faint breeze that whispered
  through the drowsy shade. All the voluptuous accessories so adapted to a
  pleading tongue and so dangerous to a willing ear. He had never known them
  fail; it should not be the fault of master or household if they proved
  useless now.</p>

  <p>He took Valeria respectfully by the hand, and led her to the large
  banqueting-hall with as much deference as though she had been Caesar's wife.
  None knew better than the tribune how scrupulously all the honours of war
  must be paid to a fortress about to capitulate. As he bent before her, the
  phial he had purchased from Petosiris peeped forth in the bosom of his tunic,
  and her quick eye did not fail to detect it. In an instant she turned back as
  though stumbling on the skirt of her robe, and in the action made a rapid
  sign to Esca by raising her hand to her mouth, accompanied by a warning shake
  of the head and a glance from her eloquent eyes, that she trusted he would
  understand as forbidding him to taste either food or drink till her return.
  Once more, whilst she made this covert signal, the set and passionless look
  came over the tribune's face. Cunning, cautious as she might think herself,
  his snake-like eye had seen enough. At that moment Placidus had resolved Esca
  should die within the hour. Then those two walked gracefully into the
  adjoining hall, and seated themselves at the banquet with a scrupulous
  courtesy and strict observance of the outward forms of good breeding; while
  the slaves who waited believed that the whole proceeding was but one of their
  lord's usual affairs of gallantry, and that the noble pair before them loved
  each other well.</p>

  <p>The tribune, like the rest of his sex, was no large eater when making
  love; and an appetite that could accompany Vitellius through the most
  elaborate banquets of the gluttonous Caesar was satisfied with a handful of
  dates and a bunch or two of grapes in the presence of Valeria. She, too, in
  her anxiety and agitation, felt as if every morsel would choke her; but she
  pledged her host willingly in a goblet of red Falernian, with a vague idea
  that every moment she could keep his attention employed was of priceless
  value, clingingly almost hopelessly to the chance of obtaining by some means
  the possession of the fatal phial before it was too late.</p>

  <p>He was in high spirits,&mdash;voluble, witty, eloquent, sarcastic, but
  devoted to her. In the moment, as he hoped, of his triumph he could afford to
  show, or rather to affect, more of delicacy and generosity than she had
  believed him to possess, and she loathed and hated him all the more. Once,
  when, after enunciating a sentiment of the warmest regard and attachment, she
  caught the expression of his eyes as they looked into her own, she glanced
  wildly round the room, and clenched her hand with rage to observe that the
  walls were bare of weapons. He was no stately, high-spirited Agamemnon, this
  supple intriguer, yet had there been sword, axe, or dagger within reach of
  that white arm, she would have asked nothing better than to enact the part of
  Clytemnestra. How she wished to be a man for the moment ay, and a strong one!
  She felt she could have strangled him there, hateful and smiling on the
  couch! Oh! for Esca's thews and sinews! Esca&mdash;so fair, and brave, and
  honest! Her brain swam when she thought of him chained, like a beast, within
  ten paces of her. An effort must be made to save him at any risk and at any
  sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Placidus talked gaily on, broaching in turn those topics of luxury,
  dissipation, and even vice, which constituted the everyday life of the
  patrician order at Rome, and she forced herself to reply with an affected
  levity and indifference that nearly drove her mad. Caesar's banquets;
  Galeria's yellow head-gear, and the bad taste in which her jewels were set,
  so inexcusable in an emperor's wife; the war in Judaea; the last chariot
  race; and the rival merits of the Red and Green factions, were canvassed and
  dismissed with a light word and a happy jest. Such subjects inevitably led to
  a discussion on the arena and its combatants, the magnificence of the late
  exhibition, and the tribune's own prowess in the deadly game. Placidus turned
  suddenly, as if recollecting himself, called for a slave, whispered an order
  in his ear, and bade him begone. The man hastened from the room, leaving
  lover and mistress once more alone.</p>

  <p>The presence of mind and self-command on which she prided herself now
  completely deserted Valeria. In an agony of alarm for Esca, she jumped at
  once to the conclusion that his doom was gone forth. The tribune, turning to
  her with some choice phrase, half-jest, half-compliment, was startled to
  observe her face colourless to the very lips, while her large eyes shone with
  a fierce, unnatural light. Uttering a low stifled cry, like that of some wild
  animal in its death-pang, she fell at his feet, clasping him round the knees,
  and gasped out&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Spare him! spare him! Placidus&mdash;beloved Placidus! spare
  him&mdash;for <i>my</i> sake!"</p>

  <p>Her host, whose whole mind at that moment was occupied with thoughts very
  foreign to bloodshed, and whose whispered mandate had reference to nothing
  more deadly than orders for a strain of unexpected music, gazed in
  astonishment at the proud woman thus humbled before him to the dust. He had,
  indeed, intended to despatch Esca quietly by poison before nightfall, and so
  get rid at once of an inconvenient witness and a possible rival; but for the
  present he had dismissed the slave completely from his mind. If, an hour ago,
  he had allowed himself to harbour such a wild fancy, as that a mere barbarian
  should have captivated the woman on whom he had set his affections, her
  voluntary acceptance of his hospitality and her cordial demeanour since, had
  dispelled so foolish and unjust a suspicion, which he wondered he could have
  entertained even for a moment. Now, however, a chill seemed to curdle the
  blood about his heart. Very quietly he raised her from the floor; but, though
  he was not conscious of it, his grasp left a mark upon her wrist. Very
  distinct and steady were the tones in which he soothed her, asking
  courteously&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Whom do you wish me to spare? What is it, Valeria? Surely you are not
  still dwelling on that barbarian slave? What is he, to come between you and
  me? It is too late&mdash; too late!"</p>

  <p>"Never! never!" she gasped out, seizing his hand in both her own, and
  folding it to her breast. "It is no time now for concealment; no time for
  choice phrases, and mock reserve, and false shame! I love him, Placidus! I
  love him!&mdash;do you hear? Grant me but his life, and ask me for everything
  I have in return!"</p>

  <p>She looked beautiful as she knelt before him once more, so dishevelled and
  disordered, with upturned face and streaming hair. It seemed to the tribune
  as though a knife had been driven home to his heart; but he collected all his
  energies for a revenge commensurate to the hurt, as he threw himself
  indolently on the couch, a worse man by a whole age of malice than he had
  risen from it a few seconds before.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not tell me sooner?" said he, in accents of the calmest
  courtesy and self-command. "Fair Valeria! not more bargains are driven every
  day in the Forum than in the courts of Love! You offer liberal terms. It
  seems to me we have nothing left to do but to settle the remainder of the
  agreement."</p>

  <p>What a price was she paying for her interference! Not a woman in Rome
  could have felt more deeply the degradation she was accepting, the insult to
  which she was submitting; and through it all she was miserably conscious of a
  false move in the game she had the temerity to play against this formidable
  adversary. Still she had resolved that she would shrink from no humiliation
  to save Esca, and she blushed blood-red with anger and shame as she rose from
  her knees, hid her face in her hands, while she summoned her woman's wit and
  her woman's powers of endurance to help her in the emergency.</p>

  <p>He, too, had bethought him of an appropriate revenge. The tribune never
  forgave; for such an offence as the present it was his nature to seek
  reprisals, exceeding, in their subtle cruelty, the injury they were to atone.
  There is no venom so deadly as a bad man's love turned to gall. It would be
  fine sport, thought Placidus, to make her slay this yellow-haired darling of
  hers with her own hand. The triumph would be complete, when he had outwitted
  her at every point, and could sneer politely over the dead body of the man,
  and the passionate reproaches of the woman. The first step to so tempting a
  consummation was, of course, to put her off her guard, and for this it would
  be necessary to assume some natural displeasure and pique; too open a brow
  would surely arouse suspicions, so he spoke angrily, in the harsh excited
  tones of a generous man who has been wronged.</p>

  <p>"I have been deceived," said he, striking his hand against the board;
  "deceived, duped, scorned, and by you, Valeria, from whom I did not deserve
  it. Shame on the woman who could thus wring an honest heart for the mere
  triumph of her vanity! And yet," he added, with an admirable appearance of
  wounded feeling in his lowered voice and relenting accents. "I can forgive,
  because I would not others should suffer as I do now. Yes, Valeria's wishes
  are still laws to me; I <i>will</i> spare him for your sake, and you shall
  bear the news to him yourself. But he must be half dead ere this, of thirst
  and exhaustion; take him a cup of wine with your own fair hands, and tell him
  he will be a free man before sunset!"</p>

  <p>While he spoke, he turned from her to a sideboard, on which stood a tall
  jar of Falernian, flanked by a pair of silver goblets. She had sunk from the
  couch beside him, and was resting her head upon the table; but she looked up
  quickly for a moment, and saw his back reflected in the burnished surface of
  a gold vase that stood before her. By the motion of his shoulders she was
  aware that he had taken something from his bosom while he filled the wine.
  The whole danger of the situation flashed upon her at once; she felt
  intuitively that one of the cups was poisoned; she could risk her life to
  find out which. Her tears were dried, her nerves were strung, as if by magic;
  like a different being she rose to her feet now, pale and beautiful, but
  perfectly calm and composed.</p>

  <p>"You do love me, Placidus," said she, raising one of the goblets from the
  salver on which they stood. "Such truth as yours might win any woman. I
  pledge you, to show that we are friends again at least, if nothing more!"</p>

  <p>She was in the act of putting it to her lips, when he interposed, somewhat
  hurriedly, and with a voice not so steady as usual&mdash;</p>

  <p>"One moment!" he exclaimed, taking it from her hand, and setting it down
  again in its place. "we have not made our terms yet; the treaty must be
  signed and sealed; a libation must be poured to the gods. It is a strong
  rough wine, that Falernian: I have some Coan here you would like better. You
  see I have not forgotten your tastes."</p>

  <p>He laughed nervously, and his lip twitched; she knew now that it was the
  right-hand goblet which held the poison. Both were equally full, and they
  stood close together on the salver.</p>

  <p>"And this man could not slay me after all," was the thought that for a
  moment softened her heart, and bade her acknowledge some shadow of
  compunction for her admirer. Bad as he was, she could not help reflecting
  that to her influence he owed the only real feeling his life had ever known,
  and it made her waver, but not for long. Soon the image of Esca, chained and
  prostrate, passed before her, and the remembrance of her odious bargain
  goaded her into the bitterest hatred once more.</p>

  <p>She placed her hand in the tribune's with the abandonment of a woman who
  really loves, she turned her eyes on his with the swimming glance of which
  she had not miscalculated the power.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," she murmured. "I have never valued you, never known you till
  now. I was heartless, unfeeling, mad; but I have learned a lesson to-day that
  neither of us will ever forget. No, we will never quarrel again!"</p>

  <p>He clasped her in his arms, he took her to his heart, his brain reeled,
  his senses failed him, that bewitching beauty seemed to pervade his being, to
  surround him with its fragrance like some intoxicating vapour; and whilst his
  frame thrilled, and his lips murmured out broken words of fondness, the white
  hand thrown so confidingly across his shoulder had shifted the position of
  the goblets, and the heart that beat so wildly against his own had doomed him
  remorselessly to die.</p>

  <p>She extricated herself from his embrace, she put her hair back from her
  brow; love is blind, indeed, or it must have struck him that instead of
  blushing with conscious fondness, her cheek was as white and cold as marble,
  though she kept her eyes cast down as if they dared not meet his own.</p>

  <p>"Pledge me," said she, in a tone of the utmost softness, and forcing a
  playful smile that remained, carved as it were, in fixed lines round her
  mouth; "drink to me in token of forgiveness; it will be the sweetest draught
  I have ever tasted when your lips have kissed the cup."</p>

  <p>He reached his hand out gaily to the salver. Her heart stood still in the
  agony of her suspense, lest he should mark the change she had made so warily;
  but the goblets were exactly alike, and he seized the nearest without
  hesitation, and half-emptied it ere he set it down. Laughing, he was in the
  act of handing to her what remained, when his eye grew dull, his jaw dropped,
  and, stammering some broken syllables, he sank back senseless upon the
  couch.</p>

  <p>She would have almost given Esca's life now to undo the deed. But it was
  no time for repentance or indecision; keeping her eyes off the white vacant
  face, which yet seemed ever before her, she felt resolutely in the bosom of
  the tribune's tunic for the precious key, and having found it, walked
  steadily to the door and listened. It was well she did so, for a slave's step
  was heard rapidly approaching, and she had but time to return, on tiptoe, and
  take her place upon the couch ere the domestic entered; disposing of the
  tribune's powerless head upon her lap as though he had sunk to sleep in her
  embrace. The slave discreetly retired, but short as was its duration, the
  torture of those few seconds was hardly inadequate to the guilt that had
  preceded them. Then she hurried through the well-known passages, and reached
  the court in which Esca was confined. Not a word of explanation, not a
  syllable of fondness escaped her lips as she calmly liberated the man for
  whom she had risked so much. Mechanically, and like a sleep-walker, she
  unlocked the collar round his neck, signing to him at the same time, for she
  seemed incapable of speech, to rise and follow her. He obeyed, scarce knowing
  what he did, astonished at the apparition of his deliverer, and almost scared
  by her ghastly looks and strange imperious gestures. Thus they threaded,
  without interruption, the passages of the house, and emerged from the private
  entrance into the now silent and deserted street. Then came the reaction;
  Valeria could bear up no longer, and trembling all over while she clung to
  Esca, but for whose arm she must have fallen, she burst into a passion of
  sobs upon his breast.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-05"
     id="ch2-05">V</a>. &mdash; SURGIT AMARI</h2>

  <p class="first">HE had known but few moments of happiness, that proud
  unbending woman, in the course of her artificial life. Now, though remorse
  was gnawing at her heart, there was such a wild delight in the Briton's
  presence, such ecstasy in the consciousness of having saved him, though at
  the price of a hateful crime, that the pleasure kept down and stifled the
  pain. It was a new sensation to cling to that stalwart form and acknowledge
  him for her lord whom others deemed a mere barbarian and a slave. It was
  intense joy to think that she had penetrated his noble character; that she
  had given him her love unasked, when such a gift could alone have saved him
  from destruction; and that she had grudged no price at which to ransom him
  for herself. It was the first time in Valeria's whole existence that she had
  vindicated her woman's birthright of merging her own existence in another's,
  and for the moment this engrossing consciousness completely altered the whole
  character and training of the patrician lady. Myrrhina, walking discreetly
  some ten paces behind, could hardly believe in the identity of that drooping
  form, faltering in step, and timid in gesture, with her imperious and wilful
  mistress. This vigilant damsel, who was never flurried nor surprised, had
  effected her escape from the domestics of the tribune's household, at the
  moment her practised ear caught the light footstep of Valeria making its way
  to the door; and although she scarcely expected to see the latter pacing home
  with the captive at her side, as oblivious of her waiting-maid's existence,
  as of everything else in the world, she was quite satisfied to observe that
  this preoccupation was the result of interest in her companion. So long as an
  intrigue was on foot, it mattered little to Myrrhina who might be its
  originators or its victims.</p>

  <p>They had not proceeded far before Esca stopped, waking up like a man from
  a dream.</p>

  <p>"I owe you my life," he said, in his calm voice and foreign accent, that
  made such music to her ear. "How shall I ever repay you, noble lady? I have
  nothing to give but the strength of my right arm, and of what service can
  such as I be to such as you?"</p>

  <p>She blushed deeply, and cast down her eyes.</p>

  <p>"We are not safe yet," she answered. "We will talk of this when we get
  home."</p>

  <p>He looked before him down the stately street, with its majestic porticoes,
  its towering palaces, and its rows of lofty pillars, stretching on in grand
  perspective till they met the dusky crimson of the evening sky; and perhaps
  he was thinking of a free upland, and blue hills, and laughing sunshine
  glittering on the mere and trembling in the green wood far away at home, for
  he only answered by repeating her last word with a sigh, and adding: " There
  is none for me; a wanderer, an outcast, and a degraded man."</p>

  <p>She seemed to check the outburst that was rising to her lips, and she kept
  her eyes off his face, while she whispered</p>

  <p>"I have determined to save you. Do you not know that there is nothing you
  can ask me which I will not grant?"</p>

  <p>He raised her hand to his lips, but the gesture partook more of the
  dependant's homage than the lover's rapture. She felt instinctively that it
  was a tribute of gratitude and loyalty, not an impassioned caress. For the
  second time, something seemed to warn her she had better have left that day's
  work undone. Then she began to talk rapidly of the dangers they might undergo
  from pursuit, of the necessity for immediate flight to her house, and close
  concealment when there; wandering wildly on from one subject to another, and
  apparently but half-conscious of anything she said. At last he asked her
  eagerly, even sternly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And the tribune? What of him? How could you release me from his power? I
  tell you, I had the life of Placidus in my hand, as completely as if I had
  been standing over him in the amphitheatre with my foot on his neck. Would
  any price have purchased me from him, with all I knew?"</p>

  <p>The crimson rose to her brow as she answered hurriedly, "No price! Believe
  me, no price that man could offer, or woman either! Esca, do not think worse
  of me than I deserve!"</p>

  <p>"Then why am I here?" he continued, with a softened look; "I would like
  well to discover the secret by which Valeria can charm such a man as Placidus
  to her will."</p>

  <p>She was very pale now.</p>

  <p>"The tribune will claim you no more," said she; "I have settled that
  account for ever."</p>

  <p>He did not understand her, yet he dropped the hand he held and walked on a
  little farther from her side. She felt her punishment had already commenced,
  and when she spoke again it was in hard cold accents quite unlike her
  own.</p>

  <p>"He crossed my path, Esca, and he met the fate of all who are rash enough
  to oppose Valeria. What motives of pity, or love, or honour, would avail with
  Placidus? When did he ever swerve a hair's-breadth from his goal for any
  consideration but self? I knew him, ah! too well. There was but one
  invincible argument for the tribune, and I used it. I slew him&mdash;slew him
  there, upon his couch; but it was to save you!"</p>

  <p>Perhaps he felt he was ungrateful. Perhaps he tried to think that he, at
  least, had no right to judge her harshly; that such devotion for his sake
  should have made him look with indulgent eye, even on so foul a crime as
  murder; but he could not control the repugnance and horror that now rose in
  him for this beautiful, reckless, and unscrupulous woman: but while he strove
  to conceal his feelings, and to mask them with an air of deference and
  gratitude, she knew by the instinct of love all that was passing in his
  breast, and suffered, as those only can suffer, who have thrown honour,
  virtue, conscience, everything to the winds, to purchase but the conviction
  that their shameful sacrifice has been in vain. She determined to put a
  period to the tortures she was enduring. Ere this, they had reached the
  street, from which opened the private entrance into her own grounds.
  Myrrhina, though within sight, still kept discreetly in the rear. This was
  the situation, this was the moment that Valeria had pictured to herself in
  many a rapturous day-dream, that seemed too impossibly happy ever to come to
  pass. To have ransomed him from some great danger at some equivalent price;
  to have led him off with her in triumph; those two pacing by themselves
  through the deserted streets at the witching sunset hour; to have brought him
  home her own, her very own, to this identical gate exactly in this manner; to
  have none between them, none to watch them, except faithful Myrrhina, and to
  see before her a long future of uninterrupted sunshine, this it had been
  ecstasy to dream of and now it had come, and brought with it a dull sickening
  sensation that was worse than pain. She had a brave rebellious nature, in
  keeping with the haughty head and stately form hereditary in her line. No
  scion of that noble old house would shrink or quiver under mental, any more
  than under bodily, torture. Among the ancestral busts that graced her
  cornices, was that of one who endured with a calm set face to watch his own
  hand shrivelled up and crackling in the glowing coals. His descendants, male
  and female, partook of that unflinching character; and not Mutius Scaevola
  himself, erect and stern before the Tuscan king, had more of the desperate
  tenacity which sets fate itself at defiance, than lurked under the soft white
  skin, and the ready smile, and the voluptuous beauty of proud Valeria.</p>

  <p>She looked prouder and fairer than ever now, as she stopped at her own
  gate and confronted the Briton.</p>

         title="'You are safe,' she said">

    <p class="caption">"You are safe," she said.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"You are safe," she said, and what it cost her to say it none knew but
  herself. "You are free besides, and at liberty to go where you will."</p>

  <p>The rapture with which he kissed her hand while she spoke, the gleam of
  delight that lit up his whole face, the intense gratitude with which he bowed
  himself to the ground before her, smote like repeated strokes of a dagger to
  her heart. She continued in accents of well-acted indifference, though a less
  preoccupied observer might have marked the quivering eyelid and dilated
  nostril&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You may have friends whom you long to see&mdash;friends who have been
  anxious about your safety. Though it seems," she added, ironically. "they
  have taken but little pains to set you out of danger."</p>

  <p>Esca was always frank and honest; this was, perhaps, the charm that,
  combined with his yellow locks and broad shoulders, so endeared him to the
  Roman lady. She was unaccustomed to these qualities in the men she usually
  met.</p>

  <p>"I have no friends," he answered, rather sadly; "none in the whole of this
  great city, except perhaps yourself, noble lady, who care whether I am alive
  or dead. Yet I have one mission, for the power of performing which this very
  night I thank you far more than for saving my life. To-morrow, it would be
  too late."</p>

  <p>The tone was less that of a question than an assertion, in which she
  forced out the words&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It concerns that dark-eyed girl! Esca, do not fear to tell me the
  truth."</p>

  <p>A faint red stole over the young man's brow. They were standing together
  within the garden-wall on the smooth lawn that sloped towards the house. The
  black cedars cut clear and distinct against the pure serene opal of the
  fading sky. A star or two were dimly visible, and not a breath stirred the
  silent foliage of the holm-oaks, folded as it were in sleep, or the drooping
  flowers, drowsy with the very weight of fragrance they exhaled. It was the
  time and place for a confession of love. What a mockery it seemed to Valeria
  to stand there and watch his rising colour, and listen to the faltering voice
  in which he betrayed his secret!</p>

  <p>"I must save her, noble lady," said he; "I must save her this very night,
  whatever else be left undone. Be he dead or alive, she shall not enter the
  tribune's house, whilst I can strike a blow or grasp an enemy by the throat.
  Lady, you have earned my eternal gratitude, my eternal service; give me but
  this one night, and I return to-morrow to be the humblest and most willing of
  your slaves for ever after."</p>

  <p>"And see her no more?" asked Valeria, with a choking throat and a strong
  tendency to burst into tears.</p>

  <p>"And see her no more," repeated Esca, sadly and resignedly.</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the tone of manly, unselfish, and utterly hopeless
  love. Valeria passed her hand across her face, and tried more than once to
  speak. At last she muttered in a hoarse hard voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You love her then very dearly?"</p>

  <p>He raised his head proudly, and a smile came on his lips, a light into his
  blue eyes. She remembered how he had looked so in the arena, when he gave his
  salute before the imperial chair. She remembered, too, a pair of dark eyes
  and a pale face that followed his every movement.</p>

  <p>"So dearly," was his answer. "that can I but rescue her I will gladly
  bargain to give her up and never even look on her again. How can I think of
  myself when the question is of her happiness and her safety?"</p>

  <p>Valeria with all her faults was a woman. She had indeed dreamed of an
  affection such as this, an affection purified from the dross and alloy that
  combine to form so much of what men call love. She might not be capable of
  feeling it, but, womanlike, she could admire and appreciate the nobility of
  its aspirations, and the ideal standard to which it stretched. Womanlike,
  too, she was not to be outdone in generosity, and Esca's proposal of
  returning to her household, and submitting to her will directly he had
  accomplished his errand, disarmed her completely. She was not accustomed to
  analyse her feelings, or to check the reckless impulse which always bade her
  act on the spur of the moment. She did not stop to consider to-morrow's
  repentance, nor the grudging regrets which would goad her when the excitement
  of her self-denial had died out, and the blank that had hitherto rendered
  existence so dreary would be even less tolerable than before. If a shadowy
  misgiving that she would repent her concession hereafter passed for a moment
  across her mind, she hastened to repress it, ere it should warp her better
  intentions; and she could urge him to leave her now, with all the more
  importunity, that she dared not trust her heart to waver for an instant in
  the sacrifice.</p>

  <p>"You are alone," said she, calming herself with a great effort, and
  speaking very quick. "Alone in this great city, but you are loyal and brave.
  Such men are rare here and are worth a legion. Still, you must have gold in
  your bosom and steel at your belt, if you would succeed. You shall take both
  from me, and you will tell the dark-eyed girl that it was Valeria who saved
  her and you."</p>

  <p>His blue eyes turned upon her with looks of the deepest, the most fervent
  gratitude, and again the wild love surged up in her heart, and threatened to
  swamp every consideration but its own irresistible longing. His answer,
  however, sent it ebbing coldly back again.</p>

  <p>"We shall be ever grateful; oh! that either of us could prove it! We shall
  not forget Valeria."</p>

  <p>Myrrhina thought her mistress had never looked so queenly, as when she
  called her up at this juncture, and bade her fetch a purse of gold from her
  own cabinet, and one of the swords that hung in the vestibule, and deliver
  them to Esca. Then, very erect and pale, Valeria walked towards the house,
  apparently insensible to his thanks and protestations, but turned round ere
  she had reached the threshold, and gave him her hand to kiss. Myrrhina
  returning from her errand, saw the face that was bent over him as he stooped
  in act of homage, and even that hollow-hearted girl was touched by its wild,
  tender, and mournful expression, but ere he could look up, it was cold and
  passionless as marble once more. Then she disappeared slowly through the
  porch, and Myrrhina with all her daring had not the courage to follow her
  into the privacy of her own chamber.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-06"
     id="ch2-06">VI</a>. &mdash; DEAD LEAVES</h2>

  <p class="first">THE stars shone brilliantly down on the roofs of the great
  city&mdash;roofs that covered in how various a multitude of hopes, fears,
  wishes, crimes, joys, study, debaucheries, toil, and repose. What enormities
  were veiled by a tile some half an inch thick! What contrasts separated by a
  partition of a deal plank, and a crevice stopped with mortar! Here, a poor
  worn son of toil, working with bleared eyes and hollow cheeks to complete the
  pittance that a whole day's labour was insufficient to attain; there, a sleek
  pampered slave, snoring greasily on his pallet, drenched with pilfered wine,
  and gorged with the fat leavings of his master's meal. On this side the
  street, a whole family penned helplessly together in a stifling garret; on
  that, a spacious palace, with marble floors, and airy halls, and lofty
  corridors, devoted to the occasional convenience and the shameful pleasures
  of one man a patrician in rank, a senator in office; yet, notwithstanding, a
  profligate, a coward, a traitor, and a debauchee. Could those roofs have been
  taken off; could those chambers have been bared to the million eyes of night
  that seemed to be watching her so intently, what a mass of corruption would
  Imperial Rome have laid bare! There were plague-spots under her purple,
  festering and spreading and eating into the very marrow of the mistress of
  the world. Up six storeys, under the slanting roof, in a miserable garret, a
  scene was being enacted, bad as it was, far below the nightly average of vice
  and treachery in Rome.</p>

  <p>Dismissed from their patron's house when he had no further need of their
  attendance, and, so to speak, off duty for the day, Damasippus and Oarses had
  betaken themselves to their home in order to prepare for the exploits of the
  night. That home was of the cheapest and most wretched among the many cheap
  and wretched lodgings to be found in the overgrown yet crowded city. Four
  bare walls bulging and blistered with the heat, supported the naked rafters
  on which rested the tiles, yet glowing from an afternoon sun. A wooden
  bedstead, rickety and creaking, with a coarse pallet, through the rents of
  which the straw peeped and rustled, occupied one corner, and a broken jar of
  common earthenware, but of a sightly design copied from the Greek, half-full
  of tepid water, stood in another. These constituted the only furniture of the
  apartment, except a few irregular shelves filled with unguents, cosmetics,
  and the inevitable pumice-stone, by which the fashionable Roman studied to
  eradicate every superfluous hair from his unmanly cheek and limbs. A broken
  Chiron, in common plaster, yet showing marks of undoubted genius where the
  shoulders and hoofs of the Centaur had escaped mutilation, kept guard over
  these treasures, and filled a place that in the pious days of the old
  Republic, however humble the dwelling, would have been occupied by the Lares
  and Penates of the hearth. A mouldy crust of bread, slipped from the lid of
  an open trunk full of clothing, lay on the floor, and a wine-jar emptied to
  the dregs stood by its side. The two inhabitants, however, of this squalid
  apartment betrayed in their persons none of the misery in keeping with their
  dwelling-place. They were tolerably well fed, because their meals were
  usually furnished at their patron's expense; they contrived to be well
  dressed, because a decent and even wealthy appearance was creditable to their
  patron's generosity, and indispensable to many of the duties he called upon
  them to perform&mdash;dirty work indeed, but only to be done, nevertheless,
  with clean clothes and an assured countenance; so that the exterior both of
  Damasippus and Oarses would have offered no discredit to the ante-room of
  Caesar himself. But they were men of pleasure as the word is understood in
  great cities&mdash;men who lived solely for the sensual indulgences of the
  body; and it was their nature to spend their gains, chiefly ill-gotten, in
  those debasing luxuries which an insatiable demand enabled Rome to supply to
  her public at the lowest possible cost, to sun themselves, as it were, in the
  glare of that gaudy vice which walks abroad in the streets, and then creep
  back into their loathsome hole, like reptiles as they were.</p>

  <p>Damasippus, whose plump well-rounded form and clear colour afforded a
  remarkable contrast to the lithe shape and sallow tint of Oarses, was the
  first to speak. He had been watching the Egyptian intently, while the latter
  went through the painful and elaborate ceremonies of a protracted toilet,
  rasping his chin with pumice-stone, smoothing and greasing his dark locks
  with a preparation of lard and perfumed oil, and finally drawing a needle
  charged with lampblack carefully and painfully through his closed eyelids, in
  order to lengthen the line of the eye, and give it that soft languishing
  expression so prized by Orientals of either sex. Damasippus, waxing
  impatient, then, at the evident satisfaction with which his friend pursued
  the task of adornment, broke out irritably&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And of course it is to be the old story again! As usual, mine the
  trouble, and, by Hercules! no small share of the danger, now that the town is
  swarming with soldiers, all discontented and ill-paid. While yours, the
  credit, and very likely the reward, and nothing to do but to whine out a few
  coaxing syllables, and make yourself as like an old woman as you can. No
  difficult task either," he added, with a half-sarcastic, half-good-humoured
  laugh.</p>

  <p>The other lingered before a few inches of cracked mirror, which seemed to
  rivet his attention, and put the finishing touches to either eyelid with
  infinite care, ere he replied</p>

  <p>"Every tool to its own work; and every man to his special trade. The
  wooden-headed mallet to drive home the sharp wedge. The brute force of
  Damasippus to support the fine skill of Oarses."</p>

  <p>"And the sword of a Roman," retorted the other, who, like many untried
  men, was somewhat boastful of his mettle. "to hew a path for the needlework
  of an Egyptian. Well, at least the needle is in appropriate hands. By all the
  fountains of Caria thou hast the true feminine leer in thine eye, the very
  swing of thy draperies seems to say, 'Follow me, but not too near.' The clasp
  of Salmacis herself could not have effected a more perfect transformation.
  Oarses, thou lookest an ugly old woman to the life!"</p>

  <p>In truth the Egyptian's disguise was now nearly complete. The dark locks,
  smoothed and flattened, were laid in modest bands about his head; the
  matronly stole, or gown, gathered at the breast by a broad girdle, and
  fastened with a handsome clasp high on the shoulder, descended in long
  sweeping lines to his feet, where it was ornamented by a broad and elaborate
  flounce of embroidery. Over the whole was disposed in graceful folds a large
  square shawl of the finest texture, dark-coloured but woven through with
  glistening golden threads, and further set off by a wide golden fringe. It
  formed a veil and cloak in one, and might easily be arranged to conceal the
  figure as well as the face of the wearer. Oarses was not a little proud of
  the dainty feminine grace with which he wore the head-gear, and as he tripped
  to and fro across the narrow floor of his garret, it would have taken a
  sharper eye than that of keen Damasippus himself to detect the disguise of
  his wily confederate.</p>

  <p>"A woman, my friend," he replied, somewhat testily. "but not such an ugly
  one, after all; as thou wilt find to thy cost when we betake ourselves to the
  streets. I look to thee, my Damasippus," he added maliciously. "to protect
  thy fair companion from annoyance and insult."</p>

  <p>Damasippus was a coward, and he knew it, so he answered stoutly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Let them come, let them come! a dozen at a time if they will. What! a
  good blade and a light helmet is enough for me, though you put me at
  half-sword with a whole maniple of gladiators! The patron knows what manhood
  is, none better. Why should he have selected Damasippus for this enterprise,
  but that he judges my arm is iron, and my heart is oak?"</p>

  <p>"And thy forehead brass," added the Egyptian, scarcely concealing a
  contemptuous smile.</p>

  <p>"And my forehead brass," repeated the other, obviously gratified by the
  compliment. "Nay, friend, the shrinking heart, and the failing arm, and the
  womanly bearing, are no disgrace, perhaps, to a man born by the tepid Nile;
  but we who drink from the Tiber here (and very foul it is)&mdash;we of the
  blood of Romulus, the she-wolf's litter, and the war-god's line&mdash; are
  never so happy as when our feet are reeling in the press of battle, our
  hearts leaping to the clash of shields, and our ears deafened by the shout of
  victory. Hark! what is that?"</p>

  <p>The boaster's face turned very pale, and he hastily unbuckled the sword he
  had been girding on while he spoke; for a wild, ominous cry came sweeping
  over the roofs of the adjoining houses, rising and falling, as it seemed,
  with the sway of deadly strife, and boding, in its fierce fluctuations, to
  some a cruel triumph, to others a merciless defeat.</p>

  <p>Oarses heard it too. His dark face scarce looked like a woman's now, with
  its gleam of malicious glee and exulting cunning.</p>

  <p>"The old Praetorians are up," said he quietly. "I have been expecting this
  for a week. Brave soldier, there will be a fill of fighting for thee this
  night in the streets; and goodly spoils, too, for the ready hand, and love
  and wine, and all the rest of it, without the outlay of a farthing."</p>

  <p>"But it will not be safe to be seen in arms now," gasped Damasippus,
  sitting down on the tester-bed, with a white flabby face, and a general
  appearance of being totally unstrung. "Besides," he added, with a ludicrous
  attempt at reasserting his dignity. "a brave Roman should not engage in civil
  war."</p>

  <p>Oarses reflected for a moment, undisturbed by a second shout, that made
  his frightened companion tremble in every limb; then he smoothed his brows,
  and spoke in soothing and persuasive tones.</p>

  <p>"Dost thou not see, my friend, how all is in favour of our undertaking?
  Had the city been quiet, we might have aroused attention, and a dozen chance
  passengers half as brave as thyself might have foiled us at the very moment
  of success. Now, the streets will be clear of small parties, and it is easy
  for us to avoid a large body before it approaches. One act of violence
  amongst the hundreds sure to be committed to-night, will never again be heard
  of. The three or four resolute slaves under thine orders, will be taken to
  belong to one or other of the fighting factions, and thus even the patron's
  spotless character will escape without a blemish. Besides, in such a turmoil
  as we are like to have by sundown, a woman might scream her heart out, and
  nobody would think of noticing her. On with that sword again, my hero, and
  let us go softly down into the street."</p>

  <p>"But if the old Praetorians succeed," urged the other, evincing a great
  disinclination for the adventure. "what will become of Caesar? and with
  Caesar's fall down goes the patron too, and then who is to bear us harmless
  from the effects of our expedition to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! thick-witted Ajax!" answered the Egyptian, laughing; "bold and strong
  in action as the lion; but in council innocent as the lamb. Knowest thou the
  tribune so little as to think he will be on the losing side? If there is
  tumult in Rome, and revolt, and the city boils and seethes like a huge flesh-
  pot casting up its choicest morsels to the surface, dost thou suppose that
  Placidus is not stirring the fire underneath? I tell thee that, come what may
  of Caesar to-night, to-morrow will behold the tribune more popular and more
  powerful than ever; and I for one will beware of disobeying his behests."</p>

  <p>The last argument was not without its effect. Damasippus, though much
  against the grain, was persuaded that of two perils he had better choose the
  lesser; and it speaks well for the ascendency gained by Placidus over his
  followers, that the cleverer and more daring knave should have obeyed him
  unhesitatingly from self-interest, the ruffian and the coward from fear.
  Damasippus, then, girding on his sword once more, and assuming as warlike a
  port as was compatible with his sinking heart, marched down into the street
  to accompany his disguised companion on their nefarious undertaking, with
  many personal fears and misgivings for the result.</p>

  <p>How different, save in its disquietude, was the noble nature at the same
  moment seeking repose and finding none, within half a bow-shot of the garret
  in which these two knaves were plotting. Despite his blameless life, despite
  his distinguished career, Caius L. Licinius sat and brooded, lonely and
  sorrowful, in his stately home. In that noble palace, long ranges of
  galleries and chambers were filled with objects of art and taste, beautiful,
  and costly, and refined. If a yard of the wall had looked bare, it would have
  been adorned forthwith by some trophy of barbaric arms taken in warfare. If a
  corner had seemed empty, it would have been at once filled with an exquisite
  group of marble, wrought into still life by some Greek artist's chisel. Not a
  recess in that pile of building, but spoke of comfort, complete in every
  respect, and the only empty chamber in the whole was its owner's heart. Nay,
  more than empty, for it was haunted by the ghost of a beloved memory, and the
  happiness that was never to come again.</p>

  <p>Cold and dreary is the air of that mysterious tenement where we buried our
  treasures long ago. Cold and dreary, like the atmosphere of the tomb, but a
  perfume hangs about it still, because love, being divine, is therefore
  eternal; and though the turf be laid damp and heavy over the beloved head,
  our tears fall like the blessed rain from heaven, and water the very
  barrenness of the grave, till at length, through weary patience and humble
  resignation, the flowers of hope begin to spring, and faith tells us they
  shall bloom hereafter, in another and a better world.</p>

  <p>Licinius was very lonely, and at a time of life when, perhaps, loneliness
  is most oppressive to the mind. Youth has so much to anticipate, is so full
  of hope, is so sanguine, so daring, that its own dreams are sufficient for
  its sustenance; but in middle age, men have already found out that the mirage
  is but sand and sunshine after all; they look forward, indeed, still, yet
  only from habit, and because the excitement that was once such intoxicating
  rapture, is now but a necessary stimulant. If they have no ties of family, no
  affections to take them out of themselves, they become pompous triflers, or
  despondent recluses, according as their temperaments lead them to inordinate
  self-importance or excessive humility.</p>

  <p>Not so when the quiver is full, and the hearth is merry with the patter of
  little feet, and the ring of childish laughter. There is a charm to dispel
  all the evil, and call up all the good, even of the worst man's nature, in
  the soft white brow, pure from the stamp of sin and care, in the bold bright
  eyes that look up so trustingly to his own. There is a sense of protection
  and responsibility, that few natures are so depraved as to repudiate, in the
  household relationship which acknowledges and obeys the father as its head;
  and there is no man so callous or so reckless, but he would wish to appear
  nobler and better than he is in the eyes of his child. Licinius had none of
  these incentives to virtue; but the lofty nature and the loving heart that
  could worship a memory, and feel that it was a reality still, had kept him
  pure from vice. He had never of late attached himself much to anything, till
  Esca became an inmate of his household; but since he had been in habits of
  daily intercourse with the Briton, a feeling of content and well-being, he
  would have found it difficult to analyse, had gradually crept over him.
  Perhaps he would have remained unconscious of his slave's influence, had it
  not been for the blank occasioned by his departure. He missed him sadly now,
  and wondered why, at every moment of the day, he found himself thinking of
  the pleasant familiar face and frank cordial smile.</p>

  <p>So much alone, he had acquired grave habits of reflection, even of that
  self-examination which is so beneficial an exercise when impartially
  performed, but which men so rarely practise without a self-deception that
  obviates all its good effects. This evening he was in a more thoughtful mood
  than common; this evening, more than ever, it seemed to him that his was an
  aimless, fruitless life; that he had let the material pleasures of existence
  slip through his fingers, and taken nothing in exchange. Of what availed his
  toils, his enterprise, his love of country, his self-denial, his endurance of
  hardship and privation? What was he the better now, that he had marched, and
  watched, and bled, and preserved whole colonies for the empire; and sat
  glorious, crowned with laurels in the triumphal car? He looked round on his
  stately walls, and the trophies that adorned them, thinking the while that
  even such a home as this might be purchased too dear at the expense of a
  lifetime. Gold and marble, corridors and columns, ivory couches and Tyrian
  carpets, were these equivalents for youth's toil and manhood's care, and at
  last a desolate old age? What was this ambition that led men so irresistibly
  up the steepest paths, by the brink of such fatal precipices?</p>

  <p>Had he ever experienced its temptations? He scarcely knew; he could not
  realise them now. Had Guenebra lived, indeed, and had she been his own, he
  might have prized honour and renown, and a name that was on all men's lips,
  for her dear sake. To see the kind eyes brighten; to call up a smile into the
  beloved face, that would surely have been reward enough, and that would never
  be. Then he fell to thinking of the bright days when they were all in all to
  each other, when the very sky seemed fairer, while he watched for her white
  dress under the oak-tree. Was he not perfectly happy then? Would he not at
  least have been perfectly happy could he have called her, as he hoped to do,
  his own? Honesty answered, No. At the very best there was a vague longing, a
  something wanting, a sense of insufficiency, of insecurity, and even
  discontent. If it was so then, how had it been since? Passing over the sharp
  sudden stroke, so numbing his senses at the time that a long interval had to
  elapse ere he awoke to its full agony&mdash;passing over the subsequent days
  of yearning, and nights of vain regret, the desolation that laid waste a
  heart which would bear fruit no more, he reviewed the long years in which he
  had striven to make duty and the love of country fill the void, and was
  forced to confess that here, too, all was barren. There was a something ever
  wanting, even to complete the dull torpor of that resignation which
  philosophy inculcated, and common sense enjoined. What was it? Licinius could
  not answer his own question, though he felt that it must have some solution,
  at which man's destiny intended him to arrive.</p>

  <p>All the Roman knew, all he could realise, was that the spring was gone
  long ago, with her buds of promise, and her laughing morning skies; that the
  glory of summer had passed away, with its lustrous beauty and its burnished
  plains, and its deep dark foliage quivering in the heat; that the blast of
  autumn had strewn the cold earth now with faded flowers and withered leaves,
  and all the wreck of all the hopes that blossomed so tenderly, and bloomed so
  bright and fair. The heaven was cold and grey, and between him and heaven the
  bare branches waved and nodded, mocking, pointing with spectral fingers to
  the dull cheerless sky. Could he but have believed, could he but have vaguely
  imaged to himself that there would come another spring; that belief, that
  vague imagining, had been to Licinius the one inestimable treasure for which
  he would have bartered all else in the world.</p>

  <p>In vain he sought, and looked about him for something on which to lean;
  for something out of, and superior to himself, inspiring him with that sense
  of being protected, for which humanity feels so keen, yet so indefinite, a
  desire. What is the bravest and wisest of mankind, but a child in the dark,
  groping for the parental hand that shall guide its uncertain steps?' Where
  was he to find the ideal that he could honestly worship, on the superiority
  of which he could heartily depend? The mythology of Rome, degraded as it had
  become, was not yet stripped of all the graceful attributes it owed to its
  Hellenic origin. That which was Greek, might indeed be evil, yet it could
  scarce fail to be fair; but what rational man could ground his faith on the
  theocracy of Olympus, or contemplate with any feeling save disgust that
  material Pantheism, in which the lowest even of human vices was exalted into
  a divinity? As well become a worshipper of Isis at once, and prostitute, to
  the utter degradation of the body, all the noblest and fairest imagery of the
  mind. No, the deities that Homer sang were fit subjects for the march of
  those Greek hexameters, sonorous and majestic as the roll of the Aegean sea;
  fit types of sensuous perfection, to be wrought by the Greek chisel, from out
  the veined blocks of smooth, white Parian stone; but for man, intellectual
  man, to bow down before the crafty Hermes, or the thick-witted god of forges,
  or the ambrosial front of father Jove himself, the least ideal of all, was a
  simple absurdity, that could scarce impose upon a woman or a child.</p>

  <p>Licinius had served in the East, and he bethought him now of a nation
  against whom he had stood in arms, brave fierce soldiers, men instinct with
  public virtue and patriotism; whose rites, different from those of all other
  races, were observed with scrupulous fidelity and self-denial. This people,
  he had heard, worshipped a God of whom there was no material type, whose
  being was omnipresent and spiritual, on whom they implicitly depended when
  all else failed, and trusting in whom they never feared to die. But they
  admitted none to partake with them in their advantages, and their faith
  seemed to inculcate hatred of the stranger no less than dissensions and
  strife amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>"Is there nothing, alas! but duty, stern cold duty, to fill this void?"
  thought Licinius. "Be it so, then; my sword shall be once more at the service
  of my country, and I will die in my harness like a Roman and a soldier at the
  last!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-07"
     id="ch2-07">VII</a>. &mdash; "HABET!"</h2>

  <p class="first">HIPPIAS, the fencing-master, had completed his preparations
  for the night. With a certain military instinct, as necessary to his
  profession as to that of the 'legitimate soldier, he could rely upon his own
  dispositions, when they were once made, with perfect confidence, and a total
  absence of anxiety for the result. Like all men habituated to constant
  strife, he was never so completely in his element as when surrounded by
  perils, only to be warded off by cool, vigilant courage; and though he may
  have had moments in which he longed for the softer joys of affection and
  repose, it needed but the clang of a buckler, or the gleam of a sword, to
  rouse him into his fiercer self once more.</p>

  <p>It had been his habit to attend Valeria, for the purpose of instructing
  her in swordsmanship, by an hour's practice on certain appointed days.
  Everything connected with the amphitheatre possessed at this period such a
  morbid fascination for all classes of the Roman people, that even ladies of
  rank esteemed it a desirable accomplishment to understand the use of the
  sword; and it is said that on more than one occasion women of noble birth had
  been known to take part in the deadly games themselves. These, however, were
  rare instances of such complete defiance of all modesty and even natural
  feeling; but to thrust, and shout, and stamp, in the conflict of mimic
  warfare, was simply esteemed the regular exercise and the healthy excitement
  of every patrician dame who aspired to a fashionable reputation. Such
  sudorifics, accompanied by excessive use of the bath and a free indulgence in
  slaking the thirst, arising from so severe a course of treatment, must have
  been highly detrimental to female beauty; but even this consideration was
  postponed to the absorbing claims of fashion, and then, as now, a woman was
  content and pleased to disfigure herself by any process, however painful and
  inconvenient, providing other women did the same.</p>

  <p>It is possible, too, that the manly symmetry of form, the tough thews and
  sinews of their instructors, were not without effect on pupils, whose hearts
  softened in proportion as their muscles became hard, and whose whole habits
  and education tended to interest them in the person and profession of the
  gladiator. Be this as it may, the fencing-masters of Rome had but little time
  left on their hands, and, of these, Hippias was doubtless the most sought
  after by the fair. It was his custom to neglect nothing, however trifling,
  connected with his calling. No details were too small to be attended to by
  one whose daily profession taught him that life and victory might depend on
  the mere quiver of an eyelid, the accidental slip of a buckle; and, besides,
  he took a strange pride in his deadly trade, and especially in the methodical
  regularity with which he carried it out. Though bound tonight for the
  desperate enterprise which should make or mar him; though confident that, in
  either event, he would tomorrow be far beyond the necessities of a gladiator,
  it was part of his character to play out his part thoroughly to-day. Valeria
  would expect him, as usual, before the bathing-hour on the following morning.
  It was but decent he should leave a message at her house that he might be
  detained. The very wording of his excuse brought to his mind the
  possibilities of the next few hours&mdash;the many chances of failure in the
  enterprise, failure which, to him at least, the leader of desperate men, was
  synonymous with certain death.</p>

  <p>To-day, for the first time, as he turned his steps towards her mansion, a
  soft, half-sorrowful, yet not unpleasing sensation stole into his heart as
  the image of its mistress rose before him in all the pride of her stately
  beauty. He had often admired the regularity of her haughty features&mdash;
  had scanned, in his own critical way, with unqualified approval the lines of
  her noble figure, and the symmetry of her firm, well-turned limbs; had even
  longed to touch that wealth of silken hair when it shook loose in her
  exertions, and yet&mdash;a strange sensation for such a man&mdash;had
  flinched and felt oppressed when, placing her once in a position of defence,
  a tress of it had fallen across his hand. Now, it seemed to him that he would
  give much to live those few moments over again; that he would like to see her
  once more, if, indeed, as was probable, it would be for the last time; that
  there was no other woman to be compared with her in Rome; and that, with all
  her glowing beauty and all her physical attractions, her pride was her
  greatest charm.</p>

  <p>He was a desperate man, about to play a desperate game for life. Such
  thoughts in such a heart and at such a time quicken with fearful rapidity
  into evil. Admiration, untempered by the holier leavening of that affection
  which can only exist in the breast that has kept itself pure, soon grows to
  cruelty and selfishness. The love of beauty, poisoned by the love of strife,
  seethes into a fierce passionate longing, less that of the lover for his
  mistress than of the tiger for its prey. Valeria was a proud woman, the
  proudest and the fairest in Rome. He drew his breath hard as he thought what
  a wild triumph it would be to bend that stately neck, and humble that pride
  to his very feet. Methodical and soldierlike, he had seen to everything with
  his own eyes. The plot was laid, the conspirators were armed and instructed,
  there was yet an hour or two to spare before the appointed gathering at the
  tribune's house, and that time he resolved should be devoted to Valeria; at
  least, he would feast his eyes once more on that glorious beauty, of which he
  now seemed to acknowledge the full power. He would see her, would bid her
  farewell. She had always welcomed him cordially and kindly; perhaps she would
  be sorry to lose him altogether. He smiled a very evil smile, though his
  heart beat faster than it had done since he was a boy, as he halted under the
  statue of Hermes in her porch. And Valeria was sitting in her chamber, with
  her head buried in her hands, and her long brown hair sweeping like a mantle
  to her feet. All the feelings that could most goad and madden a woman were
  tearing at her heart. She dared not&mdash;for the sake of tottering reason
  she dared not&mdash;think of the tribune's white face and dropping jaw, and
  limbs strewed helpless on the couch. She suffered the vision, indeed, to
  weigh upon her like some oppressive nightmare; but she abstained, with an
  effort of which she was yet fully conscious, from analysing its meaning or
  recalling its details, above all, from considering its origin and its effect.
  No! the image of Esca still filled her brain and her heart. Esca in the
  amphitheatre; Esca chained and sleeping on the hard hot pavement; Esca
  walking by her side through the shady streets; and Esca turning away with his
  noble figure and his manly step, exulting in the liberty that set him free
  from <i>her</i>!</p>

  <p>Then came a rush of those softer feelings, that were required to render
  her torture unbearable: the sting of what might have been; the picture of
  herself (she could see herself in her mind's eye&mdash;beautiful and
  fascinating, in all the advantages of dress and jewels) leaning on that
  strong arm, and the kind brave face looking down into hers with the
  protective air that became it so well. To give him all; to tell him all she
  had risked, all she had done for his sake, and to hear his loving accents in
  reply! She almost fancied in her dream that this had actually come to pass,
  so vividly did her heart imagine to itself its dearest longings. Then she saw
  another figure in the place that ought to be her own another face into which
  he was looking as he had never looked in hers. It was the dark-eyed girl's!
  The dark-eyed girl, who had been her rival throughout! Would she have done as
  much for him with her pale face and her frightened, shrinking ways? And now,
  ere this, he had reached her home, was whispering in her ear, with his arm
  round her waist. Perhaps he was boasting of the conquest he had made over the
  haughty Roman lady, and telling her that he had scorned Valeria for her dear
  sake. Then all that was evil in her nature gained the ascendant, and with the
  bitter recklessness that has ruined so many an undisciplined heart, she said
  to herself&mdash;"There is no reality but evil. Life is an illusion, and hope
  a lie. It matters little what becomes of me now!"</p>

  <p>When Myrrhina entered she found her lady busied in rearranging the folds
  of her robe and her disordered tresses. It was no part of Valeria's character
  to show by her outward bearing what was passing in her mind, and least of all
  would she have permitted her attendant to guess at the humiliation she had
  undergone. The waiting-maid, indeed, was a little puzzled; but she had gained
  so much knowledge, both by observation and experience, of the strange effects
  produced by over-excitement on her sex, that she never suffered herself to be
  surprised at a feminine vagary of any description. Now, though she wondered
  why Esca was gone, and why her mistress was so reserved and haughty, she
  refrained discreetly from question or remark, contenting herself with a
  silent offer of her services, and arranging the brown hair into a plaited
  coronet on Valeria's brows, without betraying by her manner that she was
  conscious anything unusual had taken place.</p>

  <p>After a few moments' silence, her mistress's voice was sufficiently
  steadied for her to speak.</p>

  <p>"I did not send for you," said she. "What do you want here?"</p>

  <p>Myrrhina's hands were busied with the long silken tresses, and she held a
  comb between her teeth. Nevertheless, she answered volubly.</p>

  <p>"I would not have disturbed you, madam, this warm, sultry
  evening&mdash;and I rebuked the porter soundly for letting him in; only as he
  said, to be sure, he never was denied before, and I thought, perhaps, you
  would not be displeased to see him, if it was only for a few minutes, and he
  seemed so anxious and hurried&mdash;and, indeed, he never has much time to
  spare, so I bade him wait in the inner hall while I came to let you
  know."</p>

  <p>Hoping even against hope! She knew it was impossible, yet her heart leapt
  as she thought&mdash;"Oh! if it were only Esca who had turned back!"</p>

  <p>"I will see him," said she quietly, prolonging the illusion by purposely
  avoiding to ask who this untimely visitor might be.</p>

  <p>In another minute Hippias stood before her&mdash;Hippias, the fencing-
  master, a man in whose dangerous career she had always taken a vague
  interest; whose personal prowess she admired, and whose reputation, such as
  it was, possessed for her a wild fascination of its own. He was reckless,
  too, from the very nature of his profession; and she, in her present mood,
  more reckless, more desperate than any gladiator of them all. It would have
  done her good to stand, with naked steel, against some fierce wild beast or
  deadly foe. There was nothing, she felt, that she could not dare to-day.
  Nerve and brain wound up to the highest pitch of excitement&mdash;heart and
  feelings crushed, and wounded, and sore. When the reaction came, it would
  necessarily be fatal; when the tide ebbed, it would leave a wearied, helpless
  sufferer on the shore.</p>

  <p>Such was the frame of mind in which Valeria received the gladiator;
  outwardly impassive&mdash;for her colour did not even deepen, nor her breath
  come quicker at his unexpected appearance&mdash;inwardly vexed by a conflict
  of tumultuous feelings, and longing for any change&mdash;any anodyne that
  could deaden or alleviate her pain. How could she but respond to his manly,
  respectful farewell? How could she but listen to the few burning words in
  which he spoke of long-suppressed and hopeless adoration, or pretend not to
  be interested in the desperate enterprise which he hinted might prevent his
  ever looking on her fair face again. He soothed her self-love; he roused her
  curiosity; he set her pride on its broken pedestal again, and propped it with
  a strong, yet gentle hand; and so the two thunder-clouds drew nearer still
  and nearer, ere they met, to be destroyed and riven by the lightning their
  own contact had engendered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-08"
     id="ch2-08">VIII</a>. &mdash; TOO LATE!</h2>

  <p class="first">ESCA, treading on air, hastened from Valeria's house with
  the common selfishness of love, ignoring all the pain and disappointment he
  had left behind him. The young blood coursed merrily through his veins, and,
  in spite of his anxiety, he exulted in the sense of being at liberty once
  more. He was alive, doubtless, to the generosity and devotion of the woman
  who had set him free, nor was he so blind as to be unaware of the affection
  that had driven her to such desperate measures for his sake; and in the first
  glow of a gratitude, that had in it no vestige of tenderer feelings, he had
  resolved, when his mission was accomplished and Mariamne placed in safety, he
  would return and throw himself at the Roman lady's feet once more. But the
  farther he left her stately porch behind, the weaker became this generous
  resolution, and ere long he had little difficulty in persuading himself that
  his first duty was to the Jewess, and that in his future actions he must be
  guided by circumstances, or, in other words, follow the bent of his own
  inclinations. Meanwhile, in spite of his wounded foot, he sped on towards the
  Tiber as fast as, in years gone by, he had followed the lean wolf, or the
  foam-flecked boar, over the green hills of Britain. The sun had not been down
  an hour when he entered the well-known street that was now enchanted ground;
  yet, while he looked up into the darkening sky, his heart turned sick within
  him at the thought that he might be too late, after all. The garden-door was
  open, as she must have left it. She was not, therefore, in the house. He
  might find her at the riverside, and have the happiness of a few minutes
  alone with her, ere he brought her back and placed her, for the second time,
  in safety within her father's walls. The more prudent course, he confessed to
  himself at the time, would have been to alarm Eleazar, and put him on the
  defensive at once; but he had been so long without seeing Mariamne, the peril
  in which she was placed had so endeared her to him, and his own near approach
  to death had stamped her image so vividly on his heart, that he could not
  resist the temptation of seeking her at the water-side, and telling her,
  unwatched by other ears or eyes, all he had felt and 'endured since they last
  parted, and how, for both their sakes, they must never part again.</p>

  <p>Full of such thoughts, he ran down to the water's edge, and sought the
  broken column where she was accustomed to descend and fill her pitcher from
  the stream. In vain his eager eye watched for the dark-clad figure and the
  dear pale face. Once in the deepening twilight his heart leapt as he thought
  he saw her crouching low beneath the bank, and sank again to find he had been
  deceived by a fallen slab of stone. Then he turned for one more searching
  look ere he departed, and his glance rested on a pitcher, broken into a dozen
  fragments, at his feet. He did not know that it was Mariamne's. How should
  he, when a thousand pitchers carried by a thousand women to the Tiber every
  evening were precisely alike? Yet his blood ran cold through his veins and
  his fears hurried him back, almost insensibly, to Eleazar's door, which he
  burst open without going through the ceremony of knocking.</p>

  <p>Her father and his brother were in the house. The former leapt to his feet
  and snatched a javelin from the wall ere he recognised his visitor. The
  latter, less prone to do battle at a moment's notice, laid his hand on
  Eleazar's arm, and calmly said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is the friend who is always welcome, and whom we have expected day by
  day in vain."</p>

  <p>Everything looked so much as usual that for a moment Esca felt almost
  reassured. It was possible Mariamne might be even now busied with household
  affairs, safe in the inner chamber. A lover's bashfulness brought the blood
  to his cheeks, as he reflected if it were so it would be difficult to account
  for his unceremonious entrance; but the recollection of her danger soon
  stifled all such trivial considerations, and he confronted her father
  impetuously, and asked him, almost in a threatening tone&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Where is Mariamne?"</p>

  <p>Eleazar looked first simply astonished, then somewhat offended. He
  answered, however, with more command of temper than was his wont.</p>

  <p>"My daughter has but now left the house with her pitcher. She will be home
  again almost immediately; but what is this to thee?"</p>

  <p>"What is it to me?" repeated Esca in a voice of thunder, catching hold of
  his questioner's arm at the same time with an iron grasp for which the fierce
  old Jew liked him none the worse&mdash;"What is it to thee, to him, to all of
  us? I tell thee, old man, whilst we are drivelling here, they are bearing her
  off into captivity ten thousand times worse than death! I heard the
  plot&mdash;I heard it with my own ears, lying chained like a dog on the hard
  stones. The wicked tribune was to make her his own this very night, and
  though he has met his reward, the villains that do his bidding have got her
  in their power ere this. The pure&mdash;the loved&mdash;the beautiful&mdash;
  Mariamne&mdash;Mariamne!"</p>

  <p>He hid his face in his hands, and his strong frame shook with agony from
  head to heel.</p>

  <p>It was the turn of Calchas now to start to his feet, and look about him as
  if in search of a weapon. His first impulse was resistance to oppression,
  even by the strong hand. With Eleazar, on the contrary, the instincts of the
  soldier predominated, and the very magnitude of the emergency seemed to endow
  him with preternatural coolness and composure. He knit his thick brows
  indeed, and there was a smothered glare in his eye that boded no good to an
  enemy when the time for an outbreak should arrive, but his voice was low and
  distinct, as in a few sharp eager questions he gathered the outline of the
  plot that was to rob him of his daughter. Then he thought for a few seconds
  ere he spoke.</p>

  <p>"The men that were to take her? What were they like? I would fain know
  them if I came across them."</p>

  <p>His white teeth gleamed like a wild beast's with a smile ominous of his
  intentions on their behalf.</p>

  <p>"Damasippus and Oarses," replied the Briton. "The former stout, sleek,
  heavy, and beetle-browed. The latter pale, dark, and thin. An Egyptian with
  an Egyptian's false face, and more than an Egyptian's cruelty and
  cunning."</p>

  <p>"Where live they?" asked the Jew, buckling at the same time a formidable
  two-edged sword to his side.</p>

  <p>"In the Flaminian Way," replied the other. "High up in some garret where
  we should never find them. But they will not take her there. She is by this
  time at the other end of the city in the tribune's house." And again he
  groaned in anguish of spirit at the thought.</p>

  <p>"And that house?" asked Eleazar, still busied with his warlike
  preparations. "How is it defended? I know its outside well, and an easy
  entrance from the wall to the inner court; but what resistance shall we
  encounter within? what force can the tribune's people raise at a moment's
  outcry?"</p>

  <p>"Alas!" answered Esca. "To-night of all nights, the house of Placidus is
  garrisoned like a fortress. A chosen band of gladiators are to sup with the
  tribune, and afterwards to take possession of the palace and drag Caesar from
  the throne. When they find the banquet prepared for them, I know them too
  well to think they will separate without partaking of it, even though their
  host be lying dead on the festal couch. She will become the prey of men like
  Hippias, Lutorius, and Euchenor. But if we cannot rescue her, at least we may
  die in the attempt."</p>

  <p>Even in his anxiety for his daughter, such news as this could not but
  startle the emissary of the Jewish nation. In an instant's time he had run
  over its importance, as it regarded his own mission and the probable
  influence on the destinies of his country. Should the conspiracy succeed,
  Vitellius might already be numbered with the dead, and instead of that easy
  self-indulgent glutton, over whom he had already obtained considerable
  influence, he would have to do with the bold, sagacious, far-seeing general,
  the remorseless enemy of his nation, whom neither he nor any of his
  countrymen had ever succeeded in deceiving by stratagem or worsting by force
  of arms. When the purple descended on Vespasian the doom of Jerusalem was
  sealed. Nevertheless, Eleazar concentrated his mind on the present emergency.
  In a few words he laid out his plan for the rescue of his daughter.</p>

  <p>"The freedmen's garret must be our first point of attack," said he. "The
  tribune would scarce have ordered them to bring their prize to his house to-
  night, where there would be so many to dispute it with him, and where
  dissension would be fatal to his great enterprise. Calchas and I will proceed
  immediately to the dwelling of this Damasippus and his fellow-villain. Your
  directions will enable us to find it. You, Esca, speed off at once to the
  tribune's house. You will soon learn whether she has been brought there. If
  so, come to us without delay in the Flaminian Way. I am not entirely without
  friends even here, and I will call on two or three of my people to help as I
  go along. Young man, you are bold and true. We will have her out of the
  tribune's house if we pull the walls down with our naked hands; and let me
  but come within reach of the villains who take shelter there " here his face
  darkened and his frame quivered in a paroxysm of suppressed fury&mdash;"may
  my father's tomb be dishonoured, and the name of my mother defiled, if I dip
  not my hands to the very elbows in their hearts' blood!"</p>

  <p>To be told he was brave and true by her father added fuel to Esca's
  enthusiasm. It was indeed much for Eleazar to confess on behalf of a stranger
  and a heathen, but the fierce old warrior's heart warmed to a kindred nature
  that seemed incapable of selfish fear, and he approved hugely, moreover, of
  the implicit attention with which the Briton listened to his directions, and
  his readiness for instantaneous action, however desperate. Calchas, too,
  clasped the young man warmly by the hand.</p>

  <p>"We are but three," said he. "three against a host. Yet I have no fear. I
  trust in One who never failed His servants yet. One to whom emperors and
  legions are as a handful of dust before the wind, or a few dried thorns on
  the beacon-fire. And so do you, my son, so do you, though you know it not.
  But the time shall come when His very benefits shall compel you to confess
  your Master, and when in sheer gratitude you shall enrol yourself amongst
  those who serve Him faithfully even unto death."</p>

  <p>Many a time during that eventful and anxious night had Esca occasion to
  remember the old man's solemn words. Its horrors, its catastrophes, its
  alternations of hope and fear, might have driven one mad, who had nothing to
  depend upon but his own unaided strength and resolution. Few great actions
  have been performed, few tasks exacting the noble heroism of endurance
  fulfilled successfully, without extraneous aid, without the help of some
  leading principle out of, and superior to, the man. Honour, patriotism, love,
  loyalty, all have supported their votaries through superhuman exertions and
  difficulties that seemed insurmountable, teaching them to despise dangers and
  hardships with a courage sterner than mortals are expected to possess; but
  none of these can impart that confidence which is born of faith in the
  believer's breast;&mdash;that confidence which enables him to take good and
  evil with an equal mind, to look back on the past without a sigh, forward on
  the future without a fear; and though the present may be all a turmoil of
  peril, uncertainty, and confusion, to stand calmly in the midst, doing the
  best he can with a stout heart and an unruffled brow, while he leaves the
  result fearlessly and trustfully in the hand of God.</p>

  <p>Eleazar and Calchas were already equipped for the pursuit. The one armed
  to the teeth, and looking indeed a formidable enemy; the other mild and
  hopeful as usual, venerable with his white hair and beard, and carrying but a
  simple staff for his weapon. In grave silence, but with a grasp of the hand
  more emphatic than any spoken words, the three parted on their search; Esca
  threading his way at once through the narrow and devious streets that led
  towards the tribune's house&mdash;that house which he had left so gladly but
  a few short hours ago when, rescued by Valeria, he bade her farewell,
  exulting in the liberty that enabled him to seek Mariamne's side once more.
  He soon reached the hated dwelling. All there seemed quiet as the grave. From
  other quarters of the city indeed there came, now and again, the roar of
  distant voices which rose and fell at intervals as the tide of tumult ebbed
  and flowed, but, preoccupied as he was, Esca took little heed of these
  ominous sounds, for they bore him no intelligence of Mariamne. All was silent
  in the porch, all was silent in the vestibule and outer hall, but as he
  ventured across its marble pavement, he heard the bustle of preparation, and
  the din of flagons within.</p>

  <p>It was at the risk of liberty and life, that he crept noiselessly forward,
  and peeped into the banqueting-hall, which was already partially lighted up
  for the feast. Shrinking behind a column, he observed the slaves, many of
  whom he knew well by sight, laying covers, burnishing vases, and otherwise
  making ready for a sumptuous entertainment. He listened for a few moments,
  hoping to gather from their conversation some news of the Jewess and her
  captors. All at once he started and trembled violently. Bold as he was, in
  common with his northern countrymen a vein of superstition ran through his
  nature, and though he feared nothing tangible or corporeal, he held in
  considerable dread all that touched upon the confines of the spiritual and
  the unknown. There within ten paces of him, ghastly pale, with dark circles
  round his eyes, and clad in white, stood the figure of the tribune, pointing,
  as it seemed to him, with shadowy hand at the different couches, and giving
  directions in a low sepulchral voice for the order of the banquet.</p>

  <p>"Not yet!" he heard the apparition exclaim in tones of languid, fretful
  impatience. "Not come yet! the idle loiterers! Well, she must preside there
  at the supper-table and take her place at once as mistress here. Ho! slaves!
  bring more flowers! Fill the tall golden cup with Falernian and set it next
  to mine!"</p>

  <p>Well did Esca know to whom these directions must refer. Though his blood
  had been chilled for an instant by this reappearance, as he believed it, of
  his enemy from the grave, he soon collected his scattered energies and
  summoned his courage back, with the hateful conviction that, alive or dead,
  the tribune was resolved to possess himself of Mariamne. And this he vowed to
  prevent, ay, though he should slay his dark-eyed love with his own hand.</p>

  <p>It was obvious now that Damasippus and Oarses would bring the captive
  straight to their patron's house, that Eleazar and Calchas had gone upon a
  fool's errand to the freedmen's garret in the Flaminian Way. What would he
  have given to be cheered by the wise counsels of the one, and backed by the
  strong arm of the other! Would there be time for him to slip from here
  unobserved, and to summon them to his aid? Three desperate men might cut
  their way through all the slaves that Placidus could muster, and if they had
  any chance of success at all it must be before the arrival of the gladiators.
  But then she was obviously expected every minute. She might
  arrive&mdash;horrible thought!&mdash;while he was gone for help, and once in
  the tribune's power it would be too late. In his despair the words of Calchas
  recurred forcibly to his mind. "We are but three," said the old man, "three
  against a host, yet I have no fear." And Esca resolved that though he was but
  one, he too would have no fear, but would trust implicitly in the award of
  eternal justice, which would surely interfere to prevent this unholy
  sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Feeling that his sword was loose in its sheath and ready to his hand,
  holding his breath, and nerving himself for the desperate effort he might be
  called upon at any moment to make, the Briton stole softly back through the
  vestibule, and concealed himself behind a marble group in the darkest corner
  of the porch. Here, with the dogged courage of his race, he made up his mind
  that he would await the arrival of Mariamne, and rescue her at all hazards,
  against any odds, or die with her in the attempt.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-09"
     id="ch2-09">IX</a>. &mdash; THE LURE</h2>

  <p class="first">LIKE other great cities, the poorer quarters of Rome were
  densely crowded. The patricians, and indeed all the wealthier class, affected
  rural tastes even in the midst of the capital, and much space was devoted to
  the gardens and pleasure-grounds which surrounded their dwellings. The
  humbler inhabitants were consequently driven to herd together in great
  numbers, with little regard to health or convenience, and the streets leading
  to and adjoining the Tiber were perhaps the most thickly populated of all.
  That in which Eleazar's house stood, was seldom empty of passengers at any
  hour of the twenty-four, and least of all about sunset when the women
  thronged out of their dwellings to draw water for the household consumption
  of the following day. Oarses was well aware of this, and therefore it was
  that the cunning Egyptian had protested against an abduction of the Jewish
  maiden by open force from her father's door.</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me," said this finished villain, in discussing their infamous
  project with his patron. "I know a lure to wile such birds as these off the
  bough into my open hand. Stratagem first, force afterwards. There is no need
  to waken the tongues of all the women in the quarter. It was the cackling of
  a goose, my patron, that foiled the attack on the Capitol."</p>

  <p>Mariamne, anxious and sad, was carrying her pitcher listlessly down to the
  Tiber and letting her thoughts wander far from her occupation, into a few
  sweet memories, and a thousand dreary apprehensions, when she was accosted by
  a dark sallow old woman, whose speech and manners, as well as her dress,
  betrayed an Eastern origin. The stranger asked some trifling questions about
  her way, and prayed for a draught of cold water when the pitcher should be
  filled. Mariamne, whose heart unconsciously warmed to the homely Syriac,
  entered freely into conversation with one of her own sex, and whose language
  denoted, moreover, that she was familiar with her nation. Willingly she drew
  her a measure from the stream, which the other quaffed with the moderation of
  one whose thirst is habitually quenched with wine rather than water.</p>

    <p class="caption">She was accosted by a dark sallow old woman.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"It is somewhat muddy, I fear," said the girl kindly, reverting in her own
  mind to the sparkling fountains of her native land, and yet acknowledging how
  she loved this turbid stream better than them all. "If you will come back
  with me to my father's house I can offer you a draught of wine and a morsel
  of bread to cheer you on your way."</p>

  <p>The other, though with no great avidity, took a second pull at the
  pitcher.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said she. "my daughter, I will not tax your hospitality so far. Nor
  have I need. There is lore enough left under these faded locks of mine, to
  turn the foulest cesspool in Rome as clear as crystal. Ay, to change this
  tasteless draught to wine of Lebanon, and the pitcher that contains it to a
  vase of gold."</p>

  <p>Mariamne shrank from her with a gesture of dismay. Believing implicitly in
  their power, her religion forbade her to hold any intercourse with those who
  professed the black art. The other marked her repugnance.</p>

  <p>"My child," she continued, in soothing tones. "be not afraid of the old
  woman's secret gifts. Mine is but a harmless knowledge, gained by study of
  the ancient Chaldaean scrolls, such as your own wise king possessed of old.
  It is but white magic, such as your high-priest himself would not scruple to
  employ. Fear not, I say&mdash;I, who have pored over those mystic characters
  till mine eyes grew dim, can read your sweet pale face as plain as the brazen
  tablets in the Forum, and I can see in it sorrow, and care, and anxiety for
  him you love."</p>

  <p>Mariamne started. It was true enough, but how could the wise woman have
  found it out? The girl looked wistfully at her companion, and the latter,
  satisfied she was on the right track, proceeded to answer that questioning
  glance.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "you think he is in danger or in grief. You wonder why
  you do not see him oftener. Sometimes you fear he may be false. What would
  you not give, my poor child, to look on the golden locks, and the white brow,
  now, at this very moment? And I can show them to you if you will. The old
  woman is not ungrateful even for a draught of the Tiber's muddy stream."</p>

  <p>The blood mounted to Mariamne's brow, but the light kindled at the same
  time in her eyes, and the soft gleam swept over her face that comes into
  every human countenance when the heart vibrates with an allusion to its
  treasure as though the silver cord thrilled to the touch of an angel's wing.
  It was no clumsy guess of the wise woman, to infer that this dark-eyed damsel
  cherished some fair-haired lover.</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" asked the girl eagerly. "How can you show him to me? What
  do you know of him? Is he safe? Is he happy?"</p>

  <p>The wise woman smiled. Here was a bird flying blindfold into the net. Take
  her by her affections, and there would be little difficulty in the
  capture.</p>

  <p>"He is in danger," she replied. "But you could save him if you only knew
  how. He might be happy too, if he would. But with another!"</p>

  <p>To do Mariamne justice she heard only the first sentence.</p>

  <p>"In danger!" she repeated. "and I could save him! Oh, tell me where he is,
  and what I can do for his sake!"</p>

  <p>The wise woman pulled a small mirror from her bosom.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you," she answered. "but I can show him to you in this.
  Only not here, where the shadow of a passer-by might destroy the charm. Let
  us turn aside to that vacant space by the broken column, and you shall look
  without interruption on the face you love."</p>

  <p>It was but a short way off, though the ruins which surrounded it made the
  place lonely and secluded; had it been twice the distance, however, Mariamne
  would have accompanied her new acquaintance without hesitation in her
  eagerness for tidings of Esca's fate. As she neared the broken column, so
  endeared to her by associations, she could not repress a faint sigh, which
  was not lost on her companion.</p>

  <p>"It was here you met him before," whispered the wise woman. "It is here
  you shall see his face again."</p>

  <p>This was scarcely a random shaft, for it required little penetration to
  discover that Mariamne had some tender associations connected with a spot
  thus adapted for the meeting of a pair of lovers; nevertheless the apparent
  familiarity with her previous actions was sufficient to convince the Jewess
  of her companion's supernatural knowledge, and though it roused alarm, it
  excited curiosity in a still greater degree.</p>

  <p>"Take the mirror in your hand," whispered the wise woman, when they had
  reached the column, casting, at the same time, a searching glance around.
  "Shut your eyes whilst I speak the charm that calls him, three times over,
  and then look steadily on its surface till I have counted a hundred."</p>

  <p>Mariamne obeyed these directions implicitly. Standing in the vacant space
  with the mirror in her hand, she shut her eyes and listened intently to the
  solemn tones of the wise woman chanting in a low monotonous voice some
  unintelligible stanzas, while from the deep shadow behind the broken column,
  there stole out the portly figure of Damasippus, and, at the same moment,
  half a dozen strong well-armed slaves rose from the different hiding-places
  in which they lay concealed amongst the ruins. Ere the incantation had been
  twice repeated, Damasippus threw a shawl over the girl's head, muffling her
  so completely, while he caught her in his strong arms, that an outcry was
  impossible. The others snatched her up ere she could make a movement, and
  bore her swiftly off to a chariot with four white horses waiting in the next
  street, whilst the wise woman, following at a rapid pace, and disencumbering
  herself of her female attire as she sped along, disclosed the cunning
  features and the thin wiry form of Oarses the Egyptian. Coming up with
  Damasippus, who was panting behind the slaves and their burden, he laughed a
  low noiseless laugh.</p>

  <p>"My plan was the best," said he. "after all. What fools these women are, O
  my friend! Is there any other creature that can be taken with a bait so
  simple? Three inches of mirror and the ghost of an absent face!"</p>

  <p>But Damasippus had not breath to reply. Hurrying onward, he was chiefly
  anxious to dispose of his prize in the chariot without interruption; and when
  he reached it he mounted by her side, and bidding Oarses and the slaves
  follow as near as was practicable, he drove off at great speed in the
  direction of the tribune's house.</p>

  <p>But this was an eventful night in Rome, and although for that reason well
  adapted to a deed of violence, its tumult and confusion exacted great caution
  from those who wished to proceed without interruption along the streets. The
  shouts that had disturbed the two freedmen in their garret whilst preparing
  the enterprise they had since so successfully carried out, gave no false
  warning of the coming storm. That storm had burst, and was now raging in its
  fury throughout a wide portion of the city. Like all such outbreaks it
  gathered force and violence in many quarters at once, and from many sources
  unconnected with its original cause.</p>

  <p>Rome was the theatre that night of a furious civil war, consequent on the
  intrigues of various parties which had now grown to a head. The old
  Praetorian guard had been broken up by Vitellius, and dismissed without any
  of the honours and gratuities to which they considered themselves entitled,
  in order to make way for another body of troops on whose fidelity the Emperor
  believed he could rely, and who were now called, in contradistinction to
  their predecessors, the New Praetorians. Two such conflicting interests
  carried in them the elements of the direst hatred and strife. The original
  body-guard hoping to be restored by Vespasian, should he attain the purple,
  had everything to gain by a change of dynasty, and were easily won over by
  the partisans of that successful general to any enterprise, however
  desperate, which would place him on the throne. Trusting to this powerful
  aid, these partisans, of whom Julius Placidus, the tribune, though he had
  wormed himself into the confidence of Vitellius, was one of the most active
  and unscrupulous, were ready enough to raise the standard of revolt and had
  no fear for the result. The train was laid, and to-night it had been decided
  that the match should be applied. In regular order of battle, in three ranks
  with spears advanced and eagles in the centre, the Old Praetorians marched at
  sundown to attack the camp of their successors. It was a bloody and obstinate
  contest. The new body-guard, proud of their promotion, and loyal to the hand
  that had bought them, defended themselves to the death. Again and again was
  the camp almost carried. Again and again were the assailants obstinately
  repulsed. It was only when slain, man by man, falling in their ranks as they
  stood, with all their wounds <i>in front</i>, that a victory was
  obtained&mdash;victory which so crippled the conquerors as to render them but
  inefficient auxiliaries in the other conflicts of that eventful night. But
  this was only one of the many pitched battles, so to speak, of which Rome was
  the unhappy theatre. The Capitol after an obstinate defence had been taken by
  the partisans of the present Emperor and burned to the ground.</p>

  <p>This stronghold having been previously seized and occupied by Sabinus, who
  declared himself Governor of Rome in the name of Vespasian, and who even
  received in state several of the principal nobility and a deputation from the
  harassed and vacillating senate, had been alternately the object of attack
  and defence to either party. Its possession seemed to confer a spurious
  sovereignty over the whole city, and it was held as obstinately as it was
  vigorously and desperately attacked.</p>

  <p>An hour or two before sunset, an undisciplined body of soldiers, armed
  only with their swords, and formidable chiefly from the wild fury with which
  they seemed inspired, marched through the Forum and ascended the Capitoline
  Hill. The assailants having no engines of war either for protection or
  offence, suffered severely from the missiles showered upon them by the
  besieged, till the thought struck them of throwing flaming torches into the
  place from the roofs of the houses which surrounded it, and which, erected in
  time of peace, had been suffered to overtop the Roman citadel. In vain, after
  the flames had consumed the gate, did they endeavour to force an entrance;
  for Sabinus, with the unscrupulous resource of a Roman soldier, had blocked
  the way by a hundred prostrate statues of gods and men, pulled down from the
  sacred pedestals on which they had stood for ages; but the contiguous houses
  catching fire, and all the woodwork of the Capitol being old and dry, the
  flames soon spread, and in a few hours the stronghold of Roman pride and
  Roman history was levelled with the ground. Callous to the memories around
  him, forgetful of the Tarquins, and the Scipios, and the many hallowed names
  that shed their lustre on this monument of his country's greatness, Sabinus
  lost his presence of mind in proportion as the necessity for preserving it
  became more urgent. He was no longer able to control his troops, and the
  latter, panic-stricken with the entrance of their enemies, disbanded, and
  betook themselves to flight. The majority, including one woman of noble
  birth, were put ruthlessly to the sword, but a few, resembling their
  assailants, as they did, in arms, appearance, and language, were fortunate
  enough to catch the password by which they recognised each other, and so
  escaped.</p>

  <p>In another quarter of the mighty city, a large body of troops who had
  hoisted the standard of Vespasian, and had already suffered one repulse which
  rather excited their animosity than quelled their ardour, were advancing in
  good order, and, according to sound warlike tactics, in three divisions. The
  gardens of Sallust, laid out by that elegant and intellectual sensualist,
  with a view to pursuits far removed from strife and bloodshed, were the scene
  of an obstinate combat, in which, however, one of these columns succeeded in
  establishing itself within the walls; and now the struggle that had
  heretofore been carried on in its outskirts, penetrated to the heart of the
  Roman capital. The citizens beheld war brought into their very homes and
  hearths&mdash;the familiar street slippery with blood&mdash;the wounded
  soldier reeling on the doorsill, where the children were wont to play the
  dead man's limbs strewed helpless by the fountain, where the girls assembled
  with shrill laughing voices on the calm summer evenings,&mdash;and worse than
  all, instead of the kindly grasp of friends and fellow-countrymen, the
  brother's hand clutching at the brother's throat.</p>

  <p>Such horrors, however, did but more demoralise a population already
  steeped to the very lips in cruelty, vice, and foul iniquity. Trained to
  bloodshed by the ghastly entertainments of the amphitheatre, the Roman
  citizen gloated on no spectacle with so keen a pleasure as on the throes of a
  fellow-creature in the agony of violent death. The populace deemed now to
  consider the contest waged at their doors as a goodly show got up for their
  especial amusement. Loud shouts encouraged the combatants as either party
  swayed and wavered in the mortal press, and <i>Euge!&mdash;Bene!</i> were
  cried as loudly for their encouragement, as if they had been paid gladiators,
  earning their awful livelihood on the sand. Nay, worse, when some wounded
  soldier dragged himself into a house for safety, instead of succour, he was
  received with yells of reprobation, and thrust out into the street that he
  might be despatched by his conquerors according to the merciless regulations
  of the amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>Nor was man the only demon on the scene. Unsexed women with bare bosoms,
  wild eyes, streaming hair, and white feet stained with blood, flew to and fro
  amongst the soldiers, stimulating them to fresh atrocities with wine and
  caresses and odious ribald mirth. It was a festival of Death and Sin. She had
  wreathed her fair arms around the spectral king, and crowned his fleshless
  brows with her gaudy garlands, and wrapped him in her mantle of flame, and
  pressed the blood-red goblet to his lips, maddening him with her shrieks of
  wild, mocking laughter, the while their mutual feet trampled out the lives
  and souls of their victims on the stones of Rome. Through a town in such a
  state of turmoil and confusion, Damasippus took upon himself to conduct in
  safety the prize he had succeeded in capturing, not, it must be confessed,
  without many hearty regrets that he had ever embarked in the undertaking.
  Devoutly did he now wish that he could shift the whole business on to the
  shoulders of Oarses; but of late he had been concerned to observe in the
  patron's manner a certain sense of his own inutility as compared with the
  astute Egyptian; and if the latter were now permitted to conclude, as he had
  undoubtedly inaugurated, the adventure, Placidus might be satisfied that
  there was little use in entertaining two rogues to do the work of one. He
  knew his patron well enough to be aware of the effect such a conviction would
  have on his own prospects. The tribune would no more scruple to bid him go
  starve or hang, than he would to pull out a superfluous hair from his beard.
  Therefore, at all risks, thought Damasippus, he must be the man to bring
  Mariamne into his lord's house. It was a difficult and a dangerous task.
  There was only room for himself and one stout slave besides the charioteer
  and the prisoner. The latter had struggled violently, and required to be held
  down by main force, nor in muffling her screams was it easy to observe the
  happy medium between silence and suffocation. Also, it was indispensable, in
  the present lawless state of affairs, to avoid observation; and the spectacle
  of a handsomely gilded chariot with a female figure in it, held down and
  closely veiled, the whole drawn by four beautiful white horses, was not
  calculated to traverse the streets of a crowded city without remark. Oarses,
  indeed, had suggested a litter, but this had been overruled by his comrade on
  the score of speed, and now the state of the streets made speed impossible.
  To be sure this enabled the escort to keep up with him, and Damasippus, who
  was no fighter at heart, derived some comfort from their presence. The
  darkness, however, which should have favoured him, was dispelled by the
  numerous conflagrations in various parts of the city; and when the chariot
  was stopped and forced to turn into a by-street to avoid a crowd rushing
  towards the blazing Capitol, Damasippus felt his heart sink within him in an
  access of terror, such as even he had never felt before.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-10"
     id="ch2-10">X</a>. &mdash; FROM SCYLLA TO CHARYBDIS</h2>

  <p class="first">UP one street, down another, avoiding the main
  thoroughfares, now rendered impassable by the tumult, his anxious freedmen
  threaded their way with difficulty in the direction of the tribune's house.
  Mariamne seemed either to have fainted, or to have resigned herself to her
  fate, for she had ceased to struggle, and cowered down on the floor of the
  chariot, silent and motionless. Damasippus trusted his difficulties were
  nearly over, and resolved never again to be concerned in such an enterprise.
  Already he imagined himself safe in his patron's porch, claiming the reward
  of his dexterity, when he was once more arrested by a stoppage which promised
  a hazardous and protracted delay.</p>

  <p>Winding its slow length along, in all the pomp and dignity affected by the
  maiden order, a procession of Vestals crossed in front of the white horses,
  and not a man in Rome but would have trembled with superstitious awe at the
  bare notion of breaking in on the solemn march of these sacred virgins,
  dedicated to the service of a goddess, whose peculiar attributes were
  mystery, antiquity, and remorseless vengeance for offence. Dressed in their
  long white garments, simple and severe, with no relief save a narrow purple
  border round the veil, they swept on in slow majestic column, like a vision
  from the other world, led by a stately priestess, pale and calm, of lofty
  stature and majestic bearing. They believed that to them was confided the
  welfare of the State, the safety of the city; nay, that with the mysterious
  symbols in their temple, they guarded the very existence of the nation;
  therefore on all public occasions of strife or disorder, the Vestal Virgins
  were accustomed to show themselves confidently in the streets, and use their
  influence for the restoration of peace. Nor had they need to fear either
  injury or insult. To touch the person of a Vestal, even to obstruct the
  litter in which she was carried, was punishable with death, and public
  opinion in such a case was even more exacting than the law.</p>

  <p>Immunities and privileges of many kinds were granted to the order by
  different enactments. When the Vestal went abroad, she was preceded and
  followed by the lictors of the State; and if she met a criminal under
  sentence of death, honestly by accident, during her progress, he was pardoned
  and set free for her sake, on the spot.</p>

  <p>It may be that Mariamne had some vague recollection of this custom, for no
  sooner were the horses stopped to let the procession pass, than she uttered a
  loud shriek, which brought it to a halt at once, and caused her own guards to
  gather round the chariot and prepare for resistance, Oarses wisely keeping
  aloof, and Damasippus, while he strove to wear a bold front, quaking in every
  limb. At a signal from the superior priestess, the long white line stood
  still, while her lictors seized the horses, and surrounded the chariot
  Already a crowd of curious bystanders was gathering, and the glare of the
  burning Capitol shed its light even here, on their dark, eager faces,
  contrasting strangely with the veiled figures that occupied the middle of the
  street, cold and motionless as marble.</p>

  <p>Two lictors seized on Damasippus, each by a shoulder, and brought him
  unceremoniously to within a few paces of the priestess. Here he dropped upon
  his knees, and began wringing his hands in ludicrous dismay, whilst the
  populace, gathering round, laughed and jeered at him, only refraining from
  violence on account of the Vestal's presence.</p>

  <p>"She is a slave, our slave, bought with our own money in the market,
  sacred virgin. I can swear it. I can prove it. Here is the man who paid for
  her. O accursed Oarses, hast thou left me in the lurch at last?"</p>

  <p>The wily Egyptian now came up, composed and sedate, with the air of a man
  confident in the justice of his cause. Mariamne; meanwhile, could but strive
  to release herself in vain. So effectually had she been bound and muffled,
  that she could scarcely move, and was unable to articulate. She struggled on,
  nevertheless, in the wild hope of succour, writhing her whole body to set her
  lips free from the bandages that stifled them. With the quiet dignity which
  was an especial attribute of her office, the priestess pointed to the chariot
  containing the prisoner, and from beneath her veil, in clear, low tones,
  while the bystanders listened with respectful awe, came the
  question&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What crime has she committed?"</p>

  <p>"No crime, sacred virgin, no crime whatsoever," replied the wily Oarses,
  well knowing that the privilege of pardon, which the Vestals loved to
  exercise, was less likely to be exerted for a refractory bondswoman than a
  condemned criminal. "She is but a runaway slave, a mere dancing-girl. How
  shall I tell it in your august presence? I bought her scarce a week ago, as
  my friend here knows, and can swear. Canst thou not, Damasippus, worthy
  citizen? I gave but two thousand sesterces, nevertheless it was a large sum
  for me, who am a poor man; and I borrowed the half of it from my friend here.
  I bought her in the open market, and I took her home with me to my wife and
  children, that she might beat flax and card wool, and so gain an honest
  livelihood&mdash; an honest livelihood, sacred virgin; and that is why she
  ran away from me; so I informed the aedile, and I sought her diligently, and
  to-day I found her with her cheeks painted, and her bosom gilt, in her old
  haunts, drunk with wine. Then I bound her, and placed her in a litter, and
  the litter breaking down, for I am poor, sacred virgin, and of humble birth,
  though a Roman citizen&mdash;the litter, I say, breaking down, and my
  patron's chariot passing by, I placed her within it, that I might take her
  home, for she is insensible still. All this I swear, and here is my friend
  who will swear it too. Damasippus, wilt thou not?"</p>

  <p>The latter worthy had indeed been accompanying every syllable of his
  confederate's statement with those eager Italian gestures which signify so
  much of argument and expostulation. These were not without effect on the by-
  standers, predisposed as such generally are to believe the worst, and prone
  to be influenced by the last speaker, especially when supported by testimony,
  however unworthy of reliance. They crowded in as near as their awe of the
  priestess would allow, and angry looks were shot at the poor, dark figure
  lying helpless in the chariot.</p>

  <p>Under the Vestal's long white veil, there might have been a gleam of pity
  or a flash of scorn on the unseen face, according as she felt a kindly
  sympathy or womanly indignation for the sins of an erring sister. But
  whatever was her private opinion, with a priestess of her order, such an
  appeal as that of Oarses could have but one result. The pale slender hand
  made a gesture of contempt and impatience. The tall ghostly figure moved on
  with a prouder, sterner step, and the procession swept by, carrying away with
  it the last fragile hope of succour that had comforted Mariamne's heart. Like
  a poor hunted hind caught in a net, when the sharp muzzle of the deerhound
  touches her flank, the Jewess made one convulsive effort that loosened the
  shawl about her mouth. In her agony, the beloved name flew instinctively to
  her lips, and hopelessly, unconsciously, she called out. "Esca! Esca!" in
  loud piercing tones of terror and despair.</p>

  <p>The Vestals had indeed passed by, and the chariot was again set in motion,
  but the Briton's name seemed to act as a talisman on the crowd, for no sooner
  had she pronounced it, than the bystanders were seen to give way on each side
  to the pressure of a huge pair of shoulders, surmounted by the fearless,
  honest face of Hirpinus the gladiator. That professional, in common with a
  few chosen comrades, had found the last few hours hang exceedingly heavy on
  his hands. Bound by oath to keep sober, and, what was perhaps even a more
  galling restriction, to abstain from fighting, this little party had seen
  themselves deprived at once of their two principal resources, the favourite
  occupations which gave a zest to their existence. But the saying that there
  is "Honour among thieves" dates farther back than the institution of an
  amphitheatre; and as soon as the gladiator had made his bargain, he
  considered himself, body and soul, the property of his purchaser. So, when
  Hippias gave his final orders, insisting on the appearance of his myrmidons
  at a given place and a given time, fresh, sober, and without a scratch, he
  had no fear but that they would be punctually and honestly obeyed.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Hirpinus, Rufus, Lutorius, and a few of the surest blades in
  the Family, had been whiling away their leisure with a stroll through the
  principal streets of Rome, and had met with not a few incidents peculiarly
  pleasing to men of their profession. They had been good enough to express
  their approval of the soldierlike manner in which the gardens of Sallust were
  attacked and carried; they had also marked, with a certain grim satisfaction,
  the assault on the Capitol, though they complained that when it was fired the
  thick volumes of smoke that swept downwards from its walls obstructed their
  view of the fighting, which was to them the chief attraction of the
  entertainment, and which they criticised with many instructive and
  professional remarks; it was difficult, doubtless, to abstain from taking
  part in any of these skirmishes, more particularly as each man was armed with
  the short, two-edged Roman sword; but, as they reminded one another, it was
  only a temporary abstinence, and for a very short period, since, from all
  they could gather, before midnight they might be up to their necks in wine,
  and over their ankles in blood.</p>

  <p>Now, supper-time was approaching, and the athletes were getting fierce,
  hungry, and weary of inaction. They had stood still to watch the procession
  of Vestals pass by, and even these wild, unscrupulous men had refrained from
  word or gesture that could be construed into disrespect for the maiden order;
  but they had shown little interest in the cause of stoppage, and scarce
  condescended to notice a discussion that arose from so mean a subject as a
  runaway slave. Suddenly, however, to the amazement of his comrades and the
  discomfiture of the bystanders, Hirpinus burst hastily through the crowd,
  unceremoniously thrusting aside those who stood in his way, and lifting one
  inquisitive little barber clean off his legs, to hurl him like a plaything
  into a knot of chattering citizens, much to their indignation and the poor
  man's own physical detriment. Hands were clenched, indeed, and brows bent, as
  the strong square form forged through the press, like some bluff galley
  through the surf, but Cave! cave! was whispered by the more cautious, and in
  such dread was a gladiator held by his peaceful fellow-citizens, that the
  boldest preferred submission under insult to a quarrel with a man whose very
  trade was strife. The chariot was already in motion, when a strong hand
  forced the two centre horses back upon their haunches, and the bold, frank
  voice of Hirpinus was heard above the trampling hoofs and general
  confusion.</p>

  <p>"Easy, my little fellow, for a moment," said he to the indignant
  Automedon. "I heard a comrade's name spoken just now, from within that gilded
  shell of thine. Halt! I tell thee, lad, and keep that whip quiet, lest I
  brain thee with my open hand!"</p>

  <p>Automedon, little relishing the business from the beginning, pulled his
  horses together, and looked very much disposed to cry. Damasippus, however,
  confident in the support of his companion, and the presence of half a dozen
  armed slaves, stepped boldly forward, and bade the gladiator " make way there
  " in a high, authoritative voice. Hirpinus recognised the freedman at once,
  and laughed loud and long.</p>

  <p>"What now?" said he. "my old convive and boon-companion. By Pollux! I knew
  thee not in thy warlike array of steel. In faith, a garland of roses becomes
  that red nose of thine better than the bosses of a helmet, and the stem of a
  goblet would fit thy hand more deftly than the haft of that gaudy sword. What
  stolen goods are these, old parasite? I'll wager now that the jackal is but
  taking home a lump of carrion to the lion's den."</p>

  <p>"Stay me not, good friend," replied the other, with importance. "It is
  even as you say, and I am about the business of your employer and mine,
  Julius Placidus the tribune."</p>

  <p>Hirpinus, in high good-humour, would have bade him pass on, but Mariamne,
  whose mouth was now released, gathered her exhausted energies for a last
  appeal.</p>

  <p>"You are his comrade! you said so even now. Save me, save me, for Esca's
  sake!"</p>

  <p>Again at that name the gladiator's eye glistened. He loved the young
  Briton like a son&mdash;he who had so little to love in the world. He had
  brought him out, as he boasted twenty times a day. He had made a
  man&mdash;more, a swordsman&mdash;of him. Now he had lost sight of him, and,
  as far as his nature permitted, had been anxious and unhappy ever since. If a
  dog had belonged to Esca, he would have dashed in to rescue it from danger at
  any risk.</p>

  <p>"Stand back, fool!" he shouted to Damasippus, as the latter interposed his
  person between the gladiator and the chariot. "Have a care, I tell thee! I
  want the woman out into the street. What! you will, will you?
  &mdash;One&mdash;two. Take it then, idiot! Here! comrades, close in, and keep
  off this accursed crowd!"</p>

  <p>Damasippus, confident in the numbers of his escort, and believing, too,
  that his adversary was alone, had, indeed, drawn his sword, and called up the
  slaves to his assistance, when the gladiator moved towards the chariot
  containing his charge. To dash the blade from his unaccustomed grasp, to deal
  him a straight, swift, crushing blow, that sent him down senseless on the
  pavement, and then, drawing his own weapon, to turn upon the shrinking escort
  a point that seemed to threaten all at once, was for Hirpinus a mere matter
  of professional business, -so simple as to be almost a relaxation. His
  comrades, laughing boisterously, made a ring round the combatants. The slaves
  hesitated, gave ground, turned and fled; Hirpinus dragged the helpless form
  of Mariamne from the chariot, and Oarses, who had remained in the background
  till now, leaped nimbly in, to assume the vacant place, and, whispering
  Automedon, went off at a gallop.</p>

  <p>The poor girl, terrified by the danger she had escaped, and scarcely
  reassured by the mode of her rescue, or the appearance of her deliverers,
  clung, half-fainting, to the person of her supporter, and the old swordsman,
  with a delicacy almost ludicrous in one of his rough exterior, soothed her
  with such terms of encouragement as he could summon at the moment: now like a
  nurse hushing a child off to sleep, anon like a charioteer quieting a
  frightened or fretful horse.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the crowd, gathering confidence from the sheathed swords
  and obvious good-humour of the gladiators, pressed round with many rude
  gestures and insulting remarks, regardless of the fallen man, who, on
  recovering his senses, wisely remained for a while where he was, and chiefly
  bent on examining the features of the cloaked and hooded prize, that had
  created this pretty little skirmish for their diversion. Such unmannerly
  curiosity soon aroused the indignation of Hirpinus.</p>

  <p>"Keep them off, comrades!" said he angrily; "these miserable citizens.
  Keep them off, I say! Have they never seen a veiled woman before, that they
  gape and stare, and pass their rancid jests, as they do on you and me when we
  are down on our backs for their amusement in the arena? Let her have air, my
  lads, and she will soon come to. Pollux! She looks like the lily thy wife was
  watering at home, when we stopped there this morning, Rufus, for a draught of
  the five-year-old wine, and a gambol with those bright-haired kids of
  thine."</p>

  <p>The tall champion to whom this remark was addressed, and who had that very
  morning, in company with his friend, bidden a farewell, that might be
  eternal, to wife and children, as indeed it was nothing unusual for him to
  do, softened doubtless by the remembrance, now exerted himself strenuously to
  give the fainting woman room. Without the use of any but nature's weapons,
  and from sheer weight, strength, and resolution, the gladiators soon cleared
  an ample space in the middle of the street for their comrade and his charge;
  nor did they seem at all indisposed to a task which afforded opportunities of
  evincing their own physical superiority, and the supreme contempt in which
  they held the mass of their fellow-citizens. Perhaps it was pleasant to feel
  how completely they could domineer over the crowd by the use of those very
  qualities which made their dying struggles a spectacle for the vulgar;
  perhaps they enjoyed the repayment in advance of some of the ribaldry and
  insult that would too surely accompany their end. At any rate they shouldered
  the mob back with unnecessary violence, drove their spiked sandals into the
  feet of such as came under their tread, and scrupled not to strike with open
  hand or clenched fist any adventurous citizen who was fool enough to put
  himself forward for appeal or resistance. These, too, seemed terror-stricken
  by this handful of resolute men. Accustomed to look on them from a safe
  distance in the amphitheatre, like the wild beasts with whom they often saw
  them fight, they were nearly as unwilling to beard the one as the other; and
  to come into collision with a gladiator in the street, was like meeting a
  tiger on the wrong side of his bars. So Hirpinus had plenty of room to undo
  the girl's bands, and remove the stifling folds that muffled her head and
  throat.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" she murmured, as she began to breathe more freely, looking
  round bewildered and confused. "You are Esca's friend. Surely I heard you say
  so. You will take care of me, then, for Esca's sake."</p>

  <p>Instinctively she addressed herself to Hirpinus, instinctively she seemed
  to appeal to him for protection and encouragement. The veil had been taken
  from her head, and the beauty of the sweet pale face was not lost on the
  surrounding gladiators. Old Hirpinus looked at her with a comical expression,
  in which admiration and pity were blended with astonishment and a proud sense
  of personal appropriation in the defenceless girl who seemed utterly
  dependent on him. He had never seen anything so beautiful in his life. He had
  never known the happiness of a home; never had wife nor child: but at that
  moment his heart warmed to her as a father's to a daughter.</p>

  <p>"Where are you," he repeated. "pretty flower? You are within a hundred
  paces of the Flaminian Way. How came you here? Ay, that is more than I can
  tell you. Yonder knave lying there.&mdash;What? he is gone, is he? Ay! I
  could not hit hard enough at a man with whom I have emptied so many skins of
  Sabine.&mdash;Well, Damasippus brought thee here, he best knows why, in his
  master's gaudy chariot. I heard thee speak, my pretty one, and who loves
  Esca, loves me, and I love him, or her, or whoever it may be. So I knocked
  him over, that fat freedman, and took thee from the chariot, and pulled off
  these wraps that were stifling thee, and indeed I think it was about
  time."</p>

  <p>He had raised her while he spoke, and supported her on his strong arm,
  walking slowly on, while the gladiators, closing round them, moved steadily
  along the street, followed, though at a safe distance, by much verbal insult
  and abuse. At intervals, two or three of the rear-guard would turn and
  confront the mob, who immediately gave back and were silent. Thus the party
  proceeded on its way, more, it would seem, with the view of leaving the crowd
  than of reaching any definite place of shelter.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going? and who are those who guard us?" whispered Mariamne,
  clinging close to her protector. "You will take care of me, will you not?"
  she added, in a confiding tone.</p>

  <p>"They are my comrades," he answered soothingly; "and old Hirpinus will
  guard you, pretty one, like the apple of his eye. We will take you straight
  home, or wherever you wish to go, and not one of these will molest you while
  I am by never fear!"</p>

  <p>Just then, Euchenor, who was one of the band, and had overheard this
  reassuring sentence, clapped the old swordsman on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You seem to forget our compact," said he, with his evil, mocking
  laugh.</p>

  <p>The face of Hirpinus fell, and his brow lowered, for he remembered then
  that Mariamne was not much better off here than in the captivity from which
  he had rescued her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-11"
     id="ch2-11">XI</a>. &mdash; THE RULES OF THE FAMILY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Jewess had indeed but escaped one danger to fall into
  another. Bold and lawless as were these professional swordsmen, they
  acknowledged certain rules of their own, which they were never known to
  infringe. When a band of gladiators had been mustered, and told off for a
  particular service, it was their custom to bind themselves by oath, as
  forming one body, unanimous and indivisible, until that service was
  completed. They swore to stand by each other to the death, to obey their
  chief implicitly, and to take orders from him alone&mdash;to make common
  cause with their fellows, in defiance of all personal feelings of interest or
  danger, even to the cheerful sacrifice of life itself; and to consider all
  booty of arms, gold, jewels, captives, or otherwise, however obtained, as the
  property of the band; subject to its disposal, according to the established
  code of their profession. Therefore it was that Hirpinus felt his heart sink
  at Euchenor's malicious observation. Therefore it was that though he strove
  to put on an appearance of good-humour and confidence, a perceptible tremor
  shook his voice while he replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I found her first. I dragged her from the chariot. I put that foolish
  citizen on his back to make sport for you all. I am the oldest swordsman in
  the band. I think you might leave her to me!"</p>

  <p>Euchenor's eye was on the frightened girl, and, meeting its glance, she
  shrank yet closer to her protector, while the Greek observed, with a
  sneer&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You had better make a new set of rules for us then, since you seem
  inclined to break through the old. Comrades, I appeal to you; doth not the
  booty belong to us all, share and share alike?"</p>

  <p>The others were crowding in now, having reached a narrower street, and
  left the populace behind.</p>

  <p>"Of course, of course!" was re-echoed on all sides; "who doubts it? who
  disputes it?"</p>

  <p>"What would you have, man?" exclaimed Hirpinus, waxing wroth. "You cannot
  cut a captive into twenty pieces and give every man a portion! I tell you,
  she is mine. Let her alone!"</p>

  <p>"You cannot cut a wineskin into twenty pieces, nor need you," replied the
  Greek; "but you pass it round amongst your comrades, till every man's thirst
  be slaked. 'Faith, after that, you may keep the empty skin for your own
  share, if you like!"</p>

  <p>He spoke in a cold derisive tone, and although Mariamne could not
  understand half he said, garnished as his speech was with the cant terms of
  his calling, she gathered enough of its import to be terrified at the
  prospect before her. Old Hirpinus lost patience at last.</p>

  <p>"Will you take her from me?" he burst out, knitting his bushy brows, and
  putting his face close to the Greek's. "Stand up then like a man and
  try!"</p>

  <p>Euchenor turned very pale. It was no part of his scheme to provoke his
  robust old comrade to a personal encounter; and, indeed, the pugilist was a
  coward at heart, owing his reputation chiefly to the skill with which he had
  always matched himself against those whom he was sure to conquer. Now he fell
  back a step or two from his glaring adversary, and appealed once more to
  their companions. These gathered round, speaking all at once, Hirpinus
  turning from one to the other, and ever shielding his charge with his body,
  as an animal shields its young. He was determined to save the girl, because
  he understood dimly that she belonged in some way to Esca, and the loyal old
  swordsman would not have hesitated one moment in flinging his life down, then
  and there, to purchase her safety.</p>

  <p>"Hold, comrades!" shouted he, in a stentorian voice that made itself heard
  above the din. "Will ye bay me altogether like a pack of Molossian wolf-
  hounds? Hounds, forsooth! nay, the Molossians are true-bred, and there is one
  cur amongst us here at least, to my knowledge. Rather, like a knot of
  jabbering old women in a market-place! Talk of rules! Of course we abide by
  our rules, ay, and stick to our oath. Rufus, old friend, we have stood with
  our swords at each other's throats for hours together, many a time during the
  last ten years, and never had an angry word or an unkindly thought. Thou wilt
  not fail me now? Thou wilt not see old Hirpinus wronged?"</p>

  <p>The champion thus appealed to by such tender associations, thrust his tall
  person forward in the throng. Slow of speech, calm, calculating, and
  reflective, Rufus was held an oracle of good sense amongst his fellow-
  swordsmen.</p>

  <p>"You are both wrong," said he sententiously. "The girl belongs to neither
  of you. If this had happened yesterday, Hirpinus would have had a right to
  carry her where he chose. But we have taken the oath since then, old comrade,
  and she is the joint property of the band by all our laws."</p>

  <p>"I said so!" exclaimed Euchenor triumphantly. "The prize belongs to us
  all. Every man his turn. The apple seems fair and ripe enough. Mine shall be
  the hand to pare its rind."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he pulled aside the veil which Mariamne had modestly drawn
  once more about her head, and the girl, flushing scarlet at the insult,
  stamped passionately with her foot, and then, as if acknowledging her
  helplessness, burst into tears, and hid her face in her hands. Hirpinus
  caught the aggressor by the shoulder, and sent him reeling back amongst the
  rest. His beard bristled with anger, and the foam stood on his lip like some
  old boar at bay.</p>

  <p>"Hands off!" roared the veteran. "Rules or no rules, another such jest as
  that and I drive a foot of steel through the jester's brisket! What! Rufus, I
  came not into the Family yesterday. I was eating raw flesh and lentil
  porridge when most of these were sucking their mothers' milk. I tell thee,
  man, the old law was this: When gladiators disputed on any subject
  whatever&mdash;pay, plunder, or precedence&mdash;they were to take short
  swords, throw away their shields, and fight it out by pairs, till they were
  agreed. Stand round, comrades! Put the little Greek up at half-sword
  distance; clear a space of seven feet square, not an inch more, and I'll show
  you how we used to settle these matters when Nero wore the purple!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay!" interposed Mariamne, wringing her hands in an agony of terror
  and dismay. "Shed not blood on my account. I am a poor, helpless girl. I have
  done no one any harm. Let me go, for pity's sake! Let me go!"</p>

  <p>But to this solution of the difficulty objections were offered on all
  sides. Rufus indeed, and one or two of the older swordsmen, moved by the
  youth and tears of the captive, would willingly have permitted her to escape;
  but Euchenor, Lutorius, and the rest, objected violently to the loss of so
  beautiful a prize. Rufus, too, when appealed to, though he would fain have
  supported his old comrade, was obliged to confess that justice, according to
  gladiator's law, was on Euchenor's side. Even the proposal to fight for her
  possession by pairs, popular as it was likely to be in such a company, was
  rendered inadmissible by the terms of the late oath. The band, indeed, when
  purchased as they had been by Hippias for a special duty to be performed that
  night, had become pledged, according to custom, not only to the usual
  brotherhood and community of interests, but also to refrain from baring steel
  upon any pretence or provocation either amongst themselves or against a
  common foe, until ordered to do so by their employer. Hirpinus, though he
  chafed and swore vehemently, and kept Mariamne close under his wing through
  it all, was obliged to acknowledge the force of his comrade's arguments; and
  the puzzled athlete racked his unaccustomed brains till his head ached to
  find some means of escape for the girl he had resolved to save. In the
  meantime, delay was dangerous. These men were not used to hesitate or
  refrain, and already the hour was approaching at which they were to muster
  for their night's work, whatever it might be, in the tribune's house. The old
  swordsman felt he must dissemble, were it but to gain time; so he smoothed
  his brows, and, much against the grain, assumed an appearance of good-humour
  and satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Be it as you will," said he; "old Hirpinus is the last man to turn round
  upon his comrades, or to break the laws of the Family, for the sake of a
  cream-coloured face and a wisp of black hair. I will abide by the decision of
  Hippias. We shall find him at the tribune's house, and it is time we were
  there now. Forward, my lads! Nay, hands off! I tell thee once more, Euchenor,
  till we have brought her to the master's she belongs to me."</p>

  <p>Euchenor grumbled, but was compelled to submit; for the other's influence
  amongst the gladiators was far greater than his own. And the little party,
  with Mariamne in the centre, still clinging fast to Hirpinus, moved on in the
  direction of the tribune's house.</p>

  <p>Esca, crouching in his place of concealment, silent and wary, as he had
  ofttimes crouched long ago, when watching for the dun deer on the hillside,
  was aware of the tramp of disciplined men approaching the porch in which he
  lay in ambush. Every faculty was keenly, painfully on the stretch. Once, at
  the sound of wheels, he had started from his lair, ready to make one
  desperate attempt for the rescue of his love; but greatly to his
  consternation, the gilded chariot returned empty, save of Automedon, looking
  much scared and bewildered. The wily Oarses, indeed, having made his escape
  from the gladiators, had betaken himself to his lodging, and there determined
  to remain, either till his patron's wrath should be exhausted, or till the
  events which he foresaw the night would bring forth should have diverted it
  into another channel. So Automedon went home in fear and trembling by
  himself. As the Briton revolved matters in his mind, he knew not whether to
  be most alarmed or reassured by this unforeseen contingency. Though the
  chariot had returned without Mariamne, the freedmen and armed slaves were
  still absent. Could they have missed their prey, and were they still
  searching for her? or had they carried her elsewhere?&mdash;to the freedmen's
  garret, perhaps, there to remain concealed till the night was further
  advanced. Yet the words of Placidus, or of his ghost, which he had overheard,
  seemed to infer that the Jewess was expected every minute. Every minute
  indeed! and those racking minutes seemed to stretch themselves to hours. With
  the natural impatience of inaction, which accompanies uncertainty, he had
  almost made up his mind to return in search of Eleazar, when the steady
  footfall of the approaching party arrested his attention.</p>

  <p>There was a bright moon shining above, and the open space into which the
  gladiators advanced was clear as day. With a keen feeling of confidence he
  recognised the square frame of Hirpinus, and then, as he caught sight of the
  dark-robed figure at the swordsman's side, for one exulting moment, doubt,
  fear, anxiety, all were merged in the delight of seeing Mariamne once more.
  With the bound of a wild deer, he was in the midst of them, clasping her in
  his arms, and the girl sobbing on his breast felt safe and happy, because she
  was with him. Hirpinus gave a shout that startled the slaves laying the
  tables in the inner hall.</p>

  <p>"Safe, my lad!" he exclaimed. "and in a whole skin. Sound and hearty, and
  fit to join us in to-night's work. Better late than never. Swear him,
  comrades! swear him on the spot! Send in for a morsel of bread and a pinch of
  salt Here, Rufus, cross thy blade with mine! Thou art in the nick of time,
  lad, to take thy share with the rest, of peril, and pleasure, and profit to
  boot!"</p>

  <p>This speech he eked out with many winks and signs to his young friend, for
  Hirpinus, guessing how matters stood between the pair, could think of no
  better plan by which Esca should at least claim a share in the prey they had
  so recently acquired. His artifice was, however, lost upon the Briton, who
  seemed wholly occupied with Mariamne, and to whom the girl was whispering her
  fears and distresses, and entreaties that he would save her from the band.
  The young man drew her to his side.</p>

  <p>"Give way," said he haughtily, as Euchenor and Lutorius closed in upon
  him. "She has made her choice, she goes with me. I take her home to her
  father's house."</p>

  <p>The others set up a shout of derision.</p>

  <p>"Hear him!" they cried. "It is the praetor who speaks! It is the voice of
  Caesar himself! Yes, yes, go in peace, if thou wilt. We have had enough and
  to spare of your yellow-haired barbarians, but the girl remains with us."</p>

  <p>She was not trembling now. She was past all fear in such a crisis as this.
  Erect and defiant she stood beside her champion pale indeed as the dead, but
  with eyes in which flashed the courage of despair. His lips were white with
  the effort of self-command as he strove to keep cool and to use fair
  words.</p>

  <p>"I am one of yourselves," said he. "You will not turn against me all at
  once. Let me but take the maiden home, and I will come back and join you,
  true as the blade to the haft."</p>

  <p>"Ay, let them go!" put in Hirpinus. "He speaks fairly, and these
  barbarians never fail their word!"</p>

  <p>"No, no," interposed Euchenor. "He has nothing to do with us. Why, he was
  beaten in the open circus by a mere patrician. Besides, he is not engaged for
  to-night. He has no interest in the job. Who is he, this barbarian, that we
  should give up to him the fairest prize we are like to take in the whole
  business?"</p>

  <p>"Will you fight for her?" thundered Esca, hitching his sword belt to the
  front</p>

  <p>Euchenor shrank back amongst his comrades. "Our oath forbids me," said he;
  and the others, though they could not refrain from jeering at the unwilling
  Greek, confirmed his decision.</p>

  <p>Esca's mind was made up.</p>

  <p>"Pass your hands under my girdle," he whispered to Mariamne. "Hold fast,
  and we shall break through!"</p>

  <p>His sword was out like lightning, and he dashed amongst the gladiators,
  but he had to do with men thoroughly skilled in arms and trained to every
  kind of personal contest. A dozen blades were gleaming in the moonlight as
  ready as his own. A dozen points were threatening him, backed by fearless
  hearts, and strong supple practised hands. He was at bay; a desperate man
  penned in by a circle of steel. He glanced fiercely round, defiant yet
  bewildered, then down at the-pale face at his breast, and his heart sank
  within him. He was at his wits' end. She looked up&mdash;loving, resolute,
  and courageous.</p>

  <p>"Dear one," she said softly. "let me rather die by your hand. See, I do
  not fear. Strike! You only have the right, for I am yours!"</p>

  <p>Even then a faint blush came into her cheek, while the pale hands busied
  themselves with her dress to bare her bosom for the blow. He turned his point
  upon her, and she smiled up in his face. Old Hirpinus dashed the tears from
  his shaggy eyelashes.</p>

  <p>"Hold! hold!" said he, in a broken voice; "not till I am down and out of
  the game for one! Enough of this!" he added in an altered tone, and with a
  ludicrous assumption of his usual careless manner. "Here comes the
  master&mdash;no more wrangling, lads! we will refer the matter to him!"</p>

  <p>While he spoke, Hippias entered the open space in front of the tribune's
  house, and the gladiators gathered eagerly around him, Euchenor alone
  remaining somewhat in the background.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-12"
     id="ch2-12">XII</a>. &mdash; A MASTER OF FENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">HIPPIAS knew well how to maintain discipline amongst his
  followers. While he interested himself keenly in their training and personal
  welfare, he permitted no approach to familiarity, and above all never
  suffered a syllable of discussion on a command, or a moment's hesitation in
  its fulfilment. He came now to put himself at their head for the carrying out
  of a hazardous and important enterprise. The consciousness of coming danger,
  especially when it is of a kind with which habit has rendered him familiar,
  and which practice has taught him to baffle by his own skill and courage, has
  a good moral effect on a brave man's character. It cheers his spirits, it
  exalts his imagination, it sharpens his intellects, and, above all, it
  softens his heart. Hippias felt that to-night he would need all the qualities
  he most prized to carry him safely through his task&mdash;that while failure
  must be inevitable destruction, success would open out to him a career of
  which the ultimate goal might be a procuratorship or even a kingdom. How
  quickly past, present, and possible future, flitted through his brain! It was
  not so long since his first victory in the amphitheatre! He remembered, as if
  it were but yesterday, the canvas awnings, the blue sky, and the confused
  mass of faces, framing that dazzling sweep of sand, all of which his sight
  took in at once, though his eyes were fixed on those of the watchful Gaul,
  whom he disarmed in a couple of passes, and slew without the slightest
  remorse. He could feel again, even now, the hot breath of the Libyan tiger,
  as he fell beneath it, choked with sand and covered by his buckler, stabbing
  desperately at that sinewy chest in which the life seemed to lie so deep. The
  tiger's claws had left their marks upon his brawny shoulder, but he had risen
  from the contest victorious, and Red and Green through the whole crowded
  building, from the senators' cushions to the slaves' six inches of
  standing-room, cheered him to a man. After this triumph, who such a favourite
  with the Roman people as handsome Hippias? Again, he was the centre of all
  observation, as, confessedly the head of his profession, he set in order
  Nero's cruel shows, and catered with profuse splendour for the tastes of
  Imperial Rome. Yes, he had reached the pinnacle of a gladiator's fame, and
  from that elevation a prospect opened itself that he had scarcely even
  dreamed of till now. A handful of determined men, a torch or two for every
  score of blades, a palace in flames, a night of blood (he only hoped and
  longed that there might be resistance enough to distinguish strife from
  murder), another dynasty, a grateful patron, and a brave man's services
  worthily acknowledged and repaid. Then the future would indeed smile in
  gorgeous hues. Which of Rome's dominions in the East would most fully satisfy
  the thirst for royal luxury that he now experienced for the first time? In
  which of his manlier qualities was he so inferior to the Jew, that Hippias
  the gladiator should make a lowlier monarch than Herod the Great? and men had
  not done talking of that warlike king, even now! his wisdom, his cruelty, his
  courage, his splendour, and his crimes. A Roman province was but another name
  for an independent government. Hippias saw himself enthroned in the blaze of
  majesty under a glowing Eastern sky. Life offering all it had to give of pomp
  and pageantry and rich material enjoyment. Slaves, horses, jewels, banquets,
  dark-eyed women, silken eunuchs, and gaudy guards with burnished helmets and
  flashing shields of gold. Nothing wanting, not even one with whom to share
  the glittering vision. Valeria would be his. Valeria was born to be a queen.
  It would, indeed, be a triumph to offer the half of a throne to the woman who
  had hitherto condescended by listening to his suit. There was a leavening of
  generosity in Hippias that caused him to reflect with intense pleasure on the
  far deeper homage he would pay her after so romantic a consummation of his
  hopes. He felt as if he could almost love her then, with the love he had
  experienced in his boyhood&mdash;that boyhood which seemed now to have been
  another's rather than his own. He had put it away long since, and it had not
  come back to him for years till to-day; but gratified vanity, the pleasure
  which most hearts experience in grasping an object that has been dangling out
  of reach, beyond all, the power exerted by a woman, over one who has been
  accustomed to consider himself either above or below such pleasing
  influences, had softened him strangely, and he hardly felt like the same man
  who made his bargain with the tribune for a certain quantity of flesh and
  blood and mettle, so short a time ago.</p>

  <p>It is not to be thought, however, that in his dreams of the future, the
  fencing-master neglected the means by which that future was to be attained.
  He had mustered and prepared his band with more than common care; had seen
  with his own eyes that their arms were bright and sharp and fit for work; had
  placed them at their appointed posts and visited them repeatedly, enjoining,
  above all things, extreme vigilance and sobriety. Not one of those men saw
  beneath his unruffled brow and quiet stern demeanour anything unusual in the
  conduct of their leader; not one could have guessed that schemes of ambition
  far beyond any he had ever cherished before, were working in his brain that a
  strange, soft, kindly feeling was nestling at his heart. He stood in the
  moonlight amongst his followers, calm, abrupt, severe as usual; and when
  Hirpinus looked into his stern set face, the hopes of the old gladiator fell
  as did his countenance, but Mariamne perceived at once with a woman's eye
  something that taught her an appeal to his pity on this occasion would not be
  made in vain.</p>

  <p>With habitual caution, his first proceeding was to count the band ere he
  took note of the two figures in their centre. Then he cast a scrutinising
  glance at their arms to satisfy himself all were ready for immediate action.
  After that he turned with a displeased air to Hirpinus, and asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What doth the woman amongst us? You heard my orders this morning? Who
  brought her here?"</p>

  <p>Half a dozen voices were raised at once to answer the master's question;
  only he to whom it was especially addressed kept silence, knowing the nature
  with which he had to do. Hippias raised but his sheathed sword and the
  clamour ceased. Not a maniple in all Rome's well-drilled legions seemed in
  better discipline than this handful of desperate men. Then he turned to Esca,
  still speaking in short incisive tones.</p>

  <p>"Briton!" said he. "you are not one of us to-night. Go your ways in
  peace!"</p>

  <p>"Well said!" shouted the gladiators. "He is no comrade of ours! He hath no
  share in our spoil!"</p>

  <p>But Hippias only wished to save the Briton from the perils of the coming
  night, and this from some vague feeling he could hardly explain to himself,
  that Valeria was interested in the stalwart barbarian. It was not in the
  fencing-master's nature to entertain sentiments of jealousy upon uncertain
  grounds. And he was just fond enough of Valeria to value anyone she liked for
  her sake. Moreover Esca knew their plans. He would alarm the palace, and
  there would be a fight He wished nothing better.</p>

  <p>Esca was about to make his appeal, but Mariamne interposed.</p>

  <p>"Where he goeth I will go," said she, almost in the words of her own
  sacred writings. "I have to-night lost father, and home, and people. This is
  the second time he hath saved me from captivity worse than death. Part us not
  now, I beseech thee, part us not!"</p>

  <p>Hippias looked kindly on the sweet face with its large imploring eager
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You love him," said he. "foolish girl. Begone then, and take him with
  you."</p>

  <p>But again a fierce murmur rose amongst the gladiators. Not even the
  master's authority was sufficient to carry out such a breach of all laws and
  customs as this. Euchenor, ever prone to wrangle, stepped forward from the
  background, where he had remained so as to appear an impartial and
  uninterested observer.</p>

  <p>"The oath!" exclaimed the Greek. "The oath&mdash;we swore it when the sun
  was up&mdash;shall we break it ere the moon goes down? She is ours, Hippias,
  by all the laws of the Family, and we will not give her up."</p>

  <p>"Silence!" thundered the master, with a look that made Euchenor shrink
  back once more. "Who asked <i>you</i> for your vote? Hirpinus, Rufus, once
  again, how came this woman here?"</p>

  <p>"She was bound hand and foot in a chariot," answered the former, ignoring,
  however, with less than his usual frankness, to whom that chariot belonged.
  "She was carried away by force. I protected her from ill-usage," he added
  stoutly. "as I would protect her again."</p>

  <p>The girl gave him a grateful look, which sank into the old swordsman's
  heart. Esca, too, muttered warm broken words of thanks, while the band
  assented to the truth of this statement.</p>

  <p>"Even so!" they exclaimed. "Hirpinus speaks well. That is why she belongs
  to us, and we claim every man his share."</p>

  <p>Hippias was too experienced a commander not to know that there are times
  when it is necessary to yield with a good grace, and to use artifice if force
  will not avail. It is thus the skilful rider rules his steed, and the
  judicious wife her husband the governing power in either case inducing the
  governed&mdash; to believe that it obeys entirely of its own free will. He
  smiled, therefore, pleasantly on his followers, and addressed them in
  careless good-humoured tones.</p>

  <p>"She belongs to us all without doubt," said he. "and, by the sandals of
  Aphrodite, she is so fair that I shall put in my claim with the rest!
  Nevertheless there is no time to be wasted now, for the sake of the brightest
  eyes that ever flashed beneath a veil. Put her aside for a few hours or so.
  You, Hirpinus, as you captured her, shall take care that she does not escape.
  For the Briton, we may as well keep him safe too&mdash;we may find a use for
  those long arms of his when to-night's business is accomplished. In the
  meantime, fall in, my heroes, and make ready for your work. Supper first (and
  it's laid even now) with the noblest patrician and the deepest drinker in
  Rome, Julius Placidus the tribune!"</p>

  <p><i>Euge!</i> exclaimed the gladiators in a breath, forgetful at the moment
  of their recent dissatisfaction, and eager to hear more of the night's
  enterprise, about which they entertained the wildest and most various
  anticipations; nothing loth, besides, to share the orgies of a man whose
  table was celebrated for its luxuries amongst all classes in Rome. Hippias
  looked round on their well-pleased faces, and continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Then what say you, my children, to a walk through the palace gardens? We
  will take our swords, by Hercules, for the German guards are stubborn dogs,
  and best convinced by the argument each of us carries at his belt. It may be
  dark, too, ere we get there, for the moon is early to-night, and we have no
  need to stir till we have tasted the tribune's wine, so we must not forget a
  few torches to light us on our way. There are a score at least lying ready in
  the corner of that porch. So we will join our comrades in a fair midnight
  frolic under Caesar's roof. Caesar's, forsooth! my children, there will be a
  smouldering palace and another Caesar by tomorrow!"</p>

  <p><i>Euge!</i> exclaimed the gladiators once more. "Hail, Caesar! Long live
  Caesar!" they repeated with shouts of fierce mocking laughter.</p>

  <p>"It is well," remarked Rufus sagaciously, when silence was restored. "The
  pay is good and the work no heavier than an ordinary praetor's show. But I
  remember a fiercer lion than common, that Nero turned loose upon us once in
  the arena, and we called him Caesar amongst ourselves, because he was
  dangerous to meddle with. If the old man's purple is to be rent, we should
  have something over the regular pay. They have not lasted long of late; but
  still, Hippias, 'tis somewhat out of the usual business. We don't change an
  emperor every night, even now."</p>

  <p>"True enough," answered the master good-humouredly. "And you have never
  been within the walls of a palace in your life. Something beyond your pay,
  said you? Why, man, the pay is but a pretext, a mere matter of form. Once in
  Caesar's chambers, a large-fisted fellow like Rufus here, may carry away a
  king's ransom in either hand. Then think of the old wine! Fifty-year-old
  Caecuban, in six-quart cups of solid gold, and welcome to take the goblet
  away with you, besides, if you care to be encumbered with it. Shawls from
  Persia, lying about for mere coverings to the couches. Mother-of-pearl and
  ivory gleaming in every corner. Jewels scattered in heaps upon the floor.
  Only get the work done first, and every man here shall help himself
  unquestioned, and walk home with whatever pleases him best."</p>

  <p>It was not often Hippias treated his followers to so long a speech, or
  one, in their estimation, so much to the purpose. They marked their approval
  with vehement and repeated shouts. They ceased to think of Esca, and forgot
  all about Mariamne and their late dissatisfaction; nay, they seemed now but
  to be impatient of every subject unconnected with their enterprise, and to
  grudge every minute that delayed them from their promised spoil. At a signal
  from Hippias and his intimation that supper was ready, and their host
  awaiting them, they rushed tumultuously through the porch, leaving behind
  them Mariamne and Esca, guarded only by old Hirpinus and Euchenor, the latter
  appearing alone to be unmoved by the glowing prospects of plunder held out,
  and obstinately standing on his rights, determined not to lose sight of the
  captured girl, the more so that she was now overlooked by the rest of his
  comrades.</p>

  <p>This man, though deficient in the dashing physical daring which is so
  popular a quality amongst those of his profession, possessed, nevertheless, a
  dogged tenacity of purpose, totally unqualified by any moral scruples or
  feelings of shame, which rendered him formidable as an antagonist, and
  generally successful in any villany he attempted. As in the combats he waged
  with or without the heavy lacerating <i>cestus</i>, his object was to tire
  out his adversary by protracted and scientific defence, taking as little
  punishment as possible, and never hazarding a blow save when it could not be
  returned, so in everything he undertook, it was his study to reach the goal
  by unrelaxing vigilance, and unremitting recourse to the means which
  experience and common sense pointed out for its attainment. Slinking behind
  the broad back of Hirpinus, he concealed himself in the darkest corner of the
  porch, and watched the result of Mariamne's appeal to the fencing-master.</p>

  <p>Hippias pushed the gladiators on before him, with boisterous good-humour
  and considerable violence; as they crowded through the narrow entrance, he
  remained behind for a moment, and whispered to Esca&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You will take the girl home, comrade. Can I trust you?"</p>

  <p>"Trust me!" was all the Briton answered, but the tone in which he spoke,
  and the glance he exchanged with Mariamne, might have satisfied a more
  exacting inquirer than the captain of gladiators.</p>

  <p>"Fare thee well, lad," said Hirpinus. "and thee, too, my pretty flower. I
  would go with you myself, but it is a long way from here to Tiber-side, and I
  must not be missing to-night, come what may."</p>

  <p>"Begone, both of you!" added Hippias hurriedly. "Had it not been for the
  plunder, I should scarce have found my lambs so reasonable to-night; were you
  to fall in with them again, the Vestals themselves could not save you.
  Begone, and farewell."</p>

  <p>They obeyed and hastened off, while the fencing-master, with a well-
  pleased smile, clapped Hirpinus on the shoulder, and accompanied him into the
  house.</p>

  <p>"Old comrade," said he. "we will drink a measure of the tribune's Caecuban
  to-night, come what may. To-morrow we shall either be on our backs gaping for
  the death-fee, or pressing our lips to nothing meaner than a chalice of
  burnished gold. Who knows? Who cares?"</p>

  <p>"Not I for one," replied Hirpinus; "but I am strangely thirsty in the
  meantime, and the tribune's wine, they tell me, is the best in Rome."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-13"
     id="ch2-13">XIII</a>. &mdash; THE ESQUILINE</h2>

  <p class="first">WITH attentive ears, and faculties keenly on the stretch,
  Euchenor, lurking in the corner of the porch, listened to the foregoing
  conversation. When he gathered that Tiber-side was the direction the
  fugitives meant to take, his quick Greek intellect formed its plan of
  operation at once.</p>

  <p>There was a post of his comrades, consisting of some of the gladiators
  purchased by Placidus, and placed there a few hours since by the orders of
  Hippias, in the direct road for that locality. He would follow the pair,
  noiseless and unsuspected, for he had no mind to provoke an encounter with
  the Briton till within reach of assistance, then give the alarm, seize the
  wayfarers, and appeal to the club-law they all held sacred, for his rights.
  Esca would be sure to defend the girl with his life, but he would be
  overpowered by numbers, and it would be strange if he could not be quieted
  for ever in the struggle. There would still be time enough, thought Euchenor,
  after his victory to join his comrades at the tribune's table, leaving the
  girl to the tender mercies of the band. He could make some excuse for his
  absence to satisfy his companions, heated as they would by that time be with
  wine. Indeed, for his own part, he had no great fancy for the night's
  adventure, promising as it did more hard knocks than he cared to exchange in
  a fight with the German guard, fierce blue-eyed giants, who would give and
  take no quarter. He did not wish, indeed, to lose his share of the plunder,
  for no one was more alive to the advantages of a full purse, but he trusted
  to his own dexterity for securing this, without running unnecessary risk.
  Meanwhile, it was his method to attend to one thing at a time; he waited
  impatiently, therefore, till Hippias entered the house, and left him at
  liberty to emerge from his hiding-place.</p>

  <p>No sooner was the master's back turned than the Greek sped into the
  street, glancing eagerly down its long vista, lying white in the moonlight,
  for the two dark figures he sought. Agile and noiseless as a panther, he
  skulked swiftly along under the shadow of the houses, till he reached the
  corner which a passenger would turn who was bound for Tiber-side. Here he
  made sure that he must sight his prey; but no, amongst the few wayfarers who
  dotted this less solitary district he looked in vain for Esca's towering
  shoulders or the shrinking figure of the Jewess. In vain, like a hound, he
  quested to and fro, now casting forward upon a vague speculation, now trying
  back with untiring perseverance and determination. Like a hound, too, whose
  game has foiled him, he was obliged to slink home at length, ashamed and
  baffled, to the porch of the tribune's house, inventing as he went a
  plausible excuse to host and comrades for his tardy appearance at the
  banquet. He had passed, nevertheless, within twenty paces of those he hunted,
  but he knew it not.</p>

  <p>With the first rapture of intense joy for their escape, it was in the
  nature of Mariamne that her predominant feeling should be one of gratitude to
  Heaven for thus preserving both herself and him whose life was dearer to her
  than her own. In common with her nation, she believed in the constant and
  immediate interposition of the Almighty in favour of His servants; and the
  new faith, which was rapidly gaining ground in her heart, had tempered the
  awe in which His worshipper regards the Deity, with the implicit trust, and
  love, and confidence, entertained for its father by a child. Such feelings
  can but find an outlet in thanksgiving and prayer. Before Mariamne had gone
  ten paces from the tribune's house, she stopped short, looked up in Esca's
  face, and said: " Let us kneel together, and thank God for our
  deliverance."</p>

  <p>"Not here at least!" exclaimed the Briton, whose nerves, good as they
  were, had been somewhat unstrung by the vicissitudes of the night, and the
  apprehensions that had racked him for his beloved companion. "They may return
  at any moment. You are not safe even now. If you are so exhausted you cannot
  go on (for she was leaning heavily on his arm, and her head drooped), I will
  carry you in my arms from here to your father's house. My love, I would carry
  you through the world."</p>

  <p>She smiled sweetly on him, though her face was very pale. "Let us turn in
  at this ruined gateway," said she; " a few moments' rest will restore me;
  and, Esca, I must give thanks to the God of Israel, who has saved both thee
  and me."</p>

  <p>They were near a crumbling archway, with a broken iron gate that had
  fallen in. It was on the opposite side of the street to the tribune's house;
  and as they passed beneath its mouldering span, they saw that it formed an
  entrance into one of those wildernesses, which, after the great fire of Nero,
  existed here and there, not only in the suburbs, but at the very heart of
  Rome. They were, in truth, in that desolate waste which had once been the
  famous Esquiline Gardens, originally a burial-ground, and granted by Augustus
  to his favourite, the illustrious Maecenas, to plant and decorate according
  to his prolific fancy and unimpeachable taste. That learned nobleman had
  taken advantage of his emperor's liberality to build here a stately palace,
  which had not, however, escaped the great fire, and to lay out extensive
  pleasure-grounds, which had been devastated by the same calamity. Little,
  indeed, now remained, save the trees that had originally shadowed the Roman's
  grave in the days of the old Republic. The "unwelcome cypresses" so
  touchingly described in his most reflective ode, by him whose genius Maecenas
  fostered, and whose gratitude paid his princely patron back by rendering him
  immortal.</p>

  <p>Many a time had Horace lounged in these pleasant shades, musing with
  quaint and varied fancies, half pathetic, half grotesque, on the business and
  the pleasures, the sunshine and the shadows, the aim and the end, of that to
  him inexplicable problem, a man's short life. Here, too, perhaps, he
  speculated on the mythology, to the beauty of which his poetic imagination
  was so keenly alive, while his strong common sense and somewhat material
  character must have been so utterly incredulous of its truth. Nay, on this
  very spot did he not ridicule certain superstitions of his countrymen, with a
  coarseness that is only redeemed by its wit? and preserve, in pungent
  sarcasm, for coming ages, the memory of an indecent statue on the Esquiline,
  as he has preserved in sweet and glowing lines the glades of cool Praeneste,
  or the terraced vineyards basking in the glare and glitter of noonday on
  Tibur's sunny slopes? Here, perhaps, many a time may have been seen the stout
  sleek form, so round and well-cared for, with its clean white gown, and
  dainty shining head, crowned with a garland of festive roses, and not
  wanting, be sure, a festive goblet in its hand. Here may the poet have sat
  out many a joyous hour in the shade, with mirth, and song, and frequent sips
  of old Falernian, and a vague dreary fancy the while ever present, though
  unacknowledged&mdash;like a death's-head at the banquet&mdash;that feast, and
  jest, and song could not last for ever, but that the time must come at
  length, when the empty jar would not be filled again, when the faded roses
  could be bound together no longer in a chaplet for the unconscious brows, and
  the string of the lyre, once snapped, must be silent henceforward for
  evermore. The very waterfall that had soothed its master to his noonday
  slumber in the drowsy shade, was now dried up, and in the cavity above, a
  heap of dusty rubbish alone remained, where erst the cool translucent surface
  shone, fair and smooth as glass. Weeds were growing rank and tall, where once
  the myrtle quivered and the roses bloomed. Where Chloe gambolled and where
  Lydia sang, the raven croaked and fluttered, and the night-owl screamed.
  Instead of velvet turf and trim exotic shrubs, and shapely statues framed in
  bowers of green, the nettle spread its festering carpet, and the dock put out
  its pointed leaf; and here and there a tombstone showed its slab of marble,
  smooth and grim, like a bone that has been laid bare. All was ruin or decay a
  few short years had done the work of ages; and whether they waked or whether
  they slept, poet and patron had gone hence, never to return.</p>

  <p>Under the branches of a spectral holm-oak, blackened, withered, and
  destroyed by fire, Mariamne paused, and clung with both hands to her
  companion's arm. Bravely had the girl borne up for hours against terrible
  mental anxiety, as well as actual bodily pain, but with relief and
  comparative safety came the reaction. Her eyes grew dim, her senses seemed
  failing, and her limbs trembled so that she was unable to proceed. He hung
  over her in positive fear. The pale face looked so deathlike that his bold
  heart quailed, as the possibility presented itself of life without her.
  Propped in his strong grasp she soon recovered, and he told her as much, in a
  few frank simple words.</p>

  <p>"And yet it must come at last," said she gently. "What is the short span
  of a man's life, Esca, for such love as ours? Even had we everything we can
  wish, all the world can give, there would be a sting in each moment of
  happiness at the thought that it must end so soon."</p>

  <p>"Happiness!" repeated Esca. "What is it? Why is there so little of it on
  earth? <i>My</i> happiness is to be with you; and see, I win it but for an
  hour at a time, at a cost to yourself I cannot bear to think of."</p>

  <p>She looked lovingly in his face.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose <i>I</i> would count the cost?" said she. "Ever since the
  night you took me from those fearful revellers, and brought me so gently and
  so courteously to my father's house, I&mdash;I have never forgotten what I
  owe you."</p>

  <p>He raised her hand to his lips, with the action of an inferior doing
  homage. Alone with the woman he loved, the very depth and generosity of his
  young affection made him look on her as something sacred and apart. She
  hesitated, for she had yet more to say, which maiden shame repressed, lest it
  should disclose her feelings too openly; but she loved him well: she could
  not keep silence on so vital a subject, and after a pause, she took courage
  and asked</p>

  <p>"Esca, could you bear to think we were never to meet again?"</p>

  <p>"I would rather die at once!" he exclaimed fervently.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, and smiled rather sadly.</p>

  <p>"But after death," she insisted; "after death do you believe you will see
  me no more?"</p>

  <p>He looked blank and confused. The same question had been present almost
  unconsciously in his mind, but had never taken so definite a shape
  before.</p>

  <p>"You would make me a coward, Mariamne," said he; " when I think of you, I
  almost fear to die."</p>

  <p>They were standing under the holm-oak, where the moonlight streamed down
  clear and cold through the bare branches. It shone on a slab of marble, half
  defaced, half overgrown with moss. Nevertheless, on that surface was
  distinctly carved the horse's head with which the Roman loved to decorate the
  stone that marked his last resting-place.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what that means?" said she, pointing to this quaint and yet
  suggestive symbol. "Even the proud Roman feels that death and departure are
  the same, that he is going on a journey he knows not where, but one from
  which he never shall return. It is a journey we must all take, none can tell
  how soon; for you and me the horse may be harnessed this very night. But I
  know where I am going, Esca. If you had slain me an hour ago with your sword,
  I should have been there even now."</p>

  <p>"And I?" he exclaimed. "Should I have been with you? for I would have died
  amongst the gladiators as I have seen a wolf die in my own country,
  overmatched by hounds. Mariamne, you would not have left me for ever? What
  would have become of me?"</p>

  <p>Again she shook her head with the same pitiful plaintive smile.</p>

  <p>"You do not know the way," said she. "You have no guide to take you by the
  hand; you would be lost in the darkness; and I&mdash;I should see you no
  more. Oh! Esca, I can teach you, I can show it you. Let us travel it
  together, and, come what may, we need never part again!"</p>

  <p>Then the girl knelt down under that dead tree, with the moonbeams shining
  on her pale face, and her lips moved in whispered thanksgiving for the late
  escape, and prayer for him who now stood by her side, and who watched her
  with wistful looks, as a child watches a piece of mechanism of which he sees
  plainly the effect, while he strives in vain to comprehend the cause. It
  seemed to Esca that the woman he loved must have found the talisman that all
  his youth he had felt a vague consciousness he wanted&mdash;something beyond
  manly courage, or burning patriotism, or the dogged obstinacy that fortifies
  itself by defying the worst. Moreover, the course of his past life, above
  all, the trials he had lately undergone, could not but have prepared the
  ground for the reception of that good seed which brings forth such good
  fruit, could not but have shown him the necessity for a strength superior to
  the bravest endurance of mere humanity, for a hope that was fixed beyond the
  grave. A few minutes she remained on her knees, praying fervently for
  herself, for him. He felt that it was so, and while his eyes were riveted on
  the dear face, so pure and peaceful, turned upward to the sky, he knew that
  his own being was elevated by her holy influence, that the earthly affection
  of a lover for his mistress, was in his breast refined by the adoration of a
  worshipper for a saint.</p>

  <p>Then she rose, and taking him by the arm, walked leisurely on her way,
  discoursing, as she went, on certain truths which she had learnt from
  Calchas, and which she believed with the faith of those who have been taught
  by one, himself an eye-witness of the wonders he relates. There were no
  dogmas in those early days of the Christian Church to distract the minds of
  its votaries from the simple tenets of their creed. The grain of mustard-seed
  had not yet shot up into that goodly tree which has since borne so many
  branches, and the pruning-knife, hereafter to lop away so many redundant
  heresies, was not as yet unsheathed. The Christian of the first century held
  to a very simple exposition of his faith as handed down to him from his
  Divine Master. Trust and love were the fundamental rules of his order. Trust
  that in the extremity of mortal agony could penetrate beyond the gates of
  death, and brighten the martyr's face with a ray of splendour " like the face
  of an angel." Love that embraced all things, downward from the Creator to the
  lowest of the created, that opened its heart freely and ungrudgingly to each,
  the sinner, the prodigal, and the traveller who fell among thieves. Other
  faiths, indeed, and other motives have fortified men to march proudly to the
  stake, to bear without wincing tortures that forced the sickening spectator
  to turn shuddering away. A heathen or a Jew could front the lion's sullen
  scowl, or the grin and glare of the cruel tiger, in the amphitheatre, with
  the dignified composure that brave men borrow from despair; could behold
  unmoved the straight-cut furrow in the sand that marked the arena of his
  sufferings, soon to run crimson with his blood. Even athwart the dun smoke,
  amidst the leaping yellow flames, pale faces have been seen to move, majestic
  and serene as spectres, with no sustaining power beyond that of a lofty
  courage, the offspring of education and of pride. But it was the Christian
  alone who could submit to the vilest degradations and the fiercest sufferings
  with a humble and even cheerful thankfulness; who could drink from the bitter
  cup and accept the draught without a murmur, save of regret for his own
  unworthiness; nay, who could forgive and bless the very tyranny that
  extorted, the very hand that ministered to, the tortures he endured.</p>

  <p>In its early days, fresh from the fountain-head, the Christian's was,
  indeed, essentially and emphatically, a religion of love. To feed the hungry,
  to clothe the naked, to stretch a hand to the fallen, to think no evil, to
  judge not, nor to condemn, in short, to love " the brother whom he had seen,"
  were the direct commands of that Great Example who had so recently been here
  on earth. His first disciples strove, hard as fallible humanity can, to
  imitate Him, and in so striving, failed not to attain a certain peaceful
  composure and contentment of mind, that no other code of morality, no other
  system of philosophy, had ever yet produced. Perhaps this was the quality
  that, in his dealings with his victim, the Roman executioner found most
  mysterious and inexplicable.</p>

  <p>Fortitude, resolution, defiance, these he could understand: but the
  childlike simplicity that accepted good and evil with equal confidence; that
  was thankful and cheerful under both, and that entertained neither care for
  to-day nor anxiety for to-morrow, was a moral elevation, at which, with all
  their pretensions, his own countrymen had never yet been able to arrive.
  Neither Stoic nor Epicurean, Sophist nor Philosopher, could look upon life,
  and death also, with the calm assurance of these unlearned men, leaning on a
  hand the Roman could not see, convinced of an immortality the Roman was
  unable to conceive.</p>

  <p>With this happy conviction beaming in her face, Mariamne inculcated on
  Esca the tenets of her noble faith; explaining, not logically, indeed, but
  with woman's persuasive reasonings of the heart, how fair was the prospect
  thus open to him, how glorious the reward, which, though mortal eye could not
  behold it, mortal hand could not take away. Promises of future happiness are
  none the less glowing that they fall on a man's ear from the lips he loves.
  Conviction goes the straighter to his heart when it pervades another's that
  beats in unison with his own. Under that moonlit sky, reddened in the horizon
  with the glare of a distant quarter of the city already set on fire by the
  insurgents; in that dreary waste of the Esquiline, with its blasted trees,
  its shrieking night-birds, and its scattered grave-stones, the Briton imbibed
  the first principles of Christianity from the daughter of Judah, whom he
  loved; and the girl's face beamed with a holy tenderness more than mortal,
  while she showed the way of everlasting happiness, and life, and light, to
  him whose soul was dearer to her than her own.</p>

  <p>And meanwhile around them on all sides, murder, rapine, and violence were
  stalking abroad unchecked. Riotous parties of Vespasian's supporters met,
  here and there, detached companies of Caesar's broken legions; and when such
  collisions took place, the combatants fought madly, as it would seem from
  mere wanton love of bloodshed, to the death; whichever conquered, neither
  spared the dissolute citizens, who indeed, when safe out of reach, from roofs
  or windows encouraged the strife heartily with word and gesture. Sparks fell
  in showers through the streets of Rome, and blood and wine ran in streams
  along the pavement; nor were the deserted gardens of the Esquiline
  undisturbed by the tumult and devastation that pervaded the rest of the
  unhappy city.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-14"
     id="ch2-14">XIV</a>. &mdash; THE CHURCH</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN they sought to leave their place of refuge, Esca and
  Mariamne found themselves hemmed in and drawn back by the continued tumult
  that was raging through the surrounding quarters. On all sides were heard the
  shouts of victory, the shrieks of despair, and the mad riot of drunken mirth.
  Occasionally, flying parties of pursuers or pursued swept through the very
  outskirts of the gardens themselves, compelling the Briton and his charge to
  plunge deeper into its gloomy solitudes for concealment.</p>

  <p>At length they reached a place of comparative safety, under a knot of dark
  cypresses that had escaped the general conflagration, and here they paused to
  take breath and listen, Mariamne becoming every moment more composed and
  tranquil, while Esca, with a beating heart, calculated the many chances that
  must still be risked ere they could 'reach her home beyond the Tiber, and he
  could place the daughter in safety under her father's roof once more. It was
  very dark where they were, for the cypresses grew thick and black between
  them and the sky. The place had probably in former times been a favourite
  resort in the noonday heat. There were the remains of a grotto or
  summer-house not yet wholly destroyed, and the fragments of a wide stone
  basin, from which a fountain had once shot its sparkling drops into the
  summer air. Several alleys, too, cut in the young plantations, had apparently
  converged at this spot; and although these were much overgrown and neglected,
  one still formed, so to speak, a broad white street of turf, hemmed in by
  walls of quivering foliage, dark and massive, but sprinkled here and there
  with points of silver in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>Mariamne crept closer to her companion's side.</p>

  <p>"I feel so safe and so happy with you," said she caressingly. "We seem to
  have changed places. You are the one who is now anxious and&mdash;no, not
  frightened but&mdash;ill at ease. Esca! what is it?" she asked with a start,
  as, looking fondly up in his face, she caught its expression of actual terror
  and dismay.</p>

  <p>His blue eyes were fixed like stone. With parted lips and rigid features,
  his whole being seemed concentrated into the one effort of seeing, and backed
  by the dark shadows of the cypress, his face, usually so frank and fearless,
  was paler even than her own. Following with her eyes the direction of his
  glance, she, too, was something more than startled at what she saw. Two black
  figures, clad in long and trailing garments, moved slowly into sight, and
  crossed the sheet of moonlight which flooded the wide avenue, with solemn
  step and slow. These again were followed by two in white, looking none the
  less ghostly that their outlines were so indistinctly defined, the head and
  feet being alone visible, and the rest of the figure wrapped, as it were, in
  mist. Then came two more in black, and thus in alternate pairs the unearthly
  procession glided by; only, ere the half of it had passed, a something, not
  unlike the human form, draped in a white robe, seemed to float horizontally,
  at a cubit's height, above the line. A low and wailing chant, too, rose and
  fell fitfully on the listeners' ears. It was the " Kyrie Eleison," the humble
  plaintive dirge in which the Christian mourned, not without hope, for his
  dead.</p>

  <p>Fear was no familiar sentiment in Esca's breast. It could not remain there
  long. He drew himself up, and the colour rushed back redly to his brow.</p>

  <p>"They are spirits!" said he; "spirits of the wood, on whose domains we
  have trespassed. Good or evil, we will resist them to the last. They will
  sacrifice us to their vengeance if we show the least signs of fear."</p>

  <p>She was proud of his courage even then&mdash;the courage that could defy,
  though it had not been able to shake off, the superstitions of his northern
  birthplace. It was sweet, too, to think that from her lips he must learn what
  was truth, both of this world and of the next.</p>

  <p>"They are no spirits!" she answered. "They are Christians burying their
  dead. Esca, we shall be safe with them, and they will show us how to leave
  this place unobserved."</p>

  <p>"Christians?" he replied doubtfully; "and we, too, are Christians, are we
  not? I would they were armed, though," he added reflectively. "With twenty
  good swordsmen, I would engage to take you unmolested from one end of Rome to
  the other; but these, I fear, are only priests. Priests! and the legions are
  loose even now all over the city!"</p>

  <p>He was but a young disciple, thought his loving teacher, and many a defeat
  must be experienced, many a rebuff sustained, ere dependence on his own
  courage is rooted out of a brave man's heart, to be replaced by that nobler
  fortitude which relies solely on the will of Heaven. Yet a brave man is no
  bad material out of which to form a good one.</p>

  <p>They left their hiding-place, and hastened down the alley after the
  departing Christians. In a secluded place, where the remaining trees grew
  thickest and most luxuriant where the noontide ray had least power to
  penetrate, the procession had halted. The grave was already being dug. As
  spadeful after spadeful of loose earth fell with a dull grating sound on the
  sward, or trickled back into the cavity, the dirge wailed on, now lowered and
  repressed like the stifled sob of one who weeps in secret, now rising into
  notes of chastened triumph, that were almost akin to joy. And here, where
  Maecenas, and his poets and his parasites, had met, with garland and goblet,
  to while away the summer's day in frivolous disputations, arguing on the
  endless topics of here and hereafter, life and death, body and soul; groping
  blindly and in vain throughout the labyrinth for a clue sneering at
  Pythagoras, refuting Plato, and maligning Socrates the body of the dead
  Christian was laid humbly and trustfully in the earth, and already the
  departed spirit had learned the efficacy of those truths it had imbibed
  through scorn and suffering in its lifetime truths that the heathen sages
  would have given goblets and garlands, and riches and empire, and all the
  world besides, but to know and believe in that supreme moment, when all
  around the dying fades and fails as though it had never been, and there is
  but one reality from which is no escape.</p>

  <p>The Jewess and her champion waited a few paces off while the spade threw
  its last handfuls to the surface. Then the Christians gathered solemnly and
  silently round the open grave, and the corpse was lowered gently into its
  resting-place, and the faces that watched it sink, and stop, and waver, and
  sink again out of sight, even like the life of the departed, beamed with a
  holy triumph, for they knew that with this wayfarer, at least, the journey
  was over and the home attained. Two mourners, somewhat conspicuous from the
  rest, stood at either end of the grave. The one was a woman, still in the
  meridian of her beauty; the other a strong warlike man, scarcely of middle
  age. The woman's face was turned to heaven, rapt, as it seemed in an ecstasy
  of prayer. She was not thinking of the poor remains, the empty shell,
  consigned beneath her feet to its kindred dust; but with the eye of faith she
  watched the spirit in its upward flight, and for her the heavens were opened,
  and her child was even now disappearing through the golden gate. But on the
  man's contracted features might be read the pain of him who is too weak to
  bear, and yet too strong to weep. His eye followed with sad wistful glances
  clod after clod, as they fell in to cover up the loved and lost. When the
  earth was flattened down above her head, and not till then, he seemed to look
  inquiringly at the vacant space amongst the bystanders, and to know that she
  was gone. He clenched his strong hands tight, and raised his eyes at last.
  "It is hard to bear," he muttered; "it is very hard to say, 'Thy will be
  done.'" Then he thought of the empty place at home, and hid his face and
  wept.</p>

  <p>A young girl, on the verge of womanhood, had been called away called
  suddenly away the pride and the flower and the darling of her father's house.
  He was a good man and a brave, and a believer, yet every time his child's
  face rose up before him, with its bright hair and its loving eyes, something
  smote him, sharp and cold, like the thrust of a knife.</p>

  <p>When the grave was finally closed, the Christians gathered round it in
  prayer. Mariamne, taking Esca by the hand, came silently among them, and
  joined in their devotions. It was a strange and solemn sight to the
  barbarian. A circle of cloaked figures kneeling round an empty space, to
  worship an unseen power. On either hand a wilderness of ruin and devastation
  in the heart of a great city; above, an angry glare on the midnight sky, and
  the shouts of maddened combatants rising and falling on the breeze. By his
  side, the woman he loved so dearly, and whom he had thought he should never
  look on again. He knelt with the others, to offer his tribute from a grateful
  heart. Their prayers were short and fervent, nor did they omit the form their
  Master had given them expressly for their use. When they rose to their feet,
  one figure stood forth amongst the rest, and signed for silence with uplifted
  hand. This man was obviously a Roman by birth, and spoke his language with
  the ease, but at the same time with the accent and phrases of the lowest
  plebeian class. He seemed a handicraftsman by trade, and his palm, when he
  raised it impressively to bespeak attention, was hardened and scarred with
  toil. Low of stature, mean in appearance, coarsely clothed, with bare head
  and feet, there was little in his exterior to command interest or respect;
  but his frame, square and strongly built, seemed capable of sustaining a vast
  amount of toil or hardship, while his face, notwithstanding its plain
  features, denoted repressed enthusiasm, earnest purpose, and honest
  singleness of heart. He was indeed one of the pioneers of a religion,
  destined hereafter to cover the surface of the earth. Such were the men who
  went forth in their Master's name, without scrip or sandals, or change of
  raiment, to overrun and conquer the world who took no thought what they
  should say when brought before the kings, and governors, and great ones of
  the earth, trusting only in the sanctity of their mission, and the
  inspiration under which they spoke. Having little learning, they could refute
  the wisest philosophers. Having neither rank nor lineage, they could beard
  the Proconsul on his judgment-seat or the Caesar on his throne. Homely and
  ignorant, they feared not to wander far and wide through strange countries,
  and hostile nations, spreading the good tidings with a simple ungrudging
  faith that forced men to believe. Weak by nature it may be, and timid by
  education, they descended into the arena to meet their martyrdom from the
  hungry lion, with a quiet fortitude such as neither soldier nor gladiator had
  courage to display. It was a moral their Master never ceased to inculcate,
  that His was a message sent not to the noble, and the prosperous, and the
  distinguished, for these, if they wished to find Him, might make their own
  opportunities to seek Him out; but to the poor and lowly, the humble and
  forlorn, especially to those who were in distress and sorrow, who, having
  none to help them here, might rely all the more implicitly on His protection,
  who is emphatically the friend of the friendless.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the men who did His work seem to have been chosen principally
  from the humbler classes of society, from such as could speak to the
  multitude in homely phrases and with familiar imagery; whose authority the
  most careless and unthinking might perceive originated in no aid of
  extraneous circumstances, but came directly from above.</p>

  <p>As the speaker warmed to his subject, Esca could not but observe the
  change that came over the bearing and appearance of his outward man. At first
  the eye was dull, the speech hesitating, the manner diffident Gradually a
  light seemed to steal over his whole countenance, his form towered erect as
  though it had actually increased in stature, his words flowed freely in a
  torrent of glowing and appropriate language, his action became dignified, and
  the whole man clothed himself, as it were, in the majesty of the subject on
  which he spoke.</p>

  <p>That subject was indeed simple enough, sad, it may be, from an earthly
  point of view, and yet how comforting to the mourners gathered round him
  beside the new-made grave! At first he contented himself with a short and
  earnest tribute, clothed in the plainest form of speech, to the worth and
  endearing qualities of that young girl whom they had just laid in the earth.
  "She was precious to us all," said he. "yet words like these seem but a
  mockery to some present here, for whom she was the hope and the joy, and the
  very light of an earthly home. Grieve, I say, and weep, and wring your hands,
  for such is man's weak nature, and He who took our nature upon Him
  sympathises with our sorrows, and, like the good physician, pities while He
  heals. To-day your wounds are fresh, your hearts are full, your eyes are
  blind with tears, you cannot see the truth. To-morrow you will wonder why you
  mourn so bitterly; to-morrow you will say, 'It is well; we are labouring in
  the sun, she is resting in the shade; we are hungry and thirsty in a barren
  land, she is eating the bread and drinking the waters of life, in the garden
  of Paradise; we are weary and footsore, wayfarers still upon the road, but
  she has reached her home.'</p>

  <p>"Yea, now at this very hour, standing here where the earth has just closed
  over the young face, tender and delicate even in death, would you have her
  back to you if you could? Those who have considered but the troubles that
  surround us now, and to whom there is no hereafter, who call themselves
  philosophers, and whose wisdom is as the wisdom of a blind man walking on the
  brink of a precipice, have themselves said 'whom the gods love die young';
  and will you grudge that your beloved one should have been called out of the
  vineyard, to take her wages and go to her rest, before the burden and heat of
  the day? Think what her end might have been. Think that you might have
  offered her up to bear witness to the truth, tied to a stake in the foul
  arena, face to face with the crouching wild beast gathered for his spring.
  Ay! and worse even than this might have befallen the child, whom you
  remember, as it were but yesterday, nestling to her mother's bosom, or
  clinging round her father's knees! 'The Christians to the panther, and the
  maidens to the pandar!'* You have heard the brutal shouts and shuddered with
  fear and anger while you heard. And&mdash;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>"Christiani ad leones! virgines ad lenones!"</i> a
  sentence that found no small favour with the Roman crowd. ]</p>

  <p>you would have offered her, as Abraham offered Isaac, beating your
  breasts, and holding your breath for very agony the while. But is it not
  better thus? She has earned the day's wages, labouring but for an hour at
  sunrise; she has escaped the cross, and yet has won the crown!</p>

  <p>"But you who hear me, envy not this young maiden, though she be now
  arrived where all so long to go. Rather be proud and happy, that your Master
  cannot spare you, that He has yet work for you to do. To every man's hand is
  set his appointed task, and every man shall find strength given him to fulfil
  it when the time arrives. Some of you will bear witness before Caesar, and
  for such the scourges are already knotted and the cross is reared; but to
  these I need scarcely speak of loyalty, for to them the very suffering brings
  with it its own fortitude, and they are indeed blessed who are esteemed
  worthy of the glory of martyrdom! Some must go forth to preach the gospel in
  wild and distant lands; and well I know that neither toil, nor hardship, nor
  peril, will cause them to waver an hair's-breadth from their path, yet have
  they difficulties to meet, and foes to contend with, that they know not of.
  Let them beware of pride and self-sufficiency, lest, in raising the altar,
  they make the sacrifice of more account than the spirit in which it is
  offered; lest in building the church they take note of every stone in the
  edifice, and lose sight of the purpose for which it was reared. But ye cannot
  all be martyrs, nor preachers, nor prophets, nor chief-priests, yet every one
  of you, even the weakest and the lowest here present&mdash;woman, child,
  slave, or barbarian&mdash; is none the less a soldier and a servant of the
  cross! Every one has his duty to do, his watch to keep, his enemy to conquer.
  It is not much that is required of you little indeed in comparison with all
  you have received&mdash;but that little must be given without reserve, and
  with the whole heart. Has any one of you left a duty unfulfilled? when he
  departs from hence let him go home and accomplish it. Has any one an enemy?
  let him be reconciled. Has he done his brother a wrong? let him make amends.
  Has he sustained an injury? let him forgive it. Even as you have laid in the
  grave the perishable body of the departed, so lay down here every earthly
  weakness, every unholy wish, and every evil thought. Nay, as these chief
  mourners have to-night parted and weaned themselves from that which they
  loved best on earth, so must you tear out and cast away from you the truest
  and dearest affections that stand between you and your service, ay, even
  though you rend them from the very inner chambers of your heart. And then,
  with constant effort and never-ceasing prayer, striving, step by step, and
  winning, inch by inch, now slipping back it may be where the path is
  treacherous, and the hill is steep, to rise from your knees, humbled and
  therefore stronger, gaining more than you have lost, you shall arrive at
  last, where there is no strife, and no failing, where she for whom you weep
  to-night is even now in glory, where He whom you follow has already prepared
  a place for you, and where you who have loved and trusted, shall be happy for
  evermore!"</p>

  <p>Ceasing, he spread his hands abroad, and implored a blessing on those who
  heard him, after which the Christians breaking up their circle, gathered
  round the bereaved parents with a few quiet words and gestures of sympathy,
  such as those offer who have themselves experienced the sorrows they are fain
  to assuage.</p>

  <p>"I am in safety here," whispered Mariamne to the Briton, as she pointed
  out a dark figure, with white flowing locks, whom he now recognised as
  Calchas. In another moment she was in the old man's arms, who raised his eyes
  to heaven, and thanked God with heartfelt gratitude for her deliverance.</p>

  <p>"Your father and I," said he, "have sought you with fearful anxiety, and
  even now he is raising some of his countrymen to storm the tribune's house,
  and take you from it with the strong hand. Mariamne, you hardly know how much
  your father loves his child. And I too was disturbed for your safety, but I
  trusted&mdash;trusted in that Heaven which never fails the innocent.
  Nevertheless, I sought for aid among my brethren, and they have raised, even
  the poorest of them, such a sum as would have tempted the praetor to
  interfere, even against a man like Placidus. I did but remain with them to
  say a prayer while they buried their dead. But now you are safe, and you will
  come back with me to your father's house, and one of these whom I can trust
  shall go to tell him at the place where his friends were to assemble; and
  Esca, thy preserver for the second time, who is to me as a son, shall
  accompany us home though we shall not need a guard, for thy father's friends,
  tried warriors every man, and armed, will meet us ere we leave the wilderness
  for the streets."</p>

  <p>It was a strong temptation to the Briton, but the words he had so lately
  heard had sunk deep into his heart. He, too, would fain cast in his lot
  amongst these earnest men. He, too, he thought, had a task to perform&mdash;a
  cherished happiness to forego. With a timely warning, it might be in his
  power to save the Emperor's life, and his very eagerness to accompany
  Mariamne but impressed him the more with the conviction that it was his duty
  to leave her, now she was in comparative safety, and hasten on his errand of
  mercy. Calchas, too, insisted strongly on this view, and though Mariamne was
  silent, and even pleaded with her eyes against the risk, he turned stoutly
  from their influence, and ere she was clasped in her father's arms, the new
  Christian was already half-way between the Esquiline and the palace of
  Caesar.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-15"
     id="ch2-15">XV</a>. &mdash; REDIVIVUS</h2>

  <p class="first">MANY had been the debauch at which, himself its chief
  originator and promoter, the tribune had assisted; nor had he escaped the
  penalties that Nature exacts even from the healthiest constitutions, when her
  laws are habitually outraged in the high-tide of revelry and mirth; but
  never, after his longest sittings with the Emperor, had he experienced
  anything to compare with the utter prostration of mind and body in which he
  came to himself, waking from the deathlike sleep that followed his pledge to
  Valeria. With returning consciousness came a sense of painful giddiness,
  which, as the velvet cushions of the couch rose and heaved beneath his sight,
  confused him utterly as to where he was, or how he got there; then, sitting
  up with an effort that seemed to roll a ball of lead across his brain, he was
  aware that every vein throbbed at fever-heat, that his hands were numbed and
  swollen, that his mouth was parched, his lips cracked, and that he had a
  racking headache the latter symptom was sufficiently familiar to be
  reassuring; he sprang to his feet, regardless of the pang so sudden a
  movement shot through his frame, then seizing a goblet from the table, filled
  it to the brim with Falernian, and in defiance of the nausea with which its
  very fragrance overpowered him, emptied it to the dregs. The effect, as he
  expected, was instantaneous; it enabled him to stand erect, and, passing his
  hand across his brow, by a strong effort of the will, he forced himself to
  connect and comprehend the events that had led to this horrible and
  bewildering trance. By degrees, one after another, like links in a chain, he
  traced the doings of the day, beginning a long way back, somewhere about
  noon, till the immediate past, so to speak, came more and more tangibly
  within his grasp. It was with a thrill of triumphant pleasure that he
  remembered Valeria's visit, and his own arm winding round her handsome form
  on that very couch. Where was she now? He looked about him vacantly, almost
  expecting to find her in the room; as he did so, his eye lighted on the two
  goblets, one of them half-emptied, still standing on their salver.</p>

  <p>To say that Placidus had a conscience would be simply a perversion of
  terms; for that monitor, never very troublesome, had since his manhood been
  so stifled and silenced as to have become a mere negative quality, yet in his
  present unhinged state, a shudder of horror did come over him, as he recalled
  the visit to Petosiris, and the poison with which he had resolved to ensure
  the silence of his slave. But ere that shudder passed away, the dark secret
  Esca knew, the plot from which it was now too late to draw back, the
  desperate adventure that every hour brought nearer, and that must be
  attempted to-night&mdash;all these considerations came flooding in on his
  memory at once, and for a moment he felt paralysed by the height of the
  precipice on the brink of which he stood. With the emergency, however, as was
  always the case in the tribune's character, came the energy required to
  encounter it. "At least," he muttered, steadying himself by the table with
  one hand. "the cup is nearly empty; the drug cannot but have done its work.
  First, I must make sure of the carrion, and then it will be time enough to
  find Valeria." Had he suffered less in body, he would have laughed his own
  low malicious laugh, to think how deftly he had outwitted the woman he
  professed to love. The laugh, however, died away in a grin that betrayed more
  pain than mirth; and the tribune, with chattering teeth and shaking frame,
  and wavering uncertain steps, betook himself to the outer court to make sure
  with his own eyes that the stalwart frame of him whom he feared was stiff and
  cold in death.</p>

  <p>His first feeling would have been one of acute apprehension, had not anger
  so completely mastered that sensation, when he perceived the slave's chain
  and collar lying coiled on the pavement. Obviously, Esca had escaped; and was
  gone, moreover, with his late master's life completely in his power; but
  Placidus possessed a keen intellect and one familiar with sudden
  combinations; it flashed upon him at once, that he had been outwitted by
  Valeria, and the two had fled together.</p>

  <p>The sting was very sharp, but it roused and sobered him. Pacing swiftly
  back through the corridors, and stopping for a few minutes to immerse his
  head and face in cold water, he returned to the banqueting-hall, and eagerly
  scrutinised with look and smell, and, notwithstanding all that had happened,
  even with a sparing taste, the cup from which he had last drunk. The opiate,
  however, had been so skilfully prepared that nothing suspicious could be
  detected in the flavour of the wine; nevertheless, reflecting on all the
  circumstances with a clearer head, as the strength of his constitution
  gradually asserted itself, he arrived at the true conclusion, and was
  satisfied that Valeria had changed the cups while his attention was
  distracted by her charms; that he had purchased a poison he never doubted for
  a moment, nor suspected that Petosiris could have dared, from sheer love of
  trickery, to substitute an opiate for the deadlier draught; but he exulted to
  think that his powerful organisation must have resisted its effects, and that
  he who had so often narrowly escaped death in the field must indeed bear a
  charmed life. If a suspicion haunted him that the venom might still be
  lurking in his system, to do its work more completely after a short respite,
  the vague horror of such a thought did but goad him to make use of the
  intervening time all the more ardently for business and pleasure, not
  forgetting the sacred duty of revenge. <i>Dum vivimus vivamus!</i> was the
  tribune's motto, and if he had been granted but one hour to live, he would
  have divided that hour systematically, between the delights of love, wine,
  and mischief.</p>

  <p>Rapidly, though coolly, he reviewed his position, as though he had been
  commanding a cohort hemmed in by the Jewish army. To-night would make or mar
  him. The gladiators would be here within an hour. Esca must, ere this, have
  reached the palace and given the alarm. Why had a centurion of Caesar not yet
  arrived with a sufficient guard to arrest him in his own house? They might be
  expected at any moment. Should he fly while there was yet time? What! and
  lose the brilliant future so nearly within his reach? No&mdash;he would
  weather this as he had weathered other storms, by skilful and judicious
  steering. A man who has no scruples need never be deficient in resource. To
  leave his house now, would be a tacit admission of guilt. To be found alone,
  undefended, unsuspicious, a strong presumption of innocence. He would at
  least have sufficient interest to be taken into the presence of Caesar.
  There, what so easy as to accuse the slave of treachery, to persuade the
  Emperor the barbarian had but hatched a plot against his master's life; to
  make the good-humoured old glutton laugh with an account of the drugged
  goblet, and finish the night by a debauch with his imperial host?</p>

  <p>Then, he must be guided by the preparations for defence which he observed
  in the palace. If they were weak, he must find some means of communicating
  with Hippias, and the attack would be facilitated by his own presence inside.
  If, on the contrary, there was an obvious intention of firm resistance, the
  conspirators must be warned to postpone their enterprise. If worst came to
  the worst, he could always save his own head by informing against his
  confederates, and so handing over Hippias and the gladiators to death.</p>

  <p>Some slight compunction visited him at the thought of such an alternative,
  but he soon stifled it with the arguments of his characteristic philosophy.
  Should he be found, indeed, presiding at a supper-party composed of these
  desperate men, they might defend the gate whilst he fled directly to Caesar,
  and sacrificed them at once. Under any circumstances, he argued, he had
  bought them, and had a right to make use of them.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Mariamne would be here directly. She ought to have been
  here long ago. Whatever the future threatened, an hour, half an hour, a
  quarter, should be devoted to her society, and after that, come what might,
  at least he would not have been foiled in every event of the day. It was when
  he had arrived at this conclusion, that Esca, from his hiding-place saw the
  figure of the tribune, pale, wan, and ghostly, giving directions for the
  preparation of the supper-table.</p>

  <p>The evening stole on, the sun-dial no longer showed the hour, and the
  slave whose duty it was to keep count of time by the water-clock* then in
  vogue, announced that the first watch of the night was already advanced. He
  was followed by Automedon, who came into the presence of his master, with
  hanging head and sheepish looks, sadly mistrusting how far his own favour
  would bear him harmless in the delivery of the tidings he had to impart. It
  was always a perilous duty to inform Placidus of the failure of any of his
  schemes. He listened, indeed, with a calm demeanour and an unmoved
  countenance, but sooner or later he surely contrived to visit on the
  unfortunate messenger the annoyance he himself experienced from the
  message.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The clepsydra, or water-clock&mdash;a Greek invention
  for the division of time&mdash; consisting of a hollow globe made of glass,
  or some transparent substance, from which the water trickled out through a
  narrow orifice, in quantities so regulated, that the sinking level of the
  element marked with sufficient exactitude the time that had elapsed since the
  vessel was filled. ]</p>

  <p>The tribune's face brightened as the boy came into the hall; with
  characteristic duplicity, however, he veiled even from his charioteer the
  impatience in which he had waited his return.</p>

  <p>"Have you brought the horses in cool?" said he, with an affectation of
  extreme indifference.</p>

  <p>Automedon looked greatly relieved.</p>

  <p>"Quite cool," he answered. "most illustrious! and Oarses came part of the
  way home, but he got down near the Sacred Gate, and I had no one with me in
  the chariot the whole length of the Flaminian Way; and the slaves will be
  back presently; and Damasippus&mdash;Oh! my lord, do not be angry!&mdash;
  Damasippus&mdash;I fear I have left him dead in the street."</p>

  <p>Here the lad's courage failed him completely; he had indeed been
  thoroughly frightened by the events of the night; and making a piteous face,
  he twined his fingers in his long curls and wept aloud.</p>

  <p>"What, fool!" thundered the tribune, his brow turning black with rage.
  "You have not brought her after all! Silly child," he added, controlling
  himself with a strong effort. "Where is the&mdash;the passenger&mdash;I
  charged Damasippus to bring here with him to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you the truth," exclaimed the boy, flinging himself down on
  his knees, and snatching at the hem of his master's garment. "By the Temple
  of Vesta, I will tell you the truth. I drove from here across Tiber, and I
  waited in the shadow by Tiber-side; and Jugurtha wouldn't stand still, and
  presently Damasippus brought a&mdash;a passenger in his arms, and put it into
  the chariot, and bade me go on fast; and we went on at a gallop till we tried
  to cross the Appian Way, and then we had to turn aside, for the houses were
  burning and the people fighting in the street, and Scipio was frightened and
  pulled, and Jugurtha wouldn't face the crowd, and I drove on to cross a
  little farther down, but we were stopped again by the Vestals, and I couldn't
  drive through them! So we halted to let them pass, and then a fierce terrible
  giant caught the horses and stopped them once more, and a thousand soldiers,
  nay, a legion at least, surrounded the chariot, and they killed Damasippus,
  and they tore the passenger out, and killed it too, and Scipio kicked, and I
  was frightened, and drove home as fast as I could&mdash;and indeed it wasn't
  my fault!"</p>

  <p>Automedon's fears had magnified both the number of the assailants and the
  dangers undergone. He had not recognised the gladiators, and was altogether
  in too confused a state, as the tribune perceived at a glance, to afford his
  master any more coherent information than the foregoing. Placidus bit his lip
  in baffled anger, for he could not see his way; nevertheless the
  boy-charioteer was a favourite, and he would not visit the failure of the
  enterprise on him.</p>

  <p>"I am glad the horses are safe," said he good-humouredly. "Go, get some
  supper and a cup of wine. I will send for you again presently."</p>

  <p>Automedon, agreeably surprised, glanced up at his master's face ere he
  departed, and observed that, although deadly pale, it had assumed the fixed
  resolute expression his dependants knew so well.</p>

  <p>Placidus had indeed occasion to summon all the presence of mind on which
  he prided himself, for even while he spoke, his quick ear caught the tramp of
  feet, and the familiar clink of steel. The blood gathered round his heart as
  he contemplated the possibility that a maniple of Caesar's guards might even
  now be occupying the court. It was with a sigh of intense relief that,
  instead of the centurion's eagle crest, he recognised the tall form of Rufus,
  accompanied by his comrades, advancing respectfully, and even with awkward
  diffidence, through the outer hall. The tribune could assume&mdash; none
  better&mdash;any character it suited him to play at a moment's notice;
  nevertheless there was a ring of real cordiality in his greeting, for the
  visitors were more welcome than they guessed.</p>

  <p>"Hail! Rufus, Lutorius, Eumolpus!" he shouted boisterously. "Gallant
  swordsmen and deep drinkers all! What! old Hirpinus, do I not see thy broad
  shoulders yonder in the rear? and Hippias too, the king of the arena!
  Welcome, every man of you! Even now the feast is spread, and the Chian
  cooling yonder amongst the flowers. Once again, a hearty welcome to you
  all!"</p>

  <p>The gladiators, still somewhat abashed by the unaccustomed splendour which
  met their eyes on every side, responded with less than their usual confidence
  to their entertainer. Rufus nudged Lutorius to reply in polite language, and
  the Gaul, in a fit of unusual modesty, passed the signal on to Eumolpus of
  Ravenna&mdash;a beetle-browed, bow-legged warrior, with huge muscles and a
  heavy, sullen face. This champion looked helplessly about him and seemed
  inclined to turn tail and fly, when, to his great relief, Hippias advanced
  from the rear of his comrades, and created a diversion in his favour, of
  which he availed himself by slinking incontinently into the background.
  Placidus clapped his hands, an Asiatic fashion affected by the more luxurious
  Romans; and two or three slaves appeared in obedience to the summons. The
  gladiators looked on in awe at the sumptuous dresses and personal beauty of
  these domestics.</p>

  <p>"Hand round wine here amongst my friends. I will but say three words to
  your captain, and we will go to supper forthwith."</p>

  <p>So speaking, the tribune led Hippias apart, having resolved that in the
  present critical state of affairs it would be better to take him entirely
  into his confidence, and trust to the scrupulous notions of fidelity to their
  bargains, which such men entertained, for the result</p>

  <p>"There is no time to lose," observed he anxiously, when he had led Hippias
  apart from his followers. "Something has occurred which was out of all our
  calculations. Can they overhear us, think ye?"</p>

  <p>The fencing-master glanced carelessly at his band. "Whilst they are at
  <i>that</i> game," said he. "they would not hear the assembly sounding from
  all four quarters of the camp. Never fear, illustrious! it will keep them
  busy till supper time."</p>

  <p>The band had broken up into pairs, and were hard at work with their
  favourite pastime, old as the Alban hills, and handed down to the Roman
  Empire from the dynasty of the Pharaohs. It consisted in gambling for small
  coins at the following trial of skill:&mdash;the players sat or stood, face
  to face; each held the left hand erect, on which he marked the progress of
  his game. With the right he shot out any one or more of his four fingers and
  thumb, or all together, with immense rapidity, guessing aloud at the same
  time the sum-total of the fingers thus brandished by himself and his
  adversary, who was employed in the same manner. Whoever guessed right won a
  point, which was immediately marked on the left, held immovable at
  shoulder-height for the purpose, and when five of these had been won the game
  began again. Nothing could be more simple, nothing apparently less
  interesting, and yet it seemed to engross the attention of the gladiators to
  the exclusion of all other subjects, even the prospect of supper and the
  flavour of the Falernian.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This game is played to-day with equal zest, under its
  Italian name of "Morro." Perhaps its nature was best rendered by the Latin
  phrase <i>micare digitos</i>, "to flash the fingers." ]</p>

  <p>"They are children now," said Placidus contemptuously. "They will be men
  presently, and tigers to-night. Hippias, the slave has escaped. We must
  attack the palace forthwith."</p>

  <p>"I know it," replied the other quietly. "But the Germans are relieving
  guard at this hour. My own people are hardly ready, and it is not dark enough
  yet."</p>

  <p>"You know it," repeated Placidus, even more irritated than astonished by
  his companion's coolness. "you <i>know</i> it, and yet you have not hastened
  your preparations? Do you know, too, that this yellow-haired barbarian has
  got your head, and mine, and all the empty skulls of our intelligent friends
  who are amusing themselves yonder, under his belt? Do you know that Caesar,
  true to his swinish propensities, will turn like a hunted boar, when he
  suspects the least shadow of danger? Do you know that not one of us may live
  to eat the very supper waiting for us in the next room? What are you made of,
  man, that you can thus look me so coolly in the face with the sword at both
  our throats?"</p>

  <p>"I can keep my own throat with my hand," replied the other, totally
  unmoved by his host's agitation. "And I am certainly not accustomed to fear
  danger before it comes. But that the barbarian has escaped I saw with my own
  eyes, for I left him ten minutes since within a hundred paces of your own
  gate."</p>

  <p>The tribune's eyebrows went up in unfeigned surprise.</p>

  <p>"Then he has not reached the palace!" he exclaimed, speaking rather to
  himself than his informant.</p>

  <p>"Not reached the palace certainly," replied the latter calmly. "since I
  tell you I saw him here. And in very good company too," he added with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>The tribune's astonishment had for once deprived him of his self-
  command.</p>

  <p>"With Valeria?" he asked unguardedly; and directly he had spoken, a vague
  suspicion made him wish that he had held his tongue.</p>

  <p>The fencing-master started and knit his brows. His head was more erect and
  his voice sterner when he answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have seen the lady Valeria too, within the last hour. She had no slaves
  with her beyond her usual attendants."</p>

  <p>Anger, curiosity, uncertainty, jealousy, a hundred conflicting emotions
  were rankling at the tribune's heart. What had this handsome gladiator to do
  at Valeria's house? and was it possible that she did not care for the slave
  after all? Then what could have been her object throughout? He marked too the
  alteration in manner betrayed by Hippias at the mention of this fair and
  flighty dame; nor did it seem improbable under all the circumstances that he
  entertained a kindly feeling, if nothing more, for his pupil. Judging men and
  women by his own evil nature, and knowing well the favour with which their
  female admirers regarded these votaries of the sword, the tribune did not
  hesitate to put its true construction on such kindly feelings, and their
  probable result. From that moment he hated Hippias&mdash;hated him all the
  more that in the tumult and confusion of the coming night he might find an
  opportunity of gratifying his hatred by the destruction of the gladiator.
  Many a bold leader has been struck down from behind by the very followers he
  was encouraging; and who would ask how a conspirator met his death, in the
  attack on a palace and the murder of an emperor? Even while the thought
  crossed his mind he took the other by the hand, and laughed frankly in his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Thou art at home in the private apartments of every lady in Rome, I
  believe, my warlike Apollo," said he. "But, indeed, it is no question now of
  such trifling; the business of to-night must be determined on&mdash;ay, and
  disposed of&mdash; without delay. If my slave had reached the palace our
  whole plan must have been altered. I wish, as you did come across him, you
  had treated him to that deadly thrust of yours under the short-ribs, and
  brought him in here dead or alive."</p>

  <p>"He will not trouble us," observed the other coolly. "Take my word for it,
  tribune, he is disposed of for the present."</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" asked Placidus, a devilish joy lighting up his sallow
  face. "Did you bribe him to secrecy then and there with the metal you are
  accustomed to lavish so freely? Gold will buy silence for a time, but steel
  ensures it for ever."</p>

  <p>"Nay, tribune," answered Hippias, with a frank laugh. "We have been
  fencing too long in the dark. I will tell you the whole truth. This young
  giant of yours is safe enough for the present. I saw him depart with a
  pale-faced girl, in a black hood, whom he promised to take care of as far as
  Tiber-side. Depend upon it, he will think of nothing else tonight. For all
  his broad shoulders the down is yet upon his chin. And a man's beard must be
  grey before he leaves such a fair young lass as that to knock his head
  against a wall, even though it be the wall of a palace. No, no, tribune, he
  is safe enough, I tell you, for the next twelve hours, at least!"</p>

  <p>"A pale-faced girl?" repeated Placidus, still harping on Valeria. "What
  and who was she? Did you know her? did you speak to her?"</p>

  <p>"My people had some wild tale," replied the fencing-master. "about a
  chariot with white horses, that had been upset in the street, and a girl all
  gagged and muffled, whom they pulled out of it, and for whom, of course, they
  quarrelled amongst themselves. In faith, had it not been for to-night's
  business and the oath, you might have seen some sweet practice in your own
  porch, for I have two or three here that can make as close and even work with
  a sword as a tailor does with his needle. They said something about her being
  a Jewess. Very likely she may be, for they swam across Tiber since we have
  lost Nero. And the lad might as well be a Jew as a Briton for that matter.
  Are you satisfied now, tribune? By the belly of Bacchus, I must wash my mouth
  out with Falernian! All this talking makes a man as thirsty as a camel."</p>

  <p>Satisfied! and after what he had just learnt! Chariot! White horses!
  Jewess! There could be no doubt of it. These gladiators must have blundered
  on her, thought the tribune, and slain my freedman, and rescued her from my
  people, and handed her over to the man whom most I hate and fear on earth.
  Satisfied! Perhaps I shall be better satisfied when I have captured her, and
  humbled Valeria, and put <i>you</i> out of the way, my gallant cut-throat,
  and seen the slave scourged to death at my own doorpost! Then, and not till
  then, shall I be able to drink my wine without a heartburn, and lay my head
  on the pillow with some chance of sleep. In the meantime, to-night's work
  must be done. To-night's work, that puts Vespasian virtually on the throne
  (for this boy* of his shall only keep the cushion warm till his father takes
  his seat), that makes Placidus the first man in the empire. Nay, that might
  even open a path to the purple itself. The general is well advanced in years;
  already somewhat broken and worn with his campaigns. Titus, indeed, is the
  darling of the legions, but all the heart black-browed Berenice has left him,
  is wrapped up in war. He loves it, I verily believe&mdash;the daring
  fool!&mdash;for the mere braying of trumpets, and the clash of steel. Not a
  centurion exposes himself half so freely, nor so often. Well, a Zealot's
  javelin, or a stone from the ramparts of some nameless town in Judaea, may
  dispose of him at any time. Then there is but Domitian&mdash;a clever youth
  indeed, and an unscrupulous. So much the worse for him! A mushroom is not the
  only dish that may be fatal to an emperor, and if the knot be so secure as to
  baffle all dexterity, why, it must be cut with steel. Ay, the Macedonian knew
  well how the great game should be played. Satisfied! Like him, I shall never
  be satisfied while there is anything more to win! These being the tribune's
  thoughts, it is needless to say that he assumed a manner of the utmost
  frankness and carelessness.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Domitian ]</p>

  <p>"Thirsty!" he repeated, in a loud voice, clapping Hippias on the shoulder.
  "Thirsty&mdash;I could empty an aqueduct! Welcome again, and heartily, my
  heroes all! See, the supper waits. Let us go in and drink out the old
  Falernian!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-16"
     id="ch2-16">XVI</a>. &mdash; "MORITURI"</h2>

  <p class="first">KNOWING well with whom he was to deal, Placidus had ordered
  a repast to be prepared for his guests on a scale of magnificence unusual
  even in his luxurious dwelling. It was advisable, not only to impose on these
  rude natures with unaccustomed pomp and parade, but also to excite their
  cupidity by the display of gold and jewels while their fiercer passions were
  inflamed with wine. The more reckless and desperate they could be rendered,
  the more fit would they be for his purpose. There were the tools, sharp and
  ready for use, but he thought they would admit of a yet finer edge, and
  prepared to put it on accordingly. Therefore, he had ordered the supper to be
  laid in an inner apartment, reserved for occasions of especial state, and in
  which it was whispered that Vitellius himself had more than once partaken of
  his subject's hospitality; nay, had even expressed gratification with his
  entertainment; and which, while blazing with as much of ornament and
  decoration as could be crowded into a supper-room, was of such moderate
  dimensions as to bring all the costly objects it contained within notice of
  the guests. The tesselated pavement was of the richest and gaudiest squares,
  laid together as smooth and bright as glass. The walls were of polished
  citron-wood, heavily gilded round the skirting and edges, while the panels
  were covered in the florid and gradually deteriorating taste of the period,
  with paintings, brilliant in colour, and beautiful in execution. These
  represented mythological subjects not of the purest nature, but fauns,
  nymphs, and satyrs were to be found in the majority, while Bacchus himself
  was more than once repeated in all the glory of his swaying paunch; his
  garland of vine-leaves, his ivy-covered wand, and surrounding clusters of
  rich, ripe, purple grapes. To fill the niches between these panels, the
  goat&mdash;an animal always associated in the Roman mind with wine, perhaps
  because he drinks no water&mdash;was imitated in precious metals, and in
  every attitude. Here they butted, there they browsed, in another corner a
  pair of them frisked and gambolled in living kid-like glee, while yonder,
  horned and bearded, a venerable sage in silver gazed upon the guests with a
  wise Arcadian simplicity that was almost ludicrous. The tables, which were
  removed with every change of dishes, were of cedar, supported on grotesque
  claws of bronze, heavily gilt; the couches, framed of ivory and gold, were
  draped in various coloured shawls of the softest Asiatic texture, and strewed
  with cushions of so rich a crimson as to border nearly on imperial purple. No
  dish was of a meaner metal than gold, and the drinking-cups, in which
  Falernian blushed, or Chian sparkled, were studded with rubies, emeralds,
  pearls, and other precious stones. The sharp nail of a gladiator might at any
  moment have picked out, unobserved, that which would have purchased his
  freedom and his life, but the men were honest, as they understood the term,
  and the gems were as safe here, and indeed a good deal safer, than they would
  have been in the temple of Vesta, or of the Capitoline Jove himself. In a
  recess at one end of the apartment, reared like an altar upon three wide low
  carpeted steps, from each of which censers exhaled aromatic odours, stood the
  sideboard of polished walnut, carved in exquisite imitation of birds,
  insects, reptiles, flowers, and fruit. This was covered by a snowy cloth, and
  on it glittered, richly chased and burnished, the tribune's store of golden
  cups and vases, which men quoted at every supper-table in Rome.</p>

  <p>Lutorius, reclining opposite this blaze of magnificence, shaded his eyes
  with his hand.</p>

  <p>"What is it, my bold Gaul?" asked his host, raising himself on his elbow
  to pledge him, and signing to a slave to fill the swordsman's cup. "Hast thou
  got thy guard up already to save thy face?"</p>

  <p>"They dazzle me, most illustrious!" answered the ready Gaul. "I had rather
  blink at the sunrise flashing on the blue waters from Ostia. I did not think
  there had been so much gold in Rome."</p>

  <p>"He has not seen the palace yet," said Placidus, laughing, as he emptied
  his cup and turned to the other guests. "Some of us will indeed be dazzled
  to-night, if I mistake not. What think ye, my friends, must be the plates and
  drinking-vessels where the very shields and helmets of the guards are solid
  gold? Meantime, let us wash our eyes with Falernian, lest we mistake our way
  and intrude on the privacy of Caesar in the dark."</p>

  <p>So appropriate a sentiment met with universal approval. The gladiators
  laughed loudly, and proffered their cups to be filled. There was no question
  now of secrecy or disguise; there was even no further affectation of ignoring
  the purpose for which they had met, or the probable result of the night's
  enterprise. Eumolpus, indeed, and one or two more of the thicker-witted,
  satisfied to know that the present moment brought a magnificent reception and
  an abundance of good cheer, were willing to remain in uncertainty about the
  future, resolving simply to obey the orders of their captain, and to ask no
  questions; but even these could not help learning by degrees that they had
  before them no work of ordinary bloodshed, but that they were involved in a
  conspiracy which was to determine the empire of the world. It did not destroy
  their appetite, though it may have increased their thirst.</p>

  <p>In proportion as the wine flowed faster the guests lost their diffidence
  and found their tongues. Their host exerted himself to win golden opinions
  from all, and entered with ready tact into the characteristics and
  peculiarities of each.</p>

  <p>"Eumolpus!" said he, as a slave entered bearing an enormous turbot on a
  yet larger dish. "fear not to encounter him. He is a worthy foe, and a
  countryman of thine own. He left Ravenna but yesterday. In truth, that fair-
  built town sends us the widest turbots and the broadest shoulders in the
  empire. Taste him, man, with a cup of Chian, and say if the trainer's rations
  have spoiled thy palate for native food."</p>

  <p>Half-brutalised as he was by nature and education, the gladiator had still
  a kindly feeling for his birthplace. Even now a memory of his boyhood would
  sometimes steal across him like a dream. The stretch of sand, the breezy
  Adriatic, the waves dashing against the harbour-walls, and a vision of curly-
  headed, black-eyed children, of whom he was one, tumbling and playing on the
  shore. He felt more human when he thought of such things. While the tribune
  spoke he rose in his own esteem; for his host treated him like a man rather
  than a beast; and those few careless words gained a champion for Placidus who
  was ready to follow him to the death.</p>

  <p>So was it with the rest. To Rufus he enlarged on the happiness of a
  country life, and the liberty none the less dear for being imaginary enjoyed
  by a Roman citizen, who, within easy distance of the capital, could sit
  beneath his own porch to watch the sunset crimsoning the Apennines, and tread
  into home-made wine the grapes of his own vineyard. He talked of pruning the
  elms and training the vines, of shearing sheep and goading oxen, as though he
  had been a rustic all his life, seasoning such glowing descriptions, to suit
  his listener's palate, with the charms even of winter in the snow amongst the
  hills&mdash;the boar driven through the leafless copse, the wild-fowl lured
  from the half-frozen lake, the snug and homely roof, the crackling fire, and
  the children playing on the hearth.</p>

  <p>"'Tis but another night-watch," said he cordially, "and it will be my turn
  to sup with thee in thy mountain-home. Half a dozen such strokes as I have
  seen thee deal in mere sport, my hero! and thou wilt never need to meddle
  with steel again, save in the form of a ploughshare or a hunting-spear. By
  the fillet of Ceres! my friends, there is a golden harvest to-night, only
  waiting for the sickle!"</p>

  <p>And Rufus, for whom a few acres of Italian soil, and liberty to cultivate
  them in peace, with his wife and children, comprised all of happiness that
  life could give, contemplated the prospect thus offered with an imagination
  heated by wine, and a determination, truly formidable in a man of his quiet,
  dogged resolution, if hard fighting was to count for anything, not to fail in
  at least deserving his reward.</p>

  <p>"Hirpinus!" exclaimed the host, turning to the veteran, who was a sworn
  lover of good cheer, and had already consumed supper enough for two ordinary
  men, washed down by proportionate draughts of wine. "thy favourite morsel is
  even now leaving the spit. Pledge me in Falernian ere it comes. Nay, spoil it
  not with honey, which I hold to be a mistake unworthy of a gladiator. We will
  pour a libation to Diana down our throats, in her capacity of huntress only,
  my friend; I care not for the goddess in any other. Ho! slaves! bring here
  some wild boars!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke the domestics reappeared, in pairs, carrying between them as
  many wild boars, roasted whole, as there were guests. One of these huge
  dishes was set aside for each man, and the carvers proceeded to their duty,
  unmoved by the ejaculations of amazement that broke from the gladiators at
  such prodigal magnificence.</p>

  <p>Their attention was, however, somewhat distracted at this stage of the
  feast by the entrance of Euchenor, who slunk to the place reserved for him
  with a shade of sullen disappointment lowering on his brow. The host,
  however, had resolved that nothing should occur to mar the success of his
  entertainment, so refrained from asking any questions as to his absence, and
  motioned him courteously to a couch, with as frank a greeting as though he
  had been aware of its cause. He suspected treachery notwithstanding, none the
  less that Euchenor hastened to explain his tardy arrival. "He had heard a
  tumult in the neighbourhood," he said. "whilst the guests were entering the
  house, and had visited the nearest post of his comrades to ascertain that
  they had not been attacked. It was some distance to the palace-gardens, and
  he could not avoid missing the earlier stages of the banquet."</p>

  <p>"You must make up for lost time," observed Placidus, signing to the slaves
  to heap the new-comer's plate and fill his cup to the brim. "The later, the
  warmer welcome; the earlier, the better cheer; "and whilst he spoke the
  friendly words he was resolving that the Greek should be placed in front that
  whole night, under his immediate supervision. At the slightest symptom of
  treachery or wavering he would slay him with his own hand.</p>

  <p>And now the gigantic hunger of these champions seemed to be appeased at
  last. Dish had succeeded dish in endless variety, and they had applied
  themselves to each as it came with an undiminished energy that astonished the
  domestics accustomed to the palled appetites of jaded men of pleasure like
  their lord. Even the latter&mdash;though he tried hard, for he especially
  prided himself on his capacity of eating and drinking&mdash;found it
  impossible to keep pace with his guests. Their great bodily powers, indeed,
  increased by severe and habitual training, enabled them to consume vast
  quantities of food, without experiencing those sensations of lassitude and
  repletion which overcome weaker frames. It seemed as though most of what they
  ate went at once to supply the waste created by years of toil, and as soon as
  swallowed, fed the muscles instead of burdening the stomach. It was equally
  so with wine. Such men can drink draught after draught, and partake freely in
  the questionable pleasures of intoxication, whilst they pay none of its
  penalties. A breath of fresh air, a few minutes' exercise, and their brains
  are cool, their eyes clear, their whole system strengthened for the time, and
  stimulated, rather than stupefied, by their excess.</p>

  <p>The gladiators lay back on their couches in extreme bodily content. The
  cups were still quickly filled and emptied, but more in compliance with the
  customs of conviviality than the demands of thirst. They were all talking at
  once, and every man saw both present and future through the rosy medium of
  the wine he had imbibed.</p>

  <p>There were two, however, of the party who had not suffered their real
  inmost attention to stray for an instant from the actual business of the
  night, who calculated the time exactly as it passed&mdash;who watched the men
  through the succeeding phases of satisfaction, good-humour, conviviality, and
  recklessness, stopping just short of inebriety, and seized the very moment at
  which the iron was hot enough to strike. The same thought was in the brain of
  each, when their eyes met; the same words were springing to their lips, but
  Hippias spoke first.</p>

  <p>"No more wine to-night, tribune, if work is to be done! The circus is
  full; the arena swept; the show paid for. When the praetor takes his seat we
  are ready to begin."</p>

  <p>Placidus glanced significantly in his face, and rose, holding a brimming
  goblet in his hand. The suddenness of the movement arrested immediate
  attention. The men were all silent, and looking towards their host.</p>

  <p>"Good friends!" said he. "Trusty swordsmen! Welcome guests! Listen to me.
  To-night we burn the palace&mdash;we overthrow the empire&mdash;we hurl
  Caesar from his throne. All this you know, but there is something more you do
  not know. One has escaped who is acquainted with the plot. In an hour it may
  be too late. We are fast friends; we are in the same galley the land is not a
  bowshot off. But the wind is rising&mdash;the water rushing in beneath her
  keel. Will you bend your backs forthwith and row the galley safe home with
  me?"</p>

  <p>The project was a favourite one, the metaphor suited to their tastes. As
  the tribune paused, acclamations greeted him on all sides, and " We will! We
  will!" " Through storm and sunshine!" " Against wind and weather!" sprang
  from many an eager lip. It was obvious the men were ready for anything. "One
  libation to Pluto!" added the host, emptying his cup, and the guests leaping
  to their feet followed his example with a mad cheer. Then they formed in
  pairs, as they were accustomed in the amphitheatre, and Euchenor with a
  malicious laugh exclaimed&mdash;<i>Morituri te salutant.</i></p>

  <p>It was enough! The ominous words were caught up and repeated in wild
  defiance and derision, boding small scruples of mercy or remorse. Twice they
  marched round the supper room to the burden of that ghastly chant, and when
  shaking off the fumes of wine they snatched eagerly at their arms, Placidus
  put himself at their head with a triumphant conviction that, come what might,
  they would not fail him in his last desperate throw for the great game.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-17"
     id="ch2-17">XVII</a>. &mdash; THE GERMAN GUARD</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL was in confusion at the palace of the Caesars. The civil
  war that had now been raging for several hours in the capital, the tumults
  that pervaded every quarter of the city, had roused the alarm, and to a
  certain extent the vigilance of such troops as still owned allegiance to
  Vitellius. But late events had much slackened the discipline for which Roman
  soldiers were so famous, and that could be but a spurious loyalty which
  depended on amount of pay and opportunities for plunder, which was accustomed
  moreover to see the diadem transferred from one successful general to another
  at a few months' interval. Perhaps his German guards were the only soldiers
  of Vitellius on whom he could place any reliance; but even these had been
  reduced to a mere handful by slaughter and desertion, while the few who
  remained, though unimpeachable in their fidelity, were wanting in every
  quality that constitutes military efficiency, except the physical strength
  and desperate courage they brought with them from the north.</p>

  <p>They were, however, the Emperor's last hope. They occupied palace-gardens
  to-night, feeding their bivouac-fires with branches from its stately cedars,
  or uprooting its exotic shrubs to hurl them crackling in the blaze. The Roman
  citizens looking on their gigantic forms moving to and fro in the glare,
  shuddered and whispered, and pointed them out to each other as being half
  men, half demons, while a passing soldier would raise his eagle crest more
  proudly, relating how those were the foes over whom the legions had
  triumphed, and would turn forthwith into a wineshop to celebrate his prowess
  at the expense of some admiring citizen in the crowd.</p>

  <p>One of these German mercenaries may be taken as a sample of the rest. He
  was standing sentry over a narrow wicket that afforded entrance to the
  palace-gardens, and was the first obstacle encountered by Esca, after the
  latter had hastened from the Esquiline to give intelligence of the design
  against Caesar's life. Leaning on his spear, with his tall frame and large
  muscles thrown into strong relief by the light of the bivouac-fire behind
  him, he brought to the Briton's mind many a stirring memory of his own
  warlike boyhood, when by the side of just such champions, armed in such a
  manner, he had struggled, though in vain, against the discipline and the
  strategy of the invader. Scarcely older than himself, the sentry possessed
  the comely features and the bright colouring of youth, with a depth of chest
  and squareness of shoulder that denoted all the power of mature manhood. He
  seemed indeed a formidable antagonist for any single foe, and able to keep at
  bay half a score of the finest men who stood in the front rank of the
  legions. He was clad in a long white garment of linen, reaching below the
  knee, and fastened at the neck by a single clasp of gold; his shield and
  helmet too, although this was no state occasion, but one on which he would
  probably be massacred before morning, were of the same metal, his spear-head
  and sword of the finest-tempered steel. The latter, especially, was a
  formidable weapon. Considerably longer than the Roman's, which was only used
  for the thrust at close quarters, it could deal sweeping blows that would
  cleave a headpiece or lop a limb, and managed lightly as a riding-wand by the
  German's powerful arm, would hew fearful gaps in the ranks of an enemy, if
  their line wavered, or their order was in any degree destroyed.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the warlike nature of his arms and bearing, the sentry's
  face was fair and smooth as a woman's; the flaxen down was scarcely springing
  on his chin, and the golden locks escaped beneath his helmet, and clustered
  in curls upon his neck. His light blue eye, too, had a mild and rather vacant
  expression as it roved carelessly around; but the Romans had long ago learned
  that those light blue eyes could kindle into sparks of fire when steel was
  crossed, could glare with invincible hatred and defiance even when fixed in
  death.</p>

  <p>Esca's heart warmed to the barbarian guardsman with a feeling of sympathy
  and kindred. The latter sentiment may have suggested the plan by which he
  obtained entrance to the palace, for the difficulty of so doing had presented
  itself to him in brighter colours every moment as he approached. Pausing,
  therefore, at a few paces from the sentry, who levelled his spear and
  challenged when he heard footsteps, the Briton unbuckled his sword and cast
  it down between them, to indicate that he claimed protection and had no
  intention of offence. The other muttered some unintelligible words in his own
  language. It was obvious that he knew no Latin and that their conversation
  must be carried on by signs. This, however, rather smoothed than enhanced the
  difficulty; and it was a relief to Esca that the first impulse of the German
  had not been to alarm his comrades and resort to violence. The latter seemed
  to entertain no apprehension from any single individual, whether friend or
  foe, and looked, moreover, with favourable eyes on Esca's appearance, which
  bore a certain family likeness to that of his own countrymen. He suffered him
  therefore to approach his post, questioning him by signs, to which the Briton
  replied in the same manner, perfectly ignorant of their meaning, but with a
  fervent hope that the result of these mysterious gestures might be his
  admission within the wall.</p>

  <p>Under such circumstances the two were not likely to arrive at a clear
  understanding. After a while the German looked completely puzzled, and passed
  the word in his own language to a comrade within hearing, apparently for
  assistance. Esca heard the sound repeated in more than one voice, till it
  died away under the trees; there was obviously a strong chain of sentries
  round Caesar's palace. In the meantime the German would not permit Esca to
  approach within spear's-length of his post, though he kept him back
  good-humouredly with the butt-end of that weapon, nor would he suffer him to
  pick his sword up and gird it round his waist again making nevertheless, all
  the while, signs of cordiality and friendship; but though Esca responded to
  these with equal warmth, he was no nearer the inside than at first.</p>

  <p>Presently the heavy tramp of armed men smote his ear, and a centurion,
  accompanied by half a dozen soldiers, approached the wicket. These bore a
  strong resemblance, both in form and features, to the sentry who had summoned
  them; but their officer spoke Latin, and Esca, who had gained a little time
  to mature his plan, answered the German centurion's questions without
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I belong to your own division," said he. "though I come from farther
  north than your troop, and speak a different dialect. We were disbanded but
  yesterday, by a written order from Caesar. It has turned out to be a forgery.
  We have been scattered through half the wineshops in Rome, and a herald came
  round and found me drinking, and bade me return to my duty without delay. He
  said we were to muster somewhere hereabouts, that we should find a post at
  the palace, and could join it till our own officers came back. I am but a
  barbarian, I know little of Rome, but this is the palace, is it not? and you
  are a centurion of the German guard?"</p>

  <p>He drew himself up as he spoke with military respect, and the officer had
  no hesitation in believing his tale, the more so that certain of Caesar's
  troops had lately been disbanded at a time when their services seemed to be
  most in requisition. Taking charge of Esca's weapon, he spoke a few words in
  his own language to the sentry, and then addressed the Briton.</p>

  <p>"You may come to the main-guard," said he. "I should not mind a few more
  of the same maniple. We are likely to want all we can get to-night."</p>

  <p>As he conducted him through the gardens, he asked several questions
  concerning the strength of the opposing party, the state of the town, and the
  general feeling of the citizens towards Vitellius, all which Esca parried to
  the best of his abilities, hazarding a guess where he could, and accounting
  for his ignorance where he could not, on the plea that he had spent his whole
  time since his dismissal in the wineshops an excuse which the centurion's
  knowledge of the tastes and habits of his division caused him to accept
  without suspicion of its truth.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the watch-fire, Esca's military experience, slight as it had
  been, was enough to apprise him of the imminent dangers that threatened the
  palace in the event of an attack. The huge Germans lounged and lay about in
  the glare of the burning logs, as though feast, and song, and revelry were
  the objects for which they were mustered. Wine was flowing freely in large
  flagons, commensurate to the noble thirst of these Scandinavian warriors; and
  even the sentries leaving their posts at intervals, as caprice or indolence
  prompted, strode up to the watch-fire, laughed a loud laugh, drained a full
  beaker, and walked quietly back again, none the worse, to their beat. All
  hailed a new comrade with the utmost glee, as a further incentive to drink;
  and although Esca was pleased to find that none but their centurion was
  familiar with Latin, and that he was consequently free from much inconvenient
  cross-examination, it was obvious that there was no intention of letting him
  depart without pledging them in deep draughts of the rough and potent Sabine
  wine.</p>

  <p>With youth, health, and a fixed resolve to keep his wits about him, the
  Briton managed to perform this part of a soldier's duty to the satisfaction
  of his entertainers. The moments seemed very long, but whilst the Germans
  were singing, drinking, and making their remarks upon him in their own
  language, he had time to think of his plans. To have declared at once that he
  knew of a plot against Caesar, and to call upon the centurion to obtain his
  admittance to the person of the Emperor, would, he was well aware, only
  defeat his own object, by throwing suspicion on himself as a probable
  assassin and confederate of the conspirators. To put the officer on the
  alert, would cause him, perhaps, to double his sentries, and to stop the
  allowance of wine in course of consumption; but Esca saw plainly that no
  resistance from within the palace could be made to the large force his late
  master would bring to bear upon it. The only chance for the Emperor was to
  escape. If he could himself reach his presence, and warn him personally, he
  thought he could prevail upon him to fly. This was the difficulty. A monarch
  in his palace is not visible to everyone who may wish to see him, even when
  his own safety is concerned; but Esca had already gained the interior of the
  gardens, and that success encouraged him to proceed.</p>

  <p>The Germans, though believing themselves more vigilant than usual (to such
  a low state the boasted discipline of Caesar's body-guard had fallen), were
  confused and careless under the influence of wine, and their attention to the
  newcomer was soon distracted by a fresh chorus and a fresh flagon. Esca,
  under pretence that he required repose, managed to withdraw himself from the
  glare of the firelight, and borrowing a cloak from a ruddy comrade with a
  stentorian voice, lay down in the shadow of an arbutus, and affected profound
  repose. By degrees, coiling himself along the sward like a snake, he slipped
  out of sight, leaving his cloak so arranged as to resemble a sleeping form,
  and sped off in the direction of the palace, to which he was guided by
  numerous distant lights.</p>

  <p>Some alarm had evidently preceded him even here. Crowds of slaves, both
  male and female, chiefly Greeks and Asiatics, were pouring from its egresses
  and hurrying through the gardens in obvious dismay. The Briton could not but
  remark that none were empty-handed, and the value of their burdens denoted
  that those who now fled had no intention ever to return. They took little
  notice of him when they passed, save that a few of the more timid, glancing
  at his stalwart figure, turned aside and ran the swifter; while others,
  perceiving that he was unarmed, for he had left his sword with the Germans,
  shot at him some contemptuous gesture or ribald jest, which they thought the
  barbarian would not understand in time to resent.</p>

  <p>Thus he reached the spacious front of the palace, and here, indeed, the
  trumpets were sounding, and the German guard forming, evidently for
  resistance to an attack. There was no mistaking the expression of the men's
  faces, nor the clang of their heavy weapons. Though they filled the main
  court, however, a stream of fugitives still poured from the side -doors, and
  through one of these, the Briton determined he would find no difficulty in
  effecting an entrance. Glancing at the fine men getting under arms with such
  business-like rapidity, he thought how even that handful might make such a
  defence as would give Caesar time to escape, either at the back of the
  palace, or, if that were invested, disguised as one of the slaves who were
  still hurrying off in motley crowds; and notwithstanding his new-born
  feelings, he could not help, from old association, wishing that he might
  strike a blow by the side of these stalwart guardsmen, even for such a cause
  as theirs.</p>

  <p>Observing a door opening on a terrace which had been left completely
  undefended, Esca entered the palace unopposed, and roamed through hall after
  hall without meeting a living creature. Much of value had already been
  cleared away, but enough remained to have excited the cupidity of the richest
  subject in Rome. Shawls, arms, jewels, vases, statues, caskets, and
  drinking-cups were scattered about in a waste of magnificent confusion, while
  in many instances rapacious ignorance had carried off that which was
  comparatively the dross, and left the more precious articles behind. Esca had
  never even dreamed of such gorgeous luxury as he now beheld. For a few
  minutes his mind was no less stupefied than his eye was dazzled, and he
  almost forgot his object in sheer wonder and admiration; but there was no
  time to be lost, and he looked about in vain for some clue to guide him
  through this glittering wilderness to the presence of the Emperor.</p>

  <p>The rooms seemed endless, opening one into another, and each more splendid
  than the last. At length he heard the sound of voices, and darting eagerly
  forward, found himself in the midst of half a dozen persons clad in robes of
  state, with garlands on their heads, reclining round the fragments of a
  feast, a flagon or two of wine, and a golden cornucopia of fruit and flowers.
  As he entered, these started to their feet, exclaiming. "They are upon us!"
  and huddled together in a corner, like a flock of sheep when terrified by a
  dog. Observing, however, that the Briton was alone and unarmed, they seemed
  to take courage, and a fat figure thrusting itself forward, exclaimed in one
  breath. "He is not to be disturbed! Caesar is busy. Are the Germans
  firm?"</p>

  <p>His voice shook and his whole frame quivered with fear, nevertheless Esca
  recognised the speaker. It was his old antagonist Spado, a favourite eunuch
  of the household, in dire terror for his life, yet showing the one redeeming
  quality of fidelity to the hand that fed him. His comrades kept behind him,
  taking their cue from his conduct as the bellwether of the flock, yet
  trusting fervently his wisdom would counsel immediate flight.</p>

  <p>"I know you," said Esca hurriedly. "I struck you that night in anger. It
  is all over now. I have come to save your lives, all of you, and to rescue
  Caesar."</p>

  <p>"How?" said Spado, ignoring his previous injuries in the alarm of the
  hour. "You can save us? You can rescue Caesar? Then it is true. The tumult is
  grown to a rebellion! The Germans are driven in, and the game is lost!"</p>

  <p>The others caught up their mantles, girded themselves, and prepared for
  instant flight.</p>

  <p>"The guard can hold the palace for half an hour yet," replied Esca coolly.
  "But the Emperor must escape. Julius Placidus will be here forthwith, at the
  head of two hundred gladiators, and the tribune means to murder his master as
  surely as you stand trembling there."</p>

  <p>Ere he had done speaking, he was left alone in the room with Spado. The
  tribune's character was correctly appreciated, even by the eunuchs of the
  palace, and they stayed to hear no more; but Spado only looked blankly in the
  Briton's face, wringing his fat hands, and answered to the other's urgent
  appeals. "His orders were explicit. Caesar is busy. He must not be disturbed.
  He said so himself. Caesar is busy!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-18"
     id="ch2-18">XVIII</a>. &mdash; THE BUSINESS OF CAESAR</h2>

  <p class="first">THRUSTING Spado aside without ceremony, and disregarding the
  eunuch's expostulations in obedience to the orders he had received, Esca
  burst through a narrow door, tore down a velvet curtain, and found himself in
  the private apartment of the Emperor. Caesar's business was at that moment
  scarcely of an urgency to weigh against the consideration of Caesar's life.
  Vitellius was reclining on a couch, his dress disordered and ungirt, a
  garland of roses at his feet, his heavy face, of which the swollen features
  had lost all their early comeliness, expressing nothing but sullen torpid
  calm; his eye fixed on vacancy, his weak nerveless hands crossed in front of
  his unwieldy person, and his whole attitude that of one who had little to
  occupy his attention, save his own personal indulgence and comfort. Yet for
  all this, the mind was busy within that bloated form. There are moments in
  existence, when the past comes back to us day by day, and incident by
  incident, shining out in colours vivid and lifelike as the present. On the
  eve of an important crisis, during the crisis itself if we are not permitted
  to take an active part in it but compelled to remain passive, the mere sport
  of its contingencies, for the few minutes that succeed a complete demolition
  of the fabric we have been building all our lives, we become possessed of
  this faculty, and seem, in a strange dream-like sense, to live our time over
  again.</p>

  <p>For the last few days, even Vitellius had awoke to the conviction that his
  diadem was in danger, for the last few hours he had seen cause to tremble for
  his life; nevertheless, none of the usual habits of the palace had been
  altered; and even when Primus, the successful general of his dangerous rival,
  Vespasian, occupied the suburbs, his reverses did but elicit from the Emperor
  a call for more wine and a heartless jest. To-day he must have seen clearly
  that all was lost, yet the supper to which he sat down with half a dozen
  favourite eunuchs, was no less elaborate than usual, the wine flowed as
  freely, the Emperor ate as enormously, and when he could eat no more, retired
  to pass his customary half-hour in perfect silence and repose, nor suffered
  the important process of digestion to be disturbed by the fact that his very
  gates must ere midnight be in possession of the enemy.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, as if in warning of what was to come, the pageant of his
  life seemed to move past his half-closed eyes; and who shall say how vain and
  empty such a pageant may have appeared even to the besotted glutton, who,
  though he had the address to catch the diadem of the Caesars, when it was
  thrown to him by chance, knew but too well that he had no power to retain it
  on his head when wrested by the grasp of force. Though feeble and worn out,
  he was not old, far short of threescore years, yet what a life of change and
  turmoil and vicissitudes his had been! Proconsul of Africa, favourite of four
  emperors, it must have been a certain versatility of talent that enabled him
  to rule such an important province with tolerable credit, and yet retain the
  good graces of successive tyrants, resembling each other in nothing save
  incessant caprice. An informer with Tiberius; a pander to the crimes, and a
  proselyte to the divinity of mad Caligula; a screen for Messalina's vices,
  and an easy adviser to her easy and timid lord; lastly, everything in turn
  with Nero&mdash;chariot-driver, singer, parasite, buffoon, and in all these
  various parts, preserving the one unfailing characteristic of a consummate
  and systematic debauchee. It seemed but yesterday that he had thrown the dice
  with Claudius, staking land and villas as freely as jewels and gold, losing
  heavily to his imperial master; and, though he had to borrow the money at
  high usury, quick-witted enough to perceive the noble reversion he had thus a
  chance of purchasing. It seemed but yesterday that he flew round the dusky
  circus, grazing the goal with practised skill, and, by a happy dexterity,
  suffering Caligula to win the race so narrowly, as to enhance the pleasure of
  imperial triumph. It seemed but yesterday that he sang with Nero, and
  flattered the monster by comparing him with the sirens, whose voices charmed
  mariners to their destruction.</p>

  <p>And now was it all over? Must he indeed give up the imperial purple and
  the throne of blazing gold? the luxurious banquets and the luscious wines? He
  shuddered and sickened while he thought of a crust of brown bread and a
  pitcher of water. Nay, worse than this, was he sure his life was safe? He had
  seen death often&mdash;what Roman had not? But at his best, in the field,
  clad in corselet and head-piece, and covered with a buckler, he had thought
  him an ugly and unwelcome visitor. Even at Bedriacum, when he told his
  generals as he rode over the slain, putrefying on the ground, that " a dead
  enemy smelt sweet, and the sweeter for being a citizen," he remembered now
  that his gorge had risen while he spoke. He remembered, too, the German
  bodyguard that had accompanied him, and the faithful courage with which his
  German levies fought. There were a few of them in the palace yet. It gave him
  confidence to recollect this. For a moment the soldier-spirit kindled up
  within, and he felt as though he could put himself at the head of those
  blue-eyed giants, lead them into the very centre of the enemy, and die there
  like a man. He rose to his feet, and snatched at one of the weapons hanging
  for ornament against the wall, but the weak limbs failed, the pampered body
  asserted itself, and he sank back helpless on the couch.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Esca burst so unceremoniously into the
  Emperor's presence.</p>

  <p>Vitellius did not rise again, less alarmed, perhaps, than astonished. The
  Briton threw himself upon his knees, and touched the broad crimson binding of
  the imperial gown.</p>

  <p>"There is not a moment to lose!" said he. "They are forcing the gates. The
  guard has been driven back. It is too late for resistance; but Caesar may yet
  escape if he will trust himself to me."</p>

  <p>Vitellius looked about him, bewildered. At that moment a shout was heard
  from the palace-gardens, accompanied by a rush of many feet, and the ominous
  clash of steel. Esca knew that the assailants were gladiators. If they came
  in with their blood up, they would give no quarter.</p>

  <p>"Caesar must disguise himself," he insisted earnestly. "The slaves have
  been leaving the palace in hundreds. If the Emperor would put on a coarse
  garment and come with me, I can show him the way to safety; and Placidus,
  hastening to this apartment, will find it empty."</p>

  <p>With all his sensual vices, there was yet something left of the old Roman
  spirit in Vitellius, which sparkled out in an emergency. After the first
  sudden surprise of Esca's entrance, he became cooler every moment. At the
  mention of the tribune's name he seemed to reflect.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" said he, after a pause; "and how came you here?"</p>

  <p>Short as had been his reign he had acquired the tone of royalty; and could
  even assume a certain dignity, notwithstanding the urgency of his present
  distress. In a few words Esca explained to him his danger, and his
  enemies.</p>

  <p>"Placidus," repeated the Emperor thoughtfully, and as if more concerned
  than surprised; "then there is no chance of the design failing; no hope of
  mercy when it has succeeded. Good friend! I will take your advice. I will
  trust you, and go with you, where you will. If I am an Emperor to-morrow, you
  will be the greatest man in Rome."</p>

  <p>Hitherto he had been leaning indolently back on the couch. Now he seemed
  to rouse himself for action, and stripped the crimson-bordered gown from his
  shoulders, the signet-ring from his hand.</p>

  <p>"They will make a gallant defence," said he. "but if I know Julius
  Placidus, he will outnumber them ten to one. Nevertheless they may hold him
  at bay with their long swords till we get clear of the palace. The gardens
  are dark and spacious; we can hide there for a time, and take an opportunity
  of reaching my wife's house on Mount Aventine; Galeria will not betray me,
  and they will never think of looking for me there."</p>

  <p>Speaking thus coolly and deliberately, but more to himself than his
  companion, Caesar, divested of all marks of splendour in his dress and
  ornaments, stripped to a plain linen garment, turning up his sleeves and
  girding himself the while, like a slave busied in some household work
  requiring activity and despatch, suffered the Briton to lead him into the
  next apartment, where, deserted by his comrades, and sorely perplexed between
  a vague sense of duty and a strong inclination to run away, Spado was pacing
  to and fro in a ludicrous state of perturbation and dismay. Already the noise
  of fighting was plainly distinguished in the outer court. The gladiators,
  commanded by Hippias and guided by the treacherous tribune, had overpowered
  the main body of the Germans who occupied the imperial gardens, and were now
  engaged with the remnant of these faithful barbarians at the very doors of
  the palace.</p>

  <p>The latter, though outnumbered, fought with the desperate courage of their
  race. The Roman soldier in his cool methodical discipline, was sometimes
  puzzled to account for that frantic energy, which acknowledged no superiority
  either of position or numbers, which seemed to gather a fresher and more
  stubborn courage from defeat; and even the gladiators, men whose very
  livelihood was slaughter, and whose weapons were never out of their hands,
  found themselves no match for these large savage warriors in the struggle of
  a hand-to-hand combat, recoiled more than once in baffled rage and
  astonishment from the long swords, and the blue eyes, and the tall forms that
  seemed to tower and dilate in the fierce revelry of battle.</p>

  <p>The military skill of Placidus, exercised before many a Jewish rampart,
  and on many a Syrian plain, had worsted the main body of the Germans by
  taking them in flank. Favoured by the darkness of the shrubberies, he had
  contrived to throw a hundred practised swordsmen unexpectedly on their most
  defenceless point. Surprised and outnumbered, they retreated nevertheless in
  good order, though sadly diminished, upon their comrades at the gate. Here
  the remaining handful made a desperate stand, and here Placidus, wiping his
  bloody sword upon his tunic, whispered to Hippias&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We must put Hirpinus and the supper-party in front! If we can but carry
  the gate, there are a score of entrances into the palace. Remember! we give
  no quarter, and we recognise no one."</p>

  <p>Whilst the chosen band who had left the tribune's table were held in check
  by the guard, there was a moment's respite, during which Caesar might
  possibly escape. Esca, rapidly calculating the difficulties in his own mind,
  had resolved to hurry him through the most secluded part of the gardens into
  the streets, and so running the chance of recognition which in the darkness
  of night, and under the coarse garb of a household slave, was but a remote
  contingency, to convey him by a circuitous route to Galeria's house, of which
  he knew the situation, and where he might be concealed for a time without
  danger of detection. The great obstacle was to get him out of the palace
  without being seen. The private door by which he had himself entered, he knew
  must be defended, or the assailants would have taken advantage of it ere
  this, and he dared not risk recognition, to say nothing of the chances of
  war, by endeavouring to escape through the midst of the conflict at the main
  gate. He appealed to Spado for assistance.</p>

  <p>"There is a terrace at the back here," stammered the eunuch; "if Caesar
  can reach it, a pathway leads directly down to the summer-house in the
  thickest part of the gardens; thence he can go between the fish-ponds
  straight to the wicket that opens on the Appian Way."</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" exclaimed the Emperor angrily. "how am I to reach the terrace?
  There is no door, and the window must be a man's height at least from the
  ground."</p>

  <p>"It is your only chance of life, illustrious!" observed Esca impatiently.
  "Guide us to the window, friend," he added, turning to Spado, who looked from
  one to the other in helpless astonishment, "and tear that shawl from the
  couch; we may want it for a rope to let the Emperor down."</p>

  <p>A fresh shout from the combatants at the gate, while it completely
  paralysed the eunuch, seemed to determine Vitellius. He moved resolutely
  forward, followed by his two companions, Spado whispering to the Briton. "You
  are a brave young man. We will all escape together, I&mdash;I will stand by
  you to the last!"</p>

  <p>They needed but to cross a passage and traverse another room. Caesar
  peered over the window-sill into the darkness below, and drew back.</p>

  <p>"It is a long way down," said he. "What if I were to break a limb?"</p>

  <p>Esca produced the shawl he had brought with him from the adjoining
  apartment, and offered to place it under his arms and round his body.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go first?" said Spado. "It is not five cubits from the
  ground."</p>

  <p>But the Emperor thought of his brother Lucius and the cohorts at
  Terracina. Could he but gain the camp there he would be safe, nay more, he
  could make head against his rival; he would return to Rome with a victorious
  army; he would retrieve the diadem and the purple, and the suppers at the
  palace once more.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are!" he commanded Spado, who was looking with an eager
  eye at the window. "I will risk it. One draught of Falernian, and I will risk
  it and be gone."</p>

  <p>He turned back towards the banqueting-room, and while he did so another
  shout warned him that the gate was carried, and the palace in possession of
  the conspirators.</p>

  <p>Esca followed the Emperor, vainly imploring him to fly. Spado, taking one
  more look from the window ere he risked his bones, heard the ring of armour
  and the tramp of feet coming round the corner of the palace, on the very
  terrace he desired to reach. White and trembling, he tore the garland from
  his head and gnawed its roses with his teeth in the impotence of his despair.
  He knew the last chance was gone now, and they must die.</p>

  <p>The Emperor returned to the room where he had supped; seized a flagon of
  Falernian, filled himself a large goblet which he half-emptied at a draught,
  and set it down on the board with a deep sigh of satisfaction. The courtyard
  had been taken at last, and the palace surrounded. Resistance was hopeless,
  and escape impossible. The Germans were still fighting, indeed, within the
  rooms, disputing inch by inch the glittering corridors, and the carved
  doorways, and the shining polished floors, now more slippery than ever with
  blood. Pictures and statues seemed to look down in calm amazement at thrust
  and blow and death-grapple, and all the reeling confusion of mortal strife.
  But the noise came nearer and nearer; the Germans, falling man by man, were
  rapidly giving ground. Esca knew the game was lost at last, and he turned to
  his companions in peril with a grave and clouded brow.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing for it left," said he. "but to die like men. Yet if
  there be any corner in which Caesar can hide," he added, with something of
  contempt in his tone. "I will gain him five minutes more of life, if this
  glittering toy holds together so long."</p>

  <p>Then he snatched from the wall an Asiatic javelin, all lacquered and
  ornamented with gold, cast one look at the others, as if to bid them
  farewell, and hurried from the room. Spado, a mass of shaking flesh, and
  tumbled garments and festive ornaments strangely out of keeping with his
  attitude, cowered down against the wall, hiding his face in his hands; but
  Vitellius, with something akin even to gratification on his countenance,
  returned to the half-emptied cup, and raising it to his lips, deliberately
  finished his Falernian.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-19"
     id="ch2-19">XIX</a>. &mdash; AT BAY</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was not in Esca's nature to be within hearing of shrewd
  blows and yet abstain from taking part in the fray. His recent sentiments had
  indeed undergone a change that would produce timely fruit; and neither the
  words of the preacher in the Esquiline, nor the example of Calchas, nor the
  sweet influence of Mariamne, had been without their effect. But it was
  engrained in his very character to love the stir and tumult of a fight. From
  a boy his blood leaped and tingled at the clash of steel. His was the courage
  which is scarcely exercised in the tide of personal conflict, and must be
  proved rather in endurance than in action&mdash;so naturally does it force
  itself to the front when men are dealing blow for blow. His youth, too, had
  been spent in warfare, and in that most ennobling of all warfare which
  defends home from the aggression of an invader. He had long ago learned to
  love danger for its own sake, and now he experienced besides a morbid desire
  to have his hand on the tribune's throat, so he felt the point and tried the
  shaft of his javelin with a thrill of savage joy, while, guided by the sounds
  of combat he hurried along the corridor to join the remnant of the faithful
  German guard. Not a score of them were left, and of these scarce one but bled
  from some grievous wound. Their white garments were stained with crimson,
  their gaudy golden armour was hacked and dinted, their strength was nearly
  spent, and every hope of safety gone; but their courage was still unquenched,
  and as man after man went down, the survivors closed in and fought on,
  striking desperately with their faces to the foe. The tribune and his chosen
  band, supported by a numerous body of inferior gladiators, were pressing them
  sore. Placidus, an expert swordsman, and in no way wanting physical courage,
  was conspicuous in the front. Hippias alone seemed to vie with the tribune in
  reckless daring, though Hirpinus, Eumolpus, Lutorius, and the others, were
  all earning their wages with scrupulous fidelity, and bearing themselves
  according to custom, as if fighting were the one business of their lives.</p>

  <p>When Esca reached the scene of conflict the tribune had just closed with a
  gigantic adversary. For a minute they reeled in the death-grapple, then
  parted as suddenly as they met, the German falling backward with a groan, the
  tribune's blade as he brandished it aloft dripping with blood to the very
  hilt.</p>

  <p><i>"Euge!"</i> shouted Hippias, who was at his side, parrying at the same
  moment, with consummate address, a sweeping sword-cut dealt at him from the
  dead man's comrade. "That was prettily done, tribune, and like an
  artist!"</p>

  <p>Esca, catching sight of his enemy's hated face, dashed in with the bound
  of a tiger, and taking him unawares, delivered at him so fierce and rapid a
  thrust as would have settled accounts between them, had Placid us possessed
  no other means of defence than his own skilful swordsmanship; but the
  fencing-master, whose eye seemed to take in all the combatants at once, cut
  through the curved shaft of the Briton's weapon with one turn of his short
  sword, and its head fell harmless on the floor. His hand was up for a deadly
  thrust when Esca found himself felled to the ground by some powerful fist,
  while a ponderous form holding him down with its whole weight, made it
  impossible for him to rise.</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet, lad," whispered a friendly voice in his ear; "I was forced to
  strike hard to get thee down in time. Faith! the master gives short warning
  with his thrusts. Here thou'rt safe, and here I'll take care thou shalt
  remain till the tide has rolled over us, and I can pass thee out unseen. Keep
  quiet! I tell thee, lest I have to strike thee senseless for thine own
  good."</p>

  <p>In vain the Briton struggled to regain his feet; Hirpinus kept him down by
  main force. No sooner had the gladiator caught sight of his friend, than he
  resolved to save him from the fate which too surely threatened all who were
  found in the palace, and with characteristic promptitude, used the only means
  at his disposal for the fulfilment of his object. A moment's reflection
  satisfied Esca of his old comrade's good faith. Life is sweet, and with the
  hope of its preservation came back the thought of Mariamne. He lay still for
  a few minutes, and by that time the tide of fight had rolled on, and they
  were left alone. Hirpinus rose first with a jovial laugh.</p>

  <p>"Why, you went down, man," said he. "like an ox at an altar. I would have
  held my hand a little&mdash;in faith I would&mdash; had there been time.
  Well, I must help thee up, I suppose, seeing that I put thee down. Take my
  advice, lad, get outside as quick as thou canst. Keep the first turning to
  the right of the great gate, stick to the darkest part of the gardens, and
  run for thy life!"</p>

  <p>So speaking, the gladiator helped Esca to his feet, and pointed down the
  corridor where the way was now clear. The Briton would have made one more
  effort to save the Emperor, but Hirpinus interposed his burly form, and
  finding his friend so refractory, half-led, half-pushed him to the door of
  the palace. Here he bade him farewell, looking wistfully out into the night,
  as though he would fain accompany him.</p>

  <p>"I have little taste for the job here, and that's the truth," said he, in
  the tone of a man who has been unfairly deprived of some expected pleasure.
  "The Germans made a pretty good stand for a time, but I thought there were
  more of them, and that the fight would have lasted twice as long. Good luck
  go with thee, lad; I shall perhaps never see thee again. Well, well, it can't
  be helped. I have been bought and paid for, and must go back to my work."</p>

  <p>So, while Esca, hopeless of doing any more good, went his way into the
  gardens, Hirpinus re-entered the palace to follow his comrades, and assist in
  the search for the Emperor. He was somewhat surprised to hear loud shouts of
  laughter echoing from the end of the corridor. Hastening on to learn the
  cause of such strangely-timed mirth, he came upon Rufus lying across the
  prostrate body of a German, and trying hard to stanch the blood that welled
  from a fatal gash inflicted by his dead enemy, ere he went down. Hirpinus
  raised his friend's head, and knew it was all over.</p>

  <p>"I have got it," said Rufus, in a faint voice; "my foot slipped and the
  clumsy barbarian lunged in over my guard. Farewell, old comrade! Bid the wife
  keep heart. There is a home for her at Picenum, and&mdash;the boys&mdash;keep
  them out of the Family. When you close with these Germans disengage at half
  distance, and turn your wrist down with the&mdash;old&mdash;thrust, so as
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Weaker and weaker came the gladiator's last syllables, his head sank, his
  jaw dropped, and Hirpinus, turning for a farewell look at the comrade with
  whom he had trained, and toiled, and drank, and fought, for half a score of
  years, dashed his hand angrily to his shaggy eyelashes, for he saw him
  through a mist of tears.</p>

  <p>Another shout of laughter, louder still and nearer, roused him to action.
  Turning into the room whence it proceeded, he came upon a scene of combat,
  nearly as ludicrous as the last was pitiful. Surrounded by a circle of
  gladiators, roaring out their applause and holding their sides with mirth,
  two most unwilling adversaries were pitted against each other. They seemed,
  indeed, very loth to come to close quarters, and stood face to face with
  excessive watchfulness and caution. In searching for the Emperor, Placidus
  and his myrmidons had scoured several apartments without success. Finding the
  palace thus unoccupied, and now in their own hands, the men had commenced
  loading themselves with valuables, and prepared to decamp with their plunder,
  each to his home, as having fulfilled their engagement, and earned their
  reward. But the tribune well knew that if Vitellius survived the night, his
  own head would be no longer safe on his shoulders, and that it was
  indispensable to find the Emperor at all hazards; so gathering a handful of
  gladiators round him, persuading some and threatening others, he instituted a
  strict search in one apartment after another, leaving no hole nor corner
  untried, persuaded that Caesar must be still inside the palace, and
  consequently within his grasp. He entertained, nevertheless, a lurking
  mistrust of treachery roused by the late appearance of Euchenor at supper,
  which was rather strengthened than destroyed by the Greek's unwillingness to
  engage in personal combat with the Germans. Whilst he was able to do so, the
  tribune had kept a wary eye upon the pugilist, and had indeed prevented him
  more than once from slipping out of the conflict altogether. Now that the
  Germans were finally disposed of, and the palace in his power, he kept the
  Greek close at hand with less difficulty, jeering him, half in jest and half
  in earnest, on the great care he had taken of his own person in the fray.
  Thus, with Euchenor at his side, followed by Hippias, and some half-dozen
  gladiators, the tribune entered the room in which the Emperor had supped, and
  from which a door, concealed by a heavy curtain, led into a dark recess
  originally intended for a bath. At the foot of this curtain, half-lying,
  half-sitting, grovelled an obese unwieldy figure, clad in white, which moaned
  and shook and rocked itself to and fro, in a paroxysm of abject fear. The
  tribune leapt forward with a gleam of diabolical triumph in his eyes. The
  next instant his face fell, as the figure, looking up, presented the scared
  features of the bewildered Spado. But even in his wrath and disappointment
  Placidus could indulge himself with a brutal jest.</p>

  <p>"Euchenor," said he. "thou hast hardly been well blooded to-night. Drive
  thy sword through this carrion, and draw it out of our way."</p>

  <p>The Greek was only averse to cruelty when it involved personal danger. He
  rushed in willingly enough, his blade up, and his eyes glaring like a
  tiger's; but the action roused whatever was left of manhood in the victim,
  and Spado sprang to his feet with the desperate courage of one who has no
  escape left. Close at his hand lay a Parthian bow, one of the many
  curiosities in arms that were scattered about the room, together with a
  sandal-wood quiver of puny painted arrows.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"

    <img src="1400421h-images/TheGladiators-07.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="'Their points are poisoned,' he shouted.">

    <p class="caption">"Their points are poisoned," he shouted.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"Their points are poisoned," he shouted; "and a touch is death!"</p>

  <p>Then he drew the bow to its full compass, and glared about him like some
  hunted beast brought to bay. Euchenor, checked in his spring, stood rigid as
  if turned to stone. His beautiful form indeed, motionless in that lifelike
  attitude, would have been a fat study for one of his own country's sculptors;
  but the surrounding gladiators, influenced only by the ludicrous points of
  the situation, laughed till their sides shook, at the two cowards thus
  confronting each other.</p>

  <p>"To him, Euchenor!" said they, with the voice and action by which a man
  encourages his dog at its prey. "To him, lad! Here's old Hirpinus come to
  back thee. He always voted thee a cur. Show him some of thy mettle now!"</p>

  <p>Goaded by their taunts, Euchenor made a rapid feint, and crouched for
  another dash. Terrified and confused, the eunuch let the bowstring escape
  from his nerveless ringers, and the light gaudy arrow, grazing the Greek's
  arm and scarcely drawing blood, fell, as it seemed, harmless to the floor
  between his feet. Again there was a loud shout of derision, for Euchenor,
  dropping his weapon, applied this trifling scratch to his mouth; ere the
  laugh subsided, however, the Greek's face contracted and turned pale. With a
  wild yell he sprang bolt upright, raising his arms above his head, and fell
  forward on his breast, dead.</p>

  <p>The gladiators leaping in, passed half a dozen swords through the eunuch's
  body, almost ere their comrade touched the floor. Then Lutorius and Eumolpus
  tearing down the curtain disappeared in the dark recess behind. There was an
  exclamation of surprise, a cry for mercy, a scuffling of feet, the fall of
  some heavy piece of furniture, and the two emerged again, dragging between
  them, pale and gasping, a bloated and infirm old man.</p>

  <p>"Caesar is fled!" said he, looking wildly round. "You seek Caesar? " then
  perceiving the dark smile on the tribune's face, and abandoning all hope of
  disguise, he folded his arms with a certain dignity that his coarse garments
  and disordered state could not wholly neutralise, and added</p>

  <p>"I am Caesar! Strike! since there is no mercy and no escape!"</p>

  <p>The tribune paused an instant and pondered. Already the dawn was stealing
  through the palace, and the dead upturned face of Spado looked grey and
  ghastly in the pale cold light. Master of the situation, he did but
  deliberate whether he should-slay Caesar with his own hand, thus bidding high
  for the gratitude of his successor, or whether, by delivering him over to an
  infuriated soldiery, who would surely massacre him on the spot, he should
  make his death appear an act of popular justice, in the furtherance of which
  he was himself a mere dutiful instrument. A few moments' reflection on the
  character of Vespasian, decided him to pursue the latter course. He turned to
  the gladiators, and bade them secure their prisoner.</p>

  <p>Loud shouts and the tramp of many thousand armed feet announced that the
  disaffected legions were converging on the palace, and had already filled its
  courtyard with masses of disciplined men, ranged under their eagles in all
  the imposing precision and the glittering pomp of war. The increasing
  daylight showed their serried files, extending far beyond the gate, over the
  spacious gardens of the palace, and the cold morning breeze unfurled a banner
  here and there, on which were already emblazoned the initials of the new
  emperor. "Titus Flavius Vespasian Caesar." As Vitellius with his hands bound,
  led between two gladiators, passed out of the gate which at midnight had been
  his own, one of these gaudy devices glittered in the rising sun before his
  eyes. Then his whole frame seemed to collapse, and his head sank upon his
  breast, for he knew that the bitterness of death had indeed come at last.</p>

  <p>But it was no part of the tribune's scheme that his victim's lineaments
  should escape observation. He put his own sword beneath the Emperor's chin,
  and forced him to hold his head up while the soldiers hooted and reviled, and
  ridiculed their former lord.</p>

  <p>"Let them see thy face," said the tribune brutally. "Even now thou art
  still the most notorious man in Rome."</p>

  <p>Obese in person, lame in gait, pale, bloated, dishevelled, and a captive,
  there was yet a certain dignity about the fallen emperor, while he drew
  himself up, and thus answered his enemy&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Thou hast eaten of my bread and drunk from my cup. I have loaded thee
  with riches and honours. Yesterday I was thine emperor and thy host. To-day I
  am thy captive and thy victim. But here, in the jaws of death, I tell thee
  that not to have my life and mine empire back again, would I change places
  with Julius Placidus the tribune!"</p>

  <p>They were the last words he ever spoke, for while they paraded him along
  the Sacred Way, the legions gathered in and struck him down, and hewed him in
  pieces, casting the fragments of his body into the stream of Father Tiber,
  stealing calm and noiseless by the walls of Rome. And though the faithful
  Galeria collected them for decent interment, few cared to mourn the memory of
  Vitellius the glutton; for the good and temperate Vespasian reigned in his
  stead.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-20"
     id="ch2-20">XX</a>. &mdash; THE FAIR HAVEN</h2>

  <p class="first">IN a land-locked bay sheltered by wooded hills, under a calm
  cloudless sky, and motionless as some sleeping seabird, a galley lay at
  anchor on the glistening surface of the Mediterranean. Far out at sea,
  against a clear horizon the breeze just stirred the waters to a purer deeper
  blue, but here, behind the sharp black point, that shot boldly from the
  shore, long sheets of light, unshadowed by a single ripple traversed the bay,
  basking warm and still in the glaring sunshine. The very gulls that usually
  flit so restless to and fro, had folded their wings for an interval of
  repose, and the hush of the hot southern noon lay drowsily on the burnished
  surface of the deep.</p>

  <p>The galley had obviously encountered her share of wind and weather. Spars
  were broken and tackle strained. Her large square sail, rent and patched, was
  under process of repair; heaped up, neglected for the present, and half
  unfurled upon the deck, while the double-banked seats of her rowers were
  unoccupied, and the long oars shipped idly in her sides. Like the seabird she
  resembled, and whose destiny she shared, it seemed as though she also had
  folded her wings, and gone peacefully to sleep.</p>

  <p>Two figures were on the deck of the galley, drinking in the beauty that
  surrounded them, with the avidity of youth, and health, and love. They
  thought not of the dangers they had so narrowly escaped&mdash;of the perils
  by sea and perils by land that were in store for them yet, of the sorrows
  they must undergo, the difficulties they must encounter, the frail thread on
  which their present happiness depended. It was enough for them that they were
  gazing on the loveliness of one of the fairest isles in the Aegean, and that
  they were together.</p>

  <p>Surely there is a Fair Haven in the voyage of each of us, to which we
  reach perhaps once in a lifetime, where we pause and furl the sail and ship
  the oar, not that we are weary indeed, nor unseaworthy, but that we cannot
  resist, even the strongest and bravest of us, the longing of poor humanity
  for rest. Such seasons as these come to remind us of our noble destiny, and
  our inherent unworthiness&mdash;of our capacity for happiness, and our
  failure in attaining it&mdash;of the sordid casket, and the priceless jewel
  we are sure that it contains. At such seasons shall we not rejoice and revel
  in the happiness they bring? Shall we not bathe in the glorious sunshine, and
  snatch at the glowing fruit, and empty the golden cup, ay to the very dregs?
  What though there be a cloud behind the hill, a bitter morsel at the fruit's
  core, a drop of wormwood in the sparkling draught?&mdash;a 'consciousness of
  insecurity, a foresight of sorrow, a craving for the infinite and the
  eternal, which goads and guides us at once on the upward way? Would we be
  without it if we could? We cannot be more than human; we would not willingly
  be less. Is not failure the teacher of humility? Is not humility the first
  step to wisdom? Where is least of self-dependence, there is surely most of
  faith; and are not pain and sorrow the title-deeds of our inheritance
  hereafter?</p>

  <p>It is a false moral, it is a morbid and unreal sentiment, beautifully as
  it is expressed, which teaches us that " a sorrow's crown of sorrows, is
  remembering happier things." All true happiness is of spiritual origin. When
  we have been brushed, though never so lightly by the angel's wing, we cannot
  afterwards entirely divest ourselves of the fragrance breathed by that
  celestial presence. Even in those blissful moments, something warned us they
  would pass away; now that they have faded here, something assures us that
  they will come again, hereafter. Hope is the birthright of immortality.
  Without winter there would be no spring. In decay is the very germ of life,
  and while suffering is transitory, mercy is infinite, and joy eternal.</p>

  <p>The sailors were taking their noonday rest below, to escape the heat.
  Eleazar, the Jew, sat at the stern of the vessel, deep in meditation,
  pondering on his country's resources and his nation's wrongs the dissensions
  that paralysed the Lion of Judah, and the formidable qualities of the
  princely hunter who was bringing him warily and gradually to bay. It would be
  hard enough to resist Titus with both hands free, how hopeless a task when
  one neutralised the efforts of the other! Eleazar's outward eye, indeed, took
  in the groves of olives, and the dazzling porches, the jagged rocks and the
  glancing water; but his spirit was gazing the while upon a very different
  scene. He saw his tumultuous countrymen armed with sword and spear, brave,
  impetuous, full of the headlong courage which made their race irresistible
  for attack, but lacking the cool methodical discipline, the stern habitual
  self-reliance so indispensable for a wearing and protracted defence; and he
  saw also the long even lines under the eagles, the impregnable array of the
  legions; their fortified camp, their mechanical discipline, their exact
  manoeuvres, and the calm confident strength that was converging day by day
  for the downfall and destruction of his people. Then he moved restlessly,
  like a man impatient of actual fetters about his limbs, for he would fain be
  amongst them again, with his armour on and his spear in his hand. Calchas,
  too, was on board the anchored galley. He looked on the fair scene around as
  those look who see good in everything. And then his eye wandered from the
  glowing land, and the cloudless heaven, and the sparkling sea, to the stately
  form of Esca, and Mariamne with her gentle loving face, ere it sought his
  task again, the perusal of his treasured Syriac scroll; for the old man, who
  took his share of all the labours and hardships incidental to a sea-voyage,
  spent in sacred study many of the hours devoted by others to rest; his lips
  moved in prayer, and he called down a blessing on the head of the proselyte
  he had gained over, and the kinsman he loved.</p>

  <p>After the success of the tribune's plot, and the escape of Esca from the
  imperial palace, Rome was no longer a place in which the Briton might remain
  in safety. Julius Placid us, although, from the prominent part taken by
  Domitian in public affairs, he had not attained such power as he anticipated,
  was yet sufficiently formidable to be a fatal enemy, and it was obvious that
  the only chance of life was immediately to leave the neighbourhood of so
  implacable an adversary. The murder, too, of Vitellius, and the accession of
  Vespasian, rendered Eleazar's further stay at Rome unnecessary, and even
  impolitic, while the services rendered to Mariamne by her champion and lover,
  had given him a claim to the protection of the Jewish household, and the
  intimacy of its members. On condition of his conforming to certain fasts and
  observances, Eleazar therefore willingly gave Esca the shelter of his roof,
  concealed him whilst he himself made preparations for a hasty departure, and
  suffered him to accompany the other two members that constituted his family,
  on their voyage home to Jerusalem. After many storms and casualties, half of
  that voyage was completed, and the attachment between Esca and Mariamne which
  sprang up so unexpectedly at the corner of a street in Rome, had now grown to
  the engrossing and abiding affection which lasts for life, perhaps for
  eternity. Floating in that fair haven, with the glow of love enhancing the
  beauty of an earthly paradise, they quaffed at the cup of happiness without
  remorse or misgiving, thankful for the present and trusting for the future.
  As shipwreck had threatened them but yesterday, as to-morrow they might again
  be destined to weather stormy skies, and ride through raging seas, so,
  although they had suffered great dangers and hardships in life, greater were
  yet probably in store. Nevertheless, to-day all was calm and sunshine,
  contentment, security, and repose. They took it as it came, and standing
  together on the galley's deck, the beauty of those two young creatures seemed
  god-like, in the halo of their great joy.</p>

  <p>"We shall never be parted here," whispered Esca, while they stooped over
  the bulwark, and his hand stealing to his companion's, pressed it in a gentle
  timid clasp.</p>

  <p>With her large loving eyes full of tears, she leaned towards him, nearer,
  nearer, till her cheek touched his shoulder, and, pointing upward, she
  answered in the low earnest tones that acknowledge neither doubt nor fear:
  "Esca, we shall never be parted hereafter."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3-01"
     id="ch3-01">I</a>. &mdash; A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Feast of the Passover was at hand; the feast that was
  wont to call the children of Israel out of all parts of Syria to worship in
  the Holy City; the feast that had celebrated their deliverance from the
  relentless grasp of Pharaoh: that was ordained to mark the fulfilment of
  prophecy in the downfall of the chosen people, and their national extinction
  under the imperial might of Rome. Nevertheless, even this, the last Passover
  held in that Temple of which Solomon was the founder, and in the destruction
  of which, notwithstanding its sacred character, not one stone was permitted
  to remain upon another, had collected vast multitudes of the descendants of
  Abraham from all parts of Judaea, Samaria, Galilee, Perea, and other regions,
  to increase the sufferings of famine, and enhance the horrors of a siege.
  True to the character of their religion, rigidly observant of outward
  ceremonies, and admitting no exemptions from the requirements of the law,
  they swarmed in thousands and tens of thousands to their devoted city, round
  which even now Titus was drawing closer and closer the iron band of blockade,
  over which the Roman eagles were hovering, ere they swooped down irresistible
  on their prey.</p>

  <p>There was the hush of coming destruction in the very stillness of the
  Syrian noon, as it glowed on the white carved pinnacles of the temple, and
  flashed from its golden roof. There was a menace in the tall black cypresses,
  pointing as it were with warning gesture towards the sky. There was a
  loathsome reality of carnage about the frequent vulture, poised on his wide
  wings over every open space, or flapping heavily away with loaded gorge and
  dripping beak, from his hideous meal. Jerusalem lay like some royal lady in
  her death-pang; the fair face changed and livid in its ghastly beauty, the
  queenly brow warped beneath its diadem, and the wasted limbs quivering with
  agony under their robe of scarlet and gold.</p>

  <p>Inside the walls, splendour and misery, unholy mirth and abject despair,
  the pomp of war and the pressure of starvation, were mingled in frightful
  contrast. Beneath the shadow of princely edifices dead bodies lay unburied
  and uncared-for in the streets. Wherever was a foot or two of shelter from
  the sun, there some poor wretch seemed to have dragged himself to die. Marble
  pillars, lofty porches, white terraces, and luxuriant gardens denoted the
  wealth of the city, and the pride of its inhabitants; yet squalid figures
  crawling about, bent low towards the ground, sought eagerly here and there
  for every substance that could be converted into nourishment, and the absence
  of all offal and refuse on the pavement denoted the sad scarcity even of such
  loathsome food.</p>

  <p>The city of Jerusalem, built upon two opposite hills, of which the plan of
  the streets running from top to bottom in each, and separated only by a
  narrow valley, exactly corresponded, was admirably adapted to purposes of
  defence. The higher hill, on which was situated the upper town and the holy
  Temple, might, from the very nature of its position, be considered
  impregnable; and even the lower offered on its outside so steep and
  precipitous an ascent as to be almost inaccessible by regular troops. In
  addition to its natural strength, the city was further defended by walls of
  enormous height and solidity, protected by large square towers, each capable
  of containing a formidable garrison, and supplied with reservoirs of water
  and all other necessaries of war. Herod the Great, who, notwithstanding his
  vices, his crimes, and his occasional fits of passion amounting to madness,
  possessed the qualities both of a statesman and a soldier, had not neglected
  the means at his disposal for the security of his capital. He had himself
  superintended the raising of one of these walls at great care and expense,
  and had added to it three lofty towers, which he named after his friend, his
  brother, and his ill-fated wife.* These were constructed of huge blocks of
  marble, fitted to each other with such nicety, and afterwards wrought out by
  the workman's hand with such skill, that the whole edifice appeared to be cut
  from one gigantic mass of stone. In the days, too, of that magnificent
  monarch, these towers were nothing less than palaces within, containing
  guest-chambers, banqueting-rooms, porticoes, nay, even fountains, gardens,
  and cisterns, with great store of precious stones, gold and silver vessels,
  and all the barbaric wealth of Judaea's fierce and powerful king. Defended by
  Herod, even a Roman army might have turned away discomfited from before
  Jerusalem.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Hippicus, Phasaelus, and lovely Mariamne, for whom, in
  the dead of night, the great king used to call out in his agony of remorse
  when she was no more. ]</p>

  <p>Agrippa, too, the first of that name, who was afterwards stricken with a
  loathsome disease, and "eaten of worms," like a mere mortal, while he
  affected the attributes of a god, commenced a system of fortification to
  surround the city, which would have laughed to scorn the efforts of an enemy;
  but the Jewish monarch was too dependent on his imperial master at Rome to
  brave his suspicion by proceeding with it; and although a wall of magnificent
  design was begun, and even raised to a considerable height, it was never
  finished in the stupendous proportions originally intended. The Jews, indeed,
  after the death of its founder, strengthened it considerably, and completed
  it for purposes of defence, but not to the extent by which Agrippa proposed
  to render the town impregnable.</p>

  <p>And even had Jerusalem been entered and invested by an enemy, the Temple,
  which was also the citadel of the place, had yet to be taken. This
  magnificent building, the very stronghold of the wealth and devotion of
  Judaea, the very symbol of that nationality which was still so prized by the
  posterity of Jacob, was situated on the summit of the higher hill, from which
  it looked down and commanded both the upper and lower cities. On three sides
  it was artificially fortified with extreme caution, while on the fourth, it
  was so precipitous as to defy even the chances of a surprise. To possess the
  Temple was to hold the whole town as it were in hand; nor was its position
  less a matter of importance to the assailed than its splendour rendered it an
  object of cupidity to the assailants. Every ornament of architecture was
  lavished upon its cloisters, its pillars, its porticoes, and its walls. Its
  outward gates even, according to their respective positions, were brass,
  silver, and gold; its beams were of cedar, and other choice woods inlaid with
  the precious metal, which was also thickly spread over doorposts,
  candlesticks, cornices&mdash;everything that would admit of such costly
  decoration. The fifteen steps that led from the Court of the Women to the
  great Corinthian gate, with its double doors of forty cubits high, were worth
  as many talents of gold as they numbered.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Josephus, <i>Wars of the Jews</i>, Book V,  5. ]</p>

  <p>To those who entered far enough to behold what was termed the Inner
  Temple, a sight was presented which dazzled eyes accustomed to the splendour
  of the greatest monarchs on earth. Its whole front was covered with plates of
  beaten gold; vines bearing clusters of grapes the size of a man's finger, all
  of solid gold, were twined about and around its gates, of which the spikes
  were pointed sharp, that birds might not pollute them by perching there.
  Within were golden doors of fifty-five cubits in height; and before this
  entrance hung the celebrated veil of the Temple. It consisted of a curtain
  embroidered with blue, fine linen, scarlet and purple, signifying by mystical
  interpretation, a figure of the universe, wherein the flax typified earth;
  the blue, air; the scarlet, fire; and the purple, water. Within this
  sumptuous shrine were contained the candlestick, the table of shew-bread, and
  the altar of incense: the seven lamps of the first denoting the seven planets
  of heaven; the twelve loaves on the second representing the circle of the
  zodiac and the year; while the thirteen sweet-smelling spices on the third,
  reminded men of the Great Giver of all good things in the whole world. In the
  inmost part, again, of this Inner Temple was that sacred space, into which
  mortal eye might not look, nor mortal step enter. Secluded, awful, invisible,
  divested of all material object, it typified forcibly to the Jew the nature
  of that spiritual worship which was taught him through Abraham and the
  Patriarchs, direct from heaven.</p>

  <p>All men, however, of all creeds and nations, might gaze upon the outward
  front of the Temple, and judge by the magnificence of the covering the costly
  splendour of the shrine it contained. While a dome of pure white marble rose
  above it like a mountain of snow, the front itself of the Temple was overlaid
  with massive plates of gold, so that when it flashed in the sunrise men could
  no more look upon it than on the god of day himself. Far off in his camp,
  watching the beleaguered city, how often may the Roman soldier have pondered
  in covetous admiration, speculating on the strength of its defenders and the
  value of his prey!</p>

  <p>The Temple of Jerusalem then was celebrated through all the known earth
  for its size, its splendour, and its untold wealth. The town, strong in its
  natural position and its artificial defences, garrisoned, moreover, by a
  fierce and warlike people, whose impetuous valour could be gauged by no
  calculations of military experience, was justly esteemed so impregnable a
  fortress, as might mock the attack of a Roman army even under such a leader
  as the son of Vespasian. Had it been assailed by none other than the enemy
  outside the walls, the Holy Place need never have been desecrated and
  despoiled by the legions, the baffled eagles would have been driven westward,
  balked of their glorious prey. But here was a "house divided against itself."
  The dissension within the walls was far more terrible than the foe without.
  Blood flowed faster in the streets than on the ramparts. Many causes
  originating in his past history, had combined to shake the loyalty and
  undermine the nationality of the Jew. Perhaps, for the wisest purposes, it
  seems ordained that true religion should be especially prone to schism.
  Humanity, however high its aspirations, cannot be wholly refined from its
  earthly dross; and those who are the most in earnest are sometimes the most
  captious and unforgiving. While worship for his Maker appears to be a natural
  instinct of man, it needed a teacher direct from heaven to inculcate
  forbearance and brotherly love. The Jews were sufficiently ill-disposed to
  those of their own faith, who differed with them on unimportant points of
  doctrine, or minute observance of outward ceremonies; but where the heresy
  extended to fundamental tenets of their creed, they seemed to have hated each
  other honestly, rancorously, and mercilessly, as only brethren can.</p>

  <p>Now for many generations they have been divided into three principal
  sects, differing widely in belief, principle, and practice. These were
  distinguished by the names of Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. The first,
  as is well known, were rigid observers of the traditional law, handed down to
  them from their fathers, attaching fully as much importance to its letter as
  to its spirit. With a vague belief in what is understood by the term
  predestination, they yet allowed to mankind the choice between good and evil,
  confounding, perhaps, the foreknowledge of the Creator with the freewill of
  the creature, and believed in the immortality of souls, and the doctrine of
  eternal punishment. Their failings seem to have been inordinate religious
  pride, and undue exaltation of outward forms to the neglect of that which
  they symbolised; a grasping ambition of priestly power, and an utter want of
  charity for those who differed in opinion with themselves.</p>

  <p>The Sadducees, though professing belief in the Deity, argued an entire
  absence of influence from above on the conduct of the human race. Limiting
  the dispensation of reward and punishment to this world, they esteemed it a
  matter of choice with mankind to earn the one or incur the other; and as they
  utterly ignored the life to come, were content to enjoy temporal blessings,
  and to deprecate physical evil alone. Though wanting a certain genial
  philosophy on which the heathen prided himself, the Sadducee, both in
  principles and practice, seems closely to have resembled the Epicurean of
  ancient Greece and Rome.</p>

  <p>But there was also a third sect which numbered many votaries throughout
  Judaea, in whose tenets we discover several points of similarity with our
  own, and whose ranks, it is not unfair to suppose, furnished numbers of the
  early converts to Christianity. These were the Essenes, a persuasion that
  rejected pleasure as a positive evil, and with whom a community of goods was
  the prevailing and fundamental rule of the order. These men, while they
  affected celibacy, chose out the children of others to provide for and
  educate. While they neither bought nor sold, they never wanted the
  necessaries of life, for each gave and received ungrudgingly, according to
  his own and his neighbour's need. While they despised riches, they practised
  a strict economy, appointing stewards to care for and dispense that common
  patrimony which was raised by the joint subscription of all. Scattered over
  the whole country, in every city they were sure of finding a home, and none
  took on a journey either money, food, or raiment, because he was provided by
  his brethren with all he required wherever he stopped to rest. Their piety,
  too, was exemplary. Before sunrise not a word was spoken referring to earthly
  concerns, but public prayer was offered, imploring the blessing of light day
  by day before it came. Then they dispersed to their different handicrafts, by
  which they earned wages for the general purse. Meeting together once more,
  they bathed in cold water and sat down in white garments to their temperate
  meal, in which a sufficiency and no more was provided for each person, and
  again separated to labour till the evening, when they assembled for supper in
  the same manner before going to rest.</p>

  <p>The vows taken by all who were admitted into their society, and that only
  after a two years' probation, sufficiently indicated the purity and
  benevolence of their code. These swore to observe piety towards God, and
  justice towards men; to do no one an injury, either voluntarily or by command
  of others; to avoid the evil, and to aid the good; to obey legal authority as
  coming from above; to love truth, and openly reprove a lie; to keep the hands
  clean from theft, and the heart from unfair gain; neither to conceal anything
  from their own sect, nor to discover their secrets to others, but to guard
  them with life; also to impart these doctrines to a proselyte literally and
  exactly as each had received them himself. If one of the order committed any
  grievous sin, he was cast out of their society for a time; a sentence which
  implied starvation, as he had previously sworn never to eat save in the
  presence of his brethren. When in the last stage of exhaustion he was
  received again, as having suffered a punishment commensurate with his crime,
  and which, by the maceration of the body, should purify and save the
  soul.</p>

  <p>With such tenets and such training, the Essenes were conspicuous for their
  confidence in danger, their endurance of privation, and their contempt for
  death. The flesh they despised as the mere corruptible covering of the
  spirit, that imperishable essence, of which the aspiration was ever upwards,
  and which, when released from prison, in obedience to the dictates of its
  very nature, flew direct to heaven. Undoubtedly such doctrines as these,
  scattered here and there throughout the land, partially redeemed the Jewish
  character from the fierce unnatural stage of fanaticism, to which it had
  arrived at the period of the Christian era&mdash;afforded, it may be, a
  leavening which preserved the whole people from utter reprobation; and
  helped, perhaps, to smooth the way for those pioneers, who carried the good
  tidings first heard beneath the star of Bethlehem, westward through the
  world.</p>

  <p>But at the period when Jerusalem lay beleaguered by Titus and his legions,
  three political parties raged within her walls, to whose furious fanaticism
  her three religious sects could offer no comparison. The first and most
  moderate of these, though men who scrupled not to enforce their opinions with
  violence, had considerable influence with the great bulk of the populace, and
  were, indeed, more than either of the others, free from selfish motives, and
  sincere in their desire for the common good. They affected a great concern
  for the safety and credit of their religion, making no small outcry at the
  fact that certain stones and timber, provided formerly by Agrippa for the
  decoration of the Temple, had been desecrated by being applied to the repair
  of the defences and the construction of engines of war. They observed, also,
  how the rivalry of faction, in which, nevertheless, they took a prominent
  part, devastated the city more than any efforts of the enemy; and they did
  not scruple to paralyse the energies of the besieged, by averring that the
  military rule of the Romans, wise and temperate, though despotic, was
  preferable to the alternations of tyranny and anarchy under which they
  lived.</p>

  <p>This numerous party was especially displeasing to Eleazar, whose restless
  force of character and fanatical courage were impatient of any attempt at
  capitulation, who was determined on resistance to the death, and the utter
  destruction of the Holy City rather than its surrender. He was now living in
  the element of storm and strife, which seemed most congenial to his nature.
  No longer a foreign intriguer, disguised in poor attire, and hiding his head
  in a back street of Rome, the Jew seemed to put on fresh valour every day
  with his breast-plate, and walked abroad in the streets or directed
  operations from the ramparts; a mark for friend and foe, in his splendid
  armour, with the port of a warrior, a patriarch and a king. He was avowedly
  at the head of a numerous section of the seditious, who had adopted the title
  of Zealots; and who, affecting the warmest enthusiasm in the cause of
  patriotism and religion, were utterly unscrupulous as to the means by which
  they furthered their own objects and aggrandisement. Their practice was
  indeed much opposed to the principles they professed, and to that zeal for
  religion from which they took their name. They had not scrupled to cast lots
  for the priesthood, and to confer the highest and holiest office of the
  nation on an illiterate rustic, whose only claim to the sacerdotal dignity
  consisted in his relationship with one of the pontifical tribes. Oppression,
  insult, and rapine inflicted on their countrymen, had rendered the very name
  of Zealot hateful to the mass of the people; but they numbered in their ranks
  many desperate and determined men, skilled in the use of arms, and ready to
  perpetrate any act of violence on friend or foe. In the hands of a bold
  unscrupulous leader, they were sharp and efficient weapons. As such Eleazar
  considered them, keeping them under his own control and fit for immediate
  use.</p>

  <p>The third of these factions, which was also perhaps the most numerous,
  excited the apprehensions of the more peaceably disposed no less than the
  hatred of the last-mentioned party who had put Eleazar at their head. It was
  led by a man distinguished alike for consummate duplicity and reckless
  daring&mdash;John of Gischala, so called from a small town in Judaea, the
  inhabitants of which he had influenced to hold out against the Romans, and
  whence he had himself escaped by a stratagem, redounding as much to the
  clemency of Titus as to his own dishonour.</p>

  <p>Gischala being inhabited by a rural and unwarlike population, unprovided
  besides with defences against regular troops, would have fallen an easy prey
  to the prince with his handful of horsemen, had it not been for that
  disposition to clemency which Titus, in common with other great warriors,
  seems to have indulged when occasion offered. Knowing that if the place were
  carried by storm it would be impossible to restrain his soldiers from putting
  the inhabitants to the sword, he rode in person within earshot of the wall,
  and exhorted the defenders to open their gates and trust to his forbearance,
  a proposal to which John, who with his adherents completely overmastered and
  dominated the population, took upon himself to reply. He reminded the Roman
  commander that it was the Sabbath, a day on which not only was it unlawful
  for the Jews to undertake any matters of war, policy, or business, but even
  to treat of such, and therefore they could not so much as entertain the
  present proposals of peace; but that if the Romans would give them
  four-and-twenty hours' respite, during which period they could surround the
  city with their camp, so that none could escape from it, the keys of the gate
  should be given up to him on the following day, when he might enter in
  triumph and take possession of the place. Titus withdrew accordingly,
  probably for want of forage, to a village at some distance, and John with his
  followers, accompanied by a multitude of women and children, whom he
  afterwards abandoned, made his escape in the night and fled to Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>After such a breach of faith, he could expect nothing from the clemency of
  the Roman general; so that John of Gischala, like many others of the
  besieged, might be said to fight with a rope round his neck.</p>

  <p>Within the city there had now been a fierce struggle for power between the
  Zealots under Eleazar, and the reckless party called by different opprobrious
  terms, of which " Robbers " was the mildest, who followed the fortunes of
  John. The peaceful section, unable to make head against these two, looked
  anxiously for the entrance of the eagles, many indeed of the wealthier
  deserting when practicable to the camp of the enemy. Meanwhile the Romans
  pushed the siege vigorously. Their army now consisted of Vespasian's choicest
  legions, commanded by his son in person. Their engines of war were numerous
  and powerful. Skilful, scientific, exact in discipline, and unimpeachable in
  courage, they were gradually but surely converging, in all their strength,
  for one conclusive effort on the devoted city. Already the second wall had
  been taken, retaken in a desperate struggle by the besieged, and once more
  stormed and carried by the legions. Famine, too, with her cruel hand, was
  withering the strongest arms and chilling the bravest hearts in the city. It
  was time to forget self-interest, faction, fanaticism, everything but the
  nationality of Judaea, and the enemy at the gate.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-02"
     id="ch3-02">II</a>. &mdash; THE LION OF JUDAH</h2>

  <p class="first">ELEAZAR had resolved to obtain supreme command.</p>

  <p>In a crisis like the present, no divided authority could be expected to
  offer a successful resistance. John of Gischala must be ruined by any means
  and at any sacrifice. His unscrupulous rival, regardless of honour, truth,
  every consideration but the rescue of his country, laid his plans
  accordingly. With a plausible pretence of being reconciled, and thus
  amalgamating two formidable armies for the common good, he proposed to hold a
  conference with John in the Outer Court of the Temple, where, in presence of
  the elders and chief men of the city, they should arrange their past
  differences and enter into a compact of alliance for the future. The Great
  Council of the nation, ostensibly the rulers of public affairs, and
  influenced alternately by the two antagonists, were to be present. Eleazar
  thought it would go hard, but that, with his own persuasive powers and public
  services, he should gain some signal advantage over his adversary ere they
  separated.</p>

  <p>He appeared, accordingly, at the place of conference, splendidly armed
  indeed in his own person, but accompanied by a small retinue of adherents all
  attired in long peaceful robes, as though inviting the confidence of his
  enemy. Observant eyes, it is true, and attentive ears, caught the occasional
  clank and glitter of steel under these innocent linen mantles, and the
  friends, if few in number, were of tried valour and fidelity, while a mob of
  warlike men outside, who had gathered ostensibly to look idly on, belonged
  obviously to the party of the Zealots. Nevertheless, Eleazar had so contrived
  matters that, while he guarded against surprise, he should appear before the
  Council as a suppliant imploring justice rather than a leader dictating
  terms. He took up his position, accordingly, at the lower end of the court,
  and after a deep obeisance to the assembled elders, stood, as it were, in the
  background, assuming an air of humility somewhat at variance with his noble
  and warlike exterior.</p>

  <p>His rival, on the contrary, whose followers completely blocked up the
  entrance from the Temple, through which he had thought it becoming to arrive,
  strode into the midst with a proud and insolent bearing, scarcely deigning to
  acknowledge the salutations he received, and glancing from time to time back
  amongst his adherents, with scornful smiles, that seemed to express a fierce
  contempt for the whole proceeding. He was a man who, though scarcely past his
  youth, wore in his face the traces of his vicious and disorderly career. His
  features were flushed and swollen with intemperance; and the deep lines about
  his mouth, only half concealed by the long moustache and beard, denoted the
  existence of violent passions, indulged habitually to excess. His large
  stature and powerful frame set off the magnificence of his dress and armour,
  nor was his eye without a flash of daring and defiance that boded evil to an
  enemy; but his bearing, bold as it was, smacked rather of the outlaw than the
  soldier, and his rude, abrupt gestures contrasted disadvantageously with the
  cool self-possession of his rival. The latter, asking permission, as it were,
  of the Senate by another respectful obeisance, walked frankly into the middle
  of the court to meet his foe. John changed colour visibly, and his hand stole
  to the dagger at his belt. He seemed to expect the treachery of which he felt
  himself capable; but Eleazar, halting a full pace off, looked him steadily in
  the face, and held out his right hand in token of amity and reconciliation. A
  murmur of approval ran through the Senate, which increased John's uncertainty
  how to act; but after a moment's hesitation, unwillingly and with a bad
  grace, he gave his own in return.</p>

  <p>Eleazar's action, though apparently so frank and spontaneous, was the
  result of calculation. He had now made the impression he desired on the
  Senate, and secured the favourable hearing which he believed was alone
  necessary for his triumph.</p>

  <p>"We have been enemies," said he, releasing the other's hand and turning to
  the assembly, while his full voice rang through the whole court, and every
  syllable reached the listeners outside. "We have been fair and open enemies,
  in the belief that each was opposed to the interests of his country; but the
  privations we have now undergone in the same cause, the perils we have
  confronted side by side on the same ramparts, must have convinced us that
  however we may differ in our political tenets, nay, in our religious
  practices, we are equally sincere in a determination to shed our last drop of
  blood in the defence of the Holy City from the pollution of the heathen. This
  is no time for any consideration but one&mdash;Jerusalem is invested, the
  Temple is threatened, and the enemy at the gate. I give up all claim to
  authority, save as a leader of armed men. I yield precedence in rank, in
  council, in everything but danger. I devote my sword and my life to the
  salvation of Judaea! Who is on my side?"</p>

  <p>Loud acclamations followed this generous avowal; and it was obvious that
  Eleazar's influence was more than ever in the ascendant. It was no time for
  John to stem the torrent of popular feeling, and he wisely floated with the
  stream. Putting a strong control upon his wrath, he expressed to the Senate
  in a few hesitating words, his consent to act in unison with his rival, under
  their orders as Supreme Council of the nation; a concession which elicited
  groans and murmurs from his own partisans, many of whom forced their way with
  insolent threats and angry gestures into the court. Eleazar did not suffer
  the opportunity to escape without a fresh effort for the downfall of his
  adversary.</p>

  <p>"There are men," said he, pointing to the disaffected, and raising his
  voice in full clear tones, "who had better have swelled the ranks of the
  enemy than stood side by side with Judah on the ramparts of Agrippa's wall.
  They may be brave in battle, but it is with a fierce undisciplined courage
  more dangerous to friend than foe. Their very leader, bold and skilful
  soldier as he is, cannot restrain such mutineers even in the august presence
  of the Council. Their excesses are laid to his charge; and a worthy and
  patriotic commander becomes the scapegoat of a few ruffians whose crimes he
  is powerless to prevent. John of Gischala, we have this day exchanged the
  right hand of fellowship. We are friends, nay, we are brothers-in-arms once
  more. I call upon thee, as a brother, to dismiss these robbers, these paid
  cut-throats, whom our very enemies stigmatise as 'Sicarii,' and to cast in
  thy lot with thine own people, and with thy father's house!"</p>

  <p>John shot an eager glance from his rival to his followers. The latter were
  bending angry brows upon the speaker, and seemed sufficiently discontented
  with their own leader that he should listen tamely to such a proposal.
  Swords, too, were drawn by those in the rear, and brandished fiercely over
  the heads of the seething mass. For an instant the thought crossed his mind,
  that he had force enough to put the opposing assemblage, Senate and all, to
  the sword; but his quick practised glance taught him at the same time, that
  Eleazar's party gathered quietly towards their chief, with a confidence
  unusual in men really without arms, and a methodical precision that denoted
  previous arrangement; also that certain signals passed from them to the
  crowd, and that the court was filling rapidly from the multitude without. He
  determined then to dissemble for a time, and turned to the Senate with a far
  more deferential air than he had yet assumed.</p>

  <p>"I appeal to the elders of Judah," said he, repressing at the same time by
  a gesture the turbulence of his followers&mdash; "I am content to abide by
  the decision of the National Council. Is to-day a fitting season for the
  reduction of our armament? Shall I choose the present occasion to disband a
  body of disciplined soldiers, and turn a host of outraged and revengeful men
  loose into the city with swords in their hands? Have we not already enough
  idle mouths to feed, or can we spare a single javelin from the walls? My
  <i>brother</i>"&mdash; he laid great stress upon the word, and gripped the
  haft of his dagger under his mantle while he spoke it&mdash;"My brother gives
  strange counsel, but I am willing to believe it sincere. I too, though the
  words drop not like honey from my beard as from his, have a right to be
  heard. Did I not leave Gischala and my father's vineyard for a prey to the
  enemy? Did I not fool the whole Roman army, and mock Titus to his face, that
  I might join in the defence of Jerusalem? and shall I be schooled like an
  infant, or impeached for a traitor to-day? Judge me by the result. I was on
  the walls this morning; I saw not my brother there. The enemy were preparing
  for an assault. The engine they call Victory had been moved yet nearer by a
  hundred cubits. While we prate here the eagles are advancing. To the walls!
  To the walls, I say! Every man who calls himself a Jew; be he Priest or
  Levite, Pharisee or Sadducee, Zealot or Essene. Let us see whether John and
  his Sicarii are not as forward in the ranks of the enemy as this
  <i>brother</i> of mine, Eleazar, and the bravest he can bring!"</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, and regardless of the presence in which he stood, John drew
  his sword and placed himself at the head of his adherents, who with loud
  shouts demanded to be led instantly to the ramparts. The enthusiasm spread
  like wildfire, and even communicated itself to the Council. Eleazar's own
  friends caught the contagion, and the whole mass poured out of the Temple,
  and, forming into bands in the streets, hurried tumultuously to the
  walls.</p>

  <p>What John had stated to the Council was indeed true. The Romans, who had
  previously demolished the outer wall and a considerable portion of the
  suburbs, had now for the second time obtained possession of the second wall,
  and of the high flanking tower called Antonia, which John, to do him justice,
  had defended with great gallantry after he had retaken it once from the
  assailants. It was from this point of vantage that an attack was now
  organised by the flower of the Roman army, having for its object the
  overthrow of her last defences and complete reduction of the city. When
  Eleazar and his rival appeared with their respective bands they proved a
  welcome reinforcement to the defenders, who, despite of their stubborn
  resistance, were hardly pressed by the enemy.</p>

  <p>Every able-bodied Jew was a soldier on occasion. Troops thus composed are
  invariably more formidable in attack than defence. They have usually
  undaunted courage and a blind headlong valour that sometimes defies the
  calculations of military science or experience; but they are also susceptible
  of panic under reverses, and lack the cohesion and solidity which is only
  found in those who make warfare the profession of a lifetime. The Jew armed
  with spear and sword, uttering wild cries as he leaped to the assault, was
  nearly irresistible; but once repulsed, his final discomfiture was imminent.
  The Roman, on the contrary, never suffered himself to be drawn out of his
  ranks by unforeseen successes, and preserved the same methodical order in the
  advance as the retreat. He was not, therefore, to be lured into an ambush
  however well disguised; and even when outnumbered by a superior force, could
  retire without defeat.</p>

  <p>The constitution of the legion, too, was especially adapted to enhance the
  self-reliance of well-drilled troops. Every Roman legion was a small army in
  itself, containing its proportion of infantry, cavalry, engines of war, and
  means for conveyance of baggage. A legion finding itself never so
  unexpectedly detached from the main body, was at no loss for those
  necessaries without which an army melts away like snow in the sunshine, and
  was capable of independent action, in any country and under any
  circumstances. Each man too had perfect confidence in himself and his
  comrades; and while it was esteemed so high a disgrace to be taken prisoner
  that many soldiers have been known rather to die by their own hands than
  submit to such dishonour, it is not surprising that the imperial armies were
  often found to extricate themselves with credit from positions which would
  have ensured the destruction of any other troops in the world.</p>

  <p>The internal arrangement, too, of every cohort, a title perhaps answering
  to the modern word regiment, as does the legion to that of division, was
  calculated to promote individual intelligence and energy in the ranks. Every
  soldier not only fought, but fed, slept, marched, and toiled, under the
  immediate eye of his decurion or captain of ten, who again was directly
  responsible for those under his orders to his centurion, or captain of a
  hundred. A certain number of these centuries or companies, varying according
  to circumstances, constituted a maniple, two of which made up the cohort.
  Every legion consisted of ten cohorts, under the charge of but six tribunes,
  who seem to have entered on their onerous office in rotation. These were
  again subservient to the general, who, under the different titles of praetor,
  consul, etc., commanded the whole legion. The private soldiers were armed
  with shield, breast-plate, helmet, spear, sword, and dagger; but in addition
  to his weapons every man carried a set of intrenching tools, and on occasion
  two or more strong stakes, for the rapid erection of palisades. All were,
  indeed, robust labourers and skilful mechanics, as well as invincible
  combatants.</p>

  <p>The Jews, therefore, though a fierce and warlike nation, had but little
  chance against the conquerors of the world. It was but their characteristic
  self-devotion that enabled them to hold Titus and his legions so long in
  check. Their desperate sallies were occasionally crowned with success, and
  the generous Roman seems to have respected the valour and the misfortunes of
  his foe; but it must have been obvious to so skilful a leader, that his
  reduction of Jerusalem and eventual possession of all Judaea was a question
  only of time.</p>

  <p>At an earlier period of the siege the Romans had made a wide and shallow
  cutting capable of sheltering infantry, for the purpose of advancing their
  engines closer to the wall, but from the nature of the soil this work had
  been afterwards discontinued. It now formed a moderately-secure covered-way,
  enabling the besieged to reach within a short distance of the Tower of
  Antonia, the retaking of which was of the last importance none the less that
  from its summit Titus himself was directing the operations of his army. There
  was a breach in this tower on its inner side, which the Romans strove in vain
  to repair, harassed as they were by showers of darts and javelins from the
  enemy on the wall. More than once, in attempting to make it good at night,
  their materials had been burnt and themselves driven back upon their works
  with great loss, by the valour of the besieged. The Tower of Antonia was
  indeed the key to the possession of the second wall. Could it but be retaken,
  as it had already been, the Jews might find themselves once more with two
  strong lines of defence between the upper city and the foe.</p>

  <p>When Eleazar and John, at the head of their respective parties, now
  mingled indiscriminately together, reached the summit of the inner wall, they
  witnessed a fierce and desperate struggle in the open space below.</p>

  <p>Esca, no longer in the position of a mere household slave, but the friend
  and client of the most influential man in Jerusalem, who had admitted him,
  men said, as a proselyte to his faith, and was about to bestow on him his
  daughter in marriage, had already so distinguished himself by various feats
  of arms in the defence of the city, as to be esteemed one of the boldest
  leaders in the Jewish army. Panting to achieve a high reputation, which he
  sometimes dared to hope might gain him all he wished for on earth&mdash;the
  hand of Mariamne&mdash; and sharing to a great extent with the besieged their
  veneration for the Temple and abhorrence of a foreign yoke, the Briton lost
  no opportunity of adding a leaf to the laurels he had gained, and thrust
  himself prominently forward in every enterprise demanding an unusual amount
  of strength and courage. His lofty stature and waving golden hair, so
  conspicuous amongst the swarthy warriors who surrounded him, were soon well
  known in the ranks of the Romans, who bestowed on him the title of the Yellow
  Hostage, as inferring from his appearance that he must have lately been a
  stranger in Jerusalem; and many a stout legionary closed in more firmly on
  his comrade, and raised his shield more warily to the level of his eyes, when
  he saw those bright locks waving above the press of battle, and the long
  sword flashing with deadly strokes around that fair young head. He was now
  leading a party of chosen warriors, along the covered-way that has been
  mentioned, to attack the Tower of Antonia. For this purpose, the trench had
  been deepened during the night by the Jews themselves, who had for some days
  meditated a bold stroke of this nature; and the chosen band had good reason
  to believe that their movements were unseen and unsuspected by the enemy.</p>

  <p>As they deployed into the open space, but a few furlongs from the base of
  the tower, the Jews caught sight of Titus on the summit, his golden armour
  flashing in the sun, and, with a wild yell of triumph, they made one of their
  fierce, rushing, disorderly charges to the attack. They had reached within
  twenty paces of the breach, when swooping round the angle of the tower, like
  a falcon on his prey, came Placidus, at the head of a thousand horsemen,
  dashing forward with lifted shields and levelled spears amongst the
  disorganised mass of the Jews, broken by the very impetus of their own
  advance.</p>

  <p>The tribune had but lately joined the Roman army, having been employed in
  the subjugation of a remote province of Judaea a task for which his character
  made him a peculiarly fit instrument. Enriched by a few months of extortion
  and rapine, he had taken care to rejoin his commander in time to share with
  him the crowning triumphs of the siege. Julius Placidus was a consummate
  soldier. His vigilance had detected the meditated attack, and his science was
  prepared to meet it in the most effectual manner. Titus, from the summit of
  his tower, could not but admire the boldness and rapidity with which the
  tribune dashed from his concealment, and launched his cavalry on the
  astonished foe.</p>

  <p>But he had to do with one, who, though his inferior in skill and
  experience, was his equal in that cool hardihood which can accept and baffle
  a surprise. Esca had divided his force into two bodies, so that the second
  might advance in a dense mass to the support of the first, whether its
  disorderly attack should be attended by failure or success. This body, though
  clear of the trench, yet remaining firm in its ranks, now became a rallying
  point for its comrades, and although a vast number of the Jews were ridden
  down and speared by the attacking horsemen, there were enough left to form a
  bristling phalanx, presenting two converging fronts of level steel impervious
  to the enemy. Placidus observed the manoeuvre and ground his teeth in
  despite; but though his brow lowered for one instant, the evil smile lit up
  his face the next, for he espied Esca, detached from his band and engaged in
  rallying its stragglers; nor did he fail to recognise at a glance the man he
  most hated on earth. Urging his horse to speed, and even at that moment of
  gratified fury glancing towards the tower to see whether Titus was looking
  on, he levelled his spear and bore down upon the Briton in a desperate and
  irresistible charge. Esca stepped nimbly aside, and receiving the weapon on
  his buckler, dealt a sweeping sword-cut at the tribune's head, which stooping
  to avoid, the latter pulled at his horse's reins so vigorously as to check
  the animal's career and bring it suddenly on its haunches. The Briton,
  watching his opportunity, seized the bit in his powerful grasp, and with the
  aid of his massive weight and strength, rolled man and horse to the ground in
  a crashing fall. The tribune was undermost, and for the moment at the mercy
  of his adversary. Looking upward with a livid face and deep bitter hatred
  glaring in his eye, he did but hiss out "Oh, mine enemy!" from between his
  clenched teeth, and prepared to receive his deathblow; but the hand that was
  raised to strike, fell quietly to Esca's side, and he turned back through the
  press of horsemen, buffeting them from him as a swimmer buffets the waves,
  till he reached his own men. Placidus, rising from the ground, shook his
  clenched fist at the retreating figure; but he never knew that he owed his
  preservation to the first-fruits of that religion which had now taken root in
  the breast of his former slave. When he groaned out in his despair "Oh, mine
  enemy!" the Briton remembered that this man had, indeed, shown himself the
  bitterest and most implacable of his foes. It was no mere impulse, but the
  influence of a deep abiding principle that bade him now forgive and spare for
  the sake of One whose lessons he was beginning to learn, and in whose service
  he had resolved to enter. Amongst all the triumphs and the exploits of that
  day, there was none more noble than Esca's, when he lowered his sword and
  turned away, unwilling, indeed, but resolute, from his fallen foe.</p>

  <p>The fight raged fiercely still. Eleazar with his Zealots&mdash; John of
  Gischala with his Robbers&mdash;rushed from the walls to the assistance of
  their countrymen. The Roman force was in its turn outnumbered and surrounded,
  though Placidus, again on horseback, did all in the power of man to make head
  against the mass of his assailants. Titus at length ordered the Tenth Legion,
  called by his own name and constituting the very flower of the Roman army, to
  the rescue of their countrymen. Commanded by Licinius, in whose cool and
  steady valour they had perfect confidence, these soon turned the tide of
  combat, and forced the Jews back to their defences; not, however, until their
  general had recognised in the Yellow Hostage the person of his favourite
  slave, and thought, with a pang, that the fate of war would forbid his ever
  seeing him face to face again, except as a captive or a corpse.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-03"
     id="ch3-03">III</a>. &mdash; THE WISDOM OF THE SERPENT</h2>

  <p class="first">EVER since the night which changed the imperial master of
  Rome, Esca had dwelt with Eleazar as if he were a member of the same family
  and the same creed. Though Mariamne, according to the custom of her nation,
  confined herself chiefly to the women's apartments, it was impossible that
  two who loved each other so well as the Jewess and the Briton should reside
  under the same roof without an occasional interview. These usually took place
  when the latter returned to unarm after his military duties; and though but a
  short greeting was interchanged, a hurried inquiry, a few words of
  thanksgiving for his safety, and assurances of her continued affection, these
  moments were prized and looked forward to by both, as being the only
  occasions on which they could enjoy each other's society uninterrupted and
  alone.</p>

  <p>After the repulse of the tribune's attack beneath the Tower of Antonia,
  Esca returned in triumph to Eleazar's house. He was escorted to the very door
  by the chief men of the city, and a band of those chosen warriors who had
  witnessed and shared in his exploits. Mariamne, from the gallery which
  surrounded it, saw him enter her father's court at the head of her father's
  friends, heard that father address him before them all in a few soldierlike
  words of thanks and commendation&mdash;nay, even observed him lead the
  successful combatant away with him as though for some communication of
  unusual confidence. The girl's heart leaped within her; and vague hopes, of
  which she could not have explained the grounds, took possession of her mind.
  She loved him very dearly: they slept under the same roof, they ate at the
  same board; notwithstanding the perils of warfare to which she was now
  habituated, they met every day: but this was not enough; something was
  wanting still; so she watched him depart with her father, and grudged not the
  loss of her own short interview with its congratulations that she so longed
  to pour into his ear, because the indefinite hopes that dawned on her, seemed
  to promise more happiness than she could bear.</p>

  <p>Eleazar took the helmet from his brow, and signed to Esca to do the same.
  Then he filled a measure of wine, and draining the half of it eagerly, handed
  the rest to his companion. For a few minutes he paced up and down the room,
  still wearing his breastplate, and with his sword girded to his side, deep in
  thought, ere turning abruptly to his companion he placed his hand on his
  shoulder, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You have eaten my bread&mdash;you have drunk from my cup. Esca, you are
  to me as a son; will you do my bidding?"</p>

  <p>"Even as a son," replied the Briton; to whom such an address seemed at
  once to open the way for the fulfilment of his dearest wishes.</p>

  <p>Eleazar ignored the emphasis on the word. It may be that his mind was too
  entirely engrossed with public interests to admit a thought upon private
  affairs; it may be that he considered Esca, like the sword upon his thigh, as
  a strong and serviceable weapon, to be laid aside when no longer wanted for
  conflict; or it may be that his purpose was honest, and that, after the
  salvation of his country, he would have been actuated by the kindlier motives
  of a father and a friend; but in the meantime he had a purpose in view, and
  no considerations of affection or partiality would have led him to swerve
  from it by a hair's-breadth.</p>

  <p>"Look around you," said he. "and behold the type of Judaea, and especially
  of Jerusalem, in this very building. See how fair and stately are the walls
  of my house, how rich its ornaments, how costly its hangings and decorations.
  Here are ivory, and sandal-wood, and cedar; webs of divers colours; robes of
  purple, stores of fine linen, vessels of silver, and drinking-cups of gold;
  frankincense and wine are here in plenty, but of barley we have scarce a few
  handfuls; and if the same visitors that my father Abraham entertained on the
  plains of Mamre were at my door to-day, where should I find a kid that I
  might slay it, and set it before them to eat? I have everything here in the
  house, save that alone without which everything else is of no avail the daily
  bread that gives man strength for his daily task. And so is it with my
  country: we have men, we have weapons, we have wealth; but we lack that which
  alone renders those advantages efficient for defence the constant unshrinking
  reliance on itself and its faith, from which a nation derives its daily
  resources as from its daily bread. There are men here in the city now who
  would hand Jerusalem over to the heathen without striking another blow in her
  defence."</p>

  <p>"Shame on them!" answered the other warmly. "Barbarian, stranger as I am,
  I pledge myself to die there, ere a Roman soldier's foot shall pollute the
  threshold of the Temple."</p>

  <p>"You are a warrior," answered Eleazar; "you have proved it to-day. As a
  warrior I consult with you on the possibility of our defence. You saw the
  result of the conflict under the Tower of Antonia, and the bravery of the
  Tenth Legion; we cannot resist another such attack till our defences are
  repaired. We must gain time; at all hazards, and at any sacrifice, we must
  gain time."</p>

  <p>"In two days the breach might be strengthened," replied the other; "but
  Titus is an experienced soldier; he was watching us to-day from the summit of
  his tower. He will hardly delay the assault beyond to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"He must!" answered Eleazar vehemently. "I have my preparations for
  defence, and in less than two days the city shall be again impregnable.
  Listen, Esca; you little know the opposition I have met with, or the hatred I
  have incurred in overcoming it. I have sought means to preserve the city from
  all quarters, and have thus given a handle to my enemies that they will not
  fail to use for my destruction. Have I not taken the holy oil from the
  sacrifice, to pour boiling on the heads of the besiegers? and will not John
  of Gischala and the Robbers fling this sacrilege in my teeth when it becomes
  known? Even at this moment I have seized the small quantity of chaff there is
  yet remaining in the city, to fill the sacks with which we may neutralise the
  iron strokes of that heavy battering-ram, which the soldiers themselves call
  Victory. There is scarce a grain of wheat left, and many a hungry stomach
  must sleep to-night without even the miserable meal it had promised itself,
  for want of this poor measure of chaff. Men will curse Eleazar in their
  prayers. It is cruel work, cruel work. But, no! I will never abandon my post,
  and the seed of Jacob shall eat one another for very hunger in the streets,
  ere I deliver the Holy City into the keeping of the heathen."</p>

  <p>Something almost like a tear shone in the eye of this iron-hearted fanatic
  while he spoke, but his resolution was not to be shaken; and he only spoke
  the truth when he avowed that famine, stalking abroad in its most horrible
  form, would be a less hateful sight to him than the crest of a Roman soldier
  within the walls of Jerusalem. His brain had been hard at work on his return
  from the conflict of the day; and he had woven a plan by which he hoped to
  gain such a short respite from attack as would enable him to bid defiance to
  Titus once more. This could only be done, however, with the aid of others,
  and by means of a perfidy that even he could scarcely reconcile to
  himself&mdash;that he could not but fear must be repugnant to his agent.</p>

  <p>The well-known clemency of the Roman commander, and his earnest wish to
  spare, if it were possible, the beautiful and sacred city from destruction,
  had caused him to listen patiently at all times to any overtures made by the
  Jews for the temporary suspension of hostilities. Titus seemed not only
  averse to bloodshed, but also extended his goodwill in an extraordinary
  degree to an enemy whose religion he respected, and whose miseries obtained
  his sincere compassion. On many occasions he had delayed his orders for a
  final and probably irresistible assault, in the hope that the city might be
  surrendered; and that he could hand over to his father this beautiful prize,
  undefaced by the violence inflicted on a town taken by storm. The great Roman
  commander was not only the most skilful leader of his day, but a wise and
  far-sighted politician, as well as a humane and generous man. Eleazar knew
  the character with which he had to deal; but he stifled all scruples of
  honour in the one consideration, that his first and only duty was to the
  cause of Judah; yet in his breast were lying dormant the instincts of a brave
  man, and it was not without misgivings of opposition from his listener, that
  he disclosed to Esca the scheme by which he hoped to overreach Titus and gain
  a few hours' respite for the town.</p>

  <p>"Two days," said he, resuming his restless walk up and down the
  apartment&mdash;"two days is all I ask&mdash;all I require. Two days I
  <i>must</i> have. Listen, young man. I have proved you, I can trust you; and
  yet the safety of Judah hangs on your fidelity. Swear, by the God of Israel,
  that you will never reveal the secret I disclose to you this day. It is but
  known to my brother, my daughter, and myself. You are the adopted son of my
  house. Swear!"</p>

  <p>"I swear!" replied Esca solemnly; and his hopes grew brighter as he found
  himself thus admitted, as it were, to a place in the family of the woman he
  loved.</p>

  <p>Eleazar looked from the casement and through the door, to assure himself
  against listeners; then he filled the Briton's cup once mere, and proceeded
  with his confidences.</p>

  <p>"Around that dried-up fountain," said he, pointing to the terraces on
  which his stately house was built. "there lie seven slabs of marble, with
  which its basin is paved. If you put the point of your sword under the
  left-hand corner of the centre one, you may move it sufficiently to admit
  your hand. Lift it, and you find a staircase leading to a passage; follow
  that passage, in which a full-grown man can stand upright, and along which
  you may grope your way without fear, and you come to an egress choked up with
  a few faggots and briars. Burst through these, and, lo! you emerge beyond the
  Tower of Antonia, and within fifty paces of the Roman camp. Will you risk
  yourself amongst the enemy for Judah's sake?"</p>

  <p>"I have been nearer the Romans than fifty paces," answered Esca proudly.
  "It is no great service you ask; and if they seize upon me as an escaped
  slave, and condemn me to the cross, what then? It is but a soldier's duty I
  am undertaking after all. When shall I depart?"</p>

  <p>Eleazar reflected for a moment The other's unscrupulous, unquestioning
  fidelity touched even his fierce heart to the quick. It would be, doubtless,
  death to .the messenger, who, notwithstanding his character of herald, would
  be too surely treated as a mere runaway; but the message must be delivered,
  and who was there but Esca for him to send? He bent his brows, and proceeded
  in a harder tone&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have confided to you the secret way, that is known to but three besides
  in Jerusalem. I need keep nothing from you now. You shall bear my written
  proposals to Titus for a truce till the sun has again set twice, on certain
  terms; but those terms it will be safer for the messenger not to know. Will
  you run the risk, and when?"</p>

  <p>"This instant, if they are ready," answered the other boldly; but even
  while he spoke, Calchas entered the apartment; and Eleazar, conscious of the
  certain doom to which he was devoting his daughter's preserver and his own
  guest, shrank from his brother's eye, and would have retired to prepare his
  missive without further question.</p>

  <p>Fierce and unscrupulous as he was, he could yet feel bitterly for the
  brave, honest nature that walked so unsuspiciously into the trap he laid. It
  was one thing to overreach a hostile general, and another to sacrifice a
  faithful and devoted friend. He had no hesitation in affecting treason to
  Titus, and promising the Romans that, if they would but grant him that day
  and the next, to obtain the supremacy of his own faction and chief power
  within the walls, he would deliver over the city, with the simple condition
  that the Temple should not be demolished, and the lives of the inhabitants
  should be spared.. He acknowledged no dishonour in the determination, which
  he concealed in his own breast, to employ that interval strenuously in
  defensive works, and when it had elapsed to break faith unhesitatingly with
  his foe. In the cause of Judah&mdash;so thought this fanatic, half-soldier,
  half-priest&mdash;it was but a fair stratagem of war, and would, as a means
  of preserving the true faith, meet with the direct approval of Heaven. But it
  seemed hard&mdash;very hard&mdash; that, to secure these advantages, he must
  devote to certain destruction one who had sat at his board and lived under
  his roof for months; and a pang, of which he did not care to trace the
  origin, smote the father's heart when he thought of Mariamne's face, and her
  question to-morrow. "Where s Esca? and why is he not come back?"</p>

  <p>He took his brother aside, and told him, shortly, that Esca was going as a
  messenger of peace to the Roman camp. Calchas looked him full in the face,
  and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Brother," said he. "thy ways are tortuous, though thy bearing is warlike
  and bold. Thou trustest too much to the sword of steel and the arm of
  flesh&mdash;the might of man's strength, which a mere pebble on the pavement
  can bring headlong to the ground; and the scheming of man's brain, which
  cannot foresee, even for one instant, the trifle that shall baffle and
  confound it in the next. It is better to trust boldly in the right. This
  youth is of our own household: he is more to us than friend and kindred.
  Wouldst thou send him up with his hands bound to the sacrifice? Brother, thou
  shalt not do this great sin!"</p>

  <p>"What would you?" said Eleazar impatiently. "Every man to his duty. The
  priest to the offering; the craftsman to his labour; the soldier to the wall.
  He alone knows the secret passage. Whom have I but Esca to send?"</p>

  <p>"I am a man of peace," replied Calchas, and over his face stole that ray
  of triumphant confidence which at seasons of danger seemed to brighten it
  like a glory; "who so fitting to carry a message of peace as myself? You have
  said, everyone to his appointed task. I cannot&mdash;nay, I <i>would</i>
  not&mdash;put a breastplate on my worthless body, and a helmet on my old grey
  head, and brandish spear, or javelin, or deadly weapon in my feeble hands;
  but do you think it is because I fear? Remember, brother, the blood of the
  sons of Manahem runs in my veins as in yours, and I, too, have a right to
  risk every drop of it in the service of my country! Oh! I have sinned! I have
  sinned!" added the old man, with a burst of contrition, after this momentary
  outburst. "What am I to speak such words? I, the humblest and least worthy of
  my Master's servants!"</p>

  <p>"You shall not go!" exclaimed Eleazar, covering his face with his hands as
  the horrid results of such a mission rose before his eyes. Should the Romans
  keep the herald for a hostage, as most probably they would, until the time of
  surrender had elapsed, what must be his certain fate? Had they not already
  crucified more than one such emissary in face of the walls? and could they be
  expected to show mercy in a case like this? His love for his brother had been
  the one humanising influence of Eleazar's life. It tore his heart now with a
  grief that was something akin to rage, when he reflected that even that
  brother, if requisite, must be sacrificed to the cause of Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>Esca looked from one to the other, apparently unmoved. To him the whole
  affair seemed simply a matter of duty, in the fulfilment of which he would
  himself certainly run considerable risk, that did not extend to Calchas. He
  was perfectly willing to go; but could not, at the same time, refrain from
  thinking that the latter was the fitter person to undertake such a mission at
  such a time. He could not guess at the perfidy which Eleazar meditated, and
  which brought with it its own punishment in his present sufferings for his
  brother. "I am ready," said he quietly, resting his hand on his helmet, as
  though prepared to depart forthwith.</p>

  <p>"You shall not go," repeated Calchas, looking fixedly at his brother the
  while. "I tell thee, Eleazar," he added, with kindling eye and heightened
  tone. "that I will not stand by and see this murder done. As an escaped
  slave, Esca will be condemned to death unheard. It may be that they will even
  subject him to the scourge, and worse. As the bearer of terms for a truce,
  our enemies will treat me as an honoured guest. If thou art determined to
  persevere, I will frustrate thine intention by force. I need but whisper to
  the Sanhedrim that Eleazar is trafficking with those outside the walls, and
  where would be the house of Ben-Manahem? and how long would the Zealots own
  allegiance to their chief? Nay, brother, such discord and such measures can
  never be between thee and me. When have we differed in our lives, since we
  clung together to our mother's knees? Prepare thy missive. I will take it to
  the Roman camp forthwith, and return in safety as I went. What have I to
  fear? Am I not protected by Him whom I serve?"</p>

  <p>When Eleazar withdrew his hands from his face it was deadly pale, and
  large drops stood upon his forehead. The struggle had been cruel indeed, but
  it was over. "Jerusalem before all," was the principle from which he had
  never been known to swerve, and now he must sacrifice to it that life so much
  dearer than his own.</p>

  <p>"Be it as you will," said he, commanding himself with a strong effort;
  "you can only leave the city by our secret passage. The scroll shall be ready
  at midnight. It must be in the hand of Titus by dawn!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-04"
     id="ch3-04">IV</a>. &mdash; THE MASTERS OF THE WORLD</h2>

  <p class="first">AN hour before sunrise Calchas was stopped by one of the
  sentinels on the verge of the Roman camp. He had made his escape from the
  city, as he hoped, without arousing the suspicions of the besieged. The
  outskirts of Jerusalem were, indeed, watched almost as narrowly by its
  defenders as its assailants, for so many of the peaceful inhabitants had
  already taken refuge with the latter, and so many more were waiting their
  opportunity to fly from the horrors within the walls, and trust to the mercy
  of the conquerors without, that a strict guard had been placed by the
  national party on the different gates of the city, and all communication with
  the enemy forbidden and made punishable with death. It was no light risk,
  therefore, that Calchas took upon himself in carrying his brother's proposals
  to the Roman general.</p>

  <p>Following the high-crested centurion, who, summoned by the first sentinel
  that had challenged, offered to conduct him at once to the presence of Titus;
  the emissary, man of peace though he was, could not but admire the regularity
  of the encampment in which he found himself, and the discipline observed by
  those who occupied it. The line of tents was arranged with mathematical order
  and precision, forming a complete city of canvas, of which the principal
  street, so to speak, stretching in front of the tents occupied by the
  tribunes and other chief officers, was not less than a hundred feet wide.
  From this great thoroughfare all the others struck off at right angles,
  completing a simple figure, in which communication was unimpeded and
  confusion impossible, whilst an open space of some two hundred feet was
  preserved between the camp and the ramparts that encircled the whole. In this
  interval troops might parade, spoil and baggage be stored, or beasts of
  burden tethered, whilst its width afforded comparative security to those
  within from darts, firebrands, or other missiles of offence.</p>

  <p>If Calchas had ever dreamed of the possibility that his countrymen would
  be able to make head against the Romans, he abandoned the idea now. As he
  followed his conductor through the long white streets in which the legions
  lay at rest, he could not but observe the efficient state of that army which
  no foe had ever yet been able to resist&mdash;he could not fail to be struck
  by the brightness of the arms, piled in exact symmetry before each tent; by
  the ready obedience and cheerful respect paid by the men to their officers,
  and by the abundant supplies of food and water, contrasting painfully with
  the hunger and thirst of the besieged. Line after line he traversed in silent
  wonder, and seemed no nearer the pavilion of the general than at first; and
  he could not conceal from himself that the enemy were no less formidable to
  the Jews in their numerical superiority than in discipline, organisation, and
  all the advantages of war.</p>

  <p>His conductor halted at length in front of a large canvas dome, opposite
  to which a strong guard of the Tenth Legion were resting on their arms. At a
  sign from the centurion, two of these advanced like machines, and stood
  motionless one on each side of Calchas. Then the centurion disappeared, to
  return presently with a tribune, who, after a short investigation of the
  emissary, bade him follow, and, lifting a curtain, Calchas found himself at
  once in the presence of the Roman conqueror and his generals. As the latter
  gave way on each side, the hero advanced a step and confronted the ambassador
  from the besieged. Titus, according to custom, was fully armed, and with his
  helmet on his head. The only luxury the hardy soldier allowed himself was in
  the adornment of his weapons, which were richly inlaid with gold. Many a time
  had he nearly paid the penalty of this warlike fancy with his life; for, in
  the thick of battle, who so conspicuous as the bold prince in his golden
  armour? Who such a prize, alive or dead, as the son of Vespasian, and heir to
  the sovereignty of the world? He stood now, erect and dignified, a fitting
  representative of the mighty engine he wielded with such skill. His firm and
  well-knit frame wore its steel covering lightly and easily as a linen tunic.
  His noble features and manly bearing bore witness to the generous disposition
  and the fearless heart within; and his gestures denoted that self-reliance
  and self-respect which spring from integrity and conscious power combined. He
  looked every inch a soldier and a prince.</p>

  <p>But there was a peculiarity in the countenance of Titus which added a
  nameless charm to his frank and handsome features. With all its manly daring,
  there was yet in the depths of those keen eyes a gleam of womanly compassion
  and tenderness, that emboldened a suppliant and reassured a prisoner. There
  was a softness in the unfrequent smile that could but belong to a kindly
  guileless nature. It was the face of a man capable, not only of lofty deeds
  and daring exploits, but of gentle memories, loving thoughts, home
  affections, generosity, commiseration, and self-sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Close behind the general, affording a striking contrast in every respect
  to his chief, stood the least-trusted, but by no means the least efficient,
  of his officers. Almost the first eye that Calchas met when he entered the
  tent was that of Julius Placidus, whose services to Vespasian, though never
  thoroughly understood, had been rewarded by a high command in the Roman army.
  The most right-thinking of Caesars could not neglect the man whose energies
  had helped him to the throne; and Titus, though he saw through the character
  he thoroughly despised, was compelled to do justice to the ready courage and
  soldierlike qualities of the tribune. So Julius Placidus found himself placed
  in a position from which he could play his favourite game to advantage, and
  was still courting ambition as zealously as when he intrigued at Rome against
  Vitellius, and bargained with Hippias over a cup of wine for the murder of
  his emperor.</p>

  <p>That retired swordsman, too, was present in the tent; no longer the mere
  trainer of professional gladiators, but commanding a band that had made
  itself a name for daring at which the besieged grew pale, and which the Tenth
  Legion itself could hardly hope to emulate. After the assassination of the
  last Caesar, this host of gladiators had formed themselves into a body of
  mercenaries, with Hippias at their head, and offered their services to the
  new emperor. Under the ominous title of "The Lost Legion," these desperate
  men had distinguished themselves by entering on all such enterprises as
  promised an amount of danger to which it was hardly thought prudent to expose
  regular troops, and had gained unheard-of credit during the siege, which from
  its nature afforded them many opportunities for the display of wild and
  reckless courage. Their leader was conspicuous, even in the general's tent,
  by the lavish splendour of his arms and appointments; but, though his bearing
  was proud and martial as ever, his face had grown haggard and careworn, his
  beard was thickly sprinkled with grey. Hippias had played for the heaviest
  stakes of life boldly, and had won. He seemed to be little better off, and
  little better satisfied, than the losers in the great game.</p>

  <p>Near him stood Licinius,&mdash;staid, placid, determined; the commander of
  the Tenth Legion; the favoured councillor of Titus; the pride of the whole
  army; having all the experiences, all the advantages, all the triumphs of
  life at his feet. Alas! knowing too well what they were worth. It was a crown
  of parsley men gave the young athlete who conquered in the Isthmian Games;
  and round the unwrinkled brows that parsley was precious as gold. Later in
  life the converse holds too true, and long before the hair turns grey, all
  earthly triumphs are but empty pageantry; all crowns but withered parsley at
  the best.</p>

  <p>Titus, standing forward from amongst his officers, glanced with a look of
  pity at the worn hungry face of the messenger. Privation, nay, famine, was
  beginning to do its work even on the wealthiest of the besieged, and Calchas
  could not hide under his calm, dignified bearing, the lassitude and
  depression of physical want.</p>

  <p>"The proposal is a fair one," said the prince, turning to his assembled
  captains. "Two days' respite, and a free surrender of the city, with the
  simple condition that the holy places shall be respected, and the lives of
  the inhabitants spared. These Jews may do me the justice to remember that my
  wish throughout the war has ever been to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, and had
  they treated me with more confidence, I would long ago have shown them how
  truly I respected their Temple and their faith. It is not too late now.
  Nevertheless, illustrious friends, I called you not together so soon after
  cock-crow* for a council of war, without intending to avail myself of your
  advice. I hold in my hand a proposal from Eleazar, an influential patrician,
  as it appears, in the city, to deliver up the keys of the Great Gate, within
  forty-eight hours, provided I will pledge him my word to preserve his Temple
  from demolition, and his countrymen from slaughter; provided also, that the
  Roman army abstain during that time from all offensive measures, whatever
  preparations for resistance they may observe upon the walls. He further
  states that the city contains a large party of desperate men, who are opposed
  to all terms of capitulation, and that he must labour during these two days
  to coerce some and cajole others to his own opinion. It is a fair proposal
  enough, I repeat. The Tenth Legion is the first in seniority as in
  fame&mdash;I call upon its commander for his opinion."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The first call of the Roman trumpets in camp, about
  two hours before dawn, was distinguished by that name. ]</p>

  <p>Licinius, thus appealed to, earnestly advised that any terms which might
  put an end to the loss of life on both sides, should be entertained from
  motives of policy as well as humanity.</p>

  <p>"I speak not," said the general. "for myself or my legion. Our discipline
  is unshaken, our supplies are regular, our men have been inured by long
  campaigning to a Syrian climate and a Syrian sun. We have lost comparatively
  few from hardships or disease. But no commander knows better than Titus, how
  an army in the field melts by the mere influence of time, and the difference
  that a few weeks can make in its efficiency and numerical strength is the
  difference between victory and defeat. Other divisions have not been so
  fortunate as my own. I will put it to the leader of the Lost Legion, how many
  men he could march to-day to the assault?"</p>

  <p>Hippias stroked his beard gravely, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Had I been asked the question five days ago," said he frankly. "I could
  have answered a thousand. Had I been asked it yesterday, seven hundred. Great
  prince, at noon, to-day, I must be content to muster five hundred swordsmen.
  Nevertheless," he added, with something of his old abrupt manner. "not one of
  them but claims his privilege of leading the other cohorts to the
  breach.!"</p>

  <p>It was too true that the influence of climate, acting upon men disposed to
  intemperance in pleasure, added to the severity of their peculiar service,
  had reduced the original number of the gladiators by one half. The remnant,
  however, were still actuated, like their commander, by the fierce reckless
  spirit of the amphitheatre. Titus, looking from one to the other, pondered
  for a few moments in earnest thought, and Placidus, seizing the opportunity,
  broke in with his smooth courteous tones.</p>

  <p>"It is not for me," said he. "to differ with such illustrious leaders as
  those who have just spoken. The empire has long acknowledged Licinius as one
  of her bravest commanders; and Hippias the gladiator lives but in his natural
  element of war. Still, my first duty is to Caesar and to Rome. Great prince,
  when a short while ago you bade a noble Jewish captive address his countrymen
  on the wall, what was the result? They knew him to be a patrician of their
  oldest blood, and, I believe, a priest also of their own superstitions. They
  had proved him a skilful general, and I myself speak of him without rancour,
  though he foiled me before Jotapata. Till taken prisoner by Vespasian Caesar,
  he had been their staunchest patriot and their boldest leader. When he
  addressed them, notwithstanding the length of his appeal, they had no reason
  but to believe him sincere. And what, I say, was the result? A few hours
  gained for resistance; a fiercer defiance flung at Rome; a more savage
  cruelty displayed towards her troops. I would not trust them, prince. This
  very proposal may be but a stratagem to gain time. The attack of yesterday,
  covered by my cavalry, must have shaken them shrewdly. Probably their stores
  are exhausted. The very phalanx that opposed us so stubbornly looked gaunt
  and grim as wolves. Observe this very emissary from the most powerful man in
  Jerusalem. Is there not famine in his hollow cheeks and sunken eyes? Give him
  to eat. See how his visage brightens at the very name of food! Give him to
  eat, now, in presence of the council of war, and judge by his avidity of the
  privations he has endured behind the walls."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" exclaimed Titus indignantly; "hold, tribune, and learn, if you
  have one generous feeling left, to respect misfortune, most of all when you
  behold it in the person of your enemy. This venerable man shall indeed be
  supplied with wine and food; but he shall not be insulted in my camp by
  feeling that his sufferings are gauged as the test of his truth. Licinius, my
  old and trusty counsellor, my very instructor in the art of war, I confide
  him to your care. Take him with you to your tent; see that he wants for
  nothing. I need not remind you to treat an enemy with all the kindness and
  courtesy compatible with the caution of a soldier. But you must not lose
  sight of him for a moment, and you will send him back with my answer under a
  strong guard to the chief gate of Jerusalem. I will have no underhand
  dealings with this unhappy people; though much, I fear, my duty to my father
  and the empire will not permit me to grant them the interval of repose that
  they desire. This is for my consideration. I have taken your opinions, for
  which I thank you. I reserve to myself the option of being guided by them.
  Friends and comrades, you are dismissed. Let this man be forthcoming in an
  hour, to take my answer back to those who sent him. <i>Vale</i>!"</p>

  <p><i>Vale!</i> repeated each officer, as he bowed and passed out of the
  tent.</p>

  <p>Hippias and Placidus lingered somewhat behind the rest, and halting when
  out of hearing of the sentinel who guarded the eagles planted before the
  commander's quarters, or Praetorium, as it was called, looked in each other's
  faces, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"You put it pointedly," said the former, "and took an ugly thrust in
  return. Nevertheless, the assault will be delayed after all, and my poor
  harmless lambs will scarce muster in enough force to be permitted to lead the
  attack."</p>

  <p>"Fear not," replied the tribune; "it will take place to-morrow. It would
  suit neither your game nor mine, my Hippias, to make a peaceable entry by the
  Great Gate, march in order of battle to the Temple, and satisfy ourselves
  with a stare at its flashing golden roof. I can hardly stave off my
  creditors. You can scarce pay your men. Had it not been for the prospect of
  sacking the Holy Place, neither of us would have been to-day under a heavy
  breastplate in this scorching sun. And we <i>shall</i> sack it, I tell you,
  never fear."</p>

  <p>"You think so?" said the other doubtfully; "and yet the prince spoke very
  sternly, as if he not only differed with you, but disapproved of your
  counsel. I am glad I was not in your place; I should have been tempted to
  answer even the son of Vespasian."</p>

  <p>The tribune laughed gaily once more. "Trifles," said he; "I have the hide
  of a rhinoceros when it is but a question of looks and words, however stern
  and biting they may be. Besides, do you not yet know this cub of the old
  lion? The royal beast is always the same; dangerous when his hair is rubbed
  the wrong way. Titus was only angry because his better judgment opposed his
  inclinations, and agreed with me&mdash;me to whom he pays the compliment of
  his dislike. I tell you we shall give the assault before two days are out,
  with my cohort swarming on the flanks, and thy Lost Legion, my Hippias,
  maddening to the front. So now for a draught of wine and a robe of linen,
  even though it be under one of these suffocating tents. I think when once the
  siege is over and the place taken, I shall never buckle on a breastplate
  again."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-05"
     id="ch3-05">V</a>. &mdash; GLAD TIDINGS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE eye of Calchas did indeed brighten, and his colour went
  and came when food was placed before him in the Roman general's tent. It was
  with a strong effort that he controlled and stifled the cravings of hunger,
  never so painful as when the body has been brought down by slow degrees to
  exist on the smallest possible quantity of nourishment. It was long since a
  full meal had been spread even on Eleazar's table; and the sufferings from
  famine of the poorer classes in Jerusalem had reached a pitch unheard-of in
  the history of nations. Licinius could not but admire the self-control with
  which his guest partook of his hospitality. The old man was resolved not to
  betray, in his own person, the straits of the besieged. It was a staunch and
  soldierlike sentiment to which the Roman was keenly alive, and Licinius
  turned his back upon his charge, affecting to give long directions to some of
  his centurions from the tent-door, in order to afford Calchas the opportunity
  of satisfying his hunger unobserved.</p>

  <p>After a while, the general seated himself inside, courteously desiring his
  guest to do the same. A decurion, with his spearmen, stood at the entrance,
  under the standard where the eagles of the Tenth Legion hovered over his
  shining crest. The sun was blazing fiercely down on the white lines of canvas
  that stretched in long perspective on every side, and flashing back at stated
  intervals from shield, and helm, and breastplate, piled in exact array at
  each tent-door. It was too early in the year for the crackling locust; and
  every trace of life, as of vegetation, had disappeared from the parched
  surface of the soil, burnished and slippery with the intense heat. It was an
  hour of lassitude and repose even in the beleaguering camp, and scarce a
  sound broke the drowsy stillness of noon, save the stamp and snort of a
  tethered steed, or the scream of an ill-tempered mule. Scorched without, and
  stifled within, even the well-disciplined legionary loathed his canvas
  shelter; longing, yearning vainly in his day-dreams for the breeze of cool
  Praeneste, and the shades of darkling Tibur, and the north wind blowing
  through the holm-oaks off the crest of the snowy Apennines.</p>

  <p>In the general's pavilion the awning had been raised a cubit from the
  ground, to admit what little air there was, so faint as scarce to stir the
  fringe upon his tunic. Against the pole that propped the soldier's home,
  rested a mule's pack-saddle, and a spare breastplate. On the wooden frame
  which served him for a bed, lay the general's tablets, and a sketch of the
  Tower of Antonia. A simple earthenware dish contained the food offered to his
  guest, and, like the coarse clay vessel into which a wineskin had been
  poured, was nearly empty. Licinius sat with his helmet off, but otherwise
  completely armed. Calchas, robed in his long dark mantle, fixed his mild eye
  steadily on his host.</p>

  <p>The man of war and the man of peace seemed to have some engrossing
  thought, some all-important interest in common. For a while they conversed on
  light and trivial topics, the discipline of the camp, the fertility of Syria,
  the distance from Rome, and the different regions in which her armies fought
  and conquered. Then Licinius broke through his reserve, and spoke out freely
  to his guest.</p>

  <p>"You have a hero," said the Roman. "in your ranks, of whom I would fain
  learn something, loving him as I do like a son. Our men call him the Yellow
  Hostage; and there is not a warrior among all the brave champions of
  Jerusalem whom they regard with such admiration and dread. I myself saw him
  but yesterday save your whole army from destruction beneath the walls."</p>

  <p>"It is Esca!" exclaimed Calchas. "Esca, once a chief in Britain, and
  afterwards your slave in Rome."</p>

  <p>"The same," answered Licinius; "and, though a slave, the noblest and the
  bravest of men. A chief, you say, in Britain. What know you of him? He never
  told me who he was, or whence he came."</p>

  <p>"I know him," replied Calchas. "as one who lives with us like a kinsman,
  who takes his share of hardship, and far more than his share of danger, as
  though he were a very chief in Israel&mdash;who is to me, indeed, and those
  dearest to me, far more precious than a son. We escaped together from
  Rome&mdash;my brother, my brother's child, and this young Briton. Many a
  night on the smooth Aegean has he told me of his infancy, his youth, his
  manhood, the defence his people made against your soldiers, the cruel
  stratagems by which they were foiled and overcome, how nobly he himself had
  braved the legions; and yet how the first lessons he learned in childhood
  were to feel kindly for the invader, how the first accents his mother taught
  him were in the Roman tongue."</p>

  <p>"It is strange," observed Licinius, musing deeply, and answering, as it
  seemed, his own thought. "Strange lesson for one of that nation to learn.
  Strange, too, that fate seems to have posted him continually in arms against
  the conqueror."</p>

  <p>"They were his mother's lessons," resumed Calchas; "and that mother he has
  not forgotten even to-day. He loves to speak of her as though she could see
  him still. And who shall say she cannot? He loves to tell of her stately
  form, her fond eyes, and her gentle brow, with its lines of thought and care.
  He says she had some deep sorrow in her youth, which her child suspected, but
  of which she never spoke. It taught her to be kind and patient with all; it
  made her none the less loving for her boy. Ay, 'tis the same tale in every
  nation and under every sky. The garment has not yet been woven in which the
  black hank of sin and sorrow does not cross and recross throughout the whole
  web. She had her burden to bear, and so has Esca, and so hast thou, great
  Roman commander, one of the conquerors of the earth; and so have I, but I
  know where to lay mine down, and rest in peace."</p>

  <p>"They are a noble race, these women of Britain," said Licinius, following
  out the thread of his own thoughts with a heavy heart, on which one of them
  had impressed her image so deeply, that while it beat, a memory would reign
  there, as it had reigned already for years, undisturbed by a living rival.
  "And so the boy loves to talk of his childhood, and his lost
  mother&mdash;lost," he added bitterly, "surely lost, because so loved!"</p>

  <p>"Even so," replied Calchas; "and deep as was the child's grief, it carried
  a sharper sting from the manner of her death. Too young to bear arms, he had
  seen his father hurry away at the head of his tribe to meet the Roman
  legions. His father, a fierce, imperious warrior, of whom he knew but little,
  and whom he would have dreaded rather than loved, had the boy dreaded
  anything on earth. His mother lay on a bed of sickness; and even the child
  felt a nameless fear on her account, that forbade him to leave her side. With
  pain and difficulty they moved her on her litter to a fastness in their deep,
  tangled forests, where the Britons made a last stand. Then certain
  long-bearded priests took him by force from his mother's side, and hid him
  away in a cavern, because he was a chiefs son. He can recall now the pale
  face and the loving eyes, turned on him in a last look, as he was borne off
  struggling and fighting like a young wolf-cub. From his cavern he heard
  plainly the shouts of battle and the very clash of steel; but he heeded them
  not, for a vague and sickening dread had come over him that he should see his
  mother no more. It was even so. They hurried the child from his refuge by
  night. They never halted till the Sun had risen and set again. Then they
  spoke to him with kind, soothing words; but when he turned from them, and
  called for his mother, they told him she was dead. They had not even paid her
  the last tribute of respect. While they closed her eyes, the legions had
  already forced their rude defences; her few attendants fled for their lives,
  and the high-born Guenebra was left in the lonely hut wherein she died, to
  the mercy of the conquerors."</p>

  <p>When Calchas ceased speaking, he saw that his listener had turned ghastly
  pale, and that the sweat was standing on his brow. His strong frame, too,
  shook till his armour rattled. He rose and crossed to the tent-door as if for
  air, then turned to his guest, and spoke in a low but steady voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I knew it," said he " I knew it must be so; this Esca is the son of one
  whom I met in my youth, and why should I be ashamed to confess it? whose
  influence has pervaded my whole life. I am old and grey now. Look at me; what
  have such as I to do with the foolish hopes and fears that quicken the young
  fresh heart, and flush the unwrinkled cheek? But now, to-day, I tell thee,
  warworn and saddened as I am, it seems to me that the cup of life has been
  but offered, and dashed cruelly away ere it had so much as cooled my thirsty
  lips. Why should I have known happiness, only to be mocked by its want? What!
  thou hast a human heart? Thou art a brave man, too, though thy robes denote a
  vocation of peace, else thou hadst not been here to-day in the heart of an
  enemy's camp. Need I tell thee, that when I entered that rude hut in the
  Briton's stronghold, and saw all I loved on earth stretched cold and
  inanimate on her litter at my feet, had I not been a soldier of Rome my own
  good sword had been my consolation, and I had fallen by her there, to be laid
  in the same grave; and now I shall never see her more!" He passed his hand
  across his face, and added, in a broken whisper. "Never more! never
  more!"</p>

  <p>"You cannot think so. You cannot believe in such utter desolation,"
  exclaimed Calchas, roused like some old warhorse by the trumpet sound, as he
  saw the task assigned him, and recognised yet another traveller on the great
  road, whom he could guide home.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that you or she, or any one of us, were made to suffer, and
  to cause others suffering&mdash;to strive and fail, and long and sorrow, for
  a little while, only to drop into the grave at last, like an over-ripe fig
  from its branch, and be forgotten? Do you think that life is to end for you,
  or for me, when the one falls in his armour, at the head of the Tenth Legion,
  pierced by a Jewish javelin, or the other is crucified before the walls for a
  spy, by Titus, or stoned in the gate for a traitor, by his own countrymen?
  And this is the fate which may await us both before to-morrow's sun is set.
  Believe it not, noble Roman! That frame of yours is no more Licinius than is
  the battered breastplate yonder on the ground, which you have cast aside
  because it is no longer proof against sword and spear; the man himself leaves
  his worn-out robe behind, and goes rejoicing on his journey the journey that
  is to lead him to his home elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"And where?" asked the Roman, interested by the earnestness of his guest,
  and the evident conviction with which he spoke. "Is it the home to which, as
  our own poets have said, good Aeneas, and Tullus, and Ancus have gone before?
  the home of which some philosophers have dreamed, and at which others
  laugh&mdash;a phantom-land, a fleeting pageant, impalpable plains beyond a
  shadowy river? These are but dreams, the idle visions of men of thought. What
  have we, who are the men of action, to do with aught but reality?"</p>

  <p>"And what is reality?" replied Calchas. "Is it without or within? Look
  from your own tent-door, noble Roman, and behold the glorious array that
  meets your eye&mdash;the even camp, the crested legionaries, the eagles, the
  trophies, and the piles of arms. Beyond, the towers and pinnacles of
  Jerusalem, and the white dome of the Temple with its dazzling roof of gold.
  Far away, the purple hills of Moab looking over the plains of the Dead Sea.
  It is a world of beautiful reality. There cometh a flash from a thunder-cloud
  or an arrow off the wall, and your life is spared, but your eyesight is gone:
  which is the reality now, the light or the darkness? the wide expanse of
  glittering sunshine, or the smarting pain and the black night within? So is
  it with life and death. Titus in his golden armour, Vespasian on the throne
  of the Caesars, that stalwart soldier leaning yonder on his spear, or the
  wasted captive dying for hunger in the town&mdash;are they beings of the same
  kind? and why are their shares so unequal in the common lot? Because it
  matters so little what may be the different illusions that deceive us now,
  when all may attain equally to the same reality at last."</p>

  <p>Licinius pondered for a few minutes ere he replied. Like many another
  thinking heathen, he had often speculated on the great question which forces
  itself at times on every reflective being. "Why are these things so?" He,
  too, had been struck ere now with the obvious discrepancy between man's
  aspirations and his efforts&mdash;the unaccountable caprices of fortune, the
  apparent injustice of fate. He had begun life in the bold confidence of an
  energetic character, believing all things possible to the resolute strength
  and courage of manhood. When he failed, he blamed himself with something of
  contempt; when he succeeded, he gathered fresh confidence in his own powers
  and in the truth of his theories. But in the pride of youth and happiness,
  sorrow took him by the hand, and taught him the bitter lesson that it is good
  to learn early rather than late; because, until the plough has passed over
  it, there can be no real fertility, no healthy produce on the untilled soil.
  The deeper they are scored, the heavier is the harvest from these furrows of
  the heart. Licinius, in the prime of life, and on the pinnacle of success,
  became a thoughtful, because a lonely and disappointed, man. He saw the
  complications around him; he acknowledged his inability to comprehend them.
  While others thought him so strong and self-reliant, he knew his own weakness
  and his own need; the broken spirit was humble and docile as a child's.</p>

  <p>"There must be a <i>reason</i> for everything," he exclaimed at last;
  "there must be a clue in the labyrinth, if a man's hand could only find it.
  What is truth? say our philosophers. Oh, that I did but know!"</p>

  <p>Then, in the warlike tent, in the heart of the conquering army, the Jew
  imparted to the Roman that precious wisdom to which all other learning is but
  an entrance and a path. Under the very shadow of the eagles that were
  gathered to devastate his city, the man to whom all vicissitudes were alike,
  to whom all was good, because he knew " what was truth," showed to his
  brother, whose sword was even then sharpened for the destruction of his
  people, that talisman which gave him the mastery over all created things:
  which made him superior to hunger and thirst, pain and sorrow, insult,
  dishonour, and death. It is something, even in this world, to wear a suit of
  impenetrable armour, such as is provided for the weakest and the lowest who
  enter the service that requires so little and that grants so much. Licinius
  listened eagerly, greedily, as a blind man would listen to one who taught him
  how to recover his sight Gladdening was the certainty of a future to one who
  had hitherto lived so mournfully in the past Fresh and beautiful was the
  rising edifice of hope to one whose eye was dull with looking on the grey
  ruins of regret There was comfort for him, there was encouragement, there was
  example. When Calchas told, in simple, earnest words, all that he himself had
  heard and seen of glorious self-sacrifice, of infinite compassion, and of
  priceless ransom, the soldier's knee was bent, and his eyes were wet with
  tears.</p>

  <p>By the orders of his commander, Licinius conducted his guest back to the
  Great Gate of Jerusalem with all the customary honours paid to an ambassador
  from a hostile power. He bore the answer of Titus, granting to the besieged
  the respite they desired. Placidus had been so far right that the prince's
  better judgment condemned the ill-timed reprieve; but in this, as in many
  other instances, Titus suffered his clemency to prevail over his experience
  in Jewish duplicity and his anxiety to terminate the war.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-06"
     id="ch3-06">VI</a>. &mdash; WINE ON THE LEES</h2>

  <p class="first">THE commander of the Lost Legion, when he parted with
  Placidus after the council of war, retired moodily to his tent. He, too, was
  disappointed and dissatisfied, wearied with the length of the siege, harassed
  and uneasy about the ravages made by sickness among his men, and anxious
  moreover as to his share of the spoil. Hippias, it is needless to say, was
  lavish in his expenses, and luxurious in his personal habits: like the
  mercenaries he commanded, he looked to the sacking of Jerusalem as a means of
  paying his creditors, and supplying him with money for future excesses. Not a
  man of the Lost Legion but had already calculated the worth of that golden
  roof, to which they looked so longingly, and his own probable portion when it
  was melted into coin. Rumour, too, had not failed to multiply by tens the
  amount of wealth stored in the Temple, and the jewels it contained. The
  besiegers were persuaded that every soldier who should be fortunate enough to
  enter it sword in hand, would be enriched for life; and the gladiators were
  the last men to grudge danger or bloodshed for such an object.</p>

  <p>But there is a foe who smites an army far more surely than the enemy that
  meets it face to face in the field. Like the angel who breathed on the host
  of the Assyrians in the night, so that when the Jews rose in the morning,
  their adversaries were " all dead men," this foe takes his prey by scores as
  they sleep in their tents, or pace to and fro watching under their armour in
  the sun. His name is Pestilence; and wherever man meets man for mutual
  destruction, he hovers over the opposing multitudes, and secures the lion's
  share of both. Partly from their previous habits, partly from their looser
  discipline, he had been busier amongst the gladiators than in any other
  quarter of the camp. Dwindling day by day in numbers and efficiency, Hippias
  began to fear that they would be unable to take the prominent part he had
  promised them in the assault, and the chance of such a disappointment was
  irritating enough; but when to this grievance was added the proposal he had
  just heard, for the peaceful surrender of the city&mdash;a proposal which
  Titus seemed to regard with favourable eyes, and which would entail the
  distribution in equal portions of whatever treasure was considered the spoil
  of the army, so that the gladiator and legionary should but share alike the
  contingency was nothing less than maddening. He had given Titus a true report
  of his legion in council; for Hippias was not a man to take shelter in
  falsehood, under any pressure of necessity, but he repented, nevertheless, of
  his frankness; and, cursing the hour when he embarked for Syria, began to
  think of Rome with regret, and to believe that he was happier and more
  prosperous in the amphitheatre after all. Passing amongst the tents of his
  men, he was distressed to meet old Hirpinus, who reported to him that another
  score had been stricken by the sickness since watch-setting the previous
  night. Every day was of the utmost importance now, and here were two more to
  be wasted in negotiations, even if the assault should be ordered to take
  place after all. The reflection did not serve to soothe him, and Hippias
  entered his own tent with a fevered frame, and a frown of ill-omen on his
  brow.</p>

  <p>For a soldier it was indeed a luxurious home; adorned with trophies of
  arms, costly shawls, gold and silver drinking-vessels, and other valuables
  scattered about. There was even a porcelain vase filled with fresh flowers
  standing between two wineskins; and a burnished mirror, with a delicate comb
  resting against its stand, denoted either an extraordinary care for his
  personal appearance in the owner, or a woman's presence behind the crimson
  curtain which served to screen another compartment of the tent. Kicking the
  mirror out of his way, and flinging himself on a couch covered with a dressed
  leopard-skin, Hippias set his heavy headpiece on the ground, and called
  angrily for a cup of wine. At the second summons, the curtain was drawn
  aside, and a woman appeared from behind its folds.</p>

  <p>Pale, haughty, and self-possessed, tameless, and defiant, even in her
  degradation, Valeria, though fallen, seemed to rise superior to herself, and
  stood before the man whom she had never loved, and yet to whom, in a moment
  of madness, she had sacrificed her whole existence, with the calm, quiet
  demeanour of a mistress in the presence of her slave. Her beauty had not
  faded&mdash;far from it&mdash;though changed somewhat in its character,
  growing harder and colder than of old. If less womanly, it was of a deeper
  and loftier kind. The eyes, indeed, had lost the loving, laughing look which
  had once been their greatest charm, but they were keen and dazzling still;
  while the other features, like the shapely figure, had gained a severe and
  majestic dignity in exchange for the flowing outlines and the round
  comeliness of youth. She was dressed sumptuously, and with an affectation of
  Eastern habits that suited her beauty well. Alas! that beauty was her only
  weapon left; and although she had turned it against herself, a true woman to
  the end, she had kept it bright and pointed still.</p>

  <p>When Valeria left her home to follow the fortunes of a gladiator, she had
  not even the excuse of blindness for her folly. She knew that she was
  abandoning friends, fortune, position&mdash;all the advantages of life for
  that which she did not care to have. She believed herself to be utterly
  desperate, depraved, and unsexed. It was her punishment that she could not
  rid herself of her woman's nature, nor stifle the voice that no woman ever
  <i>can</i> stifle in her heart. For a time, perhaps, the change of scene, the
  voyage, the excitement of the step she had taken, the determination to abide
  by her choice and defy everything, served to deaden her mind to her own
  misery. It was her whim to assume on occasions the arms and accoutrements of
  a gladiator; and it was even said in the Lost Legion, that she had fought in
  their ranks more than once in some of their desperate enterprises against the
  town. It was certain that she never appeared abroad in the female dress she
  wore within her tent: Titus, indeed, would have scarcely failed to notice
  such a flagrant breach of camp-discipline; and many a fierce swordsman
  whispered to his comrade, with a thrill of interest, that in a force like
  theirs she might mingle unnoticed in their ranks, and be with them at any
  time. It was but a whisper, though, after all, for they knew their commander
  too well to canvass his conduct openly, or to pry into matters he chose to
  keep secret.</p>

  <p>These outbreaks, however, so contrary to all the impulses and instincts of
  a woman's nature, soon palled on the high-born Roman lady; and as the siege,
  with its various fortunes, was protracted from day to day, the yoke under
  which she had voluntarily placed her proud white neck, became too galling to
  endure. She hated the long glistening line of tents; she hated the scorching
  Syrian sky, the flash of armour, the tramp of men, the constant
  trumpet-calls, the eternal guard-mounting, the wearisome and monotonous
  routine of a camp. She hated the hot tent, with its stifling atmosphere and
  its narrow space; above all, she was learning daily to hate the man with whom
  she shared its shelter and its inconveniences.</p>

  <p>She handed him the wine he asked for without a word, and standing there in
  her cold scornful beauty, never noticed him by look or gesture. She seemed
  miles away in thought, and utterly unconscious of his presence.</p>

  <p>He remembered when it was so different. He remembered how, even when first
  he knew her, his arrival used to call a smile of pleasure to her lips, a
  glance of welcome to her eye. It might be only on the surface, but still it
  was there; and he felt for his own part, that as far as he had ever cared for
  any woman, he had cared for her. It was galling, truly, this indifference,
  this contempt. He was hurt, and his fierce undisciplined nature urged him to
  strike again.</p>

  <p>He emptied the cup, and flung it from him with an angry jerk. The golden
  vessel rolled out from under the hangings of the tent; she made no offer to
  pick it up and fetch it back. He glared fiercely into her eyes, and they met
  his own with the steady scornful gaze he almost feared; for that cold look
  chilled him to the very heart. The man was hardened, depraved, steeped to the
  lips in cruelty and crime; but there was a defenceless place in him still
  that she could stab when she liked, for he would have loved her if she had
  let him.</p>

  <p>"I am very weary of the siege," said he, stretching his limbs on the couch
  with affected indifference, "weary of the daily drudgery, the endless
  consultations, the scorching climate, above all, this suffocating atmosphere,
  where a man can hardly breathe. Would that I had never seen this accursed
  tent, or aught that it contains!"</p>

  <p>"You cannot be more weary of it than I am," she replied, in the same
  contemptuous quiet tone that maddened him.</p>

  <p>"Why did you come?" he retorted, with a bitter laugh. "Nobody wanted such
  a delicate dainty lady in a soldier's tent&mdash;and certainly nobody ever
  asked you to share it with him!"</p>

  <p>She gave a little gasp, as though something touched her to the quick, but
  recovered herself on the instant, and answered calmly and scornfully. "It is
  kindly said, and generously, considering all things. Just what I might have
  expected from a gladiator!"</p>

  <p>"There was a time you liked the Family well enough!" he exclaimed angrily;
  and then, softened by his own recollections of that time, added in a milder
  tone. "Valeria, why will you thus quarrel with me? It used not to be so when
  I brought the foils and dumbbells to your portico, and spared no pains to
  make you the deadliest fencer, as you were the fairest, in Rome. Those were
  happy days enough, and so might these be, if you had but a grain of common
  sense. Can you not see, when you and I fall out, who must necessarily be the
  loser? What have you to depend on now but me?"</p>

  <p>He should have stopped at his tender recollections. Argument, especially
  if it has any show of reason in it, is to an angry woman but as the
  <i>bandillero's</i> goad to the Iberian bull. Its flutter serves to irritate
  rather than to scare, and the deeper its pointed steel sinks in, the more
  actively indeed does the recipient swerve aside, but returns the more rapidly
  and the more obstinately to the charge. Of all considerations, that which
  most maddened Valeria, and rendered her utterly reckless, was that she should
  be dependent on a gladiator. The cold eyes flashed fire; but she would not
  give him the advantage over her of acknowledging that he could put her in a
  passion, so she restrained herself, though her heart was ready to burst Had
  she cared for him she might have stabbed him to death in such a mood.</p>

  <p>"I thank you for reminding me," she answered bitterly. "It is not strange
  that one of the Mutian line should occasionally forget her duty to Hippias,
  the retired prize-fighter. A patrician, perhaps, would have brought it more
  delicately to her remembrance; but I have no right to blame the
  fencing-master for his plebeian birth and bringing up."</p>

  <p>"Now, by the body of Hercules, this is too much!" he exclaimed, springing
  erect on the couch, and grinding his teeth with rage. "What! you tax me with
  my birth! You scout me for my want of mincing manners and white hands, and
  syllables that drop like slobbered wine from the close-shaven lip! You, the
  dainty lady, the celebrated beauty, the admired, forsooth, of all admirers,
  whose porch was choked with gilded chariots, whose litter was thronged with
  every curly-headed, white-shouldered, crimson-cloaked, young Narcissus in
  Rome, and yet who sought her chosen lovers in the amphitheatre&mdash;who
  scanned with judicious eye the points and the vigour and the promise of naked
  athletes, and could find at last none to serve her turn, but war-worn old
  Hippias, the roughest and the rudest, and the worst-favoured, but the
  strongest, nevertheless, amongst them all!"</p>

  <p>The storm was gathering apace, but she still tried hard to keep it down.
  An experienced mariner might have known by the short-coming breath, the white
  cheek,and the dilated nostril, that it was high time to shorten sail, and run
  for shelter before the squall.</p>

  <p>"It was indeed a strange taste," she retorted. "None can marvel at it more
  than myself."</p>

  <p>"Not so strange as you think," he burst out, somewhat inconsistently. "Do
  not fancy you were the only lady in Rome who was proud to be admired by
  Hippias the gladiator. I tell you I had my choice amongst ,a hundred maids
  and matrons, nobler born, fairer, ay, and of better repute than yourself! any
  one of whom would have been glad to be here to-day in your place. I was a
  fool for my pains; but I thought you were the fittest to bear the toil of
  campaigning, and the least able to do without me, so I took you, more out of
  pity than of love!"</p>

  <p>"Coward!" she hissed between her clenched teeth. "Traitor and fool, too!
  Must you know the truth at last? Must you know what I have spared you this
  long time? what alone has kept me from sinking under the weight of these
  weary days with their hourly degradation? what has been disease and remedy,
  wound and balm, bitterest punishment, and yet dearest consolation? Take it
  then, since have it you will! Can you think that such as I could ever love
  such as you? Can you believe you could be more to Valeria than the handle of
  the blade, the shaft of the javelin, the cord of the bow, by which she could
  inflict a grievous wound in another's bosom? Listen! When you wooed me, I was
  a scorned, an insulted, a desperate woman. I loved one who was nobler,
  handsomer, better. Ay, you pride yourself on your fierce courage and your
  brutal strength. I tell you who was twice as strong, and a thousand times as
  brave as the best of you. I loved him, do you hear? as men like you never can
  be loved&mdash;with an utter and entire devotion, that asked but to sacrifice
  itself without hope of a return, and he scorned me, not as you would have
  done, with a rough brutal frankness that had taken away half the pain, but so
  kindly, so delicately, so generously, that even while I clung to him, and he
  turned away from me, I felt he was dearer than ever to my heart. Ay, you may
  sit there and look at me with your eyes glaring and your beard bristling like
  some savage beast of prey; but you brought it on yourself, and if you killed
  me I would not spare you now. I had never <i>looked</i> at you but for your
  hired skill, which you imparted to the man I loved. I took you because he
  scorned me, as I would have taken one of my Liburnians, had I thought it
  would have wounded him deeper, or made him hate me more. You are a fencer, I
  believe&mdash; one who prides himself on his skill in feints and parries, in
  giving and taking, in judging accurately of the adversary's strength and
  weakness at a glance. Have I foiled you to some purpose? You thought you were
  the darling of the high-born lady, the favourite of her fancy, the minion to
  whom she could refuse nothing, not even her fair fame, and she was using you
  all the time as a mere rod with which to smite a slave! A <i>slave</i>, do
  you hear? Yes, the man I preferred, not only to you, but to a host of your
  betters, the man I loved so dearly, and love so madly still, is but your
  pupil Esca, a barbarian, and a slave!"</p>

  <p>Her anger had supported her till now, but with Esca's name came a flood of
  tears, and, thoroughly unstrung, she sat down on the ground and wept
  passionately, covering her face with her hands. He could have almost found it
  in his heart to strike her, but for her defenceless attitude, so exasperated
  was he, so maddened by the torrent of her words. He could think of nothing,
  however, more bitter than to taunt her with her helplessness, whilst under
  his charge.</p>

  <p>"Your minion," said he, "is within the walls at this moment. From that
  tent door, you might almost see him on the rampart, if he be not skulking
  from his duty like a slave as he is. Think, proud lady, you who are so ready,
  asked or unasked, for slave or gladiator, you need but walk five hundred
  paces to be in his arms. Surely, if they knew your mission, Roman guards and
  Jewish sentries would lower their spears to you as you passed! Enough of
  this! Remember who and what you are. Above all, remember <i>where</i> you
  are, and how you came here. I have forborne too long, my patience is
  exhausted at last. You are in a soldier's tent, and you must learn a
  soldier's duty&mdash;unquestioning obedience. Go! pick up that goblet I let
  fall just now. Fill it, and bring it me here, without a word!"</p>

  <p>Somewhat to his surprise, she rose at once to do his bidding, leaving the
  tent with a perfectly composed step and air. He might have remarked, though,
  that when she returned with his wine, the red drops fell profusely over her
  white trembling fingers, though she looked in his face as proudly and
  steadily as ever. The hand might, indeed, shake, but the heart was fixed and
  resolute. In the veins of none of her ancestors did the Mutian blood, so
  strong for good and evil, ebb and flow with a fuller, more resistless tide,
  than in hers. Valeria had made up her mind in the space of time it took to
  lift a goblet from the ground.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-07"
     id="ch3-07">VII</a>. &mdash; THE ATTAINDER</h2>

  <p class="first">JOHN OF GISCHALA would never have obtained the ascendency he
  enjoyed in Jerusalem, had he not been as well versed in the sinuous arts of
  intrigue, as in the simpler stratagems of war. After confronting his rival in
  the Council, and sustaining in public opinion the worst of the encounter, he
  was more than ever impressed with the necessity of ruining Eleazar at any
  price; therefore, keeping a wary eye upon all the movements of the Zealots,
  he held himself ready at every moment to take advantage of the first false
  step on the part of his adversary.</p>

  <p>Eleazar, with the promptitude natural to his character, had commenced a
  repair of the defences, almost before his emissary was admitted to the Roman
  camp, thinking it needless to await the decision of Titus, either for or
  against his proposal. Labouring heart and soul at the works, with all the
  available force he could muster, he left John and his party in charge of the
  Great Gate, and it happened that his rival was present there in person, when
  Calchas was brought back to the city by the Roman guard of honour Titus had
  ordered for his safe-conduct&mdash;a compliment his brother never expected,
  and far less desired. Eleazar made sure his messenger would be permitted to
  return the way he came, and that his own communications with the enemy would
  remain a secret from the besieged.</p>

  <p>John saw his opportunity, and availed himself of it on the instant. No
  sooner had Calchas placed his foot once more within the town, than his head
  was covered, so that he might not be recognised; and he was carried off by a
  guard of John's adherents, and placed in secure ward, their chief adroitly
  arresting him by a false name, for the information of the populace, lest the
  rumour should reach Eleazar's ears. He knew his rival's readiness of
  resource, and determined to take him by surprise. Then he rent his garment,
  and ran bareheaded through the streets towards the Temple, calling with a
  great voice. "Treason! Treason!" and sending round the fragments of his gown
  amongst the senators, to convoke them in haste upon a matter of life and
  death, in their usual place of deliberation. So rapidly did he take his
  measures that the Outer Court was already filled and the Council assembled,
  ere Eleazar, busied with his labours at the wall far off, opposite the Tower
  of Antonia, knew that they had been summoned. Covered with sweat and dust, he
  obeyed at once the behest of the Levite who came breathlessly to require his
  presence, as an elder of Israel; but it was not without foreboding of evil
  that he observed the glances of suspicion and mistrust shot at him by his
  colleagues when he joined them. John of Gischala, with an affectation of
  extreme fairness, had declined to enter upon the business of the State, until
  this, the latest of her councillors, had arrived; but he had taken good care,
  by means of his creatures, to scatter rumours amongst the Senate, and even
  amongst the Zealots themselves, deeply affecting the loyalty of their
  chief.</p>

  <p>No sooner had Eleazar, still covered with the signs of his toil, taken his
  accustomed station, than John stood forth in the hall and spoke out in a
  loud, clear voice.</p>

  <p>"Before the late troublous times," said he, "and when every man in Judaea
  ate of his own figs from his own fig tree, and trod out his own grapes in his
  own vineyard; when we digged our wells unmolested, and our women drew water
  unveiled, and drank it peacefully at sundown; when our children played about
  our knees at the door, and ate butter and honey, and cakes baked in oil; when
  the cruse was never empty, and the milk mantled in the milking-vessels, and
  the kid seethed in the pot&mdash;yea, in the pleasant time, in the days of
  old, it chanced that I was taking a prey in the mountain by the hunter's
  craft, in the green mountain, even the mountain of Lebanon. Then at noon I
  was wearied and athirst, and I laid me down under a goodly cedar and slept,
  and dreamed a dream. Behold, I will discover to the elders my dream and the
  interpretation thereof.</p>

  <p>"Now the cedar under which I lay was a goodly cedar, but in my dream it
  seemed that it reached far into the heavens, and spread its roots abroad to
  the springs of many waters, and sheltered the birds of the air in its
  branches, and comforted the beasts of the field with its shade. Then there
  came a beast out of the mountain a huge beast with a serpent between its eyes
  and horns upon its jaws and leaned against the cedar, but the tree neither
  bent nor broke. So there came a great wind against the cedar a mighty wind
  that rushed and roared through its branches, till it rocked to and fro,
  bending and swaying to the blast&mdash;but the storm passed away, and the
  goodly tree stood firm and upright as before. Again the face of heaven was
  darkened, and the thunder roared above, and the lightning leaped from the
  cloud, and smote upon the cedar, and rent off one of its limbs with a great
  and terrible crash; but when the sky cleared once more, the tree was a fair
  tree yet. So I said in my dream, 'Blessed is the cedar among the trees of the
  forest, for destruction shall not prevail against it.'</p>

  <p>"Then I looked, and behold, the cedar was already rotting, and its arms
  were withered up, and its head was no longer black, for a little worm, and
  another, and yet another were creeping from within the bark, where they had
  been eating at its heart. Then one drew near bearing faggots on his
  shoulders, and he builded the faggots round the tree, and set a light to
  them, and burned them with fire, and the worms fell out by myriads from the
  tree, and perished in the smoke.</p>

  <p>"Then said he unto me, 'John of Gischala, arise! The cedar is the Holy
  City, and the beast is the might of the Roman Empire, and the storm and the
  tempest are the famine and the pestilence, and none of these shall prevail
  against it, save by the aid of the enemies from within. Purge them therefore
  with fire, and smite them with the sword, and crush them, even as the worm is
  crushed beneath thy heel into the earth! '</p>

  <p>"And the interpretation of the dream hath remained with me to this day,
  for is it not thus even now when the Roman is at the gate, as it hath ever
  been with the Holy City in the times of old? When the Assyrian came up
  against her, was not his host greater in number than the sands of the
  seashore? But he retired in discomfiture from before her, because she was
  true to herself. Would Nebuzaradan have put his chains on our people's neck,
  and Gedaliah scorned to accept honour from the conqueror, and to pay him
  tribute? When Pompey pitched his camp at Jericho and surrounded the Holy City
  with his legions, did not Aristobulus play the traitor and offer to open the
  gate? and when the soldiers mutinied, and prevented so black a treason, did
  not Hyrcanus, who was afterwards high-priest, assist the besiegers from
  within, and enable them to gain possession of the town? In later days, Herod,
  indeed, who was surnamed the Great, fortified Jerusalem like a soldier and a
  patriot; but even Herod, our warrior king, soiled his hands with Roman gold,
  and bowed his head to the Roman yoke. Will you tell me of Agrippa's wall,
  reared by the namesake and successor of the mighty monarch? Why was it never
  finished? Can you answer me that? I trow ye know too well; there was fear of
  displeasing Caesar, there was the old shameful truckling to Rome. This is the
  leaven that leaveneth all our leaders; this is the palsy that withereth all
  our efforts. Is not the chief who defended Jotapata now a guest in the tent
  of Titus? Is not Agrippa the younger a staunch adherent of Vespasian? Is he
  not a mere procurator of the Empire, for the province, forsooth, of Judaea?
  And shall we learn nothing from our history? Nothing from the events of our
  own times, from the scenes we ourselves witness day by day? Must the cedar
  fall because we fail to destroy the worms that are eating at its core? Shall
  Jerusalem be desecrated because we fear to denounce the hand that would
  deliver her to the foe? We have a plague-spot in the nation. We have an enemy
  in the town. We have a traitor in the Council. Eleazar Ben-Manahem! I bid
  thee stand forth!"</p>

  <p>There is an instinct of danger which seems to warn the statesman like the
  mariner of coming storms, giving him time to trim his sail, while they are
  yet below the horizon. When the assembled Senate turned their startled looks
  on Eleazar, they beheld a countenance unmoved by the suddenness and gravity
  of the accusation, a bearing that denoted, if not conscious innocence, at
  least a fixed resolution to wear its semblance without a shadow of weakness
  or fear. Pointing to his dusty garments, and the stains of toil upon his
  hands and person, he looked round frankly among the elders, rather, as it
  seemed, appealing to the Senate than answering his accuser, in his reply.</p>

  <p>"These should be sufficient proofs," said he. "if any were wanting, that
  Eleazar Ben-Manahem hath not been an instant absent from his post. I have but
  to strip the gown from my breast, and I can show yet deeper marks to attest
  my loyalty and patriotism. I have not grudged my own blood, nor the blood of
  my kindred, and of my father's house, to defend the walls of Jerusalem. John
  of Gischala hath dealt with you in parables, but I speak to you in the plain
  language of truth. This right hand of mine is hardened with grasping sword
  and spear against the enemies of Judah; and I would cut it off with its own
  fellow, ere I stretched it forth in amity to the Roman or the heathen. Talk
  not to me of thy worms and thy cedars! John of Gischala, man of blood and
  rapine speak out thine accusation plainly, that I may answer it!"</p>

  <p>John was stepping angrily forward, when he was arrested by the voice of a
  venerable long-bearded senator.</p>

  <p>"It is not meet," said the sage. "that accuser and accused should bandy
  words in the presence of the Council. John of Gischala, we summon thee to lay
  the matter at once before the Senate, warning thee that an accusation without
  proofs will but recoil upon the head of him who brings it forward."</p>

  <p>John smiled in grim triumph.</p>

  <p>"Elders of Israel," said he. "I accuse Eleazar Ben-Manahem of offering
  terms to the enemy."</p>

  <p>Eleazar started, but recovered himself instantaneously. It was war to the
  knife, as well he knew, between him and John. He must not seem to hesitate
  now when his ascendency amongst the people was at such a crisis. He took the
  plunge at once.</p>

  <p>"And I reply," he exclaimed indignantly, "that rather than make terms with
  the Roman, I would plunge the sword into my own body."</p>

  <p>A murmur of applause ran through the assembly at this spirited
  declaration. The accused had great weight amongst the nobility and the
  national party in Jerusalem, of which the Council chiefly consisted. Could
  Eleazar but persevere in his denial of communication with Titus, he must
  triumph signally over his adversary; and, to do him justice, there was now
  but little personal ambition mingled with his desire for supremacy. He was a
  fanatic, but he was a patriot as well. He believed all things were lawful in
  the cause of Jerusalem, and trusting to the secret way by which Calchas had
  left the city for the Roman camp, and by which he felt assured he must have
  returned, as, thanks to John's precautions, nothing had been heard of his
  arrival at the Great Gate and subsequent arrest, he resolved to persevere in
  his denial, and trust to his personal influence to carry things with a high
  hand.</p>

  <p>"There hath been a communication made from his own house, and by one of
  his own family, to the Roman commander," urged John, but with a certain air
  of deference and hesitation, for he perceived the favourable impression made
  on the Council by his adversary, and he was crafty enough to know the
  advantage of reserving his convincing proofs for the last, and taking the
  tide of opinion at the turn.</p>

  <p>"I deny it," said Eleazar firmly. "The children of Ben-Manahem have no
  dealings with the heathen!"</p>

  <p>"It is one of the seed of Ben-Manahem whom I accuse," replied John, still
  addressing himself to the elders. "I can prove he hath been seen going to and
  fro, between the camp and the city."</p>

  <p>"His blood be on his own head!" answered Eleazar solemnly.</p>

  <p>He had a vague hope that after all they might but have intercepted some
  poor half-starved wretch whom the pangs of hunger had driven to the enemy.
  John looked back amongst his adherents crowding in the gate that led towards
  the Temple.</p>

  <p>"I speak not without proofs," said he; "bring forward the prisoner!"</p>

  <p>There was a slight scuffle amongst the throng, and a murmur which subsided
  almost immediately as two young men appeared: in the court, leading between
  them a figure, having its hands tied, and a mantle thrown over its head.</p>

  <p>"Eleazar Ben-Manahem!" said John, in a loud, clear voice that seemed to
  ring amongst the porticoes and pinnacles of the overhanging Temple. "stand
  forth, and speak the truth! Is not this man thy brother?"</p>

  <p>At the same moment, the mantle was drawn from the prisoner's head,
  revealing the mild and placid features of Calchas, who looked round upon the
  Council, neither intimidated nor surprised. The Senate gazed in each other's
  faces with concern and astonishment: John seemed, indeed, in a fair way of
  substantiating his accusation against the man they most trusted in all
  Jerusalem. The accuser continued, with an affectation of calm unprejudiced
  judgment, in a cool and dispassionate voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"This man was brought to the Great Gate to-day, under a guard of honour,
  direct from the Roman camp. I happened to be present, and the captain of the
  gate handed him over at once to me. I appeal to the Council whether I
  exceeded my duty in arresting him on the spot, permitting him no
  communication with anyone in the town until I had brought him before them in
  this court. I soon learned that he was the brother of Eleazar, one of our
  most distinguished leaders, to whom more than to any other the defence of the
  city has been entrusted, who knows better than anyone our weakness and the
  extremity of our need. By my orders he was searched, and on his person was
  found a scroll, purporting to be from no less a person than the commander of
  the Tenth Legion, an officer second only in authority to Titus himself, and
  addressed to one Esca, a Gentile, living in the very house, and I am informed
  a member of the very family, of Eleazar Ben-Manahem, this elder in Judah,
  this chief of the Zealots, this member of the Senate, this adviser in
  Council, this man whose right hand is hardened with sword and spear, but who
  would cut it off with his left, rather than that it should traffic with the
  enemy! I demand from the Council an order for the arrest of Esca, that he too
  may be brought before it, and confronted with him whose bread he eats. From
  the mouth of three offenders, our wise men may peradventure elicit the truth.
  If I have erred in my zeal let the Senate reprove me. If Eleazar can purge
  himself from my accusation, let him defile my father's grave, and call me
  liar and villain to my very beard!"</p>

  <p>The Senate, powerfully affected by John's appeal, and yet unable to
  believe in the treachery of one who had earned their entire confidence,
  seemed at a loss how to act. The conduct of the accused, too, afforded no
  clue whereby to judge of his probable guilt or innocence. His cheek was very
  pale, and once he stepped forward a pace, as if to place himself at his
  brother's side. Then he halted and repeated his former words. "His blood be
  on his own head," in a loud and broken voice, turning away the while, and
  glaring round upon the senators like some fierce animal taken in the toils.
  Calchas, too, kept his eyes fixed on the ground; and more than one observer
  remarked that the brothers studiously abstained from looking each other in
  the face. There was a dead silence for several seconds. Then the senator who
  had before spoken, raised his hand to command attention, and thus addressed
  the Council&mdash;</p>

  <p>"This is a grave matter, involving as it does not only the life and death
  of a son of Judah, but the honour of one of our noblest houses, and the
  safety, nay, the very existence of the Holy City. A grave matter, and one
  which may not be dealt with, save by the highest tribunal in the nation. It
  must be tried before our Sanhedrim, which will assemble for the purpose
  without delay. Those of us here present who are members of that august body,
  will divest their minds of all they have heard in this place to-day, and
  proceed to a clear and unbiased judgment of the matters that shall be then
  brought before them. Nothing has been yet proved against Eleazar Ben-Manahem,
  though his brother, and the Gentile who has to answer the same accusation,
  must be kept in secure ward. I move that the Council, therefore, be now
  dissolved, holding itself ready, nevertheless, seeing the imminent peril of
  the times, to reassemble at an hour's notice, for the welfare of Judah, and
  the salvation of the Holy City."</p>

  <p>Even while he ceased speaking, and ere the grave senators broke up,
  preparing to depart, a wail was heard outside the court that chilled the very
  heart of each, as it rose and fell like a voice from the other world,
  repeating ever and again, in wild unearthly tones, in solemn
  warning&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Woe to Jerusalem! Woe to the Holy City! Sin, and sorrow, and desolation!
  Woe to the Holy City! Woe to Jerusalem!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-08"
     id="ch3-08">VIII</a>. &mdash; THE SANHEDRIM</h2>

  <p class="first">THE highest tribunal acknowledged by the Jewish law, taking
  cognisance of matters especially affecting the religious and political
  welfare of the nation, essentially impartial in its decisions, and admitting
  of no appeal from its sentence, was that assembly of Seventy, or rather of
  Seventy-three members, which was called the Sanhedrim. This court of justice
  was supposed to express and embody the opinions of the whole nation,
  consisting as it did of a number which subdivided would have given six
  representatives for each tribe, besides a president to rule the proceedings
  of the whole. The latter, who was termed the <i>Nasi</i> or Prince of the
  Sanhedrim, was necessarily of illustrious birth, venerable years, and
  profound experience in all matters connected with the law&mdash; not only the
  actual law as laid down by inspiration for the guidance of the Chosen People,
  but also the traditional law, with its infinite variety of customs,
  precedents, and ceremonious observances, which had been added to, and as it
  were overlaid on the other, much to the detriment of that simpler code, which
  came direct from heaven. The members themselves of this supreme council were
  of noble blood. In no nation, perhaps, was the pride of birth more cherished
  than amongst the Jews; and in such an assemblage as the Sanhedrim, untainted
  lineage was the first indispensable qualification. The majority, indeed,
  consisted of priests and Levites; but other families of secular distinction
  who could count their ancestors step by step, from generation to generation,
  through the Great Captivity, and all the vicissitudes of their history, back
  to the magnificence of Solomon and the glories of David's warlike reign, had
  their representatives in this solemn conclave.</p>

  <p>Not only was nobility a requirement, but also maturity of years, a
  handsome person, and a dignified bearing; nor were mental attainments held in
  less regard than the adventitious advantages of appearance and station. Every
  elder of the Sanhedrim was obliged to study physic, to become an adept in the
  science of divination in all its branches, comprising astrology, the casting
  of nativities and horoscopes, the prediction of future events, and those
  mysteries of White Magic, as it was called, which bordered so narrowly on the
  forbidden limits of the Black Art. He was also required to be an excellent
  linguist; and was indeed supposed to be proficient in the seventy languages,
  believed to comprise all the tongues of the habitable earth. No eunuch nor
  deformed person could aspire to hold a place in this august body, no usurer,
  no Sabbath-breaker, none who were in the practice of any unlawful business or
  overt sin. Those who sat in the highest place of the Jewish nation, who ruled
  her councils and held the right of life and death over her children, must be
  prudent, learned, blameless men, decked with the patent of true nobility both
  in body and mind.</p>

  <p>The Sanhedrim, in its original constitution, was the only Court which had
  the right of judging capital cases; and this right, involving so grave a
  responsibility, it was careful to preserve during all the calamities of the
  nation, until it fell under the Roman yoke. The Empire, however, reserved to
  itself the power of condemning its criminals to death; but no sooner had the
  Jews broken out once more in open resistance to their conquerors, than the
  Sanhedrim resumed all its former privileges and sat again in judgment upon
  its countrymen.</p>

  <p>In a large circular chamber, half within and half without the Temple, this
  awful Court held its deliberations, the members, ranged in order by
  seniority, occupying the outer semicircle, as it was not lawful to sit down
  in the sacred precincts. That chamber was now the theatre of a solemn and
  imposing scene. The hall itself, which, though wide and lofty, appeared of
  yet larger proportions from its circular form, was hung round with cloth of a
  dark crimson colour, that added much to the prevailing sentiments of gloom
  which its appearance called forth. Over its entrance was suspended a curtain
  of the same hue; and the accused who underwent examination in this dreaded
  locality, found themselves encircled by an unbroken wall the colour of blood.
  A black carpet was spread on the floor, bordered with a wide yellow margin,
  on which were written in black Hebrew characters certain texts of the law,
  inculcating punishment rather than pardon, inflexible justice rather than a
  leaning towards mercy and forbearance. The heart of the guilty died within
  him as he looked uneasily around; and even the innocent might well quail at
  these preparations for a trial over which an exacting severity was so
  obviously to hold sway.</p>

  <p>The Sanhedrim were accustomed to assemble in an outer chamber, and march
  in grave procession to the court of trial. The crimson curtain, drawn by an
  unseen hand, rolled slowly from the door, and the members, dressed in black,
  came in by pairs and took their places in order. As they entered, their names
  were called over by an official concealed behind the hangings; and each man
  notified his arrival as he passed on to his seat, by the solemn answer: "
  Here! In the presence of the Lord!" Last of all, the president made his
  appearance, and assumed a higher chair, set apart a little from the rest.
  Then the youngest member offered up a short prayer, to which the whole
  assembly responded with a deep and fervent Amen! The Court was now considered
  to be opened, and qualified for the trial of all causes that should be
  brought before it during its sitting.</p>

  <p>On the present occasion the junior member was a Levite, nearly threescore
  years of age, of a stately presence, which he had preserved notwithstanding
  the hardships of the siege, and who retained much of his youthful comeliness
  with the flowing beard and grave countenance of maturer years. Phineas Ben
  -Ezra possessed the exterior qualities by which men are prone to be
  influenced, with a ready tongue, a scheming brain, and an unscrupulous heart.
  He was attached to John's faction, and a bitter enemy of the Zealots, by whom
  he had himself been formerly accused of treasonable correspondence with
  Vespasian; an accusation that he refuted to his own exultation and the utter
  confusion of his enemies, but which those who had the best means of judging
  believed to be true nevertheless. He took his seat now with an expression of
  cold triumph on his handsome features, and exchanged looks with one or two of
  the colleagues who seemed deepest in his confidence, that the latter knew too
  well boded considerable danger to the accused whom they were about to
  try.</p>

  <p>The Prince of the Sanhedrim, Matthias the son of Boethus, who had already
  filled the office of high-priest, was a stern and conscientious man of the
  old Jewish party, whose opinions indeed were in accordance with those of
  Eleazar, and who entertained, besides, a personal friendship for that
  determined enthusiast, but whose inflexible obstinacy was to be moved by no
  earthly consideration from the narrow path of duty which he believed his
  sacred character compelled him to observe. His great age and austere bearing
  commanded considerable influence among his countrymen, enhanced by the high
  office he had previously filled; nor was he the less esteemed that his severe
  and even morose disposition, while it gained him few friends, yielded no
  confidences and afforded no opportunity for the display of those human
  weaknesses by which a man wins their affections, while he loses the command
  over his fellow-creatures. His face was very pale and grave now, as he moved
  haughtily to the seat reserved for him; and his dark flowing robes,
  decorated, in right of his former priesthood, with certain mystic symbols,
  seemed well-fitted to the character of a stern and inflexible judge. The
  other members of the assembly, though varying in form and feature, were
  distinguished one and all by a family likeness, originating probably in
  similarity of habits and opinions, no less than in a common nationality and
  the sharing of a common danger, growing daily to its worst. The dark flashing
  eye, the deep sallow tint, the curving nostril and the waving beard, were no
  more distinguishing marks of any one individual in the assembly, than were
  his long black gown and his expression of severe and inscrutable gravity; but
  even these universal characteristics were not so remarkable as a certain
  ominous shadow that cast its gloom upon the face of each. It was the shadow
  of that foe against whom sword and spear and shield and javelin, bodily
  strength, dauntless courage, and skill in the art of war, were all powerless
  to make head the foe who was irresistible because he lay at the very heart of
  the fortress. The weary, anxious, longing look of hunger was on the faces
  even of these, the noblest and the most powerful behind the wall. They had
  stores of gold and silver, rich silks, sparkling jewels, costly wines within
  their houses; but there % was a want of bread, and gaunt uneasy famine had
  set his seal, if not as deeply at least as surely, upon these faces in the
  Sanhedrim as on that of the meanest soldier, who girded his sword-belt
  tighter to stay his pangs, as he stood pale and wasted in his armour on the
  ramparts, over against the foe.</p>

  <p>There was a hush for several seconds after the Prince of the Sanhedrim had
  taken his seat, and the general prayer had been offered up. It was broken at
  length by Matthias, who rose with slow impressive gestures, drew his robe
  around him so as to display the sacred symbols and cabalistic figures with
  which its hem was garnished, and spoke in stern and measured tones&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Princes of the House of Judah," said he, "elders and nobles, and priests
  and Levites of the nation, we are met once more to-day, in accordance with
  our ancient prerogative, for the sifting of a grave and serious matter. In
  this, the highest Council of our country, we adhere to the same forms that
  have been handed down to us by our fathers from the earliest times, even from
  their sojourn in the wilderness, that have been preserved through the Great
  Captivity of our nation, that may have been prohibited by our conquerors, but
  that we have resumed with that independence which we have recently asserted,
  and which the Ruler to whom alone we owe allegiance will assuredly enable us
  to attain. We will not part with one iota of our privileges, and least of all
  with our jurisdiction in matters involving life and death; a jurisdiction as
  inseparable from our very existence as the Tabernacle itself, which we have
  accompanied through so many vicissitudes, and with which we are so closely
  allied. That inferior assemblage from which our chosen body is selected has
  already considered the heavy accusation which has collected us here. They
  have decided that the matter is of too grave a character to be dealt with by
  their own experience&mdash;that it involves the condemnation to death of one
  if not two members of the illustrious family of Ben-Manahem&mdash;that it may
  deprive us of a leader who claims to be among the staunchest of our patriots,
  who has proved himself the bravest of our defenders. But what then, princes
  of the House of Judah, elders and nobles, and priests and Levites of the
  nation? Shall I spare the pruning-hook, because it is the heaviest branch in
  my vineyard that is rotting from its stem? Shall I not rather lop it off with
  mine own hand, and cast it from me into the consuming fire? If my brother be
  guilty shall I screen him, brother though he be? Shall I not rather hand him
  over to the Avenger, and deliver my own soul? We are all assembled in our
  places, ready to hear attentively, and to try impartially, whatsoever
  accusations may be brought before us. Phineas Ben-Ezra, youngest member of
  the Sanhedrim, I call on thee to count over thy colleagues, and proclaim
  aloud the sum thereof."</p>

  <p>In compliance with established usage, Phineas, thus adjured, rose from his
  seat, and walking gravely through the hall, told off its inmates one by one,
  in a loud and solemn voice, then finding the tale to be correct, stopped
  before the high chair of the Nasi, and proclaimed thrice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Prince of the Sanhedrim, the mystic number is complete!"</p>

  <p>The president addressed him again in the prescribed formula&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Phineas Ben-Ezra, are we prepared to try each cause according to the
  traditions of our nation, and the strict letter of the law? Do we abide by
  the decisions of wisdom without favour, and justice without mercy?"</p>

  <p>Then the whole Sanhedrim repeated as with one voice, "Wisdom without
  favour, and justice without mercy!"</p>

  <p>The president now seated himself, and looked once more to Phineas, who, as
  the youngest member present, was entitled to give his opinion first. The
  latter, answering his glance, rose at once and addressed his fellows in a
  tone of diffidence which would have seemed misplaced in one of his venerable
  appearance, had he not been surrounded by men of far greater age than
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I am but as a disciple," said he. "at the feet of a master, in presence
  of Matthias the son of Boethus, and my honoured colleagues. Submitting to
  their experience, I do but venture to ask a question, without presuming to
  offer my own opinion on its merits. Supposing that the Sanhedrim should be
  required to try one of its own number, is it lawful that he should remain and
  sit, as it were, in judgment upon himself?"</p>

  <p>Eleazar, who was present in his place as a member of the august body, felt
  that this attack was specially directed against his own safety. He knew the
  virulence of the speaker, and his rancorous enmity to the Zealots, and
  recognised the danger to himself of exclusion from the coming deliberations.
  He was in the act of rising in indignant protest against such an assumption,
  when he was forestalled by Matthias, who replied in tones of stern
  displeasure&mdash;</p>

  <p>"He must indeed be a mere disciple, and it will be long ere he is worthy
  of the name of master in the Sanhedrim, who has yet to learn, that our
  deliberations are uninfluenced by aught we have heard or seen outside the
  chamber that we recognise in our august office no evidence but the proofs
  that are actually brought before us here. Phineas Ben-Ezra, the Court is
  assembled; admit accusers and accused. Must I tell thee that we are still
  ignorant of the cause we are here to try?"</p>

  <p>The decision of the Nasi, which was in accordance with traditional
  observance and established custom, afforded Eleazar a moment's respite, in
  which to resolve on the course he should adopt; but though his mind was
  working busily, he sat perfectly unmoved, [and to all outward appearance calm
  and confident; whilst' the hangings were again drawn back, and the tread of
  feet announced the approach of accuser and accused. The latter were now two
  in number: for by John's orders a strong guard had already proceeded to
  Eleazar's house, and laid violent hands on Esca, who, confident in his own
  innocence and in the influence of his host, accompanied them without
  apprehension of danger into the presence of the awful assembly. The Briton's
  surprise was, however, great, when he found himself confronted with Calchas,
  of whose arrest, so skilfully had John managed it, he was as unconscious as
  the rest of the besieged. The two prisoners were not permitted to communicate
  with each other; and it was only from a warning glance shot at him by his
  fellow-sufferer, that Esca gathered they were both in a situation of extreme
  peril.</p>

  <p>It was not without considerable anxiety that Eleazar remarked, when the
  curtains were drawn back, how a large body of armed men filled the adjoining
  cloister of the Temple: like the guard who watched the prisoners, these were
  partisans of John; and so well aware were the Sanhedrim of that fierce
  soldier's lawless disposition, that they looked uneasily from one to the
  other, with the painful reflection that he was quite capable of massacring
  the whole conclave then and there, and taking the supreme government of the
  city into his own hands.</p>

  <p>It was the influence, however, of no deliberative assembly that was feared
  by a man like John of Gischala. Fierce and reckless to the extreme, he
  dreaded only the violence of a character bold and unscrupulous as his own.
  Could he but pull Eleazar from the pinnacle on which he had hitherto stood,
  he apprehended no other rival. The chief of the Zealots was the only man who
  could equal him in craft as well as in courage, whose stratagems were as
  deep, whose strokes were even bolder, than his own. The opportunity he had
  desired so long was come, he believed, at last. In that circular chamber,
  thought John, before that council of stern and cruel dotards, he was about to
  throw the winning cast of his game. It behoved him to play it warily, though
  courageously. If he could enlist the majority of the Sanhedrim on his own
  side, his rival's downfall was certain. When he had assumed supreme power in
  Jerusalem&mdash;and he made no doubt that would be his next step&mdash;it
  would be time enough to consider whether he too might not ensure his own
  safety, and make terms with Titus by delivering up the town to the enemy.</p>

  <p>Standing apart from the prisoners, and affecting an air of extreme
  deference to his audience, John addressed the Nasi, in the tones rather of an
  inferior who excused himself for an excess of zeal in the performance of his
  duty, than of an equal denouncing a traitor and demanding justice for an
  offence.</p>

  <p>"I leave my case," said he. "in the hands of the Sanhedrim, appealing to
  them whether I have exceeded my authority, or accused any man falsely of a
  crime which I am unable to prove. I only ask for the indulgence due to a mere
  soldier, who is charged with the defence of the city, and is jealous of
  everything that can endanger her safety. From each member here present
  without a single exception, from Matthias the son of Boethus to Phineas
  Ben-Ezra of the family of Nehemiah, I implore a favourable hearing. There
  stands the man whom I secured at noon this day, coming direct from Titus,
  with a written scroll upon his person, of which the superscription was to a
  certain Gentile dwelling in the house of Eleazar, who is also present before
  you, and purporting to be in the writing of that warrior of the heathen who
  commands the Tenth Legion. Was it not my duty to bring such a matter at once
  before the Council? and was it not expedient that the Council should refer so
  grave a question to the Sanhedrim?"</p>

  <p>Matthias bent his brows sternly upon the speaker, and thus addressed
  him&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Thou art concealing thy thoughts from those to whose favour thou makest
  appeal. John of Gischala, thou art no unpractised soldier to draw a bow at a
  venture, and heed not where the shaft may strike. Speak out thine accusation,
  honestly, boldly, without fear of man, before the assembly, or for ever hold
  thy peace!"</p>

  <p>Thus adjured, John of Gischala cast an anxious glance at the surrounding
  faces turned towards him, with varying expressions of expectation, anger,
  encouragement, and mistrust. Then he looked boldly at the president, and made
  his accusation before the Sanhedrim as he had already made it before the
  Council&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I charge Eleazar Ben-Manahem," said he. "with treason, and I charge these
  two men as his instruments. Let them clear themselves if they can!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-09"
     id="ch3-09">IX</a>. &mdash; THE PAVED HALL</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL eyes were now turned on Eleazar, who sat unmoved in his
  place, affecting a composure which he was far from feeling. His mind, indeed,
  was tortured to agony, by the conflict that went on within. Should he stand
  boldly forward and confess that he had sent his own brother into the Roman
  camp, with proposals for surrender? Well he knew that such a confession would
  be tantamount to placing his neck at once under John of Gischala's foot.</p>

  <p>Who amongst his most devoted partisans would have courage to profess a
  belief in his patriotic motives, or allow that he was satisfied with the
  explanation offered for such a flagrant act of treason? The condemnation of
  the Sanhedrim would be the signal for his downfall and his death. When he was
  gone who would be left to save Jerusalem? This was the consideration that
  affected him, far more than any personal apprehensions of danger or disgrace.
  On the other hand, should he altogether renounce his brother, and disavow the
  authority he had given him? It has already been said, that as far as he loved
  any living being, he loved Calchas; perhaps had it not been so, he might have
  shrunk from the disgrace of abandoning one who had acted under his own
  immediate orders, and risked so much in obeying them; but in the depths of
  his fierce heart, something whispered that self-sacrifice was essentially
  akin to duty, and that because he loved him, therefore he must offer up his
  brother, as a man offers up a victim at the altar.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he ran his eye hastily over his seventy-two colleagues, as
  they sat in grave deliberation, and summed up rapidly the score of friends
  and foes. It was nearly balanced, yet he knew there were many who would take
  their opinions from the Nasi; and from that stern old man he could expect
  nothing but the severity of impartial justice. He dared not look at Calchas,
  he dared not cover his face with his hand to gain a brief respite from the
  cold grave eyes that were fixed upon him. It was a bitter moment, but he
  reflected that, in the cause of Jerusalem, shame and suffering and sorrow,
  and even sin, became sacred, and he resolved to sacrifice all, even his own
  flesh and blood, to his ascendency in the town.</p>

  <p>He was spared the pain, however, of striking the fatal blow with his own
  hand. Matthias, scrupulous in all matters of justice, had decided that until
  the accusation against him was supported by some direct evidence, no member
  of the Sanhedrim could] be placed in the position of a culprit. He therefore
  determined to interrogate the prisoners himself, and ascertain whether
  anything would be elicited of so grave a nature as to cause Eleazar's
  suspension from his present office, and the consequent reassembling of the
  whole Sanhedrim; a delay that in the present critical state of matters it was
  desirable to avoid, the more so that the day was already far advanced, and
  the morrow was the Sabbath. He therefore ordered the two prisoners to be
  placed in the centre of the hall; and, looking sternly towards the accused,
  began his interrogations in the severe accents of one who is an avenger
  rather than a judge.</p>

  <p>The mild eye and placid demeanour of Calchas afforded a strong contrast to
  the frowning brows and flashing glances of the Nasi.</p>

  <p>"Your name, old man," said the latter abruptly. "Your name, lineage, and
  generation?"</p>

  <p>"Calchas the son of Simeon," was the reply. "the son of Manahem, of the
  house of Manahem, and of the tribe of Judah."</p>

  <p>"Art thou not the brother of Eleazar Ben-Manahem, who is sitting yonder in
  his place as a member of the Sanhedrim, before whom thou hast to plead?"</p>

  <p>Ere he replied, Calchas stole a look at Eleazar, who forced himself to
  return it. There was something in the elder brother's face that caused the
  younger to turn his eyes away, and bend them on the ground. The fierce old
  president, impatient of that momentary delay, broke out angrily&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nay, look up, man! no subterfuges will avail thee here. Remember the fate
  of those who dare to lie in the presence of the Sanhedrim!"</p>

  <p>Calchas fixed his eye on the president's in mild rebuke.</p>

  <p>"I am in a higher presence than thine, Matthias son of Boethus," said he;
  "neither need the children of Manahem be adjured to speak truth before God
  and man!"</p>

  <p>"Hast thou heard the accusation brought against thee by John of Gischala?"
  proceeded the Nasi. "Canst thou answer it with an open brow and a clean
  heart?"</p>

  <p>"I heard the charge," replied Calchas. "and I am ready to answer it for
  myself, and for him who is in bonds by my side. Have I permission to clear
  myself before the Sanhedrim?"</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt have enough to do to slip thine own neck out of the yoke,"
  answered Matthias sternly. "Colleagues," he added, looking round. "ye have
  heard the accuser will ye now listen to the accused?"</p>

  <p>Then Phineas, speaking for the rest, answered: " We will hear him, Nasi,
  without favour, we will judge him without mercy."</p>

  <p>Thus encouraged, Calchas shook the white hair from his brow, and entered
  boldly on his defence.</p>

  <p>"It is true," said he. "that I have been outside the walls. It is true
  that I have been in the Roman camp, nay, that I have been in the very
  presence of Titus himself. Shall I tell the assembly of the strength of Rome,
  of the discipline of her armies, of the late reinforcement of her legions?
  Shall I tell them that I saw the very auxiliaries eating wheaten bread and
  the flesh of kids and sheep, whilst my countrymen are starving behind the
  walls? Shall I tell them that we are outnumbered by our foes, and are
  ourselves weakened by dissensions, and wasting our strength and courage day
  by day? Shall I tell them that I read on the face of Titus confidence in
  himself and reliance on his army, and, even with a conviction that he should
  prevail, a wish to show pity and clemency to the vanquished? All this they
  already know, all this must make it needless for me to enter into any defence
  beyond a simple statement of my motives. Nay, I have gathered intelligence
  from the Roman camp," he added, now fixing his eyes on his brother, to whom
  he had no other means of imparting the answer, which the prince had confided
  to him through Licinius by word of mouth,&mdash;"intelligence, the importance
  of which should well bear me harmless, even had I committed a greater offence
  than escaping from a beleaguered town to hold converse with the enemy.
  Titus," he spoke now in a loud clear voice, of which every syllable rang
  through the building&mdash;"Titus bade me be assured that his determination
  was unalterable, to grant no further delay, but, surrender or no surrender,
  to enter Jerusalem the day after the Sabbath, and if he encountered
  resistance, to lay waste the Holy City with fire and sword!"</p>

  <p>Eleazar started to his feet, but recollected himself, and resumed his seat
  instantaneously. The action might well be interpreted as the mere outbreak of
  a soldier's energy, called, as it were, by the sound of the trumpet to the
  wall. This, then, was what he had gained, a respite, a reprieve of one day,
  and that one day he had purchased at the dear price of his brother's life.
  Yet even now the fierce warrior reflected with a grim delight, how
  judiciously he had used the time accorded him, and how, when the proud Roman
  did make his threatened assault, he would meet with a reception worthy of the
  warlike fame so long enjoyed by the Jewish nation.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Sanhedrim seemed scared and stupefied. Every man looked in
  his neighbour's face, and read there only dismay and blank despair. The
  crisis had been long threatening, and now it was at hand. Resistance was
  hopeless, escape impossible, and captivity insupportable. The prevailing
  feeling in the assembly was, nevertheless, one of indignation against the
  bearer of such unwelcome tidings. The Nasi was the first to recover himself,
  yet even he seemed disturbed.</p>

  <p>"By whose authority," said he and every eye was turned on Eleazar while he
  spoke&mdash;"by whose authority didst thou dare to enter the camp of the
  enemy, and traffic with the Gentile who encompasseth the Holy City with bow
  and spear?"</p>

  <p>The chief of the Zealots knew well that he was the observed of all his
  colleagues, many of whom would triumph at his downfall, whilst even his own
  partisans would detach themselves from it, each to the best of his abilities,
  when his faction ceased to be in the ascendant. He knew, too, that on his
  brother's answer hung not only his life&mdash;which indeed he had risked too
  often to rate at a high value&mdash;but the stability of the whole fabric he
  had been building for months&mdash;the authority by which he hoped to save
  Jerusalem and Judaea, for which he grudged not to peril his immortal soul;
  and knowing all this, he forced his features into a sedate and solemn
  composure. He kept his eye away from the accused indeed, but fixed sternly on
  the president, and sat in his place the only man in the whole of that
  panic-stricken assembly who appeared master of the situation, and confident
  in himself. Calchas paused before he answered, waiting till the stir was
  hushed, and the attention which had been diverted to his brother settled once
  more on his own case. Then he addressed the Nasi in bold sonorous accents,
  his form dilating, his face brightening as he spoke&mdash;</p>

  <p>"By the authority of Him who came to bring peace on earth&mdash;by the
  authority that is as far greater than that of Sanhedrim, or priest, or
  conqueror, as the heavens are higher than the sordid speck of dust on which,
  but for that authority, we should only swarm and grovel and live one little
  hour, like the insects dancing in the sunbeams, to die at the close of
  day&mdash;I am a man of peace! Could I bear to see my country wasted by the
  armed hand, and torn by the trampling hoof? I love my neighbour as myself.
  Could I bear to know that his grasp was day by day on his brother's throat? I
  have learned from my Master that all are brethren, besieger and besieged,
  Roman and barbarian, Jew and Gentile, bond and free. Are they at variance,
  and shall I not set them at one? Are their swords at each other's breasts,
  and shall I not step between and bid them be at peace? By whose authority,
  dost thou ask me, Matthias son of Boethus? By His authority who came to you,
  and ye knew Him not. Who preached to you, and ye heeded Him not. Who would
  have saved you in His own good time from the great desolation, and ye reviled
  Him, and judged Him, and put Him to death on yonder hill!"</p>

  <p>Even the Prince of the Sanhedrim was staggered at the old man's boldness.
  Like other influential men of his nation, he could not ignore the existence
  of a well-known sect, which had already exchanged its title of Nazarenes for
  that of Christians, the name in which it was hereafter to spread itself over
  the whole earth; but the very mention of these self-devoted men was an
  abomination in his ears, and the last house in which he could have expected
  to find a votary of the cross, was that of Eleazar Ben-Manahem, chief of such
  a party as the Zealots, and grounding his influence on his exclusive
  nationality and strict adhesion to the very bigotry of the Jewish law. He
  looked on Calchas for a space, as if scarcely believing his eyes. Then there
  came over his features, always stern and harsh, an expression of pitiless
  severity, and he addressed his colleagues, rather than the accused.</p>

  <p>"This is even a graver matter than I had thought for," said he, in a low
  yet distinct voice, that made itself heard in the farthest corner of the
  Court. "Princes of the house of Judah, elders and nobles, and priests and
  Levites of the nation, I am but the instrument of your will, the weapon
  wielded by your collective might. Is it not the duty of mine office that I
  smite and spare not?"</p>

  <p>"Smite and spare not!" repeated Phineas; and the whole assembly echoed the
  merciless verdict.</p>

  <p>There was not one dissentient, not even Eleazar, sitting gloomy and
  resolved in his place. Then Matthias turned once more to Calchas, and said,
  still in the same suppressed tones</p>

  <p>"Thou speakest in parables, and men may not address the Sanhedrim save in
  the brief language of fact. Art thou then one of those accursed Nazarenes who
  have called themselves Christians of late?"</p>

  <p>"I am indeed a Christian," answered Calchas. "and I glory in the name.
  Would that thou, Matthias son of Boethus, and these the elders of Judah, were
  partakers with me in all that name affords."</p>

  <p>Then he looked kindly and joyfully in Eleazar's face, for he knew that he
  had saved his brother. The corselet of the latter rattled beneath his long
  black robe with the shiver that ran through his whole frame. The tension was
  taken off his nerves at last, and the relief was great, but it was purchased
  at too dear a price. Now that it was doomed, he felt the value of his
  brother's life. He was totally unmanned, and shifted uneasily in his seat,
  not knowing what to do or say. They seemed to have changed places at
  last&mdash;Calchas to have assumed the bold unyielding nature, and Eleazar
  the loving tender heart. He recovered himself, however, before long. The
  ruling passion triumphed once more, as he anticipated the discomfiture of his
  rival, and the speedy renewal of his own ascendency amongst his
  countrymen.</p>

  <p>The Prince of the Sanhedrim reflected for a few moments ere he turned his
  severe frown on Esca, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What doth this Gentile here in the Court of the Sanhedrim? Let him speak
  what he knoweth in this matter, ere he answer his own crime. Thy testimony at
  least may be valid," he added scornfully, "for thou surely art not a
  Christian?"</p>

  <p>The Briton raised his head proudly to reply. If there was less of holy
  meekness in his demeanour than in that of Calchas, there was the same bold
  air of triumph, the same obvious defiance of consequences, usually displayed
  by those who sealed their testimony with their blood.</p>

  <p>"I am a Christian," said he. "I confess it, and I too, like my teacher
  there, glory in the name! I will not deny the banner under which I serve. I
  will fight under that banner, even to the death."</p>

  <p>The Nasi's very beard bristled with indignation; he caught up the skirt of
  his mantle, and tore it asunder to the hem. Then, raising the pieces thus
  rent above his head, he cried out in a loud voice. "It is enough! They have
  spoken blasphemy before the Sanhedrim. There is nothing more but to pronounce
  immediate sentence of death. Phineas Ben-Ezra, bid thy colleagues adjourn to
  the Stone-paved Hall!"</p>

  <p>Then the assembly rose in silence, and, marching gravely two by two,
  passed out into an adjoining chamber, which was paved, and roofed, and faced
  with stone. Here alone was it lawful to pass sentence of death on those whom
  the Sanhedrim had condemned; and here, while their judges stood round them in
  a circle, the prisoners with their guard fronting the Nasi took their
  position in the midst. The latter stooping to the ground went through the
  form of collecting a handful of dust and throwing it into the air.</p>

  <p>"Thus," said he. "your lives are scattered to the winds, and your blood
  recoils on your own heads. You, Calchas the son of Simeon, the son of
  Manahem, of the house of Manahem, and you, Gentile, called Esca on the scroll
  which has been delivered into my hand, shall be kept in secure ward till
  to-morrow be past, seeing that it is the Sabbath, and at morning's dawn on
  the first day of the week ye shall be stoned with stones in the Outer Court
  adjoining the Temple until ye die; and thus shall be done, and more also, to
  those who are found guilty of blasphemy in the presence of the
  Sanhedrim!"</p>

  <p>Then turning to Eleazar, who still retained his forced composure
  throughout the hideous scene, he added&mdash;</p>

  <p>"For thee, Eleazar Ben -Manahem, thy: name is still untarnished in the
  nation, and thy place still knows thee amongst thy brethren. The testimony of
  a Nazarene is invalid; and no accusation hath yet been brought against thee
  supported by any witness save these two condemned and accursed men. That thou
  hast no portion, my brother, with blasphemers scarcely needs thine own
  unsupported word in the ears of the Sanhedrim!"</p>

  <p>Eleazar, with the same fixed white face, looked wildly round him on the
  assembled elders, turning up the sleeves of his gown the while, and moving
  his hands over each other as though he were washing them.</p>

  <p>"Their blood be on their own head," said he. "I renounce them from my
  family and my household&mdash;I abjure them, I wash my hands of
  them&mdash;their blood be on their own head!"</p>

  <p>And while he spoke, the warning voice was heard again outside the Temple,
  causing even the bold heart of the Nasi to thrill with a wild and
  unaccustomed fear the voice of the wailing prophet crying. "Woe to Jerusalem!
  Woe to the Holy City! Sin and sorrow and desolation! Woe to the Holy City!
  Woe to Jerusalem!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-10"
     id="ch3-10">X</a>. &mdash; A ZEALOT OF THE ZEALOTS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE man who has resolved that he will shake himself free
  from those human affections and human weaknesses which, like the corporeal
  necessities of hunger and thirst, seem to have been given us for our
  enjoyment rather than our discomfort, will find he undertakes a task too hard
  for mortal courage and for mortal strength. Without those pleasant
  accessories, like water and sunshine, the simple and universal luxuries of
  mankind, existence may indeed drag on, but it can scarcely be called life.
  The Great Dispenser of all knows best. His children are not meant to stand
  alone, independent of each other and of Him. While they help their fellows,
  and trust in His strength, they are strong indeed; but no sooner do they lean
  on the staff themselves have fashioned, than they stumble and fall. It wounds
  the hand that grasps it, and breaks too surely when it is most needed at the
  last.</p>

  <p>Eleazar believed, when he quitted the Paved Hall in which the Sanhedrim
  pronounced their sentence, that the bitterest drop was drained in the cup he
  had forced himself to quaff. He had not anticipated the remorseful misery
  that awaited him in his own home&mdash;the empty seats, where <i>they</i>
  were not&mdash;the tacit reproach of every familiar object&mdash;worst of
  all, the meeting with Mariamne, the daughter of his affections, the only
  child of his house. All that dreary Sabbath morning the Zealot sat in his
  desolate home, fearing&mdash; yes, he who seemed to fear nothing; to whom the
  battle-cry of shouting thousands on the wall was but as heart-stirring and
  inspiring music&mdash;fearing the glance of a girl's dark eye, the tone of
  her gentle voice&mdash;and that girl his own daughter. There was no daily
  sacrifice in the Temple now; that last cherished prerogative of the Jewish
  religion had been suspended. His creed forbade him to busy himself in any
  further measures of defence which would involve labour on the Sacred Day. He
  might not work with lever and crowbar at the breach. All that could be done
  in so short a space of time had been done by his directions yesterday. He
  must sit idle in his stately dwelling, brooding darkly over his brother's
  fate, or traverse his marble floor in restless strides, with clenched hands,
  and gnashing teeth, and a wild despair raging at his heart. Yet he never
  yielded nor wavered in his fanatical resolve. Had it all to be done once
  more, he would do the same again.</p>

  <p>One memory there was that he could not shake off&mdash;a vague and dreary
  memory that sometimes seemed to soothe, and sometimes to madden him. The
  image of Mariamne would come up before his eyes, not as now in her fair and
  perfect womanhood, but as a helpless loving little child, running to him with
  outstretched arms, and round cheeks wet with tears, asking him for the
  precious favourite that had gone with the rest of the flock to one of those
  great sacrifices with which the Jews kept their sacred festivals&mdash;the
  kid that was his child's playfellow&mdash;that he would have ransomed, had he
  but known it in time, with whole hecatombs of sheep and oxen, ere it should
  have been destroyed. The child had no mother even then; and he remembered,
  with a strange clearness, how he had taken the weeping little girl on his
  knee and soothed her with unaccustomed tenderness, while she put her arms
  round his neck, and laid her soft cheek against his own, accepting
  consolation, and sobbing herself to sleep upon his breast.</p>

  <p>After this there seemed to grow up a tacit confidence&mdash; a strong
  though unspoken affection&mdash;between father and daughter. They seldom
  exchanged many words in a day, sometimes scarcely more than a look. No two
  human beings could be much less alike, or have less in common. There was but
  this one slender link between them, and yet how strong it had been! After a
  while it angered him to find this memory softening, while it oppressed him,
  whether he would or no. He resolved he would see Mariamne at once and face
  the worst. She knew he had avoided her, and held him in too great awe to risk
  giving offence by forcing herself upon him. Ignorant of Esca's arrest, the
  instinctive apprehension of a woman for the man she loves had yet caused her
  to suspect some threatened danger from his prolonged absence. She watched her
  opportunity, therefore, to enter her father's presence and gain tidings, if
  possible, of his brother and the Briton.</p>

  <p>The hours sped on, and the fierce Syrian noon was already glaring down
  upon the white porches and dazzling streets of the Holy City. The hush of the
  Sabbath was over all; but it seemed more like the brooding, unnatural hush
  that precedes earthquake or tempest, than the quiet of a day devoted to
  peaceful enjoyment and repose. Her father was accustomed to drink a cup of
  wine at this hour, and Mariamne brought it him, trembling the while to learn
  the certainty of that which she could not yet bear to leave in doubt She
  entered the room in which he sat with faltering steps, and stood before him
  with a certain graceful timidity that seemed to deprecate his resentment. His
  punishment had begun already. She reminded him of her mother, standing there
  pale and beautiful in her distress.</p>

  <p>"Father," she said softly, as he took the cup from her hand and set it
  down untasted, without speaking. "where is our kinsman, Calchas?
  and&mdash;and Esca, the Briton? Father! tell me the worst at once. I am your
  own daughter, and I can bear it"</p>

  <p>The worst, had she allowed herself to embody her vague fears, would have
  applied to the younger of the absent ones. It would have assumed that he was
  gravely wounded, even dangerously. Not killed&mdash;surely not killed! He
  turned his eyes upon her sternly, nay, angrily; but even then he could not
  tell her till he had lifted the cup and drained it every drop. His lip was
  steady now, and his face was harder, gloomier, than before, while he
  spoke&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Daughter of Ben-Manahem!" said he. "henceforth thou hast no portion with
  him who was thy kinsman but yesterday, neither with him the Gentile within my
  gate, who has eaten of my bread and drunk from my cup, and stood with me
  shoulder to shoulder against the Roman on the wall."</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands in agony, and her very lips turned white; but she
  said true&mdash;she was his own daughter, and she neither tottered nor gave
  way. In measured tones she repeated her former words.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the worst, father. I can bear it."</p>

  <p>He found it easier now that he had begun, and he could lash himself into a
  spurious anger as he went on, detailing the events of the previous day; the
  charges brought forward by John of Gischala, the trial before the Sanhedrim,
  his own narrow escape, and the confession of the two culprits, owning, nay,
  glorying in their mortal crime. He fenced himself in with the sophistry of an
  enthusiast and a fanatic. He deluded himself into the belief that he had been
  injured and aggrieved by the apostasy of the condemned. He poured forth all
  the eloquence that might have vindicated him before Matthias and his
  colleagues, had John's accusation been ever brought to proof. The girl stood
  petrified and overpowered with his violence: at last he denounced herself,
  for having listened so eagerly to the gentle doctrines of her own father's
  brother, for having consorted on terms of friendship with the stranger whom
  he had' been the first to encourage and welcome beneath his roof. Once she
  made her appeal on Esca's behalf, but he silenced her ere she had half
  completed it.</p>

  <p>"Father," she urged. "though a Gentile, he conformed to the usages of our
  people; though a stranger, I have heard yourself declare that not a warrior
  in our ranks struck harder for the Holy City than your guest, the brave and
  loyal Esca!"</p>

  <p>He interrupted her with a curse.</p>

  <p>"Daughter of Ben-Manahem! in the day in which thou shalt dare again to
  speak that forbidden name, may thine eye wax dim, and thy limbs fail, and thy
  heart grow cold within thy breast&mdash;that thou be cut off even then, in
  thy sin&mdash; that thou fall like a rotten branch from the tree of thy
  generation&mdash;that thou go down into the dust and vanish like water spilt
  on the sand&mdash;that thy name perish everlastingly from among the maidens
  of Judah and the daughters of thy father's house!"</p>

  <p>Though his fury terrified it did not master her. Some women would have
  fled in dismay from his presence; some would have flung themselves on their
  knees and sought to move him to compassion with prayers and tears. Mariamne
  looked him fixedly in the face with a quiet sorrow in her own that touched
  him to the quick, and maddened him the more.</p>

  <p>"Father," she said softly. "I have nothing left to fear in this world.
  Slay me, but do not curse me."</p>

  <p>The vision of her childhood, the memory of her mother, the resigned
  sadness of her bearing, and the consciousness of his own injustice, conspired
  to infuriate him.</p>

  <p>"Slay thee!" he repeated between his set teeth. "By the bones of
  Manahem&mdash;by the head of the high-priest&mdash;by the veil of the Temple
  itself, if ever I hear thee utter that accursed name again, I will slay thee
  with mine own hand!"</p>

  <p>It was no empty threat to a daughter of her nation. Such instances of
  fanaticism were neither unknown to the sterner sects of the Jews, nor
  regarded with entirely unfavourable eyes by that self-devoted and
  enthusiastic people. The tale of Jephthah's daughter was cherished rather as
  an example of holy and high-minded obedience, than a warning from rash and
  inconsiderate vows. The father was more honoured as a hero than the daughter
  was pitied for a victim. And in later times, one Simon of Scythopolis, who
  had taken up arms against his own countrymen, and repented of his treachery,
  regained a high place in their estimation by putting himself to death, having
  previously slain every member of his family with his own hand.* It would have
  only added one more incident, causing but little comment, to the horrors of
  the siege, had the life of Mariamne been taken by her own father on his very
  threshold. She looked at him more in surprise than fear, with a hurt
  reproachful glance that pierced him to the heart. "Father!" she exclaimed.
  "you cannot mean it. Unsay those cruel words. Am I not your daughter? Father!
  father! you used to love me, when I was a little girl!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Now when he had said this he looked round about him,
  upon his family, with eyes of commiseration and of rage (that family
  consisted of a wife and children, and his aged parents), so in the first
  place he caught his father by his grey hairs, and ran his sword through him,
  and after him he did the same to his mother, who willingly received it; and
  after them he did the like to his wife and children, every one almost
  offering themselves to his sword, as desirous to prevent being slain by their
  enemies; so when he had gone over all his family he stood upon their bodies,
  to be seen by all, and stretching out his right hand, that his action might
  be observed by all, he sheathed his entire sword into his own bowels. This
  young man was to be pitied, on account of the strength of his body, and the
  courage of his soul.&mdash; Josephus, <i>Wars of the Jews</i>, Book II,  18.
  ]</p>

  <p>Then his savage mood gave way, and he took her to him and spoke to her in
  gentle soothing accents, as of old.</p>

  <p>"Thou art a daughter of Manahem," said he. "a maiden of Judah. It is not
  fit for thee to consort with the enemies of thy nation and of thy father's
  house. These men have avowed the pernicious doctrines of the Nazarenes, who
  call themselves Christians. Therefore they are become an abomination in our
  sight, and are to be cut off from amongst our people. Mariamne, if I can bear
  unmoved to see my brother perish, surely it is no hard task for thee to give
  up this stranger guest. It is not that my heart is iron to the core, though
  thou seest me ofttimes so stern, even with thee; but the men of to-day, who
  have taken upon themselves the defence of Jerusalem from the heathen, must be
  weaned from human affections and human weaknesses, even as the child is
  weaned from its mother's milk. I tell thee, girl, I would not count the lives
  of all my kindred against one hour of the safety of Judah; and Mariamne,
  though I love thee dearly, ay, better far than thou canst know&mdash;for whom
  have I now but thee, my daughter?&mdash;yet, if I believed that thou, too,
  couldst turn traitor to thy country and thy faith&mdash;I speak it not in
  anger&mdash;flesh and blood of mine own though thou be, I would bury my sword
  in thy heart!"</p>

  <p>Had Eleazar's looks corresponded with his words, such a threat, in her
  present frame of mind, might have caused Mariamne to avow herself a
  Christian, and brave the worst at once; but there was a weight [of care on
  her father's haggard brow, a mournful tenderness in his eyes, that stirred
  the very depths of her being in compassion&mdash;that merged all other
  feelings in one of intense pity for the misery of that fierce, resolute, and
  desolate old man. For the moment she scarcely realised Esca's danger in her
  sympathy for the obvious sufferings of one usually so self-reliant and
  unmoved. She came closer to his side, and placed her hand in his without
  speaking. He looked fondly down at her.</p>

  <p>"Abide with me for a space," said he; "Mariamne, thou and I are left alone
  in the world."</p>

  <p>Then he covered his face with his hands, and remained without speaking,
  wrapped, as it seemed, in gloomy reflections that she dare not disturb. So
  the two sat on through the weary hours of that long hot Sabbath day. Whenever
  she made the slightest movement, he looked up and signed for her to remain
  where she was. Though it was torture, she dared not disobey; and while the
  time slipped on and the shadows lengthened, and the breeze began to stir, she
  knew that every minute, as it passed, brought her lover nearer and nearer to
  a cruel death. Thus much she had learned too surely; but with the certainty
  were aroused all the energies of her indomitable race, and she resolved that
  he should be saved. Many a scheme passed through her working brain, as she
  sat in her father's presence, fearing now, above all things, to awake his
  suspicion of her intentions by word or motion, and so make it impossible for
  her to escape. Of all her plans there was but one that seemed feasible; and
  even that one presented difficulties almost insurmountable for a woman.</p>

  <p>She knew that he was safe at least till the morrow. No execution could
  take place on the Sabbath; and although the holy day would conclude at
  sundown, it was not the custom of her nation to put their criminals to death
  till after the dawn, so that she had the whole night before her in which to
  act. But, on the other hand, her father would not leave his home during the
  Sabbath, and she would be compelled to remain under his observation till the
  evening. At night, then, she had resolved to make her escape, and taking
  advantage of the private passage, only known to her father's family, by which
  Calchas had reached the Roman camp, to seek Titus himself, and offer to
  conduct his soldiers by that path into the city, stipulating as the price of
  her treachery an immediate assault, and the rescue of her kinsman, Calchas,
  with his fellow-sufferer. Girl as she was, it never occurred to her that
  Titus might refuse to believe in her good faith towards himself, and was
  likely to look upon the whole scheme as a design to lead his army into an
  ambush. The only difficulty that presented itself was her own escape from the
  city. She never doubted but that, once in the Roman camp, her tears and
  entreaties would carry everything before them, and, whatever became of
  herself, her lover would be saved.</p>

  <p>It was not, however, without a strong conflict of feelings that she came
  to this desperate resolve. The blood that flowed in her veins was loyal
  enough to tingle with shame ever and anon, as she meditated such treachery
  against her nation. Must she, a daughter of Judah, admit the enemy into the
  Holy City? Could the child of Eleazar Ben-Manahem, the boldest warrior of her
  hosts, the staunchest defender of her walls, be the traitor to defile
  Jerusalem with a foreign yoke? She looked at her father sitting there, in
  gloomy meditation, and her heart failed her as she thought of his agony of
  shame, if he lived to learn the truth, of the probability that he would never
  survive to know it, but perish virtually by her hand, in an unprepared and
  desperate resistance. Then she thought of Esca, tied to the stake, the
  howling rabble, the cruel mocking faces, the bare arms and the uplifted
  stones. There was no further doubt after that&mdash; no more
  wavering&mdash;nothing but the dogged immovable determination that proved
  whose daughter she was.</p>

  <p>When the sun had set, Eleazar seemed to shake off the fit of despondency
  that had oppressed him during the day. The Sabbath was now past, and it was
  lawful for him to occupy mind and body in any necessary work. He bade
  Mariamne light a lamp, and fetch him certain pieces of armour that had done
  him good service, and now stood in need of repair. It was a task in the
  skilful fulfilment of which every Jewish warrior prided himself. Men of the
  highest rank would unwillingly commit the renewal of these trusty defences to
  any fingers but their own; and Eleazar entered upon it with more of
  cheerfulness than he had shown for some time. As he secured one rivet after
  another, with the patience and precision required, every stroke of the hammer
  seemed to smite upon his daughter's brain. There she was compelled to remain
  a close prisoner, and the time was gliding away so fast! At length, when the
  night was already far advanced, even Eleazar's strong frame began to feel the
  effects of hunger, agitation, labour, and want of rest. He nodded two or
  three times over his employment, worked on with redoubled vigour, nodded
  again, let his head sink gradually on his breast, while the hammer slipped
  from his relaxing fingers, and he fell asleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-11"
     id="ch3-11">XI</a>. &mdash; THE DOOMED CITY</h2>

  <p class="first">MARIAMNE watched her father for a few impatient minutes,
  that seemed to lengthen themselves into hours, till she had made sure by his
  deep respiration that her movements would not wake him. Then she extinguished
  the lamp and stole softly from the room, scarcely breathing till she found
  herself safe out of the house. The door through which she emerged was a
  private egress, opening on the wide terrace that overhung the gardens. Its
  stone balustrades and broad flight of steps were now white and glistening in
  the moonlight, which shone brighter and fairer in those mellow skies than
  doth many a noonday in the misty north. While she paused to draw breath, and
  concentrate every faculty on the task she had undertaken, she could not but
  admire the scene spread out at her very feet. There lay the gardens in which
  she had followed many a childish sport, and dreamed out many a maiden's
  dream, sitting in the shade of those black cypresses, and turning her young
  face to catch the breeze that stirred their whispering branches, direct from
  the hills of Moab, blending in the far distance with the summer sky. And
  lately, too, amid all the horrors and dangers of the siege, had she not trod
  these level lawns with Esca, and wondered how she could be so happy while all
  about her was strife, and desolation, and woe? The thought goaded her into
  action, and she passed rapidly on; nevertheless, in that one glance around,
  the fair and gorgeous picture stamped itself for ever on her brain.</p>

  <p>Beneath her&mdash;here black as ebony, there glistening like sheets of
  burnished steel&mdash;lay the clear-cut terraces and level lawns of her
  father's stately home, dotted by tall tapering cypresses pointing to the
  heavens, and guarded by the red stems of many a noble cedar, flinging their
  twisted branches aloft in the midnight sky. Beyond, the spires and domes and
  pinnacles of the Holy City glittered and shone in the mellow light, or loomed
  in the alternate shade, fantastic, gloomy, and indistinct. Massive blocks of
  building, relieved by rows of marble pillars supporting their heavy
  porticoes, denoted the dwellings of her princes and nobles; while encircling
  the whole could be traced the dark level line of her last defensive wall,
  broken by turrets placed at stated intervals, and already heightened at the
  fatal breach opposite the Tower of Antonia, from the summit of which glowed
  one angry spot of fire, a beacon kindled for some hostile purpose by the
  enemy. High above all, like a gigantic champion guarding his charge, in
  burnished armour and robes of snowy white, rose the Temple, with its marble
  dome and roof of beaten gold. It was the champion's last watch&mdash;it was
  the last sleep of the fair and holy city. Never again would she lie in the
  moonlight, beautiful, and gracious, and undefaced. Doomed, like the Temple in
  which she trusted, to be utterly demolished and destroyed, the plough was
  already yoked that should score its furrows deep into her comeliness; the
  mighty stones, so hewn and carved and fashioned into her pride of strength,
  were even now vibrating to that shock which was about to hurl them down into
  such utter ruin, that not one should be left to rear itself upon the
  fragments of another!</p>

  <p>The moonbeams shone calm and pleasant on the doomed city, as they shone on
  the stunted groves of the Mount of Olives, on the distant crest of the hills
  of Moab, and, far away below these, on the desolate plains that skirt the
  waters of the Dead Sea. They shone down calm and pleasant, as though all were
  in peace and safety, and plenty and repose; yet even now the arm of the
  avenger was up to strike, the eagle's wing was pruned, his beak whetted; and
  Mariamne, standing on the terrace by her father's door, could count the Roman
  watch-fires already established in the heart of the Lower City, twinkling at
  regular distances along the summit of Mount Calvary.</p>

  <p>The view of the enemy's camp, the thought of Esca's danger, spurred her to
  exertion. She hurried along the terrace, and down into the garden, following
  the path which she knew was to lead her to the marble basin with its hidden
  entrance to the secret passage. Her only thought now was one of apprehension
  that her unassisted strength might be unable to lift the slab. Full but of
  this care, she advanced swiftly and confidently towards the disused fountain,
  to stop within ten paces of it, and almost scream aloud in the high state of
  tension to which her nerves had been strung so startled was she and scared at
  what she saw. Sitting with its back to her, a long lean figure stooped and
  cowered over the empty basin, waving its arms, and rocking its body to and
  fro with strange unearthly gestures, and broken, muttered sentences, varied
  by gasps and moans. Her nation are not superstitious, and Mariamne had too
  many causes for fear in this world to spare much dread for the denizens of
  another; nevertheless she stood for a space almost paralysed with the
  suddenness of the alarm, and the unexpected nature of the apparition, quaking
  in every limb, and unable either to advance or fly.</p>

  <p>There are times when the boldest of human minds become peculiarly
  susceptible to supernatural terrors&mdash;when the hardest and least
  impressionable persons are little stronger than their nervous and susceptible
  brethren. A little anxiety, a little privation, the omission of a meal or
  two, nay, even the converse of such abstinence in too great indulgence of the
  appetites, bring down the boasted reason of mankind to a sad state of
  weakness and credulity. The young, too, are more subject to such fantastic
  terrors than the old. Children suffer much from fears of the supernatural,
  conceiving in their vivid imaginations forms and phantoms and situations,
  which they can never have previously experienced, and of which it is
  therefore difficult to account for the origin. But all classes, and all ages,
  if they speak truth, must acknowledge, that at one time or another, they have
  felt the blood curdle, the skin creep, the breath come quick, and the heart
  rise with that desperate courage which springs from intense fear, at the
  fancied presence or the dreaded proximity of some ghostly object which eludes
  them after all, leaving a vague uncertainty behind it, that neither satisfies
  their curiosity nor ensures them against a second visitation of a similar
  nature.</p>

  <p>Mariamne was in a fit state to become the victim of any such supernatural
  delusion. Her frame was weakened by the want of food; for like the rest of
  the besieged, she had borne her share of the privations that created such
  sufferings in the city for many long weeks before it was finally reduced. She
  had gone through much fatigue of late the continuous unbroken fatigue that
  wears the spirits even faster than the bodily powers; and above all she had
  been harassed for the last few hours by the torture of inaction in a state of
  protracted suspense. It was no wonder that she should suffer a few moments of
  intense and inexplicable fear.</p>

  <p>The figure, still with its back to her, and rocking to and fro, was
  gathering handfuls of dust from the disused basin of the fountain, and
  scattering them with its long lean arms upon its head and shoulders, chanting
  at the same time, in wild, mournful tones, the words " Wash and be clean,"
  over and over again. It obviously imagined itself alone, and pursued its
  monotonous task with that dreary earnestness and endless repetition so
  peculiar to the actions of the insane.</p>

  <p>After a while, Mariamne, perceiving that she was not observed, summoned
  courage to consider what was best to be done. The secret of the hidden
  passage was one to be preserved inviolate under any circumstances; and
  to-night everything she most prized depended on its not being discovered by
  the besieged. While the figure remained in its present position, she could do
  nothing towards the furtherance of her scheme. And yet the moments were very
  precious, and Esca's life depended on her speed.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt, the unfortunate who had thus wandered into her
  father's gardens was a maniac; and those who suffered under this severe
  affliction were held in especial horror among her people. Unlike the Eastern
  nations of to-day, who believe them to be not only under its special
  protection, but even directly inspired by Providence, the Jews held that
  these sufferers were subject to the great principle of evil; that malignant
  spirits actually entered into the body of the insane, afflicting, mocking,
  and torturing their victim, goading it in its paroxysms to the exertion of
  that supernatural strength with which they endowed its body, and leaving the
  latter prostrate, exhausted, and helpless when they had satiated their malice
  upon its agonies. To be possessed of a devil was indeed the climax of all
  mental and corporeal misery. The casting out of devils by a mere word or
  sign, was perhaps the most convincing proof of miraculous power that could be
  offered to a people with whom the visitation was as general as it was
  mysterious and incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>Mariamne hovered about the fountain, notwithstanding her great fear, as a
  bird hovers about the bush under which a snake lies coiled, but which
  shelters nevertheless her nest and her callow young. Standing there, in long
  dark robes, beneath a flood of moonlight, her face and hands white as ivory
  by the contrast, her eyes dilating, her head bent forward, her whole attitude
  that of painful attention and suspense, she might have been an enchantress
  composing the spell that should turn the writhing figure before her into
  stone, cold and senseless as the marble over which it bent. She might have
  been a fiend, in the form of an angel, directing its convulsions, and
  gloating over its agonies; or she might have been a pure and trusting saint,
  exorcising the evil spirit, and bidding it come out of a vexed
  fellow-creature in that name which fiends and men and angels must alike
  obey.</p>

  <p>Presently the night-breeze coming softly over the Roman camp, brought with
  it the mellow notes of a trumpet, proclaiming that the watch was changed, and
  the centurions, each in his quarter, pacing their vigilant rounds. Ere it
  reached Mariamne's ears, the maniac had caught the sound, and sprang to his
  feet, with his head thrown back and his muscles braced for a spring like some
  beast of chase alarmed by the first challenge of the hound. Gazing wildly
  about him, he saw the girl's figure standing clear and distinct in the open
  moonlight, and raising a howl of fearful mirth, he leaped his own height from
  the ground, and made towards her with the headlong rush of a madman. Then
  fear completely overmastered her, and she turned and fled for her life. It
  was no longer a curdling horror that weighed down the limbs like lead, and
  relaxed the nerves like a palsy, but the strong and natural instinct of
  personal safety, that doubled quickness of perception for escape and speed of
  foot in flight.</p>

  <p>Between herself and her father's house lay a broad and easy range of
  steps, leading upward to the terrace. Instinctively she dared not trust the
  ascent, but turned downwards over the level lawn into the gardens, with the
  maniac in close pursuit. It was a fearful race. She heard his quick-drawn
  breath, as he panted at her very heels. She could almost fancy that she felt
  it hot upon her neck. Once the dancing shadow of her pursuer, in the
  moonlight, actually reached her own! Then she bounded forward again in her
  agony, and eluded the grasp that had but just missed its prey. Thus she
  reached a low wall, dividing her father's from a neighbour's ground; feeling
  only that she must go straight on, she bounded over it, she scarce knew how,
  and made for an open doorway she saw ahead, trusting that it might lead into
  the street. She heard his yell of triumph as he rose with a vigorous leap
  into the air, the dull stroke of his feet as he landed on the turf so close
  behind her, and the horror of that moment was almost beyond endurance.
  Besides, she felt her strength failing, and knew too well that she could not
  sustain this rate of speed for many paces farther; but escape was nearer than
  she hoped, and reaching the door a few yards before the madman, she gained
  slightly on him as she shot through it, and sped on, with weakening limbs and
  choking breath, down the street.</p>

  <p>She heard his yell once again, as he caught sight of her, but two human
  figures in front restored her courage, and she rushed on to implore their
  protection from her enemy; yet fear had not so completely mastered her self-
  possession, as to drive her into an obvious physical danger, even to escape
  encounter with a lunatic. Nearing them, and indeed almost within
  arm's-length, she perceived that one was blasted with the awful curse of
  leprosy. The moon shone bright and clear upon the white glistening surface of
  his scarred and mortifying flesh. On his brow, on his neck, in the patches of
  his wasting beard and hair, on his naked arms and chest, nay, in the very
  garment girt around his loins, the plague-spots deepened, and widened, and
  festered, and ate them all away. It would be death to come in contact, even
  with his garments nay, worse than death, for it would entail a separation
  from the touch of human hand, and the help of human skill.</p>

  <p>Yet grovelling there on the bare stones of the street, the leper was
  struggling for a bone with a strong active youth, who had nearly overpowered
  him, and whom famine had driven to subject himself to the certainty of a
  horrible and loathsome fate, rather than endure any longer its maddening
  pangs. There was scarcely a meal of offal on the prize, and yet he tore it
  from the leper whom he had overpowered, and gnawed it with a greedy brutish
  muttering, as a dog mumbles a bone.</p>

  <p>Gathering her dress around her to avoid a chance of the fatal contact,
  Mariamne scoured past the ghastly pair, even in her own imminent terror and
  distress feeling her heart bleed for this flagrant example of the sufferings
  endured by her countrymen. The maniac, however, permitted his attention to be
  diverted for a few moments, by the two struggling figures, from his pursuit;
  and Mariamne, turning quickly aside into a narrow doorway, cowered down in
  its darkest corner, and listened with feelings of relief and thankfulness to
  the steps of her pursuer, as, passing this unsuspected refuge, he sped in his
  fruitless chase along the street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-12"
     id="ch3-12">XII</a>. &mdash; DESOLATION</h2>

  <p class="first">PANTING like a hunted hind, yet true to the generous blood
  that flowed in her veins, Mariamne recovered her courage even before her
  strength. No sooner was the immediate danger passed, than she cast aside all
  thoughts of personal safety, and only considered how she might still rescue
  the man she loved. Familiar with the street in which she had taken refuge, as
  with every other nook and corner of her native city&mdash;for the Jews
  permitted their women far more liberty than did their Eastern
  neighbours&mdash;she bethought her of taking a devious round in case she
  should be followed, and then returning by the way she had come, to her
  father's gardens. It was above all things important that Eleazar should not
  be made aware of his daughter's absence; and she calculated, not without
  reason, that the fatigues he had lately gone through, would ensure a few
  hours at least of sound unbroken sleep. The domestics, too, of his household,
  worn out with watching and hunger, were not likely to be aroused before
  morning; she had, therefore, sufficient time before her to put her plan into
  execution.</p>

  <p>She reflected that it was impossible to approach her father's garden
  unnoticed at this hour, save by the way she had taken in her flight. To go
  through his house from the street was not to be thought of, as the entrance
  was probably secured, and she could not gain admittance without giving an
  explanation of her absence, and exciting the observation she most wished to
  avoid. Then she fell to thinking on the paths she had followed in her
  headlong flight, tracing them backward in her mind with that clear feminine
  perception, which so nearly approaches instinct, and is so superior to the
  more logical sagacity of man. She knew she could thread them step by step, to
  the marble basin of the fountain; and once again at that spot she felt as if
  her task would be half accomplished, instead of scarce begun. Doubtless the
  exertion of mind served to calm her recent terrors, and to distract attention
  from the dangers of her present situation&mdash; alone in a strange house,
  with the streets full of such horrors as those she had lately witnessed, and
  thronged by armed parties of lawless and desperate men.</p>

  <p>She had gathered her robes about her, and drawn her veil over her head
  preparatory to emerging from her hiding-place, when she was driven back by
  the sound of footsteps, and the clank of weapons, coming up the street. To be
  seen was to accept the certainty of insult, and to run the risk of ill-usage,
  and perhaps death. She shrank farther back, therefore, into the lower part of
  the house; and becoming more accustomed to the gloom, looked anxiously about,
  to ascertain what further chance she had within for concealment or
  escape.</p>

  <p>It was a low irregular building, of which the ground-floor seemed to have
  been used but as a space for passage to and from the upper apartments, and,
  perhaps, before the famine consumed them, as a shelter for beasts of burden,
  and for cattle. Not a particle of their refuse, however, had been left on the
  dry earthen floor; and though a wooden manger was yet standing, not a vestige
  remained of halter or tethering ropes, which had been long since eaten in the
  scarcity of food.* A boarded staircase, fenced by carved wooden balustrades,
  led from this court to the upper chambers, which were carefully closed; but a
  glimmer of light proceeding from the chinks of an ill-fitting door at its
  head, denoted that the house was not deserted. It was probably inhabited by
  some of the middle class of citizens; a rank of life that had suffered more
  than the higher, or even the lower during the siege lacking the means of the
  one, and shrinking from the desperate resources of the other.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Moreover, their hunger was so intolerable, that it
  obliged them to chew everything, while they gathered such things as the most
  sordid animals would not touch, and endured to eat them; nor did they at
  length abstain from girdles and shoes; and the very leather which belonged to
  their shields they pulled off and gnawed: the very wisps of old hay became
  food to some; and some gathered up fibres, and sold a very small weight of
  them for four Attic (drachmae).&mdash; Josephus, <i>Wars of the Jews</i>,
  Book VI.  3. ]</p>

  <p>Mariamne, listening intently to every sound, was aware of a light step
  passing to and fro, within the room, and perceived besides a savoury smell as
  of roasted flesh, which pervaded the whole house. She knew by the quiet
  footfall and the rustle of drapery, that it was a woman whose motions she
  overheard, and for an instant the desire crossed her mind to beg for a
  mouthful of strengthening food, ere she departed on her way&mdash;a request
  she had reason to believe would be refused with anger. She blushed as she
  thought how a morsel of bread was now grudged, even at her own father's gate;
  and she remembered the time when scores of poor neighbours thronged it every
  morning for their daily meal; when sheep and oxen were slain and roasted at a
  moment's notice, on the arrival of some chance guest with his train of
  followers.</p>

  <p>"It is a judgment!" thought the girl, regarding the afflictions of her
  people in the light of her new faith. "It may be, we must be purified by
  suffering, and so escape the final doom. Woe is me for my kindred and for my
  father's house! What am I, that I should not take my share in the sorrows of
  the rest?"</p>

  <p>Then in a pure and holy spirit of self-sacrifice, she turned wearily away,
  resolving rather to seek the enemy weak and fasting, than shift from her own
  shoulders one particle of the burden borne by her wretched fellow-citizens;
  and ere long the time came when she was thankful she had not partaken, even
  in thought, of the food that was then being prepared.</p>

  <p>Seeking the street once more, she found, to her dismay, that the armed
  party had halted immediately before the door. She was forced again to shrink
  back into the gloom of the lower court, and wait in fear and trembling for
  the result. These, too, had been arrested before the house by the smell of
  food. Wandering up and down the devoted city, such hungry and desperate men
  scrupled not to take with the strong hand anything of which they had need. By
  gold and silver, and soft raiment, they set now but little store&mdash; of
  wine they could procure enough to inflame and madden them, but food was the
  one passionate desire of their senses. Besides his own party, John of
  Gischala had now attached to his faction numbers of the
  <i>Sicarii</i>&mdash;a band of paid assassins who had sprung up in the late
  troubles to make a trade of murder&mdash;and had also seduced into his ranks
  such of the Zealots as were weary of Eleazar's rigid though fervent
  patriotism, finding the anarchy within the walls produced by the siege more
  to their taste than the disciplined efforts of their chief to resist the
  enemy. The party that now prevented Mariamne's egress consisted of a few
  fierce pitiless spirits from these three factions, united in a common bond of
  recklessness and crime. It was no troop for a maiden to meet by night in the
  house of a lone woman, or on the stones of a deserted street, and the girl,
  trembling at the conversation she was forced to overhear, needed all her
  courage to seize the first opportunity for escape. The clang of their arms
  made her heart leap, as they halted together at the door; but it was less
  suggestive of evil and violence than their words.</p>

  <p>"I have it!" exclaimed one, striking his mailed hand against the post,
  with a blow that vibrated through the building. "Not a bloodhound of Molossis
  hath a truer nose than mine, or hunts his game more steadily to its lair. I
  could bury my muzzle, I warrant ye, in the very entrails of my prey, had I
  but the chance. There is food here, comrades, I tell ye, cooking on purpose
  for us. 'Tis strange if we go fasting to the wall to-night!"</p>

  <p>"Well said, old dog!" laughed another voice. "Small scruple hast thou,
  Sosas, what the prey may be, so long as it hath but the blood in it. Come on;
  up to the highest seat with thee! No doubt we are expected, though the doors
  be closed and we meet with a cold welcome!"</p>

  <p>"Welcome!" repeated Sosas; "who talks of welcome? I bid ye all welcome,
  comrades. Take what you please, and call for more. Every man what he likes
  best, be it sheep or lamb, or delicate young kid, or tender sweet-mouthed
  heifer. My guests ye are, and I bid you again walk up and welcome!"</p>

  <p>"'Twere strange to find a morsel of food here, too," interposed one of the
  band. "Say, Gyron, is not this the house thou and I have already stripped
  these three times? By the beard of old Matthias, there was but half a barley-
  cake left when we made our last visit!"</p>

  <p>"True," replied Gyron, with a brutal laugh, "and the woman held on to it
  like a wild-cat. I was forced to lend her a wipe over the wrist with my
  dagger, ere she let go, and then the she-wolf sucked her own blood from the
  wound, and shrieked out that we would not even leave her that. We might let
  her alone this time, I think, and go elsewhere!"</p>

  <p>"Go to!" interrupted Sosas. "Thou speakest like one for whom the banquet
  is spread at every street corner. Art turning tender, and delicate even as a
  weaned child, with that grizzled beard on thy chin? Go to! I say. The supper
  is getting cold. Follow me!"</p>

  <p>With these words the last speaker entered the house, and proceeded to
  ascend the staircase, followed by his comrades, who pushed and shouldered
  each other through the door with ribald jest and laughter, that made their
  listeners' blood run cold. Mariamne, in her retreat, was thus compelled to
  retire step by step before them to the top of the stairs, dreading every
  moment that their eyes, gradually accustomed to the gloom, which was rendered
  more obscure by the moonlight without, should perceive her figure, and their
  relentless grasp seize upon her too surely for a prey. It was well for her
  that the stairs were very dark, and that her black dress offered no contrast
  in colour to the wall against which she shrank. The door of the upper chamber
  opened outwards, and she hid herself close behind it, hoping to escape when
  her pursuers had entered one by one. To her dismay, however, she found that,
  with more of military caution than might have been expected, they had left a
  scout below to guard against surprise. Mariamne heard the unwilling sentinel
  growling and muttering his discontent, as he paced to and fro on the floor
  beneath.</p>

  <p>Through the hinges of the open door, the upper apartment was plainly
  visible, even by the dim light of a solitary lamp that stood on the board,
  and threw its rays over the ghastly banquet there set forth. Sick, faint, and
  trembling with the great horror she beheld, Mariamne could not yet turn her
  eyes away. A gaunt grim woman was crouching at the table, holding something
  with both hands to her mouth, and glaring sidelong at her visitors, like a
  wild beast disturbed over its prey. Her grisly tresses were knotted and
  tangled on her brow; dirt, misery, and hunger were in every detail of her
  dress and person. The long lean arms and hands, with their knotted joints and
  fleshless fingers, like those of a skeleton, the sunken face, the sallow
  tight-drawn skin, through which the cheek-bones seemed about to start, the
  prominent jaw, and shrivelled neck, denoted too clearly the tortures she must
  have undergone in a protracted state of famine, bordering day by day upon
  starvation.</p>

  <p>And what was that ghastly morsel hanging from those parched thin lips?</p>

  <p>Mariamne could have shrieked aloud with mingled wrath and pity and dismay.
  Often had she seen a baby's tiny fingers pressed and mumbled in a mother's
  mouth, with doting downcast looks and gentle soothing murmurs and muttered
  phrases, fond and foolish, meaningless to others, yet every precious syllable
  a golden link of love between the woman and her child. But now, the red light
  of madness glared in the mother's eye; she was crouching fierce and startled,
  like the wild wolf in its lair, and her teeth were gnashing in her accursed
  hunger over the white and dainty limbs of her last-born child. Its little
  hand was in her mouth when the ruffians entered, whose violence and excesses
  had brought this abomination of desolation upon her house. She looked up with
  scarce a trace of humanity left in her blighted face.</p>

  <p>"You have food here, mother!" shouted Sosas, rushing in at the head of his
  comrades. "Savoury food, roasted flesh, dainty morsels. What! hast got no
  welcome for thy friends? We have come to sup with thee unbidden, mother, for
  we know of old* the house of Hyssop is never ill-provided. Ay, Gyron there,
  watching down below, misled us sadly. His talk was but of scanty barley-cakes
  and grudging welcome, while lo! here is a supper fit to set before the high-
  priest, and the mother gives a good example, though she wastes no breath on
  words of welcome. Come on, comrades, I tell you; never wait to wash hands,
  but out with your knives, and fall to!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This frightful supper is said to have been eaten in
  the dwelling of one Mary of Bethezub, which signifies the House of Hyssop.
  &mdash; Josephus, <i>Wars of the Jews</i>, Book VI.  3. ]</p>

  <p>While he spoke, the ruffian stretched his brawny arm across the table, and
  darted his long knife into the smoking dish. Mariamne behind the door, saw
  him start, and shiver, and turn pale. The others looked on, horror-struck,
  with staring eyes fixed upon the board. One, the fiercest and strongest of
  the gang, wiped his brow, and sat down, sick and gasping, on the floor. Then
  the woman laughed out, and her laughter was terrible to hear.</p>

  <p>"I did it!" she cried, in loud, triumphant tones. "He was my own child, my
  fair, fat boy. If I had a hundred sons I would slay them all. All, I tell
  you, and set them before you, that you might eat and rejoice, and depart full
  and merry from the lonely woman's house. I slew him at sundown, my masters,
  when the Sabbath was past, and I roasted him with my own hands, for we were
  alone in the house, I and my boy. What! will ye not partake? Are you so
  delicate, ye men of war, that ye cannot eat the food which keeps life in a
  poor, weak woman like me? It is good food, it is wholesome food, I tell ye,
  and I bid you hearty welcome. Eat your fill, my masters; spare not, I beseech
  you. But we will keep a portion for the child. The child!" she repeated, like
  one who speaks in a dream: "he must be hungry ere now; it is past his
  bedtime, my masters, and I have not given him his supper yet!"</p>

  <p>Then she looked on the dish once more, with a vacant, bewildered stare,
  rocking herself the while, and muttering in strange, unintelligible whispers,
  glancing from time to time stealthily at her guests, and then upon the horrid
  fragment she held, which, as though fain to hide it, she turned over and over
  in her gown. At length she broke out in another wild shriek of laughter, and
  laid her head down upon the table, hiding her face in her. hands.</p>

  <p>Pale and horror-struck, with quiet steps, and heads averted from the
  board, the gang departed one by one. Gyron, who was already wearied of his
  watch, met them on the stairs, to receive a whispered word or two from Sosas,
  with a muttered exclamation of dismay, and a frightful curse. The rest, who
  had seen what their comrade only heard, were speechless still, and Mariamne,
  listening to their clanking, measured tread as it traversed the lower court
  and passed out into the street, heard it die away in the distance, unbroken
  by a single exclamation even of disgust or surprise. The boldest of them
  dared not have stood another moment face to face with the hideous thing from
  which he fled.</p>

  <p>Mariamne, too, waited not an instant after she had made sure that they
  were gone. Not even her womanly pity for suffering could overcome her
  feelings of horror at what she had so lately beheld. She seemed stifled while
  she remained under the roof where such a scene had been enacted; and while
  she panted to quit it, was more than ever determined to seek the Roman camp,
  and call in the assistance of the enemy. It was obvious even to her, girl as
  she was, that there was now no hope for Jerusalem within the walls. While her
  father's faction, and that of John, were neutralising each other's efforts
  for the common good&mdash; while to the pressure of famine, and the necessary
  evils of a siege, were added the horrors of rapine and violence, and daily
  bloodshed, and all the worst features of civil war&mdash; it seemed that
  submission to the fiercest enemy would be a welcome refuge, that the rule of
  the sternest conqueror would be mild and merciful by comparison.</p>

  <p>She remembered, too, much that Calchas had explained in the sacred
  writings they had studied together, with the assistance of that Syrian scroll
  which proclaimed the good tidings of the new religion, elucidating and
  corroborating the old. She had not forgotten the mystical menaces of the
  prophets, the fiery denunciations of some, the distinct statements of
  others&mdash;above all, the loving, merciful warning of the Master himself.
  Surely the doom had gone forth at length. Here, if anywhere, was the carcass.
  Yonder, where she was going, was the gathering of the eagles. Was not she in
  her mission of to-night an instrument in the hands of Providence? A means for
  the fulfilment of prophecy? If she had felt patriotic scruples before, they
  vanished now. If she had shrunk from betraying her country, dishonouring her
  father, and disgracing her blood, all such considerations were as nothing
  now, compared to the hope of becoming a divine messenger, that, like the dove
  with its olive-branch, should bring back eventual peace and safety in its
  return. She had seen to-night madness and leprosy stalking abroad in the
  streets. Within a Jewish home she had seen a more awful sight even than
  these. It was in her power, at least, to put an end to such horrors, and she
  doubted whether the task might not have been specially appointed her from
  heaven; but she never asked herself the question if she would have been
  equally satisfied of her celestial mission, had Esca not been lying under the
  wall of the Temple, bound and condemned to die with the light of to-morrow's
  sun.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-13"
     id="ch3-13">XIII</a>. &mdash; THE LEGION OF THE LOST</h2>

  <p class="first">NERVING herself with every consideration that could steel a
  woman's heart, Mariamne sought her father's gardens by the way she had
  already come. They were deserted now, and the house, at which she could not
  forbear taking a look that would probably be her last, was still quiet and
  undisturbed. She would fain have seen her father once more, even in his
  sleep&mdash;would fain have kissed his unconscious brow, and so taken a
  fancied pardon for the treason she had resolved to commit&mdash; but it was
  too great a risk to run, and with a prayer for divine protection and
  assistance, she bent down to lift the slab of marble that concealed the
  secret way. Having been moved so lately in the egress of Calchas, it yielded
  easily to her strength, and she descended, not without considerable
  misgivings, a damp, winding stair, that seemed to lead into the bowels of the
  earth.</p>

  <p>As the stone fell back to its former place, she was enveloped in utter
  darkness; and while she groped her way along the slimy arch that roofed-in
  the long, mysterious tunnel, she could not forbear shuddering with dread of
  what she might encounter, ere she beheld the light of day once more. It was
  horrible to think of the reptiles that might be crawling about her feet; of
  the unknown shapes with which, at any moment, she might come in contact; of
  the chances that might block her in on both sides, and so consign her, warm
  and living, to the grave: worst of all, of the possibility that some
  demoniac, like him from whom she had so recently escaped, might have taken up
  his abode here, in the strange infatuation of the possessed, and that she
  must assuredly become his prey, without the possibility of escape.</p>

  <p>Such apprehensions made the way tedious indeed; and it was with no slight
  feeling of relief, and no mere formal thanksgiving, that Mariamne caught a
  glimpse of light stealing through the black, oppressive darkness, that seemed
  to take her breath away, and was aware that she had reached the other
  extremity of the passage at last. A few armfuls of brushwood, skilfully
  disposed, concealed its egress. These had been replaced by Calchas, in his
  late visit to the Roman camp, and Mariamne, peering through, could see
  without being seen, while she considered what step she should take next.</p>

  <p>She was somewhat uneasy, nevertheless, to observe that a Roman sentinel
  was posted within twenty paces; she could hear the clank of his armour every
  time he stirred; she could even trace the burnished plumage of the eagle on
  the crest of his helmet. It was impossible to emerge from her hiding-place
  without passing him; and short as his beat might be, he seemed indisposed to
  avail himself of it by walking to and fro. In the bright moonlight there was
  no chance of slipping by unseen, and she looked in vain for a coming cloud on
  the midnight sky. He would not even turn his head away from the city, on
  which his gaze was fastened; and she watched him with a sort of dreary
  fascination, pondering what was best to be done.</p>

  <p>Even in her extremity she could not but remark the grace of his attitude,
  and the beautiful outline of his limbs, as he leaned wearily on his spear.
  His arms and accoutrements, too, betrayed more splendour than seemed suitable
  to a mere private soldier, while his mantle was of rich scarlet, looped up
  and fastened at the shoulder with a clasp of gold. Such details she took in
  mechanically and unconsciously, even as she perceived that, at intervals, he
  raised his hand to his eyes, like one who wipes away unbidden tears. Soon she
  summoned her presence of mind, and watched him eagerly, for he stretched his
  arms towards Jerusalem with a pitiful, yearning gesture, and, bowing wearily,
  leant his crested head upon both arms, resting them against the spear.</p>

  <p>It was her opportunity, and she seized it; but at the first movement she
  made the sentinel's attention was aroused, and she knew she was discovered,
  for he challenged immediately. Even then, Mariamne could not but observe that
  his voice was unsteady, and the spear he levelled trembled like an aspen in
  his grasp. She thought it wisest to make no attempt at deception, but walking
  boldly up to him, implored his safe-conduct, and besought him to take her to
  the tent of the commander at once. The sentinel seemed uncertain how to act,
  and showed, indeed, but little of that military promptitude and decision for
  which the Roman army was so distinguished. After a pause, he
  answered&mdash;and the soft tones, musical even in their trouble, that rang
  in Mariamne's ears, were unquestionably those of a woman&mdash;a woman, too,
  whose instincts of jealousy had recognised her even before she spoke.</p>

    <p class="caption">She walked boldly up to him.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"You are the girl I saw in the amphitheatre," she said, laying a white
  hand, which trembled violently, on the arm of the Jewess. "You were watching
  him that day, when he was down in the sand beneath the net. I know you, I
  say! I marked you turned pale when the tribune's arm was up to strike. You
  loved him then. You love him now! Do not deny it, girl! lest I drive this
  spear through your body, or send you to the guard to be treated like a spy
  taken captive in the act. You look pale, too, and wretched," she added,
  suddenly relenting. "Why are you here? Why have you left him behind the walls
  alone? I would not have deserted you in your need, Esca, my lost Esca!"</p>

  <p>Mariamne shivered when she heard the beloved name pronounced in such fond
  accents by another's lips. Woman-like, she had not been without suspicions
  from the first, that her lover had gained the affections of some noble Roman
  lady&mdash; suspicions which were confirmed by his own admission to herself,
  accompanied by many a sweet assurance of fidelity and devotion; but yet it
  galled her even now, at this moment of supreme peril, to feel the old wound
  thus probed by the very hand that dealt it; and, moreover, through all her
  anxiety and astonishment, rose a bitter and painful conviction of the
  surprising beauty possessed by this shameless woman, clad thus inexplicably
  in the garb of a Roman soldier. Nevertheless, the Jewish maiden was true as
  steel. Like that mother of her nation who so readily gave up all claim to her
  own flesh and blood, to preserve it from dismemberment under the award of the
  wisest and greatest of kings, she would have saved her cherished Briton at
  any sacrifice, even that of her own constant and unfathomable love. She knelt
  down before the sentinel, and clasped the scarlet mantle in both hands.</p>

  <p>"I will not ask you what or who you are," she said; "I am in your power,
  and at your mercy. I rejoice that it is so. But you will help me, will you
  not? You will use all your beauty and all your influence to save him
  whom&mdash;whom we both love?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated while she spoke the last sentence. It was as if she gave him
  up voluntarily, when she thus acknowledged another's share. But his very life
  was at stake; and what was her sore heart, her paltry jealousy, to stand in
  the way at such a moment as this? The other looked scornfully down on the
  kneeling girl.</p>

  <p>"You, too, seem to have suffered," said the sentinel. "It is true then,
  all I have heard of the desolation and misery within the walls? But boast not
  of your sorrows; think not you alone are to be pitied. There are weary heads
  and aching hearts here in the leaguer, as yonder in the town. Tell me the
  truth, girl! What of Esca? You know him. You come from him even now. Where is
  he, and how fares it with him?"</p>

  <p>"Bound in the Outer Court of the Temple!" gasped Mariamne, "and condemned
  to die with the first light of to-morrow's sun!"</p>

  <p>His fate seemed more terrible and more certain, now that she had forced
  herself to put it into words. The Roman soldier's face turned deadly pale.
  The golden-crested helmet, laid aside for air, released a shower of rich
  brown curls, that fell over the ivory neck, and the smooth shoulders, and the
  white bosom panting beneath its breastplate. There could be no attempt at
  concealment now. Mariamne was obliged to confess that, even in her male
  attire, the woman whom she so feared, yet whom she must trust implicitly, was
  as beautiful as she seemed to be reckless and unsexed.</p>

  <p>They were a lawless and a desperate band, that body of gladiators which
  Hippias had brought with him to the siege of Jerusalem. None of them but were
  deeply stained with blood; most of them were branded with crime; all were
  hopeless of good, fearless and defiant of evil. In many a venturous assault,
  in many a hand-to-hand encounter, fought out with enemies as fierce and
  almost as skilful as themselves, they had earned their ominous title; and the
  very legionaries, though they sneered at their discipline, and denied their
  efficiency in long-protracted warfare, could not but admit that to head a
  column of attack, to run a battering-ram under the very ramparts of a
  citadel, to dash in with a mad cheer over the shattered ruins of a breach, or
  to carry out any other hot and desperate service, there were no soldiers in
  the army like the Legion of the Lost. They had dwindled away, indeed, sadly
  from slaughter and disease; yet there were still some five or six hundred
  left, and this remnant consisted of the strongest and staunchest in the band.
  They still constituted a separate legion, nor would it have been judicious to
  incorporate them with any other force, which, indeed, might have been as
  unwilling to receive them as they could be to enrol themselves in its ranks;
  and they performed the same duties, and made it their pride to guard the same
  posts they had formerly watched when thrice their present strength. Under
  these circumstances a fresh draft would have been highly acceptable to the
  Legion of the Lost; and in their daily increasing want of men, even a single
  recruit was not to be despised. Occasionally one of the Syrian auxiliaries,
  or a member of any of the irregular forces attached to the Roman army, who
  had greatly distinguished himself by his daring, was admitted into their
  band, and these additions became less rare as the original number decreased
  day by day.</p>

  <p>An appeal to the good-nature of old Hirpinus, backed by a heavy bribe to
  one of his centurions, ensured Valeria's enrolment into this wild,
  disorderly, and dangerous force; nor in their present lax state of
  discipline, with the prospect of an immediate assault, had she much to dread
  from the curiosity of her new comrades. Even in a Roman camp, money would
  purchase wine, and wine would purchase everything else. Valeria had donned in
  earnest the arms she had often before borne for sport. "Hippias taught me to
  use them," she thought, with bitter, morbid exultation; "he shall see
  to-morrow how I have profited by his lessons!" Then she resolved to feed her
  fancy by gazing at the walls of Jerusalem; and she had little difficulty in
  persuading a comrade to whom she brought a jar of strong Syrian wine, that he
  had better suffer her to relieve him for the last hour or two of his
  watch.</p>

  <p>The Amazons of old, with a courage we might look for in vain amongst the
  other sex, were accustomed to amputate their right breast that it might not
  hinder the bowstring when they drew the arrow to its head. Did they never
  feel, after the shapely bosom was thus mutilated and defaced, a throb of
  anguish, or a weight of dull dead pain where the flesh was now scarred, and
  hardened, and cicatrised&mdash;nay, something worse than pain beneath the
  wound, when they beheld a mother nursing a sucking-child? Valeria, too, had
  resolved, so to speak, that she would cut the very heart from out of her
  breast&mdash;that she would never feel as a woman feels again. She knew she
  was miserable, degraded, desperate&mdash; she believed she could bear it
  nobly now, because she was turned to stone. Yet, as she leaned on her spear
  in the moonlight, and gazed on the city which contained the prize she had so
  coveted and lost, she was compelled to acknowledge that the fibres of that
  heart she had thought to tear out and cast away, retained their feelings
  still. For all that was come and gone, she loved him, oh! so dearly, yet; and
  the eyes of the lost, maddened, desperate woman filled with tears of as deep
  and unselfish affection as could have been shed by Mariamne herself in her
  pure and stainless youth.</p>

  <p>Valeria, as Hippias had learned by painful experience, was resolute for
  good and evil. It was this decision of character, joined to the impulsive
  disposition which springs from an undisciplined life, that had given him his
  prey. But it was this that thwarted all the efforts he made to obtain the
  ascendency over her which generally follows such a link as theirs; and it was
  this, too, that ere long caused her to tear the link asunder without a
  moment's apprehension or remorse. With all his energy and habits of command,
  the gladiator found he could not control the proud Roman lady, who in a
  moment of caprice had bowed her head to the very dust for the sake of
  following him. He could neither intimidate her into obedience, nor crush her
  into despair, though he tried many a haughty threat, and many an unmanly
  taunt at her shame. But all in vain; and as he would not yield an inch in
  their disputes, there was but little peace in the tent of the brave leader
  who ruled so sternly over the Legion of the Lost. The pair, indeed, went
  through the usual phases that accompany such bonds as those they chose to
  wear; but the changes were more rapid than common, as might well be expected,
  when their folly had not even the excuse of true affection on both sides.
  Valeria indeed tired first; for as far as the gladiator was capable of loving
  anything but his profession, he loved her, and this perhaps only embittered
  the guilty cup that was already sufficiently unpalatable to both. Weariness,
  as usual, followed fast on the heels of satiety, to be succeeded by
  irritation, discontent, and dislike; then came rude words, angry gestures,
  and overt aggression from the man, met by the woman with trifling
  provocations, mute defiance, and sullen scorn. To love another, too, so
  hopelessly and so dearly, made Valeria's lot even more difficult to bear,
  rendering her fretful, intolerant, and inaccessible to all efforts at
  reconciliation. Thus the breach widened hour by hour; and on the day when
  Hippias returned to his tent from the council of war before which Calchas had
  been brought, Valeria quitted it, vowing never to return. She had but one
  object left for which to live.</p>

  <p>Maddened by shame, infuriated by the insults of the gladiator, her great
  love yet surged up in her heart with an irresistible tide; and she resolved
  that she would see Esca once more, ay, though the whole Jewish army stood
  with levelled spears between them. After that, she cared not if she died on
  the spot at his feet!</p>

  <p>To get within the works was indeed no easy matter; and so close a watch
  was kept by the Romans on all movements between the lines of the hostile
  forces, now in such dangerous proximity, that it was impossible to escape
  from the camp of Titus and join the enemy behind the wall, though the Jews,
  notwithstanding the vigilance of their countrymen, were trooping to the
  besiegers' camp by scores, to implore the protection of the conqueror, and
  throw themselves on his well-known clemency and moderation.</p>

  <p>Valeria, then, had taken the desperate resolution of entering the city
  with the assault on the morrow. For this purpose she had adopted the dress
  and array of the Lost Legion. She would at least, she thought in her despair,
  be as forward as any of those reckless combatants. She would, at least, see
  Esca once more. If he met her under shield, not knowing her, and hurled her
  to the ground, the arm that smote her would be that of her glorious and
  beloved Briton. There was a wild, sweet sadness in the thought that she might
  perhaps die at last by his hand. Full of such morbid fancies&mdash;her
  imagination over-excited, her courage kindled, her nerves strung to their
  highest pitch&mdash;it brought with it a fearful reaction to learn that even
  her last consolation might be denied her&mdash;that the chance of meeting her
  lover once more was no longer in her own hands. What! had she undergone all
  these tortures, submitted to all this degradation, for nothing? And was Esca
  to die after all, and never learn that she had loved him to the last? She
  could not have believed it, but for the calm, hopeless misery that she read
  in Mariamne's eyes.</p>

  <p>For a while Valeria covered her face and remained silent; then she looked
  down scornfully on the Jewess, who was still on her knees, holding the hem of
  the Roman lady's garment, and spoke in a cold, contemptuous tone&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Bound and condemned to death, and you are here? You must indeed love him
  very dearly to leave him at such a time!"</p>

  <p>Mariamne's despair was insensible to the taunt.</p>

  <p>"I am here," said she. "to save him. It is the only chance. Oh, lady, help
  me! help me if only for his dear sake!"</p>

  <p>"What would you have me do?" retorted the other impatiently. "Can I pull
  down your fortified wall with my naked hands? Can you and I storm the rampart
  at point of spear, and bear him away from the midst of the enemy to share him
  afterwards between us, as the legionaries share a prey?"&mdash;and she
  laughed a strange, choking laugh while she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Nay," pleaded the kneeling Jewess. "look not down on me so angrily. I
  pray&mdash;I implore you only to aid me! Ay! though you slay me afterwards
  with your hand if I displease you by word or deed. Listen, noble lady; I can
  lead the Roman army within the walls; I can bring the soldiers of Titus into
  Jerusalem, maniple by maniple, and cohort by cohort, where they shall
  surprise my countrymen and obtain easy possession of the town; and all I ask
  in return&mdash;the price of my shame, the reward of my black
  treachery&mdash;is, that they will rescue the two prisoners bound in the
  Outer Court of the Temple, and spare their lives for her sake who has sold
  honour, and country, and kindred here to-night!"</p>

  <p>Valeria reflected for a few seconds. The plan promised well; her woman's
  intuition read the secret of the other woman's heart. A thousand schemes rose
  rapidly in her brain; schemes of love, of triumph, of revenge. Was it
  feasible? She ran over the position of the wall, the direction from which
  Mariamne had come, her own knowledge gained from the charts she had studied
  in the tent of Hippias&mdash; charts that, obtained partly by treachery and
  partly by observation, mapped out every street and terrace in
  Jerusalem&mdash;and she thought it was. Of her suppliant's good faith she
  entertained no doubt</p>

  <p>"There is then a secret passage?" she said, preserving still a stern and
  haughty manner to mask the anxiety she really felt. "How long is it, and how
  many men will it take in abreast?"</p>

  <p>"It cannot be far," answered the Jewess. "since it extends but from that
  heap of brushwood to the terrace of my father's house. It might hold three
  men abreast. I entreat you take me to Titus, that I may prevail on him to
  order the attack ere it be too late. I myself will conduct his soldiers into
  the city."</p>

  <p>Valeria's generosity was not proof against her selfishness. Like many
  other women, her instincts of possession were strong; and no sooner had she
  grasped the possibility of saving Esca, than the old fierce longing to have
  him for her very own returned with redoubled force.</p>

  <p>"That I may rescue the Briton for the Jewess!" she retorted, with a sneer.
  "Do you know to whom you speak? Listen, girl: I, too, have loved this Esca:
  loved him with a love to which yours is but as the glimmer on my helmet
  compared to the red glare of that watch-fire below the hill&mdash; loved him
  as the tigress loves her cubs&mdash;nay, sometimes as the tigress loves her
  prey! Do you think I will save him for another?"</p>

  <p>Mariamne's face was paler than ever now, but her voice was clear, though
  very low and sad, while she replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You love him too! I know it, lady, and therefore I ask you to save him.
  Not for me; oh! not for me! When he is once set free, I will never see him
  more: this is your price, is it not? Willingly, heartily I pay it; only save
  him only save him! You will, lady; will you not? And so you will take me
  direct to Titus? See! the middle watch of the night is already nearly
  past."</p>

  <p>But Valeria's plotting brain began now to shape its plans; she saw the
  obstacles in her way were she to conduct the girl at once into the presence
  of Titus. Her own disguise would be discovered, and the Roman commander was
  not likely to permit such a flagrant breach of discipline and propriety to
  pass unnoticed. If not punished, she would probably be at least publicly
  shamed, and placed under restraint. Moreover, the prince might hesitate to
  credit Mariamne's story, and suspect the whole scheme was but a plot to lead
  the attacking party into an ambush. Besides, she would never yield to the
  Jewess the credit and the privilege of saving her lover. No: she had a better
  plan than this. She knew that Titus had resolved the city should fall on the
  morrow. She knew the assault would take place at dawn; she would persuade
  Mariamne to return into the town; she would mark the secret entrance well.
  When the gladiators advanced to the attack, she would lead a chosen band by
  this path into the very heart of the city; she would save Esca at the supreme
  moment; and surely his better feelings would acknowledge her sovereignty
  then, when she came to him as a deliverer and a conqueror, like some fabulous
  heroine of his own barbarian nation. She would revenge on Hippias all the
  past weary months of discord; she would laugh Placidus to scorn with his
  subtle plans and his venturous courage, and the skill he boasted in the art
  of war. Nay, even Licinius himself would be brought to acknowledge her in her
  triumph, and be forced to confess that, stained, degraded as she was, his
  kinswoman had at last proved herself a true scion of their noble line, worthy
  of the name of Roman! There was a sting, though, in a certain memory that
  Mariamne's words brought back; their very tone recalled his, when he too had
  offered to sacrifice his love that he might save its object&mdash;and she
  thought how different were their hearts to hers. But the pain only goaded her
  into action, and she raised the still kneeling girl with a kindly gesture,
  and a reassuring smile.</p>

  <p>"You can trust me to save him," said she; "but it would be unwise to
  declare your plan to Titus. He would not believe it, but would simply make
  you a prisoner, and prevent me from fulfilling my object till too late. Show
  me the secret path, girl; and by all a woman holds most sacred, by all I have
  most prized, yet lost, I swear to you that the eagles shall shake their wings
  in the Temple by to-morrow's sunrise; that I will cut Esca's bonds with the
  very sword that hangs here in my belt! Return the way you came; be careful to
  avoid observation; and if you see Valeria again alive, depend upon her
  friendship and protection for his sake whom you and I shall have saved from
  death before another day be past!"</p>

  <p>So strangely constituted are women, that something almost like a caress
  passed between these two, as the one gave and the other received the solemn
  pledge; although Mariamne yielded but unwillingly to Valeria's arguments, and
  sought the secret way on her return with slow reluctant steps. But she had no
  alternative; and the Roman lady's certainty of success imparted some of her
  own confidence to the weary and desponding Jewess. "At least," thought
  Mariamne, "if I cannot save him, I can die with him, and then nothing can
  separate us any more!" Sad as it was, she yet felt comforted by the hopeless
  reflection, while it urged her to hasten to her lover at once.</p>

  <p>There was no time to be lost. As she looked back to the Roman sentinel,
  once more motionless on his post, and waved her hand with a gesture that
  seemed to implore assistance, while it expressed confidence, ere she stooped
  to remove the brushwood for her return, a peal of Roman trumpets broke on the
  silence, sounding out the call which was termed "cock-crow," an hour before
  the dawn.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-14"
     id="ch3-14">XIV</a>. &mdash; FAITH</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is nothing in the history of ancient or modern times
  that can at all help us to realise the feelings with which the Jews regarded
  their Temple. To them the sacred building was not only the very type and
  embodiment of their religion, but it represented also the magnificence of
  their wealth, the pride of their strength, the glory, the antiquity, and the
  patriotism of the whole people&mdash;noble in architecture, imposing in
  dimensions, and glittering with ornament, it was at once a church, a citadel,
  and a palace. If a Jew would express the attributes of strength, symmetry, or
  splendour, he compared the object of his admiration with the Temple. His
  prophecies continually alluded to the national building as being identical
  with the nation itself; and to speak of injury or contamination to the Temple
  was tantamount to a threat of defeat by foreign arms, and invasion by a
  foreign host as its demolition was always considered synonymous with the
  total destruction of Judaea; for no Jew could contemplate the possibility of
  a national existence apart from this stronghold of his faith. His tendency
  thus to identify himself with his place of worship was also much fostered by
  the general practice of his people, who annually flocked to Jerusalem in
  great multitudes to keep the feast of the Passover; so that there were few of
  the posterity of Abraham throughout the whole of Syria who had not at some
  time in their lives been themselves eye-witnesses of the glories in which
  they took such pride. At the period when the Roman army invested the Holy
  City, an unusually large number of these worshippers had congregated within
  its walls, enhancing to a great degree the scarcity of provisions, and all
  other miseries inseparable from a state of siege.</p>

  <p>The Jews defended their Temple to the last While the terrible circle was
  contracting day by day, while suburb after suburb was taken, and tower after
  tower destroyed, they were driven, and, as it were, condensed gradually and
  surely, towards the upper city and the Holy Place itself. They seemed to
  cling round the latter and to trust in it for protection, as though its very
  stones were animated by the sublime worship they had been reared to
  celebrate.</p>

  <p>It was a little before the dawn, and the Outer Court of the Temple, called
  the Court of the Gentiles, was enveloped in the gloom of this, the darkest
  hour in the whole twenty-four. Nothing could be distinguished of its
  surrounding cloisters, save here and there the stem of a pillar or the
  segment of an arch, only visible because brought into relief by the black
  recesses behind. A star or two were faintly twinkling in the open sky
  overhead; but the morning was preceded by a light vapoury haze, and the
  breeze that wafted it came moist and chill from the distant sea, wailing and
  moaning round the unseen pillars and pinnacles of the mighty building above.
  Except the sacred precincts themselves, this was perhaps the only place of
  security left to the defenders of Jerusalem; and here, within a
  spear's-length of each other, they had bound the two Christians, doomed by
  the Sanhedrim to die. Provided with a morsel of bread, scarce as it was, and
  a jar of water, supplied by that spurious mercy which keeps the condemned
  alive in order to put him to death, they had seen the Sabbath, with its
  glowing hours of fierce pitiless heat, pass slowly and wearily away; they had
  dragged through the long watches of the succeeding night, and now they were
  on the brink of that day, which was to be their last on earth.</p>

  <p>Esca stirred uneasily where he sat; and the movement seemed to rouse his
  companion from a fit of deep abstraction, which, judging by the cheerful
  tones of his voice, could have been of no depressing nature.</p>

  <p>"It hath been a tedious watch," said Calchas. "and I am glad it is over.
  See, Esca, the sky grows darker and darker, even like our fate on earth. In a
  little while day will come, and with it our great and crowning triumph. How
  glorious will be the light shining on thee and me, in another world, an hour
  after dawn!"</p>

  <p>The Briton looked admiringly at his comrade, almost envying him the
  heartfelt happiness and content betrayed by his very accents. He had not
  himself yet arrived at that pinnacle of faith, on which his friend stood so
  confidently; and, indeed, Providence seems to have ordained, that in most
  cases such piety should be gradually and insensibly attained, that the ascent
  should be won slowly step by step, and that even as a man breasting a
  mountain scales height after height, and sees his horizon widening mile by
  mile as he strains towards its crest, so the Christian must toil ever
  upwards, thankful to gain a ridge at a time, though he finds that it but
  leads him to a higher standard and a farther aim; and that, though his view
  is extending all around, and increasing knowledge takes in much of which he
  never dreamed before, the prospect expands but as the eye ascends, while
  every summit gained is an encouragement to attempt another, nobler, and
  higher, and nearer yet to heaven.</p>

  <p>"It will be daylight in an hour," said Esca, in a far less cheerful voice.
  "and the cowards will be here to pound us to death against this pavement with
  their cruel stones. I would fain have my bonds cut, and a weapon within reach
  at the last moment, Calchas, and so die at bay amongst them, sword in
  hand!"</p>

  <p>"Be thankful that a man's death is not at his own choice," replied Calchas
  gently. "How would poor human nature be perplexed, to take the happy method
  and the proper moment! Be thankful, above all things, for the boon of death
  itself. It was infinite mercy that bade the inevitable deliverer wait on sin.
  What curse could equal an immortality of evil? Would you live for ever in
  such a world as ours if you could? nay, you in your youth, and strength, and
  beauty, would you wish to remain till your form was bent, and your beard
  grey, and your eyes dim? Think, too, of the many deaths you might have
  died,&mdash;stricken with leprosy, crouching like a dog in some hidden corner
  of the city, or wasted by famine, gnawing a morsel of offal from which the
  sustenance had long since been extracted by some wretch already perished. Or
  burnt and suffocated amongst the flaming ramparts, like the maniple of Romans
  whom you yourself saw consumed over against the Tower of Antonia but a few
  short days ago!"</p>

  <p>"That, at least, was a soldier's death," replied Esca, to whose resolute
  nature the idea of yielding up his life without a struggle seemed so hard.
  "Or I might have fallen by sword-stroke, or spear-thrust, on the wall, like a
  man. But to be stoned to death, as the shepherds stone a jackal in his hole!
  It is a horrible and an ignoble fate!"</p>

  <p>"Would you put away from you the great glory that is offered you?" asked
  Calchas gravely. "Would you die but as a heathen, or one of our own miserable
  Robbers and Zealots, of whom the worst do not hesitate to give their blood
  for Jerusalem? Are you not better, and braver, and nobler than any of these?
  Listen, young man, to him who speaks to you now words for which he must
  answer at the great tribunal ere another hour be past. Proud should you be of
  His favour whom you will be permitted to glorify to-day. Ashamed, indeed, as
  feeling your own unworthiness, yet exulting that you, a young and
  inexperienced disciple, should have been ranked amongst the leaders and the
  champions of the true faith. Look upon me, Esca, bound and waiting here like
  yourself for death. For two-score years have I striven to follow my Master,
  with feeble steps, indeed, and many a sad misgiving and many a humbling fall.
  For two-score years have I prayed night and morning; first, that I might have
  strength to persevere in the way that I had been taught, so that I might
  continue amongst His servants, even though I were the very lowest of the low.
  Secondly, that if ever the time should come when I was esteemed worthy to
  suffer for His sake, I might not be too much exalted with that glory which I
  have so thirsted to attain. I tell thee, boy, that in an hour's time from
  now, thou and I shall be received by those good and great men of whom I have
  so often spoken to thee, coming forward in shining garments, with
  outstretched arms, to welcome our approach, and lead us into the eternal
  light of which I dare not speak even now, in the place which eye hath not
  seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived. And all this guerdon is
  for thee, coming into the vineyard at the eleventh hour, yet sharing with
  those who have borne the labour and heat of the day. Oh, Esca, I have loved
  thee like a son, yet from my heart, I cannot wish thee anywhere but bound
  here by my side this night."</p>

  <p>The other could not but kindle with his companion's enthusiasm. "Oh, when
  they come," said he, "they shall find me ready. And I too, Calchas, believe
  me, would not flinch from thee now if I could. Nay, if it be His will that I
  must be stoned to death here in the Outer Court of the Temple, I have learned
  from thee, old friend, gratefully and humbly to accept my lot. Yet I am but
  human, Calchas. Thou sayest truly, I lack the long and holy training of thy
  two-score years. I have a tie that binds me fast to earth. It is no sin to
  love Mariamne, and I would fain see her once again."</p>

  <p>A tear rose to the old man's eye. Chastened, purified, as was his spirit,
  and ready to take its flight for home, he could yet feel for human love. Nay,
  the very ties of kindred were strong within him, here in his place of
  suffering, as they had been at his brother's hearth. It was no small subject
  of congratulation to him, that his confession of faith before the Sanhedrim,
  while it vindicated his Master's honour, should at the same time have
  preserved Eleazar's character in the eyes of the nation, while his exultation
  at the prospect of sharing with his disciple the glory of martyrdom, was
  damped by the reflection that Mariamne must grieve bitterly, as the human
  heart will, ere her nobler and holier self could become reconciled to her
  loss. For a moment he spoke not, though his lips moved in silent prayer for
  both, and Esca pursued the subject that occupied most of his thoughts even at
  such an hour as this.</p>

  <p>"I would fain see her," he repeated dreamily. "I loved her so well; my
  beautiful Mariamne. And yet it is a selfish and unworthy wish. She would
  suffer so much to look on me lying bound and helpless here. She will know,
  too, when it is over, that my last thought was of her, and it may be she will
  weep because she was not here to catch my last look before I died. Tell me,
  Calchas, I shall surely meet her in that other world? It can be no sin to
  love her as I have loved!"</p>

  <p>"No sin," repeated Calchas gravely; "none. The God who bears such love for
  them has called nine-tenths of His creatures to His knowledge through their
  affections. When these are suffered to become the primary object of the
  heart, it may be that He will see fit to crush them in the dust, and will
  smite, with the bitterest of all afflictions, yet only that He may heal. How
  many men have followed the path to heaven that was first pointed out by a
  woman's hand? That a woman hath perhaps gone on to tread, beckoning him after
  her as she vanished, with a holy hopeful smile. No, Esca, it is not sin to
  love as thou hast done; and because thou hast not scrupled to give up even
  this, the great and precious treasure of thy heart, for thy Master's honour,
  thou shalt not lose thy reward."</p>

  <p>"And I shall see her again," he insisted, clinging yet somewhat to earthly
  feelings and earthly regrets, for was he not but a young and untrained
  disciple?" It seems to me, that it would be unjust to part her from me for
  ever. It seems to me that heaven itself would not be heaven away from
  her!"</p>

  <p>"I fear thou art not fit to die," replied Calchas, in a low and sorrowful
  voice. "Pray, my son, pray fervently, unceasingly, that the human heart may
  be taken away from thee, and the new heart given which will fit thee for the
  place whither thou goest to-day. It is not for thee and for me to say, 'Give
  me here, Father, a morsel of bread, or give me there a cup of wine.'We need
  but implore in our prayers, of Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Mercy, to grant
  that which it knows is best for our welfare; and He who has taught us how to
  pray, has bidden us, even before we ask for food, acknowledge a humble
  unquestioning resignation to the will of our Father which is in heaven. Leave
  all to Him, my son, satisfied that He will grant thee what is best for thy
  welfare. Distress not thyself with weak misgivings, nor subtle reasonings,
  nor vain inquiries. Trust, only trust and pray, here in the court of death,
  as yonder on the rampart, or at home by the beloved hearth, so shalt thou
  obtain the victory; for, indeed, the battle draweth nigh. The watches of the
  night are past, and it is already time to buckle on our armour for the
  fight."</p>

  <p>While he spoke the old man pointed to the east, where the first faint
  tinge of dawn was stealing up into the sky. Looking into his companion's
  face, only now becoming visible in the dull twilight, he was struck with the
  change that a few hours of suffering and imprisonment had wrought upon those
  fair young features. Esca seemed ten years older in that one day and night;
  nor could Calchas repress a throb of exultation, as he thought how his own
  time-worn frame and feeble nature had been supported by the strong faith
  within. The feeling, however, was but momentary, for the Christian identified
  himself at once with the suffering and the sorrowful; nor would he have
  hesitated in the hearty self-sacrificing spirit that his faith had taught
  him, that no other faith either provides or enjoins, to take on his own
  shoulders the burden that seemed so hard for his less-advanced brother to
  bear. It was no self-confidence that gave the willing martyr such invincible
  courage; but it was the thorough abnegation of self, the entire dependence on
  Him, who alone never fails man at his need, the fervent faith, which could
  see so clearly through the mists of time and humanity, as to accept the
  infinite and the eternal for the visible, and the tangible, and the real.</p>

  <p>They seemed to have changed places now; that doomed pair waiting in their
  bonds for death. The near approach of morning seemed to call forth the
  exulting spirit of the warrior in the older man, to endow the younger with
  the humble resignation of the saint.</p>

  <p>"Pray for me that I may be thought worthy," whispered the latter, pointing
  upwards to the grey light widening every moment above their heads.</p>

  <p>"Be of good cheer," replied the other, his whole face kindling with a
  triumphant smile. "Behold, the day is breaking, and thou and I have done with
  night, henceforth, for evermore!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-15"
     id="ch3-15">XV</a>. &mdash; FANATICISM</h2>

  <p class="first">WHILE faith has its martyrs, fanaticism also can boast its
  soldiers and its champions. Calchas in his bonds was not more in earnest than
  Eleazar in his breastplate; but the zeal that brought peace to the one,
  goaded the other into a restless energy of defiance, which amounted in itself
  to torture.</p>

  <p>The chief of the Zealots was preparing for the great struggle that his
  knowledge of warfare, no less than the words of his brother before the
  Sanhedrim (words which yet rang in his ears with a vague monotony of
  repetition), led him to expect with morning. Soon after midnight, he had woke
  from the slumber in which Mariamne left him wrapped, and without making
  inquiry for his daughter, or indeed taking any thought of her, he had armed
  himself at once and prepared to visit the renewed defences with the first
  glimpse of day. To do so he was obliged to pass through the Court of the
  Gentiles, where his brother and his friend lay bound; for in the strength of
  the Temple itself consisted the last hopes of the besieged, and its security
  was of the more importance now that the whole of the lower town was in
  possession of the enemy. Eleazar had decided that if necessary he would
  abandon the rest of the city to the Romans, and throwing himself with a
  chosen band into this citadel and fortress of his faith, would hold it to the
  last, and rather pollute the sacred places with his blood, than surrender
  them into the hand of the Gentiles. Sometimes, in his more exalted moments,
  he persuaded himself that even at the extremity of their need, Heaven would
  interpose for the rescue of the chosen people. As a member of the Sanhedrim
  and one of the chief nobility of the nation, he had not failed to acquire the
  rudiments of that magic lore, which was called the science of divination.
  Formerly, while in compliance with custom he mastered the elements of the
  art, his strong intellect laughed to scorn the power it pretended to confer,
  and the mysteries it professed to expound. Now, harassed by continual
  anxiety, sapped by grief and privation, warped by the unvaried predominance
  of one idea, the sane mind sought refuge in the shadowy possibilities of the
  supernatural, from the miseries and horrors of its daily reality.</p>

  <p>He recalled the prodigies, of which, though he had not himself been an
  eye-witness, he had heard from credible and trustworthy sources. They could
  not have been sent, he thought, only to alarm and astonish an ignorant
  multitude. Signs and wonders must have been addressed to him, and men like
  him, leaders and rulers of the people. He never doubted now that a sword of
  fire had been seen flaming over the city in the midnight sky; that a heifer,
  driven there for sacrifice, had brought forth a lamb in the midst of the
  Temple; or that the great sacred gate of brass in the same building had
  opened of its own accord in the middle watch of the night; nay, that chariots
  and horsemen of fire had been seen careering in the heavens, and fierce
  battles raging from the horizon to the zenith, with alternate tide of
  conquest and defeat, with all the slaughter and confusion and vicissitudes of
  mortal war.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* For a description of these portentous appearances,
  both previous to and during the siege of Jerusalem, see Josephus, <i>Wars of
  the Jews</i>, Book VI.  5, as related by the historian with perfect good
  faith, and no slight reproaches to the incredulity of his obdurate countrymen
  that generation of whom the greatest authority has said. "Except ye see signs
  and wonders, ye will not believe." ]</p>

  <p>These considerations endowed him with the exalted confidence which borders
  on insanity. As the dreamer finds himself possessed of supernatural strength
  and daring, attempting and achieving feats which yet he knows the while are
  impossibilities, so Eleazar, walking armed through the waning night towards
  the Temple, almost believed that with his own right hand he could save his
  country&mdash;almost hoped that with daylight he should find an angel or a
  fiend at his side empowered to assist him, and resolved that he would accept
  the aid of either, with equal gratitude and delight.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, as he entered the cloisters that surrounded the Court of the
  Gentiles, his proud crest sank, his step grew slower and less assured. Nature
  prevailed for an instant, and he would fain have gone over to that gloomy
  corner, and bidden his brother a last kind farewell. The possibility even
  crossed his brain of drawing his sword and setting the prisoners free by a
  couple of strokes, bidding them escape in the darkness, and shift for
  themselves; but the fanaticism which had been so long gaining on his better
  judgment, checked the healthy impulse as it arose. "It may be," thought the
  Zealot. "that this last great sacrifice is required from me&mdash;from me,
  Eleazar Ben-Manahem, chosen to save my people from destruction this day.
  Shall I grudge the victim, bound as he is now with cords to the altar? No,
  not though my father's blood will redden it when he dies. Shall I spare the
  brave young Gentile, who hath been to me as a kinsman, though but a stranger
  within my gate, if his life too be required for an oblation? No! not though
  my child's heart will break when she learns that he is gone forth into the
  night, never to return. Jephthah grudged not his daughter to redeem his vow;
  shall I murmur to yield the lives of all my kindred, freely as mine own, for
  the salvation of Jerusalem?" And thus thinking, he steeled himself against
  every softer feeling, and resolved he would not even bid the prisoners
  farewell. He could not trust himself. It might unman him. It might destroy
  his fortitude; nay, it might even offend the vengeance he hoped to
  propitiate. Besides, if he were known to have held communication with two
  professed Christians, where would be the popularity and influence on which he
  calculated to bear him in triumph through the great decisive struggle of the
  day? It was better to stifle such foolish yearnings. It was wiser to harden
  his heart and pass by on the other side.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he paused for a moment and stretched his arms with a yearning
  gesture towards that corner in which his brother lay bound, and, while he did
  so, a light step glided by in the gloom; a light figure passed so near that
  it almost touched him, and a woman's lips were pressed to the hem of his
  garment with a long clinging kiss, that bade him a last farewell.</p>

  <p>Mariamne, returning to the city by the secret way from her interview with
  Valeria in the Roman camp, had been careful not to enter her father's house,
  lest her absence might have been discovered, and her liberty of action for
  the future impaired. She would have liked to see that father once more; but
  all other considerations were swallowed up in the thought of Esca's danger,
  and the yearning to die with him if her efforts had been too late to save.
  She sped accordingly through the dark streets to the Temple, despising, or
  rather ignoring, those dangers which had so terrified her in her progress
  during the earlier part of the night. While she stole under the shadow of the
  cloisters towards her lover, her ear recognised the sound of a familiar step,
  and her eye, accustomed to the gloom, and sharpened by a child's affection,
  made out the figure of her father, armed and on his way to the wall. She
  could not but remember that the morning light which was to bring certain
  death to Esca, might not, improbably shine upon Eleazar's corpse as well. He
  would defend the place she knew to the last drop of his blood; and the Roman
  would never enter the Temple but over the Zealot's body. She could never hope
  to see him again, the father whom, notwithstanding his fierceness and his
  faults, she could not choose but love. And all she could do was to shed a
  tear upon his garment, and wish him this silent and unacknowledged farewell.
  Thus it was that Eleazar bore with him into the battle the last caress he was
  ever destined to receive from his child.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-16"
     id="ch3-16">XVI</a>. &mdash; DAWN</h2>

  <p class="first">THE day soon broke in earnest, cold and pale on the towers
  and pinnacles of the Temple. The lofty dome that had been looming in the sky,
  grand and grey and indistinct, like the mass of clouds that rolls away before
  the pure clear eye of morning, glowed with a flush of pink; and changed again
  to its own glittering white of polished marble, as its crest caught the full
  beams of the rising sun. Ere long the golden roof was sparkling here and
  there in points of fire, to blaze out at last in one dazzling sheet of flame;
  but still the Court of the Gentiles below was wrapped in gloom, and the two
  bound figures in its darkest corner, turned their pale faces upward to greet
  the advent of another day&mdash;their last on earth.</p>

  <p>But their attention was soon recalled to the court itself; for through the
  dark recesses of the vaulted cloisters, was winding an ominous procession of
  those who had been their judges, and who now approached to seal the fiat of
  their doom. Clad in long dark robes, and headed by their " Nasi," they paced
  slowly out, marching two by two with solemn step and stern unpitying mien: it
  was obvious that the Sanhedrim adhered strictly to that article of their
  code, which enjoined them to perform justice without mercy. Gravely advancing
  with the same slow step, gradual and inevitable as time, they ranged
  themselves in a semicircle round the prisoners&mdash;then halted every man at
  the same moment; while all exclaimed as with one voice, to notify their
  completion and their unanimity&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Here in the presence of the Lord!"</p>

  <p>Again a deathlike silence, intolerable, and apparently interminable to the
  condemned. Even Calchas felt his heart burn with a keen sense of injustice
  and a strange instinct of resistance; while Esca, rising to his full height,
  and in spite of his bonds, folding his brawny arms across his chest, frowned
  back at the pitiless assembly a defiance that seemed to challenge them to do
  their worst. Matthias the son of Boethus then stepped forward from amongst
  his fellows; and addressed, according to custom, the youngest member of the
  Sanhedrim.</p>

  <p>"Phineas Ben-Ezra. Hath the doom gone forth?"</p>

  <p>"It hath gone forth through the nation," answered Phineas, in deep
  sonorous tones. "To north and south, to east and west; to all the people of
  Judaea hath the inevitable decree been made manifest. The accuser hath spoken
  and prevailed. The accused have been judged and condemned. It is well. Let
  the sentence be executed without delay!"</p>

  <p>"Phineas Ben-Ezra," interposed Matthias. "can the condemned put forth no
  plea for pardon or reprieve?"</p>

  <p>It was according to ancient custom that the Nasi should even at the last
  moment urge this merciful appeal&mdash;an appeal that never obtained a
  moment's respite for the most innocent of sufferers. Ere Calchas or Esca
  could have said a word on their own behalf, Phineas took upon himself the
  established reply&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The voice of the Sanhedrim hath spoken! There is no plea; there is no
  pardon; there is no reprieve."</p>

  <p>Then Matthias raised both hands above his head, and spoke in low grave
  accents&mdash;</p>

  <p>"For the accused, justice; for the offender, death. The Sanhedrim hath
  heard; the Sanhedrim hath judged; the Sanhedrim hath condemned. It is
  written, 'If a man be found guilty of blasphemy, let him be stoned with
  stones until he die!' Again I say unto you, Calchas Ben-Manahem, and you,
  Esca the Gentile, your blood be upon your own heads."</p>

  <p>Lowering his hands, the signal was at once answered by the inward rush of
  some score or two of vigorous young men, who had been in readiness outside
  the court. These were stripped to the waist, and had their loins girt. Some
  bore huge stones in their bare arms; others, loosening the pavement with crow
  and pick-axe, stooped down and tore it up with a fierce and cruel energy, as
  though they had already been kept waiting too long. They were followers of
  John of Gischala, and their chief, though he took no part in the proceeding,
  stood at their head. His first glance was one of savage triumph, which faded
  into no less savage disappointment, as he saw Eleazar's place vacant in the
  assembly of judges that warrior's duties against the enemy excusing his
  attendance on the occasion. John had counted on this critical moment for the
  utter discomfiture of his rival; but the latter, whose fortitude, strung as
  it had been to the highest pitch, could scarcely have carried him through
  such a trial as was prepared for him, had escaped it by leading a chosen band
  of followers to the post of danger, where the inner wall was weakest, and the
  breach so lately made had been hastily and insufficiently repaired.</p>

  <p>John saw in this well-timed absence another triumph for his invincible
  enemy. He turned away with a curse upon his lips, and ordered the young men
  to proceed at once in the execution of their ghastly duty. It seemed to him
  that he must not lose a moment in following his rival to the wall, yet he
  could not resist the brutal pleasure of witnessing that rival's brother lying
  defaced and mangled in the horrible death to which he had been condemned.
  Already the stones were poised, the fierce brows knit, the bare arms raised,
  when even the savage executioners held their hands, and the grim Sanhedrim
  glanced from one to another, half in uncertainty, half in pity, at what they
  beheld. The figure of a woman darting from the gloomy cloister, rushed across
  the court to fall in Esca's arms with a strange wild cry, not quite a shout
  of triumph, not quite a shriek of despair; and the Briton looking down upon
  Mariamne, folded her head to his breast, with a murmur of manly tenderness
  that even such a moment could not repress, while he shielded her with his
  body from the threatened missiles, in mingled gentleness and defiance, as a
  wild animal turned to bay protects its young.</p>

  <p>She passed her hands across his brow with a fond impulsive caress. With a
  woman's instinct, too, of care and compassion, she gently stroked his wrist
  where it had been chafed and galled by his bonds; then she smiled up in his
  face, a loving happy smile, and whispered. "My own, my dear one; they shall
  never part us. If I cannot save thee, I can die with thee; oh! so happy.
  Happier than I have ever been before in my life."</p>

  <p>It was a strange feeling for him to shrink from the beloved presence, to
  avoid the desired caress, to entreat his Mariamne to leave him; but though
  his first impulse had been to clasp her in his arms, his blood ran cold to
  think of the danger she was braving, the fate to which those tender limbs,
  that fair young delicate body, would too surely be exposed.</p>

  <p>"No, no," he said. "not so. You are too young, too beautiful to die.
  Mariamne, if you ever loved me&mdash;nay, <i>as</i> you love me, I charge you
  to leave me now."</p>

  <p>She looked at Calchas, whom she had not yet seemed to recognise, and there
  was a smile&mdash;yes! a smile on her face, while she stood forth between the
  prisoners, and fronted that whole assembly with dauntless forehead and brave
  flashing eyes; her fair slight figure the one centre of all observation, the
  one prominent object in the court.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she said, in clear sweet tones, that rang like music to the very
  farthest cloisters. "Listen all, and bear witness! Princes of the House of
  Judah, elders and nobles, and priests and Levites of the nation! ye cannot
  shrink from your duty, ye cannot put off your sacred character. I appeal to
  your own constitution and your own awful vow. Ye have sworn to obey the
  dictates of wisdom without favour; ye have sworn to fulfil the behests of
  justice without mercy. I charge ye to condemn me, Mariamne, the daughter of
  Eleazar Ben-Manahem, to be stoned with stones until I die; for that I too am
  one of those Nazarenes whom men call Christians. Yea, I triumph in their
  belief, as I glory in their name. Ye need no evidence, for I condemn myself
  out of my own mouth. Priests of my father's faith, here in its very Temple I
  deny your holiness, I abjure your worship, I renounce your creed! This
  building that overshadows me shall testify to my denunciations. It may be
  that this very day it shall fall in upon you and cover you with its ruins. If
  these have spoken blasphemy, so have I; if these are offenders worthy of
  death, so am I. I bear witness against you! I defy you! I bid you do your
  worst on those who are proud and happy to die for conscience' sake!"</p>

  <p>Her cheek glowed, her eye flashed, her very figure dilated as she shook
  her white hand aloft, and thus braved the assembled Sanhedrim with her
  defiance. It was strange how like Eleazar she was at that moment, while the
  rich old blood of Manahem mounted in her veins; and the courage of her
  fathers, that of yore had smitten the armed Philistine in the wilderness, and
  turned the fierce children of Moab in the very tide of conquest, now blazed
  forth at the moment of danger in the fairest and gentlest descendant of their
  line. Even her very tones thrilled to the heart of Calchas, not so much for
  her own sake, as for that of the brother whom he so loved, and whose voice he
  seemed to hear in hers. Esca gazed on her with a fond astonishment; and John
  of Gischala quailed where he stood, as he thought of his noble enemy, and the
  hereditary courage he had done more wisely not to have driven to despair.</p>

  <p>But the tension of her nerves was too much for her woman's strength.
  Bravely she hurled her challenge in their very teeth; and then, shaking in
  every limb, she leaned against the Briton's towering form, and hid her face
  once more on his breast.</p>

  <p>Even the Nasi was moved. Stern, rigid, and exacting, yet apart from his
  office he too had human affections and human weaknesses. He had mourned for
  more than one brave son, he had loved more than one dark-eyed daughter. He
  would have spared her if he could, and he bit his lip hard under the long
  white beard, in a vain effort to steady the quiver he could not control. He
  looked appealingly amongst his colleagues, and met many an eye that obviously
  sympathised with his tendency to mercy; but John of Gischala interposed, and
  cried out loudly for justice to be done without delay.</p>

  <p>"Ye have heard her!" he exclaimed, with an assumption of holy and zealous
  indignation; "out of her own mouth she is condemned. What need ye more proof
  or further deliberation? The doom has gone forth. I appeal to the Sanhedrim
  that justice be done, in the name of our faith, our nation, our Temple, and
  our Holy City, which such righteous acts as these may preserve even now from
  the desolation that is threatening at the very gate!"</p>

  <p>With such an assembly, such an appeal admitted of no refusal. The Seventy
  looked from one to another and shook their heads, sorrowfully indeed, but
  with knitted brows and grave stern faces that denoted no intention to spare.
  Already Phineas Ben-Ezra had given the accustomed signal; already the young
  men appointed as executioners had closed round the doomed three, with huge
  blunt missiles poised, and prepared to launch them forth, when another
  interruption arrived to delay for a while the cruel sacrifice that a Jewish
  Sanhedrim dignified with the title of justice.</p>

  <p>A voice that had been often heard before, though never so wild and
  piercing as at this moment, rang through the Court of the Gentiles, and
  seemed to wail among the very pinnacles of the Temple towering in the morning
  air above. It was -a voice that struck to the hearts of all who heard it such
  a voice as terrifies men in their dreams; chilling the blood, and making the
  flesh creep with a vague yet unendurable horror, so that when the pale
  sleeper wakes, he is drenched with the cold sweat of mortal fear. A voice
  that seemed at once to threaten and to warn, to pity and to condemn; a voice
  of which the moan and the burden were ever unbroken and the same&mdash;"Woe
  to Jerusalem! Woe to the Holy City! Sin, and sorrow, and desolation! Woe to
  the Holy City! Woe to Jerusalem!"</p>

  <p>Naked, save for a fold of camel's hair around his loins, his coarse black
  locks matted and tangled, and mingled with the uncombed beard that reached
  below his waist&mdash;his dark eyes gleaming with lurid fire, and his long
  lean arms tossing aloft with the wild gestures of insanity&mdash;a tall
  figure stalked into the middle of the court, and taking up its position
  before the Nasi of the Sanhedrim, began scattering around it on the floor the
  burning embers from a brazier it bore on its head; accompanying its actions
  with the same mournful and prophetic cry. The young men paused with their
  arms up in act to hurl; the Nasi stood motionless and astonished; the
  Sanhedrim seemed paralysed with fear; and the Prophet of Warning, if prophet
  indeed he were, proceeded with his chant of vengeance and denunciation
  against his countrymen.</p>

  <p>"Woe to Jerusalem!" said he once more. "Woe to the Holy City! A voice from
  the East, a voice from the West, a voice from the four winds; a voice against
  Jerusalem and the holy house; a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides;
  and a voice against the whole people!"</p>

  <p>Then he turned aside and walked round the prisoners in a circle, still
  casting burning ashes on the floor. Matthias, like his colleagues, was
  puzzled how to act. If this were a demoniac, he entertained for him a natural
  horror and aversion, enhanced by the belief he held, in common with his
  countrymen, that one possessed had the strength of a score of men in his
  single arm; but what if this should be a true prophet, inspired directly from
  heaven? The difficulty would then become far greater. To endeavour to
  suppress him might provoke divine vengeance on the spot; whereas, to suffer
  his denunciations to go abroad amongst the people as having prevailed with
  the Great Council of the nation, would be to abandon the inhabitants at once
  to despair, and to yield up all hope of offering a successful defence to the
  coming attack. From this dilemma the Nasi was released by the last person on
  whom he could have counted for assistance at such a time. Pointing to the
  prisoners with his wasted arm, the prophet demanded their instant release,
  threatening divine vengeance on the Sanhedrim if they refused; and then
  addressing the three with the same wild gestures and incoherent language, he
  bade them come forth from their bonds, and join him in his work of prophecy
  through the length and breadth of the city.</p>

  <p>"I have power to bind," he exclaimed, "and power to loose! I command you
  to rend your bonds asunder! I command you to come forth, and join me, the
  Prophet of Warning, in the cry that I am commissioned to cry aloud, without
  ceasing&mdash;'Woe to Jerusalem! Woe to the Holy City! Woe to
  Jerusalem!'"</p>

  <p>Then Calchas, stretching out his bound hands, rebuked him, calmly, mildly,
  solemnly, with the patience of a good and holy man&mdash;with the instinctive
  superiority of one who is standing on the verge of his open grave.</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou hinder God's work?" he said. "Wilt thou dare to suppress the
  testimony we are here to give in His presence to-day? See! even this young
  girl, weak indeed in body yet strong in faith, stands bold and unflinching at
  her post! And thou, O man! what art thou, that thou shouldst think to come
  between her and her glorious reward? Be still! be still! Be no more vexed by
  the unquiet spirit, but go in peace, or rather stay here in the Court of the
  Gentiles, and bear witness to the truth, for which we are so thankful and so
  proud to die!"</p>

  <p>The prophet's eye wandered dreamily from the speaker's face to those of
  the surrounding listeners. His features worked as though he strove against
  some force within that he was powerless to resist; then his whole frame
  collapsed, as it were, into a helpless apathy, and placing his brazier on the
  ground, he sat down beside it, rocking his body to and fro, while he moaned
  out, as it seemed unconsciously, in a low and wailing voice, the burden of
  his accustomed chant.</p>

  <p>To many in the assembly that scene was often present in their after lives.
  When they opened their eyes to the light of morning they saw its glow once
  more on the bewildered faces of the Sanhedrim; on the displeasure, mingled
  with wonder and admiration, that ruffled the austere brow of Matthias; on the
  downward scowl that betrayed how shame and fear were torturing John of
  Gischala; on the clear-cut figures of the young men he had marshalled, girded
  and ready for their cruel office; on Esca's towering frame, haughty and
  undaunted still; on Mariamne's drooping form, and pale patient face; above
  all, on the smile that illumined the countenance of Calchas, standing there
  in his bonds, so venerable, and meek, and happy, now turning to encourage his
  companions in affliction, now raising his eyes thankfully to heaven, his
  whole form irradiated the while by a flood of light, that seemed richer and
  more lustrous than the glow of the morning sun.</p>

  <p>But while the prophet, thus tranquilised and silenced by the rebuke he had
  provoked, sat muttering and brooding amongst his dying embers on the floor;
  while the Sanhedrim, with their Nasi, stood aghast; while John of Gischala
  gnawed his lip in impatient vindictive hatred; and the young men gathered
  closer round their victims, as the wolves gather in upon their
  prey,&mdash;Mariamne raised her head from Esca's breast, and, pushing the
  hair back from her ears and temples, stood for an instant erect and
  motionless, with every faculty absorbed in the one sense of listening. Then
  she turned her flashing eyes, lit up with great hope and triumph, yet not
  untinged by wistful mournful tenderness, upon the Briton's face, and sobbed
  in broken accents, between tears and laughter&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Saved! Saved! beloved. And by my hand, though lost to me!"</p>

  <p>Sharpened by intense affection, her ear alone had caught the distant note
  of the Roman trumpets sounding for the assault.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-17"
     id="ch3-17">XVII</a>. &mdash; THE FIRST STONE</h2>

  <p class="first">BUT the young men would hold their hands no longer.
  Impatient of delay, and encouraged by a sign from their leader, they rushed
  in upon the prisoners. Esca shielded Mariamne with his body. Calchas, pale
  and motionless, calmly awaited his fate. Gioras, the son of Simeon, a
  prominent warrior amongst the Sicarii, hurling on him a block of granite with
  merciless energy, struck the old man bleeding to the earth; but while the
  missile left his hands&mdash;while he yet stood erect and with extended arms,
  a Roman arrow quivered in the aggressor's heart. He fell upon his face stone
  dead at the very feet of his victim. That random shaft was but the first
  herald of the storm. In another moment a huge mass of rock, projected from a
  powerful catapult against the building, falling short of its mark, struck the
  prophet as he sat moaning on the ground, and crushed him a lifeless,
  shapeless mass beneath its weight. Then rose a cry of despair from the outer
  wall&mdash;a confused noise of strife and shouting, the peal of the trumpets,
  the cheer of the conquerors, the wild roar of defiance and despair from the
  besieged. Ere long fugitives were pouring through the court, seeking the
  shelter of the Temple itself. There was no time to complete the
  execution&mdash;no time to think of the prisoners. John of Gischala,
  summoning his adherents, and bidding the young men hasten for their armour,
  betook himself to his stronghold within the Sacred Place. The Sanhedrim fled
  in consternation, although Matthias and the braver of his colleagues died
  afterwards in the streets, as became them, under shield. In a few minutes the
  Court of the Gentiles was again clear, save for the prisoners, one of whom
  was bound, and one mangled and bleeding on the pavement, tended by Mariamne,
  who bent over her kinsman in speechless sorrow and consternation. The
  fragment of rock, too, which had been propelled against the Temple, lay in
  the centre, over the crushed and flattened body of the prophet, whose hand
  and arm alone protruded from beneath the mass. The place did not thus remain
  in solitude for long. Fighting their retreat step by step, and, although
  driven backward, contesting every yard with their faces to the enemy, the
  flower of the Jewish army soon passed through, in the best order they could
  maintain, as they retired upon the Temple. Among the last of these was
  Eleazar; hopeless now, for he knew all was lost, but brave and unconquered
  still. He cast one look of affection at his brother's prostrate form, one of
  astonishment and reproof on his kneeling child; but ere he could approach or
  even speak to her, he was swept on with the resistless tide of the defeated,
  ebbing before the advance of the Roman host.</p>

  <p>And now Esca's eye kindled, and his blood mounted, to a well-known battle-
  cry. He had heard it in the deadly circus; he had heard it on the crumbling
  breach; he had heard it wherever blows rained hard and blood flowed free, and
  men fought doggedly and hopelessly, without a chance or a wish for escape.
  His heart leaped to the cheer of the gladiators, rising fierce, reckless, and
  defiant above all the combined din of war, and he knew that his old comrades
  and late antagonists had carried the defences with their wonted bravery, as
  they led the Roman army to the assault</p>

  <p>The Legion of the Lost had indeed borne themselves nobly on this occasion.
  Their leader had not spared them; for Hippias well knew that to-day, with the
  handful left him by slaughter and disease, he must play his last stake for
  riches and distinction; nor had his followers failed to answer gallantly to
  his call. Though opposed by Eleazar himself and the best he could muster,
  they had carried the breach at the first onset&mdash;they had driven the Jews
  before them with a wild headlong charge that no courage could resist, and
  they had entered the outskirts of the Temple almost at the same moment with
  its discomfited defenders. It was their trumpets sounding the advance that
  reached Mariamne's ear as she stood in the Court of the Gentiles, awaiting
  the vengeance she had defied. And amongst this courageous band two combatants
  had especially signalised themselves by feats of reckless and unusual daring.
  The one was old Hirpinus, who felt thoroughly in his element in such a scene,
  and whose natural valour was enhanced by the consciousness of the superiority
  he had now attained as a soldier over his former profession of a gladiator.
  The other was a comrade whom none could identify; who was conspicuous no less
  from his flowing locks, his beautiful form, and his golden armour, than from
  the audacity with which he courted danger, and the immunity he seemed to
  enjoy, in common with those who display a real contempt for death.</p>

  <p>As he followed the golden headpiece and the long brown hair, that made way
  so irresistibly through the press, more than one stout swordsman exulted in
  the belief that some tutelary deity of his country had descended in human
  shape to aid the Roman arms; and Titus himself inquired, and waited in vain
  for an answer, "Who was that dashing warrior, with white arms and shining
  corselet, leading the gladiators so gallantly to the attack?"</p>

  <p>But old Hirpinus knew, and smiled within his helmet as he fought. "The
  captain is well rid of her," thought he, congratulating himself the while on
  his own freedom from such inconveniences. "For all her comely face and
  winning laugh, I had rather have a tigress loose in my tent than this fair,
  fickle, fighting fury, who takes to shield and spear as other women do to the
  shuttle and the distaff!"</p>

  <p>Valeria, in truth, deserved little credit for her bravery. While
  apprehension of danger never for a moment over-mastered her, the excitement
  of its presence seemed to offer a temporary relief to her wounded and
  remorseful heart. In the fierce rush of battle she had no leisure to dwell on
  thoughts that had lately tortured her to madness; and the very physical
  exertion such a scene demanded, brought with it, although she was unconscious
  of its severity, a sure anodyne for mental suffering. Like all persons, too,
  who are unaccustomed to bodily perils, the impunity with which she affronted
  each imparted an overweening confidence in her good fortune, and an undue
  contempt for the next, till it seemed to herself that she bore a charmed
  life; and that, though man after man might fall at her side as she fought on,
  <i>she</i> was destined to fulfil her task unscathed, and reach the presence
  of Esca in time to save him from destruction, even though she should die the
  next minute at his feet.</p>

  <p>The two first assailants who entered the Court of the Gentiles were
  Valeria, in her golden armour, and Hirpinus, brandishing the short deadly
  weapon he knew how to use so well. They were close together; but the former
  paused to look around, and the gladiator, rushing to the front, made for his
  old comrade, whom he recognised on the instant. His haste, however, nearly
  proved fatal. The heavily-nailed sandals that he wore afforded but a
  treacherous foothold on the smooth stone pavement, his feet slipped from
  under him, and he came with a heavy back-fall to the ground. <i>Habet!</i>*
  exclaimed Hippias, from the sheer force of custom, following close upon his
  tracks; but he strained eagerly forward to defend his prostrate comrade while
  he spoke, and found himself instantly engaged with a score of Jewish
  warriors, who came swarming back like bees to settle on the fallen gladiator.
  Hirpinus, however, covered his body skilfully under his shield, and defended
  himself bravely with his sword&mdash;dealing more than one fatal thrust at
  such of his assailants as were rash enough to believe him vanquished because
  down. As more of the gladiators came pouring in, they were opposed by troops
  of the Jews, who, with Eleazar at their head, made a desperate sally from the
  Temple to which they had retired, and a fierce hand-to-hand struggle, that
  lasted several minutes, took place round Hirpinus in the centre of the court.
  When he at length regained his feet, his powerful aid soon made itself felt
  in the fray, and the Jews, though righting stubbornly still, were obliged
  once more to retreat before the increasing columns of the besiegers.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Habet!</i>&mdash;the exclamation with which the
  spectators notified a conclusive thrust or blow in the circus. ]</p>

  <p>Valeria, in the meantime, rushing through the court to where she spied a
  well-known form struggling in its bonds, came across the path of Eleazar, at
  whom she delivered a savage thrust as she met him, lest he should impede her
  course. The fierce Jew, who had enough on his hands at such a moment, and was
  pressing eagerly forward into the thickest of the struggle, was content to
  parry the stroke with his javelin, and launch that weapon in return at his
  assailant, while he passed on. The cruel missile did its errand only too
  well. The broad thirsty point clove through a crevice in her golden corselet,
  and sank deep in her white tender side, to drink the life-blood of the woman-
  warrior as she sped onward in fulfilment of her fatal task. Breaking the
  javelin's shaft in her hands, and flinging the fragments from her with a
  scornful smile, Valeria found strength to cross the court, nor did her swift
  step falter, nor did her proud bearing betray wounds or weakness, till she
  reached Esca's side. A loving smile of recognition, two strokes of her sharp
  blade, and he was free! but as the severed bonds fell from his arms, and he
  stretched them forth in the delight of restored liberty, his deliverer,
  throwing away sword and shield, seized his hand in both her own, and,
  pressing it convulsively to her bosom, sank down helpless on the pavement at
  his feet.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3-18"
     id="ch3-18">XVIII</a>. &mdash; THE COST OF CONQUEST</h2>

  <p class="first">MARIAMNE turned from the still insensible form of Calchasto
  the beautiful face, that even now, though pale from exhaustion and warped
  with agony, it pained her to see so fair. Gently and tenderly she lifted the
  golden helmet from Valeria's brows; gently and tenderly she smoothed the rich
  brown hair, and wiped away the dews of coming death. Compassion, gratitude,
  and an ardent desire to soothe and tend the sufferer left no room for
  bitterness or unworthy feeling in Mariamne's breast. Valeria had redeemed her
  promise with her life&mdash;had ransomed the man whom they both loved so
  dearly, at that fatal price, for <i>her</i>! and the Jewess could only think
  of all she owed the Roman lady in return; could only strive to tend and
  comfort her, and minister to her wants, and support her in the awful moment
  she did not fail to see was fast approaching. The dying woman's face was
  turned on her with a sweet sad smile; but when Mariamne's touch softly
  approached the head of her father's javelin, still protruding from the wound,
  Valeria stayed her hand.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she whispered with a noble effort that steadied voice and lips,
  and kept down mortal agony; "not yet; for I know too well I am stricken to
  the death. While the steel is there it serves to stanch the life-blood. When
  I draw it out, then scatter a handful of dust over my forehead, and lay the
  death-penny on my tongue. I would fain last a few moments longer, Esca, were
  it but to look on thy dear face! Raise me, both of you. I have somewhat to
  say, and my time is short."</p>

  <p>The Briton propped her in his strong arms, and she leaned her head against
  his shoulder with a gesture of contentment and relief. The winning eyes had
  lost none of their witchery yet, though soon to be closed in death. Perhaps
  they never shone with so soft and sweet a lustre as now, while they looked
  upon the object of a wild, foolish, and impossible love. While one white hand
  was laid upon the javelin's head, and held it in its place, the other
  wandered over Esca's features in a fond caress, to be wetted with his tears.
  Her voice was failing, her strength was ebbing fast, but the brave spirit of
  the Mutian line held out, tameless and unshaken still.</p>

  <p>"I have conquered," gasped the Roman lady, in broken accents and with
  quick-coming breath. "I have conquered, though at the cost of life. What
  then? Victory can never be bought too dear. Esca, I swore to rescue thee. I
  swore thou shouldst be mine. Now have I kept my oath. I have bought thee with
  my blood, and I give thee&mdash;<i>give</i> thee, my own, to this brave girl,
  who risked her life to save thee too, and who loves thee well; but not so
  well, not half so well, as I have done. Esca, my noble one, come closer,
  closer yet." She drew his face down nearer and nearer to her own while she
  guided his hand to the javelin's head, still fast in her side. "I can bear
  this agony no longer," she gasped. "but it is not hard to die in thine arms,
  and by thy dear hand!"</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, she closed his grasp within her own, round the steel, and
  drew it gently from the wound. The blood welled up in dark-red jets to pour
  forth, as it cleared its channel, in one continuous stream that soon drained
  life away. With a quiver of her dainty limbs, with a smile deepening in her
  fair face, with her fond eyes fixed on the man she loved, and her lips
  pressed against his hand, the spirit of that beautiful, imperious, and wilful
  woman passed away into eternity.</p>

  <p>Blinded by their tears, neither Esca nor Mariamne were, for the moment,
  conscious of aught but the sad fate of her who had twice saved the one from
  death, and to whom the other had so lately appealed as the only source of aid
  in her great need. Dearly as he loved the living woman by his side, the
  Briton could not refrain from a burst of bitter sorrow while he looked on the
  noble form of Valeria lying dead at his feet; and Mariamne forgot her own
  griefs, her own injuries, in holy pity for her who had sacrificed virtue,
  happiness, wealth, life itself in his behalf, whom she, too, loved more
  dearly than it behoves human weakness to love anything this side the
  grave.</p>

  <p>But the living now claimed that attention which it availed no longer to
  bestow upon the dead. Calchas, though sadly bruised and mangled, began to
  show signs of restored life. The stone that stretched him on the pavement
  had, indeed, dealt a fatal injury; but though it stunned him for a time, had
  failed to inflict instantaneous death. The colour was now returning to his
  cheek, his breath came in long deep sighs, and he raised his hand to his head
  with a gesture of renewed consciousness, denoted by a sense of pain. Esca,
  careless and almost unaware of the conflict raging around, bent sorrowfully
  over his old friend, and devoted all his faculties to the task of aiding
  Mariamne in her efforts to alleviate his sufferings.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the tide of battle surged to and fro, with increasing
  volume and unmitigated fury. The Legion of the Lost, flushed with success,
  and secure of support from the whole Roman army in their rear, pressed the
  Jews, with the exulting and unremitting energy of the hunter closing in on
  his prey. These, like the wild beasts driven to the toils, turned to bay with
  the dreadful courage of despair. Led by Eleazar, who was ever present where
  most needed, they made repeated sallies from the body of the Temple,
  endeavouring to regain the ground they had lost, at least as far as the
  entrance to the Court of the Gentiles. This became, therefore, an arena in
  which many a mortal combat was fought out hand to hand, and was several times
  taken and retaken with alternate success.</p>

  <p>Hippias, according to his wont, was conspicuous in the fray. It was his
  ambition to lead his gladiators into the Holy Place itself, before Titus
  should come up, and with such an object he seemed to outdo to-day the daring
  feats of valour for which he had previously been celebrated. Hirpinus, who
  had no sooner regained his feet than he went to work again as though, like
  the fabled Titan, he derived renewed energy from the kisses of mother Earth,
  expostulated more than once with his leader on the dangers he affronted, and
  the numerical odds he did not hesitate to engage, but received to each
  warning the same reply. Pointing with dripping sword at the golden roof of
  the Temple flashing conspicuously over their heads. "Yonder," said the
  fencing-master, "is the ransom of a kingdom. I will win it with my own hand
  for the legion, and share it amongst you equally, man by man." Such a
  prospect inspired the gladiators with even more than their usual daring; and
  though many a stout swordsman went down with his face to the enemy, and many
  a bold eye looked its last on the coveted spoil, ere it grew dark for ever,
  the survivors did but close in the fiercer, to fight on, step by step, and
  stroke by stroke, till the court was strewed with corpses, and its pavement
  slippery with blood.</p>

  <p>During a pause in the reeling strife, and while marshalling his men, who
  had again driven the Jews into the Temple, for a fresh and decisive attack,
  Hippias found himself in that corner of the court where Esca and Mariamne
  were still bending over the prostrate form of Calchas. Without a symptom of
  astonishment or jealousy, but with his careless half-contemptuous laugh, the
  fencing-master recognised his former pupil, and the girl whom he had once
  before seen in the porch of the tribune's mansion at Rome. Taking off his
  heavy helmet, he wiped his brows, and leaned for a space on his shield.</p>

  <p>"Go to the rear," said he. "and take the lass with thee, man, since she
  seems to hang like a clog round thy neck, wherever there is fighting to be
  done. Give yourselves up to the Tenth Legion, and tell Licinius, who commands
  it, you are my prisoners. 'Tis your only chance of safety, my pretty damsel,
  and none of your sex ever yet had cause to rue her trust in Hippias. You may
  tell him also, Esca, that if he make not the more haste, I shall have taken
  the Temple, and all belonging to it, without his help. Off with thee, lad!
  this is no place for a woman. Get her out of it as quick as thou canst."</p>

  <p>But the Briton pointed downward to Calchas, who had again become
  unconscious, and whose head was resting on Mariamne's knees. His gesture drew
  the attention of Hippias to the ground, cumbered as it was with slain. He had
  begun with a brutal laugh to bid his pupil " leave the carrion for the
  vultures," but the sentence died out on his lips, which turned deadly white,
  while his eyes stared vacantly, and the shield on which he had been leaning
  fell with a clang to the stones.</p>

  <p>There at his very feet over the golden breastplate was the dead face of
  Valeria; and the heart of the brave, reckless, and unprincipled soldier smote
  him with a cruel pang, for something told him that his own wilful pride and
  selfishness had begun that work, which was completed, to his eternal self-
  reproach, down there.</p>

  <p>He never thought he loved her so dearly. He recalled, as if it were but
  yesterday, the first time he ever saw her, beautiful and sumptuous and
  haughty, looking down from her cushioned chair by the equestrian row, with
  the well-known scornful glance that possessed for him so keen a charm. He
  remembered how it kindled into approval as it met his own, and how his heart
  thrilled under his buckler, though he stood face to face with a mortal foe.
  He remembered how fondly he clung to that mutual glance of recognition, the
  only link between them, renewed more frankly and more kindly at every
  succeeding show, till, raising his eyes to meet it once too often in the
  critical moment of encounter, he went down badly wounded under the blow he
  had thus failed to guard. Nevertheless, how richly was he rewarded when
  fighting stubbornly on his knee, and from that disadvantageous attitude
  vanquishing his antagonist at last, he distinguished amidst the cheers of
  thousands her marked and musical <i>Euge!</i> syllabled so clearly though so
  softly, for his special ear, by the lips of the proud lady, whom from that
  moment he dared to love! Afterwards, when admitted periodically to her house,
  how delightful were the alternations of hope and fear with which he saw
  himself treated; now as an honoured guest, now as a mere inferior, at another
  time with mingled kindness and restraint, that, impassible as he thought
  himself, woke such wild wishes in his heart! How sweet it was to be sure of
  seeing her at certain stated hours, the recollection of one meeting bridging
  over the intervening period so pleasantly, till it was time to look forward
  to another! She was to him like the beautiful rose blooming in his garden, of
  which a man is content at first only to admire the form ere he learns to long
  for its fragrance, and at last desires to pluck it ruthlessly from the stem
  that he may wear it on his breast. How soon it withers there and dies, and
  then how bitterly, how sadly, he wishes he had left it blushing where it
  grew! There are plenty more flowers in the garden, but none of them are quite
  equal to the rose.</p>

  <p>It was strange how little Hippias dwelt on the immediate past&mdash;how it
  was the Valeria of Rome, not the Valeria of Judaea, for whom his heart was
  aching now. He scarcely reverted even to the delirious happiness of the first
  few days when she accompanied him to the East; he did not dwell on his own
  mad joy, nor the foolish triumph that lasted so short a time. He forgot, as
  though they had never been, her caprice, her wilfulness, her growing
  weariness of his society, and the scorn she scarcely took the trouble to
  conceal. It was all past and gone now, that constraint and repugnance in the
  tent, that impatience of each other's presence, those angry recriminations,
  those heartless biting taunts and the final rupture that could never be
  pardoned nor atoned for now. She was again Valeria of the olden time, of the
  haughty bearing, and the winning eyes, and the fresh glad voice that sprang
  from a heart which had never known a struggle nor a fall&mdash;the Valeria
  whose every mood and gesture were gifted with a dangerous witchery, a subtle
  essence that seems to pervade the very presence of such women&mdash;a
  priceless charm, indeed, and yet a fatal,, luring the possessor to the
  destruction of others and her own.</p>

  <p>Oh, that she could but speak to him once more! Only once, though it were
  in words of keen reproach or bitter scorn! It seemed like a dream that he
  should never hear her voice again; and yet his senses vouched that it was
  waking cold reality, for was she not lying there before him, surrounded by
  the slain of his devoted legion? The foremost, the fairest, and the earliest
  lost, amongst them all!</p>

  <p>He took no further note of Calchas nor of Esca. He turned not to mark the
  renewed charge of his comrades, nor the increased turmoil of the fight, but
  he stooped down over the body of the dead woman, and laid his lips reverently
  to her pale cold brow. Then he lifted one of her long brown tresses, dabbled
  as they were in blood, to sever it gently and carefully with his sword, and
  unbuckling his corselet, hid it beneath the steel upon his heart. After this,
  he turned and took leave of Esca. The Briton scarcely knew him, his voice and
  mien were so altered. But watching his figure as he disappeared, waving his
  sword, amidst the press of battle, he knew instinctively that he had bidden
  Hippias the gladiator a long and last farewell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-19"
     id="ch3-19">XIX</a>. &mdash; THE GATHERING OF THE EAGLES</h2>

  <p class="first">SHOUTING their well-known war-cry, and placing himself at
  the head of that handful of heroes who constituted the remnant of the Lost
  Legion, Hippias rallied them for one last desperate effort against the
  defenders of the Temple. These had formed a hasty barricade on the exigency
  of the moment from certain beams and timbers they had pulled down in the
  Sacred Place. It afforded a slight protection against the javelins, arrows,
  and other missiles of the Romans, while it checked and repulsed the impetuous
  rush of the latter, who now wavered, hesitated, and began to look about them,
  making inquiry for the battering-rams and other engines of war that were to
  have supported their onset from the rear. In vain Hippias led them, once and
  again, to carry this unforeseen obstacle. It was high and firm, it bristled
  with spears and was lined with archers; above all, it was defended by the
  indomitable valour of Eleazar, and the gladiators were each time repulsed
  with loss. Their leader, too, had been severely wounded. He had never lifted
  his shield from the ground where it lay by Valeria's side; and, in climbing
  the barricade, he had received a thrust in the body from an unknown hand.
  While he stanched the blood with the folds of his tunic, and felt within his
  breastplate for the tress of Valeria's hair, he looked anxiously back for his
  promised reinforcements, now sorely needed, convinced that his shattered band
  would be unable to obtain possession of the Temple without the assistance of
  the legions. Faint from loss of blood, strength and courage failing him at
  the same moment, an overpowering sense of hopeless sorrow succeeding the
  triumphant excitement of the last hour, his thoughts were yet for his
  swordsmen; and collecting them with voice and gesture, he bade them form with
  their shields the figure that was called "the tortoise," as a screen against
  the shower of missiles that overpowered them from the barricade. Cool,
  confident, and well-drilled, the gladiators soon settled into this impervious
  order of defence; and the word of command had hardly died on his lips ere the
  leader himself was the only soldier left out of that movable fortress of
  steel.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* In bringing forward their heavy battering-rams, or
  otherwise advancing to the attack of a fortified place, the Roman soldiers
  were instructed to raise their shields obliquely above their heads, and,
  linking them together, thus form an impervious roof of steel, under which
  they could manoeuvre with sufficient freedom. This formation was called the
  <i>testudo</i>, or tortoise, from its supposed resemblance to the defensive
  covering with which nature provides that animal. ]</p>

  <p>Turning from the enemy to inspect its security, his side was left a moment
  exposed to their darts. The next, a Jewish arrow quivered in his heart. True
  to his instincts, he waved his sword over his head, as he went down, with a
  triumphant cheer; for his failing ear recognised the blast of the Roman
  trumpets&mdash;his darkening eye caught the glitter of their spears and the
  gleam of their brazen helmets, as the legions advanced in steady and imposing
  order to complete the work he and his handful of heroes had begun.</p>

  <p>Even in the act of falling, Esca, looking up from his charge, saw the
  fencing-master wheel half-round that his dead face might be turned towards
  the foe; perhaps, too, the Briton's eye was the only one to observe a thin
  dark stream of blood steal slowly along the pavement, till it mingled with
  the red pool in which Valeria lay.</p>

  <p>Effectual assistance had come at last. From the Tower of Antonia to the
  outworks of the Temple a broad and easy causeway had been thrown up in the
  last hour by the Roman soldiers. Where every man was engineer as well as
  combatant, there was no lack of labour for such a task. A large portion of
  the adjoining wall, as of the tower itself, had been nastily thrown down to
  furnish materials; and while the gladiators were storming the Court of the
  Gentiles, their comrades had constructed a wide, easy, and gradual ascent, by
  which, in regular succession, whole columns could be poured in to the support
  of the first assailants. These were led by Julius Placidus with his wonted
  skill and coolness. In his recent collision with Esca he had sustained such
  severe injuries as incapacitated him from mounting a horse; but with the
  Asiatic auxiliaries were several elephants of war, and on one of these huge
  beasts he now rode exalted, directing from his movable tower the operations
  of his own troops, and galling the enemy when occasion offered' with the
  shafts of a few archers who accompanied him on the patient and sagacious
  animal.</p>

  <p>The elephant, in obedience to its driver, a dark supple Syrian, perched
  behind its ears, ascended the slope with ludicrous and solemn caution. Though
  alarmed by the smell of blood, it nevertheless came steadily on, a formidable
  and imposing object, striking terror into the hearts of the Jews, who were
  not accustomed to confront such enemies in warfare. The tribune's arms were
  more dazzling, his dress even more costly than usual. It seemed that with his
  Eastern charger he affected also something of Eastern luxury and splendour;
  but he encouraged his men, as he was in the habit of doing, with jeer and
  scoff, and such coarse jests as soldiers best understand and appreciate in
  the moment of danger.</p>

  <p>No sooner had he entered the court, through its battered and half-
  demolished gateway, than his quick eye caught sight of the still glowing
  embers scattered by the Prophet of Warning on the pavement. These suggested a
  means for the destruction of the barricade, and he mocked the repulsed
  gladiators, with many a bitter taunt, for not having yet applied them to that
  purpose. Calling on Hirpinus, who now commanded the remnant of the Lost
  Legion, to collect his followers, he bade them advance under the
  <i>testudo</i> to pile these embers against the foundations of the wooden
  barrier.</p>

  <p>"The defenders cannot find a drop of water," said he, laughing; "they have
  no means of stifling a fire kindled from without. In five minutes all that
  dry wood will be in a blaze, and in less than ten there will be a smoking gap
  in the gateway large enough for me to ride through, elephant and all!"</p>

  <p>Assisted by fresh reinforcements, the gladiators promptly obeyed his
  orders. Heaps of live embers were collected and applied to the wooden
  obstacle so hastily erected. Dried to tinder in the scorching sun, and
  loosely put together for a temporary purpose, it could not fail to be
  sufficiently inflammable; and the hearts of the besieged sank within them as
  the flame began to leap and the woodwork to crackle, while their last
  defences seemed about to consume gradually away.</p>

  <p>The tribune had time to lean over from his elephant and question Hirpinus
  of his commander. With a grave sad brow and a heavy heart, the stout old
  swordsman answered by pointing to the ground where Hippias lay, his face calm
  and fixed, his right hand closed firmly round his sword.</p>

  <p><i>"Habet!"</i> exclaimed the tribune with a brutal laugh; adding to
  himself, as Hirpinus turned away sorrowful and disgusted. "My last rival
  down; my last obstacle removed. One more throw for the Sixes, and the great
  game is fairly won!"</p>

  <p>Placidus was indeed now within a stride of all he most coveted, all he
  most wished to grasp on earth. A dozen feet below him, pale and rigid on the
  ground, lay the rival he had feared might win the first place in the triumph
  of to-day; the rival whom he knew to possess the favour of Titus; the rival
  who had supplanted him in the good graces of the woman he loved. He had
  neither forgotten nor forgiven Valeria; but he bore none the less ill-will
  against him with whom she had voluntarily fled. When he joined the Roman army
  before Jerusalem, and found her beautiful, miserable, degraded, in the tent
  of the gladiator, he had but dissembled and deferred his revenge till the
  occasion should arrive when he might still more deeply humiliate the one and
  inflict a fatal blow on the other. Now the man was under his elephant's feet;
  and the woman left alone yonder, friendless and deserted in the camp, could
  not, he thought, fail eventually to become his prey. He little knew that
  those who had made each other's misery in life were at last united in the
  cold embrace of death. He had arrived, too, in the nick of time, to seize and
  place on his own brows the wreath that had been twined for him by the Lost
  Legion and their leader. A little earlier and Hippias, supplied by himself
  with fresh troops, would have won the credit of first entering the Temple; a
  little later, and his triumph must have been shared by Licinius, already with
  the Tenth Legion close upon his rear. But now, at the glorious opportunity,
  there was nothing between him and victory save a score of Jewish spearmen and
  a few feet of blazing wood.</p>

  <p>Leaning over to the unwilling driver, he urged him to goad the elephant
  through the flames, that its weight might at once bear down what remained of
  the barricade and make a way for his followers into the Temple. Ambition
  prompted him not to lose a moment. The Syrian unwound the shawl from his
  waist, and spread it over the animal's eyes, while he persuaded it, thus
  blindfolded, to advance. Though much alarmed, the elephant pushed on, and
  there was small hope that the shattered smouldering barrier would resist the
  pressure of its enormous weight. The last chance of the besieged seemed to
  fail them, when Eleazar leaped out through the smoke, and, running swiftly to
  meet it, dashed under the beast's uplifted trunk, and stabbed it fiercely
  with quick repeated thrusts in the belly. At each fresh stroke the elephant
  uttered a loud and hideous groan, a shriek of pain and fear, mingled with a
  trumpet-note of fury, and then sinking on its knees, fell slowly and heavily
  to the ground, crushing the devoted Zealot beneath its huge carcass, and
  scattering the band of archers, as a man scatters a handful of grain, over
  the court</p>

  <p>Eleazar never spoke again. The Lion of Judah died as he had
  lived&mdash;fierce, stubborn, unconquered, and devoted to the cause of
  Jerusalem. Mariamne recognised him as he sallied forth, but no mutual glance
  had passed between the father and the child. Pale, erect, motionless, she
  watched him disappear under the elephant, but the scream of horror that rang
  from her white lips when she realised his fate was lost in the wild cry of
  pain, and anger, and dismay, that filled the air, while the huge quivering
  mass tottered and went down. Placidus was hurled to the pavement like a stone
  from a sling. Lying there, helpless, though conscious, he recognised at once
  the living Esca and the dead Valeria; but baffled wrath and cherished hatred
  left no room in his heart for sorrow or remorse. His eye glared angrily on
  the Briton, and he ground his teeth with rage to feel that he could not even
  lift his powerless hand from the ground; but the Jewish warriors were closing
  in with fierce arms up to strike, and it was but a momentary glimpse that
  Esca obtained of the tribune's dark, despairing, handsome face. It was years,
  though, ere he forgot the vision. The costly robes, the goodly armour, the
  shapely writhing form, and the wild hopeless eyes that gleamed with hatred
  and defiance both of the world he left and that to which he went.</p>

  <p>And now the court was filling fast with a dun lurid smoke that wreathed
  its vapours round the pinnacles of the Temple, and caused the still
  increasing troops of combatants to loom like phantom shapes struggling and
  fighting in a dream. Ere long, bright tongues of flame were leaping through
  the cloud, licking the walls and pillars of the building, gliding and
  glancing over the golden surface of its roof, and shooting upwards here and
  there into shifting pyramids of fire. Soon was heard the hollow rushing roar
  with which the consuming element declares its victory, and showers of sparks,
  sweeping like storms across the Court of the Gentiles, proclaimed that the
  Temple was burning in every quarter.</p>

  <p>One of the gladiators, in the wild wantonness of strife, had caught a
  blazing fragment of the barricade, as its remains were carried by a rush of
  his comrades, after the fall of Eleazar, and flung it into an open window of
  the Temple over his head. Lighting on the carved woodwork, with which the
  casement was decorated, it soon kindled into a strong and steady flame, that
  was fed by the quantity of timber, all thoroughly dry and highly ornamented,
  which the building contained; thus it had communicated from gallery to
  gallery, and from storey to storey, till the whole was wrapped in one glowing
  sheet of fire. From every quarter of the city, from Agrippa's wall to the
  Mount of Olives, from the camp of the Assyrians to the Valley of Hinnom,
  awestruck faces of friend and foe, white with fear, or anger, or
  astonishment, marked that rolling column, expanding, swaying, shifting, and
  ever rising higher into the summer sky, ever flinging out its red forked
  banner of destruction broader, and brighter, and fiercer, with each changing
  breeze.</p>

  <p>Then the Jews knew that their great tribulation was fulfilled&mdash;that
  the curse which had been to them hitherto but a dead letter and a sealed
  book, was poured forth literally in streams of fire upon their
  heads&mdash;that their sanctuary was desolate, their prosperity gone for
  ever, their very existence as a nation destroyed, and "the place that had
  known them should know them no more"! The very Romans themselves, the cohorts
  advancing in serried columns to support their comrades, the legions massed in
  solid squares for the completion of its capture, in all the open places of
  the town, gazed on the burning Temple with concern and awe. Titus, even, in
  the flush of conquest, and the exulting joy of gratified ambition, turned his
  head away with a pitying sigh, for he would have spared the enemy had they
  but trusted him, would fain have saved that monument of their nationality and
  their religion, as well for their glory as his own.</p>

  <p>And now with the flames leaping, and the smoke curling around, the huge
  timbers crashing down on every side to throw up showers of sparkling embers
  as they fell&mdash;&mdash;the very marble glowing and riven with heat the
  precious metal pouring from the roof in streams of molten fire&mdash;Esca and
  Mariamne, half suffocated in the Court of the Gentiles, could not yet bring
  themselves to seek their own safety, and leave the helpless form of Calchas
  to certain destruction. Loud shouts, cries of agony and despair, warned them
  that even the burning Temple, at furnace heat, was still the theatre of a
  murderous and useless conflict The defenders had set the example of merciless
  bloodshed, and the Romans, exasperated to cruelty, now took no prisoners and
  gave no quarter. John of Gischala and his followers, driven to bay by the
  legions, still kept up a resistance the more furious that it was the
  offspring of despair. Hunted from wall to wall, from roof to roof, from
  storey to storey, they yet fought on while life and strength remained. Even
  those whose weapons failed them, or who were hemmed in by overwhelming
  numbers, leaped down like madmen, and perished horribly in the flames.</p>

  <p>But although steel was clashing, and blood flowing, and men righting by
  myriads around it, the Court of the Gentiles lay silent and deserted under
  its canopy of smoke, with its pavement covered by the dead. The only living
  creatures left were the three who had stood there in the morning, bound and
  doomed to die. Of these, one had his foot already on the border-land between
  time and eternity.</p>

  <p>"I will never desert him," said Esca to his pale companion; "but thou,
  Mariamne, hast now a chance of escape. It may be the Romans will respect thee
  if thou canst reach some high commander, or yield thee to some cohort of the
  reserve, whose blood is not a-fire with slaughter. What said Hippias of the
  Tenth Legion and Licinius? If thou couldst but lay hold on his garment, thou
  wert safe for my sake!"</p>

  <p>"And leave thee here to die!" answered Mariamne. "Oh, Esca! what would
  life be then? Besides, have we not trusted through this terrible night, and
  shall we not trust still? I know who is on my side. I have not forgotten all
  he taught me who lies bruised and senseless here. See, Esca! He opens his
  eyes. He knows us! It may be we shall save him now!"</p>

  <p>Calchas did indeed seem to have recovered consciousness; and the life so
  soon to fade glowed once more on his wasted cheek, like an expiring lamp that
  glimmers into momentary brightness ere its flame is extinguished for
  ever.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-20"
     id="ch3-20">XX</a>. &mdash; THE VICTORY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Tenth Legion, commanded by Licinius and guarding the
  person of their beloved prince, were advancing steadily upon the Temple.
  Deeming themselves the flower of the Roman army, accustomed to fight under
  the eye of Titus himself, there was no unseemly haste in the movements of
  these highly disciplined troops. None even of that fiery dash, which is
  sometimes so irresistible, sometimes so dangerous a quality in the soldier.
  The Tenth Legion would no more have neglected the even regularity of their
  line, the mechanical precision of their step, in a charge than in a retreat.
  They were, as they boasted, "equal to either fortune."* Not flushed by
  success, because they considered victory the mere wages to which they were
  entitled&mdash;not discouraged by repulse, because they were satisfied that
  the Tenth Legion could do all that was possible for soldiers; and the very
  fact of their retiring, was to them in itself a sufficient proof that sound
  strategy required such a movement.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* "Utrinque parati." ]</p>

  <p>Thus, when the Legion of the Lost dashed forward with wild cheers and an
  impetuous rush to the attack, the Tenth supported them with even ranks and
  regular pace and a scornful smile on their keen, bronzed, quiet faces. They
  would have taken the Temple, they thought, if they had the order, with half
  the noise and in half the time, so they closed remorselessly in, as man after
  man 'fell under the Jewish missiles, and preserved through their whole
  advance the same stern, haughty, and immovable demeanour, which was the
  favourite affectation of their courage. Titus had addressed them, when he put
  himself at their head, to recommend neither steadiness, valour, nor implicit
  compliance with orders, for in all such requirements he could depend on them,
  as if they were really what he loved to call them, "his own children"! but he
  exhorted them to spare the lives of the vanquished, and to respect as far as
  possible the property as well as the persons of the citizens. Above all, he
  had hoped to save the Temple; and this hope he expressed again and again to
  Licinius, who rode beside him, even until gazing sorrowfully on the mass of
  lowering smoke and yellow flame, his own eyes told him that his clemency was
  too late.</p>

  <p>Even then, leaving to his general the duty of completing its capture and
  investing its defences, he put spurs to his horse and rode at speed round the
  building, calling on his soldiers to assist him in quenching the flames,
  shouting, signing, gesticulating; but all in vain.* Though the Tenth Legion
  were steady as a rock, the rest of the army had not resisted the infection of
  success; and stimulated by the example of the gladiators, were more disposed
  to encourage than to impede the conflagration&mdash;nor, even had they
  wished, would their most strenuous efforts have been now able to extinguish
  it.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Then did Caesar, both by calling to the soldiers that
  were fighting, with a loud voice, and by giving a signal to them with his
  right hand, order them to quench the fire; but they did not hear what he
  said, though he spake so loud, having their ears already dinned by a greater
  noise another way; nor did they attend to the signal he made with his hand
  neither, as still some of them were distracted with passion, and others with
  fighting, neither any threatenings nor any persuasions could restrain their
  violence, but each one's own passion was his commander at this time; and as
  they were crowding into the Temple together many of them were trampled on by
  one another, while a great number fell among the ruins of the cloisters,
  which were still hot and smoking, and were destroyed in the same miserable
  way with those whom they had conquered. Josephus, <i>Wars of the Jews</i>,
  Book VI.  4. ]</p>

  <p>Though fighting still went on amongst the cloisters and in the galleries
  of the Temple; though John of Gischala was still alive, and the Robbers held
  out, here and there, in fast diminishing clusters; though the Zealots had
  sworn to follow their leader's example, dying to a man in defence of the Holy
  Place; and though the Sicarii were not yet completely
  exterminated&mdash;Jerusalem might nevertheless be considered at length in
  possession of the Roman army. Licinius, leading the Tenth Legion through the
  Court of the Gentiles, more effectually to occupy the Temple, and prevent if
  possible its total destruction, was accosted at its entrance by Hirpinus, who
  saluted him with a sword dripping from hilt to point in blood. The old
  gladiator's armour was hacked and dinted, his dress scorched, his face
  blackened with smoke; but though weary, wounded, and exhausted, his voice had
  lost none of its rough jovial frankness, his brow none of the kindly
  good-humoured courage it had worn through all the hardships of the siege.</p>

  <p>"Hail, praetor!" said he. "I shall live to see thee sitting yet once
  again, high on the golden car, in the streets of Rome. The Temple is thine at
  last, and all it contains, if we can only save it from these accursed flames.
  The fighting is over now; and I came back to look for a prisoner who can tell
  me where water may be found. The yellow roof yonder is flaring away like a
  torch in an oil-cask, and they must be fond of gold who can catch it by
  handfuls, guttering down like this in streams of fire. Our people, too, have
  cut their prisoners' throats as fast as they took them, and I cannot find a
  living Jew to show me well or cistern. Illustrious! I have won spoil enough
  to-day to buy a province I would give it all for as much clear water as would
  go into my helmet. The bravest old man in Syria is dying in yonder corner for
  want of a mouthful!"</p>

  <p>Returning through the court, in obedience to the prince's orders, to
  collect men and procure water, if possible, for the extinction of the
  conflagration, Hirpinus had recognised his young friend Esca with no little
  surprise and delight. Seeing Calchas, too&mdash;for whom, ever since his bold
  address to the gladiators in the training-school, he had entertained a
  sincere admiration&mdash;lying half suffocated, and at his last gasp, on the
  stones, the old swordsman's heart smote him with a keen sense of pity, and
  something between anger and shame at his own helplessness to assist the
  sufferer. He said nothing but truth, indeed, when he declared that he would
  give all his share of spoil for a helmetful of water; but he might have
  offered the price of a kingdom rather than a province, with as little chance
  of purchasing what he desired. Blood there was, flowing in streams, but of
  water not a drop! It was more in despair than hope that he told his sad tale
  to Licinius, on whom it seemed natural for every soldier in the army to
  depend when in trouble, either for himself or for others. Giving his orders,
  clear, concise, and imperative to his tribunes, the Roman general accompanied
  Hirpinus to the corner of the court where Calchas lay. Fallen beams and
  masses of charred timber were smouldering around, dead bodies, writhed in the
  wild contortions of mortal agony, in heaps on every side&mdash;he was sick
  and faint, crushed, mangled, dying from a painful wound, yet the Christian's
  face looked calm and happy; and he lay upon the hard stones, waiting for the
  coming change, like one who seeks refreshing slumber on a bed of down.</p>

  <p>As the kind eyes turned gently to Licinius, in glance of friendly
  recognition, they were lit with the smile that is never worn but by the
  departing traveller whose barque has already cast off its moorings from the
  shore&mdash;the smile in which he seems to bid a hopeful, joyful farewell to
  those he leaves for a little while, with which he seems to welcome the chill
  breeze and the dark waters because of the haven where he would be. Mariamne
  and Esca, bending over with tender care, and watching each passing shade on
  that placid countenance, knew well that the end was very near.</p>

  <p>His strength was almost gone; but Calchas pointed to his kinswoman and the
  Briton, while looking at Licinius he said. "They will be your care now. I
  have bestowed on you "countless treasures freely yonder in the camp of the
  Assyrians.* This you shall promise me in return."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The ground occupied by the Roman lines during the
  siege. ]</p>

  <p>Licinius laid his shield on the ground and took the dying man's hand in
  both his own.</p>

  <p>"They are my children," said he, "from this day forth. Oh! my guide, I
  will never forget thy teaching nor thy behest."</p>

  <p>Calchas looked inquiringly in the face of Hirpinus. The gladiator's rugged
  features bore a wistful expression of sorrow, mingled with admiration,
  sympathy, and a dawning light of hope.</p>

  <p>"Bring him into the fold with you," he murmured to the other three, and
  then his voice came loud and strong in full triumphant tones. "It may be that
  this man of blood, also, shall be one of the jewels in my crown. Glory to Him
  who has accepted my humble tribute, who rewards a few brief hours of
  imperfect service; a blow from a careless hand with an eternity of happiness,
  an immortal crown of gold! I shall see you, friends, again. We shall meet ere
  we have scarcely parted. You will not forget me in that short interval. And
  you will rejoice with me in humble thankful joy that I have been permitted to
  instruct you of heaven, and to show you myself the way."</p>

  <p>Exhausted with the effort, he sank back ere he had scarce finished
  speaking, and his listeners, looking on the calm dead face, from which the
  radiant smile had not yet faded, needed to keep watch no longer, for they
  knew that the martyr's spirit was even now holding converse with the angels
  in heaven.</p>
