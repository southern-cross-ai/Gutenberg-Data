<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Foreword by Lord Dowding</h2>

<p>I AM not quite sure how a Foreword is supposed to differ from a
Preface or an Introduction&mdash;possibly the difference lies in
its being written by someone other than the author of the book.</p>

<p>I shall assume that this is so, and bring out one or two points
which R.M.T. herself might be too modest to mention. The main point
in this connection is, I think, the calm faith and courage of this
mother who is a personal friend of mine. <i>Letters from
Lancelot</i> has brought, and this book will bring, solace to
hundreds of other bereaved mothers who have not attained to the
serene heights reached by R.M.T. It is not only the conviction of
immediate and conscious survival which they bring home so vividly
in every line, but it is the thought that our children not only
continue to exist consciously, but that they exist happily,
mirthfully and in an atmosphere of love and light and selfless
service.</p>

<p>Another point is that the Christopher-R.M.T. combination can
spell and write grammatical English.</p>

<p>I know that some superficial critics found the baby language of
Lancelot a bar to serious consideration of his book. To me, after
the first shock, it was one of its chief charms. Even now, in spite
of his great spiritual development, Lancelot has not learned to
spell&mdash;why should he indeed when there are so many more
important things to learn, and when language has given place to
thought-communication? He still retains his fondness for words like
"becos". The same critics could not understand how a hand which
could write "just wen I wos cuming to the most portant bit" could
spell "ectoplasm" and other difficult words correctly.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact this peculiarity throws a valuable light on
the mechanics of automatic or inspirational writing. There are in
fact two distinct but overlapping methods. When the power is strong
and the communicator knows exactly what words he wishes to
transmit, he can control the hand of the sensitive by means of an
"ectoplasmic extension". But when the power is weak or the
controlling mind hesitating, he influences the <i>mind</i> of the
sensitive and fishes in it for what he wishes to say.</p>

<p>One last word to the analytical reader&mdash;Don't allow
yourself to be antagonised by the strangeness of the account of
life in Mars, and in other worlds and planets, contained in the
later messages.</p>

<p>The strange thing to me is that humanity should receive so
comparatively few messages describing life and conditions in the
myriad globes with which our Universe is besprinkled, when there
are so many of our friends who have the opportunity of making
voyages of exploration.</p>

<p>I suppose the explanation is that the conditions encountered
simply cannot be explained in such a way as to "make sense" to
minds fettered by human limitations; and it is perhaps not very
important, in the present stage of our own development, that we
<i>should</i> understand them.</p>

<p>Christopher did not understand all that he saw, but he does his
best to give us his impressions. The journey to Mars was made in
order to obtain certain cosmic materials to assist in the
lightening of our darkness: he calls them ray-keys and we do not
understand yet what he means. Let us provisionally think of them as
prisms used for bending light and isolating from it radiations of
the precise wave-lengths needed for each specific purpose. For I
tell you, the Light is coming to us very soon now. Light in every
sense of the word. Light for our eyes, Light for the healing of our
bodies, Light for our minds and Light for our souls; and Lancelot
and Christopher are only two of the great Army of
Light-bearers.</p>

<p>Dowding.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>THE following letters have been received by me in "automatic
writing," from my son Christopher during the first two years of his
new life. Friends to whom I have shown them have suggested that the
information given about conditions in the "etheric" life is of
interest and may be helpful. Matter exclusively personal has been
omitted: otherwise the letters are given exactly as he wrote them,
except for some compression to avoid repetition.</p>

<p>A brief account of his earth life may give readers a background
for the better appreciation of his letters. Christopher was a
rather timid and self-conscious child, very affectionate and with a
vivid sense of colour and a great love of nature. His nursery days
were difficult for him owing to the illness of his brother Philip
who was three years his senior and whose mind became affected by an
attack of encephalitis lethargica at about the time of
Christopher's birth: the boys were at home together under a
governess until Philip was eleven years old. His eldest brother
Lancelot died at school at the age of eight: Christopher was then
only two-and-a-half years old and so can scarcely have remembered
him.</p>

<p>Christopher went to a small day school when he was five, to a
preparatory school at eight, and to a public school at
thirteen-and-a-half years of age. His various schoolmasters found
him a difficult boy to teach, and his reports were generally to the
effect that he was capable of much better work than his results
showed: an exception was his Eton music-master's report, which
praises Christopher for his industry as well as his aptitude with
the flute.</p>

<p>In June 1940 we decided to send him to America with our youngest
son David, who is frequently mentioned in the letters. The boys
sailed in July 1940 and were in the care of my cousin, Theodore, or
as he is called by the boys "Uncle Toby," until he died very
unexpectedly in May 1942. "Uncle Toby's" influence with Christopher
was admirable and profound, for he was deeply interested in
education and was also a psychologist and a mystic; under his
guidance Christopher developed markedly in character. Part of
"Uncle Toby's" earlier life had been spent gold-mining in Siberia:
he spoke Russian fluently and had great sympathy with the Russian
people. I think that this may account for Christopher's first
attempts to help soldiers on the battlefield taking place in
Russia.</p>

<p>After "Uncle Toby's" death Christopher was "adopted" by a family
in Portland, Oregon, and his brother David by another family until
such time as passages home could be obtained for them. This proved
difficult but eventually in March 1943 Christopher was given a
"priority" passage as he was nearing military age: he sailed from
New York about March 25, 1943. The rest we know from him in these
letters. The only official information we have received was on May
15th, 1943, that his ship was "greatly overdue and must be presumed
lost by enemy action" and we have been unable to trace any
survivor.</p>

<p>I have been asked to add a note on the way in which these
letters come to me. Readers of <i>Letters from Lancelot</i> will
have seen the explanation of this in the Appendix to that book. I
wish now to amplify this explanation. The writing is not
"automatic" in the sense that I am unconscious of what is being
written: it is in fact more akin to an ordinary conversation
between my son and myself except that as my etheric hearing is only
slightly developed, the talk on his part has to be written: for
this purpose Christopher uses my hand or, according to him, its
ectoplasmic extension. If my mind is fairly free I become aware of
his presence as soon as he arrives, but if I am preoccupied with
thought concentrated on other subjects it may be some time before
he can gain my attention which he says that he achieves by a
"gentle tap on the brain cells."</p>

<p>If a stranger tries to communicate with me, I only become aware
that someone in the etheric life wants my attention without
realising any distinct personality. With my sons or other near and
known relatives I feel this personality at once and I know who is
with me before they begin to write. This knowledge of a definite
and previously known person is to me a safeguard against any
deception&mdash;subconscious or by other entities. I seldom "write"
without this knowledge and never without the knowledge that someone
is present who wishes to communicate.</p>

<p>In view of the efforts of psychologists and others to explain
all communication from the next life between those who love each
other as a "wish-fulfilment" due to grief, emanating from the
subconscious mind of the one in earth-life, I ask that it should be
noted&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) That I was in clear communication with the etheric life for
many years <i>before</i> any child of mine had died, and</p>

<p>(b) therefore I never felt the grief which I know is felt so
bitterly by mothers who have not yet my knowledge, and which it is
my earnest desire that my sons' letters may relieve.</p>

<p>If any reader who is seriously interested would care to ask
questions concerning these letters or the method of their
communication, enquiries may be addressed to me at Cox's Mill,
Dallington, Heathfield, Sussex, England.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>A note from Christopher.</h2>

<p><i>August 29th, 1944.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">"Can I write a paragraph in the preface to my
book? Insert as follows&mdash;<br>
<br>
Strangers were a nightmare to the small boy who thought himself a
mark of reproach in every word said to or about him. An adoring
love of home and parents and an acute desire to shine in their eyes
more than his brothers was the mainspring of his life.<br>
<br>
Great belief in Mother's wisdom induced acceptance of Uncle Toby at
first, who soon gained respect and a desire to shine in his eyes
too was the ruling motive. Gradually a wider outlook opened and
other people became less formidable and therefore more real, until
a longing to shine in society began to dawn, which lasted till
death brought the realisation of values apart from self.<br>
<br>
I am very interested in the making of my book and wish I had
written my earlier letters better!<br>

<h2>Letters from Christopher</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Part 1</h2>

<p><i>June 3rd, 1943.</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, I am here, Mummy darling. I am being instructed in my new
life. I was afraid of death but I was glad when it was over, and I
had to be in a place of quiet for a long time till I lost my
fears&mdash;I am longing to be with you again and Dad and be at
home. It is funny to be like this not able to make you hear when I
speak to you, and all my plans of going into Dad's regiment are
upset, but I suppose they will let me help a bit even here. I have
guides who are helping me to find my way about. It is all very
confusing at first, because you see I never thought of coming into
this funny sort of life...I thought if I died I should be floating
about in the clouds somewhere, but I am in quite a solid sort of
life only you can't see it yet, but quite real. I will tell you
more about it next time, but they say I must go now. I don't know
who my guides are but they are very nice to me and help me all the
time.</p>

<p>"Goodnight, Mum, from Chris."</p>

<p><i>June 13th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Chris is longing to talk to Mums, but I am not yet proficient
and want to speak instead, and you don't hear&mdash;only a few
words at a time. Of course I know you can't, because I never did at
all. Mums, you are thinking of my childhood, and I am quite
different now but always same person...I am in bigger, less cramped
life now, and can express my feelings better than I could before.
But now I must tell you about it all. I was very weak and upset at
first because they didn't come for me for some time and I was so
frightened because I was lost and couldn't make out what had
happened to me. I felt I must be dead because I was not on the ship
and I knew I hadn't landed. You see, I came out of my cabin and it
was all water&mdash;I rushed up on deck and I...O, Mum, I can't go
on, you mustn't make me remember that. Cut to where I am now and I
can go on, but I mustn't go back till I'm stronger. I must go soon,
so I'll just say that I haven't seen anyone I know yet, so I can't
give news of them. I am training to help the soldiers fighting with
their fears, because I was so afraid that I need such training
before I can go on further. I am so glad to be over the frightened
part because that was my task on earth, to try to conquer fear. I
am full of buck now that I can get on further, and I shall be over
to see you often as I get stronger.</p>

<p>"So long&mdash;love to Dad, tell him I'll write to him next
time. I am glad you get my messages, even like this. Some day we'll
talk properly, when you come to this life too.</p>

<p>"Your loving son, Chris."*</p>

<p><i>(*Note.&mdash;Many who have read his first letters have
expressed surprise that Christopher should not have been met after
death by someone he knew, and should have gone through a short time
of feeling "lost" and alone. I believe that this was due to his own
introspective nature. His mind had been throughout his life centred
on himself and the effect he might produce on others; this
self-centredness probably made him unable at first to see those
helpers who were undoubtedly near him from the moment he died. It
needed a spirit of great power and love to break through the mist
of his self-imposed isolation and heal his
blindness.&mdash;R.M.T.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>June 15th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Chris wants to have a talk&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are making a place for me as if I had an earth body! It
isn't like that; I am close to you but I can't sit on the sofa
because it isn't in my life. I can see all of your life quite
plainly, but I can't do things with it, only with people who are
spirits too. The sofa looks like mist to me now, and quite clear. I
see all your solid things like shadows. I am guiding your hand by a
force you send out which is part of this life, so I can hold it and
make your hand work as I want it to, but it isn't quite like my own
writing because you are guiding the hand too. I am getting very
interested in the life here, it is all so much more natural than I
ever thought it would be, and very full of life and things to
do...Mums, you are so happy at having me with you...You aren't
stopping me, but I left off to kiss you, Mums my own. I went to see
Dave yesterday...I can go over there and back to you in very little
time as you count it, because I can travel by desire, which is a
sort of super speedway, much quicker than air travelling even. I
find this all very wonderful and had no idea the mind was so
powerful. I am being taught much about mind and its powers that are
so little used in earth life. Mind is the maker of all things. God
is mind, and we are bits of Him with self-will so that we can
become separate beings. All this is very wonderful to me to
realise. I am learning to play an instrument of music which will
take the place of my flute I loved. It is much finer sound than
air-borne waves, and you can't hear it any more than my voice now,
but it is <i>lovely</i>, I wish you could hear how lovely it sounds
in the harmony of sound over here. It is something like my flute to
look at but far easier to play and more beautiful to listen to...It
has a range of sound beyond anything you can understand...I have a
score of notes just like earth music but with greater pitch and
range, and all the great musicians of earth have written music for
this plane where I am now before they went on to higher planes. I
am full of kick over my music, it is so exactly Heavenly, just like
we used to call it on earth. I must not stay too long or you will
be tired my guides say, so&mdash;so long, Mums, from your son
Chris."</p>

<p><i>June 17th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to tell you about my life here. It is so lovely and
natural, much nicer than I imagined. I learn lots of science, only
it is completely different to earth science because it has to do
with matter in another form, the inside of what we see on
earth&mdash;it is as if matter was turned inside out and we are
dealing with the light side, you with the dark. I often look on at
my school's lessons and see them making experiments which are just
opposite to our forms here..."</p>

<p><i>Music on the wireless.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mum, I might be playing this tune, it is like one I play
now&mdash;Yes, I hear tunes of earth music but only in the minds of
people, not their instruments. You don't know it, but your mind
vibrates to human music so that you are making sounds in our life
when you're listening. My guides say you mustn't take too much at a
time, so I'll stop talking."</p>

<p><i>June 22nd.</i>
</p>

<p>"Heigh ho, a bit worried tonight. I can't find my patrol yet,
and I should be joining up now. I must be off soon to get to grips
with the problem. You see, I was under guides till yesterday, and
now they have told me to carry on by myself and call them if
wanted, so I want to show I can carry on, but I ought to join a
patrol for the boundary and can't find where they are yet. It is a
question of contacting their minds, and I haven't quite got the
hang of it yet, but I mean to carry on without calling for help or
I shall never get on.</p>

<p>"I must go, Mum, but I'll be in time tomorrow if I can come. I
shall be keeping the Silent Minute anyway though. So
long&mdash;love to Dad."</p>

<p><i>June 24th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mum's little boy! I'm six foot tall and broad in proportion I
would have you know. I'm shocked at you! I want to have a nice talk
before our 'Silent Minute', that's why I came early. I am keen to
tell you about my present surroundings and life, and it is so
difficult because I see everything in a different way, much fuller
and more beautiful&mdash;more sides to everything and no
perspective at all. Things don't get smaller as you go away from
them, but you needn't see more than you want to. It is hopeless to
try and explain to you because all our geometry etc., is quite out
of the picture, and no amount of Euclid could go anywhere
here."</p>

<p>R<i>. "It sounds as if you were in four dimensional space
now."</i></p>

<p>"I don't know, but I see what you mean&mdash;Yes, I suppose I'm
in four dimensional space now&mdash;you have given me a solution to
the problem, Mums, and I'll think it out. I believe that's what it
is. I am in space all right, no floating about loosely but quite
organised and real. I find it interesting and mean to try to
understand more about it all, but I should feel very lost without
you, Mum darling, for I can't find anyone I know, and the guides
have gone now...I believe I can't see them because I haven't learnt
some lesson I ought to know."</p>

<p>R.&mdash;<i>"Why not pray about it?"</i></p>

<p>"I never thought of prayer&mdash;Christ came when I was
drowning, to still the waves of fear, and I saw Him then...I must
pray, and then I shall know why I am alone so much, and some day I
shall see Him again...I thought He saved the disciples in the boat,
so I prayed then and He came. If I pray again He will hear me and
help me to see my way better...It is so real here, Mum...I can see
light when you pray, it shines like a ray of sunlight into the
darkness."</p>

<p><i>June 26th.</i>
</p>

<p>"You come nearer as I write, I notice. Let's be very cosy and
have a long 'pyjama talk' as Uncle Toby called it. I want to tell
you about my doings, and I am up against it for words because we
don't use them, only thoughts, which are much clearer here than
with you. I am trying to get into the way of thinking more directly
instead of round by means of words. I can begin by telling you of
our adventure when the boat was torpedoed. I don't mind talking
about it now for I am much stronger, and it isn't on my mind. It
was early in the morning of April 20th I think (but not sure of
date) when I was asleep and wakened by a bang which shook me out of
my bunk, and water rushed into the cabin before I could get
out&mdash;then I scrambled through it and came on deck, which was
awash, and the ship was settling down. I plunged overboard to try
to swim, but it was such a big sea that I couldn't get along. I was
struggling when they fired and I went down. Then I cried to Christ
and I was peaceful again and seemed to sleep. Soon I woke away from
it all in a great wide quiet place with grass and trees, and I
wandered about trying to make out what had happened to me. It
dawned on me that I must be dead because I couldn't have reached
land, but it all seemed too natural and homelike to be death. I got
a little worried because no one else seemed to be there to tell me
what to do, so I felt rather lost and very tired. I sat under a
tree just like an earth tree and rested and after a long time I
saw&mdash;MARY&mdash;I know now who She was; but then I only
blinked at Her light and wondered. I felt very tired still, and She
carried me in Her Arms as if I were a little baby, and Oh! the
comfort of Her strength&mdash;She never spoke, but took me to a
wonderful place of healing where I was rested and made whole again.
I can never forget the wonder of Her and being in Her Arms. I never
knew such a comforting healing presence. I stayed a long time in
that place, and left it in the care of my guides who only left me a
few days ago. Since then I have been shown so much that I am still
bewildered by it all&mdash;I am given certain duties at certain
times, and train to join later in the war of liberation of man from
earth-bound spirits&mdash;light against darkness&mdash;it is a
great fight and we are all in it together, but I am such a beginner
that I don't yet know what I have to do. I am keen to begin though,
and want to get on with my training. I see things so differently
now, and my earth life seems so silly compared to reality as I see
it now. I am just the same person though, not a bit changed, and
even feel as if I were wearing the same clothes, though I know it's
only my feeling of them. It is happy and free and quite beyond
words to express. I long to tell you, but I know it is impossible
to convey it to your minds at home&mdash;I am told you have taken
enough, so will just wait for Big Ben without talking any
more&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>June 27th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I'm so excited because I have been given a job to do. I am
going to be attached to a mobile unit of the camp force here which
arranges camps and rest centres for the men who come here from
battle. We have to move about with the fighting earth armies and
arrange for the reception of men who come over in a battle
suddenly. They are frightened sometimes, and I have been through
all that, so I can tell them it is all right and they need not be
afraid. I am so proud to be allowed to use my new powers already,
and I feel very elated and glad&mdash;I shan't be able to be with
you for some nights now because we are so much needed, but I shall
come when I can get off, and I shall be with you in spirit at nine
each evening&mdash;I can understand better how real it is to be
with anyone in spirit now. I am so thankful I can really help in
the war. I wanted SO much to join up, and was going to join Dad's
regiment but I was stopped, so now I am glad I can help gunners who
come on here and tell them I am a Gunner's son too. I am so
<i>glad</i> Mum, you don't know how much I wanted to join up, and
now I can help to win the war by keeping the minds of the soldiers
happy...I am to be a guide to the camp for men who come over, so I
shall be almost the first to tell them. I can do that because they
will see me just as an earth young man and it will seem natural to
them for me to be there. I shall just guide them to our camp one at
a time and hand them over to a proper guide. They are highly
trained for knowledge of human minds, and have all come back from
higher spheres to do this work of helpers here on earth. There are
thousands of them, and all have been purified and passed through
big tests which I know nothing about yet. I shall come and tell you
how I get on whenever I can...You mustn't write more to-night, Mum
darling&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>June 29th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Here I am now Mum, can we talk? I want to tell you that my work
is so interesting, and I am on the Russian front now. They can't
speak my lingo nor I theirs, but I am getting used to picking up
thoughts now and can give them an impression of what I want to say.
You see, that sort of thing is easier out of one's body. I went to
Smolensk first as a base for our operations, and then we plunged
into the fighting zone and found plenty of work already waiting,
for there were hundreds who had come out of their bodies
unexpectedly, so that their own people didn't know of it. You see,
we are all at work over here, and can't always be sending thoughts
to our earth relatives to find out if they are O.K.&mdash;I made
one bloomer though. I took a German sergeant to the same camp as
the Russian he had kicked when he was dying, and weren't they stiff
to each other! They had to be sent to separate camps till they
learn better behaviour, for that sort of thing doesn't go over
here. I made a good job of my first attempts on the whole though, I
was told, and I am so keen to get on with it and help a bit more.
We shall be with our own lads soon I hope but they aren't needing
so much help just now. I'm getting practice for when our big push
comes along. Mum, I am beginning to feel my feet a bit now, and
this life is just fine. I'm getting used to the ways of telling
meanings by thoughts instead of words; and the colours I see now
are marvellous, such beauty as I never dreamt of before. I long to
show you some of it, but earth eyes can't see it. I shall come when
I can to you and Dad and tell you all my experiences..."</p>

<p><i>(Later)</i> "We go in a group together and make a camp for
the reception of new-comers to this life&mdash;then we make it as
like as possible to their own surroundings so that they needn't
feel strange, and we go back into their homes to see if we can find
out where their relatives on this side are likely to be&mdash;that
is for more advanced thinkers than I am yet. We try to keep them
from any fear because that closes their spirit eyes and they can't
see while they are frightened. They often are too, which isn't
surprising really when you come to think of how frightened we used
to be at the thought of DEATH. I laugh to think how it looked from
my old life now. Well, they soon get over that, and most of them
will have it that they are not really dead at all and want to go
back to their army duties, so that we have to explain that they
can't do that sort of thing any more, but will have plenty of work
to do when they have rested a bit after the shock of getting
killed...Now let's talk about the communications between this life
and yours. I am told that they are to be extended quite a
lot&mdash;the time hasn't come yet for everyone to do it, but many
more than ever before, and you are wanted to spread the belief in
its truth and possibility all you can. Many more people will soon
be able to talk to this life than ever in the world's history, and
so people will have a clearer knowledge of what is coming when they
die to help them to prepare for it...I am so lucky to be able to
send any messages I want to, and put things right I did
wrong&mdash;I am NOT good yet, but I mean to try to be now..."</p>

<p><i>July 1st, 1943.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to tell you about our new Camp Commandant&mdash;He is
Uncle Toby! Aren't you surprised! I was, and ever so pleased. It
was a real thrill to know I should be working under him, and he is
just a Topper to be in charge here...I was working hard and had
just finished a bad case of nerves when I was told to go to
Headquarters as I was wanted, so I rushed off thinking I had got
hitched on the wrong job or something, when I saw Uncle Toby just
grinning at me like he used to do&mdash;I was just off my knocker
with joy to see him again, and he seemed awfully glad to find me
making good like that..."</p>

<p><i>July 2nd</i>.</p>

<p>"Uncle Toby says I am to be promoted soon to be a path-finder,
which means that I shall be able to find paths for men to go to
their homes by&mdash;It is difficult to explain, but you see we
have to trace their homes by thoughts they send out and then take
them by means of their thoughts making a sort of track which meets
the thoughts of those who love them. They are so glad to see their
wives and children again, but are sad that they can't make them
understand. I am lucky, Mum, to have you. I only hope I shall be
able to do it, because I am not very skilled yet at
thought-tracing. Uncle Toby says never mind, you try, so I must as
he's Commandant. I must tell you about my last exploit which I am
very proud of. I was making a dive for a good landing in the Camp
when I found my man I had in tow was beginning to funk it, so I
just landed him flat in the German lines. Of course they couldn't
see him and they didn't know he was there, but he got so full of
excitement at being among the enemy that he quite forgot to feel
afraid of flying above the ground without a plane. He was absorbed
in counting the guns and making notes of what he saw, and he wanted
to go back and tell his own people&mdash;however he soon found it
was no use as he couldn't make anyone understand, but he was ever
so much better to handle after that he had realised that he was
dead and could leave the ground without falling...</p>

<p>"You didn't know that I could fly? Of course I can, because our
bodies aren't made of anything affected by gravitation now, so I
can go wherever I want just by wanting to&mdash;I am trying to do
my bit so I don't want to leave earth yet, but I could if I wanted
to like Lancelot did...</p>

<p>"I want to say that I can make a powerful force which exerts
pressure on minds to influence them, but it isn't so strong as
will-power, and only minds which are not decided respond to it. If
they are wondering what to do of two things I can influence them to
decide...Of course I only use it for good, what do you think I am,
Mum! but it interests me immensely to see minds react to influence
by me, and makes me feel quite cocky about my powers! Goodnight,
Mums, I must go now."</p>

<p><i>July 5th.</i>
</p>

<p>R. <i>"Tell me what your daily life is like?"</i></p>

<p>"Oh well, it's a bit difficult to describe, because we don't
divide our time up into days and nights and meals, and divisions
like that. We just work hard and then rest when we feel tired, and
my enjoyment when I rest is to come home to Mum and Dad and talk to
you.</p>

<p>"I sometimes play my instrument and make wonderful harmonies,
and sometimes I walk in the woods and find flowers I don't
know&mdash;they all look so different to me now, all alive and
breathing, with feelings mounting up above them like coloured
mists. I must tell you one adventure I had which was very funny. I
went to a wood, near where they were felling trees, and I saw a
tree clinging to its body like a green mist, so I tried to
disentangle it to help it I thought, but it clutched round me
instead and I was all mixed up in the tree's etheric form which
wouldn't leave me. I had to tear it away, and it soon went off to
find a young growth it could inhabit. You see they don't really
live long because they aren't spirits, but only etheric forms, so
they gradually dissolve when their tree dies, but not at once. So I
never interfered with tree forms again...</p>

<p>"I shall so love to show you everything when you come here and
Dad too. It is difficult to describe though, because there is so
much in this life which you can't understand and I can't tell you
for lack of words. I can't explain the whole way the thing is
worked because I just don't know myself, but I tell you it is
good&mdash;oh boy isn't it just! like all you know of
toffee&mdash;yes, Mum, I lapsed into slang I believe&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>July 8th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I am longing to tell you what we are doing now, it's so
interesting. I am path-finding now, and shall be working on German
lines for a bit, to help me get over thinking of them as enemies,
which I can't help doing still. It is so difficult when one sees
them all thinking horrid thoughts about our country to remember
that we are all friends here whatever country we come from. I try
to trace their thoughts back to their homes and families and then
go there to see if I can get thoughts to come out to meet them, and
it is often not easy at all for their people will think of anything
else in the world than them, and I can't put thoughts into people's
minds well yet. It is such interesting work though, and sometimes I
succeed better than I expect. I went to a corner of Leipzig to find
a soldier's home and it was all wrecked and in ruins and his family
gone I don't know where&mdash;but I had to let him go to see for
himself and it was awful, he was so mad with rage and pain, and I
felt like a murderer myself, but it was only done by a bomb I
think. I wish it needn't be...Mum, I'm rather upset over what I've
seen. I seem to have grown so much older now. O Mum, you were
making a rainbow of prayer for that man, and I can see better now
how to help these people. I am looking out for his family now he
has given me a sight of them in his mind, and I hope to find them
safe somewhere..."</p>

<p><i>July 10th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to tell you about my new work of path-finding. I went to
the home of a Czech soldier who was killed in Russia because he
wouldn't fight for the Germans&mdash;he tried to cross over to the
Russian lines so they shot him. He was terribly anxious about his
family in case the Germans would ill-treat them, so we went
together and found his father had been killed but his mother and
sisters were all right, and very bitter about his father being
killed; so he is going to try to find his father and they will help
the others together. I left him looking for his father because
another soldier wanted help&mdash;and I tried to get a thought-path
for him to go to his wife, but she wouldn't think of him at
all&mdash;however his son did better and sent a long ray of thought
towards his father which lighted the path up beautifully&mdash;so I
left him going to see his son, and telling his wife to think of him
before I left. It is awfully interesting, but very tiring work
because I'm not very good at it yet."</p>

<p><i>(Later.)</i> "You were not listening when Big Ben struck,
Mums." <i>We turned on the wireless and found our watches were
slow.</i></p>

<p>"I see, you can't hear it till you turn the wireless on. I can
hear it right over in Russia without tuning in anything. Only one
word more, to tell Dad I am getting my stripe soon as a
path-finder. I am going now, Mum&mdash;Goodnight."</p>

<p><i>July 19th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I have been off on my own for the first time, and trying to
find how to trace people out by their thought-tracks. I went off to
follow that tank you saw on the road, to see what they were up to,
and then I traced the girl back to her home by seeing her thoughts
tracking back, and sure enough I found her mother thinking of her
when she met the girl's thought. It is awfully interesting, a sort
of new science of thought and feeling, and they weave colours all
over the place, quite lovely ones but very different to earth
colours."</p>

<p><i>Pause&mdash;Are you playing your instrument?</i>
</p>

<p>"Rather&mdash;I want to test your hearing again, so be still and
listen." <i>(Pause).</i> "You can't vibrate quite fast enough to
hear, but you caught a few notes I think&mdash;anyhow better than
last time...I shall be away from you after this leave for a bit,
because we are going to move camp again, and I hope it means we'll
be where our own fellows are fighting now. I should get on much
better with them I'm sure. We'll have a talk after the Silent
Minute to-night again."</p>

<p><i>July 19th, 9.5 p.m.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Expecting Christopher R. took a pencil, but to her surprise
it was Lancelot writing.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mum, I came to find you and Kitopher was talking to you in this
way. I am so surprised because I didn't know he had come through
death...I have been away over in Neptune since we last had a talk
and had EVER such a grand time in trying to understand their ways
of thought and new ideas..."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot seemed to step aside as Christopher came.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher writing&mdash;</i>"Mum, I
am...why...<i>(Pause).</i></p>

<p>"Chris speaking&mdash;Mum darling I am so excited&mdash;Lancelot
is here and was talking to you, and I am so taken aback I hardly
know what to say. He is so lovely, you never saw anything like him,
like a marvellous beautiful spirit of fire, and human too like me.
I am his brother! Mum darling, I am so glad to be here now&mdash;I
am to go with Lancelot to-night for a time of teaching, and we
shall both be with you to-morrow. So long, Mums&mdash;Love to
Dad."</p>

<p><i>July 20th. Lancelot</i>
</p>

<p>"Now, Mum, I want to tell you about our doings, Chris and I. He
is coming soon, but was anxious to tell someone about my coming
home again, so he went off to his camp. I showed him some of the
old schools I was in when I first came over here, and he was
awfully interested in seeing them, and how we got on in spiritual
ways more than in earth things. He wants to help in this war, so
that's why he will work so hard. I can help his work now I am on
earth, and teach him how to train his mind to help the soldiers
inwardly instead of only by outward guidance..."</p>

<p><i>Christopher arrived.&mdash;Christopher writing.</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm back rather out of breath&mdash;wait a bit&mdash;now,
Mum I'm fit to talk. I have so much to say I hardly know where to
begin. Lancelot is taking me round and showing me such a lot I can
hardly keep pace with it all. Let me begin at the end of yesterday
when he took me off to see a place of rainbow buildings where he
was at school, in his early days, all iridescent and shimmering
colours and baby spirits learning to love beauty and know God. I
was so astonished at the heavenliness of it all&mdash;so pure
and&mdash;just wonderful. I can't describe it, there aren't any
words. Then we went to another school where he had learnt to know
he must help other people, and that was plainer and more like earth
but all with a meaning. I can't explain, but it was also wonderful.
I can't tell you all of it because it is so different to our earth
training, but so much more glorious and beautiful. I don't think
brain work comes into it at all but only the power of mind and
spirit forces with love and joy and helping those on earth. I think
I shall be quite different for having seen it all...I suddenly
thought how much Uncle Toby would like to know Lancelot was back,
so I bolted off like a shot rabbit to tell him while Lancelot
talked to you. Uncle Toby was ever so glad to hear the news. Now I
must stop and tell you more another night. Lancelot is going to
show me some more wonders I think. I can't tell you how wonderful
it all is..."</p>

<p><i>July 21st</i>.</p>

<p>"Chris speaking. I want to tell you of all my doings and
busyness since I last spoke. First I went off with Lancelot to a
city of spar (has the word got an R?), and he showed me that the
people loved their beautiful homes so much that they spent all
their time getting more beautiful things for them. They aren't very
high in spirit, Lancelot said, because they are so absorbed in
their own interests. Then he took me round a marvellous track of
speed-cars&mdash;you don't believe we have cars over here? Well,
they are all imagined by people who are so full of interest in them
that they long to go on making and driving them, so they build them
up out of their minds and make them real by wanting them so much.
Over here we have all we want by creating it out of our desires, so
it's very vital to have good desires, other-wise you have to be
suppressed like the guinea-pigs in Alice in Wonderland. Lancelot
knew I should love to see that, but he was careful to tell me that
they were not high spirits either. You see he explained that we
ought to get further than wanting earth things still, as there are
millions more things we never knew on earth to carry our knowledge
further and further for ever."</p>

<p>R. <i>"You said you were 'out of breath' when you came
yesterday, how can you be out of breath when you no longer breath
air?"</i></p>

<p>"Yes, I was out of breath because I had rushed so fast that I
hadn't time to think my way by stages, and it's a sort of mental
breath when you want to go faster than you can think. I can't
explain better because circumstances are so different here and we
do everything in a different way, and the other way round. Can you
grasp that if you want to think faster than natural it makes you
out of breath mentally?...I understand much more now than I ever
knew before seeing Lancelot&mdash;it has been a great education for
me just to be with him and see him.</p>

<p>"I must go after the Silent Minute, so goodnight, Mum. Tell Dad
goodnight from me. Chris."</p>

<p><i>July 22nd</i>.</p>

<p>"I was away on a tracking job of tracing minds in military
barracks&mdash;didn't you feel me leave the car where you passed a
Tommy with a bayonet on sentry go? I want to get into touch with
their kind of mind process, so that I can be more useful when we go
to our own men.</p>

<p>"Now about Philip, I was most interested in his psychic self
which is far better developed than his human brain. He sends out
wordless waves of psychic thought which are quite beyond me and
wonderful to see&mdash;I am glad to see him from this life because
it is so plain that he is quite a fine developed spirit and only
inhibited by human brain injuries which I can see plainly visible
from my plane&mdash;they look like brown places in his mind where
action is prevented in the brain cells. The speech centre is
affected and the emotional will-power so that he can't be attentive
to other people's emotions.</p>

<p>"He is very strong in other ways, intellectually and physically,
but he can't express this because of the speech damage&mdash;His
psychic self is great, much bigger powers than mine, and he is
learning a lot of our ways of thought-waves which he can't show in
human life but which he uses well even now.</p>

<p>"I was very close to his mind several times, but I don't know if
he saw me because he wasn't thinking of me at all but absorbed in
you and Dad, and funny ideas of animals which come from his seeing
their psychic selves as well as the earth form. He is very
contented with his life, and knows much more than he can show of
why he is under control and taken care of,&mdash;He feels unable to
manage his physical self, so he is happy to leave his life to
others and learn on the psychic plane where he is getting on so
well&mdash;I can't tell you more because I wasn't there long
enough, but I am quite sure he is happy and loves the people he is
with."</p>

<p><i>July 23rd. At Cox's Mill.</i>
</p>

<p>"I don't know about what Dad was asking&mdash;etheric forces for
vegetables&mdash;I think they belong to a sub-spiritual life which
the tree and plant etheric forms belong to&mdash;I am very
interested in learning about other forms of life now because there
was no indication of them in earth life, and really they are most
complicated and numerous, all interlocking each other in a sort of
sequence beginning with their outer earth-forms up to the
spiritual, which only man and the higher mammals and birds possess.
Birds have spirits I am so glad to see, because they are such
darlings and I love them so much, but they are very wee little
spirits and always bird-like, no transmigration like the Indians
think so far as I can see. Animals have quite big spirits of their
kind sometimes.</p>

<p>"Can I just tell you a bit about my training to see thoughts? I
hope to be able to trace people to their homes quite well soon and
not to make mistakes.&mdash;Now let's have a try at thought-reading
without a pencil&mdash;I see you need the writing to crystallise
your ideas on mine so to speak.&mdash;You go all woolly after a
minute of thought-speaking without writing.&mdash;I see, yes,
perhaps you ought not to do it&mdash;but some people in earth life
are quite good at it.&mdash;I think you are a little afraid to try.
I am enjoying my leave ever so much, it is so peaceful at home and
just like old times. Give me a boat and I'll be slacking on the
pond like 1939.&mdash;So long, Mum and Dad, till to-morrow. From
Chris."</p>

<p><i>July 24th. At Cox's Mill.</i>
</p>

<p>"I am waiting till you have finished your business&mdash;I want
so much to tell you how I feel about this place.&mdash;It is a
centre of fairy life and I can see them now. When you used to tell
me there were fairies here I thought you just meant it was lovely,
but I can see now lovely little beings belonging to the etheric
life who are decorating the trees with coloured lights and building
small homes of moss and fern and tiny plants.&mdash;They are not
spirits but beings of a lower life invisible to you but quite
visible to me now, and I see how fairy stories began with glimpses
of that etheric life. It is fascinating to watch their activities
for they are so busy, but they don't seem to see our life of
spirits&mdash;they see and know of earth life and use earth things
though they are in the etheric world themselves. I suppose they are
a link between the two&mdash;Oh yes! I think I remember you told
me, but I didn't believe you then&mdash;I was so positive that
fairies were imagination...</p>

<p>"Our ship was torpedoed at night so suddenly that there seems to
have been no time for anyone to rescue us.&mdash;I don't know what
happened to any of the others because I was so alarmed, I just
jumped for it when I saw the boat was almost down and I heard
firing and I think they hit the sub, but I don't know because I
went straight down and never came up again.&mdash;It was a night
attack on the whole convoy I believe: but perhaps they didn't know
for some time which ships had gone down, because they all scattered
when there was an alarm.</p>

<p>"I want just to tell you something else about this place which I
love, and that is the feeling of the old forests which were here
hundreds of years ago, and have left etheric forms here.&mdash;They
are so beautiful those ancient trees which have loved this place
before men cleared the forests, and I can see them still in places
here where the ancient feeling lingers&mdash;It is so beautiful and
such a home to me.</p>

<p>"I think we might leave off talking and just enjoy it
here&mdash;Yes, we'll keep the Silent Minute later but not talk
to-night&mdash;Talk to-morrow here.&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>July 25th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, Dad, of course I hear what you say <i>and</i> see you
thinking it, so be careful!!&mdash;Of course I should not presume
to criticize my father!&mdash;I must build myself a boat in this
life which I can use here for old time sake, because it would be
jolly to sail on the pond, and I could keep it for holidays
only&mdash;I can make anything I really want now by concentrating
mind power on it, but of course that would only be for my slack
times&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mum, I want to tell you that Uncle Toby is moving camp
to-morrow, so this is our last talk for a few days, and then I
shall come to Stoke again, shall I? I don't yet know where we shall
be, but I hope with some of our own men&mdash;I must get on well
with my work to be of some use in the world&mdash;they want all the
help they can get just now.&mdash;I meant to tell you that Topsy is
still here; she loves this place too and is ever so happy with old
Toby the brown horse who used to be here too&mdash;His name began
with T, but I don't think it was Toby? Tom was it?&mdash;No! I
don't see our guinea-pigs, and I don't think they have spirits only
etheric forms which soon dissolve away.&mdash;I can't quite make
out where they draw the line and begin to have real spirits? I
think horses are higher than guinea-pigs, but I don't know why they
should be more spiritual? I am not sure yet about guinea-pigs
though, for I have seen mice in our life, and cats too&mdash;I
haven't seen our Mew though, so perhaps she isn't dead yet?</p>

<p>"I think you are busy so I must stop chattering. I must give you
a hug, Mum, for this lovely holiday&mdash;I have so enjoyed it and
had a real quiet rest in my dear old home. So long, Dad, see you
again soon, I shall have news then of my work I expect.</p>

<p>"Your son, Chris."</p>

<p><i>The name of the old brown horse was Turpin. Topsy was the
children's pony who had to be destroyed owing to illness.</i>
</p>

<p><i>July 28th, 1943.</i>
</p>

<p><i>In the garden at Stoke I heard a few words which sounded like
Christopher, so a few minutes later went in and got a pencil fro
him to write.</i>
</p>

<p>"Chris is away, it was me you were so close to Mum darling, and
I loved to see your mind in doing the roses&mdash;I pretended to
try and talk like Chris to see if you would think I was he, but
then I was sorry becos' you did, and I had to go away to keep from
laughing at my success&mdash;I am still just a joker you see, and
it was rather a silly joke, becos' I know you can't see us yet.
Chris is in camp still, and I am with you and Dad for a bit of a
rest from my work&mdash;Dad darling is pleased to hear from me
again&mdash;I am so HAPPY with you both becos' you are my HOME
always, however far I go on my work&mdash;"</p>

<p>R. <i>"But children leave home to make homes for
themselves!"</i></p>

<p>"I know but somehow I don't, but seem to belong to you and Dad
in a special way becos' I didn't have a home of my own on earth, so
I didn't grow any other human ties&mdash;I belong to CHRIST
altogether, but HE tells me that you are my home&mdash;I see you
have other things to do now and I must stop, but we'll talk again
another evening shall we DARLING? LOVE to DAD ever so much from
LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>July 29th. Lancelot writing.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mum darling, I have been to see how Chris is getting on with
his camp moving, and I tried to find him by thought-waves but he
isn't advanced enough to respond to that yet.</p>

<p>"Chris is hearing more now of other things than earth, and is
getting on very well.&mdash;I found him sitting with Uncle Toby in
a circle of newly joined recruits hearing a communication from
their Leader, who is a very advanced spirit of higher planes. Uncle
Toby was very surprised to see me, and so glad, I could see. He
told me that he had read my book, so I said what book? and he
explained that it was all my letters to you which you had printed a
long time ago, so he was quite like an old friend to me.</p>

<p>"I was very glad to see that Chris is under him for work, becos'
Uncle Toby is so big in his ideas that he will soon move to a
higher plane than earth and be able to help in bigger ways than
now."</p>

<p><i>Big Ben struck 9 p.m.</i>
</p>

<p>"I saw a light spread over England when the clock
struck&mdash;All together&mdash;I see, what a lovely idea to do it
all at the same time&mdash;I can't join when I'm out of Earth, but
when I'm at home I will love it, so put my name down on the
Fellowship or whatever it is&mdash;</p>

<p>"Goodnight DARLINGS from LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>August 1st. Lancelot.</i>
</p>

<p>"You are so obliging, Mum, to come just when I want to talk! I
was quite prepared to wait till your bedtime. I want to tell you
about Chris, who is very courageously trying to take his part in
the war. He is very sensitive and it hurts him to see martyrs over
there in the battlefields. He was afraid to go at first to where
they were being killed, and offered to give help in the camp, but
he was ordered to the front and went so bravely though he was
desperately afraid of seeing men in pain. Now he has got over his
fear of it, and is quite good at bringing newcomers along. I am
very proud of his courage, which matters more for his future than
you realize now. You are his inspiration and Dad&mdash;he longs to
be a son you are proud of, but he is too shy to say so&mdash;so be
very proud to hear of his work when he comes to you. He is so full
of colour and music, and that makes him dread the harsh colours of
pain and fear, but he can bring much more help now than if he had
never been so afraid himself.</p>

<p>"I've got a surprise for you. Here is Uncle Toby!"</p>

<p><i>Theodore&mdash;"uncle Toby" writing.</i>
</p>

<p>"Now, Ruth, I have taken the opportunity of Chris being absent
to tell you a little about him. I am very pleased with the progress
he has made and very happy about his future. You know so little of
the working of our present life that it is plainly useless to tell
you much about his work but he is forming a splendid character and
will be a fine spirit in time. He will be able to come for his
birthday, and frequent visits to you are needed by him now for you
supply love, which is the best working force there is, so I want
him to come to you often, but to learn not to do it solely for his
own pleasure. I can assure you that his highest welfare is my
present work, and I am waiting for high guidance for him too.
Lancelot has been a tremendous asset, for he supplies a great
incentive, the hero worship motif. He is a great lad and you will
be indeed a proud mother when you see him again. My duties call and
I have many just now, for fighting is heavy and we can hardly
manage to meet them all though there are thousands of us at the
work. I am glad to have had this opportunity of telling you how I
feel about Chris and his progress. Au revoir, Theodore&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>August 3rd&mdash;Christopher's Birthday (Afternoon).
Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"I had a most interesting morning in Dad's drill hall, and I
could tell the Germans heaps of secrets if I liked! I was absorbed
in the instructors and their work, so much more complicated than I
ever thought guns would be. I'm rather glad I didn't have to learn
all that after all. Say, boy, what a bally show of guns and
carriages and all. Dinky little show spots on the walls, too, and
all too cute lil aeroplanes hanging around, I gotta hunch Dad'll be
mighty proud of that lot.&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>5.30 p.m. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, as usual you are right, Mum, we are both here now, isn't
it jolly. I am quite bucked at having a birthday party with
Lancelot, too. No birthday cake Mum? How silly of you to think of
that, as if we wanted any! Lancelot is going to write
now"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lancelot.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mum ownest, I am so pleased to be home for Kitopher's party
Sorry, Chris, I forgot. He says he is having a swell time&mdash;I
like to hear him talk Yankee don't you? but he puts it on for fun,
I believe"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"Now Chris is writing. What fun it is, Mum, to be all together
like this with Lancelot, too, and dear old Dad sitting reading like
he always did. I do love to be here with you all again. Lancelot
seems quite natural to me now as if I had grown up with him. You
see, he remembers most things about my life, even things I had
forgotten, and tells me of them, and he is such a Topper, I can't
tell you how wonderful he is to me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now I must tell you that we are camping in Sicily next to give
me some practice with the Italianos I suppose, so I hope I shan't
have to be lugging Germans about again, they are really too tough a
lot for a youngster like me to tackle, but Uncle Toby gave orders
so I had to do it. I should be much better with our own boys I feel
sure and p'raps he'll let me do that for a bit of a treat.</p>

<p>"We have still got to set up the camp, and it will be all
different now, to suit the men we are likely to have to help. I
hear they are awfully pleased with Uncle Toby's work on the Russian
front, and talk of making him head of all the camps over there, so
I may be sent back there again with him, for he wants to keep me.
He says he takes a fatherly interest in my progress and wants to
keep an eye on me. Now I'm going off with Lancelot, who has got a
special treat for me, he says&mdash;something of a wonder to show
me, I expect. We shall be here again round about Big Ben time
to-night.</p>

<p>"What a birthday! O boy some day! Cheerio till
to-night.&mdash;Chris. <i>9.15 p.m."</i></p>

<p>"Mummy, I am going to leave you and Chris to talk, I am saying
goodnight to you and Daddy darlings&mdash;GOD BLESS YOU FROM
LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>Christopher took the pencil.</i>
</p>

<p>"Chris speaking, Mum&mdash;Lancelot has gone now. I must tell
you what a show he has given me to-night, only I find it impossible
to describe in words. It was like a mountain of mists all made of
colours new to me altogether, not the same as earth colours at
all&mdash;and wonderful patterns kept forming in them like a
kaleidoscope only infinitely more beautiful&mdash;as if someone
were inventing beautiful embroidery or&mdash;no, all the words I
use seem to mean something small and stupid&mdash;there just aren't
any words to describe what I saw, it was so lovely. It made me gasp
with the beauty&mdash;sheer beauty of it all.</p>

<p>"I think it was still on earth only not in your plane of being,
because we didn't go away any distance, we just stood and watched
it for hours&mdash;and then I hadn't seen enough, but Lancelot said
you would be expecting us and we ought to go. He is a most
wonderful brother to have. I am so lucky in my family, and to spend
my birthday with you and Dad and Lancelot has been the most
wonderful day of my life.</p>

<p>"Now darling, I can see you are tired so I won't write more
to-night. I must get back to work, but I think I shall be able to
come fairly often when Uncle Toby gives me leave. Goodnight, Mum
and Dad, with many thanks for a jolly good birthday, from
Chris."</p>

<p><i>August 5th. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"I have been allowed to come to-night to tell you about our
doings. I am delighted to find that we are behind the lines of the
8th Army itself! The one place I wanted, and Uncle Toby is so
lenient and says I am to help the Tommies now. He says he was so
pleased that I tackled Germans as best I could without grousing too
much, and he is going to let me enjoy myself a bit! They <i>are</i>
a fine lot of men. I never realised before how grand men's minds
could be till I saw them from the inside like this. I haven't
really started work yet, but I wanted to tell you the good news
that I am with our boys now. I came over a new way to-day, by
aeroplane instead of by thought-waves. I saw one of our planes
taking off and sat on the wing of it, and buzzed over to Tunis
before I realised it wasn't going home. Then I got off and tried to
contact thoughts for a home-bound plane, and soon found one was to
leave from that very aerodrome, so I tried the same dodge and had a
lovely ride high among the clouds and above them. Too high to see
much but clouds below like a blanket. I enjoyed the trip though,
because it was a new sensation&mdash;one goes too fast travelling
by will-power; one has to concentrate all the time on where one
wants to get to, so one can't enjoy the journey much.</p>

<p>"Now, Mum, I want to say a bit of my new creed which I am making
out of what I have been taught&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Written very slowly.</i>
</p>

<p>"1. I believe in GOD being LOVE.<br>
2. I believe in CHRIST being LIFE.<br>
3. I believe in SPIRIT being CONSCIOUSNESS.<br>
4. I believe in CREATION being the working of these three."</p>

<p>"I wanted to try and put that into words, because it helps me to
see it formulated, and I am beginning to grasp much more of these
things than entered my head before&mdash;I want to make a rule of
life which comes from the above. It runs something like
this&mdash;</p>

<p>"I WILL TO LIVE ALWAYS BY LOVE IN CHRIST AND MAKING OTHERS
CONSCIOUS OF HIS LOVE IN ME&mdash;THIS SHALL BE MY RULE OF
LIFE.</p>

<p>"Now a word about Dad&mdash;I want so much to help him in his
work, and Uncle Toby is going to let me come to his drill hall on
occasions when we are slack at the front and see if I can tune the
vibrations to be helpful to him. It was an idea that came to me a
long time ago, and when I told Uncle Toby he said it was quite a
good one. He showed me a bit how to work it, and I feel sure I can
help in that way. I am doing a bit of path-finding at home now we
are with the Tommies, so if I help a man to his home rather quickly
I can just come along to Dad afterwards, Uncle Toby doesn't expect
me to do more than one at a time. I think we'll wait now for Big
Ben&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>August 6th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Can you let me come for a talk on coming Sunday? It is a great
day and I am free to keep it as a holiday. All day with
you&mdash;but just a talk now and then? I'm so glad. Just over on
path-finding and jinked over to tell you that. So
long&mdash;C."</p>

<p><i>August 8th. Sunday</i>
</p>

<p>"I was listening to Dad's music&mdash;I don't want to talk till
it is over...You didn't mind, did you, Mum darling?...You hear
music an awful lot in your mind.</p>

<p>"Now I must tell you why I said it was a great day to-day,
because you were wondering about it on our walk.</p>

<p>"It is a day of prayer with our camp organisations, and I joined
them from dawn till I came to you at your breakfast, I have been
with them in spirit too since then, but Uncle Toby said I couldn't
go so far as the more experienced spirits, so I could have a
holiday instead. It is great because so much help is given to them
to carry on better than before, and it is as if a great force was
set free by their all joining in together, like we try to do at the
Silent Minute every evening.</p>

<p>"I love to see Dad's mind when he is interested, and want to
tell him that I just don't know about our bodies, what their
chemical analysis is&mdash;I only know that they are more solid to
me that yours are now, and that I can do things impossible before,
such as fly and get through things which used to be solid, such as
walls, etc. I don't have to open a door to go into a room I just go
through it&mdash;it seems just a soft misty thing to me and
<i>I</i> am the solid&mdash;the same with everything. Yes, the
aeroplane I came over on was a sort of mist but just solid enough
to support me by wanting it to do so. You see, I can wish solidity
into things if it suits my purpose. In fact I've a lot of power
over what I see only not to interfere with them from the earth view
point. But I can't answer Dad's problems because I simply don't
know.</p>

<p>"Early on in the day I went to path-find for practice, and came
across a level track of thought leading ever so far, so I went
along the beam and it came from a mother who was ever so anxious
that her son should be healed. I looked to see her son, and he is
unsound in his mind I think, because parts of his brain looked dark
and cloudy&mdash;not like Philip's, but just cloudy, no definite
spots of dead cells. I think he is being helped very much by her
love, because the beam of her thoughts was so broad and clear that
I could see it easily&mdash;<i>(question)&mdash;</i>I don't know
her name but I felt I was guided to see her son, so probably she is
meant to know how I saw her mind. Tell her that he has only a
clouded mind, no dead spots in it, and I think it will clear in
time. I am no expert in these things, so can't say for certain, but
it seemed to me that her beam of thoughts must be a very great help
to him; and I saw a helper with him who seemed ever so loving, a
man who loves him very much."</p>

<p><i>Later.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to explain about seeing thoughts. So far I find I can
see those sent out towards other people like my path-finding work
because they are sent out seeking, so to speak, and want the person
they are addressed to to find them. I can see all your thoughts
addressed to me and some of Dad's when he speaks or thinks of me,
but I can't see ordinary thoughts of earth people, only those which
make light, and all loving thoughts do. I can't see what people
think in their ordinary lives though.</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid I couldn't play the spy on the Germans because
their thoughts are hard enough to read when they are dead and I'm
sure living Germans are much harder. I don't think anyone in our
plane can tell the human plans people are making, but of course the
higher spirits can, but they know when to interfere and when people
must be left to themselves. Mum darling, you are a bit tired, I
think, so we had better stop. I shall stay awhile and sit with you,
but we won't write any more. Love to Dad, from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>August 14th.</i>
</p>

<p>"You are not busy are you Mums? I would like a jolly good chat
with you because I haven't been for some days so I have a lot to
say.</p>

<p>"We are working ever so hard at the front, and it is awfully
good fun being with our own boys. I am so happy over it all now,
because their minds are so clean and healthy compared to Russians
or Germans. Russians are awfully cruel in their thoughts you see,
and have no feelings of pity and fair play and not to hit a man
when he's down, and our boys are so bright in thoughts compared to
them. German minds are simply horrid to deal with, but Uncle Toby
says that I haven't got a missionary spirit yet or I would want to
tackle the worst minds!&mdash;You've got it Mums, he said it with a
chuckle and I know it was taking me off, but I just love taking
charge of a Tommy and telling him about the new life, they are so
full of interest and keen about it at once. I want to spread the
knowledge of it among their wives and families and I think that man
you met, Sir Hugh something, is the one to do it, because I saw
when you were with him that he is full of ideas of letting people
know more about us. You see, they do wish their families could know
they are all right, and so few people can. Can you spread the
knowledge all you know how? It will help my work a lot if you
do.</p>

<p>"Now I want to tell you a strange happening which I can't really
understand myself. It was when a man came over suddenly by a bullet
from a gun&mdash;he was machine gunner in an aeroplane and he was
shot while doing it, but his body went on doing the machine gunning
for quite a long time after I had seen his spirit leave it. It
looked so queer that his body went on firing the gun hard and he
wasn't there at all! I don't think it was aimed at all, but it went
on firing away, and he was away from it with me. Is it possible to
go on living when you have gone out of the body?..."</p>

<p><i>(His father explained the mechanism of the machine gun, and
suggested that the man's finger remained pressing the trigger, so
that the gun went on firing automatically.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Dad has explained it splendidly because he knows about the
gun&mdash;I suppose that was it.</p>

<p>"I have lots I could tell you if you have time? Well, I find I
can bring my communication with you to a higher pitch by lowering
my vibratory system to support yours, so that we tune in better
together. You see, I vibrate much more quickly now than bodily
life, that's why you can't see me&mdash;so if I can lower the rate
of my vibrations you might see me one day! O I don't think it could
hurt me&mdash;you see, nothing can injure a spirit, it is only a
question of whether I have the power to do it.</p>

<p>"I have thought of another thing to tell you about my work. I
can bring men over here so easily to see their families because
there are long strands of thought always lighting up the way here
from the people in England. They think of their own men infinitely
more than the Germans do of theirs and love them so much more. I
can easily find a family of one of our Tommies, for they think of
him nearly all the time as a rule. I wish they could know how to
talk to those who die though. I believe they are ready for it over
here more so than anywhere else in the world. Mum, you will tell
people, won't you?...<i>(A rainbow out of the window.)</i> Mums,
you are so lovely when you see something beautiful, your heart
shines out like a rainbow itself. I can see your colours getting
glowing and warm with love of beauty. I must be getting over to
America soon to see Dave, so I'll say good-night, darling. Love to
Dad and thank him for elucidation of my mystery about the
gunner.</p>

<p>"So long, Dad and Mum, from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>August 15th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I would like to tell you something about my journey to Dave. I
went in a cloud which was travelling so fast that way that I
thought that it would save me some effort, and I found I could
support myself on it like a feather bed, it was so thick compared
to air. I enjoyed it over the sea, there were such wonderful
colours in the clouds and water, like a most beautiful picture and
very changeful, always absorbing new rays of light and making
prisms in which they were magnified and separated into rainbows. It
was so much more beautiful seen from my life than anything I saw in
bodily life before. I was so absorbed that I nearly forgot where I
was going and had to get off on another track in a hurry. I then
worked my way to Dave by wishful thinking&mdash;which is a very
real way of getting about, and not something wrong which they seem
to think over here. I get along fine like that now, but it is more
effort than travelling on a conveyance such as a cloud or an
aeroplane. I think you are tired, Mum darling, so I'll say
good-night and see you again next Sunday, I expect&mdash;I'm
working harder now, you see. Good-night, Dad. Your son CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>August 21st.</i>
</p>

<p>"I shall be coming to-morrow for my Sunday talk, but I just want
to-night to say that I made a forced landing on Italy near Naples,
and saw bombed areas galore, and smouldering ruins and people were
digging for their lost possessions and looking awful. I felt so
sorry for them, but I suppose it helps to win the war. I took off
again before long. I am very busy in our camp now because there are
still hundreds to be rounded up and brought in, mostly Germans
funnily enough. I thought we were fighting Italians there, but they
seem to have surrendered without getting killed, and the Germans
fought like tigers&mdash;they are rather like tigers in character I
think. Our men are jolly and full of fun and great to help. I just
love being with them. Now, Mum, I must hop back again, but I want
to say good-night to Dad, so tell him I'm saying it will you?</p>

<p>"Goodbye till to-morrow Mums.</p>

<p>"Ta, Dad, I did like your thoughts..."</p>

<p><i>August 22nd.</i>
</p>

<p>"Now, Mum darling, you are fussing over my paper as if I minded
what we write on! and I waiting to tell you important news! I am
expecting a home job soon. Uncle Toby is coming over to England to
join forces with Cushna...Yes, you know his name, the friend of
your friends. He wants recruits for the awakening of England to our
side, and I am to be helping by giving you messages for his friends
without psychic power like that Sir Hugh who is such a great force
but not psychic he thinks. I am fairly aching to be working with my
Mums, and now I've had some foreign experience, Uncle Toby thinks
it will be quite a good thing for me to be home and dealing with
English minds for a bit. I am so bucked about it.</p>

<p>"Now I want to tell you some more about our projects&mdash;Uncle
Toby and I are coming over here in about a week's time when our
camp would be moving anyway, and we are joining up with a group of
experts in human guidance, to try and build more recognition of our
life into the minds of English people. England is far away ahead of
the rest of the world in communicating with us, so we are trying to
get the thing in full swing here and other nations will have to
acknowledge its truth. It is to be a counter-blast to those who say
there is no life after death and also to some people like the Japs
and Chinese who are very full of fear of devils and such like. I
haven't been over there, but Uncle Toby says it's awful the amount
of encouragement given to low class spirits to pretend they are
fierce devils and get worshipped out of fear.</p>

<p>"So to get the world out of that sort of thing it is necessary
to have more communication with our side and then we can give a
truer picture of life here. I am to help in this by talking to you
and taking messages from one set to another of people, so I hope
you'll try and give me more time, Mum darling, and we can work at
it together.</p>

<p>"I must just add another thing and then you must stop. I came
over by sea part of the way this time, but it was too slow for me,
so I had to get on by desire. I took a boat from Gibraltar and made
a few experiments with a microphone they had on board&mdash;not a
microphone, just a radio set&mdash;I wanted to see if my waves
corresponded with the radio waves, but they are a different set it
seems and can't be used by us for communicating at present. I think
we need a stronger medium than electro-magnetic waves and have to
have something akin to human ectoplasm or a brain of some kind to
work on. All these experiments are interesting though, and I dare
say we shall hit on something to link the two worlds together soon.
Now we must stop or you will be tired, my Mum, darling. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>September, 1st, 1943.</i>
</p>

<p>"You aren't too busy are you Mum darling? because I am longing
to tell you about our new move to Canterbury where Uncle Toby is
joining a pilgrimage of spirits belonging to England, or who love
the English, and they are starting from Canterbury because of all
the old feelings in the place of past pilgrims. We have left our
camp temporarily to be carried on by all the others&mdash;there are
hundreds of them&mdash;and we are joining this great effort for the
awakening of England to spiritual life. It is going to be a tussle
because of the Church-mindedness of the very people who would be
most help! I mean they follow the church ideas of prayer and
sacraments being all that is needed and won't have anything to do
with talking to our life and learning the laws which govern it. So
we are up against the very good ones who ought to be most help,
more's the pity...Now we are going to be in England I can come more
often, but I want to be working hard at our crusade, and we are
going all over England in bands to turn people's minds to thinking
of life after death and what it may be like&mdash;then people like
you who know how to talk to me will get more chance of telling
other people about it. I am very keen to do this because it links
me up with your work and Dad's too. I go to Canterbury to-morrow to
a big sort of dedication of us all, there where the old pilgrims
prayed for England in Canterbury Cathedral and made a force of love
of country which still inspires the place. I <i>love</i> it, Mum
darling...My Mother...I have your blessing like a knight going to a
crusade of old. I must go now for you ought to stop, and I will
come more often now. Tell Dad, and I'll wait to see his thoughts of
me till he has read this&mdash;CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>September, 5th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to tell you about our great effort on Thursday last. We
went to Canterbury as I told you, and there met a great company of
old pilgrims of long ago who had come from far spheres to be guides
to us newcomers, all because they had such love of their old
country.</p>

<p>"I was very impressed with the company I was in, for they had
been far from earth and were wonderful spirits some of them. They
were all so full of love of all, though, that one felt a friend in
them all. I can't describe it in words, but I think you understand.
I was just a beginner and knew nothing, but they all seemed so
welcoming and friendly. We prayed in the Cathedral, and the light
simply poured out all over us, and it was all connected with
ancient history of the past. I can't explain, but it all seemed
there together from the time Canterbury was first a place of
pilgrimage till now&mdash;all the history of our country came into
it in some mysterious way, and I seemed to see England as a sort of
living person with us all being bits of that person past, present
and future, all making one. I can't really put it into words, but I
can see you grasp my meaning, Mum. Now I want to make you see what
they want us to do. It is a great task for England, and now the
time has come. I can't quite explain as it is all in spirit not in
human words, but your part is just what you are doing now only more
in prayer if you can, Mum darling. It was made so plain there about
that.</p>

<p>"I want to say one thing more and then I must go as there is
more to do to-night. Tell Dad we are going to be over here quite a
long time, so I can come to help his work as I promised. I can't
tell you much about what we are to do, it is all spiritual work
which I don't yet understand, but I am learning, and my work in
path-finding has already been a help as I have learnt something
about guiding thoughts. You will see the effect by more people
believing in our life and trying to talk to us&mdash;that is what
we are helping with and working for, and that is where you come in,
Mum darling. Now I must go, but I shall be here again several times
in the week I expect now.</p>

<p>"So long, Dad&mdash;from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>September 8th. (Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, celebrating the
surrender of Italy.)</i>
</p>

<p>"I was listening with you and Dad&mdash;I am so happy to listen,
shall we talk afterwards, Mum darling?"</p>

<p><i>After the symphony.&mdash;</i>"Yes, I agree, this isn't so
good, it seems disjointed and doesn't hang together like the
other&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why are they all so excited, Mum?...O I see, that's a jolly
good show. I never thought they'd crumple up so soon. I'm awfully
glad because it will end the war much sooner than expected.</p>

<p>"I can't catch your thoughts, Mum?...I haven't much to say
really. We are working in London mostly, and opening minds to
receive our messages, but I can't manage much of it yet, it is too
specialised for me at my stage, so I just hang about trying to find
openings I can help a bit. I say, Mum, I'm awfully bucked over this
news, it is grand and will shorten the war by years, I imagine. I'm
so pleased to have been with you to-night to hear it&mdash;It's
great!...No, Dad, I wasn't really depressed, only Mums sensed my
feeling a bit at sea over my new work, it is a bit beyond my
present powers, I think."</p>

<p><i>September 12th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Chris&mdash;yes, I've come for my Sunday talk, Mum dearest, you
are so happy to see me.</p>

<p>"I want to try to give you some idea of our new work which is so
very important. I feel very priviledged to be allowed to join these
great spirits who are working here in England. You see they know
that English-speaking people are to rule the world and bring new
knowledge of GOD, so they are keen to help our race to see the
right way to work, and that way is by understanding thought power
and influencing men inwardly. I can't help with that yet, of
course, because I am only quite a beginner, but I begin to see how
it is done, and it is so important to teach people how to think
rightly and to send out light instead of only drawing in to them
selves all the time&mdash;I want so much to be able to help in
this, so I am going to try my hand at the people you are in touch
with, because you give out so much light that I can see their minds
by your light."</p>

<p>R. <i>"Light up your work by prayer, my boy."</i></p>

<p>"Yes, darling, how high your thoughts are&mdash;I am always
forgetting I can get light through prayer.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I sit awhile and just think?
<i>(Pause)</i>...</p>

<p>"I would like to tell you something I saw in my work in Sicily
with out troops. It was on our side of a hill and we were shelling
the enemy lines from the rear&mdash;our troops were crawling on
their hands and knees in the grass of the hill to carry it by
assault, and one fellow had his musket on a sling round his neck so
that his hands were free. Suddenly he saw a German just ahead and
he couldn't get his musket out to fire, so he went for him with his
bare hands and caught him a whack with the butt of the gun which
knocked him sideways. I was watching them both and laughed at the
sudden way he did it, but they hadn't time for any more when a
shell burst close by and they were blown to bits. I picked the
Tommy out of his body, but the Hun I left to someone else. I've had
enough of trying to help Huns, and thought someone more experienced
could do it this time. The Tommy grinned when he saw me and said
'Hullo, youngster, what are you doing here?' So I said 'I've come
to help you'&mdash;and he grinned more and said 'Run home to your
Mammy, you're in a dangerous place here.' So I tried to explain
that it wasn't dangerous any more to either of us, but he would
have it that it was, and couldn't believe he was dead. He thought
the shell had been close, but that he had miraculously escaped. I
couldn't make him understand until I went off up in the air, and
then he was so thunderstruck he just gaped at me&mdash;and began to
take notice of what I said. He was awfully jolly afterwards, and I
took him to see his family, and he was so interested in trying to
get them to understand what he wanted to say. They hadn't heard yet
that he had been killed, and he wanted his wife to know it was
alright to soften the shock when she heard. I left him trying to
speak to her&mdash;(Music) Yes, let's listen&mdash;it's
lovely!"</p>

<p><i>September 17th. (Music on the wireless.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, Mum, I was listening to it too. I am coming more often now
as I told you, but we needn't talk always. I love to sit with you
and Dad and be at peace"&mdash;<i>(Pause).</i></p>

<p>"I wanted to say that I consider myself one of the happiest of
all people to have such a peaceful spot to come and rest in. I have
seen more of other minds lately than ever before, and I am so
overwhelmed with the maze of contradictory ideas and beliefs and
the atmosphere of useless worry and criticism of other people's
ideas and beliefs and altogether amazing restlessness. I hardly
know what to do for them and find my new powers quite unnervingly
small to cope with it all...O Mum, darling, you are too great for
me, I can't do your way. You seem to think we can be powerful with
GOD's power. I can see your power in prayer like that, but I can't
see how to act on it...I'll try, Mum, darling.</p>

<p>"Now I can't stay long because we are awfully busy&mdash;but I
want to tell you that I am trying to help all I can in MARY'S ARMY
of help for mothers&mdash;your work, darling. I am going now,
good-bye."</p>

<p><i>September 19th (written in a Quarry, Werrington,
Stoke-on-Trent.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Coming to such a lovely place&mdash;What did Dad say?"</p>

<p><i>(Dad&mdash;"How does he see rocks?")</i>
</p>

<p>"I can't tell you really, Dad, because you can't use your eyes
properly yet. When you can you will see rocks inside out, so to
speak. Whirling mists of atoms controlled by the force of gravity
and making gigantic efforts to escape, so that the etheric force
contained in rocks is far greater than in loose earth or water. I
can't explain better than that. I am thrilled to be here with you
because it is such a place of conquest of man. You haven't got my
meaning, Mum. This place has been used for building men's houses
since early British days, and used to be quite a mountain, but it
has been quarried for thousands of years until nearly used up, and
there are impressions left of all those early men who made their
houses and forts round here. I can see history stretching back from
here for ages. It makes a place so wonderful to see it as I do now
with all its past impressions still left visible from our
side...No, I don't see any fairy life here as there is at Cox's
Mill. I think it has always been rather fierce and wild here, and
the men who lived round here were a rough wild sort of people,
never very cultured but awfully fierce and given to fighting
between themselves. I am so glad to come here to-day though, to see
it all like this.</p>

<p>"Dad says I must be quick so we'll go on later, indoors,
Mum&mdash;but it is such a lovely day I want to see you enjoying it
too..."</p>

<p><i>Later, indoors. (On our way home Dad talked about ghosts, and
C. said: "I can tell you about that.")</i>
</p>

<p>"I only thought it might be a good opportunity now that you are
so quiet, and I heard you tell Dad you hadn't many letters to-day.
I think Dad likes me to tell you things about how this life
impinges on yours, such as ghosts and hobgoblins and elves and such
like. They are all part of life in the etheric world, which is not
spiritual at all and which is fully visible to me now, though I
never saw a glimpse of it before. I haven't studied the subject,
but I believe ghosts to be connected with past events such as the
relics of the past I told you about this morning. They come where
vibrations have been badly disturbed and have gone askew so as to
make a sort of gap through which they appear in your life. It isn't
a real appearance, you see, only the effect of what happened at
another time. You see, it is all there all the time&mdash;the past
I mean&mdash;only sort of screened off by your sense of time which
makes the past gone away, so to speak. But the real people who made
that appearance have long ago gone to other spheres&mdash;only the
picture of what happened is there, if you can grasp that&mdash;I
know I couldn't have thought of it at all in my earth life. I don't
really know much about it yet, but will find out if you like. Dad
is so scientific, he likes to put these things into their
scientific aspect."</p>

<p><i>Evening.</i>
</p>

<p>"This is so nice, Mum, to get you quiet at last! I want to say a
few words if I may about my opinion of what you and Dad were saying
as to the fairies.</p>

<p>"I don't think they have the powers that Scots peasant people
credit them with. I think that is old superstition from the days
when fear governed almost everything and the ancestors of these
people were guided by fear in all their beliefs. They had glimpses
of that etheric life and didn't understand what it could be and so
their fear made it seem terrible to them. I have never seen any
interference with man's life by the fairy world, but they can use
plant life for their homes. They seem nearer to the vegetable world
than the animal somehow, yet they are more like the animal or human
world in appearance. They are very varied, all sorts and
kinds&mdash;like people only tiny, or like...<i>(an
interruption).</i></p>

<p>"Now we can be quiet again and I'll go on telling you about
fairies. Some are quaint shapes like star-fish or cockle shells
only not made of shell but flesh, and some have queer gnome-like
faces like the seven little dwarfs in Snow-White, and some are
little flame-like lights which hardly have a form at all, but are
lovely colours. I am deeply interested in finding out how they
live, but they can't see my life at all, only yours, and I don't
know how much they see human beings because all I have seen have
been entirely occupied with the plant world. Plants have etheric
forms which are in the same plane as the fairies you see, and I
think animals are spirit, not etheric&mdash;I don't quite know what
words to use, for etheric might mean my sort of life too, but it
isn't in my life though plainly visible to me. I can be in contact
with their plane, and do things with it if I want to but they can't
be in my plane. It seems more confusing to you than it really is
when you get here.</p>

<p>"Mum, darling, I want just to give you an idea of my music. I
was playing this morning, and when I saw your mind I could see a
sort of picture of me playing in it so you must have heard me
really. I think you aren't quite able to be conscious of what your
spirit hears yet. Now I want to try to interest Dad again, because
he likes me to be scientific over my new experiences.</p>

<p>"Dad, I want some experiments to try to find out how houses get
haunted. I think I know the reason, and want to see if I can
influence a ghost to disappear altogether, then if I succeed I
shall be able to explain what they are made of. They are not
spirits, I can tell you that much already, but I think they are
dispelled by mind forces and I want to try it out. Can you tell me
of a genuine haunted house?...</p>

<p>"Mum, I've got the house at Edenbridge. I remember seeing it as
we went past in the car. Is it really haunted or is it only an idea
because some suicide happened there?</p>

<p>"Now I think you ought to stop, Mum, so I'll say
Good-night&mdash;Love to Dad&mdash;CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>September 26th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I would like to tell you what I saw in the morning when you and
Dad were out on that jolly walk&mdash;I so much enjoyed it. I saw a
big creature like a balloon in the clouds, with great bulging sides
and fins rather like a monstrous fish only in the etheric world,
not in yours. It was rolling over the cloudbanks, and over and over
it went faster than one would have thought possible for a live
thing, but I don't know what sort of life it has, for it isn't the
same as the fairy life, I'm sure, and not in spirit life either. I
watched it for a long time, fascinated by its gambols, like a
clumsy giant playing at gym. I can't understand what life it
belongs to yet, but there are so many planes of being all
interwoven with each other that I expect I haven't come across all
of them yet. I must try to find out...</p>

<p>"Can I say another thing I saw a few days ago? I was working in
a tunnel where they wanted help because a man was killed there, and
I saw a wonderful growth of luminous moss on the sides of the
tunnel glowing out like a greenish light all along.</p>

<p>"I would like one more word about my work now. I am getting very
keen about helping minds because they respond so easily in this
country, and I feel I am really able to do some good at last. I
wanted so to help my country, and now I've found the best way to do
it. I take a message from one of their people they love who are
here and tell them in their minds, and then I see a thought of that
person reflected in their mind and the message comes into their
consciousness. It is so wonderful to see it all happening, and it
makes me very happy because they get a happy thought of one they
love which helps them to bear the time of being parted from
them...</p>

<p>"Now, Mum, we must stop writing, and let Dad see this will you?
Night night, Mumsie..."</p>

<p><i>October 5th, 1943, afternoon. (At Dallington.)</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to tell you a bit about my work. I was a glider pilot to
see what it was like, on my way here from Stoke where I had been
working. I stopped at an aerodrome in the vicinity of Northampton,
and there were gliders being towed and shot off, and I went in one
and enjoyed the sensation of being taken in an effortless way
without noise of engines. I said I <i>was</i> a pilot because I
enjoyed it in his mind, so to speak. You see, the noise of engines
only affects me as it affects the minds which are jarred through
their bodily senses&mdash;I can't be jarred because I hain't got no
senses now! Can't be jarred in that way, but plenty jarred by other
worse things like awful thoughts of disgusting selfishness and
cruelty. I was over-turned on landing, though, and I think my pilot
was hurt. He was a novice at it and learning, I expect.</p>

<p>"How do you like your new name? Of Mumsie? I think it suits your
nature better than Mum, which is rather prim and pursed up. You
haven't a prim nature, and Mumsie is softer and sweeter."</p>

<p>(R. <i>"I love it."</i>) I am so glad you love it, for I love it
too. I am going to have a prowl round before your tea&mdash;let's
come&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Evening. (His Father had asked what difference he saw in our
day and night.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Can I have a few moments now, Mumsie mine? I want to try to
tell you what Dad was asking, about day and night. I am in light of
cosmic rays which are not coming from the sun at all but are
filling all space with a glory of colour and beauty such as earth
eyes can't see or earth minds grasp at all. The suns are like
glowing focus points of this light, which sets them in motion by
attraction of atoms to other rays, and earth light is the result of
this motion which generates heat and gives out what your eyes see.
All space is light to our organs of vision, and I am not sure where
the cosmic rays come from&mdash;what source, I mean&mdash;but they
are so beautiful that nothing you can think of can compare with
it.</p>

<p>"Your night is just like your day except that the activity
ceases and thought-forms come rising up from sleepers who are
longing to meet some of us. We greet them and they respond, but
their human selves don't remember this when they wake. Tree and
plant life is different, too, because they depend on the sun's rays
for their growth, and they go to sleep when the sun is cut off. But
it is all the same in our life, only we see the changes in yours. I
only need rest of mind, never rest of body now, so I never need to
be in darkness for my seeing apparatus never gets tired, only my
willing powers do when I have worked for some time. I long to show
you the colours here in the light of cosmic rays. Now I think we
ought to stop. Night night from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>October 6th (afternoon). (Sitting under a tree in a
wood.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>R. felt Christopher saying: Try to SEE, Mumsie."
(Writing)</i>
</p>

<p>"You are too self-conscious, Mumsie. I wanted you to see the
forms of the tree-sprites on the thick edge of that
birch&mdash;they are grouped in little bands and bringing moss
fibres to their underground home in the roots. Look again at the
birch in front of you...They live in the roots, and are comical
little forms like gnomes only green all over, and one doesn't often
get a chance of seeing them, but...Yes, Dad, you cut off our mind
link by talking, but I get your idea&mdash;they are pointed heads
and woolly backs all mosslike and very quaint faces. Now I'll be
off, see you later."</p>

<p><i>Evening. (During our afternoon drive home R. felt C. coming
and going from the car several times.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Can we make a regular time to talk so that I shan't come when
you are busy?...All right, I'll see when you are ready down there.
I can't tell clock-time except by seeing minds and thinking it, but
I'll look out for yours. Can we talk a bit now? I want to explain
my many flittings to and from your car to-day. I was parachuting
off the clouds to see if I could land plumb on a moving target like
your car, and I hit it off pretty well, but I had to use will-power
once or twice, which wasn't really in the bargain. I was up to
pranks over the collecting of my parachute, which I made out of
etheric colour forms of human thoughts, making them into a woven
tissue of colours like a balloon only far more beautiful. Naughty,
school-boy pranks, not edifying for a grown man like me!"</p>

<p><i>October 7th. (At Cox's Mill.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Am I punctual? Sure, on the hickory-dot! You've collected a
cat, Mumsie. It's little heart is full of gratitude and relief.
It's had a bad time, I can see, of loneliness and hunger, and they
feel so helpless without human aid. I love cats, they aren't really
so cruel as they seem, for they don't give pain for pleasure as it
looks like, only out of ignorance of what pain is.</p>

<p>"I see so much of the beauty of ancient days here, calm lovely
forest trees weaving their placid charm all round. I am
rhapsodising and must not waste your time! I want to tell you
something Dad will be interested in. I went to Battle on the bus,
just for old times' sake, and I saw how they manipulate camouflage.
They were doing a big lorry with dollops of green and brown and
black all over it, but it wasn't good enough so they splooged a big
drag-net over it to make it all into smears and streaks and looking
exactly like a bog with rushes growing in it. Jolly cute, I
thought. I'm still interested in earth things, you see, not a high
spirit yet, as Lancelot would say! And I don't want to get on too
fast and have to leave Cox's Mill just yet!...Of course, I'll have
to get on, I was only mostly in fun, Mumsie!</p>

<p>"I think you'll like to hear how I see Mrs.&mdash;. She is a
very motherly person with rather queer ideas about other lives. She
is so content with this plane that she doesn't trouble her head
about going on at death or anything you think so much of. Her
thought-colours are quite custardy&mdash;I mean, thick like
custard, not clear and radiant&mdash;and she produces only small
thoughts in rapid succession from her preoccupation with household
and practical details. You couldn't do much with her however long
you talked, so it would be a waste of your time.</p>

<p>"I am so happy here, just to roam around and enjoy the place.
Yes, we'll talk again tomorrow.</p>

<p>"Your own boy, CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>October 8th.</i>
</p>

<p>" I must say, you are very quiet to-night, no bustling round
with visitors, and time to talk to me&mdash;important ME,
Mumsie!&mdash;I want to tell you a story of a mouse, it was caught
in a trap and died, and it had a baby family, so it was terribly
upset and worried, but it had no power to intervene and help them.
So one by one the babies came to it in this life, and I watched the
mother gather them in as they came, getting happier with each one,
and so happy now they are all together again. She is nursing them
at this moment in a beautiful nest she has willed for them, and
crooning over them with joy. I was so touched by that little mouse
mother and her fears all ended.</p>

<p>"Can you breath a little more deeply with longer breaths? I
think I can take more power for writing when you do. Yes, it seems
to exhale more psychic power then, I can't tell you why.</p>

<p>"Now I've got another story, this time about myself. I wanted to
spend a few hours at the sea, so I went off to Pevensey Bay and sat
on the beach and saw a submarine come in close to Pevensey. They
were all on deck and looking so happy to be nearly home again. I
don't know where they had been, though I went on board to find out,
but they were all so full of getting safely back that all their
thoughts were for home.</p>

<p>"I was so glad to be on a beach again and wanted to throw stones
in the sea, but had to be content with mind stones which I threw
with great effect! I am silly still, you see, and very fond of
earth things.</p>

<p>"I want to tell Dad that his mother has been to see me. I was
away on my work a week ago when I heard I was wanted at our
headquarters, and there she was to see me&mdash;and colours of gold
and green, lovely to see. I had not remembered her till then, but I
can now. I was quite tiny when she died, I think. She is lovely and
serene, and very calm and orderly in mind, with great love for Dad
and her other sons. I forgot to tell you that before&mdash;it was a
few weeks ago I think. I am to work in memory training soon,
because I find I forget things like earth life, whereas one ought
to have memory for every-thing here, but I am rather deficient in
some ways and must try to develop more all round...I am not so
selfish now, so that is something...Mumsie, you are tired, so we
must stop. I'll stay till nine and then say good-night and go."</p>

<p><i>October 9th (During the first part of this letter C. was very
restless, and R. felt he had something on his mind, which came out
when he told R. of the raid with a burst of emotion she could
plainly feel)</i>
</p>

<p>"You are very late, Mumsie&mdash;never mind, we'll have a little
chat...I tried letting myself slide down a cloudbank, but it was
too soft and featherbedy, so I went off to Mary L&mdash;, but she
isn't at home now. Then I wandered off looking for old
friends...Mumsie, you are very uncomfortable and we seem
interrupted all the time. Now, can I have your mind a bit to
myself? I was telling you all my morning doings, but you weren't a
bit interested. I am off on duty again soon, so do let's make the
most of this time when you aren't busy...I was over Brightling
Beacon to-day and saw squadrons of planes going over the Channel
out to the French coast, I suppose. I only stayed a few minutes to
watch them and came back here thinking you'd be waiting for me, but
not a sign of it." <i>(Here</i> R. <i>passed his first sheet of
paper to Dad, saying: "He has said nothing very much.")</i></p>

<p>"Nothing very much when I've been telling you all my doings!
Naughty Mumsie." <i>(With an effort)</i> "Now for a splash of
colour on the canvas. I went last night to see a raid on Germany
and was horrified at it all. I never imagined such ghastly fear as
came surging up all round me and nearly stifled me with its
gruesome terror. I wasn't going to say about that because it
shocked me so much, but you wanted to hear something more so I'll
tell you it was awful. Our men in the planes were concerned only
with dropping their loads and getting away, but I saw a lot more
than they did, and the lurid fear colours coming up from below were
so awful I couldn't stick it. I cried to God to stop it." (<i>A
sound of distant guns.)</i> "I'm off to see what that is."
<i>(Later)</i> "I don't want to talk except to say that I'm back
from a jaunt I'll tell you of to-morrow, very exciting. To-morrow
will be best, in the morning before you go out. Good-night, Dad and
Mumsie."</p>

<p><i>October 10th, morning.</i>
</p>

<p><i>"You</i> arranged this time last night. I have been waiting
for recognition and getting impatient." <i>(His father gave me a
piece of apple.)</i> "Now, Mum, I can't write when you're eating,
it takes your vibrations off me! I wanted to tell you about my
adventure yesterday in a submarine. I went off to find out about
the firing you heard and it was off the coast out at sea, so I went
along to look for the object and it was a Hun submarine attacking a
boat of ours with torpedoes. I saw them surface for a moment to see
what they had done, and I made a dive for them before they
submerged and got on board. They were a sorry-looking crowd. I
never saw such depressed minds, all out of gear, somehow, and
wanting to be done with it all. I shouted orders to the commander
to make port again and he looked so startled that I think he heard
me, but he didn't obey because I could see that they were putting
out for the Atlantic. I remembered the...and felt quite revengeful!
But I couldn't do anything to stop them beyond giving their minds
an extra push towards wanting to give up and go home. I was awfully
sorry for them really because they seemed to have no fight in them
at all. Then I slipped away and left them because I thought of home
and you might be wanting me. I shall be off to-morrow back to work,
so I want to be along with you all afternoon and on the terrace as
you said. Till then&mdash;so long."</p>

<p><i>Afternoon.</i>
</p>

<p>"Can I tell you of a chance encounter of mine with a
cow&mdash;yes, a <i>cow,</i> Mumsie, horns and hoofs and tail! I
was prospecting with you and Dad for mushrooms and enjoying myself
when I saw a cow in etheric life, who had lived in that field in
her body. She had made herself an etheric body just like her old
one because she had no ideas beyond that, and she was just grandly
happy thinking of sunshine and grass and cowslips or something
yellow that she liked. I don't think they have any feelings beyond
that sort of thing, and forgot all about their calves when they go
away. Mumsie, why are you so sleepy to-day? You keep almost going
to sleep. Shall I wake you up with an exciting tale? Must it be a
true one, or shall I invent? " <i>(If you invent, please tell me
so.)</i> "I must stick to truth if I have to tell you. Now for my
tale of a bubble which burst...It was a mosaic of colours far more
beautiful than any you know, and the fairies were playing with it
on their knees&mdash;from one to another they threw it, till the
last one dropped it and it burst. I saw that just now down by the
water when you and Dad were looking at the dragonfly.</p>

<p>"It is the happiest evening of my time here. I wish you could
see it all with my new sight, everything visible, even the tiny
sparks of fairy flame on the moss and grasses. It is so unendingly
beautiful, and your feeling of beauty is only a small beginning. I
realise now how insignificant our life here is, and how much we
have to train for the future. I see more of fairy life here than
anywhere, and it is so good because they bring etheric influences
which are soothing to human minds if open to nature. Tell Dad the
fairies I saw playing with the bubble were sitting on the
water-weeds in the pond. I don't specially want to talk any more,
so you get your chores done and I'll be happy loafing around.
Good-bye till next time, from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>October 16th (at Stoke-on-Trent).</i>
</p>

<p>"Let me tell you about my doings during the past week. I have
been mixing with a strange crowd lately under Uncle Toby's
directions and with his approval. They are unwilling spirits who
won't believe in spiritual ways because they want earthly pleasures
so much, and they are impeding our progress in the crusade, so
something had to be done about it. I contrived to mix, unperceived
by them, among their gatherings and overheard their plots of
mischief against us, for they want to persuade human
people&mdash;those still in their bodies, I mean&mdash;to give them
attention at sances and gatherings so that they can boast of
influence towards earthly things. I was bent on counteracting their
machinations, so I went to a sance, too, where the medium was to
be controlled by an earth-bounder, as we call them, and it was an
awfully close and heated atmosphere because the sitters were all so
excited in an unhealthy way and come for sensation only. I was
interrupted in my possible help to them by the force of cruelty
which one of the sitters generated and which nearly suffocated me,
but I managed better with a younger one who hadn't been there much,
and made him feel very uncomfortable to be with such people at all.
The medium was a coarse sort of woman with an eye on the money side
of the business and I couldn't do much with her, but she heard my
remarks on the sort of society she was encouraging all right, and
she didn't like me one bit.</p>

<p>"She said, 'Ahem&mdash;there is a mesmeric force present which
is obstructing the free manifestations of the presiding spirits,
who are anxious for us to concentrate against it. Now let us
concentrate on the collective manifestations we have usually
expected on these occasions'. These 'manifestations' were too
silly, bangs on the table and hoots and hocus-pocus of all sorts. I
grinned at being described as a 'mesmeric force'! Uncle Toby says
it is quite all right for me to do this work because none of these
earth-bounders have any power really beyond their silly bangs and
hoots at sances, and he told me to keep my mind on our Crusade for
the Truth and I couldn't come to any harm. It made me rather sick,
though, because their thoughts were all so lurid and hot and fusty.
Can I say one more adventure which is very funny&mdash;I was
working on a mind of an old man who is soon to come here and trying
to make him think a bit higher, when he turned over to his nurse
and said, 'I can't think what is coming over me, I seem to be
thinking all goody-goody now. It's a queer feeling for an old
sinner like me, but I dare say it won't do me no harm to be a bit
pie for a change.' I chuckled at his queer way of putting it.</p>

<p>"I'll go off and see if I can find Lancelot, so I'll say
goodnight."</p>

<p><i>October 19th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Can I give you a message from Uncle Toby to say will you be
away at Christmas or here?" <i>(Here, darling.)</i> "All
right&mdash;we've got a Christmas party we're planning, so I'll
arrange it for here. Going off now&mdash;so long."</p>

<p><i>October 24th (12 noon)</i>
</p>

<p>"I came for your walk, but you and Dad haven't gone out this
morning." <i>(We are going for a walk with some friends this
afternoon.)</i> "Oh&mdash;where to?...I'll stick to the car till I
see where you are and then go to bathe in the upper air till you're
ready."</p>

<p><i>Evening: (</i>R. <i>got a better pencil).</i></p>

<p>"You are fussy, I can write with anything you can hold, for I
only touch you, not the pencil.</p>

<p>"I had a super colour scheme to-day on the banks of clouds above
the storm you saw&mdash;it was a rain-bow of quadruple bars with
ultra violet colours which you can't see all in between, so lovely
and grand like a Beethoven symphony. I can't tell you how grand
colours are when you hear as well as see them, and music when you
see as well as hear it. It is FULL LIFE, which you don't even begin
to think of yet. Mumsie, darling, I wish you could come here, but I
mustn't want it before your time. I was basking in the rainbow
colours when I saw you and Dad buzz off in your car and followed to
see where you went. They are very nice people, those you went with,
and have most loving thoughts of their babies. I was so glad to be
introduced to them by you.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you a bit of life which you don't see yet. I was
interested in the fungus foray for old times' sake, and then I made
a discovery. The little people have made medicines out of the
fungus spores, and when they get hurt they find one of the right
sort to live under until the spores heal them. I was watching a
group of gnomes carrying one along who had a bad injury, and he was
dumped under a fungus which had black spores and began to turn over
and over in the black dust which seemed to soothe his pain. I don't
know how they get hurt but they seem to be quite as vulnerable as
human bodies. Then further on I saw some more under a dull-coloured
fungus and they seemed to be hurt ones, too, so I gathered that it
was some kind of curing going on. It interests me to see how they
carry on their funny life, which is so like us yet so much lower
and more primitive&mdash;and all with plants, so far as I can
see.</p>

<p>"I want to make a larger instrument to play on. I hear that
there are tones of sound beyond those I can hear even now, and a
larger instrument might touch some of them. I don't know yet if
this is possible, but I should like to try...Yes, I saw Lancelot a
few days ago, and I meant to tell you about it but forgot. We had a
talk, and he told me he is working in our crusade now, but from a
higher plane than mine and in a way I can't yet understand. We
shall meet a few times off and on, I hope, and I'll tell you when
we do."</p>

<p><i>October 26th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I just want to tell you I am going overseas again on Uncle
Toby's orders to join a platoon of organisers of glory. You can't
understand what I mean, but it is a great bit of our work for the
war, to help those who see the gloomy side only, and we try to give
them a new view of what it looks like to us. I'm afraid I can't
explain any better in words, it is so etheric and not earthly. It
is a higher sort of work than I have yet done, so Uncle Toby
thought I ought to take the offer of joining this platoon. I leave
England Monday next so I shall be with you on Sunday as usual and I
shall be able to come over to you for rests often, so it won't be a
separation, only I was enjoying the feeling of helping your work. I
can come back to that later on, I hope, though. I would like to be
very close to you in mind at nine p.m. every evening, so will you
think of me just before Big Ben strikes and I shall see your
thoughts and be with you then. Good-night, Mumsie, darling, love to
Dad. Your CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>October 30th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I am so happy that you love me to come to you, not like
that queer woman you talked to this morning. Her mind is full of
queer ideas of taking away sins from people by belief in
Christ&mdash;she seldom thinks of mind belief but only going to
church.</p>

<p>"I want to be a bit introspective to-night and tell you what I
now realise." <i>(Do you want me to keep it private?)</i> "You can
tell anyone you like if it helps, Mumsie&mdash;I have got beyond
that now. Christ means more to me than I knew before. I have
realised that I am enlisted in a great army of His members, all in
Him and working with His Power. I mean to be a living member of His
Body, and He is our Head and Crown and Life. He is the force with
which we fight. Christ is our Life itself. I never had any idea of
this before I died, so it took a little time for me to assimilate
it, and I have now taken my oath of allegiance and am enlisted in
the Army of Light. I am glad you are so understanding of my words
mother, I am now an adult and have chosen my career, to serve in
the Army of Light which is His Body.</p>

<p>"Can I say a word now for Dad to interpret? I met a fellow
yesterday nearly blind, and he was unable to see because he had
been enveloped in business to such an extent that his spirit had
never grown. It was a bit of a shock to me to find that just
minding business could have such an effect, but he had thought only
on the earth plane and not given a blink of thought to anything
like beauty or spiritual values, so he was groping about unable to
see anything. I helped him to a rest centre where an experienced
guide took charge and told me he would have to be educated from the
very beginning. He was a grown man in earth life, too. I had no
idea before that people could stunt their spirits to such an extent
as that poor fellow.</p>

<p><i>November 7th, 1943.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I am waiting till evening when you have done your
chores. I know quite well that you have to do your chores, as we
called them in U.S.A.</p>

<p>"Can I tell you something about my new work? I am liking it ever
so much, it is simply wonderful and full of spiritual power which I
knew nothing of before. I am told what to do from a higher plane,
and this means always being lifted up above oneself, so to speak. I
have to be careful not to let my own thoughts get in the way, and
then when I receive the instructions I find the power of influence
comes into me and I can give it out to those we are trying to help.
It is a most wonderful feeling to be lifted into a higher world and
filled with such power to influence. I can't describe it, but you
know what I mean I can see. We go to the countries where the fear
is, where people have been brought low by starvation and terror of
war, and there where darkness is deepest we pour in light from
higher planes. I am so thrilled by the glory of going where need is
greatest with such power to help. I am not meaning that <i>I</i>
have power, but the power comes into us all. I am only a beginner
and very self-absorbed still, but now I can see what to do to help
and I feel able to get on in the right way&mdash;Christ is in us.
O, Mumsie, I knew you would love to hear it." <i>(Pause.)</i></p>

<p>"Can I tell you something I saw on my travels in the mountains
of Caucasus? I was on my way to find the home of a man who had just
come to us and wanted news of his family. I was going over the
mountains when I saw an avalanche of rocks cascading down a slope
on to a little hut where people lived, and I seemed to be told to
go there to help them, so I went near and there was an old man on
the ground with a broken back, and a girl bending over him crying.
I saw that he was due to die, so I went up and spoke to her, and to
my surprise she heard me and seemed thankful that I was there. I
think she thought what she heard was her patron saint she had been
praying to, but anyhow it comforted her. The old man was just dying
so I helped him out of his body and carried him to a nearby camp of
our people. He was unconscious because he wasn't awake in spirit
yet. I went to find the girl again and she had gone for help to
bring her uncle's body in, so left her and went on to my job. I was
so surprised to find she could hear me so easily, though, and she
caught my meaning though not in words.</p>

<p>"I think we ought to stop, Mumsie. Night-night to Dad and
Mumsie, from your son, CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>November 14th (evening).</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie mine, you are tired with too much work of body. I am
away so much now that I only got here a few minutes ago to find you
still at work. I'll tell you a story to cheer you up. It was on a
motor-boat that I saw a man dive overboard to save a kitten which a
wave knocked off the boat&mdash;and he picked it up by the tail to
take it back, he couldn't grab anything else, I suppose&mdash;and
the kitten was furious at being held by the tail and wouldn't go
near him after it, though he had done it to save it from drowning.
I was on the boat seeing after a mind-wave from someone who was
killed and his pal was on the boat, but I couldn't get a thought to
take him then because they were all thinking of the kitten. I never
knew such a boat-load, they had picked up some airmen who had come
down in the sea, and also men from a minesweeper which had sunk,
and the kitten was theirs. Just like our sailors to think more of
rescuing a kitten than a man's life. It was amusing to see the
indignation of the kitten, though. You are cheered up now, Mumsie,
so I'll tell you another story of a duck which had laid an egg and
couldn't wait to lay another but sat on one till it hatched. Then
she was very annoyed to have only one duckling, and waddled off to
the pond with it in high dudgeon. I was watching her mind working
over it and thinking how badly her brood had turned out.</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I am resting you by talking nonsense, I can see you
getting rested and cheery again. Let me go on rattling off little
anecdotes, they seem to rest your mind, and I love to help you.</p>

<p>"I was over Malaya&mdash;yes&mdash;a few days ago, and saw a
whole bunch of Japs arguing about malaria. I couldn't understand
their words, of course, but I could see their thoughts in essence,
so to speak. They were arguing that this illness was due to devils
in the swamps, which had bad breath and gave it off so that men got
ill from it. I was amused at their queer ideas."</p>

<p><i>(9 p.m. Pause for Big Ben and the Silent Minute.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Can we make a plan for Christmas, Mumsie? I want to be able to
give you a present of some new experience, and to do that you will
have to be very quiet and away in mind from your earth duties. I
can do it at any time, not on Christmas Day, but I want it to be a
Christmas present because I can't give you anything else now, you
see. You will try to keep a time when I can take you to see
something of my life? Uncle Toby thinks you can do it safely and it
will interest you ever so much. We have a party as I told you, and
it will take place in your little house, so be prepared." <i>(I
can't get cakes for them!)</i> "Of course, not cakes! But you will
have to prepare a bit all the same. I mustn't tell you any more
yet. I think we ought to stop talking, as you are tired to-night,
so good-night, Mumsie and Dad, from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>November 21st.</i>
</p>

<p><i>His father dreamt of Christopher and in the morning</i> R.
<i>heard</i> C. <i>say "I was with Dad then. Later he
wrote&mdash;</i></p>

<p>"O, Mumsie, you are full of niceness! So pleased about my
remark. I was only meaning that I came over that night and met
Dad's sleep-form, so he dreamt he saw me&mdash;but the dream was
all nonsense, only he knew he had seen me and that pleased me
awfully because so few people can know what their sleep-forms have
seen." <i>(What are sleep-forms?)</i> "I don't know but they aren't
like us&mdash;spirits have all left their bodies altogether.
Sleep-forms are a sort of creation of the spirit when not occupied
by earth things, I think. They are a part of the person's mind but
not the earth consciousness, and they come over to us when they
love someone here. Mumsie, you often come, but your soul is so
happy about us that you don't need to bring it into earth
mind...Dad is so able to see in dreams that I believe I could show
him my life in that way better than more direct. I'll try to make
him dream again and see if I can. Don't let him think he is going
to beforehand or his human consciousness will get in the way. One
has to get away from thinking humanly before one can get other
consciousness, that's why dreams are so mixed up, because human
ideas keep cutting in and mixing up the experiences of our
life."</p>

<p><i>November 28th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I must tell you what I am getting on with now&mdash;a piece of
mechanism of my own invention and fine for producing etheric music.
I am specially full of that just now with my new work, as I am told
music is a great source of powerful rays of healing, and will be
much needed in our work of bringing joy in where fear lives and
healing the fearing minds.</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I have another thing to tell you about. I can control
minds at a distance sometimes by will power, and I make
contributions to our work like that. It is a big effort, though,
and I don't always bring it off, but am trying to develop in that
way. We are hard at work, there is such a lot of fear in the world
just now. I find I have been chosen because I had such a hard fight
with fear myself, so I can help more than those who haven't been
afraid."</p>

<p>R. <i>can you explain your new work?</i></p>

<p>"I can't tell you much because you can't understand the
conditions of our life here, but I will give you an instance of our
help. I was working on a mind of a boy who had been fired at and
had got helpless with fright, and I gave him a glimpse of our life
as a picture in his mind. He began to look at it, and the courage
came to grasp his gun and go on in spite of the firing. He knew
that there was something beyond what he could see, and got out of
his fear. I can't make you grasp my meaning altogether, but that
was the effect of it.</p>

<p>"Now for an anecdote of considerable interest to Dad, I hope. I
came across a fine magnolia tree in a garden near home, which had
evergreen leaves and seeds, great pods open with coloured seeds
like you are seeing in your mind. I was struck by the pods and
seeds and didn't know they grew so big in England. While looking at
it, I saw a creature in etheric life on the branches, like a man,
only green like the tree, and he was making faces at me so I think
he could see me. Most of them don't see our life at all, but he
evidently knew I had spotted him and didn't like me for some
reason. I couldn't make him understand my mind, though, and they
don't seem to have much mind power. He had a very pointed head and
face like a beak, and clung to the tree with hands and feet like a
monkey. I crept round to make him get off his perch, but he
suddenly scampered away as hard as he could, so I didn't pursue him
any further.</p>

<p><i>(Later.)</i>
</p>

<p>"O Mumsie, I make such a good companion, because I sit here and
never speak until you ask me to. I am a model of tact and
impeccability! Little boys should be seen but not heard, I was
told, but I am neither so I must be perfect!</p>

<p>"Our headquarters now are in London at Westminster Abbey where
many rays concentrate and we get inspiration from the past as well.
It is so interesting to see past as well as present, and they say I
shall see a bit into future too, soon, when I am more advanced. I
can't understand how it happens, but I come on by jumps. I seem to
pass some standard without knowing it and then another side of life
opens out which I didn't know before was there at all. I find it
very exciting and am thrilled when I suddenly begin to see more
than I could before. For instance, I now see people I had no idea
were near me at first, with most beautiful mind colours like
marvellous rings of light. They are all workers here on earth but
are in higher planes of work than mine. Uncle Toby could see them
long ago because he was so far advanced on earth and came here all
prepared for it...Can I see lower forms, you mean? I don't see much
of devils and such but I believe they exist, only lower minds are
too dark for us to see easily. I can't believe in a real Devil with
a big 'D', though, for I can see good everywhere, and he must have
very little power if he exists at all. Christ made that plain
really, only people won't believe in Him. Here we know He is our
Life and Mind.</p>

<p>"I must go, so night night to Mumsie and Dad, from your son
CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>December 5th, 1943</i>
</p>

<p>"Now let's talk about my doings. I went to a meeting of our
platoon commanders, and they decided to work in...Mumsie, you are
rather tired and can't get my meaning. They decided to work in
Russia. I tried to tell you the name of the place but you couldn't
get it. So I am back where I started after such a merry-go-round of
places of work. I went to a case of fear over there with one of our
guides, and he told me to keep the man's mind occupied while he
tried to divert the cause, which was a bad barrage of big gun fire.
So I told him ideas of his past, and he responded beautifully and
felt much better. The guide was pleased with my work and said I had
handled him well for my inexperience. Did I tell you a great
adventure I had in the week before? Being carried by aeroplane to
Africa in charge of a man's mind who was grappling with fear of
flying? He was a passenger on board and very jumpy, and I had to
keep telling him to stop it and be quiet, so he came over safely,
but it was all I could do to prevent him from jumping out half-way.
Well, I was so occupied with him that I failed to observe what was
happening to the others, and when we got out one of them had died
on the journey. I felt simply awful to have been sitting there with
this stupid frightened fellow when the other really needed help
most. He was in a coma, though, so all right.</p>

<p>"Just one more thing I want to say. I won't be able to be so
regular on Sundays soon because they want me to take a Sunday duty
on the patrol as they have so many boundary bandits to contend with
and can't spare many of us at a time. No, you don't understand, but
it's a bit hard to explain. We patrol the boundary between our mind
regions and the underworld of earth-bounders and they try to
penetrate our boundaries to damage the patients lately recovering
from death, so we patrol the boundary to keep them from interfering
and turning some of them to their underworld way of thinking. I
can't explain any better because it is all so new to your mind and
so different to what we used to think happened at death. It is just
as natural as everything else here really, and only seems strange
to you because you can't get away from earth ideas yet. Anyhow, I'm
wanted sometimes for Sunday patrol, so I'll come some other day now
and then.</p>

<p>"Now I'll say good-night to both my beloved parents like a
dutiful son...CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>December 14th. (At Dallington.)</i>
</p>

<p>"I was absolutely at sea as to where you had located yourselves
till I saw your flash just now. You never said you were going to a
new domicile altogether, so I buzzed off to old Mrs.&mdash;, and
then to Cox's Mill, and no one could show me where you were, so I
was just flat-bottomed out and in total darkness till you flashed
that message...</p>

<p>"Can I tell you something about my new work which I find so
enjoyable? I tell my boys I help to look for the correct way of
holding their heads up, and I see their minds concentrating on
attention to position when they might become afraid, so they lose
their fear in holding their heads as if they were courageous and
full of pluck. I find these little things help them more than
bigger thoughts which they can't grasp yet."</p>

<p><i>December 15th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Can we have a little cosy chat, Mumsie mine? I would like to
tell you how my new power of sight works, but it is impossible to
describe in your words. It works by my own volition, not
automatically as earth eyes do, but I can will myself to see over
miles of earth landscape and equally small...<i>(an
interruption)&mdash;</i>I can wait all right...That's better,
Mumsie, get a grip of my presence and we'll get on first-rate.</p>

<p>"I want to explain another most comforting thing, which is that
I find even the high spirits I am now able to see are quite human
in their ways, and want to laugh at their old selves and crack
jokes as though they were just old comrades come back from a
journey. I am so glad because I was afraid it would all be so grand
and stately and one would feel awfully shabby, but they are all so
friendly and good fellow sort of thing that I am quite at home with
all of them even from very high planes. It makes us all one family
in reality, as we ought to be on earth but never are.</p>

<p>"I must tell you of an encounter I had with a Hun on a plane
over the coast near here. He was flying very fast, having dropped
bombs on some ships and wanting to get away before our fighters
came at him. I was travelling in the opposite direction to get back
to you, and I saw him coming, so I slipped on to his plane and
whispered to his mind&mdash;'No good doing this, you're beat and
you know it'&mdash;and he swirled his plane round as if he thought
some other plane was after him. So I laughed at his panic and came
on here...I'm not very Christian yet, Mumsie, as you say! But they
are such nasty brutes, these Huns, and I always wanted to get at
them. I see you have things to do and I want to go and wander round
a bit. We'll talk again on Friday as I can't come tomorrow.</p>

<p>"Nightie-night from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>December 17th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Now I want to tell you a bit about my work which is possible to
put into human words.</p>

<p>"Can you understand a glorious light, like a bonfire only no
heat, just light? We light our torches from it and hold them high
in places where minds are dark and there is no hope of any human
help. There we go to light the hopeless minds and dispel the
darkness which covers them. They begin to hope and then waken to
the light, and we are there to cheer their drooping hearts and
lighten their darkened minds. I can't really explain our work, it
is not on human planes, but I am so grateful to be allowed to help
in such wonderful work as this.</p>

<p>"I must just tell you one thing more and then I must go back
till to-morrow. Clear rays of intense power come on us from some
high sphere, and we are filled with this and enabled to do our work
in that power, not our own. I cannot describe how full of strength
and power to help it makes even me when I receive this ray from
above. I must go now, Mumsie darling, and I have enjoyed this
little talk&mdash;more to-morrow, probably.</p>

<p>"Love to Dad from his son CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>December 18th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Give me your hand for a tiny talk and I'll tell you about an
adventure to-day. I went over to France and saw the German gunners
on the coast all working like mad to make big machines of which I
can't tell the use. They looked like gasometers or cylinders of
some kind and were quite as big as an ordinary gasometer for a
town. They are terribly hard at work over there, and I think
something is brewing, but I saw our reconnaissance planes coming
over, so expect they have reported it all right. I came back on one
of them, flying very low as he had been hit by an A.A. gun, I
think. The pilot was a bit off colour, too, but I think he got safe
back.</p>

<p>"...O, so this is our last talk here? Many thanks for a nice
holiday, so much enjoyed it all...Mumsie, you needn't mind for me,
I am happier than I could ever have been in earth life, and all is
well in real life. Love to Dad, from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>December 23rd. (At Stoke-on-Trent.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I want you to be very quiet and come over to me as far
as you can. I am near you and my face is..." (R. <i>felt a dim
outline of his face).</i> "Mumsie, I might touch your hand, I am so
close to you, and yet you don't really see me. Yes, I see you
realise where I am and see a dim outline but not the full me. I
must try again, and keep off telling you, as you get nearer when
you aren't trying hard to see.</p>

<p>"I am preparing a surprise for Christmas Day, and you will see
what you will see. It is much easier than to see me, which you
can't do yet, I fear. I know you are capable of it, but I must get
you off your guard, so to speak! Now I think we ought to get on
with our work, so no more till Christmas Day! from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>December 24th. Lancelot.</i>
</p>

<p>"Love to Mum and Dad on Christmas Eve from Lancelot. Coming to
your party to-morrow evening invited by Chris who is arranging it.
He wants me to come early, at six, to talk first, because I can
tune up your mind best to receive the company. It is to be a
surprise so I mustn't tell you who are coming, but quite a lot will
be there and you will hear news of all of us you love over here.
Darling Mum, I am so looking forward to it&mdash;at six to-morrow
evening. Good-night and HAPPY CHRISTMAS from Lancelot."</p>

<p><i>Christmas Day 1943, 5.40 p.m. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"My Mumsie, I was so excited that I had to come along first to
see if you were really expecting us all? I said to Lance that he
should come to tune you up, but I find you are ever so full of
expectancy too, so let's have a talk till the others come. A Happy
Christmas to my parents from your erring but loving son Chris.</p>

<p>"Darlings, you will hardly believe me when I tell you this is
the greatest Happy Christmas I have ever known. So far from
regretting the old festivity I used to enjoy so much, I just don't
want that kind of thing any more, and I am so closely joined to you
and Dad in love now that I never could feel lonely or out of
anything again&mdash;It's just RICH joy. Now I am master of
ceremonies, so must stop and introduce the company as they
arrive."</p>

<p>"Lancelot now, Mum ownest, I am SO GLAD you are so happy at our
party, and Dad is too, tell him please. I can be attendant to your
mind now, to keep you in tune for the next visitor."</p>

<p><i>(Personal messages were then written with my hand from eleven
different relatives of mine who had died during the past thirty
years.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>Later. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"Only a word Mumsie, then you must rest. Have you enjoyed your
party?" <i>(Yes, ever so much.)</i> "I am so glad because it was a
Christmas present from me to you, only I couldn't have done it
without a lot of help from Lancelot, who knows all these relations
of yours. Now I'll say nighty-night, and Lancelot will say a
word."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mum DARLING, I have so much enjoyed it all, and Chris has been
super&mdash;he likes me to say that! My best Happy Christmas EVER.
Dad is enjoying it too, which makes it so NICE.</p>

<p>"Good night, Darlings, from LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>December 26th. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"Now, Mumsie, shall we have a heart to heart tte-- tte
talk?...Of course I include Dad, but I mean not a party like
yesterday." <i>(I enjoyed it very much.)</i> "I'm so glad. I
enjoyed it too, and so I think did they all. They were most
complementary to me as organiser of it, though Lance did most of
the invitations. I only got Uncle Toby and my Grannies. I am so
happy it all went off so well and I gave Mumsie a treat for
Christmas!</p>

<p>"Let's see, what have I been doing? I went over to France again
to see those gasometer things, and our aircraft were over them
fairly plugging away with bombs. I saw one go down in flames, but I
don't know what happened to the others. The Germans were making
attempts to manipulate their A.A. guns but our aircraft moved too
quickly and I think most got away safely. I made out a bevy of
lorries loaded with petrol tanks or some such thing coming up which
were getting a hectic time of it, too. I think the Germans are very
despondent, for they seem so jumpy and on the run at any attack by
our planes. I nearly forgot to tell you that Uncle Toby said I was
getting on very well and he was pleased with my progress. I am very
proud when he praises me because he is very particular and hard to
please.</p>

<p>"I want to let you into a secret of my own and I can't express
it&mdash;you know the old feeling of being unable to tell anyone
what one really means? I must try to explain myself. I am aware of
much more now than I knew existed before, yet I still feel
unexpressed somehow, and want to do a big thing to get myself
expressed. I hope to find a work I can excel in soon. All I have
tried so far isn't quite my own work and I don't know what I really
need yet. I shall find out soon, I hope, but meantime I feel on
trial and not doing what will eventually be my own particular line
of work...I am in His Army, but it is my work in that I don't yet
know...</p>

<p>"May I tell you a bit of luck which came my way to-day? I had
left my instrument on our table in the headquarters and was able to
contact the caretaker by telepathy to send it me on will-power. You
see, we can send any etheric object by will-power, as it doesn't
have to be moved by physical jerks like your life. I was lucky in
contacting his mind so handily, as he might have been thinking of
other things, but he responded at once and sent it along." <i>(So
you have tables!)</i> "O yes, we have furniture all right, our
offices would be awfully bare with nothing. It is much more like
your life than you think, I believe. I would like to show you our
headquarters some day. I think you ought to stop now."</p>

<p><i>December 27th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Can we have a few words on prayer? I want you to help me to
understand how you pray, because I seem to have no mental force
like you send out when you think about God or Christ." <i>(That is
because I love God, darling.)</i> "I can't understand. I don't love
those I can't realise at all...Yes, I see a bit, but I can't rise
in spirit&mdash;I need to suffer more till I have to find Him, I
suppose...Yes, I see, so I seem a bit ungrateful not to love Him. I
don't want to be ungrateful but I find it very difficult." <i>(You
love beauty and music, and they are part of God, you thank Him in
your love of them.)</i> "I see, so I have been grateful after all.
I do love beauty and music. That makes things much clearer. I can
see now how to begin to love God, ever so many thanks, Mumsie
darling. I am nearly grown up now and can yet not understand what I
ought to have known as a small child. I am very backward in some
ways still, but I am getting on now.</p>

<p>"Dad would like to hear how I found a creature in the wood near
Cox's Mill the other day. I went off down there before Christmas,
and went into the forest where they had been clearing, and there I
found a creature in etheric life which had been inside the tree and
was turned out by cutting it down. It was a tree-elf of sorts, I
suppose, but it was not at all like the others I have seen&mdash;it
had...I'll try to draw it...Not very good, but it is something like
that. I can't make its limbs look real, but they were not so much
like legs or arms as like feelers or something else. He sat on the
ground looking most uncomfy because his tree had been cut down, and
I didn't know how to help him at all. He was brownish with a black
eye or something which looked like an eye, but I don't think it
functions in the same way at all.</p>

<p>"I mustn't write more to-night as it is the third evening in
succession for you and you mustn't be overdone, Lancelot says. So
I'll say au revoir till Sunday next, I shall be working again
to-morrow. Love to Dad from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>December 30th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I came to-day to tell you about instructions recently
given to our headquarters to be ready for a big development to
assist our work. It is a force of powerful spirits sending rays to
aid earth and concentrating them on England, from which the light
is to spread over the world. I am so proud to belong to England now
I can see the part we are destined to play in world development. I
am so glad you are to be surrounded by light of these rays so that
your work will be more effective than before. I shall be able to
help too in this great work, and it is a marvellous thing to be
doing.</p>

<p>"You want to say something?"</p>

<p><i>(You told us a few days ago that your instrument was sent to
you "on will-power" by the care-taker&mdash;why couldn't you will
it to come to you without contacting his thoughts?)</i>
</p>

<p>"You think I'm super strong! I can't do that yet, though I shall
be able to some day. But our office caretaker could send it more
easily because he got my mind waves to help too, it just needed his
added effort&mdash;two better than one, you see.</p>

<p>"I want to stop now&mdash;so good night, Mumsie and Dad, see you
Sunday probably. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>January 2nd, 1944.</i>
</p>

<p>"Can you hear me playing if you keep quiet? You must try now
I've tuned you up." <i>(Pause.)</i></p>

<p>"Yes, much better, but not real hearing yet. I think you want me
to talk more than you want to hear me play. Some day you'll hear my
instrument properly, then you will love it. I want to teach you to
hear me, so shall we try again? <i>(Pause.</i> R. <i>received an
impression of Christopher playing.)</i> "I see you received it
visually, not audibly, but you'll be able to do both later
on...</p>

<p>"I want to tell you how my instrument works, because you still
think of me as playing it by blowing&mdash;it isn't done like that
at all because there isn't any air to blow into it in our
life&mdash;well, I mean I can see your air but can't use it for
blowing. I gather harmonies by thought-pressure into a sort of tube
like a flute, but it is played by mental process, not by blowing or
fingers. I exert mind pressure in the direction of the harmony I
want and make the sound, following a score just like our books only
in another material, but the actual sound is made by mental
pressure into a tube which gathers the thought-forms. It is so
difficult to explain because you don't understand how we live at
all yet...</p>

<p>"May I tell you about my invention of a cloud carrier to waft me
along in upper air whenever I want to be extra luxurious? It is a
bed of soft cloud colours all mauve and grey and blue-grey which I
fold myself up in and am drifted along with the cloud in a lovely
soothing way. I have done it several times, but can't be always
lolling about while there is so much work going on. Yesterday I
careered over to Iceland to find a man I heard crying for help, and
he was full of fear about his aeroplane which he had to fly back to
this country in winter weather. So I gave him a picture of home and
made him want to get there so badly that he forgot to feel afraid
of what might happen on the way...</p>

<p>"I think we ought to stop writing now because you are getting
tired., and I'll be able to come another night soon. Your loving
CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>January 9th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I came all primed to tell you of an adventure, when you were so
engrossed writing that you never heard me! Well, I went over to
France again after my work, and saw a wreck off the French coast
lying in shallow water with her funnels out. I was interested to
see that this ship's cargo was still on board and no one attempting
to salvage it. It was a cargo of muskets of some new kind, I think,
but I don't know where to or from&mdash;she was a French boat, I
think, but I couldn't tell for certain. As I watched, the ship's
cat came up to me&mdash;she had been drowned and was so upset about
having lost her nice home that she had stayed on it trying to carry
on as usual, but began to be lonely because all the men had left
and no one came to pet her and give her milk, so she was ever so
glad to see me. I tried to explain to her that she ought to leave
the ship, but a cat's mind is so very tiny that I couldn't get the
idea into it. So I left her there and went ashore, and came upon a
heap of machinery which had been one of those gasometer things I
told you about. My goodness, our bombers have made a job of it
there! I couldn't recognise any part of it, all twisted wires and
only mixed bits of steel and concrete in a broken pile. All was
quiet at the time, no bombers just then, but they had done their
work well. I couldn't see any soldiers about either, and no one
seemed trying to repair the damage. Just then I saw a queer old man
come out of a hole in the ground, where he had been hiding, I
think; he took a long look at the wreckage and hobbled off in the
direction of some cottages in the distance. I think they were
smashed too, but still had walls standing. I felt sorry for the
poor people living in those parts, but it had to be done, of
course.</p>

<p>"Good night, parents dear, from CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>(Christopher's younger brother, David, arrived home from
America on January 10th.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>January 16th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I was busy all week working with my gang up in White Russia, so
I never went to see if I could find Dave's ship. Much surprised he
got here so soon&mdash;a successful voyage, I gather, not like
mine! My coming over here was all planned really, I know, but
humans would call it a calamity. I know better now, of course...Can
I say about my work, Mumsie? I am efficient in path-finding now, so
they are giving me jobs which need that very interesting and
slippery work&mdash;I mean slippery in a thought sense, you slip up
in tracking wrong bands of thought sometimes. You are so quiet in
mind to-day, Mumsie, I could explain more if you have time? I touch
a mind thinking of a soldier I am trying to help and they send out
a flash of recognition in his direction which shows him where they
are, then sometimes he slips along it safely and gets there, but
sometimes their mind closes in again so quick that he can't see his
way and I have to be there to get another signal from his friend or
relation. I can't get you to see it clearly, but that's how it
works.</p>

<p>"Can I tell Dave something he will be interested in? That radio
is coming over to us in waves of light. The waves used for radio
are visible to us as light-bands, and I can see messages being
transmitted by ships in visible form. I don't want to make him
envious, but he could do much more from our life here in that way
than he can on earth. I'm not gifted that way, but it seems to me
that radio is quite the nearest approach to our life yet made from
the earth sphere. I just can't get a grip of these wave-lengths,
but maybe soon they'll find one through which we can speak to make
our voices heard by you. Maybe Dave will be the man to invent a
gadget for doing this!...</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I want to tell Dave I came over here to be a guide to
the men who are killed in this war, because I so wanted to help win
the war and that is one big way...I want him to know the reason for
it so he won't think it was all just accident and misfortune.</p>

<p><i>(Later.)</i> "Mumsie, I am so interested in Dave's idea of a
lower frequency of wave-length, for I thought I was on a
short-length wave, but I couldn't make your vibration tune in to
mine, and I believe I could have stepped up a bit to tune in with
you instead. Now shall we talk of my adventures over in White
Russia? I was admitted to a college of light ray instruction, very
like Lancelot learned long ago. I am staggered at the amount there
is to tackle before one can be of much use to other people. You
see, we simply don't get the elements of it at our human schools
and our instruction really begins at the beginning when we come
over here. Well, I have forged ahead since we last talked and begin
to understand how to combat evil influences and help the fear in
the world. It is simply glorious to feel I have been chosen because
of my timidity in earth life to help this work of fear-fighting. I
feel so grateful to find my weakness turned to this great use. I
learned a lot of wonderful things about rays we don't use on earth
at all, and shall have to practice working them before I can use
them to fight devils with. Yes, we are up against real devils, but
they are all results of evil thinking. Most people can keep them
off easily, especially in England, because good thoughts are
prevalent, but in backward countries it is very bad. They get under
influence of these evil beings who make them imagine things to
frighten themselves, and that's where our rays help so much, we
give their minds a healthy impetus, and the devils are routed. It
is difficult to make you understand because your mind is so clear
and bright that no devil can come within your orbit at all...But in
Russia people are very dark in mind and we have a lot of work to do
there. I am keenly interested in this new line of instruction and
long to be able to use these rays intelligently, but I'm not so
good at that sort of thing as most. I was chosen for my victory
over my own fears, and that gives me sympathy with those we are out
to help and makes me give out a longing to help them which is
good.</p>

<p>"I must go soon, but I want to keep the Silent Minute, so think
of me then and I'll be with you." <i>(Dad said, "We like the photos
of you which David brought back</i>.") "All right, Dad, I'm glad
you think them good of me&mdash;can't send you any more yet, but
p'raps Dave will invent a way to take me with a multi-wave etheric
photo-plate or thereabouts! I must be off, I'm afraid, so leave you
and Dave to think out ways of snapping me!</p>

<p>"So long, family. Your loving CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>January 23rd. (At Cox's Mill.)</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to tell you another adventure of mine...I went on a
sharp bar of fear to help a man who was wounded and he had a leg
blown off by a shell or something, so I tried to find help for him.
He gave me a clue by his thought-wave as to the whereabouts of his
battery and I came upon his pal thinking of him, so I told him
where the man was and he was quite intelligent about it, but just
as they got him up another shell burst and I was just in time to
help them out of their bodies. The man whose wave I first saw was
afraid all the time but very plucky over fighting it and soon found
his feet at being freed. The other was non-plussed and unable to
understand what had happened. He had never thought about dying so
he didn't think it could possibly have happened, and I had great
trouble to bring him in to our camp, he just would not come, saying
he must go back to his gun. At last I had to let him go, but soon
heard his call for help as he found no one paid the slightest
attention to him any more. However, he is quite reasonable to deal
with now he has once realised his own death. I wish someone could
make them think a bit before they go out fighting, it is so much
easier to deal with those who realise they may be dead. I am
getting on fairly well in my work of fear-fighting, and it is just
the work for me...</p>

<p>"Now I must be off, so I'll just say au revoir and be with you
next week, Sunday probably.</p>

<p>"Dave, old boy, it's great to see you. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>January 30th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Hullo, Mumsie, I didn't expect you so soon and came for a
stroll in the pond where I can study the gnome life at its best. I
have been up to pranks of my own with the atmosphere on the pond. I
gave off fumes of mist in etheric life so the little people
couldn't see, and they got very fussed and set about making
shelters to hide in. I cleared it off by will-power, but they
wouldn't come out for a long time. I wanted to see how they acted
in emergency because I thought they were without powers of
reasoning, but I see they have some ideas of their own. They give
out so little thought that I wondered if they had any at all. I
think they are above vegetable life but connected with it somehow,
for they use nothing else. Animal life is beyond their scope
altogether.</p>

<p>"Dave, old boy...I would love to have you in my new life, full
of new sorts of things to do. I go up into upper air and float on
clouds with crimson glow of cosmic rays lighting them into
wonderful glory of colour, and then I shoot down like a rocket on
my volition energy to see Mumsie and you snugly sitting.</p>

<p>"Cheerio, darlings, back again later. I've got a call to answer.
So long."</p>

<p><i>February 7th, 1944. (David asked, "Is Chris sitting with
us?")</i>
</p>

<p>"No, I'm here sitting ON you! Not very heavily though because
you see I don't weigh anything! Poor little Chris doesn't weigh
anything! How are you getting on with your gadgets, Dave? I mean
lights and things, chiefly things like lights." <i>(You are very
frivolous this afternoon!)</i> "Why not? I'm awfully happy so I
just have to bubble a bit. Too good to talk, we'll do that
later."</p>

<p><i>February 13th. (At Stoke-on-Trent.)</i>
</p>

<p>"I am very amused at you for thinking I was wandering at Cox's
Mill trying to find you! As if I can't contact your thoughts by
this time from anywhere! Quite a new idea has come to me for my
work, which is still fear-fighting. I give my patient a power of
grasping hold of my hand with his etheric hand and it seems to calm
him wonderfully. I saw you do that yourself, Mumsie, when the raid
was on the other night&mdash;you grasped the etheric hand of your
angelic guide, and nothing would have been able to frighten you
then. I was so interested, because I have only just become able to
see your angel, I was not far enough advanced before."</p>

<p>R. <i>asked if C. would like to tell her something which would
provide "proof" that it was he who was talking to her.</i></p>

<p>"Cumulative evidence is best, and of that you have ample by now.
I am not confident of getting through material proofs because I
can't remember details of my earth life which would be sufficiently
convincing. I hope you won't want me to try, it is such a strain to
think of those sort of silly details.</p>

<p>"I'll go now, as you are tired, I can see."</p>

<p><i>February 14th. (Lancelot's birthday.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot.</i> "I have been having a great party of rescuers
for our work of fighting evil thoughts, and I carried out a gloom
dispersal&mdash;you can't understand, but I had great reserves of
force waiting to rush in when we lifted the gloom on evil minds and
they broke up the thoughts before they could do harm...</p>

<p>"Here comes Chris to keep my birthday. I told him this morning
to come along for my birthday treat so we could be together with
you and Dad all so cosy and nice on my birthday evening...I'll stop
and let Chris talk, but give Dad my love and a BIRTHDAY KISS from
Lancelot."</p>

<p><i>(Pause.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher.</i> "Sorry, Mumsie, I was talking to Lance. He
tells me he is twenty-four today&mdash;what a grown up he is! Yet
he seems as young or younger than I am only much more advanced in
spirit, but just a boy full of fun and games. I am so surprised
that he is so human still after all these years of spirit life...I
am very happy to see you an extra day this week owing to Lance's
birthday, which I had no idea of till he told me to-day. I am so
glad to be with him again, too."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot.</i> "Chris is ever so glad to know I still keep my
birthday because he thought all those things were just earth-life,
but birthdays are very spiritual too."</p>

<p><i>Christopher.</i> "I am surprised as he says, but I quite see
how one's birthday is a part of one's life here as well as on
earth. I think you are tired, Mumsie darling, so I will stop and
let Lance finish as it is his day."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot.</i> "Such a huge Hug for Mum and Dad on my birthday
from LANCELOT with love."</p>

<p><i>February 20th. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"I was a bit later than usual so I expect you got
anxious&mdash;the fact was, I couldn't leave a case who had a bad
attack of fear and wanted to bolt, so I just had to stop till he
righted himself...</p>

<p>"Now I want to tell you that my work is progressing very
strongly. I mean, I have stronger powers to help now, and am so
glad to be used in this way to help the frightened men in this
war...I feel overcome by gratitude that I can help fear, because it
was so much my besetting sin and I was so timid and faithless in my
earth life. It fills me with grateful joy to be able to clear it
out of the minds of others. Now I'll give you an example of the
kind of work I do.</p>

<p>"Charles was a tank gunner, and very good at it, too, but he had
attacks of nerves which gave him no peace of mind, he was always in
dread of being unable to carry on when firing at the enemy. I went
with him into action and gave his mind a stimulus to carry on as if
he was only practising, and he found it ever so easy and forgot his
dread altogether. I heard him say to another fellow that he felt
better now he had really been into battle and come out steady
without doing anything silly. I feel I am really helping to win the
war as much or more than I could have in my body. It is such grand
fun, too, to see how they respond to my suggestions and try to
carry them out, thinking they are their own!</p>

<p>"I think I'll get back and see if my chap is all right I was
with just now. You'll understand, I know, that I'm rather busy
to-night and shall come again soon. Think of me at nine, won't you,
darling."</p>

<p><i>March 5th, 1944.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I want to tell you a bit of an adventure for Dad to
enjoy. I went to a battleground in Novra...I can't get it into your
mind and don't know how to spell the beastly place, it ends in a
shriek like most of these Russian names. I had been getting on
finely with a plucky Russian boy who wanted to see his old home
again, and we found close to his house a new church was being built
for worship, so he was delighted because no churches have been
built in Russia for a generation or so. He was much impressed with
the need for bringing back their religion because he found life
went on after death, so it cheered him up no end to see that his
father was taking part in building a church."
<i>(Interruption.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Later.)</i> "Mumsie, I hope you haven't pondered over all my
drivel to the extent you were doing just now! I shall be afraid to
go on chatting away if I think my words are so important!" <i>(It
interests people to hear something about your life.)</i> "Yes, I
can quite understand that when I think of our crass ignorance of
any other life than our human one in the old days." <i>(Do you mind
if I publish some of your letters?)</i> "Of course, do anything you
like. I quite feel it may help and should be glad to contribute
anything.</p>

<p>"May I show you another picture of a scene in France where I
stumbled on a hero in disguise? He looked a Cochin and wore uniform
of a private in the German army, but he was giving away his food to
the starving children, and I could see he had had nothing to eat
himself for days. he was a Frenchman escaping from Germans, I
think, but I saw such a glow of sacrifice of his own hunger for the
sake of these ragged, hungry children. I was much struck by his
courage and unselfishness. Everywhere I go I see courage grown out
of danger and despair. It is great to think that war can produce
great qualities like this. I make a tune now about all that."</p>

<p><i>(Pause. I felt music round me.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Good. Mumsie, you were nearly over to me, and heard my tune,
though not clearly. I must congratulate you on letting yourself go
and getting a bit further than usual. May I be abrupt and say
good-night, for I find it's nearly nine and I promised to be over
with a case for the nine p.m. chimes. Good-night, darling, and Dad
too."</p>

<p><i>March 12th. (8 a.m.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Coming morning to tell you a secret. I am to be promoted to
ray-carrier soon. Uncle Toby has recommended me for this, which is
a wonderful work, and I am very surprised they think I am capable
of it. Yes, I can be here all day and talk when you are free. Music
meanwhile."</p>

<p><i>(I felt that he began to play his instrument.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>Afternoon.</i>
</p>

<p><i>(A B.B.C. Concert.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, do you mind if I go on listening?...Yes, I hear only
your vibrations, but I can listen also to music you can't hear
which is the result of what is being played by instruments on
earth. I want to listen now."</p>

<p><i>(Later.)</i> "I want to tell you something I've just thought
of. Carmine clouds on deep azure sky lighted up by a rainbow of
unearthly colours, those you have no words for. I saw that coming
here to-day. I can't describe the wealth of glory in it. I am full
of love of colour now, it is so marvellously beautiful. Mumsie, how
great is God in beauty. God in all&mdash;all in God. Mumsie,
darling, let me tell you about another bit of wonder I saw over
here just before landing, it was ground this time. Trees in their
inner selves beginning to wake after winter sleep and showing
growth inwardly which will burst through later&mdash;multitudes of
tiny cells all bursting with palest green fronds which will later
push through the bud into leaves. I looked in fascination at the
purity of their green and white sheen, and saw how the growth cells
are making ready to push out into the open air. Such wonders one
never thought of in earth life when one was full of oneself...All
is God&mdash;I see now how the creative force works in all, and
only man has separate force&mdash;which he misuses..."</p>

<p><i>Evening.</i>
</p>

<p>"Now I want to give you some idea of how we get our orders from
headquarters. I contact the mind of one of the guides, who passes
me the orders come through from Uncle Toby, the Commandant. He gets
instructions from a higher order of being altogether, people I
can't see even yet, very high up in intelligence and knowledge of
good and evil. These high beings are the leaders of each group,
which acts only on their instructions as to big things like the
work of organisation. All little details are left to us to use our
own powers over. I have, for instance, full scope for exercising my
own discretion as to where I look for work and who I help, also to
some extent how I help. All I do is known by these superior beings,
who guide by intuition when I am hardly conscious of being guided
at all. So you see how it works&mdash;and I love to be under high
guidance, as it gives one such confidence that one will not be
allowed to do the wrong thing so long as one wants to do right.
Have I explained it clearly?...I ought to be off now, I think, and
shall come in a week's time as usual, so far as I know.</p>

<p>"Cheerio&mdash;CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>March 19th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Shall we have a talk? I'm game if you like&mdash;shall have to
be off soon, for I came so early intending to get back to work
early too. I want to explain something you can't quite grasp, I
find, and that is the way I arrange my aggressions into your mind.
You seem to think I say words aloud, but I only insert my meaning
into your brain and you put words to it yourself. Different to
writing like this, when I use your ectoplasmic hand and my own
words. I also would like to explain that I can't take messages from
one person to another unless they are given in thought-form as you
did so carefully this morning. I got your mental images
clearly.</p>

<p>"Now I want to be off, so I'll just tell one adventure which may
amuse Dad and then good-bye for the time. I collected a cat from
the wreck I told you of months past. I went past it on a journey
home, and there was the little thing still on board and unable to
understand why it was so lonely. It came up to me overjoyed at
seeing a human being again, and this time was quite willing to
leave the boat, but not me! So I had to keep it, and it is
installed at our headquarters as a pet of mine! Uncle Toby is quite
agreeable to my keeping it, but he says <i>no more</i>
cats&mdash;he says he knows my preferences of old and wants me not
to remain cat-ridden for ever! I couldn't bear the little thing
being so lonely, though it was its own silly fault. I'll be off
now. Thoughts to Dad, many of 'em. Your CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>(Note.&mdash;See letter of January 9th, 1944.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>March 26th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to tell you a great piece of news&mdash;that I have been
given my promotion to ray-bringer. I am so keen, because it is a
beautiful work, all my love of colour will come in useful, and my
tuning of my instrument has prepared the way. I was told that my
love of colour could be used higher up but I never expected it so
soon. I am more pleased than I can explain. It is just a hop up
five rungs of the ladder at a time, and means leaving earth to help
a bit for a higher sort which is full of God and Beauty. I am just
full of pep and elation. I am going to be a lieutenant of rays to
begin with under Uncle Toby's personal direction, but soon I shall
be leaving him to work on my own.</p>

<p>"Now for an adventure of mine. I was on a parachute to see how
my man stood his first jump&mdash;he had been funking it a bit.
Suddenly I saw a funny goblin thing attached to it too and being
towed at a tremendous speed&mdash;for it. I tried to disentangle
it, but it had got into the mesh somehow so I couldn't bother about
it as my man wanted help. He got down well and took off his
parachute, so the goblin got out too and sat down and cried. I
couldn't see his thoughts as his mind is so small, but I was so
sorry for him, though having no notion what the trouble was. He
just sat there and cried and cried and nothing seemed to stop him,
so I had to leave him as I couldn't help. Then I saw my man was so
much relieved at the success of his first jump that his mind was
all clear again, so I hove away in search of anything else I could
find.</p>

<p><i>(Dad asked if C. could write with HIS hand.)</i>
</p>

<p>"What, <i>Dad?</i> I don't think so, he hasn't got any extension
of his ectoplasm which I could use so far as I can see, but he
might develop it if he tried, it would be just swell if he could.
Your ectoplasmic hand is so well developed, Mumsie, that I have no
difficulty whatever unless you let your mind get in the way...I
must give Dad a chance of trying his hand, do ask him to try."</p>

<p><i>(Dad took pencil and tried, but there was no result.)</i>
</p>

<p>"O what fun! Dad can't get his ectoplasmic hand out of its
sheath, so I can't use it, but he'll be able to if he goes on
trying to, I think. Dad is so unused to exerting his psychic body,
so he can't get free of his shell. He is like a hermit crab who
can't put his claws out, and Mumsie's claws come out fine."</p>

<p><i>Can you explain ectoplasm?</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, I can to some degree. Your ectoplasm is the cloak of your
spirit which it discards on leaving the body, just as in our birth,
which is so like our death, we have a wrapping which is born with
the body and discarded. Sometimes it is torn out prematurely and
ghosts are formed that way, but only a few, for it doesn't last
long. Mumsie can extrude it a bit, though not like mediums who have
practised doing it an awful lot.</p>

<p>"So long, must be off now. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>April 2nd, 1944. At Cox's Mill.</i>
</p>

<p>"Can we have a moment? You have been accable [overwhelmed] with
chores and I felt so unwanted!" <i>(I have had a terribly busy
time.)</i> "Yes, of course, Mumsie, and I was only funning. I see
Dave has been out in the boat already, much to the annoyance of the
moorhens, I gather.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you some good news of my promotion to be a
ray-bringer. I have started that work and find it not so hard as I
feared. I grasp the ray firmly, mentally, and direct its full force
on to the case to be helped, and often the results are quite
bewilderingly sudden and great. It means great concentration of
mental effort, and I find it tiring as yet, though accustomed by
now to mental force. It produces such a mighty clearance in the
patient's mind that it is better than anything I have touched
yet&mdash;just fine.</p>

<p>"About the moorhens&mdash;yes, I was watching one in the rushes
and he was peeking at Dave through the stems and feeling very
annoyed indeed, because he wanted to cross the pond and Dave was
paddling all over it in the boat so he couldn't venture. No more
to-night, darling, you're tired."</p>

<p><i>April 9th. Easter Sunday. (At Cox's Mill.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I am afraid I must be late, but I was unaware of your
clock-changing business and came expecting to find you at tea. Now
let's have a chat about my doings.</p>

<p>"I grasped my ray-work pretty well and am busy on innumerable
cases of fear healing&mdash;it is marvellous what ray control can
do. Often a man is nearly petrified with fear, and the directing of
a ray on to him gives a sense of security he learns to trust to and
feel strong. I gave another man a glimpse of etheric life and
helped him to feel his feet again. I am fully occupied now and
working so hard that I seldom stop to find
adventures&mdash;however, I must tell you that my cat is very happy
now in our life and quite at home in the office although she can't
catch mice any more. I changed over to a big office yesterday,
where we ray-bringers have more scope for our work. Such wonderful
colours in these rays, I wish you could see them&mdash;colours I
can't describe because you have no word for them, but scientists
over here use them for all sorts of work for humanity. All
musicians use rays for their work which have each a tone to which
they vibrate, and over-strained minds relax under certain tones of
music. Certain tones brace and others relax, all this one has to
learn in my work and it is just great to see a mind respond to the
treatment. Overtired minds are a great handicap just now in the
development of man, and more ray treatment is needed than we can
get qualified for. I have only qualified for the elementary
treatment so far, but I hope to progress.</p>

<p>"Now shall I tell you a story of my cat? A very silly one, but
funny. I had gone off on my work and she missed me and got a hunch
I was leaving her for good, so she got out my instrument I play on
and wouldn't leave it till I got back. She just sat on it with
determination to wait till I came for it. Of course I went for it
as soon as I got back, and she was overjoyed to see me again! I
must get back to work, I fear, for a call has just come in, they
say, so night night, Mumsie and Dave, old fellow&mdash;nice to see
you sitting at home again like old times.</p>

<p>"So long. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>April 23rd.</i>
</p>

<p>"I must tell you a bit of my work now which I think I can put
into human words. I charge up at a power station for sleep minds,
to give them a sense of security when they have been much lacerated
by bomb-noise. I feel so infused with power then that I speed like
a bullet to its goal to give them strength before sleep, and so
keep their mental imagery intact. It isn't easy to say it in words,
but I try to explain and you get a glimpse of what I mean. I am
awfully keen on my work now and will hope for good results later
when Uncle Toby inspects us...</p>

<p>"I would like to say how I seem to be a part of your own mind to
you, because you aren't sure sometimes that I am speaking and think
it must be your imagination. Can you understand thought vibration?
I catch your thought as a wave or vibration which affects my mind
and I send a wave back to yours, but you receive it inwardly, not
by your ears, so you think it is your own wave returning&mdash;but
I am often quite close and saying something out loud to you before
you take in that I am speaking. You can hear better than you will
believe because you are so afraid of being taken in by your
imagination, but you needn't feel so anxious, I am generally able
to make you hear without difficulty.</p>

<p>"I must be off and get some work done, so no more. Tell Dave
good-night from me. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>April 30th.</i>
</p>

<p>" My goodness, what a day you had yesterday! I felt a mind wave
of yours over at work, and you said how almighty good you felt out
in the forest. I wasn't able to come because I had a big bit of
work on, but Michael came and told me you had spent a whole day
among trees and were so refreshed that your mind would be clearer
than usual to-day, so I came along a bit sooner in case you thought
of me. I want to tell you that I am among a band of colour workers
with rays..."</p>

<p><i>(</i>R'<i>s mind was brought back by a chaffinch who hopped
on to the terrace with a loud "Chink chink.")</i></p>

<p>"Much amused at your tame bird; a bit obstreperous, ain't he?
Wanted a bit of cake, I guess. To return to my work. I am selected
for colour work with rays because of my love of colour, and it is
just grand watching how the bands of colour harmonise and melt in
together to form new colours. I love to watch them, and am keen to
learn which make the effect needed on the minds I work for. Mumsie,
I can't make out what you are doing, but it's something for Dave I
guess?</p>

<p><i>(Getting his clothes ready for school.)</i>
</p>

<p>"O yes, I forgot about clothes, they were a silly business, we
get on much better with thought clothes which only wear out if we
are stupid.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you all about my doings this past week. I gave a
great party to my pals in ray work and we went exploring over some
etheric plane hills where I had never been. One of the others knew
the way so he showed us how to go, and it was
scrumptious&mdash;full of glory of golden rays of power streaming
to the hills to light their further side. They were a power station
of great forces of glory, and we were helped in our work by it. I
took my special pal back to our office afterwards and he said he
had never known such a wonderful day...My special pal is
Ian&mdash;a very good chap and with great fun in him, too. I
haven't described our outing well, but it is impossible to put into
words, really. So much can't be told because you just can't
understand until you come over here. You may remember when I last
spoke of Ian, it was as our caretaker who sent my instrument on a
thought-wave. He is better than I am at thought-force, but I have
greater colour sense, so we work well together as a pair. Only a
short adventure to relate on behalf of Dad, who likes my
expeditions into gnome life. I find it is analogous to fairy life,
but on a slightly lower plane&mdash;gnomes are to fairies what
fungi are to flowering plants or mosses. I was away for a case of
fear in Arabia, and I came to a small place where there were only a
few houses and military tents and camels. My man was among the
soldiers and trying to get a grip of what he might have to do if
fighting came his way. He went away from the others to try and
become happier about it, and I found I could influence his mind in
nature so I showed him a picture in his mind of gnomes on English
trees, and he started thinking of fairy stories and Jack the
Giant-Killer and all those. So he got the better of his fear by
forgetting himself a few minutes. I took him over my whole
repertoire of fairy stories and he always felt he came out on top
in the way the right one always does, so it helped him quite a lot.
Don't break off just yet, I want to tell you how I fished a
complete outfit of gnomes out of their homes to be a sample of
gnome life to our naturalist here. He had a poor opinion of their
capabilities, so I showed him how much they could do if one took
them away from their normal surroundings to adapt themselves to new
ones. He put them on a table in the office with only moss fibres to
play with, and they set to work to conceal themselves in the fibres
in the cutest forms of sabotage you could have thought of. Not
sabotage, I mean <i>camouflage</i>. I thought it rather hard on
them so returned them fairly soon to their own place, but our
naturalist was much struck with their sensible behaviour and agrees
that they must have intelligence though small.</p>

<p>"Now I must go off back to my job, and thanks for a topping day,
from your CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>May 7th, 1944. At Stoke.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to tell you of our great day this afternoon when I and
other colour experts are on parade at headquarters. I have
graduated as an expert ray-colourist already, and am very bucked
over it. We are inspected periodically by Uncle Toby as we are his
platoon and work under him. I have a squad of colour-finders under
me and I send them out to find the colour required while I assist
the patient to absorb what is there. There is a shortage of some of
the most useful rays, and these are collected in essence and
brought in by my colour-finders, who have to work very hard and
quickly sometimes. They bend the ray to focus on the patient while
I do the diagnosis of what is needed and help him to absorb it.</p>

<p>"I was a colour-finder only till yesterday when I was given a
squad to command, so I am cocky like anything to-day, you bet! I
haven't been inspected yet so am awaiting it with some trepidation,
but feel I am all right as the last man got on well.</p>

<p>"O, you want to know something?" <i>(Are your patients in</i>
this life or have they left their bodies?)</p>

<p>"Both&mdash;it makes little difference whether they have died or
not to the etheric body which is what we cure. Most of them are on
the battlefields, and their etherics get hurt by vibrations of fear
or anger, so they need a lot of treatment in consequence of
fighting on the body plane. Sometimes they have been hit and leave
their bodies in a condition of fear, then we bring rays to bear to
heal and soothe, but often they are unhurt bodily but hurt
etherically by fear. I can't explain any better in words which are
not suited to our conditions over here.</p>

<p>"I want to say another detail about my work which you will
appreciate, and that is that I use emanations from the plant world
for many cases of fear&mdash;they have a soothing influence and
work in harmony with human auras which contain the results of the
mind feelings, so if you harmonize the aura it soothes the mind
which is producing it. I often get plant emanations from England
where they are softer and greener than most places, and bear
quantities of happy thoughts of flower-lovers in them. You give out
lots of happy thoughts among flowers, which they absorb and give
out in their emanations&mdash;these have more influence than any
others. Tell Dad he is helping soldiers on the battlefield by
giving out love to his plants! Far-fetched ideas, I should have
thought in earth life, but practical and useful here.</p>

<p>"Now I think we ought to stop, so I'll say au revoir and be back
about Wednesday to tell you how I get on this afternoon. Mid-week
suits better than Sundays now if you can stand it. I am so busy on
Sundays because there is a chance of getting minds to relax a bit
to give an opening for treatment. Au revoir till Wednesday, then.
Cheerio!"</p>

<p><i>May 10th.</i>
</p>

<p>"You are so receptive to-night, I nearly made you open your
etheric eyes&mdash;how splendid if you could! You are a bit scared
of losing earth sight, though, but you must in order to see
etherically&mdash;you can't function in both worlds at once, you
see...</p>

<p>"I am awfully proud of myself since Uncle Toby's inspection,
when he gave me a good chit and said he was proud of my progress. I
am in charge of a squad of ray-bringers and send them on my word of
command to get the rays needed for my cases, and only a short time
back I was flying around at the bidding of another squad commander!
Darling, it is Grand, and I am overjoyed at my promotion. Tell Dad,
please, I can't wait for him to know." <i>(Pause while Dad reads
this.)</i> "Now let's talk&mdash;I am about to tell you a charming
story of a lame dog and his master in our life.</p>

<p>"Chapter one. Master has died and dog awfully upset, can't make
out where Master has gone. Master over here, not able to make his
presence known, sees dog's affection and longs to comfort him.</p>

<p>"Chapter two. Dog given to Master's sister, who is a
clairvoyante, [stet] dog senses this and feels she can help him;
still wants Master but is happier.</p>

<p>"Chapter three. Sister sees Master and tells dog, who is able to
sense Master is near and wags tail violently, hoping for more.
Master able to make his presence known to dog by sense of smell.
Can materialise a human scent and dog recognises this as his. Quite
reassured by this, gets very fond of sister, who often tells him
Master is near.</p>

<p>"Chapter four has just started, as dog got ill and died a few
days ago, and his master, a friend of mine, has got him at our
office with my cat, and told me this tale. He and my cat are great
pals already, and much happier than before.</p>

<p>"I want to say something about my work which will affect you,
and that is the colour-rays which you form when you are seeing
beauty. I use them often, so I want you to be very full of
beautiful things because you send out colour-rays all over the
place and they are such a help." <i>(Shall I take up sketching
again?)</i> "Yes, you might help a lot if you took to sketching
again. You see, these colour rays are soothing to jarred minds, and
very concentrated rays proceed from the minds of lovers of beauty
which are more powerful than non-human rays. I can't explain better
than that, but it is your love of colour which concentrates power
in your rays. Colours affect different minds in different ways, and
some have an opposite affect on one mind to what they have on
another...Blue has a soothing effect on most minds...Warm colours
give a reassuring warm glow which most people find too much for
their etheric aura.</p>

<p>"I must go, I am being called. Au revoir. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>May 14th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to bring a guest who is anxious to know you&mdash;he is
my friend, Ian M&mdash;."</p>

<p><i>Ian writing.</i> "I am unaccustomed to being in control of a
human hand not my own&mdash;how queer&mdash;you are now getting
only my&mdash;sorry, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chris speaking. Ian is so slow that I must help him out by
saying that he wants to know you and Dad, having a great love for
me . I can say that plainly, not feeling shy as we used to, because
here we see love as a reality and it shows, so we can talk about it
freely. Ian and I are great pals and he wants to know you too. He
is not anxious to talk to his people, as he says they are over
here&mdash;he was the youngest of a family all killed in the war,
and he too. He is getting interested at seeing our method of
communication and wants to try again."</p>

<p><i>Ian writing.</i> "O, how kind. It is more difficult than I
thought. I am clumsy at holding on. Chris is much better."</p>

<p>(R. <i>had a vague vision of his face.</i>)</p>

<p>"Yes, I had a fair moustache, as you saw. My face is visible to
you. May we talk again? Many thanks, I get on well now, and it is
fascinating to see my words coming out like they used to before I
came over here. 'Mony a mickle maks a muckle.' One day I shall get
a message to tell all not to be afraid&mdash;that is what we want,
eh, Chris?"</p>

<p><i>Christopher.</i> "I want to talk now, Mumsie. Ian has so much
enjoyed writing, it is a new experience for him, you see, and he
hopes to learn to do it better soon if you'll let him use your hand
again?</p>

<p>"Now I want to proceed with my history of doings. I am given a
post of some prominence in my capacity as leader of a squad of
ray-workers, and Ian is in another squad, so we don't see much of
each other now. I am full of kick at my own importance and crowing
like a young cockerel just found his voice!</p>

<p>"Can you bear another story of my work? I was carrying out a
camp for refugees from fear&mdash;those who are frightened of death
and so arrive in our life blind. When we had got our workers
together to form a circle of healing rays I found an important
colour was missing, so I had to send an ambulance worker off for it
as the others were holding their rays already. A poor chap came in
who was petrified with fear, and we held him under the softest rays
to heal him just as the ambulance fellow got back, when he went
full blaze on to the patient's face and nearly blinded him again. I
was angry for the first time since I got here, and never realised
the effect before&mdash;my ambulance worked just got stunned by the
sudden shot of anger from me, and I was overcome by remorse because
he had only been a bit stupid really. It is awful how quickly one
can do harm by a bit of quick temper here, and makes one very
careful."</p>

<p><i>(His father asked, "How does he measure time?")</i>
</p>

<p>"You are asking what?...Yes, I see. We measure time in a way by
timing the rotations of the earth and moon, because we who are
working on earth need to keep in time with earth doings, and to
know when we can find people asleep and so on. We don't need time
otherwise than for our earth work, I think, though I haven't been
away from earth yet, so I don't know conditions elsewhere...Yes, I
know Big Ben chimes at nine p.m. because so many are keeping it now
that it makes a lighting up effect in parts of England."</p>

<p><i>(Do you divide your time into hours etc.?)</i>
</p>

<p>"No, not so far as I have observed. Why are you so curious about
time? I don't see that it matters much anyway. I can see a bit into
future events, though, now, but not as affecting individuals, only
a sort of national destiny looming out of the dark of war and
England being a destined leader of humanity. I can't see future
clearly yet at all. Now, good night, my Mumsie and Dad&mdash;tell
Dad good night from me, he is in a book just now. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>May 15th. Evening. Very slowly and with difficulty an unknown
personality wrote the following:&mdash;</i>
</p>

<p>"Your son&mdash;may he be blessed&mdash;has given me absolute
relief. O God, the joy of freedom from fear. I came to say how much
I owe to you through him. God bless him and his great work. Ernest
M&mdash;."</p>

<p><i>May 17th. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"I didn't hear...Ernest M&mdash;. I wonder why you spoke of him?
He was a case of mine and I was awfully sorry for him, he was
terribly mangled and suffered such pain before he could get free
from his body, which was helpless under a gun. I was awfully sick
at the gruesome sight and it took me some screwing up of my courage
to tackle the job, as I was new to it then. He was in desperate
pain and waves of fear and I couldn't make him leave his body, he
was too much afraid. I couldn't use rays and such things then, and
I struggled hard to help him. Then I left him with a guide, and
later we met and he thanked me, and I showed him where you lived as
we talked, but I never dreamt he would try to talk to you&mdash;how
odd! Yes, I know he was grateful.</p>

<p>"I must tell you a bit about my work now, which is ever so good
and makes me happier than ever in my life. I am more and more
interested in the control of rays of colour and their blending to
heal human minds. I never dreamt such power would be possible, and
it is so grand to be able to help men like this. I find it
difficult to describe, though. Only a few colours are normally used
and these are those you can't see yet. My squad work along ray
lines which make sort of rainbows meeting at the man to be healed
and arching from him into our power centre, where they are renewed.
I have to arrange the order in which they contact the man according
to his condition, and this isn't easy, as one has to judge the
probable effect on his will as well as mental attitude. I am
confined to the colours which affect fear, so it isn't too
complicated for my inexperience, but still absorbingly interesting.
Once I had an expert photographer to deal with, and when he saw
these new colours he went off his chump and I had to produce a
force-ray to keep him quiet, he was so excited at the sight!</p>

<p>"Now I'll stop, as I think you are tired."</p>

<p><i>May 19th. Lancelot.</i>
</p>

<p>"Lancelot&mdash;yes, Mum Darling&mdash;I am come to tell you a
very exciting thing, and this is it.</p>

<p>"Chris has got on so well that he has been chosen for a special
mission to go out of the earth sphere into planetary space and
collect help against the fear forces swaying earth people now. I am
to be his guide and help him, but he must do the asking for help
because he knows fear and I never had to. He will be here to talk
to you on Sunday for the last time for some weeks, and then we
shall set sail for Mars, which will be an experience for him and
also help his work. He is so keen about his work that exploring
makes no appeal, but he knows he will bring help, so is just
longing to do it, but only for that. I do admire him so for his
great longing to help people from fear. I must say good night now
to Dad and Mum my own. LOVE from LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>May 21st. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, my own, I can hardly bear to leave home now, but I must
be brave and do it for my work's sake. Lance told you, didn't he? I
am chucking away my advancement as a squad commander and all the
work I love so much&mdash;and you and my home and Dad&mdash;it's
Dad I mind most because I so want to be a son he can be proud
of&mdash;he can't know what I am going to do now.</p>

<p>"It is an honour to be chosen for this, but I would so much
rather not." <i>(But it will be a great adventure!)</i> "Yes, I
know. It is such a big plunge, though. Lance is grand because he
understands my feelings and yet he has never been through it all."
<i>(He felt just as you do when he first went away from earth, and
he was only nine years old.)</i> "You have been with Lance like
this? I never knew he was like that, I thought him always
adventurous and brave. He was so young to go away then. That's why
he is so grand now and understanding and brave too. My
mother&mdash;I will be brave too. I have conquered my timidity but
this is a different sort of courage, courage to give up what I love
because God calls me to His work...</p>

<p>"We go to-morrow, and are to travel in etheric space as Lance
says it is more direct. I shall be right once we have said
good-bye...</p>

<p><i>(His father had been told by a mathematician that it would
not be possible to tie a knot in four-dimensional space, and
suddenly asked, "Can he tie knots?")</i>
</p>

<p>"Can I tie knots? What a funny question! I won't try because we
don't have anything to tie with&mdash;no strings or ropes or
anything of that sort. Dad is perplexing his mind over some
scientific problem, I guess? Mumsie, you have made me quite
cheerful again with your funny questions from Dad! I was getting
emotional, I guess, and that don't do. After all, we shall be back
in some weeks or so, and I'll perhaps have some comic adventures to
relate on the human plane. Mars people are very human, Lance says,
and make unaccountable fuss over their potty little planet...I
shall be always with you in spirit, for I love you all too much to
be ever away in mind. I want to say good-bye to Dad now, and then
to go off straight away quickly.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Dad...all right, I'll go.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my own darlings."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Part 2</h2>

<p><i>June 16th, 1944.</i>
</p>

<p>"O my Mumsie Darling, I am just overwhelmed with joy at getting
home to you and Dad again! I quite enjoyed my adventure, but it was
taking me so far away from you and I am RADIANT with joy to be back
again. How can I begin to tell you about it all? There is too much
for me to know where to start, but I will try by beginning where we
went off together, Lance and I&mdash;off the earth for the first
time into the blue! I felt like a diver taking his first
plunge&mdash;it was so glorious that I forgot to feel homesick or
anything. Off we went on wings of aspiration, for you have to feel
an uplifting force before you can rise out of earth's sphere of
influence, and that we did, for our longing to bring the needed
help was sufficient to speed us on our way. Then I saw for the
first time out of earth's atmosphere. I felt I had been blind
before, and never shall I forget that wonderful feeling of clear
vision over long vistas of space. I just simply can't find words,
my poor powers of description are too inadequate altogether.</p>

<p>"Lance was too grand for words, he understood all I was feeling
and let me gasp a bit without interference&mdash;but our mission
came to my mind and we sped on, till a beam from an angelic being
fell across our path and he turned to receive further instructions
from our guardian. Only a message of encouragement and strength,
and then we arrived. I had not expected it so soon and was so
surprised, for I had not been aware of our approach at all. Mars is
an immense reservoir of colour, and Martians are all advanced
beings who give out these colourful thoughts which are much needed
by earth to help our struggle. I was collecting rays immediately,
for they intoxicated me with their beauty and colours which I had
never seen even in my new life. I just went wild with delight, and
I think the Martians were all out to help, for I met no feeling of
opposition at all. I can't describe what I saw for lack of words,
but we travelled a lot and over mountain ranges and hills, always
with Martians who seemed very interested in our mission...</p>

<p>"I was afraid you would want a description of our tour, but I
find it so impossible because there are no words which will fit.
You can't pick up the proportions of a Martian because he comes
under a different set of dimensions or whatever it is. He is not a
three-dimensional being at all, but mostly a brain with much more
powers of creation than earth men and less body. They are in bodily
form but very tenuous and more consistent with our etheric life
than the earth bodies. The landscape is unearthly, too, but with
other classes of life such as we get over here all interpenetrating
each other&mdash;they are quite different to our forms, though, and
much more colourful, in fact, colour is the most accentuated thing
and all rays we want are there in superabundance. I was overwhelmed
with the beauty of it. Nothing seemed to conflict there, all was
perfect harmony, and no darkness either, for they all give out such
bright thoughts that we were lighted up all the time.</p>

<p>"I wish I could tell you more clearly, but I shall think of
little things soon, I dare say, which may give you some idea of it.
Coming away, I was better able to appreciate the landscape, which
was comfortingly like earth in configuration as we got further
off&mdash;only clothed with colours which beat description and
which you have, of course, no names for. Carrying our precious
burden of ray-keys, we created quite a sensation in the camp when
we returned all laden, and what a help these will be! You see, we
can use them endlessly, for the key produces the ray when turned. I
am caught in a tangle of words again which mean other than what I
want to say!...</p>

<p>"Lance has gone to a higher plane over the collaboration with
Mars on the spirit side, I believe, but he wants to come one day
soon to see you, I know. I shall come on Sunday next time, as I
need a bit of a rest now...Yes, better stop now. Tell Dad
good-night and give him my endless love. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>June 18th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I came a while ago but you were occupied with other things and
I couldn't get a look in! My method is unavailing if your mind is
very full, but usually you respond at once to a gentle tap on your
brain cells. Now, Mumsie, for a good graphic description of my
travels, to please Dad!</p>

<p>"Cumulus clouds over here&mdash;nothing like that on
Mars&mdash;very clear rarefied atmosphere, great mountains and
clear rivers, but very little water and no seas as far as I saw.
Mind over matter has reached marvellous powers&mdash;all vegetation
is cultivated for beauty, not food. No forms I could draw would
give any real idea of it, for it is different altogether from any
earthly ideas...Mind features in the plant world more than on
earth, and they hardly differ from animal life&mdash;in fact, I
hardly know whether to call it vegetation except that they grow
from the soil. Even that was not as our plants grow, with roots,
they just seemed to remain static and I suppose sucked some sort of
nutriment from the ground. Colour was the beauty there, always
colour of so many kinds that I got bewildered by its variety. New
colours surrounded me and I couldn't take them all in, it was all
so strangely wonderful. I am just beginning to revel in it in
retrospect, I was too bewildered when actually seeing it.</p>

<p>"The Martians have buildings, too, but made of a clear substance
like our glass, only not so brittle, I think, and these buildings
were only used as laboratories of some kind for some sort of
chemical experimenting which seemed to occupy a great many of them.
I couldn't make out how Martians lived in a bodily way at all, for
they were in bodies of a sort but more akin to our etheric bodies
and not earthly like our human bodies. I don't think they need food
and drink or even air to breathe, though they have a tenuous
atmosphere much clearer than earth. Their mental processes are
tremendous, like giant upheavals of the atmosphere in the shape of
pyramids of colour with marvellous meaning and creative effect.
Camel-coloured objects abounded of which I couldn't find the
meaning, and Lance couldn't tell me either...Do you realise that I
simply can't draw anything Martian in two dimensions on a bit of
paper&mdash;it has at least four dimensions, if not more, and you
simply can't grasp the idea at all. These camel-coloured objects
seemed to be a manufacture of Martian minds, but for what use I
simply haven't the foggiest...The 'plants', if such they were,
covered the ground in most places, and seemed to have a mental life
of their own, not so high as the Martians, who are on a level with
man after death, but akin to our minds more than to our vegetable
world. I was not able to make out their thoughts, because all ideas
on that planet are totally distinct from ideas here, and only after
a much more lengthy stay could one hope to grasp their meaning. All
seemed harmonious and friendly to us, though, and I felt sure we
were welcome and interesting to them...Yes, I think they understood
us better than I, at any rate, understood them. Lance knew more
than I did, of course, but he finds them a bit difficult to
understand even now...O yes, there was a grand mixture of creatures
corresponding to our animal life, but again I can't attempt to draw
or describe them...These were gallumphing about all over the place,
making hay amongst the vegetative creatures which didn't seem to
mind a bit. I can't think how they live, for I never saw one eat or
drink anything. They must have some other form of subsistence
altogether. I saw grand thoughts proceeding from some of these,
though on a lower plane than the Martians, but still well above the
capabilities of our animal life...No, Mumsie, I'll not attempt to
draw a Martian, for I feel that it would be almost profane after
their goodness to us, for we owe to them the success of our
journey, and I can't simply attempt to describe them. You couldn't
understand anything I might try to say...I am happy above all to be
back again, though I must say I enjoyed it more than I could have
imagined before. Now I'll stop and tell you some more another time.
Goodbye, darling, going now. Your loving CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>June 21st.</i>
</p>

<p>"Can you give me a few minutes now? I am so glad to be able to
tell you that we are promoted as a result of our journey. Lance is
Celestial Light-bearer, and I am lance-corporal of ray-light...No,
of course you can't understand, but it means promotion for both and
we are very elated over the success of it all. Now I must be off
again to my work. So long. Love to Dad, and do tell him, won't
you?"</p>

<p><i>July 2nd, 1944. Lancelot.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mum Darling, I have got so much to tell you that I hardly know
where to start! I don't know how much Chris said, but he was grand
and full of excitement at going outside of earth for the first
time. It was so long ago I did it that I can't remember how it
felt, but I wasn't as surprised as Kitopher, I think. He caught in
his mental breath with wonder, so I had to stop a bit to let him
grow used to it. He gave out such gasps of wonder that I was quite
overcome by it and felt I hadn't realised before how great it all
is. I am so used to it now, you see. Many things were old to me
becos I've been there often now, but I think I never tried to
describe it to you before? So I'll have a go at it. Mars is colour
storage planet, and the Martians give out fans of colour in their
thought-forms, so that was what we were after becos they help
Kitopher's work on earth. I couldn't tell you much about their life
becos it is so different to your ideas, but they are limited to
their own planet and have no further outlook, though very high
spiritually compared to our earth life.</p>

<p><i>(Have they no life beyond their bodily one?)</i>
</p>

<p>"No, they are a race of colour-formers and that only, without a
further development elsewhere such as we have. Sorry, Mum, I can't
draw them, it's too complicated, but they are very beautiful in
shape, only so different to your ideas that it won't go on to
paper...We went all over the place to find colour-keys, and the
Martians helped by mind waves of impulse to help us. Some
magnificent results may come from this expedition, and I was to
tell you that Chris is working in new ways, and will be here in a
short time now to tell you about it...</p>

<p>"Now may I tell you a thing of Mars which you can understand,
and that is their colour experimental factories, which are all made
of crystal clear as glass only not so breakable. They store keys of
new colours in these, and experiment in blending them for purposes
of life renewing. They live by the life-giving rays, you see, so
they renew their vitality in blending new colours which give out
these rays. That takes the place of your food and drink and air.
All life on Mars is drawn from cosmic rays being blended with
planetary emanations and inhaled by the living forms there.</p>

<p>"I must go now, and just want to send a Handshake to DAD like
old times. He will find me just his Boy when he comes here, the
same as ever, but LOTS Bigger in Mind, of course.</p>

<p>"DARLING MUM, Goodbye, see you soon again. LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>July 2nd. (Later). Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I couldn't come sooner because I had such a handful of
ray-keys to distribute to all our centres, and was actively
employed these two weeks past. Now I want to make up for lost time
and go ahead with our talks on Mars and such things. Now when I
think of Mars I seem to see it all more clearly than at first and
have a grand idea of the general outset of things. I remember
seeing great volcanoes over there which shot violent explosions all
over the place, and much of the vegetation seemed to grow round
these, as if explosions were good for it! A long fringe of
mountains bounded the horizon when we were on the surface, and many
volcanoes among them. Much mind activity took place after each
explosion, and they seemed to revivify the vegetation in a most
strange way. Another thing I saw was very surprising and I can't
make it out at all. The Martians never slept or rested at all, so
far as I could see, nor did their animal and plant world. They had
etheric vision so of course no darkness, but they seemed to need no
rest of any kind at all. My mind was set on securing our rays and
confused with the strangeness of it all, so I could not take in
much; however, I hope I have given you some ideas which may set
earth people thinking. Lance could tell you more as he has been
there many times."</p>

<p><i>(Lancelot was with me this morning.)</i>
</p>

<p>"O, so you have heard from him?"</p>

<p>R. <i>He explained what the crystal laboratories are
for.</i></p>

<p>"O&mdash;he never told me that, but there was so much to do and
see. Colour is their main objective, and they are the source of a
lot of the rays we use on earth...One more thing I can see in my
mind to tell you. Quantities of coloured bars of sand, or what
appeared sand, lying in regular arrangements like chess-board
squares, only vividly coloured. All round them the Martians placed
special animals, to guard them, I thought, but I can't think why.
There is sure to be a good reason, because their thought-processes
are so great...Talk again later."</p>

<p><i>Later.</i>
</p>

<p>"Came over on your wish-wave, Mumsie, just in time for Silent
Minute..."</p>

<p>R. <i>Some months ago you told us you were a lieutenant of
light-rays, and a week ago you said you were "promoted" to be a
lance-corporal; isn't a lieutenant higher than a
lance-corporal?</i></p>

<p>"O, I see&mdash;I am lieutenant of light-rays now, but I got
promotion for our journey to lance-corporal of <i>ray-light</i>,
which is a bigger thing than light-rays, so I am both now. I can't
explain in human words really, but you see ray-light has certain
fundamental sources which produce the ray&mdash;they are known as
keys from their portability because one can transfer them from
place to place, and they produce their special ray whenever needed
by getting a light-ray and bending it over them in a special way.
You see how difficult it is to explain in words, but it is all
quite plain over here. I use them for my fear work incessantly, and
my helpers get accustomed to their own particular ray-key and soon
are quite good at it. Now may we have another Mars talk? I have
thought of more to say. Goblins abound over there in similar forms
to their plant life. I saw so many that I soon forgot to notice
them, for they were all over the plants like little insects. They
were all in rounded shapes like the plants, and I only call them
goblins because they had the same relation to the plant world that
ours seem to have here. I also saw coloured winged things flying,
but not like our insects, they are more like balloons with wings
and some sort of gassy inside...I can't come every week now, you
see, there's more work than ever just now, and we are hard at it,
and I am so keen to help now I feel I am getting good at it. I was
off on a case just now between our talks, but left him with my
second-in-command&mdash;however, I must get back soon."</p>

<p><i>Dad sends his love.</i> "Tell Dad my best thanks and love
too. No more now, Mumsie, I must away.</p>

<p>"Your loving son, Chris."</p>

<p><i>July 16th.</i>
</p>

<p>"O, Mumsie, I thought you had forgotten me altogether. Never
mind, here goes for a good talk while we may. Can we begin by a bit
of my work I am now doing? Don't know if I can get it into your
mind, but I'll try. First a luminous belt of colour of unearthly
kinds all blended into one which glows with radiance. I carry my
squad into this with keys of the rays we need and all are infused
with power from the ray-light source in the belt. They then turn
their keys in harmony towards the man whose fear is our objective,
and he feels an uplifting force which holds him clear of his body
till fear is past. I claim no credit for this way of healing, which
is matter of course to higher workers but not imagined by me till I
got promotion. I feel very elated to have got on so fast and
arrived at this stage so soon...Now for a bit about Mars. My first
impressions I can now see were too amplified and diffuse, and I
want if possible to give you a clear-cut picture of some of it.
Martian contours of land and hills are very earth-like but coloured
differently&mdash;colours of all sorts, widely differing from
earth. Valleys full of life of all sorts and kinds and bare
hill-tops, except volcanoes where life seems to receive stimulus.
Quantities of camel-coloured...<i>(Interruption)</i>...Lance has
explained the camel-coloured objects as being receptive of the
planetary emanations which feed the life on Mars. These are
combined with interstellar rays in some chemical process which the
Martians carry on in their laboratories, and the camel-coloured
things provide one of the important ingredients...</p>

<p>"Mumsie, you get quite transparent sometimes when you think out
like that...</p>

<p>"I don't think you ought to talk any more about Mars to-night,
you seem so dim and tired out...</p>

<p>"I'll just hug you and send love to my Dad, and go."</p>

<p><i>July 23rd.</i> R. <i>Is Christopher here?</i></p>

<p>"Your idea is correct. I am at your feet and service! Now,
Mumsie, shall we make good our deficiencies in a real Mars talk? I
call much more to mind than before, and can tell you of many
amusing happenings. Quite a bit was approachable in human language,
so here goes...Cubical&mdash;that's as near as I can get to
it&mdash;shapes of marvellous colours were over the laboratories,
and one of the Martians overthrew one of these in order to produce
our ray-key of that sort, and on his interpretation our amazement
must have seemed funny, for he gave spasms of bright colours like
those produced by merry thoughts of earth people. He was obviously
enjoying our surprise, because he had made such a colour commotion
in the whole laboratory by upsetting this top thing. I can also
remember a sight which you would have enjoyed on the mountains of
orange and gold strata in the rocks giving off emanations which the
plant forms were sucking in, I think; anyhow, they looked larger
there than elsewhere, and happier. Many varieties of plants were
guarded by animals, and I don't know why, because all seemed
harmonious and no need for guards for anything...</p>

<p>"To return to Mars and my journey, we were met on landing by a
Martian with clairvoyance&mdash;at least, he was more advanced
etherically than the others, although they could all see us. He
enquired as to the object of our visit, having ability to read our
thoughts, which were unintelligible to most of them. He gave us
great welcome when he heard what a state earth had got into, and
put all their resources of ray-power at our disposal in the kindest
way, and then went with us as interpreter. Many Martians have
beginnings of knowledge of the way we think, which I suppose would
puzzle the average earth man, let alone his hoping to understand
their thoughts! They are far more evolved than earth, and link up
with high spirits of ours who have long left their bodies. I felt
so small and ill-equipped to be asking them for help, but Lance was
on an equality with them and knows some of them personally quite
well. He is so sweet to me, and never makes me feel any distance
between us, just as if we were brothers together on earth. I can't
tell you how I love him, he is so good to me...I am very hard at
work just now, and there is hard fighting still to come, but not
much more bombing of England, I hear. The Germans are making their
last effort now to break England's spirit and have already failed.
I imagine they'll be making more of these bluebottles than they
will send over, as we are to get their French coast soon and stop
it that way, I am told. Can't say more, as I am no prophet yet! By
the way, you remember I saw some preparation on the coast months
past? I thought then that they were gasometers, but I think they
were intended for these bombs, but we did them in so thoroughly
that they had to concoct less prominent ones, and went to ground in
burrows instead. They were to have been launched from a height on
those towers, and would have carried far into England then, but our
bombers dished that little picnic.</p>

<p>"I am going over to France to have a look at our boys where my
work is now, so I must stop and come again soon. Expect me before
Sunday next probably, as I am working so near and in touch with
England now the bombs are flying. Give Dad my love and duty as
always...Yes, I'll be here for Dave's home-coming. So long.
Chris.</p>

<p><i>(Note.&mdash;For previous references to enemy preparations on
French coast, see letters of Dec. 18th and 26th, 1943. The ideas as
to purpose of what he saw are Christopher's own and possibly not
accurate.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>July 28th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Cheerio, Dave, old thing. I love to feel you're back at home in
spite of 'doodles' and all. Many happy returns to Cox's Mill, I
wish you.</p>

<p>"I am after catching up with these fly-bugs and helping pilots
chase them off you all, for I can't see my family charred into
cinders with their nasty tails.</p>

<p>"Give me a bit of time and I'll tell you something of my present
work. All my helpers in my squad are graduates of our ray-light
college. I give them commands as to where to look for rays needed
for any special case, and they bring the ray along on a trailer. I
can't describe it in your words, but it trails the ray in a
definite direction so as to bend it towards my case. It is all
worked by thought transference from me, and they have to be quick
at picking up my directing thought which I have to send out with
force when I have reached the patient. Now, imagine I am by a case
and sending out thought directions to my squad. Pretty soon they
begin to come in by ones and twos, trailing their special rays, and
I gather them into the right order to suit the case of fear. Green
blends are best for my work, but sometimes a patient has a dominant
fear which needs a glowing colour of reassurance, and crimson is a
help, but others you have no name for are better than any earth
colours. A blend is made to suit the case, and they stand round
holding their rays in the right order. The patient receives
uplifting thoughts, and we apply our rays as his mind rises in
response, giving each a few seconds to operate and benefit the
etheric force within him, which glows out again as it should. Fear
shrivels the etheric, and we sustain force against the fear
pressure, holding it away from his mind till it recovers. I find it
all so absorbing that I seldom leave my work now except to come to
you, so have no stories to tell of travels and such. All my life is
fulfilled in this work I now do, and I can't tell you how happy I
am in it. Many things combine to give me power. Your etheric
influence is great and I use it often. Dad gives me courage and
fine etheric rays of golden love of beauty. I can tap many minds
through your work of opening them to other life ideas, and all the
time I am in contact with a high source of directive force which
controls and inspires me always. I am in Heaven while I work and
help the men who need it so sorely. Tell Dad I am so happy, he will
love to know. I am coming more often now Dave is home, and will
tell him some marvels of Mars in my next talk&mdash;this has been
all of my work because I was so full of it, but I will stop now, as
you are tired, and will come at this time in two days&mdash;Sunday,
I think? Give Dad a handshake from his old brother and warmest
wishes.</p>

<p>"Au revoir. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>July 30th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Came early to be in time for your plans for the day, but I see
Dad and Dave have gone off already, to church, I gather? Well,
we'll have something to show 'em when they get back!</p>

<p>"Come over to Mars with me for a stroll, Mumsie, you can do so
without any effort on my will-propulsion! Climb up one of the great
Mars mountains, all glowing in colours unknown to your sight but
now well known to me. I can't make you understand them any more
than you could project your colours into the mind of one born
blind. They must be seen to be believed. Well, here we are on the
top of a magnificent mountain, with queer plants or animals or
whatever they may be all sending thoughts off in abundance, though
restricted to their own type of understanding. Clear as crystal is
the air, not foggy like earth atmosphere, and all is harmony, no
resounding discords of hatred or fear or self-aggrandisement as on
earth&mdash;yet for that reason, so I am told, the spirits of
Martians never evolve beyond their planet. Discord and disharmony
give the capacity for development beyond earth, strange though it
may seem to you. I want you to believe me when I say that I feel a
greater being than those on Mars who are already beyond me in
spiritual attainment, because I am a man and partake of earth's
pain and turmoil. We stand on our mountain and gaze at the strange
landscape of brilliantly coloured beings and gigantic craters and
hills. Suddenly an explosion takes place through a near crater of
gasses from the planet's interior. All the living beings rush
towards it, the static plant-like ones bend towards it to inhale
these gases, which constitute their means of life. A Martian
appears, clothed in various radiant sheaths of thought-forms,
and...Sorry, Mumsie, we were interrupted by an external trouble
which I have now dispersed.</p>

<p>"He carries a camel-coloured thing such as I have described
elsewhere, and proceeds to fill up this with the gases and project
it on will-power to his laboratory, where it seems they collect
cosmic rays to combine with these gases. All is calm once more,
only invigorated animals career in ecstatic leaps all over the
plants, and these send out clearer and more beautiful
thought-forms.</p>

<p>"I have built up this picture from confused memories by piecing
together what I did not clearly understand at the time, and I see
how things fit to make a coherent whole much better now in
retrospect. Lance has told me a lot about how they live which he
hadn't time for then, we were too busy. You are too different in
mind to take in more about it than I have now told, but I shall
perhaps be able to think out another picture of a different bit of
it, such as their rivers which are very small and contain scarcely
a trickle of water, but this is conserved to the last drop and
conveyed in tubes to their laboratories. I don't know for what
purpose, as they live on gases entirely and need no drink. A Mars
river wells up from a deep spring directly into a tube made of
their clear crystal material which conveys it straight into a
laboratory, so there is no river flora like ours. In fact, nothing
is like ours, but all as different as can be, and I only use words
with the proviso that they don't really give a correct idea of it
at all. Shall we have another talk when you are free again? And
meantime I will stroll under the trees and enjoy my home."</p>

<p><i>(Later: A Flying bomb was coming up and passed overhead.)</i>
</p>

<p>"You are anxious for me to give you another talk, and I am too,
but we are not so near...All well now, Mumsie, I thought better
wait till the noise had passed&mdash;you contact earth noises in
your etheric at present, and that makes you very sensitive to
vibrations of sound.</p>

<p>"Lend me your hand for another expedition and we'll go after the
ray-keys on Mars this time. Reminds me of hunting our rare plants!
But these were far more use to me, and Lance and I had a great time
getting them. The leading Martian I told you of was intelligent
enough to see our thought-forms and interpret them, and getting a
line on our requirements he gingered up his compatriots to supply
our needs and they hustled round no end. Umpteen camel-bags of all
sorts were inspected and laboratories opened up and the ray-keys
produced from their private stores. I can't describe what they look
like, for you haven't any idea of the conditions under which we
work, but their quality on Mars is far superior to anything in the
earth sphere, and some even make their particular ray
simultaneously with another ray and act as duplicators when
necessary. My business was only with fear controlling rays, so our
trouble was to sort these out from among so many others, such as
vitalising and energising and many other sorts. You can have no
conception of the beauty of the Martian rays, all glowing with
unknown new colours of infinite variety. I was so bewildered that I
simply couldn't cope at first, but Lance knew all about it so he
carried on while I collected my scattered wits. Nearly all the rays
I wanted were utilised in their laboratories, so it was very good
of them to let us pinch so many of their keys. I gather they have a
means of producing new ray-keys there which makes them endless or
else they couldn't carry on...We grasp ray-keys on our carriers of
mental construction&mdash;and you can't grasp that! But I can tell
you it is a very real way of carrying a quite real thing, much more
real than your flimsy iron and steel constructions!</p>

<p>"We travelled a bit to laboratories in various parts of the
country and our Martian guide was all hospitality and arranged it
all for our convenience.</p>

<p>"You are tired, Mumsie, and I think you have taken enough, so
I'll just be off after Dave and say nightie-night to Dad and
Mumsie. Your CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>August 6th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to tell you a few more details of my trip to Mars, quite
a tourist I am now&mdash;Any more for Mars? All on board,
please&mdash;all aboard for Mars&mdash;and Jupiter next time,
perhaps? Now for a picture of it, inside a laboratory this time.
You must understand that a lot of what I now tell you has been
supplemented by talks with Lance, who says I am better then he at
earth words because he left his body too soon to learn 'em, so he
gives me information and I am to pass it on. I was too confused
when there to absorb the meanings of what I saw.</p>

<p>"Inside a laboratory then. Opening overhead, clear glass walls
of complete transparency very thick, but there are more sides to it
than you know of, and a bit of a geometrical problem is presented,
as I can't put its geometry into human terms. However, we have
before us a glass tube or cylinder into which emanations from
eruptions are poured. Surrounding it are focus points of light rays
from cosmic sources, and in due succession these are switched on by
some mental process to amalgamate with the emanations. Now comes an
intricate process I can't properly describe, of a sort of melting
down and amalgamating with rays from mental sources to enable
absorption by the Mars forms of life. This takes place on a key
point in the centre of the lab. where many Martian thought-rays are
focused from those needing the absorptive process. That means, I
gather, that if you want, so to speak, 'food', you focus your mind
on this key-point and thereby receive it. The plant life gathers
its own in some other way by absorbing rays direct, but animals
also receive food from these laboratories. There is nothing of life
feeding on life as we do here, and I failed to understand how they
carry on without getting overcrowded, as I suppose they have some
means of increasing life. Now I think of it, I didn't see any
younger or older than others, though some were more advanced and
better equipped mentally. I just don't know about any reproduction
of species, but I don't think there can be anything of that
sort.</p>

<p>"Come a little further on the country side of Mars&mdash;for the
laboratories were grouped into sort of towns. I want to show you a
fountain I have just remembered&mdash;more like a N.Z.
geyser&mdash;which gave out violent jets of coloured liquid of some
sort. Not water, I am sure, but I don't know its chemical make-up.
It was away from much life and they seem to shun it as though not
beneficent like all else there. I thought it beautiful, as it had
such marvellous colours, but they were different to those of the
rays they chiefly use. I saw a Martian go to it for one of our
ray-keys, though, and he seemed very careful not to approach it
without a barrage of health-giving thoughts...</p>

<p>"Another thing of interest was a group of yellow stones of rocks
which were concerned with a form of chemistry other than that in
the labs., I think. The Martians got something off these by
collecting their emanations and combining them with those from
eruptions, doing this against the rocks with glass cylinders for
the purpose. I didn't properly take it all in, of course, but
gather it is for some such purpose. You are busy now, I guess? So
we'll talk later on, perhaps. O.K., Mumsie."</p>

<p><i>(Later.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Are you game for a detailed description of my work? Very
well&mdash;I am opening out new methods of subjugating fear, and
they are pleased with my progress up above. I have trained my squad
to produce the colours required in such rapid succession that they
blend into a harmony of a belt of ray-light round any patient, who
feels the effect in a wholly uplifted mind which harmonises his
etheric more rapidly than rays applied singly. Now I have started a
band of workers to give after care, which is needed in these days
of recurring terrors. How often a brave man has glowed out in
response to our treatment! And the timid ones have gained
self-respect they had nearly lost. I am working in the minds of
French people a good deal now, as they are in need of all the help
they can get. I also come over here more often, to keep an eye on
the fly-fighters and give them a push to guard my family! I can
leave my squad in charge now since they are well trained, and my
second-in-command carries on. My chum Ian&mdash;yes, he wants to
write if you'll allow."</p>

<p><i>(Ian writing.)</i>
</p>

<p>"You are good to let me try again. Your hand comes easier
to-day. May I tell you about my work too? I am only a ray-bringer
still, slower than Chris, but have got on in power-giving and can
sometimes help him out with a case requiring forceful treatment. I
go over unnecessary paper in my scrawl, I see, not small writing
like Chris. Can I come again?"</p>

<p><i>Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"Ian finds it exhausting because he can't tap your mind to the
extent I can yet. We are wanted back at our posts so must go. So
long, Mumsie."</p>

<p><i>August 3rd, 1944. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"O Mumsie, I am so happy to be with you all again and chatting
to you on my birthday as if we were all boys again. Lance is coming
and wants to have a talk now."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot.</i>
</p>

<p>"Hello, Mum, here I am on Chris's birthday&mdash;LOVE TO ALL my
FAMILY. I want you to know about my new work of growth-maintenance,
it is EVER so important...I get away from earth conditions and test
spiritual power accumulating in various stations on earth by
passing crown rays through them which give off a sensitive light
and show me how much power is stored there for use for spiritual
growth of mankind. It gains in strength every time I do this and
the power-station is giving out help for good in man's struggle all
the time. I love to help in the maintenance of power for good,
because it is so important a help for the war and all man is doing
now. You will see a great development in outlook of people soon, as
we get the growth centres working full swing.</p>

<p>"I am SO HAPPY to be Home again and with Chris on his birthday,
and love to write for Mum like old times...</p>

<p>"Now I want to speak to my Father and give him all sorts of
love. I used to want him to be proud of me as his son and I do
still, so tell him to give me his blessing and I shall go happy to
my work of bringing new light to mankind. I am one of the LIGHT
BEARERS, you see, and have great powers for helping others now. I
am still EVER your LOVING LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"Lance has finished, so I'll have my little say, to give you my
birthday greeting and tell you how happy I am now. All my life I
wanted to be able to accomplish something to express my inner self,
and now I am given power to do that more than I knew could be
possible. I am not selfish any more because I know now how to
fulfil my desire to be expressed. Not by wanting acclamation on my
own account, but by giving such service to others that I earn their
gratitude and thanks. All my efforts are successful now because I
work in power not my own and for a purpose not my own. Yes, Mumsie
darling, I am happier than I ever thought could be. No more
discouragement and failure but a strong certainty of success in all
I undertake because it is done in the Power of God and for His
sake. I am nineteen years old to-day, and but for death would be
barely starting my life's work, but in this infinitely fuller life
I am doing work such as no human man could grasp or
undertake&mdash;grand work, great work for men and for God. I want
to tell my Dad that I am fulfilling all he can have hoped of me,
and look forward to his praise when he comes here and sees it in
reality. All I wish is for him to know how I love him and want his
praise and to earn a 'well done' from my Dad.</p>

<p>"You are telling Dave about my work, I hope? I would like him to
feel I am with him often and enjoying his hols. so much too. He is
often aware of me but does not like to say so in case it should be
untrue and only imagination. Tell him I know when he feels I am
with him and I appreciate his reticence about it&mdash;much better
say nothing till he is more sure of me, but I hope he will realise
my comings and goings more clearly soon...</p>

<p>"Can I tell you a few anecdotes of the fairy life here? A lot of
fairies of the lighter sort&mdash;little shining ones&mdash;were
taking torches up a tree, they looked so tiny in the great big tree
like little dewdrops in the sun making sparkles. They moved
spirally up the trunk in a long train of lights till they reached a
hole into which they all went to light it up. I can't fathom their
ideas, if they have any, but they are so pretty and seem to love
lighting up the trees. Then I saw another sort of fairy, the
lovely, dainty, flower fairies on tiny heather bells. They held a
sort of council on the stalks, sitting at the bases of the leaves
and gesticulating to each other. Can't describe them&mdash;very
like their flower and same colour usually, but quite collectively
different. I mean each flower has a completely different kind of
fairy, not only colour but form. Colour of flower, form different
every time, always a separate life to the plant, though, and with
more intelligence apparently of a low order. O no, not like tiny
people, some of the gnomes are, but not fairies, so far as I have
seen. I am longing to show you, when you get on clairvoyantly a
bit. O, you will, when you get your etheric eyes open.</p>

<p>"Shall we stop talking, and I'll show Lance some of my special
old haunts here, such as the old beech and the cow lodge where we
got messed up?</p>

<p>"So long, Mumsie, and love to family all. Chris."</p>

<p><i>August 13th. (Conversation between Christopher and David.
David asked questions aloud and watched R.'s pencil for
Christopher's answers.)</i>
</p>

<p>"David wants to know how much we over here see the electric
currents before they make contact. We can't see ordinary
electricity in batteries, but we see waves of all sorts making
contacts possible. Electric waves are visible as pervading all
things, and electric dynamos are just contact vehicles. I mean
electricity is contacted by them for human purposes, but they only
give off what was always there visibly to us. Your mind isn't
accustomed to the terms I want to use, Mumsie, so it's a bit
difficult to get it through, but Dave will understand if you tell
him that generating a current of electricity doesn't make any
difference in my life, as the electric waves pervade everything and
are fully visible to me. The dynamo just makes the electric waves
available in your life, that's all. I don't think he can establish
contact with us that way, more likely by means of radio-magnetic
waves. Magnetism is nearer the approach by means of the human
ectoplasm, which seems the only available means so far. I wish he
could produce a radio communigraph, to use a word coined recently
by a friend of Lord Dowding's I heard him talk about. Their
instrument is not much good, I hear, from our side, but there is an
opening on more magnetic lines for some such thing. We'll use it
all right if he produces it some day, tell him. I use magnetic
radio-waves on telepathic message work, but have to have a
responding instrument such as a brain at the reception end. Given a
receptive instrument which could record these, and we might get
messages through by mechanical means which would convince even
scientists!</p>

<p>"I must go now. Will you let me talk this evening again after 9
p.m. chimes?"</p>

<p><i>9.10 p.m. (David holding a magneto.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Came a bit late, I'm afraid. Now, David, what is your
contraption?</p>

<p><i>(D. "Do you see any effect when I use this?")</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, you make waves in the magnetic field or what you call,
round your bit of ether. Go on, this interests me&mdash;go
on&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>(D. "Do you see heat?")</i>
</p>

<p>"What? Yes, I get you. Heat is not felt by our bodies, but seen
by our organs of vision as radiation. Yes, I think I can see all
these wave propulsions of heat, magnetism, and so on, as waves of
radiation. Yes, get a magnet if you can." <i>(D. went to fetch
one.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Note.&mdash;Dad was playing Beethoven piano sonatas.)</i>
</p>

<p>"You are good to let us bother you with all this, Mumsie. I can
see Dad's music in your lovely mind making curves of colour in
wonderful rhythm. You are so much in tune with him and music.</p>

<p><i>David came back with a large and a small magnet.</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, I can see a blue light round the little one, and a
dim&mdash;I can't give you the colour, you haven't a word for
it&mdash;round the other&mdash;quite a different colour.</p>

<p>"Heat and Light? Well, there are so many different kinds of heat
and light, but all sorts of colours get mixed up in both. They are
quite a different range of colours, though. Heat colours are deeper
and stronger, but not so bright and radiant. Light has every sort
of colour in it, and we have so many different kinds of light here.
Many more than you. Cosmic light is quite above your range of known
rays, and most of our colours are in that, not the same as colours
in your light. I'm talking of cosmic light, not cosmic rays, you
know. I am not an expert and don't understand either, but I can see
and hear the cosmic vibrations which are beyond your range
altogether."</p>

<p><i>(D. "How does magnetism differ?")</i>
</p>

<p>"Magnetism differs in degree of wavelength, but not so different
as wireless is from light, I think, but I don't know, except that I
see their colours differently, so I know they must have different
vibrations."</p>

<p><i>(</i>R. <i>"Are you uncertain?")</i></p>

<p>"Yes, I was, but I think I grasp what Dave is aiming at. My
training has been so intensively on fear waves that I have not
grasped much of the non-human vibrations. Human vibrations are
slower than light, but etheric bodies vibrate much faster than
earth bodies."</p>

<p><i>(D. "At what rate does yours vibrate?")</i>
</p>

<p>"I should say it vibrates at approximately the heat rate which
is slower than light, I think. I am not sure about these things
because I see them without calculation and never think of comparing
speeds. I am keen to tell Dave all he wants, but am such an
ignoramus on these points.</p>

<p>"Human emotional vibrations are slow compared to electrically
stimulated waves and could easily affect an instrument if one could
be made with that rate of vibration. I am not scientist enough to
say what the rate is, but it is a slower rate than light, I can
see. Can we absorb our own emotions?"&mdash;(Pause)&mdash;"Sorry,
Mumsie, I was called off on an emergency case. Now, Dave, carry on
with your queries. Are my vibrations carrying over to you now? I am
vibrating energetically on purpose to see if you can feel it. You
aren't developed in your etheric body yet, but it will grow like
Topsy, as they say&mdash;yes&mdash;Not <i>our</i> Topsy, stupid.
<i>(Topsy was the boy's pony.)</i> Now, can you test my vibratory
powers with your magneto? See if it opens more juice."</p>

<p><i>(David produced sparks from the magneto, saying, "Now
vibrate," when he did so.)</i>
</p>

<p>"No, I can't affect it enough for your dense vision, I'm afraid.
I think I could if I vibrate above my normal rate."</p>

<p><i>(D. "Now vibrate more.")</i>
</p>

<p>"I'm having a hectic time trying to get a pitch of vibration
which will satisfy Dave! Dave, old boy, it's a bit tiring for you.
Let's have another go at it when I next come. I think your powers
of sensing vibrations don't come on to quite the same plane as
mine, for I thought I was affecting your magneto quite a lot, but
it seemed all the same to you. I must go. Old boy, we'll try again.
Goodnight."</p>

<p><i>August 17th, 1944. (Sitting on the terrace watching the
swallows.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Can we have a minute to join the birds in the air? Yes, I'm
with you, darling. You are not up to Mars, but can go a bit in the
air with me. I came to-night for a bit of refreshment after a
strenuous fight.</p>

<p>"Swallows are feeling their wings for a long flight, and have
happy thoughts of exciting things ahead. They cannot understand why
they go, but are glad to be away and have lovely rejoicing in their
power of flight. Come with me up there, Mumsie. I can support your
etheric on will-power." <i>(A minute or two mentally among
swallows.)</i></p>

<p><i>(David came to ask questions.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I'll do my best, but I'm better at etheric than
electric power."</p>

<p><i>(D. asked a question.)</i>
</p>

<p>"O dear, have I made a muddle of it? I'm trying too. Magnetism
is slower vibration than heat, I think, because magnetism makes a
field of force."&mdash;<i>(D. interrupted.)</i>&mdash;"You be
quiet, Dave, and let me get out my side of it! Magnetism makes a
field of force, and heat goes off in waves which produce further
currents beyond their immediate source. I see them as vibrations of
light of a deeper colour than your visible light-rays, and
magnetism has very dark rays of vibrations."</p>

<p><i>(D. "The slower, the deeper in colour?")</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so, that seems to be the rule. I can talk better
on human waves than the others, but I gather you want what I mean
by electrically stimulated waves? I meant all waves of electric
origin, such as <i>non-</i>human waves mostly are."</p>

<p><i>(D. "Wireless?")</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I meant wireless because wireless is non-human.
I am not sure that human waves are as slow as wireless waves,
though. Now let's think it out&mdash;you confuse me by asking about
things I haven't thought out at all. We are tapping human
vibrations all the time here, but not those others which just seem
like nice colours to us. Your vibrations respond to other waves
which excite your mind and quicken or get slower as your emotions
dictate, so I can't tell you where human vibrations come in the
scale of wavelengths. I think we have greater range than you
think."</p>

<p><i>(D. "Could we change our rate of vibration?")</i>
</p>

<p>"No, because you function through a limiting vehicle, the body
and brain, which bottles up your powers of vibrating. I think man
can function on any wave-length he pleases once he is free of his
body&mdash;but he can't make you denser people respond. I can
generate waves but not perceptible to your senses, you need such a
coarse contraption that I can't get down to that pitch. Only people
like Mumsie come a bit out of their coarse sense, and feel our
signals. But don't be disheartened, we'll get a sort
of&mdash;<i>(D. interrupted.)</i>&mdash;You get signals from us,
some of your radio have already, but they get frightened and think
they are getting blingey or something." <i>(Question from D.)</i>
"No, because it isn't a fine enough&mdash;I think it has only been
done on a&mdash;What I mean is one of the big sets for listening to
radio from America and Australia. Sets they use for trans-Atlantic
broadcasts. I don't know enough about this, Dave. I think it's a
bit too much for you, Mumsie, to grapple with words you don't
understand. Dave, old boy, I mean the short wave sets, I think, but
anyhow the messages got through from our side came about in the
trans-Atlantic messages and were mysteriously baffling to the
B.B.C. people, who just put them down to atmospheric interferences
or something."</p>

<p><i>(D. "Were they in English?")</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, they were, that's why the B.B.C. were so puzzled, but they
didn't like to say they couldn't trace them to any known source so
left them unexplained. I think we could tap your set if you got a
very powerful short wave one. Now I must go, fear I haven't been
much use to you, Dave, but I never had a flair for that kind of
thing and my work is all on human vibrations now." <i>(D.
question.)</i> "Yes, I think when you are crying for instance, your
emotional uprush is intensely fast and the same if you are
intensely happy." <i>(D. "Then do both emotions look the same to
you?" Can you tell the difference?")</i> "Don't be silly, of course
you can, their colours are at&mdash;Sadness is great waves
of&mdash;no good, it's a colour you can't see&mdash;but dull.
Happiness is shining like light." <i>(D. question.)</i> "No, both
can be fast or slow according to the intensity with which they are
generated."</p>

<p><i>August 20th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Only a short talk to-day, I was afraid I should have to miss it
altogether. I am due back to a meeting of light-ray workers and
mustn't miss it on any account. I thought you'd expect me so had to
come to explain, but will come for a nice long talk on a weekday,
as I think you are less tired by chores and I'm freer, too. Must
look up light waves, electric and so forth, for Dave's information
as so far I have worked on human vibrations almost entirely and
those waves which affect human emotions such as fear. I am keen to
help on the scientific means of communication all I can though, so
I'll see if I can get a bit more informed and give him a better
idea of conditions our side.</p>

<p>"Communication is coming they say, definitely, but not for some
time probably, as so few people are yet ready for it. It is only
safe for those who are spiritually minded really, and so few yet
are, owing to church narrowness and other circumstances. Now I must
go, my best beloved Mother&mdash;see you later this week. Your
CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>August 23rd. (Ian M&mdash;writing.</i> R. <i>had just heard a
flying bomb crash, and wondered "How much longer will this go
on?")</i></p>

<p><i>Ian</i>
</p>

<p>"Only a week more and coast will be won. I came to find your son
Christopher, but he is at work. I am his chum Ian, and take a
holiday after much strenuous work. Must stop."</p>

<p><i>Note.&mdash;August 23rd was Wednesday. The following Monday
we first heard that troops were being massed for attack on the
coastal flying bomb sites, and by the Wednesday the greater part of
the Normandy coast was taken and the fly-bomb sites which sent them
over East Sussex were in our hands.</i>
</p>

<p><i>September 2nd. 1944</i>
</p>

<p>"Your many chores are done now, so I thought we might converse
just a bit. I am after getting a line on the doodles and
accompanying our troops to their dens. Not launching sites but the
storage places behind. We are fairly on their tails now, and no
time to bring them forward to launch as we are too close for
safety. Our Tommies are full of the zest for victory and would be
chasing too far but for discipline&mdash;unwillingly obeying orders
to camp for the night, longing to be up and at 'em again. The
colours of hope are spreading far ahead of our advance and many
countries are awakening from a nightmare. I see battles ahead in
them too, but hope is glowing like a lamp in all. I am too hard at
work to study general reactions, but saw all this in a bird's eye
view of Europe as I rose above into upper air for refreshment
to-day.</p>

<p>"Can you believe in my new powers? I can hardly realise I have
grown so great, for I see now over Europe as a small field of
vision and at will I see into another hemisphere. My own Mother, I
am still at heart the son you love. I am surprised that you are so
longing for me as I used to be. I am nearer to you now and so much
happier. I am much happier because I am aware of my own smallness
before, and so I can see how I improve.</p>

<p>"I want to give a bit of time to spreading the work of my book
as soon as it gets printed, so get on with it Mumsie, for the war
will soon be over and we must get our joint work under way."</p>

<p><i>September 10th and 16th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Now, Mumsie, I am longing to tell you my adventures in a trip
to the Moon I have just come back from. Lance took me as he had
business there of some light-ray kind, and I am full of surprise at
the ease with which one can get there and back, just like a trip to
Wales or something. Moon-beams are very good for my work, so I was
glad to see the source of their healing properties, which lies in
the etheric radiance of the moon; not light you see but other
unseen rays."</p>

<p>"Zero temperature, so no life because nothing protects from
sun's rays&mdash;no atmosphere at all. I am talking on the moon you
see. Crimson rocks of alabaster or some such thing, much deeper
colour than any we have here&mdash;many kinds of precious stones I
should imagine, but being in the rough I didn't know enough to make
them out. Mountain ranges are very fine when seen close, and many
columns of some stalactite origin, or so I supposed. We searched
everywhere for the special ray-key I came for, and found several
but they depend on the curvature of the hills and are not easy to
spot at first. I was thrilled at the strangeness of a dead world
with no life on it, and it gave a sense of loneliness I have never
felt before. I loved being there as an adventure, but should not
like to stay there long as one would begin to feel cut off from all
one loves. Magnetic forces are frequent, we came across a magnetic
centre every step it seemed, yet not powerful enough to make
contact with earth I imagine. Dave would enjoy that side of it, and
would soon tell you all about these. I came across some aquamarine
I think, clear blue-green stones, lovely colour. Clear golden brown
rock, colour of amber, was quite frequent and unrelated to earth,
but more coloured I think because not overgrown with vegetable
matter.</p>

<p>"I am too far advanced now for talk about gnomes and fairies,
but can see them if I come back in earth-form again. I have left my
earth-form now, and only fetch it up with an effort of will if I
need it. I can't describe my present appearance which is
conditioned by my thoughts and will, but I can always appear
earthly again if I want to. I only need it for my work if none of
my junior helpers are handy, when I appear to one of my cases in
human form to re-assure them. Otherwise I am free of all air and
space, and glory in my freedom.</p>

<p>"I am not coming so often now in this way because I have higher
work and can't come to your sphere so often, but that means that I
am still with you and working for your work, only not in so human a
manner as this. Lance and I are hand in hand now, and will talk
from time to time but not so often as before. I am going to be with
Dave a bit now, so bye bye Mumsie darling. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>September 19th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Now, my Mumsie, I want to take you with me to a camp of
ray-workers in the Swiss border mountains. We get special
conditions in Swiss air for our many colour rays to clear the
patients minds. Come up the mountain&mdash;I don't know its
name&mdash;and on to a fine glacier where we placed our camp for
the penetration of rays into our central column. I have a squad of
colour experts at work there to combine with earth radiation the
moon ray-keys I brought back and produce a soft healing ray of
great power. I had a patient from the French fighting there and he
grew splendidly strong in courage and was hoping to give his pals a
helping hand soon. He was dead, of course, he couldn't have come to
our camp otherwise, but we send helpers out to the battlefield from
there all the time to help living men who are frightened, too. It
seems silly to call them living and the others dead, but you know
what I mean by that. I want you to visualise a green belt of
radiance within which we work, and then soft rainbow columns
arching from that into a centre of power-keys which keep renewing
the light. I send a collector of colours to fetch in a patient
leaving his body in a state of fear&mdash;he draws him away from
the scene of fear and brings him into our radiance which soothes
his wounded etheric and he gradually opens his eyes, when we are
there to guide his mind to peace. Soon he realises this is a new
life and all fear ceases&mdash;then he wants to tell the others,
and we use him to fetch our guide when they need help. I was used
in that way at first when I began&mdash;long ago it seems now. I
can't explain much of it because your mind can't take it in and
there are no words. I must go, Mumsie, they call me."</p>

<p><i>September 20th. (Lancelot.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(R. "Is it Lancelot?")</i> "Yes, Mum DARLING. I came to give
you a message but shall stay and enjoy the fun! The message was
from Uncle Toby to say he is obliged to go over to another plane so
he is leaving Kitopher, making him responsible for his own camp and
all his work now. He is awfully pleased with Kitopher's progress
and told me to tell you that he leaves him to carry on with full
confidence in him. He says he will hope to be back in time for your
Christmas party which we are all looking forward to so much.</p>

<p>"Now I am off to show Aunt E&mdash;the way to plan her girl
guides party. She is a trainer of young girls now to act as guides
for newcomers, and is so happy doing this becos she feels so useful
and needed. Au revoir Dad and David and Mum, and God Bless you from
LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>September 27th. 6 p.m.</i>
</p>

<p>"Your mind is so clear now, shall we be adventurous and go to
Mars again? I shall love to give you another picture of the life on
that planet, and I can be positive now about many things I was not
sure of previously&mdash;for instance, I have been told since we
went there that mechanism exists for the transfusion of life from
one individual to another if one of their bodies is destroyed by an
accident, so that it can be repaired and the life restored to it
when ready. Just like repairing a garment or something over here. I
can't understand how they go on meantime though, but it seems that
two inhabit the same body temporarily.</p>

<p>"Come along Mumsie, let's have a walk in the Martian valleys; we
went up a mountain before I think. We crawl under or fly over
enormous bag-like plants of weird shapes which can't be pictured by
your mind. A thing of the animal class comes galloping along and we
compare his agility with the colossal growth of the static plants.
He tosses them about, but they gather again just as before and
appear to enjoy the experience. The animal is off again to another
point, and all over the place they are careering about. We crawl
underneath these living lumps and find numerous gnome-like beings
all busy sucking juices or emanations of the plants&mdash;not
sucking, that suggests our eating, but imbibing in some other way I
can't describe.</p>

<p>"Now we rise above these giant growths and see over them a
wonderful canopy of thought-colours woven from their minds. I can't
tell you what they think because all their ideas are as
incomprehensible to you as yours would be to them, but they weave
wonderful patterns of colour above them, rising from their
thoughts. As we go on, a Martian approaches and beckons to us, so
we follow where he leads&mdash;far into a jungle of plant life till
we reach a stretch of bare rock with bands of marvellous colours.
These he clamps a curious contrivance on to, which I can't describe
as it won't go into words, and the rock seems to release a colour
of a new sort combining all its former colours into a totally new
one. The Martian withdraws his contrivance and the rock remains as
before but the new colour is filling the contrivance and is carried
into a laboratory where it is used in some way. Having observed
this we proceed up our valley, where the life gets thinner as we go
up, till we can walk instead of crawling or flying. Between the
plants is bare rock of crimson or gold. Now an animal comes jumping
over our heads, and making gigantic leaps makes for higher ground
where crowds of his fellows are madly jumping in a sort of game I
suppose. As we emerge on to higher ground the plants cease
altogether, and a stretch of bare rock lies between us and another
range with other valleys.</p>

<p>"Can you take a little more? I am so reminiscent to-day&mdash;I
was not sure how to spell that word and you refused to think it for
me! One thing more we see on our tour. Coloured contours of the
hills are so beautiful as we emerge from our valley. I want you to
gaze at them a moment. <i>(An interruption.)</i> Yes, it's a bore,
but I must go now anyhow&mdash;au revoir. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>September 30th.</i>
</p>

<p>"I was waiting to give you a message from Lance, who is on a
journey to Neptune again, and wants me to tell you that it will be
some time before he can come to see you. He is an important person
now as our celestial light-bearer, which means a bearer of light to
other planets or even stars, I gather, although I am still too
young in spirit to grasp all it means. He wanted you to know he had
gone so that you didn't expect him here.</p>

<p>"Mumsie, shall I tell you about my work? I am on quarter-deck
duty as Uncle Toby calls it, meaning taking command in the
captain's absence, so I am very careful what I do as he will be
seriously displeased if I mess things up. I am ever so proud that
he thinks I am capable of carrying on by myself, but a little
nervous of the responsibility."</p>

<p>R. <i>"You carry on bravely."</i></p>

<p>"Yes, that's what he said and I'm doing it&mdash;as bravely as I
can. I am looking forward to his return though, I can tell you. I
have a group of camps under me, including my own of course, and
take the leading part in conferences between the camp commanders,
so I have to decide on special lines of action to be taken by the
group as a whole. I am very diffident of making any big move till
Uncle Toby gets back, so I expect he'll say I have been slack! I
hope to earn his praise but it isn't easy, he never praises unless
he really feels it is due...You are so loving, Mumsie, you only see
my best side ever...Yes, I know I can do it if my will is set on
doing right and I don't think of my own smallness. I am so much
better able to understand that now...You are so understanding and
sweet, Mumsie mine...Only very weak, but strong in God's work
because of His power. I understand now all you tried to tell me
before, and I was so stupid in my earth-form, but now I see as I
never saw before, and all is glowing with the power of God and with
Love. Yes, darling, you have brought back my true knowledge. I was
thinking myself back in my human limitations, but I know now that I
am imbued with God's power and cannot fail. I must go back to work.
God bless you and Dad darlings, I am much stronger now. Coming
again soon, so be ready for me, Mumsie!"</p>

<p><i>October 8th, 1944. Earlier in the day</i> R. <i>received a
message from her mother.</i></p>

<p>"Granny told me you were so happy and would be clear to-night,
so I came along at a great pace hoping for a good time, but not a
bit of it! All I got was complete neglect. I must be a little
peeved sometimes Mumsie, when I am so badly treated.</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you all sorts of queer happenings in my
sphere. There is complete upheaval of government coming which will
affect all the inspectors of camps, so Uncle Toby will be in a new
sphere of work altogether, and I suppose I shall go too, as I am
his understudy now. It won't make any difference to my help in your
work, which is to increase by strides when my book is published. I
shall merely have a new quarter in which to organise my camps, and
we shall probably be over the Netherlands instead of on the French
Alps.</p>

<p>"Can I tell you of a new notion I have had? When you write to
anyone in grief, tell them how happy I am and make them feel sure
of the great joy it is to leave one's body and come on here. They
ought to feel glad their sons have come here...Carry on over
there&mdash;that is what they ought to feel. I can't express what I
mean, but you understand, Mumsie, and will put it better."</p>

<p><i>October 14th and 15th.</i>
</p>

<p>"November is the month I think for activity from you." R. <i>"Is
it Christopher?"</i> "Yes, Chris of course. I wanted to tell you
that your call to more active work will come in Nov. I am
instructed to close my camp work then and be helping your influence
to spread.</p>

<p>"I came to have a talk and you were so busy I was just going off
again. Yes, I am free all evening, so I'll send a telepath to my
second-in-command that I shan't be back till later. Talk after your
chores are done."</p>

<p><i>Later.</i> "Come on, Mumsie, at last! Can I have your
undivided attention for a bit? I want to try and explain something
about my work which I think you ought to know.</p>

<p>"Grasping a ray-key is a mental concept, not physical. You
imagined us holding on to something with hands, I saw when you were
reading my old letters some days back. We grasp them mentally, just
as you use the word often as in grasping a mathematical problem.
You can grasp your ray-key substantially that way, so that it can't
produce colour other than the one you want of it. Now I want you to
see something of my work you couldn't understand before. I can
grasp my patient's fear and take it from him by so doing. I
couldn't help if I couldn't grasp his trouble, and that is where my
former fears help me, because I am able to grasp what he feels like
and show him the way out...yes, you see what I mean. I am so happy
to see how even my failings can be used.</p>

<p>"I am arranging a Christmas party for you as usual this year,
and hope you will keep the same time free for it as last year when
it was such a success. I don't know yet who can come but hope to
get more than last year. Dave will be there too, which is
jolly.</p>

<p>"Can we go on a bit? Let's have a jaunt to Mars again, shall we?
I have remembered a charming coloured cloud of creatures in a sort
of curious liquid, like water but thinner, yet different to air in
constituents&mdash;I have got tangled up in words again&mdash;this
was different to any earth creation and yet was a liquid of sorts.
The colours in it were marvellous and so were these creatures which
swam in it&mdash;not swam exactly but they were immersed in it and
moving about. Lance saw them before, he says, and told me to look
at them."</p>

<p><i>October 18th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Now I want to say that we are starting a campaign against
Japanese superstitions in the East and some of our supervisors are
going over there."</p>

<p>R. <i>"A lady has written to ask if you can help her little
boy?"</i></p>

<p>"Can I help him? How? Suffers from fear? I see. I'll try to find
him but direction isn't clear. M...? I don't catch name. W...? Yes,
If I find him I'll get our squad to come along and we'll soon get
him right. All right, Mumsie, I'll see what we can do, and I think
I've got directions now you've said M...in Wales. One of your
'cases' as I call 'em. Same idea as me, I guess!...I'll try,
Mumsie, but write and tell his mother to look out for me and give
some calls if she can to Chris Tristram, then I'll have more chance
of finding him. Now I must be off and change guard to see if all
are there, so au revoir. Love to Dad. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>October 24th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I am hoping you will not be tired, as I want to give
you a synopsis of my treatment of little W...I found him quite
easily, his people were thinking splendidly of me and making quite
a wave when I got into their district. He is a clever boy and very
intuitive, but has a deep-seated fear neurosis which I think was in
him from birth, and is slowly coming to the surface of his mind. I
am confident of his conquest over it, but it may take some time as
it has been so deeply embedded, long before he went to school, only
too deep then to appear on the surface. It is slowly rising and has
to be aided to appear or it will again submerge and affect his
later life. I am calculating the amount of motion to apply so that
it will be innocuous when it gets to the surface. He can't yet
absorb ray treatment as this is not an emergency fear as on the
battlefield, but a hereditary sub-conscious tendency. I place
Mary's Healing Ray very near him and he absorbs it as he sleeps.
Soon he will feel its soothing influence and be less
afraid&mdash;but lessons are a terror to him owing to the bullying
instincts of other boys. I suppose he couldn't learn at home for a
time? This fear neurosis will affect him only until adolescence, it
is connected with his astral which emerges at that time. After
puberty he will be completely cured, but only if all possible is
done to help him conquer his fears now. Control of his fear will
prove his great strength in the future as it has proved mine. I am
full of sympathy for him knowing how like his feeling are to mine
of old. I am so glad you called me to help him, and I know I can do
more for him than most people."</p>

<p><i>October 28th and 29th.</i>
</p>

<p>"You are so bright and nice to-day, Mumsie, I hardly expected a
hearing so soon. Came to bring news of Camp exodus, to be on your
trade route in future&mdash;Glory be! I am much pleased to join
your work, darling. My camp is closing as there are very many
others now and I have had my share of that kind of work. Much
remains to be done of course, but not by me as other newcomers are
being worked up to my pitch and are fit to carry on now.</p>

<p>"Your next move in spiritual circles is more apparent here than
in your life&mdash;and depends on contacts made by recipients of
your letters. Their effect is cumulative and gathers impetus all
the time. We see it as a whole here, and the effect is already
great.</p>

<p>"I am coming more often now, so be on the look out for me. My
camp is all dismantled and we wait our orders separately. Mine are
to be over-seeing your activity and giving a push to the minds your
letters are affecting, so be ready for my frequent visits now.</p>

<p>"Charming scene I saw on my way here over a cottage near Battle
I think. Very old crab tree laden with golden apples and many
children collecting them for Granny, who was much loved by all. I
see earth scenes just as clearly, only dominated by the greater
visibility of the etheric world. Granny's thoughts and those of the
children dominated that scene to me. The crab-tree was shimmering
with fairy lights and the apples coloured as if painted in gold.
The cottage I see as a square thickness in a mist, but with many
shades of substance so that I can see the furniture and carpets,
all of different blends of misty colour, through the walls which
are thick mist with many different shades in it. It is a bit
difficult to describe, but you visualise a lot as I talk."</p>

</p>

<p>"That is in your pond, MUM, darling, and I am at your side! Can
you guess why I came? Becos I am to give you a message from Chris
to say he has attended a sance of your friend Mrs. B&mdash;and is
giving her son some lessons in writing with a pencil. She is able
to do this Chris thinks, so will you write and tell her he may be
able to use her hand now. Coo&mdash;I am copying Chris, who uses
funny words like that!&mdash;Come a bit nearer, Mum, darling, and I
will tell you a bit about my work on higher planes. I am intensely
happy in it, and have attained great new powers which I can use to
defeat evil and protect those attacked by it. I am co-operating
with other beings from our planets and am man's representative in
some of their inter-planet councils...I use your knowledge of words
that's why I spell so well now! Not like my funny little scrawls at
first.</p>

<p>"Chris may come to-morrow but thought you'd wonder why he didn't
come, so I said I would tell you.</p>

<p>"I was trying to draw a creature I saw over in Neptune, but it
isn't good a bit. I don't draw so well as I used to, I'm afraid.
Now I must go over to Mercury for a conference, so goodbye for a
bit, WITH LOVE from LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>November 16th. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, you are quite transformed to-day, I can see into your
mind like clear water full of living thoughts. I want to be
introspective and tell you how my mind now sees GOD. I cast out a
thought and He gives it life and I see my thought as an actual
living thing. He is all Life and is creating in us and in all
things, and no confusion or wrong can affect LIFE in reality.
Confusion exists because minds are growing all the time and try to
understand before they can. They send out contrary thoughts and
cause confusion, but all is resolved into harmony with GOD. I know
we are taught this in earth religions sometimes but that is
different to taking it into one's being as a truth. My life is all
a great harmony now in tune with GOD. God sends me power to live
and He is my life and the life of all. Candle power is mine, others
are suns or moons, but all are given light from Him..."</p>

<p><i>(Dad asked "Do insects have etheric life?")</i>
</p>

<p>"Dad wants to know if insects are real? I mean real in our sense
of living here. I think bees have a sort of over-soul bee, who
gives them their hive instinct, but I don't see them here much. No
other insects except butterflies, and they have been given
existence because many people created them by desire. Ants have an
over-soul I believe, but not in our life, only in the etheric like
plants. I think one may suppose the insect world to have refused
further evolution in preferring a life of antagonism to other
creatures. Created with all possibilities open they racially chose
antagonism, and only bees and ants have evolved sufficiently to
produce a generic over-soul for their species. I don't know much
about the subject though, as I have never inquired into insects at
all. Dad is so hopeful of me always, but I really don't know much
yet, though I am growing fast in spirit as I can tell by the way I
now see other&mdash;<i>(An interruption in his writing).</i> Yes,
we were interrupted by Mrs. Y&mdash;, she is a dear old lady, just
come here to this life and still thinks herself old and feeble. I
gave her directions to find the rest centre where guides will take
charge of her&mdash;though she really should be able to do without
them now, she has passed over six months or so.</p>

<p>"Let's go out together and I'll help Dad in the garden I'm
taking an afternoon off, having been hard at it for some
time..."</p>

<p><i>November 24th.</i>
</p>

<p>"You are coming nearer than usual to-night, Mumsie, but you
appear worried at the pencil? Now for a chat over my music, I
thought I had explained it so well but you seem still very
mystified. I concentrate mind-force through a cylinder which takes
mental vibrations, and according to my meaning the vibration
produces notes in harmony. We have glorious concerts like nothing
you can imagine, for all our minds tune in to the same score of
music written in parts just like earth music, Galumpshus!&mdash;I
used the word and failed to spell it!&mdash;Anyhow,
good&mdash;super&mdash;supest&mdash;supernal. I don't know how to
express it! Our concerts sound just like earth music only better,
but are produced by concentrating thought on the score.</p>

<p>"Your letter to Mrs. A&mdash;interests me. Your answer is all
she needs, I couldn't explain as well as those books." <i>(Mrs.
A&mdash;had sent a list of questions.)</i> "I can't put it nearly
as well as you can, Mumsie, so go on writing, don't ask me."</p>

<p><i>Q. "Why do mediums so often have Red Indian Guides?"</i>
</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "I can't think! My own impression is that they, the
Red Indians, have been more anxious to practise control of the
human mind by psychic methods and not spiritual enough to
understand influencing in higher ways."</p>

<p><i>Q. "How have they a perfect knowledge of the English
language?"</i>
</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "That's easy, they use the knowledge possessed by the
medium's brain."</p>

<p><i>Q. "How do guides discover their mediums?"</i>
</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "O how absurd! If one is on the look-out for a brain
to control one can see the possibilities at once by the type of
mind and thoughts given out."</p>

<p><i>Q. "How can the medium be sure that her guides are not
earth-bounders?"</i>
</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "She can't, there's the danger, but she can make her
own mind so bright that earth-bounders can't come into her aura. We
only can bear the light we are accustomed to and the higher we rise
the more light we can bear and emit. So low spirits can only get
near earth-bound minds, and often find a medium quite low enough
for their purposes, more's the pity."</p>

<p><i>Q. "What stage of development do the spirits of elderly
people return to when they die?"</i>
</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "You see that, but I should put it like this. An
elderly body is not an elderly spirit&mdash;the spirit may be
merely an infant or hardly developed, or even obscured altogether.
The mind is what emerges and forms its own body according to its
inner compulsion, that is, what it thinks it is like."</p>

<p><i>Note by R.M.T.</i>
</p>

<p><i>I will just add that most people begin the new life as old as
when they died, and gradually realising that they needn't be old,
they become young again! As they grow into the use of their new
powers they recapture their youth in full vigour, but with all the
experience of wisdom and age added. Later, they leave their
earth-form and enter the freedom and radiance of spirit life.</i>
</p>

<p><i>November 26th. Christopher.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want to give you a picture in your mind of our surroundings
at this moment. You are encircled in a belt of many-coloured light,
result of your merry thoughts of my playfulness. Only a fraction of
your real self is here, all your higher part is in a glory which
dazzles even my present capacity for sight. You sit on your terrace
within your belt of colour with a connecting ray from your higher
self streaming from above in glory. I am conscious of it but may
not see it yet. You are now sending a shaft of golden love to me
and it makes me draw nearer and feel I am your child after all and
can be protected in your strength and power like a baby with its
mother. I am so happy to be yours and Dad's. Now Lance has a word
to say..."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mum darling. I am very near you today and having a so JOLLY
holiday with Chris. Has he told you about our surprise for you? I
won't say either, so it WILL be a surprise. You will know by
Christmas Day&mdash;YES, you have guessed but not all!</p>

<p>"DARLING, I want to try and give you an idea of our hopes for
ENGLAND. Can you see it as a whole being? ENGLAND as one spirit not
a lot of people? I see such a great light springing up through
knowledge of God and His Love in sending so much help from our life
to yours. More people will turn to Him in heart and your work is to
spread His guidance as you are doing. You have a great work, but
you will not see it all on your life, it is more visible to us than
on earth. ENGLAND is a power for raising mankind into greater
knowledge of GOD, and you are part of this power, so you see how
far beyond your earth-life it goes. I am working for ENGLAND too,
and helping work you are not yet able to see in your mind. Michael
is my great helper in a sphere I can't reach even yet.</p>

<p>"Is my turn over, Chris?"</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Mumsie Mine, I am so happy! I want you to
have a time like this on Christmas Day when we can join in all the
Christmas fun. You arrange it if you can. Now let's be on earth a
bit and chat about this lovely place with all its fairy life going
on in the wood and pond. I can see them lighting up now for some
concourse of fairies and all the bushes are hung with lights of
many colours sparkling like jewels. I wish you could see them!
Collecting dewdrops on the moss underneath the dead leaves are
gnomes of all sorts with tiny bags of sort of cobweb which they
fill with moisture and then carry off to their underground homes. I
think they use it for drink but can't see clearly enough, as that
life is not so clear now I am further into light. It still shows
when I want to be earthly though&mdash;you see we can always come
back over the way we have been, though we can't rise until fit for
it. I am getting on so well that I can almost grasp Lance's
position now of Celestial Light-bearer, which is a higher grade
than most of those I can know personally as yet. Uncle Toby is a
Great Spirit, but he was so fond of me that he took care not to be
too bright for my earth sight so as to help me on.</p>

<p>"Lance and I are going to give you a Christmas treat so I hope
you'll be as nice and quiet as you are to-day&mdash;we do so love
our talks with Mumsie darling. No, I shan't say what it is, that
will come later. Going now as you ought to be active again. Come
later if you are able? Evening best I think, so au revoir till
then. CHRIS and LANCELOT LOVE to DARLING DAD. GOD BLESS BOTH.</p>

<p><i>(Evening.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "I saw that out climbing with Chris today, we
went overhead to the cloud layers and creatures of upper air were
climbing on the top of them. My drawing is not so good as it used
to be I think, but I will try another one.</p>

<p><br><br>
"Something like that and very fierce after the softer ones. It is a
grabber of little soft ones like</p>

<p>"They have all sorts of shapes and sizes but mostly very flimsy
and soft, and all along the upper air layers you get them in bands.
Chris was keen to study their ways so we went along looking for new
ones, and saw one quite different.</p>

</p>

<p>"I can't get it quite right, it was much more complicated than
the others. Now I'll let Chris come."</p>

<p><br><br>
<i>Christopher:</i> "My Mumsie, we have had such a jolly holiday
Lance and I and just enjoyed ourselves like boys again. I was so
interested in the upper air life which is all in the etheric plane
and not visible to your sight, but not in our life either. It is
worlds within worlds of life, and no one in body life can imagine
the multitudes of life-forms there are even in our planet. Give me
your hand for a little excursion on the level of the upper cloud
layers. Clouds have a solidity you cannot imagine in the etheric
plane, they seem more substantial than crust of earth and harbour a
vast population which drifts about overhead while earth spins under
them. All are small beings except a few balloon-like monsters, and
many of them prey on each other...They belong to the mist sprites
and foam fairies, all being formed out of the vapours of water, but
they have a definite life of their own not just vapour shapes.
Those which seize others seem to suck them dry and then they
disappear altogether. It is queer and dreamy and not very active,
but quite real and most interesting to watch. Some of the more
active ones were calling to each other in sort of bell-like cries
like a church bell single note heard far off. Others cry like sheep
only fainter and softer."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Chris says he only wants a last word, so I
will try another drawing before we go. That is a fairly good
drawing of one of those Chris was talking about which gives a
bell-like cry. They are harmless and nice with colours of all
sorts, pearly and glowing. I think we must say GOODNIGHT to DAD and
MUM from LANCELOT with LOVE."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "I want just to add that I go to work again
to-morrow, so give me instructions if you want anything done. I
have so enjoyed our holidays and our talks with my Mumsie darling.
Give Dad my love and duty and say I am so glad of his loving
thoughts sometimes&mdash;he is such a help to me. Nightie night
darlings.&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>December 8th and 10th, 1944.</i>
</p>

<p>"I want you to write to Mrs. B&mdash;and tell her she is
collecting a crowd of gnomes by being too accessible. She ought to
be careful to feel sure her son is with her before she tries to
write for him. He can't always come at the time she has told him
because he is at school and going in for training in help for
others, so she must not write unless she is sure he is with
her."</p>

<p>(R. <i>"What do the gnomes do?"</i>)</p>

<p>"The gnomes? Oh they just buzz round and play with her pencil,
so that she thinks her son is trying to write but can't manage it,
and then she tries all the harder. She has psychic powers which are
developing but needs more spirit consciousness like yours. Her son
says she might think of a signal for him to give her, when she
begins so that she will know for certain."</p>

and had to be destroyed.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Can we have a chat about my cat? I had to leave her at the
office when I came to do your work, but she wanted me so badly that
I carried her along and installed her with you." (R. <i>"I can't
give her milk.")</i> "Of course not, she is an etheric cat, not at
all an ordinary one! And now she has got a mate thanks to the trap
episode the other day. I never saw a cat so pleased as she when
that nice young Tom came along. She knows I come here often so is
quite content, and adores the Tom in a most sickly fashion. So all
is well in the cat line!</p>

<p>"You aren't very bright to-day." (R. <i>"I have a

during which</i> R<i>'s headache disappeared.)</i> "Your light came
out like a flash of lightening, I was almost blinded by it. Now
Dave, old chap, going on fine, I'm sure, getting ready to contact
me on the Q. wave of ether? Many happy returns home to Dave, and
preparations for a swell Christmas going forward on both sides of
life. Huge preparations on my side I assure you, we're going to
have a real slap up party this time, I hope."</p>

<p><i>(Later.)</i> "Continuing our talk, what about my descent on
your head at tea-time? Why, you meant to tell Dad and never did."
(R. <i>"Did you want me to?")</i> "Yes, because you so clearly saw
me, and that's twice to-day Mumsie, you are getting on finely and
will soon be properly clairvoyante. I am so pleased. Many people
could if they only would distinguish their etheric vision from
imagination. You are beginning to do so quite well but most people
are too afraid of deceiving themselves and there-fore never open
their etheric eyes till death. I've been away a bit off and on to
see how people are getting on with my work in France, and my
successor was rather glad of a few hints from me. I am transferred
to the English Crusade now in order to help you all I can. Uncle
Toby is in the crusade but in another quarter and I don't see so
much of him as before...</p>

<p>"Can I be a bit curious about E&mdash;'s children? They aren't
at all like other children but have minds which tune in to our life
easily so that they both see clairvoyantly already. I am puzzled as
to how they fit in at school since they are so different in their
minds. Clear vision is quite unusual in children in spite of
carrying on tradition of their cloud of glory.</p>

<p>"Mumsie, I see you have taken enough so we had better stop now,
but you are getting on fine and will soon be able to see me
properly. Give Dad all the best from me and Dave too. So long all.
C."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Yes, Mumsie Darling, I am come to give you a
kiss on Christmas Eve but I couldn't get here sooner becos I came
from Mars were I have been negotiating a help party to collect more
rays of colours to give impetus to peace. It is like a soothing
poultice round earth to heal the fighting idea and make peace
possible and we are trying it on Europe were the fiercest feelings
go on coming. It is just like a disease this war and healing rays
will calm it by degrees. I am coming to-morrow all day so I won't
make you tired now but you needn't talk till evening so that you'll
l keep fresh. A HAPPY CHRISTMAS MUM and DAD from LANCELOT."</p>

and friends wrote short messages with</i> R'<i>s hand.)</i></p>

<p><i>December 26th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Mum, I have been waiting all day and you are
so unwanting me. Yes, I know really Mum darling, I was naughty to
say that. I had a thing to tell you and it was like this. I want
Chris to come over to my power centres on the moon where I focus
power of moon-rays to soothe earth from fear and he will see how we
can help in a much Bigger way than his, though his way helps a lot
in special people but he would be so interested in moon-ray power
centres which I am focusing just now, so may he come please?"</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Mumsie, I am thrilled with all Lance has
been telling me and shall soon be back at work on your route but
feel I can grasp larger ways of helping when I have seen Lance's
work. We were planning to go to-night so we shan't be able to talk
long as you are so late beginning. Yes, I know you couldn't help
it. Mumsie, how did you enjoy the party?" (R. <i>"Very much.")</i>
"I am so glad. I'm sorry Dad was disappointed but I had to bring
along the old boy Cousin C&mdash;because he found out there was a
gathering here and wanted so to represent his family. He is a queer
old cove and can't believe he needn't be so middle-aged as he
thinks he is, Dad's parents are overhead at present and I couldn't
get hold of any others for Dad this time but yours simply swarm all
over the place and I can always collect a good many. Overhead? Did
I say that? Overhead is a slang expression meaning that they are
having a course of celestial training&mdash;going to stars and
learning of other forms of life. It's used a good deal by us
younger ones who aren't celestially educated yet. Courses of star
training are a part of normal education of those come from earth
within a generation or so. I mean, when a man dies normally at 80
or so he has a year or several years to get accustomed to etheric
life on earth and then takes a course of star-training to complete
his next step in education. Dad's parents are both away on star
courses now but they'll be back soon I think.</p>

<p>"You needn't expect me back for a week or so, Mumsie. I shan't
be gone very long though. Now we must say goodnight and love to Dad
and Dave&mdash;he is to be your only son for a week or two and must
be a prop to you and Dad. Cheerio. C."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Cats! Love to Dave and his kitten is a pet.
I see he's as fond of it as I am of mine! Now I must tell you of
our trip&mdash;be open a bit more Mumsie. First Lance and I went to
his power centre on the moon and caught a wave of moon-ray going
off to earth on a healing concentration. I was thrilled by the
power there, for they concentrated rays of all the healing sorts
into a belt of light surrounding the war zones on earth and forming
a powerful soothing influence which will prevent the war from
plunging too many into despair. Then I watched the light break into
colours of such beauty as I had never imagined before.</p>

<p>"Then Lance called me to see his new adaptor of colour blending
which he has invented and got a credit for. It is a form of
invention you can't get into your mind at all so I won't attempt to
describe it. He is given a post of prominence after this invention
as it is considered first rate and a great improvement on the old
methods."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Chris is great at puffing me up Mum. I wasn't
the only one to invent something because we all felt we must get
more peace-power on earth and thort out ways of doing it. Tell Dad
I made a better VENTION than his though. That will show him I am
quite a big SON NOW! Going now, Chris. I just wanted a word with
Mum to-day because it's going to be some time before I get back
home again from Venus and they want me over there to direct their
musical help for earth now. Goodnight Dad. FROM LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Now I want to give you a view of the Power
centre on the moon where these healing rays are blended. Great
machines of etheric forces are used to collect the sun's rays into
a vast ocean of light, and then absorb the terrestrial essences of
the moon to blend them into separate colours until all are
separated out and coloured with moon-essences. As this takes place
a belt of softer light forms without, which glides to earth
incessantly giving a soothing healing emanation to all life. This
all goes on through action of the power centre machines which are
set to work by concentration of thought surrounding them. It is
difficult to put into words but you have some notion of it now.</p>

<p>"I want to give a word of greeting to my Dad, and to Dave so
glad to be home again. Sorry Mumsie, I must be off now. Coming more
often now on your work so look out for me. Cheerio Dad and Dave. So
long. C."</p>

<p><i>(Note: "Machines of etheric forces" should not be read as
meaning machines in the earth sense.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>January 12th and 15th, 1945.</i>
</p>

<p>"Sorry Mumsie, I was called away suddenly and went over to get a
glimpse of my chum Ian before he departs overhead for a bit. I am
glad you know that expression now as it explains in one word. He is
going for a course on planetary life and hopes to be better fitted
to place himself about jobs such as he hopes for. Elementary
courses in ray-healing lead to work on the mechanics of light and
this opens out a vast field of work for the evolution of man in
space&mdash;not spiritual evolution which is of course more
important, but form evolution, how to adjust himself to new
surroundings in other systems of stars. I am not to go in yet for
this because I am helping in the crusade at home. Can you grasp
another aspect? Convolutions of space prevent many from getting
their perspective right and much learning of light mechanics is
needed to adjust that difficulty. Now I must be going again as I am
wanted by our chief on a gathering of helpers. Love to Dad.
CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "I was with you in billiards before and so
interested to see DAD playing which I NEVER Expected. Darling Dad
was happy and you all had such happy minds it made me quite bucked
up over my family being such a nice one. Can I just tell Mum
something of a bigger sort? Michael is away on great business of
ambassador for our Lady Mary to a conference of spirits of all
planets in our system of our sun, and it takes place on Mercury
becos that is empty and used for a spirit meeting ground. It is the
greatest honour to be chosen to represent earth at a conference of
Planets and he is over there now to confer with the arrangers of
it. I am so proud to be his brother and quite SWELL with Pride!</p>

<p>"I am not going away for some time now becos I am taking turns
at Power Centres on Earth for a bit so shall be here quite a lot.
Chris tells me he is working for you now and I'm very interested at
that and hope to be able to help, too. Can we go now? Chris has
work he says. Goodnight DARLINGS. LANCELOT and Chris."</p>

<p><i>January 17th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Come on Mum I am tired of being called
Kitopher and want you to be more observant of our coming and
goings. I came to tell you about my Power station on the Moon as I
shall have to go back again soon to set it in motion again. You see
we can leave these Power stations to carry on like machinery for a
bit till they run down for lack of colour energy so we have to go
back to combine more rays for producing colour energy."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Colours have much more power than you know
of Mumsie and give out force which has great effect on earth. Yes,
Chris. I was here all the time but Lance was wanting you to
recognise him too and you only thought of me!"</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "All right, Mum, I know you can only take in
one of us at a time so I don't mind only I want you to know when I
am there, too. I shall be away on the Moon for a few days after
tonight."</p>

<p><i>January 26th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Come on Mumsie, you are a time getting
ready. I see so I had to wait, well now we are off&mdash;Here's the
Cat! Comfortable now? I want to have a quiet talk for I have been
away again over to see Lance on the Moon and had some instruction
in his special belt of moon-rays. Openings for students of moon-ray
healing are high if one can qualify, as the world needs soothing
and these are potent for such treatment. I was thrilled with the
currents set up in the direction of earth looking like streams of
clear blue light and carrying millions of colours under the blue
quite inexplicable in human words. Carrying on the work there are
great enthusiasts for the healing of man, holding certificates from
the greatest branches of medicine known, the manipulators of Cosmic
creative healing. I was allowed to see all their activities as
being Lance's brother, which was a high honour and I feel very
elated to have learnt so much. I can now discharge my work of
helping your cases with much more efficiency as I can take mind
impressions of curative processes unknown to me before, and be
aware of other forces than I formerly knew. O Mumsie, you can't
conceive how lovely it is over there in the moon-ray
works&mdash;gathering great sweeps of healing colours into a wave
of soothing yet glorious light and focusing it to earth in bands of
colour. Cool soft harmonies are all around one and I felt bathed in
new harmonious life. May I be over there a bit again soon? As I
think my work will benefit from it more than if I stayed over here
and went on as before. (R. <i>"What about your cases?")</i> Yes, I
won't forget to go to them and am going on my rounds to-night. I'll
bring you some reports to-morrow or Sunday before I go moon gazing
again. Lance will be back home soon he says but only on and off,
for he is in charge of one of the chief moon-ray works there and
can't be away long at a time. Tell Dad I am so thrilled at my
course of training there. I can't stay long now as I haven't been
to see your cases yet but wanted so much to tell you all the lovely
things I saw. Love to Dad and Dave. So long. C."</p>

<p><i>January 28th, 1945. (Listening to music.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Mum Darling, I am delighted with your
awakening power of vision. You are much more aware of us and our
life than I thought possible till you leave your body. I am So
Pleased becos we can show you a great deal more now and you will
love to see it. I am so happy about it all. Chris and I were each
taking one arm to help you up a bit and the music helps you more
than most people. I never knew a mind weave such music patterns as
your does; you have never got into earth ways of connecting music
with notes and rules of harmony, so you weave most wonderful spirit
songs of joy in the beauty of it. Chris wants to say something
now."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Chris speaking Mumsie. I am glad you are so
quiet to-day. Lance and I were inspired by your music love and
nearly took you into our life until Dad made a noise and brought
you back with a jerk. I know it can't be helped because you are so
sensitive to sound that you come back in response to any noise at
once. It was a grand event to get you so near us though and pleased
us both no end. Some day you will really see those colours properly
and then you'll gasp in wonder at them.</p>

<p>"You are to have a time of greater work soon, but don't be
impatient at your seeming small output for all are bearing fruit
and you can't see the extent of your influence; if you could it
would surprise you. I am going now so give Dad my congrats on his
industry, his mind is full of work just now. Love to him of course.
Your CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>Michael:</i> "Mummy I am here too, Michael yes, I am back
from helping a great conference of Spirits to aid our earth. We are
hoping great power will come to enlighten men and Christ will be
glorified by all in years to come. I can be in your mind now I am
your son ever...MICHAEL."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Yes, Mum Darling, I was waiting till you had
got Michael's message becos he can't stay long in writing, he is
too big to get small enough for earth things now. I am still just
your human boy so I can use your mind as easily as ever. I must go
too now becos I am so wanted on a course of moon-ray instruction.
They are short of qualified instructors so I've promised to take a
course for them now. Goodbye DARLINGS. DAD DARLING and MUM DARLING
from LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>February 4th, 1945.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "I want a message given to Dad that he must try
and think of me as grown up now and not want me to write in words
of my childhood! I put it on sometimes to show I am still the same
boy but I really am far grown in power and strength and knowledge.
I can use your brain to find all the words I need and have
knowledge of other languages too. Don't be afraid I shall ever
cease to be the same to you. I want just to make Dad see that I am
just his son just the same, but he mustn't want me to be childish
still except in fun as a joke. I am an awful joker as you know and
tease Chris a lot because he is so serious minded and takes himself
very earnestly! Mum Darling I LOVE being here with you and DAD but
I must be off now to set my activator going on the moon again. See
you soon again. LOVE from LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>February 5th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Cousin M&mdash;wants me to thank you for
giving another push to Mr. D&mdash;'s mind as he is very interested
in my Mars trip and full of explanations of certain things I
described which he thinks conflict with other reports through
Mediums&mdash;I fancy a good deal of mystification is caused by the
medium's own subconscious mind taking charge and twisting what is
said to her; given a preconceived idea in the subconscious, it is
easy to twist a remark such as Martian into martial or Heaven into
leaven&mdash;that's not a good one but conveys my meaning. I know
people have come away from a medium in a state of frustration as
all they said was given in a distorted way with a totally different
meaning. No&mdash;you are clear as a bell and never distort. I
sometimes can't get a word I want into your mind but you know at
once if I can't and never put down any other words."</p>

<p><i>February 14th, 7.45 a.m. (Lancelot's birthday.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Good morning to Dad and Mum. Lance isn't able to come early as
his moonray apparatus functions till sun up here and he'll be along
in a few minutes now." <i>Lancelot:</i> "Your birthday boy is with
you, Mum Darling. LOVE to DAD and MUM from LANCELOT. Talk when you
have time later."</p>

<p><i>11 a.m.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Mum Darling, I am very good at catching
thoughts so don't mind shoving me off if you are too busy to write;
I only want a thought from you now. Dad&mdash;he is only expecting
a short chat so won't mind. However let's go ahead now and I want
to tell you a thing and it's like this. Over your head is a crown
of happy memories and they make a sparkle like diamonds and rubies
and all sorts of glittering things. I am so happy at seeing how
happy is your lovely mind to-day.</p>

<p>"Not a good drawing but I tried to draw a creature out of the
pond again. It is much prettier really.</p>

<p>"Covering the stones at the bottom with coloured moss but you
can't see it yet.</p>

<p>"That is in the pond too, very observant of the mossy things and
expectant of a meal off them, I think, but not your sort of eating
quite different to that.</p>

<p>"Another pond thing very active and jumpy. I have been watching
them with Chris, who is interested in Natural History of the
Etheric Plane, and I think will do some work of a naturalist sort
in his spare times. I am over to Mars again after to-day to fetch
more ray-keys so don't expect me for a bit."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> " Chris speaking, Mumsie darling. How nice
you are to-day. I have been watching pond life again and asked
Lance to do some drawings for me as he is so good at it. I am
having a complete holiday as it is his birthday and we are enjoying
Home so much. Lance and I are off for another stroll now and we'll
coffee house, as Dad says, to-night when you are freer."</p>

<p><i>March 3rd and 15th, 1945.</i>
</p>

<p>"We control a light-band lifting clouds from England gradually
and I am on lifting duty on your cases. You haven't quite got that
clear. Your cases are getting enlightened and that helps to raise
the clouds of unbelief and grief from England. Lots of others are
helping to raise the clouds in a sort of band of enlightenment
which is spreading over the country. You are going to see more
later on of the effect you have already made. C&mdash;has come out
of her cloud, but she is very materialistic and can't grasp how to
pray at all. She will try to say commonplace words with ne meaning
in them and then gets cross at having no result. She'll write soon
to you so I'm just giving you a hint or two.</p>

<p>"Can we have a very long undisturbed talk? I must tell you a
fine adventure of mine with Lance on the Grampians&mdash;yes,
Scotland, Grampian Mts. We were prospecting for etheric conditions
suitable for a power centre to control N.E.Scotland and England,
and a messenger from Ethiopia came asking for help as they are in
difficulties over there, so Lance gave a wave-length of suitable
span and we rigged up a super power centre for long distance help.
They were so grateful as we couldn't go over, having much to see
here. The creatures of upper air interfered and we had to chase
them by thought concentration, so were kept busy till a long
distance call came for Lance and he had to go leaving me to control
his power centre. I was scare stiff as I had never taken charge of
one of these before and they give out such stupendous power-rays
that it could damage the mental make-up of whole nations if
improperly used. However I did my little best and all in prayer for
guidance, so soon a great spirit came to check my findings and said
all was well but a bit too controlled by fear as I was so tense
about it all the time. By that time Lance was due back so I was
relieved of responsibility. I haven't had much to do with these
centres yet and am new to it.</p>

<p>"You might give a few more hints to Mrs. O&mdash;that she should
wait till people ask her help rather than push them as she does.
Mrs, Q&mdash;has agreed to have a few more trials of the medium at
her son's request, but she is afraid they are doing wrong and keeps
hoping he will give it up. I was a bit premature in my conclusion
that he had done so already.</p>

<p>"Quantities of gnomes have lost their houses in the forest
clearing that has been going on all over England and are wandering
round trying to find accessible people to play with on the
table-turning basis. They collect in groups with a leader and then
produce raps and taps and all the nonsense people like to think is
bogey noises. It is only that having lost their homes they find no
occupation, as normally they spend their lives building and
ornamenting their little dwellings, so they just collect in bands
and make mischief if possible with people who produce ectoplasmic
extensions they can use. Can we talk again in evening? I am going
now to see another case."</p>

<p><i>(Later)</i>
</p>

<p>"Over in Germany I see blazing colours of terror and fury. How
ghastly it all is, I am still fearful of going there, yet ashamed
of this and tell it only to you, my Mumsie. How grand to feel it
will soon be ended and we can begin to reconstruct on our side the
tattered hearts and beaten minds.</p>

<p>"Love to Dad as always. All right, more next time. C."</p>

<p><i>March 22nd.</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, Mumsie, but we'll talk after your supper, I have plenty of
things to say and want a good time. Carry on! (R. <i>"Now, what do
you want to talk about?")</i></p>

<p>"My own affairs chiefly! I am preparing for a new step in
progress and I am going overhead for a special training. Uncle Toby
carries on my work for you in higher ways than I can do and tells
me all will be well while I am away. I am not so panicky now as I
was the first time, but I don't like leaving you any more than
before, darling. I am far stronger now though, as you can feel, my
Mother. I start on work of preparation to-morrow, but must be given
special teaching which will take some weeks or months according to
my capability of receiving it, so expect me once or twice before I
say goodbye." (R. <i>"Are you going to be away long?")</i> "No,
only a few months probably, and Uncle Toby has promised additional
help in your direction, so you can rely on him for anyone in need.
I want to get ahead in development so that Dad will be proud of his
son. Now to return to earth and your cases. Can you let Mrs.
B&mdash;know that her son has gone on a planetary tour and will not
be back for some months? She may get misled by earth-bounder voices
unless she knows this. Good.</p>

<p>"You will be guided, so be quite happy about my going, for
others much wiser take my place, Mumsie, my own. Carry on, says
Uncle Toby, and you will soon see me back again. A message for Dave
that I shall be away for this hols but back for summer ones, I
hope. Give Dad my best ever, and often I shall think of home and
both my own ones. Carry on, that's the motto for us all over here.
God bless both, I'm going now. C."</p>

<p><i>March 27th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Soon I must away for a long time, I shall
come on Easter Day to say goodbye. Only a few months, and I shall
learn wonderful things which I am longing to know."</p>

<p><i>Another:</i> "Can I say a word or two? I am going with Chris,
and he is my companion in mind progress. You don't know my name, so
I can't tell you, but I am so glad to meet you as Chris told me you
would let me talk and I couldn't think how. He says to tell you I
am called Charlie, that is enough. Thank you."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "You didn't expect him, but he is a friend
who is admitted to this course on the same level as mine, so we
collaborate to some extent. He would have it that talking with
earth life people was impossible as none of his own can do it so I
wanted to show him it could be done if one has a light-bearer as
Mother! Seriously, he thinks me a bit swanky to have such a grand
father and mother, though he is just thrilled to talk to you
himself. His people are quite awful, I believe, and not a spark to
be struck out of them, poor fellow. Yes, do let's go back to Dad
and Dave. Good, family all collected now, including kitten. Just
want to give my love all round and then must flit back on work. See
you all on Sunday if not before. Dave, old boy, shake. Jolly
holidays, I hope. Goodnight all. C."</p>

<p><i>April 1st, 1945. (Easter Sunday.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Good Mumsie, to be passive and let us come on Easter Sunday.
Lance is coming on after I have had my say, and that must be short
as I am overhead to-morrow and still have much to do. Not packing
exactly, but equipment of various etheric kinds which you couldn't
understand if I tried to explain. I am nearly qualified as a
ray-healer now, having had such practice with your cases. Mrs.
F&mdash;is happier than she has ever been before, for she never had
much faith in organised religion and sees a new heaven and a new
earth rising out of our letters to you. I am glad you gave her
another bit of my letters, she will absorb every detail with
avidity and be clearer in mind than ever before.</p>

<p>"My mind is so full of my new training that I seem to have lost
touch with your cases lately. I shall help all the better when I
get back, though. No, I can't tell you anything yet but hope to on
my return. Can't say when, but not long I think. I am coming for a
last Silent Minute to-night at 9 p.m., so be aware of me like last
time, darling. Love to my Dad. So long till 9 p.m. C."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Mum, darling, I am going to be more with you
now Chris will be away and helping about your cases and all that.
Chris tells me he was giving treatment to several, and I can go on
with it on the same lines as he did. Chris is joining a stellar
radiance course which will teach him complete control over ray
products here and give him possibilities of higher development than
he could by remaining here. I think he will enjoy it, too, but it
means fairly hard work at first. I shall enjoy being home a bit and
am quite good at the work he was doing so can help quite a lot. You
can count on me twice a week, Mum darling, and I'll come Saturdays
and Wednesdays like Chris used to, shall I ? Can I give you an idea
of my work on moon-ray concentration of dynamic will-force? To
utilise radiance of moon rays towards earth; and already peaceful
vibrations are coming which will heal the suffering of minds caused
by war. It isn't working for stopping the war, but for healing torn
minds and giving them peace, and it has a so beautiful effect that
I love to watch them respond and raise their heads again, like a
cornfield after a storm all beaten flat, rising in the sun again.
This is moon not sun though&mdash;and I am moon-controller. I hope
to be sun treater of awakening spiritual growth soon. Mum you are
to rest a bit now, and we'll be here for Big Ben to-night and stand
one on each side of you in radiant harmony of prayer. LANCELOT. DAD
IS ALWAYS INCLUDED."</p>

<p><i>(Later, 9 p.m. Big Ben.)</i> "Come on, Lance, she's waiting.
Shall we wait for Big Ben?"</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Mum, I come over to you. Now I am
near&mdash;you went so far we couldn't see you. Your love is like
an awning of blue and rose colour over us both. Chris wants to say
goodbye so I'll go now."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "O, Mother darling, I can't bear to leave
you. Christ help me. I am so sure and safe in you, but now I must
go and labour away from your love. O you make it seem all one
wherever I go&mdash;I know your love is there, so I won't mind
being far in body. I am glad to gain new knowledge, and shall be
home again soon&mdash;so goodbye Mumsie and Dad, of all parents
best I could ever think of. God bless you both, always and ever.
I'm going now. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>April 4th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "You are tired so I was resting you, DARLING. I
came to report as to Chris going off to Sirius. He was thrilled at
the distance, not having been far before, and quite forgot to be
homesick, for which I was thankful. I went part way to see him off,
but he was one of a big party including expert teachers, and he
quite took his place and was happy to go. So I came back much
cheerfuller about him. I haven't been over to Sirius myself for a
long time, but it is great in stellar rays they are to learn about.
Came to-day and you were with other people having tea; they had
nice minds and are so fond of you, but I was not conscious of any
wish to be higher in their minds, only to have nothing hard to
bear. You tried to lift them by telling them they had GOD in them,
but it left them just the same as before, just wanting to be helped
in a comforting way themselves. I think they will have to lift
them-selves; no good trying to help them yet. I only saw them
coming to you though, so praps they are better than I thought. Now
go to bed and I'll give you a good night and see those cases before
Saturday when I next come as I told you. GOD Bless Darling Mum and
Dad from LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>April 28th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "O Mum how splendid to get your mind in the
morning! I am interested to tell you about J&mdash;. Yes, the case
you gave me. She is only a little way from her death, and will soon
be with her son and husband. They have been told this, and are ever
so happy about it. She was hearing her husband when I got there,
and wasn't sure if she heard right so wouldn't believe him in case.
I had a talk with him and he is such a nice man. EVER SO LOVING to
her and his son. He is getting a lovely home ready for them all to
live in when she comes, and is so happy about that, but she mustn't
know yet of course.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Y.&mdash;is here again and is much better&mdash;may she
talk?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Y.&mdash;:</i> "You are kind, I can help you now. I see
how your son writes. Soon I sleep again, for I am old and need
sleep. I shall wake up like my youth they say. You are kind. Thank
you. I must sleep now."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Now Mum I want to say a message for Dad, to
say he can trust me to take care you get enough sleep too, like old
Mrs. Y&mdash;! She just won't believe she can go ahead like a young
woman now, but is beginning to get the idea into her foggy mind.
She hasn't even got the sense to know when her husband comes to see
her, but he wasn't in love with her really, so he can't help much
now."</p>

<p><i>May 6th, 1945.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Yes, I may lift you to-day to see I am your
son. O Mum you love me still, and long to know what I have become.
I make my aura mist to speak to you, like yours, to blend and
harmonise so that I can write still to use your longing mind. But I
am far Huger than you can think, and great power for God. I love to
be with you and DAD DARLINGS but can't show you my huge self yet,
so keep to little words and on your level of mind, because I love
you both so much. Now be attentive to a message from Chris. He has
turned his mind this way to tell you a bit of his doings, and can
send it through me like I did once through Michael&mdash;'Chris
speaking telepath to Mumsie and Dad. Very curious happenings. Shall
have millions of letters to write when get home. All's
well&mdash;Love from C.G.T. love.'</p>

<p>"You heard him fairly well and I only had to put in one word
which was curious. I think he meant strange to him, becos I only
feel he had been to quite ordinary places, and not real adventures
such as I have had before.</p>

<p>"About your cases, you get on best by my intuitive guidance on
the spot: these reports in words are unnecessary so don't expect
that from me now.</p>

<p>"Darling you can't take my words very long because I am too high
up: so stop now. GIVE DAD my LOVE of COURSE. GOD BLESS MY HOME.
From LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>May 10th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "You must give me attention now for a message
from Uncle Toby; he is bringing a relation of his to see you and
make your acquaintance."</p>

<p><i>Theodore:</i> "I am pleased to be in your mind again Ruth and
find you all well after Armistice Celebrations. My friend
K&mdash;comes from Oregon and knew your boys there; known to my
circle out there, but I know names can't come through, she is Win's
great pal. She happened along to see me just as I was coming to
you. I came to tell you that Chris will soon be returning via Orion
and Neptune. He expects to see you June 15th or so and I am getting
up a party to welcome him home to which I hope to invite you, in
return for your welcome to me at Christmas before last. Chris likes
parties as you know, and will be the hero of this one, as all are
new to this life and will be thrilled to hear his adventures. I am
proud he is so brave and independent over this tour. A co-operator
of mine is carrying messages from the party and gives good reports
of C's progress&mdash;My regards to Guy. You will hear more of my
party later. Theodore."</p>

<p>"Goodbye Mum I must go too. LOVE TO DAD. LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>May 18th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "I am to tell you that 'a great adventure' is
Chris's description of his tour and he has already prepared several
talks with you which he hopes you will publish. Of course he can't
make you understand it all really, but he hopes to be a famous
author of post-earth travel adventures.</p>

<p>"Dad would like to know that I see lovely emanations coming
round him when he looks at plants he loves. I was watching you two
looking at the peonies and beautiful colours came floating out of
your minds in harmony. I just gave a burst of happy joy to see you
loooking at those flowers. Your crown is growing Mum Darling, and
Dad's too.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't heard again from Chris; he is on his way home by
now, but they visit several planets on their way back I think. I
must skip off now to sort my moon-rays for work again, so O revoir
Mum darling. LOVE TO DAD from LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>May 27th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "You thought I was Lance, but I am Chris! I
am coming overland so got home before Lance thought, and glad to be
back, but had no end of a good time. Darling, it's great to be home
with you again and I did so enjoy our flowery walk, though you kept
thinking I was Lance! Can we have time for a good talk or are you
busy? O.K.&mdash;now for a description of the starry skies! All I
could do was gasp with wonder at first, but it was all natural
after all, and nothing conflicts with ideas from our planet if we
take it all as ONE GOD. I am much grown in spirit as a result of
the marvels of the Universe, and feel greatly better for it all.
Can you visualise the meaning of Christ's birth here on earth? God
indwelling Humanity? That is shown in other forms in the far
distant stars, and He is creating and indwelling all. I was lost in
wonder at His Great Love.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you a bit of the lighter side of our journey. We
were lifted by our combined wishes into a current of ray-force to
assist our efforts to leave the planetary system to which we
belong. All spirits belong to their own planet until perfected, and
it needs great desire to leave our sun's control, so this current
was set in the direction needed by our party by one of the higher
controllers of our planet. I must mention my companions who were
all from earth and mostly new to stellar space. I was one of the
youngest in the band, though a few had joined our life in the war.
Our commander was a grand spirit, with years of experience and full
of longing for the earth's enlightenment. Cushna knows him well,
his name on earth was&mdash;. O no you can't quite get it C&mdash;.
How queer I can't get it into your mind but you ought to know him.
Charles Wesley, that's more like it. Only you haven't spelt it
right, have you?</p>

<p>"More another time, can you make it tonight? I am due at a
return parade soon and can't be certain of coming afternoon, but
will get back as son as it's over. Came here rapidly to register
return with you, all important Mumsie! Greet Dad from his loving
son: hope to see him tonight too. Au revoir. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>Later.</i> "Came for Silent Minute like we used to. Mumsie, I
am overjoyed to be home again and see Dad fussing over his plants
to make C.M. garden best in England! My Mumsie, home at last! I was
working hard to get on and be a credit to you both, so all was
well, but the relief to be home again is wonderful. All I want is
Home! Give me a few talks in the week, Mumsie, as I shall be on
home-coming leave and free to tell you my adventures." (R. <i>:
"Can you help with my work again?")</i> "Can't say as I am under
orders still and may have different instructions, but I hope to
help you a bit. You are wondering something? I'll be happy to work
for you all my free time, sweet Mumsie.</p>

<p>"Now, Mumsie, have we time for a description of a glory of
colour you can't conceive? We gathered speed on the current I spoke
of before, till planets looked dim in the distance, and a star came
nearer and nearer, showing as a great green ball, then paler and
bluer until left behind too. After what seemed hours (but time is
unintelligible there) we closed in on our destination the star
Cereos or Sirius. Rays of glory penetrated our auras, and
protecting hoods were pulled round our minds. Colours, O such
colours. I have no words for the glory of them. Sirius is a home of
radiant spirits who have evolved from many planets into perfection
of love and beauty. God's Presence was so near I fell on my face in
worship. O, Mumsie, I can't describe it, only a fraction can be
absorbed by your dear mind. Clear radiance all around. We were
supported by our Leader and told to try and see&mdash;after a time
we got accustomed to the glory and filled with strength to learn
what we came to know. It concerns our little earth so far
away&mdash;yet home to all of us, and we then knew how far we had
to grow before we attained the glory of spirits we saw. I can't
explain what we were taught, it is too far from human words, but it
has made me grow in spirit as I never before could have thought
of.</p>

<p>"Clear shining hills of jewel colours, green mantle of soft
light, glory of brilliant focus points of blazing light. Colours
you can't get near in mind at all. God in all His Beauty. O,
Mumsie, I have been far and learnt much. Some day you will know,
more I cannot describe.</p>

<p>"Shall we talk each evening after Silent Minute? I shall be with
you a week or two now&mdash;and shall think f things I can
describe, I expect. No more now as you are tired.</p>

<p>"Night night to Dad."</p>

<p><i>May 28th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Clever Mum to hear me, I was quite a long way
off, but am close now. I couldn't come yesterday and was surprised
to hear Chris had got back so soon. Uncle Toby told me and said he
had got a party to welcome him home, but they can't all come yet
becos he thought it would be later on. I am keeping on my work with
you for a time, becos Chris has a bit of free time due to him
before he takes it over."</p>

<p>(R. <i>: "Mrs. P&mdash;is anxious to get a message from her
husband.")</i></p>

<p>"She is wanting to know what he is doing? I'll see if I can find
him. Yes, if you have her letter." R. <i>held the letter.</i></p>

<p>"She has a very quick vibration and wants very badly to have
news from her husband. He was standing near her when she had that
letter and longing to get her mind to know he was with her. Someone
else makes her afraid she is mistaken when she feels him there. She
would be much more sure that he came if she accustomed herself to
believe her feelings and not think she is wrong always. I will try
to see her husband and have a talk with him about mind
influence.</p>

<p>"All right and OK, as Chris says. Dad is awfully funny when he
laughs at you because he thinks so differently to what he says and
it makes a twinkle in his mind to be so different! I LIKE THAT. His
twinkle, I mean. IT IS SO DAD-ISH. I DO SO LOVE MY
DAD&mdash;Darling Mum too, of course. GOD BLESS BOTH from
LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "You were two minutes too soon, I should
guess. I came as I said for the Silent Minute and make a tune about
good to be Home again. Cheers for C.M. Hooray! Tell Dave I said
that when you see him. Now for a short talk of a long journey into
the starry spaces where light shines with a grandeur we on earth
never know. After leaving Sirius we toured some of the Satellites
around that great home of light. After Sirius they seemed so
insignificant and shone with only his reflected light. I saw many
forms of life on them all and curious some of them were too,
indescribable in human words. Quaint living beings without any
resemblance to earth forms&mdash;so little that any words I might
use would give a false impression. They&mdash;the
Satellites&mdash;circulate round Sirius as our planets round our
sun, so they have day and night much as we on earth. Clouds were
rare as few had any moisture or air as we know it. All have life
but our scientists can't get the idea of airless life yet most
other planets are airless. May I stop and think it out a bit?</p>

<p>"You are tired, Mumsie, shall we try earlier tomorrow evening?
O.K. before Big Ben, 8.30. I'll think out ways of describing the
indescribable! So long.&mdash;CHRIS. Love to Dad."</p>

<p><i>May 29th. (Music on the wireless.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Can't you write later? Do let's listen. You are so anxious for
our talk! I'll begin, but the Silent Minute comes soon. I want you
to be very receptive and try to take in colours you have never
seen! Coo, you nearly saw it! I never ventured to suppose you'd get
so near! Let's have a big talk after Big Ben. Can't get you quiet
before&mdash;no good, Mumsie."</p>

<p><i>(Pause for Big Ben.)</i> "O I was surprised when you came on
my wish wave, just before Big Ben, you soared right over my head
till I could scarcely follow you. Now shall we have a try to carry
you all the way to Sirius? I meant to tell you more about our
crossing but decide it is too difficult to describe. I cannot get
words, but you must imagine glory of self-luminous world is far
beyond that of planets lighted by external rays. Silver-blue and
amethyst are the only human colours I can name. No, there was green
in many shades. I cannot describe contour, for there was no form as
we know it. All was harmonious movement, a blending and forming to
be swiftly changed at the volition of Beings whose home it was,
unutterably beautiful. Beyond this a further depth I could not
fathom in mind. I can't express it, Mumsie darling, it goes too far
beyond words. We absorbed as much as we were individually capable
of, and our guide gave us further directions to remove protective
cloaks as we fell out of light into comparative dimness&mdash;on to
the Satellites in turns. Night on one of these. Queer beings
bending in worship to God. All absorbed in praising Him from Whom
they came. Not beautiful to earth thought of beauty. Impossible to
describe, Lance might draw them, but it wouldn't convey the
reality. Grotesque, I thought, but their minds had Love in them.
Life was there in many forms, and all completely alien to ours on
earth. I can't use words, they just don't fit. Our guide explained
that all were within the aura of Sirius and therefore attuned to
higher vibrations we have no conception of on earth. Each star has
a different vibration of its aura and those within this are in
bodies attuned to this. Can we go on a little? I wondered so much
at all I saw that I failed to take in some of the teaching, so had
to stay behind on one Satellite and miss out the next. My guide
said it was not so important. Have you done higher mathematics? It
was something like grasping the Calculus before one has learnt
one's numbers. I just had to go back to learn a bit before I could
go on. Now I think you had better stop and go to bed. I can see
your mind is tired. To-morrow sometime? Righto."</p>

<p><i>May 31st.</i>
</p>

<p>"Your cat is so affectionate. I can see his little mind working
in love for you and Dad. Yes, I think we can manage without turning
him off. I want to try and focus your mind on another aspect of my
tour&mdash;that of taking radiance back to Earth. We were not only
learning, but helping conditions here by collecting radiance in our
minds to distribute here at home. You can't understand how this is
done, but it follows as a matter of course on out attaining a
certain stage of development. The swift flowing current carried us
on our return, but we made a halt at Orion where a few joined us
who had not been so far. Orion is a peaceful star of great power,
it is controlled by overseers of star systems who give out far
reaching influence through the surrounding universe. Blue is the
prevailing colour and over-whelming forces are in the blue rays
which proceed from it. Very scientific they seem to be there with
knowledge unobtainable to us. I was scarcely able to breathe there
with so much wisdom all over the place. Orion came out of creation
long before our sun was born&mdash;we'll go on later, darling. Your
mind was so nice and she smudged it all! However, Mumsie, you are
wonderful clearing up so well. Gorgeous colours of thought
penetration all over Orion and marvellous kaleidoscopic patterns of
intricate design. I have said blue was the prevailing colour, but
other colours were there which you don't know. Human words aren't
much use after leaving earth, so I can't attempt descriptions. Our
way home was interspersed with smaller stars all of great beauty;
and some over, some under the radiance of the sun. I am glad to
have seen it all, although I can't explain to you as I should like
to.</p>

<p>Uncle Toby sends you a message that he was unable to bring off
his idea of a party on my arrival, so he is keeping invitations for
my birthday instead, and wants you to be prepared to act as medium
to quite a lot of my friends. They feel it a great privilege and
honour, and will be excited and pleased I'm sure. I think it's
awfully jolly of Uncle Toby to have thought of it. Good-night, Dad
and Mumsie, I must be off now. God bless both. C."</p>

<p><i>June 3rd, 1945.</i>
</p>

<p>"Can we go over to Orion for a few minutes? I am hoping to give
you some idea of the dimensions of a visible part of the globe of
marvellous creations. You keep thinking of clear blue, but that is
not the colour at all. Blue of an opaque turquoise shading into
green or white in parts, all illuminated by light given out in
bands of colour from within. A million bodies size of earth would
scarcely reach the circumference stretched in a line. All beings
there are very high, and gifted with extraordinary intelligence,
which makes our earth minds seem babyish indeed. Only kindness
makes them receive us with gracious hospitality, and explain their
vast mechanisms reaching far out to other stars. I was, of course,
too small to begin to understand, but took in that help to others
was the purpose of it all. Come on Mumsie, you are slow to-night.
That's right, be more awake. I can't tell much more for lack of
words to fit what I saw."</p>

<p><i>June 7th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Came to tell you that I am officially promoted Captain of a
team of ray-light workers for Britain. Am terribly bucked and
crowing no end. Hope you'll be able to call on me for ray-light
work on occasions. Useful in every way, but chiefly healing of mind
troubles such as nervous disorders, grief and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Now as you are fairly fresh I want to talk about stars a bit.
All the universe is alive: there is no cessation of life anywhere.
Space (as we think it) is full of living beings and high holy ones
too. God is in all and fills all with life. Great Beings I can
scarcely bear to see are yet not superior to small beings as we
are, because GOD is equally in all and only degrees of opening to
His Power are real. I found a collection of little beings on one of
the Satellites I told you of&mdash;they seemed so small and weak to
me, but GOD was in them to just as great a degree as in the Angel
who guided us. Only happiness depends on the response individuals
make to His power in them. We can accept or refuse His control, for
He has given us free will. I can see much now which was confused to
me before. Open-mindedness is valuable, because new truth can then
be accepted, and no one has attained final truth. Can I tell you
about Sirius again? Quantities of marvellous colours is the
predominant effect on my mind, overwhelmingly beautiful. Clear
vision was difficult to me, for I was too undeveloped for life
there, so I can't give you much idea of it. Only I knew, when
there, much of spiritual truth I had never imagined before. Tell
Dad I am much older now than I was before I left earth.</p>

<p>"Can I return to my promotion? I am to train my team myself
according to my own ideas, and can choose a team from those I have
worked with before. My pal Ian is no use for this kind of work, he
is going to a power centre, as force is his line. I know a few
already I should like to have under me, and can consult Uncle Toby
as to the rest. Good-night, Mumsie darling."</p>

<p><i>June 8th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Can you tell Mrs. H&mdash;that her boy has got
on very well and is to be given a class of younger boys to teach
occupations to? He is getting on first rate, and is so keen to let
his mother know he is happy and working hard at things he never
thought of in earth life. He says it was a bit of luck for him
being drowned as it has given him such a grand life. I went to see
her and found his trail of thought, so went along to find him in
his work-shop with the younger boys learning from him. I was
reminded of my own early days when I was so pleased to be given a
job of teaching.</p>

<p>"Chris is pleased about his promotion to Captain and wants to
celebrate by a dance, but can't find enough girls he says! I think
he will manage somehow as he is keen on that sort of thing. I can't
catch on with the idea of dancing, not having done it on earth; it
just seems silly to me.</p>

<p>"Can you give me a kiss, Mum? O Darling, you shine when I say
Love like that! I am so glad to have a lovely Mum like you! Dad is
EVER SO Lovely when he is in his garden&mdash;like pictures of
colours. Good-night Darlings both. LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>June 13th and 19th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher: (Music)</i> "O Mumsie, how lovely that was.
Let's listen. <i>(Pause.)</i> I want to give you an idea of my new
work as a Captain of a team. I attune myself to the vibrations of
them all so that they can each pick up my orders. Then they gather
their separate rays into a harmony which colours as I command,
according to the need of the person we are trying to help. Of
course, we can't tackle mass wrong thinking yet, but we can do a
lot for individuals in that way.</p>

<p>"A while ago you were wondering about my talk about Orion
because you thought I meant a star, and it's a constellation of
stars. I meant the constellation all right but described most
ineffectively the idea that pervades them all. There is a kind of
sympathy through that sequence of stars, so that what I said would
do for all. I am not good at conveying names so couldn't get the
individual star names through and used a name you knew better than
them. Sorry if it was misleading.</p>

<p>"Can I have a few minutes before you go to welcome bed, Mumsie?
I have been trapsing about on my rounds, seeing your cases again
and cheered by the care Lance has taken of them. He says he is off
soon to another plane so I want to get <i>au fait</i> with the new
ones...Now Mumsie, I must be off, so <i>au revoir,</i> see you
again in a few days with some reports I hope. Lance takes me round
to-night, I think, and comes to you to-morrow to say goodbye for a
bit. I know you were hoping for more talks about the stars, but I
find I can't put it into words! It is all so different to the
things our words are made for that they don't fit in at all.
Cheerio, I'm off. Love to Dad, of course."</p>

<p><i>June 21st.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "O I am so happy that you are ready for me this
time, Mum, Darling! I want to tell you about my new work now that
you have heard about Colonel Gascoigne and his great work for the
Nation. I am collecting apparatus for cleaning the black spots on
Earth and purifying the etheric conditions left where fear and
anger have inked them over. Berlin is one of the BLACKEST spots of
all, so that's why he is so worried about this Conference being
held there, but I'm awfully top-headed about my apparatus, which
has GREAT cleansing power, and minds respond to it in great waves
of RELIEF, so I think I'll clear ever Berlin soon. So I shall be
working over there now until war effects are a bit cleared off.
Chris has got a team of workers under him for your work now, so
ought to be capable of lots more power than before. He is a bit shy
of tackling big things like mental trouble, but will soon get
accustomed to it.</p>

<p>"Can I tell you a bit about my apparatus? It is a mind concept
so you won't understand much, but this is how it is. I collect
force of cosmic radiation into a cylinder of will-power, which
projects the rays with great strength on to the black Earth spot,
and clears things like fear forces and muddy anger colours in no
time, just like sunshine clears dew. Then men's minds can begin
again all fresh, but the awful thing is they go and muddy it up
again by their wrong thinking, till I get all cross with them and
want to BANG their silly heads together. Of course they are only
like silly children, but it is so aggravating when I make a nice
clean place to see it all messed up with wrong thinking in no time.
I shall be coming off and on to see you, so don't be so not knowing
me like yesterday, DARLING!</p>

<p>"I love your lovely mind, Mum Darling. Tell Dad he is doing
GREAT WORK in telling his friend about me and Chris. Dad's friend
was just unsettled in his mind and needed a push towards belief. He
is so impressed, and very glad to have more corroboration of what
he heard to make more sure of it. GOOD OLD DAD! Cheers for DAD'S
WORK! Going off now Mum, see you soon again. Chris has taken over
them all. LANCELOT."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "O Mumsie, you are happy at my attempted
visualisation in your mind! It is much easier to answer Dad's
questions by a picture than in words. Happy colours live here and
that makes it all so beautiful. I see colours of the trees that you
can't see, because their etheric life is coloured differently to
their earth forms; and happy bird thoughts are coloured differently
to human thoughts altogether. All looks vividly alive to me, and
only the human houses look dead or rather just non-living. Even
stones have more life than houses because they are covered with
moss or tiny plants. But I can't describe it only it is the same
place seen inside out and altogether, instead of only its outline
as you see it.</p>

<p>"Good old Dad. I know, Lance told me. He was so pleased that Dad
took his book to give that friend of his, and my letters, too. Tell
Dad I'm ever so bucked and proud to have so clever a father. Most
men are so terribly afraid to say anything about this life, the
subject is taboo and not quite nice, I guess, in their opinion, why
I can't imagine!</p>

<p>"Ta ta Darlings both from your loving son. C."</p>

<p><i>June 23rd.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Ian:</i> "O Mrs. Tristram your cousin left a message he is
coming back to speak to you at 8.30. I am Ian, friend of Chris, now
working under Uncle Toby."</p>

<p><i>(8.30.) Theodore:</i> "Came for a communication from Win, who
sends you her warm invitation to a party we are giving to Chris on
his birthday. You will be told who the strangers are who are
coming; and one of the great attractions to them all is your
ability to converse with them: technically speaking you are a freak
in our knowledge of science, since you achieve the scientifically
impossible by sheer spiritual uplift. So, if you don't mind, you
will give great pleasure and interest to several of my friends if
you consent to let them write with you. Chris has asked his own
pals, and is very friendly with a good many now, I am glad to say.
He is bringing a girl you will like to meet as she was torpedoed in
his ship. She is a very fine spirit and takes care of other girls
who were war casualties, so she is a worker already. Expect us
then, Ruth, on August 3rd at whatever time you name&mdash;time
means more to you than in our sphere. Good, we'll be with you then:
not too many for you I hope. I shall limit the numbers you write
with, for we must not overdo our kind hostess. Chris is getting on
first rate: I am proud of his progress. He won acclamation on the
Sirius trip by his intelligence in taking in the teaching conveyed.
I think he should be able to help your work more, owing to his
greater powers since the trip. Candidly I think you and Guy have
every reason to be as proud of your son as I am.</p>

<p>"Win sends her greetings and is hoping to have a talk with you
at the party. My love to David and with the best to you and Guy.
THEODORE."</p>

<p><i>June 24th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Can we talk now Mumsie? I am full to the
brim with news, and hope to impress you and Dad with my new
importance! I am to give a demonstration of ray-healing work before
a large audience, who are studying the subject for enlightening the
medical profession on earth. It is to be filtered through into the
minds of earth doctors by telepathic suggestion from our side. That
much I knew already, and that doctors on earth will begin to use
other rays than those already known soon. But I am&mdash;bucked is
too small a word&mdash;swollen headed and too big for my boots and
everything else, to have been chosen for this demonstration of ray
work! Just a beginner like myself! They say my methods have won
approval in very high quarters, and I have shown initiative and
enterprise in training my squad. The show takes place tomorrow, so,
as my boys are nearly perfect in their drill, I am taking a bit of
time off to-day to keep from giving 'em fresh thoughts and muddling
the show up. My mind is so excited that I am teeming with new
ideas, and afraid of upsetting their drill by my presence! I shall
have to concentrate when the time comes, so all should go well.
Tell Dad now, so that I can enjoy his pleasure in my progress.</p>

<p>"I shan't be coming for your cases till this is over, so no good
telling me to-day. Yes, by Wednesday I can settle to work again I
expect. Mumsie, I am so happy, and it's jolly to be at home. Let's
go out together shall we? I don't want to talk, but just sit about
with you and Dad. Right&mdash;I'll play about while you finish your
letters and we'll garden together after."</p>

<p><i>June 26th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Mumsie, you are working hard, why so busy? O yes, very
important in time of war and you are still short over here I
suppose? Well I gave my demonstration and was highly applauded.
Bother that voice. I am burning to tell you about it. My boys were
grand and we carried all before us, so I was told by Uncle Toby. He
came over to me as soon as we had finished, and said he was as
proud of the performance as if it had been his own, and is going to
tell you about it himself when he can get away. I am keen to get to
work now. I have got my boys so keen too, so give me cases that
want healing in the etheric mind, Mumsie darling. Well, what
orders?" R. "<i>Mrs. H&mdash;?"</i> "She is very confident in her
knowledge of her boy's wishes but I think he may have changed very
considerably. Nothing was more unlikely in my earth life than that
I should be trying to heal people's minds! Yet that's what I now
long to do. So her son has probably got completely new ideas of
what he wants to do now. Yes, all right, I'll be off and see him.
Lance says he has workshops and was teaching, did he? And she
thinks he ought to be in the Navy&mdash;well of all the silly
ideas! There ain't no Navy over here, thank God! R. <i>"She meant
helping those in the Navy."</i> "Not old enough yet for that kind
of work, I guess. All right, I'll bring a report, Mumsie."</p>

<p><i>Lancelot:</i> "Of course I'm here but you are wanting to
listen? O.K. as Chris says. I want to give you a thought to think
over my work: I can't clear minds that aren't wanting to be
cleared, but your prayers CAN. I have to be governed by wills of
men, if they will 'NO' I can't clear their minds, but GOD can
change them altogether, so if you send GOD'S POWER over here to me
in Germany it will do more than any of us." <i>Music on the
wireless.</i> "O Mum how lovely! O may we listen again." <i>(Pause
to listen.)</i> R. <i>suddenly saw L. upside down.</i> "I'm sorry
Mum if I startled you but it was so tempting: you were so far out
of your skin that I just said 'BO' and you shut up back again like
a winkle. This is a great day and I'm glad to be home to hear all
that lovely music.</p>

<p>"The H&mdash;boy? I remember, a nice lad. He was so pleased at
being allowed to teach younger children; and was giving them a
lesson in collecting ideas from the countryside to complete their
models of what they enjoy most. One of the early lessons in mind
training of creative thoughts is to find out your thinking of most
enjoyment, and make a model by wanting it to be. He was deeply
interested in showing them how to build their models in his
workshop, out of will-power, not tools. I think he will be a great
worker and go overhead early just as I did."</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "I am not able to report much to-day, having
been having a beano with my pals! They wanted to feast me on my
promotion to Capt. and gave me a jolly good show of fireworks on
the etheric plane&mdash;quite glorious they were, with all sorts of
marvellous colours in 'em, to the tune of 'He's a jolly good
fellow,' and I was blushing with pleasure at their love of me. So I
gave a part of my time since last seeing you, to admiring their
display and having speeches and so forth.</p>

<p>"A message from Uncle Toby to say you are to expect us all on my
birthday. He is getting up a party for ME! Isn't that good of him?
Can you fix a time so that we shall be free? I mean <i>you</i> will
be free&mdash;we are free already! I think early is better than
evening when you're tired; yes, 5.30 till 7&mdash;grand. I'll tell
Uncle Toby that. Darling it is sweet of you to do it: not many boys
have such mothers as you. They get no parties connected with their
homes, poor devils!</p>

<p>"Can Dad take part in it? I shall want him to be there, of
course, but can't he be co-opted in some way? Buy him a Planchette,
praps he'd use that to talk to us? Dave too. Yes, Mumsie, do buy a
Planchette and see if they could use it? It's awfully easy I
believe. You are superior to that method, but I would like to get
Dad in too, with a party in my honour going on&mdash;it seems
unfair to leave him out just reading it afterwards. get him to try
a bit beforehand, and see if it works. I see, shall I come later
on? O.K. Silent Minute and talk after again. I'm free now all
day."</p>

<p><i>(After 9 p.m.)</i> "Came here on a wave of home-longing, I
didn't know I could travel so fast! Are you getting a Planchette
for Dad? Can't buy them? I see lots of people using them. All
right, can't be helped I suppose, but I thought it would be great
to talk to Dad. You can understand how I long to talk direct to my
Dad, I love him so much. He can't manage enough power for a pencil,
but a thing on wheels runs so easily I thought he would sometimes
talk to me on that&mdash;but I don't mind, only should shout for
joy if we could talk direct. Never mind, Mumsie darling, he'll talk
to me here one day. I must be off now. Coming on Sunday next I
expect. Carry on and have lots of cases for me then. God bless you
both. CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>July 12th.</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, I wanted yesterday to come, but had to see a personal
friend of Uncle Toby's about my party. You aren't very bright
today. R. <i>"A headache."</i> "I see, let's see if we can cure it.
A good patient, you relax well." <i>(Pause.)</i> "About the
collective effort for the enlightenment of England, I am organising
on our side a crowd of helpers, who are taking every opportunity to
control people who are psychic, so there is little danger now of
any getting under low control unless they definitely invite it by
their own low minds. So you can go ahead and tell anyone you like
and show them how with safety&mdash;we are educating them all the
time too. Your headache gone now? O.K. I'll be off too. Au revoir,
Mumsie."</p>

<p><i>(Later)</i> "O Mumsie, you are so sweet, I nearly kissed you
on your lips but you drew back into your shell too quickly. I want
you to tell Dad that his lessons in church are doing more good than
he knows of. I was in church with him one Sunday, and I saw how
deeply it impressed so many there. They started thinking quite
etherically. I mean they opened their minds to think about other
things than themselves. Lots of minds go to church to think
entirely about themselves; if they have been good and so
forth&mdash;which does them not a scrap of good, rather
otherwise&mdash;Dad gives them time to think of other people's
writings of ancient times, and some of them get quite interested
and forget their own feelings.</p>

<p>Clever of me to give your head a rest, but you will sleep it
away to-night and be O.K. to-morrow I guess. Yes, I am away now.
See you Sunday next I suppose and I'll go to church with Dad again.
Sweet Mumsie farewell, your loving son, CHRIS."</p>

<p><i>July 15th, 1945.</i>
</p>

<p><i>V&mdash;. M&mdash;.</i> "Can you be patient over me? My name
is M&mdash;. I am a German woman, you do overlook this? Continue
may I? Can myself understand not how you so obliging are to let me
talk so closely, for I was of bitterness full till laitly. Now see
my fault do I; compatriot of all and all men are actually so to
others. Show my country will I of this strange new life over here
so to themselves prepare and come not as I so unknowing of it. You
have seen a difficulty? (R. <i>"They will not under-stand
you.")</i> "No, yet try must I for it is of extreme importance that
they have this knowledge, so no more they strive their country only
but know of all are connected here as one people. I shall my part
strive to play in your so right work to send news in other minds as
you now do. You so kind have been. May I come again? <i>V&mdash;.
M&mdash;.</i></p>

<p><i>(From Another)</i> "Your son is listening to communications
from a crusader and cannot come now.</p>

<p><i>July 16th, 1945.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "O Mumsie, I am so excited at our Conference
yesterday, and want to tell you if you'll give me a minute. A great
Spirit came from Sirius, and showed us our part of the Plan in the
Universe&mdash;it seemed all so plain when he was speaking, because
he gave our minds a grasp of other planes of being, but after he
had gone I was unable to grasp more than the tiny bit we are to
carry out on Earth. It is a great plan of God for this whole
Universe, but each of us has a bit of it to do. All I can remember
now is a sense of reality and urgency about our work, yours and
mine, and a knowledge that we shall know more about it as we get
higher in spirit. I was left with a feeling of great expectancy, as
if our Earth was getting ready to take a bigger part in the Plan,
and all us human beings must work like ni***rs to fit ourselves for
the next step we must soon take. "Carry on"&mdash;he seemed to
say&mdash;"get on with your jobs, you will soon be needed in the
Universe as a whole"&mdash;I feel it is Great to be a
Man&mdash;"Carry on"&mdash;I mean to do so, God help me.
Zola&mdash;that is the name he gave us. Spreading the Light is of
infinite importance&mdash;Spread it in prayer if no one asks your
help, but SPREAD IT. I want to lift all men's minds up to know
Truth now..."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you another of my curious adventures? Dad would
like to hear it maybe. Uranus lay in our path on my last voyage, so
we swiftly descended to allow our guide to give the inhabitants a
message. You cannot conceive in your mind what it was like, but it
reminded me of quantities of jam. Piles of matter in a soft state
with creatures alive imbedded in it like raspberry pips in
raspberry jam! Our guides business was with certain great spirits
in charge of the planetary affairs, so I had no chance of seeing
these creatures closely. O no, it wasn't all red like jam, all
sorts of kinds of colours, but a kind of jammy consistency in which
live beings moved. Only a part of it was like that; we didn't
really land, so I saw no more than a small bit of it. Don't use 2nd
sheet, must be off now."</p>

<p><i>July 18th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> " Lance took me over his apparatus to watch
it working and I saw how a streak of luminosity appeared in the
clouds of anger and animosity engendered by our conquest. He turned
on the force of concentrated will-power and a whole area cleared
into sunny, happier feelings of hope. He has invented this means of
absorbing will-power of many high minds into this directive
instrument which works by his or another's volition as a means of
etheric purifier. Not well expressed, but I am held up for words. I
was intensely interested in the sight, and hopeful of great help to
our leaders now holding this conference. Mumsie, how soon does Dave
come home? O I'll arrange to be more at home then, but now I want
to be away a bit to help over Berlin, it is so important for the
world's future to keep their atmosphere pure. (R. <i>"Mrs.
W&mdash;needs help.")</i> "I see, well, I'll soon be back, and she
isn't desperate is she?&mdash;I think I ought to stay and help her
first, as Lance can get on all right really. Carry on, He
said&mdash;Carry on, and I was thinking of my own interest in
Lance's work. Good, Mumsie, you are right, and have shown me I must
beware of selfishness still. I'll go at once to Mrs. W&mdash;.
Thanks. Mumsie, you are able to think my thoughts before I even
express them!</p>

<p><i>V&mdash;. M&mdash;.:</i> "Your son is going. I come
perhaps?"</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Yes, Mumsie, I made way for a person who
spoke to you before and needs help."</p>

<p><i>V&mdash;. M&mdash;.:</i> "I so thankful am you friend to see.
Germans not much can hear yet. I speak clearly so loud. I must them
warning give so they go on no more of wrong thinking. God He cannot
hear me. I do not completely understand, but I see you more clearly
so my best will do."</p>

<p><i>August 3rd, 1945. (Christopher's birthday.)</i>
</p>

<p>"Yes, Mumsie, we are all here now, and Uncle Toby is
toast-master, he says. I am to speak first, as it is my party, and
I am terribly interested to see many of Uncle Toby's New Zealand
relatives, he has been introducing me to H&mdash;'s and
H&mdash;B&mdash;'s and A&mdash;'s and all. I can't sort 'em out
yet, too many, but he says he isn't going to inflict them all on
you only a few special ones like Auntie Win. My own pals are here
to greet me, and Dave, for I include Dave in any party I get."
<i>("Eleven relations and friends wrote with</i> R<i>'s hand in
turns&mdash;then C. wrote.")</i> "Chris speaks, Mumsie. We think
you must have a rest now, so we'll finish the party after your
supper. Plenty to amuse them all with here, as they are chattering
together like a swarm of bees! About 8.15 if you are ready by
then?"</p>

<p><i>(Later. After 8.15 five more guests wrote, Christopher and
Lancelot at the end.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>August 15th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "Come over to Sirius again with me Mumsie,
if you've time? Great things are to be exuded from there to
influence our Solar System. Great power on the spiritual planes,
and even our tiny earth will feel its repercussions. Of course I
can't, but I know its power; one can understand in spirit without
knowing in mind. Your work is linked with the spiritual power now
flowing to earth from Sirius, and you are launched on a stream of
inexhaustible power which you can't conceive of in mind at all. Our
country is destined, as I told you before, to rule the world in the
next age now dawning, and that's why this stream of spiritual power
finds expression here in England. I can't see any details of the
future, but I see clearly England's destiny.</p>

<p>"Can you take a little more in this strain? I am trying to make
you see a globe of light on Sirius, like a moon only lovely colours
of all sorts, which are colours of the spiritual essences distilled
by the holy minds there to invigorate spiritual power in our Solar
System. It is focussed on the outer rim of planetary orbits now,
and will move in focus to each orbit in turn until all have felt
the invigorating power. It is a poor description, but the best I
can do in words. It is so far beyond them really. Goodbye darling,
Love to Dad. C."</p>

<p><i>August 26th.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Christopher:</i> "I want to tell you a few hints on the
future which have come my way lately. Christ Himself is nearer
earth than for hundreds of years, and a great Light is soon coming.
Presently all will know of this, so our work will then be merged
into the greater, and is now of extreme importance to prepare men's
minds for His coming. They will know by the reflection of His Glory
on us who work in the etheric life, and our influence on men's
minds will be far more potent and clearer than before. I can't say
when this Light will come, but I am told it may appear soon. All
man's career has been so far improving material life, and he has
then set to work to destroy it! Now he has to work on different
lines altogether to create a spiritual development which will
transform the world and glorify it. I was not enlightened enough to
be told before of the Coming Light. But now I am wholly Christ's I
can work with clearer knowledge. Give me your blessing Mumsie once
again&mdash;I am buckling on my armour of light for the last
struggle of the Devil and the Victory of Christ!"...</p>
