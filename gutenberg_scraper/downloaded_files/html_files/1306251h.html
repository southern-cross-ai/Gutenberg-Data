  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01"></a>I. &mdash; THE FATE OF THE MELCART</h2>

  <p class="first">THE <i>Melcart</i>, the sacred ship of Carthage, was on its
  homeward voyage from Tyre, and had accomplished the greater part of its
  journey in safety; in fact, it was only a score or so of miles away from its
  destination. It had carried the mission sent, year by year, to the famous
  shrine of the god whose name it bore, the great temple which the Greeks
  called by the title of the Tyrian Hercules. This was too solemn and important
  a function to be dropped on any pretext whatsoever. Never, even in the time
  of her deepest distress, had Carthage failed to pay this dutiful tribute to
  the patron deity of her mother-city; and, indeed, she had never been in sorer
  straits than now. Rome, in the early days her ally, then her rival, and now
  her oppressor, was resolved to destroy her, forcing her into war by demanding
  impossible terms of submission. Her old command of the sea had long since
  departed. It was only by stealth and subtlety that one of her ships could
  hope to traverse unharmed the five hundred leagues of sea that lay between
  her harbour and the old capital of Phoenicia. The <i>Melcart</i> had hitherto
  been fortunate. She was a first-rate sailer, equally at home with the light
  breeze to which she could spread all her canvas and the gale which reduced
  her to a single sprit-sail. She had a picked crew, with not a slave on the
  rowing benches, for there were always freeborn Carthaginians ready to pull an
  oar in the <i>Melcart</i>. Hanno, her captain, namesake and descendant of the
  great discoverer who had sailed as far down the African coast as Sierra Leone
  itself, was famous for his seamanship from the Pillars of Hercules to the
  harbours of Syria.</p>

  <p>The old man&mdash;it was sixty years since he had made his first
  voyage&mdash;was watching intently a dark speck which had been visible for
  some time in the light of early dawn upon the north-western horizon. "Mago,"
  he said at last, turning to his nephew and lieutenant, "does it seem to you
  to become bigger? your eyes are better than mine."</p>

  <p>"Not that I can see," answered the young man.</p>

  <p>"She hardly would gain upon us if she has no more wind than we have. Well,
  I shall go below, and have a bite and a sup."</p>

  <p>He wetted his finger and held it up. "It strikes me," he went on, "that
  the wind, if you can call it a wind, has shifted half a point. Tell the
  helmsman to put her head a trifle to the north. Perhaps I may have a short
  nap. But if anything happens, call me at once."</p>

  <p>Something did happen before ten minutes had passed. When Mago had given
  his instructions to the helmsman, and had superintended a slight shifting of
  the canvas, he looked again at the distant ship. It had become sensibly
  larger. The wind had freshened out at sea, and was rapidly bringing the
  stranger nearer. Mago hurried below to rouse his uncle. The old man was soon
  up on deck.</p>

  <p>"I wish we were ten miles nearer home," he muttered, after taking a long
  look into the distance. "Get the oars out. If she is an enemy, and wants to
  cut us off, half a mile may make all the difference."</p>

  <p>The order was promptly obeyed, and the rowers bent to their work with a
  will. But all the will in the world could not make the <i>Melcart</i> move
  very fast through the water. She was stoutly built, as became a ship that had
  to carry a precious burden through all weather, and she was foul with the
  long voyage. The goal of the race between her and the stranger, which could
  now be seen to be a Roman ship-of-war, was a headland behind which, as Hanno
  knew, was the harbour of Chelys. Let her reach that and she was safe. But it
  seemed as if this was not to be. The Roman ship had what wind there was right
  aft, and, notwithstanding all the efforts of the <i>Melcart's</i> crew, moved
  more rapidly through the water. She would manifestly cut off the
  <i>Melcart</i> before the headland was reached. But Hanno was not yet at the
  end of his resources.</p>

  <p>"Call Mutines," he said to his lieutenant.</p>

  <p>Mutines was a half-caste Carthaginian, whose thick lips, flat nose, and
  woolly hair indicated a negro strain in his blood. "Mutines," said the old
  man, "you used to have as good an aim with the catapult as any man in
  Carthage. If your hand has not lost its cunning, now is the time to show your
  skill. Knock that rascal's steering-gear to pieces, and there is a
  quarter-talent for you."</p>

  <p>"I will do my best, sir," said Mutines; "but I am out of practice, and the
  machine, I take it, is somewhat stiff."</p>

  <p>The catapult, which was of unusual size and power, had been built, so to
  speak, into the ship's forecastle. It could throw a bolt weighing about 75
  lbs., and its range was 300 yards. While Mutines was preparing the engine,
  word was passed to the rowers that they were to give six strokes and no more.
  That, as Mutines reckoned, would be enough to bring him well within range of
  the enemy. The calculation was sufficiently exact. When the rowers stopped,
  the two ships, having just rounded the headland, were divided by about 350
  yards. The impetus of the <i>Melcart</i> carried her over about 100 more.
  When she was almost stationary Mutines let fly the bolt. He had never made a
  happier shot. The huge bullet carried away both the tillers by which the
  steering paddles were worked. The ship fell away immediately, and the
  <i>Melcart</i>, for whose rowers the fugleman set the liveliest tune in his
  repertory, shot by, well out of range of the shower of arrows which the Roman
  archers discharged at her. In the course of a few minutes she had reached the
  harbour of Chelys.</p>

  <p>But her adventures were not over. The captain of the Roman ship was
  greatly enraged at the escape of his prey. To capture so famous a prize would
  mean certain promotion, and he was not prepared to resign his hopes without
  an effort to realize them. As soon as the steering-gear had been temporarily
  repaired, he called his sailing-master, and announced his intention of
  following the Carthaginian into the harbour.</p>

  <p>The man ventured on a remonstrance. "It's not safe, sir," he said; "I
  don't know the place, but I have heard that the water is shallow everywhere
  except in the channel of the stream."</p>

  <p>"You have heard my orders," returned the captain, who was a Claudius, and
  had all the haughtiness and obstinacy of that famous house. The
  sailing-master had no choice but to obey.</p>

  <p>Chelys, so called from the fancied resemblance of its site to the shape of
  a tortoise, was a small Greek settlement which lay within the region
  dominated by Carthage. It was a place of considerable antiquity&mdash;older,
  its inhabitants were fond of asserting, than Carthage itself. For some years
  it had maintained its independence, but as time went by this position became
  more and more impossible. Had Chelys possessed any neighbours of the same
  race, a league might have given her at least a chance of preserving her
  freedom. But she stood absolutely alone, surrounded by Ph&oelig;nician
  settlements, and she had no alternative but to make her submission to her
  powerful neighbour. She obtained very favourable terms. She was free from
  tribute, no slight privilege, in view of the enormous sums which the ruling
  city was accustomed to exact from her dependencies. She was allowed to elect
  her own magistrates, and generally to manage her own affairs. To contribute a
  small contingent to the army and navy of the suzerain state was all that was
  demanded of her. It was natural, therefore, that Chelys should be loyal to
  Carthage&mdash;far more loyal, in fact, than most of that city's
  dependencies. Rome, which had more than once exacted a heavy sum as the price
  of the little town's immunity from ravage, she had no reason to like.</p>

  <p>The incident described above had taken place within full view of the piers
  and quays of Chelys. The excited population which crowded them had hailed
  with an exulting shout the fortunate shot that had crippled the Roman vessel,
  and had warmly welcomed the <i>Melcart</i> as she glided into the shelter of
  the harbour. Their delight was turned into rage when it became evident that
  the enemy was intending to pursue her. The insolent audacity of the
  proceeding excited the spectators beyond all bounds. Stones and missiles of
  all kinds were showered upon the intruders. As the ship was within easy range
  of the quays on both sides of the harbour, which was indeed of very small
  area, the crew suffered heavily.</p>

  <p>Claudius perceived that he had made a mistake, and gave orders to the
  rowers to back, there not being space enough to turn. It was too late, and
  when a huge pebble, aimed with a fatal accuracy, struck down the steersman
  from his place, the doom of the Melicerta&mdash;for this was the name of the
  Roman ship&mdash;was sealed. A few moments afterwards she grounded.</p>

  <p>This was, of course, the signal for a determined attack. Hundreds of men
  waded through the shallow water and climbed over the bulwarks. The crew made
  a brave resistance, but they were hopelessly outnumbered and were cut down
  where they stood. The magistrates of the city happened to be in consultation
  in the town-hall. Disturbed in the midst of their deliberations by the sudden
  uproar they hurried down to the waterside, but were too late to save any but
  a very few lives. Claudius had stabbed himself when he saw how fatal a
  mistake he had made.</p>

  <p>Chelys was, of course, in a tumult of delight at its brilliant success in
  destroying a Roman ship-of-war. Its responsible rulers, however, were very
  far from sharing this feeling. A defenceless city, and Chelys was practically
  such, for its walls, never very formidable, had been suffered to fall into
  decay, must take no part in the hostilities of a campaign. So long as it
  observes this neutrality it is really better off than a fortified town, but
  to depart from this policy is sheer madness.</p>

  <p>The magistrates did all they could. They sent back the few prisoners whom
  they had been able to rescue from the hands of the populace, to the commander
  of the squadron to which the Melicerta had belonged. They offered to pay an
  indemnity. They went so far as to promise that the ringleaders of the riot
  should be handed over for trial. The Roman admiral, a Flaminius, and so
  belonging to a family that had more than once made itself notorious for
  unusual brutality, would not hear of making any conditions. He determined
  upon a vengeance which was not the less pleasing because it would be as
  lucrative as it was cruel. Chelys was to be visited with the severest penalty
  known in warfare&mdash;all the male inhabitants of the military age and over
  were to be put to death, the women and children were to be sold as slaves.
  The slaves from Chelys, as Flamininus, a shrewd and unscrupulous man of
  business knew, would fetch a high price. They were Greeks, if not of the
  purest blood, and while barbarians in any number could be easily obtained,
  Greek slaves were a rare article in the market.</p>

  <p>His resolve once taken, Flamininus took every precaution that its
  execution should be as complete as possible. The magistrates, who had come to
  intercede for their countrymen, were detained; no hint of what was intended
  was allowed to reach the doomed city. Landing the half legion of marines
  which the squadron carried he occupied in irresistible force Chelys and all
  the roads by which it could be approached or left. His next step was to make
  what may be called an inventory of the prey which had fallen into his hands.
  The census roll of citizens was seized, and information about their families
  was purchased from some prisoners who were willing thus to redeem their
  lives. A few wealthy men and women were allowed to ransom themselves at the
  highest prices that could be extorted from their fears; and then, when a few
  days had been allowed for the assembling of the slave-dealers, who, with
  other animals of prey, human and non-human, followed the armies and fleets of
  Rome, Flamininus allowed the deputation to return, and proceeded to execute
  his sentence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap02"
     name="chap02"></a>II. &mdash; CLEANOR, SON OF LYSIS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE wealthiest, best-born, and generally most influential
  citizen in Chelys was Lysis, son of Cleanor, father himself of another
  Cleanor, so named, according to a custom common in Greek families, after his
  grandfather. He was descended in a direct line from the original founder of
  the settlement, an Ephesian Greek, and was also distinguished by the
  possession of the hereditary priesthood of Apollo. The family prided itself
  on the purity of its descent. The sons sought their brides among four or five
  of the noblest Ephesian families. The general population of Chelys, though
  still mainly Hellenic in speech and habits of life, had a large admixture of
  Ph&oelig;nician blood, but the house of Lysis could not be reproached with a
  single barbarian misalliance.</p>

  <p>Lysis had been the leader and spokesman of the deputation which had vainly
  approached the Roman commander. His house, in common with all the principal
  dwellings in the town, had been occupied by the Roman marines.</p>

  <p>But a douceur, judiciously administered to the sub-officer in command, had
  procured for him the privilege of a brief period of privacy. He found that
  his wife and children were still in ignorance of the Roman admiral's
  decision. They did not, indeed, expect any very lenient terms&mdash;they
  looked for a fine, that would seriously cripple their means; but they were
  not prepared for the brutal reality. Lysis tasted for the first time the full
  bitterness of death when he had to dash to the ground the hope to which they
  had clung.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said in answer to a question from his wife, unable or unwilling
  to believe her ears; "yes, it is too true&mdash;death or slavery."</p>

  <p>Dioné&mdash;this was the wife's name&mdash;grew pale for a moment, but she
  summoned to her aid the courage of her house&mdash;she claimed to be
  descended from the great Ion himself, the legendary head of the Ionic
  race&mdash;and recovered her calmness. Stepping forward, she threw her arms
  round her husband's neck. Her first thought was for him; her second, scarcely
  a moment later, for her children.</p>

  <p>"And these?" she said.</p>

  <p>Recovering himself with a stupendous effort of self-control, Lysis
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Listen; the time is short, and there are grave matters to be settled. It
  was hinted to me, and more than hinted, that I might purchase your life,
  Dioné, and my own. These Romans are almost as greedy for money as for blood.
  What say you?"</p>

  <p>"And these?" said the woman, pointing to her children, while her cheek
  flushed and her eyes brightened with the glow of reviving hope. "Can they
  also be ransomed?"</p>

  <p>"That is impossible," said Lysis.</p>

  <p>"Then we will die."</p>

  <p>"That is what I knew you would say, and I gave the fellow&mdash;it was the
  admiral's freedman who spoke to me about the matter&mdash;the answer, 'No',
  without waiting to ask you. Our way is clear enough. My father learnt from
  the great Hannibal the secret of his poison-ring, and he handed it on to me.
  You and I can easily escape from these greedy butchers, but our
  children&mdash;" He struggled in vain to keep his self- command. Throwing
  himself on a couch hard by, he covered his face with his cloak.</p>

  <p>The children were twins, very much alike, as indeed twins very commonly
  are, and yet curiously different. Apart, they might easily have been mistaken
  for each other, supposing, of course, that they dressed alike; seen together,
  any one would have said that such a mistake would hardly be possible, so
  great was the difference in colour and complexion&mdash;a difference that
  impresses the eye much more than it impresses the memory. But whatever
  dissimilarity there was accidental rather than natural. Cleanor had been
  seized at a critical period of his growth with a serious illness, the result
  of exposure in a hunting expedition. This had checked, or more probably,
  postponed his development. His frame had less of the vigour, his cheek less
  of the glow of health than could be seen in his sister's, of whom, indeed, he
  was a somewhat paler and feebler image.</p>

  <p>"We will die with you," said the twins in one breath. They often spoke,
  as, indeed, they often thought, with a single impulse.</p>

  <p>"Impossible again!" said Lysis. "The priesthood which, as you know, I
  inherited from my fathers, I bound, under curses which I dare not incur, to
  hand on to my son. If the gods had made me childless&mdash;and, for the first
  time in my life, I wish that they had&mdash;I must have adopted a successor.
  This, indeed, I have done, to provide for the chances of human life; but you,
  Cleanor, must not abdicate your functions if it is in any way possible for
  you to perform them. And then there is vengeance; that is a second duty
  scarcely less sacred. If you can live, you must, and I see a way in which you
  can."</p>

  <p>"And I see it too," cried the girl, with sparkling eyes. "Cleanor, you and
  I must change places. You have sometimes told me that I ought to have been
  the boy; now I am going to be."</p>

  <p>"Cleoné!" cried the lad, looking with wide eyes of astonishment at his
  sister; "I do not know what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Briefly," replied the girl, "what I mean is this. You masquerade as a
  girl, and are sold; I masquerade as a man, and am killed."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" cried the lad; "I cannot let you die for me."</p>

  <p>"Die for you, indeed!" and there was a touch of scorn in her voice. "Which
  is better&mdash;to die, or be a slave? Which is better for a man? You do not
  doubt; no one of our blood could. Which is better for a woman? It does not
  want one of our blood to know that. The meanest free woman knows it. By
  Castor! Cleanor, this is the one thing you can do for me. Die for you,
  indeed! You will be doing more, ten thousand times more, than dying for
  me!"</p>

  <p>"She is right, my son," cried Lysis. "This was my very thought.
  Ph&oelig;bus, the inspirer, must have put it into her heart. Cleanor, it must
  be so. This is your father's last command to you. The gods, if gods there
  are&mdash;and this day's work might make doubt it&mdash;will reward you for
  it. But the time is short. Hasten, and make such change as you need."</p>

  <p>The twins left the chamber. When they returned, no one could have known
  what had been done, so complete was the disguise which Cleoné's skilful
  fingers had effected. The girl's flowing locks, which had reached far below
  her waist, now fell over her Shoulders, just at the length at which it was
  the fashion of the Greek youth to wear them, till he had crossed the
  threshold of manhood. His were rolled up, maiden- fashion, in a knot upon his
  head. She had dulled her brilliant complexion by some pigment skilfully
  applied. His face, pale with misery, needed no counterfeit of art.</p>

  <p>Lysis and his wife had gone. By a supreme effort of self-sacrifice they
  had denied themselves the last miserable solace of a farewell, and were lying
  side by side, safe for ever from the conqueror's brutality. While Cleanor and
  his sister waited in the expectation of seeing them, a party of marines
  entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Fasten his hands, Caius," said the sub-officer to one of his men, "and
  firmly too, for he looks as if he might give us trouble. By Jupiter! a
  handsome youth! What a gladiator he would make! Why do they kill him in this
  useless fashion? The girl is your business, Sextus. Be gentle with her, but
  still be on your guard, for they will sometimes turn. But she looks a poor,
  spiritless creature."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03"></a>III. &mdash; THE LAST OF A VETERAN</h2>

  <p class="first">THE fate of Chelys caused wide-spread indignation and
  disgust even among the enemies of Carthage. No one was more indignant than
  Mastanabal, King Masinissa's second son. The prince had tastes and habits
  very uncommon in the nation of hunters and fighters to which he belonged. He
  was a lover of books, and disposed to be a patron of learning, if he could
  only find learning to patronize. The Greek population of Chelys had always
  preserved some traces of culture, and the Numidian prince was on terms of
  friendship with the settlement. He was an occasional visitor at its
  festivals, had received the compliment of a crown of honour, voted to him in
  a public assembly, and had shown his appreciation of the distinction by
  building for the community a new town-hall.</p>

  <p>His intercession had been implored by the magistrates when they found
  themselves repulsed by the commander. Unfortunately he was absent home when
  their messenger arrived. Immediately on his return he hurried to the spot.
  Too late, even if it had in any case been possible, to hinder the brutal
  vengeance of Flamininus, he was yet able to mitigate the lot of the
  survivors. By pledging his credit to the slave-dealers, themselves disposed
  to accommodate so powerful a personage, he was able to secure the freedom of
  all the captives.</p>

  <p>He made special inquiries about the family of Lysis, whose hospitality he
  had always enjoyed during his visits to the town, and learnt enough to induce
  him to make a personal inspection of the captives. As the melancholy
  procession passed before him, his keen eyes discovered Cleanor under his
  disguise. He had, of course, too much delicacy and good taste to inflict upon
  him the pain of a public recognition. The young man was transported u a
  closed litter to a hunting-lodge that belonged to the prince. Here he found
  himself an honoured guest. His personal wants were amply supplied; a library
  of some extent was at his disposal; and the chief huntsman waited upon him
  every morning to learn his pleasure in case he should be disposed for an
  expedition.</p>

  <p>In the course of a few days a letter from the prince was put into his
  hands. Beginning with a tactful and sympathetic reference to his misfortunes,
  it went on thus:</p>

  <p><i>Use my home as if it were your own for as long as you will. You cannot
  please me better than by pleasing yourself. But if you are minded to find
  solace for your sorrows in action&mdash;and to this I would myself advise you
  proceed to Cirta, and deliver the letter which I inclose herewith to the
  king, my father. My steward will provide you with a guide and an escort, and
  will also furnish such matters of dress and other equipment as you may need.
  Farewell!</i></p>

  <p>Cleanor's resolution was taken at once. In the course of a few hours he
  was in the saddle. Two days of easy travel brought him to Cirta, and he lost
  no time in presenting himself at the palace of King Masinissa. His letter of
  introduction, bearing as it did the seal of Prince Mastanabal, procured for
  him instant admission. The major-domo of the palace conducted him to a
  guest-chamber, and shortly afterwards one of the king's body- guard brought
  him a message that Masinissa desired to see him as soon as he had refreshed
  himself after his journey.</p>

  <p>The chamber into which the young Greek was ushered was curiously bare to
  be the audience-room of a powerful king. The walls were of mud roughly washed
  with yellow; it was lighted by two large openings in the walls, unglazed, but
  furnished with lattices which could be closed at will by cords suspended from
  them; the pavement was of stone, not too carefully smoothed; for furniture it
  had a sideboard, with some cups, flagons, and lamps upon it, a table, two or
  three chairs for the use of visitors who were accustomed to these comfortless
  refinements, and a divan piled up with bright-coloured mats and blankets.
  Near the divan was a brazier in which logs were smouldering.</p>

  <p>Masinissa, king of Numidia, was a man whose intellect and physical powers
  were alike remarkable. He had consolidated the wandering tribes of Northern
  Africa into a kingdom, which he had kept together and aggrandized with a
  politic firmness which never blundered or wavered. His stature, though now
  somewhat bowed with years, was exceptional. His face, seamed with a thousand
  wrinkles, and burnt to a dark red by unnumbered suns, the snowy whiteness of
  hair and beard, and the absolute emaciation of his form, on which not a trace
  of flesh seemed to be left, spoke of extreme old age. And indeed he had more
  than completed his ninetieth year, an age not phenomenally rare among us,
  where the climate and the habits of life are less exhausting, but almost
  unheard of in a race whose fervid temperament seems to match their burning
  sky.</p>

  <p>The old man's strength was now failing him. Two years before, he had
  commanded an army in the field, and commanded it with brilliant success,
  routing the best troops and the most skilled generals that Carthage could
  send against him. He was not one of the veterans who content themselves with
  counsel, while they leave action to the young. That day he had remained in
  the saddle from sunrise to sunset, managing without difficulty a fiery steed,
  whose saddle was no seat of ease. He had showed that on occasion he could
  deal as shrewd a blow with the sword, and throw as straight a javelin, as
  many men of half his age. But at ninety years of age two or three years may
  make a great difference. Masinissa had fought his last battle. His senses
  were as keen as ever, the eyes flashed with their old fire, but his breathing
  was heavy and laboured, and his hands shook with the palsy of age.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Cleanor!" he said with a full resonant voice that the years had
  not touched, "my son commends you to me. Can you be content to wait on an old
  man for a month or so? I shall hardly trouble you longer. I have never been a
  whole day within doors save once for a spear wound in the throat, and once
  when they tried to poison me; and those who have lived in such fashion don't
  take long dying."</p>

  <p>Cleanor found his task an easy one. The old king suffered little, except
  from the restlessness which comes with extreme exhaustion. Even over this he
  maintained a remarkable control. It was not during his waking hours, but in
  his short periods of fitful slumber, that the uneasy movements of his limbs
  might be observed. His intelligence was as keen as ever, and his memory
  curiously exact, though it was on the far past that it chiefly dwelt. What a
  story the young Greek could have pieced together out of the old man's
  recollections? He had seen and known the heroes of the last fierce struggle
  between Carthage and Rome, had ridden by the side of the great Scipio at
  Zama, and had been within an ace of capturing the famous Hannibal himself as
  he fled from that fatal field. The young Greek, surprised to find himself in
  such a position, was naturally curious to know why the old man preferred the
  companionship of a stranger to that of his own kindred. When he ventured to
  hint something of the kind, the king smiled cynically.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," he said, "the amiable ways of such a household as
  mine. What do you think would have been the result if I had chosen one of my
  three sons to be with me now? Why, furious jealousy and plots without end on
  the part of the other two. And if I had had the three of them together? Well,
  I certainly could not have expected to die in peace. Quarrel they certainly
  will, but I can't have them quarrelling here. Mind, I don't say that they are
  worse than other sons; on the contrary, they are better. I do hope they may
  live in peace when I am gone; at least, I have done my best to secure
  it."</p>

  <p>As the days passed, the king grew weaker and weaker, but his faculties
  were never clouded, and his cheerfulness was unimpaired.</p>

  <p>About ten days after the conversation recorded above, a Greek physician,
  whose reputation was widely spread in Northern Africa, arrived at the palace.
  The three princes had sent him. Masinissa, informed of his coming, made no
  difficulty about seeing him. "I am not afraid of being poisoned," he said
  with a smile;" I really do not think that my sons would do such a thing. It
  would not be worth while, and, anyhow, they could not agree about it. Yes,
  let him come in. Of course he can't do me any good; but it is one of the
  penalties to be paid for greatness, that one must die according to rule. No
  one of any repute is allowed to die in these parts without having Timaeus to
  help him off. Yes, I will see him. And mind, Cleanor, when he has examined me
  have a talk with him, and make him tell you the absolute truth."</p>

  <p>That afternoon after the physician had departed, the king summoned the
  young Greek to his chamber.</p>

  <p>"Well, what doe she say, Cleanor?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The young man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Come," cried the old king, raising his voice. "I command you to speak. As
  for these physicians, it is quite impossible for a patient to get the truth
  out of them. It seems to be a point of honour not to tell it. But I suppose
  he told it to you. Speak out, man; you don't suppose that I am afraid of what
  I have faced pretty nearly every day for nearly fourscore years."</p>

  <p>"He said," answered Cleanor in a low voice, "that your time, sire, was
  nearly come."</p>

  <p>"And how many days, or, I should rather say, hours did he give me?"</p>

  <p>"He said that you could hardly live more than two days."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am ready. I have had my turn, a full share of the feast of life,
  and it would be a shameful thing if I was to grudge to go. But there is
  trouble ahead for those who are to come after me. I have done my best for my
  kingdom, yet nothing can save it long. You know, I had to choose, when I was
  about your age, between Rome and Carthage, and my choice was the right one.
  If I had taken sides with Carthage, Rome would have swallowed up this kingdom
  fifty years ago; as it is, she will swallow us up fifty years hence. Sooner
  or later we are bound to go. But it has lasted my time, and will last my
  sons' time too, if they are wise. And now, as to this matter. I have
  something to put in your charge. You have heard of Scipio?"</p>

  <p>Cleanor nodded his assent.</p>

  <p>"He came over here some two months ago, when I had had my first warning
  that my time was short, and that I had best set my affairs in order. No one
  had any notion but that he came on military business. The Romans had asked me
  for help, and I didn't choose to give it just then. They hadn't consulted me
  in what they had done, and it was time, I thought, that they should have a
  lesson. We did discuss these matters; but what he really came for was a more
  serious affair. I left it to him to divide my kingdom between my three sons.
  I had thought of dividing it in the usual way; this and that province to one,
  and this and that province to another. But he had quit another plan in his
  head, and it seemed to me wonderfully shrewd. 'Don't divide the kingdom,' he
  said; 'the three parts would be too weak to stand alone. Divide the offices
  of the kingdom. Let each prince have the part for which he is best
  fitted&mdash;one war and outside affairs, another justices, and a third,
  civil affairs.' Well I took his advice, and had this settlement put in
  writing. The chief priest of the temple of Zeus in Cirta here has the
  document in his keeping."</p>

  <p>After this the old man was silent for a time. Rousing himself again, for
  he had been inclined to doze, he said:</p>

  <p>"Cleanor, are you here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sire," replied the Greek.</p>

  <p>"Don't leave me till all is over. And now give me a cup of wine."</p>

  <p>"But sire&mdash;the physician said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pooh! what does it matter if I die one hour or two or three hours before
  sunrise? And I want something that will give me a little strength."</p>

  <p>Cleanor filled a cup and handed it to the king. "It hardly tastes as good
  as usual," said the old man, when he had drained it, "yet that, I can easily
  believe, is not the wine's fault, but mine. But tell me, do you think that I
  shall know anything about what is going on here when I am gone? What does
  Mastanabal say? I haven't had time to think about these things; but he reads,
  and you are something of a student too. What do the philosophers say?"</p>

  <p>"Aristotle thinks, sire, that the dead may very well know something about
  the fortunes of their descendants&mdash;it would be almost inhuman, he says,
  if they did not&mdash;but that it will not be enough to make them either
  happy or unhappy."</p>

  <p>"Well, the less one knows the better, when one comes to think. To see
  things going wrong and not be able to interfere! ... But enough of this...
  And now, Cleanor, about yourself. You do not love the Romans, I think?"</p>

  <p>The young Greek's face flushed at the question. "I have no reason to love
  them, sire."</p>

  <p>"Very likely not. Indeed, who does love them? Not I; if I could crush them
  I would, as readily as I stamp my foot on a viper's head. But that is not the
  question. Can you make use of them? You shake your head. It does not suit
  your honour to pretend a friendship which you do not feel. That has not been
  my rule, as you know, but there is something to be said for it. Well, it is a
  pity that you can't walk that way. Whether we love them or no, depend upon
  it, the future belongs to them. And I could have helped you with some of
  their great men. I have written a letter to Scipio, and two or three others
  to powerful people in Rome who would help you for my sake. You can deliver
  them or not as you please. But tell me, what are you going to do if the
  Romans are out of the question?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of going to Carthage," answered the young man in a hesitating
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Carthage!" repeated the king in astonishment. "Why, the place is doomed.
  It can't hold out more than a year,&mdash;or two at the outside. And then the
  Roman's won't leave so much as one stone standing upon another. They won't
  run the chance of having another Hannibal to deal with. Carthage! You might
  as well put a noose round your neck at once!"</p>

  <p>"I hope not, sire," said the young man. "And in any case I have only
  Carthage and Rome to choose between."</p>

  <p>"Well," replied the old king after a pause, "you must go your own way. But
  still I can help you, at least with some provision for the journey. Put your
  hand under my pillow and you will find a key."</p>

  <p>The young man did as he was told.</p>

  <p>"Now open that chest in yonder corner, and bring me a casket that you will
  find wrapped up in a crimson shawl."</p>

  <p>Cleanor brought the casket and put it into the king's hands. Masinissa
  unlocked it and took out a rouleau of gold pieces, which he gave to Cleanor.
  "That will be useful for the present," he said; "but gold is a clumsy thing,
  and you can hardly carry about with you what would serve for a single year.
  This bit of parchment is an order for a thousand ounces of gold&mdash;five
  hundred thousand sesterces in Roman money&mdash;on Caius Rabirius, knight, of
  the C&oelig;lian Hill in Rome, who has kept some money for me for thirty
  years or more. You can sell the parchment to Bocchar the banker in Cirta
  here. He will charge you something for his commission, but it will save you
  trouble. And he will keep the money for you, or whatever part of it you
  please. It is a very handy way of carrying about money; but there is another
  that is more handy still."</p>

  <p>The old man took out a small leather bag full of precious stones. "These,"
  he said, "you can always hide. It is true that the merchants will cheat you
  more or less when you want to sell them. Still, you will find these stones
  very useful."</p>

  <p>The jewels were worth at least five times as much as the order on the
  parchment. "It is too much," murmured the Greek. "I did not
  expect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is true that you did not expect. I have seen that all along, and that
  is one of the reasons why I give it. And as for the 'too much', you must
  leave me to judge about that. My sons will find treasure enough when they
  come to divide my goods between them. I have been saving all my life, and
  this is but a trifle which they will not miss, and which you will find very
  useful. And now give me another cup of wine After this I will sleep a while.
  You will stay,&mdash;and don't let that young villain Jugurtha come near
  me.</p>

  <p>Two or three hours afterwards Cleanor was startled to see the old man
  raise himself in bed, a thing which he had not been able to do without help
  for three or four days past. He hastened to the bedside, but the king, though
  his eyes were wide open, did not seem to see him. Yet something there was
  that he saw; his was no vacant stare, but a look full of tenderness. Then he
  began to speak, and his voice had a soft tone of which Cleanor could not have
  believed it was capable.</p>

  <p>"So, sweetest and fairest, you have not forgotten me; you, as all men
  know, no one can forget. Why am I in such haste? Nay, dearest, look in our
  mirror for an answer. And besides, when you are mine, the Romans can have
  nothing more to say. Till to-morrow, then&mdash;but stay, let me give you a
  little token. Nay,"&mdash;and his voice changed in an instant to a note of
  horror&mdash;"what, pray, has changed my love-gift to this? Faugh!"</p>

  <p>And with a gesture as of one who dashed something to the ground, he sank
  down upon the bed, and in another moment was sleeping again.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning the king's three sons, who had heard the
  physician's report of their father's health, arrived at the palace. Their
  emotion, as they knelt by the dying king, was genuine, though probably not
  very deep. The old man was perfectly self-possessed and calm.</p>

  <p>"My sons," he said, "I have done my best for you. Probably you will not
  like it. What is there, indeed, that you would all like? But lay your hands
  on my head and swear that you will accept what I have done. What it is you
  had best not know till I am gone. But trust me that I have been just to all
  of you."</p>

  <p>The princes took the oath.</p>

  <p>"Cleanor here knows where I have put away my testament, but he is bound by
  me not to tell till I am buried. And now farewell! Don't wait for the end.
  You will have your hands full, I warrant, as soon as the tribes know that the
  old man is gone."</p>

  <p>The princes left the room and the old man turned his face to the wall and
  seemed to sleep. All the rest of that day Cleanor watched, but noticed no
  change. Just before dawn he heard the sleeper draw two or three deep breaths.
  He bade the slave who was in waiting in the ante-chamber call the
  physician.</p>

  <p>But the man of science found no movement either of pulse or heart. When he
  held a mirror to the mouth, there was not the faintest sign of breath upon
  it. The world had seen the last of one of the most wonderful of its
  veterans.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap04"
     name="chap04"></a>IV. &mdash; SCIPIO</h2>

  <p class="first">THE old king's body was roughly embalmed, in order to give
  some time before the celebration of the funeral. This was a more splendid and
  impressive ceremony than had ever been witnessed in that region. The news of
  Masinissa's death had been carried far into the interior with that strange,
  almost incredible rapidity with which great tidings commonly travel in
  countries that have no regular means of communication. The old man had been
  one of the most prominent figures in Northern Africa for a space more than
  equal to an ordinary lifetime. Nor had he been one of the rulers who shut
  themselves up in their palaces, and are known, not in their persons, but by
  their acts. His long life had been spent, one might say, in the saddle. There
  was not a chief in the whole region that had not met him, either as friend or
  as foe. Many had heard from their fathers or grandfathers the traditions of
  his craft as a ruler and his prowess as a warrior, and now they came in
  throngs to pay him the last honours. From the slopes of the Atlas range far
  to the west, and from the south as far as the edge of what is now called the
  Algerian Sahara, came the desert chiefs, some of them men who had never been
  seen within the walls of a city. For that day, at least, were suspended all
  the feuds of the country, many and deadly as they were. It was the greatest,
  as it was the last honour that could be paid to the great chief who had done
  so much to join these warring atoms into a harmonious whole.</p>

  <p>The bier was carried by representatives of the states which had owned the
  late king's sway. Behind it walked his three sons; these again were followed
  by the splendid array of the war-elephants with their gorgeous trappings. The
  wise beasts, whom the degenerate successors of the old African races have
  never been able to tame, seemed to feel the nature of the occasion, and
  walked with slow step and downcast mien. Behind the elephants came rank after
  rank what seemed an almost interminable cavalcade of horsemen. The procession
  was finished by detachments of Roman troops, both infantry and cavalry, a
  striking contrast, with their regular equipment and discipline, to the wild
  riders from the plains and hills of the interior.</p>

  <p>The funeral over, there was a great banquet, a scene of wild and
  uproarious festivity&mdash;a not unnatural reaction from the enforced gravity
  of the morning's proceedings. Cleanor, who had the sober habits which
  belonged to the best type of Greeks, took the first opportunity that courtesy
  allowed of withdrawing from the revel.</p>

  <p>He made his way to a secluded spot which he had discovered in the wild
  garden or park attached to the palace, and threw himself down on the turf,
  near a little waterfall. The fatigues of the day, for he had taken a great
  part in the ordering of the morning's ceremonial, and the exhausting heat of
  the banqueting hall had predisposed him to sleep, and the lulling murmur of
  the water completed the charm.</p>

  <p>When he awoke, he found that he was no longer alone. A stranger in Roman
  dress was standing by, and looking down upon him with a kindly smile. When
  the young Greek had collected his thoughts, he remembered that he had already
  seen and been impressed by the new-corner's features and bearing. Then it
  dawned upon him that he was the officer in command of the detachment of Roman
  soldiers that had been present at the obsequies of the king.</p>

  <p>And, indeed, the man was not one to be hastily passed over, or lightly
  forgotten. In the full vigour of manhood&mdash;he was just about to complete
  his thirty-seventh year&mdash;he presented a rare combination of strength and
  refinement. His face had the regularity and fine chiseling of the Greek type,
  the nose, however, having something of the aquiline form, which is so often
  one of the outward characteristics of military genius. The beauty of the
  features was set off by the absence of moustache and beard, a fashion then
  making its way in Italy, but still uncommon elsewhere. To the Greek it at
  once suggested the familiar artistic conception of the beardless Apollo.</p>

  <p>But the eyes were the most remarkable feature of the face. They expressed
  with a rare force, as the occasion demanded, kindliness, a penetrating
  intelligence, or a righteous indignation against evil. But over and above
  these expressions, they had from time to time a look of inspiration. They
  seemed to see something that was outside and beyond mortal limits. In after
  years it was often said of Scipio&mdash;my readers will have guessed that I
  am speaking of Scipio&mdash;that he talked with the gods. Ordinary observers
  did not perceive, or did not understand it. To a keen and sensitive nature,
  such as Cleanor's, it appealed with a force that may almost be called
  irresistible. All this did not reveal itself immediately to the young man,
  but he felt at once, as no one ever failed to feel, the inexplicable charm of
  Scipio's personality.</p>

  <p>"So you too," said the Roman, "have escaped from the revelers?"</p>

  <p>Cleanor made a movement as if to rise.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said the other, "do not disturb yourself. Let me find a place by
  you;" and he seated himself on the grass. "What a home for a naiad is this
  charming little spring! But you will say that a Roman has no business to be
  talking of naiads. It is true, perhaps. Our hills, our streams, our oaks have
  no such presences in them. We have borrowed them from you. Our deities are
  practical. We have a goddess that makes the butter to come in the churn,
  curdles the milk for the cheese, and helps the cow to calve. There is not a
  function or an employment that has not got its patron or patroness. But we
  have not peopled the world of nature with the gracious and beautiful
  presences which your poets have imagined. Nor, I fancy," he added with a
  smile, "have your African friends done so."</p>

  <p>Cleanor, who would in any case have been too courteous to show to a casual
  stranger the hostility which he cherished against the Roman nation, felt at
  once the charm of the speaker's manner. He was struck, too, by the purity of
  the Roman's Greek accent, and by the elegance of his language, with which no
  fault could have been found except, perhaps, that it was more literary than
  colloquial. He laughingly acknowledged the compliment which the Roman had
  paid to the poetical genius of his countrymen.</p>

  <p>A brisk conversation on literary topics followed. Cleanor, who was of a
  studious turn, had spent a year at Athens, listening to the philosophical
  teachers who were the successors of Plato at the Academy, and another year at
  Rhodes, then the most famous rhetorical school in the world. Scipio, on the
  other hand, was one of the best-read men of his age. He was a soldier and a
  politician, and had distinguished himself in both capacities, but his heart
  was given to letters. In private life he surrounded himself with the best
  representatives of Greek and Roman culture. He now found in the young Greek,
  with whose melancholy history he was acquainted, a congenial spirit. Cleanor,
  on the other hand, who had something of the Greek's readiness to look down
  upon all outsiders as barbarians, was astonished to see how wide and how deep
  were the attainments of his new acquaintance.</p>

  <p>The two thus brought together had many opportunities of improving the
  acquaintance thus begun. Scipio had to carry out the details of the division
  of royal functions mentioned in my last chapter. This was not a thing to be
  done in a day. The three brothers accepted the principle readily enough,
  though they felt that the one to whom the army had been allotted had the
  lion's share of power. But when the principles came to be applied there were
  endless jealousies and differences of opinion. It required all Scipio's tact
  and personal influence to keep the peace unbroken.</p>

  <p>When this complicated business was finished, or at least put in a fair way
  of being finished, an untoward event cut short Scipio's sojourn in Africa.
  Two new commanders came out to take charge of the Roman army before Carthage.
  Scipio knew them to be rash and incompetent, and was unwilling to incur the
  responsibility of serving under them. Accordingly he asked for permission to
  resign his command&mdash;he held the rank of tribune. The consuls, on the
  other hand, were not a little jealous of their subordinate's reputation and,
  above all, of his name. A Scipio at Carthage had a prestige which no one else
  could hope to rival, and they were glad to get rid of him.</p>

  <p>This interruption of an acquaintance which was rapidly ripening into
  friendship had an important bearing on Cleanor's life. If anyone could have
  reconciled him to Rome, Scipio was the man. Scipio gone, the old feelings,
  only too well justified as they were, revived in full force. Hostility to
  Rome became, indeed, the absorbing passion of his life. It was a passion,
  however, which he concealed with the finesse natural to his race. For the
  present his purpose could, he conceived, be better served outside the walls
  of Carthage than within them. Accordingly he accepted an offer from
  Mastanabal that he should undertake the duties of a private secretary.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05"></a>V. &mdash; A GREAT SCHEME</h2>

  <p class="first">SCIPIO'S forebodings as to the incapacity of the new
  generals were rapidly justified. The siege operations had not been uniformly
  successful before they took over the command. There had been losses as well
  as gains. Still, on the whole, the besiegers had the balance of advantage.
  The defence had been broken down at more points than one. Carthage was
  distinctly in a worse position than it had been three months after the
  breaking out of the war. The besieged had done some damage to the Roman
  fleet, had burnt a considerable extent of siege-works, and had suffered a
  distinctly smaller loss in killed and wounded than they had been able to
  inflict on their assailants.</p>

  <p>But if the damage that they suffered was less than that which they did,
  still it was less capable of being repaired, often indeed could not be
  repaired at all. If a ship was burnt, they could not build another; the
  losses of the garrison could not be filled up; the general waste of strength
  could not be repaired. Carthage, in short, had only itself to draw upon as a
  reserve; Rome had all the countries that bordered on the Mediterranean, from
  Greece westward. These were advantages which were certain to tell in the long
  run, but meanwhile much might occur to delay the final victory.</p>

  <p>The first thing to happen in the Roman camp was that supplies began to
  fall short. The country round Carthage was, of course, so much wasted by this
  time that practically nothing could be drawn from it. Further off, indeed,
  there was plenty of food and forage, but the natives showed no readiness in
  bringing it into camp. The fact was that there was no market; buyers there
  were in plenty, but not buyers with money in hand, for the military chest was
  empty, and the pay of the soldiers months in arrear. The consequence of this
  was that the Roman generals practically raised the siege of Carthage, and
  devoted their time and strength to reducing the Carthaginian towns, hoping
  thus to supply their wants. But in this attempt they made very little
  progress. They began by attacking the town of Clypea. Here they failed. The
  fleet could not make its way into the harbour, which the towns-people had
  effectually protected by sinking a couple of ships in the entrance, and the
  Roman engineers could not reach the walls of the town.</p>

  <p>They had better fortune with another small town in the neighbourhood,
  though their success was gained in a not very creditable way. The
  towns-people were disposed to come to terms, and a conference between their
  representatives and the Roman generals was accordingly held. Terms were
  agreed upon, and the agreement had been actually signed, when some soldiers
  made their way into the town. The Romans at once broke up the meeting, and
  treated the place as if it had been taken by storm. This conduct was, of
  course, as unwise as it was wicked. Next to nothing was gained by the
  falsehood, while every Carthaginian dependency resolved to resist to the
  uttermost.</p>

  <p>Hippo was the next place to be attacked. After Carthage and
  Utica&mdash;the Roman headquarters were at Utica&mdash;Hippo was the largest
  and most important town in Northern Africa. Its docks, its harbour, its walls
  were on a grand scale. Two hundred years before, Agathocles, tyrant of
  Syracuse, in his desperate struggle with Carthage had made it the base of his
  operations. A lavish expenditure, directed by the best engineers of the time,
  had made it almost impregnable.</p>

  <p>The Roman generals had, indeed, excellent reasons for attacking it. Till
  it was in their power, they could hardly hope to capture Carthage, for it
  stood almost between their own headquarters and that city, and commanded the
  route by which stores had to be carried to the besieging army. But the Roman
  forces were quite unequal to the undertaking. Twice did the people of Hippo,
  helped by a sally from Carthage, destroy the siege-works, and when the time
  for retiring to winter quarters arrived, nothing had been accomplished by the
  besiegers.</p>

  <p>All this did vast damage to the prestige of the Romans. Far-seeing persons
  were convinced, as I have said, that the future belonged to them; but
  ordinary observers began to think, and not without some excuse, that their
  decline had begun. Among these were two out of three sons of King Masinissa.
  Possibly dissatisfaction had something to do with their state of mind. Each
  had expected to get more than Scipio's award had given him; both grudged to
  Gulussa the command of the troops, suspecting that this meant in the end
  their own subjection to him. Gulussa himself seemed to be still loyal to
  Rome, but the general discontent had not failed to reach some of the
  high-placed officers in his army.</p>

  <p>Cleanor was still with Mastanabal, and, of course, watched the progress of
  affairs with intense interest. His hopes rose high when tidings reached the
  palace that the Romans had abandoned the siege of Hippo. At the evening meal
  that day the subject was discussed, but in a very guarded way, for the prince
  was still, at least in name, an ally of Rome, and his young secretary, for
  this was the office which Cleanor now filled, was too discreet to ignore the
  fact. The hour for retiring had almost come when the confidential slave who
  waited on the prince hurriedly entered the chamber and placed a letter in his
  hands. It was a double tablet closely bound together with cords of crimson
  silk, these again being secured by seals. Hastily cutting the cords with the
  dagger which he carried at his waist, the prince read the communication with
  that impassive and inscrutable look which it is one of the necessities of a
  despotic ruler to acquire. Rising shortly after from table he bade the young
  Greek good-night, but added, as if by an after-thought, "But stay, I have a
  book, a new acquisition, to show you. Come into the library."</p>

  <p>The library was a small inner room, of a semi-circular shape, which opened
  out of the dining-hall. It had this great advantage, contemplated, no doubt,
  by the builder who designed it, that conversations held in it could not by
  any possibility be overheard. It had an outer wall everywhere except on the
  side which adjoined the dining-hall. It was built on columns, so that no one
  could listen beneath, and there was no storey over it. As long as the outer
  chamber was empty, absolute secrecy was ensured. Only a bird of the air could
  carry the matters discussed in it.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Cleanor," said the prince, and proceeded to read the following
  letter:</p>

  <p><i>Hasdrubal, son of Gisco, to King Mastanabal greeting. Know that if you
  would save Africa, now, and now only, you have the opportunity. The Romans
  have fled from Hippo fewer by a third than when they first attacked it.
  Bithyas, commander of Gulussa's cavalry, has come over to us with seven
  hundred of his best troopers. Strike then along with us such a blow as shall
  rid us of this devouring Beast now and for ever. Else you shall yourself
  surely be devoured. Think not that when Carthage is destroyed, there shall be
  any hope left for Numidia. Farewell!</i></p>

  <p>"What think of this, Cleanor?" the king asked after a pause. "I know well
  enough that you have no liking for the Romans. Indeed, why should you? But
  you can judge of how things stand, judge, doubtless, better in some ways than
  I can, for there many things that we kings never see. Speak frankly. No one
  can overhear us."</p>

  <p>"Sire," replied the young Greek, "it wants, I fear, more wisdom than I
  possess to give you any profitable counsel. I hate Rome, but I fear her. She
  makes blunders without number, but always manages to succeed in the end. She
  chooses mere fools and braggarts for her generals, but always finds the right
  man at last. So I read her history. There was a time when everyone believed
  that Hannibal would make and end of her, and yet she survived. She lost army
  after army, yet conquered in the end. After Flaminius and Varro she found a
  Scipio. And she has a Scipio now. I saw him, sire, the other day, and felt
  that he was a great man."</p>

  <p>"But he is too young." interrupted the king. "He wants some five years yet
  of the age when he can be put in chief command."</p>

  <p>"True, sire; but when a man is absolutely necessary they will have him, be
  he young or old."</p>

  <p>"Then there is their unending civil strife. What of that?"</p>

  <p>"It makes for us, no doubt. But even that they can drop on occasion."</p>

  <p>After a pause of some minutes Mastanabal spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Then, what do you advise?"</p>

  <p>"Sire," replied the young Greek, "I would advise you for the present to do
  nothing. Let me answer this letter in person, and answer it as I think best,
  if you can trust me so far. I have a plan, for I have been thinking of these
  matters night and day. But don't ask me what it is. It is better that you
  should know nothing about it. I will start at once. It might look well if you
  were to send some troopers in pursuit. Of course they must not catch me. Put
  Juba in command, and we may rely on their not being too active."</p>

  <p>"Will you carry any token from me?" asked the king.</p>

  <p>"No, sire, it is better not. Let me have the letter; that will be enough.
  Will you forgive me if I steal Whitefoot from her stable?"</p>

  <p>"Take her or any other horse that you want. Have you money enough?"</p>

  <p>"Ample, sire; your good father provided me with that."</p>

  <p>"Then, farewell! You make me curious, but I suppose that I may not ask any
  questions. In any case, and whatever happens, count me as a sure friend."</p>

  <p>Before midnight Cleanor was well on his way to Carthage. At the first
  signs of dawn he drew rein, and halted for the day at a small cluster of
  palms, where there was abundance of herbage for his horse. Starting again at
  nightfall he reached the camp of Hasdrubal just as the light was showing
  itself in the east. The camp, it should be explained, was pitched outside the
  city. The larger half of the Carthaginian army occupied it. The remainder of
  the troops were stationed within the walls under the command of another
  Hasdrubal.</p>

  <p>Cleanor, who had contrived to learn something about the arrangements of
  the camp, gave himself up into the hands of the officer commanding an
  outlying picket. Hasdrubal's letter proved, as he had anticipated, a
  sufficient passport, and he was conducted, after taking a few hours' rest,
  into the general's presence.</p>

  <p>The personality of Hasdrubal was not by any means attractive, and Cleanor
  could not help comparing his puny physique and sinister expression with the
  commanding figure and noble countenance of Scipio. The Carthaginian may be
  best described by saying that he resembled the more ignoble type of Jew. It
  is often forgotten that the Ph&oelig;nician race, of which the Carthaginian
  people was the principal offshoot, was closely akin to the Hebrew in blood
  and language. Hasdrubal showed the relationship plainly enough. His black,
  ringlety hair, prominent nose, thick, sensual lips, and keen but shifty eyes,
  were just such as might have been seen at that day in the meaner quarters of
  Jerusalem or Alexandria (then become the second capital of the Jews), and at
  the present time in the London Whitechapel or the Roman Ghetto.</p>

  <p>On the present occasion, however, Hasdrubal wore his most pleasing
  expression. He was genuinely delighted to see Cleanor, as much delighted as
  he was astonished, for he had taken it for granted that the young man had
  perished in the destruction of Chelys.</p>

  <p>"Hail, Cleanor!" he cried with a heartiness that was not in the least
  affected. "What good fortune has restored you to us? we had long given you up
  as dead."</p>

  <p>Cleanor gave him in the fewest possible words a sketch of what had
  happened.</p>

  <p>"And what can I do for you?" continued Hasdrubal. "If, as I hope, you are
  come to join us, I can find plenty of work for you. Things are looking more
  bright for Carthage than they have done for years past. We shall soon have
  all Africa with us. When that happens the Romans will have nothing left them
  but the ground that they stand on, and even that, I hope, not very long. You
  have heard of Bithyas with his squadron coming over to us? We shall soon have
  the rest of Gulussa's army following him, and then there will be Gulussa
  himself and his brothers. You have been in Mastanabal's household; tell me
  how he stands."</p>

  <p>Cleanor produced in answer Hasdrubal's own letter. "The king's position,"
  he went on, "is a very difficult one, and he must act with the greatest
  caution in your interests as well as in his own. If he declares himself too
  soon, his brothers will most certainly take the other side. What is wanted is
  a combination so strong as to compel all the three to declare themselves
  together. He wishes well to you; that I can say positively."</p>

  <p>"That is good as far as it goes, though I should have liked something more
  definite."</p>

  <p>"May I put before you," said Cleanor, "an idea which has been working for
  some time in my head? I am afraid that it is somewhat presumptuous in a youth
  such as I am to discuss such things; still, if you are willing to
  hear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say on, my young friend," cried the Carthaginian; "a son of your house is
  not likely to say anything but what is worth hearing."</p>

  <p>"I spoke of a combination which would enable Mastanabal to declare
  himself. Don't you think such a combination might be made among all those who
  hate Rome or fear her? First there is my own nation. The League is, I have
  heard, little satisfied with its powerful friends, and it needs only a little
  blowing to set that fire a-blazing. Then there are the Macedonians, who
  haven't forgotten that they were masters of the world not so very long ago.
  There is Syria, there is Egypt, both of them afraid of being swallowed up
  before long. There are the Jews, kinsmen of your own, I believe. Is it not
  so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Carthaginian, kinsmen, but not friends. I fear that we
  shall not get much help there."</p>

  <p>"Then there is Spain. What do you know, sir, of Spain? Is there any chance
  of a rising?"</p>

  <p>"The northern tribes still hold their own, but they will hardly go outside
  their own borders. They are quite content to be free themselves without
  thinking of others. Still, there is something that might be done in Spain.
  Only, unluckily, the Spaniards don't love us any more than they love the
  Romans. Perhaps they love us rather less. However, this is a promising scheme
  of yours, my young friend. Ah! If it had not been for you Greeks we should
  have had all the shores of the Sea long ago. We never could get you out of
  Sicily. It would be strange if you were now to make amends to us for all the
  mischief that you have done."</p>

  <p>Cleanor, who had read history to some purpose, could not help thinking to
  himself that mankind would hardly have been better off than it was if
  Carthage had been mistress of the west. But he put away the thought. His lot
  was cast, and he could not, would not change it. The memory of the inexpiable
  wrong that he had suffered swept over his mind, and he set himself resolutely
  to carry out his purpose.</p>

  <p>"And what do you suggest?" continued Hasdrubal.</p>

  <p>"To go myself and see what can be done," replied the Greek.</p>

  <p>"Good! And let no time be lost I don't mean that you are one to lose time;
  that you certainly are not; I mean that we had better not say anything about
  this to the authorities inside the walls. There will be questions, debates,
  delays, nothing settled, I feel sure, till it is too late. You must go
  unofficially, but I will give you letters of commendation which you will find
  useful. Succeed, and there is nothing that you may not ask, and get, from
  Carthage and from me. When shall you be ready to start?"</p>

  <p>"To-day."</p>

  <p>"And whither do you propose to go first?"</p>

  <p>"First, of course, to Greece; then to Macedonia. I hear that there is
  someone there who calls himself the son of King Philip, and that the
  Macedonians are flocking to his standard."</p>

  <p>"So be it. Farewell; and Hercules be with you!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06"></a>VI. &mdash; THE MISSION</h2>

  <p class="first">CLEANOR'S interview with Hasdrubal was followed by a long
  conversation with one of his staff, Gisco by name, in which were discussed
  the best and safest means of crossing from Africa to Greece. The Greek might
  have had at his command the best and fleetest war-galley in the docks of
  Carthage, but the idea did not at all commend itself to him. The harbour was
  not actually blockaded&mdash;Roman seamanship was hardly equal to maintaining
  a blockade, which often means the imminent peril of lying off a
  lee-shore&mdash;but it was pretty closely watched; the sea in the
  neighbourhood was patrolled by Roman ships, and the chances were at least
  equal that a Carthaginian galley would be challenged and brought to bay
  before it could reach Europe, and more than likely that if so challenged it
  would be captured. Some kind of disguise seemed to be far more promising of
  safety, and the more obscure the disguise the better the promise.</p>

  <p>A little fleet of vessels was about to sail from one of the coast villages
  for the autumn tunny-fishing, and Cleanor resolved to embark on one of them.
  It had been one of his boyish delights to spend a few days from time to time
  at sea, and he had a long-standing acquaintance, which might almost have been
  called a friendship, with the veteran master of one of these craft. The
  tunny-fishing had always been too long an affair for the lad, who had his
  duties at home to attend to. The boats were about a month or more from home
  if the shoals had to be followed far, for the tunny is a fish that lives
  mostly in deep water. But there was a standing engagement that some day or
  other, when he happened to have leisure sufficient, the thing was to be done.
  Syphax&mdash;this was the old fisherman's name&mdash;knew nothing about his
  visitor except that he was a merry, companionable lad who had a sufficient
  command of gold pieces. To politics he paid no attention whatever. If there
  was war, it made no difference to him except, possibly, to increase the
  market for his tunnies, and raise the price. Romans and Carthaginians agreed
  in liking his wares; if they paid honestly for them, it did not matter to the
  fisherman what they did in other matters.</p>

  <p>When, therefore, two or three days after his visit to Hasdrubal's camp,
  the Greek knocked at the door of Syphax's little house by the sea, he
  received a hearty welcome, and was asked no inconvenient questions.</p>

  <p>"You're just in time, young sir," cried the old man, "if you are come for
  the tunnies. We start at sunset, and, if we have luck, we shall be among them
  by dawn to-morrow. Just now the shoals are pretty near, and we may catch a
  boat-load before the new moon&mdash;it is just full to- day. But you are not
  in a hurry, I hope, if we should have to go further afield."</p>

  <p>"All right, Syphax!" replied Cleanor. "I shall be able to see it through
  this time."</p>

  <p>The old man, who had, indeed, the experience of sixty years to draw from,
  was quite right in his prediction that they would find themselves among the
  tunnies at dawn. They had been able to get over a considerable distance
  during the night. At first their progress had been slow, for it was a dead
  calm, and the sweeps had to be used. About midnight, when they were well out
  of the shelter of the land, a light breeze from the south sprang up. The
  broad lateen sail was gladly hoisted, and the little craft sped gaily along,
  making, with the wind due aft, some six or seven miles an hour. Cleanor, who
  had fallen asleep shortly after midnight, not a little fatigued by the share
  which he had insisted on taking in the rowing, was awakened, after what
  seemed to him five minutes of slumber, by the captain.</p>

  <p>"See," cried the old man, "there they are yonder. Thanks to Dagon, we have
  got among them quite as soon as I hoped."</p>

  <p>And sure enough, about three hundred yards off, just in a line with the
  sun, which was beginning to lift a crimson disk out of the sea, the water
  seemed positively alive with fish, little and big. The tunnies had got among
  a shoal of sardines, and were busy with the chase. Every now and then some
  score of small fry would throw themselves wildly out of the water to escape
  their pursuer; behind them the water swirled with the rush of some monster
  fish, whose great black fin might be discerned, by a keen eye, just showing
  above the surface. Elsewhere, one of the tunnies would leap bodily into the
  air, his silvery side gleaming in the almost level rays of the rising sun.
  The sail had already been lowered, and the sweeps, after some dozen strokes
  to give a little way to the vessel in the right direction, had been shipped
  again. In another minute the little craft had quietly glided into the middle
  of the shoal.</p>

  <p>Cleanor, in spite of all the grave preoccupation of his mind, was still
  young enough to enjoy the brisk scene which followed. There were two ways of
  securing the fish: the harpoon was one; the hand-line was the other, the hook
  being baited with a small fish or with a bit of brilliant red cloth. Syphax
  and two of his sailors used the former. Cleanor and the third sailor, a young
  man of about the same age, as being not sufficiently expert with the harpoon,
  were furnished with hand-lines.</p>

  <p>The fun was fast and furious. At his very first shot the captain drove his
  harpoon into the side of a huge tunny. So strong was the creature that it
  positively towed the boat after it for a few minutes. This gave to Cleanor's
  baited hook exactly the motion that was wanted. It was soon seized with a
  force which jerked the line out of his hand, and would infallibly have
  carried it away altogether, had it not been wound round his leg, more, it
  must be confessed, by accident than by design.</p>

  <p>A sharp struggle followed. For some time the fisherman seemed to get no
  nearer to securing his fish. It would suffer itself to be drawn up a few
  yards, and would then by a fierce rush recover and even increase its
  distance. But the line was of a thickness and strength which allowed any
  strain to be put upon it, and the hook was firmly fastened into the leathery
  substance of the fish's mouth. The creature's only chance of escape was that
  the tremendous jerks it gave might flatten the barb of the hook. This did not
  happen, for Syphax took good care that all his tackle should be of the very
  best quality, and, after a conflict of half an hour, Cleanor had the
  satisfaction of seeing his prey turn helpless and exhausted on to its side.
  He drew it up close to the vessel, glad enough to give a little rest to his
  fingers, which were actually bleeding with the friction of the line. A sailor
  put his fingers into the animal's gills, and lifted it by a great effort over
  the gunwale. It weighed a little more than a hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>The sport continued till noon, only interrupted by a few short intervals
  when the shoal moved away and had to be followed. By noon so many fish had
  been secured that it became necessary to take measures for preserving them.
  They were split open and cleaned. The choicest portions were immersed in
  casks which held a liquid used for pickling; other parts were salted lightly
  or thoroughly, according as they were intended for speedy consumption or
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>"You have brought us good luck," said Syphax to his guest, as they shared
  the last meal after a day's hard work. "In all my experience&mdash;and it
  goes back sixty years at least&mdash;I don't remember getting so much sport
  so soon. Another day or two of this and we shall have a full cargo, and may
  go home again."</p>

  <p>He had hardly spoken when his eye was caught by a strange appearance in
  the water,&mdash;strange, that is, to Cleanor, but only too familiar and
  intelligible to the old man.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he cried, "I thought that it was too good to last. Do you see that
  eddy yonder? And look, there is the brute's back-fin."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"A shark, of course," replied the old man. "They never bode any good to
  anyone. Dagon only knows where we shall find the tunnies again. They will be
  leagues away from here by sunrise to-morrow, and there is not telling what
  way they will go. However, we have done pretty well, even if we don't see
  them again this moon. To-night we will lie-to; it will be time enough in the
  morning to decide what is to be done."</p>

  <p>Cleanor had begun to fear that his experiment might turn out to be a
  failure. Nothing, he knew, would induce the old man to sail another league
  away from home when once his cargo had been completed. Accordingly he had
  hailed the shark's appearance with delight as soon as he comprehended what it
  meant, and now he turned to sleep with a lighter heart.</p>

  <p>Again did the old fisherman show himself a true prophet. The next morning,
  and for many mornings afterwards, not a tunny was to be seen. The weather,
  however, continued fine, and the little craft made its way in a leisurely
  fashion towards the north-east, a sharp look-out being kept by day, and, as
  far as was possible, by night, for the object of pursuit. Two days had passed
  in this way when masses of floating sea-weed and flocks of gulls began to
  warn the captain that he was drawing near the land.</p>

  <p>"We have been on the wrong tack," he said to Cleanor, "and must put her
  head about. We are more likely to find the fish in deep water than here."</p>

  <p>"Where are we, then?" asked the Greek.</p>

  <p>"Almost within sight of Lilybaeum, as far as I can guess."</p>

  <p>Cleanor felt that it was time to act. "Will you do me a favour?" he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied the old man, "if I possibly can."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, put me ashore."</p>

  <p>"That is easy enough, if I am not wrong in my guess as to our whereabouts.
  How long do you want to stay? I should not like to lose this fine weather. As
  for landing, I should have had to do that in any case, for we are getting
  short of water."</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to wait for me. Only land me and leave me."</p>

  <p>"What! Tired of the business, I suppose. Well, we have been a long time
  doing nothing, but we must come across the tunnies soon."</p>

  <p>Cleanor, who was anxious above all things not to be thought to have any
  serious object in view, allowed that the time did seem a little long. He had
  friends and kinsfolk, too, in Sicily, he said, and it would be a pity to lose
  the opportunity of paying them a visit. It was arranged, accordingly, that he
  should be landed, and that the crew should replenish their water-casks at the
  same time. He parted with his friends on the best of terms. Two gold pieces
  to the captain and one to each of the crew sent them away in great glee,
  singing his praises as the most open-handed young sportsman that they had
  ever had to do with.</p>

  <p>It is needless to relate in detail our hero's journey through Sicily. He
  bought a stout young horse, one of the famous breed of Sicilian cobs, at
  Agrigentum, near which place he had been landed, and reached Syracuse without
  further adventure. At Syracuse he found a merchant vessel about to start for
  Corinth, secured a berth in her, and reached that city after a rapid and
  prosperous voyage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07"></a>VII. &mdash; THE LAST OF THE GREEKS</h2>

  <p class="first">MOST of Cleanor's fellow-passengers on board the
  Nereid&mdash;for this was the name of the singularly un-nymphlike trading
  vessel that carried him to Corinth&mdash;were a curious medley of races and
  occupations. Corinth was the mart of the western world, and was frequented,
  for business or for pleasure, by all its races. There were soothsayers from
  Egypt, who found their customers all the more credulous because they boasted
  that they believed in nothing; Syrian conjurors; Hebrew slave-dealers; a
  mixed troop of commercial travellers; and a couple of grave-looking,
  long-bearded men who, in spite of their philosophers' cloaks, were perhaps
  the greediest, the most venal of all.</p>

  <p>One passenger, however, was of a very different class. He was a Syracusan
  noble, erect and vigorous notwithstanding his seventy years, whose dignified
  bearing and refined features spoke plainly enough of high breeding and
  culture. He was a descendant of Archias, the Corinthian emigrant, who, some
  six centuries before, had founded the colony of Syracuse, and he was coming,
  as he told Cleanor, in whom he had discovered a congenial companion, on a
  religious mission. The tie that bound a Greek colony to the mother city had a
  certain sanctity about it. Sentiment there was, and the bond of mutual
  advantage; but there was more, a feeling of filial reverence and duty, which
  was expressed by appropriate solemnities.</p>

  <p>"I am bringing," said Archias&mdash;he bore the same name as his far- away
  ancestor&mdash;"the yearly offering from Syracuse the daughter to Corinth the
  mother. I have done it now more than thirty times. But I feel a certain
  foreboding that I shall not come on the same errand again. If that means only
  that my own time is near, it is nothing. I have had my share of life. The
  gods have dealt bountifully with me, and if they call me I shall go without
  grumbling. But I can't help feeling that it is something more than the trifle
  of my own life that is concerned, that some evil is impending either over
  Syracuse or over Corinth. As for my own city, I don't see where the trouble
  is to come from. We have long since bowed our necks to the yoke, and we bear
  it without wincing. For bearable it is, though it is heavy. But for Corinth I
  own that I have many fears. She is restless, she is vain; she has ambitions
  to which she is not equal. The gods help her and save her, or take me away
  before my eyes see her ruin!"</p>

  <p>As they were drawing near their journey's end Archias warmly invited his
  young friend to make his home with him during his stay in Corinth.</p>

  <p>"I have an apartment," he said, "reserved for me in the home of the
  guest-friend of Syracuse. The city rents it for me, and makes me an allowance
  for the expenses of my journey. I feel bound to accept it, though, without at
  all wishing to boast of my wealth, I may say that I don't need it. You must
  not think that you are burdening a poor man&mdash;that is all. I can
  introduce you to everybody that is worth knowing in Corinth, and, if you have
  any business on hand, shall doubtless be able to help you. And it will be a
  pleasure, I assure you, to have a companion who is not wearied with an old
  man's complaints of the new times."</p>

  <p>Cleanor thankfully accepted the invitation. When the Nereid reached the
  port of Corinth he found that the Syracusan's arrival had been expected. A
  chariot was in waiting at the quay to convey them to the city. At the
  apartment all preparations for the comfort of the guests were
  complete&mdash;it was a standing order that a provision sufficient for two
  should be made. First there was the bath,&mdash;more than usually welcome
  after the somewhat squalid conditions of life on board the
  merchantman,&mdash;and after the bath a meal, excellently cooked and
  elegantly served.</p>

  <p>The meal ended, Cleanor felt moved to become more confidential with his
  new friend than he had hitherto been. Naturally he had been very reserved,
  giving no reason for Archias to suppose that he had other objects in his
  travels than amusement or instruction. But he felt that it would be somewhat
  ungracious to maintain this attitude while he was enjoying so kind and
  generous an hospitality. In a conversation that was prolonged far into the
  night he opened up his mind with considerable freedom. His precise schemes he
  did not mention; they were scarcely his own secret; and he said nothing about
  Hasdrubal, feeling&mdash;for he had studied history with intelligence and
  sympathy&mdash;that a Syracusan noble would scarcely look with favour on
  anything that came from Carthage, the oldest and bitterest enemy of his
  country. But he gave a general description of his hope and aim, a common
  union of the world under the leadership of the Greek race against the
  domination with which Rome was threatening it.</p>

  <p>The Syracusan listened with profound attention. "It has done me good," he
  said, "to hear you. I did not know that such enthusiasm was to be found
  nowadays. The very word has gone out of fashion, I may say fallen into
  disrepute. It used to mean inspiration, now it means madness. Our young men
  care for nothing but sport, and even their sport has to be done for them by
  others. They have chariots, but they hire men to drive them; the cestus and
  the wrestling ring are left to professional athletes. The only game which
  they are not too languid to practise with their own hands is the kottabos,
  and the kottabos is not exactly that for which our fathers valued all these
  things, a preparation for war. I hate to discourage you, but I should be
  sorry to see you ruining your life in some hopeless cause."</p>

  <p>"But, if I may say so much with all respect, isn't this exactly what has
  been said time after time? May there not be something better than you think,
  than anybody would think, in these frivolous young fellows? Who would have
  thought Alcibiades anything but a foolish fop, and yet what a soldier he was
  when the time came!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope that you are right," replied the old man; "only your
  Alcibiades must make haste to show himself, or else it will be too late. But
  it is not only this, the folly and frivolity of the youth, that discourages
  me; it is the hopeless meanness and jealousy of the various states. If I
  could raise from the dead the very best leader a Greek city ever had, I
  should still despair. Now listen to the story that I have to tell you. Don't
  think that I am a mere grumbler, who does his best to discourage thoughts
  that are too high for him to understand; I speak from a bitter experience.
  But you shall hear.</p>

  <p>"I am just old enough to remember the storm and sack of my native city by
  the Romans. I was but five years old, but even a child of five does not
  forget when he sees, as I saw, his father and his elder brother killed before
  his eyes. I should have been killed myself&mdash;for the soldiers, who had
  suffered terribly in the siege, spared no one&mdash;but for Marcellus
  himself. He let the slave who waited on me carry me off to his own hut. That
  worthy slave and his good wife kept me for five years out of their scanty
  wages&mdash;he was a workman in the stone-quarries, and she sold cakes to
  schoolboys in the streets&mdash;till I was ten years old. Then interest was
  made with the Senate at Rome, and part of the family property was given back
  to me. You will understand that I was very restless at Syracuse, but I could
  not move till I was twenty-five, for my father's will had fixed this age for
  my becoming my own master. It is a custom in our family, and I was too
  dutiful to think of breaking it. But the moment I became my own master I made
  haste to carry out a plan which I had been long thinking of. The famous
  soldier of the time was Philop&oelig;men, the Arcadian. It was a privilege to
  serve under him as a volunteer, and there were always ten times more
  applications than there were places to fill. However, by great good luck, and
  partly, I may say, through my having had the good fortune to win the
  foot-race at Olympia, I was chosen. I landed here&mdash;it is more than
  forty-five years ago&mdash;and made my way to his home in Arcadia. He had
  himself just come back from Sparta, which he had brought over to the cause of
  Greece. Sparta, as I dare say you know, has always cared much for herself,
  and very little for anything or anybody else. I shall never forget what
  happened a few days after my arrival. The Spartans, or, I should rather say,
  the reforming party among the Spartans&mdash;for there never was a Greek city
  yet but had two parties in it at the very least&mdash;felt greatly obliged to
  him for what he had done, and determined to make him a present. Well, they
  sent three of their chief citizens to offer it to him. They came, and
  Philop&oelig;men entertained them. Of course he knew nothing about the object
  of their coming, and they said nothing about it. They seemed ill at
  ease&mdash;that I could not help observing&mdash;though their host was all
  that was courteous and agreeable; but speak they couldn't. There was
  something about the man which positively forbade their mentioning such a
  matter. The next day they went away, leaving their offer unspoken. But as
  they could hardly go back to Sparta with this story, they put the matter into
  the hands of an old friend to carry out.</p>

  <p>"It seems an easy thing to get rid of a pocketful of gold, but this man
  didn't find it so. Everything about Philop&oelig;men was so simple, so
  frugal, he seemed so absolutely above things of the kind, that it was
  impossible to offer him money. The man went away without saying anything. He
  came a second time, and it was the same thing all over again. I don't say but
  what Philop&oelig;men had now some inkling of what was on hand. There was a
  twinkle in his eye, as if he was enjoying some joke greatly. As for me, I was
  completely mystified. Then the three Spartans came back again, and this time
  they forced themselves to speak, and, of course, did it in the clumsiest,
  most brutal fashion. It was a large sum, too, a hundred and twenty talents,
  if I remember right.</p>

  <p>"Philop&oelig;men smiled. 'My friends,' he said, 'you would have laid out
  this money very badly if I were to take it. Don't buy your friends; you have
  them already. Buy your enemies.'</p>

  <p>"And a good friend he showed himself. He wasn't in office then, and the
  President of the League, having a difference with the Spartans in some matter
  of no great importance, was all for using force.</p>

  <p>"'Pray,' said Philop&oelig;men to him, 'don't do anything of the kind. It
  is sheer madness to quarrel with a great Greek state, when the Romans are on
  the watch to take advantage of our divisions.'</p>

  <p>"And when he found that speaking was of no use, he mounted his horse and
  rode straight to Sparta&mdash;I was with him&mdash;to warn them of what was
  going to be done. Sure enough, in the course of ten days or so, the President
  comes with some five thousand men of his own and half a Roman legion; but
  Sparta was ready. They had to go back again without doing any harm. Some two
  months afterwards he was chosen President&mdash;for the eighth time it
  was&mdash;very much against his will, for he had passed his seventieth year,
  and was hoping to spend the rest of his days in peace. But it was not to be.
  There was a revolution in Messene, one of the endless changes which tempt one
  to think, against one's own conscience, that the steady, fixed rule of an
  able, honest tyrant is the best kind of government that a state can have. The
  Messenians, accordingly, renounced the League. This might have been endured;
  but it was another matter when they proceeded to seize a strong place outside
  their own borders. Philop&oelig;men was lying sick with fever at the time in
  Argos, but he left his bed immediately, and was on horseback in less than an
  hour. I was with him; indeed, I never left him of my own free will. Before
  nightfall we had reached his home in Arcadia, four hundred furlongs was the
  distance, and the roads about as rough and steep as you will find anywhere in
  Greece. The next day he sent round the city calling for volunteers. Some
  three hundred joined him&mdash;gentlemen, all of them, who furnished their
  own arms, and rode their own horses. We had a smart brush with the enemy, and
  got the better of them. But they were strongly reinforced, and as we were now
  heavily overmatched, Philop&oelig;men gave the signal to fall back. His one
  thought now was to save the volunteers.</p>

  <p>"'They are the heart's blood of the city,' he said to me, 'and they must
  not be wasted.'</p>

  <p>He placed himself with a few troopers, who formed his body-guard, in the
  rear, and protected their retreat. He was a famous swordsman, you must know,
  and old as he was, there were very few who cared to come to close quarters
  with him. But of course they had their darts, and he was soon wounded in
  several places, as, indeed, we all were. And then on some very rough ground
  his horse stumbled and threw him. He was an old man, you see, and he had had
  two days of hard riding, and the fever fit&mdash;which was of the ague kind,
  caught some years before when he was campaigning in Crete&mdash;was coming
  upon him.</p>

  <p>"'Save yourselves,' he said to us; 'your country will want you for many
  years yet, but I am an old man.'</p>

  <p>"However, he gave me leave to stay; the others he commanded on their
  obedience to go. When the enemy came up he had fainted. They thought he was
  dead, and began to strip him of his arms, but before they had finished he
  came to himself. My blood boils to this day when I think how they treated
  him. They bound his hands behind his back, and drove him before them on foot
  as he was, half-dead with fatigue and sickness.</p>

  <p>"That night we bivouacked in the open. Some of the troopers had a feeling
  of pity or shame. One lent him his cloak to keep the cold off, though he had
  to go without one himself; another shared his ration of bread, dried meat,
  and rough wine with him. On the evening of the next day we came to Messene
  town, and I must do the townsfolk the justice to say that the sight was not
  at all to their liking. I heard many of them cursing the
  man&mdash;Deinocrates was his name, and he was as ill- conditioned a
  scoundrel as there was in Greece&mdash;who had given the orders for it to be
  done. Still, no one had the courage to interfere, and Deinocrates determined
  to finish matters before he was hindered; for he knew perfectly well that the
  League would spare nothing to get back their president.</p>

  <p>He thrust him, therefore, into a dungeon that was called the Treasury, a
  dreadful hole without a window or door, but having the entrance to it blocked
  by a huge stone. Deinocrates then held a hurried council with some of his own
  party. They voted with one accord for death. What followed I heard from the
  executioner himself, who was one of Deinocrates' slaves. His story was
  this:</p>

  <p>"'My master said to me, 'Take this cup'&mdash;I guessed from the look and
  the smell that it was hemlock&mdash;'to the prisoner, and don't leave him
  till he drinks it.'I went in&mdash;it wanted but a little time to
  midnight&mdash;and found Philop&oelig;men awake. 'Ah!' he said, when he saw
  me, 'your master is a generous man, and sends me, I doubt not, a draught of
  one of his richest vintages. But before I drink it, answer me, if you can,
  one question. Have any prisoners been brought in?'I said that I had not heard
  of any. 'None of the young horsemen that were with me?'I said that I had not
  seen them. He smiled and said, 'You bring good tidings. Things have not gone
  altogether ill with me.' Then he took the cup and drank it up without another
  word. This done he lay down again. I watched by him, but though I heard him
  breathing heavily he never moved. Just before cock-crow I judged that he
  died, for it was then that breathing ceased, and when I put my hand on his
  heart I could feel nothing.'</p>

  <p>"That was the end of Philop&oelig;men, 'the last of the Greeks', as I
  heard an enemy, a Roman, call him. And what, my dear young friend, can Greece
  do without Greeks?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE CORINTHIAN ASSEMBLY</h2>

  <p class="first">CLEANOR was of far too sanguine a temperament to allow
  himself to be daunted by the gloomy reminiscences of his friend. "Things", he
  said to himself, "are altered since then. Rome is more manifestly formidable,
  for she has rid herself of more than one rival. The mere instinct of self-
  preservation must make those that are left unite."</p>

  <p>Still, he could not hide from himself various discouraging facts that
  forced themselves upon his notice. In the first place Corinth, or, rather,
  the Corinthian people, disappointed him. The place itself was intensely
  interesting; he did not know whether to admire more the splendid remains of
  the past that it had to show, or the evidences of a prosperous present with
  which it abounded.</p>

  <p>At one time he would make his way to the highest point of the citadel, the
  Acro-Corinthus, and look down upon the city, crowded as it was with temples,
  public halls, mansions, on which the wealth of centuries had been lavished.
  At another he would spend long hours in wandering about the docks, that one
  which brought to the "City of the Two Seas" the commerce of the West, or that
  other which was filled with the merchandise of the East.</p>

  <p>There were vessels of all sizes and of every kind of rig, manned with
  seamen of every nationality, and bringing the merchandise of every country,
  from the Atlantic shores on the west to remote regions of the east of which
  no European knew except by repute. Blocks of tin and strings of amber from
  far-off islands of the north, ivory and precious stones from the African
  coasts far to the south of the Pillars of Hercules, iron from Elba, cattle
  and fruit from the Balearic Isles, wines from Sicily and the shores of the
  Adriatic, were among the most common articles in the western harbour; to the
  eastern harbour came silks from China, metal work from India,&mdash;then as
  now famous for the skill of its handicraftsmen, dried fruits from Lesser
  Asia, salt and pickled fish from the Black Sea, wheat from Egypt, and wines,
  some of them the finest vintages in the world, from the islands of the Ægean.
  Corinth, then, was interesting enough, making the impression upon a stranger
  of being one of the busiest and wealthiest places in the world.</p>

  <p>But what of the Corinthians? A more mixed, I may say mongrel, multitude
  could not be seen anywhere. Cleanor's first impression was that the
  population contained specimens of every nation upon earth&mdash;except
  Greeks. There were swarms of Asiatics from the Lesser Asia and from Syria,
  yellow-skinned Egyptians, Arabs and Moors showing every variety of brown, and
  negroes with their glossy black. In effective contrast to these might be seen
  a few Gauls, blue-eyed and yellow-haired, whose imposing stature seemed to
  dwarf to pigmies the crowds through which they shouldered their way. Now and
  then a Roman, conspicuous in his white toga edged with a narrow purple
  stripe, moved along with slow, dignified step, which seemed to speak of a man
  born to rule. It was curious to note the expression of fear and hatred with
  which he was regarded. Again and again, as he watched this motley crowd
  thronging the streets with an endless variety of costume, colour, and dress,
  Cleanor felt disposed to say, "Here is Corinth, but where are the
  Corinthians?" And when he did see specimens of the genuine Corinthian, he had
  to own to himself that they did not greatly impress him. The city had its
  gilded youth, most of them belonging to the second or third generations of
  families enriched by trade, but some claiming to be Bacchiadae, or even
  descendants of the mythical Sisyphus who had founded the city some fourteen
  centuries before. A more debauched, spendthrift, and generally useless set he
  had never seen. They made no pretence to culture; they shuddered at the idea
  of a campaign; even the sports of the arena were too much for their
  effeminate frames. Cleanor felt his spirits sink and his hopes diminish day
  by day, for Corinth was now the capital of Greece. Archias, his host, watched
  him meanwhile with a compassionate interest. He had had something of the same
  enthusiasm himself in bygone days, and had known the inexpressible pain of
  having to own that it was a delusion.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," he said to his young guest some ten days after their
  arrival, "that there is to be an important meeting of the Assembly to-
  morrow?"</p>

  <p>"I heard Polemon say something about it to-day. He asked one of the young
  fellows who were playing at kottabos with him whether he thought of going,
  and seemed to surprise him very much by the question. Polemon, you see, has
  not been living in Corinth for much more than a year, and has not quite
  caught the high-toned Corinthian manner. He actually imagines it possible for
  a man to have some interest in public affairs. You should have heard the
  astonishment in his friend's voice when he answered him, 'Going to the
  Assembly, did you say? Why, my dear fellow, I have never been to the
  Assembly, and certainly never shall, till they make me Eparch or whatever
  they call it, when I shall have to, I suppose. And to-morrow of all days in
  the year! Why, don't you know that Pintocles of Megara is coming over with
  his champion team of quails, and that I am going to meet them with mine: We
  have a wager of a hundred gold pieces on the event. If one side kills all the
  birds on the other side, the loser is to pay double stakes. In any case the
  winner is to give a dinner to the loser and his friends. Going to the
  Assembly, indeed!' That is all that I have heard about it."</p>

  <p>"Then I had better enlighten you," replied Archias. "You know that the
  Assembly has been called to hear the envoys from Rome state the terms which
  the Senate is willing to agree to. You ought to be there. You will find it
  very interesting, whatever these young gentlemen with their teams of fighting
  quails may think about it."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I should like to go; but how am I to get in? At Athens they
  were very particular not to admit any one that was not a citizen."</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble yourself on that score. Here they are not particular at
  all. Simply follow the crowd. There will be no one to stop you."</p>

  <p>And so it turned out. There were door-keepers at the entrances to the vast
  amphitheatre in which the meeting of the Assembly was held, but they did not
  attempt to exclude anyone. Cleanor found himself, when he was seated, in the
  midst of a crowd almost as variegated and as polyglot as that at which he was
  accustomed to gaze in the streets. No one could suppose that any large
  proportion of them were genuine Corinthian citizens. The fourth hour was the
  time appointed for the commencement of business, and the multitude spent the
  interval much in the same way that a waiting crowd would do nowadays. They
  cheered or hissed any well-known citizen as he took his place, yelled out
  witticisms which seemed to please the more the coarser and more personal they
  were, sang songs with noisy choruses, and kept up generally an incessant
  uproar. Men carrying baskets of cakes and sweetmeats, or jars of wine, passed
  up and down the spaces between the blocks of seats, and did a brisk business
  in their respective wares.</p>

  <p>A brief hush fell upon the noisy crowd when, after the signal had been
  given by the blast of a trumpet, the doors leading into what may be called
  the magistrates' box were thrown open, and the officials, who were to conduct
  the business of the day filed in. There was nothing noteworthy about their
  reception, but when the figures of the two Roman envoys became visible, a
  storm of groans and hisses broke out ten times louder and fiercer than the
  noisiest manifestation that had greeted the most unpopular Corinthian. The
  two Romans bore themselves with characteristic indifference, took their seats
  in the places allotted to them, and watched the furious multitude with the
  utmost unconcern.</p>

  <p>After the howling and stamping had gone on for some quarter of an hour,
  the demonstration began to die away. One of the magistrates dropped a few
  grains of incense into a fire that was burning in front of him, and poured
  out a little wine, muttering at the same time an invocation to Zeus, the
  patron deity of Corinth. This was equivalent to our "opening the proceedings
  with prayer". This ceremony completed, a herald proclaimed that the Assembly
  was constituted, and the presiding magistrate stepped forward to open the
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>His speech was of the briefest. "Citizens of Corinth," he said, "you are
  called together to-day to hear the terms on which the Senate and People of
  Rome are willing to make a treaty of perpetual friendship with you. They have
  sent two distinguished citizens, both members of the Senate, who will set the
  matter before you, and whom you will receive with that courtesy which it is
  the custom of Corinth to show to the ambassadors of other nations."</p>

  <p>The Romans stepped to the front of the platform. They were met for a few
  moments with a renewal of the uproar which had greeted their first
  appearance. But the Assembly was genuinely anxious to hear what they had to
  say, and the disturbing element was hushed into silence.</p>

  <p>Rome had paid the Greek people the compliment of sending them envoys who
  could address them in their own language. Titus Manlius&mdash;this was the
  name of the senior envoy&mdash;was one of the most cultured men of the time,
  one of the Scipio circle, and feeling a genuine admiration for Greece, for
  the Greece, i.e., of the past, for he had no little contempt for the Greece
  of the present. On the present occasion, however, he had every wish to please
  and conciliate.</p>

  <p>When it was seen that he was going to address the Assembly without the aid
  of an interpreter, he was greeted with applause, which was renewed after he
  had uttered a few sentences with a fluency and purity of accent which much
  impressed his hearers, few of whom, indeed, could in these respects have
  rivaled him. When he went on, in a few well-turned phrases, to compliment his
  hearers on the dignity and antiquity of their city, and on the services which
  they had rendered to Greece in repelling the barbarians from without, and
  checking undue ambition from within, he was met with loud applause.</p>

  <p>But after compliments came business, after sweets bitter. The first
  statement was that the Senate and People of Rome desired that every Greek
  city should enjoy complete freedom, electing its own magistrates, and being
  governed by its own laws.</p>

  <p>This was received with some applause, though the Assembly was acute enough
  to be aware that a generality of this kind might not mean very much.</p>

  <p>The speaker went on: "Every city may form such alliances as may seem
  expedient, provided only that they be not to the injury of the public peace.
  No city shall be compelled to enter into or to give up any alliance against
  its will."</p>

  <p>At this there were loud expressions of disapproval. It was a cardinal
  point with the League, of which Corinth was the ruling member, that every
  city in Greece must join it. At this very time Sparta was insisting on her
  right to stand alone, and the other states, headed by Corinth, were insisting
  that she must join them. And now Rome had pronounced in favour of Sparta.</p>

  <p>The third item in the programme pleased the audience still less, for it
  touched their pride at a very tender point. "A Roman garrison will occupy the
  citadel until affairs shall have been finally arranged. The occupation is for
  a time only, and will cease as soon as this may be done without injury to the
  public good."</p>

  <p>But when the last condition was announced it was met with a perfect storm
  of rage. "Anxious to promote the general welfare of Greece, the Senate and
  People of Rome decree that the island of Delos shall be a free port."</p>

  <p>This was a thing that everybody could understand. Freedom, after all, was
  not much more than a sentiment, and affiances were a matter for rulers to
  settle. Even a garrison in the citadel might be endured, for it meant the
  spending of a good deal of money. But Delos a free port! That was beyond all
  bearing. There was not a man in the whole of the Assembly but would be
  distinctly the poorer for it.</p>

  <p>The Roman had scarcely sat down when Critolaüs, the president of the
  League, sprang to his feet, and poured out a furious oration, in which he
  denounced the hypocrisy, the arrogance, and the greed of Rome. As he spoke,
  the temper of his audience rose higher and higher. The whole multitude sprang
  to their feet, howling, and shaking their fists at the Romans as they sat
  calm and indifferent in their place. Still the crisis, dangerous as it
  looked, might have passed off but for the mischievous act of some half-witted
  fellow who had found his way into the Assembly.</p>

  <p>"As for these men who have come hither to insult us," cried the orator in
  the peroration of his speech, "let them carry back to their employers at home
  the message of our unanimous contempt and defiance." "And this too," shouted
  the man, "as a little token of our affection," throwing at the same time a
  rotten fig. It struck one of the envoys on the shoulder, making a disfiguring
  stain on the white toga. "Good! good!" shouted the crowd, and followed it up
  with a shower of similar missiles. Some stones followed, and then came a
  leaden bullet propelled from a sling, which struck the wall behind the chairs
  of the Romans, and only a few inches above their heads.</p>

  <p>The magistrates awoke to the gravity of the situation. They were
  responsible for good order, were unwilling, in any case, to be themselves
  compromised, and had an uneasy feeling that the excitement of such
  proceedings would have to be dearly paid for. They caught the two Romans by
  the arms, and literally forced them out of the building by the door which
  served as a private entrance for official persons. The usual escort was in
  waiting outside. Under this protection the envoys were able to reach the
  citadel in safety. They had received a few blows, but had not sustained any
  serious injury.</p>

  <p>"What think you of this?" asked the Syracusan of his young friend as they
  walked back to their lodging.</p>

  <p>"A grievous business indeed, and of the very worst augury for the future,"
  replied Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Archias. "Who can help thinking of Tarentum, and how the robe
  of Postumius was soiled and washed white again."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09"></a>IX. &mdash; AT THERMOPYLAE</h2>

  <p class="first">SO far Cleanor's experiences had been distinctly
  disappointing. But he still clung to his hopes, trying to comfort himself
  with the thought that Greece meant much more than the little tract of country
  which bore the name. It was to be found in Egypt, in Syria, in the finest
  regions of Lesser Asia; and the country from which the most powerful Greek
  influence had come forth was not Athens or Sparta, or any one of the ancient
  states, but half-barbarous Macedonia. The next thing was to see what promise
  Macedonia held forth.</p>

  <p>The season was now growing late for travel by sea, and Cleanor gladly
  joined a party which was about to make its way overland to Pella, the old
  capital of Macedonia. The route lay through a number of famous places. His
  study of history had long since made him familiar with their names and
  associations. They were now seen for the first time with the most vivid
  interest, an interest which reached its climax in the famous Pass of
  Thermopylae. The place, which has now been altered by the action of nature
  and time almost beyond recognition, was then but little changed. The wall
  behind which the Greek army took up its position, though almost in ruins, was
  still to be seen; the mound upon which the immortal Three Hundred made their
  last stand could easily be recognized. So could the tomb of the heroes, with
  the epitaph, so appropriate in its simplicity and modesty, which Simonides
  the poet had written for it. Close by was the separate sepulchre of the
  valiant king Leonidas, with an epitaph of its own not less happy. Cleanor saw
  with regret that there was not enough of local patriotism to keep these
  memorials of a splendid past in decent repair. The letters of the
  inscriptions were so grown over with moss that it was very difficult to
  decipher them. Some of the stones of the tomb of the Three Hundred were out
  of place; and it would not be long, unless some repairs were done to it,
  before the whole must fall into ruin. The lion, too, had a weather-beaten,
  almost dilapidated look. Some mischievous hand, possibly that of a collector
  of relics,&mdash;a class which was as unscrupulous in its greed for specimens
  then as now, had chipped off a portion from one of the ears. The pedestal was
  covered with rudely carved initials, for this foolish practice was as great a
  favourite with idle hands in the ancient world as it is now.</p>

  <p>The young man was meditating sadly on the want of public spirit that
  suffered so scandalous a neglect of national glories, when he received
  another rude shock to his feelings. Something had been said in the course of
  the morning's march&mdash;it was about noon when they halted in the
  Pass&mdash;about the tribesmen near Thermopylae not having the best of
  characters, but it had been in a half-jesting way, and Cleanor had paid
  little attention to the remark. Nor had he noticed that the party, which,
  indeed, had soon exhausted its slender interest in the place, had gone some
  distance further to make their halt for the noonday meal in the open country
  beyond the Gates. He was roused from a fit of musing by feeling a hand laid
  roughly on his shoulder. In a moment the chance words of the morning came
  back to him. He swung himself violently aside, and so released himself from
  the grasp of the intruder. Instantly facing about he dealt the man a heavy
  blow straight from the shoulder, which tumbled him to the ground. But he was
  unarmed, except for a short dagger which he carried in his belt, and which
  was meant to serve for a feast rather than for a fray. And he was
  overmatched. For the moment, indeed, he was free; his assailant had been
  alone. But looking up and down the Pass he saw small parties of armed men
  advancing in both directions. Flight, too, was impossible, for the rocks rose
  sheer on either side of him. There was nothing to be done but to submit to
  his fate, which manifestly was to be captured by bandits. Throwing his dagger
  to the ground, he held up his hands in token of surrender.</p>

  <p>A man somewhat better clad and better armed than his companions&mdash;they
  were a ragged, ill-eqipped set&mdash;advanced from one of the approaching
  parties and accosted our hero. Nothing could be more polite than his manner
  of address.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse us, sir," he said, "for detaining you for a short time.
  Nothing but the exigencies of business could have induced us to put you to
  any inconvenience."</p>

  <p>The fellow whom Cleanor had knocked down had regained his feet, and was
  coming up with a threatening air.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, Laches," said the leader. "My friend did nothing but what was
  quite right and natural. You took a great liberty. To put your hand upon a
  gentleman's shoulder indeed! And your blow, sir, was well delivered," he went
  on, turning to Cleanor. "It was not the first time, I fancy, that you have
  used your fists. A very pretty stroke indeed! I am quite delighted to offer
  such poor hospitality as I have at command to so accomplished a guest. I have
  your promise, I suppose, not to attempt to leave us till we have improved our
  acquaintance somewhat. I have been obliged now and then to handcuff a friend
  who was so modest as to wish to withdraw. But you, sir, I know, will accept
  my friendship as frankly as it is offered."</p>

  <p>Cleanor was not sure whether this elaborate civility was an improvement on
  the more brutal manners of the average bandit, but thought it best to accept
  the situation with as much show of good-humour as he could manage. "I shall
  be delighted," he said, "to improve my acquaintance with this most
  interesting country of yours. But I have important business on hand at Pella,
  and to business even the most attractive pleasures must be postponed."</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted to fall in with your views," replied the brigand
  chief, with an elaborate bow, "though I cannot but regret that anything
  should shorten your visit."</p>

  <p>After proceeding down the Pass for some two hundred yards, the party
  turned into a path on the right-hand side, and began to climb a somewhat
  steep ascent.</p>

  <p>"This is the very path, sir," said the chief, "by which Ephialtes brought
  the Persians to take King Leonidas and his army in the rear. That villainous
  traitor was, I regret to say, a native of Malia, the only dishonest man that
  the place has ever produced. I myself have the honour of having been born
  there."</p>

  <p>An hour's smart walking brought the party to a small grassy plateau. Here
  they left the path, and, making their way through a clump of ilex, reached
  the entrance to a cavern in the mountain side. The entrance was narrow, and
  so low that a man of even moderate stature had to stoop before he could pass
  under it; but the cavern was spacious and lofty.</p>

  <p>"My men's quarters," said the chief, with a wave of the hand; "rather
  dark, as you see, but dry, and fairly warm. My own apartment is a little
  further this way."</p>

  <p>Another doorway, not unlike that by which they had entered, led from the
  larger into a smaller cavern. This, as Cleanor observed, could be shut off by
  a thick door solidly backed with iron.</p>

  <p>"I like to be by myself now and then," explained the chief "Our friends,
  too, are sometimes a little boisterous in their mirth, and the noise
  interferes with my studies."</p>

  <p>The arrangement, it occurred to Cleanor, served for protection as well as
  retirement. The smaller cave had also, he concluded from a ray of light which
  made its way through the wall, a separate exit.</p>

  <p>It had been furnished with some attempt at comfort. There was a couch in
  one of the corners; in the middle, round a hearth on which a few sticks were
  smouldering, coverlets and skins were piled. A couple of hunting-spears, a
  bow, and a quiver hung on the walls, and a curtain could be drawn over the
  door that led into the outer cave.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to my home!" said the chief; "a poor place; but better men have
  been worse lodged. If you have any money, you had better let me take care of
  it. My men are not bad fellows on the whole, but you must not trust them too
  far. They are common Phocians, you must know, not men of Malia." Cleanor had
  again to make a virtue of necessity. He had taken the precaution of sending a
  remittance on to Pella, to await his arrival at that place, and carried about
  with him little more than what would be wanted on the journey.
  This&mdash;some twenty gold pieces&mdash;he had in a purse-girdle round his
  waist, which he now produced and handed to the chief. The man examined it,
  not without first making an apology, and counted the coins. Cleanor fancied
  that his face fell somewhat at finding that they were so few. His manner,
  however, continued to be as gay and friendly as before, and the talk, which
  he poured forth in an unceasing stream, as intelligent as it was amusing.</p>

  <p>"The sun must be nearly setting," he said, looking upwards at the aperture
  in the roof&mdash;long practice had enabled him to guess the time of day very
  accurately by the variation in the light&mdash;"and you must be ready by this
  time for dinner. 'Tis but a humble repast I can offer you, but you can
  understand that we have to rough it up here. My neighbours, however, are very
  kind, and we always have enough, though the quality now and then leaves
  something to be desired."</p>

  <p>Opening the door that communicated between the two caves, he called to
  Laches&mdash;the same, it will be remembered, with whom Cleanor had had a
  collision earlier in the day.</p>

  <p>"Tell Persis," he said, "to let us have something to eat as soon as
  possible. You will join us, Laches," he added, "when it is ready, if by
  chance you have any appetite left.</p>

  <p>"I thought it as well," he explained, "to do away with any little soreness
  there may be in the man's mind. He will be ready to swear eternal friendship
  over a flask of wine."</p>

  <p>Before long, a wrinkled old woman, who looked quite the ideal cook of a
  robber's cave, brought in a smoking dish of roast kid, garnished with onions.
  Flat cakes of what we should call "damper" served as bread, for the latter,
  as the chief explained, could seldom be made for want of yeast. A jug of red
  wine of the country was drawn from a cask which stood in a corner of the
  cave, to be succeeded at the proper time by a flask of stately dimensions,
  which contained a rich vintage from Lesbos.</p>

  <p>"This," said the chief, "my good friend Clarilaus, eparch of Larissa, was
  kind enough to supply me with."</p>

  <p>Cleanor opened his eyes. Farmers and shepherds might find it worth while
  to buy the brigand's forbearance by a toll from their flocks, but was such a
  dignitary as an eparch content to pay blackmail? The chief smiled.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I might explain," he said, "that we came across the eparch's
  wagon as it was on its way to Larissa from the coast. As there was clearly
  more wine than he could use&mdash;it is the one fault of Lesbian wine that it
  does not keep very well&mdash;I took it for granted that some must have been
  meant for me. He is famous for his taste in wine, and I think you will own
  that this does him credit."</p>

  <p>It was soon evident that the Lesbian wine had strength as well as flavour,
  for the two brigands became very communicative as the flask grew lighter.</p>

  <p>"Tell us your story, Laches," said the chief. "It always puts me in better
  conceit with myself to hear it. This life of ours here is not exactly the
  ideal. My old master at the Academy, Philippus, would scarcely have approved
  of it. Yes, my young friend, I too have been in Arcadia, or rather, I should
  say, in Athens, though I may not look like it; but I always console myself by
  thinking that there are worse thieves than I am. Go on Laches."</p>

  <p>The man's tale ran thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I was a shepherd by occupation. My father was a shepherd; so had his
  father before him been, and his father too, for many generations. Yes, for
  many hundred years, but not always. There was a tradition in the family that
  we had been princes once, owning all the land over which the flocks we cared
  for grazed, and a great deal more. We believed that we were descended from
  the great Thessalus himself. Well, we were fairly content. Our master was a
  gay young fellow, a little thoughtless, and too ready with his hands if
  things did not go quite as he wished, but kind and generous. Poor fellow! he
  was killed by a wild-boar. To tell the truth, he had taken a cup too much. It
  was his habit, and a bad habit too&mdash;a very bad habit."</p>

  <p>Laches was quite sincere, though his own utterance had grown a little
  thick.</p>

  <p>"We had found a boar in the morning, and lost him. After the mid-day
  meal&mdash;he would finish the flask of heady Chian&mdash;we found the brute
  again. My master threw one of his two hunting-spears, and wounded him in the
  shoulder. He was a little flurried, and he threw it too soon, and with a bad
  aim. The boar charged, and my master knelt on one knee to receive it.
  Flurried again, and the spear not quite straight. I was running as hard as I
  could, but it was too late. When I came up, he was lying on the ground, with
  as bad a wound in the thigh as ever I saw. He was dead before you could count
  twenty.</p>

  <p>"Then our troubles began. The master was not married, and all the property
  went to an uncle, the meanest old skinflint in Thessaly. He had been a
  spendthrift, they said, in his young days; such men always make the worst
  kind of misers, I have heard. Anyhow, he was as bad as he could be. He hadn't
  been in possession for a week when he began to cut us short in everything. We
  used to be allowed half a drachma for every lamb that we reared. This was
  taken away. Not only that, but we had to make good all that died. 'Your
  fault,' he would say; 'your fault; a quite healthy lamb.' All the lambs,
  according to him, were quite healthy. It was the same if one was killed by a
  wolf, and there are a terrible lot of wolves in that part of the country.
  What used to be our best time, the lambing season, came to be the worst.
  There was very little of our wages left by the time that we had made good all
  the losses. Then he charged us for every stick of wood that we picked up. We
  were not allowed to catch a fish or snare a bird. We had to buy our flour at
  his mill; damp, chalky stuff it was, more like bird-lime than flour. Sour
  wine, rotten cloth, stinking salt- fish&mdash;we had to buy them all of him.
  At every turn the villain made a profit out of us. As for our wages, it was
  the rarest thing for us to see an obol of them. Most months he made out the
  balance to be on the wrong side."</p>

  <p>"Well, to out the story short, we got pretty deeply into his debt, my poor
  father and I. What does the scoundrel do but take my sister&mdash;as good and
  as pretty a girl as there was in the whole country to be sold as a slave, in
  payment of the debt, he said. He took care to do this villainy when
  we&mdash;I mean the girl's husband that was to be and I&mdash;were with the
  sheep on the summer pastures in the hills. A nice home-coming we had; my old
  father dead&mdash;he had a stroke the day when his daughter was carried away,
  dying in an hour,&mdash;and my sister gone. She wrenched herself out of the
  hands of the slave-dealer as they were crossing the Peneus, threw herself
  into the river, and was drowned&mdash;the best thing that could happen to
  her, poor girl!</p>

  <p>"You can guess the end, I dare say. The villain, my master, was found dead
  in his bed&mdash;his throat out from ear to ear&mdash;three days afterwards.
  They caught Agathon&mdash;that was the lover, you understand&mdash;and
  crucified him. And I am here."</p>

  <p>"But," cried Cleanor, "are there no laws?"</p>

  <p>"Laws!" answered the chief; "laws in plenty. But the question is&mdash;who
  administers them?"</p>

  <p>"The Romans, I suppose," replied Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"I only wish they did," was the unexpected answer. "We might get some sort
  of justice then. No; they leave the matter in the hands of the rich, and
  there is only one in a hundred who has a spark of conscience or pity in him.
  Mark this, young sir. I have twelve men in my band, and there is not one of
  them but has a story to tell as bad as what Laches here has told us. And in
  every one of them the oppressor has been one of our own people. And now,
  doubtless, you will be ready for sleep."</p>

  <p>Sleep was long in coming that night to the young man, and his thoughts
  were full of gloom. He could not but feel some fears for himself. His
  captors, it is true, were civil and even friendly; but he knew that such
  people conducted their affairs on strict business principles, and that one
  invariable principle was to get rid of a prisoner whose ransom was not
  forthcoming in good time. He had funds, indeed, in the hands of a merchant at
  Pella, but how was he to identify himself? And his experiences hitherto had
  been very dispiriting. Whatever he might find elsewhere, so far he had not
  met with the vigorous, united, patriotic Greece of which he had dreamed.</p>

  <p>It was late before he fell asleep, and then his slumber was light and
  troubled. Just as the day was showing he was roused by the chief.</p>

  <p>"Get up," said the man, "there is no time to be lost, if you don't want to
  be choked like a rat in a hole."</p>

  <p>Cleanor started to his feet. Thin coils of smoke were finding their way
  through the crevices of the doorway between the two caves and through various
  fissures in the wall. Dazed by the suddenness of his rousing he looked to the
  chief for an explanation.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand? They have tracked us, and now they are smoking us
  out. I am not going to leave my men. They're a rough lot, but they have stuck
  faithfully to me, and I will stick to them. But that is nothing to you. You
  have got time to escape; don't waste it. You will find some steps cut in the
  far side of the cave. Follow them; they will take you to a hole near the roof
  just big enough for you to creep through. That is the entrance to a narrow
  passage which leads to the top of the hill. No one knows it but myself; it
  was well to have my own way of getting out. But I am not going to use it now.
  Take care how you go; the passage is pitch dark, and has some dangerous
  places in it. And here is your purse. I am sorry to have hindered you in your
  journey. We took you for something quite different from what you are. Still
  you have learnt something. If you can, think kindly of us. Even a set of
  rascally robbers may have something to say for themselves."</p>

  <p>There was no time to be lost in talking. Cleanor scrambled with little
  difficulty to the entrance of the passage. But the passage itself was an
  awful experience. As the chief had said, it was pitch dark, and the Greek had
  to feel his way as he crept along on hands and knees. Twice he found the path
  come to what seemed an abrupt end in what he supposed to be a chasm, for he
  heard far below him the sound of falling water. But exploring the wall on the
  left hand he found a ledge just broad enough to allow him to creep along. At
  last, after what seemed hours of anxious toil&mdash;he found afterwards that
  the time was much less than it seemed&mdash;he saw a faint speck of light in
  the distance. Before long he reached the open air on the hillside, at the
  height of some four hundred feet above the plain.</p>

  <p>It was not long before Cleanor fell in with a peasant. The man was aware
  of what had happened. He had seen the Thessalian troops on their march, and
  seeing the smoke rising from the hillside had guessed the tactics which they
  had employed. It was plain from the man's talk that the robbers were not
  unpopular in the district. As a rule they had paid, and paid liberally, for
  supplies. In short, they had been regarded, as such people often have been
  before and since, as friends of the poor. The man took Cleanor by a short cut
  into the highroad, and so enabled him to overtake his party, which reached
  Pella without further adventure. The banditti, as he heard during his stay in
  Macedonia, had fallen to a man in a desperate sally which they had made
  against the attacking party.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10"></a>X. &mdash; A PINCHBACK ALEXANDER</h2>

  <p class="first">ON arriving at the Macedonian capital, Cleanor made it his
  first business to call on the merchant to whom his remittance had been made.
  He had expected from the name, Hosius, to find in him a countryman of his
  own, and was not a little surprised to discover that he was a Jew. The old
  man, who bore his fourscore years very lightly, and was as shrewd and keen in
  business as he had ever been in his prime, was very cordial and hospitable.
  His house presented a very mean exterior to the observer&mdash;the Jews had
  already begun to adopt this almost universal method of concealing their
  wealth&mdash;but it was really a large and splendid mansion. Of this,
  however, Cleanor caught during his stay only rare and casual glimpses. His
  own quarters were in an annex intended for the use of guests not of the
  Hebrew race. This was entirely distinct from the main building, and the
  service was performed by a separate establishment of slaves.</p>

  <p>Hosius&mdash;this was the form into which the merchant's real name,
  Hoshea, had been changed&mdash;had much that was interesting to say to his
  guest. He was very frank about his own ways of thinking.</p>

  <p>"I am not very strict," he said; "I am content to be as one of those among
  whom I live. I call myself Hosius. It is a name that is easier for their
  mouths to pronounce than my own. And Greek fashions and ways suit me well
  enough. But the younger generation is not content. My son David is all for
  strictness, and I am obliged to humour him for peace' sake at home. You see
  he was one of the 'Righteous,' as they called themselves. He served under
  Judas the Hammer for three years and more; was with him when he fell at
  Elaim, and was left for dead on the field. It was he who made me build the
  guest-chamber where you are now. Before that I used to entertain my visitors
  in my own house. But he does not allow it; he would sooner starve than eat a
  meal with a Gentile, as he calls all who are not of the People. I don't hold
  with all this myself. But he is a good young man, a great deal better than
  his worldly old father, and I don't like crossing him.</p>

  <p>It so happened that David was absent from home at the time, having gone to
  Jerusalem to be present at the Feast of Dedication, and to look after some
  family affairs for his father; his zeal did not in the least hinder him from
  being an excellent man of business. Old Hosius took advantage of his absence
  to see more of his guest than it would have been possible otherwise. The
  young man's frankness and intelligence greatly attracted him; and he, on the
  other hand, had much to say about matters in which Cleanor was profoundly
  interested. The conversation often turned on the deeds of those Jewish heroes
  the Maccabees. The old merchant, for all his show of cynicism and
  worldliness, was really proud of his countrymen. And he had wonderful stories
  to tell of endurance and courage, of tenderly nurtured women bearing
  unheard-of agonies, mothers who saw all of their children tortured to death
  before their eyes sooner than break the law, and men who went calmly to
  certain death if they could work thereby any deliverance for their
  country.</p>

  <p>These stories he would always introduce with something like an apology. He
  had heard them from his son. He was too old to be enthusiastic about
  anything, but still his young friend might like to hear them. Then, as he
  told them, his eyes would kindle, and his voice thrill almost in spite of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Listen to this;" this was one of his narratives; "we are forbidden to eat
  the flesh of swine. I daresay it seems very ridiculous to you, though, by the
  way, your own Pythagoras would not let his disciples eat beans. Still a law
  is a law, and, whether it be wise or foolish, the man or woman who will die
  sooner than break it is a noble soul. King Antiochus swore that he would not
  be mocked by a set of slaves&mdash;so the hound dared to speak of our people.
  What was good enough for him was good enough for them. If he chose to give
  them good food, they should eat it, law or no law.</p>

  <p>"He had a Jewish mother and her seven sons brought up before him, and
  tried to bend them to his will. The eldest of the seven stood up and spoke
  for his brothers. 'What you ask, O king, is against our law, and we will die
  rather than do it.' Antiochus cried in his rage, 'Does he speak thus to his
  master? Cut out the fellow's tongue.' Why should I tell you all the horrid
  story. They mangled him and burnt him cruelly till he died. They brought the
  second. 'Wilt thou eat?' shouted the king. 'I will not,' said he. And they
  dealt with him as they had dealt with the first. So they did with them one
  after the other. And all the while those that were left, and the woman
  herself, exhorted each one to bear himself bravely, and to die sooner than
  yield. So it went on till there was but one left, the youngest of the seven.
  'Hear, young man,' said the king to him. 'These six have died in their folly.
  Do you be wise. Eat of this food, which is surely one of the good things that
  the gods have given us, and I will promote you to honour.' And when the lad,
  for he was of but tender years, refused, the king turned to the mother
  seeking to persuade her that she might in turn persuade her son. After a
  while she pretended to be convinced. 'I will persuade him, O king,' she said.
  But her persuasion was this: 'Have pity on me, my son; remember that I bare
  thee and nourished thee: endure therefore whatsoever this butcher may do, so
  that I may receive in the world to come all the seven of you, and lose not
  one.' So he too endured and died. And after the seven had been slain before
  her eyes, the mother also was slain. Tell me," cried the old man, "did any
  Spartan mother of them all equal this?</p>

  <p>"Then, again, hear the tale of Eleazar, who was surnamed the Beast-
  slayer, what he did when Judas the Hammer fought the army of King Antiochus
  at the House of Zachariab. The king had brought a score of elephants with
  him. You know the beast if you come from Africa, and that he is not so
  terrible as he looks, and is scarcely more apt to hurt his foes than his
  friends. But let me tell you that he who sees him for the first time without
  trembling is braver than most men. So it happened that our soldiers were not
  a little terrified at the sight. Then this Eleazar, who was brother to Judas,
  seeing that one of the beasts was bigger than the rest, and more splendidly
  equipped, as if he carried the king himself, ran furiously into the company
  in which it was&mdash;for each beast had a company of soldiers round
  it&mdash;slaying right and left as he ran till he came to the beast. The
  creature's breast and shoulders were protected with plates of brass, but his
  belly, as being out of reach, was left unguarded, and here it was that
  Eleazar dealt him a great blow with his sword, and continued to strike him
  till the beast fell dead and crushed this brave Jew in his fall."</p>

  <p>As for the young Greek, he was astonished to find that this fanatical and
  superstitious people&mdash;for so he had always been accustomed to think of
  the Jews&mdash;could boast of warriors and statesmen quite equal to any that
  his own nation had produced. Leonidas himself and his Three Hundred had not
  shown a more desperate courage at Thermopylae than Judas Maccabaeus and his
  scanty band of followers had displayed at Elaim; Themistocles had not
  exhibited a more subtle and skilful statecraft than Jonathan. And while his
  admiration was extorted for the Jew, he was equally constrained to despise
  the Greek. Antiochus the Splendid, as he called himself, the Crazy as every
  one outside the circle of court sycophants and flatterers called him, made
  but a very poor figure by the side of Judas the Hammer.</p>

  <p>Another highly disturbing fact for the young man was this. Where did these
  patriots find allies? Not in any Greek kingdom&mdash;these were all banded
  together against them,&mdash;but in Rome. It was to Rome that Judas had
  turned in his extremity, and in Rome that he found help. The old man's son
  had acted as secretary to the embassy which Judas had sent on this occasion,
  and had given his impressions of what he saw and heard in a letter to his
  father, which the old man now showed to his guest. It ran thus:</p>

  <p><i>I am not persuaded that our chief has done well in seeking alliance
  with this heathen people, for has not the Lord our God commanded us to have
  no dealings with idolaters? How can we keep ourselves separate from them if
  they become our friends, and fight by our side in the battle? But this I will
  confess, that if it be lawful to have any nation from among the heathen for
  our friends, that nation is Rome. I had heard much of the things that these
  Romans have done, and how that there is not a nation in the world that has
  been able to stand up against them. The greatness of their achievements
  seemed to be beyond all belief; but after what I have seen in Rome, there is
  nothing in them any longer incredible. They make kings and unmake them, but
  none of them puts a crown upon his own head, or clothes himself with purple.
  There is no royal palace in their city, but a Senate-house, in which three
  hundred and twenty men, every one of them fit to be a king, sit day by day
  taking counsel for the welfare of the people. Every year they choose two men
  to whom they commit the ordering of the state and the command of their
  armies. All obey these two without question, and there neither envy nor
  emulation among them.</i></p>

  <p>But when Cleanor came to speak of the special purpose of his mission he
  found the old man very reserved. "You want to see the Prince Andriscus, for
  that is the name by which some of us knew him, or Perseus, as we are to call
  him now, I understand. Well, I can give you an introduction to the court, but
  that is all that I can do. And I would advise you not to build your hopes too
  much upon what you may see or hear now."</p>

  <p>The introduction was given, but it seemed impossible to get any further.
  The king, as he called himself, was always too busy to give an audience. But
  for all his being so busy, Cleanor never could make out that anything was
  being done. There was no drilling of troops; there was no gathering of
  stores. But there was a great deal of feasting; and there were some fine
  performances at the theatres, not plays, for which the Macedonians did not
  care, but spectacles, on which, so gorgeous were they, a vast amount of money
  must have been spent. The king found time to see them, and though he was
  carried in a closed chariot, a method of conveyance which Cleanor had always
  been taught to consider effeminate, no one could deny that his escort were
  magnificent men, and wore very splendid armour.</p>

  <p>At last the Greek got his long-promised interview. The first sight of the
  prince or pretender, whatever we may call him, distinctly impressed him. He
  had the advantage of one of those extraordinary personal resemblances that
  have often stood pretenders in good stead. His face and figure recalled the
  image, made so familiar by statues, pictures, and coins, of the great
  Alexander, just as Alexander himself had seemed an impersonation of Achilles,
  so closely had he resembled the traditional representations of the famous
  hero. A second and longer view of the face did much to dispel the illusion.
  The chin was receding and weak; the full, sensual lips were parted in the way
  that commonly denotes a want of resolution; the eyes were dull and shifty;
  habitual intemperance had already suffused the skin with a colour which a few
  more years would make disfiguring. When he spoke, his voice&mdash;and there
  is no greater tell- tale than the voice&mdash;was rough and uncultured.</p>

  <p>Cleanor presented to the prince the letter of commendation with which
  Hasdrubal had furnished him. He glanced at it for a few moments, and then
  tossed it to a secretary. The Greek had afterwards reason to believe that the
  Prince could not read, and that his sole literary accomplishment was a
  laboriously-executed signature. He asked a few commonplace questions about
  the progress of the siege of Carthage, and the prospects of the future, but
  did not seem to listen to the answers. Then, seeming to weary of serious
  subjects, he turned to the more congenial topics of amusement and sport. Some
  chance brought up Cleanor's experiences in tunny-fishing, and the Prince was
  really roused.</p>

  <p>"I shall go," he said in a more determined manner than he had yet shown,
  "and have a try for them myself. See," he went on, turning to one of the
  chief officials of the court, "that you have everything ready for an
  expedition on the day after to-morrow." The man bowed; he was accustomed to
  see these whims appear and disappear. "You shall come with me," he said to
  Cleanor. "Dine with me to-day, and we will talk it over."</p>

    <p class="caption">The Macedonian pretender performs the Pyrrhic dance.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>But by dinner-time the whim was forgotten. The martial mood now had its
  turn, a frequent incident in the Pretender's convivial hours. A rhapsodist,
  made up with no little skill to resemble the blind minstrel of the Odyssey,
  recited from the Iliad the valiant deeds of Achilles; and, later on in the
  evening, the Pretender himself performed, as well as somewhat unsteady legs
  permitted him, the Pyrrhic dance. Cleanor left the hall in disgust, under
  cover of the thunders of applause with which this display was greeted. It
  enraged him to think how much time and troubled he had wasted on this
  miserable mountebank. It was not from such as he that any help would be
  gained to check the growing power of Rome. His disappointment was made all
  the keener by the tidings which awaited him on his return to his lodgings.
  His host put into his hands a missive which had just been brought for him. It
  was a despatch from Hasdrubal, and ran thus:</p>

  <p><i>Hasdrubal to Cleanor, greeting. I have heard this day from friends in
  Rome that it is already settled among the chief men of the tribes that Scipio
  is to be chosen Consul for the year to come. Some will object, but more for
  form's sake than in earnest, that he is below the proper age for the consul's
  office. But the people are wearied of incompetent men, and are determined to
  choose him who has, they say, the fate of Carthage for his inheritance. May
  Hercules avert the omen! Yet be sure both that this will be done, and that
  being done it will mean much. Return therefore with all possible speed. If
  you have found any friends for our country urge them to do what they can
  without delay. Never did we need help more, or are more ready to reward it.
  But, in any case, come back yourself. There is great work to be done, and
  great honour to be gained; nor is there anything which, if the gods favour
  our country, you may not hope for, or rather, demand. Farewell!</i></p>

  <p>Cleanor had done nothing, though he might fairly say that he had found
  nothing to do; and it was a relief to him to find that his course of action
  at last lay plainly before him. The two sides in the great struggle were
  closing in; he knew where his own place was, and that he could not take it
  too soon. But it was no easy matter to discover how he was to get there.
  Hasdrubal's despatch had taken nearly two months to reach him, for it had
  been sent off very soon after his own departure from Africa. It was now close
  upon the end of the year, and with the New Year would come the election of
  consuls at Rome. Scipio, once put into power, would not, he was sure, let the
  grass grow under his feet; he himself, too, must lose no time if he was to
  serve Carthage to any purpose. Fortunately, he had ample funds at his
  disposal. By the help of Hosius he found a fast-sailing pinnace, whose owner
  was willing for the handsome consideration of ten minae to risk the perils of
  a winter voyage. A brisk north-easter carried them to Corinth in three days.
  It was easy to get from Corinth to Patrae, for traffic went on, winter and
  summer alike, in the land-locked Corinthian Gulf. There he was upon the
  regular route between the East and Italy, a route by which so much
  indispensable business was done that it was never quite closed. At Patrae he
  found a Roman official, just appointed to the commissariat of the army at
  Carthage, who was on his way to Rome. He was expecting the arrival of a ship
  which was to touch for him, on its way from Ambracia to Brundisium.</p>

  <p>On its arrival, which took place next day, Cleanor went on board with his
  new acquaintance, and arranged to travel with him to Italy. He assumed the
  character of a student at Athens, leaving that city for a time on account of
  the troubles that seemed imminent in Greece. He knew enough of the place from
  his former residence to play the part with success, and he had ascertained
  that there was no genuine student on board.</p>

  <p>At Brundisium the party was met with the news that the prediction of
  Hasdrubal's Roman correspondent had been fulfilled&mdash;Scipio had been
  elected consul for the year, with Africa for his province. Their informant
  described the scene as one of indescribable enthusiasm. The tribes had simply
  refused to hear any other name. Candidates of credit and even of high
  reputation had been proposed, but it had been only in dumb-show, the voices
  of their proposers being drowned in the continuous roar of "Scipio!
  Scipio!"</p>

  <p>A hasty meeting of the Senate had been called, and a resolution passed
  suspending the law which fixed the qualifying age at forty-two. So engrossed
  was the people with the election of their favourite that it was not easy to
  induce them to give him a colleague. The assembly dismissed, Rome had given
  itself up to a frenzy of rejoicing, which could not have been greater if
  Carthage had already fallen. It was an absolute faith with every one that he
  was "born for the destruction of Carthage", and such a faith has a way of
  working out its own fulfilment.</p>

  <p>Cleanor was now in a very difficult position. The audacious thought
  presented itself that he might engage himself in some capacity with the
  forces about to proceed from Italy, and, once arrived in Africa, take an
  opportunity of deserting. But the plan was not only perilous, for there was a
  great risk of detection,&mdash;Scipio seemed to be one of those men whose
  eyes are everywhere,&mdash;but it had a dishonourable look. But some
  stratagem would be necessary, and Cleanor's conscience did not forbid him to
  employ it.</p>

  <p>A fortunate chance cleared his way. His fellow-passenger the commissariat
  officer, happened to remember that he had spoken of his being on his way to
  Sicily, and asked him whether by chance he knew anything of the corn-market
  in that island. The Italian supply, on which considerable demands were being
  made, would certainly fall short, and nothing could be got from Africa,
  exhausted as it was by the war. Cleanor, though hating to say the thing that
  was not, declared that he had an uncle at Agrigentum who was engaged in the
  business, that he was on his way to his home, and would deliver any message
  which it would be a convenience to send.</p>

  <p>The Roman caught eagerly at the suggestion. He jotted down the number of
  bushels of wheat which he should probably want, and the price which he would
  be willing to give. The details of the business, methods of transport, terms
  of payment, and other matters might be settled with the agent who represented
  Rome at Agrigentum. He also gave our hero what was known as a diploma, a word
  which we may represent in a way by "passport", but which really meant a great
  deal more. The bearer of it could requisition horses and carriages, in short,
  any of the instruments of travel that belonged to the state. Without this it
  would hardly have been possible to proceed. A great campaign was about to
  begin, and every kind of conveyance was practically engaged.</p>

  <p>With this document in his hand Cleanor found everything open before him;
  he called on a merchant with whom, though not a kinsman, he had some
  acquaintance, and handed him the Roman's order. This done he made his way as
  quickly as possible to the coast, where he was lucky enough to find a small
  vessel in the coasting-trade that was just starting for Africa. There is a
  humble commerce that, luckily for those that conduct it, goes on through all
  the stress of war. This vessel was engaged in it; and by its opportune help
  Cleanor, two days later, found himself in Africa, and in two more had reached
  Carthage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE TWO HASDRUBALS</h2>

  <p class="first">CLEANOR found the streets of Carthage in a state of the
  wildest confusion. The news that had brought him back thither in such hot
  haste had made a profound impression upon the city itself. The name of Scipio
  was no less powerful a charm at Carthage than it was at Rome. Only it spelt
  defeat and ruin in Africa, while in Italy it seemed a sure augury of success.
  Still, the spirit of the nation was not broken. It was one of the
  characteristics of the great family of mankind to which the people of
  Carthage belonged to fight desperately when driven to stand at bay. The
  longest, the most stubbornly defended sieges in history have been when some
  Semitic people has been reduced to its last stronghold.</p>

  <p>The Punic race was now prepared to show the same fierce, unyielding fury
  of resistance with which, some two centuries later, their Jewish kinsmen were
  to meet the overpowering assault of the same enemy. One step, not taken
  without reluctance, but absolutely demanded by the necessities of the
  situation, was to bring within the walls the army that up to this time had
  been encamped outside. This force was largely, indeed almost wholly, composed
  of mercenaries, and Carthage never trusted her mercenaries more than she
  could help. She had had frequent difficulties with them; once she had been
  brought by their rebellion almost to ruin. It was a law, accordingly, that
  they should never be admitted in any great number within the walls. This law
  had now, perforce, to be repealed. It would be rash to risk a battle in the
  field, when defeat would mean so much; on the other hand, the defences of the
  city needed all the men that could be found, if they were to be adequately
  garrisoned.</p>

  <p>Cleanor on his arrival found that the process of moving the outside army
  into the city was in full swing. The roads that led to the gates were
  thronged with a motley multitude, for Carthage drew her hired soldiers from a
  very wide area indeed. There was every variety of hue, from the fair-haired
  son of Celt or Teuton of Northern Europe, to the thick-lipped, woolly-haired,
  ebony-coloured negroes, who had been drawn by the report of Carthaginian
  wealth from remote regions even beyond the Desert. The languages which they
  spoke were as various as their complexions. It had been said by a writer who
  told the story of the great revolt of the mercenaries a hundred years before,
  that the only word which they had in common was some equivalent of to "kill".
  They were still as polyglot, and, so at least it seemed to Cleanor, almost as
  savage. Much of the talk that he overheard as he made his way along the
  crowded roads was unintelligible to him, but he understood enough to make him
  sure that anger and suspicion were rife among them.</p>

  <p>He had intended to propose himself as a guest of the Hasdrubal who
  commanded the forces within the walls. Hasdrubal was a grandson of King
  Masinissa, and would be certain to give him a friendly reception. But it was
  so late in the evening before he could disentangle himself from the throng
  that blocked all the approaches to the city, that he decided to postpone till
  the morrow the delivery of his credentials. Under these circumstances he was
  glad to accept the invitation of Gisco, whom my readers may remember as a
  staff-officer of the other Hasdrubal, to share his quarters. These were in
  the guest-hall attached to the palace of the high-priest of
  <i>Melcart</i>.</p>

  <p>A large company of officers was present at the evening meal, and when the
  wine, which for flavour and strength was fully worthy of priestly cellars,
  had passed round, there was little reserve in the conversation. Cleanor's
  presence was unnoticed, or, possibly, as the guest and friend of Gisco, he
  was supposed to be in sympathy with the views held by the rest of the
  company. It soon became abundantly clear to the listener that feeling was
  running very high against the Hasdrubal who commanded the city army.</p>

  <p>"I don't like the breed," said one of Cleanor's neighbours. "He has got
  more than enough of Masinissa's blood in him, and Masinissa, I take it, was
  about the worst enemy that Carthage ever had."</p>

  <p>For anything more definite Cleanor listened in vain. It seemed to be taken
  for granted that a man with this parentage could not be faithful to his
  country. That he had betrayed Carthage no one ventured to assert. No one
  could even bring up against him any instance of mistake or negligence. It was
  not even denied that he had managed the defence of the city with
  distinguished success. Certainly no such disaster could be laid to his charge
  as the crushing defeat which the other Hasdrubal had received some four years
  before at the hands of King Masinissa. The young Greek had forcibly to
  repress a strong inclination to speak up for the accused; but he saw that his
  interference would be useless. The best, in fact the only service that he
  could do to the unfortunate man was to warn him of his danger.</p>

  <p>The question was how the warning was to be given. It was hardly possible
  to leave the guest-house that night. Sentinels had been placed at the doors,
  and these could not be passed without the watchword, and this he did not
  happen to know. All that he could do was to take care that no time should be
  lost in the morning. Fortunately Gisco, whose chamber he shared,&mdash;the
  guest-house being crowded with company to its fullest capacity,&mdash;was the
  officer on guard for the next day. Just before dawn an orderly roused him
  from his sleep, and, giving him the watchword for the day, communicated to
  himself overnight, left him, to relieve the sentries.</p>

  <p>Half an hour afterwards, Cleanor, having satisfied the challenge of the
  sentinel, passed out by the gate, and, hastening through the deserted
  streets, made the best of his way to the mansion of Hasdrubal. So little did
  that general suspect any danger that he had not even taken the precaution of
  placing a sentinel at his gate. The sleepy porter admitted Cleanor without
  asking a question, though not without a grumble at the unseasonableness of so
  early a visit.</p>

  <p>The huge negro who slept outside the general's door did not let him pass
  so readily. As the man did not understand a word of either Carthaginian,
  Latin, or Greek,&mdash;no bad qualification for an official who had to refuse
  troublesome visitors,&mdash;argument was useless. Cleanor, who felt that not
  a moment must be lost in rousing the general, raised his voice to its
  loudest, with the result that in another minute Hasdrubal opened the door of
  his chamber.</p>

  <p>He had a slight acquaintance with the Greek, knew his story, and had a
  general idea of the mission from which he had just returned.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said, "you are welcome. And you"&mdash;turning to the negro
  attendant&mdash;"fetch two cups of mulsum."</p>

  <p>Cleanor briefly stated the cause of his visit, and Hasdrubal heard him
  with undisturbed calm.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know," he said, when the story was finished, "whether I am
  surprised or not. I must own that I did not expect this particular form of
  attack, but I did expect that my namesake would do his best to oust me from
  my place as soon as he had orders to bring his troops within the walls. I
  quite see that now, when all our army is brought together into one, there
  must be one general, and I should have been ready to resign. But after what
  you have told me I must face it out; to resign would be almost to acknowledge
  that there is something in what these knaves, and the fools that follow them,
  say. There is to be a meeting of the Senate at noon to-day, and the question
  of the Command is down for debate. Of course I shall be there. So much for
  that; but you must understand that I am immensely obliged to you. I had
  intended to offer you a post on my staff, but, as things are at present, the
  less you have to do with a suspected man the better for you. If things turn
  out more favourably than I fear they may&mdash;we will certainly talk of this
  again."</p>

  <p>"But, sir," broke in the Greek with some heat, "it is surely impossible
  that the Senate should listen to such palpable absurdities as this. Why,
  there is not a general in Carthage who has such a record of successes as
  yours."</p>

  <p>"My dear young friend," replied the general, "you don't know us. The
  Carthaginians always suspect their generals. We always fight with a rope, so
  to speak, round our necks. If we are victorious they fear that we shall
  become too powerful, and protect themselves by the stroke of a dagger or a
  pinch of poison in our wine. If we are defeated, there is the usual penalty.
  They crucify us by way of an encouragement to our successors. It is not
  revenge, it is suspicion that moves them. They cannot imagine that they can
  be beaten except by treachery. It is a terrible mistake, and Carthage suffers
  for it by being far worse served than Rome. Rome has a plan that looks like
  the merest folly. She takes a man because he is popular with the shopmen and
  artisans of the city and the farmers from the country, and puts him to
  command her armies. Yet it works well, because the Romans trust each other.
  What a splendid thing it was that they did when their Consul Varro as nearly
  as possible brought them to ruin by losing their army at Cannae! The Senate
  and the people went out to meet him, and thanked him for not despairing of
  the Republic. And indeed a Republic where such things are possible need never
  be despaired of. But it is useless to talk. And now for yourself. Get away
  from this house as soon as you can, and go by the private door which the
  negro will show you. No; not another word. Carthage will not let me serve her
  any more, but she need not lose you also. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal touched a small gong which stood by his bed, and when the negro
  appeared in answer to the summons gave him the brief instruction:</p>

  <p>"The postern-gate for this gentleman."</p>

  <p>Cleanor followed his guide, and in a short time was shown out into an
  unfrequented lane which ran at the back of Hasdrubal's house. He reached his
  quarters before the other guests had commenced their morning meal.</p>

  <p>The prudent course for him to follow was, obviously, to stand aside and
  watch the progress of events. Yet such prudence was alien to his temper.
  Hasdrubal was the hereditary friend of his family, and he was related to the
  old king from whom Cleanor had received such unexpected kindness. There was
  but the faintest chance that he should be able to give him any help; but to
  Cleanor it seemed ungrateful, and even inhuman, to stand aloof But what was
  he to do? To begin with, he was met with what seemed an insuperable
  difficulty&mdash;the meetings of the Senate were of course private. How was
  he to gain admission? This obstacle, however, was soon removed. Gisco brought
  him a message from his chief that he had been summoned to attend a meeting of
  the Senate, and desired his attendance as one of his body-guard.</p>

  <p>The meeting of the Senate, held as usual in the temple of Baal- Hammon,
  otherwise known as Moloch, was an imposing scene. On two thrones in the
  eastern semicircular recess of the building&mdash;corresponding to the
  sanctuary in the Hebrew temple or the chancel or apse in a Christian
  church&mdash;sat the two kings or Shophetim, wearing robes of the richest
  Tyrian purple, with richly-jeweled diadems on their heads. Facing them were
  semicircular benches, crowded with the members of the Inner Senate, as it may
  be called. Scarcely one of the Hundred&mdash;this was the number to which it
  was limited&mdash;was absent from his post. Further removed were other
  benches similarly arranged, and set apart for the Four Hundred or Outer
  Senate. It was evident at once that, whatever might be the usual custom, this
  meeting at least was not private. The body of the temple was filled with a
  vast crowd, separated from the assembly itself by nothing more than a slight
  barrier of wood. Hasdrubal of the Camp, as we may call him by way of
  distinction, was seated just within this; his body-guard were ranged close
  behind him, but on the outer side of the barrier. The other Hasdrubal
  occupied his usual place as one of the Inner Senate.</p>

  <p>The proceedings of the day having been opened with the customary
  ceremonies, the senior king called upon Mago, son of Hamilcar, to bring
  forward the motion of which he had given notice. Mago, an elderly man, whose
  countenance greatly belied him if he was not an incarnation of the Punic bad
  faith which had passed into a proverb, rose in his place and made a speech of
  studied moderation.</p>

  <p>"Rumours," he said, "have for some days been current in the city that
  Carthage is not faithfully served by some of those to whom she has committed
  offices of great dignity and importance. One man has been specially pointed
  to. For my part I refuse to believe that a soldier who has often
  distinguished himself in the field can be unfaithful to the country which he
  has served so well. But the best service that can be rendered to a man
  accused&mdash;may I not say calumniated?&mdash;is to give him the opportunity
  of defence. I accordingly move that Hasdrubal, son of Mago&mdash;for why
  should I refrain from mentioning a name which is on the lips of
  everyone?&mdash; be called upon to give to the Senate any explanations that
  he may think proper to make."</p>

  <p>An approving murmur ran through the crowd when the speaker sat down. The
  accused man rose in his place,&mdash;but before he could speak another
  senator had intervened.</p>

  <p>"I do not see," said this senator, "that Hasdrubal, son of Mago, has
  anything to explain. No evidence has been brought against him. I have not
  even heard any charge, except it be that there are rumours against him. What
  man is there against whom there are not rumours? And the better the man the
  more malignant the rumours. I move that the Senate proceed to the next
  business." A murmur, not by any means of approval, rose from the crowd.
  Hasdrubal, who had resumed his seat while the last speaker was addressing the
  Senate, rose again.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to explain," he said. "You know me, who I am, and what I
  have done."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we know you!" cried a voice from the crowd. "The grandson of that
  accursed brigand, Masinissa."</p>

  <p>The name was met with a howl of fury from the multitude, followed by
  deafening cries of "Brigand!" "Traitor!" Hasdrubal faced the uproar without
  flinching. But it was an hour of such madness as makes men blind and deaf to
  all that might appeal to their better feelings. Something might be said, not
  in excuse, but in explanation of the frenzy. An imperial race, reared in
  traditions of greatness, felt itself to be approaching the hour of servitude
  or extinction, and it raged like a wild beast in a net. Nothing that came
  within reach of its fury was likely to be spared. The multitude surged
  forward, the wooden barrier gave way, and the inclosed space assigned to the
  senators was crowded in an instant with a raging crowd.</p>

  <p>Cleanor caught one glimpse of the doomed man's face, pale but still
  resolute. The next moment it had disappeared.</p>

  <p>He sprang forward, crying, "Save him!" though, unarmed as he was, for no
  weapon was allowed within the building, he felt miserably helpless. In fact,
  he could have done nothing, and, fortunately for himself, he was not even
  permitted to try. His arms were seized from behind, and a cloak was thrown
  over his head. The next moment he felt himself lifted from the ground, and
  carried, he knew not whither. He could not even struggle, for both arms and
  legs had been deftly secured, while his voice was choked by the covering that
  enveloped his head.</p>

  <p>When, half an hour afterwards, the cloak was removed, he found himself in
  a small chamber, with no companion but a slave, who was apparently a
  deaf-mute, as he replied to all questions with the single gesture of putting
  his finger on his lips.</p>

  <p>In the course of another half-hour Gisco appeared.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "pardon this violence, which would, indeed, be
  inexcusable, if it had not been the only way of saving your life. Believe me,
  you have friends who will soon, I hope, find more agreeable ways of showing
  their good-will than they were forced to this morning. You have been watched
  ever since you came into Carthage, though you have not known it. The council
  have spies everywhere, and they know their business. They knew that you were
  a friend of Hasdrubal, and felt sure that you would do your best to help him.
  They followed you to his house, they heard what you said to him and he to
  you, and they brought the report to the chief. He has a great liking for you,
  and gave me carte blanche to do what I pleased, if only I could keep you out
  of danger. So, if there has been anything rude in the method of saving you,
  it is I whom you must blame. Believe me, you would have sacrificed yourself
  for nothing. It was impossible to save Hasdrubal. The fact is, he ought to
  have taken warning long ago, for warning he has had in plenty. Again and
  again he has been told that a grandson of Masinissa could never be safe in
  Carthage, and he ought to have gone long ago. Mind, I say nothing against
  him. He was obstinate, but it was a noble obstinacy. He knew himself to be
  blameless, and he wanted to save Carthage."</p>

  <p>"And what has happened to him?" asked Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"The worst, I fear," answered Gisco; "but more I really do not know. I was
  busy with your affair, and saw nothing."</p>

  <p>Cleanor heard the shocking story afterwards from an eye-witness. The
  crowd, led by some of the senators&mdash;his informant was positive on the
  point that some of the senators had a hand in the deed&mdash;had torn up the

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12"></a>XII. &mdash; SCIPIO SETS TO WORK</h2>

  <p class="first">CLEANOR, though he had no proofs of Hasdrubal's complicity
  in the crime just committed, could not rid himself of the suspicion that he
  had had something to do with it. No one profited by it more; he had been
  present when the deed was done, and had not spoken a word or lifted a finger
  to hinder it. Such a suspicion was enough in itself to make any post which
  brought him into close contact with the general distasteful to the young man.
  And Hasdrubal's personal habits were revolting to his taste. The man was
  given over to gluttony. He had a sufficiently clear intelligence and some
  military skill, but the enormous meals in which he indulged produced a
  condition of torpor which disabled him during a great part of the day.</p>

  <p>Cleanor, therefore, was not a little pleased when, through the good
  offices of Gisco, he was attached to the staff of one of Hasdrubal's
  lieutenants, Himilco by name. Himilco had charge of a portion of the wall
  looking towards the sea, about four stadia in length. Cleanor had the duty,
  which he shared with another officer, of seeing that the sentinels were
  properly vigilant during the night. Each was responsible for two of the four
  watches, their practice being for one to take the first and fourth, the other
  the second and third.</p>

  <p>At this time the chief interest of the siege was centred at this point,
  where it seemed not improbable that the Romans would have to suffer a very
  serious check. The second-in-command of the besieging force, who had a
  special charge of the fleet, an officer of more enterprise than judgment, had
  seen, as he thought, a chance of greatly distinguishing himself. Having taken
  advantage of a long spell of settled weather to stand-in more closely than
  usual to the shore, he had observed, or rather, it had been pointed out to
  him by a sharp-sighted young officer, a portion of the ramparts which
  appeared to be insufficiently guarded. The wall here ran along the top of a
  precipice, so steep and inaccessible that it might almost seem unnecessary to
  supplement by art the provision of nature. Such spots, however, while they
  seem to be the strongest, are often in fact the weakest part of a
  fortification. A fortunate chance put Mancinus&mdash;this was the Roman
  admiral's name&mdash;in possession of the fact that the cliffs were not by
  any means so difficult of access as they seemed. One of the fishermen who
  plied their trade along the coast had come on board the admiral's ship with a
  cargo of fish for sale. He was asked whether there was any way of scaling the
  cliffs, and replied that there was, and promised, in consideration of a
  couple of gold pieces, to act as guide. Mancinus accordingly, having waited
  for a dull night, landed a force of about a thousand men. The guide fulfilled
  his promise and showed them the path, which, thanks to the negligence of the
  besieged, they found entirely unguarded.</p>

  <p>For a time everything went well. The sentinels had come to regard this
  beat as one which might be neglected without risk. When they chanced to be
  told off to this duty they were accustomed to sleep as unconcernedly as if
  they had been in their beds at home. About fifty or sixty of the assailants
  had mounted the walls by help of scaling-ladders when the alarm was given.
  The besieged had organized a flying detachment of five hundred men, whose
  business it was to be ready for any emergency, and to hurry at once to any
  spot where they might be wanted.</p>

  <p>This force now came up at full speed, and the few who had mounted the wall
  were promptly dislodged. This done, the officer in command ordered the
  nearest gate to be opened, and sallied out at the head of his men. But he had
  not expected to find so formidable a force opposed to him. His division was
  completely overmatched, and was driven back within the walls, the Romans
  making their way through the gate&mdash;which there had been no time to
  shut&mdash;along with the retreating enemy.</p>

  <p>Both sides were now reinforced, the Carthaginians by fresh detachments
  from the garrison, the Romans by Mancinus himself with another contingent
  from the fleet. The result of the fighting, which was continued throughout
  the night, was that the Romans retired from within the walls, but occupied a
  fairly strong position outside.</p>

  <p>In earlier days, when the idea that Carthaginian territory could be
  successfully invaded had not occurred to anyone, a wealthy merchant of the
  city had built himself a mansion on a space of level ground between the wall
  and the cliff. The mansion was surrounded with spacious gardens and orchards,
  and these again were protected from trespassers by a deep ditch and a wall of
  unusual height. Here Mancinus intrenched himself. He still cherished the hope
  that he might make good his footing, and use the position as a starting-point
  for successful operations against the city. What a splendid achievement it
  would be if he could falsify what had come to be a commonly accepted belief,
  if it was to turn out that a Mancinus, not a Scipio, was the conqueror of
  Carthage! And indeed he was so far right that he always had the credit of
  having been the first to effect a lodgment within the boundaries of Carthage
  itself.</p>

  <p>For the present, however, his position was precarious. He had no stock of
  provisions with him, except that the men had been ordered to carry rations
  for three days. Supplies could, of course, be obtained from the ships, but
  only so long as the weather continued fine. A week of strong wind from the
  sea would reduce him to absolute starvation. Of water there was already a
  scarcity. The builder of the mansion had provided an ample supply for a large
  household, but there was nothing like enough for between two and three
  thousand men. And, apart from the difficulties about food and drink, the
  position was not one which could be permanently held. The wall round the
  mansion, for instance, was not a military fortification. It was meant to keep
  out trespassers, not to resist battering-rams.</p>

  <p>This, then, was the state of affairs when Cleanor took up his command. Two
  days had passed since Mancinus had occupied the position outside the walls,
  and he was already in distress. The contingency for which he had made no
  provision had occurred. The wind was blowing strongly from the sea, and the
  captains of the fleet had thought it prudent to stand off from the shore. The
  Carthaginians were perfectly well aware of the condition of affairs. They had
  intercepted a messenger carrying an urgent appeal for help to head-quarters,
  and knew that, unless there was a change of weather, the Romans must be
  reduced to extremities. Their policy was, of course, to sit still and wait.
  There was, indeed, a good chance that if the battering-rams were vigorously
  applied to the walls, a breach might be made, and an assault successfully
  made. But an assault, whatever the result, would cost many lives. And of all
  men no one is more bound to be economical of life than he who commands the
  garrison of a besieged town; and this for the simple reason that he cannot
  hope to get recruits. In the course of two or three days more the Romans
  would have to capitulate, or fight at a terrible disadvantage. Scipio, it was
  true, was now daily expected, and, if he arrived in time, would be sure to
  make a vigorous effort to save his countrymen. But that he should arrive in
  time seemed almost impossible.</p>

  <p>But the Carthaginians did not know Scipio. Cleanor himself&mdash;who, as
  has been seen, had had opportunities of estimating the remarkable qualities
  of the man&mdash;was taken by surprise, such were the energy and the
  promptitude with which the Roman acted. With that remarkable foresight which
  he did not scruple himself to attribute to divine prompting, and which we may
  anyhow describe as genius, he had made special preparation for such a
  contingency as had actually occurred. He had selected the ten swiftest ships
  out of the fleet which accompanied him from Italy, and had put on board them
  a picked force of five hundred men. With this squadron he had outstripped the
  slower sailers by not less than forty-eight hours, an invaluable saving of
  time as it turned out.</p>

  <p>He reached Utica, which was about twenty-seven miles west of Carthage, at
  sunset on the day on which Mancinus had sent his appeal for help. Two ''of
  the three messengers who had been despatched on this errand had been
  captured, but one had contrived to elude the Carthaginian watchmen, and had
  reached Utica at midnight. Scipio did not lose a moment. His own men were
  ready for instant action, but they were scarcely numerous enough for the work
  which they might have to do.</p>

  <p>He found abundance of help in Utica. At an earlier period of the war he
  had spent seven months in this town in command of a detachment quartered
  there. The influence of his extraordinary personality had made itself felt in
  Utica as it did everywhere else. Old and young in the city were devoted to
  him. What we should now call a battalion of volunteers had been raised, of
  which he had consented to be the honorary tribune. Late as it was, he sent a
  herald through the streets with notice that this force was to muster
  immediately at the harbour. In the course of little more than an hour the
  battalion had assembled at the place indicated for a rendezvous in full
  strength, not a single member, except some half-dozen incapacitated by
  sickness, being absent. A requisition also was made for lads and elderly men,
  and of these there was such a throng that the task for which they were
  wanted, carrying provisions and stores on board the squadron, might have been
  clone five times over. All worked with such a will that before sunrise
  everything was actually ready, and the squadron was able to make a start.</p>

  <p>Scipio's arrival had been observed at Carthage, the harbour of Utica being
  distinctly visible, not-withstanding the distance, through the clear
  atmosphere of the north African coast. He had himself taken pains to assure
  its being known, for he was not above utilizing to the utmost the impression
  made, as he was well aware, by his name. He had no sooner reached Utica than
  he ordered that some seamen, who were among the Carthaginian prisoners,
  should be set free, supplied with a fast-sailing pinnace, and commissioned to
  deliver at Carthage the message, "Scipio is come".</p>

  <p>That he would hasten to the relief of Mancinus everyone in Carthage knew,
  and orders were issued accordingly that the position of that general should
  be attacked as soon as possible after dawn. This was prompt, but it was not
  prompt enough.</p>

  <p>The night, indeed, was not lost. Battering-rams were brought to bear upon
  the wall surrounding the mansion, and several breaches were made, ready for
  the storming parties to enter as soon as it was light. Before morning,
  indeed, the wall was so shattered that it became practically indefensible,
  and Mancinus abandoned the idea of holding it against the assailants. He
  formed his men into a square, with the heavy-armed, who numbered about five
  hundred, outside, and the light troops, who had no protection beyond a steel
  cap and small target, within.</p>

  <p>Himilco, who personally directed the attack, ordered a charge on a corner
  of the square, where the lines had been made up with Numidian auxiliaries. He
  hoped to find them less sturdy in resistance than the regular legionaries,
  who were all Italians. Cleanor, who was having his first experience of
  serious fighting, was in the front rank of the charge, and had the
  satisfaction of seeing the Roman line waver. But it wavered without
  breaking.</p>

  <p>The Numidians were under the command of a deputy centurion, a Picenian
  mountaineer of huge stature and herculean strength. Springing to the front he
  killed a heavily-armed Carthaginian out-right with one thrust of his pike.
  Then he struck Cleanor full in the breast. The finely-wrought cuirass of
  steel, a gift from the old king, withstood the blow, but the wearer was
  hurled backward with irresistible force and came to the ground with a shock
  which partially stunned him. When Himilco ordered a retreat he had to be
  supported by his companions.</p>

  <p>But though the charge had been repulsed, the position of the Roman force
  was full of peril. The heavily-armed men in the front ranks were no
  protection to their less fully equipped comrades against the incessant
  showers of missiles which the archers, javelin-throwers, and slingers rained
  upon the helpless men inside the square. Their own armour was not always
  proof against them, still less against the stones which the catapults, now
  put in position on the city walls, discharged into their ranks. The whole
  body continued to edge away out of range of the walls, heedless of the fact
  that every step brought them nearer to the cliffs.</p>

  <p>A catastrophe was imminent when Scipio's squadron cam in sight. The decks
  were crowded, every available man putting himself as much in evidence as
  possible. This was Scipio's command, given in order to create an impression
  of greater numbers than he really possessed. The effect on the contending
  forces was instantaneous and great. The Carthaginian leaders felt themselves
  to be in the presence of a formidable antagonist, and stood on the defensive.
  The forces of Mancinus recovered the confidence which they had lost. Scipio's
  arrival was soon followed by the appearance of Mancinus' own ships. For it
  was one of the many instances of the extraordinary good fortune which seemed
  to attend on Scipio throughout his career, that no sooner had he appeared on
  the scene than the weather changed. The wind veered round, and now blew with
  moderate strength from the shore. It was still a couple of hours from noon
  when the whole force under Mancinus had reembarked.</p>

  <p>"We must never lose a moment," said Gisco to out hero, when they were
  talking over the events of the day, "if we are to keep up with this wonderful
  man. As to being beforehand with him that seems impossible. Who would have
  thought that, after coming all the way from Italy, he would have started
  again almost without giving himself time to sup! This is a very different
  thing from Piso's way of doing business."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13"></a>XIII. &mdash; IN THE ROMAN CAMP</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE had been, as has been seen, not a few fluctuations of
  fortune in the conflicts which had followed after the landing of Mancinus.
  One result of this had been that a considerable number of prisoners had been
  taken on both sides. Both sides, also, were anxious for an exchange. The
  Carthaginians did not care to have any more useless men to feed than could be
  helped; the Romans feared, and not without reason, that their friends and
  comrades would be barbarously treated. Carthage had always had an evil
  reputation in this respect, and was only too likely to justify it, if ever
  she should be driven to extremities.</p>

  <p>The envoy who conducted the negotiations on behalf of the city was a
  member of the Senate named Maharbal. He had made himself conspicuous as a
  leader of the peace, otherwise the pro-Roman, party, and was supposed,
  therefore, to be acceptable to Scipio. Cleanor accompanied him in the
  capacity of interpreter. The interviews would be conducted in Greek, a
  language which Scipio spoke fluently. As for Latin, there was no one in
  Carthage who was able to speak more than a few words of it; nor was there in
  the Roman camp any more knowledge of the Punic tongue. There could not be a
  greater proof of the irreconcilable hostility of the two nations than this
  mutual ignorance.</p>

  <p>Cleanor's visit was paid at a very interesting time, for the Roman camp
  was undergoing, at the hands of the new commander, a very thorough process of
  cleansing. It had fallen, under the management of his incompetent
  predecessors, into a most deplorable condition. In the first place it swarmed
  with disreputable camp-followers. There was a crowd of sutlers, traders who
  sold to the soldiers various luxuries at the most extravagant prices, and
  bought from them their plunder for ridiculously small sums of ready money.
  There was a still greater multitude of soldiers' servants. Even a private
  trooper must have a slave to groom his horse; and an infantry soldier thought
  it a hardship if he had to dean and polish his own arms. As some of the
  officers had a whole establishment of attendants, there was a second army of
  servants actually more numerous than the first army of fighting men.</p>

  <p>Scipio made short work with these useless and mischievous encumbrances. No
  sutler or dealer was allowed to remain in the camp, or even in the
  neighbourhood, unless he held the general's license. Even then he was not
  allowed to sell any articles but such as were contained in a very brief list
  authorized by the general, and at prices which had received his sanction. The
  purchase of articles from the soldiers was absolutely forbidden. Indeed, the
  trade ceased of itself, for plunder was rigidly prohibited. Any soldier who
  went further from the camp than the bugle could be heard made himself liable
  to be treated as a deserter. The reform in the matter of the soldiers'
  servants was no less radical. Two were allowed to a tribune, one to a
  centurion, and four, who were to be owned and employed in common, to a
  century or company of infantry and a troop of cavalry. All these were to be
  able-bodied men, who had learnt military drill; and they were liable on
  occasion to serve in the ranks.</p>

  <p>Scipio, still acting on the principle which had made him announce his
  arrival to the Carthaginians, kept nothing secret from the envoy and his
  escort; he took pains, on the contrary, that they should see and learn
  everything that was to be seen or learnt. He invited them to be present at a
  general assembly of the army, which was summoned during their stay in the
  camp to hear an address from himself. Maharbal knew, as has been said, next
  to nothing of Latin, and Cleanor did not know enough to enable him to follow
  Scipio throughout. Nevertheless, they could see that the effect of the speech
  was remarkable. The orator held his audience, so to speak, in the hollow of
  his hand. He was not speaking smooth things to his army; on the contrary, he
  told them that they were robbers rather than soldiers. He laid down for them
  for the future a most rigid discipline; he gave them no hope of indulgence.
  But he was heard with profound attention and without a murmur of dissent or
  complaint.</p>

  <p>The next morning Cleanor saw the banished multitude embark. A stranger
  spectacle, a more motley crowd, and a more curious miscellany of property was
  never beheld. One man was disconsolately watching while a score of wine
  casks, full of some poisonous liquid which he had hoped an African sun would
  sell for him, was hoisted on board; another had with him a troop of
  performing dogs; a third was conducting a troop of singing and dancing girls,
  whose rouged cheeks and tawdry finery looked melancholy enough in the
  merciless light. The exiles were not by any means silent; they cursed and
  quarrelled in a perfect Babel of languages; but they did not dare to linger.
  A cordon of soldiers kept them rigidly within the boundaries of the place of
  embarkation. Vessel after vessel took on board its cargo with a marvellous
  regularity and speed. Before evening the camp had been brought back to a
  primitive severity and simplicity which were worthy of the best times of the
  Republic.</p>

  <p>In the matter of the exchange Maharbal found the Roman general liberal to
  the point of generosity. He was not careful to exact a very close
  correspondence in the dignity or the number of the prisoners to be given up
  and received. When every Roman had been accounted for, a considerable balance
  of Carthaginians still remained in Scipio's hands. The envoy offered to
  redeem them at the price which had been customary in former wars, two pounds
  and a half of silver per man. Scipio smilingly refused to receive it. "Your
  Hannibal," he said, "used to empty our treasury, for it was seldom but he had
  more prisoners to give than to receive. You must let me have the satisfaction
  of feeling that for once I am able to be generous."</p>

  <p>It was easy to transact business on such terms. When all was settled the
  general invited the Carthaginian and his interpreter, whom he had greeted in
  a most friendly fashion, to share his evening meal. He had thoughtfully
  arranged that the two young officers who were his aides-de- camp, and as such
  were commonly guests at his table, should not be present. He felt that their
  company would not be agreeable; to Maharbal and still less to the young
  Greek. The only other guest was a person whom Cleanor especially was
  delighted to meet. This was the historian Polybius, who had already acquired
  a considerable reputation as a soldier, a statesman, and a man of letters.
  Cleanor, during his sojourn at Athens, had heard his character as a
  politician hotly debated; that he was an honest man no one doubted.
  Personally he was prejudiced against him as a partisan of Rome. But he found
  it impossible to resist the charm of his conversation.</p>

  <p>The hours passed only too quickly in such delightful company, and when the
  time came to separate, Cleanor felt that he had not said a tenth part of what
  he wanted to say to his new acquaintance. As they were making their
  farewells, Polybius, who had heard from Scipio an outline of the young
  Greek's story, found an opportunity of saying a few kindly words.</p>

  <p>"I could wish," he whispered, with a friendly pressure of the hand, "that
  things were otherwise with you. Mind, I don't blame you, or doubt but that
  you are quite loyal to conscience in what you do. But, believe me, you are on
  the wrong side. Is there anyone in Carthage whom you can compare in anything
  that makes the worth of a man with our noble Scipio? I know something of what
  you feel, though I have not the same cause, for I also am a Greek and have
  lost my country; but the gods give the sovereignty to whom they will, and who
  are we to fight against them? Farewell for the present! but I am sure that we
  shall meet again, and under happier circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I thank you for saying so," replied Cleanor; "but the future looks very
  dark to me."</p>

  <p>And, indeed, as he made his way back to the city, listening with but half
  his mind to Maharbal's enthusiastic praises of the courtesy and liberality of
  the Roman commander, he felt his spirits sink into a deeper depression than
  he had ever known before.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE MEGARA</h2>

  <p class="first">COURTEOUS, and even generous, as Scipio had showed himself
  in the matter of the exchange of prisoners, he was not a man to let slip a
  single advantage that might fall into his hands, or, when he delivered a
  blow, to hesitate to strike with all his force. He allowed a short time for
  his army to get used to the new condition of things. This he could well
  afford, for the season was yet early. When he found his army restored to a
  sound condition, physical and moral, at once hardened to labour and amenable
  to discipline, in a word, thoroughly efficient, he proceeded to act. It was
  as a keen, well-tempered sword in his hands, and he struck with promptitude
  and energy.</p>

  <p>His first plan was to follow the line of attack which Mancinus had
  initiated. The weak spot in the defences of a wealthy city is commonly found
  in the buildings which are allowed to grow up in times of peace outside the
  fortifications. Life in a walled city is often both irksome and unhealthy.
  The poor, always compelled to put up with a narrow space whether within walls
  or without them, is indifferent, but the rich man wants his garden and his
  playground, wants room for the health of his family or his own entertainment.
  In this way a suburb, mainly consisting of residences of the wealthy, had
  grown up outside the northern walls of the city. It presented, only on a
  larger scale, much the same features as the locality which Mancinus had fixed
  upon as his point of attack. But it had a fortified wall of its own. This had
  in process of time become a necessity. For more than four centuries after its
  foundation Carthage had never seen a foreign invader on its soil. But there
  came a time when its enemies discovered that it might be most effectually
  attacked at home. Therefore, splendid houses which offered a rich prize to
  the plunderer could no longer be left without a defence, and the Megara had
  to be surrounded with a fortification, which started from the city wall and
  joined it again. But the space which had to be inclosed was great, and the
  new wall was neither so strong, so well furnished with towers, nor so
  adequately garrisoned as the old. It was meant, in fact, rather for a
  protection against a sudden attack than as a permanent defence.</p>

  <p>Scipio resolved on a night assault, an operation possible only to a
  thoroughly well-disciplined army. He divided his force into two columns,
  taking personal command of the one which was actually to attack. The other
  was to make a demonstration, which was not to be developed into an assault
  except the officer at its head saw a particularly favourable opportunity. As
  the two points threatened were more than a couple of miles apart&mdash;so
  great was the circuit of the Megara wall&mdash;the attention of the garrison
  was effectually distracted. Scipio's column succeeded in reaching its
  destination unobserved, and its sudden approach, coupled with the alarm
  simultaneously raised on the other side, threw the garrison into
  confusion.</p>

  <p>But the assault received a check. A deserter had indicated the spot where
  the wall might be most easily scaled. It had been used as a short cut by
  marauders, stragglers, and others who did not care to go in or out by the
  gate. Some stones had been broken down at the top of the wall, while at the
  bottom there was a natural rise in the ground which diminished the height.
  But the place had not escaped the vigilance of the officer whose business it
  was to inspect this portion of the fortification. The stones had been
  replaced and the rise in the ground levelled. A determined attempt was then
  made at various points with the scaling&mdash;ladders. But an assailant who
  is mounting a ladder is at a considerable disadvantage when matched with an
  antagonist who has a firm footing on the wall above. Here and there, indeed,
  especially where a bit of the wall lay in shadow, the ladder could be applied
  and the wall scaled unobserved by the guard. But these successes could not be
  followed up. The soldiers who thus made good their footing on the top were
  few and far between; unable to help each other, they could not hold the
  ground that they had won. The only decided advantage obtained in this
  direction was the capture of one of the small towers disposed at intervals
  along the wall. This tower had been deserted by its guard, who had hurried to
  repel a scaling-party, and was occupied by the Romans in their absence.</p>

  <p>Scipio saw that he was losing men to no purpose, and ordered the retreat
  to be sounded. But his quick eye had detected a place which seemed to promise
  better. Some resident in Megara had felt the same impatience of being kept
  within walls to which the whole suburb itself owed its first existence, and
  had built, in a spot which commanded a wide view over the sea, one of those
  towers which we now commonly call "follies". The place was of course deserted
  when the war broke out, but it was not destroyed, as it ought to have been,
  for it was dangerously near the wall. So near, indeed, was it that it was
  quite possible to throw a bridge across the intervening space; fortunately,
  too, it was not very far from the tower mentioned above as having been
  occupied by the assailants. A considerable force of archers and slingers was
  brought up to the spot, and they kept up so vigorous a discharge of missiles
  that this portion of the wall, some fifty paces or so in length, was
  absolutely cleared of its defenders. Two scaling-ladders, hastily lashed
  together, served sufficiently well for a bridge. Across this two or three
  scores of active young soldiers, picked out for their courage and strength,
  made their way in rapid succession, and descending from the wall on the inner
  side, hastened to open one of the gates. Before an hour had passed, Scipio,
  with nearly four thousand men, was within the walls of the Megara.</p>

  <p>For a time the panic was as great as if Carthage itself, and not a suburb,
  which never could have been seriously defended, had been taken. The garrison
  of the Megara fled in wild confusion to the inner city, the gates of which
  were blocked with a crowd of frantic fugitives. Cleanor, who had joined the
  flying division as a volunteer, found himself carried back towards the city
  walls by a quite irresistible torrent of panic- stricken men.</p>

  <p>Then a rally took place. In the first place the fugitives were compelled
  to halt, if for no other reason than because they could not get through the
  gates. Then the old instinct of obedience and discipline reasserted itself,
  especially in the mercenaries, among whom the panic had been most severe.
  Little by little the officers were able to restore some kind of order, and
  even to recover some of the lost ground. The defenders had the inestimable
  advantage of knowing the locality. To the mercenaries, indeed, most of whom
  had never been inside Carthage, the place was as strange as it was to the
  Romans; but the flying division consisted entirely of native troops, and
  these were thoroughly at home among the lanes and alleys of the Megara, where
  indeed most of them had their family residences.</p>

  <p>Cleanor had an hour or so of very lively adventure in the company of an
  officer of the division, and could not help feeling a certain regret when he
  heard the Roman bugles sound the recall. Scipio, in truth, had found that his
  position was not by any means desirable. The Megara was almost covered with
  detached houses, each surrounded by its gardens and orchards, these again
  being intersected by running streams, some of which were of considerable
  depth, and had branches winding in all directions. Any adequate military
  occupation of such a region would require a much larger force than he had at
  hand, and would serve no useful purpose. And he could not quite trust his
  men. They had accepted his reforms with wonderful docility, but here they
  were in the presence of almost overpowering temptations. Many of the houses
  in the Megara were full of the accumulated wealth of centuries. A few minutes
  among such possessions would enrich a soldier with more than he could hope to
  acquire in twenty campaigns. In fact, it was only too probable that the men
  would take to plundering, and quite certain that, if they did, they would be
  destroyed in detail. There were abundant reasons, therefore, why the Roman
  general should order a retreat. Even as it was, his losses were not
  inconsiderable.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether anyone has been paying a visit here?" said Cleanor's
  companion to him as they approached one of the houses in the Megara. "This is
  my father's place."</p>

  <p>It should be explained that the non-combatant population had fled from the
  Megara as soon as it was attacked. Even before that many persons had deserted
  their houses for safer quarters within the city itself.</p>

  <p>"It is a very likely place," the Carthaginian continued, "for a man to
  lose his way in. Perhaps we may lay our hands on a prize. Come this way; I
  know the best place for waiting."</p>

  <p>The two young men, taking a couple of soldiers with them, made their way
  down a narrow lane which skirted the garden of the house. The moon had set by
  this time, but there was a dim light of dawn. After a few minutes of waiting,
  the party could plainly hear that someone was approaching.</p>

  <p>"There must be two men at least," whispered the Carthaginian; "and they
  have missed the path, for they are crashing through the shrubs. By Dagon! we
  have them, for there is a bit of deep water that they must get over. Let us
  come a little further on. Mago, you know the hand-bridge; go as quick as you
  can and secure it."</p>

  <p>He had scarcely finished speaking when the party for which they were
  watching came in sight. It consisted of three persons, and there was now
  enough light to distinguish them. One was a Roman officer. He wore the
  ornaments of a tribune, and might have been some twenty years of age. His two
  companions were private soldiers, and light-armed. The three, forcing their
  way through the shrubbery, which here was particularly dense, came upon the
  water. It was evidently an entirely unexpected obstacle.</p>

  <p>"Caius," said the officer, addressing one of the men, "how is this to be
  managed?"</p>

  <p>"We can jump it," the man answered, "with the help of our spears. When we
  are on the further side, you, sir, must do the best you can, and we will help
  you out."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said the officer, "jump!"</p>

  <p>"Let them go," whispered the Carthaginian to Cleanor, "we don't want them;
  but the officer will be a prize worth having."</p>

  <p>Each of the two soldiers planted his spear in the bed of the stream, and
  swung himself across without much difficulty. The tribune, having first
  thrown his sword to the other side, jumped his furthest. No run was possible,
  for the shrubs were thick on the bank; still it was a good
  leap&mdash;excellent, indeed, considering the weight of the young Roman's
  armour. The breadth of the water was about twenty-four feet, and the tribune
  had cleared eighteen. His companions were in the act of reaching out one of
  their spears for him to grasp when the Carthaginian and his party showed
  themselves. The young Roman understood the situation in a moment.</p>

  <p>"Save yourselves," he gasped, as soon as he could speak, "I am lost!"</p>

  <p>After a moment's hesitation the men obeyed. To stay would have been a
  useless sacrifice, for they must have been inevitably cut down while they
  were attempting to save their companion.</p>

    <p class="caption">"Do you yield?" said Cleanor when the Roman had reached
    the shore.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Speak to him," said the Carthaginian. "Try him with Greek; the Roman
  gentlemen mostly know it. But perhaps we had better help him out of the water
  first."</p>

  <p>"Do you yield?" said Cleanor in Greek, when the Roman had reached the
  shore.</p>

  <p>"I see no choice," replied the young man in the same language.</p>

  <p>Giving his promise that he would not attempt to escape, he received his
  sword, and accompanied his captors to the city. A few inquiries, made and
  answered in Greek, satisfied them that they had indeed, as the Carthaginian
  had anticipated, secured a prize. The tribune was a Scipio, a kinsman not
  very distantly related to the commander.</p>

  <p>"Let him be your prisoner," said Cleanor's companion to him. "He may bring
  you promotion, which I am pretty sure of in any case. Though, indeed," he
  added after a pause, "I strongly suspect that it will be all the same for
  most of us, promotion or no promotion, a year hence."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE PRISONERS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Roman became so unwell, from the shock of his sudden
  immersion following on a night of unusual exertion, that Cleanor found it
  necessary to take him to his quarters. They were sitting together at the
  morning meal a few hours later, when Cleanor's soldier-servant announced that
  someone had called to see him on urgent business. It was the Carthaginian
  officer in whose company he had been during the adventures of the night
  preceding.</p>

  <p>"What about the young Roman?" asked the new-comer, who seemed to be in a
  state of great agitation. "Did you give him up at head-quarters, or did you
  bring him here by accident?"</p>

  <p>"He is here," replied Cleanor. "He seemed so weak that I thought it best
  to bring him home with me."</p>

  <p>"That is well," said the Carthaginian, "though really I can hardly say
  whether it is well. Do you know what has happened?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard nothing. My chief has released me from duty for four-
  and-twenty hours, and I have taken the chance of getting a good long
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"Well, there have been most horrible doings. Hasdrubal was in a towering
  rage this morning when he heard what had been going on in the Megara. The
  fact is"&mdash;the speaker lowered his voice to a whisper&mdash;"that,
  between you and me, he was too tipsy last night to appear. I am told that
  they could not make him understand anything. That did not make him more
  amiable this morning. Then he has been blamed for letting the Megara remain
  as it is, and especially for the tower, which certainly ought not to have
  been allowed to stand. And lastly, there has been more talk of capitulation
  during the last few days. People were very much struck with Scipio's
  liberality in the matter of the prisoners, and have begun to think that
  better terms might be got from him. Well, all these things have been working
  him up to a great pitch of fury. So this morning he had all the prisoners
  that were taken in last night's business, some threescore altogether, brought
  down to the wall at the point nearest to the Roman camp, and there he
  tortured them to death in the cruellest way. We Carthaginians are not so
  squeamish as you Greeks; but I tell you that I felt fairly sick at what I
  saw, and I did not see a half or even a quarter of the horrors that took
  place. Some had their eyes or their tongues torn out, some were flayed alive;
  and when he had done with them, he had them flung down from the wall. 'Tell
  your general,' he shouted out, when the last of the poor wretches was tossed
  down, 'tell your general that I shan't charge him more than one copper coin
  apiece for them."</p>

  <p>"But this is mere madness," cried Cleanor. "What can he have been thinking
  of? What was his motive?"</p>

  <p>"That is easily explained," replied the Carthaginian. "When it was all
  over he turned to one of the senators, who is supposed to favour
  peace&mdash;he had compelled the man to come with him&mdash;and said: 'We
  have heard the last of capitulation, I fancy, for some time. What terms do
  you think your dear Scipio will be disposed to give you after this?' And now
  about your prisoner. I have come straight to warn you. We must think what is
  to be done. One thing, of course, is certain&mdash;you can't keep him here.
  Some bird of the air would carry the matter. Hasdrubal, too, has his spies
  everywhere, and knows everything, and you would hardly like to give him up.
  He seemed a nice young fellow."</p>

  <p>"Give him up!" cried Cleanor&mdash;"certainly not. I should deserve to be
  crucified myself if I did."</p>

  <p>"You might tell him what has happened, and put him in the way of taking
  the matter into his own hands. The Romans seem never to trouble much about
  killing themselves."</p>

  <p>"That seems but a mean way of getting out of the difficulty. The man is my
  guest. I have eaten and drunk with him. He shan't be harmed, if I can help
  it. I don't love the Romans, but I could not behave so to the very worst of
  them, and least of all to a Scipio."</p>

  <p>"But you'll get into very serious trouble yourself."</p>

  <p>"Well, trouble or no trouble, I am determined to save him somehow.
  Meanwhile, many thanks to you for warning me. But there's no good in your
  mixing yourself up in the matter."</p>

  <p>"Good! but mind this, the sooner he is out of the way the better for him,
  if not for you. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the young Roman, when his captor returned, "this is a very
  pleasant way of being a prisoner, but I suppose it can't last. You must do
  your duty; pray, don't get yourself into trouble on my account."</p>

  <p>Cleanor was in a state of extreme perplexity. To hand over a gallant young
  soldier to a merciless savage such as Hasdrubal was impossible. Yet it seemed
  scarcely dutiful to Carthage to let a valuable prisoner escape; and, again,
  if he could make up his mind to this, how was such an escape to be
  managed?</p>

  <p>"Doing my duty," he said, after a few minutes of silent reflection,
  "happens to be more than usually difficult."</p>

  <p>After another pause he went on, "After all, there is nothing for it but to
  tell you the simple truth. Hasdrubal has put all the prisoners to death, and
  to a horribly cruel death."</p>

  <p>The prisoner grew pale. He was young, and life was dear to him. As a
  Roman, too, he knew the hideous traditions of Carthaginian cruelty. In a few
  moments he had recovered himself and his voice was firm.</p>

  <p>"I can bear," he said, "what my countrymen have borne. Or, if you would
  make me feel that I have been more fortunate than they, give me back my sword
  for a moment."</p>

  <p>"Hasdrubal's deed is a crime," replied the young Greek, "and I will not
  make myself an accomplice in it. Your sword I will certainly give you if I
  can see no other way."</p>

  <p>Again he reflected, then his face lighted up. He had thought of a way of
  escape out of part at least of his difficulty.</p>

  <p>"There is another way, and I will ask you to follow it without any
  questioning. I will certainly not give you up to Hasdrubal, nor will I suffer
  you to give up your life for mine. Your sacrifice, too, would be useless.
  Hasdrubal will say, if he should come to know about you, that he wanted you
  alive, not dead, and will be as furious with me for letting you kill yourself
  as for letting you escape. So put that thought out of your mind. Now about
  escape; I have had half a hundred plans in my mind during the last half-hour,
  but the best, I might say the only one, seems to be this. All Carthage is
  hard at work on some ramparts of earth that are being made in the rear of the
  south wall, just where the ground dips a little. Men of all ranks are working
  at them, and even women and children. All are volunteers, no wages are given,
  and no questions are asked. You can't miss the place, for there is a steady
  stream of people going backwards and forwards to it. Most of the men wear a
  rough sort of workman's tunic. I can give you one, and I can furnish you with
  a spade. Work on there till it is dark. No one will think it strange, for
  people who are employed in the day often give two or three hours to work at
  the ramparts in the night. Then you must take your chance. Bide your time,
  and drop quietly down from the wall. One thing remember: don't on any account
  open your mouth. If anyone speaks to you, pretend to be dumb or that you
  don't understand. And there is one thing more which I ask, not because I
  think it necessary, but because I shall be able to answer for you better:
  swear by the oath that in your country you think most binding, that you will
  give to the besiegers no information as to what you have seen in the
  city."</p>

  <p>The young man swore by Jupiter and the household gods of his own family
  that he would be absolutely silent on all that he had seen or heard. Shortly
  afterwards, equipped as Cleanor had described, he took his way to the
  earthworks. It is needless to say anything more than that, after night-fall,
  he easily made his escape.</p>

  <p>When the day came to an end without any inquiry being made for the
  prisoner, Cleanor began to hope that the whole affair might escape notice.
  Just before midnight, however, he received a visit from his Carthaginian
  friend. "I have only a few moments," said the young man. "First, as to the
  prisoner&mdash;what have you done with him? where is he?"</p>

  <p>"In the Roman camp by this time, I hope," replied Cleanor; and proceeded
  briefly to describe what he had done.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the other, "as nothing has been seen or heard of him, he has
  probably made his escape; and a very lucky thing for him! But now about
  yourself. Hasdrubal knows, or will know to-morrow morning. One of the
  soldiers who was with us gave information. I will be even with him some day,
  the mercenary scoundrel! Happily, the chief was too tipsy to understand what
  was being told him. But he will be sober to-morrow morning, and then look out
  for yourself. But what do you mean to do?"</p>

  <p>"Do?" replied Cleanor, "nothing, except tell him the truth."</p>

  <p>"Well, you don't want for courage. But remember, he is the most merciless
  brute on earth. Don't flatter yourself that you will find him anything
  else."</p>

  <p>"I have made up my mind. Let him do his worst. But a thousand thanks to
  you!"</p>

  <p>"I wish we had a thousand men such as he in Carthage," muttered the young
  officer to himself as he went away&mdash;"as gentle as he is brave, whereas
  our people's fancy is to be cruel and cowardly."</p>

  <p>Early on the following morning an orderly made his appearance at Cleanor's
  quarters. "The general understands," he said, "that you have a prisoner in
  your hands. You are to deliver him up."</p>

  <p>Cleanor did not feel himself bound to make any explanation to an orderly,
  and simply replied that he had no prisoner in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Then," said the man, "I am instructed to search your quarters."</p>

  <p>"Search, but you will find nothing."</p>

  <p>The man searched and went away. An hour or so afterwards he reappeared,
  this time with a guard of four soldiers. He had instructions, he said, to
  arrest Cleanor, son of Lysis, an officer of the guards of the south-west wall
  Cleanor surrendered himself without a word, and was at once marched to
  head-quarters. On his arrival he was handcuffed. Hasdrubal, who had never
  possessed much personal courage, was accustomed to take this precaution when
  any prisoner was brought into his presence.</p>

  <p>"I have it on good authority," said the general, when Cleanor stood before
  him, "that you had a Roman prisoner in your hands on the night of the day
  before last. Why did you not deliver him up at once to the proper
  authorities?"</p>

  <p>"Because he was ill. If this was irregular, I acknowledge my fault."</p>

  <p>"Let that pass, then. Where is he now? How was it you suffered him to
  escape?"</p>

  <p>"I did not suffer him to escape; I took care that he should escape."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried the general in a furious voice&mdash;so far he had succeeded
  in keeping calm&mdash;"what! you deliberately let him go! This is sheer
  treason! What have you to say?"</p>

  <p>"I could not let him be dealt with as the others were dealt with. To have
  given him up after that would have been a crime."</p>

  <p>"What audacity! Who are you, paltry Greek that you are, to make yourself a
  ruler and a judge in Carthage? That is enough. It is your life for his life.
  Take him away!" he roared to the guards who had the prisoner in their
  charge.</p>

  <p>Cleanor was taken back to the guard-room, and shortly afterwards
  transferred from that to a cell in the basement of the house, a squalid,
  stifling, ill-smelling place, dimly lighted by a strongly-barred aperture in
  the roof. Here he spent five days. Every morning his jailer opened the door
  just long enough to put within it a loaf of coarse rye-bread and a flagon of
  doubtful-looking water. He saw and heard nothing more during the day.</p>

  <p>On the sixth day he was again brought before Hasdrubal. The general was,
  or seemed to be, in a different mood. He affected to be much disturbed at the
  prisoner's squalid appearance, inquired how he had been treated, and when he
  heard the details declared that his orders had been entirely misunderstood.
  Cleanor knew exactly how much value was to be attached to these
  protestations, but prudently kept his counsel and thanked the general for his
  kind intentions.</p>

  <p>"I have been wishing," Hasdrubal continued, "to have some conversation
  about a matter in which you might be very useful to Carthage, but you are
  really not fit for it. Let me at all events do what I can to repair this
  deplorable mistake."</p>

  <p>He whispered some instructions to an attendant, and Cleanor was ushered
  out of the room, being treated with a politeness which was in strong contrast
  to the rude handling which he had received on the former occasion. He was
  provided with a bath and a change of clothes, and afterwards sat down to an
  excellent meal.</p>

  <p>Later on in the day he was again summoned into the general's presence. "I
  cannot but think," said Hasdrubal, "that you were wrong in the matter of the
  prisoner, but you meant well; yes, you meant well, and it may turn out for
  the best after all. The prisoner who escaped was a Scipio, was he not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the Greek, "he was a Scipio."</p>

  <p>"The Scipios will feel that they owe you something for what you have done.
  Does not that seem to give you an opening?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," replied Cleanor, though he had little doubt, as a
  matter of fact, what it was that the general wanted.</p>

  <p>"There are some things," continued Hasdrubal after a pause, "which I
  should much like to know, and I would gladly give ten talents to the man who
  would find them out for me."</p>

  <p>"To put it plainly," said Cleanor, "you want me to go as a spy?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Hasdrubal, "if you choose to put it so&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"I cannot do it," said Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"I know that it is a dangerous bit of work; a spy gets no mercy. But then,
  think&mdash;I won't say, of the reward, for I believe that you think little
  of that&mdash;think of the service you may be doing to Carthage."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that I refuse to be a spy. A spy's work, I take it, is as lawful
  and honest as any other. But I am not going to trade on what I did for that
  young man. That would be base."</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal checked himself with some difficulty. He could see that the
  young Greek was not one to be bullied into compliance; but he did not give up
  the hope of persuading him.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he said after a pause, "we must talk of this again. Perhaps
  we may find some way for you to help us without offending your conscience.
  Farewell for the present; and believe me that I am deeply concerned that you
  should have been put to inconvenience. It shall not happen again."</p>

  <p>Cleanor found his quarters and his fare changed very much for the better.
  He had now an airy little chamber high up in the house, which commanded a
  view of the sea. He received a visit from the general's own physician, a
  countryman of his own, who claimed to be one of the great Æsculapid clan.</p>

  <p>"A little reduced," said the man of science, after feeling his pulse and
  listening to the beats of his heart&mdash;"a little reduced, but that is not
  to be wondered at. I shall not have to exhibit any drug; a generous diet will
  do all that is wanted. And the general gives you the use of his own private
  terrace, so that you will not want for fresh air and exercise."</p>

  <p>Time now passed pleasantly enough with the young man, though it was
  irksome to be shut up in idleness while so much was going on. And there was
  always the anxiety as to what Hasdrubal would do. The tiger was pleased for
  the time to sheath his claws, but the claws were there, and would be shown
  some day. Meanwhile he made the best of his position. The physician paid him
  a daily visit, told him the news of the siege, chatted with him on various
  subjects, played sundry games of draughts or soldiers, and, best of all, lent
  him some books.</p>

  <p>More than once he was summoned to an interview with the general, who,
  however, did not again introduce the subject of the last meeting, but was
  always very communicative and friendly, flattering the young man by referring
  to him sundry military questions, and asking his advice. At the end of a
  fortnight he was unconditionally released, not a little to his surprise. And
  his release was followed by reappointment to his old command.</p>

  <p>He was not long left in ignorance of the causes which had brought about
  this unexpected result. The fact was that pressure, which he did not feel
  able to resist, had been brought to bear upon Hasdrubal. Tyrant and savage as
  he was, he stood in fear of his soldiers, and could not afford to neglect any
  strong feeling that they might show. The Greek contingent among the
  mercenaries was numerous, and constituted the most effective part of the
  force. With many of these men Cleanor was a personal favourite; most of them
  knew him by repute, and had heard with sympathy his melancholy story. Among
  the native Carthaginians also he had not a few well-wishers. Hasdrubal,
  accordingly, was made to understand that if anything should happen to the
  young man, it would be strongly resented. His superior officer gave him an
  outline of these facts, but added, with significant emphasis:</p>

  <p>"Be on your guard with him, though that is easier to say than to do. He
  does not forget or forgive."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16"></a>XVI. &mdash; BAAL HAMMON</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR some time after the events related in the last chapter
  the siege went on without any noticeable incidents. The fighting was nearly
  continuous, but there was nothing like a pitched battle. The besiegers did
  not again attempt an assault, nor did the besieged make a sally in force.
  Scipio's plan was to complete the blockade of the city, and then to await
  events, reserving his attack till famine and disease had exhausted the
  strength of the enemy.</p>

  <p>The first step was to cut off all communication on the land side. Carthage
  stood on a peninsula, and Scipio's superiority in the field made him master
  of the isthmus by which this peninsula was joined to the mainland. This he
  covered from sea to sea by a huge fortification, which served at the same
  time for a camp. It had a ditch and a rampart both on the side that looked
  towards the city, from which it was distant little more than a bow-shot, and
  on that which faced the mainland. It was necessary, indeed, that it should be
  defensible both in the front and in the rear. It was one of the most
  formidable possibilities of the war that the Roman army might be attacked
  from behind by the native allies of Carthage. Scipio knew&mdash;it was a mark
  of his genius that he knew everything&mdash;that the emissaries of the city
  were unceasing in their efforts to raise an army of auxiliaries among the
  native tribes of Northern Africa. The wall had, as usual, towers at intervals
  over its whole length. One of these towers, built in the most solid fashion
  of stone, was carried up to such a height that it commanded a view of all
  that was being done within the city walls.</p>

  <p>Of course the besieged did not allow this work, threatening as it was to
  the very existence of their city, to be carried on without interruption.
  Catapults, posted on the city walls, kept up a continuous discharge of
  missiles; unceasing showers of stones came from the archers and clingers,
  while bodies of infantry were kept in readiness to sally forth whenever and
  wherever they saw an opportunity of doing damage. The Romans had, so to
  speak, to build and dig with a workman's tool in the one hand and a weapon in
  the other, but they stuck to their task with indefatigable zeal and
  inexhaustible courage. The officers shared all the toils and dangers of their
  men, and the work progressed, not indeed without loss, but without
  interruption.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the city was in a state of constantly increasing excitement from
  another cause, not unconnected, however, with the war. The festival of Baal
  Hammon&mdash;otherwise Moloch&mdash;was approaching, and it was to be kept
  with unusual splendour, even, it was said, with rites of worship that had
  fallen into disuse for many years. For Carthage, though it had much of the
  unchanging temper of the East, was not wholly untouched by the spirit of
  progress, and some of the darker and more savage practices of her religion
  were no longer practised. But now again the fiercer instincts of the race
  were waking. It was a common topic of talk in the streets that the desperate
  fortunes of the state called for more effectual methods of propitiating the
  anger of heaven. Meetings of the Senate were held daily with closed doors,
  and it was known, though instant death was the appointed penalty of any
  indiscreet revelation by a senator, that the chief subject of debate was
  settling the details of the great Moloch feast.</p>

  <p>Cleanor, in common with the other Greeks in the population, whether civil
  or military, heard but little of the matter. It was, in a way, kept from them
  by their companions and comrades, who knew that they regarded such
  proceedings without sympathy, not to say, with disgust. In the ordinary
  course the great day would have come and passed without his knowing anything
  about it beyond the fact that it was the chief festival of the Carthaginian
  year. But this was not to be.</p>

  <p>He was returning to his quarters somewhat late in the evening, two days
  before the appointed time, when he felt a hand laid on the sleeve of his
  tunic, and heard himself called by his name in a voice which somehow seemed
  familiar, though he could not immediately connect it with any friend or
  acquaintance. He halted, and turned to the speaker.</p>

  <p>It was a woman, poorly clad as far as he could see in the dim light, and
  of middle age, to judge from what appeared of her veiled and cloaked
  figure.</p>

  <p>"Help, noble Cleanor!"</p>

  <p>That strange faculty of remembering voices that most of us have, strange
  because it is a sheer effort of memory, unhelped by any accessories of shape
  and colour, did not fail him.</p>

  <p>"What! is it you, Theoxena?" he cried.</p>

  <p>Theoxena was his foster-mother, the wife of a poor schoolmaster at Chelys,
  who had been persuaded by her own need and the liberal offers of Cleanor's
  father to undertake the nurture of one of his twin-children. She had been
  resident for some years at Carthage, to which city her husband had migrated,
  tempted by the prospect of more liberal remuneration than he could hope for
  in his native place.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, it is I," said the poor woman in a voice broken with tears.
  "And oh, in such trouble! If you could help me&mdash;but come in here. 'Tis
  but a poor place; but I cannot tell you my story in the street."</p>

  <p>Her home was close at hand, and Cleanor followed her in. A poor place it
  was, but clean and neatly kept, and even with some little marks of taste and
  culture. In one corner of the room stood a capsa, a cylindrical case for
  holding manuscript rolls, and above it, on a bracket fastened into the wall,
  a statuette of Hermes. The chairs were of elegant pattern, though of common
  wood, and the mats on the floor, though worn and shabby, were of artistic
  pattern.</p>

  <p>"Well, Theoxena," he said, "what is the matter? What can I do for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir!" she answered, commanding her voice with an effort, "they have
  stolen from me my little Cephalus, the dearest, brightest little boy that
  ever was, and are going to offer him for a sacrifice to their dreadful
  Hammon."</p>

  <p>"But how do you know? How did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"You shall hear the story from Daphne, who was with him when he was
  stolen."</p>

  <p>"And who is Daphne?" asked Cleanor.</p>

  <p>Daphne, who had been sitting in a small chamber leading out of the main
  room, came forward on hearing her name, holding in her hands a piece of
  tapestry at which she had been working. She was a girl of fourteen or
  thereabouts, not actually beautiful, perhaps, but with a rare promise of
  beauty; her figure had something of the awkwardness of the time which comes
  between childhood and womanhood; her features still wanted that subtle
  moulding which the last critical years of girlhood seem able to give. But her
  eyes, blue as a southern sea with a noonday sun above it, were marvellously
  clear and full of light; her complexion was dazzlingly bright, and all the
  more striking from its contrast to the generally swarthy hue of the
  inhabitants of Carthage. Her hair was of a rich red gold colour, and would
  have been of extraordinary beauty if it had had its natural length. As it
  was, it was cropped almost close, though here and there a little curl of a
  new growth had begun to show itself.</p>

  <p>"This, sir, is my Daphne," said the woman, laying her hand upon the girl's
  head. "We are good patriots, I am sure, for the dear girl gave up her
  beautiful hair&mdash;if you will believe me, it used to come down nearly to
  her ankles&mdash;to be made into a string for a bow. The bow- maker said it
  was the very finest he had had, though all the great ladies in Carthage did
  the same, I am told. Daphne," she went on, "tell the noble Cleanor about our
  darling little Cephalus."</p>

  <p>"Remember," said the young man, who saw that the girl was trembling
  excessively, "remember that the noble Cleanor is your brother, even as
  Theoxena is his mother," and he lifted his foster-mother's hand to his lips
  and respectfully kissed it.</p>

  <p>The girl began her story: "I took my little brother to walk in the
  garden&mdash;the garden, I mean, of Mago the senator, who kindly lets us use
  it, because the streets are so noisy and crowded, and the people are so
  rude." Cleanor did not wonder that she attracted more notice than she liked.
  "There is seldom anybody there; but that day there was an old man who began
  to pet dear little Cephalus, and give him sweetmeats and cakes. He seemed
  very kind, and I never dreamt of any harm; and besides, I was there, for I
  never leave Cephalus alone. Ah! but I did leave him alone that morning,
  wicked girl that I am." And she burst into a flood of tears. "But then what
  could I do? Hylax&mdash;that is the puppy that Cephalus is so fond
  of&mdash;began to fight with another dog, and Cephalus was frightened, and
  said, 'He'll be killed! he'll be killed! Do save him, Daphne.' He would
  himself have run to help, but I was afraid he would be bitten, though that
  would have been better than what did happen. So I told him to sit still where
  he was, and I ran to help Hylax. It took me a long time to get hold of him,
  for he was very angry, and would go on fighting though the other dog was much
  bigger. And when I looked round, the dear little boy was gone. I hunted all
  over the garden, and called him a hundred times, but it was no use. Mother
  hasn't blamed me once, but I can't help feeling that it was any fault."</p>

  <p>"But what," asked Cleanor, speaking to Theoxena, "has put this dreadful
  idea of Hammon into your head?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I know from what my neighbours have told me that there is going to be
  a sacrifice such as there has not been for years and years, and that a number
  of children are to be put into the fire. The priests say that there must be a
  hundred, not one less. Some parents offered their own children&mdash;to think
  that anybody could be so wicked!&mdash;and these quite rich and noble people,
  I am told; but still there were not enough, so others had to be taken by
  force. Besides, the priests said that there must be children of every race
  that was in Carthage; and no Greek children could be got except by kidnapping
  them. And there was something, too, which Daphne did not tell you. She picked
  up a button where the old man had been sitting, and I have been told by
  someone who knows that it is of a kind that only the temple servants of
  Hammon use."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Cleanor; "there seems very little doubt that it is so. But
  don't trouble; you shall have your son again. I have a hundred things to ask
  you, but that must be for another day; there is no time to be lost now.
  Farewell!"</p>

  <p>The young man had spoken confidently enough to the agonized mother, but
  when he came to reflect on what he had to do he did not feel by any means
  confident. All night he was busy with the problem, but seemed, when the
  morning came, as far off a solution as ever. He could not even think where to
  go for counsel and help. His Greek comrades would feel with him, but they
  probably knew no more about the matter than he did. As to his Carthaginian
  fellow-officers, though he was on the best of terms with them, it was quite
  useless, and indeed impossible, to approach them. At last an idea occurred to
  him. The Greek physician who had attended him when he was in Hasdrubal's
  house might possibly be not only willing, but able to help him. Willing he
  would certainly be, for he was a Greek; able, possibly, seeing that his
  practice lay largely among Carthaginians of the highest class.</p>

  <p>He lost no time in looking for his friend, and was luckily soon successful
  in his search.</p>

  <p>"I am not surprised," said the physician when he had heard the story. "I
  knew that something of the kind was going on, though the priests keep it as
  quiet as they can. I was called in yesterday to see the wife of a senator.
  She was in a state of prostration, for which I could see no physical cause.
  Of course I diagnosed mental trouble, and put some questions in that
  direction. I got nothing but the vaguest answers. Just when I was going away
  I asked some question about her children. She said nothing, but the next
  moment she fell into the very worst fit of hysterics I have ever seen. I put
  two and two together, for I haven't been a doctor for forty years for
  nothing, and guessed the truth. And afterwards, when I was giving the maid in
  attendance some directions, I heard it for certain. The poor woman had given
  up her eldest boy, a beautiful little creature of six, to Moloch. And now
  about this Greek child. Well, we must not be seen on the street talking
  together. Come to my house about noon to-morrow, and we will talk it
  over."</p>

  <p>Cleanor was punctual at the appointed time.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking it over," said the physician when he had satisfied
  himself that he could not be overheard. "And I don't see any chance of
  success except by bribery. I know where the child is in the high- priest's
  house. I was called in two or three days ago to see a child who was ill
  there. I thought it strange, for the priests have no families. Still, it
  might be a child of a relative. But it was stranger still when, after I had
  prescribed for the little fellow and was going away, I heard the voices of
  other children. Then it was all explained little creatures, when they have
  got them by persuasion or force, in the high-priest's house. That is one
  step, then. We know where the boy is. And the next, by great good luck, is
  made easy for us. The little fellow that I have been attending will certainly
  die. I feel almost sure that I shall not find him alive when I go this
  afternoon. Well, I shall have to report his death to the high-priest, who
  will have to find a substitute for him, and will, I suppose, kidnap another
  child. That is a horrible thing; but we can't help it. Now for my plan. You
  must bribe the attendant who will have to remove the child and see to its
  burial. That will be easy enough. He is a fellow of the lowest class, and
  will do anything for a score of gold pieces. And you must also bribe the
  priest who has the business of actually offering the children. That will be a
  more serious matter. The practice is for the high-priest to offer the first,
  and to hand over the rest to a subordinate. This is the man you will have to
  deal with. It isn't that it will be a matter of' faith with him. Generally,
  in my experience&mdash;not always, mark that&mdash;but generally the nearer
  the altar the less the faith; and this man I know. But it is a dangerous
  affair, and, besides, the man can make his own terms. I should say that a
  hundred gold pieces will be wanted. Now, can you manage that? It isn't every
  young officer that has a hundred gold pieces to spare. I can help you a
  little, but a physician's fees are small and hard to come by."</p>

  <p>"A thousand thanks!" said Cleanor, "but I have as much as will be
  wanted."</p>

  <p>"Come again after dark," the physician went on. "You will have to settle
  with the men, for I must not appear in the matter, but I will arrange a way
  for you to see them."</p>

  <p>"Everything is going as well as possible," said the physician when the two
  met again. "As I expected, the child was dead. And here I have made a little
  change in our plans. I thought that it might make complications if two were
  engaged in the affair. And the priest might object if he found his secret
  shared by an attendant of far inferior rank. It might mean, he would say,
  endless blackmailing. What I did, then, was to tell the man that there was
  something very strange about the child's illness, that I wanted to discover
  the real cause, and that I would give him a couple of gold pieces&mdash;to
  offer him more would have been suspicious&mdash;if he would let me have the
  body. That is disposed of, then. Now for the priest. He comes here to-night;
  he has long been a patient of mine, and he wants to see me. The fellow, who
  is one of the hardest drinkers in Carthage, would have been dead long ago but
  for me. You will see him, and tell him what he is to do, which, in a word, is
  to put a dead child for a living one, and what you will give him for doing
  it. That is the naked truth, but you will wrap it up as you think best."</p>

  <p>"But will not that be an impossible thing&mdash;a dead child for a
  living?" asked Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied the physician, "and not by any means so hard as you
  think. You don't know, I daresay, that the children are drugged as heavily as
  possible without making them actually insensible. All the creatures that are
  brought to be sacrificed have to be drugged. You know that it is thought to
  be the very worst omen if a bull or a ram breaks away from the attendants as
  they are bringing it to the altar. You don't suppose that there is a miracle
  perpetually worked so that what happens every day in the slaughter-house
  never happens in a temple? And this makes the affair comparatively easy.
  There is not much difference between a drugged child and a dead child."</p>

  <p>The priest came in due course. The physician with some cautious hints
  excited his curiosity and greed, and Cleanor found his task neither so
  difficult nor so costly as he had anticipated. It is needless to relate the
  negotiations. As the physician had anticipated, the priest's faith was not a
  difficulty. He had not a vestige of belief. He had been a party to too many
  impostures to have anything of the kind left. Fraudulent miracles were a part
  almost, it might be said, of his daily business. But he made the most of the
  risk of the proceeding, and this was undoubtedly great. Not only was the dead
  child to be substituted for the living, but the living was to be smuggled
  away. The physician had provided a temporary refuge for it; it was to be
  received into the family of the couple which kept his house. The thing
  probably appeared to be more difficult than it really was, chiefly because no
  one would have any idea that it would be attempted. A bargain was ultimately
  made for a somewhat smaller sum than the physician had named. The priest was
  to receive five-and-twenty gold pieces down, and fifty pieces more when
  Cleanor was satisfied of the safety of the child.</p>

  <p>Cleanor was long in doubt whether or not he should be present at the
  hideous ceremony of the coming day. All the instincts of his own nature and
  his race revolted against such doings. The Greek temper was not particularly
  merciful, and certainly never shrank from taking life when occasions of
  policy or promptings of revenge seemed to suggest it, but it had no liking
  for spectacles of blood. Even in its degradation it revolted from the savage
  amusements which fascinated the Romans. And Cleanor had the best feelings of
  his race in high development. On the other hand, he reflected that if any
  chance suspicion should arise his presence might help to disarm it. Above
  all, his interest in the fate of his little foster-brother was so
  overpowering that he felt it impossible to keep away.</p>

  <p>The solemnities of the day began with a great procession, in which the
  inferior deities of the Carthaginian faith were carried to pay their homage,
  as it was said, to Baal Hammon their chief. Each had his own company of
  priests and temple attendants; both the deity and his satellites were decked
  out for the occasion with all the splendours which the temple
  treasuries&mdash;most of them rich with the accumulation of
  centuries&mdash;could furnish.</p>

  <p>First,&mdash;for it was right that the most dignified visitor should be
  the first to arrive,&mdash;came <i>Melcart</i>, Hammon's vicegerent, as he
  might be called, who had under his special protection the daughter cities of
  the Phoenician race, as he had the great mother-city of Tyre. The god was not
  represented by any human figure, but a great sun, with gilded rays, was borne
  under a canopy of rich purple curtains. Next to <i>Melcart</i> came Tanit or
  Astarte, symbolized by a similar image of the moon, but smaller, and with
  silver rays; and after Tanit again, Dagon, the fish-god, the special
  protector of the fleets of Carthage, held in less reverence since the eldest
  daughter of Tyre had lost the hereditary supremacy of the seas. These were
  the three great dignitaries of the procession; after them followed a crowd of
  inferior powers with figures of man or brute, always heavy with gold or
  sparkling with gems, but grotesque or even hideous in shape, for the
  Ph&oelig;nician craftsman made no effort to emulate the grace of his Greek
  rival.</p>

  <p>Hammon's temple was thronged, and indeed had been thronged from the hour
  of dawn, when its gates were thrown open, with an excited multitude. A lane,
  however, was kept clear in the middle by two ranks of stalwart guards, native
  Carthaginians, all of them splendid in gilded helmets, with nodding plumes of
  the African ostrich, and armour of shining steel, with short purple cloaks
  over their shoulders. This lane was left for the approach of the divine
  visitors. As the first of these drew near, the great doors, themselves
  covered with a scarlet curtain, that separated the sanctuary from the body of
  the temple, were thrown back, and the holy place became visible, to most of
  those present that day for the first time in their lives.</p>

  <p>In the centre of a semicircular recess at the further end, on a throne of
  gold, approached by twelve steps, each flanked by the image of a lion, sat
  the colossal statue of Hammon. The canopy above it was formed by the meeting
  wings of two stooping figures. The image was made of some black stone,
  probably basalt, carved into a rude similitude of the human figure, with arms
  of steel which extended forwards. In front, so close to the image as to be
  partly under the arms, was an opening six feet wide, from which, now and
  then, a slender tongue of coloured flame might be seen to shoot forth.</p>

  <p>When the opened doors revealed the image, an instantaneous silence fell
  upon the assembled multitude, in striking contrast to the babel of sounds
  which had filled the temple a minute before. The awful moment had come, and
  the multitude waited with mingled wonder and terror for what was to
  follow.</p>

  <p>The silence was first broken by the voice of the high-priest as he began
  to chant the litany of supplication. It was heard plainly enough, but few
  understood it, for the form had not been changed from the earliest times, and
  the language was mostly obsolete. At certain intervals the voices of the
  inferior priests might be heard coming in with the refrain. The ancient
  formula ended, the high-priest added special supplications for the day. He
  invoked blessings on Carthage, on her armies, her fleets, her priests, and
  her people. He cursed her enemies, Rome first of all, with special mention of
  the name of Scipio. The supplications ended, the high- priest turned to the
  people, crying, "Sons of Carthage, offer with a willing heart, and of your
  best, to your Lord and Saviour Hammon!"</p>

  <p>There was a momentary pause. Then the Shophetim descended from the seats
  on which they had been sitting, and, coming forward, cast gold and spices
  into the opening. No one imitated, or was expected to imitate them. They
  represented the people, and their gifts symbolized the offering of the
  people's wealth. The more solemn part of the sacrifice remained to be
  performed, and this part, for evident reasons, the priests retained in their
  own hands.</p>

  <p>The high-priest began again:</p>

  <p>"O Baal Hammon, we have given-thee the most precious of things without
  life; now we give thee flesh of our flesh, and life of our life."</p>

  <p>So saying, he took from the hands of a subordinate priest
  something&mdash;what it was no one could discern&mdash;wrapped in white
  linen, and placed it on the outstretched arms of the colossus. The image,
  worked by concealed machinery from behind, bowed its head, and at the same
  time lowered its arms, dropping the burden that had been placed upon them
  into the chasm underneath. Something between a roar and a shriek went up from
  the multitude that filled the temple. There was the joy of seeing that the
  great Hammon accepted their offering; there was the horror&mdash;for even the
  Carthaginians were human&mdash;of knowing what the offering was. The next
  instant a loud crash of sound came from the cymbal-players, who had been
  stationed in a recess out of sight of the multitude. Every time another
  burden was placed on the arms and dropped into the chasm there was the same
  outburst of wild music.</p>

  <p>Cleanor watched the horrible ceremony with intense attention. Now and then
  he fancied&mdash;he had found a place, it should be said, not far from the
  sanctuary&mdash;that he saw a movement, and even heard a cry. But he could
  not feel certain. He recognized the priest who handed the first child to the
  high-priest, and who placed the others on the arms of the image, as the man
  with whom he had negotiated, and he felt sure that on one occasion he made a
  slight gesture, which no one else would notice, in his direction. It was a
  great relief when the horrible rite was finished. As to the fate of the child
  he could not immediately satisfy himself. It would have been imprudent to
  make any inquiries. He had, however, the satisfaction of receiving, during
  the course of the next day, a message from his friend the physician that the
  boy was safe. The same comforting intelligence was conveyed to the mother.
  She, of course, had to be content with an occasional sight of her child, and
  the hope of regaining him at some happier time.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17"></a>XVII. &mdash; MOVE AND COUNTERMOVE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE great festival of Hammon, with all its lurid splendours,
  did not fail to produce something at least of the effect which the
  authorities had expected from it. The flagging zeal of the Carthaginian
  people regained its old energy; the hope that their country might yet be
  saved to them, a hope almost abandoned during the last few months, began to
  revive. Hammon, they thought, must be propitiated by a piety so devoted, must
  interfere to save so dutiful a city.</p>

  <p>There was, indeed, need of all the encouragement that could be had, for
  the situation of the civil population of Carthage was precarious in the
  extreme. The Senate had not neglected to lay up in the time of peace such
  provisions for the war that they knew to be impending as it had been possible
  to collect. But the work had had to be done almost by stealth. Rome had
  watched with suspicion anything that looked like preparations for war, and
  had remonstrated more than once against the purchase of unnecessary stores.
  What was done in this way had to be done without the knowledge of her
  regularly appointed agents and of residents who were secretly in her pay.
  Something had been accomplished; the garrison had ample supplies; the houses
  of the upper class were, for the most part, well furnished. But the poor, who
  had no room for stores in their dwellings, even if they had the means to
  purchase them in advance, were dangerously near to want. It is for the needs
  of this class that public provision has to be made in any city that expects
  to be besieged, and it was in respect of this public provision that the
  action of the Carthaginian government had been hampered.</p>

  <p>Things had grown rapidly worse since the building of the walled camp
  across the isthmus. Nothing could now be brought into the besieged city by
  land. The sea was still partly open. The Roman fleet kept up a blockade, but
  it was not really effective. As soon as the wind began to blow from the sea
  the war-ships had to stand off from the shore, and the blockade- runners had
  their opportunity. Prices ruled so high in the city that a trader who
  contrived to take safely to its destination one cargo out of two made a very
  handsome profit.</p>

  <p>All the fishing population of the African coast for a hundred miles on
  either side of the besieged city was busily employed in the traffic. Light
  vessels drawing but little water were chiefly used, for they could be safely
  navigated in places where a war-ship would inevitably have grounded. So
  rudely and cheaply were they built that the loss, if they were wrecked, was
  insignificant. The great difficulty was the weather; if this continued to be
  fine for ten days together, a large part of the besieged population came
  within an easily measurable distance of starvation.</p>

  <p>Scipio now resolved on making a great countermove&mdash;he would block up
  the approach to the harbour. He had, in fact, for some time past foreseen the
  necessity of taking this step, and had prepared a vast amount of material for
  the work, employing great numbers of the native population in quarrying stone
  and cutting timber. So much had been accomplished in this way that when the
  time came for executing the work little more than the actual construction
  remained to be done. This was not so difficult as it had seemed. The harbour
  mouth was not very far from the shore occupied by the Romans.</p>

  <p>The first thing was to lay a foundation for the mole that it was proposed
  to build. This was done by sinking huge blocks of roughly-hewn stone, chiefly
  during moonless nights. During this stage of the work the besieged took
  little heed of what was going on, or, anyhow, took no pains to interrupt or
  hinder it. There was a suspicion, and more than a suspicion, of Scipio's
  purpose, but Hasdrubal, himself indolent and incompetent, haughtily refused
  to listen to any suggestion from his subordinates. But even Hasdrubal was
  roused when the structure reached the surface of the water. What he saw was a
  mole, more than thirty yards broad, stretching across the mouth of the
  harbour, and shutting off every channel available even for the smallest
  craft.</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal now developed, or accepted, a plan which for a time at least was
  a virtual check to Scipio's move. He kept up a brisk discharge of missiles on
  the men employed in building the mole. So sharp and continuous was it that
  the besiegers had little attention to give to what was being done on the
  opposite side of the harbour. It was a surprise, and a very unwelcome
  surprise to them, that no sooner had they stopped up one mouth of the
  harbour, than they found that another exit had been created. The whole
  population, every man, woman, and child in the city, that could ply a spade
  or a pick, wheel a barrow-load or carry a basket of earth, had been working
  night and day at excavating another mouth to the harbour.</p>

  <p>Nor was this all; a still greater surprise, so great, indeed, as to be
  almost overwhelming, remained behind.</p>

  <p>One of the conditions of the peace granted to Carthage after the fatal
  defeat of Zama had been the surrender of all the ships of war but twenty. In
  a way this condition had been observed. There had never been more than twenty
  ships in commission at one time; but the old hulks had not always been
  destroyed. At first they had been kept to serve various purposes; latterly,
  as another war began to loom in the future, they had been preserved with the
  intention of using them again. A number of merchant vessels also were
  furnished with crews and an armament that was at least passably
  effective.</p>

  <p>And, marvellous to relate, all this had been done without the knowledge of
  the besiegers. There was a constant flow of deserters from the city,
  increasing as time went on and the prospects of Carthage became less and less
  hopeful. Yet none of them had any definite information to give. That
  something was going on they knew; they had heard for some time a great sound
  of hammering&mdash;that, indeed, had been audible in the Roman camp when the
  wind blew from the dockyard&mdash;but the restrictions on admission to the
  arsenals had been rigidly enforced. So there ended the information which they
  were able to give.</p>

  <p>Nothing, then, could have exceeded the astonishment of the besiegers when
  a new fleet, the existence of which no one had suspected, issued from a
  harbour mouth which no one had ever seen. A thin bank of earth had been kept
  to the last, so that to observers from outside, as also to the Roman ships as
  they cruised backwards and forwards along the coast, nothing appeared to have
  been changed. When everything else was ready, all the available labour in
  Carthage was set to work to clear this bank away. The task was finished by
  dawn. At sunrise the new fleet, magnificently equipped, for there had been a
  lavish expenditure on the ornament as well as the armament of the ships,
  sailed out of the harbour by its new exit.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for Carthage there was no one to make the most of the
  opportunity. A vigorous attack on the Roman fleet&mdash;scattered as it was,
  and altogether unprepared for action, some of the ships being under repair,
  and nearly all of them but half-manned, their crews being largely employed on
  shore&mdash;might have been successful, and have even postponed the fate of
  Carthage. But it was not to be. Hasdrubal, self- opinionated and incapable,
  paralysed everything and everybody. The fleet paraded for a while along the
  coast, and had the barren honour of holding without dispute, for that day at
  least, the possession of the sea.</p>

  <p>"The crews must be exercised first," said Hasdrubal, who was on board what
  we may call the flag-ship, to the veteran who directed its navigation; "but
  in a few days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's no exercise like fighting," growled the old man as he turned
  away.</p>

  <p>And this was the common opinion of Carthage. So strong and so general was
  it, and so vigorously expressed, that Hasdrubal could not afford to disregard
  it. Word was passed round to the captains that they must be ready to engage
  the next day. In the morning, accordingly, the fleet sailed out again. Every
  one was in high spirits, for it is an immense relief for those who have been
  long cooped up within walls, occupied with the tedious task of a protracted
  defence, to renew the more adventurous and interesting experience of attack.
  Some victories were won. One of the Carthaginian ships contrived to ram two
  antagonists in rapid succession. This vessel was a present to the state by
  one of the merchant companies, and no expense had been spared in making it of
  the strongest build and furnishing it with an effective crew of freeborn,
  well-paid rowers. Another captured one of the Roman ships by boarding.
  Cleanor was serving in this, and, owing to the death of one and the
  disablement of the other of his superior officers, had the unexpected honour
  of leading the boarders. There was a sharp struggle, but ultimately the Roman
  crew was overpowered and compelled to surrender.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there were counterbalancing, or almost counterbalancing
  losses, for towards the end of the day the Romans had recovered from their
  surprise, and more than held their own.</p>

  <p>Scipio was everywhere, conspicuous in the scarlet cloak of the
  general-in-command. Once as he passed he was well within a javelin-throw of
  our hero. Cleanor, as he doubted whether he ought not to do his best to rid
  Carthage of a formidable enemy, fancied that he saw a smile of recognition on
  his face. When it grew dark, the struggle was suspended by mutual
  consent.</p>

  <p>The next morning it was renewed. This time fortune declared itself
  unequivocally against Carthage. It was not that there was any marked
  falling-off in the efficiency or courage of the crews. It was the ships
  themselves that began to fail. Many, as has been said, were old hulks patched
  up to serve again. Two days of incessant use, with occasional collisions with
  friends and enemies, had not improved them. The seams began to open and old
  leaks to show themselves, so that by noon at least a score were more or less
  water-logged. Those that had suffered most, about half the number, fell into
  the hands of the enemy. Five other ships were sunk.</p>

  <p>The Roman loss was less than half of this amount. It was not a crushing
  defeat, but it was sufficient to show that Carthage could not hope for
  deliverance from her fleet. Still, some advantage remained to the besieged.
  It would be impossible to close up the new mouth of the harbour, so deep was
  the water into which it opened. On this side, therefore, the Roman blockade
  could never be made complete. Notwithstanding this gain, the whole result was
  a heavy discouragement.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; HELP FROM THE HILLS</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE day shortly after the events related in my last chapter,
  Cleanor's somewhat melancholy musings on the prospects of the future were
  interrupted by the arrival of his friend Gisco, who had been absent from his
  duty for several weeks.</p>

  <p>"You have been wondering, I dare say," said the Carthaginian, "what has
  become of me the last month or so."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed," replied Cleanor; "I asked the officers of your battalion
  about you, but could find out nothing. However, I noticed once or twice just
  a suspicion of hesitation in their answers, and so I came to the conclusion
  that there was a secret."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Gisco, "there was what you may call a secret. Anyhow, we
  thought it best not to say anything about the business I had on hand. It was
  to be a little surprise to our friends outside, and that is not so easy to
  manage as things are now. There is very little that goes on in Carthage but
  is</p>

  <p>known the next day in Scipio's tent. This time, however, we have managed,
  I hope, better."</p>

  <p>"Is it a secret still?" asked Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"No, no," said Gisco, "everyone may know it now, and, besides, you are not
  one of those that a man has to keep secrets from. But now for my story. I
  left Carthage just thirty days ago&mdash;it was, I remember, the day before
  the new moon. It was no easy matter, I can tell you, to get away. One of the
  Roman sentinels caught sight of me, and I had to take to the lagoon. Happily
  the water was deep enough for diving, and I am a good hand at that business,
  but when I came up to breathe I was all but hit by an arrow. However, I got
  safely to the place I was bound for. There Bithyas met me&mdash;Bithyas, you
  remember, was Gulussa's master of the horse&mdash;with two or three troopers
  and a spare horse for me. Our errand was to go to the tribes that live far up
  in the country, and gather recruits for a campaign against Rome. Bithyas, who
  knows the whole region and the tribes better than any man living, was to
  introduce me, and I was to make engagements on the part of Carthage. We
  carried with us a sort of talisman which Bithyas had got hold of, I don't
  exactly know how. Anyhow, it seemed to be respected everywhere, and as soon
  as it was produced we never failed to get a hearing, and we must have gone to
  not less than fifteen chiefs."</p>

  <p>"You say a 'hearing'," Cleanor put in; "but how did you contrive to make
  yourselves understood?"</p>

  <p>"Well, in this way. We took new interpreters when they were wanted. We
  found that a man could always make himself understood by the people of the
  next tribe. Sometimes the same man served for two or three. When he came to
  the last place where he could be of use, he picked out some likely man, and
  instructed him in what he was to say. This, after all, was very simple. It
  was chiefly that they were wanted to fight, and that a chief was to get so
  many gold pieces, an under-chief so many, and a common man so many. It does
  not take much talking to explain so much. It might almost be done by signs.
  Of course we could not carry the money about with us, but we made a present
  to each of the chiefs, and commonly, when the tribe was a strong one, to one
  or more of the sub-chiefs. Promises, you may be sure, we did not spare. Even
  if all goes well, I don't see how Carthage is ever to pay her debts."</p>

  <p>"And did you have much success?" inquired Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we had," replied Gisco. "If all the promises that were made to us
  are kept, we shall have a hundred thousand men. But that is, of course, too
  much to expect. If three-fourths, or even a half, let us say, are put into
  the field, it will be a very great thing, and with what we can do to help by
  a sortie from the city, we ought to give a good account of the Romans."</p>

  <p>"And how soon is this to be?"</p>

  <p>"Very soon now; the tribes were beginning to move when we left to return.
  It took us ten days' hard riding to get back from the last settlement that we
  visited. They can't come as quickly as that, but they don't linger on the
  march. Remember that they are all horsemen, though, when it comes to a
  battle, some of them dismount."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cleanor, "you have been into a new country. Did you see
  anything strange? There are marvellous tales told about these regions and the
  people who live in them. What has your experience been?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Gisco, "I saw some very curious things. And as to the
  things I heard, and heard too from people who swore that they had seen them
  with their own eyes, they pass all belief. I never saw such trees as there
  are on the lower slopes of the hills. You know those tables made of one piece
  of wood? Well, they come from that region. I saw some that were being sawn
  off, and others that were being polished. Then the vines were enormously
  large. I came across some with stems as big as an ordinary- sized column of a
  temple, and I heard of others&mdash;one never sees things quite as wonderful
  as one hears of&mdash;that two men could hardly encompass with their arms. I
  saw crocodiles, just like those one has heard of in the Nile, and I was told
  of leeches that were ten feet long&mdash;that is pretty good, but then the
  ear can take in more than the eye. In one place that we came to there was a
  whole colony of monkeys, just like so many men and women, mothers nursing
  their children, and old ones with white heads, some chattering peaceably
  together like friends, and some quarrelling ever so fiercely. As for lions,
  there were troops of them. Hardly a night passed without an alarm, and though
  we picketed our horses close to our tents, we had several carried off at
  night."</p>

  <p>"And what," asked Cleanor, "do you think of these people as soldiers?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Gisco, "I can hardly judge. They are marvellously good
  horsemen, and have their animals trained to obey them in a most wonderful
  way. A man may leave his horse standing, not tethered, you understand, as
  long as he chooses, and when he is riding on one, he will have another
  following him like a dog. But whether they will be able to stand against the
  Romans is another matter. If it were not for their numbers, I should not
  expect much. But with four or five to one they must do something; let them
  only go on charging, and they must break the line at last."</p>

  <p>As Gisco had predicted, the native forces did not linger on the march.
  They had none of the impedimenta of an army, carrying only their arms and
  their food,&mdash;of this last but a few days' supply,&mdash;and they were
  all mounted. On the third day after the conversation related above their
  advanced guard could be seen on the summit of the hills which formed the
  sky-line to the south. It had been arranged that they should make their way
  to the rock-fortress of Nepheris, now almost the only place, some remote
  spots in the hills excepted, which Carthage still possessed outside its own
  city walls. Nepheris was held by a strong garrison of mercenaries, under the
  command of a skilful soldier, Diogenes by name. Scipio had never been able to
  spare a sufficient force to invest it, but it had been masked by a
  considerable body of troops under the command of King Gulussa, strengthened
  by a small Roman contingent under the leadership of C. Laelius. This force
  was to be attacked by the native army, while Diogenes with his mercenaries
  was to make a sally from the fortress. Another sally, timed as nearly as
  possible for the same moment, was to be made from the city. Everyone,
  besiegers as well as besieged, recognized the fact that the critical moment
  had come. If this effort succeeded, the fate of Carthage would be postponed
  almost indefinitely; if it failed, the capture of the city could be only a
  question of time. If it did not yield to force, it would certainly succumb to
  famine.</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal himself was roused by the gravity of the situation from his
  usual self-indulgence and lethargy. He was not wholly without the feelings of
  a patriot and a soldier, and in this supreme effort of his country he did his
  best to rise to the occasion. The chief object of his energies was the
  formation of what may be called a Sacred Phalanx. It was to consist entirely
  of native Carthaginians, a class of troops seldom used except in cases of
  grave necessity. These were to be chosen by a method which Hasdrubal borrowed
  from the practice of Rome. He began by selecting a hundred men of tried
  courage. Each of the hundred chose nine comrades; and each of these nine,
  again, chose nine more. The result was a hundred companies, numbering each a
  hundred men, all bound together by the special obligation of a common tie.
  The legion was splendidly equipped with richly gilded armour, and arms of the
  very finest quality. Each company had its own badge.</p>

  <p>It was a fine force, but it was all that the citizen population of
  Carthage could do to raise it. Indeed so reduced were the numbers on the roll
  of military effectives that some recruits had to be enfranchised in order
  that they might be enrolled in the legion. Cleanor, not a little to his
  surprise, found himself attached to Hasdrubal's own staff. The general,
  indeed, said a few gracious words to the young man when he reported himself.
  If there had been any difference between them, said Hasdrubal, it might now
  be forgotten. A chance such as might never be repeated had occurred of saving
  Carthage. The city would not be ungrateful to those who used this occasion
  energetically.</p>

  <p>Cleanor could not banish his recollections of the past, and the suspicions
  which persistently followed them; but his pride was naturally flattered, and
  he hoped for the best.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE BATTLE ON THE ISTHMUS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Sacred Phalanx, as described in the last chapter, was
  undoubtedly a formidable body of men, one that, rightly handled, might win a
  battle. The difficulty was to bring its force to bear. There were, in fact,
  only two ways of doing this. One was to break through the lines of investment
  which had been drawn across the isthmus; the other was to transport the
  troops on shipboard to some place from which they might operate. Both methods
  were risky and doubtful, but both offered some hope of success.</p>

  <p>The lines of investment had been hastily made, contained some weak places,
  and were not adequately guarded throughout their length. It was possible that
  they might be carried at one point or another by a determined attack. Of the
  plan of transport by sea it could only be said that it was not impossible.
  The new harbour-mouth had, as has been said, this advantage over the old,
  that it opened into deep water, where the blockading ships could find no
  anchorage. But if in bad weather it became impossible for the Roman fleet to
  watch the exit, it was also impossible, or, to say the least, highly
  dangerous, for any ship to venture out.</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal determined to try both methods. He divided the phalanx into
  three parts. Two of these three were to assault the investing lines at widely
  distant points; the third was to try the adventure of transport by sea. This
  was by far the most risky undertaking. If the division succeeded in reaching
  the spot at which it aimed, there still remained the problem of getting back.
  As a matter of fact, there would be no getting back, except in the event of
  victory.</p>

  <p>For this enterprise, therefore, volunteers were called. The volunteering,
  however, was by companies. It would have been against the principles on which
  the phalanx was constituted for any one soldier to leave the comrades to whom
  he was bound, either by their choice or by his own. But about the
  volunteering there was not difficulty. Twenty companies only were wanted, for
  more could not be safely accommodated in the transports, but double the
  number could easily have been obtained. The force was put under the command
  of an officer who had a high reputation for dashing courage, another of the
  numerous Hasdrubals, who, it might almost be said, swarmed in Carthage.
  Cleanor was commissioned to act as his aide-de-camp.</p>

  <p>Of the attack on the lines of investment little need be said. It was not
  wholly a failure, but it was certainly not a success. Stubborn as was the
  resistance offered by the Romans, the assailants broke through the lines at
  several points. At one time as many as seven or eight companies found
  themselves on the further side of the intrenchment, with somewhat diminished
  numbers indeed, but still substantially intact. Yet, for the most part, the
  line was still held by the besiegers. If the object of the Carthaginians had
  been to cut their way through the blockading force, it was accomplished. At
  various points the way out of Carthage lay open, and it would have been
  possible for at least a large portion of the force to escape.</p>

  <p>But much more than this was wanted, nothing less, in fact, than that the
  investment should practically cease to exist, that the besieged should be
  free to go and to return as they pleased. Nothing like this had been
  achieved. Those who, after a fierce struggle, had forced their way through to
  the open country, would have to struggle not less fiercely to force their way
  back. Hasdrubal could not afford to run the risk. The loss of such a force
  meant ruin to Carthage, which no longer possessed its old powers of recovery.
  He reluctantly ordered the signal of recall to be sounded, and the troops
  still more reluctantly obeyed.</p>

  <p>The division to which Cleanor was attached fared better, so far, at least,
  as to reach the field of battle. It was exceptionally fortunate in both
  embarking and landing without hindrance. A strong sea-wind had been blowing
  for some days, and the blockading squadron had been compelled to leave the
  harbour-mouth unwatched. Then came a sudden change of weather, and the
  troops, who had been bivouacking for two days on the chance of some such
  opportunity occurring, were hurried on shipboard, and had actually reached
  their destination before the Roman ships had put to sea again.</p>

  <p>The march to the place of meeting was effected without molestation, and a
  junction was made with the native allies. Diogenes, too, did not fail to
  perform his part in the concerted plan, arriving exactly at the right moment
  with a picked force of a thousand mercenaries. But the hope that something
  towards the relief of Carthage might be effected by this combination of
  forces was entirely disappointed. The native allies made one charge, but only
  one. Twenty thousand horsemen came down the incline, at the foot of which the
  Roman army was drawn up, at a gallop, their white burnooses streaming behind
  them, and their spear-points flashing in the sun.</p>

  <p>Cleanor always said that it was the most magnificent spectacle that he
  ever saw. Some of King Gulussa's squadrons were swept away by the impetuous
  rush of a multitude which outnumbered them many times. But the line of the
  Roman legions&mdash;there were three of them on the field, for Scipio had
  brought all his available force into action&mdash;did not waver for an
  instant. A few of the boldest riders hurled themselves on the Roman pikes.
  But not so much as a single gap was made in the ranks. Almost in a moment the
  huge array&mdash;like some great animal which exhausts its strength and
  spirit in one struggle&mdash;broke into hopeless confusion. Then the Roman
  cavalry, with the reserved squadrons of Numidian horse, charged the helpless
  mass.</p>

  <p>The slaughter that followed was terrible. It was said that seventy
  thousand mountaineers were left dead on the battle-field. That is impossible.
  Many of the tribesmen fled as soon as they saw that the day was not to be
  theirs, and these must have secured such a start as to make their escape
  easy. But the victorious cavalry went on slaying till their arms were
  weary.</p>

  <p>The safety of the mercenaries and the third division of the phalanx was
  now seriously compromised. They had, fortunately, effected a junction before
  the battle began, and it was of course a necessity that they should keep
  together. So much was certain, but it was not equally certain what was the
  best course for them to follow. The Carthaginians were anxious to return, if
  return was in any way possible, to the city. Their families, their friends,
  everything in fact that they held dear was there; it was only too probable
  that unless they got back at once they would never see the city or them
  again. The mercenaries, on the other hand, were bent on returning to the
  fortress of Nepheris, from which they had sallied forth. The fortress was
  near, so near that the legions could not bar their way, though the
  light-armed troops and the cavalry might molest them on the march.</p>

  <p>A hurried council of war was held; there was no time for discussion. Each
  officer&mdash;there were seven of rank to vote&mdash;gave his decision
  without reasons. Considerations of safety, which were overwhelmingly strong
  in favour of a retreat on the fortress of Nepheris, carried the day. Five
  voted for this course, and a sixth, who had originally declared for cutting
  their way through to Carthage, changed his mind when he saw himself in a
  small minority.</p>

  <p>Only Hasdrubal was left in opposition. "I swore to defend Carthage, not
  Nepheris," he exclaimed. Then, with an unconscious imitation of the obstinate
  Spartan at Plataea, he took a huge stone from the ground and threw it down in
  front of him, saying, "I give my vote for remaining."</p>

  <p>Cleanor's private opinion was that his chief's obstinacy was nothing else
  than madness, but he could not leave the general to whose person he had been
  attached.</p>

  <p>If Hasdrubal had thought that his opposition would determine the action of
  his colleagues he was mistaken. Without a word&mdash;and indeed there was no
  time for argument&mdash;they moved off in the direction of the fortress.
  Hasdrubal was brought to his senses by this decisive action, just as the
  Spartan had been before him. Nor could he mistake the meaning of the
  agitation that at once showed itself among his men. It was not difficult to
  see that he would soon be left almost alone.</p>

  <p>Accordingly he gave the signal to march. Some time, however, had been
  lost, and a number of light-armed troops from the Roman army were within a
  short distance of the retreating force. It became necessary, if their attacks
  were to be checked, for the rear ranks to face about. There was little or no
  actual fighting. The pursuers fell back as soon as the retreating division
  showed them a firm front. Their object was to cause as much delay as
  possible; the Carthaginians, on the other hand, had to solve the problem of
  making these necessary halts interfere as little as possible with the
  rapidity of their retreat. In this they were greatly helped by their high
  discipline and what may be called their perfect coherence, and they had
  actually got almost within a bow-shot of the rock- fortress when they had to
  turn, as they hoped, for the last time.</p>

  <p>There was now some really sharp fighting. The pursuers had been reinforced
  by a detachment of picked troops from the main body, men chosen for the speed
  with which they could move under a heavy equipment of armour and arms. The
  Carthaginians fell slowly back before them, keeping an unbroken line, and
  encouraged by the thought that if they could get within range of the walls
  they would be in comparative safety.</p>

  <p>Nor was this hope disappointed. The Romans, indeed, pressed on, for the
  walls were to all appearance deserted, but this appearance concealed a
  carefully concerted surprise. Hundreds of archers and clingers were crouching
  behind the battlements, and there were scores of catapults, with their range
  carefully adjusted, ready to discharge volleys of stones and javelins. At a
  given signal, fire, if the expression may be allowed, was opened with
  overwhelming effect. The Roman line absolutely staggered under the blow. At
  the same time the gates were thrown open, and before the enemy could recover,
  the whole of the retreating force was safe within the walls.</p>

  <p>But when, an hour or so afterwards, the roll was called, Cleanor was among
  the missing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20"></a>XX. &mdash; TREACHERY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE young Greek had had a narrow escape with his life. Two
  wounds&mdash;one on the head, producing a severe concussion of the brain; the
  other on the thigh, causing an almost fatal loss of blood&mdash;had well-nigh
  finished his career. For nearly forty-eight hours he remained in a state of
  complete unconsciousness; then the brain slowly began to resume its
  functions. But the weakness of extreme exhaustion still continued. He lay for
  days dimly conscious of his existence, but content to accept his
  surroundings, to swallow the food and drink which were offered him, and to
  sleep without asking any questions.</p>

  <p>Then a certain curiosity began to awake in him. The place in which he
  found himself was unfamiliar, and he lazily wondered where he was. The voices
  about him were strange&mdash;his sight was still too weak to distinguish
  faces&mdash;and the speech which they used was strange. His first attempt to
  move was followed by a feeling of absolute helplessness; his first effort at
  speech produced a sound so far-away that he hardly recognized his own
  voice.</p>

  <p>It was on the morning of the seventh day, after an unusually long and
  refreshing sleep, that he felt equal to the task of realizing where he was.
  The physician, who luckily happened to be paying him his morning visit, at
  once recognized the improvement in his patient.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" he said, when the young man attempted to speak. "Be quiet till you
  have had some food. You are better, I see, but you want some refreshment.
  Then you may ask questions, and listen to what is told you, but only for as
  long as I allow."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands, and an attendant entered the room, carrying a cup of
  broth which had been fortified with a cordial. Cleanor, who was still so
  helpless that he had to be fed like an infant, swallowed it with an excellent
  appetite, and was lorry when the last spoonful had been administered.</p>

  <p>"Good!" said the man of science; "we have positively brought a little red
  into your cheeks. You shall have another allowance when that has run itself
  out three times;" and he turned, as he spoke, a water-clock which stood on a
  table by the bedside. "Meanwhile, you can receive a friend who has been
  waiting for some days to renew his acquaintance with you."</p>

  <p>He nodded to the attendant, and the man pushed aside the curtain which
  hung over the entrance to the tent. The next moment the expected visitor
  appeared. Cleanor recognized in him the young officer, kinsman to Scipio,
  whose life he had saved in the attack on the Megara.</p>

  <p>"The gods be thanked," said the young Roman, "that I see you yourself
  again!"</p>

  <p>"That I am myself I must believe," replied Cleanor, "but of everything
  else I feel doubtful. Tell me what has happened."</p>

  <p>Scipio looked to the physician with a tacit inquiry whether the subject
  was permitted.</p>

  <p>"Speak on; it will worry him more, now that he has begun to think, to be
  left in ignorance."</p>

  <p>"To begin, then," said Scipio, "when did you see me last?"</p>

  <p>"Now I come to think of it, a dim remembrance of your face is about the
  last thing I can recall. But between that and the present there is a gulf of
  forgetfulness."</p>

  <p>"And no wonder; if you hadn't had a head of adamant that same gulf would
  have swallowed you up for good. Well, do you remember anything about a
  battle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes; the things begin to come back to me; you were on a bay horse. I
  remember thinking what a skeleton it was."</p>

  <p>"No wonder; these African pastures are terribly bare."</p>

  <p>"And now I remember that I thought of something else. It was those verses
  in Homer, the verses that Diomed says to Glaucus when they meet on the
  battlefield, and find that they are old family friends.</p>

  <p>The young Roman laughed aloud. "Now, this is curious," he cried. "We are
  bound to be friends, if thinking the same things be a mark of friendship. I
  remember that the very same thought about Glaucus and Diomed occurred to me.
  You have not forgotten everything, it is clear."</p>

  <p>"Come, my dear sir," interposed the physician, "you must not let him talk
  so much. Tell him your story, and then leave him to get a little rest."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Scipio, "what I have to say is very soon told. You will
  remember the discharge from the walls of the fort that checked our advance.
  It was admirably calculated; but, of course, when the fighting was so close
  as it was at the time, and the front ranks of the two armies were actually
  mixed together, it could not damage us without doing some harm to you. I saw
  two or three of your men struck down, manifestly, from the way in which they
  fell, by some missile from the walls. One of them I noticed particularly,
  because he was close to you. There could be no mistake, for there was a clear
  space round you. Our men had fallen back, and yours were making the best of
  their way to the gates. You two were rather behind the rest. I saw you stoop
  as if to lift your companion from the ground. You were looking towards us,
  for I particularly remember that I saw your face. You raised the man from the
  ground, but then your foot seemed to slip, and you fell forwards. Then you
  raised the man again. Several of us were watching you, and I have heard from
  them since that their recollections agree exactly with mine. And of this,
  too, I am quite certain, there was not a hand raised against you from our
  side of the field of battle. Well, we all saw you rise again with the man in
  your arms. You got him over your shoulder, for that, of course, was the
  easiest way of carrying him, but you still had your face looking our way. And
  before you turned you were struck by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Before I turned?" interrupted the sick man, who had been listening with
  rapt attention to the narrative. "Before I turned, you say; you are sure that
  I was struck by my friends behind me?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

  <div align="center">

    <p class="caption">"I saw you stoop and lift your companion from the
    ground."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"As sure," replied Scipio, "as that I am sitting here and speaking to you
  this moment."</p>

  <p>"Go on, then."</p>

  <p>"Before you turned you were struck from behind. The first blow was on the
  back of your leg. I saw you put your hand to the place. And you had hardly
  done that when you were felled to the ground by a second blow. That was on
  your head. We guessed as much from the way you fell; and when we came to
  examine you afterwards, we found it to be as I have said. Your good physician
  here will tell you the particulars."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the leech, "I will at the proper time. But for the present my
  patient has heard enough. Indeed, unless I am very much mistaken, he has
  heard too much."</p>

  <p>"Whether it is enough or too much," said Cleanor, "I must hear it all. It
  would be ten times worse to be left in this suspense. I can only judge from
  what you say that I must have been struck from behind, that is by my own
  friends. But that treachery I can't believe. What do you say, sir," he went
  on, looking to the physician; "can you throw any light on the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Be calm, be calm, my friend," said the physician. "You will undo all the
  good that we have been doing you for the last ten days. Here, let me feel
  your pulse... It is just as I thought," he went on, "a regular bounding
  pulse. I would have given anything for you to have had such a pulse when I
  first took you in hand. But now it means fever, and fever means I don't know
  what."</p>

  <p>"Still, I must have the whole story now," persisted Cleanor. "Do you think
  I can sleep with this doubt regarding my friends hanging over me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, a wilful man will have his way, but, mind, I wash my hands of the
  whole business. I am not responsible for what may happen. And it promised to
  be such a beautiful cure, too!"</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake go on! Tell me how I came to be wounded?" cried the
  patient, with an emphasis of which no one would have thought him capable half
  an hour before.</p>

  <p>"Well," replied the physician, "I will tell you what I know, but it is
  under protest. You see this"&mdash;he produced from his pocket a leaden
  bullet of the kind commonly used in slings&mdash;"I extracted this from the
  wound on your hip. A nasty wound it was, and had caused a terrible loss of
  blood. You see that mark? It is not a Roman mark, certainly. Do you recognize
  it? Unless I am very much mistaken, it is the Carthaginian letter that
  answers to what we Greeks call alpha. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"You are right," said Cleanor. "I have myself given them out to the
  slingers from the stores. Yes, it is a Carthaginian bullet."</p>

  <p>"Then there is another thing," the physician went on. "When they were
  stripping you to put you into bed, this stone that I hold in my hand fell out
  of a fold in your clothes. There were some fragments of hair upon it, and I
  recognized the hair as yours. See, they are here still;" and he produced a
  small piece of papyrus in which they were wrapped. "Now, where did that bit
  of stone come from? It has got, if you look closely at it, a little mortar on
  one side. At some time it has been built into a wall. You don't find such
  things lying about on the open plain. No; that bit of stone came from
  somewhere inside Nepheris. I have got some ten or twelve other pieces of
  stone very like it, that were picked up near the place by a boy whom I sent
  to search the next day. They are much of a size, and, I should say, though I
  don't profess to know much about such things, that they came from a catapult.
  Nothing else could have sent them so far. Now I have told you all I
  know."</p>

  <p>"Many thanks, sir!" said the Greek in a low voice. "I am convinced that
  there has been treachery; indeed you leave no room for doubt. But I could
  almost wish," he added with a melancholy smile, "I could almost wish that you
  had been less skilful, and my friends here less affectionate. I hardly feel
  as grateful to you as I ought to be. It is a grievous thing for a man to feel
  that he has been wounded in the house of his friends."</p>

  <p>"Come, come," said the kindly physician, "it may have been only an
  accident or a mistake after all! However, you have had excitement enough, and
  more than enough, for the day. Take this, and it will send you to sleep;" and
  producing a small phial of poppy-juice from his wallet he poured a potent
  dose into a cup of wine, and gave it to his patient.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, doctor!" murmured Cleanor, but added in a whisper, "Yes, sleep,
  but if only there could be no waking!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21"></a>XXI. &mdash; POLYBIUS</h2>

  <p class="first">CLEANOR'S wish for the sleep from which there is no waking
  was only too genuine. He felt almost heart-broken at the treatment which he
  had received. He had thrown himself into the cause of Carthage with a single-
  minded energy which had never been permitted to flag, and these wounds were
  his reward!</p>

  <p>True, he had a pretty clear notion of the quarter from which this
  treacherous enmity had proceeded. He felt sure that Hasdrubal had never
  forgiven him. That his vanity had been humbled and his cruelty baffled were
  offences that would be sure to rankle in the mind of such a man. But what
  could be said for a people which was content to be ruled by a Hasdrubal? The
  young Greek felt that he had lost his country, so to speak, a second time.
  His native town had perished, and now the city of his adoption, Carthage,
  which he had been eager to serve with life and death, had cruelly repudiated
  him.</p>

  <p>The first result of these thoughts was an absolute loss of all interest in
  life. He did not wish to recover, and for a time it seemed most likely that
  what he did not wish would not be. The physician found that all the ground
  which had been gained was lost, and for some days he despaired of his
  patient's life. There was no active disease; that would have given his art
  something definite to combat. But there was a total indifference to
  everything, which offered an inert, and, as it seemed, unconquerable
  resistance to all his efforts.</p>

  <p>Still, at twenty there is an almost physical desire for life which
  triumphs over the deepest sorrows and the most acute disappointments. Had
  Cleanor been master of his own actions he might have committed suicide. As it
  was, lying helpless in the hands of his physician and his friends, he had to
  submit to being kept alive. His appetite returned by degrees, though he was
  almost ashamed of being hungry. As his strength grew, and the blood began to
  course more briskly through his veins, he found interests revive which he had
  thought to be extinguished, interests to which he seemed to have bidden
  farewell And so the process of recovery went on.</p>

  <p>The young Scipio did his best to help it forward. He had often reproached
  himself with haste and want of discretion in prematurely revealing to his
  friend and preserver the revolting truth of the treachery of which he had
  been the object. He now exerted himself to repair the mischief. His
  attendance by the sick-bed was unceasing. He was always ready to talk, to
  read aloud, or to play a game of draughts or soldiers, as the strength of the
  patient permitted.</p>

  <p>And all was done with so genuine an affection that it could not fail to
  win its way to the heart of the patient. More than once the young man's great
  kinsman, the Commander himself, spared an hour from his innumerable
  occupations to pay a visit to the sick man's tent. Cleanor felt again, in
  even increased force, what had impressed him at his first meeting, the
  inexplicable charm of Scipio's personality.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances Cleanor's health improved, at first almost in
  spite of himself, for he could hardly be said to have had any wish for life,
  and then with greater rapidity, as time weakened the painful impressions of
  the past and strengthened new interests and hopes. In the early days of his
  illness his host, for he occupied the private tent of the younger Scipio, had
  been granted a furlough from his military duties, for the express purpose of
  attending on his guest. Though renewed more than once, this had to come to an
  end.</p>

  <p>But Cleanor never lacked company, and that of the most interesting kind.
  It will be remembered that on the occasion of his visiting the Roman camp in
  the capacity of interpreter to the officer negotiating an exchange of
  prisoners, he had made the acquaintance of the historian Polybius. This
  acquaintance he was now able to improve. Polybius, as a non-combatant, had
  plenty of time to bestow on the invalid, in whom he found an intelligent
  listener and even critic. It became his constant custom to bring what he had
  written on the previous day, read it aloud to the invalid, and invite his
  criticism on it.</p>

  <p>"I want above all things," Polybius said, "to be both candid and clear.
  Tell me if I seem to write like a partisan, or if I am obscure. What you do
  not readily understand will certainly be unintelligible to nine readers out
  of ten."</p>

  <p>The reading was commonly followed by a conversation, in which a great
  variety of subjects were touched upon, and in which Cleanor found a quite
  inexhaustible interest. Polybius, who was now past middle age, had seen about
  as much of men and manners as any man of his time. He had held high military
  office in his native country, commanding the cavalry of the Achman League,
  the last effort of Greece to hold her place in the world of politics. He had
  never seen, it so happened, any active service of importance, but in the
  knowledge of the theory of war he was unsurpassed by any man of his time. He
  had indeed made a very important contribution to the military art by greatly
  improving the practice of signalling. If there was anything that raised the
  old soldier's vanity it was this. He could not boast of any victories, and he
  belonged to a nation which had ceased to be a factor of importance in the
  politics of the world, but the credit of this invention gave him, he
  believed, a rank among the great soldiers of history. It was, he told
  Cleanor, the proudest moment of his life when he saw his system used, and
  used with success, by the great Scipio himself.</p>

  <p>But nothing in Polybius' conversation was more interesting than what he
  had to say about his experiences during his seventeen years of exile in
  Italy. Along with many hundreds of his countrymen&mdash;with all, it might
  almost be said, who were in any way distinguished or able&mdash;he had been
  deported to Italy. But he had been more fortunate than most of his
  companions. While they were distributed among the towns of Northern Italy,
  where they dragged out a miserable existence, without books or society, and
  often with but the scantiest means, he had been permitted to live in Rome. He
  had won the friendship of Æmilius Paullus, the great conqueror of Macedonia,
  and he and his two sons interested themselves in him. The society into which
  he was thus introduced was the most brilliant which Rome possessed, and
  Polybius was never weary of talking about it. Cleanor, who, like his
  countrymen in general, had been accustomed to regard the Romans as little
  better than barbarians, was astonished at his enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"We haven't any society in Greece," Polybius would say, "that can be
  fairly matched with them. They are on a larger scale, more strongly built, so
  to speak. They are not so acute, perhaps, as some of our people, but far more
  solid and strong."</p>

  <p>"But they have no literature, I am told," interrupted Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"That is hardly so," replied Polybius, "they have the beginnings of what
  will be, I am sure, a great literature. At present they do little more than
  translate from us. But their translations are better than any originals we
  can now produce. I used to be present at the first readings of the comedies
  of their great writer, Terence. They were taken, it is true, from Menander
  and Diphilus and other Greeks, but the taking was done with the greatest art,
  and the language was admirable. You may take it for granted that with a
  language so finished as Latin now is, a real literature is sure to come
  before long. And it was curious, too, to see what admirable judges of style
  these young nobles were. It wasn't true, though it was commonly reported,
  that Scipio and his friend Laelius wrote Terence's plays for him, but I can
  bear witness of my own knowledge that they helped him greatly with them. You
  see, he was not a Roman born, and it is not everyone that can write Roman
  Latin, any more than everyone can write Attic Greek. And there is another
  thing which we cannot match: the culture of the women in the best families.
  Among us it is very seldom that a respectable woman can do more than read and
  write; very often she cannot do as much as that. It is very different in
  Rome&mdash;not, of course, everywhere, for there are some who stick
  obstinately to the old ways, but in the circle of which I am talking.
  Laelius&mdash;he, you know, is Scipio's great friend&mdash;whose acquaintance
  you will soon make, has a daughter whose learning would put many of our
  students to shame. She was a girl not far into her teens when I used to see
  her&mdash;they do not shut up their women in our fashion&mdash;and she could
  speak Greek with the very finest accent, and they said just the same of her
  Latin; of that, of course, I could hardly judge so well."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see the old man Cato?" asked Cleanor. "I have often heard
  talk of him. He must have been a worthy of a very different stamp."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I knew him well," replied Polybius, "and have excellent reasons
  for remembering him. As you say, he was of a very different stamp, and
  belonged to quite another age. He was of a time when scarcely a Roman had
  ever set his foot outside Italy, or even imagined that anything good could
  come from beyond the seas. Yet it was strange how the new spirit had
  succeeded in touching even him in his old age. Do you know that I had the
  honour of having him for a pupil? He must have been close upon eighty years
  of age when he found that it put him at a disadvantage not to know what other
  men knew, and he actually took to learning Greek. He had long been able to
  speak it in a way, but he took to reading it, and I had the pleasure of being
  his teacher. I used to stay at his country house, for it was only there that
  he had leisure for his lessons. It was a curious experience. He used to
  entertain his neighbours, the country-side folk, farmers and the like, in the
  friendliest fashion. They were fine, sturdy folk, and I soon understood, when
  I saw them, how Rome seems likely to conquer the world. And what heads they
  had! The wine-cup didn't halt in its rounds, I can tell you, and if I hadn't
  missed my turn as often as I could, the end would have been disaster. As for
  the old man, he never shirked. But there was a very harsh side to his
  character. Nothing could be harder than his dealings with his slaves. They
  were mere beasts of burden to him, not one whit of more account than his
  horses and oxen,&mdash;not indeed of so much, seeing that they gave more
  trouble. He gave them just as much food as would keep them alive, not a
  morsel more. When they grew too old for work, he turned them out of doors to
  starve. However, he behaved very well to me, and if I gave him any help, he
  repaid me many fold. He was won over somehow to take the part of the exiles.
  Of course Scipio and his friends had a great deal to do with it, but I always
  thought that he had also a kindness for me. I was in the senate-house when
  the question came on&mdash;should the Greek exiles be allowed to go home?
  There was a hot debate, and a close division was expected. The old man rose
  to speak quite at the end of the sitting. I must say that what he said was
  not flattering, but it was certainly effective. 'Are we going to waste any
  more time about these trumpery Greeks? If we don't settle the matter to-day
  we shall have the whole discussion over again.' Then he sat down. The
  senators laughed; and the motion was carried easily. I went to thank him the
  next day. He was very friendly, and I took courage to say that if we were
  allowed to go back, we might also be restored to our rank and honours. He
  smiled very grimly. 'Friend,' he said, 'when a man is lucky enough to get out
  of the Cyclops' cave, I take it that he would be a fool to go back after his
  hat or his cloak.'I took the hint, and was off before two days had passed.
  But before I went, he sent a message that he wanted to see me. He was then at
  his country house, and he was busy making some alterations in a book that he
  had written about agriculture. He was dictating, and a slave, a wretched
  Greek, who looked, as he probably was, half-starved, was writing down. 'I
  bought him at Magnesia', he said, 'for £20, and an excellent bargain it was,
  but he is getting past his work now.'I saw the poor fellow flush up, but Cato
  cared no more for his feelings than if he had been a dog. 'But now for what I
  wanted to say to you. I don't suppose that I shall see the end of Carthage,
  though it will not be for want of urging my countrymen to bring it about. But
  you probably will, for it can hardly be postponed for another ten years.
  Well, there is one thing in Carthage that I have always wished to see, and
  that is, Mago's work on agriculture. I have never been able to get anything
  like a complete copy of it. Only two or three of the books&mdash;there are
  twenty-eight in all&mdash;have come into my hands, and I have found them
  quite admirable, and have made all the use of them that I could for my own
  treatise. What I wanted to say to you was to bear this matter in mind if you
  should chance to be at hand when the end comes. Books often fare very badly
  at such times. What, indeed, does the common soldier know about their value?
  But, depend upon it, this one will be worth a whole ship- load of gold and
  silver. Keep your eyes open, then, and warn all whom you know to be on the
  look-out for Mago's book.' That was the last time I saw him. He lived two
  years longer, and died happy, I suppose, because war had been declared
  against Carthage."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22"></a>XXII. &mdash; A PLEASURE TRIP</h2>

  <p class="first">THE year drew to its close with a period of inaction on both
  sides. The Carthaginians, greatly disheartened by the defeat of the native
  tribes, made no further attempt to assume the offensive. They still held Fort
  Nipheris, the Romans not being able to spare enough men to invest it. The
  besiegers, on the other hand, were content to let things alone for the
  present. Time was on their side. They added daily to the strength of their
  siege-works, and their troops, most of them at their first landing raw
  recruits, were now becoming well-seasoned soldiers; A few days before the end
  of the year Scipio left for Rome in order to be present at the elections.
  Nothing was done during his absence, but it was understood that on his return
  active operations would be commenced without delay.</p>

  <p>On the day after the departure of the commander-in-chief, Cleanor received
  a visit from his physician. Latterly these visits had been rare and brief,
  not going beyond a few questions and a short gossip on the news of the camp.
  Now, however, the patient was subjected to a close examination. When this was
  completed, the physician shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "you are not making quite the progress I had
  hoped and expected to see. The pulse is weak, I find. You have headaches, you
  tell me, now and then, and little appetite. This last is not a good sign. A
  young man like you, when he is really getting well, ought to be as hungry as
  a wolf. On the whole, I think you would be the better for a change, and we
  must consider how it can be managed."</p>

  <p>At this point of the conversation Polybius entered the tent. "I am not
  satisfied," said the physician, addressing the new-comer. "I don't find my
  young patient making as good a recovery as I had hoped, and I have been
  suggesting a change. These are excellent quarters, and every care is taken, I
  know, of our friend, but a camp is not a good place for a complete recovery.
  Somehow the presence of a number of men seems to make the air somewhat
  stale."</p>

  <p>"I am particularly glad to see you," said Polybius, "for this is exactly
  the business about which I have come. Scipio, who thinks of everybody, and
  forgets nothing, was talking to me about Cleanor here the day before
  yesterday, and the very last thing he said to me yesterday when I bade him
  good-bye on board his galley was, 'Don't forget the invalid.' He left the
  matter, as a whole, to my discretion, but his idea was a short trip to Egypt.
  I was to ask your opinion, and if that was favourable, I was to arrange the
  details. Scipio will be away for nearly or quite a month, for there are many
  things to settle in Rome, and of course nothing of importance will be done
  during his absence. That gives us plenty of time. What do you say,
  doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be better," replied the physician. "We will say a month.
  That won't give you much time on shore. But I don't care about that. In fact
  it is the sea voyage that I count upon for putting our young friend right.
  Still, there is plenty to see in Alexandria, even if you can't get any
  further."'</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I expected to hear," said Polybius. "In fact, I so
  much took it for granted that I have given orders for a galley to be ready
  this evening. So if you don't object, Cleanor, we will start at once. There
  is a nice westerly breeze blowing, which we ought not to lose."</p>

  <p>Cleanor had no objection to make. He was, on the contrary, much pleased
  with the idea. He had certainly been feeling somewhat languid, and the time
  was beginning to hang heavy on his hands. Besides, what could be more
  delightful than to see Alexandria?</p>

  <p>A start accordingly was made at sunset. Everything favoured the voyagers.
  The wind never veered from the west, and though towards evening it commonly
  lulled, it never ceased; during the day it always blew briskly, but never was
  so strong as to cause inconvenience. In consequence the galley's voyage was
  almost a record, for she reached the quay in what was called the Eunostos or
  Haven of Happy Return in nine days. The travellers paid the customary visit
  of thanksgiving for a safe voyage to the Temple of Poseidon, and dropped a
  half-stater apiece into the chest for offerings. This done, they presented a
  letter of introduction, with which Scipio had furnished them, to the official
  who represented Rome in Alexandria, were received by him with effusion, and
  pressed to accept his hospitality, but preferred the independence of lodgings
  of their own.</p>

  <p>Their first visit was, of course, to the great Library. This had not at
  that time reached the enormous proportions which it attained about a century
  later, when it received, in addition to its own wealth, the vast collections
  of Pergamum, but the volumes on its shelves already numbered more than a
  quarter of a million. The two friends could have spent months, had months
  been at their disposal, in this wilderness of learning. It was not only the
  multitude of its treasures that astonished them, it was the extraordinary
  value of many of the particular volumes. Here the student was permitted to
  inspect, under due safeguards, of course, the actual autographs of some of
  the most famous authors of the world. One of the Ptolemies, ironically called
  the Well-doer, had fraudulently possessed himself of the originals Æschylus,
  Sophocles, and Euripides, presenting the Athenian people which owned them
  with copies and a money compensation. His successors had followed the same
  unscrupulous policy. Indeed, no valuable manuscript that once found its way
  into Alexandria was ever permitted to leave it.</p>

  <p>Adjoining the Library was the Museum, with its theatre or great
  lecture-hall, its smaller lecture-rooms, its dining-hall, and collegiate
  buildings, cloisters, gardens, and park. The two friends wandered from room
  to room, where all comers were welcome&mdash;the munificent endowments of
  learning rendered all fees unnecessary&mdash;and listened to discourses on
  all the subjects of knowledge under the sun.</p>

  <p>There did not happen to be any commanding or famous personality among the
  professors of the time, but there was plenty of learning and abundance of
  rhetoric if not of eloquence. A successor of Aristarchus discoursed on the
  criticism of Homer, denouncing, for such happened to be the subject of the
  day, the pernicious heresy of the Chorizontes, the critics who maintained a
  diverse authorship of the Iliad and the Odyssey. The chair of Euclid was
  occupied by a geometrician who had made some additions to the science of
  trigonometry. In the lecture-room devoted to astronomy they had the good
  fortune to hear a really distinguished man of science, Hipparchus of
  Bithynia, who had been invited by the authorities of the Museum to give a
  course of lectures. He had chosen for his subject his own great discovery of
  the precession of the equinoxes, made, as he explained, by a comparison of
  his own observations with those of earlier astronomers.</p>

  <p>As they left the room they were invited by an attendant, who observed that
  they were strangers, to read an inscription written in letters of gold over
  the principal door. It was the epigram of Apollonius of Rhodes on the
  reception of the Hair of Berenice among the Constellations. Polybius was
  recognized by one of the professors, who had been glad to leave the thankless
  politics of Greece for a quiet competence in this abode of learning, and was
  invited by the professor to take dinner in the great banqueting-hall. Cleanor
  was, of course, included in the invitation. The intervening time was spent
  pleasantly enough in inspecting the garden, in which the collection of
  tropical plants, afterwards so famous, had been already begun, and in
  examining, what was then a sight peculiar to Alexandria, a menagerie.</p>

  <p>Both Polybius and his friend were inclined to think that all time not
  spent in the Library or the lecture-room was more or less wasted. Still,
  there were sights which it was impossible for a visitor to Alexandria to
  neglect. Such was the mausoleum of the Ptolemies, with the coffin of gold in
  which reposed the remains of the great Alexander; the observatory; the palace
  of justice; and the market, thronged with the commerce of the whole of the
  civilized world. There were hours, too, when the Library was shut, and these
  were spent in a way both amusing and instructive. The two wandered through
  the different regions of the great city, the streets inhabited by the Jews,
  with squalid exteriors, often concealing palaces fit for kings, and the
  native quarter, crowded with figures and faces that might have belonged to
  long-dead subjects of the Pharaohs. Not less interesting than the city were
  the docks and quays. Egypt was already one of the great granaries of the
  world. Loading the wheat ships was an employment that provided thousands of
  labourers with sustenance, and at this time, thanks to the war, which had
  thrown out of cultivation the fertile territory of Carthage, the trade was
  particularly brisk.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, the time did not hang heavily on the visitors' hands, and Cleanor
  could hardly believe that ten days had passed when Polybius introduced the
  subject of departure. There was a certain hesitation in the old man's manner,
  and Cleanor, who had all the quick observation and alert intelligence of his
  race, did not fail to perceive it.</p>

  <p>"This is a delightful place, Cleanor," he said, "and I hope to see it
  again. Indeed, there are books in the Library which I must go through
  carefully before I give my magnum opus to the world. But that must be for the
  future. Now I have no choice but to go. We must not allow less than twelve
  days for the return voyage, though, if this wind holds, we shall not take so
  long."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Cleanor, "I am ready to start at any time."</p>

  <p>Polybius hesitated a second before he spoke. "Well," he said, "I don't
  think that there is any necessity for your coming with me. It is a pity that
  you should not see something more of Egypt now you are here. And then there
  is the question of health. It would be a thousand pities that you should have
  anything like a relapse. As for me, I must go. Next month, or, at furthest,
  the month after, is likely to see one of the greatest events in the history
  of the West, and it would be folly in me, who pretend to be an historian, if,
  having the chance of seeing it with my own eyes, I should fail to be
  present."</p>

  <p>Cleanor saw in a moment that the whole thing had been planned, and that
  his companion was speaking by instruction. But he thought it prudent to
  conceal his knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I understand; but I think that I would sooner go back
  with you."</p>

  <p>This was put out as a feeler, and it did not fail in its object.</p>

  <p>"I think it must be as I said," replied Polybius with some hesitation. "To
  tell you the truth, it was Scipio's wish that you should remain here, and I
  should not like to go against his wish. The master of legions," he added with
  a smile, "must have his own way."</p>

  <p>"Exactly so," said the young man, "and I have no wish to oppose him."</p>

  <p>"Good!" replied Polybius with evident relief; "I was sure that you would
  be reasonable, so sure, in fact, that I have made arrangements for you to
  start to-morrow on a journey up the Nile. All expenses have been paid, and
  you will have nothing to do but enjoy the most wonderful sight in the world.
  There need be no hurry. Take your time and see everything at your leisure.
  The chance may never come again. The boat and its crew have been hired for
  three months. When you return you shall find, all being well, a letter with
  instructions awaiting you here."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cleanor, "I can't help being sorry that you are not coming
  with me, but the plan is a most delightful one. You could not have devised
  anything better."</p>

  <p>The young man's real thoughts were quite of another kind, though he
  concealed them with an adroitness which would have done credit to a veteran
  diplomatist. The fact was that he had been haunted for some time past by
  anxieties with which was mingled a certain feeling of self- reproach. They
  had scarcely presented themselves, or had been readily banished, during the
  period of his weakness and forced inaction. But when health was fully
  restored, and he again felt himself capable of action, he could no longer
  ignore them.</p>

  <p>What had happened, what was likely to happen, to his foster-mother and her
  daughter? To Theoxena he was bound by one of the most natural and tender of
  ties. To let her perish, or suffer a fate worse than death, would be a
  shameful failure of duty, only less disgraceful than if she had been his
  mother indeed. And her daughter&mdash;? He had scarcely thought of the girl
  at the time, so engrossing had been the anxieties of the moment. But her
  image had been impressed deeply on his memory, and even on his heart. He
  seemed to see her still, as she told, with all the simplicity of a child, the
  pitiful story of her kidnapped brother. The large pathetic eyes, brimmed with
  tears, haunted him night and day.</p>

  <p>And there came with the thought the memory of another face, his sister in
  blood, lost to him for ever. Was Fate about to deal him another blow even
  worse than the first? Cleoné was dead. Was the time coming when the best
  thing that he could wish for Daphne would be that she should be dead also?
  And was he to be sight-seeing on the Nile, curiously speculating on the
  history of long-past generations, while this awful tragedy of the present was
  working itself out at Carthage? The thought was maddening. "No" he said to
  himself; "I may not be able to do anything to help, but at least I will not
  be taking my pleasure while they are suffering torture or death!"</p>

  <p>It was, however, necessary to dissimulate. It was plain that Scipio was
  determined to have him out of the way when Carthage fell. Nor could anything,
  he acknowledged to himself, be more reasonable or more kind. Though he could
  not be supposed to feel any sense of duty to a state from which he had
  received such treatment, still he might well wish not to witness its final
  catastrophe. Of his private feelings the Roman general could have no
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>His only course was to appear to acquiesce in the plan. Scipio must
  undoubtedly have provided for the contingency of his resistance. Polybius, he
  remembered, had introduced the subject with a certain hesitation, as if an
  objection was not impossible. He was now, Cleanor trusted, off his guard. A
  too prompt consent might have seemed suspicious. As it was, he reflected with
  satisfaction, he had shown exactly the right kind of reluctance. He had
  expressed regret at losing his friend's company, without giving a hint of any
  personal unwillingness to accept the plan.</p>

  <p>That evening Polybius started on his return voyage. Cleanor was with him
  to the last moment, talking with an admirably simulated gaiety and interest
  of the pleasure which lay before him in exploring the Egypt of the
  Pharaohs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; DIPLOMACY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Nile boat which had been engaged for Cleanor was lying
  at one of the quays which bordered a considerable part of the eastern or city
  shore of Lake Mareotis. The arrangement had been that it should start early
  in the morning of the day following the departure of Polybius. But the young
  man purposely delayed his appearance till late in the day, and the captain
  and crew, who had plenty of private affairs to occupy them for as long as
  their employers chose to stay, made no complaint.</p>

  <p>It wanted but two or three hours to sunset when Cleanor at last presented
  himself. The captain explained that they would not have time that day to go
  further than the mouth of the canal which connected the lake with the river
  Nile. This was false. They had plenty of light to make the passage of the
  canal itself. But the passenger assented with an unquestioning alacrity which
  inspired the old rogue who owned the boat with the liveliest expectations of
  a lazy and prosperous voyage. Both were, in fact, equally satisfied. The
  captain wanted to do as little as possible, and also contemplated a final
  carouse at the Canal Tavern, a house famous for its wines. The passenger, who
  had made up his mind to leave the boat at the earliest opportunity, was glad
  not to be taken any further distance from the city than could be helped.</p>

  <p>As soon as they halted for the night he summoned the old captain and had
  an explanation with him. He began by asking in an indifferent tone the names
  of the chief cities which they were to pass. The captain of course had his
  lesson by heart, and answered with a long list of places, adding, as he
  mentioned each name, the chief sights for which it was famous.</p>

  <p>"And do you particularly wish to see all these places again?" asked the
  Greek with a smile.</p>

  <p>The old man stared at him. "It is my business, my lord," he answered; "a
  poor trade, it is true, but it was my father's before me, and his father's
  too, and so on for I don't know how many generations. I don't know why I have
  stuck to it, for the pay is poor, but so I have. It is our way, I suppose, in
  Egypt."</p>

  <p>"The pay is poor, you say," said the Greek; "but it would be better if you
  didn't go this voyage, and had the pay all the same."</p>

  <p>"My lord is laughing at his servant," said the captain, staring again with
  eyes more wide open than ever.</p>

  <p>"Not at all; the fact is that I have no more wish to see these places than
  you have."</p>

  <p>The captain went on staring. "Then why&mdash;?" he began.</p>

  <p>"My friends settled the matter for me; but I would sooner stay where I
  am."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said the captain, closing one eye entirely, and
  diminishing the other to its natural size. "I understand. You have a friend,
  a young friend, I daresay, and you don't think that this is a good time for a
  long voyage."</p>

  <p>Cleanor saw that the captain had his own ideas of what was keeping him in
  Alexandria, and did not care to disabuse him. After all, he reflected, he was
  not quite wrong. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You are right, my lord. These cities and temples and tombs up the river
  are very fine, but they will be just as fine ten, twenty, thirty years hence.
  You can't say that of youth. It passes, my lord, it passes, and you must
  enjoy it while you can. But what am I to say? I have been paid to take you up
  to Philae, and, if you wish it, as far as the Second Cataract. I signed the
  agreement before a notary. He knows all about it; other people know it. What
  am I to say when they find me loitering about here and your lordship not to
  be seen? You will hardly believe it, but there are positively people so
  wicked that they will say I murdered you to get the money without making the
  journey."</p>

  <p>Cleanor did believe that there were such people, and thought to himself
  that the captain did not look altogether like a man to whom such things were
  impossible.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said he, "I will set that all right. I will sign a paper before the
  chief of the village, or anyone else that will serve, to say that I was
  compelled by urgent private business, which kept me in Alexandria, to give up
  my proposed voyage. You will be able to show that to any one who may be
  curious enough to inquire.</p>

  <p>And this was actually done. The village headman was called on for his
  services, and witnessed a declaration on the part of Cleanor that he released
  the captain of the Sphinx from his contract to carry him to Philae and the
  Second Cataract, and that he claimed no compensation or return of the money
  or of any part of it for the non-fulfilment of the conditions. This done, he
  made the captain and crew a present of a gold piece, and saw with
  satisfaction that they departed to expend it at the Canal Tavern. Shortly
  afterwards Cleanor hired a small rowing-boat, and before long found himself
  again in Alexandria.</p>

  <p>As to his general plan of operations he was quite clear. There was only
  one plan of getting into Carthage. It was full of risk, but still it was
  practicable. A brisk trade was being carried on from Alexandria in
  blockade-running. Corn had long been at famine prices in the besieged city.
  What was worth an ounce of silver on an Alexandrian quay could be sold for at
  least half an ounce of gold in the markets of Carthage. If only one ship-load
  out of three succeeded in escaping the Roman galleys a magnificent profit was
  realized. The average of those ships that ran the blockade was not smaller;
  it was probably higher. The new harbour-mouth gave, as has been explained, a
  better chance.</p>

  <p>Cleanor, then, was resolved to make his venture in a blockade- running
  corn-ship. The question was, what disguise should he use? Fortune had done
  something for him. The wound in his thigh had given him a limp. During his
  illness a slight beard and a fairly thick moustache had grown. These things
  meant a considerable change. More was effected by a brown dye which gave him
  the complexion of an Arab. The character that he thought it best to assume
  was that of pedlar. He provided himself with suitable clothing and a pack,
  which last, however, he left for the present unfilled.</p>

  <p>As Egypt was in alliance with Rome the traders that followed the business
  of blockade-running had to affect a certain disguise. The cargoes were
  consigned to dealers in Italian ports, and the ships themselves actually
  shaped their course for Italy, and kept on it as long as possible, so as to
  minimize to the utmost the chances of capture. The event of a passenger
  offering himself was rare, for the destination of this class of corn-ships
  was an open secret. If, however, one chanced to come, the captain could
  hardly refuse a passage. If he was exceptionally honest he might put
  difficulties in the way; commonly he left the stranger to find out his
  mistake, taking the precaution of having the passage-money paid in
  advance.</p>

  <p>Cleanor, who had put up for the night at a little tavern close to the
  water-side, picked up a little information from the talk which was going on
  round him. Improving his acquaintance with a sailor, who seemed the most
  respectable of the somewhat miscellaneous company at the tavern, he learnt a
  good deal more. Finally his new friend offered to introduce him to the
  captain of the <i>Sea-mew</i>, a blockade-runner which was intending to sail
  the following day.</p>

  <p>"Dioscorides," said the sailor, "is an honest man in his way. He would
  have taken your passage-money for Rhegium, it is true, and made no scruple
  about carrying you to Carthage. That, you might say, is scarcely fair. But
  then you are quite safe with him. He won't cut your throat and throw you
  overboard for the sake of your pack. That's what I call honesty in a
  sea-captain. If you want to find a finer article, you will hardly get it on
  this side of the Pillars of Hercules. We will go on board at the last moment,
  and I will give him a hint that it is all straight."</p>

  <p>The object of going on board so late was to show that the person proposing
  himself as a passenger had no idea of lodging an information against the ship
  with the agent of the Roman Republic.</p>

  <p>On the following day, accordingly, this programme was carried out. The
  <i>Sea-mew</i> was taking on board the water wanted for the voyage, a part of
  the preparations naturally left to the last, when Cleanor and his friend
  reached the quay. A grizzled veteran, whose face was tanned by the suns and
  winds of some fifty years of voyaging, was receiving his last instructions
  from a keen-looking man, whose pale and unhealthy-looking skin spoke of long
  confinement to the desk and the counting-house. The conference over, Cleanor
  was introduced.</p>

  <p>"My young friend here," said the sailor, "is going the same way as you
  are. Cleanor, this is Dioscorides, the captain of the <i>Sea-mew</i>. You
  could not sail with a better man; and you," he went on, turning to the
  captain, "will find him an agreeable and accommodating passenger." The word
  "accommodating" was emphasized by a wink.</p>

  <p>"Good!" said the captain; "come and see your quarters. That is the last
  water-cask, and now we are off."</p>

  <p>He led the way as he spoke to the gangway that connected the quay- side
  with the deck. In five minutes more the <i>Sea-mew</i> was on her way west-
  ward.</p>

  <p>A little after noon, the <i>Sea-mew</i> being now fairly started and
  making good way with a strong breeze that was almost dead aft, the captain
  invited his passenger to come below. The cabin was not spacious,&mdash;for
  the vessel, though carrying cargo, was built for speed, her owners having had
  in view the more risky kinds of trade,&mdash;but it was well furnished, and
  the meal that was spread on the table was almost sumptuous. The captain did
  not fail to observe his passenger's look of surprise.</p>

  <p>"In this business," he said, "a mina or two this way or that does not make
  much odds. It is no use to save when you are going either to make your
  fortune or be drowned, or, it may be, hanged."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," replied Cleanor; "but a passenger is not in the same case. I
  am afraid that such fare will not suit my modest means."</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble yourself on that score," returned the captain. "Suppose we
  say fifty drachmas for your passage-money, and ten more as a present to the
  crew, if the voyage turns out to your liking."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that you will not gain much by me on these terms," said
  Cleanor as he produced the money, which he had carefully made up out of a
  variety of coins. He thought it safer to avoid any appearance of wealth.</p>

  <p>The voyage which followed was prosperous in the extreme. A west wind, with
  just a touch of south in it, carried the <i>Sea-mew</i> towards Italy, which,
  as has been said, was nominally her destination, with a quite surprising
  regularity of speed. She seldom made more than six miles in the hour, but she
  did this day and night with little variation, and without a single drawback.
  Her course lay just within view of the African shore till Cyrene was sighted.
  Then the captain struck a bolder course, nor did they come again within sight
  of land till a little object showed itself in the northern horizon which was
  speedily identified as Malta. Not long after they spoke a coral-fisher's
  boat, from which they learnt that a Roman squadron, with the
  commander-in-chief on board, had passed a couple of days before.</p>

  <p>"If that is so," said the captain, "I shall steer straight for Carthage.
  We are likely to have a clear course. It is scarcely likely that the Roman
  cruisers will be prowling about for prizes in the wake of their own
  squadron."</p>

  <p>As they sat together at their supper, the only officer who messed with
  them having gone on deck to superintend the setting of another sail, the
  captain said to Cleanor:</p>

  <p>"Don't suppose that I want to intrude on your private affairs, and if my
  questions are inconvenient, or you have any reason whatever for declining to
  say anything more about yourself, don't hesitate to tell me. I shan't be
  offended or think the worse of you for it. On the other hand, I may be able
  to help you or give you a hint. Now, to be quite frank, I can't make you out.
  You wish to pass as a pedlar&mdash;excuse my plainness of speech. Now, you
  are no more a pedlar than I am; not so much, indeed, for you have never, I
  should say, either bought or sold anything in your life. You talk like a
  gentleman. I could not do it myself, but I know the real thing when I hear
  it. Now, what does it mean?"</p>

  <p>Cleanor had been long prepared for some such question as this. When he
  adopted his disguise he had vaguely counted on being one among a crowd of
  passengers, and able to keep himself as much in the background as he pleased.
  In such a situation he might have sustained his character with fair success.
  But it was a very different thing to sit tête-à- tête for a fortnight
  together with a shrewd man of business, who had been accustomed to mix with
  all sorts and conditions of passengers. Cleanor had felt from the first that
  it would be useless to maintain the pretence, and he was prepared to abandon
  it if he should be challenged. But he was not prepared to tell his true
  story. He had devised what he could not help thinking a very plausible
  substitute for it.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, my good friend," he said, "I am not a pedlar. Still,
  I hope to do a good stroke of business in Carthage."</p>

  <p>"Business!" said the captain, opening his eyes wide. "I fancy this is a
  poor time for business there."</p>

  <p>"For buying, doubtless&mdash;I suppose they have to keep all their money
  for food&mdash;but not for selling. That is what I am after. I have had a
  commission from someone whose name I must not mention to buy books."</p>

  <p>"Books!" repeated the old sailor in unfeigned astonishment; "who in the
  world wants to buy books?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cleanor, "there are people who have the taste. There are some
  very valuable things of the kind in Carthage, taken, most of them, from Greek
  cities in Sicily. My employer thought it a good opportunity for picking up
  some bargains, and he has made it worth my while to go. You see, books are
  not like gold and jewels. Most people don't see anything in them. You
  yourself, though you have seen a good deal of the world, could not understand
  anyone buying them. I am not likely, you see, to be interfered with."</p>

  <p>The sailor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "everyone to his taste. However, now I understand how it
  is that you don't talk like other pedlars. Good luck go with you!"</p>

  <p>The captain was right in supposing that the sea would be clear in the wake
  of the Roman squadron. He now matured a very bold design, which wanted for
  its successful accomplishment only one element of good fortune, an absolutely
  favourable wind. The <i>Sea-mew</i> was one of the fastest sailers in the
  Mediterranean, and with her own wind, which was a point or so off aft, could
  do what she liked even with a well-manned ship of war. The captain's plan was
  to hang closely, but just out of range, on the skirts of the Roman squadron
  as they neared their destination. This he could do without difficulty. Twenty
  galleys presented a larger object to him than he to them, and he reckoned,
  with a confidence that was not misplaced, that they would not keep a very
  careful look-out aft. If a solitary sail was to heave in sight for a moment
  it would probably attract no attention.</p>

  <p>What was wanted was the right wind, and this, to his great joy, he got
  just when it was wanted. The breeze, which for some hours had been due north,
  shifted to W.N.W. The weather thickened a little, and to make the lucky
  combination complete, the voyage came to an end a little after nightfall. The
  <i>Sea-mew</i>, which for some hours had been keeping, under shelter of the
  failing light, within two miles of the Roman squadron, now came up close to
  the rearward galley. In the preoccupation of the time she was practically
  unobserved. The <i>Sea-mew</i> was built almost on war-ship lines, and was
  flying Roman colours. No one certainly supposed for a moment that she was an
  Alexandrian blockade-runner.</p>

  <p>Two hours afterwards she was safe in the harbour of Carthage, and the
  captain&mdash;he was owner as well as master&mdash;had realized a handsome
  fortune. He had shipped one hundred and fifty tons of wheat and as much
  barley at Alexandria, the wheat at one mina and a half per ton, and the
  barley for half as much, and he now sold the wheat for eight and the barley
  for five minas per ton. The crew had a fourth of the gross profits divided
  between them, but enough was left to enable the captain to give up this very
  perilous kind of business for good and all.</p>

  <p>"If I tempt the gods again after this I deserve to be crucified," he said
  to his chief officer; and he kept his word.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; IN SORE NEED</h2>

  <p class="first">CLEANOR succeeded in landing without attracting, as far as
  he knew, any observation. He lent a hand to the disembarking of the cargo of
  the <i>Sea-mew</i>, and after going to and fro between the ship and the
  warehouse some half-dozen times, quietly slipped away. It was now far on
  towards midnight. The rest of the night he spent in a shed. This gave him
  shelter; of food he had been careful to provide as large a supply as he could
  conveniently carry. He foresaw an immediate use for it.</p>

  <p>Rising&mdash;it cannot be said waking, as he scarcely slept during the
  whole night&mdash;as soon as the earliest light of dawn made its way into his
  resting-place, he made his way out of the inclosure which surrounded the
  docks by an exit which he had observed during his sojourn in the city, and
  had noted for possible use in the future. He was still fortunate enough not
  to be seen.</p>

  <p>This done, he soon made his way to the street where he remembered the
  house of his foster-mother, Theoxena, to be situated. It was still early
  morning, and but very few persons were about, these being almost entirely
  women, who were fetching water from the public fountain at the end of the
  street. He was not long in recognizing among these his foster- mother, and it
  went to his heart to see how pale and wasted she looked, and how slowly and
  painfully she moved under the slight burden of the pitcher which she carried
  upon her shoulder.</p>

  <p>He was careful not to betray himself by look or movement, for he was
  anxious to know whether his disguise was successful. If her eyes, sharpened
  by a love that was almost as strong as a mother's, did not discover him, he
  felt that he was safe, and on this not only his own life but the power to
  help others depended. He passed her slowly, exaggerating a little the limp
  caused by his lameness. She looked at him twice, the second time, he thought,
  with a momentary awakening of interest, which, however, died away almost as
  soon as it appeared.</p>

  <p>And now chance gave him a fully convincing proof of how completely she had
  failed to recognize him. At the very moment of his passing she made a slight
  stumble, her feebleness probably causing her to drag her feet. The pitcher
  shook upon her shoulder, and was in imminent danger of falling. Cleanor
  caught it with his hand, and steadied it till she had recovered herself. She
  looked at him with a little smile of thanks, murmured a few words of
  acknowledgment of his help, and passed on, in what was evidently complete
  ignorance of his identity.</p>

  <p>This was proof enough for Cleanor. Looking round and hastily satisfying
  himself that there was no one near, he murmured "Theoxena". She started and
  looked at him, but still without recognition, for his voice was disguised.
  The art of doing this was an accomplishment in which he was almost perfect;
  and indeed, the most elaborate dressing up of features and figure is of but
  little avail without the disguised voice.</p>

  <p>"What, mother Theoxena," he added in his, natural tones, "don't you know
  your son?"</p>

  <p>In a moment her face beamed with delighted recognition. Pressing his
  finger on his lips to enjoin silence, he stepped up to her door, which,
  happily, was close at hand. Had it taken her more than two or three steps to
  reach it she must have fallen in the street. As it was, he had almost to lift
  her across the threshold, and to put her in one of the two chairs which
  formed part of the very scanty furniture of the room. Seeing that she wanted
  help, he ventured to call out the name of Daphne.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds the girl appeared. She was dressing, and had been about
  to bind up her hair when she was startled by the sudden call. Her
  locks&mdash;cut short, the reader will remember, to furnish the string of a
  bow&mdash;had grown enough to fall over her shoulders, and were even more
  luxuriant and brilliant than ever. But her face was a piteous contrast to
  their splendour&mdash;so pale, so wasted, so worn with suffering was it. The
  eyes, which had haunted the young man's memory, looked larger than before, so
  shrunk were her cheeks, and their look was pathetic beyond expression. She
  seemed scarcely to observe the presence of a stranger, but flew to her
  mother's side and busied herself with the task of restoring her to
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>When Theoxena began to revive, Cleanor put a few drops of a strong cordial
  wine which he carried in a flask between her lips, and had the pleasure of
  seeing a faint tinge of colour show itself in her cheeks. In a few minutes
  more she was sufficiently recovered to sit up. Cleanor would not permit her
  to talk.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," he said; "you are not strong enough yet. You must be
  satisfied for the present with seeing me alive and well. The rest we can
  postpone. Do you think she could eat something?" he went on, turning to the
  girl.</p>

  <p>Poor Daphne's eyes filled with tears. "We have nothing in the house, sir,"
  she said. "We had a little crust of rye-bread at noon yesterday, but she said
  that she was not hungry, and made me eat nearly all of it."</p>

  <p>Cleanor was horrified. He had expected to find them in great want, but
  this actual starvation was worse than he had looked for. He glanced hastily
  round the room. He had already noticed that it was very bare. He now saw that
  it had been stripped of almost everything. Daphne observed his look, and
  explained.</p>

  <p>"We have had to sell nearly all the furniture for food, and oh, sir, they
  give so little for the things! I know that money is very scarce, and the
  dealers are quite besieged with people who want to sell their furniture and
  clothes, but I can't help thinking that they cheat me because I am a girl and
  cannot help myself. Six days ago I sold mother's bed for eight
  drachmas&mdash;I remember her telling me that it cost thirty&mdash;and the
  eight were only enough to buy two rye-loaves and two anchovies. Poor mother
  does find it so hard to eat the bread alone. These lasted us till yesterday.
  We should have had nothing but for the old man who lives next door.</p>

  <p>He had a grandson who used to play with our little Cephalus. The dear
  little boy died about a month ago, and the old man always will make us have
  what he calls the child's portion. It has been getting to be very small
  lately, for the old man's pension is not large, and money buys less and less
  every day. But I don't know what we should have done without it."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cleanor, "you will have me to help you now. I suppose, by the
  way, you remember who I am?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied the girl; "it was you that were so kind to us about
  Cephalus."</p>

  <p>"You ought to have remembered, then, to call me not 'sir'but brother; or,
  better still, Cleanor. But now about food. This will be better than nothing
  for the present."</p>

  <p>He produced from the pack which he carried some twice-baked bread,
  something like what we call biscuit, and some strips of dried goat's flesh.
  It was pitiful to see how the girl tried to hide the eager look which would
  come into her eyes at the sight of the food. The elder woman had almost
  ceased to care for life, but youth protests against suffering and will make
  its voice heard.</p>

  <p>The meal was not abundant. Cleanor's prudence restricted the supply,
  because he feared the reaction after a long period of starvation. When it was
  finished he said, "Now, let us see what is to be done."</p>

  <p>"We heard you were dead," began Theoxena&mdash; "killed, too, so they
  said, by our own people. The gods be thanked a thousand times that it isn't
  true!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cleanor, "that is past and done with. We won't talk about
  what other people have done or tried to do. Here I am alive, and hoping to
  keep alive in spite of them, and I have come to see what I can do for
  you."</p>

  <p>"But what do you mean?" cried the woman. "Where have you been? Where do
  you come from?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Cleanor, "I came from Egypt last of all, and before that I
  was in the Roman camp, where I found, I am bound to say, very kind
  friends."</p>

  <p>"But have you really come back into this doomed city&mdash;for doomed it
  certainly is&mdash;when you were actually safe and among friends
  outside?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have, if you must know. And what else could I do? You don't
  suppose I was going to leave you to perish here while I was safe and
  comfortable outside?"</p>

  <p>"But why? What claim&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Do you ask me what claim? You are my mother, Daphne here is my sister. I
  have friends, and kind friends too, but you are all the home I have. So that
  is disposed of. I have come back to get you safe out of Carthage, and we must
  consider how that is to be done. But before I say anything more, how about
  the little boy?"</p>

  <p>"I have never seen him, but I have heard several times&mdash;the last time
  was only four days ago&mdash;that he is well. Oh! how can I thank you
  enough?"</p>

  <p>"We'll talk about thanks another time, dear mother," said Cleanor with a
  smile. "We must think about the present."</p>

  <p>"I hear," said Theoxena, "that everyone is to move into the Upper City.
  Hasdrubal thinks that there is no chance of defending the rest. I would as
  soon&mdash;I would sooner stop here and die. But you see it is not only dying
  that one has to fear. That would be easy enough. We must go; yet where shall
  we find a corner to hide ourselves in, or a crust of bread to eat?"</p>

  <p>"Leave all that to me," said Cleanor. "If it can be done, I will do it;
  and I think," he added after a moment's pause, "I think that I see a
  way."</p>

  <p>As he spoke there flashed through his mind the thought that he might find
  help where he had found it before. If the physician who had served him in the
  matter of the little Cephalus were still alive, no more skilful, and, he was
  sure, no more willing auxiliary could he discovered.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he said to Theoxena, "you and Daphne, where you are, and don't
  show yourselves more than you can help. Will the provisions I have here serve
  you for a day or so?" And he emptied the contents of his pack upon the
  table.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled. She and Daphne had contrived to live for not a few days
  upon far less.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is abundance."</p>

  <p>"Till to-morrow, then," cried the young man with a gaiety which he did not
  feel. If the physician should be unable to help, or should have died!</p>

  <p>Happily this misfortune was spared him. Cleanor found the man, and, thanks
  to his knowledge of his habits, without loss of time. It was still an hour
  short of noon when he saw the leech coming out of a casemate in the wall,
  which he was accustomed to visit at that hour for the purpose of inspecting
  the newly wounded.</p>

  <p>"This is a good sight," cried the physician. "What Æsculapius has brought
  you back from the dead? They told me that you were killed, and I feared that
  they had only too good reason for knowing that it was true."</p>

  <p>"That," said the Greek, "is a long story, and will keep. As usual, I want
  your help."</p>

  <p>"You are not ill?&mdash;no, I have never seen you look better. What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>Cleanor told him his story.</p>

  <p>The physician looked grave, and after a pause he said: "You are wanting
  for your two friends what a couple of hundred thousands of people in this
  city are wanting&mdash;a safe place of shelter. Yet it can be found; all
  things can be found, if one knows where to look for them. But it will be
  costly, very costly." And be looked inquisitively at the young Greek, who
  certainly, in his pedlar's dress, did not look as if he had the command of
  boundless wealth.</p>

  <p>Cleanor understood the look, and whispered a few words in the old man's
  ear.</p>

  <p>"That is capital," he said with an admiring glance. "You are certainly a
  young man of business."</p>

  <p>Cleanor had, in fact, brought with him, in view of any possible
  necessities that might arise, an ample supply of means in the most portable,
  and therefore most valuable form that wealth under the circumstances of the
  time could possibly bear. Gold, precious as it is, is not very portable. A
  really wealthy man would require a whole caravan to transport his fortune
  from one place to another if it were in the shape of gold. Paper
  money&mdash;for the ancient world did business by bills of exchange very much
  as we do&mdash;was not available. The commercial credit of Carthage had
  collapsed for ever.</p>

  <p>The one readily available vehicle for wealth was precious stones. These
  had risen in Carthage to an almost incredible price. Sooner or later,
  everyone felt, the city would be taken. When that should happen, gold would
  be almost useless. The one chance of preserving it, and that but a slight
  one, would be to bury it. That might hide it from the enemy, but might very
  probably also hide it from the owner. Jewels, on the other hand, could be
  carried anyhow. If a man could contrive to escape at all, he could also
  contrive to escape with a fortune, so invested, about him. Cleanor,
  accordingly, was now utilizing this part of the old king's bounty. He carried
  round his waist, next to his skin, a slender girdle- purse in which he had
  stored a number of jewels. This he was resolved not to lose except with his
  life. While he kept this, he felt that he could do anything that money could
  accomplish.</p>

  <p>"Come home with me," said the physician, "and talk this matter over. You
  are best out of sight, for someone might recognize you in spite of your
  disguise, and that would be very awkward indeed."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25"></a>XXV. &mdash; A REFUGE IN THE STORM</h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU have the necessary means, I understand," said the
  physician to Cleanor, when the two were seated together safe from
  interruption. "Now for my plan. The only safe hiding-place will be one of the
  temples. Now, there are three temples which would answer our purpose, I mean
  three that would be specially suitable on account of the number of private
  apartments which are attached to them. There is Æsculapius in the citadel,
  Apollo in the arsenal, and Baal Hammon in the Upper City; but that, of
  course, you know. On the whole, I am inclined to Apollo in the arsenal, and I
  will tell you why. Æsculapius is the strongest place in Carthage, and it is
  there that the last stand will be made. There are some desperate men who will
  hold on to the last extremity, and perish rather than surrender. There are
  some of the old nobles who are too proud to live under the rule of Rome, and
  there are the deserters, who know that pardon is impossible. Hasdrubal
  himself gives out that he intends to cast in his lot with them, but I doubt
  him; he is a cur. Now, I know as a matter of fact that preparations have been
  made for holding Æsculapius as long as possible. And when it becomes
  impossible, then it will be destroyed. I know these Carthaginians. Drive them
  to extremities, and they will behave as the scorpion between two fires.
  Clearly, then, Æsculapius is not the place for non-combatants. Then at Baal
  Hammon there are too many priests, and they are a bad lot. That fellow whom
  you bribed about the little boy was very useful to you, but then he is a
  great scoundrel. In that matter you could trust him, because he had put his
  own neck in the noose; but in this you could not. You see he might easily
  make double gain out of it&mdash;a heavy sum from you for keeping your
  friends safe, and another sum for selling them to the Romans. No, you had
  better have nothing to do with Baal Hammon and its crew. Then there remains
  Apollo in the arsenal. There are only two priests there. There's the old man,
  who is almost in his dotage, and the son, who is a decent fellow with a
  really excellent wife. He is not above taking money, but he will not be
  extortionate. She&mdash;poor woman, she has just lost her only
  child&mdash;would take in your friends out of pure kindness. Anyhow, she will
  do her best for them. You had better leave the matter to me, for the less you
  are seen the better. Now, what do you say?"</p>

  <p>"I am only too glad," said Cleanor, "to leave the matter in your hands.
  How much money will be wanted, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"It can hardly be less than two hundred gold pieces," replied the
  physician.</p>

  <p>"These," said Cleanor, as he produced some rubies and emeralds, with a
  rose diamond, small, but of peculiarly brilliant lustre, "have been valued at
  a talent by a very good judge. Your friend the priest will get, if he wishes
  it, another opinion as to their value, but I feel sure that the price is not
  too high. That is what was actually offered me as a first bid by Raphael, the
  first jeweler in Alexandria, and, as you know, a man does not offer his
  highest price in his first bid."</p>

  <p>"A talent!" said the physician, who was himself something of a connoisseur
  in precious stones, and had been examining them with obvious admiration. "A
  talent, indeed! Unconscionable scoundrel! He ought to have said three. This
  diamond alone is worth a talent, and more too. Well, I will see to the affair
  at once, for there is no time to be lost. You stop here, and make yourself at
  home."</p>

  <p>About noon the physician reappeared. "Everything is settled," he said. "I
  have saved your diamond for you. It was really too much to give. The rubies
  and emeralds were quite sufficient. Mago&mdash;that is the younger priest's
  name&mdash;is a good judge of jewels, and was quite satisfied. You are to
  meet him to-night at the upper end of the street where your friends live, and
  take him to their house, and introduce him. He will take the women in charge,
  and conduct them to the temple. He has the means of getting them through one
  of the arsenal gates without any questions being asked. I am to hand over the
  price to-morrow, when the first part of the business shall have been
  finished. For the rest you must trust him. Indeed, you have no other choice;
  but he is not a bad fellow, and, as I said, his wife is absolutely
  loyal."</p>

  <p>By midnight Theoxena and Daphne were safely lodged in a little chamber
  adjoining that occupied by the priest and his wife.</p>

  <p>The change was not effected a day too soon. Early on the following morning
  the Roman armies were seen to be in motion, and peremptory orders were issued
  that the Lower City was to be evacuated. Many of the inhabitants had
  anticipated it, and had found such shelter as they could in the Upper City.
  But thousands had lingered behind, hoping against hope that the change might
  be avoided, or simply paralysed by despair. Destitute as many of them were,
  both of means and friends, they stayed only because it was easier to stay
  than to move.</p>

  <p>Even now some doggedly remained behind. The troops had instructions to
  drive them out by force, and they attempted for a time to carry out this
  order. But they were met with a passive resistance that baffled them. Some
  would not, some could not be stirred from the homes to which they were
  accustomed, and which at least afforded them a present shelter. Still, there
  was an overpowering rush of panic-stricken fugitives. The streets leading to
  the Upper City were crowded up to and beyond the utmost limit of their
  capacity. At the gates the press was something terrible. All night long the
  human stream flowed ceaselessly on; when the morning broke it was still dense
  and strong. Scipio, fully aware that the helpless crowd would be a source of
  weakness rather than strength to the besieged, had strictly forbidden
  pursuit. But for this fact, any number might have been killed or
  captured.</p>

  <p>Still, the arsenal itself was not to remain long undisturbed. To abandon
  it to the besiegers was to acknowledge that the fall of the whole city was
  only a question of time, for this sufficient reason, if for no other, that no
  fresh supplies could possibly be introduced. Up to this time a certain amount
  of food had been brought in, as we have seen in the case of the
  <i>Sea-mew</i>. The supply was small and irregular, but it had been
  sufficient to replenish the stores of the garrison. Now and then something,
  had been spared for the wants of the general population. All this would come
  to an end when the port fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>

  <p>But Hasdrubal had really no choice. He could not hope to defend the
  fortifications of the arsenal with the forces at his command. He had to
  concentrate his strength within the smaller compass of the Upper City.
  Accordingly, in the night following the abandonment of the Lower City, the
  arsenal was evacuated by its garrison. The last detachment to leave was
  instructed to set the stores on fire. Nor was this done an hour too soon. The
  necessity which constrained the Carthaginian commander to this course of
  action had not escaped the notice of Scipio. Laelius, the ablest of his
  lieutenants, was making his way into the arsenal&mdash;which he found,
  somewhat to his surprise, undefended&mdash;at the very time when the garrison
  was leaving it at the opposite end.</p>

  <p>The physician was too busy with his work to pay much attention to military
  affairs, and Cleanor having accomplished, as far as was possible for the
  present, the purpose for which he had returned to Carthage, did not risk
  recognition and capture by venturing out of doors. It was with surprise,
  therefore, as well as dismay, that he learned what had happened. The first
  thing that he saw on looking out of his window the following morning was the
  area of the arsenal swarming with Roman soldiers. Some were endeavouring,
  under the direction of their officers, to quench the flames in the
  store-houses; not a few, it was easy to see, were busy in collecting plunder;
  the Temple of Apollo was evidently one of the chief objects of
  attraction.</p>

  <p>It was an anxious moment for Cleanor, but if he could have seen what was
  going on in the temple, he would almost have despaired of the safety of
  Theoxena and her daughter. The fact was that the Roman soldiery, for all the
  strictness of discipline to which it had been habituated by Scipio, was for
  the time completely out of hand. The siege had been long and tedious, and the
  perils, so far, out of all proportion to the prizes. And now, almost for the
  first time for three years, these men, starving, so to speak, for booty,
  found themselves within reach of what seemed enormous wealth.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the temple stood a figure of Apollo, about double the
  size of life. It had the appearance of being of gold; in truth, it was of
  wood, covered with massive plates of gold. The throne on which it was seated,
  the lattice-work on either side, and the canopy above its head were of the
  same metal, and these were absolutely solid. The weight of the whole was
  afterwards reckoned at about two hundred and fifty of our tons. Possibly this
  was an exaggeration; but the treasure was unquestionably very large. So
  large, indeed, was it that the first impression of the soldiers when they
  burst into the shrine was that the whole was of some base metal gilded.</p>

  <p>Then the discovery was made. A Roman in mere mischief aimed a blow with
  his sword at the trellis-work which surrounded the statue. Picking up the
  fragment which he had thus lopped off, more in curiosity than with any
  definite expectation of finding treasure, he was astonished by its weight.
  Then the truth dawned upon him.</p>

  <p>"By Pollux!" he cried, "it must be gold."</p>

  <p>The scene which followed was one new to Roman experience. All Rome, it
  might almost be said all Italy, hardly contained so much treasure. Since the
  day when the soldiers of Alexander burst into the treasury of Persepolis, and
  saw what the wealthiest monarchy of the world had been accumulating for
  centuries, such a sight had never met human eyes. It overpowered the solid
  strength of Roman discipline; with a frantic cry the men precipitated
  themselves on the spoil. The centurions, who with the instinct of command
  endeavoured to keep them back, were thrust roughly aside. One of them, who
  ventured to use the vine cudgel which he carried by way of enforcing his
  orders, was levelled to the ground by a blow of the fist. The tribune in
  command of the detachment, when he ventured to interfere, met with no more
  respect. In less than half an hour the statue was stripped of its costly
  covering, and the shrine was hacked to pieces.</p>

  <p>Then the strange passion of destruction, which seems always to follow
  close after any great mutinous outbreak, seized upon the men. Possibly they
  were carried away by a frantic desire to abolish the very scene of their
  offence. Anyhow, the temple was for a few minutes in the most imminent danger
  of being burned. A soldier thrust a torch into the fire which was burning
  near the great central altar, and threw it all blazing among the curtains
  which covered one of the walls.</p>

  <p>At this critical moment Scipio himself appeared upon the scene. His
  presence seemed to recall the frantic soldiery to themselves. His first care
  was to see that the fire was extinguished. With the plunder he did not at the
  moment attempt to deal; he reserved that matter for a cooler moment. It was
  one of the secrets of his success that he never strained his power. But order
  was restored and firmly enforced. A guard was put in charge of the building.
  This was to be changed at fixed intervals. It was to have, meanwhile, its
  full share of all prize-money that might be earned on exactly the same scale
  as actual combatants. After this the temple and its inmates were as safe as
  any place or persons could be at such a time.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE STORMING OF THE UPPER CITY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE actual fortifications of the Upper City did not offer
  any serious resistance to the assailants. They were of extreme antiquity, and
  were not only greatly decayed, but were inadequate to meet, even had they
  been in the best condition, the improved methods of attack which had been
  introduced since the time of their erection. Some attempt had been made to
  put them into repair within the last few months, but to very little purpose.
  Nothing short of a complete reconstruction would have been of any practical
  use. The Roman battering-rams had not been at work for a day before it became
  evident that several breaches would speedily be made in the walls. In fact,
  so many weak spots had been revealed, that even the most determined and
  powerful garrison could not have hoped to make them all good. In the course
  of the night the whole line was evacuated.</p>

  <p>Still, Carthage was not to be taken without a desperate struggle. Twice
  already had her mother-city Tyre defended herself with fury against
  assailants of overwhelming strength, and the world was to see a still more
  terrible scene of rage and madness some two centuries later, when the Hebrew
  people defended its last stronghold, Jerusalem, against the legions of Rome.
  The Carthaginians were now to show themselves not unworthy of these famous
  kinsfolk.</p>

  <p>The Upper City was penetrated by three streets, all of them built on steep
  inclines, and converging on the summit of the hill. On this the citadel
  stood, itself crowned by the famous Temple of Æsculapius. This was built on a
  rock, three sides of which displayed a sheer descent of some sixty feet,
  while the fourth was ascended by a long flight of steps. The three streets
  were built to suit the oriental taste, perhaps we should rather say the
  oriental need, which prefers shade to the circulation of air and light. They
  were so narrow that the inhabitants of opposite houses&mdash;the houses
  commonly inclined outward&mdash;could almost shake hands from their windows.
  The houses were not of equal height, but they were all lofty, sometimes
  having as many as seven or eight stories. At the back of these main
  thoroughfares was a wilderness of lanes and alleys, consisting for the most
  part of smaller houses, with now and then a paved yard or small garden.</p>

  <p>Up these streets the Romans had to force their way. Almost every house was
  a fortress which had to be separately attacked and separately taken. The
  first danger that had to be encountered was a shower of tiles and bricks from
  the roofs and upper stories. These missiles, heavy themselves, and falling
  with tremendous force from the lofty buildings, would have been terribly
  destructive, had not the assailants protected themselves by the formation of
  the testudo or tortoise. This was made by the men ranging their shields over
  their heads in a close impenetrable array, under cover of which they broke
  down the doors of house after house. Sometimes even the testudo reeled under
  the shock of some more than usually heavy mass; more than once it was
  actually broken when the defending party contrived to detach and send down
  upon it the whole of a parapet. Whenever this happened no small loss of life
  was the result.</p>

  <p>When an entrance had been forced into the house, every storey became the
  scene of a fresh conflict. Driven at last to the roof, the defenders would
  sometimes prefer to hurl themselves down to the street below rather than fall
  into the hands of the enemy. Some would take a desperate leap across the
  space that separated them from the houses opposite; others crossed on bridges
  of planks or doors which they hastily made, or, in some cases, had prepared
  in anticipation.</p>

  <p>It is needless to say that a conflict of such a kind was fought with the
  greatest ferocity. It was a struggle, for the most part, between a people and
  an army. The inhabitants, seldom, if ever, protected by armour, and furnished
  with the weapons that chance supplied, often, indeed, reduced to nothing more
  effective than sticks or household implements, fought desperately against
  well-protected, well-armed, well-disciplined men. The women were even more
  frenzied than the men. Driven to bay, they flew like wild-cats at the Romans,
  and bit and scratched till they were slain or disabled. There was no question
  of quarter; it was not even asked. The assailants, as they slowly advanced,
  winning their way yard by yard, left a lifeless desolation behind them, with
  the dead lying as they had fallen, on every staircase and in every
  chamber.</p>

  <p>This battle of the streets lasted with unabated fury for six days. The
  besiegers, of course, fought in relays; there were three detachments, and
  each had its regular time of service, four hours twice in the day, for of
  course no cessation of the attack was possible. One man allowed himself no
  rest, and this one man was Scipio. During the whole of the six days he never
  slept, or, at least, never composed himself to sleep, for nature would
  sometimes assert itself, untiring as was the spirit which dominated his
  physical frame, and he could not help a brief slumber as he sat at his meals.
  These he took as chance gave him the opportunity. They were hurried repasts
  of the simplest kind&mdash;a piece of dried flesh, a crust of bread, or a
  biscuit, with now and then a bunch of raisins. His drink was rigidly limited
  to water, for in battle he always acted on the principle which made Hector
  refuse the wine-cup which his mother proffered him in an interval of
  battle.</p>

  <p>At sunset on the sixth day the Upper City was practically held by the
  Romans. Nothing but the citadel remained to be taken, and that was so arduous
  an undertaking that the attack was necessarily postponed till the troops had
  had some rest.</p>

  <p>But the spirit of the Carthaginians was at last broken. Just as the troops
  told off for the first assault had finished mustering, and before the
  trumpets had sounded the signal for the advance, a procession, headed by a
  herald who carried a flag of truce in his hand, was seen to be descending the
  steps that led from the temple of Æsculapius. Lost to sight for a short time
  as it came under cover of the outer wall of the citadel, it next became
  visible as it issued from one of the gates. Scipio, who was about to address
  his troops, went forward to meet the newcomers. Their leader, whose style and
  title were given by the herald as chief priest of the temple of Æsculapius,
  addressed him, his words being interpreted by a Roman prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Leader of the armies of Rome," so ran the speech, "the gods have given
  thy country the final victory over her rival. Four centuries ago Rome felt it
  to be an honour to be acknowledged by Carthage as an ally on equal terms.
  Since then there has been continued rivalry and frequent war between the two
  nations. More than once it has seemed likely that the Fates had decreed that
  the seat of empire should be in Africa rather than in Italy. But this was not
  their will. We have long been convinced that we were not to rule; we now
  perceive that we are not even to be permitted to exist. But though it is
  necessary for the honour, if not for the safety, of Rome, that Carthage
  should be destroyed, it is not necessary that a multitude of innocent
  persons, whose sole offence is to have been, born within the walls of a
  doomed city, should also perish. There are some, a few thousands out of many,
  who have, it is true, committed the offence of defending their country; these
  also implore your mercy. That they can resist your attack they acknowledge to
  be impossible; but they can at least claim this merit, that by a prompt
  surrender they will save the lives of some of your soldiers. Your nation, man
  of Rome, has been ready beyond all others to show mercy to the conquered, and
  your family, Scipio, has been conspicuous in this as in all other virtues. Be
  worthy, we beseech you, of your country, your house, and yourself."</p>

  <p>It was without a moment's hesitation that Scipio replied to this harangue.
  Nor had he to use the services of an interpreter. With that indefatigable
  energy which distinguished him he had employed the scanty leisure allowed by
  his duties to learn the Carthaginian language, of which at the beginning of
  the siege he had been as ignorant as were the rest of his countrymen.</p>

  <p>"I will not use many words, for time presses, and there is much to be
  done. The multitude of unarmed persons may come forth without fear. Their
  lives are assured to them. Nor do we bear any enmity against brave men who
  have fought against us. They shall not be harmed. I except only from my offer
  of mercy those who have betrayed their country by deserting it."</p>

  <p>The answer had scarcely been spoken before a huge multitude, to whom its
  purport had probably been communicated by some preconcerted signal, poured
  out from the gates. Seldom has a more piteous sight been seen. With faces wan
  with famine, and clothed, for the most part, in squalid rags, the long lines
  of old men, women, and children defiled before the Roman general as he stood
  surrounded by his staff. True to his gentle and kindly nature, he busied
  himself in making provision for their immediate wants. The whole
  number&mdash;there were fifty thousand in all, a great crowd, it is true, but
  pitiably small in comparison with the supposed total of non- combatants when
  the siege began&mdash;was divided into companies, each of which was assigned
  to the commissariat department of one or other of the legions. At the same
  time instructions were given to the officers in charge of the stores that
  their immediate necessities&mdash;and many of them were actually
  starving&mdash;should be relieved.</p>

  <p>The non-combatants thus disposed of, the soldiers that had surrendered
  followed. There may have been some six thousand in all, of whom five-sixths
  were mercenaries, one-sixth only native Carthaginians. They were in much
  better case than the rest of the population; in fact, as far as provisions
  were concerned, they had not been subjected to any hardship. The mercenaries
  had, for the most part, an indifferent look. It was depressing, doubtless, to
  have been serving for now three years an unsuccessful master, and to have
  missed the good pay which they might have earned elsewhere. But this was one
  of the chances of their profession, and they might hope to recoup themselves
  for their loss by another and more fortunate speculation. The Carthaginian
  minority were in a different temper. There was no future for them. Their
  country was gone, and if the love of life, which asserts itself even over the
  fiercest and bitterest pride, had bent their haughty temper to supplicate for
  mercy, it could do nothing more. Each man as he passed in front of the
  general laid down his arms upon the ground. These, again, were piled in
  heaps, to be carried off in due time to the stores in the Roman camp.</p>

  <p>This business was just completed when a solitary figure was seen to issue
  from one of the gates in the citadel walls, and hurriedly to approach the
  Roman lines. As he ran he was struck by a missile from the walls. The blow
  levelled him to the ground, but he regained his feet in the course of one or
  two minutes, and hastened on, though with a somewhat limping gait. It was
  observed that he was dressed as a slave, and, as he came nearer, that his
  face was so closely muffled that his features could not be recognized.
  Nevertheless, his figure, which was short and corpulent, seemed to many to be
  familiar. Reaching the Roman lines, he threw himself at Scipio's feet, caught
  him by the knees, and in broken Greek begged for his life. The general,
  stretching forth his hand, raised him from the ground. It was Hasdrubal, the
  commander-in-chief of the armies of Carthage.</p>

  <p>A murmur of disgust at his poltroonery ran through the ranks. Here and
  there the kinsmen or comrades of the unhappy prisoners whom he had done to
  death in so barbarous a fashion a few months before gave vent to more
  menacing expressions of anger. Scipio silenced these manifestations of
  feeling by an imperative gesture of command.</p>

  <p>"Your life is spared," he said. "See that you make a due return for the
  boon."</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed that the Roman general was disposed to regard with
  any kind of leniency Hasdrubal's baseness and barbarity. It was from policy
  that he spared the miserable creature's life. In the first place, it was the
  custom, from which it would be injudicious to depart, to make the king or
  chief general of a conquered people an essential part of the triumph which
  would celebrate the victory. Secondly, he was aware that the prisoner would
  be useful in many ways, that there were important matters about which he
  could give the best, or, it might be, the only available information.</p>

  <p>As to the boon of life, it seemed to his own noble nature to be a very
  small thing indeed. For himself he felt that, had such a situation been
  possible, he would far sooner have died than survive to face such shame and
  ignominy: the craven clinging to life which dominates such mean natures as
  Hasdrubal's was simply incomprehensible to Scipio. But if he despised
  Hasdrubal while he spared him, there were others among the Carthaginian
  leaders for whom he felt a genuine admiration and respect, and to whom he was
  willing to offer honourable terms of surrender.</p>

  <p>"Where," he asked Hasdrubal, "are your colleagues in command, and the
  chief magistrates?"</p>

  <p>"They are in the temple of Æsculapius," replied the Carthaginian.</p>

  <p>"Think you that they will be willing to surrender? They are brave men, and
  have done their best, and they shall be honourably treated."</p>

  <p>"I know not what they intend," muttered the fugitive, with as much shame
  as it was in his nature to feel.</p>

  <p>"I will at least try them," said Scipio, and he advanced towards the
  citadel, followed by some of his staff. Hasdrubal, much against his will, was
  constrained to accompany them.</p>

  <p>A number of figures could be seen on the roof of the temple, which, as has
  been explained, formed the summit of the citadel. As soon as he came within
  earshot of the place he bade one of the prisoners step forward and
  communicate his ultimatum to what may be called the garrison of the
  temple.</p>

  <p><i>"Scipio offers to all free-born Carthaginian citizens, life on
  honourable terms. To all those who have deserted he promise a fair trial, so
  that if they can show any just cause for having left their country, even they
  may not despair of safety."</i></p>

  <p>To this appeal no answer was made. After a while, as Scipio and his
  attendants waited for a reply, thin curls of smoke were seen to rise from the
  temple. Next a woman, leading a young boy by either hand, approached the edge
  of the roof. She was clothed in a flowing robe of crimson, confined at the
  waist by a broad golden girdle. Her long hair, which streamed far below her
  waist, was bound round her temples by a circlet of diamonds that flashed
  splendidly in the sun.</p>

  <p>"By Baal," cried the Carthaginian prisoner who delivered Scipio's message,
  "it is the Lady Salamo herself."</p>

  <p>"Who is it, say you?" asked Scipio.</p>

  <p>"The Lady Salamo," answered the man, "the wife of my lord the
  general."</p>

  <p>It was indeed the wife of Hasdrubal.</p>

  <p>"Man of Rome," she began in a clear, penetrating voice, which made itself
  heard far and wide, addressing herself to Scipio, who was conspicuous in the
  scarlet cloak worn by generals commanding armies, "man of Rome, to thee there
  comes no blame from gods or men. Carthage was the enemy of your country, and
  thou hast conquered it. But on this Hasdrubal, this traitor who hath been
  false to his fatherland, to his gods, to me,&mdash;whose shame it is to have
  been his wife,&mdash;and to his children, may the gods of Carthage wreak
  their vengeance! And thou, Scipio, I charge thee, fail not to be their
  instrument."</p>

    <p class="caption">The Lady Salamo defies the Romans.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>She then turned to Hasdrubal.</p>

  <p>"Villain," she cried, "and liar, and coward, as for me and these children,
  we shall find a fit burial in this fire;" and as she spoke a great flame
  sprung up for a moment among the gathering clouds of smoke; "but thou, that
  wast the chiefest man in Carthage, what dishonourable grave wilt thou find?
  This only I know, that neither thy children nor I will live to see thy
  disgrace."</p>

  <p>Turning from the wretched man with a gesture of contempt, she drew a
  dagger from her girdle and plunged it into the heart first of one then of the
  other of the two children who stood at her side. Then flinging the bloody
  weapon from her, she leapt into the midst of the flames, which by this time
  were rapidly gaining the mastery over the whole building. All her companions
  shared her fate. The Carthaginian nobles were too proud to live under the
  sway of Rome; the deserters were conscious of their guilt, or distrusted the
  justice of a Roman tribunal. Anyhow, not a single individual out of the
  desperate band to which Scipio had addressed his appeal availed himself of
  the opportunity. The temple of Æsculapius perished with all its inmates; and
  along with it was lost to Rome and to the world a vast treasury of
  wealth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; A PRECIOUS BOOK</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is time to explain what had happened to Cleanor while the
  events recorded in the last chapter were proceeding. He had remained within
  the physician's house during the six days' fighting in the streets. The house
  had been turned into something like a hospital, and the young Greek found
  plenty of employment in doing such services as a lay hand could render to his
  host's patients. The physician was naturally one of the deputation which, as
  has been described, waited on the conqueror on the morning of the seventh
  day, and he took his guest with him in the character of his assistant. Nor
  could Cleanor escape an emotion of relief to find himself again under Roman
  protection. It was a curious change from the feelings that had dominated him
  a few months before, but the constraining power of circumstances had been too
  much for him. His first care was to ascertain the fate of Theoxena and her
  daughter. Here it was necessary to proceed with caution. It would not be wise
  to make inquiries at random. The person whom he could most safely trust was
  Scipio, the young officer, whom he was, of course, anxious to see for other
  reasons. To his great delight he found that his friend was the officer in
  command of the guard to which the safety of the temple of Apollo in the
  arsenal had been committed.</p>

  <p>He found an opportunity of sending a message by a soldier who happened to
  be off duty for the time. Hardly an hour had elapsed when he received an
  answer. It ran thus:</p>

  <p><i>"A thousand congratulations. We had almost given you up for lost, only
  that the gods are manifestly determined to make up to you for some part at
  least of what you have suffered. Come at once: I have much to say to
  you."</i></p>

  <p>The meeting between the two friends was very affectionate. Cleanor,
  postponing the narrative of his own adventures to some future opportunity, at
  once took the young Roman officer into his confidence.</p>

  <p>"You may rest assured that your friends are safe. There has been a guard
  over the private apartments attached to the temple; and I have taken care to
  have trustworthy men, as I always should in such a case. But I can tell you
  that your friends have had a very narrow escape. If the general had not
  arrived just at the right time, the whole building would have been reduced to
  ashes."</p>

  <p>He then proceeded to relate the story which the reader has already heard.
  Cleanor listened with emotion that he could hardly conceal. How nearly had
  all his efforts been in vain! How narrowly had these two&mdash;who were all
  that remained to him of his old life&mdash;escaped destruction!</p>

  <p>Young Scipio's narrative was hardly finished when the conversation of the
  friends was interrupted by the arrival of an orderly bringing a message from
  the general. The official despatch, accompanied by a letter expressed in more
  familiar terms, ran thus:</p>

  <p><i>"I have learnt that a manuscript of the very highest value, which I
  have a special charge from the Senate and People of Rome to preserve, to wit,
  the Treatise of Hanno on Agriculture, has always been and is now in the
  custody of the priests of Apollo in the arsenal. I commission you, therefore,
  as officer commanding the guard of the said temple, to make inquiries of
  these same priests, and to take the book into your keeping, for which this
  present writing shall be your authority."</i></p>

  <p>The private letter was to this effect:</p>

  <p><i>"I have just learnt from Hasdrubal&mdash;and the information is so
  valuable that it almost reconciles me to halving had to spare the villain's
  life&mdash;that the precious book on Agriculture is to be found in the temple
  of which you have charge. Lose no time in getting it into your possession. It
  is supposed to contain secrets of the very greatest value. Anyhow, the
  authorities at home attach great importance to its preservation. To lose it
  would be a disaster. I can rely, I know, on your prudence and
  energy."</i></p>

  <p>"Cleanor, can you throw any light on this matter?" asked the Roman.</p>

  <p>"No," was the answer, "except to tell you what I know about the priests.
  There are two attached to the temple. One is an old man&mdash;almost, as I
  understand, in his dotage&mdash;whom I did not see; the other, his son,
  middle-aged, with whom I negotiated the affair of which I told you. That is
  absolutely all that I know, except that my friend the physician described the
  son as being on the whole an honourable man, who could be trusted the more
  implicitly the more one made it worth his while to be true."</p>

  <p>"That," said young Scipio, "is the man whom I saw the day that I took
  charge of the temple. He came to thank me. Since then he has never appeared.
  The services have been intermitted. They could hardly, indeed, have been
  carried on with all these soldiers in the place. He is the first person of
  whom to make inquiries."</p>

  <p>Scipio then summoned the centurion, who was nominally his second in
  command. The man was a veteran who had seen more than twenty
  campaigns&mdash;his first experience of war had been at Pydna under the great
  Æmilius Paullus&mdash;an excellent soldier in his way, but without much
  judgment in matters outside his own narrow sphere of experience.</p>

  <p>"Convey," young Scipio said to this officer, "a respectful request to the
  priest of the temple that he will favour me with an interview."</p>

  <p>In due course the priest appeared. It had been arranged between the
  friends that no reference should be made to the shelter given to the
  women.</p>

  <p>"I am informed," said Scipio, "that you have charge, as priest of this
  temple, of a certain book relating to agriculture."</p>

  <p>"You are right, sir," replied the man, "so far as this: there is such a
  book, and it is kept in this place; but it is not in my charge. My father is
  the priest, and it is in his custody."</p>

  <p>"Let me see your father, then," said the young officer.</p>

  <p>"Unhappily, sir," replied the man, "he is incapable of answering or even
  of hearing a question. He has been failing in mind for some time, and the
  events of the last few days have greatly affected him. This morning he had a
  stroke of paralysis, and has been unconscious ever since."</p>

  <p>"But you know," said Scipio, "where the book is?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," the priest answered, "I know, or, to put the matter
  more strictly, I believe that I know. But the secret has been very jealously
  guarded. It has been usual for the priest to hand over the charge formally to
  his successor when he felt himself failing. To meet the case that the priest
  might die suddenly, or fail for some other reason to communicate the secret
  in due course, the Shopetim were also in possession of it. They have also
  another copy of the treatise."</p>

  <p>"And where was that kept?" asked Scipio.</p>

  <p>"In the temple of Æsculapius, but in what part of the temple of course I
  know not."</p>

  <p>"If it was there it must have perished," said the Roman. "Nothing could
  have been left after the tremendous fire of yesterday. Lead the way and show
  us the place that you have in your mind."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done, sir," said the man. "But let me first see how it fares
  with my father. It is possible that he may yet revive."</p>

  <p>Permission was, of course, granted, and he went. Before many minutes he
  returned.</p>

  <p>"My father has passed away," he said in a low voice, "and without becoming
  conscious even for a moment; so the woman that was in attendance told me.
  Follow me, sir."</p>

  <p>He led the way down a flight of steps, and then along a passage to the
  chamber in which it terminated. The door was carefully concealed in the wall,
  with the surface of which it was entirely uniform. The priest, however, had
  no difficulty in opening it. He pressed a secret spring, and it opened."</p>

  <p>"This," he said, as they entered a small lofty room lighted from above,
  "is the priest's private chamber. The book should be somewhere here. But at
  this point my knowledge comes to an end."</p>

  <p>"If I might hazard a guess," said Cleanor, "the hiding-place is somewhere
  in the floor. One would naturally, perhaps, look for another secret door in
  the wall, hence it is likely that some other way of concealing it would be
  tried. Anyhow, let us begin with the floor."</p>

  <p>The place was easily, as it will be seen, too easily found. As soon as the
  matting which covered the floor was removed, it became evident that a part of
  the boarding had been recently moved.</p>

  <p>"That is it," exclaimed the four men&mdash;the centurion had accompanied
  the party&mdash;almost in the same breath.</p>

  <p>"I don't like the look of this," added Cleanor, whose quick Greek
  intelligence had promptly taken in the situation. "It has been taken."</p>

  <p>He was right. When the boarding was lifted, it revealed an empty space.
  All that remained was a wrapper of silk, which might very well have
  served&mdash;for there was nothing on it that absolutely indicated the
  fact&mdash;for a covering to the volume.</p>

  <p>"What is to be done now?" said Scipio, as the four looked at each other
  with faces full of blank disappointment.</p>

  <p>"My father," said the priest, after a short pause of reflection, "must
  have taken it away. He evidently did it in a hurry without carefully
  replacing the boards. He might have concealed the joining so well that it
  would have been very hard to find. See," and he put the covering back in such
  a way that the spot was absolutely undistinguishable from the rest of the
  floor. "This makes me sure that it has been done quite recently, and when he
  was not quite himself."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Cleanor, "whether by chance your guests could tell us
  anything about it?"</p>

  <p>"My guests!" cried the priest, vainly endeavouring to conceal his
  dismay.</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble yourself, my good friend," said Scipio with a smile. "My
  friend Cleanor has taken me into his confidence, and I think you have done
  very well in helping him in this matter. It is just possible that, as he
  suggests, the women may have seen something,&mdash;enough to give us a
  clue."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," said the priest. "The book was far too bulky to be easily
  destroyed. That I know, though I have never had it in my hands. But it may
  have been put away where it will be hard to find."</p>

  <p>"Cleanor," said Scipio, after a brief reflection, "will you go and see
  what you can find out? The priest will show you the way."</p>

  <p>Cleanor accordingly followed the priest to the apartment which had been
  assigned to Theoxena and her daughter. Only the elder woman was visible.
  Daphne, she assured Cleanor, after an exchange of affectionate greetings, was
  quite well, but was busy at the moment with some needlework. When questioned
  about the old priest and his movements, she had no information of any
  importance to give. He had been very strange in manner, constantly muttering,
  but so indistinctly that she could not catch more than a word or two here and
  there. She had, it is true, caught the word "treasure" once or twice. She had
  certainly not seen him with anything in his hands. Daphne, however, might
  have more to say. The old man had seemed to take a fancy to her, and had
  talked to her a good deal.</p>

  <p>Daphne accordingly was fetched by her mother, and came in covered with a
  charming confusion, which, in the young Greek's eyes, added not a little to
  her beauty. It was the fact, indeed, that the few days of peace which she had
  enjoyed with her mother in their place of refuge had made a marvellous change
  for the better in her looks. The hunted expression had gone out of her eyes,
  which, deep as ever, were now limpid and calm. The cheeks which, when Cleanor
  had last seen them, were wan and worn, were already rounded, and touched with
  the delicate tint of returning health. Cleanor did not fail to note all this
  with the greatest satisfaction, but for the time he was absorbed by the
  interest of the story which she had to tell about the old priest.</p>

  <p>"I saw the old man," she said, "on the first day of our coming here. He
  seemed to take me for someone else. In fact, once or twice he called me by
  some name which sounded like Judith, but I could not catch it distinctly.
  Commonly he spoke to me as his daughter. He had no son, he said, I was all
  that he had left. He had evidently something on his mind that troubled him
  greatly. He would talk about "a treasure" which he had in his keeping, and
  which he must hand over to the right, person, only that he did not know where
  this person was. 'Anyhow,' and when he said this his voice seemed to grow
  stronger, and his eyes to lighten up, 'anyhow, the enemy must not be allowed
  to get it' After the uproar that took place in the temple one day&mdash;we
  did not know what had happened, but we guessed that the Romans had made their
  way in, and we were very much frightened&mdash;he was much worse. That same
  evening he said to me, 'Daughter, I want you to help me. Come with me.' He
  took me down a flight of steps, and then along a passage which seemed to end
  in a wall. When we were almost at the end, he said, 'Now, turn round and shut
  your eyes. You must not see what I am going to do.'I did what he told me, and
  waited. In about half an hour he came back, panting very much and breathing
  hard. He carried a great roll in his arms. I could not see what it was."</p>

  <p>"Did it look like a book?" asked Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the girl, "it might have been a book. I asked him whether I
  should carry it for him. 'No,' he said, 'no woman has ever touched it.
  Indeed, no woman has ever seen it before. I hope that I have not done wrong.
  But what was I to do? I had no one else to help me. And anyhow, the enemy
  must never have it.' We went up the passage, and down another, till we came
  to a place where one of the stones in the pavement had a ring in it. 'Now you
  must help me,' he said. 'I have got to take that stone up.' We both pulled
  away at the stone as hard as we could. For some time we seemed to make no
  impression at all. Then he went away and came in a few minutes with a
  lantern, for by this time it was getting quite dark, and a chisel. 'Work the
  mortar away from the edges,' he said, 'my eyes are too old to see.' So I
  worked the mortar out, and then we pulled again. I don't think that I did
  very much, but he seemed to get wonderfully strong with the excitement. At
  last we felt that it was beginning to give, and in the end we pulled it quite
  away. I heard what sounded like the lapping of water a long way below. Then
  the old man took the roll and dropped it into the hole. After that we put the
  stone back into its place."</p>

  <p>"And you can take us to the place?" asked Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied the girl.</p>

  <p>"I must tell my friends," said Cleanor, "what I have heard. Wait while I
  go."</p>

  <p>In the course of a few minutes he returned with Scipio and the centurion.
  At the latter's suggestion the party provided themselves with torches, and
  then proceeded, under Daphne's guidance, to the indicated spot. The stone was
  removed from its place, an operation which required so great an exertion of
  strength that there was something almost miraculous in its having been
  accomplished before by a decrepit old man and a girl. The priest, it was
  clear, must have worked with frantic energy.</p>

  <p>The first thing was to lower a burning torch. The light revealed a depth
  which might be estimated at some sixty or seventy feet. At the bottom there
  was a stream which seemed, as far as could be estimated from the sound, to be
  moving with some rapidity. Judging from the height of the temple above the
  level of the harbour, the water seemed to be a land- spring which flowed into
  it some way below the surface. The chance of recovering anything dropped into
  such a place seemed remote, without reckoning the very considerable chance of
  its being irretrievably damaged.</p>

  <p>Scipio was discussing with Cleanor and the centurion the best method of
  proceeding, when Daphne's keen eyes discovered that something seemed to be
  resting on a ledge that projected from the side of the well some twenty feet
  below the surface. What it was could not be seen, but it was obviously worth
  investigating. The only way of doing this was to lower someone with ropes,
  and Cleanor, who was lighter than either of the Romans, volunteered for the
  service. After some delay ropes of adequate strength were obtained, Cleanor
  was lowered to the spot, and the missing treasure, for the object which
  Daphne had descried was nothing less, was recovered.</p>

  <p>"The Roman Commonwealth," said Scipio, making a polite obeisance, "owes
  very much to this young lady."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; THE END OF CARTHAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE younger Scipio lost no time in handing over the precious
  volume which had been so nearly lost, and so fortunately recovered, to the
  general, reporting, of course, the circumstances of its rescue. At the same
  time he described the relation in which Daphne and her mother stood to
  Cleanor, and hinted that his friend seemed to have a keener interest in the
  girl than a young man would ordinarily feel for his foster-sister.</p>

  <p>"This is not the place for women," said the elder Scipio, "and the sooner
  these two are out of it, the better. Now, what is to be done?"</p>

  <p>"Would not my Aunt Cornelia receive them for a time if you could contrive
  to send them to her?"</p>

  <p>"An excellent idea, my Lucius!" cried the general. "It shall be done, and
  by good luck, there is opportunity this very day. I am sending off a galley
  with despatches for the Senate, and some private letters of my own. Lollius
  is in command, and there is not a more trustworthy man in the fleet. I will
  put the women into his charge. And I will write to my mother&mdash;she will
  still be in Rome when the galley arrives&mdash;and ask her to give them
  hospitality. We must hope that my cousin, Tiberius, will not fall in love
  with the damsel. Is she beautiful?"</p>

  <p>"As beautiful a girl as ever I saw. But you need not be alarmed. I am
  pretty sure that the young lady will not have a look or a thought for anyone
  in Italy."</p>

  <p>"I will send an orderly to Cleanor to explain, and leave him to arrange
  the business. So that is settled. Now for public matters. Yesterday I opened
  the sealed instructions which I brought with me when I left Rome, and which I
  was not to read till Carthage was taken. They are, as I feared, to the effect
  that the city is to be razed to the ground. Now, I make no secret to
  anybody&mdash;in any case I should speak openly to you&mdash;that this policy
  is not to my liking. I don't like the principle of it. If it were being done
  with a view to the future safety of Rome, I should still hesitate, thinking
  it to be, even in that view, a policy of doubtful advantage. But this is not
  the motive. It is the doing of the capitalists and the traders. They want to
  destroy every port but those which they can dominate themselves, and so to
  get all the trade of the world into their own hands. We shall see the same
  thing&mdash;mark my words&mdash;over again at Corinth; and Rome will have the
  disgrace of having destroyed, and it may be in one year, two of the great
  capitals of the world. I hate such doings, and I don't care who knows it.
  Still, the thing has to be done. But there are matters to be arranged first.
  One thing I have made up my mind about, and happily the Senate leaves it to
  my discretion. I have a free hand in dealing with the spoil, with a general
  proviso that I am to consult, as in my judgment may seem best, the interests
  of the Commonwealth. Whatever there is of real value that can be given back
  to its rightful owners shall be given back. Now, Carthage has for three
  hundred years and more been robbing the Greek cities in Sicily. She has had,
  at one time or other, pretty nearly every one of them, except Syracuse, in
  her power. The gold and silver that she has taken from them are gone beyond
  remedy, but the works of art remain, and can be given back. I have taken some
  trouble to inquire into the matter, and I have got a list here, which has
  been made up for me in Sicily, of some of the chief things that we may expect
  to find. Some may have been lost; some may have fallen into private hands and
  disappeared&mdash;the history of some of the specimens goes back, I hear, a
  long time. Well, I have appointed yourself, Lucius, and two other officers
  with you to enquire into this matter. See which of these things you can find,
  and report to me. Most of the Sicilian cities that are interested in the
  matter have sent envoys to the camp, as I dare say you know. If you can find
  the articles it will be easy enough, I do not doubt, to find claimants."</p>

  <p>The work of the commission proved to be one of considerable magnitude.
  There were, it was found, hundreds of works of art which bore in their
  appearance the manifest signs of a Greek origin. The Ph&oelig;nician genius
  was not entirely barren in the province of art. In some directions, on the
  contrary, it was remarkably fertile. But it never attained to, it did not
  even attempt, except in a conventional and even grotesque fashion, the
  representation of the human form. Any really graceful or even natural
  similitude of man or woman that was found in Carthaginian temple or house was
  certainly the spoil of some Greek city. Many of the less important works were
  unknown; about some there was much doubt; their pedigree was uncertain,
  sometimes through accident, sometimes through fraud, for most of the
  impostures known to the modern world of art are inheritances from the
  ancient. But there were some famous treasures about which there was no
  possibility of doubt. Such was the Artemis of Segesta, one of the noblest
  figures that ancient sculpture produced. It was colossal in size, and yet
  retained in a singular degree the delicacy of girlish beauty. The figure was
  represented with a quiver richly gilded hanging from the shoulder; the left
  hand carried a bow; in the right was a burning torch, which imitated, with a
  fidelity that would hardly have been thought possible in marble, the contours
  of flame. The envoys from Segesta positively wept with joy when they found
  themselves in possession of the long-lost treasure of their city.</p>

  <p>In a very different style of art, the characteristic product of a later
  and more reflective age, was the figure of the poet Stesichorus, carried away
  by the Carthaginians when they destroyed the city of Himera, and now about to
  be restored to the townspeople of Thermae, which occupied its site and
  inherited its traditions. The poet was represented as an old man, frail and
  stooping, with one hand holding a book. The whole expression was admirably
  suited to the serious character of his verse.</p>

  <p>But the most celebrated of all the art treasures now about to return to
  their proper homes was the Bull of Agrigentum. The Agrigentines regarded this
  figure with a reverence that was very surprising, seeing how it recalled a
  time of discreditable servitude. Scipio happened to come in when the precious
  possession was made over to them, and could not help improving the
  occasion.</p>

  <p>"This is, I understand, the monstrous invention of one of your own
  citizens," he said. "He made it for your tyrant Phalaris; it was to be heated
  from underneath, and the groans of the victims inclosed in it pleased the
  brutal caprice of that monster of cruelty, by imitating, as he thought, the
  bellowings of a bull. I do not know which was most to be condemned, the
  servility of the artist or the cruelty of the tyrant. Do you not think, men
  of Agrigentum, that you have happily exchanged the brutality of your own
  citizens, whom you suffered thus to lord it over you, for the justice and
  clemency of the Roman people?"</p>

  <p>While this business was being completed, the work of collecting the
  general spoil of the city had been going on briskly. Scipio had dealt
  liberally with the troops in this matter. Some generals in similar
  circumstances, whether from anxiety for their own enrichment or from zeal to
  make as large a profit as possible for the public purse, overreach
  themselves. They exact too much from the men, and thus they are habitually
  deceived. Scipio was personally disinterested in a remarkable degree; and he
  did not care to be greedy on account of the treasury. Simple and well-
  defined rules were laid down for the conduct of the troops. There were
  certain things which a man might keep for himself, if he brought other things
  into a common stock. At the end of seven days the fiat of destruction which
  had gone out against Carthage was to be executed. A body of men was detailed
  for the purpose. Combustibles were disposed in various parts of the city, and
  at a fixed time these were to be kindled.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the young Scipio to Cleanor as they stood together after
  superintending the embarkation of the last cargo of statues and pictures
  destined for Sicily, "well, the last act of the drama is nearly over. Shall
  we go to see the final scene together?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied the young Greek. "I feel half disposed to cover my
  head till it is all past."</p>

  <p>"I can understand," said Scipio. "Still, I can't see, after what has
  happened, that you owe much gratitude to Carthage."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," was the answer. "Yet it was all the country that I had.
  And, anyhow, it is an awful thing to see a city that once had her hopes, and
  good hopes too, of ruling the world, flare out into nothing, like a piece of
  wood-shaving. However, I will come. To what place are you thinking of
  going?"</p>

  <p>"To the citadel, or what was the citadel. The chief told me that he should
  be there at sunset. I must own that I am very curious to see how he takes it.
  This, you must know, is not his doing. His friends fought hard in the Senate
  against the decree of destruction; but the majority would have it, and there
  was nothing for him but to carry it out."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>When the two friends reached the citadel the chief was already there,
  surrounded by his staff, his generals of division, and the chief officers of
  the legions. The spectacle of the burning city was magnificently terrible.
  The wind was blowing from behind them, and rolled away the smoke in huge
  volumes towards the sea. Now and then it lulled, and then a dense cloud
  covered the whole place, save some tower or spire which rose here and there
  out of it. As the light rapidly failed, for the sun was just setting when the
  two friends reached the height, the heavy smoke clouds became more and more
  penetrated with a fiery glow, and this again grew into one universal,
  all-embracing blaze of light, as the flames gained a more commanding hold on
  the doomed city. Everything was as plainly to be seen as if it had been
  noonday. All the while a confused roar came up to the height where the
  spectators stood, varied now and then by the tremendous crash of some huge
  structure falling in sudden ruin to the earth.</p>

  <p>The general stood intently watching the scene, but without a word, and the
  group surrounding him, overawed by the solemnity of his mood, maintained a
  profound silence, broken only by some almost involuntary cry, when a burst of
  fiercer flame rose to the heavens. When the second watch was about half
  spent&mdash;for the hours had seemed to pass as minutes, so overpowering was
  the interest of the spectacle&mdash;he turned away. Some awful vision of the
  future seemed to reveal itself to his soul. He caught Polybius by the hand
  and said:</p>

  <p>"Will anyone do for Rome what I have been doing for Carthage?"</p>

  <p>And as he turned away he was heard to murmur to himself the line in which
  Hector, touched in the midst of his triumph by a dark prevision of the
  future, foretold the fall of his country,</p>

  <p class="cp"><i>"Some day e'en holy Troy herself shall fall",</i></p>

  <p>Then, throwing a fold of his toga over his face, Scipio burst into a
  passion of tears.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29"></a>XIX. &mdash; AT DELOS</h2>

  <p class="first">CLEANOR gladly accepted the warm invitation of the young
  Scipio again to become his guest. For the present the Greek's plans were
  uncertain. His most definite idea was to follow Theoxena and her daughter to
  Italy as soon as possible. It had been arranged that the two women should
  depart on the following day. He would have to look for his own passage to the
  favour of the general; all that he could do, therefore, was to hold himself
  in readiness to depart as soon as the opportunity should offer.</p>

  <p>The day was not to pass, however, without giving quite a new aspect to the
  future. The two friends had been exchanging experiences, and were just
  thinking of sleep,&mdash;when Polybius entered the tent. After greeting
  Cleanor&mdash;whom he had not seen since they had parted in Egypt&mdash;in
  the kindest way, not, however, without a smiling rebuke for the trick which
  he had played, he explained his errand.</p>

  <p>"I am going," he said, "as soon as is possible to Greece, where things are
  in a critical condition, and I want you to go with me. I come direct from the
  general, who has put a ship of war at my service, and who fully approves of
  your accompanying me. I was, he said, to tell you this from him. He also gave
  me another message for you. He wants you to give what help you can in the
  translation of this great book on Agriculture. There will be a committee
  appointed to carry it out, and you are to be on it if it pleases you. But
  that will wait, anyhow for a few months. The affair in Greece will not wait;
  the sooner we get there the better, if we are to do any good."</p>

  <p>Nothing could have been more to Cleanor's mind than this proposal, and he
  promised to be ready to depart as soon as he was wanted. Accordingly the very
  next day, after bidding Theoxena and her daughter an affectionate farewell in
  the morning, he himself embarked about sunset with Polybius. For some time
  the voyage was fairly prosperous, if not very rapid. The wind came mostly
  from the north, with a touch of east in it. The ship had but a poor crew of
  rowers, and its sailing capacities were small. If the wind had more than one
  point from the east the sails had to be hauled down and the oars resorted
  to.</p>

  <p>On the tenth day there came a change in the weather. The wind shifted
  suddenly to the south-west. This change was at first hailed with delight by
  everyone on board; by the rowers, who were rejoiced to be set free from their
  toil, by the passengers, who were beginning to be impatient of their tedious
  progress. But a wind from the south-west has always something dangerous about
  it. At daybreak a steady breeze, it grew before night into something like a
  gale, and it was accompanied by weather so thick that, failing any
  observation of either sun or stars, the captain lost his reckoning
  entirely.</p>

  <p>After two days of this alarming uncertainty the weather cleared only just
  in time, as everyone on board saw plainly enough, to save the ship from a
  catastrophe. About three miles to the north the cliffs of Malia could be
  seen, crowned by the famous temple of Apollo, whose gilded roof showed itself
  when it was touched, from time to time, by some passing gleam of sunshine. On
  their right the cliffs of Cythera were visible. This was satisfactory in a
  way, but the plan of the voyage, which was to make for the western end of the
  Corinthian Gulf, had failed. The wind was blowing far too strongly to allow
  the captain to attempt a north-western course. He had, therefore, no
  alternative but to let it carry him up the Ægean. What had been lost was the
  safe and easy passage up the quiet landlocked waters of the gulf, and with it
  the certainty of reaching Corinth at or near the appointed time.</p>

  <p>After a few hours the weather again changed for the worse. The clouds came
  lower, the wind rose. When night came all that the captain and the crew knew
  of their whereabouts was that they were not far from Melos, of which they had
  just caught a glimpse, in dangerous proximity, on their larboard bow. Melos,
  they knew, was not by any means on their straight course to Corinth. They
  were, indeed, being blown out of this more and more as time went on. The best
  they could hope for was that they might not be dashed on one of the rugged
  and inhospitable islands and islets with which the south-western Ægean was so
  thickly studded.</p>

  <p>All night they scudded before the wind under one small sail, just enough
  to give some steering power to the rudder. More than once they heard the
  crash of unseen breakers on some unseen shore, and turned their course away
  from the warning sound. With the morning came another welcome change of
  weather. The wind dropped almost instantaneously; the sky cleared till not a
  cloud could be seen, and the sea, though the long rollers witnessed to its
  recent agitation, settled rapidly into calm.</p>

  <p>About two miles to the north, yet seen so distinctly through the clear
  atmosphere of early spring that it seemed almost within a stone's- throw, lay
  a small island which Cleanor recognized at the first glance. Only one place
  in the world brought together so closely, within so small a space yet on a
  scale so magnificent, the two great elements of Greek life, commerce and
  religion. On the low-lying land of the west coast was to be seen the town of
  Delos, with its thickly-clustered dwellings. Almost, as it seemed, among
  these rose a forest of masts, for Delos was a mart of exchange for the trade
  of the Mediterranean, and the trade of the Mediterranean was practically the
  trade of the civilized world. Close behind the town, in all the splendour of
  its white Parian marble, rose the famous temple of the tutelary god of the
  isle, Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, while nestling beside it were the smaller shrines
  of his twin sister Ph&oelig;be or Artemis and of Aphrodite. Behind these
  again was the hill of Cynthus, its steep declivity clothed with trees, among
  which gleamed here and there the white shining walls of buildings both sacred
  and secular.</p>

  <p>"Delos!" cried the captain; "well, it might have been worse, and if we can
  only get out of the harbour as easily and quickly as it seems likely we shall
  get into it, we shall have nothing to complain of."</p>

  <p>"Here," cried Cleanor to Polybius as they stood side by side on the
  galley's deck, "here is one of my dreams come to pass! I have always desired
  to see Delos, and here it is. Truly, here Greece is still to be seen in all
  its glory."</p>

  <p>Polybius smiled somewhat bitterly. "There is very little of Greece, I
  fear, about Delos nowadays."</p>

  <p>"But it belongs to Athens surely," broke in the young Greek, "just as it
  did in the best times of Greece."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it belongs to Athens," replied his friend; "if that means that
  Athenian coin is circulated there, and the government is carried on in the
  name of the Athenian people. But Delos is Roman for all practical purposes.
  As for the Delians themselves, they were all deported twenty years ago, and
  this time unfortunately Apollo did not interfere. No, my dear friend, it is
  only the past of Delos that belongs to Greece, and that happily no power on
  earth can take from her. That, thank the gods, we can still enjoy."</p>

  <p>Some hours were pleasantly spent by the two friends in examining the
  sights of the place. Polybius had been there two or three times before;
  Cleanor, who knew every reference to the sacred island,&mdash;from the young
  palm-tree to which Ulysses compared the fair Nausicaa onwards,&mdash;was
  prepared thoroughly to enjoy the guidance of so intelligent a companion.
  Later on in the day they strolled through the business town. Evidently it was
  a thriving place. The docks were crowded with ships, the wharves covered with
  merchandise of every kind, from the spices of the East to the ivory brought
  by African hunters from the great forests of the South. But there was little
  or nothing Greek about it. Two out of three among the huge factories which
  lined the harbour-side belonged to Roman traders. The others belonged to
  merchants of Tyre, of Antioch, of Joppa, of Alexandria, but it was the
  exception to find a Greek name among them. Cleanor could not help confessing
  to himself that another illusion was gone. The most famous seat of Greek
  life, whether sacred or secular, had passed into the power of the
  stranger.</p>

  <p>The anxiety of the travellers to get to their journey's end was increased
  by all that they heard in the island. It was clear, by all accounts, that the
  fate of Corinth was imminent. But, much against their wills, their stay was
  prolonged. The ship had received so severe a buffeting during its voyage from
  Carthage that it could not be said to be seaworthy. It had to be laid up in
  dock and repaired. And then, when it was pronounced ready for sea, the
  weather made it absolutely impossible to start. The captain had been only too
  prescient when he doubted whether they should be able to get out of the
  harbour as easily as they got in.</p>

  <p>There was, indeed, much to be seen in Delos, which was then at the height
  of its prosperity, and adorned with the offerings which the piety of more
  than five hundred years had heaped upon it. But Polybius and his companion
  were so impatient to reach their destination that the time seemed to hang
  heavily on their hands. Disturbing rumours, too, were current about the
  policy which Rome was likely to pursue at Corinth. That the city would
  speedily be captured was considered certain, and there were ominous
  conjectures as to its probable fate. One day the friends had accepted an
  invitation to dinner from Diagoras, the Athenian governor of the island, and
  Corinth was naturally the principal subject of conversation. What Diagoras
  had to say was alarming in the extreme.</p>

  <p>"You have come from Carthage," he said. "Well, what you have seen there
  you will see again at Corinth. The capitalists and the commercial party have
  it all their own way at Rome now, and their policy is, of course, monopoly.
  Every trade rival must be put out of the way. Carthage has been destroyed.
  That was not, as you know, the doing of the nobles. Scipio and his friends
  were strongly against it. The capitalists carried it in the Senate, partly by
  their own votes, partly by the votes which they practically bought. I could
  tell you the men&mdash;and some of their names would surprise you&mdash;whose
  votes were purchased, and I could tell you the price that was paid for them.
  The same thing has happened over and over again. Listen to this. I must not
  tell you the name of my correspondent, but his authority is beyond all
  doubt:</p>

  <p><i>"'The vote has gone as I expected. Corinth is to perish. The division
  was closer than in the Carthage affair, for the crime&mdash;I can call it
  nothing less&mdash;is more scandalous and more unprovoked. Carthage was once
  formidable, though she has long ceased to be so; Corinth never could have
  caused a moment's fear to Rome. It is simply the case of a trader burning
  down a rival's ware-house.'</i></p>

  <p>"This letter I received last night," the governor continued, "and it
  appears to have been delayed on the way. The Senate's instructions to
  Mummius&mdash;it is he that is in command at Corinth, and a very different
  man from your Scipio, I fancy&mdash;must have reached him by this time."</p>

  <p>"Then we are too late," said Polybius with a groan.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the governor, "though I do not see what you could have done
  even if you had not been delayed. All that will be in your power will be to
  help individuals. I should recommend you, by the way, to go to Athens first,
  and get a safe-conduct and letters of introduction from the Roman agent
  there. These will make your task easier."</p>

  <p>Two or three days after this conversation the travellers were able to make
  a start. A gentle breeze from the east carried them out of the harbour, and
  took them quickly to their journey's end.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap30"
     name="chap30"></a>XXX. &mdash; CORINTH</h2>

  <p class="first">THE news that met the travellers when they arrived at Athens
  was as bad as their worst fears had anticipated. The whole city was in
  mourning. One of her sister states&mdash;after herself the most splendid, and
  wealthy beyond anything to which she could pretend&mdash;had perished, and
  Athens, more generous than her rival had been in former days, grieved
  unfeignedly for her fate. It was a lamentable story of rashness, incapacity,
  and cowardice that Polybius and Cleanor had to listen to, and they heard it
  in full detail from a young soldier who had himself taken part in the
  campaign. At first the young man could hardly be persuaded to speak, so
  heartily ashamed was he of the conduct of his countrymen. At last, assured of
  the sympathetic temper of his hearers, he related a narrative, of which it
  will be sufficient for me to give an outline.</p>

  <p>"I was one of the aides-de-camp to the general of the year, Critolaüs. Did
  you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Polybius, "only too well; a more incompetent fool never ruined
  the affairs of a state."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the young soldier, "he has paid for his folly. Early in this
  year we marched out of our winter-quarters near Corinth to attack Heraclea in
  Thessaly, which had declared itself out of the League. We had just sat down
  before the town when news came that the Roman army was approaching.
  Immediately there was a scuttle. The general did not wait to hear what was
  the force of the enemy, but was off at once. Some of his officers begged him
  to make a stand at Thermopylae. We were not all of us such curs as he. There
  really was a chance of holding the pass till we could get any help that might
  be forthcoming. Anyhow, it was a place where a Greek might fight with the
  best hope, and die with the most honour. But the general had no wish to
  fight, much less to die. He hurried through Thermopylae, thinking to get back
  to the intrenched camp at Corinth in which we had wintered; but
  Metellus&mdash;he was in command of the Romans&mdash;was too quick for us. He
  overtook us when we had got about twenty miles from Thermopylae, and there
  was a battle,&mdash;if you may call it a battle, when one side charges and
  the other runs away. The Thebans, it is true, held their ground. They may
  call the Thebans stupid, but they are wonderfully good soldiers. Yet what was
  the good of one corps standing firm when there was no one to back it up? As
  for Critolaüs, no one knows what became of him. He galloped off as soon as
  the Roman troops came in sight, and he has never been seen from that day to
  this.</p>

  <p>"Well, nothing was left of the army but a few scattered troops and
  companies, and many of these were cut up, or taken prisoners one by one. I am
  bound to say that the Romans behaved very well. They offered quarter to
  anyone who would lay down his arms, and safety to every state that would
  submit. It was more than could be expected, for really they could have
  imposed any terms that they pleased. But our chiefs, led by Diaeus, who had
  succeeded Critolaüs, were bent on securing their own lives. They were afraid
  that on some pretext they would be excepted in any amnesty that might be
  offered, and so they went on fighting. Diaeus made a levy en masse of the
  whole population, and, besides, armed twelve thousand slaves, if you may call
  it arming a man to give him a blunt sword and a spear with a cracked shaft.
  Money he raised in any way he could; first he confiscated the property of all
  who belonged to the peace party, and made up what was wanting&mdash;and a
  good deal was wanting&mdash;by robbing his own friends. He took up his
  position on the Isthmus, close to what is left of the wall built in the
  Persian time. Everything went badly from the first. Our vanguard was near
  Megara, and, of course, we expected that it would make a stand, so as to give
  us a little time. It had a strong position which it might have held for at
  least three or four days. Well, it fled without so much as striking a
  blow.</p>

  <p>"After this Metellus, who really behaved in the most moderate way, gave
  Diaeus a chance. He sent envoys to offer terms, really liberal terms, too,
  which it would have been no dishonour for people much better off than we were
  to accept. To make them more acceptable, as he thought, these envoys were
  Greeks, men of the highest character. But our general would not listen to
  them. Not only that, but he charged them in the public assembly with being
  traitors, and they were all but killed in the riot that followed. Then we had
  yet another chance. Philo the Thessalian, than whom there is no man more
  honoured in Greece, came with conditions for an arrangement. Some of the
  general's own party were convinced. Old Stratius, who has never been a friend
  to Rome, as you know, actually groveled on the ground, and caught Diaeus by
  the knees, entreating him to give way. But it was all of no use. Philo had to
  go away without accomplishing anything. In fact, all this seemed only to make
  the man more furious. He had some of his own officers brought before a
  court-martial on the charge of being in communication with the enemy. Their
  real fault was that they had been imprudent enough to show that they were in
  favour of peace. One of them was found guilty and put to the torture. He bore
  it, I was told, without saying a word. Two others escaped with their lives,
  but only by paying a bribe&mdash;one a talent, the other forty mince, for the
  man was as greedy as he was cruel, and he went on robbing and murdering with
  the sword within a foot of his own neck.</p>

  <p>"Then we had another reprieve. There was a change of generals in the Roman
  army. Mummius, who had crossed from Italy, took over the command from
  Metellus. While new arrangements were being made the Romans sat still, and
  Diaeus took the notion into his head that they were beginning to be afraid of
  us. Then there happened some small affair of outposts in which our cavalry
  got the best of it. It was but a trifle, not more than half a dozen men
  killed or wounded on either side, but it elated our chief beyond all measure.
  First he sent envoys to offer terms to the Romans. They were to evacuate
  Greece, and give hostages as guarantee that they would not return. If they
  did this, Diaeus would allow them to depart in safety. It was the act of a
  madman, and, of course, Mummius did not even condescend to send back an
  answer.</p>

  <p>"But it was a good thing for me. I, you see, was one of the envoys, and I
  did not go back with them. It was quite enough for me to go through the Roman
  camp, and see the admirable order and discipline, not to speak of the number
  of the men, to feel sure that we had not the shadow of a chance. I frankly
  told the Roman general, who seems a kind-hearted man, though somewhat of a
  boor, how I was situated. I was really serving under compulsion, a sort of
  hostage for my father, who is a leader of the peace party, and as he was out
  of danger now, living as he did in Northern Greece, and so not within reach
  of the League, I felt free to leave, without having to feel myself a
  deserter. The general was very kind, and advised me to leave the seat of war,
  where, indeed, it would have been painful for me to stay, whatever might
  happen. Accordingly I came to Athens; that is why I have the pleasure of
  seeing you to-day."</p>

  <p>"And what has happened since?" asked Polybius.</p>

  <p>"A despatch came in yesterday. Everything has gone as I expected. The
  League generals were as rash at the end as they were timorous at the
  beginning. They offered battle to the Romans though these were twice as
  strong in actual numbers, not to speak of being vastly superior in discipline
  and quality generally. The cavalry turned and fled without waiting to cross
  swords with the enemy. The infantry, who were mostly Thebans, behaved better,
  but the number of the enemy told against them. They were outflanked and
  broken. After that, of course, all was over. The general wrote that he held
  back his troops from the pursuit."</p>

  <p>"And Diaeus, what of him?" asked Polybius. "I hope the villain has had his
  deserts. How has Greece sinned against the gods that she should be cursed
  with having such fellows put in authority over her?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing was known of what happened to him. But his body was not found
  among the dead."</p>

  <p>Polybius and his companion were kept for three days longer in Athens, the
  Roman commissioner refusing them a permit to pass to the front. Mummius was
  still before the city. Till he had entered it the presence of strangers in
  the camp was considered to be inconvenient. Late in the evening of the third
  day a despatch arrived from him, dated from the citadel of Corinth. He
  explained that, no resistance had been offered by the Greek army; but that,
  finding it difficult to believe that so strong a place could be given up
  without some attempt at defence, he had waited till he could be sure that no
  stratagem was intended. The city, he added, was perfectly quiet; all the
  leaders of the hostile army had either fallen in battle or were prisoners in
  his hands. Diaeus was reported to have fled into Arcadia, and to have there
  committed suicide along with his wife, but the report was not at present
  confirmed.</p>

    <p class="caption">A Corinthian nobelman being sold as a slave.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The Roman commissioner immediately on receiving this news sent the desired
  permission to Polybius, and the two friends, who had everything in readiness
  for their journey, started at once. Travelling all night they reached
  Corinth, which was not more than thirty miles from Athens, shortly after
  dawn. The city presented a most lamentable appearance. The great
  market-place, and all the other squares and open spaces, were thronged with a
  helpless and miserable crowd of men, women, and children, of all ages and all
  ranks, doomed to the cruellest lot that humanity can endure. The Senate and
  People of Rome, provoked, it must be allowed, to the utmost by the insolence
  and folly of the Corinthians, had passed the savage decree that the whole
  population of the city should be sent to the slave- market.</p>

  <p>The horrible business had already begun. The wretched victims had been
  divided into lots according to sex and age. The quaestor's clerks&mdash;the
  quaestor, it may be explained, was the officer who had charge of
  finance&mdash;were busy noting down particulars, and the loathsome crew of
  slave-dealers and their assistants, foul creatures that always followed close
  on the track of a Roman army, were appraising the goods which were soon to be
  offered for competition. Nobles of ancient houses, merchants, who but a month
  before could have matched their riches with the wealthiest capitalists of
  Rome, the golden youth of the most luxurious city of the world, and, saddest
  of all, delicate women, whose beauty had been jealously guarded even from sun
  and wind, stood helplessly exposed to the brutal gaze and yet more brutal
  handling of Egyptian and Syrian slave-dealers, barbarians to whom, in the
  haughty pride of their Hellenism, they would scarcely have conceded the title
  of man. Cleanor recognized among the victims several whose acquaintance he
  had made during his brief sojourn in Corinth during the previous year. The
  contrast between their present degradation and the almost insolent pride of
  their prosperous days touched him to the heart. The emotion of Polybius was
  even more profound. Some of these men were lifelong friends. He had sat by
  their side at the council; he had been a guest at their hospitable tables.
  Some of them bore names associated with the greatest glories of Greece. To
  see them exposed for sale like so many sheep or oxen was a thing more strange
  and more horrible than he could have conceived to be possible.</p>

  <p>Not less strange, if less harrowing, was the spectacle which presented
  itself to the two friends when they reached that quarter of the city in which
  the Roman soldiery had bivouacked. One of the first things that they saw was
  a group of soldiers off duty busy with a game of hazard. For the convenience
  of having a level surface on which to throw the dice they had stretched a
  canvas on the ground. Polybius, whose eye was caught by what looked like a
  figure on this improvised dice-table, approached and looked over the shoulder
  of one of the players to examine it more closely. He started back in
  amazement and horror.</p>

  <p>"Great Zeus!" he cried, "what do you think it is, Cleanor, that these
  fellows have laid there to throw their dice upon? Why, it is one of the
  finest pictures in the world! It is the 'Dionysus' of Aristides! The city, I
  have been told, gave twenty talents for it to the artist, and, to my certain
  knowledge, might have sold it over and over again for twice as much if not
  more. Look at it. Did you ever see anything finer? See how the god is
  flinging himself from his car! See with what surprise Ariadne is turning to
  look at him! And the throng of nymphs and satyrs, did you ever behold such
  variety, such energy, such grace? And these barbarians are using it for a
  dice-table!"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said. Cleanor warningly. "They may be barbarians, but they are our
  masters, and it is prudent to be civil."</p>

  <p>Close by was another group which was amusing itself in precisely the same
  way. The picture was not, it is true, so famous a master-piece as the
  "Dionysus"&mdash;it was the "Hercules" of Polygnotus, but it was a work of
  art which meant a modest fortune to anyone who had had the luck to possess
  himself of it. As for the purpose which it was then serving, a table of gold
  would not have been so inappropriately costly. Anomalies of the same kind
  could be seen everywhere. Coverlets of the richest Tyrian purple, tapestries
  worked with figures as graceful and delicate as the most skilful brush of the
  painter could make them, embroidered robes that Pallas might have worked or
  Aphrodite worn, the treasures brought from the harems of Eastern kings, lay
  about to be trampled under the feet of Apulian herdsmen, Sabine ploughmen,
  and Campanian vine-dressers. To these sturdy peasants, ignorant of all arts
  but the soldier's, they were but gaudy-coloured cloths which might be put, in
  default of something more convenient, to the meanest purposes.</p>

  <p>"Great Zeus!" cried Polybius, as he looked on the scene, "what a waste! It
  is better that anyone should have these treasures than that they should be
  wasted in this fashion. Let us see Mummius and give him an idea of what is
  going on."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap31"
     name="chap31"></a>XXI. &mdash; MUMMIUS</h2>

  <p class="first">SCIPIO had furnished Polybius with a letter addressed to
  Mummius, who, as one of the consuls of the year, was likely, sooner or later,
  to take command of the forces that were to operate against Corinth. Thanks to
  this he found no difficulty in obtaining for himself and Cleanor access to
  the great man. He had also the advantage of having made the consul's
  acquaintance during his sojourn in Italy. Mummius was a "new man", one of the
  class which their enemies describe as up-starts, their friends as "self-made
  men". He was rude and uncultured, with just so much education as enabled him
  to spell through a state document and sign his name. But if he was ignorant
  and unrefined, on the other hand he was honest, a plain man who did his duty
  up to his light, not given either to self-indulgence or greed, and humane at
  least up to the Roman average.</p>

  <p>The friends found him immersed in business, a kind of business, too, with
  which he was wholly unfitted to deal. This, however, did not prevent him
  greeting Polybius in friendly fashion, and speaking a few words of welcome to
  Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you, gentlemen?" he asked, when these salutations had
  been exchanged.</p>

  <p>Polybius briefly described what he had seen, and suggested that some steps
  should be taken to put a stop to this waste of valuable property.</p>

  <p>"This sort of thing is quite beyond me," exclaimed the consul in some
  irritation. "I don't understand what you mean by these treasures of art.
  However, I will see to it. But I have done a good stroke of business for the
  treasury. There are hundreds of statues about the city, which, indeed, is
  fairly blocked up with them. What they could want with so many I can't
  conceive. As for being statues of great men, as they tell me, I can hardly
  believe it. Why, the whole country is not a quarter of the size of Italy, and
  we haven't a half or anything like a half. But as to the statues. The agents
  of King Eumenes of Pergamus were here yesterday, and gave me five thousand
  sesterces apiece for the pick of a hundred statues. That makes a fine sum of
  money, more than a knight's qualification, as you know."</p>

  <p>"Five thousand apiece! is that all?" cried Polybius. "I don't know, of
  course, what the statues were, but I am pretty sure that King Eumenes would
  send an agent who knew what he was about. And if he had the first pick, I
  should say that the king has made the best bargain that he ever made in his
  life. Five thousand, indeed! It would not have been a bad stroke of business,
  I should say, if he had paid fifty thousand. I know that he gave double that
  to Diagoras of Rhodes for Myron's Dancing Faun."</p>

  <p>"You astonish me," said Mummius. "I never dreamt of such sums. Why, at
  Interamna&mdash;my native place, you know&mdash;they put up a statue of my
  father, twice the size of life, and the sculptor thought himself very well
  paid with five thousand sesterces, the town finding the stone. But I suppose
  you know all about these things. However, I have passed my word, and I can't
  go back from my bargain. But the king didn't get quite the pick, as you call
  it. I sent Duilius my quaestor round the city to look about him and choose a
  cargo of specimens to send over to Rome. He told me that he knew something
  about these matters. And he can speak Greek, which is something."</p>

  <p>At this point of the conversation one of the consul's lictors knocked at
  the door and announced that the transport contractors had called by
  appointment.</p>

  <p>Polybius and his companion offered to go away. "No," said Mummius, "there
  is nothing private, and I have something else to say to you afterwards. Bring
  them in," he went on, speaking to the lictor.</p>

  <p>The contractors were three in number, the owners of as many transport
  ships. They had undertaken to convey three ship-loads of statues to Rome. One
  of them had a catalogue of these works of art, which he handed to the consul.
  Mummius had another copy.</p>

  <p>"Would you be good enough," he said to Polybius, "to go over the list with
  these gentlemen. You will tell we whether it is all right, and you will see
  what sort of choice Duilius has made.</p>

  <p>The list contained some two hundred items in all, and there was scarcely
  one of them which Polybius did not know or had not heard as being a
  master-piece in its way. There were works amongst them of all the famous
  sculptors of Greece, from Phidias downwards&mdash;Polyclitus, Myron,
  Praxiteles, and the masters of the Rhodian and the Pergamene schools.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the historian, when the list had been carefully gone through,
  "Duilius has done his business very well. He has got the pick of the
  treasures of Corinth. And King Eumenes, though he has done exceedingly well,
  can hardly have made the extravagantly good bargain that I thought. Yes, this
  is a very fine list indeed."</p>

  <p>The consul's face grew visibly brighter.</p>

  <p>"That is good hearing," he cried. "I shan't have done so badly after all;
  but I wish very much that I had seen you a little sooner. Now, my friends,"
  he went on, addressing himself to the contractors, "you hear what this
  gentleman says. He is a friend of mine, and knows all about these matters.
  You understand that you have a very valuable cargo. Are your transports
  water-tight and seaworthy in every way?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," said the spokesman of the three. "I don't believe you
  could find better ships between the Pillars and Tyre."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope they are what you say. But mind this, you are answerable for
  the cargo. I paid your price, and I expect you to do your work. Mind this, if
  you lose them, you will replace them with others just as good. Isn't that
  fair, Polybius?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," said the Greek, preserving a quite masterly command of
  his countenance.</p>

  <p>This business concluded, the consul went on:</p>

  <p>"You have done me, or tried to do me, a good turn; I only wish that you
  had come a few hours sooner. Now I should like to show you that I am
  grateful. You have heard, I suppose, of Diaeus?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word, sir," replied the historian, "except that he disappeared
  after the battle."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mummius, "he is dead. He poisoned himself at some place in
  Arcadia. His property, of course, is confiscated. I am told that there are
  about thirty talents of silver and half a talent of gold. Whatever the
  amount, half of it is at your service."</p>

  <p>"I thank you, sir," returned Polybius, "but I don't care to enrich myself
  with what has belonged to a countryman. Diaeus was no friend of mine, but I
  should not like it to be said that I have been a gainer by his death."</p>

  <p>"You are an honest man," cried the consul, and I wish that there were more
  like you here, and, for the matter of that, at Rome. But can I do anything
  for you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, you can," said Polybius. "Let me use this money to redeem some
  of these poor creatures who are to be sold. I know many of them; some I may
  almost call friends. It is heart-rending for one who has seen them as they
  were to see them as they are now."</p>

  <p>"Good!" answered Mummius, "you shall have the whole of the money, and I
  will tell the quaestor to see that it goes as far as possible. There shall be
  no bidding against you. And now farewell; but you and your young friend must
  dine with me to-day."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap32"
     name="chap32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; THE SLAVE-DEALER</h2>

  <p class="first">THE entertainment which the consul provided for his guests
  was of the simplest and most frugal kind, in curious contrast with the costly
  plate on which it was served. His cook knew his tastes, which were those of
  the Sabine farming folk from whom he came, and catered for him accordingly;
  but the furnishing of the table was naturally that of the place where he was
  quartered, the official residence of the chief magistrate of Corinth, and
  this was filled with the finest specimens of the city's famous ware.</p>

  <p>The repast ended, the quaestor, who had been one of the guests, explained
  to Polybius what Mummius had instructed him to do. "The consul," he said,
  "has commissioned me to use forty talents of silver in redeeming slaves. You
  are to draw up a list, and as the sale begins the day after to- morrow, you
  should lose no time in doing so. As to the price, he has instructed the
  official agent to value the persons selected, so they will not be actually
  put up for sale. More than this the consul did not feel he could do. 'If I
  were to interfere with the prices,' he said, 'I should be making a very
  dangerous precedent. It must all be done on strict business principles.' A
  more scrupulously honourable man than Lucius Mummius does not live, though it
  must be allowed that he does not know much about art. However, you will have
  fairly easy terms, I don't doubt."</p>

  <p>"I am greatly obliged to you," said Polybius. "And now there is another
  thing in which you can help me. My young friend here and I have been talking
  the matter over, and we are agreed in wanting to do something more in the
  same direction. He has been actually under the spear, and I, though I have
  never gone through that experience, know something of the bitterness of being
  at another man's bidding. Well, fate has dealt kindly with both of us, and we
  both want to show our gratitude. Between us we can raise another forty
  talents, and we want to use it in the same way. Our idea is this. The money
  that comes from Diaeus' estate should, we think, be used on the public
  account. Our own we should employ as our private feelings may suggest. In the
  list that I shall draw up for the official agent I shall put the names of men
  whose official standing, or services to their country, or any other public
  reason, seem to call for their selection. In regard to our own money, we
  shall consider private friendship or acquaintance. Now, can you help us in
  laying this out to the best advantage?"</p>

  <p>The quaestor reflected. "You must not go," he said after a pause, "to the
  agent. I feel quite sure that the consul would not like it. I do not see that
  you can do anything better, or, indeed, anything else than approach one of
  the slave-dealers. The way of these sales, I may say of all sales, is pretty
  much the same everywhere. There is a regular gang which has it all its own
  way. The members of it don't bid against each other, except where they have a
  commission to purchase this or that lot. But when an outsider tries to get
  anything for himself, they agree to run him up to a most extravagant price.
  Yes, you must get one of the dealers to take a friendly interest in you."</p>

  <p>"And whom do you recommend?" asked Polybius.</p>

  <p>"That is not so easy to say," replied the quaestor. "They are not a nice
  lot, as I dare say you know. Most of them would sell their own fathers and
  mothers. It is not an improving occupation. But, on the whole, I should
  recommend Judas the Jew. He has principles; very queer principles they are,
  but still they are something. Yes, Judas is your man. One of my orderlies
  shall bring him to you early to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Early the next day, accordingly, Judas presented himself, showing a
  curious contrast, with his slight, wiry figure and keen intelligent face, to
  the stoutly-built, stolid-looking soldier who accompanied him.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you?" he began. "There will be some
  bargains to be picked up, I dare say. But the really good things always fetch
  their price. There is never a glut of them."</p>

  <p>Polybius had drawn up a list, which he proceeded to hand to the Jew. He
  had put down the names, and, as far as he knew or could guess them, the ages
  of the persons whom he wished to purchase. The Jew's eyes opened wider and
  wider as he read it.</p>

  <p>"But what," he asked, his astonishment over-coming for the moment his
  usual somewhat servile civility, "what do you want with all these old men and
  women? They can't all be your fathers and mothers, and uncles and aunts.
  Excuse me, gentlemen," he added, recovering himself, "but this is not the
  sort of commission I am in the habit of getting from my customers."</p>

  <p>Polybius explained, to the best of his power, his own and his friend's
  motives. As the Jew listened a gentler expression came into his face. "By the
  God of my fathers," he exclaimed when the historian had finished, "I have
  never come across such a thing in my life! I don't mean that I haven't known
  of sons buying back fathers and mothers and that sort of thing, but this is
  quite outside my experience. Well," he went on with a smile, "you will at all
  events find that your fancy won't cost you very dear. How much do you propose
  to spend?"</p>

  <p>Polybius named the sum. "But of course," he added, "we must consider your
  commission. What will that be on this amount?"</p>

  <p>Judas meditated a while. "By Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," he broke out
  after a time, "I won't take a drachma. I have been about the world in this
  line of business for thirty years, and I have never seen anything like it. I
  should not have supposed it possible," he muttered to himself in his own
  language, "that these Gentile dogs should have thought of such a thing. Well,
  I must not shame Father Abraham by behaving worse than they do. No,
  gentlemen, "he went on, "I shall not charge anything for commission. This is
  a quite uncommon piece of business, and you must let me please myself by
  managing it in my own way. Well, you can get a whole ship-load of the old
  people for this money. Some of the young men will be more expensive. But the
  really costly articles are the young women, and I don't see one on your list.
  Depend upon it, you shall have your money's worth. There are some of the
  meanest scoundrels in the world in Corinth at this moment, but they know
  better than to bid against Judas."</p>

  <p>When sundry details of business had been disposed of, the old Jew grew
  very communicative about his occupation. He had been a slave himself, carried
  away by some Syrian marauders in his childhood from a village of Galilee.
  Bought by a soldier, a captain in the army of the third Antiochus, he had
  regained his liberty in the rout which followed the victory of Magnesia.
  After this had come a period of service in the patriot armies raised by the
  Maccabee brothers. In this he gained some distinction, but he found himself
  destitute when a severe wound received at the battle of Elaim compelled him
  to give up the profession of arms. He had no relative in the world; his
  native place had absolutely perished. A countryman offered him a clerk's
  place. When he found that his new employer was a dealer in slaves he felt a
  strange thrill of pleasure. He was to make his living out of the miseries of
  these heathen who had marred his own life. To his own people he never ceased
  to be tender and generous. To the rest of the world he seemed to be
  absolutely callous and heartless. On this occasion he related to his hearers
  experiences so horrible that their blood ran cold at hearing them. His
  comments on these were often curiously cynical. "What a piece of folly it was
  that Flamininus committed at Chelys!" he remarked when some chance had
  brought the conversation round to that subject. Cleanor listened, we may be
  sure, with all his ears, when he caught the name. "In a fit of stupid passion
  he threw away at least fifty talents of good money. Imagine the absolute
  idiocy of a man who kills some scores of able-bodied men when he might have
  sold them! What did he do it for? For revenge? Didn't he know that nine out
  of ten would far sooner have been killed than made slaves of? Why, I always
  have to watch any spirited young fellow for the first month or so lest he
  should slip out of my hands. After that they seem to lose heart, and can't
  even pluck up spirit enough to stab themselves. Of course the order to kill
  is never really carried out. The soldiers have knack of stunning those whom
  they seem to kill. I have had some pretty cargoes of corpses who came to life
  again when they were safely out of the way. You give a soldier a hundred
  sesterces, and you get a stout young fellow whom you can sell for five
  thousand."</p>

  <p>Polybius and Cleanor had the satisfaction of seeing their efforts crowned
  with even more success than they could have expected. The public agent had
  taken a very liberal view of his duties, and the Jew dealer had carried out
  his part of the business with great success. Nearly seven hundred of the
  oldest and most helpless victims of the siege were restored to freedom. It
  was but a small fraction of the miserable whole, but it was something to have
  done. None of the rescued captives knew the names of their benefactors,
  though somehow the secret leaked out afterwards, but the friends felt that
  their pains had been well bestowed and well rewarded when they stood by and
  marked, unmarked themselves, the happiness which they had been able to secure
  to their unfortunate compatriots.</p>

  <p>If in this respect Polybius went, and was content to go, without the
  praises of his countrymen, there was another matter in the conduct of which
  he deservedly won almost universal applause. Some miserable
  sycophants&mdash;and sycophants were only too common among the Greeks of the
  time&mdash;proposed to Mummius that the statues of Philop&oelig;men should be
  thrown down. He had been always, they alleged, an energetic opponent of Rome,
  and it was a contradiction that monuments erected in his honour should be
  permitted to stand now that Rome had finally triumphed. The consul, who, to
  tell the truth, had but the slightest acquaintance with even recent history,
  was at first impressed by the argument. This Philop&oelig;men had been the
  chief of the Achaean League, and it was the Achaean League that had defended,
  or tried to defend, Corinth against him.</p>

  <p>Polybius, who, of course, knew what was meditated, begged to be allowed to
  defend the departed patriot, and Mummius consented to hear him. A kind of
  impromptu court was constituted. The consul and his quaestor, with the
  legates or generals of division, formed the bench of judges. Polybius, who
  spoke with a depth of personal feeling that touched the hearts of all who
  heard him, delivered a most eloquent and convincing apology for the venerable
  man whom he had once been privileged to call his friend. He allowed that
  Philop&oelig;men had struggled for the independence of Greece as long as that
  independence was possible. What honest Greek, he asked, could have done less?
  But he had always been an honourable enemy, and as soon as he saw that the
  true interests of his country demanded it he had always been a loyal ally.
  The judges gave an unanimous verdict in his favour.</p>

  <p>"He was an honest man," said the consul with emphasis. "His statue shall
  remain standing here and everywhere, whatever may be thrown down, and as
  honest men are not too common, it shall be set up in every city of
  Greece."</p>

  <p>It was now time for the friends to part. Polybius had received a
  commission from Rome to arrange the affairs of the other cities of the
  Peloponnese, and he would gladly have taken his young friend with him in the
  capacity of secretary. But Cleanor felt irresistibly called, and by more
  motives than one, to Italy. There awaited him there an honourable and
  lucrative employment, which would be all the more welcome because it was
  wholly remote from the scenes, so full of painful associations, through which
  he had passed during the last two years of his life. This, as my readers will
  remember, was the translation of the famous treatise on Agriculture. And he
  never forgot for a moment that Italy now contained the two beings who were
  dearest to him in the world. Corinth, which the savage decree of the Senate
  had doomed to the flames, both were anxious to leave without delay. They
  parted on the deck of the <i>Ino</i>, the ship which carried Polybius to
  Sicyon, the first city which he was to visit in his official capacity, and
  which was to take Cleanor further westward to Rome. "Farewell!" said
  Polybius. "I shall be busy with my history when these affairs are settled.
  Remember that you have promised to criticise it. I shall not like to give it
  to the world till it has had your approval."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap33"
     name="chap33"></a>XXXIII. &mdash; TO ITALY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE <i>Ino</i> had a quick and prosperous voyage. But though
  Cleanor arrived safely at his destination, he learned, not without
  astonishment, that he had been running a very considerable danger of having a
  different ending to his travels. The Roman Republic was extending her borders
  in every direction, and was levelling to the dust the cities which had
  disputed with her the empire of the world, but she suffered herself to be
  insulted and her citizens and allies to be maltreated by insignificant
  enemies. While her legions and fleets were winning great victories abroad,
  her own coasts were harried by pirates. Near Ithaca the <i>Ino</i> picked up
  a boat in which were three sailors reduced to the last stage of exhaustion by
  hunger and thirst The poor fellows, who were almost unconscious when they
  were taken on board, had a piteous story to tell when they had recovered
  sufficient strength to speak. They had been drifting about for nine days, and
  were the survivors of a company of nine the crew of a trader of Patrae which
  was bound with a cargo of wine for Tarentum.</p>

  <p>"We were overhauled," said the captain, who was one of the three, "when we
  had accomplished half our voyage by a Cilician pirate galley. They took what
  they wanted of my cargo, scuttled my ship, and being, for some reason or
  other, in high good-humour, instead of making us walk the plank, as is their
  common custom, let us take our chance in our boat, and even gave us a keg of
  water and a bag of biscuits. This was my first venture on my own account,"
  said the man, with tears in his eyes, "and I have lost everything I had in
  the world. We pay taxes to the Romans; why don't they keep the seas safe for
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Why, indeed?" said the captain of the <i>Ino</i>. "Things are far worse
  now," he continued, addressing himself to Cleanor, "than they were when I
  first began to sail these seas some thirty years ago. They used to be fairly
  well kept in those days by the Rhodian ships. It was very seldom that the
  pirates ever came west of Cyprus. But then Rhodes began to go down the hill.
  She was ruined by Delos being made a free port, and could not afford to keep
  up her fleet. Since then things have been going from bad to worse. You
  wouldn't believe, sir, the things that have happened almost in the sight of
  Rome. Two years ago half of a praetor's establishment was carried off as it
  was on its way along the coast-road from Barium to Brundisium, and it was
  only by good luck that they did not lay hands upon the great man himself. He
  happened to have gone on in advance instead of being behind, as was usual.
  Perhaps if they had caught him something might have been done. As it is,
  nobody seems to care."</p>

  <p>The next day the <i>Ino</i> herself had what looked like a narrow escape.
  At daybreak the look-out man descried in the offing a craft of suspicious-
  looking build, long, and low in the water. It was then almost a dead calm,
  and if the stranger was a pirate, as seemed only too likely, her long sweeps
  would soon bring her dangerously near. "We will have a fight for it," said
  the captain, as he inspected his stock of arms.</p>

  <p>Happily the occasion to use them never arrived. A brisk breeze sprang up
  as the sun rose higher, and the <i>Ino</i>, which was an excellent sailer,
  soon left the strange ship far behind. The same evening she was moored to one
  of the quays in the harbour of Brundisium. By noon next day Cleanor was well
  on his way along the great Appian Road to Rome.</p>

  <p>It was yet early in the autumn, the unhealthiest time of the year, then as
  now, for the Italian capital, and the city was empty, as far at least as its
  wealthier inhabitants were concerned. The translation committee, however, was
  about to commence its work, which was considered to be urgent. Scipio, with
  the thoughtful kindness which was characteristic of him, had placed a villa
  of his own near Ostia at the disposal of the members, and they were able to
  devote themselves to their task under favourable conditions of health and
  quiet. Under these pleasant circumstances the work progressed rapidly.
  Cleanor's assistance was found to be of the greatest value. He was now
  equally familiar with the three languages, Carthaginian, Greek, and Latin.
  The first two had been spoken almost indifferently in his native town; the
  third he had learned grammatically in his childhood, and he had since
  acquired the colloquial use of it. It is easy to understand how useful an
  educated man, who had had these unusual advantages, could be in dealing with
  a book which was largely concerned with common things and the affairs of
  everyday life. Not one of his colleagues united in himself so many
  qualifications.</p>

  <p>The time, taken up as it was with this occupation, passed quickly, and, on
  the whole, pleasantly enough. Still, the continuous labour, and the sedentary
  life, so unlike the continuous activity in which he had spent the preceding
  months, began to tell upon his health and spirits, and he was glad when the
  approach of the Holidays of Saturn promised an interval of rest and,
  possibly, a change of scene. It was with no small delight that early in
  December he received a letter from the younger Scipio. It was as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>L. Cornelius Scipio to his friend Cleanor, heartily greeting.</i></p>

  <p><i>This is but the third day since I arrived in Italy, and I hasten to
  make sure that we should meet as soon as possible. My aunt Cornelia, from
  whose villa at Misenum I am now writing, invites you, as I write at her
  request, to spend here the approaching holiday. She desires me to say that
  she now hears for the first time where you are and what you are doing. Other
  things concerning you have been told her, not without much praise, by some
  whose names I need not mention. Come, therefore, as soon as circumstances
  permit. That you will come welcome to many, and especially to me, be assured.
  Farewell!</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap34"
     name="chap34"></a>XXXIV. &mdash; AT MISENUM</h2>

  <p class="first">CORNELIA, the "Mother of the Gracchi", was at this time not
  far from fifty years of age, but retained by favour of nature, often so
  capricious in what she gives or takes away, much of the beauty of youth. Left
  a widow with a numerous family&mdash;she had borne twelve children to her
  husband, but all had not survived&mdash;she had found a royal suitor in
  Ptolemy, king of Egypt. This suit it had probably not caused her any effort
  to decline. A daughter of the great Cornelian house would have disdained in
  any case an alliance with so doubtful a race as the Ptolemies, and this
  particular Ptolemy, whose bloated appearance had earned him the name of
  Physcon, was a degenerate scion of it. But Cornelia had had serious troubles.
  Of her twelve children two only were now alive, Tiberius, now a lad of
  seventeen, and Caius, a child of five. Both, indeed, gave the fairest
  promise; the elder, though he had but lately assumed the manly gown, had
  exhausted such education as Roman teachers could then supply, and was already
  an accomplished rhetorician; the younger was a boy of singular beauty and
  intelligence. But Cornelia, a remarkably clear-sighted woman, had already
  begun to view with alarm the rapid development of Tiberius's character. The
  young man's political tendencies were strongly marked, and they seemed likely
  to bring him into dangerous collision with the aristocratic traditions of his
  mother's house. As for Caius, he was self-willed and imperious to an
  extraordinary degree. Still, no mother could have been prouder of her
  children, as none certainly could have been more devoted to them.</p>

  <p>At this particular time, however, when Cleanor paid his first visit to the
  villa at Misenum, all was brightness and gaiety. Theoxena and her daughter
  had learned by this time to feel themselves thoroughly at home in Cornelia's
  hospitable house. The elder woman had suffered so much in the past that the
  best happiness which could be hoped for her was peace; but Daphne had
  blossomed out into a most attractive personality. There was a peculiar
  radiance about her beauty, which had all the greater charm because the girl's
  own disposition and the gracious example of her hostess, a very pearl among
  women, tempered it with a certain air of virginal reserve. Cleanor she met at
  first with her old sisterly frankness, but there was an ardour in the young
  man's glance, and a thrill in his voice&mdash;though he vainly attempted to
  subdue them into the greeting of a respectful affection&mdash;which seemed to
  alarm her. As for Cleanor, after the first day spent in her company, he could
  doubt no longer as to the real nature of his feelings. Daphne would be
  thenceforward the one woman in the world for him.</p>

  <p>The holiday, which was prolonged to the beginning of the new year, passed
  only too quickly. The days were spent either in hare- hunting&mdash;larger
  game was not to be found in a region already thickly populated&mdash;or in
  excursions on the water, which were favoured by weather that, though it was
  the depth of winter, was remarkably calm and warm. Possibly the most
  delightful expedition of the season was the ascent of Vesuvius, then clothed
  almost to the summit with lovely woods, and giving no sign of the hidden
  forces which, two centuries later, were to spread desolation over the fairest
  region of Italy.</p>

  <p>The evenings were begun by a meal, simply yet elegantly served, at which
  the whole party assembled, even the little Caius being allowed to be present
  for at least a time. The meal over there was no lack of entertainment.
  Tiberius was an accomplished reciter, and could give one of Terence's
  comedies with an artistic variety of voice and emphasis. Cleanor charmed the
  company with a passage from Homer, from Pindar, or from one of the great
  Athenian dramatists. Sometimes, by special request, he would dance the
  Pyrrhic dance, a pastime which in sterner Roman society would have more than
  savoured of frivolity. And now and then Daphne was persuaded to sing to the
  lute an exquisite little lyric from Stesichorus.</p>

  <p>The last day of the year, which was also to be the last of the most
  delightful of visits, Cleanor determined to make as long as possible. Rising
  as soon as the first streaks of dawn began to show themselves in the sky, he
  began to explore more thoroughly than he had before an opportunity of doing,
  the beautifully ordered gardens which surrounded the villa. Following a path
  of velvet sward, sheltered on either side by shrubberies of box-wood, he came
  to a spot which gave him a wide prospect over the lovely bay of Naples. He
  noticed, but in the most casual way, the figure of a gardener, who was busy,
  as it seemed, in trimming the surrounding shrubs, the whole spot, except on
  that side which fronted the sea, being protected from the wind by a dense
  growth of box and laurel, arbutus and bay.</p>

  <p>He threw himself down on a rustic bench and gazed on the scene before him.
  He was looking westward, and the sea at his feet lay in shadow, a dark purple
  in colour. In the distance the sun was just touching with golden light the
  crags of Prochyta and of the more remote Inarimé. For a time the beauty of
  the scene wholly occupied him, for nature stirred the hearts of the men of
  those days even as it stirs ours, though they had only begun to give their
  feelings articulate expression.</p>

  <p>Then his thoughts recurred to what was the dominant emotion of the time
  with him, his love for Daphne. How, he asked himself, how should he make it
  known? How should he approach her? To speak directly, at least in the first
  instance, was not the custom of his race, though doubtless love, there as
  elsewhere, made exceptions of his own to the severest rule. Through her
  mother? But Theoxena was, he knew, only too thoroughly devoted to him. To her
  his wish would be a command; she would make it a matter of filial obedience
  with her daughter, and he wanted the voluntary submission that was wholly
  free. Through Cornelia? But would she favour such an alliance? She was a
  noble of the nobles, filled with the keenest sympathy for the people, but
  profoundly conscious the social difference between her class and them and
  with her own class she would certainly rank the well- born Cleanor.</p>

  <p>Well, he said to himself, after a pause of reflection, which did not seem
  to make the matter clearer, "these things will settle themselves. I love her,
  and I think she loves me, so that nothing will keep us apart." And he broke
  into the beautiful choric song of the <i>Antigone</i>&mdash;for it was his
  habit, as it is the habit of all true lovers of poetry, thus to interrupt his
  solitary musings&mdash;</p>

  <p class="cp"><i>"O love invincible!"</i></p>

  <p>After this came a stave of Alcaeus, and after this again a piece of
  melodious tenderness from Sappho.</p>

  <p>As he turned to retrace his steps to the house, for he had risen early,
  and the keen morning air made him feel that he had fasted long, he was
  startled to hear his name called from behind him, not the name by which he
  was known to the world, but the pet family name, which he had not heard since
  the home of his childhood had vanished in fire and blood.</p>

  <p>"Cle," said the voice, and its tones seemed to be strangely familiar. He
  turned; no one was within sight but the gardener. The man had dropped the
  shears, and stood with his hands stretched out in a supplicating gesture.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he cried; "what or whom do you want?" He took two or three
  steps forward, and as he approached there seemed to be something strangely
  familiar in the figure before him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is&mdash;" and the speaker swayed to and fro for a moment, and
  then fell unconscious to the ground. The wide-brimmed hat, which had been
  drawn down low over the face, to conceal, as it seemed, the features, was
  displaced by the fall, and revealed the graceful contour of the forehead, and
  the shapely head covered with short curls of sunny gold.</p>

  <p>"Great Zeus!" cried Cleanor, as he lifted the prostrate figure from the
  ground. "Great Zeus! if I am not mad or dreaming, this is Cleoné come to life
  again."</p>

  <p>Close by a tiny spring trickled down from a rock. Cleanor held his cap
  beneath it till it was half full, and dashed the water in his sister's face.
  She drew two or three deep breaths, and then opened her eyes. Vacant at
  first, for she could not remember where she was or what had happened, they
  soon became radiant with happy light.</p>

  <p>"Dearest brother," she murmured, "have I found you again? But come to my
  little hut&mdash;it is close by. There you shall hear my story, and we will
  consider what is to be done."</p>

  <p>Briefly put, for in the actual telling it was interrupted, as may be
  supposes, with numberless exclamations and questions, Cleoné's story was
  this:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I remember nothing after I was struck down by a blow from a soldier's
  sword in the market-place of Chelys, till I found myself in the hold of a
  ship at sea."</p>

  <p>"Then you were not killed?" cried Cleanor.</p>

  <p>"It seems not," said the girl with a merry laugh, "for even were I an
  Eurydice there was no Orpheus to bring me back from the house of Hades."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the young man, "now I begin to understand what old Judas meant.
  He said, you must know, that they bribed the soldiers not to kill the
  prisoners, but to stun them."</p>

  <p>"Well, as I was saying, I found myself in the hold of a ship which was
  evidently making very bad weather. I was lying with my head close to the
  deck, and I could hear two men talking just over me. There was such a roaring
  of the wind, and such a creaking of timbers, that I lost a good deal of what
  they said. Still I could make out something. Someone&mdash;I supposed it was
  the captain&mdash;was cursing his ill-luck. 'Here,' he said, 'is a bit of
  cursed spite&mdash;as good a speculation as ever I made in my life all comes
  to nothing. There are fifty as likely young fellows as I have had the
  handling of since I went into the business five-and- twenty years ago down
  there, and what is going to become of them? They are worth two hundred
  thousand sesterces if they are worth one, and now the whole lot is going to
  the bottom.' 'What is the odds?' growled the other, whom I took to be the
  steersman. 'What is the odds if you are going too?' 'I tell you what,' said
  the other again after a pause, 'you should give the fellows a chance. Open
  the hatches, and let them get to land if they can.' 'What is the good?'
  answered the captain sulkily; 'they may drown for all I care.' 'Nay, but you
  talk like a fool. If they live, they are still yours, and you may get hold of
  them, or, at least, of some of them again.' 'True,' said the owner, 'that is
  so. They shall have a chance.' A minute or two afterwards the hatches were
  opened, and the fellow cried, 'Up with you as quick as you can? The ship
  hasn't many minutes to float, and if you don't want to go to the bottom with
  her, now is your time.' About two score out of the fifty clambered upon deck.
  Some had never recovered from the blow which had stunned them&mdash;it can't
  be an easy thing to give just the right sort of stroke&mdash;and some, I take
  it, were so far gone with sea-sickness that they did not care to move. As for
  me, I felt a little dazed; sea-sickness never troubles me, as you know. We
  got up on deck only just in time, the ship was already close upon the rocks.
  The next minute she struck. What happened to the crew and to my companions is
  more than I can say; all I know is that I have never seen one of them since,
  except, indeed, sole dead bodies that I found on the shore next morning. I
  had a desperate struggle to get to land, and, indeed, I never should have
  done it, though, as you know, I am no bad swimmer, but that an extra big wave
  threw me up almost high and dry, and I had just strength enough to crawl away
  out of reach of the sea. The rest of the night&mdash;it was about the middle
  of the third watch, as near as I could guess, when this happened&mdash;I
  passed in a thicket in a bed of dry leaves, where I slept as soundly as ever
  I did in my life. The next day I rigged myself out with clothes that I took
  from the dead men on the shore&mdash;it was no robbery, I thought, poor
  fellows! I found some money, too, in their pockets. Following a road which
  led in-land, I came to a village where there was a tavern. Here I got some
  bread and a draught of sour wine. I thought it safest, I should tell you, to
  pretend to be deaf and dumb, and made them to understand by signs that I
  wanted something to eat and drink. I paid for what I had, but was careful to
  let the people know that I had very little, for I made up the few coppers
  that were wanted from one place and another. Then I got them to understand
  that I wanted to work for my living. First I made as if I were digging, then
  as if I were sawing wood. They happened to want someone, for it was a busy
  time of the year, and they saw that they could get the work done very
  cheaply, for they gave me no pay besides my food and lodging in an outhouse,
  which, happily, I had to myself. Here I stopped for about a month. Then I
  overheard some people talking of a great lady who lived in the neighbourhood.
  She was a widow, they said, and managed every- thing&mdash;house and garden
  and farm&mdash;all by herself. That, I thought to myself, is the place for
  me. Perhaps some day I shall be able to tell her my story. However, the day
  has never come. I got employment just in the same way as I did at the tavern,
  and I have the little hut to myself, where I look after some fowls and
  pigeons. But, somehow, I could never summon up courage to speak.</p>

  <p>However, I always went on hoping and hoping, and now, dearest Cleanor,
  that you are come, all will be right."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the young man, "and the first thing, my dear Cleoné, will be
  to get you some proper clothes."</p>

  <p>The girl blushed.</p>

  <p>"By Castor!" she said, "I had almost forgotten that I was dressed as a
  man. But how will you manage it?"</p>

  <p>"Easily enough," replied her brother. "The lady Cornelia has an excellent
  housekeeper with whom I am in high favour; I don't doubt that she will let me
  have everything I want. But I must go; the sooner we manage this the
  better."</p>

  <p>Poor Cleoné, woman-like, felt the courage which had never failed before
  desert her when she had to part even for half an hour with her long-lost
  brother. She clung to him, and wept piteously. "Don't leave me," she
  sobbed.</p>

  <p>The young man, to whom this sort of thing was quite a anew experience,
  looked at her with astonishment. "What, Cleoné, is the meaning of this after
  all you have gone through?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, smiling through her tears, "I am a fool. And besides,"
  she went on, looking at her dirty and ragged garments, "I do want some decent
  clothes."</p>

  <p>The good Pollia, who acted as wardrobe-keeper, mother-of-the-maids, and
  housekeeper in general to Cornelia, was not a little astonished when Cleanor
  asked her to supply him with the various articles of a young lady's toilet,
  not so numerous in those days, it should be mentioned, as they are now. He
  was a great favourite, however, and she asked no questions, probably thinking
  that some joke was being meditated. She searched accordingly among the
  treasures in her charge, and had no difficulty in finding all that was
  wanted.</p>

  <p>Fashions did not change in those days as they change under the vagaries of
  modern taste. Women were careful, indeed perhaps more careful than they are
  now, to suit their dress to their age. But what the mother had worn at
  twenty, the daughter, reaching the same years, might wear without even the
  suspicion of oddity, and the garments might be handed down, if they were of
  the quality that was suited to so long a life, to yet another generation.</p>

  <p>Cleanor was soon making his way with an armful of suitable apparel to the
  gardener's hut. Cleoné, who seemed to be bent on making up as quickly as
  possible for her enforced separation from all feminine vanities, received the
  precious burden with a shriek of delight. When she emerged, half an hour
  afterwards, from her hut it would have passed all human skill to recognize in
  the brilliant young beauty who held Cleanor's hand the shabby deaf-mute who
  for many months past had plied his solitary task in Cornelia's gardens.</p>

  <p>All these confidences and preparations had taken time, and the house party
  had just assembled for the midday meal when the pair walked into the
  dining-room. Never since Misenum got its name had the place seen a more
  startling sight. At first it seemed as if Cleanor had found his double, for
  brother and sister were curiously alike. But the time that had passed since
  they were so tragically parted had changed them not a little. The young man
  had grown in height, and his frame, knit by the continual activities of an
  adventurous life, had developed the ampler proportions that became his sex.
  The girl was his very image, but now on a somewhat smaller scale. A fairer
  couple had never been seen in Italy.</p>

  <p>"Cleanor has turned into Apollo," cried the little Caius, "and he has
  brought Diana with him."</p>

  <p>As for the rest of the company, they gazed with an astonishment that was
  almost stupefaction on the scene. Cornelia was the first to recover herself.
  She advanced to greet the new-comer. "You are welcome," she said, "for your
  brother's sake&mdash;for Cleanor must surely be your brother&mdash;and, I am
  sure, for your own." Then Theoxena threw herself at the girl's feet and
  clasped her knees. "It Cleoné," she cried. "The gods have nothing more to
  give me." Little Cephalus kissed her hand, and Daphne, somewhat shy at first
  of the splendid stranger, was not long behind with an affectionate
  greeting.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," said Cornelia, "till you have eaten and drunk. For the
  present," she said, smiling at the little Caius, "they will have to be
  content without ambrosia and nectar."</p>

  <p>The meal ended, Cornelia heard the whole story. Her mind, always eminently
  practical, discerned at once the first thing that had to be done.</p>

  <p>"We must assure without delay," she said, "this young lady's civil status.
  At present it would be very perplexing to say who or what she is."</p>

  <p>A message was immediately despatched to the nearest town with a letter
  requiring the immediate presence of the resident notary. He arrived before
  sunset, and by a formal act of emancipation Cleoné, slave of Cornelia, was
  made free.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, my daughter," she said, "if I speak of you as my slave. And
  indeed my title is a very weak one; no one, however, is likely to make out a
  better. Meanwhile, as far as I can secure your freedom, you are free."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap35"
     name="chap35"></a>XXXV. &mdash; THE WORLD WELL LOST</h2>

  <p class="first">CLEANOR had been back in Rome some four months, and had
  nearly completed his work with the committee of translation, when he received
  a visit from the young Scipio. The latter had not been one of the party at
  Misenum during the holidays of Saturn, having been summoned to Sicily to fill
  a casual vacancy on the staff of the quaestor in that province.</p>

  <p>Well," said Cleanor, after an affectionate exchange of greetings, "and how
  did you like your quaestor's work in Sicily?"</p>

  <p>"I found it most interesting," replied the young man, "and, I must say,
  most agreeable. My name made me most welcome everywhere. You can hardly
  imagine what an impression my uncle's action in giving back the statues to
  the cities has made on the whole island. The simple fact that I was his
  nephew was enough to make them almost worship me. I happened to be at
  Agrigentum when the famous Bull was solemnly put back into its place. If I
  had been the founder of the city come to life again I could not have been
  treated with more respect. I should be quite ashamed to describe all the
  oratings and crownings and embracings that I went through. In fact, if I had
  any complaint to make, it would be that to a modest young man myself the
  honours were just a little overpowering."</p>

  <p>"And what," asked Cleanor, "are you going do now?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied the young Roman, "is just what I want to talk to you
  about. Lentulus, who is proconsul of Sicily, as I dare say you know, has
  expressed himself very handsomely about my services, and, what is more, has
  offered to propose me as one of the regular quaestors for next year. This is
  all the more satisfactory because he is no kinsman of mine, and in fact is
  not on the same side in politics as my uncle. If my uncle were to nominate
  me, I should probably get my election, but this will make it quite
  certain."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cleanor, "of course you won't hesitate to accept. I give you
  my congratulations in advance. It will be the first step in the ladder, and
  we shall see you climb, as your forbears have climbed before you, to be
  aedile, praetor, consul."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the young man, "that is so. It is the first step, and I
  could not take it under better auspices, but&mdash;" and he paused, looking
  like anything but the ambitious young man before whom the greatest career in
  the world was opening.</p>

  <p>"What is the hindrance, then?" asked the young Greek.</p>

  <p>Scipio's embarrassment seemed to increase. "I have been to my aunt
  Cornelia's at Misenum," he added after a long pause.</p>

  <p>"And what was her advice?" asked Cleanor. "Surely she had nothing to say
  against it. I should even have thought, as far as I know anything of your
  Roman politics, that she would have been especially well pleased to see you
  come out in public life under the auspices of Lentulus."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!" returned the young Roman. "That was exactly her view.
  But&mdash;" and the speaker paused in still greater embarrassment than ever.
  "Well&mdash;I must say it sooner or later&mdash;I have seen your sister."</p>

  <p>"My sister! What has my sister got to do with it?" asked Cleanor in utter
  bewilderment. "I don't suppose you asked her advice, and if you did, she
  would not hinder you, I should suppose, from serving your country."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Scipio, "I did ask her, though not exactly for her advice,
  and she said exactly what you supposed she would say."</p>

  <p>"Then where is the difficulty? You want the thing yourself; all your
  friends advise you to take the chances. What is it that hinders? For heaven's
  sake, my friend, do explain what you mean, for it is quite past my
  understanding."</p>

  <p>"Then, Cleanor, listen; if I offend you, as I can hardly help doing, be
  patient with me. First and foremost, then, I love your sister Cleoné. It is
  the dearest wish of my heart to make her my wife, and I think, that is, I
  hope, that she cares a little for me."</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to hear it," cried the young Greek, as he sprang up and
  seized his friend's hands. "I am delighted to hear it. There isn't a better
  or braver girl in the world, if I may say so much of my own sister. You have
  heard her story, of course. Well, she deserves a good husband, if ever a girl
  did, and I am glad to think that she is likely to find one."</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to hear you say so, though I don't feel anything like
  worthy of her. But now comes what I find it so hard to say. Cleoné is a match
  for anyone in the world, in birth as well as in herself. But, in the eyes of
  our law, she is not a match for a Roman citizen. By some accursed
  chance&mdash;though, indeed, but for this said chance I should never have
  seen her&mdash;she was made a slave, and is now a freed woman. Out of that
  status nothing, as far as I know, can raise her, and being in that status she
  cannot be my wife. In one sense there may be a marriage between us, but it
  would not be a marriage that would give her the rights and privileges of a
  Roman matron; it would not be a marriage which would open to our children the
  career of a Roman citizen. There, my dear friend, the murder is out; that is
  the bare fact, and if it seems an insult to you&mdash;and an insult, I fear,
  it must seem&mdash;pray remember that it is not of my making or doing."</p>

  <p>"My dear friend," said Cleanor, "I won't pretend that what you have said
  hasn't hurt me. We have always been accustomed to think ourselves as good as
  anybody in point of birth and standing. In fact we Greeks are not a little
  exclusive, and it is a blow to be told that we are ourselves outside the
  social pale. But for you, I assure you I haven't a feeling that is not all
  friendship. I don't draw back from a single word of what I said about my
  sister. Still we must consider; and of course, before all things, she must
  know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she must know," replied Scipio. "Of course I have said nothing. She
  does not know&mdash;so far at least as anything that I have said is
  concerned&mdash;that I love her."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cleanor, "we will leave that then for the present. Now listen
  to what I have been thinking about myself and my own future. I am in love,
  too, and you have seen the lady. Can you guess who it is?"</p>

  <p>"Guess!" said Scipio with a smile. "There is no need of guessing. I have
  known it a long time. Well, I will allow that your Daphne is the fairest
  woman in the world,&mdash;with, of course, one exception."</p>

  <p>"Well, when a man is in my plight, he naturally, if he is worthy of being
  called a man, begins to think of his future. And what future have I here in
  Italy? I have property enough to live upon, but that is all. But what career
  is there before me? I have turned the matter over in my mind, and I have
  asked for information from others. There seems to be positively but one thing
  for a man in my situation to do. I might become teacher of rhetoric. That is
  the one solitary employment open to a Greek stranger, and a very precarious
  employment too. The old-fashion nobles don't like Greek rhetoricians, and it
  is quite possible that some fine day I might find my banished. That, you will
  allow, is not a prospect with which a man will readily content himself.</p>

  <p>"And do you see any way out of it?" ask Scipio.</p>

  <p>"I have dreams," replied the young Greek, "and I have always had, and the
  dreams of to-day fit on curiously enough to the dreams of the past. When I
  was a boy I had an ambition to be something beyond the chief citizen of
  Chelys. As for Carthage, though no one thought that her end was so near, I
  knew that there was nothing there to satisfy me, even if her honours had been
  open to me. But there is a world beyond Carthage, and even beyond Rome. It is
  of that that I dreamed then, and of which I dream still. Say, Scipio, my
  friend, shall we go and look for it?"</p>

  <p>The young men had a long talk on the subject. Cleanor poured out the store
  of knowledge which, with an enthusiasm that dated back to very early years
  indeed, he had gathered from every available source. There was, of course, a
  plentiful admixture of fiction, or fact so transmuted and idealized that it
  almost had become fiction. There were legends and traditions, travellers'
  tales, and yarns of adventurous seamen; but there was also a solid substratum
  of truth. Cleanor's sheet-anchor, so to speak, was the famous
  Circumnavigation of Hanno. That famous voyager had beyond all doubt passed
  into the great western ocean through the Pillars of Hercules, and turning
  southward had seen many a strange and beautiful land, aye, and lived to bring
  back the report of them. All these things the ardent Greek dwelt upon with an
  enthusiasm which at last fired the duller fancy of the Roman. Scipio left the
  house more than half persuaded.</p>

  <p>A few days afterwards Cleanor, having fairly finished his part in the work
  which had so long occupied his leisure, went down with Scipio to Misenum.
  They had agreed to say nothing of their scheme till they had heard what their
  hostess had to say to it. Cornelia was doubtful. Cleanor indeed had her
  fullest sympathy when he declared that he could not be content with any
  career that fate had left open for him, and that he must seek one elsewhere.
  It was about her great-nephew that she doubted. She could not bring herself
  to think him right when he proposed to relinquish his Roman birthright. Not
  for any woman, not though she was, as Cleoné, one among ten thousand, should
  a man give up the splendid opportunities of service and reward which Rome
  held forth to her sons.</p>

  <p>The young man found an unexpected ally in his cousin Tiberius. "My duty,"
  he said, "keeps me here; but if I could choose my own way, I would join your
  search. Sometimes I seem to see further into the future than is commonly
  given to man, and what I see is dark with the shadow of disaster and death.
  Our great kinsman has won splendid victories for Rome, and has others to win,
  but I doubt whether the gods have not granted these victories to our country
  more in wrath than in love. When we have trodden all our foes and rivals
  under our feet we shall turn our swords upon ourselves. The wealth of the
  world that is pouring into our treasury will kindle to a deadlier rage the
  eternal quarrel between those who have and those who have not. My lot is cast
  in with the unhappy. The love of woman is not for me; I shall not be able
  even to keep the affection of my kinsfolk. But I would not avoid my fate,
  even if I could. You are happier. It would be as great a folly for you to
  stay, as it would be a crime for me to depart."</p>

  <p>After this Cornelia, who was always overawed when the deeper nature of her
  son revealed itself, silently withdrew her opposition. The elder Scipio, who
  would almost certainly have used all his influence to bring it to nothing,
  was fortunately absent from Italy. Daphne put no hindrance in the way. She
  had secretly worshipped the magnificent hero&mdash;for such he seemed to
  her&mdash;who had rescued her and hers from the deadliest peril, and was
  ready to follow him, if he willed it, to the ends of the world, and, if it
  might be, even beyond it.</p>

  <p>But Scipio found Cleoné far more difficult to deal with. She was very far
  from disdaining his love, but it filled her with something like rage to think
  that for her sake he should abandon his career. It was partly that her pride
  was touched. That she, the long-descended daughter of heroes, who reckoned
  Ion himself among her far-away ancestors, should bring humiliation and
  disability on the man to whom she gave her hand! The bare idea was beyond
  endurance. Such love was a disgrace to both of them. She peremptorily
  commanded her suitor to forget it. But this stern mood did not last. She was
  moved not a little by the sight of Daphne's happiness. She was conscious of a
  craving in her own heart for a happiness of her own. She had herself suffered
  so much, and it was hard, when at last the sunshine came, to have to shut it
  out, and still to sit in the darkness. Then the strongest influences were
  brought to bear upon her. Her brother was urgent in his entreaties that she
  should not mar their plan. And her refusal would mar it. He could not go if
  she stayed behind. And the sight of Scipio's suffering touched her, for
  indeed she loved him tenderly. In the end she gave way.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap36"
     name="chap36"></a>XXXVI. &mdash; BEYOND THE SUNSET</h2>

  <p class="first">THE party, which was increased by some manumitted slaves of
  Greek origin, sailed for Utica in the early autumn of the year, and reached
  that port after a quick and prosperous voyage. Their first destination was
  the court of King Gulussa. It so happened that their arrival coincided with a
  meeting of the three brothers. One of the wilder tribes on the desert border
  had invaded the kingdom, and it was necessary to make arrangements for an
  expedition of more than usual proportions. Micipsa had brought with him his
  two sons, and a younger lad, Jugurtha by name, his son by a wife of inferior
  rank, of whom we have heard before, and of whom the world was to hear a great
  deal more before many years had passed.</p>

  <p>Gulussa and his brother kings gave a most complimentary welcome to their
  guests. But when Cleanor, who was naturally the spokesman of the party,
  unfolded his scheme, they took no pains to conceal their incredulity.</p>

  <p>"It would be a thousand pities," said Gulussa, "if you were to throw away
  your lives on a romantic folly of this kind. Why not stop here, where you
  have something ready to your hands, not quite so splendid as these dreams of
  yours, but, believe me, a hundred times more solid and real. Now, listen to
  what I have got to say. We&mdash;that is, my brothers and I&mdash;have been
  talking matters over since you came, and we have made up our minds to make
  you an offer that it may be really worth your while to accept. Enter our
  service; you are both skilful soldiers. My father, than whom there never was
  a better judge of men, thought very highly of you, Cleanor; the name of
  Scipio would be commendation enough, even if we did not know how worthily it
  is borne by your friend. Details we can settle afterwards, but you may depend
  upon it, that you will never have to find fault with our liberality. Don't
  answer at once," Gulussa went on, as Cleanor was beginning to reply, "but
  think the matter over carefully, and let us know your decision, say, three
  days hence."</p>

  <p>The princes spared no pains to make their guests' sojourn at court
  agreeable to them. A great hunting party was arranged for each day, and the
  two young men were furnished with magnificent mounts and allotted the best
  places. At the banquet which followed they occupied seats of honour.
  Meanwhile the ladies of the party were welcomed in the royal harem, received
  the most flattering attention from the queens and princesses, and were loaded
  with handsome presents.</p>

  <p>"We might do worse than stay, Cleanor," said Scipio to his friend, for his
  unimaginative temper could not help comparing these present splendours with
  the remote prospects of Cleanor's scheme, not a little to the disadvantage of
  the latter.</p>

  <p>Cleanor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"How long do you think it would last? I don't say anything about the
  chances that our hosts might not always be as friendly as they are now. They
  are a fickle race. But let that pass. Yet how long will this Numidian kingdom
  stand? I remember what the old king said when I was in attendance on him
  before he died. He was sure that Rome would swallow it up before long. There
  is sure to be some quarrel sooner or later, and then who can doubt which of
  the two will go to the wall. And there is another thing. If the kingdom
  lasts, will it always be in the same hands? Have you noticed that lad
  Jugurtha? I remember that the old king warned me specially against him. 'That
  viper,' he called him; and as King Gulussa said the other day, Masinissa was
  an excellent judge of character. The brothers are elderly men, and, to judge
  from their looks, not very strong. Micipsa's two sons, who by rights should
  come after him, are feeble creatures; Jugurtha is his father's favourite, and
  he will come to the top of the tree sooner or later. And Jugurtha hates us;
  you first, perhaps because you are a Roman, and his hatred for the Romans is
  a proverb,&mdash;and me next. No, it would not be well, I am sure, in any
  case to stop here; and to stop with a chance of finding ourselves under
  Jugurtha's thumb would be madness."</p>

  <p>Scipio could not but acknowledge the force of these arguments, and gave
  way. At the appointed time the friends announced their decision to the kings.
  Gulussa shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "you must have your own way. If you should come
  back&mdash;very few do come back, I am told&mdash;and I am still alive, you
  will find me as ready to be your friend as ever. Meanwhile let us do what we
  can for you. The queen tells me that you have brought your wives that are to
  be with you. Let us have the honour of providing your marriage feast, and
  remain with us afterwards for as long as you like and may find convenient. If
  you are bent on this wild voyage of yours you must go prepared."</p>

  <p>The friends gladly accepted this hospitable invitation. Preparations were
  at once commenced for performing the marriage ceremonies with due solemnity.
  While these were going on, Cleanor made his way to the coast to find a
  captain and crew who would be willing to take part in his adventure.</p>

  <p>His first care was to discover Syphax, the old sailor with whom, as you
  may remember, he had made his voyage to Sicily. The old man listened with
  eager interest to his exposition of his plans, but shook his head when the
  question whether he would go was put to him.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said, "if you had only come to me with this scheme twenty years
  ago! But what am I saying? old fool that I am! Twenty years ago you were
  little more than a baby in arms. I mean that I am too old. I am not fit for
  anything more now than pottering about with my fishing-lines. And there is my
  old wife. She couldn't go, poor thing; she hasn't set her foot outside the
  hut for the last ten years, and I certainly could not go without her. But
  there's my son Mago. He can't settle down in the new state of things, for
  Rome is likely to be a much harder master than Carthage ever was. Mago is
  your man; let me send for him.</p>

  <p>Mago came, and Cleanor talked his plans over with him, and found him all
  that he wanted. The general scheme, and such particulars as the capacity of
  the vessel required, the Mores, the cargo of articles for trade with native
  tribes, were settled between them, and Mago was left to carry out the
  details, while Cleanor returned to the court of King Gulussa.</p>

  <p>Two months later,&mdash;for I shall not weary my readers with describing
  the marriage festivities, the good ship <i>Pallas</i> lay ready for sea inn
  the harbour of Utica. The piers and quays were filled with a dense crowd of
  spectators, for the fame of this adventurous voyage had spread through the
  city, and brought together a multitude of curious sight-seers. Loud and
  hearty were the cheers that went up as a soft breeze from the east slowly
  filled the sails, and the Pallas&mdash;her prow appropriately adorned with
  the figure of the goddess friend of Ulysses, prince of adventurous
  heroes&mdash;forged her way round the end of the western pier and shaped a
  course towards the setting sun.</p>

  <p>Sail on, swift ship, to the region that lies beyond the darkness of the
  west. You leave behind you a world over which the shadows of civil strife and
  desolating war are gathering. Who knows what lies before you&mdash;Islands of
  the Blest, where nature smiles for ever, her fair face untouched by frost or
  storm, and where man still keeps primeval faith and innocence; or, perhaps,
  to a world that is but a meaner copy of that from which you are fleeing? Yet
  sail on, happy at least for the hour that is, in the unfaltering confidence
  of youth and hope.</p>
