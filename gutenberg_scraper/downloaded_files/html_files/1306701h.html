  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">NITA CLIVE was sitting in a deck chair on the well-trimmed
  lawn, gazing, with a slight pucker between her well-trimmed eyebrows, at what
  was described by Messrs. Truman &amp; Co., Estate Agents and Purveyors of
  Adjectives, as "Sunningbourne Lodge, Ascot; a charming, detached,
  picturesque, creeper-clad, freehold residential property, standing in a
  matured, old-world garden of three acres." At this time of the year both the
  house, draped with greenery so that not a brick was visible, and the garden,
  with its riot of rambler roses in full bloom, bore witness to the accuracy of
  Messrs. Truman &amp; Co.'s description.</p>

  <p>If called upon to describe Mrs. Clive as she sat there with her dark hair
  confessing to the sunlight a secret tendency to be auburn, her mouth rather
  wistful, and her grey eyes thoughtful, Messrs. Truman &amp; Co. would
  probably have used some of the same adjectives, "Charming" and "picturesque,"
  as applied to the slim, girlish figure lolling in the deck chair, would have
  stood; "detached" she certainly was at the moment, with an air of being quite
  unaware of her surroundings; and since, three years ago, she had been legally
  conveyed to Selby Clive as his wife, they might have felt justified in
  leaving unaltered the words "freehold residential property."</p>

  <p>Nita glanced again at the letter which she held in her hand. It was from
  Truman &amp; Co. They were pleased to inform her that they had forwarded
  particulars of Sunningbourne Lodge to a Mr. Denham, who was looking for a
  residence in the district, and he proposed calling tomorrow to view the
  property. They trusted that she could conveniently allow him to look over the
  house and grounds and that a satisfactory sale would ensue.</p>

  <p>Nita's glance suddenly shifted to the French windows that gave onto the
  terrace from the library. They were open, and she could see her husband
  busily writing, his grey head, as he bent over his desk, showing up clearly
  against the oak-panelled wall. Selby, she reflected, disliked being
  interrupted when at work, but it might be as well, she thought, to beard him
  at once and show him the letter. It would be a difficult interview. Selby, of
  course, would refuse to discuss the matter seriously&mdash;try to laugh it
  off, as he had always done in the past. Probably, to appease her, he would
  suggest an evening in town&mdash;dinner at some highly respectable restaurant
  where the music was "good" and the food "wholesome," followed by a visit to
  some show, during which he would yawn every few minutes and glance frequently
  at his watch.</p>

  <p>But this time she did not mean to be appeased. She had never seriously
  opposed Selby before, and she was a little nervous as to what would happen
  when he discovered that she had flouted his wishes and taken matters into her
  own hands. She had never seen him angry, and the knowledge that he would
  almost certainly be furious when he heard what she had done gave her a
  strange thrill of excitement&mdash;and nervousness.</p>

  <p>It would be something of an achievement to stir the placid, imperturbable
  Selby to anger; something of an interesting experiment. Rather alarming too,
  perhaps. She had always felt that Selby, if ever he should lose his temper,
  would be a rather terrifying person; which partly explained, no doubt, why
  she had been at pains to avoid making him lose it. Selby set at defiance was
  an unknown quantity, and she supposed, now she came to think of it, that she
  had always been just a little afraid of him.</p>

  <p>Frank O'Ryan had often said as much, and, though she had stoutly denied
  it, Frank was probably right. But she would not be afraid this time. She
  would go to him now, show him the letter, and, if she were compelled to go so
  far, tell him bluntly that it was a choice between parting with Sunningbourne
  Lodge and parting with her. That, after all, was the truth.</p>

  <p>With sudden resolution she got up from her chair, and as she did so she
  saw her husband step through the French windows and come towards her across
  the lawn&mdash;tall, broad-shouldered, grey-haired, his face rather grave,
  looking, as she had often told him, so much like Mr. Justice Somebody at the
  assizes that she wanted to call him "M'lud." She hastily slipped the letter
  into her pocket.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, my dear," he began, "but I'm afraid the trip to Scotland will
  have to be postponed. I've just had a cable from Muller. He reaches England
  at the end of next week, and I must be here to see him."</p>

  <p>Nita frowned.</p>

  <p>"Muller? Have I ever heard of him?"</p>

  <p>"Someone from my mysterious past," smiled her husband. "He's my lawyer in
  Canada&mdash;looks after all my affairs out there for me&mdash;besides being
  one of my oldest friends. There'll be a good deal of business to discuss,
  Nita, and as he'll only be in England for a few days I'm wiring him to come
  straight down here and stay with us. We can make the trip to Scotland
  later."</p>

  <p>"But you won't want me for the business discussions, Selby, and there's no
  reason why I shouldn't go to Scotland, is there?"</p>

  <p>He glanced at her quickly.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;alone?" He was so obviously surprised and shocked that
  Nita could not restrain a smile.</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason why I shouldn't go&mdash;alone?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose not, my dear, except that&mdash;up till now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Except that up till now, ever since we've been married, I've never been
  anywhere without you?" interrupted Nita. "But we can't always live in each
  other's pockets, Selby. Frankly, I can't stand much more of the sort of life
  I've been leading lately&mdash;mooning about down here, doing nothing, seeing
  no one but you and old Sir Ralph Whitcombe&mdash;that stuffy old bore! I
  can't sit in the same room with him unless the window's open. And now, when
  I've a chance of getting away from it all for a few days, you expect me to
  cancel the trip and stay at home to entertain some fusty old lawyer."</p>

  <p>He laid a hand on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, darling," he said. "I had no idea that you felt like that
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I do, Selby."</p>

  <p>He took her hand between his.</p>

  <p>"In that case, my dear," he said, "by all means, go."</p>

  <p>He turned abruptly and went back to the library, and Nita, with a sigh of
  relief, returned to her chair. She had not meant to say all that, but it was
  just as well that it had been said. It was more than time that Selby realized
  that a girl of twenty-five could not go on indefinitely living like a hermit.
  The news had obviously surprised him&mdash;and hurt him. There was a big
  streak of sentimentality in Selby, and it had come as a shock to him that she
  should contemplate going anywhere by herself. But he had been quite nice
  about it. If only he weren't always quite so nice, quite so reasonable, quite
  so irreproachable! It was his flawlessness more than anything else that
  sometimes irritated her almost beyond endurance. If he would sometimes be
  wrong or inconsiderate or selfish or short-tempered, he would be so much
  easier to live with.</p>

  <p>There came the sound of a car in the drive, and a few moments later she
  saw Frank O'Ryan sauntering towards her across the lawn. She greeted him with
  a smile. There were few women below the age of thirty who did not greet Frank
  O'Ryan with a smile, and in her present mood the sight of a good-looking,
  well-dressed young man was more than welcome to Nita.</p>

  <p>He tossed his hat aside and seated himself on the grass beside her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I say, Nita," he exclaimed, glancing round the garden, "you've a
  marvelous spot here. You've improved the place no end."</p>

  <p>"There's this much to be said for Sunningbourne Lodge, Frank," she
  replied: "you can't do anything to it without improving it."</p>

  <p>"Rambler roses all a-bloom, Nita, well-trimmed lawns, picturesque
  creeper-clad house&mdash;what more do you want?"</p>

  <p>She gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"The worst of living in a creeper-clad house is that you're liable to get
  like it."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know. Beats me how you stick it, Nita. You're unhappy, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Are you suddenly becoming observant, Frank?"</p>

  <p>"Not suddenly. I've always wondered why you married old Selby. He's a good
  chap, of course. I admire him immensely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;? You may as well say it, now you've started. When one man says
  he admires another man, it usually means that he's going to start slanging
  him."</p>

  <p>"Well, he's not your sort, Nita. It doesn't need very acute observation to
  see that Selby wants nothing better than to loaf about down here and watch
  the antirrhinums grow, but that sort of thing bores you to tears. You've been
  married for three years, and for two years and eleven months you've been
  wondering how much longer you could stick it. But you haven't the pluck to do
  anything else: you're scared stiff of Selby; and so the farce goes on. Why
  don't you break away?"</p>

  <p>"Break away&mdash;from Selby?"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't mean a thing to you."</p>

  <p>She did not contradict him. She had so often told herself just what Frank
  was telling her now. But then, as now, she had not been sure how far it was
  true. Often, too, during the last three years, in a rather timid, halfhearted
  way, feeling all the time that she was not in earnest about it and that she
  was considering something which could never be, she had toyed with the idea
  of cutting herself free and living a life in which Selby played no part. It
  was only lately that she had begun to look upon a break with her husband as a
  practical proposition; and even now, when she had come to feel that her life,
  like the house, could not suffer alteration without improvement, she still
  hesitated. After all, there were points about Selby. Whatever he had failed
  to give her, he had given her a sense of security&mdash;some solid foot-bold
  in a slippery sort of world. Anchored to him, she was in no danger of
  shipwreck, and however much she might long for adventurous voyaging, there
  were compensations in safe anchorage.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't mean a thing to you," repeated O'Ryan. "Oh, I don't know. I
  admire him, Frank&mdash;tremendously&mdash;and respect him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But?" grinned O'Ryan. "You may as well go on, Nita, now you've started.
  When a woman says she admires and respects a man, it usually means he's the
  last man she'd care to marry. Don't tell me you haven't often wanted to break
  out. You've been thinking about it ever since you were married, but you're
  too much of a Puritan to do it. At one act per year it's already a three-act
  farce. How much longer is it going on?"</p>

  <p>Nita smiled.</p>

  <p>"You're always rather transparent, Frank," she said, "when you start
  giving advice."</p>

  <p>"Women's most hoary delusion," he chuckled. "It's good advice,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"And disinterested?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I've never pretended it was," said O'Ryan. "But, if you
  prefer it, we'll put it bluntly. How much longer am I to be kept waiting?
  You're treating me pretty badly, you know, and we can't go on like this
  forever. I can't, anyway. It isn't fair to expect it of me."</p>

  <p>"And has it occurred to you, Frank, that if I were to do what you want me
  to, it might be a little unfair to Selby?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not thinking of Selby. I'm thinking of you. In a case like this,
  Selby doesn't count. It's bad luck on him, but it can't be helped. Good Lord,
  Nita, if you really cared for Selby I'd be the last man to butt in. But you
  don't. You know damned well that if Selby never kissed you again you'd be
  grateful and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>"It's true," persisted O'Ryan. "Do you suppose I haven't noticed? You hate
  him to touch you, and when he kisses you good-night you put up with it
  because you fancy it's your duty, and pull a face as if you were swallowing a
  dose of poison. That's pretty rotten for you, Nita&mdash;and for me. I've
  stood it for a good time, but I can't stand much more of it."</p>

  <p>He caught her hand suddenly and held it.</p>

  <p>"Nita," he said, "we could be tremendously happy together, couldn't we?
  You know we could. If you'll only give me the chance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She withdrew her hand sharply.</p>

  <p>"When you're proposing to rob a man of his wife, Frank," she said, "it
  isn't wise to hold her hand in full view of the library window."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan's glance travelled swiftly to the open windows of the library and
  back to the girl's face.</p>

  <p>"It's not a case of robbery, Nita," he said. "You'd be giving me something
  you could never give to Selby, and I'd be taking nothing from him. You can't
  rob a man of something he doesn't possess&mdash;and you've never really
  belonged to Selby. Being married to a man and sharing a house with him and
  eating your meals at the same table doesn't mean that you really belong to
  him. It may just be a case of two strangers being miserable together under
  the same roof because neither of them has the courage to leave it. That's how
  it is with you and Selby and I don't see anything to laugh at, Nita."</p>

  <p>She was gazing, with a smile of amusement, at the library windows.</p>

  <p>"I was just wondering, Frank," she said. "Suppose I did agree to do as you
  suggest, what would Selby do when he found out? Do you think he'd just be
  pathetic and broken-hearted and blame himself for not having understood me?"
  She shook her head. "I can't quite see Selby crumpling up and feeling sorry
  for himself. And I don't think he'd get dramatic about it; he hates anything
  approaching a scene, and he's much too self-conscious to be really dramatic.
  He'd feel all the time what a fool he was making of himself."</p>

  <p>"Why worry about that now, Nita? I'm ready to risk&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think I know what he would do," she interrupted. "He wouldn't make the
  least fuss about it. He'd take it all very calmly&mdash;say nothing to either
  of us and go on just as if nothing had happened, until the right moment
  arrived; and then he'd quite coolly put a bullet through each of us."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan shot a quick glance at her.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Nita! You don't really believe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he'd do it ever so kindly, Frank," she added, "but I'm sure that's
  what he'd do&mdash;commit a nice, considerate murder and then refuse to
  discuss the matter further."</p>

  <p>The man forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"I'll risk the bullet if you will," he laughed. "But seriously, my
  dear&mdash;how much longer? Or how soon?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shapely shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Seriously, Frank, I don't know," she told him. "Never, perhaps. If you
  forced me to answer you now, I should certainly say 'never.' But I know
  that's only because Selby has just been rather sweet to me, and I'd feel a
  mean little worm at the moment if I agreed to let him down. Sometimes I
  feel&mdash;oh, I don't know. You're right in a way, of course: I don't belong
  to Selby. I can't ever feel towards him as I feel towards
  you&mdash;sometimes. You don't know how near I've been once or twice to
  turning up with a bag at your flat and saying, 'Here I am, Frank.' I've felt
  that I simply must rush off to you, that I couldn't stand another minute away
  from you. But the feeling has never lasted long enough for me to pack my bag.
  It may do so one day; I don't know. It's rather like cheating, isn't it?
  Cheating Selby, I mean. But I'm cheating him now in a way&mdash;and cheating
  us, too. I'm not sure it wouldn't be more honest to go to Selby and tell him
  frankly that I've made a mistake in marrying him and ask him to call the
  whole thing off in a friendly way."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Nita, don't be crazy! You can't."</p>

  <p>"I think I could, Frank. Selby must feel he's not getting a square deal,
  and he might be glad to call it off. He's too nice to suggest it himself, but
  if I suggested it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're not going to suggest it. For heaven's sake, my dear, be
  reasonable. If Selby had the least suspicion he'd&mdash;well, it would make
  things deuced awkward for me, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Any more awkward than for me?" she countered. "Or for Selby? I'm not
  suggesting it would be comfortable for any of us, but if I'm prepared to face
  it out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not prepared to let you," he cut in. "Hang it, Vita, that would put
  paid to everything. The first thing Selby would do would be to call the whole
  deal off."</p>

  <p>"Deal?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"The Tamagari property. I've been trying to get Selby to lease the land to
  me, and he seems inclined to do it. He has written to his lawyer in Canada
  about it, anyway, and I'm hoping to pull it off. I thought you
  knew&mdash;didn't Selby tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did mention it."</p>

  <p>"He's going to do it, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so."</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"Well, it'll be a pretty big thing for me, Nita, if it does come
  off&mdash;put me right on my feet. But if Selby had the least suspicion that
  there was anything between you and me, the deal would be as dead as
  doornails. Until the lease is signed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, Frank; I understand. Until the lease is signed I'm to let him
  go on thinking that you're the perfect little gentleman he believes you to
  be. Sorry if that hurts, but we may as well face facts. I'm not blaming you
  any more than I blame myself, but don't let's deceive ourselves. However we
  might justify it to ourselves, we should be playing a shabby sort of trick on
  Selby. We're doing so in even discussing it."</p>

  <p>"If that's how you feel about it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do," she said. "But I don't say it isn't worth it. I don't know. All I
  know is that sometimes I've wanted terribly to do it, and it's quite possible
  that one day I shall do it. But if it means so much to you, I won't be
  indiscreet until the lease is signed. I mean, if we're going to rob Selby of
  his wife, a bit of land in Canada won't make any odds one way or the other,
  and we may as well do the job thoroughly."</p>

  <p>"You've a rotten way of putting things, Nita."</p>

  <p>She shrugged.</p>

  <p>"If you can't be good, be honest," she smiled. "What are you going to do
  with a bit of land in Canada, Frank?"</p>

  <p>"Farm it, probably&mdash;if I can get it. Incidentally, you might put a
  word in for me if you get the chance. Selby takes notice of what you say, and
  if you tell him you want him to lease the land to me, that'll probably help
  matters."</p>

  <p>"I've already done what I can," she told him. "There's Selby on the
  terrace. Go and talk to him, please, Frank; I don't want him here just now."
  O'Ryan rose, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Afraid of a bullet?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Afraid to look him in the eyes," she said.</p>

  <p>For some time after O'Ryan and her husband had gone into the library, Nita
  remained, with puckered forehead, in her deck chair. Frank would soon have to
  be answered definitely, and what answer was she to give him: Yes, and cheat
  Selby, or No, and cheat both Frank and herself?</p>

  <p>It struck her that thousands of others had been faced with the same
  question since the world began, and that after all that time some
  satisfactory answer should have been found to it. It was not reasonable that
  after so much experience and experiment she should still have to decide the
  question for herself. Was it really more honest, since she did not love
  Selby, to leave him, or was that merely a convenient bit of sophistry to
  justify her own inclinations? Would she eventually be able to avoid leaving
  him? She did not know. She had been so near to doing it more than
  once....</p>

  <p>It was Lane, the butler, who interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"A Mr. Denham to see you, madam," he announced. "To look over the house, I
  understood."</p>

  <p>Nita rose from her chair.</p>

  <p>"I'll be with him in a moment, Lane," she said, and again she glanced
  anxiously towards the library windows.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">MIXING a whisky-and-soda in the library, O'Ryan wondered if
  he might not be imagining things. Clive, when he had greeted him on the
  terrace, had struck him as in some way different from the calm,
  self-possessed Clive to whom he was accustomed. He was frowning and seemed
  preoccupied, and his "Ah, come in, O'Ryan; I want to have a chat with you"
  was unusually curt.</p>

  <p>Probably, O'Ryan decided, he was letting his imagination run away with
  him. All that talk, of Nita's ... rot, of course. Selby could not possibly
  have the least suspicion. There was nothing to suspect&mdash;so far, and
  Selby had never raised the least objection to his being with Nita. He had
  always rather encouraged it, asking him to take her out in the car or play
  tennis with her while he was busy in his study. All the same, he did seem a
  bit queer this morning, and it would be devilish awkward if he got any ideas
  into his head just now....</p>

  <p>He glanced across at the older man, seated at his writing desk, and met
  the gaze of a keen pair of eyes staring at him with disconcerting fixity.
  O'Ryan forced a smile and raised his glass.</p>

  <p>"Cheerio, Selby!"</p>

  <p>Selby nodded, but continued to stare. Then:</p>

  <p>"You've known Nita a long time, O'Ryan, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>The glass rattled noisily onto the table. "Good Lord, yes&mdash;pretty
  well since she was so high, Selby. Why?"</p>

  <p>"She's fond of you, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"We've always been good pals, if that's what you mean. Get on well
  together, you know, and that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Clive absently.</p>

  <p>He shifted his gaze from O'Ryan's face and sat for some moments staring
  into the garden, his fingers drumming on the desk. O'Ryan watched him with
  uneasy eyes. What was old Selby getting at? You could never tell from his
  face what he was thinking. Awkward fellow he must be at a poker table. If he
  had heard every word that had passed between them in the garden his face
  would reveal nothing&mdash;just as it was revealing nothing now. Of course,
  he hadn't heard, but it didn't follow that he had no suspicion as to what
  they had discussed. Selby didn't miss much, and if Nita had let slip a
  hint...</p>

  <p>"Any special reason for asking?"</p>

  <p>Clive smiled.</p>

  <p>"Only a man's natural desire to see his wife happy, O'Ryan. I'm afraid
  Nita finds things a bit dull sometimes, and I just wanted to tell you that
  whenever you can come down and run around with her a bit you'll be more than
  welcome."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan glanced at him quickly, but Clive's face was as inscrutable as
  ever.</p>

  <p>"And now about this Tamagari business," added Clive. "Nita has been
  telling me I'm to lease you the property, and I'd be glad to do anything I
  can for a friend of hers. Besides, I like you, O'Ryan, and I'd like to do it
  for you if it can be managed."</p>

  <p>"Any hitch?" asked O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly a hitch, but just at the moment I can't give you a definite
  promise. All my Canadian business is in the hands of my lawyer out there.
  Muller's his name&mdash;half the lawyers in Canada seem to be called
  Muller&mdash;and until I hear from him I don't know whether I'm free to lease
  you the property or not. Muller has my power of attorney and deals with
  everything as he thinks fit, and for all I know he may already have leased
  the Tamagari land to someone else."</p>

  <p>"Is that likely?"</p>

  <p>"I don't imagine so," Clive told him, "but it's as well to be sure before
  making any promise. I wrote Muller about it as soon as you mentioned it, and
  I've just had a cable saying he'll be in England towards the end of next
  week, so I shall know for certain then. If you care to run down the following
  week, Muller can draw up the lease if everything is all right, and we'll fix
  it up straight away. Thinking of farming it, are you?"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan nodded.</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why you shouldn't do well with it," Clive continued.
  "It'll need capital, of course, but if you've a few thousand to play
  with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came a tap at the door and Nita, followed by a short, plump,
  prosperous-looking little man, came in.</p>

  <p>"May I come in, Selby?" she asked. "Sorry to interrupt, but this is Mr.
  Denham. This is my husband, Mr. Denham."</p>

  <p>Mr. Denham smiled.</p>

  <p>"Charming house, Mr. Clive," he said. "Old-fashioned, of course, but in
  excellent repair and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This is the library, Mr. Denham," interrupted Nita. "It's all genuine old
  oak panelling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Charming," said Mr. Denham. "And the panelling is of no consequence. A
  few coats of paint would soon brighten that up. I'm all for brightness, Mrs.
  Clive. There'd be room here to build on a billiard room, I should say. A fine
  game, billiards. I always say no house is complete without a billiard room,
  but there'd be room here if I did away with the greenhouse... ."</p>

  <p>As Mr. Denham rattled on, though Selby's face betrayed no surprise, his
  glance sought Nita's eyes questioningly but failed to find them.</p>

  <p>"Library, eh?" the little man was saying. "Well, I'm not much of a reader
  myself. Never found a book that could tell me anything I didn't know already.
  But the wife has always said we ought to have a library. Gives tone to a
  house, she says, and what she says goes. I daresay the house furnishers will
  fit us up with a nice handsome set of books. Well, I like your house, Mr.
  Clive, and if you don't make the price too stiff I'm
  prepared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Price?"</p>

  <p>It was Clive's voice, like the crack of a whip. Nita turned and faced
  him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Denham has been sent by Truman's, Selby," she said. "He's thinking of
  buying the house."</p>

  <p>"Ready to talk business, anyway," said Mr. Denham. "Brass tacks and no
  haggling, eh? That's my way. Name your figure and I'll take it or leave it. I
  understand I can have possession within a month of completion, but if you can
  let the workmen in sooner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The house is not for sale," said Selby in a voice that seemed to have a
  ring of steel in it.</p>

  <p>"Eh? What's that? Truman's told me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You were misinformed, Mr. Denham."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear sir, your wife distinctly gave me to
  understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The house happens to belong to me, Mr. Denham, and not to my wife, and
  I'm telling you that it is not for sale."</p>

  <p>"Selby&mdash;&mdash;" began Nita, but he waved her to silence.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you should have wasted your time, Mr. Denham," he said, "but
  there has evidently been some misunderstanding."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" exclaimed Mr. Denham in evident confusion. "I shall tell
  Truman's exactly what I think of them. Most embarrassing! No ill-feeling, I
  hope, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Clive. Not my fault, you know. Wouldn't have butted
  in for worlds. I always say that an Englishman's home is his
  castle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nita opened the door, and Mr. Denham, still apologizing, followed her from
  the room.</p>

  <p>In a few moments she returned, closed the door behind her, and stood, with
  flaming cheeks and defiant eyes, her back against it.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind, Frank?" she said, with a nod towards the garden. "I want to
  talk to Selby."</p>

  <p>As O'Ryan went out through the French windows, she strode quickly forward
  and paused in front of Clive's desk.</p>

  <p>"Well, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"Selby&mdash;how dare you!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't that rather a question for me to ask?"</p>

  <p>"In front of Frank&mdash;with Mr. Denham here&mdash;to insult and cheapen
  and humiliate me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I had no intention of doing that."</p>

  <p>"'The house is not for sale!'&mdash;when I'd just been showing him round
  the place! You might as well have hit me in the face, Selby: it would have
  been just as dignified, just as considerate, just as much the action of a
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"If you were insulted and cheapened and humiliated, Nita," said her
  husband calmly, "you must admit that you have only yourself to blame. You
  knew that I had no intention whatever of selling the house, but because you
  wished to get rid of it you seem to have gone behind my back and placed it in
  the estate agents' hands, hoping, I suppose, that when a prospective
  purchaser turned up I might give way to you and sell. It was an attempt to
  force my hand, but you should have known better than that. You should have
  known me better. Why you should be so anxious to sell the house, I can't
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Because I hate it!" exclaimed Nita. "I've always hated it. Oh, for
  heaven's sake, Selby, don't remind me that it was I who persuaded you to buy
  it. I know I did. But I didn't imagine that buying Sunningbourne Lodge would
  mean living here year in and year out with nothing to do but&mdash;but to
  watch the antirrhinums grow. I imagined you'd have a place in town as well,
  and that for some part of the year we'd be living like civilized beings. But
  I just have to mug along here, going to bed at ten o'clock because I'm too
  hopelessly bored to sit up any more, with nothing to do after breakfast but
  wait for lunch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And because of that, Nita," interrupted Clive, "you considered yourself
  justified in going behind my back and trying to force me into doing as you
  wanted."</p>

  <p>"That isn't the point now, Selby. The point is that you refuse to do as I
  want. You've refused a dozen times, either because you didn't care how I felt
  about it or didn't understand that I was getting to the point where I could
  stand no more of it. But you do understand now. I shouldn't have gone to
  Truman's if I hadn't been feeling desperate. I shouldn't have been crazy
  enough to imagine I could force you to do anything you didn't want to do. And
  now that you do know how I feel, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose, Nita," he said, "my answer to that is 'nothing'?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged.</p>

  <p>"In that case, you must take the consequences." Clive's mouth
  hardened.</p>

  <p>"In all my life," he said, "I've never yet allowed myself to be threatened
  or bullied into doing anything. It has always been a matter of principle with
  me. However inclined I might be to do a thing or to refrain from doing it, I
  have always felt that to surrender to a threat is a sign of weakness far more
  contemptible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, Selby," she interrupted impatiently, "don't be so
  <i>old!"</i></p>

  <p>It was cheap. She knew it was cheap. She saw Clive wince as if she had
  struck him, and despised herself. The words "I'm sorry, Selby" trembled on
  her lips, but she could not bring herself to utter them.</p>

  <p>He smiled rather wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Nita," he said quietly, "we'll put it down to the obstinacy of
  old age. I'm too old to be able to do without principles."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you refuse to sell?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. Nita turned abruptly and strode from the room.</p>

  <p>For the rest of the afternoon she saw neither Selby nor O'Ryan. She
  remained in her bedroom, curled up in the corner of the couch, thinking. She
  felt mean and contemptible; and her outburst, after all, had only made
  matters worse. Selby would certainly not sell the house now, and she had only
  anchored herself more firmly than ever to the sort of existence from which
  she had been trying to escape. She should have known her husband well enough
  to realize that with him tactics of that kind were bound to fail.</p>

  <p>But she knew so little of Selby. When she came to consider it, she was
  surprised to discover how meagre was her knowledge of him. When first she had
  met him, she had known what everyone knew of him&mdash;that he was wealthy,
  that he had lived most of his life abroad, that he was highly thought of as a
  man of business, and that, having made more than enough money, he proposed to
  settle down in England; and since then she had added practically nothing to
  her stock of knowledge about him.</p>

  <p>Of his past life he had never spoken, and she had never questioned him.
  Looking back, she realized that she had taken him very much for granted. He
  had asked her to marry him, and because it had all seemed eminently
  convenient and satisfactory, she had married him. She had liked him and
  admired him, and she had not paused to consider if admiration and liking were
  a sufficiently solid foundation on which to build her happiness. Often in the
  early days of her marriage she had asked herself if she loved him, and the
  very fact of her asking gave her an uneasy feeling that her feelings towards
  Selby must be something less intense than love. If she were in love with him,
  then love was not the burning flame she had imagined it to be.</p>

  <p>But she had striven hard to fan her feelings into a blaze, and it was not
  her fault that the blaze was not forthcoming, and that what little warmth
  there was had gradually faded away so that fanning was only wasted
  effort.</p>

  <p>She knew now that Selby drew nothing from her but friendliness and
  respect. Entering the room, he had never caused her to feel that acute little
  stab of pleasure which marked the entrance of Frank O'Ryan; a touch of
  Selby's hand never brought that quickening of her pulse which she felt at
  contact with Frank's. She had never ached to run her fingers through Selby's
  hair. Frank had been right when he had said that he would be taking nothing
  from Selby. All that she gave her husband now she would always give
  him&mdash;admiration, respect, friendship, a recognition of his worth. Even
  now, when she felt that he had humiliated her and treated her unfairly, the
  respect remained. She would have thought less of him if he had surrendered to
  her threats and allowed her to force his hand against his judgment.</p>

  <p>But there was so much that she could give to Frank that she had never
  given to Selby and never could give to him, so much that Frank could give to
  her that Selby could never give. And the thought that it was only Selby who
  stood between her and this fullness of happiness increased her bitterness
  against him a hundredfold. The more she thought of that scene in the library,
  the more humiliating it became, the more unreasonable Selby's attitude, the
  more callously selfish his refusal.</p>

  <p>The sound of Selby's footsteps in the corridor as he went towards his room
  reminded her that it was almost time for dinner, and she embarked listlessly
  on the process of dressing. But half an hour later she was still sitting,
  clad in her flimsy wrap, at the dressing table, gazing thoughtfully into the
  mirror. A tap on the door aroused her, and in response to her "Come in!" she
  saw in the mirror the door open and Selby, already dressed, step into the
  room. She did not turn her head.</p>

  <p>"Well, Selby?"</p>

  <p>He came slowly across the room and paused beside her, watching her as she
  combed her hair.</p>

  <p>"Nita, my dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She combed more rapidly, leaning forward and gazing intently at her
  reflection.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Nita, it seems such a terrible pity. Can't we do something?"</p>

  <p>"About what?"</p>

  <p>"About everything, my dear," he said. "We're drifting&mdash;further and
  further apart. We've been drifting for a long time. It's difficult to
  explain, but I think you feel it as much as I do. We've lost something that
  we used to have."</p>

  <p>Nita laid down her comb and began to apply her lipstick.</p>

  <p>"Is that my fault?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not saying that, Nita. I've an idea I'm to blame. I've a feeling that
  I'm failing somewhere, but I'm puzzled to know where. It's not easy for a man
  of my age to see things from the point of view of a girl of twenty-five, and
  perhaps that's where the trouble lies. I don't know. All I know is that we've
  drifted apart, and I want to stop the drifting before we lose each other
  entirely. It's worth an effort, Nita, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Do you imagine that I haven't made an effort?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It's not that, my dear. I want to tell you that I'm going to make an
  effort. All this misunderstanding&mdash;I feel there's no need for it. If
  we'd only be frank with each other&mdash;try to keep close to each other, to
  understand and make allowances&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be frank? My dear Selby, when husband and wife start being frank with
  each other, one of them usually gets murdered. Has Lane rung the gong
  yet?"</p>

  <p>She rose from her chair and slipped off her wrap; and as she did so he
  stepped forward, laid a hand on each of her shoulders, and turned her towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"Nita darling," he said, "what I really want to tell you is that I've
  never loved you as much as I love you now."</p>

  <p>And then, as his arm slipped round her and drew her eagerly towards him,
  she suddenly wrenched herself free and stepped quickly back.</p>

  <p>"Selby&mdash;please&mdash;I don't want to be mauled!"</p>

  <p>For a moment he stood motionless, staring at her with pained, puzzled
  eyes; and then he turned and went quickly from the room.</p>

  <p>Dinner that night was an ordeal to Nita. Sir Ralph Whitcombe was
  there&mdash;sixty, a retired K.C., with a talent for prosiness which, if
  merit received its just reward, so his colleagues said, should have swiftly
  raised him to the Bench; and after listening for an hour while Sir Ralph
  discoursed on the intricacies of ecclesiastical law, while Selby sat watching
  her with the eyes of a dog reproaching her for having kicked him, and Frank
  O'Ryan was blatantly bored, she was thankful when the meal was over and she
  could slip out onto the terrace and soothe her frayed nerves in the quietness
  of the garden. And there, a little later, O'Ryan found her.</p>

  <p>"Well, Nita? Is the genuine old oak panelling to have a coat of paint?
  Thank God for the Denhams! He was the one bright spot in a dreary scene."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, Frank, forget it."</p>

  <p>"Is Selby selling the house?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"So Act Four of the farce will now begin, eh, Nita? You'll go on being the
  dutiful little wife who'd rather be bored than bad."</p>

  <div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <p>"You needn't rub it in, Frank. I don't need reminding of what's in front
    of me. I know the whole dreary business from beginning to end. How I'm
    going to stand any more of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
  </div>

  <p>He grasped her arm and turned her towards him. "Listen, Nita," he said.
  "You're not going to stand it any longer. Nor am I. You don't love
  Selby&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank&mdash;please&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I can't
  think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His arms went round her and crushed her to him. "You do know," he
  insisted. "You don't love Selby. You've never loved him. You love me, and
  you're mine, and here and now you're going to tell me that you'll keep me
  waiting no longer. Good God, Nita, how much longer do you want me to wait?
  I'm not going to wait." His lips were crushed against hers, and just for a
  moment she lay in his arms, inert, unresisting. And then she suddenly strove
  to free herself, but he held her fast.</p>

  <p>"Promise me, Nita," he begged. "Darling, promise me now that the next time
  you want to come to me you will pack your bag and come. Just forget all about
  cheating Selby, and remember that if you don't come you'll be cheating me,
  cheating yourself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank, I&mdash;I can't promise," she told him. "Not yet, I mean. I want
  to think. I've made one mistake, and I don't mean to make another. But I will
  think, Frank. I'm going to Scotland tomorrow, and next week&mdash;when I get
  back&mdash;I'll tell you. And if it's Yes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His arms tightened around her and again his lips found hers.</p>

  <p>"It must be Yes, Nita," he whispered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">NITA kept her promise. During her week in Scotland she did
  little else than think. She had believed that, away from Selby, she would be
  able to get things into focus and see them clearly, that she could take a
  calm survey of the situation and come to a deliberate decision on which she
  could rely.</p>

  <p>But she soon discovered that there was no eluding her problem by a railway
  journey, and that correct focus and deliberate decision were no easier in the
  Highlands than at Sunningbourne Lodge. Each time that she remembered that
  scene in the library, her resentment against her husband blazed up a little
  more fiercely; each time that she tried to envisage the future with him it
  seemed less possible for her to face it. Yet she could not bring herself to a
  firm resolution not to face it.</p>

  <p>Each time that she turned away from it and took a step in the opposite
  direction, something seemed to give her a sudden tug which made her falter
  and glance back. Selby had been amazingly kind to her, and this was poor
  repayment for all his kindness. Selby meant security, and it was, perhaps,
  foolish to throw aside security for the sake of a glamour and excitement
  which might prove impermanent. Her thoughts would linger over that moment
  when she had lain in Frank's arms and felt the touch of his lips, and then
  there would flash into her mind the picture of Selby standing by her dressing
  table, with that hurt, puzzled look in his eyes, searching for something he
  had lost, terribly afraid of drifting away from her, begging her to grasp his
  hand and keep the gap from widening.</p>

  <p>And she had refused her hand and left him to flounder alone. She had
  despised herself for that. She wondered whether, if she deliberately pushed
  him under the water, she would ever cease to despise herself. There was so
  much that she admired about Selby, so many qualities which only just fell
  short of making her love him, a strength and bigness which made her feel
  pitifully small. There were moments when, because of those qualities, she
  felt that she hated him.</p>

  <p>She had written to Selby that she would be returning on the Tuesday and
  expected to arrive in time for dinner; and as she got into the train she had
  still come to no decision as to what her answer to O'Ryan was to be. Because
  she knew that he would expect her answer and that she could not avoid giving
  it, she had not written to Frank. He would have met her at the station, and
  she was not ready to meet him. Somehow, before his next visit to
  Sunningbourne Lodge, she would come to a decision and be able to answer him,
  but she must have those few extra days in which to think.</p>

  <p>And then she suddenly saw quite clearly what she must do. She was tired,
  drowsy, sick to death of thinking, and of asking herself questions to which
  there were no answers. She would think no more about it until she was home
  again. She settled herself comfortably in her corner and closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>It was an hour later that she awoke, realized her surroundings, and again
  closed her eyes, thankful to shut out everything but the noise of the train.
  She found herself listening to the rhythmic rattle of the wheels as they
  crossed the joints in the metals&mdash;thud-thud,
  thud-thud&mdash;regular&mdash;unvarying&mdash;dreadfully monotonous; and so
  it would go on until the end of the journey. Just like her life with Selby,
  the life she was going back to&mdash;regular, unvarying,
  monotonous&mdash;thud-thud, thud-thud&mdash;day after day, year after year.
  Every thud of the wheels was rushing her nearer to it, and she couldn't face
  it. Why should she try to face it? She had only to say one word to Frank
  ...</p>

  <p>As the train slowed down at a station she sprang to her feet, let down the
  window, and leaned out, glancing anxiously along the platform. Yes, there it
  was&mdash;TELEGRAPH OFFICE. But when the train stopped the compartment would
  be a long way off, and she might not have time&mdash;oh, why in heaven's name
  didn't they put on the brakes!</p>

  <p>Before the train had come to a standstill she opened the door, stepped
  out, turned, and hurried back along the platform; and a few moments later she
  had written out her telegram to Frank. "Laffan Hotel To-night, Nita," it
  said. She thrust it across the counter, threw down a shilling, saw the clerk
  nod, and sped back to her compartment.</p>

  <p>And as the train moved off she smiled. After all, it was perfectly simple.
  She wondered why she had worried so terribly about it when all that was
  needed was a shilling telegram. Happiness&mdash;for a shilling!</p>

  <p>Nita had stayed at the Laffan Hotel before. On the rare occasions when
  Selby had been cajoled into spending in town a night which he might have
  spent at Sunningbourne Lodge, he had taken her to the Laffan, preferring it,
  he said, to any other hotel because most of the rooms communicated and it was
  always possible to secure a suite to themselves. She had chosen it because it
  was the first name that occurred to her; but as she went in through the
  revolving door she caught herself wishing that she had chosen some other
  hotel than the Laffan. Here, where she had never before been without Selby,
  the treachery, she felt, would seem worse.</p>

  <p>In the foyer she paused, wondering whether she would not go elsewhere. She
  was surprised somehow to find herself there at all. Just for a few moments
  she had the queerest sensation that she was not there, that it was all
  unreal, that either this wasn't the Laffan Hotel or that she was not Nita
  Clive. The whole affair seemed too fantastic to be actual. She had not really
  sent a telegram to Frank; she was not really expecting him here; she had not
  really finished with her life with Selby. That sort of thing did not really
  happen.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, Mrs. Clive!"</p>

  <p>It was the manager, smiling at her as she passed, and she nodded and
  smiled back at him. It had not occurred to her that anyone at the Laffan
  might remember her, and the realization that the manager had recognized her
  brought her swiftly back to reality.</p>

  <p>She crossed to a settee, sat down and lighted a cigarette, conscious again
  of that acute thrill of excitement which she had felt as she had written the
  telegram to O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>The manager had startled her, but there was nothing, she told herself, to
  be startled at. It was really of no importance that he had recognized her.
  There was no need to conceal anything. Selby would know everything within a
  few hours. She would write to him tonight, and he would have her letter in
  the morning. It would be a difficult letter to write, but she would manage it
  somehow. There was no need to be unpleasant about it. People arranged this
  sort of thing nowadays in quite a friendly way, and leaving a husband was no
  longer the dreadful disgrace it used to be... .</p>

  <p>"Nita!"</p>

  <p>She glanced up quickly, her eyes suddenly bright; as she saw O'Ryan
  standing beside her, she rose from the settee.</p>

  <p>"Nita darling&mdash;bless you for this!"</p>

  <p>She laid a hand on his arm and squeezed it, smiling at him.</p>

  <p>"You got my wire?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>Nita hesitated, uncertain whether to ask him to get a taxi and take her to
  some other hotel. She did not want to hurt him, and she felt that to tell him
  the truth could not fail to hurt him. She did not want him to think that now,
  during their first few moments together, she had a thought for anyone but
  him. To tell him now that because she had been to the Laffan with Selby
  ...</p>

  <p>"Rooms twenty-three and four, Nita," he said. "I've seen to the booking,
  and I've reserved a table for dinner. This place is crowded out."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I won't be long, Frank," she said; "not more than ten minutes."</p>

  <p>Frank smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait for you here, Nita. What's ten minutes&mdash; after three
  years?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Music; the soft murmur of voices; the sparkle of glass and silver;
  flowers; and Frank smiling at her across the table. Once again Nita had that
  sensation that it could not possibly be real. She had never felt like this
  before&mdash;this quivering sensitiveness to everything about her, this acute
  awareness that every atom of her was intensely alive. Everything around her
  seemed to have taken on a strange new beauty. She noticed the splash of warm
  red on her hand cast by the crimson shade of the table lamp, the graceful
  sweep of the violinist's arm, the tiny bubbles dancing in her wine, the
  little lines round Frank's eyes where smiles had worn a pathway. There was
  nothing new about it all; it had always been there. But tonight, because of
  the newness in herself, she saw it.</p>

  <p>She said very little. She did not want to talk; she wanted to sit quietly
  there and feel it all, opening herself to this new beauty and letting it pour
  in upon her senses. "Cigarette, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Frank."</p>

  <p>Again she lapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>"Not worrying, darling, are you?"</p>

  <p>She glanced at him, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Worrying&mdash;now?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"About Selby, I mean."</p>

  <p>A frown ruffled her forehead and disappeared. She shook her head,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to worry about," he assured her. "Selby's not a
  suspicious sort, fortunately. He gave me a bit of a start last week when he
  began asking me if I was fond of you, but I needn't have been alarmed. He
  wants me to see you as often as possible and cheer things up a bit. It was a
  bad moment, though. I thought the lease had gone west for good."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;the lease. I'm afraid I'd forgotten the lease, Frank. Does
  it matter tremendously?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it does."</p>

  <p>"But you can hardly hope for it now, Frank."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why not," said O'Ryan. "I'm taking a risk tonight, of course,
  but it's not a big one. Selby is never likely to discover anything."</p>

  <p>"But, Frank, how&mdash;how can he help discovering?" Her eyes were vaguely
  troubled.</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why he should ever find out," said O'Ryan. "Of course,
  we shall have to cut out this sort of thing. Places like the Laffan are too
  dangerous. Somebody sees you and tells somebody else, and before you know
  where you are everybody knows all about it. But we can talk about that later.
  I've an idea I might take a small flat somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Frank!"</p>

  <p>She was staring at him with puzzled, incredulous eyes. "Good Lord, Nita!
  What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. What was wrong? Only that the newly found
  beauty had disappeared, that she could feel it no longer, that her senses
  were suddenly numbed, dead, incapable of responding to anything. She pressed
  out her cigarette and rose.</p>

  <p>"I say, Nita," said O'Ryan, with a puzzled frown, "I'm sorry if I've said
  anything to upset you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all right; it's&mdash;nothing. I didn't understand, that's all.
  We won't start arguing about it here. I think I'll&mdash;go up to my
  room."</p>

  <p>She turned and went swiftly from the restaurant, up the stairs, without
  waiting for the lift, and into her room. And there she flung herself on the
  bed and buried her face in the pillow.</p>

  <p>For some time she lay motionless, hiding her face, feeling that to show it
  to the empty room needed more courage than she possessed. Then, with an
  effort, she forced herself to sit up. She told herself wearily that she must
  start thinking again. Happiness&mdash;for a shilling! She might have known
  that the sort of happiness she could buy for a shilling would be worth no
  more.</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why Selby should ever discover ..."</p>

  <p>"Take a small flat somewhere ..." So that was all Frank had to offer her!
  What a fool she had been not to understand him better! Why hadn't she
  realized? How had he dared&mdash;Frank, who said that he loved her, that she
  belonged to him, that he had a right to her because of his love&mdash;how had
  he dared offer her, instead of love, this shoddy substitute? Didn't he know
  her better than that? To leave Selby, openly, honestly, admitting frankly
  that she did not love him&mdash;yes, she could have done that. Because of her
  love for Frank she had been ready to face that ordeal, imagining that he was
  ready to face it with her. But to play the hypocrite, to spend her life
  tricking and deceiving Selby, taking all he gave her and giving nothing in
  return&mdash;she would rather a thousand times let things continue as they
  were. Compared with Selby's love for her, this which Frank offered was a
  cheap and contemptible fraud. She felt that she hated Frank O'Ryan for having
  insulted her with such an offering.</p>

  <p>And now what? She glanced at her watch. There were no more trains to
  Sunningbourne now, and in any case there was nothing to be gained by
  returning that night. She could explain to Selby in the morning that she had
  changed her mind at the last moment and travelled by the night train. There
  was no need even to mention the Laffan, and it was hardly likely that he
  would ever hear that she had stayed there. In any case, he would never
  suspect her of doing what she had so nearly done.</p>

  <p>After that scene with her in the library she had some idea of what Selby
  would be like if any such suspicion did cross his mind. He would be terribly
  ruthless in his anger. She had probably been right when she had told Frank
  that he would put a bullet into each of them. Still, he had no reason to
  suspect, and she would not see Frank again....</p>

  <p>She glanced round the room. There was a communicating door between her own
  room and the next. She could see no key in it, but just above the handle was
  a small silver bolt. She slipped from the bed, went to the door, and shot the
  small silver bolt across. She sighed as she turned away.</p>

  <p>It was barely eight o'clock the next morning when Nita left her room and
  hurried down to the hotel office. She had spent a sleepless night and would
  have left earlier but for her fear of calling attention to herself.</p>

  <p>During the night a sudden panic had overtaken her, a dreadful feeling of
  certainty that, in some unaccountable way, Selby had come to know exactly
  what had happened, and she had found it hard to resist the temptation to
  dress at once and hurry from the hotel. Every moment she stayed there seemed
  to increase her danger of discovery. She caught herself picturing the scene
  when Selby accused her&mdash;saw him gazing at her with those piercing eyes
  of his, his lips set, his face showing no sign of what he was feeling. She
  heard his voice&mdash;cold, calm, terribly hard&mdash;she saw herself,
  white-lipped, protesting her innocence, begging him to believe her.</p>

  <p>Nerves, she decided. She would leave at eight o'clock.</p>

  <p>There would be no risk of seeing Frank. He would never dream that she
  would breakfast before nine.</p>

  <p>She had no breakfast. Paying her bill, she hurried out into the taxi which
  the porter had called for her, sinking back in the corner with a sigh of
  relief. Once out of the hotel, her panic left her. It was all over now, and
  there was nothing more to worry about.</p>

  <p>And then, just as the taxi started, she leaned forward, tapped on the
  window, signalled to the driver to stop, and got out.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," she smiled. "I've left my bag behind. I shan't be a minute."</p>

  <p>She hurried back into the hotel and crossed the foyer. Her bag lay on the
  office counter, and with a smile at the clerk she picked it up and was
  turning to go when he called after her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mrs. Clive!"</p>

  <p>She paused.</p>

  <p>"There's just been a telephone call for you. You'd hardly gone out
  when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Telephone?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"A call from&mdash;er&mdash;" he consulted a slip of
  paper&mdash;"Sunningbourne Lodge, I believe was the name. Mr. Clive wished to
  know if you were in the hotel."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what did you say?"</p>

  <p>"As it was Mr. Clive inquiring," said the clerk, "I gave the information.
  I said you had stayed here last night and had left a few minutes ago."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">NITA stood motionless for some moments. She felt weak, limp,
  as if all the strength had suddenly drained away from her limbs and left her
  with a terrible lassitude against which it was hopeless to fight. There was a
  throbbing in her throat which made each breath a painful effort, and before
  her eyes there seemed to be a pulsating film which made everything blurred
  and distorted.</p>

  <p>"I hope I did right, Mrs. Clive?"</p>

  <p>She forced herself to smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;quite right, thanks. There was no&mdash;no message?"</p>

  <p>"No message at all, Mrs. Clive."</p>

  <p>She nodded and stood nervously drumming on the counter with her fingers.
  Why had Selby telephoned? She had not told him that she would be at the
  Laffan; she had not known herself that she would be there until she had sent
  that wire to Frank when she was already halfway to London. Until that
  telegram had been sent there had been nothing for Selby to suspect; but if he
  suspected nothing, why had he telephoned? If only she had waited a few
  minutes longer before leaving the hotel! She would have known then. She could
  have spoken to Selby on the telephone&mdash;heard his voice. She could have
  told in an instant if there were anything amiss. If only she knew exactly
  what he had said and exactly how he had said it, she would have had some
  inkling of what she would have to face when she got back to Sunningbourne.
  But she could scarcely question the clerk about it.</p>

  <p>"If you'd care to ring through to Sunningbourne, Mrs. Clive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;I won't trouble, thanks," said Nita. "It can't be anything
  of importance. If there are any other inquiries for me, say that I'm on my
  way home, will you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She hurried out to the waiting taxi, told the driver to take her to
  Waterloo, and got in. There was a train at eight thirty-five: she had looked
  it up at the Laffan before leaving. She was desperately anxious to catch it;
  she felt an urgent need to get home as quickly as possible and discover if
  there was everything to fear or nothing. She would know as soon as she met
  Selby: his manner, his voice, the look on his face would tell her infallibly
  what she wanted to know. And if she found that he knew everything, how was
  she to persuade him that he was putting a wrong construction on a perfectly
  innocent incident? It was never easy to persuade Selby of anything. Once he
  got his teeth into an idea, there was no prizing them apart, and if you still
  tried to take it from him when he had given his growl of warning, you were
  certain to get bitten. He had snapped at her dangerously when she had tried
  to make him give up Sunningbourne Lodge, and though he had come to her
  afterwards cringing for forgiveness, pitifully anxious to be received back
  into favour, she knew that if she attempted any further interference he would
  snap just as savagely again.</p>

  <p>She tried to review the situation calmly, to see it as Selby would see it.
  There was no cause, at any rate, to be nervous about the telegram which she
  had sent to Frank. Only she and Frank knew of its existence, and without that
  damning bit of evidence at his disposal Selby could not prove that her
  meeting Frank at the Laffan that night had not been purely fortuitous. Even
  Selby must realize that to suspect that there was something amiss for no
  better reason than that she and Frank had both stayed at the Laffan Hotel
  would be absurd. There was nothing remarkable in the coincidence of two
  friends happening to stay at the same hotel; it must happen every day in
  London. Ridiculous to play the jealous husband for no better reason than
  that. And then it struck her that, just because it was so obviously
  ridiculous, Selby would certainly not do it. Selby was nothing if not
  reasonable, sensible, exasperatingly logical. If he suspected her, he had
  some more definite grounds for his suspicion than that.</p>

  <p>She forced herself to sum up the evidence which he might conceivably have
  against her. She had told him that she would be home last night, but instead
  of going home she had stayed at the Laffan and had not telephoned, as she
  easily might have done, to tell him so. She saw now that if she had
  telephoned to Selby last night and told him where she was, his suspicions
  would never have been aroused. But last night she had been sure that the
  break with Selby was an accomplished fact, and she had intended writing to
  him in the morning. Actually, of course, her failure to telephone was in her
  favour, because, if she had been indulging in the sort of escapade which
  Selby suspected, she would certainly have been clever enough to telephone to
  Selby and disarm all suspicion by telling him that she was too tired after
  her journey from Scotland to go on to Sunningbourne and was spending the
  night at the Laffan. But that, she felt, would be too subtle an argument for
  Selby to appreciate, too artistic a deception to pass muster with his direct,
  logical mind.</p>

  <p>And if she failed to convince him on that point, the case looked black
  against her: she had stayed at the Laffan without telling her husband; she
  had met Frank O'Ryan there; they had had dinner together; her room had been
  booked by Frank and their table reserved; and, with those facts against her,
  what would be the use of expecting Selby to believe her when she told him of
  the little silver bolt? If only she knew how much of all this was within his
  knowledge! She had sat in the foyer&mdash;foolishly, she realized
  now&mdash;waiting for Frank to come, and if anyone had seen her, as the
  manager had, it must have been obvious that she was keeping an appointment.
  It was difficult to see how the information that she was at the Laffan could
  have travelled so quickly to Sunningbourne, but that was just the unexpected
  sort of thing that did happen&mdash;the one chance in a thousand that came
  off and brought about disaster.</p>

  <p>At Waterloo she bought her ticket, glanced at the clock, found that she
  still had several minutes in hand, and went towards the platform. And then,
  after a few steps, she suddenly paused. She could not go yet. In an hour, if
  she caught this train, she would have to face Selby, meet his eyes, hear him
  asking her this and that in his quiet, persistent way, and she had no idea
  what answers she was going to make to his questions. It was absurd to go
  rushing back to Sunningbourne like this before she had given herself a chance
  to think things out. If she was to convince Selby of her innocence, she must
  not arrive home like a panic-stricken schoolgirl with a guilty look and a
  pack of feeble lies which would only land her in further difficulties. And of
  course she would have to lie. If she told the truth, made a clean breast of
  everything from the moment when she had sent the telegram, he would not
  believe her. It was a pretty thin story, and no husband could be blamed for
  not accepting it. Innocent as she was, she would have to lie to convince him
  of her innocence, and she must not meet Selby until she had a ready answer to
  any question he might put to her, a plausible "because" to counter every
  searching "why."</p>

  <p>She went from the station, walked over Waterloo Bridge, and in the Strand,
  catching sight of a notice outside a tea shop which said, "Open for
  breakfasts from 8 a.m.," she remembered that she had had no breakfast, went
  in and ordered a meal. And there, while cleaners swabbed the floor round her
  feet, and waitresses clattered cutlery as they laid the tables in readiness
  for the midday lunchers, she drank her coffee and ate her egg and bacon and
  smoked a cigarette and began to feel calmer, to think more clearly, and to
  comfort herself with the thought&mdash;though she had no faith in
  it&mdash;that perhaps, after all, Selby suspected nothing and there was some
  quite simple explanation of his telephone call to the Laffan. She could not
  help sighing, as she left the teashop, at the thought that breakfast this
  morning had not been as she had planned it.</p>

  <p>It was twelve o'clock when she reached Sunningbourne Lodge, and as she
  walked up the drive to the house she was again aware of a throbbing in her
  throat, and her glance anxiously swept the garden for a glimpse of her
  husband. She was immensely relieved that he was not to be seen. She was
  suddenly in a panic again in case he should come round the corner of the
  house and see her, and longed to throw all restraint to the winds and scuttle
  into the house and up to her room while the way was clear for her. But she
  overcame that impulse and forced herself to walk slowly along the drive,
  pausing every now and then to look at the flower beds, as she usually did,
  and nip off a dead bloom.</p>

  <p>Lane was in the hall. He turned sharply as he heard her footstep, and gave
  her a look which, just for an instant, made her hesitate, certain that he was
  well aware of where she had been and what she had been doing. And then she
  went calmly on towards the staircase. Lane, she reflected, always looked at
  you as if he suspected you of having poisoned your mother. How could he
  possibly know anything?</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Lane."</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, madam."</p>

  <p>"Did I startle you?"</p>

  <p>"Just a little, madam," the man admitted. "I didn't hear you coming,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Guilty conscience?" she laughed.</p>

  <p>He gave what passed with him for a smile.</p>

  <p>"I daresay we all have that, madam, if the truth were told," he said.
  "Shall I tell the master you've returned?"</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"In the library, madam. He said he would like to see you immediately you
  arrived."</p>

  <p>"No need to disturb him, Lane," she said. "I shall be down again in a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>Halfway up the stairs she paused.</p>

  <p>"Lane!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam?"</p>

  <p>"Who telephoned to me at the Laffan Hotel this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I did, madam. Mr. Clive instructed me to ring through and inquire if you
  were there. He thought you might be getting here for breakfast. I got through
  for him, but they told me you had just left."</p>

  <p>"And as soon as they told you I had gone, I suppose you rang
  off?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Practically, madam."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Clive didn't speak on the telephone himself?"</p>

  <p>"No, madam."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I just wondered," she said carelessly, turning to go upstairs. "I thought
  he might possibly have left a message for me in case I went back to the
  hotel."</p>

  <p>"No message at all, madam," Lane assured her.</p>

  <p>She went up a few more stairs and paused again. "Mr. Clive is all right,
  Lane, is he?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, madam, I should say."</p>

  <p>"He hasn't been&mdash;worried about anything? I mean, he hasn't seemed to
  be worried?"</p>

  <p>The man glanced at her quickly, obviously a little surprised. His look
  told Nita plainly that he was wondering what she was driving at in asking him
  that question, and she instantly regretted having asked it. Lane was no fool,
  and there was no knowing what confidences were exchanged between a butler and
  his master.</p>

  <p>"Not that I have noticed, madam," said Lane. "He was, I think, a little
  disappointed this morning when I told him that you had left the hotel."</p>

  <p>"As long as he's quite well, Lane&mdash;" she interrupted, and went up to
  her room.</p>

  <p>She stayed there almost an hour, sitting in front of her mirror,
  prolonging the ritual of powder puff and lipstick as long as possible, half
  hoping that Lane had told Selby of her arrival and that she would hear her
  husband's tap on her door. Instinct told her that, if a battle was to be
  fought, she would be far more certain of victory if she fought it on ground
  of her own choosing. Seated at her dressing table she could use her most
  deadly weapons of casualness and indifference with far greater effect than if
  she were compelled to face him across his desk in the library, with Selby
  sitting in his swivel chair, searching her with his eyes, watching every
  change of expression, reading everything which she was most anxious to hide.
  She could be disconcertingly casual when she was busy with an eyebrow pencil,
  and Selby was always a little ill at ease in her bedroom, always rather the
  shy schoolboy who felt embarrassed and awkward at finding himself in such
  strictly feminine surroundings, and terribly conscious of the clumsiness of
  his feet. She knew intuitively that a man has no chance against a woman in
  front of her mirror, and that logic is no match for lipstick.</p>

  <p>But when, at the end of an hour, Selby had not come, she rose and went
  downstairs. Just for a moment, with her hand on the handle of the library
  door, she paused and her teeth pressed hard on her lower lip; then, with a
  shrug, she opened the door and went in.</p>

  <p>Her husband was seated at his desk, writing. He glanced up as she entered
  the room and rose to meet her; but he did not give her his usual welcoming
  smile. She smiled at him, however, scanning his face anxiously for some clue
  to his thoughts. She had been sure that when she saw him she would need no
  more than a glance at his face to warn or to reassure her, but beyond the
  fact that he seemed a shade more solemn than usual, his face told her
  nothing. There was no indication either that he knew or did not know.</p>

  <p>"Back again, Selby," she said. "Better late than never! But I went
  suburban this morning&mdash;shop-gazing in London. Sales, you know." She
  laughed nervously. "I was terribly tempted to buy you a shirt,
  Selby&mdash;flannel, with stripes&mdash;but I spared you."</p>

  <p>There was just the hint of a smile round his lips. "Thank you, Nita," he
  said, seating himself at the desk again. "There are some things which a
  dutiful wife should always spare her husband. Have you had a good time in
  Scotland?"</p>

  <p>She strolled to the open French windows and stood with her' back towards
  him, gazing out into the garden.</p>

  <p>"Much the same as usual," she said, with a shrug: "dreen, drizzle, and
  drench in turn." Again she gave that nervous little laugh. "Frank O'Ryan
  always says that as soon as you go to Scotland you understand why they're
  called mackintoshes."</p>

  <p>She gave him that chance deliberately; it seemed a long time before he
  answered her.</p>

  <p>"It has been rather dull here, Nita, while you have been away."</p>

  <p>She frowned. Had he purposely ignored the bait, or hadn't he noticed it?
  If he had anything to say to her concerning Frank O'Ryan he would hardly have
  missed that opportunity. And if he had not noticed it, then surely that could
  only mean that he had nothing to say to her about him, that she had been
  letting her imagination run away with her, scaring herself over that
  telephone call when all the time there was some quite simple explanation.</p>

  <p>"So you stayed at the Laffan last night, Nita?"</p>

  <p>She bit her lip, wondering if he was looking at her, and thankful that he
  could not see her face.</p>

  <p>"That ghastly journey, Selby!" she said. "It's hardly worth it&mdash;even
  to get away from Scotland. I was frightfully tired when I got to London, and
  I couldn't have faced another mile in a train. You weren't worried when I
  didn't turn up?"</p>

  <p>"You could hardly expect me not to be anxious, Nita. You wrote that you
  would be home last night. If you had rung through on the
  telephone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I did try to," she interrupted. "They said there was no reply. It was
  rather late&mdash;nearly midnight. Probably everyone in Sunningbourne had
  been asleep for several hours. I was dead beat, Selby, and couldn't keep on
  ringing. I thought you'd understand."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him quickly over her shoulder. He was staring at his
  blotting pad, drawing crazy-looking geometrical figures with his pen.</p>

  <p>"You rang up the Laffan this morning, Selby, didn't you? I went back to
  fetch my bag&mdash;I'd left it in the office&mdash;and they told me. Anything
  special?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to know if you were there, Nita, that was all. I wondered
  whether you would be coming back&mdash;for breakfast."</p>

  <p>She frowned. It was useless going on like this. All this fencing led her
  nowhere. Did Selby know or didn't he? She was no more able to answer that
  question now than she had been in the office of the Laffan this morning. He
  had given her no indication one way or the other. He seemed rather more
  solemn than usual, a little inclined to be stiff and formal with her, but
  that might mean nothing of any importance. She had rattled him badly over
  that business about the house, and while she had been amusing her friends
  with her description of Mr. Denham and his plans for brightening the
  panelling and stocking the library with books, Selby had no doubt been
  nursing his grievance and getting more and more resentful about it every day.
  He was probably still very angry with her about the Mr. Denham episode, and
  that would explain his solemn, formal manner. It did not necessarily mean
  that he had any suspicions about last night.</p>

  <p>Yet she had an uneasy feeling that if the truth about last night&mdash;or
  what any husband would naturally infer to be the truth&mdash;were known, or
  even suspected, by Selby, he would treat her exactly as he was treating her
  now. She remembered what she had said to Frank O'Ryan when they had discussed
  how Selby would deal with such a situation. There would be no dramatic scene,
  she had prophesied, no fuss. He would give no hint of his suspicions, say
  nothing to either of them, treat them exactly as he had always treated
  them&mdash;until the right moment came. And then he would quite certainly put
  a bullet through each of them. Was that what he was doing now&mdash;waiting
  his time, keeping his knowledge to himself, deliberately giving them rope,
  trying to treat her naturally and not quite succeeding? She must know for
  certain. She could never stand the cat-and-mouse business. If Selby knew, she
  would rather face it now and get it over.</p>

  <p>She turned from the window and strolled across towards his desk.</p>

  <p>"How did you know I was at the Laffan last night, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed."</p>

  <p>She forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't that rather clever of you? I had no idea myself until I got to
  London that I wasn't coming straight on here. It was quite a sudden
  impulse."</p>

  <p>He smiled faintly, his gaze still fixed on his blotting pad.</p>

  <p>"When you know people very well, Nita," he said, "it's usually not very
  difficult to guess what their sudden impulses will be. When you didn't arrive
  home last night, I telephoned through to Scotland. They told me you had left,
  and I guessed at once that you had suddenly decided to spend the night at
  some hotel in town. The Laffan seemed the most likely. But it was late before
  I got my call through to Scotland&mdash;nearly midnight."</p>

  <p>"Just when I was trying to get through to you," said Nita. "I believe they
  did say the line was engaged. But if you'd rung the Laffan last night, Selby,
  instead of waiting until this morning&mdash;why on earth didn't
  your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the circumstances, Nita, I thought you might not welcome the inquiries
  of an anxious husband at midnight."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him quickly, but there was nothing to be read from his
  face.</p>

  <p>"In the circumstances, Selby? I don't think I understand. There were no
  very special circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I thought that after a long journey from Scotland, my dear, you would
  have gone to bed early and would not wish to be disturbed."</p>

  <p>Nita decided that she had better leave it at that. If Selby knew,
  obviously he did not intend to tell her; if he did not know, there was
  nothing to worry about; and if he merely suspected, nagging at the subject
  would only further arouse his suspicions. Until she had some grounds for
  believing otherwise, the best thing was to assume that he knew nothing.</p>

  <p>She stood beside him and laid a hand on his shoulder. "It's nice to be
  back, anyway, Selby," she said. "Busy?"</p>

  <p>"I'm expecting Muller down today," he said, with a wave of his hand
  towards the papers that littered his desk. "I want him to stay a few days, if
  he can manage it. You'll like Muller when you know him better." She wrinkled
  her forehead.</p>

  <p>"Do I know him at all?"</p>

  <p>"You met him once&mdash;only for a few minutes&mdash;when he was over here
  on one of his trips, two years ago." She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to remember him, Selby."</p>

  <p>"He remembers you, Nita. He told me so this morning on the
  telephone&mdash;said he'd recognize you in an instant anywhere. He's rather
  proud of never forgetting a face, and just to prove to me that he hadn't
  forgotten you, he described you to me exactly. He even remembered that little
  mole close to your ear. He got to England several days ago and is staying at
  the Laffan." Nita withdrew her hand sharply from his shoulder. "The&mdash;the
  Laffan?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"He phoned me from there this morning&mdash;just before you got home."</p>

  <p>Nita's fears came rushing back at her. Muller&mdash;Selby's oldest
  friend&mdash;at the Laffan last night&mdash;telephoning to him this
  morning&mdash;remembering the mole on her cheek.... And she had been deluding
  herself into believing that Selby knew nothing! Of course he knew: she had no
  doubt about that now. He knew&mdash;and was doing just what she had said he
  would do: playing with her, giving her rope, leading her on to give herself
  away, waiting until the right moment came, watching her. And she was standing
  there and saying nothing and showing him as plainly as possible that it was
  all true....</p>

  <p>She made an effort to speak naturally.</p>

  <p>"Did he say&mdash;on the telephone&mdash;when he'd be arriving? I suppose
  that's what he phoned for, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Among other things," said her husband. "He'll be here soon after lunch.
  But that wasn't his real object in telephoning. He pretended it was, but I
  know Muller. There was something he wanted to tell me, and he hadn't the
  patience to wait until he got down here." She strolled again towards the
  windows.</p>

  <p>"Something&mdash;important, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Only that, in Muller's opinion, I'm almost every conceivable kind of a
  fool."</p>

  <p>"And one kind in particular?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Muller has got it into his head," he said, "that I don't take nearly
  enough care of what belongs to me. But he's wrong."</p>

  <p>He picked up his pen again and began reading a document on the desk. Nita
  went out into the garden. Then: "Oh, Nita!"</p>

  <p>She paused and glanced back.</p>

  <p>"Young O'Ryan turned up this morning&mdash;about eleven o'clock&mdash;came
  down by car. He's gone off to have lunch with some friends, I believe."</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he's coming back?"</p>

  <p>"Some time this afternoon, he said," Selby told her. "I've invited him to
  stay for a few days. There's a matter I want to settle with him, and it will
  be easier if he's here on the spot."</p>

  <p>Nita nodded, turned, and walked away, frowning thoughtfully. She had an
  uncomfortable feeling that Selby was staring at her back.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">NITA would have been glad to escape the ordeal of lunch with
  her husband, but she did not dare to excuse herself. She must not, she told
  herself, on any account give him reason to suspect that she was avoiding him
  or was ill at ease with him or was being anything hut perfectly natural; but
  the half hour at the luncheon table put a strain on her nerves which was
  almost more than she could bear. Selby seemed anxious to make himself as
  pleasant as possible, and talked to her as he always talked, but she could
  not rid her mind of the thought that he was all the time talking with a
  definite purpose. Behind every remark that he made she suspected some
  ulterior motive; in every seemingly innocent question she feared a trap. She
  hesitated before answering, knew that she had hesitated, and wondered whether
  her husband had noticed her hesitation. She was conscious of being awkward
  and unnatural, of talking in a forced, stilted way, and felt that he could
  hardly fail to detect that she was not at her ease and to draw his own
  conclusions. She found it difficult, too, to keep her attention forced on
  what he was saying. She did not want to talk; she wanted to think. For the
  first time since she had known him she felt that she would have been glad for
  old Sir Ralph Whitcombe to be sitting at the table, prosing away in that
  monotonous manner of his about something which, as far as she could see, was
  not of the least importance to anybody. He would, at any rate, have kept
  Selby occupied and given her a chance to think.</p>

  <p>She had so much to think about if only she could get a chance. There was
  Frank. She had tried to keep all thoughts of Frank from her mind since she
  had shot the small silver bolt last night. She had told herself then that by
  that action she had definitely bolted him out of her life. But she realized
  that Frank would have to be thought about some time. He would be here at
  Sunningbourne this afternoon, and there would have to be some sort of
  settlement between them. He had hurt her atrociously, and the pain at first
  had made her terribly bitter against him. Too bitter, perhaps. A man did not
  see these things from the same point of view as a woman, and he would
  probably be surprised to learn that he had hurt her or done anything
  atrocious. He would think her, she supposed, appallingly old-fashioned and
  squeamish, and perhaps a little unreasonable. Men always expected everyone to
  be reasonable, which only went to show that they could sometimes be very
  unreasonable themselves. Selby, for instance, would refuse to believe her if
  she told him what had actually occurred at the Laffan last night, because he
  would not think it reasonable. She could not help smiling as the thought
  struck her that both Selby and O'Ryan, seeing the affair from their own
  points of view, would agree on the fact that she had not been reasonable.</p>

  <p>The meal seemed interminable, and once or twice she had a vague suspicion
  that Selby was purposely prolonging it; but it was over at last, and she got
  up eagerly, intending to seek sanctuary in the garden. There was coffee,
  however, in the library, and since she had always had a cup of coffee and a
  cigarette in the library after lunch, she did not venture to break the usual
  routine. And before she had finished her cigarette Muller was
  announced&mdash;broad-shouldered, grey-haired, with a pair of piercing blue
  eyes that held a genial twinkle, and a voice that boomed. As he came striding
  into the room, gripped her husband's hand, slapped him on the back, and
  boomed out that he was darned glad to set eyes on the old scoundrel again,
  Nita reflected that to try bluffing Mr. Muller would be a foolhardy sort of
  enterprise, and that if there were trouble of any sort about she would rather
  have him with her than against her. He turned to her and took her hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm happy to meet you again, Mrs. Clive," he said. "I missed you last
  trip. Thought I should miss you this trip, too."</p>

  <p>Nita smiled.</p>

  <p>"But you're not going back yet?"</p>

  <p>"Early next week&mdash;through New York."</p>

  <p>"Not even staying for Ascot?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Horses don't mean a darned thing to me, Mrs. Clive," he said; "and I
  guess I'd feel too conspicuous in a grey topper. Besides, I've a whole lot of
  work to do in town." He stood eyeing her keenly for a moment and then turned
  with a smile to Selby. "It's a poor sort of husband, Selby," he said, "who
  knows less about his wife than his lawyer knows. It's the left cheek, as I
  was willing to bet you. If you ever feel inclined to get rid of your husband,
  Mrs. Clive, just bear in mind that, on the other side of the Atlantic, for a
  husband not to know on which cheek his wife's mole is situated would be
  deemed sufficient grounds for a divorce. Still, I'd stick to old Selby if I
  were you. He's a steady old horse, and you might do a lot worse."</p>

  <p>Selby smiled.</p>

  <p>"You'd have known her, Jerry?"</p>

  <p>"I'd have picked her out of a thousand, man," replied Muller. "I never
  forget a face. I guess I'd have made a first-rate club porter."</p>

  <p>"And is that nearly all about me?" laughed Nita.</p>

  <p>"You must forgive me, Mrs. Clive," said Muller. "I'm forgetting my English
  manners. But your husband was so darned disbelieving when I told him on the
  telephone that I'd know you again anywhere that I had to prove him wrong. So
  you've been to Scotland, Mrs. Clive?"</p>

  <p>Nita nodded.</p>

  <p>"Back this morning&mdash;and glad it's over."</p>

  <p>"The silly girl came back by the day train," explained Selby, "which meant
  she arrived in London dog-tired and had to go to the Laffan for the night.
  And she didn't even trouble to telephone her husband."</p>

  <p>"You're staying at the Laffan, too, aren't you, Mr. Muller?"</p>

  <p>"I always do. The Carlton's a little too central for me. So you were there
  last night, Mrs. Clive?"</p>

  <p>"We usually stay there," Selby explained. "They give us the same suite and
  always make us very comfortable. Funny you two didn't see each other."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it's funny," said Nita. "It's a huge hotel. I've often
  found I was staying there at the same time as people I know, yet wasn't aware
  of it till a long time after. You don't see every guest in a hotel when you
  spend a night there."</p>

  <p>"And he's no way of knowing that I didn't see you&mdash; eh, Mrs. Clive?"
  said Muller.</p>

  <p>"Did you?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"And for all your husband knows," added Muller, "you and I may have had
  dinner together. But it's all right, Selby, I can reassure you on that point.
  Mrs. Clive certainly didn't dine with <i>me</i> last night. No doubt she'd
  choose something younger than me for a dinner partner."</p>

  <p>Nita gave him a quick, searching glance, but gathered nothing from his
  face. Had he seen her or hadn't he? If he hadn't, why all this talk about the
  Laffan? Was it deliberate? Muller and Selby were old friends, and men were
  queer like that; they would always forget their chivalry and side with their
  friend, right or wrong, against a woman. To a man, a woman who disagreed with
  his friend was inevitably in the wrong....</p>

  <p>"Mind you, Selby," added Muller, "from what I know of you, if your wife
  went off and had dinner with some other man, you'd only have yourself to
  blame. There never was a man less capable of looking after what belongs to
  him than you are. If you don't want that sort of thing to happen you
  shouldn't allow her to go gallivanting off to Scotland without you and
  staying at the Laffan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nita cut him short.</p>

  <p>"Have you visited the Tower of London, Mr. Muller?" she inquired, smiling.
  "Or the Zoo, or Westminster Abbey, or Madame Tussaud's, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"None of them. Much too busy. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Only that any one of them is much more interesting to talk about than the
  Laffan Hotel," she laughed. She went towards the French windows. "I expect
  you really want to talk business&mdash;acres and leases and sites
  and&mdash;and plots&mdash;don't you, Mr. Muller? I'll leave you to it. I'm
  going down to the lower garden, if you should want me, Selby."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't, my dear, if I were you," said Selby casually, seating himself
  at his desk.</p>

  <p>She glanced at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"It's very hot, and you're tired already, and if you spend the afternoon
  down there in the sun you'll only suffer for it."</p>

  <p>Nita smiled.</p>

  <p>"Selby has taken to heart what you said, Mr. Muller," she laughed, "and is
  starting to look after what belongs to him."</p>

  <p>Clive shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You must do as you please, my dear," he said, "but if you take my advice
  you'll keep out of the lower garden. You'd be far wiser to go up to your room
  and have a rest. Still, if you prefer to risk a splitting
  headache&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll take the risk, not the advice," she laughed, and went out through
  the French windows.</p>

  <p>Muller seated himself in a chair beside the desk and deliberately lighted
  a cigar.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen to me, Selby," he began. "I'm your lawyer, and if you don't
  think your lawyer knows better than you do, you're a darned fool if you don't
  sack him. About this Tamagari property. You're crazy. If I'd dreamed you'd
  want to do a fool thing like this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Selby Clive smiled and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You've a bee in your bonnet over the Tamagari property, Jerry," he said.
  "The land has been surveyed&mdash;I've got the report here ready to show
  you&mdash;and if there's silver on it, it's only in such small quantities
  that it isn't worth the expense of doing anything about it."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted Muller. "Let's have a look at your precious report."</p>

  <p>He took the document from Clive, opened it, and spent some minutes
  carefully inspecting it.</p>

  <p>"Huh!" He tossed the document aside. "To read this report you'd think
  there was no silver in Canada at all, let alone on your property. Besides,
  this is ten years old."</p>

  <p>"If there was no silver there ten years ago, Jerry, there's no silver
  there now. The engineer who made the survey&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who was he?" demanded Muller. He picked up the document, turned the page,
  and made a grimace. "Vinereau! Good God!"</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with Vinereau?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I guess, except that he was generally drunk and died in
  <i>delirium tremens</i>. You're not accepting <i>him</i> as an authority? If
  he had found silver he wouldn't have known it."</p>

  <p>"A pretty good metallurgist in his day, Jerry."</p>

  <p>"Sure," agreed Muller. "But you can take it from me that
  this"&mdash;tapping the report&mdash;"wasn't his day." He opened his attach
  case, took out a document, and tossed it on the desk. "Well, there's the
  lease, Selby. It'll need to be registered at Canada House. But remember that
  if you're fool enough to sign it, it's dead against my advice. Still, if
  you're set on being a philanthropist, I guess it's no use wasting any more
  breath on you. You were always a sentimental old fool, and it's too late now,
  I suppose, to think of curing you."</p>

  <p>Clive smiled.</p>

  <p>"Young O'Ryan is a decent sort of fellow, Jerry," he said, "and I'd like
  to do him a good turn if it's possible."</p>

  <p>"You'll be doing him a good turn all right. You'll be leasing him silver
  at the price of lumber, and I guess he won't lie awake at nights thinking how
  unkind you've been to him. You always did have an unholy horror of anyone
  thinking you'd been hard-hearted enough to look after your own interests,
  didn't you? Damn it, man, just for once, set your teeth and be businesslike.
  Lease him the lumber and keep the mineral rights for yourself."</p>

  <p>"It's not worth while, Jerry."</p>

  <p>"It's worth a million dollars."</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Get the idea out of your head that there's silver in Tamagari, Jerry," he
  said. "There isn't. Vinereau may have been all you say, but I'm not relying
  only on his report. O'Ryan has had the land surveyed&mdash;by a friend of
  his&mdash;and the report says there's no sign of minerals." Muller removed
  his cigar from his mouth and smiled at it.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said. "And that settles it&mdash;eh, Selby? Well, if I were a
  buyer, I'd naturally hire a friend who would find no sign of minerals. If he
  did, he'd be no friend of mine. All right; have it your own way. There's no
  reason why you shouldn't give away a million dollars if it'll make you
  happy."</p>

  <p>"You're a suspicious old devil, Jerry."</p>

  <p>"I'm a lawyer," said Muller, "and a lawyer's job is to make provision
  against something that couldn't possibly happen. It's generally the first
  thing that does happen. If you've forgotten that, Selby, you've got a darned
  bad memory. Who is this O'Ryan fellow?"</p>

  <p>"He's a gentleman, anyway. Rather amusing. Nita finds him terribly
  amusing."</p>

  <p>"Huh! I don't like wives who are terribly amused. Start a woman laughing
  and you never know where she'll finish."</p>

  <p>Clive frowned. "When you talk like that, Jerry, you make me ill."</p>

  <p>"I'm the only misogynist I've ever met."</p>

  <p>"Since when? Don't tell me <i>you</i> hate women."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't hate 'em," admitted Muller, "but I should hate to like 'em.
  There was a fortune-teller in a bazaar at Montreal who said I'd be married
  twice. M'm! I wasn't satisfied till I'd got him a month's hard labour. It
  ought to have been ten years: I did my best."</p>

  <p>"You probably will marry twice," said Clive. "It's the thing that can't
  possibly happen that generally happens first, Jerry. I never dreamed that I
  should marry twice, but I did."</p>

  <p>He rose from his desk and began pacing the room. Muller's shrewd blue eyes
  followed him.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, Selby, there's no sense now in wishing you hadn't."</p>

  <p>Clive paused, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Jerry," he said. "We're old pals and can be perfectly frank with
  each other. You don't like Nita."</p>

  <p>"The one thing that it's not safe for a man to be frank about even with an
  old pal is to disillusion him about his womenfolk." He waved his cigar
  deprecatingly. "Anyway, I don't understand women, my boy, and that's all
  there is to it. I'm the only man I've ever met who doesn't understand 'em and
  who admits it. Anyway, I guess a man's wife is his own private load of
  mischief."</p>

  <p>"Nita's not terribly in love with me," said Clive, talking more to
  himself, it seemed, than to his friend. "I've always known that
  and&mdash;made allowances. I'm not the sort of man to inspire that kind of
  love. Women aren't afraid of me; and you can't love people unless you're a
  little bit afraid of them."</p>

  <p>"You're crazy. Fear's hate."</p>

  <p>"It's love, too," said Clive thoughtfully. "There's no love without fear
  of something or other, Jerry&mdash;fear of losing a man, hurting him,
  displeasing him, rousing him. If a woman isn't afraid of you she probably
  despises you, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, frowning thoughtfully. Muller rose. "Well, that seems a pretty
  easy way of making yourself solid with a woman," he said with a smile. "All
  you gotta do is to sit down and pull faces at her."</p>

  <p>He went up to Clive and laid a hand on his shoulder. "Now, listen," he
  said gravely. "You think I'm a damned interfering old busybody, don't you?
  Well, I guess you're right. You're not the only one who thinks that, but I
  shan't lie awake at nights fretting over it. I'm your lawyer as well as your
  friend, and a lawyer's no sort of right to call himself a lawyer if he shirks
  telling unpleasant truths to his client, any more than a friend has any right
  to call himself a friend if he's afraid of getting a snub for straight
  talking. Fortunately, I've a toughish sort of hide, and provided you listen
  to what I'm telling you, you can let off at me as much as you like
  afterwards. And I'm telling you, as I told you on the telephone this morning,
  that if you aren't clean crazy you'll have the whole thing out with your wife
  once and for all. There's only one way to deal with a woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Clive cut him short with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Jerry," he said. "You've done your bit in telling me what you
  have told me, and I'm grateful. But it's entirely a matter between Nita and
  myself, and you must leave me to deal with it in my own way." Muller shrugged
  and turned away.</p>

  <p>"If you're going to sign this damn-fool lease," he said, "I'll phone
  Canada House and have a word with them about the registration."</p>

  <p>Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"You'll find the telephone in the hall."</p>

  <p>Muller picked up the document from the desk and went towards the door. He
  paused, with his hand on the knob, and glanced back at Clive as he stood
  staring thoughtfully into the garden.</p>

  <p>"Selby, you may not scare your wife," he said, "but you scare me
  sometimes."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR some moments after Muller had left him, Selby Clive
  stood gazing thoughtfully into the garden. Stepping out through the French
  windows onto the terrace, he halted again, staring intently at the high yew
  hedge that cut off the lower garden from his view. Then, turning abruptly, he
  reentered the library, seated himself at his desk, methodically filled his
  pipe and lighted it, picked up a document, and began to read.</p>

  <p>He had not read many lines when he caught the sound of hurried footsteps
  on the terrace, and, as he glanced up from the document in his hand, Nita
  came striding in from the garden. She was pale, and her eyes were angry; she
  spoke in quick, breathless snatches.</p>

  <p>"Selby, what&mdash;what is happening&mdash;in the lower garden?"</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Happening, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, don't be stupid! You know what I mean. There's a
  huge hole&mdash;frightfully deep&mdash;right across one of the paths. You
  must have known it was there."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, of course I knew of it. The workmen were busy on it this
  morning. They're putting down a catch-pit for storm water, Nita. You see,
  down in the lower garden&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then why on earth didn't someone tell me about it?" she interrupted
  angrily. "It's most terribly dangerous&mdash;a regular man-trap. You take it
  pretty calmly, Selby. I hope you realize that I came as near as I possibly
  could to breaking my neck in the garden?"</p>

  <p>Clive sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Nita&mdash;I'm sorry&mdash;-I didn't realize&mdash;what
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;fortunately; but I don't know how I managed to avoid it. If
  it had been dark I couldn't possibly have missed it. I had no idea the thing
  was there&mdash;just round the corner of the hedge, of all the idiotic
  places&mdash;and I was reading a newspaper as I walked along and only just
  noticed it in time to stop myself falling in."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Nita! The catch-pit! If I'd realized that you were going
  anywhere near it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You knew I was going in the lower garden&mdash;I told you so. Besides,
  you know quite well I always go there. To make a man-trap like that in the
  middle of the path and say nothing about it&mdash;it's criminal!"</p>

  <p>"Terribly careless of me, Nita," admitted Selby. "But when you said you
  were going to the lower garden I quite forgot the catch-pit. I'm afraid it
  has given you a bad turn, my dear."</p>

  <p>"It's the second time I've nearly had a bad accident in this wretched
  place," she interrupted. "First the balcony gives way and nearly throws me
  down onto the terrace, and now this. And you wonder why I want to get rid of
  the place!"</p>

  <p>"It's very badly built, Nita; I told you that before I bought it, my dear.
  If I had had my way I wouldn't have come here at all."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know! But don't put me in the wrong all the time. I <i>know</i> it
  was my choice, and I know you wouldn't have bought it if it hadn't been for
  me, and I know it's quite unreasonable of me to want to leave it now. But you
  needn't always be right about everything, Selby, need you? At least, if you
  are right, you needn't always tell me so."</p>

  <p>Clive smiled.</p>

  <p>"Am I being tiresome again? Sorry, my dear. I'm afraid I'm rather good at
  being tiresome. And I'll see about the catch-pit. I told those infernal
  workmen to be sure to cover the pit with planks, and I'll have the blood of
  that foreman."</p>

  <p>He went to her and laid a hand on her arm.</p>

  <p>"And now forget the catch-pit, my dear," he said. "I want you to tell me
  something&mdash;rather important." She glanced up quickly and met his
  gaze.</p>

  <p>"Well, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Are you really glad to be back?"</p>

  <p>She gave an almost imperceptible shrug.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," she said suddenly&mdash;"quite glad."</p>

  <p>His arm went round her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Glad to be back&mdash;with me?"</p>

  <p>She released herself and turned away.</p>

  <p>"Don't, Selby&mdash;please."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a puzzled expression in his mildly reproachful eyes.
  She noticed it and relented to the extent of giving him a comforting pat.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, darling," she said, "but I'm feeling awfully bad-tempered. I'm
  tired, I suppose. You're right again, I'm afraid, Selby: I should have been
  much wiser to keep away from the lower garden and have a rest in my room,
  shouldn't I?" She paused for a moment; then: "Suppose I had fallen in the
  man-trap, Selby? I'm afraid the coroner would have been dreadfully nasty
  about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Try to think no more about it, my dear," he interrupted hastily. "Thank
  God, you didn't fall in. Listen. Baumann&mdash;the jeweller fellow&mdash;came
  yesterday. He brought what he called 'a wonderful piece': rather a pretty
  thing&mdash;emeralds and diamonds."</p>

  <p>"A bracelet?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>The hint of a frown ruffled her forehead.</p>

  <p>"You didn't buy it, Selby? Of course, I'm sure it's lovely, but&mdash;"
  She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"But you've no confidence in my taste?"</p>

  <p>"More confidence in my own, anyway, darling," she said. "You know I always
  like to choose things myself if I'm to wear them."</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't exactly buy it," he told her. "Baumann will change it if
  you don't care about it. I arranged that, because the last time I bought you
  a bracelet&mdash;well, it struck me as very pretty, but you didn't seem to
  care for it particularly, and you never wear it."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, darling," she laughed, "but it really was rather awful. The sort
  of thing a barmaid would wear on her evening out."</p>

  <p>Clive smiled.</p>

  <p>"It was a little&mdash;florid, wasn't it?" he admitted. "But this
  piece&mdash;I think you'll like it, Nita. It's very simple: a sort of
  background of diamonds and a knot of emeralds. Something like this," he
  added, and traced a design with his finger on the desk.</p>

  <p>Nita frowned.</p>

  <p>"Selby, don't tell me it's a true-lovers' knot!"</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;yes&mdash;I believe that's what they do call it, now you mention
  it. It struck me as being rather novel, though. Diamonds as a background, you
  know, and&mdash;er&mdash;well, a sort of knot. I'll show you, shall I?"</p>

  <p>He opened one of the drawers of his desk, took out a jewel case, threw
  back the lid, and held it out for her inspection. "Rather lovely, don't you
  think, Nita?" he inquired eagerly. "That's the&mdash;er&mdash;knot."</p>

  <p>Nita nodded and gave an inaudible little sigh. The bracelet was, of
  course, exactly what Selby would inevitably give her. Out of a hundred
  bracelets she could hardly have failed to pick on this one as his selection.
  It was so exactly typical of him. It had the same air of solid worth, the
  same rather heavy impressiveness, the same suggestion of unassailable
  respectability. No woman, she felt, who had herself chosen such a bracelet
  could possibly have landed herself in the predicament in which she had landed
  herself. She could never for an instant have contemplated an indiscretion
  like the episode at the Laffan Hotel. Did Selby really believe her to be the
  type of woman for whom that bracelet was suitable? It would be a comfort to
  think so, just at the moment, but it certainly was not safe to infer that he
  did. He had bought it for her because he thought it "rather lovely" and
  because, since that was his opinion of it, he could not conceive of the
  possibility of her not thinking it "rather lovely," too. That was
  Selby&mdash;always right, always infallible, always taking it for granted
  that everyone would see a thing from his point of view. It irritated her to
  discover, as she stood gazing at the bracelet, that it was just as impossible
  to find any definite fault in it as it was to find any definite fault in
  Selby.</p>

  <p>"You like it, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;of course&mdash;of course I like it.
  It's&mdash;magnificent. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's a good one, Nita. Eight hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>Nita sighed&mdash;audibly this time.</p>

  <p>"Darling, <i>must</i> you tell me how much things cost?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I mean, it's not a cheap one. I&mdash;I thought it would be a
  little surprise for you."</p>

  <p>There was a hint of disappointment in his tone, and she glanced up at him
  to find him looking at her with such obvious anxiety in his eyes&mdash;he
  made her think of a dog that was desperately anxious to do right and
  pathetically afraid it had done wrong&mdash;that she could not bring herself
  to tell him the truth. She smiled at him and closed the case.</p>

  <p>"I think it's charming, Selby," she said, "and you're a darling to have
  thought of it."</p>

  <p>She went to him and was about to kiss him when the door opened and Muller
  came in. He paused and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Carry on, Mrs. Clive," he said, "and don't mind me. And if you can kiss a
  bit of sense into his head, so much the better. The man's a blind fool. But I
  guess you discovered that long ago, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Selby blind?"</p>

  <p>Muller nodded.</p>

  <p>"Can't see&mdash;or won't see&mdash;what's happening right in front of his
  nose. Thinks no friend of his would ever play a low-down trick on him. He's
  crazy."</p>

  <p>Clive seated himself at the desk.</p>

  <p>"It's not that, Jerry," he said: "it's just that I prefer to trust my
  friends until I'm convinced that they have let me down. When I am
  convinced&mdash;" he smiled faintly&mdash;"I fancy I can deal with friends of
  that sort&mdash;in my own way."</p>

  <p>Muller shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess I've said enough to convince you," he said, "and the rest
  is up to you. There's the lease of the Tamagari property." He tossed it on to
  the desk. "I shall want a duplicate to register in Ottawa; you ought to let
  me have it by Monday at the latest."</p>

  <p>He turned to Nita again and waved his cigar towards Clive.</p>

  <p>"He's giving away a million dollars, Mrs. Clive," he said. "Can't you stop
  him?"</p>

  <p>Nita glanced quickly at her husband.</p>

  <p>"What's that, Selby?"</p>

  <p>Clive smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"The bee in Jerry's bonnet buzzing, that's all, Nita. He thinks that there
  are minerals&mdash;silver&mdash;on the property I'm leasing to young
  O'Ryan."</p>

  <p>"I don't think&mdash;I know," said Muller. "Now, listen, Selby: I
  guarantee I could sell that land for a million and a half dollars."</p>

  <p>Glove shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not selling the land at all, Jerry."</p>

  <p>"You're leasing it for ninety years, and that's the nearest you can get to
  selling without actually doing it. What will you be selling in ninety years'
  time?"</p>

  <p>Nita, glancing at Muller, frowned slightly. For all his genial manner,
  there was something about him which roused in her a feeling of antagonism. He
  was so sure of himself, so certain about everything&mdash;the sort of man who
  somehow created the impression that he saw through every action to the motive
  behind it, and that with those keen blue eyes looking at you it would be no
  use hoping to get away with a lie. She could imagine him being very ruthless.
  If you did not agree with him, he would bang his opinion into your head with
  sledgehammer blows until you did agree with him. She had an uneasy feeling
  that he had been banging something into her husband's head. Selby,
  fortunately, had a fairly hard head, and it would take a terrific blow to
  bang into it a belief that she had been seen at the Laffan Hotel with Frank
  O'Ryan. That, she had little doubt now, was what Muller had been trying to
  drive into it, and once he had managed to do so it would need a still harder
  blow to bang the idea out again. Why on earth couldn't the man mind his own
  business? And now he was trying to interfere over the lease, suggesting to
  Selby that Frank was swindling him....</p>

  <p>"I can't see my husband throwing away a million dollars, Mr. Muller," she
  said. "I thought, Selby, that Frank said there was no silver on the
  land?"</p>

  <p>Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"He did, my dear."</p>

  <p>Muller turned and faced her.</p>

  <p>"It's as well to remember, Mrs. Clive," he said, "that O'Ryan is a buyer,
  and I've never yet known a buyer boost what he's wanting to buy. If a hat's
  marked three guineas, I guess you don't tell 'em they ought to be charging
  you five."</p>

  <p>"And in this case, Mr. Muller," she said coldly, "it might be as well to
  remember that Mr. O'Ryan is a friend of mine&mdash;of ours. I've known him
  since we were children together."</p>

  <p>"Fine," smiled Muller. "There's a fellow in Montreal doing five years for
  forging my signature on a cheque, and we used to share the same rattle before
  we could walk. I've always found, Mrs. Clive, that when I do a deal with one
  of my little playmates I need police protection."</p>

  <p>Nita made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"You must have been most unfortunate in your playmates, Mr. Muller," she
  said. "In any case, even if there are minerals on the land, they're of no
  interest to Mr. O'Ryan: he's going to farm."</p>

  <p>"He'll raise a fine crop of mortgages on that land, Mrs. Clive."</p>

  <p>He was gazing at her with those shrewd eyes of his, and with a shrug Nita
  turned away. It was stupid to let him annoy her; he would only lead her into
  saying something which she did not wish to say. Whatever suspicions&mdash;or
  knowledge&mdash;he might have concerning Frank and herself, she would only
  fix them in his mind more firmly than ever if she championed Frank too
  ardently. It surprised her a little that, after last night, she had felt
  impelled to champion him at all.</p>

  <p>"You are going to give Frank the lease, Selby, aren't you?" she
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am, my dear," he told her. "It doesn't do to take too much
  notice of Jerry; he has had so much to do with the law that he has forgotten
  that there are still honest people in the world. I've given O'Ryan my word
  that he shall have the lease, and I'm going to stick to it. As a matter of
  fact, it is already signed."</p>

  <p>Muller took several turns up and down the room, puffing at his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, halting again at the desk, "before you hand over that
  lease, Selby, I'd like to have a talk with Mr. O'Ryan. There's nothing
  against talking&mdash;eh, Mrs. Clive?"</p>

  <p>"When Jerry sets his heart on talking, Nita," said Selby, "it's no use
  trying to put him off it. I'll see if O'Ryan is back yet."</p>

  <p>He rang the bell, and a moment later Lane appeared.</p>

  <p>"See if Mr. O'Ryan is back, please, Lane."</p>

  <p>"He is back, sir," Lane informed him. "I saw him just now&mdash;coming
  from the lower garden."</p>

  <p>Nita shot a quick glance at her husband.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I didn't see him," she said hastily.</p>

  <p>"No?" said Selby. "How odd!"</p>

  <p>"I don't see anything odd about it," replied Nita irritably. "It's more of
  a labyrinth than a garden. He might easily have been in the lower garden all
  the time I was there without my seeing him. Tell him that Mr. Clive would
  like to see him, please, Lane."</p>

  <p>Lane went out, and a few moments later O'Ryan came into the room. He
  paused by the door, and shot a quick, questioning glance at Nita. Clive swung
  round in his chair and waved a hand towards the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Come in, O'Ryan," he said. "I want you to meet my friend Jerry
  Muller&mdash;my Canadian lawyer." O'Ryan went forward and took Muller's
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you, Mr. Muller."</p>

  <p>"So you're the fortunate leaseholder, eh, Mr. O'Ryan? Well, you're a lucky
  young man."</p>

  <p>"Lucky?"</p>

  <p>Muller nodded.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Muller has an idea, Frank," explained Nita, "that there's silver on
  the land Selby's leasing to you."</p>

  <p>"I wish you were a prophet, Mr. Muller," smiled O'Ryan. "My engineer says
  there may be a trace of silver, but only a trace. Do you know the
  country?"</p>

  <p>"Like his right hand," Selby told him. "You had a camp up on the lake,
  didn't you, Jerry?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. The best bass fishing in Canada&mdash;and that's saying a lot. Now,
  about this Tamagari land, Mr. O'Ryan. I understand you're proposing to farm
  it, and, that being so, I'm suggesting to Clive that the mineral
  rights&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nita sighed.</p>

  <p>"Selby, couldn't you possibly stop talking business for a little while?"
  she laughed. "I'm really not a bit interested in leases and that sort of
  thing, and I'm sure Mr. Muller must be as tired of them as I am." She turned
  to O'Ryan. "You haven't even said 'How are you?' yet, Frank."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan started.</p>

  <p>"I say, I'm terribly sorry," he apologized. "Did you enjoy your Scottish
  trip?"</p>

  <p>Nita made a grimace.</p>

  <p>"Wonderfully!" she said. "All the men talked salmon, and all the women
  talked men&mdash;two subjects in which I'm not much more interested than I am
  in leases."</p>

  <p>Clive rose and handed Muller a document.</p>

  <p>"That's the end of business, Nita," he smiled. "You've had more than your
  dose since you came home this morning, and if I tire you too badly as soon as
  you're back I shall have you running away and leaving me again." He turned to
  Muller. "There's nothing more to discuss, Jerry," he said. "I stand by what
  I've already said. Those are the particulars of the Toronto lots you asked
  for&mdash;as far as I remember them. I'd post them, but the nearest pillar
  box is a mile away. We're almost as uncivilized here as you are in Canada,
  when it comes to posting a letter. But it's really Nita's fault: she would
  make me buy this place."</p>

  <p>"And Selby has worried the post office so much," said Nita, "that they've
  promised to put up a pillar box opposite the house."</p>

  <p>"Promised!" laughed Selby. "You should know how much a promise is worth
  nowadays, my dear. At present they've got no further than sending relays of
  men to stare at the site and put chalk marks on the ground. They were doing
  it again this morning, but there's still no pillar box." He went to the
  French windows. "Come along, Jerry, and see my catch-pit. I'm going to make
  the lower garden a little Eden."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted the lawyer. "I guess he won't have to import a
  snake&mdash;eh, Mrs. Clive?"</p>

  <p>He went out with Clive onto the terrace, and O'Ryan moved towards the
  windows, obviously anxious to follow them. Nita, watching him with a
  suggestion of amusement in her eyes, seated herself in an armchair and
  lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Frank!"</p>

  <p>He paused at the window, glanced back, and saw her beckoning with her
  finger.</p>

  <p>"You had better stay and talk to me, please, Frank," she said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">O'RYAN turned, with a slight shrug, and came slowly back
  into the room. He was frowning, Nita noted, and he struck a match for his
  cigarette as if he had a grudge against it. He seated himself, with one leg
  swinging, on the corner of the desk, and sat for some moments, thoughtfully
  staring at his shoe, before he glanced up at her.</p>

  <p>"I say, Nita, there's nothing&mdash;nothing wrong, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Wrong?"</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;us."</p>

  <p>Nita smiled.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;fortunately, Frank. But I admit it was a close shave.
  Aren't you feeling terribly relieved today that you can still look Selby in
  the eyes?"</p>

  <p>"You don't think&mdash;Selby&mdash;it struck me when I got here this
  morning that he seemed a bit queer. But I'm probably imagining things. What
  could he possibly know?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose he knew&mdash;everything?"</p>

  <p>He sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Nita, you don't really mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not saying he does know anything," she interrupted: "I'm only saying
  that, if he had somehow had his suspicions aroused, you went the very best
  way about confirming them. You're supposed not to have seen me for over a
  week, yet you come in here and don't even say 'Good-morning.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. Sorry, Nita. But just for the moment I was feeling pretty
  badly rattled. Lane came out and said I was wanted in here, and you had just
  passed me in the garden without a word, and I wondered&mdash;what on earth
  was the matter, Nita? You looked as white as death, and you went straight
  past without even looking at me."</p>

  <p>"I'd nearly had a bad accident. Selby's catch-pit&mdash; a regular
  man-trap&mdash;right across the path. I only just missed falling in and
  breaking my neck."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" exclaimed O'Ryan fervently.</p>

  <p>"And thank you for that, Frank," she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I didn't mean that, darling. But you passed me without a word, and
  naturally I jumped to the conclusion that Selby&mdash;somehow&mdash;I mean,
  you looked so scared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was so like Selby&mdash;he's never happy unless he's watching people
  digging holes. He's a born potterer. Still, I didn't fall in, so there's
  really nothing to make a fuss about. I seem to have a knack of avoiding
  mantraps, don't I?"</p>

  <p>He picked up the jewel case from the desk and sat thoughtfully toying with
  it.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you something, Nita, shall I?" he said. "I think you're a mean
  little swine."</p>

  <p>"I'm not contradicting you, Frank. I've been feeling rather a mean little
  swine ever since I got back&mdash;and met Selby."</p>

  <p>He opened the jewel case, glanced at the bracelet, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yours?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! Did he give it to you? But I needn't ask: only Selby Clive
  could have given you a thing like this. What's this squiffy thing&mdash;like
  a couple of green worms?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You could hardly be expected to know what that is, Frank," she said.
  "It's a true lovers' knot."</p>

  <p>She rose from her chair, crossed to him, took the jewel case from his
  hand, and closed it.</p>

  <p>"If anything has made me feel mean, this has," she said, tapping the case
  with a finger. "Selby bought it for me&mdash;it cost him eight hundred
  pounds, which is a lot of money even to Selby&mdash;just because he wanted to
  give me a surprise when I got back from Scotland."</p>

  <p>"Instead of which he gave you a shock, eh?" grinned O'Ryan. "Did you
  scream when you saw it?"</p>

  <p>She laid the case on the desk.</p>

  <p>"I didn't feel like screaming," she said. "I felt much more like bursting
  into tears. When Selby showed it to me, I believe I hated you more than
  before. I know I hated myself&mdash;just for a moment. Selby tries so
  desperately hard But never mind. Why do <i>you</i> think I'm a mean little
  swine?"</p>

  <p>"If it was meant to be a joke, Nita," he said, "it didn't strike me as a
  particularly funny one. What time did you leave the hotel?"</p>

  <p>"Soon after eight&mdash;without breakfast. I was in a hurry. I'd have left
  last night if I could have got away without attracting attention. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. The least I expected, when they brought in my breakfast,
  was a rather penitent little note."</p>

  <p>"And a bunch of forget-me-nots?"</p>

  <p>He took her hand, but she withdrew it sharply. "Don't you think you're
  rather a pig, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan smiled.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I had knocked on the door? I nearly did. What would you have
  done?"</p>

  <p>Nita turned from him with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"I should probably have rung for the night porter and had you thrown out
  of the hotel."</p>

  <p>"I say, that's a bit steep, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. That was how I was feeling about you, anyway."</p>

  <p>She was leaning a shoulder against the frame of the French windows, with
  her back towards him, gazing out into the garden, and for some moments he sat
  watching her with a rather sulky frown. Then he got up and began pacing the
  room.</p>

  <p>"You know, Nita," he began, "you're the queerest girl&mdash;suddenly
  changing your mind and dashing up to your room and Oh, I'm damned if I
  understand."</p>

  <p>She gave a hard little laugh.</p>

  <p>"You make me feel very old when you talk like that, Frank. You don't
  understand! I suppose I shouldn't have expected you to understand. It's the
  only thing&mdash;your not understanding&mdash;that makes it possible to think
  of forgiving you."</p>

  <p>"But, damn it, it was your idea!" he protested. "You sent me the telegram.
  You told me you'd be staying at the Laffan, and of course I thought you
  meant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lord, the woman tempted me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's just the point: I didn't," grumbled O'Ryan. "If I had eaten, I
  shouldn't be grousing." He went to her and put his arm around her shoulders.
  "Nita darling," he said, "it's you who don't understand. You don't seem to
  realize how I'd looked forward to yesterday. I've longed for it, dreamed of
  it, waited for it, hoping that one day, if I were patient, you'd give me my
  reward. And when I got your telegram&mdash;you don't know what that meant to
  me. I never for an instant doubted that you meant it. I was
  there&mdash;hanging about in the Laffan&mdash;hours before you arrived. I
  don't know how I passed the time in that beastly room, and then&mdash;you
  bolted your door! When I discovered that, I just couldn't believe it. I
  nearly went mad. I simply couldn't understand&mdash;after that
  telegram&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She freed herself from his arm.</p>

  <p>"I've warned you before, Frank," she said, "that when you're trying to rob
  a man of his wife it isn't wise to be affectionate in public. Selby's in the
  garden."</p>

  <p>"What was it&mdash;a sudden spasm of conscience?" he demanded. "All I can
  say is, damn your conscience!"</p>

  <p>"My conscience?" She shook her head. "It wasn't that&mdash;entirely.
  Listen, Frank. You say that you don't understand. That's probably quite
  true&mdash;though I didn't realize it last night&mdash;and I'm glad in a way.
  But I want to make you understand. You think I'm a mean little cat because I
  ran away from you and shot the bolt and left the Laffan before you were up
  this morning. But I'm not. I may be all sorts of other
  things&mdash;old-fashioned, overfastidious, stupidly sentimental&mdash;but
  I'm not mean&mdash;as far as you are concerned."</p>

  <p>"If you only meant to play the fool, Nita, why send that telegram?"</p>

  <p>"When I sent the telegram," she told him, "I didn't mean to play the fool.
  I meant you to understand it just as you did understand it. I meant to see it
  through. I had made up my mind that I wanted you more than I wanted Selby,
  that you and I meant more to each other than Selby and I ever could, and I
  persuaded myself that I should be perfectly justified in doing what I had
  decided to do. I believe I was really terribly in love with you on the
  journey back to London." She laughed nervously. "You'd never believe what
  castles I built&mdash;about you and me and the future&mdash;when once I'd
  sent off that wire. Just like a sentimental schoolgirl. I never thought again
  about Selby. I just sat there dreaming of glamorous days with you, when we
  should always be together&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off with a sudden gesture of impatience. "But what's the use of
  talking about that?" she went on. "The point is, Frank, that to me it was all
  something wonderful&mdash;beautiful&mdash;sacred. You were going to take me
  into a kind of fairyland, and then&mdash;then&mdash;when we were having
  dinner&mdash;you said something which told me quite clearly that, instead of
  taking me to fairyland, you were only asking me to share in a nasty little
  backstairs intrigue."</p>

  <p>"Nita!"</p>

  <p>"It's true!" she exclaimed. "A sordid, squalid, hole-in-the-corner
  liaison&mdash;a little flat somewhere&mdash;sneaking into it like a couple of
  criminals, scared of being seen together, kissing each other as if we were
  doing something shameful, despising each other all the time&mdash;just being
  nasty and cheap and furtive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let me finish," she insisted. "That's all you had to offer me, Frank, and
  when I realized what you wanted, I just couldn't do it, and I hated you for
  wanting it, for expecting me to take part in it. I suppose I should have
  found out exactly what you did mean first, but I took it for granted that, if
  I left Selby and went to you, I'd be able to do so
  openly&mdash;decently&mdash;cleanly. I was ready to do that. But the other
  way&mdash;your way&mdash;sorry, but the gilt was off the gingerbread, and I
  shot the bolt. Thank God for the bolt! It held the door shut between a rather
  lovely dream and a terribly sordid reality."</p>

  <p>She paused, and stood watching his bewildered face. "Don't you understand
  now?"</p>

  <p>"What you mean, Nita," he said sulkily, "is that unless I'm prepared to
  marry you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Prepared?" She sighed. "Don't be too enthusiastic, Frank, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you know what I mean," said O'Ryan, with a touch of irritation.
  "You knew&mdash;you must have known&mdash;that I couldn't marry you yet. My
  bank manager will confirm that, if you doubt my word. But of course I meant
  to marry you as soon as possible. As soon as I get going with the Tamagari
  land, money won't matter; but in the meantime ... Good Lord, Nita! That sort
  of thing&mdash;nowadays&mdash;it never struck me you'd be so damnably
  squeamish. I certainly never thought you'd work that sort of stunt on me. I
  wonder you've the nerve to look me in the face."</p>

  <p>The girl smiled.</p>

  <p>"You're really rather delicious, Frank," she said. "You can look Selby in
  the face, can't you?"</p>

  <p>He turned from her impatiently.</p>

  <p>"That's a frightfully commonplace thing to say," he replied testily.
  "After all, you're not in love with Selby."</p>

  <p>"And I am in love with you?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You pretend to be, Nita, but I'm damned if I know. One moment you're
  arranging to meet me at the Laffan, and the next you're wanting to burst into
  tears because Selby has bought you a hideous bracelet. Hang it, we'd be doing
  Selby no harm. Hurt his pride a bit, perhaps, but that's all. I mean to say,
  you and he&mdash;you've always led me to suppose&mdash;it isn't as though I'd
  be taking anything from him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She cut him short.</p>

  <p>"You're floundering, Frank," she said. Then she went to him and laid a
  hand on his arm. "Poor old Frank!" she said. "I really am sorry."</p>

  <p>"If you had only pulled that beastly bolt back again, Nita&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;I'm not sorry about that," she said. "Not at the moment,
  anyway. Perhaps one of these days, when I'm feeling bored beyond endurance,
  it might seem worth it not to be quite so early Victorian.... I don't know.
  No; I'm sorry I was so stupid that I went to the Laffan at all. When I
  decided to go&mdash;still, it's ... nothing. One might easily find oneself
  staying in the same hotel as a man one knows&mdash;on the same floor&mdash;in
  the next suite. But I didn't feel like that about it when I got there. Not
  when I got up to my room, I mean. I felt so terribly guilty that I believe I
  blushed when I said good-night to the chambermaid. And when you feel guilty
  in front of servants you're on the high-road to losing your
  self-respect."</p>

  <p>"Oh, rot!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she admitted. "But I haven't lost that guilty feeling yet."</p>

  <p>"Windy?" He smiled confidently. "You needn't be; Selby's not a suspicious
  man."</p>

  <p>"Isn't he? I wouldn't be too sure about that."</p>

  <p>He shot her a quick, anxious glance.</p>

  <p>"I say, he isn't, is he? I mean, I don't see how&mdash;you don't think he
  has any idea&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He may have," said Nita. "We may as well face it. Selby may know. I've a
  feeling that he does know&mdash;something. Did he ask you&mdash;when you
  arrived this morning, I mean&mdash;where you stayed in town last
  night?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, now you come to mention it, Nita," said O'Ryan
  thoughtfully, "he did ask me."</p>

  <p>"What did you say? You didn't tell him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That I stayed at the Laffan in the room next to yours?" He grinned. "I
  didn't tell him anything; I sort of passed it off. After all, Nita, there's
  nothing to get scared about. We're both as innocent as the unborn
  babe&mdash;unfortunately. Selby has nothing to be suspicious of."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't he? Think it out, Frank. We two knew that there was nothing in it,
  but put yourself in Selby's place and see if it looks quite as harmless.
  Imagine that your wife, instead of coming home, as she had said she would,
  spent the night in London at the Laffan Hotel without troubling to let you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Nita, if you hadn't the sense to tell him you wouldn't be back
  until the next day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I hadn't," she said. "But I didn't expect things to turn out quite as
  they did. I didn't expect to be coming back here at all. And in any case
  Selby phoned to Scotland and knew I'd left, so the lie would have been
  wasted. And then suppose, Frank, your wife stayed at the Laffan in a room
  which was booked for her by some young man of whom you knew her to be rather
  fond, and the room was next to his, with a communicating door&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite," interrupted O'Ryan. "I'd probably instruct my solicitor&mdash;if
  I knew. But Selby can't possibly know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And suppose," she went on, "your wife were seen in the foyer by the
  manager, who knows her quite well by sight, obviously waiting to meet
  someone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good God! Were you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you didn't tell me? We could have cleared out of the Laffan."</p>

  <p>"I know. But being seen didn't seem to matter&mdash;then. Selby was bound
  to know, anyway, I thought."</p>

  <p>"And you think the manager told him&mdash;telephoned here, perhaps, and
  spilt the beans&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," she said wearily. "I've wondered until I'm sick of
  wondering. All I know is that this morning, just as I was leaving, Selby
  telephoned to the Laffan and asked for me, and the reception clerk told him
  I'd spent the night there and had just left. He says he only guessed I'd have
  gone there, but I'm not so sure. There's that man Muller."</p>

  <p>"Nasty bit of work, Nita."</p>

  <p>"He's shrewd&mdash;and he's Selby's oldest friend, if that's what you
  mean," said Nita. "He stayed at the Laffan last night."</p>

  <p>"Oh! He didn't see us&mdash;me&mdash;did he?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know what he saw or didn't see?" she exclaimed. "He didn't tell
  me, when we met, that he'd seen me with you at the Laffan last night, but he
  somehow managed to make me feel&mdash;oh, I don't know. I don't think I'm
  just imagining things, but I've a feeling that Selby knows and that Muller
  told him. He kept on sort of hinting, and looking at me as if&mdash;oh, it's
  hopeless trying to explain. Muller knows: I'm certain of that. And if Muller
  knows, then it's ten to one he has told Selby."</p>

  <p>"But if Selby hasn't said anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would he?" She shook her head. "You don't know him like I do. He'd
  wait&mdash;and watch; and suddenly, when you weren't expecting it,
  he'd&mdash;well, I told you what he'd probably do, didn't I? It doesn't
  follow, because Selby has said nothing, that he knows nothing. Besides, from
  one or two hints he has let fall&mdash;oh, I don't know, Frank. I'm scared,
  that's all."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan was frowning, gnawing the tip of his finger. "Deuced awkward, Nita,
  if he does know!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for heaven's sake," she exclaimed irritably, "don't start dishing out
  platitudes. Do you suppose I need telling it would be deuced awkward?"</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;that lease and everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lease?" She smiled. "Oh, yes, of course. How stupid! I thought you were
  thinking about me. It might be just a little awkward for me too, mightn't it?
  But, of course, the lease&mdash;naturally&mdash;much more deuced awkward for
  you. If Selby should be unreasonable enough to refuse to grant the lease to a
  man who has seduced his wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cut out that sort of talk," he interrupted. "It doesn't help either of
  us. If Selby knows, the lease has gone west, and you don't seem to
  realize&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I do," she said, turning abruptly away from him. "I realize just
  how important Nita and the lease are to you. Nita and the lease, or the lease
  and Nita?" She shrugged a shoulder. "I wonder who first thought of putting
  bolts on communicating doors. It's a grand idea, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Ridiculous nonsense, if you ask me."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It's a fine idea," she repeated. "It gives people a chance to change
  their minds&mdash;in time."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">NITA strolled out onto the terrace and stood with her arms
  resting on the parapet, gazing at the riot of rambler roses. They were
  wonderful this year&mdash;masses of red and pink blossom that formed a solid
  hedge across the end of the lawn. She remembered that three years ago, when
  she had come with Selby to view the house, she had casually remarked that a
  few ramblers would improve the garden, and this was the result. So like
  Selby; he was always thorough in whatever he undertook. No half measures. No
  sense of proportion, really, she supposed&mdash;rather inclined to overdo
  things in his desire for thoroughness. That bracelet, for instance. Eight
  hundred pounds, when he could have given her just as much pleasure by buying
  her something which had cost him ten. Solid masses of roses and solid masses
  of diamonds. She would never be able to wear the thing. And a true-lovers'
  knot! Just like Selby! Terribly sentimental, really, and so many of the
  things he did for her had a true-lovers' knot attached to them. She wished
  they hadn't; it would be so much easier to treat him badly if he cared for
  her less or even considered her less. He gave her everything she asked
  for&mdash;almost; usually far more than she asked for&mdash;like the
  ramblers&mdash;and it made her feel terribly cheap when she thought how
  little she gave him in return.</p>

  <p>He still seemed to think that he hadn't given her enough rambler roses. He
  was having a new pergola built&mdash;a solid-looking affair of massive timber
  baulks that was at present a dreadful eyesore&mdash;and he probably intended
  to have it covered with ramblers. Once an idea got into Selby's head it was
  impossible to get it out again. That bracelet was the third he had given her
  recently&mdash;each one rather less possible than the one before. Still, she
  hadn't liked it when Frank had laughed at the bracelet. His sneers had
  somehow stung her, angered her, made her want to defend Selby and hurt Frank.
  Funny that she should feel like that.</p>

  <p>The thought of Frank brought a pucker between her eyebrows. He hadn't
  shown up particularly well, she reflected. He was scared stiff in case Selby
  knew. He had suddenly gone very white when she had told him that Selby had
  telephoned to the Laffan. "Deuced awkward!" It would certainly be all that
  for Frank if Selby did know. Selby versus Frank&mdash;it would be a pitifully
  unequal sort of contest. She had, of course, meant to scare Frank. She had
  wanted to shake him out of his complacency, hurt him, make him suffer in some
  way for his treatment of her yesterday. Partly that, and partly that she was
  nervous herself and had felt an urgent need to unburden herself to someone.
  She had hoped, she supposed, that Frank would tell her that there was nothing
  to worry about, reassure her, give her some explanation of that telephone
  call which would convince her that it was only her uneasy conscience that was
  making her imagine all sorts of unlikely possibilities. But the result had
  been that she had only frightened herself a little more. She had frightened
  Frank, and his fear had infected her. She had not fully realized, until she
  had marshalled the evidence for Frank's benefit, how convincing was the case
  against her, and the net result of her vindictive longing to make him suffer
  had simply been to increase her own uneasiness by adding his to it.</p>

  <p>It served her right, perhaps, for being vindictive. After all, she had
  treated Frank pretty badly&mdash;from his point of view&mdash;and he was
  hardly to be blamed because he had not understood hers. She had never given
  him reason to suspect her of being old-fashioned over such matters; she had
  rather been at pains to make him believe her very modern and broad-minded and
  difficult to shock. The streak of Puritanism which she knew to be in her she
  had always carefully concealed, from the same instinct that would have made
  her conceal a grey hair or a greasy complexion&mdash;because grey hairs and
  greasy complexions were not fashionable. She hadn't, perhaps, been quite fair
  to Frank in judging him by her own standards, particularly since they were
  standards to which she would not, except to herself, admit allegiance. He,
  after all, stirred something in her which no other man had ever stirred. She
  would not easily forget last night, when she had sat with him in the
  restaurant at the Laffan, in a sort of haze of happiness, every sense so
  acutely alive, every nerve keyed up to respond to the faintest breath of
  sensation....</p>

  <p>She caught the sound of footsteps on the gravel path and glanced round to
  see Muller and her husband coming towards the house.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here you are, darling!" said Selby, as he came up the steps. "Muller
  wants to get back to town and I'm going to look up a train for him."</p>

  <p>She nodded. So Muller was going. Thank God for that, anyway. Muller, with
  his shrewd blue eyes and his air of knowing everything&mdash;perhaps she'd
  feel better when he was out of the way. She could probably manage Selby
  alone, whatever he might suspect. But Selby with Muller beside him, prompting
  him, goading him, banging facts into his head ...</p>

  <p>She realized that Muller was loitering on the terrace.</p>

  <p>"So it's only a flying visit, Mr. Muller?" she said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Sure," replied Muller. "A matter of business, but it won't mean more than
  a few hours in London. I'll be back as soon as I can get here. Tonight,
  perhaps; tomorrow anyway&mdash;if you feel you can put up with me. Selby says
  I shan't be in the way."</p>

  <p>"Of course not."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Selby likes to have me around," he said. "God knows why. He says I'm
  always bullying him over something, and I guess he's right. But when you see
  an old friend making a damn fool of himself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And is he?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"Over&mdash;over that lease?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's just one particular instance of his foolishness, Mrs. Clive,
  but there are others. But you can't teach Selby&mdash;never could. Gets an
  idea into his cranium and nothing short of dynamite can shift it. He's an
  obstinate old devil. Tell him he's doing a thing in the wrong way, and he's
  dead sure to go on doing it that way. Tell him to open his eyes and face
  facts, and he'll clamp 'em tight shut and shirk 'em. That's Selby&mdash;God
  bless him!"</p>

  <p>"And what in particular is he doing in the wrong way now, Mr. Muller?"</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted the lawyer. "Pretty near everything." He waved a hand
  towards the lower garden. "His precious catch-pit, for instance. I've just
  been telling him he's tackling things in the wrong way. His methods
  are&mdash;well, I reckon 'primitive' is the word; and if he carries on that
  way he'll only be landing himself in serious trouble."</p>

  <p>Nita was frowning.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;over draining the garden?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. What else could I mean? Making an Eden, is he? If you want my
  opinion, he's heading straight for a deluge."</p>

  <p>He turned abruptly and strode into the library, and Nita, after a moment's
  hesitation, followed. Clive was seated at his desk, poring over an A B C;
  O'Ryan, smoking a cigarette, was lolling against the mantelpiece. She noticed
  that he was smiling in his usual confident way, but there was a look in his
  eyes, as he glanced quickly at her, which cancelled out his confident smile.
  And he was smoking very quickly.</p>

  <p>"I've just been telling O'Ryan that I've a bone to pick with him," said
  her husband, as she stepped in through the French windows.</p>

  <p>Nita smiled.</p>

  <p>"Never argue with Selby over a bone, Frank," she laughed. "He snaps.
  What's the bone, Selby?"</p>

  <p>Clive turned a page of the time-table.</p>

  <p>"All the time you've been in Scotland, my dear," he said, "the young
  bounder has never been near me. Instead of taking pity on my solitude, he has
  been gallivanting off somewhere or other&mdash;Paris, wasn't it, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;absolutely&mdash;Paris," replied O'Ryan. "Sorry to have
  deserted you, sir, but I only got back last night."</p>

  <p>"And last night, when you got back from Paris, instead of coming along
  here to keep me company&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't be done, sir. I had an appointment in town."</p>

  <p>"A pleasant one, I hope."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan smiled.</p>

  <p>"It promised to be&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>Clive glanced up.</p>

  <p>"And it didn't work out quite as you expected? Well, if there was a woman
  in the case&mdash;as I suppose there was&mdash;I can quite understand that.
  Things rarely do work out as you expect them to when there's a woman
  concerned."</p>

  <p>"Depends what you expect, doesn't it?" remarked Nita. "What do you know
  about women, Selby, anyway?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged and returned to the time-table.</p>

  <p>"I've been married twice," he said.</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted Muller. "If you weren't here, Mrs. Clive, do you know what
  I'd say to him? I'd tell him that having married twice doesn't prove a darned
  thing except that he didn't learn much about women on his first trip."</p>

  <p>Nita smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not enough to avoid a second trip, eh, Mr. Muller? That's rather sweet of
  you, isn't it? Or perhaps you were polite enough only to mean that he didn't
  learn enough about women to justify him in attempting a second trip?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind me," laughed her husband. "I'm slanging O'Ryan. A man who's
  supposed to be my friend and prefers to stay at some hotel in
  town&mdash;where do you stay in town, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>The young man removed his cigarette from his lips and stared intently at
  the glowing tip.</p>

  <p>"Oh, various places ... sometimes at my club."</p>

  <p>"You should try the Laffan," advised Selby, running a finger down the
  page. "Rather a jolly place, isn't it, Nita? They can make you as snug as if
  you were in a flat of your own&mdash;all the rooms communicate. That cuts
  both ways, of course. It can be jolly awkward if you forget to bolt the
  doors."</p>

  <p>Nita did her utmost not to look at O'Ryan, but she could not help it. She
  saw the sudden alarm in his eyes and risked a frown at him. Thank goodness
  Selby had not looked at him as he had made that remark: he would have needed
  no further confirmation. If only Frank would get a grip of himself!</p>

  <p>"Of course, if you're intelligent," added her husband, "you don't forget.
  Bolts are a good idea to my mind&mdash;better than keys, because you can't
  lose them, and they're just as effective."</p>

  <p>"Provided they're on the right side of the door, Selby," laughed his wife.
  "Selby's crazy about bolts," she explained. "They have small silver bolts at
  the Laffan, and he wasn't satisfied, after he'd seen them, until he'd had
  small silver bolts fitted to all the doors here." She waved a hand towards
  the door of the library. "It looks rather silly in a library, doesn't it? But
  he would have it."</p>

  <p>She was scaring O'Ryan badly; she could see that. All this skating on thin
  ice was sending cold shivers down his spine, and somehow she wanted to keep
  him shivering. She was wondering if she could find still thinner ice....</p>

  <p>"Reminded you of home, eh, Nita?" said Clive. "Last night, I
  mean&mdash;when you deserted me&mdash;at the Laffan&mdash;the little silver
  bolt."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she wanted no thinner ice. She wanted desperately to get off the
  ice altogether.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you poring over, Selby?" she exclaimed irritably. "Mr.
  Muller is waiting for the car."</p>

  <p>"Jerry's going by train," interrupted Clive. "He hates cars. Two years ago
  he drove a car into a tree in Canada, and since then he hasn't a good word to
  say for motors. Here we are&mdash;four thirty-five,
  five-seventeen&mdash;that's a good train, Jerry."</p>

  <p>"Not so bad&mdash;for this country," grunted the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"I'll walk with you to the station," said Clive. "There's heaps of
  time."</p>

  <p>Muller nodded.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Mrs. Clive," he said, "for the moment." He turned to O'Ryan.
  "Good-bye, Mr. O'Ryan. You're a lucky young man. Still, if you get what I
  think you'll get, the laugh's on Selby."</p>

  <p>At the door Clive paused.</p>

  <p>"I forgot to tell you, Nita," he said. "Whitcombe phoned through to say
  that he's coming along to tea." Nita sighed.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask him to stay to dinner, darling, that's all. I shall fall asleep
  to the droning."</p>

  <p>Her husband smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's a nice old boy&mdash;frightfully interesting."</p>

  <p>"If you meet him, Selby, on your way to the station, be an angel and take
  him with you. He drives me distracted, and if I have to entertain him to tea
  on my own&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll be back in time if I can, my dear," he assured her. "If I'm
  not&mdash;" he nodded towards O'Ryan&mdash;"O'Ryan will look after you. I'm
  sure he's an excellent chaperon."</p>

  <p>As the door closed behind her husband, Nita turned to O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"Well, Frank?"</p>

  <p>"I say, you&mdash;you heard? All that stuff about the Laffan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Does he know?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;the way he kept on at it&mdash;pumping me about where I'd been
  and what I'd been doing&mdash;it looks as if he knows something. But how on
  earth&mdash;You don't suppose he had somebody watching, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Frank. That's not Selby. Besides, there was no need.
  There's the manager of the Laffan&mdash;and Mr. Muller; either of them may
  have seen us and told him. We know that&mdash;almost for certain; and
  goodness knows how many other people may have seen us."</p>

  <p>"Comforting, aren't you? I'm not so sure, though. If Selby got wind of
  anything, he might easily have put someone to watch."</p>

  <p>"I tell you he didn't&mdash;he wouldn't!" she interrupted angrily.
  "Besides, until we were actually at the Laffan, he couldn't possibly have got
  wind of anything. He's not a mind reader. I'm not so sure that Mr. Muller
  isn't, though. Awkward if he is, eh, Frank? For both of us, of course, but
  particularly for you. It must be an enormous asset to a lawyer to be able to
  read what's going on in his client's mind&mdash;all the little subterfuges
  and deceptions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Talk sense," he interrupted irritably. "You don't seem to realize that
  this is a jolly serious matter for me. If this deal didn't come off, I'd be
  in a hell of a mess. And he was talking about helping me to finance the
  syndicate. I've no capital, and I've got to find some somewhere&mdash;it's
  too good a chance to miss&mdash;and if only Selby will lend a hand&mdash;see
  what I mean? It's a damned serious business."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Would it be very indiscreet of me if I asked you something, Frank? I
  think I will ask you, anyway. <i>Is</i> there silver on the property?"</p>

  <p>He turned from her with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Well, you never know, you know. There may be."</p>

  <p>"I see," she said thoughtfully. "Has anybody said there is silver on the
  property?"</p>

  <p>He came back at her irritably:</p>

  <p>"I've told you&mdash;there's always a chance."</p>

  <p>"Then I <i>am</i> being indiscreet?"</p>

  <p>"Nita darling, be an angel," he begged, "and don't start nagging me now.
  I've enough to worry me, in all conscience. Besides, you know what I've told
  you. As soon as I get the syndicate floated I'm going to give you a block of
  shares. I'm not going to let you down."</p>

  <p>"That makes me feel rather like a thief, Frank."</p>

  <p>"Why should it?"</p>

  <p>"It does, anyway. My conscience again, perhaps&mdash;refusing to be
  damned."</p>

  <p>"Oh, rot!" exclaimed O'Ryan. "There's nothing to turn you squeamish. It's
  only fair. You've married without a settlement, and if anything should
  happen&mdash;you know what I mean. If... you know?"</p>

  <p>"If I pulled the bolt&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"And if Selby found out&mdash;well, you'd be penniless. Isn't that
  so?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I mean, he may know already&mdash;about last night&mdash;and that's all
  the evidence he'd want, and you've got to look after yourself. There's
  nothing wrong in being on the safe side. Why the hell you married him, I
  don't know. He's a good chap and all that sort of thing, but&mdash;well, you
  knew absolutely nothing about him, did you? Except that he made a pile of
  money in Canada, nobody does know anything about him."</p>

  <p>"And most people," she replied, "provided he had the money, didn't care
  where or how he had made it. I was one of them." She was thoughtful for some
  moments. Then: "I'll tell you something, Frank. Selby is one of the nicest
  men I have ever met. I hate myself sometimes because I've been such a
  brute&mdash;such a mean little beast&mdash;to him. I could quite easily fall
  in love with him&mdash;if he weren't so nice."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes you talk pretty average rot, Nita, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Do I? Selby, after all, has all the qualities that any sane woman likes.
  Most women, I expect, would think me marvellously lucky to have married him.
  Lots of them were terribly annoyed about it, anyway. If something would only
  shake me in the right direction, I might fall desperately in love with
  him."</p>

  <p>"If something would shake him in the direction of signing that lease, I
  should be a good deal happier. I wish that infernal lawyer weren't here. That
  fellow dislikes me. He as good as told me that, if he had his way, the lease
  never would be signed."</p>

  <p>"But the lease is signed, Frank."</p>

  <p>"No! Really?"</p>

  <p>"Selby himself told me so."</p>

  <p>"I say, if that's so&mdash;good egg! Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Best bit of news I've had for a long time," said O'Ryan, with a smile of
  satisfaction. "But I wonder&mdash;the mineral rights, you know&mdash;that's
  what I'm rather scared about. Muller didn't persuade him to stick to the
  mineral rights, did he?"</p>

  <p>"Always a chance, eh, Frank? No, I'm pretty sure Selby wasn't persuaded to
  do that. Muller tried to make him, I fancy, but Selby wouldn't listen. He had
  promised you the lease, and when he does a thing he always does it
  thoroughly. I don't think you need worry: you'll get what you want, and the
  laugh, as Mr. Muller said, will be on Selby."</p>

  <p>"I hope you're right, Nita, but I shan't feel really comfortable until
  I've seen the lease and made sure." Nita went to the writing desk.</p>

  <p>"I expect it's here somewhere," she said, beginning to turn over the
  papers that were strewn on it, "and as it's all fixed up there can't be any
  reason why you shouldn't see it. If you're so terribly anxious, why didn't
  you ask Selby about it? I'm sure he'd have told you." He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The less said about it the better while that man Muller was here," he
  said. "I didn't want to start a discussion with him. Besides, if I kept
  asking about it&mdash;especially about the mineral rights&mdash;Selby might
  have thought I was trying to stampede him into it before he had a chance to
  think it over."</p>

  <p>She glanced up at him.</p>

  <p>"You stampeding Selby?" She smiled. "You've a wonderful imagination,
  Frank. I'm afraid you'll be wasted on farming." She began turning over the
  papers again. "What does a lease look like, Frank? Is this it? It looks legal
  enough, anyway."</p>

  <p>She held out a document, and O'Ryan took it eagerly and began rapidly
  glancing down the typewritten sheets.</p>

  <p>"This is an agreement for&mdash;" he hastily turned a page
  &mdash;"excavating, supplying, and laying down earthenware pipes." He tossed
  the document back on to the desk. "That's not it, Nita."</p>

  <p>"Then I'm afraid you'll have to wait," she said.</p>

  <p>"The lease isn't here&mdash;unless Wait a minute, though. I've just got an
  idea. There's a secret drawer here somewhere; Selby showed it to me once.
  Poor darling, he adores that sort of thing. He had it made a couple of years
  ago&mdash;for important papers, he said. I think I can remember..."</p>

  <p>She was running the tips of her fingers down the side of the desk while
  O'Ryan stood anxiously watching her.</p>

  <p>"I say, wouldn't he make a fuss if he knew you were rummaging about in his
  desk?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly!" she laughed. "He showed me the secret drawer himself.
  There's a spring somewhere just about here."</p>

  <p>There came a click as she spoke, and a small panel in the side of the desk
  flew back, revealing a compartment within.</p>

  <p>"There we are!" exclaimed the girl triumphantly. "There's the secret
  drawer, and I don't mind betting &mdash;" she stooped, thrust in her hand,
  drew out a legal-looking document and stood upright&mdash;"and I don't mind
  betting that this is your lease."</p>

  <p>She unfolded the document and glanced at it. "'Deed Poll,'" she read.
  "What's a Deed Poll, Frank?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said O'Ryan impatiently. "Something you change your name
  by, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Change your name?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Popular device with shady gents," he grinned, "whose real names have
  become a handicap."</p>

  <p>She glanced again at the document, her brows puckered in a frown.</p>

  <p>"'Know all men by these presents,' she read, 'that I, Dennis Selby Clive
  Sanderby, commonly called Dennis Sanderby, will in future be known as Selby
  Clive '"</p>

  <p>She stopped abruptly and stood staring at O'Ryan with bewildered eyes.</p>

  <p>"Frank, what&mdash;does that mean that&mdash;that Selby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Changed his name! Good God, why on earth&mdash;did you know? Did he ever
  tell you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Dennis Sanderby? But why&mdash;I don't understand." O'Ryan took the
  document from her hand.</p>

  <p>"Let's have a look," he said. "What's the date of
  it?&mdash;1913&mdash;twenty years ago, by Jove! Executed at Edmonton on the
  fourth day of March, 1913. Well, I'm damned!"</p>

  <p>Nita's face was grave and her eyes troubled.</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;odd, Frank, isn't it? What made him do that, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"It's certainly queer."</p>

  <p>She took the document, glanced at it again, and then, replacing it in the
  secret drawer, closed the panel.</p>

  <p>"Changed his name," she repeated thoughtfully. "I wonder why he never told
  me that."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you ask him? Hang it, you're his wife, and you've every right
  to know a thing like that. After all, a man doesn't change his name for
  nothing."</p>

  <p>She was shaking her head.</p>

  <p>"If Selby wants to tell me, he'll tell me. I shan't ask."</p>

  <p>"That's for you to decide, of course," said O'Ryan; "but if I were in your
  shoes I'd tackle him about it straight out. Have another look for the lease,
  though, Nita&mdash;just to relieve my mind."</p>

  <p>She appeared not to have heard him. She walked across to the French
  windows.</p>

  <p>"Dennis Sanderby," she repeated. "How very strange! I wonder why he has
  never told me that."</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't carry it about with him, would he?" She glanced around at the
  other as though she had suddenly become aware of his presence.</p>

  <p>"What? Oh, the lease! I really have no idea, Frank. Bother the lease! When
  Selby comes back I'll ask him for it, if you like."</p>

  <p>"No, don't do that, Nita," he said hastily. "I don't want to make it look
  as though I'm using you."</p>

  <p>"Using me?" She laughed. "Frank, you really are the most naive man I've
  ever known. Don't follow me, will you? I want to think."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan smiled.</p>

  <p>"Of me?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I've thought enough of you lately&mdash;too much, perhaps," she said, and
  went out into the garden.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">NITA made her way slowly across the lawn and seated herself
  in a deck chair. "Know all men by these presents that I, Dennis Selby Clive
  Sanderby&mdash;" She seemed still to see the words quite clearly, as if, when
  she had stood staring at the document, they had been photographed onto her
  eyes. Selby had changed his name&mdash;twenty years ago&mdash;long before she
  had ever heard of him&mdash;and he had never said a word to her about it. It
  was&mdash;well, queer, anyway. A man didn't change his name for nothing.
  There must have been some reason&mdash;some very compelling reason&mdash;for
  doing a thing like that. There would be, at any rate, in Selby's case; he did
  nothing without a reason, without having thought it all out, step by step,
  beforehand, in that calculating, unemotional, cold-blooded way of his. And a
  man wouldn't trouble to change his name unless there were attached to the
  name he was abandoning something he was anxious to have forgotten, something
  shameful, something which would injure him if it were associated with his
  name.</p>

  <p>"A popular device with shady gents whose real names have become a
  handicap," Frank had said. Perhaps. But somehow the description did not seem
  to fit Selby. Still, there did seem something shady about it. At the best, it
  was rather a contemptible deception&mdash;foisting yourself on the world as
  someone else, disowning your past, cheating people of their right to judge
  you by your past actions, which were all they had by which to judge you at
  all, deliberately shirking consequences, putting on an overcoat to hide a
  shabby suit. After all, a man couldn't hope to forget his past by changing
  his name; if that were possible the lawyers would have little time for
  anything but preparing the necessary documents. All he could hope for was to
  persuade other people to forget it, or, at any rate, not to think of it in
  connection with him; and why, if there were nothing shady in it, should he
  want to do that?</p>

  <p>She found herself wondering what there had been in Selby's life that had
  made it necessary to change his name, what he could have done that he was so
  anxious to conceal from the world, what action it had been of which he had
  not had the courage to face the consequences. It was all very well to tell
  herself that she could not imagine Selby being guilty of anything
  dishonourable, but in reality she had no very sound reason for saying so. She
  had known him for no more than three years&mdash;only a small fraction of his
  life&mdash;and of his life before she had known him he had told her
  practically nothing. An occasional laughing reference to his mysterious past
  was all she had ever had from him, and she had never ventured to question
  him. She had not, as a matter of fact, ever felt much curiosity about it, and
  had been content to take him very much for granted. Most women, she supposed,
  would have been equally indifferent to his past if they had seen a chance of
  a future which included a share of Selby's income. A woman only insisted on a
  moral character in the man who wanted to marry her when there was nothing
  about his income to attract her. Frank, for instance. If Frank had had
  Selby's income, would she have bolted the door last night? Probably not.
  Frank was probably right&mdash;"Mean little swine!"</p>

  <p>She jerked her thoughts back to her husband. Why hadn't he told her? She
  had thought that he was incapable of a dishonourable action, but surely
  changing his name&mdash;surely it would have been more honourable to tell her
  that he had changed it before asking her to share it? And if he was capable
  of that dishonourable action, of what else might he not have been capable in
  the past&mdash;and of what might he still be capable? It had occurred to her
  vaguely before, but the thought struck her now, with shattering force, that
  she did not know Selby, that to all intents and purposes she had been living
  for the last three years with a stranger of whom she knew but little more now
  than when she had first met him. It seemed suddenly a horrible thing to have
  done. She wished that she had not tampered with that secret drawer.</p>

  <p>And now that she had tampered with it, what was she to do? Tell Selby what
  she had discovered and demand an explanation? She shook her head. She would
  never carry that through successfully. If Selby wanted to tell her, he would
  tell her; if he did not want to tell her, then nobody&mdash;not even
  Muller&mdash;would make him. She wondered if the lawyer knew. Probably. He
  had known Selby for more than twenty years. Perhaps if she tackled Muller ...
  She smiled at that. Muller, however much Selby might be in the wrong, would
  stand by him. Men were like that&mdash;lie like hell to a woman rather than
  let each other down. "Playing the game," they called it....</p>

  <p>Lane, bringing out the tea table and arranging the chairs, disturbed her;
  and as Lane went back to the house she saw O'Ryan coming towards her across
  the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs. Sanderby?" he grinned.</p>

  <p>She frowned.</p>

  <p>"That's rather bad taste, Frank, isn't it?" she said. "It doesn't strike
  me as amusing."</p>

  <p>He flung himself on the grass.</p>

  <p>"That's because you've no sense of humour, darling. I've often told you
  so, haven't I? It strikes me as quite passably funny. Here are you, a nice,
  pure-minded, smug little Puritan with a passion for bolts and the seventh
  commandment, and a holy horror of any other sort of passion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank!"</p>

  <p>"Here you are, being what you are," he went on, "with all the most
  beautiful characteristics of a Sunday-school teacher and the spotless mind of
  a Mother Superior, tied up for life with a bloke who, for all you know, may
  have poisoned his mother, pinched the poor-box, defrauded widows and orphans,
  blackmailed his brother, been arrested in Hyde Park, and generally booted the
  Decalogue to blazes. Excuse a smile, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"You're just&mdash;beastly, Frank."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know what you're telling yourself," he replied: "all that might be
  true of other men, but it couldn't possibly be true of Selby. He's one of the
  nicest men you've ever met, and has all the qualities that any sane woman
  likes. He's so nice that you could quite easily fall in love with him, and,
  that being so, of course he couldn't possibly have poisoned his mother. Good
  God, Nita, why don't you face facts?"</p>

  <p>"Don't I?"</p>

  <p>"No, you do not. You're a rotten little hypocrite, really&mdash;walk right
  up to the fact and then bolt the door against it. That's hypocrisy&mdash;to
  lead a man right up the garden path and then dump him on the rubbish heap and
  go to bed thanking God for helping you to keep yourself pure and holy. You
  make me tired. What are you going to do about it, anyway&mdash;tackle
  him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing?"</p>

  <p>"It's all very well to talk, Frank, but what can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Meet me at the Laffan tonight. Good heavens, it's the only thing to do,
  and you know it, really. You've got to cut adrift now. Nita darling, will
  you? Forget what I've just been saying&mdash;I was only fooling,
  anyway&mdash;and promise that tonight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? The sooner the better."</p>

  <p>"You seem pretty sure about the lease."</p>

  <p>"Well, you say it's signed, and he's almost certain to hand it over to me
  today, and as soon as I've got it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suppose he doesn't hand it over to you today, Frank.
  Still&mdash;tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, in that case, I couldn't You see, Nita, until I've safely
  landed the lease&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>She got up suddenly from her chair.</p>

  <p>"And <i>I'm</i> the hypocrite, am I?" she said, and turned to leave
  him.</p>

  <p>As she did so she realized that her husband was coming up the drive, and
  that with him was Sir Ralph Whitcombe. With a sigh she returned to her
  chair.</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph Whitcombe, K.C., tall, white-haired, dignified, with a ponderous
  manner that somehow conveyed the impression that his most trivial remark was
  backed by all the weight of a House of Lords decision, had probably caused
  more women to sigh at the sight of him than had any other member of his
  profession. Many of them, with less self-control or less politeness than
  Nita, yawned; and it was said among his former colleagues that, since his
  retirement from his practice, he was in constant demand in Harley Street as a
  cure for insomnia.</p>

  <p>But Nita on this occasion had sighed merely from force of habit when she
  saw him coming up the drive with her husband. Actually she was glad to see
  him. Just at the moment she felt that half an hour with Selby and
  O'Ryan&mdash;the three of them together, trying to be natural, pretending
  that everything was normal between them, skating all the time on the thinnest
  ice, was more than she could face. With Sir Ralph there they would all be
  relieved of the necessity&mdash;and the chance&mdash;of talking.</p>

  <p>As the two men came towards her across the lawn, her gaze was fixed on her
  husband. She had a vague, half-formed idea that, now that she had made that
  astonishing discovery about him, he would in some way appear different, that
  she would notice points about him which she had not noticed before, that in
  meeting Dennis Sanderby for the first time she would receive a fresh
  impression, like him or dislike him, be attracted or repelled or indifferent,
  as she would be in meeting any other stranger. Perhaps, now that she knew his
  secret, she might detect some clue, which had passed unheeded before, that
  might lead her to understand why Selby had changed his name, why he had so
  carefully concealed the fact from her, why he had not dared to trust her with
  the knowledge of his past, why he had chosen to masquerade....</p>

  <p>"Here's Whitcombe, my dear."</p>

  <p>She glanced up, smiling.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Sir Ralph?"</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph placed his small leather attach case on a chair, deliberately
  took off his glove and gave her his hand.</p>

  <p>"How d' do, Mrs. Clive?" he said, as if a precise knowledge of her state
  of health were of the most momentous significance. "And how are you, O'Ryan?
  Down here for the week, I presume? I am staying with the
  Boscombes&mdash;rather a noisy lot of young people. They never seem to go to
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought, Sir Ralph," smiled Nita, "that with you staying in
  the house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite; a little inconsiderate. I ventured a mild protest, but it has had
  no effect. They assured me that they were doing their utmost to oblige me by
  falling asleep not later than 10 P.M. but were unable to do so. I have an
  idea, however, that it is a case of insomnia aforethought, with, perhaps, a
  touch of malice."</p>

  <p>Clive waved him to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Jerry will be back tomorrow, Nita," he said. "He's doubtful about getting
  back tonight."</p>

  <p>"That would be the man you had with you?" inquired Sir Ralph. "Quite a
  respectable kind of American, I thought. He did not contradict me once."</p>

  <p>"He's my lawyer&mdash;Jerry Muller&mdash;a Canadian."</p>

  <p>"Really! I once went to Canada&mdash;before I took silk. An interesting
  country, I thought."</p>

  <p>"God's own country," said Clive.</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph raised his bushy eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Indeed? So many of these places are. A deity with a geographical
  bias&mdash;an interesting speculation, perhaps. But I have always said, Mrs.
  Clive, that this country is quite good enough for me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, was it you who said that?" asked Nita innocently.</p>

  <p>"A great friend of yours, I gathered, Clive?"</p>

  <p>"Jerry?" Clive nodded. "Yes, I've every reason for calling Jerry my
  friend, Whitcombe. He saved my life once."</p>

  <p>Nita glanced quickly at him.</p>

  <p>"Saved your life, Selby? But I had no idea&mdash;I mean, how terribly
  romantic!"</p>

  <p>Clive shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing at all romantic about it, my dear," he said. "It was
  all rather&mdash;horrible. I don't care to think about it even now, and it
  happened twenty years ago. It was the sort of nightmare that's best
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>He was silent for some moments, frowning thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"And if they had killed me," he added slowly, speaking, it seemed to Nita,
  more to himself than to the group around him, "I should have got what I
  deserved." He rose suddenly from his chair. "Ready for tea, my dear? I'll
  tell Lane."</p>

  <p>He went off towards the house, and Nita, glancing at O'Ryan, saw his
  rather cynical smile and turned away again. If only she had been alone with
  Selby, she might have taken that chance, asked him to explain, led him,
  perhaps, to tell her about that nightmare in his past which he was anxious to
  forget&mdash;so anxious, she had no doubt, that other people should forget
  that he had changed his name and left Canada&mdash;"God's own country" he had
  called it&mdash;and come to hide himself in England where no one knew him or
  anything about him. He might, perhaps, have given her some explanation which
  would have swept her mind clean of all the doubts and fears and suspicions
  which now lay thick on it; he might have convinced her that, in changing his
  name, and in keeping the fact from her, Selby had been guilty of nothing more
  than indiscretion, of nothing, at any rate, which could undermine her faith
  in him. She realized that she was desperately anxious to be convinced.</p>

  <p>Her gaze had wandered, as it always did when she sat in the garden, to the
  riot of rambler roses, and she was only dimly aware of the sound of Sir
  Ralph's voice as he droned on; and she realized with a start that Lane had
  brought the tea things and that Selby was back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"... I seldom go into court nowadays," Sir Ralph was saying. "I've made
  all I wish to make out of the law, and the bench does not appeal to me. No, I
  am very happy in my work."</p>

  <p>"Sir Ralph writes books now," explained Selby. "I believe I read one of
  them, Whitcombe&mdash;what was it called?"</p>

  <p><i>"An Examination of the Ecclesiastical Laws?"</i> said Sir Ralph. "That
  was one of my less important works&mdash;hardly more than an elementary
  textbook."</p>

  <p>Clive smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it was that. I can't quite see myself buying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You didn't, Selby," said Nita; "Sir Ralph was kind enough to give you a
  copy."</p>

  <p>She had realized that Selby's eyes were watching her with a strange,
  questioning look in them, and made an effort to appear natural.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I read a book of yours, too, Sir Ralph," she added, as she
  busied herself with the tea things. "It was about&mdash;er&mdash;anyway, I
  know I found it terribly fascinating."</p>

  <p>"<i>A Digest of the Law Relating to Canals and Waterways,</i> perhaps,"
  suggested Sir Ralph. "A most interesting subject, Mrs. Clive. I am told that
  it is now recognized as the standard work on the subject."</p>

  <p>Nita shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it was that," she laughed. "Sugar, Sir Ralph?"</p>

  <p>"If you please. No milk."</p>

  <p>"Cream?"</p>

  <p>"That is poison to me."</p>

  <p>"And to Nita," said Clive, "but she hasn't your strength of will,
  Whitcombe, and persists in poisoning herself. Cream is the one thing she
  should never take. The doctor told her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Selby, please!" she interrupted rather wearily. "There's no need to be
  physiological."</p>

  <p>"I am now engaged in the compilation of a much lighter work," continued
  Sir Ralph. <i>"Seventeen Famous Trials,</i> I am calling it. A most absorbing
  study. It is only when one comes to make a study of crime, Mrs. Clive, when
  one starts to probe into the actions of individuals and touch the hidden
  motives, that one begins to realize what tremendous consequences may follow,
  I will not say a wrong action, because we must go further back than that and
  realize that a wrong thought, harboured in the mind for, perhaps, only a few
  seconds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lane, where's the cream? You've forgotten it."</p>

  <p>"He hasn't," Clive told her. "I saw it on the tea tray and removed the
  temptation. If you harbour the thought of cream in your mind only for a few
  seconds, Nita&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nita sighed.</p>

  <p>"Why be so silly, Selby? Fetch the cream, please, Lane."</p>

  <p>The servant went towards the house.</p>

  <p>"He won't find it, Nita. I hid it&mdash;in the dairy."</p>

  <p>"Then don't do it again, Selby, will you? You did it once before, and it
  was rather embarrassing. I'd much rather my digestion wasn't made a tea-table
  topic." Clive got up from his chair.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;if you insist&mdash;I'll get it," he said. "But you know
  it's awfully bad for you. You remember what the doctor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Selby&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders and strode off after Lane. "As I was saying,"
  began Sir Ralph again, "I am finding my <i>Seventeen Famous Trials</i> a most
  absorbing study. At the moment I am dealing with one of the most
  extraordinary crimes&mdash;or, more correctly, series of crimes&mdash;ever
  committed. I have my notes in my case. You would, perhaps, be
  interested&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He picked up his attach case, opened it, and began rummaging inside.
  Nita, watching him, noticed that on top of the papers in the case was a small
  flask-shaped bottle full of some greenish liquid; and Sir Ralph, glancing at
  her as his hand hastily covered it, saw that she had noticed it and held it
  up with a smile for her inspection.</p>

  <p>"Not to be used as evidence against me, Mrs. Clive," he said. "You will
  never guess what this is. Nor you, O'Ryan."</p>

  <p>"Looks like Chartreuse," said O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You'll never guess. It's vodka. I am rather susceptible to chills, and a
  Russian doctor&mdash;a most interesting and intelligent man, I may
  say&mdash;strongly recommended me to try vodka. I must say I have found it
  most efficacious. I never move without it."</p>

  <p>"You mean you drink it?" inquired Nita.</p>

  <p>"In small quantities, Mrs. Clive&mdash;only in extremely small
  quantities," he told her, replacing the bottle in the case and continuing his
  rummaging. "It is a very potent spirit and Ah, here are the notes I was
  mentioning."</p>

  <p>He pulled out a sheaf of papers, placed his attach case at his feet, put
  on his glasses and peered over the top of them, first at Nita and then at
  O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"This&mdash;ah&mdash;is the case," he began. "I may say that in all my
  investigations, which have been not inconsiderable, into the records of
  crime, this particular case has impressed me as being altogether remarkable.
  Remarkable, I mean, for the extraordinary subtlety of the criminal and for
  the coolness and cold-bloodedness with which he carried out
  his&mdash;ah&mdash;his dastardly scheme."</p>

  <p>He glanced up at his audience, was satisfied, apparently, that he held
  their attention, and proceeded.</p>

  <p>"The brief essentials are as follows. A man is married to a woman who has
  a lover. He is a rich man, cultured, charming, incapable, one would say, of a
  dishonourable action; in fact, a gentleman. His wife is under the impression
  that he does not know about her having a lover, but she is mistaken. He does
  know. The woman's mother also knows and connives at the intrigue."</p>

  <p>"It sounds very sordid, Sir Ralph," said Nita, "and very ordinary."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I admit the aptness of both the adjectives&mdash;so far, Mrs. Clive."</p>

  <p>"What happened?" asked O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"They died," said Sir Ralph&mdash;"all three of them: the wife, the lover,
  and the mother&mdash;one by one. And they died at his hands."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan grinned.</p>

  <p>"Thorough sort of bloke, Sir Ralph."</p>

  <p>The older man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Observe the uncanny subtlety of the criminal mind," he went on. "This
  placid man of thirty&mdash;rich, highly respected, with all the outward signs
  of a cultured gentleman&mdash;was the most ingenious murderer. Apparently all
  his victims died natural deaths. The wife was found dead with a broken neck;
  seemingly she had had an accident and fallen out of a window. The lover died
  of anthrax, and there is no doubt whatever that his razor had been doctored.
  The mother-in-law was killed by drinking something that must have been full
  of deadly bacteria."</p>

  <p>"Did they hang him?" inquired O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, no," replied Sir Ralph. "Nothing at all could be proved
  against him. That was where he showed his&mdash;ah&mdash;diabolical
  cleverness. He had warned each one of his victims before witnesses; he had
  warned the wife against the insecurity of the window&mdash;warned the lover
  of the danger of using an old razor&mdash;warned the mother-in-law of the
  risks she ran in drinking unscalded milk, I think it was. That was,
  naturally, a big point in his defense, of which his counsel took full
  advantage. The man practically admitted that he had committed the murders, it
  seems, but it was the law's business to produce the proof of his guilt, and
  the law couldn't do it."</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to remember having read about it, Sir Ralph," said Nita. "Do
  you, Frank?"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You would hardly be interested in such things at that time, Mrs. Clive,"
  smiled Sir Ralph. "It happened twenty years ago. And one is obliged, of
  course, to treat the matter delicately. You see, the man was not convicted. I
  remember that at the time one of the newspapers in Canada&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Canada?"</p>

  <p>"The crime was committed in Canada," explained Whitcombe&mdash;"in
  Edmonton. The man was defended by an extremely clever young lawyer
  named&mdash;by Jove, the same name as that man whom I met just now with your
  husband."</p>

  <p>"Muller?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Muller&mdash;that was the lawyer. I wonder if by any chance
  they are related. He might be able to give me certain information. There are
  one or two points about this Dennis Sanderby case which&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dennis Sanderby?"</p>

  <p>The words came from Nita in little more than a whisper. Once again she
  felt that terrible weakness assail her which she had felt in the office at
  the Laffan; only this time it seemed intensified tenfold. She sat staring at
  Sir Ralph with wide-open, horrified eyes, her hands gripping the arms of the
  wicker chair, her teeth biting into her lip. She wrenched her gaze away from
  Sir Ralph's impassive face and looked at O'Ryan. She saw that his face had
  taken on the colour of chalk.</p>

  <p>"One can't help feeling a certain pity for the woman and her lover,"
  Whitcombe was saying&mdash;he was a very long way off, it seemed to Nita.
  "However much one may censure them, as a strict moralist, for their
  indulgence in such a liaison, one must, as a human being, sympathize with
  them in the terrible position in which they had placed themselves. From the
  moment the husband discovered the intrigue, they were doomed, though they
  were blissfully ignorant of the fate awaiting them. This suave, charming
  gentleman&mdash;who continued as suave and charming as ever&mdash;how could
  they suspect him?"</p>

  <p>Clive, cream jug in hand, was coming across the lawn. Nita watched him
  with fascinated eyes. He was smiling. She had often seen him smile; but this
  time&mdash;if only he would stop smiling! If only he wouldn't be so suave, so
  charming, so much the perfect gentleman! He had probably smiled like that
  when ...</p>

  <p>"They could do nothing to avert their fate," Sir Ralph was saying. "They
  had not the least idea that the husband even suspected an intrigue. He warned
  them, it is true&mdash;always in the presence of witnesses&mdash;but they had
  no reason to see in his warnings anything more than a natural solicitude for
  their safety. They did not attach any unusual importance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Clive paused beside his wife.</p>

  <p>"Here's your cream, my dear," he said. "It's a most dangerous
  beverage&mdash;as far as you are concerned, anyway&mdash;but I suppose you
  must have your own way. But don't say I didn't warn you."</p>

  <p>He stooped over the table, tilted the jug, and was about to pour some
  cream into her cup; but suddenly the cup was covered by Nita's hand&mdash;a
  shaking hand&mdash;and she was shrinking back in her chair, staring up at him
  with panic in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Selby&mdash;thank you&mdash;I don't think I want it&mdash;now." He
  glanced at her, and the slightest frown puckered his forehead. She tried to
  meet his gaze without flinching, tried to smile at him; but the smile was a
  pitiful failure, and as he stood looking at her with those steady,
  questioning eyes of his, her glance wavered and suddenly fell.</p>

  <p>"But, surely, Nita&mdash;after I've fetched it for you. You mustn't take
  too much notice of what I said just now. After all, it's your funeral, isn't
  it? Just a drop?" He waited, with the cream jug still poised above her cup,
  for her reply. She wanted to look at O'Ryan&mdash;desperately&mdash;to see if
  he realized her danger, to let her eyes send him a message that he must come
  to her aid. But she knew that she dared not look at him. She knew that, with
  her husband's eyes watching her, to send that message would be to confess her
  guilt. If only Frank would do something&mdash;say something! He must surely
  understand....</p>

  <p>"Come along, my dear," urged Clive. "After making me tramp all the way to
  the dairy and back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His left hand moved as if about to grasp her wrist and lift her hand from
  her teacup. She felt that if he touched her she would scream. She sprang
  suddenly to her feet and stood, teacup in hand, facing him.</p>

  <p>"Selby, I&mdash;I don't want any cream!" she exclaimed, and her voice held
  a note of hysteria. "I won't have any cream! Why on earth&mdash;you must
  make&mdash;all this stupid fuss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He smiled at her.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, my dear," he said penitently. "I didn't mean to upset you; it
  was stupid of me." He turned from her, and, as she sank back into her chair,
  he strolled across towards O'Ryan. "All the better for you, O'Ryan," he
  smiled; "you can have a double dose. Hold out your cup."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan's cup moved an inch or two back.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, sir, I&mdash;I don't&mdash;don't take cream," he stammered.</p>

  <p>Clive raised his eyebrows and glanced at Sir Ralph. "You seem to have
  converted them both, Whitcombe," he laughed. "What has he been telling you,
  Nita&mdash;how many bacteria can lurk in a teaspoonful of cream?"</p>

  <p>Nita forced herself to smile.</p>

  <p>"You're still being rather ridiculous, Selby, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Well, if Whitcombe has really put you off cream," he said, "he has
  rendered you a very great service." He went to the edge of the lawn, emptied
  the cream jug onto the flower bed, filled it with hot water from the spirit
  kettle, emptied it again, and scraped the soil over the spot with his
  foot.</p>

  <p>"Second thoughts aren't always best, my dear," he laughed, as he returned
  to his chair. "You might have been tempted to change your mind."</p>

  <p>"You make such a fuss about nothing, Selby," replied Nita. "Mustn't I even
  change my mind now? It's dreadful waste&mdash;all that cream on the flower
  bed."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you poisoned just yet, darling," he said, "so we'll let the
  cream kill a few weeds."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE he was fairly launched on a subject, Sir Ralph
  Whitcombe was not easily diverted into any conversational side channel, and
  no sooner had the little breeze over the cream jug subsided than he proceeded
  with his subject.</p>

  <p>"As I was saying, Mrs. Clive," he began, "it will be necessary to exercise
  extreme care and treat the matter with the utmost delicacy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please, Sir Ralph," Nita interrupted, "we won't discuss my digestion any
  more, if you don't mind. Selby makes such a fuss about me, but I do exercise
  extreme care. Have you noticed our ramblers? Lovely, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Charming," agreed Sir Ralph, without looking away from his teacup.
  "Most&mdash;ah&mdash;decorative. I fancy, however, that without stepping
  beyond the bounds of fair comment I can so present the case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"More tea, Sir Ralph?"</p>

  <p>And so it went on&mdash;interminably, it seemed to Nita. Dennis
  Sanderby&mdash;she must not let him talk of Dennis Sanderby. In the first
  rush of panic which swept over her when Sir Ralph had mentioned the name, the
  thought had flashed into her mind that Selby must not know that she was aware
  of the existence of such a man as Dennis Sanderby. At the moment she had not
  known why, but as she grew calmer she saw very clearly that her swift flash
  of intuition had been right. That hideous story&mdash;Selby must get no
  inkling that she had heard of it. His ignorance that she was aware of his
  real identity, and of the incidents which had made him so anxious to conceal
  it, was her greatest safeguard. Something warned her that if Dennis Sanderby
  came to know that she knew him for what he was and realized his intentions,
  the result would be not to make him abandon them but only to make him act the
  more swiftly. And if Sir Ralph, with Selby sitting there, were allowed to
  speak of Dennis Sanderby, she felt that she could not trust either herself or
  O'Ryan to give no sign of what was in their minds. Selby would only have to
  glance at them to realize that somehow they had stumbled on the truth, had
  learned his secret, and understood the danger in which they stood. Sir Ralph
  must somehow be silenced.</p>

  <p>She fought valiantly to silence him, interrupting him time and again as he
  swung back, like the needle of a compass, to his subject, heading him off,
  talking as she had never talked before&mdash;incessantly, rapidly,
  desperately&mdash;pouring out a flood of flippant chatter in the hope that in
  Sir Ralph's mind all thoughts of the Dennis Sanderby case might be drowned in
  it. Once or twice she saw her husband glance at her in obvious surprise, but
  she took no notice. She felt that she must talk and talk and keep on talking,
  that if she paused for a moment Sir Ralph would seize on that moment to blurt
  out some word which would tell Selby all she was so anxious to keep from him.
  If only Frank would help her! But O'Ryan seemed incapable of saying
  anything&mdash;even of looking at her. He sat staring at his teacup,
  frowning. Thinking about the lease, she reflected bitterly&mdash;thinking
  about himself&mdash;leaving her to fight for both of them.</p>

  <p>He must surely realize now that Selby knew&mdash;had known, perhaps, for
  months, had watched the affair from the very beginning, seen it gathering
  impetus&mdash;and waited. She had warned him that that was exactly what Selby
  would do. He had done it before&mdash;twenty years ago&mdash;in Canada, and
  he was doing it again now&mdash;the suave, charming gentleman, attentive,
  considerate, fussing about her health, and all the time coolly and carefully
  and ruthlessly planning her punishment....</p>

  <p>Clive seemed disinclined to be hurried over his tea. Long after the others
  had finished he sat there sipping it, stirring it, asking for a little more
  milk, another lump of sugar; but she did not dare to leave him with Sir Ralph
  and O'Ryan. Sir Ralph, though she had at last steered him onto the safe topic
  of the noisy young people at the Boscombes', might at any moment switch back
  to his <i>Seventeen Famous Trials</i>, and she must stay there to prevent
  him. And as soon as tea was over she must get him to herself and silence him
  for good. She had no idea how it was to be done, but it must be managed
  somehow. Frank, too&mdash;she must talk to Frank. They must come to some
  decision. Thank God she had looked in that secret drawer of Selby's desk!
  Thank God even for Sir Ralph Whitcombe! They knew now where they stood, what
  was threatening them, what sort of a man they had to deal with. Those others,
  perhaps&mdash;twenty years ago&mdash;if they had only realized that they had
  been found out! But, no; she didn't suppose, from what Sir Ralph had said of
  Dennis Sanderby, that knowing would have saved them.</p>

  <p>At last her husband set down his cup, and she got up eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Come and see my catch-pit, Whitcombe," said Selby. "You, too, O'Ryan.
  Jerry says it's entirely wrong, and I'd like your opinion." He turned to
  Nita. "You've seen more than enough of it, my dear," he said. "We'll be back
  in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"I'll come too, Selby," she said.</p>

  <p>They were almost an hour in the lower garden. Sir Ralph, having detected
  some analogy between catch-pits for storm water and canals and waterways,
  prosed on and on; and when at length he went off down the drive with his
  precious attach case, Nita had had no chance of a word with him alone.</p>

  <p>And no sooner had he gone than Frank, avoiding her eyes, pleaded an urgent
  business appointment at Windsor, begged to be excused from dinner, and went
  off in his car. Throughout the evening she wondered about that appointment at
  Windsor. It was a strangely opportune appointment. As likely as not Frank
  would not come back.</p>

  <p>But he was back at ten o'clock&mdash;the man, he said, was away and would
  not be home until tomorrow&mdash;and for an hour the three of them sat in the
  drawing room. Selby seemed immovable tonight. As a rule he went to his study
  promptly on the stroke of ten and remained there for a couple of hours,
  reading and writing, but this evening, though Nita went almost beyond the
  limits of discretion in her efforts to dislodge him, he remained obstinately
  in his chair. And Frank, though she hinted until she dared hint no more that
  she wanted the chance of talking to him, was obdurately unresponsive, and at
  length suddenly bade them good-night and went up to his room.</p>

  <p>And then Selby must needs want her to go with him into the garden. They
  went together onto the terrace, rested their elbows on the parapet, and gazed
  at the moonlit garden. She felt her husband's arm go round her shoulders, and
  it was almost more than she could do to let it rest there, but she gave no
  sign of the wave of repugnance that swept over her except that her fingers
  suddenly crisped.</p>

  <p>It was some moments before Clive spoke.</p>

  <p>"Nita, darling," he said softly, "do you remember &mdash;three years
  ago&mdash;that first night of our honeymoon? It was just like this. The
  moonlight, the terrace of the hotel, the garden&mdash;I shall never forget.
  You were rather afraid of me that night&mdash;very beautifully afraid."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a time, gazing thoughtfully across the garden; and then
  he turned to her again.</p>

  <p>"You're not&mdash;not afraid of me now, my dear?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Silly," she laughed nervously.</p>

  <p>His arm tightened around her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I remember asking you the same question then, Nita," he said, "and you
  made the same reply. 'Silly,' you laughed&mdash;exactly as you did just now.
  And then I remember that I drew you close to me like this&mdash;and kissed
  you like this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She felt herself drawn against him, saw his lips approaching, and
  suddenly, thrusting him from her, she wrenched herself free. She wanted to
  scream, to turn and rush away from him; but somehow she managed to control
  her limbs and to steady her voice.</p>

  <p>"Selby&mdash;please&mdash;I'm sorry, but I'm terribly tired. Good-night!"
  She went swiftly across the terrace, into the house, and up to her
  bedroom.</p>

  <p>She got quickly into bed, switched off the light, and lay there very
  still, rigid, her eyes closed, her fingers tightly gripping the bedclothes,
  her teeth pressed hard against her lower lip. And then suddenly she relaxed
  and buried her face in the pillow.</p>

  <p>Dennis Sanderby&mdash;and that! Dennis Sanderby with his arm around her,
  drawing her close to him, pressing his lips against hers&mdash;wanting her!
  She would have screamed if he had kissed her. Idiotic, but she could not have
  helped it. When she had felt his arm tighten round her and seen the look in
  his eyes as he drew her towards him&mdash;she shuddered. It had been so
  unexpected, so unlike Selby. She had behaved meanly to Selby, but he had
  never complained, had never shown any resentment. He had been hurt, perhaps,
  a little wistful sometimes, but never resentful, never even importunate, and
  certainly never leading her to fear that he might insist on her being less
  mean to him or demand a less one-sided bargain.</p>

  <p>But that had been Selby Clive; and since yesterday Selby Clive had become
  Dennis Sanderby&mdash;to himself, perhaps, no less than to her. Until
  yesterday, whatever he might have suspected, he had no sure proof of anything
  more than an easy-going sort of friendship with, perhaps, the usual harmless
  touch of flirtation, between Frank and her, and he had remained Selby Clive.
  But now, if Muller or the manager of the Laffan had told him, he had proof
  enough and to spare; and Selby Clive had become Dennis
  Sanderby&mdash;charming, suave, as much the gentleman as ever, but coolly,
  calmly, with diabolical subtlety, plotting the punishment of his unfaithful
  wife and her lover. And suppose ...</p>

  <p>As the thought struck her she suddenly sat upright in bed, staring with
  horrified eyes into the darkness. Suppose, before he punished her, he should
  decide&mdash;had, perhaps, already decided&mdash;that she should no longer be
  allowed to be a mean little swine, that the bargain must be less one-sided?
  Suppose he made up his mind that, before breaking his plaything, he might
  just as well get a little amusement from it? That would be exactly what was
  to be expected from a Dennis Sanderby&mdash;torture and then the sacrifice,
  degradation and then the knife-thrust. Tonight, on the terrace, she had had a
  hint of what she might expect, and the next time, no doubt, he would not be
  content to let her thrust him from her and bid him good-night. Suppose he
  should decide ...</p>

  <p>She slipped out of bed, groped her way to the door, fumbled for the bolt,
  found it, and pushed it silently across.</p>

  <p>As she turned to make her way back to the bed, she paused abruptly and
  stood motionless, listening. Selby&mdash;coming up the stairs. She heard him
  switch off the light on the landing and come slowly along the corridor. She
  heard his footsteps pass his own room and pause outside her door, and caught
  her breath sharply. There came a tap&mdash;very soft&mdash;at her door. She
  did not move; she stood there rigid, staring towards the door, holding her
  breath. Another tap, and then she heard the handle turned, and her nails dug
  deeply into her palms. Suppose he asked her to open the door....</p>

  <p>"Nita!"</p>

  <p>She could not answer.</p>

  <p>"Awake, Nita? Good-night, my dear!"</p>

  <p>She made a tremendous effort.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Selby."</p>

  <p>"Are you in bed?"</p>

  <p>"Silly," she called. "Of course. Good-night, Selby."</p>

  <p>He went slowly back along the corridor, and she heard his door closed.</p>

  <p>She got back into bed. She saw quite clearly now what she must do. She
  must go&mdash;leave Selby. If only she had not come back this morning! Serve
  her right, perhaps, for being a smug little Puritan. She supposed she was. It
  looked as though she had no idea of playing fair with a man, anyway. Selby
  and Frank&mdash;she had treated them both pretty badly, let them both down.
  It would be her own fault entirely if neither of them wanted her now. But she
  must leave Selby. This afternoon she had known, after the incident with the
  cream jug, that she would have to go now. Frank, after all, would get his own
  way; he was in a position now to dictate his own terms, and she had no choice
  but to accept them. She should have gone tonight&mdash;gone with him to
  Windsor and stayed away; but she had not thought of that. But she must go in
  the morning&mdash;first thing&mdash;before Selby was about. There was no time
  to be lost; another scene like tonight's on the terrace, and she would not
  answer for what she might say or do. She must slip away before such another
  scene could occur, before Selby realized that she had discovered his secret,
  before it was too late ever to get away. Frank must take her in his
  car&mdash;first thing in the morning. Somehow she must let him know. She had
  had no chance to talk to him tonight, and she might have no chance in the
  morning. Besides, Frank had never been known to appear for breakfast before
  ten o'clock, and they must be gone long before that. She must speak to him
  somehow tonight....</p>

  <p>For a moment she thought of knocking at his door and telling him to dress
  and meet her in the garden, but she instantly dismissed the idea. Frank's
  room was opposite to Selby's, and she could hardly knock without Selby
  hearing. Perhaps if she wrote a note and slipped it under Frank's door? But
  she dismissed that, too. She must speak to him, make him realize that there
  was no time to be lost, that she was terrified, that she was relying on him
  to get her away beyond the reach of Dennis Sanderby, and she could not trust
  a scribbled note. He might not find it until the morning.</p>

  <p>Again she sat upright. The telephone. There was an instrument in every
  bedroom&mdash;thank God for Selby's thoroughness!&mdash;and the switchboard
  was in Lane's room. If she could slip downstairs, switch the telephone
  through from her room to Frank's ... It was the only way. Perhaps they could
  leave tonight... .</p>

  <p>She got out of bed again, slipped on her dressing gown and slippers,
  noiselessly drew back the bolt and opened the door. She stepped outside and
  glanced along the dark corridor. There was no sign of a light in her
  husband's room, but a thin bright line showed beneath O'Ryan's, and a faint
  smell of Turkish cigarettes told her that he was still awake. Good! The
  merest tinkle of the telephone bell would be enough.</p>

  <p>Very cautiously she tiptoed along the corridor, just touching the wall
  with the tips of her fingers. She dared not switch on a light, and it would
  never do to stumble. It was one of Selby's boasts that if a fly settled on
  the house at night he would hear its footsteps and wake.</p>

  <p>Her hand, traveling waist high along the wall, found a gap. Frank's door.
  She paused for a moment, groping for the guidance of the wall again. Her
  fingers touched something&mdash;smooth, cold&mdash;and there came a slight
  click. The door-handle. Clumsy! And then, just as she found the wall again,
  the door of Frank's room was opened, a flood of light poured into the
  corridor, and Frank, resplendent in a dressing gown of florid design, was
  staring at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Nita&mdash;you!" he whispered. "I heard something&mdash;touch my
  door."</p>

  <p>"Frank, I&mdash;I must talk to you&mdash;now&mdash;before
  tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He opened the door a little wider, stood aside, and signaled to her to go
  in.</p>

  <p>"Quick, Nita!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>He grasped her arm and tried to draw her in.</p>

  <p>"It's perfectly safe. We can talk in here, and I promise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She wrenched her arm free.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Frank, don't be a fool!"</p>

  <p>She caught a sound behind her, spun round, and saw the door of her
  husband's room open and Clive standing in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;it's all right, Selby."</p>

  <p>He glanced from her to Frank, then back at her.</p>

  <p>"I saw the light&mdash;under my door," he said. "Is there
  anything&mdash;wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;of course," Nita told him hastily. "Frank was
  awake&mdash;smoking&mdash;and he heard someone passing along the corridor,
  and as he had run out of matches&mdash;see?"</p>

  <p>Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've a box here I can spare you, O'Ryan," he said, took a box from the
  pocket of his dressing gown, and tossed it across to him.</p>

  <p>"Thanks very much, sir."</p>

  <p>"But a man who sits up to this hour of the night for the sole purpose of
  smoking Turkish cigarettes deserves all he gets, you know. I'd cut it out if
  I were you. But I expect it's too late to start reforming now."</p>

  <p>Nita could not repress a start.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what do you mean, Selby&mdash;'too late'?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"He's probably been doing this sort of thing all his life, my dear," he
  laughed, "and he probably couldn't stop if he tried. Good-night, O'Ryan."</p>

  <p>"Good-night, sir; good-night, Nita," replied O'Ryan, and his door
  closed.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Selby&mdash;sorry I disturbed you," said Nita, and moved
  towards her door.</p>

  <p>He laid a hand on her arm.</p>

  <p>"Nita?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Where were you going?" He spoke very quietly, very gravely.</p>

  <p>"I was restless, Selby. I was going downstairs for something to read. But
  I don't think I'll bother. I'm really dreadfully tired."</p>

  <p>"Is that the truth, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it's the truth!" she exclaimed irritably. "Where do you suppose
  I was going&mdash;to a secret meeting with Lane?"</p>

  <p>"I only wondered, my dear. I wondered whether&mdash;you might have been
  coming&mdash;to me."</p>

  <p>She drew back from him.</p>

  <p>"Book, dear&mdash;I told you&mdash;downstairs," she said nervously.
  "Good-night, Selby."</p>

  <p>She sped back to her room, bolted the door and got into bed. He hadn't
  believed her. Frank and she&mdash;-together&mdash;at the door of Frank's
  room&mdash;Matches! When Frank had a lighted cigarette between his lips. "Too
  late to start reforming now." Of course he hadn't believed her. Why on earth
  had Frank opened his door? If Dennis Sanderby required further proof, he had
  it now&mdash;the evidence of his own eyes. She must get away&mdash;first
  thing in the morning&mdash;before he had a chance.... It was almost dawn
  before she fell asleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">NITA was calmer the next morning. She awoke at eight o'clock
  and spent half an hour before she dressed smoking a cigarette and trying to
  reason things out. She must not, she decided, allow herself to be stampeded
  into doing anything rashly. She had been foolish last night; it would have
  been much wiser to wait until this morning, and that awkward encounter with
  Selby in the corridor might have had serious consequences. It might still
  have serious consequences. She was not at all sure that Selby had believed
  the explanation which she had given him. He had asked her if it was true, and
  it was unlike Selby to doubt her word. But she saw now that, whatever she
  might decide to do&mdash;and she could decide nothing until she had had an
  opportunity of talking to O'Ryan&mdash;she must do it deliberately, seeing
  clearly ahead what the results would be, and not allow panic to rush her into
  some fatal mistake.</p>

  <p>After all, Selby might suspect nothing. Yesterday she had taken it for
  granted that he had somehow come to hear that she had been at the Laffan with
  Frank; in the state of mind she was in yesterday there had seemed no other
  explanation. But she had, perhaps, jumped to conclusions too hastily. It was
  so easy, when your conscience was not quite clear, to imagine things, to read
  a meaning into words which was never intended, to work yourself up into a
  terrible panic, and then find that all the time there had been no cause for
  alarm. The telephone call to the hotel <i>might</i> have been a lucky guess
  on Selby's part. Muller, with his ambiguous remarks, <i>might</i> not have
  meant her to take them in any but their commonplace meaning; Selby's
  questioning of Frank about his movements on the previous evening, and his
  constant references to the Laffan Hotel, <i>might</i> have been nothing more
  than ordinary conversation. It was difficult to say anything nowadays which
  could not be twisted into meaning something different from what was intended.
  In any case, it was absurd to jump to the conclusion that Selby did know. At
  the best, he knew nothing; at the worst, there was no more than the
  possibility that he might know something.</p>

  <p>There still remained Dennis Sanderby. But if Dennis Sanderby did not
  suspect her, she was in no danger. She might be shocked&mdash;as she
  was&mdash;at the knowledge that for three years she had been the wife of a
  man who actually, if not legally, was guilty of murder; she might
  feel&mdash;as she certainly did&mdash;that she could not possibly continue to
  live with him; but she had no cause for fearing him any more than she had
  feared him during the past three years. And if she feared him, he must never
  be allowed to know of her fear.</p>

  <p>Outwardly she was her usual self when she went downstairs to breakfast;
  outwardly, too, she could detect no difference in Selby. Only O'Ryan seemed
  uneasy, restless, inclined to be irritable; and no sooner was breakfast over
  than he announced that he was off at once to Windsor in his car and would not
  be back until lunch time.</p>

  <p>"Why not go with him, Nita?" suggested her husband. "I've some writing to
  do this morning, and if Frank has not already had too much of your
  company&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She noticed that O'Ryan frowned, but he murmured his willingness to take
  her; and a quarter of an hour later his Welsh-Willis two-seater was roaring
  along the road towards Windsor.</p>

  <p>For some time neither of them spoke. Then: "Frank!"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering."</p>

  <p>"Wondering what?"</p>

  <p>"Whether you really have to go to Windsor, or were just hoping to make a
  good get-away."</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said drily.</p>

  <p>"You didn't invite me to come with you, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Be reasonable," he exclaimed. "How could I invite you? What would Selby
  have thought?"</p>

  <p>"But Selby himself suggested that I should come with you.</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Frank curtly; "I'm wondering why." He drove on for some
  distance and then suddenly pulled in to the side of the road and brought the
  car to a standstill.</p>

  <p>"Won't you be late&mdash;for your appointment&mdash;at Windsor?"</p>

  <p>"Damn Windsor!" he exclaimed viciously. "There is no appointment: I saw
  the man last night. He had promised me three thousand pounds for the
  syndicate, and now he has backed out. Just my luck! As if I hadn't got
  worries enough, without being let down right and left."</p>

  <p>"Then this morning&mdash;it was a get-away? Sorry to have intruded."</p>

  <p>"There's no need to be offensive about it." His tone was surly. "It wasn't
  a get-away; I intended being back for lunch, as I said. But if you expected
  me to stick a whole morning in that infernal house, with that damned murderer
  watching everything I did Good God, Nita, I suppose you realize, don't
  you?&mdash;Selby knows!"</p>

  <p>"Does he?" She said it very calmly. Frank was excited&mdash;almost
  panic-stricken&mdash;she told herself, and she must somehow manage to keep
  calm. Someone must be able to think clearly.</p>

  <p>"Of course he knows. If you've been persuading yourself that he
  doesn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to think things out clearly," she said, "without
  persuading myself of anything. Selby <i>may</i> know, but I'm not at all
  certain that he does. It's so easy to imagine things."</p>

  <p>"I'm not imagining Dennis Sanderby. There's no doubt about that, anyway.
  Just as well you went routing about in his desk, or we might never have
  realized what we were up against. And then old Whitcombe coming out like that
  with the whole ghastly story&mdash;you don't doubt that, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"But there's no reason, Frank, if he doesn't suspect us, why Dennis
  Sanderby, even if everything Sir Ralph told us about him is true,
  should&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he's doing it! He does suspect. It's as clear as daylight.
  Yesterday&mdash;at tea&mdash;that cream jug. You thought he suspected then,
  didn't you? You went as white as a sheet when he tried to make you have some
  cream. You knew as well as I did what he was up to. Just what old Whitcombe
  had been saying about him&mdash;warned you first that cream was a dangerous
  beverage, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But we don't know, Frank, for certain that the cream&mdash;that there was
  anything wrong&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We know enough to satisfy me, anyway," O'Ryan interrupted. "And we know
  he was mighty careful to empty the cream away, don't we? If that's not
  evidence, I don't know what is. And what about the catch-pit? Perhaps you've
  forgotten that?"</p>

  <p>She glanced at him, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Frank, you don't think that&mdash;that the catch-pit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I do think," said O'Ryan. "Catch-pit&mdash;for storm
  water! From what old Whitcombe said&mdash;you heard him yourself&mdash;a kid
  could have made a better job of it. It wasn't intended for storm water,
  that's why. It was intended for you to fall in and break your neck. Didn't he
  warn you not to go into the lower garden?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. There was fear in her eyes again now.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I never thought&mdash;I didn't connect the catch-pit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you aren't certain that he suspects! Get it into your head, my dear,
  that Selby Clive is Dennis Sanderby, and that Dennis Sanderby is a criminal
  lunatic who has decided that there's something between you and me. After last
  night, can you wonder? If he didn't suspect before, you did your best to make
  him then, didn't you? That was just damn silly, Nita. Damned inconsiderate,
  too. If you had changed your mind again, you might have thought twice
  before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I hadn't changed my mind."</p>

  <p>"Then where was the sense in fooling around my door at one o'clock in the
  morning? <i>I</i> might believe that you had only come to say you thought it
  was going to be fine tomorrow, and that it was just another instance of your
  beautiful, childlike innocence&mdash;heaven knows I've reason to believe
  it!&mdash;but you could hardly expect your husband to be quite so credulous.
  He wasn't, either. He didn't believe a word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She cut him short with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"The point is, Frank, what are we going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I know what I'm going to do: I'm not staying in the same house as Dennis
  Sanderby a second longer than I can help. It makes me sweat to think of it!
  I'm getting that lease at the first possible moment, and then I'm clearing
  out."</p>

  <p>"And leaving me here&mdash;to face the music?"</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, Nita, don't make things more difficult than they are
  by being awkward. What can I do? I can't do more than I've already suggested.
  The moment I've got the lease I'll go, and you can follow me."</p>

  <p>"Run away from him?"</p>

  <p>He made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, what else can you do? You can't stay on here. It isn't
  safe, apart from anything else. When you're up against a criminal lunatic
  like Dennis Sanderby, there's only one thing to do&mdash;bolt. You know I'm
  right."</p>

  <p>"I thought so yesterday," she admitted, "but I'm not so sure about it now.
  We don't know for certain that he even suspects; but if we run away&mdash;"
  She shrugged.</p>

  <p>"We couldn't tell him more plainly that his suspicions are right, could
  we?"</p>

  <p>"We should be out of his reach, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Should we?" She shook her head. "If you think that, you don't know much
  about Selby. Running away wouldn't stop him. If Selby once makes up his mind
  to do a thing, he won't rest until he has done it. If he didn't know where we
  were, he would just start systematically looking for us, and it would be no
  use hoping that he would give up looking before he found us. And he would
  find us one day. There's something terribly inevitable about Selby. I've a
  feeling that, if he has made up his mind to&mdash;get rid of us, we shan't be
  in any more danger here than elsewhere. You might just as well stay on at
  Sunningbourne Lodge and be put out without tiring yourself out first by
  running away."</p>

  <p>"Nita, for God's sake! How can you be so callous about it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not," she told him. "But it's no use making a face over your
  medicine. Where Selby is concerned I've learnt that it saves a lot of useless
  effort to give way to him."</p>

  <p>"If you're suggesting that I should hang around and be bumped off by a
  murderous madman for something I haven't done&mdash;it isn't just!"</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"You're rather delicious, Frank," she said. "I suppose your conscience is
  absolutely clear?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't it be? I've done Selby no harm."</p>

  <p>"Well, mine's not," she told him; "and after all, it was I who shot the
  bolt. Blessed be bolts, for they deliver us from temptation and keep us pure
  as the driven snow, so that when we go to bed at night we can thank God that
  we have never stolen another man's wife!"</p>

  <p>He jammed his foot savagely on the self-starter.</p>

  <p>"If I could only lay hands on that lease, I'd be out of the house in five
  minutes. But until I get it, I suppose the only thing is to hang on and risk
  it."</p>

  <p>"And you really think that Selby will give you the lease&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>He frowned at that.</p>

  <p>"It's just that that's worrying me. But you never know. I mean, if he's
  got anything at the back of his mind, he won't want to rouse my suspicions,
  and he might hand over the lease to&mdash;well, sort of keep on friendly
  terms, mightn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He might; I suppose if he&mdash;I mean, if anything happened to you,
  Frank&mdash;the land would be his again and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I say, my dear," he interrupted; "it has just occurred to me. The lease
  is signed&mdash;he told you so&mdash;and it must be somewhere about, and you
  must know where he'd be likely to put it, and if you could find it and hand
  it over, I could clear off at once. London would be best. You could shove a
  few things in a bag and come along, too."</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"It's not very&mdash;dignified&mdash;sneaking out of the back
  door...."</p>

  <p>He gave an exasperated sigh.</p>

  <p>"You're the queerest woman I've ever struck. Who cares a hang about
  dignity? When you're running away from a madman with a chopper you can't stop
  to powder your nose. And Dennis Sanderby is a madman." Still she
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Scuttling away&mdash;like a couple of frightened rabbits," she said. "If
  I'm going, I'd rather&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Face him and tell him so? A fine dramatic scene and a good strong line
  for the heroine as she sweeps haughtily from the room?" He shook his head.
  "Not for me, anyway, thank you. If Selby knows that we're going to make a
  bolt for it, you don't suppose he'll stand at the door and wave good-bye to
  us, do you? If we're going, we've got to get away before he has a chance to
  prevent us. And the sooner the better, because God knows what he may try on
  us next. If you can only find that lease! You'll try, Nita, won't you?"</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"All right, Frank; I'll try," she agreed.</p>

  <p>Relief showed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I say, that's frightfully sporting of you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't feel a bit sporting," she interrupted curtly. "I feel&mdash;oh,
  well, it doesn't matter. You'd better drive back now. Selby will probably be
  in the garden, and it's up to you to keep him there while I&mdash;do the
  pilfering. When a woman steals from her husband, what do they call it? Is it
  burglary or larceny or theft or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, forget it!" he said impatiently. "You're terribly unfair, you know.
  After all, I want the lease as much for your sake as mine. You know that,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly but did not reply.</p>

  <p>He let in the clutch and turned the car.</p>

  <p>Nita, as the car roared along the road, sat frowning thoughtfully at the
  needle of the speedometer: twenty&mdash;twenty-five&mdash;thirty&mdash;she
  supposed there was no other way out of it; she must leave Selby and go with
  Frank&mdash;thirty-five&mdash;Funny that she should be hesitating now.</p>

  <p>She had been in a panic to get away last night, and now, when Frank
  suggested it, she wasn't at all sure. They were doing forty now. Frank was in
  a dreadful hurry to get his lease and be off. There was that black dispatch
  box in the library; she had often seen Selby put papers tied with red tape
  into the dispatch box. Perhaps she had better look there first. Forty-five
  now, and the needle was still creeping round the dial. A terrible noise the
  exhaust was making. She never had understood why a sports car must always
  have such an ear-splitting exhaust. Fifty-two now. The speedometer was only
  marked up to eighty. Suppose you went ninety&mdash;what would the speedometer
  do? It would be strange with Frank at first. A little flat somewhere, she
  supposed&mdash;furnished. But she could pack away everything she didn't
  like....</p>

  <p>She felt the car give a sudden lurch, heard Frank's muttered, "My God!"
  heard the screaming of brakes, felt the car slithering sickeningly sideways,
  glanced up, saw a tree sweep past, terribly close to her face, and the next
  instant she was flung violently forward.</p>

  <p>She righted herself, gripping the side of the car, and glanced around. The
  machine, she realized, had stopped, though the engine still roared; but it
  was tilted perilously, with two wheels in the ditch and its radiator touching
  the hedge. Frank, very white, was still clutching the wheel with hands that
  shook violently.</p>

  <p>"Frank, what&mdash;what happened?"</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at her.</p>

  <p>"You're not hurt?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Scared, that's all. That tree&mdash;I thought we'd hit it. Phew!" She
  closed her eyes for a moment, resting her elbows on her knees and covering
  her face with her hands.</p>

  <p>"You're sure you're all right?"</p>

  <p>She nodded and sat upright.</p>

  <p>"Give me a cigarette." When he had lighted it for her: "What was
  it&mdash;a skid?"</p>

  <p>"Steering, by the feel of it," he told her. "She suddenly started swerving
  all over the place&mdash;wouldn't answer the wheel and Thank God, I had good
  brakes! We were doing nearly sixty. I can't understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He got out, walked to the front of the car, went down on one knee and
  peered underneath.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he breathed.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>He stood upright and walked back to the side of the car, frowning.</p>

  <p>"According to all the rules of the game," he said, "we should both be
  dead."</p>

  <p>She shrugged.</p>

  <p>"We're not, anyway. At least, I don't think so, but you never know. They
  say that lots of people, when they're killed suddenly, don't realize that
  they are dead. Funny if we are dead, eh, Frank? It would be rather a relief
  really, wouldn't it? I mean, we shouldn't have to worry any more about Selby
  or the lease or the Laffan Hotel or Dennis Sanderby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pull yourself together, Nita, and don't talk rot," he interrupted
  sharply. "We're not dead. The steering went wrong. There's a bolt missing.
  How the deuce it got loose I can't think. It's damned queer. My God!" he
  exclaimed suddenly. "We ought to be dead&mdash;I see it now&mdash;that
  swine&mdash;he meant us to be dead&mdash;meant us to be smashed
  up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank!"</p>

  <p>"Who suggested you should come with me, Nita? Selby, didn't he? Because he
  knew what was going to happen, because he had arranged that it should happen,
  because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank, you're crazy!"</p>

  <p>"Am I? Listen! That bolt&mdash;it couldn't have got loose &mdash;not in
  ten years&mdash;unless it had been tampered with. But it had been tampered
  with&mdash;by that murderous swine. I remember now: he was in the garage this
  morning when I went to get the car out&mdash;tinkering with his car, he said.
  He seemed a bit startled when I went in&mdash;said he hadn't thought we'd be
  starting quite so soon&mdash;and then he began talking about my
  bus&mdash;said he didn't care much for the Welsh-Willis cars&mdash;didn't
  like their steering. He had heard of several cases where the steering had
  gone wrong, and advised me to keep my eye on it. I thought nothing of it at
  the time&mdash;I was too anxious to get away to pay much attention to what he
  was saying, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean that he&mdash;warned you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Just the same as he warned his wife and his mother-in-law and his wife's
  lover, the same as he warned you yesterday about the catch-pit and the
  cream."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now don't start trying to kid yourself that it was an accident. It
  wasn't, and you know it as well as I do, but just because you're his wife
  you've the idiotic idea that you must try to believe the best of
  him&mdash;even when he's doing his best to murder you. The sooner you make up
  your mind that Dennis Sanderby is a cold-blooded murderer, who has killed
  three people already and means to kill us, the better it will be for you. For
  two pins I'd go straight to the police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're rattled, Frank. You must be&mdash;badly&mdash;when you talk like
  that. How could you go to the police?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course&mdash;I know that. All the same, going back to that house
  ... if it weren't for the lease ... I've half a mind to drop the whole
  business and clear out now. But how the deuce can I? For heaven's sake, Nita,
  see if you can find it and let's clear off at once, before he tries anything
  else. I can't stand much more of this sort of thing. It makes me sweat to
  think what might have happened&mdash;what he intended to happen."</p>

  <p>"But it <i>might</i> only have been an accident," she interrupted. "You're
  rattled&mdash;so am I&mdash;and it's easy to imagine things. After all, it's
  not the first time the steering of a car has gone wrong."</p>

  <p>"Oh, rot!" snapped O'Ryan. "You know it's rot." She was very thoughtful as
  they walked back to Sunningbourne Lodge.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">CLIVE was in the library when they got back to Sunningbourne
  Lodge. They could see him, as they crossed the lawn, seated at his desk, and
  Nita paused and laid a hand on O'Ryan's arm.</p>

  <p>"Pull yourself together, Frank, for heaven's sake," she said. "If Selby is
  really trying&mdash;I mean, if he did take that bolt out of the
  car&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's no 'if' about it, Nita. Look at the man&mdash;sitting there as
  calmly as you like&mdash;waiting to hear that we've been smashed to bits.
  It's&mdash;it's inhuman. For two pins I'd go in and tell him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you know he's Dennis Sanderby?" said Nita. "That you know he's
  trying to murder you, that you know he tried to break my neck with his
  catch-pit, and to poison us both with the cream, and to smash us up this
  morning in the car?" She shook her head. "You won't do that&mdash;for several
  reasons. For one thing, you haven't the pluck. Sorry, Frank, but I can't
  somehow see you facing Selby across that desk and accusing him of attempted
  murder. You see, if it isn't true&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He made a gesture of impatience, but she took no notice.</p>

  <p>"I'm not saying it isn't true," she went on. "I'm as scared as you are,
  really, but I'm trying not to get in a panic about it. All I'm saying is
  that, if it weren't true, and you strode into the library and confronted him
  and accused him of having tried to kill you&mdash;well, I know just what
  Selby would do. He'd stare at you, quite calm and undisturbed, and say: 'Why
  should I want to kill you, O'Ryan?' And of course, if it weren't true, you
  couldn't possibly tell him why you thought he wanted to kill you, because, if
  you told him that, you'd be giving him a perfectly good reason for wanting to
  kill you, and he'd be quite likely to start getting busy about it there and
  then."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what's the use of arguing?" he exclaimed impatiently. "All we've got
  to think about is getting that confounded lease and clearing out at
  once."</p>

  <p>"And if it is true," she went on, "and he really does mean to kill you,
  you'd only be making everything much more awkward. If he knew that you'd
  discovered what he was trying to do, he wouldn't stop trying to do it; he'd
  just do it all the sooner&mdash;before you could get away&mdash;and be quite
  sure that there was no hitch next time. It's no use letting him see that
  you're scared, anyway. He may only be trying, after all, to scare you
  away&mdash;to make you clear off and have nothing more to do with me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, talk sense, Nita! If he only wanted to scare me off he wouldn't offer
  me poisoned cream, and he wouldn't try to smash us both up. You seem to
  forget that we're both in this. You're in just as much danger as I am."</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't forgotten that, Frank," she said. "I'm only just trying to
  calm you down a bit before we go indoors and see him. Feeling better? Now
  somehow, if I'm to find that lease, we've got to get him out of the house,
  and it'll be up to you to keep him out. The longer the better. If I manage to
  find it I'll come out at once."</p>

  <p>She saw Clive glance up from his writing, rise from his chair, and come
  sauntering towards them, puffing his pipe, across the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Back already?" he said. "I hardly expected you so soon."</p>

  <p>"We've had a smash, Selby," interrupted Nita. "At least, we nearly had a
  smash. The car's in a terrible mess, anyway."</p>

  <p>"You're not hurt, Nita?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" exclaimed her husband fervently. "Nor you,
  O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"Frank's all right," Nita told him. "He's a bit shaken&mdash;naturally. So
  am I. It was just as we were coming down the hill. I thought we'd hit the
  tree and&mdash;phew! I don't know how we missed it. You can thank Frank,
  Selby, that you've still got a wife."</p>

  <p>He glanced at O'Ryan with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for my wife, O'Ryan," he said. "I needn't tell you how grateful
  I am for what you've done, need I?"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan's eyes searched his face.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir," he said, as casually as he could. "After all, in
  a case like that, one acts from sheer instinct. Luckily, I did the right
  thing."</p>

  <p>Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"Instinct? Yes, I suppose so&mdash;to some extent. But it isn't every man
  who has an instinct to do the right thing. It may seem a little unfair,
  because a man, I suppose, is not altogether responsible for his instincts,
  but if his instinct urges him to do a wrong thing he usually has to suffer
  for it."</p>

  <p>"Selby," began Nita, "we don't really feel like listening to a lecture on
  psychology."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, my dear. Prosing again, was I? What happened, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"The steering," said O'Ryan. "Quite suddenly&mdash;as we were going down
  the hill&mdash;the steering failed. We were doing nearly sixty at the
  time."</p>

  <p>Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then you've really no right to be alive, either of you," he said. "I
  never did like the steering of the Welsh-Willis. I told you so, O'Ryan,
  didn't I? This isn't the first accident due to faulty steering."</p>

  <p>"Accident!" exclaimed O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>Nita glanced at him quickly. His lips were working; his hands clenched,
  and he was staring at Selby with eyes that were suddenly blazing with hatred.
  He surely wasn't going to be fool enough&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Accident!" he repeated in a queer, strained voice.</p>

  <p>"It was no more an accident&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank, don't be so stupid!" Nita cut in sharply. "Of course it was an
  accident; what else could it be?" She turned to her husband and hurried on.
  "Frank's all shaken up, Selby," she explained, "and won't have it that it was
  an accident. Not&mdash;not an ordinary sort of accident, I mean. He says it
  was&mdash;carelessness. The garage people can't have put one of the bolts in
  properly, and Frank says that's criminal carelessness."</p>

  <p>She waved a hand towards the deck chairs on the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Frank," she said, "and keep quiet for a bit. You've had a nasty
  shock, but you'll soon feel better. Selby will stay and talk to you; you can
  tell him when I'm out of earshot just what you think of the garage
  people."</p>

  <p>Clive took the younger man by the arm and led him towards the chairs.</p>

  <p>"Take it easy for a bit, O'Ryan," he said. "I'm not surprised that you're
  feeling rather rocky. From all you've told me, I fancy you've both been as
  near to death as you ever will be." He took out his cigarette case, opened
  it, and held it towards O'Ryan as he sprawled in a chair. "You smoke too
  much, you know," he laughed, "and it's a bad habit. But you've deserved a
  smoke this morning."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan's hand went towards the case; and then it suddenly paused, and he
  sat for several seconds staring at the case, frowning, as though he suspected
  that if he touched it, it would sting him.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, sir, but I won't smoke," he said, and thrust his hand into his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>With a shrug, Clive turned to Nita.</p>

  <p>"You, Nita?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"My own specials," he told her. "Very strong and very bad for you, but one
  of them would calm your nerves."</p>

  <p>She shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"They're poison, Selby," she laughed. "You've often told me so. I'm going
  up to my room for a bit. Take care of Frank, won't you?"</p>

  <p>She went into the house and up to her bedroom. She took off her hat, spent
  some minutes at her dressing table. She could not rely on O'Ryan, she felt,
  to occupy Selby for very long; he was far too frightened for her to be able
  to depend on him for anything. She was frightened herself&mdash;frightened of
  Selby, of Muller, of Lane, and very frightened of Dennis Sanderby. She was
  afraid to stay on at Sunningbourne Lodge, yet afraid of what the future might
  hold for her if she left it. Two days ago she had felt that she could not
  face a future in which Frank O'Ryan had no place, and the feeling that she
  would be injuring her husband had been swamped by the thoughts of the
  happiness which was going to be hers. But Frank, when they were having dinner
  together at the Laffan, had suddenly dispersed the haze of glamour through
  which she had been viewing the future and made her see clearly what lay
  ahead. And the landscape had been so different from the fairyland to which
  she had imagined that Frank would take her that she had faltered and turned
  back. Once or twice, since her return, she had faintly regretted that she had
  not mustered up the courage to hide her disappointment and go on. The
  landscape, perhaps, might have proved more attractive on closer inspection;
  life with Frank, she had felt, even on his terms, could scarcely be less
  attractive than life at Sunningbourne Lodge.</p>

  <p>But the regrets had only been vague regrets&mdash;shadows that passed over
  her mind so swiftly that she was scarcely aware of them, and the more she
  realized that circumstances were forcing her towards a future which included
  Frank and excluded Selby, the more reluctant she became to set out on that
  road. Shocked as she had been by the discovery that she was the wife of
  Dennis Sanderby, and realizing, as she did more and more clearly, that her
  only safe plan was to leave Sunningbourne Lodge at once, she caught herself
  remembering not so much her horror of Dennis Sanderby and the danger which
  threatened her as her admiration for Selby Clive and the sense of security
  which he had brought to her. There would be no sense of security with Frank,
  no relying on him as she had come to rely on Selby. Life with Frank would be
  a risky, haphazard business....</p>

  <p>She got up suddenly and hurried downstairs. It was absurd to start getting
  sentimental over Selby. Selby Clive, to all intents and purposes, no longer
  existed; she had to deal with Dennis Sanderby now, and there was no time to
  be lost. The lease must be found, and they must go. There was no other way
  out of it all. Another night in the house with Dennis Sanderby ... She
  shuddered.</p>

  <p>She went into the library and cast an anxious glance towards the garden.
  O'Ryan and her husband were still there, sitting in the deck chairs, their
  backs towards the house, and with a sigh of relief she crossed to the writing
  desk and began hastily searching through the papers that lay on it. There was
  no lease among them, and she turned her attention to the drawers, hurriedly
  taking out the bundles of papers, glancing through them and replacing them
  carefully. She spent ten minutes searching the desk; but the lease was not
  there, and she began to go through the papers in the black dispatch box that
  stood on the floor beside the safe, pausing every now and then to shoot a
  hurried glance at the two deck chairs on the lawn.</p>

  <p>She closed the dispatch box and stood, frowning, beside the desk. The
  lease was not there. Queer. Selby had distinctly told her that he had signed
  it. But she knew of no other place to look, and Frank would not budge without
  it, and she could hardly run away herself and leave Frank to face the music
  alone....</p>

  <p>Her glance fell on a small key that lay on the desk. She picked it up,
  frowning thoughtfully. It was the key of Selby's secret "Safe Deposit," as he
  called it&mdash;a small steel safe built into the wall and hidden by a
  picture, specially for her jewelry. Selby, no doubt, had had it open to put
  away the bracelet&mdash;eight hundred pounds' worth of bad taste. She had not
  given a thought to the jewelry, but if she were going away she would need
  money for herself&mdash;and Frank, too, probably&mdash;and there was jewelry
  worth several thousands in the "Safe Deposit." She could hardly ask Selby for
  it. She rarely wore any of it, and he would wonder why she should suddenly
  want it. He must not be allowed to wonder. If they were to get away in
  safety, he must be given no cause to suspect.</p>

  <p>She crossed the room swiftly, raised the picture, and inserted the key in
  the lock. And then, just as she was turning it, she heard footsteps, withdrew
  the key, replaced the picture, and went towards the French windows, tossing
  the key onto the desk as she passed. O'Ryan and her husband were crossing the
  terrace.</p>

  <p>"Just coming to find you," she said. "Better, Frank?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you, Nita?"</p>

  <p>She read the question in his eyes and gave an almost imperceptible shake
  of her head.</p>

  <p>"No luck," she said. "I've got a fiendish headache&mdash;nearly as bad as
  if we had hit the tree."</p>

  <p>Clive picked up the key from the desk, slipped it casually into his
  pocket, and lolled against the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking, O'Ryan," he said. "As your car is out of commission,
  you had better use my Packard, if you want one."</p>

  <p>"Thanks very much, sir."</p>

  <p>"I can promise you that won't go wrong. I'm something of a motor mechanic
  myself&mdash;I can do my own repairs at a pinch. If there's anything wrong
  with a car when it goes out, I generally know."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure of that, sir," said O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"Then it's a pity you didn't look at Frank's before we took it out this
  morning, Selby," said Nita. "As it is, he has missed his appointment at
  Windsor&mdash;something important about that land you're leasing to
  him&mdash;and now he'll have to make the trip tonight. You'll take me, Frank,
  won't you? We could go after dinner. I daresay Selby will be glad to get rid
  of us&mdash;eh, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Go by all means, my dear&mdash;if you're not nervous. And that reminds
  me, O'Ryan. I'm expecting to have that lease today. Muller took it up to the
  Canadian government office for registration, and it will be coming along some
  time today. Muller realizes that it's urgent."</p>

  <p>"Thanks very much, sir. Then I&mdash;I shall be able to get busy right
  away?"</p>

  <p>Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's awfully good of you, Selby," said Nita. "Taking all this trouble, I
  mean. Frank was telling me this morning that he's terribly grateful."</p>

  <p>"No trouble at all, my dear," he smiled. "I like to give a start to a good
  fellow. There are so few young men nowadays one feels inclined to help. Most
  of those I've met lately seem to have no other thought than sport and
  women&mdash;usually married women."</p>

  <p>"I didn't realize that you studied young men so closely, Selby."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know a few. Bright specimens they are, too! Still, I don't blame
  them so much as the women who encourage them. Of course, it isn't so&mdash;I
  know that from experience&mdash;but you'd think that if a woman had a husband
  and a decent home she'd be satisfied with life and wouldn't always want to be
  chasing after something fresh."</p>

  <p>Nita laughed nervously.</p>

  <p>"Women are queer creatures, Selby, and if you understood them a little
  better I daresay you might blame them less. A woman often gets blamed for
  things she hasn't done. Men are only too ready to think the worst of
  her."</p>

  <p>She was speaking bitterly, with unusual vehemence, and her husband glanced
  at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, my dear," he said. "But I'm not blaming <i>you</i> for something
  you haven't done, so don't take what I said to heart. It's all this modern
  tendency among young people to dynamite the common decencies of life that I
  can't stand." He paused as he strolled towards his desk, and clapped a hand
  on O'Ryan's shoulder. "But you're not the philandering sort, eh, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"I hope not, sir."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure." He picked up his hat from a chair and went towards the door.
  "I'm going down to the plantation, my dear," he said. "The gardener says
  there's a hawk giving trouble down there&mdash;he took three of the young
  chickens the other day. Care to stroll down with me?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;er&mdash;no, Selby, if you don't mind, I&mdash;I'd rather not.
  I've got a splitting headache."</p>

  <p>"Headache? Then I've got the very stuff for you, my dear." He went to the
  writing desk and began searching in a drawer. "A man recommended it to me the
  other day; he told me it was wonderful. Where the devil did I put it? Ah,
  here we are&mdash;Neurolin. You ought not to take more than one tablet; it's
  rather bad for the heart if you take too much. In the right dose, it's
  miraculous. I'll get you a glass of water."</p>

  <p>"No, Selby, please&mdash;don't trouble. Perhaps I'll take it later."</p>

  <p>"No time like now when you've a headache, my dear."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather not&mdash;please. I'll have a cup of tea."</p>

  <p>"As you like." He replaced the small bottle in the drawer and again went
  towards the door. "There was something I wanted to say to you, O'Ryan," he
  said, pausing with his hand on the knob. "It has been at the back of my mind
  ever since you came back, but I can't for the life of me remember Oh, yes, I
  know; that was it. So <i>you</i> stayed at the Laffan the night before last,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"The Laffan?" O'Ryan nodded. "Quite a good spot. I thought I told you,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Clive smiled.</p>

  <p>"No; you were so diplomatically vague when I inquired where you had stayed
  that I thought it indiscreet to press you. Jerry Muller was on the telephone
  to me this morning, and he happened to mention the fact. The floor valet told
  him. He knows you, apparently."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but so was I, Frank," said Nita. She forced herself to say it,
  but her voice was strained as she spoke, and her eyes sought O'Ryan's
  anxiously "If only I'd known, we might have had dinner together."</p>

  <p>"Quite," replied O'Ryan. "But it's a large place, and I had no idea you
  were there. I thought you were still in Scotland."</p>

  <p>"Enormous place," agreed Clive. "Staying there is like being a member of
  the Royal Automobile Club&mdash;you don't know your fellow members until you
  run them down. Nice hotel, though. That continental system of
  intercommunicating rooms&mdash;very convenient, eh, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Can't say, sir," he replied. "I only had one room." The older man
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Innocence!" he laughed. "You'll do, my boy!"</p>

  <p>For some moments after he had left them neither Nita nor O'Ryan spoke.
  Then:</p>

  <p>"Nita?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You heard that&mdash;about the Laffan?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"But it doesn't&mdash;necessarily&mdash;mean anything," she said
  nervously. "He's absolutely childish about the Laffan and its suites. I've
  told him a dozen times that they are the same in every big hotel, but he has
  never stayed anywhere else but the Laffan."</p>

  <p>"Damn the Laffan!" exclaimed O'Ryan viciously. "I wish I'd never seen the
  place." He began restlessly pacing the room. "He doesn't necessarily mean
  anything, you say, Nita? Well, you can believe that if you like. As a matter
  of fact, you don't really believe it any more than I do, but you're scared
  stiff and you're trying to persuade yourself that you do! Why don't you face
  facts?"</p>

  <p>"As calmly and coolly and unflinchingly as you do, eh, Frank?"</p>

  <p>"And the biggest fact you've got to face"&mdash;he ignored the
  irony&mdash;"is Dennis Sanderby."</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt that fact, Frank. It would be idiotic to doubt that Selby
  is Dennis Sanderby."</p>

  <p>"And yet you wonder if he means anything when he talks like that! You can
  take it from me that he means every word he says&mdash;and a damned sight
  more. He's just playing with us, puzzling us, trying to get us rattled,
  wondering how much we can stand without giving the game away, keeping us
  guessing how much he knows. It's devilish. And all the time he's&mdash;what
  was it Whitcombe called him? Suave&mdash;a suave, charming gentleman. He's
  suave enough!"</p>

  <p>Nita sighed.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God you'd go now, Frank, and leave me to it," she said wearily.
  "The lease will be here today." He laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Here today! You don't believe that yarn, do you? I don't believe he has
  ever signed it; and if he has signed it, I'll bet any money you like it has
  never left the house."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a fool, Nita," he went on, "not half such a fool as Selby seems
  to think me, anyway. He thinks he's being frightfully subtle, but it's as
  clear as daylight what game he's playing. I see the whole idea now, though
  I'm hanged if I see how to cope with it. That story about Muller taking the
  lease up to London for registration&mdash;it's all
  bunkum&mdash;lies&mdash;just an excuse for keeping me hanging on here so that
  he can try out some other ingenious scheme for doing me in. It's a jolly sort
  of feeling, isn't it&mdash;never knowing when he may have another cut at
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Then why wait for the lease?"</p>

  <p>"Because I must have it&mdash;you know that. Besides, what would he think
  if I went off suddenly without it? It would be as good as confessing. I can't
  go."</p>

  <p>"Then if you mean to stop here," said the girl, "for heaven's sake, pull
  yourself together and don't make it quite so clear to Selby that he has got
  you badly rattled. That cigarette&mdash;in the garden. You stared at it as if
  it were some poisonous reptile, and I was terrified that Selby would notice.
  Why on earth didn't you take one?"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you?" sneered O'Ryan. "And why didn't you take a Neurolin
  tablet for your headache? I'll tell you why: because you were afraid that if
  you did you'd never have the chance of getting another headache. You were
  probably right, but, for heaven's sake, don't sneer at me for being rattled
  when you're just as badly rattled yourself."</p>

  <p>For some time he paced the room in silence, and then he suddenly
  halted.</p>

  <p>"Hang it, Nita!" he exclaimed. "It's all so damnably unfair. I'm being
  blamed for something that never happened. I wouldn't care so much if he had
  any sort of reason for having a grudge against me, but he hasn't."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody knows that better than you do, Nita."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of that," she said thoughtfully. "I was thinking that
  he might very well have quite a different grievance against you. Suppose he
  knows that, besides trying to swindle him over his wife, you're also doing
  your best to swindle him over the Tamagari property?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" She smiled. "More innocence, eh? Very well. Then suppose
  Selby knows all the time that there is silver in the land, and knows that you
  know it?" O'Ryan glanced at her uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that. Of course, I don't know for certain," he added
  hastily, "that there is silver there, but there may be, and Selby isn't a
  fool. If he was wise enough to have the land prospected ... What makes you
  say that, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"It struck me as possible, that's all," she replied. "Selby is wise, and
  Muller's wiser. Muller believes there's silver in the land; he told me
  so&mdash;asked me to see if I could stop Selby presenting you with a million
  dollars. Selby of course does do the most quixotic things, but I can't see
  even him, just because a young man isn't of the philandering sort, giving him
  a million dollars. I shouldn't be at all surprised if the lease is only a
  bait. If Selby knows about the silver, and thinks you know about it, he will
  know that you won't easily be persuaded to clear off until you've got it, and
  that if the car accident wasn't successful, he will have plenty of time,
  provided he hangs up the lease, to try some other method."</p>

  <p>"H'm! I shouldn't wonder&mdash;oh, of course you're right. But can't we do
  something? Hang it, there must be something we can do."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders and went listlessly towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I say, Nita, where&mdash;where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"I really don't know," she replied carelessly; and then she swung round
  and faced him. "What does it matter to you where I'm going?" she demanded.
  "You don't want me to stand by you and hold your hand all the time, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"That's offensive. But we're both in this, and it's no use quarrelling.
  And it's no use getting scared and letting this Sanderby fellow have
  everything his own way. I don't intend to, anyway. If anything happens to
  you, I'll make it my business to see that he doesn't get away with it."</p>

  <p>"Many thanks. That's tremendously comforting. And if anything should
  happen to you, don't worry, will you? I'll tell Selby how terribly unfair he
  has been." O'Ryan frowned.</p>

  <p>"Cheap sarcasm doesn't help," he remarked, strolling towards the windows.
  "You seem to think I'm scared of Selby: well, I'm not. I was a bit rattled
  just now&mdash;anybody would be after a narrow shave like I had&mdash;but I'm
  not scared, whatever you may think. I don't mean to let the swine have
  everything his own way."</p>

  <p>"You make me feel almost safe, Frank."</p>

  <p>He leaned against the French windows, gazing out across the lawn with a
  confident smile. As he did so, a shot rang out in the garden.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">O'RYAN started violently and cringed back.</p>

  <p>"My God! What was that?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke there came the sound of a second shot.
  "Frank&mdash;quick&mdash;stand away from that window!" He turned a scared
  face towards her and stood motionless, staring at her helplessly, and she
  stepped quickly forward, grasped his arm, and pulled him back into the room.
  He was trembling, his face deathly pale, his lips twitching.</p>

  <p>"Somebody&mdash;fired at me."</p>

  <p>"You're not hurt?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The moment I appeared at the window they let fly&mdash;two
  shots&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She turned from him, crossed to the fireplace and pressed the button of
  the electric bell.</p>

  <p>"That swine!" muttered O'Ryan. "He might easily have got me. If I had gone
  out onto the terrace ... Look here, Nita, I can't stand much more of this
  sort of thing."</p>

  <p>The door was opened, and Lane came in.</p>

  <p>"You rang, madam?"</p>

  <p>"What was that shooting, Lane?"</p>

  <p>"It was Mr. Clive, I fancy, madam&mdash;down at the plantation. I noticed
  that he took his gun with him."</p>

  <p>"Gun? Rot!" exclaimed O'Ryan excitedly. "Somebody fired a rifle&mdash;two
  shots." Lane turned and glanced at him in surprise, and a faint smile
  flickered across his face.</p>

  <p>"A gun, sir," he repeated. "I heard the reports. A rifle makes quite a
  different noise. And Mr. Clive would hardly use a rifle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, Lane, thank you," interrupted Nita. Lane went out, and she
  glanced across at O'Ryan. "You heard, Frank? It was a shotgun. Selby is
  probably after rabbits."</p>

  <p>"You can't tell me, Nita. That was a rifle. I don't care a hang what Lane
  says. Of course Lane wouldn't give him away: he's in with him&mdash;like
  Muller. Nita, for God's sake&mdash;first the car, and now this.
  You&mdash;you've got to do something."</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose I can do?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. It's no use asking me. But there must be some way of
  putting things right. Couldn't you&mdash;talk to him? Hang it, you're his
  wife, and you must have some sort of influence. I mean, he'd be more likely
  to listen to you than to me. It's all so damnably unreasonable."</p>

  <p>"And you're suggesting that I should try to reason with him? Let's try to
  be practical, Frank. Do you really believe that if I tell Selby the
  truth&mdash;that I went to the Laffan without telling him, that I met you
  there, that my room was next to yours&mdash;booked by you&mdash;with a
  communicating door, but that it was all perfectly innocent because I shot the
  bolt and ran away first thing in the morning&mdash;do you really believe that
  he'd swallow the story? He'd swallow all except the innocence, and you
  couldn't blame him."</p>

  <p>"I'm not suggesting anything of the sort," snapped O'Ryan. "But you
  could&mdash;well, sort of suggest to him that everything is all right.
  Between you and him, I mean. If you were a bit more demonstrative&mdash;let
  him see that you're terribly fond of him&mdash;he might realize that he's
  making a ghastly mistake. Try, Nita, won't you? If you could get him
  alone&mdash;it should be dead easy. When he comes to your room&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't come to my room."</p>

  <p>At the sound of footsteps she turned her head and saw Clive, with a gun
  under his arm, coming across the terrace.</p>

  <p>"Got the brute with the second barrel," he announced, setting his gun in
  the corner. "No more will he kill my little chickens."</p>

  <p>"It was you shooting, Selby?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I told you I was going down to find him, didn't I? I say, Nita, I'm
  sorry&mdash;I forgot your headache. What a brute I am!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that&mdash;that didn't matter at all, Selby. I&mdash;I&mdash;the
  headache's gone. A hawk, was it?"</p>

  <p>"A kestrel. I hate 'em&mdash;all things that prey on their fellows.
  They're just like some people I know&mdash;never happy unless they are
  hurting and tearing and maiming for the love of it. If I had my way I'd treat
  people like that in the same way&mdash;only I'd use a rifle."</p>

  <p>"You must be a pretty good shot, sir," remarked O'Ryan. "A kestrel takes
  some hitting. Have you ever used a rifle?"</p>

  <p>"Often," Clive told him. "But I'm not such a good shot as I used to
  be&mdash;unfortunately. That's a nice head of moose in the billiard room. I
  got him up in northern Ontario. Fond of shooting?"</p>

  <p>"When he's behind the gun, Selby," laughed Nita, "and not in front of
  it."</p>

  <p>Clive smiled.</p>

  <p>"Like the bolts at the Laffan, eh, O'Ryan? It depends on which side of the
  door they are. Well, you'll find plenty of good shooting on the Tamagari
  land&mdash;if you ever get there."</p>

  <p>"But why&mdash;why shouldn't he get there, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you never know, my dear," replied her husband; "he may not go out
  there himself. A man who owns coal mines doesn't necessarily live down the
  pit." He went towards the windows. "I'm going to have a go at the new
  pergola, Nita," he said. "If it's left to the workmen, it won't be done this
  year, by the look of things. If you're feeling energetic, O'Ryan, you can
  come and lend a hand."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, sir, but I've a phone call to make, if I may," said O'Ryan. "About
  the car. I must arrange with the garage to fetch it in, or I shall have the
  police after me." Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"Telephone in the hall," he said. "Hamlin's is the best garage. But you
  needn't worry yourself about the police around here; they're more than half
  asleep. There were burglaries all over the place last year, but the police
  were too absorbed in measuring the number plates of cars to take notice of
  burglaries. I've always said&mdash; haven't I, Nita?&mdash;that if I wanted
  to commit a murder I should lure my victim into this police area before I set
  about killing him."</p>

  <p>Nita watched him as he crossed the lawn until he disappeared behind the
  bank of rambler roses, and then she turned and glanced at O'Ryan. He was
  standing by the door with a hand on the knob, frowning thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I say, Nita, I was just saying, when Selby came in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not likely to forget what you were saying."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's worth thinking over. I believe you could put things right if
  you tackled him properly&mdash;vamped him a bit."</p>

  <p>"Go and telephone, Frank." There was a warning note in her voice and a
  warning look in her eyes, but he did not notice them.</p>

  <p>"After all," he went on, "Selby's pretty fond of you&mdash;naturally. Who
  wouldn't be? And if you play your cards properly&mdash;let him see
  that&mdash;that you're willing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nita sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake," she exclaimed angrily, "go and telephone! Do you hear?
  Get out of this room before I ring for Lane and have you thrown out!"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens! What on earth&mdash;you don't understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you needn't fear that I haven't understood," she interrupted. "Your
  meaning is perfectly plain&mdash;disgustingly plain. So long as your skin is
  saved, it doesn't matter what foul thing I do. So long as Selby can be
  persuaded that you're the faithful friend and spotless gentleman, you don't
  care what beastliness&mdash;" She paused abruptly, turned from him, and
  seated himself in her chair again. "Just get out&mdash;that's all," she
  said.</p>

  <p>She heard the door opened and closed and gave a sigh of relief. So that
  was Frank's solution! She was to lay herself out to be pleasant to
  Selby&mdash;"vamp him a bit"&mdash;lure him on, make him realize that she was
  quite prepared to stop being a mean little swine to him and was ready to
  fulfil her part of the bargain. She was to dangle a tempting morsel in front
  of him, play on his feelings until passion swamped his reason and made him
  either tolerant of her lapse or forgetful of his suspicions, and then, she
  supposed, when she was quite sure that Frank was no longer in danger, Selby
  was to have his reward. And Frank was willing that she should so degrade
  herself; it struck him as a happy way out of the mess into which they had
  landed themselves that she should barter herself for his safety, play the
  prostitute to save his precious skin and secure his precious lease. And only
  two days ago she had believed that he really loved her, had been willing,
  because of his love, to sacrifice everything for him. Well, so much for
  Frank's love!</p>

  <p>But he was right; something must be done. Her thoughts turned to her
  husband. Suppose she were to go to him and make a clean breast of the whole
  business? She felt that it would be putting a severe strain on his credulity.
  If she could have done it at once&mdash;before he had heard of it from some
  other quarter&mdash;he might possibly have believed her; but now, when he
  must surely know that she was aware he suspected her, he could hardly fail to
  look on her story as a ruse to appease him and avert the consequences. It was
  hardly the sort of ruse that would impress Dennis Sanderby.</p>

  <p>Yet she was, she discovered, desperately anxious that Selby should know
  the truth and believe it. Whether or no she could avert the consequences was
  not, strangely enough, the most important question at the moment. What
  mattered was that Selby should believe her, that he should readmit her to his
  confidence, that he should not think badly of her. She had a feeling that in
  forfeiting his confidence she had suffered an irreparable loss, and the fact
  that Selby and Dennis Sanderby were one and the same person did not lessen
  the loss. She wondered whether even now it might not be possible to repair
  the damage. If she had never looked into that secret drawer of his desk she
  would never have known of Dennis Sanderby, and she wondered whether, if she
  had not come to know that secret of her husband's past, she could have told
  him everything and trusted him to understand and forgive. Probably she could.
  Selby was nothing if not just. It was this knowledge that he was Dennis
  Sanderby that was holding her back. Yet Dennis Sanderby, she supposed, was
  just; ruthless, perhaps, but surely his revenge had a touch of justice about
  it. And for twenty years Selby had been Selby Clive, not Dennis Sanderby.
  Perhaps even now it might be possible to forget that he had ever been Dennis
  Sanderby, whom she had never known, to think of him only as Selby Clive, whom
  she had always admired and respected, upon whom she had always relied, who
  had so many points about him that any sane woman desires in a husband, whom
  she had so often felt that she might so easily love....</p>

  <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by the return of O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"Cooled off, Nita?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Feeling quite frigid, thanks."</p>

  <p>"Sorry I upset you, but there was no need to boil over like that. After
  all, there's nothing to shock even your Puritan mind in the suggestion that a
  wife should play the game with her husband. When all is said and done, it's
  pretty tough for old Selby."</p>

  <p>"May I suggest, Frank, that you should mind your own business?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it my business? You've a queer way of looking at things, Nita. I'm
  to run the risk of getting a bullet in my head for something I haven't done,
  simply because you don't feel inclined to take the one course which would
  convince your husband that he's the only man in the world you care for, and
  it's not my business. It's pretty rotten for me, feeling as I do about you,
  to have to agree to that sort of thing, but I'm sensible enough to see that
  I've got to grin and bear it. Selby is your husband, and I realize that he
  has first claim&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She had sprung to her feet and was facing him with furious eyes. Then, as
  suddenly, she turned from him. "Frank," she said calmly, "you make me feel
  sick." There came a tap on the door, and Lane appeared. "Sir Ralph Whitcombe,
  madam," he announced. Nita nodded.</p>

  <p>"Show him in here, Lane," she said. "And you need not disturb Mr. Clive;
  he's busy in the garden."</p>

  <p>Lane disappeared, and a moment later Sir Ralph, attach case in hand, came
  into the room.</p>

  <p>"Ah, good-morning, Mrs. Clive. Good-morning, O'Ryan. A rather untimely
  visit, I'm afraid, Mrs. Clive, but you will, I am sure, make allowances." He
  tapped his attach case, smiling. "We writing folks are inclined to believe
  that everything must be sacrificed to our work, and there are several points
  in this Sanderby case&mdash;points connected with Canadian police methods and
  so on&mdash;in which I thought your husband&mdash;"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan cut him short.</p>

  <p>"I don't imagine Mr. Clive would be of much help to you, Sir Ralph."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? You surprise me. I should have thought that, having spent so many
  years of his life in Canada&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's not that, Sir Ralph," interrupted Nita. "I suppose Selby must
  know all about Canada, but&mdash;well, he hates anything horrible or sordid.
  He will never even read the accounts of murders in the newspapers because
  they always depress him terribly."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," repeated Sir Ralph, raising his bushy eyebrows. "I should not
  have thought of your husband as a particularly sensitive man, Mrs.
  Clive."</p>

  <p>"He is&mdash;dreadfully&mdash;about that kind of thing. I meant to ask you
  yesterday, Sir Ralph, when you were telling us about that awful Sanderby man,
  but it slipped my mind. Will you promise, Sir Ralph, as a great personal
  favour to me, never to mention this Sanderby case&mdash;or any other gruesome
  case like it&mdash;to my husband?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Mrs. Clive&mdash;certainly&mdash;I will on no account mention the
  matter. We lawyers, I'm afraid, come to look on these things in such an
  impersonal and coldblooded way that we are apt to forget that there is
  anything horrible about them. I hope I did not distress you yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," she laughed. "Mr. O'Ryan and I are tremendously interested,
  aren't we, Frank? Did Selby expect you this morning, Sir Ralph?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no, I did not say definitely that I should be coming
  over&mdash;merely that I might. As a matter of fact, I was hoping that Mr.
  Muller would be here; he is the person I am really anxious to see. A very
  intelligent type of Colonial, I thought him. And your carnations, Mrs.
  Clive&mdash;I am very anxious to have a glimpse of them. I may be a duffer at
  law, but I do know something about carnations."</p>

  <p>Nita smiled.</p>

  <p>"You can see the carnations, Sir Ralph&mdash;if you'll promise to be
  complimentary; but I'm afraid Mr. Muller isn't here."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Most unfortunate," said Whitcombe. "There is a little lacuna in my
  data concerning this&mdash;er&mdash;these Sanderby murders&mdash;though I've
  no right to call them murders, I suppose, since the man was not convicted. I
  was hoping that your Canadian friend might be able to give me some
  guidance."</p>

  <p>"There's the British Museum," suggested O'Ryan, with a hint of impatience.
  "You'd probably find all the details you want in the library."</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph nodded.</p>

  <p>"An excellent idea," he agreed. "But I want to know very little really.
  This man Dennis Sanderby is reported to have changed his name. I have no
  proof of that, but there seems a strong probability that he did so."</p>

  <p>"Sounds likely, anyway," said O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"I want, if I can, to secure some sort of confirmation on that point," the
  elderly lawyer explained. "You have no idea, Mrs. Clive, how absorbed one can
  get in a subject like this Sanderby case. Even in bed I find myself lying
  awake and thinking out the various problems it presents. The more one studies
  it, the more remarkable the case appears. A curious point is that the man
  Sanderby seems to have faded entirely out of view."</p>

  <p>"He's probably dead," remarked O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "Had he died, there would be some record of his death.
  Fortunately Bennett, of the Home Office, is staying with the Boscombes, and I
  have been able to ask his advice. He suggests that I should approach the
  Royal Canadian Police for information. For all we know, the man may be in
  England, living under an assumed name."</p>

  <p>"Hardly likely, is it, Sir Ralph?" said Nita.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mrs. Clive?" replied Whitcombe. "In my opinion, nothing is more
  likely than that he should have come to this country. I always say that if we
  could get a list of everybody who is living in this country&mdash;or in
  London alone&mdash;we should be astonished at the names that would appear on
  it&mdash;some famous, some infamous. We never know, when we pass along a
  London street, who the person may be who jostles us. He may have occupied a
  throne or a condemned cell&mdash;there's no telling. That is the fascination
  of London. This man Sanderby, three times a murderer&mdash;we may have
  actually rubbed elbows with him&mdash;met him, even! He may be living among
  us as a rich man, an honoured citizen, or he may be skulking among the
  denizens of the underworld&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nita cut short the harangue.</p>

  <p>"Have you written to the Canadian Police?"</p>

  <p>"I have done better than that, Mrs. Clive: I have telegraphed&mdash;at
  deferred rates. I prepaid a reply and am hoping to receive an answer today.
  If the man is in England&mdash;dear me&mdash;yes, it would be most
  interesting if we could trace him and get into touch with him. He could no
  doubt give me much interesting matter. A murder trial from the point of view
  of the prisoner in the dock, his emotions during the ordeal&mdash;a
  fascinating psychological study."</p>

  <p>"What sort of man was Sanderby?" inquired O'Ryan. "What position did he
  hold?"</p>

  <p>"He was a&mdash;ah&mdash;man of substance, apparently," said Sir Ralph; "a
  landowner with large interests in city property in Winnipeg, Saskatoon, and
  Edmonton."</p>

  <p>"And a suave man, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Suave? Curious that you should say that, O'Ryan." He opened his attach
  case and began rummaging inside. "I've still got my little chill-destroyer,
  Mrs. Clive," he smiled, holding up the small flask-shaped bottle of
  vodka.</p>

  <p>He replaced it, took out a bundle of newspaper cuttings, and began looking
  through them.</p>

  <p>"Ah, here we are," he went on. "Listen to this: it is a description,
  written during Sanderby's trial, by a reporter&mdash;evidently quite a
  superior kind of reporter. He says: 'Dennis Sanderby was the only person in
  court who was not affected by the medical evidence. He leaned back in his
  chair and spoke smilingly to the officer by his side. A good-looking man with
  a ready smile, a pleasing manner, a disarming air of innocence, it was
  difficult to imagine that this suave man was accused of sending these people
  to their deaths.'"</p>

  <p>Nita rose.</p>

  <p>"It's all rather&mdash;nasty, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Frightfully interesting, though," said O'Ryan. "Go on, Sir Ralph; let's
  hear some more about the blighter."</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph hesitated, glancing at Nita.</p>

  <p>"If this distresses you at all, Mrs. Clive ... I can assure you that there
  is nothing unpleasant in this&mdash;no gruesome details."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Sir Ralph," she smiled; "I'll trust your judgment. Please read
  on. Frank has a terrible taste for horrors."</p>

  <p>The lawyer returned to the newspaper cutting.</p>

  <p>"'It was impossible to conceive that Sanderby had daily intercourse with
  his victims, joked with them, had the appearance of genial good-fellowship,
  and never once betrayed himself, never once aroused their suspicions that he
  had discovered their secret. A ruthless man pursuing his inexorable way,
  unmoved by pity, not to be turned aside from his purpose&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>He paused and peered at them above his glasses. "That is perilously near
  contempt of court. The reporter's eloquence, I am afraid, ran away with his
  discretion. Had I been conducting the defense of Sanderby I should certainly
  have objected to that sentence. However ... 'He smiled when the coachman gave
  evidence that the wheels of Mrs. Sanderby's carriage had been tampered with
  before she took a drive on a very dangerous hill.'"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan started.</p>

  <p>"The wheels&mdash;tampered with? Good God!" He caught Nita's eye and
  checked himself. "Pleasant sort of bloke, by the sound of things," he said.
  "And he got away with it! Just because he had a clever lawyer to defend him,
  a man like Sanderby is let loose on the world to do the same sort of thing
  again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused abruptly as Selby Clive came in from the terrace.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Whitcombe!" he said pleasantly. "Sorry Jerry isn't back yet, but
  he'll be along later. What's happening? O'Ryan giving a lecture?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer gathered up the newspaper cuttings, hastily stuffed them into
  his attach case and closed it.</p>

  <p>"I was just reading an extract from my book, Clive&mdash;my forthcoming
  book," he explained. "Your wife was good enough to pretend to be
  interested."</p>

  <p>"Well, carry on," urged Clive. "I'd like to hear it. What is it this time?
  Some more of that light and airy stuff about Canals and Waterways?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;as a matter of fact&mdash;" He saw that Nita,
  behind Clive's back, was shaking her head and frowning, and hurriedly picked
  up his attach case. "Some other time, Clive," he said. "I really came to see
  that Canadian friend of yours, you know. There are one or two points
  concerning Canadian affairs on which I should like to consult him. You might
  phone me if he returns, will you? Or perhaps you could tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll phone you, Sir Ralph," interposed Nita. "Selby never remembers
  anything."</p>

  <p>"That's hardly true," smiled her husband. "The trouble with some things is
  not to remember them but to forget them. If there's any information I can
  give you about Canada, Whitcombe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Some other time, please, Selby," said Nita. "Sir Ralph is going to see my
  carnations now. Carnations are much more interesting than Canada."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;the carnations," said Sir Ralph, obviously relieved. "I'd
  forgotten them for the moment. One gets so absorbed in
  these&mdash;er&mdash;dear me, yes, the carnations."</p>

  <p>"Mr. O'Ryan will show them to you&mdash;won't you, Frank? And you may pick
  the best, Sir Ralph&mdash;provided you tell me what you really think of them.
  I don't want compliments."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan stepped eagerly towards the French windows. "This way, Sir Ralph,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>The lawyer, following him, paused as he stepped out onto the terrace.</p>

  <p>"I warn you, Mrs. Clive," he said, with a smile: "after all I've heard of
  your carnations I'm expecting a great deal, and I'm a very severe
  critic."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Men always are, Sir Ralph," she laughed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">WITH a sigh of relief Nita sank into the corner of the
  Chesterfield and glanced up at her husband as he stood lolling against the
  mantelpiece, absorbed in filling his pipe. If only she dared tell him
  everything&mdash;now&mdash;while she had him alone! After all, why shouldn't
  she? If she had not known that he was Dennis Sanderby, she would not have
  been afraid to tell him, and the fact that she had come by that knowledge had
  not changed him from the man she had known. She wanted badly to put things
  right with him; and she wanted it, not because, if he came to believe in her
  again, she&mdash;and Frank&mdash;might be free from danger; it would,
  incidentally, have that effect, but that was not her chief object. She was
  sure of that. She felt that, if she were to attempt to win back Selby's
  confidence, she must be sure of that first, satisfied beyond all doubt in her
  own mind that it was not fear that prompted her. Frank, of course, should she
  succeed, would never believe her. He would believe, at the best, that fear of
  what might happen to her had forced her to do it, and that she was only
  salving her Puritan conscience by pretending that she had acted from the
  purest motives. But it did not matter much what Frank thought. If she could
  bring herself to broach the subject, to say those first few words...</p>

  <p>She felt her heart throbbing furiously, and her throat ached. She drew in
  her breath sharply, held it, pressing her teeth against her lip as she gazed
  at Selby, still busy with his pipe. Her lips parted.</p>

  <p>"Selby!"</p>

  <p>He glanced up at her.</p>

  <p>"So O'Ryan has special privileges, eh, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"Frank? You mean from me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"He's privileged to act as guide to the carnations. I've never known you
  let anyone show off your carnations before&mdash;even me."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;that! He was talking to Sir Ralph, and I didn't want to
  interrupt them."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you rather go and show them off yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No, Selby, I'd rather stay here with you."</p>

  <p>She saw the quick look of surprise that he shot at her, and hurried
  on:</p>

  <p>"At least, I've had more than enough of Sir Ralph, and I was quite glad of
  an excuse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, frowning. Why had she added that? She hadn't meant to. That
  was just the way she had always treated Selby&mdash;offered him something and
  instantly withdrawn it before he had time to accept.</p>

  <p>"An excuse to escape from the lecture? Poor darling! What is this book
  he's writing?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, some law book or other. I really didn't pay very much attention. I
  always treat Sir Ralph rather like the wireless&mdash;just let him go on and
  on because I haven't the energy to switch him off. But I didn't mean that; I
  meant that I was glad of an excuse to get a few minutes alone with you."</p>

  <p>"Pulling my leg, Nita?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head and patted the seat of the Chesterfield invitingly.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Selby&mdash;just for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>He seated himself beside her and laid a hand on hers.</p>

  <p>"Nita darling," he said, "you've been terribly nice to me the last day or
  two. Or is that only my fancy?"</p>

  <p>"Aren't I always nice to you, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es," he admitted doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"You don't think so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;of course&mdash;always nice, Nita. You've never been anything
  but&mdash;pleasant; you're too much of an angel for that. But it isn't always
  easy, is it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I understand."</p>

  <p>"I think you do," he smiled. "I'm a difficult sort of creature to get on
  with at the best of times, and sometimes I know I must irritate you terribly.
  It's not that I mean to be awkward, but&mdash;well, the fact is, I suppose,
  that I shouldn't have married you."</p>

  <p>"Silly!" she laughed. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"You said something the other day," he went on, "which set me thinking. At
  the time it hurt me pretty badly, but when I came to think it
  over&mdash;after you'd gone to Scotland&mdash;I saw that it was a perfectly
  natural thing for you to have said. Remember? You told me not to be so
  <i>old."</i></p>

  <p>"Oh, that! You should have known better than to take any notice, Selby. I
  was in a dreadfully bad temper, wasn't I?"</p>

  <p>"That's when we usually let out the truth&mdash;when we're in a temper and
  don't pause to think what we're saying. I think you were perfectly right, my
  dear. I had a good look at myself while you were away, and I realize that
  I'm&mdash;well, rather old-minded, I suppose. If things aren't just so, I'm
  worried."</p>

  <p>"And aren't things&mdash;just so?"</p>

  <p>"Darling, you know. Things aren't&mdash;well, not as I'd like them to be.
  But I'm not grumbling. You give me all that you feel able to give me, and I'm
  grateful for that. You've given me a great deal this last day or two."</p>

  <p>"And this last year or two, what have you given me?" she said. "Or rather,
  what haven't you given me? Do you realize that until I was married I dressed
  on fifty pounds a year?"</p>

  <p>He made a deprecating gesture.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;material things&mdash;I've given you those. But there are
  other things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He got up from the Chesterfield, crossed to the mantelpiece in search of
  matches, and lighted his pipe. She waited, scanning his face anxiously She
  was getting closer to him, breaking down that barrier of reserve which had
  stood between them for so long. She had not talked to him in this intimate
  way for a long time. She felt a strange elation, an inward glow of
  satisfaction. She was anxious to get still closer, to put things absolutely
  right between them, to establish this intimacy as something permanent. She
  must not let it slip away again....</p>

  <p>He tossed the match into the grate.</p>

  <p>"You've known young O'Ryan quite a long time, haven't you, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"Since we were both so high," she smiled. "I've known his people all my
  life."</p>

  <p>"Sweethearts when you were kids, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, never that. Just good friends."</p>

  <p>His pipe was drawing badly, and he was staring at it resentfully, prodding
  it with a pencil.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, if he had been in a position to marry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense, Selby!" she exclaimed. "There was never any question of
  that. Until we met him at Ascot last year, I hadn't seen him for
  years&mdash;not since I was about sixteen. And then I found him&mdash;well,
  amusing, that's all. He <i>is</i> rather amusing, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he nodded. "He's a nice-looking fellow&mdash;and young. I've
  sometimes thought ... Well, young people belong to one another."</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;I belonged&mdash;to you."</p>

  <p>He gave that rather wistful smile of his&mdash;the smile that always made
  her want to give him a pat of comfort. "I like to have that illusion,
  Nita."</p>

  <p>She rose and went to him, and stood fingering a button on his coat,
  avoiding his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Illusion, Selby?" she said. "Are you talking quite a lot of
  nonsense&mdash;imagining things?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he admitted. "I've been telling myself how terribly nice you've
  been to me since you came back. Have I been imagining that?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I like you better, Selby," she said softly.
  "Liking&mdash;love&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash;doesn't stand
  still, does it?"</p>

  <p>"It either grows or withers, Nita&mdash;I suppose that's true."</p>

  <p>He drew her hand away from the button, turned from her, and began pacing
  the room, frowning thoughtfully and sending clouds of smoke from his pipe.
  And then he suddenly paused, laid a hand on her shoulder, and stood gazing at
  her with keen, searching eyes.</p>

  <p>"If I were sure of something, Nita," he said at last, "it would make a
  great difference to you and me. If I were convinced&mdash;one way or the
  other... ."</p>

  <p>She forced herself to raise her head and meet his gaze. "What&mdash;what
  is it, Selby?" she asked in a low voice. "If there's anything&mdash;anything
  you want to ask me&mdash; I'll tell you&mdash;the truth."</p>

  <p>For some moments he made no reply, still gazing at her thoughtfully, as if
  trying to read something in her face, and then he shook his head, and his
  hand dropped from her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it isn't fair to ask you, my dear," he said. "We'll let it go.
  I'll find out for myself."</p>

  <p>She had a feeling that she was losing something, that he was retiring
  again behind the barrier, that she was being cut off, excluded, and she knew
  that she must not let it happen.</p>

  <p>"Is that quite fair, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Fair? By my way of reasoning&mdash;yes. I'm afraid I'm a bit of a moral
  coward sometimes. There are some things I can't face."</p>

  <p>"But you may be wrong," she persisted. "It's so easy to be wrong. And if
  you won't face it&mdash;whatever it is&mdash; that's worrying you&mdash;how
  are you to know whether you're wrong or right?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"One can only rely on one's intelligence&mdash;and one's eyes."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then you're not&mdash;sure?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I was two days ago. But now&mdash;no, I'm undecided."</p>

  <p>She returned to the settee and sat down with a sigh. "Tell me something,
  will you, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a moral coward, and I'm not afraid to ask you. Do
  you&mdash;absolutely&mdash;trust me?"</p>

  <p>"Why ask me that, darling?"</p>

  <p>"Because, sometimes, just lately, I've thought that you don't."</p>

  <p>"It's easy to imagine things," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"If you do trust me absolutely, why did you say just now that you
  shouldn't have married me? That was an odd thing to say."</p>

  <p>He seated himself on the back of the settee. "Old-minded," he repeated,
  "old-fashioned, with an old-time prejudice against modern notions. Crabbed
  age living with modern youth&mdash;and making rather a mess of it. Antiquated
  ideas about woman and how she should behave and the right way to treat her
  when she doesn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your first marriage, Selby," she interrupted. "I've never asked you
  anything about it, and you've never told me. Was it a happy one?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly."</p>

  <p>"It was unhappy?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Somewhat disastrous for all concerned, Nita. It began very
  happily&mdash;most marriages do, I suppose&mdash; but it ended&mdash;" He
  shrugged. "I'd rather not talk about it."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," she said. "But because your first marriage wasn't a success,
  that's no reason why this one shouldn't be, is it? We've been married for
  three years now, and it hasn't been very awful, has it?" She took his hand
  and held it, watching his face anxiously.</p>

  <p>"It has been wonderful, Nita&mdash;in some ways."</p>

  <p>"But not what it should have been, eh, Selby? Oh, I know. I haven't been
  awfully nice to you, have I? I've taken everything and given
  nothing&mdash;I've been a shirker. Some men wouldn't have stood for the
  shirking."</p>

  <p>He cut her short with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"I have very definite views on that subject, Nita," he said;
  "old-fashioned views, perhaps. It's repugnant to me that a woman, when she
  becomes a wife, should not remain mistress of her own life. In matters that
  concern her own comfort the decision should rest with her."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with you, dear," she said, "is that you're rather too
  nice."</p>

  <p>"I may be old-fashioned, darling, but I'm not primitive."</p>

  <p>She nodded, and was silent for some moments. She had only to speak now, to
  say what it would be easy to say to him, just to smile at him and beckon ...
  Beckon to Dennis Sanderby? Because she was afraid, because, even at that
  price, she must buy safety for herself and Frank, because she could see no
  other way of quieting his suspicions? She was sure that it would not be for
  these reasons, whatever Frank might think. She would not be beckoning Dennis
  Sanderby; she would be beckoning Selby Clive&mdash;her husband.</p>

  <p>"Selby, the other day&mdash;before I went to Scotland&mdash;you said that
  we were drifting, that the gap between us was getting wider. Remember? I
  wouldn't talk about it then. But I've been thinking quite a lot up in
  Scotland, and I see now that you were right. We don't see much of each other
  these days, do we? We live under the same roof, but we're not much more than
  strangers."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Nita, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know; it's my fault&mdash;partly. Chiefly, perhaps; but not
  entirely. At nights, for instance, I never even know nowadays whether you're
  down here working or whether you're in bed. And that's your fault, Selby.
  Once upon a time you always used to come and say good-night to me,"</p>

  <p>"Well... yes, I did, Nita. But then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand," she said. "But I still like to know where you are and what
  you're doing, that you're about the place somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Developing nerves, darling? There's nothing to be nervous about. I'm
  usually within calling distance, and you've a bolt on your door. If anything
  alarmed you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bolt?" She gave a shrug. "Bolts are only useful, Selby, when you want
  to&mdash;keep someone out."</p>

  <p>She knew that he had turned his head and was gazing at her; she knew, too,
  just the expression that was on his face&mdash;surprise, doubt, wonder, hope;
  but she could not bring herself to look at him. She waited, her heart
  thumping, for his next words. Surely she had understood?
  Surely&mdash;now&mdash;he must believe ...</p>

  <p>She felt his hand beneath her chin, raising her head until she had no
  choice but to meet his eyes.</p>

  <p>"And don't you want to keep someone out, my dear?"</p>

  <p>Almost imperceptibly she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, Selby&mdash;I don't&mdash;think&mdash;I do."</p>

  <p>His arm slipped round her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Nita, darling," he said, "I can hardly believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, and she saw that he was staring out into the garden. "Here's
  Whitcombe back again," he said. "They always say that there's no escaping the
  law."</p>

  <p>He got up from the settee and went towards the window, and Nita sighed.
  Why on earth must Sir Ralph choose that particular moment to interrupt them?
  She had been so very close to Selby&mdash;his arm around her shoulders, his
  lips near to hers. Just a few more seconds and she would have been sure of
  him. She had only to get just a little closer, and she could have told him
  everything, without fear that he might not believe her, freed herself of her
  burden and been able to look him in the eyes again. But now, thanks to the
  old lawyer, she was not sure. Had she made him understand? She thought so,
  but with Selby it was always so difficult to be sure. "I can hardly
  believe&mdash;" he had said. What was it that he could hardly believe? That
  she intended to have no more to do with shirking, that she would in future be
  as ready to give as to take? Or had he meant to say that, if all she had just
  been telling him were true, if her feelings towards him were really such as
  she had been hinting, if she were honestly anxious to make their marriage a
  success, he could hardly believe that she would have made that appointment
  with O'Ryan at the Laffan, that the two stories did not tally, and that since
  he knew her visit to the Laffan to be a fact, he could only assume that the
  other was fiction?</p>

  <p>Frank, following Sir Ralph into the room, shot her an inquiring glance and
  received in exchange an uncomprehending stare.</p>

  <p>"The pride of the garden, Mrs. Clive," said Sir Ralph, pointing to the
  carnation in his buttonhole.</p>

  <p>"I warned you that I should pick the best, and here it is. What colour!
  What fragrance! Altogether a wonderful collection!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nita smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not a very severe critic, after all, Sir Ralph," she said. "Will you stay
  and criticize lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Many thanks, Mrs. Clive, but I'm afraid I mustn't do that. I have
  promised faithfully to be back to have lunch with those noisy young people.
  They insisted on it. I was telling them at breakfast about that case I
  mentioned to you, and they are anxious for me to continue. They seem to take
  rather a morbid interest in the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw the warning look from Nita and stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>"What case is that, Whitcombe?" inquired Clive.</p>

  <p>"Oh, a&mdash;er&mdash;case, Clive, in which I&mdash;er&mdash;took part
  many years ago." He glanced at Nita, obviously in search of her approval.
  "O'Ryan has been conducting me round your estate," he went on. "You've
  improved it immensely. More roses, eh, Mrs. Clive?"</p>

  <p>"We've been inspecting the new pergola," O'Ryan explained.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;the pergola," continued Sir Ralph. "Quite typical of your
  husband, Mrs. Clive&mdash;a very thorough and substantial job. I like those
  big baulks and beams, Clive&mdash;something solid and British about
  them."</p>

  <p>"Rather heavier than I intended," said Selby, "and those workmen are the
  most careless devils. I noticed that they've just balanced a couple of the
  beams without fastening them at all. I shall have a word to say to the
  foreman when I see him. It's not safe."</p>

  <p>The lawyer glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Dear me! I must be getting along. I'd like to come over again tomorrow,
  Clive, if I'm not too much of a nuisance, on the off chance of seeing Mr.
  Muller. Quite an exceptionally intelligent American&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Canadian," laughed Clive. "Come over to dinner tonight, Whitcombe, if
  you'd care to. Jerry is sure to be here this evening, and you can have a chat
  with him."</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;yes&mdash;I shall be delighted. But I must hurry back
  now. The post will be in, and a friend of mine is sending me some fresh
  newspaper cuttings about this case of&mdash;er&mdash;dear me&mdash;yes,
  good-bye, Mrs. Clive, for the present. I'm looking forward to criticizing the
  dinner tonight." He pushed the flower in his buttonhole.
  "Charming&mdash;exquisite!" he smiled, picked up his attach case, and
  hurried out.</p>

  <p>Clive followed him, and as soon as the door was closed O'Ryan went eagerly
  across the room to where Nita stood by the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"Nita, did he say anything?"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Say anything? Who?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Clive, of course. I saw him talking to you."</p>

  <p>"Then presumably he did say something."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, Nita, don't start in with cheap sarcasm. All things
  considered, it's rather bad taste. There's nothing to laugh at, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"I'm not laughing. I don't feel in the least like laughing," she said.</p>

  <p>"Did he give you any idea that he&mdash;well, did he tell you
  <i>anything?</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;that concerns you."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell him&mdash;I mean, did you talk about the Laffan or
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"I believe we did mention the Laffan."</p>

  <p>"And did you convince him&mdash;I mean, if you did as I told you&mdash;led
  him on to think that you are his and that sort of thing.... Things seemed to
  be going fairly well, I thought. I was watching&mdash;from behind the
  ramblers&mdash;and I could see you were pulling it off all right. I mean,
  sitting there and holding your hand and pitting his arm round you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank!"</p>

  <p>She was white to the lips, facing him with blazing eyes. He stared at her
  in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"What have I said now? You're the queerest woman I've ever struck. One
  minute you're as right as rain, and the next you're up in the air spitting
  sparks like a rocket. I only want to know how you got on with Selby
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're terribly afraid of Selby, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Well, Dennis Sanderby is not the sort of man I'm anxious to meet in a
  country lane on a dark night, if that's what you mean. But never mind that.
  Did you convince him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that either. I thought I had, once, but I'm not sure." She
  frowned thoughtfully. "A ruthless man, pursuing his inexorable way, unmoved
  by pity, not to be turned aside from his purpose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That was the bit old Whitcombe read, wasn't it? You think that's right,
  Nita? I mean, you know Selby and can size him up better than I can. Do you
  really believe that's true of him&mdash;that once he gets an idea fixed in
  his head nothing will turn him from it? Do you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for God's sake, Frank! How do I know what he was thinking? I only
  wish I did! But I don't, so it's no use plaguing me with idiotic questions.
  If you want to know what he thought about it, ask him yourself."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan turned away with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Damned helpful, aren't you?" he said peevishly. "I'm hanged if I know
  what's come over you. You've scarcely a civil word Hullo! Where did this come
  from?" He stooped, picked up a slip of paper from the floor, and stood gazing
  at it intently.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"A newspaper cutting," he told her. "Old Whitcombe must have dropped it."
  He turned it over. "From the <i>Edmonton Star</i>."</p>

  <p>"A cutting&mdash;about what?"</p>

  <p>"What would it be about?" he grinned. "What does old Whitcombe dream
  about, talk about in his sleep, chatter about at breakfast, lunch, tea, and
  dinner? The Sanderby case, of course. When he dies they'll find 'Dennis
  Sanderby' graven on his heart. Shall I read it?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Bit of somebody's evidence, apparently. Listen: 'She saw Mrs. Sanderby
  the morning before she died. She told witness that her husband had been very
  nice to her and had brought her a piece of jewelry from Edmonton.'"</p>

  <p>He paused and glanced across at the girl. She was standing rigid, her
  hands clenched, her lips set, staring at him. With a shrug he turned again to
  the slip of paper in his hand.</p>

  <p>"'She thought it was from a jeweller's store near the Hudson's Bay
  Company. She&mdash;Mrs. Sanderby&mdash;told witness that she thought she had
  regained her husband's confidence at last. They were going to share the same
  room again. That night she was taken ill'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">"FRANK!"</p>

  <p>He had a queer sensation that the word came hurtling at him across the
  room, that it actually struck him a physical blow which shook him and made
  him catch his breath. He stopped abruptly in his reading and glanced at Nita.
  She was still standing there, like a statue, her lips tightly compressed,
  staring at him fixedly. There was a look in her eyes that almost frightened
  him. He did not want to look at them, but somehow they held his glance,
  compelling him to look.</p>

  <p>He laughed nervously.</p>

  <p>"Pretty ghastly, Nita&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>She made no answer, and he shifted uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Giving you the jim-jams?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her lips parted, but still she did not speak.</p>

  <p>"Good sensational stuff for the newspaper, but not particularly cheerful
  reading for us in the circumstances, is it? Still, the more we know about his
  methods&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He wrenched his eyes away from hers and glanced again at the slip of paper
  in his hand. "Where was I? Oh, yes, here we are: '&mdash;shared the same
  room. That night she was taken ill '"</p>

  <p>"Don't read it!"</p>

  <p>It was a command, a warning, a threat; a supplication, too. Again he
  looked at her.</p>

  <p>"Don't read it!" she repeated. He frowned and made an impatient
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Nita. Why the deuce shouldn't I read it?"</p>

  <p>"Because I say so." She stepped swiftly towards him and held out her hand.
  "Give it to me."</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, don't be so childish," he said. "And, for heaven's sake,
  don't start getting tragic. If you don't want to be taken ill like the late
  lamented Mrs. Sanderby, you'll set your teeth and face facts, and learn as
  much as possible about the sort of thing you're up against."</p>

  <p>Suddenly her hand shot out, the slip of paper was whipped from his grasp,
  and she was tearing it across and across. She turned from him, tossed the
  fragments into the waste-paper basket, and then swung round and faced
  him.</p>

  <p>"Frank&mdash;you beast!" Her cheeks were flushed now, her lips quivering,
  her eyes moist.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Nita, what's wrong with you?"</p>

  <p>She turned from him again, seated herself on the couch, and covered her
  face with her hands. He went to her and stood gazing down at her with
  bewildered eyes.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Nita, I'm hanged if I understand."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't!"</p>

  <p>"Not sufficiently intelligent?"</p>

  <p>"Not sufficiently&mdash;decent." She uncovered her face. "Oh, don't stand
  there looking pained and puzzled!" she exclaimed. "If you can't see how foul
  you are, then God help you! Shall I tell you? That man Sanderby&mdash;kind,
  pleasant, suave&mdash;making up his quarrel with his wife, giving her
  presents, making love to her, agreeing to share the same room&mdash;and it
  was all lies&mdash;foulness, beastliness.... You thought so, didn't you, when
  you read that Dennis Sanderby had done it?"</p>

  <p>"Nita," he said sharply, "pull yourself together. The man <i>was</i> foul.
  If you can think of anything fouler&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And that's what you asked me to do with Selby!" she interrupted
  furiously. "To do just what Sanderby did to his wife&mdash;-lie to him, lure
  him on, play on his passion, shed every bit of decency you've let me keep.
  And you see nothing beastly in that! You don't understand what's the matter
  with me! I'm his wife, and it's my duty to my husband! And my duty to you,
  eh, Frank? Because you were generous enough to offer me a sordid, back-stairs
  intrigue in some sordid, backstreet flat, you take it for granted that I'll
  fall in with any filthy scheme you may suggest to save you a little
  unpleasantness. You think so much of me, love me so beautifully, that you're
  willing to let me ... Love! My God!" She made a hopeless, despairing gesture.
  "It's no use talking to you, Frank. You'll never understand."</p>

  <p>Her hands went back to her face, and for some moments he stood gazing down
  at her with anxious eyes. Then:</p>

  <p>"I say, Nita, you're not&mdash;not in love with Selby, are
  you?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mind your own damned business!"</p>

  <p>"You always led me to believe you didn't care a hang about him."</p>

  <p>"You always led me to believe that you cared quite a lot about me."</p>

  <p>"So I do. Hang it! I've got myself into a pretty bad mess on your account,
  anyway. And now, when I ask you to lend a hand to get me out of it, you just
  sit there and spit venom. You're a hypocrite, Nita, and the grouse is all on
  my side, really. If you're in love with Selby, it was a mean sort of trick to
  lead me right up the garden&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She got up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"We won't discuss Selby, please. What did Sir Ralph say about the
  carnations?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell! What did he say about the carnations? I don't know what he
  said. He just blithered on; I didn't listen to him. Look here, I'm just about
  fed up with all this; I'm going back to town&mdash;tonight."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I should if I were you. Telephone to Aldershot."</p>

  <p>"Aldershot?" he echoed, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"They might lend you an armoured car."</p>

  <p>"That's pretty cheap," he sneered. "I can't make you out, Nita; I've never
  known you like this before."</p>

  <p>"And I've just realized, Frank, that I've never known you at all before.
  Funny, isn't it? As far as I remember, you weren't a particularly
  objectionable little boy. The only thing I really didn't like about you was
  that you always expected someone else to do your dirty work. Remember the old
  gentleman in the next-door garden who used to chase us with a stick if we
  went over the wall to fetch our ball? And if you sent the ball over, you
  always wanted me to go after it. That sort of meanness is bound to crop up
  again later on in life, I suppose. I often used to wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I'm wondering?" he interrupted. "I'm wondering how I
  ever came to make such a fool of myself over you."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know?" she said quietly. "I can tell you that: you made a fool
  of yourself over me because you thought it would help you to get that
  lease."</p>

  <p>His face flushed angrily.</p>

  <p>"Look here, if you're suggesting that I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came a rap on the door, and Lane, with a long envelope in his hand,
  entered.</p>

  <p>"There's a district messenger from London, madam," he said. "He has
  brought this for Mr. Clive." He handed her the envelope and went out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"I say, Nita!"</p>

  <p>She was examining the envelope, turning it over and over.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what's that?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know. It's for Selby&mdash;a letter of some sort." She
  tossed it onto the writing desk. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"I wondered whether&mdash;I mean, Selby said he told Muller it was
  urgent&mdash;and he might have got it registered and sent it down at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the lease!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you&mdash;open it and see?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It's addressed to Selby."</p>

  <p>"But I don't suppose he'd mind." He went to the desk, picked up the
  envelope, and inspected it closely. "I say, Nita, it is!" he exclaimed
  eagerly. "There's the seal here&mdash;the Canadian Government Office&mdash;on
  the back. This is the lease, right enough&mdash;what luck! That's got Mr.
  Dennis Sanderby beaten!"</p>

  <p>With a smile of satisfaction he pulled open his coat and was about to slip
  the envelope into his breast pocket when the girl's voice made him pause.</p>

  <p>"Frank!"</p>

  <p>As he looked quickly across at her and saw the expression on her face, his
  self-satisfied smile faded.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Put that envelope down."</p>

  <p>"Eh? Don't be silly! This is my chance. I've been hanging about all this
  time, risking God knows what, waiting to get hold of the lease, and now I've
  got it I'm off. I'm not spending another hour in this infernal house."</p>

  <p>"Put that envelope down, Frank."</p>

  <p>"But you're crazy! If you expect me to miss an opportunity like
  this&mdash;I'm not missing it, and that's flat. I'm off, and once I'm away
  Dennis Sanderby can do what he likes. If you've any sense left, you'll come
  with me."</p>

  <p>He thrust the envelope into his pocket and moved towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Frank!"</p>

  <p>She said it very quietly, and as he glanced at her, with his hand on the
  door knob, he saw that she was faintly smiling&mdash;a queer, hard sort of
  smile. She shook her head slowly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she said; "it's not quite so simple as that. Either you put that
  envelope back on the desk, or I shall call Selby and tell him."</p>

  <p>He stared at her aghast.</p>

  <p>"I mean it," she went on. "Of course, I know what you're going to say to
  me&mdash;that not so long ago I was willing to do just what you want to do
  now, that I even searched Selby's desk to find the lease so that you could
  take it and clear out and take me with you. But quite a lot has happened
  since then, and I'm not going to argue with you about it. And I'm not going
  to let you walk out of the house with a million dollars of Selby's money in
  your pocket. Still, try it if you like; Selby is only in the garden."</p>

  <p>"Nita, you wouldn't&mdash;I know you'd never dare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you go?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated and then took several steps towards her, gazing at her
  intently.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he breathed. "I believe you mean it! Of all the mean, low-down
  twisters&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She waved a hand, still faintly smiling, towards the desk.</p>

  <p>"Where you found it, please, Frank."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but it's mine," he protested. "Selby intends to give it to
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then let him," she broke in. "If he chooses to be that sort of a fool,
  that's his own affair. But you're not going to take it and slink off without
  his knowing." He stood for some moments hesitating, glaring at her angrily;
  and then he took the envelope from his pocket and flung it on the desk.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Nita!" he exclaimed furiously. "It'll serve you right
  if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She had crossed to the mantelpiece, and now she pressed the bell-push.</p>

  <p>"All right, Frank," she said quietly; "say just whatever you feel like
  saying. I've had my say, and it's your turn. But whatever you may say, I'm
  not going to let you get away with that lease unless Selby himself gives it
  to you."</p>

  <p>"A sudden spasm of honesty?" he sneered.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Or are you thinking of turning King's Evidence? That won't come off,
  Nita, you can take it from me. If you're hoping to get into Selby's good
  books by telling him I tried to take the lease&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door opened and Lane came in.</p>

  <p>"You rang, madam?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Mr. O'Ryan will be leaving tonight."</p>

  <p>For a moment O'Ryan was too surprised to speak. "He'll be going to the
  station in the Packard, Lane."</p>

  <p>"Very good, madam."</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;er&mdash;not absolutely sure, you know, Nita," began O'Ryan,
  but she cut him short.</p>

  <p>"See that the car is at the door at six, please, Lane." As the door closed
  behind the servant, O'Ryan turned angrily to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "I'm not going to be bullied and ordered about like
  a school kid. I'll go when I see fit to go. If you refuse to let me take the
  lease, it stands to reason that I can't go until Selby hands it over to me.
  Why the deuce you need interfere ... Why, you needn't know I've taken it. He
  would never suspect that you had anything to do with it. As a matter of fact,
  he doesn't even know yet that the lease has arrived, and if I went
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's no use, Frank," she interrupted with a shake of the head. "You're
  not taking it, and that's final. But you said you were going, and you are
  going&mdash;at six o'clock, in the Packard. If you're nervous of a car you
  can walk."</p>

  <p>"But why on earth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because I want you to go&mdash;that's the reason. I want to have this out
  alone. You asked me just now whether I'm in love with Selby. Well, I think I
  am. I'm not going to argue with you about that or try to explain it. I'm not
  sure that I can explain it to myself. But I'm quite sure that I don't want
  you here any longer."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think that if I clear out Dennis Sanderby may call off the
  vendetta?"</p>

  <p>"I'm telling you to go&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>"But," he protested, "how can I? How can I possibly explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell a few more lies for you to Selby."</p>

  <p>"And what about the lease?"</p>

  <p>Before she could reply, her husband came in from the garden.</p>

  <p>"They're doing wonderful work out there," he laughed. "I saw three men
  working at the same time on the pergola, and there are only nine of them on
  the job."</p>

  <p>Nita waved a hand towards his writing desk.</p>

  <p>"There's a letter for you there, Selby," she said. "It arrived a few
  minutes ago&mdash;by special messenger."</p>

  <p>He nodded, picked up the envelope and examined it. "From Jerry," he said.
  "He told me he'd make them get a move on." He held up the envelope and smiled
  across at O'Ryan. "You know what this is?" He opened the envelope, took out a
  document, and began glancing through it, while O'Ryan stood watching him
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I say, sir, is that&mdash;is that the lease?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's the lease all right&mdash;signed, sealed, and delivered. Almost
  delivered, anyway." He folded the document, returned it to its envelope and
  tossed it onto the writing desk. "I want to have a chat with you about this
  syndicate of yours, O'Ryan," he said. "Jerry will be back this evening, and
  we might all three have a talk after dinner."</p>

  <p>"Frank won't be here after dinner," said Nita. "He has to be in town this
  evening. I've ordered the car for him for six o'clock."</p>

  <p>Clive looked at O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" he said. "What have you got to go to town for?"</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact," began O'Ryan awkwardly, "it isn't really
  terribly important. You see, my&mdash;er&mdash;my old school is having its
  annual dinner, and I'm expected to be there."</p>

  <p>He glanced at Nita doubtfully. She smiled.</p>

  <p>"And Frank is such a distinguished Old Boy," she said, "that he can't
  possibly stay away. The dinner would be terribly flat without him. Do you
  have to make a speech, Frank? You can make quite amusing speeches when you're
  in the right mood."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan frowned sullenly.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, sir, I've only just remembered that the dinner is
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"Then miss it," urged Clive. "They can do very well without you," he
  added, slapping him on the shoulder. "I'm not letting you off this evening;
  you're staying here."</p>

  <p>"But if he has promised to go, Selby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose it would be the first time he has broken a promise.
  Besides, he hasn't promised. He has only just remembered it. And I
  particularly want him here tonight. I've got a little surprise for him.
  Perhaps two."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan smiled rather sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"That's very kind of you, sir, and of course, if you wish it, I can give
  the dinner a miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can't, Frank," interrupted Nita. "You must go. I'd rather you
  went."</p>

  <p>Clive's eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"Really! That's not very gracious, darling."</p>

  <p>Nita was desperate now.</p>

  <p>"Well, he must go, Selby. He has promised, and it isn't fair to expect him
  to disappoint his friends."</p>

  <p>"Send them a wire, O'Ryan," suggested Selby, "like you do to an actor on
  his first night&mdash;hoping for the best and fearing the worst. It's usually
  the worst that happens, too."</p>

  <p>For a few moments O'Ryan hesitated, looking doubtfully across at Nita.</p>

  <p>"All right, sir, I'll do that," he said. "If you're quite sure my staying
  here won't be inconvenient&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As far as I'm concerned, it will be most convenient," his host assured
  him. "And it doesn't matter to you, Nita, does it?"</p>

  <p>She turned away with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, it doesn't matter to me," she said listlessly. "Nothing
  matters."</p>

  <p>Again her husband shot her a serious glance.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you're tired, my dear," he said. "You don't look quite
  yourself, either. I've thought so ever since you got back from Scotland.
  Don't you agree, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;yes&mdash;I think she does look rather tired, sir," agreed the
  young man. "Perhaps that accident with the car&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I noticed it before that," Selby interrupted. "When she arrived yesterday
  morning she looked so fagged out that I found it difficult to believe she
  hadn't been travelling all night. Yet she had had a good night's rest at the
  Laffan."</p>

  <p>Nita turned abruptly towards him.</p>

  <p>"For goodness' sake, Selby," she said irritably, "please stop discussing
  me."</p>

  <p>Her husband smiled.</p>

  <p>"That's more like your old self, my dear," he laughed. "Very well, O'Ryan
  and I won't talk about you any more; we'll get right down to business
  instead." He turned again to O'Ryan. "Now, about this lease. I'll look it
  over, and you can have it tonight if everything is satisfactory. You've
  arranged the finances, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I had, sir," replied the other. "But just at the last moment
  one man has backed out. It has put me in rather a difficulty."</p>

  <p>"The man at Windsor? I had an idea that he wasn't to be relied on. How
  much was he supposed to be putting up?"</p>

  <p>"Three thousand," said O'Ryan. "Of course, it isn't a vast sum."</p>

  <p>"But you can't raise it yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; I'm afraid I can't."</p>

  <p>Selby Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll talk about it later. I had an idea that situation might
  arise." He glanced again at Nita, saw that she was sitting in the corner of
  the Chesterfield with her face buried in her hands, and went quickly to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Nita!"</p>

  <p>She started and raised her head.</p>

  <p>"You're not feeling ill?"</p>

  <p>"No, Selby."</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, please don't fuss!" she begged. "I'm not ill. There's nothing
  whatever the matter with me."</p>

  <p>He stood for some moments gazing at her anxiously. "In the opinion of a
  mere husband, my dear," he said, "you're in sad need of a good strong tonic.
  Something with arsenic in it."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Selby; but the mere husband is wrong. I don't want any medicine
  at all."</p>

  <p>"Arsenic," he repeated. "It's the finest pick-me-up in the world."</p>

  <p>"I won't have it!" she interrupted impatiently. "I don't want to be picked
  up&mdash;not in that way, anyhow." She forced herself to smile. "It sounds
  too much like being picked up by a golden chariot&mdash;out of the
  world."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll see about it," said Clive, turning from her and crossing to
  his desk. "You may not like the idea of a tonic, my dear, but I may decide
  that it's my duty as a husband to see that you have one." He picked up the
  lease and flourished it at O'Ryan. "I'll put this in a safe place," he said,
  "until you and I have got things settled."</p>

  <p>He went out, and Nita sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Frank, you fool!" she exclaimed. "Why are you staying?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I? I've every reason for staying, haven't I? He's going to
  hand over the lease to me this evening."</p>

  <p>"If you're capable of raising a hand to take it. It's as well to remember
  that. Can't you see what he's doing? You saw it quite clearly a few hours
  ago, and now, because you've set eyes on the lease, I suppose, and think he
  really means to give it to you, you've forgotten that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've forgotten nothing," he interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Then you're crazy," she told him. "It's obvious what he's doing;
  everything he does and everything he says shrieks it at you. He's just
  playing you like a man plays a salmon&mdash;giving you line and reeling you
  in&mdash;and if you haven't taken leave of your senses you'll break the line
  before you're gaffed. You'll go&mdash;now&mdash;at once&mdash;before he gets
  another chance&mdash;to your Old Boys' dinner or&mdash;oh, any old excuse
  will do as long as you get away from here."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan smiled.</p>

  <p>"Frightfully touching, darling, this sudden solicitude. But if I'm in
  danger, so are you, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"That's my affair. But I don't want&mdash;if anything should happen to
  you&mdash;I couldn't bear to think that he ... But it's no use trying to
  explain. Do as I ask you, and leave me to cope with this alone. In case
  you're really anxious about me, I can quite well look after myself."</p>

  <p>"So can I, Nita," he said. "Look at this." He pulled from his pocket a
  small revolver and showed it to her. "If Mr. Dennis Sanderby tries any
  tricks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"Would that have helped you when the steering gear failed?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that!" he said easily, slipping the revolver into his pocket. "After
  all, that may have been an accident."</p>

  <p>"You didn't think so at the time. I don't suppose you think so now really.
  If you really believe it was an accident, why be frightened of Selby? And if
  you're not frightened of Selby, why the revolver?" She frowned thoughtfully.
  "I don't think there can be much doubt," she said, "that there is silver on
  that land. I mean, of course, that you know that there's silver there."</p>

  <p>"I've told you, Nita, there's always a chance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I know what you've told me," she cut in, "but it's a pretty big
  chance, isn't it? You're not the sort to risk what you're risking for
  anything that's far short of a certainty. It's the silver that's making you
  so brave, Frank. I see that now. You must have that lease even if you do have
  to stay on here and spend your time sweating with fear, with your hand on
  your revolver&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's no need to be offensive about it," he snapped. "If I think it's
  worth it, that's my business. Besides, we've probably exaggerated the whole
  thing. I mean, suppose he was implicated in that Canadian affair&mdash;he may
  have been perfectly innocent. Old Whitcombe said that they could prove
  nothing against him and had to let him off, and you don't get acquitted on
  that sort of charge unless the case is pretty weak against you. And even if
  he did slaughter his whole family, it's hardly likely that he'd attempt the
  same kind of thing again, is it?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"All very comforting, if you can really bring yourself to believe it. And
  you do believe it? Why, of course you do! Hence the revolver! I wonder if
  you'd ever have the pluck to fire it. Do you know what I believe Selby would
  do if you threatened him with a revolver?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care, anyway."</p>

  <p>"I believe he'd laugh," she told him. "He hasn't an enormous sense of
  humour, but even he would be obliged to laugh at that. You'd look so terribly
  funny, Frank&mdash;not quite sure whether you were more afraid of the
  revolver than of Selby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dry up, for God's sake!" he exclaimed savagely. "I can't understand
  you. You don't seem able to see a single decent point about me nowadays, and
  you do nothing but make yourself as offensive as you can. And to think I
  kidded myself that I wanted your love!"</p>

  <p>"Did you?" She shook her head. "You did nothing of the sort. You never
  wanted my love and never even kidded yourself you did. That's the humiliating
  part about the whole wretched affair. You wanted the lease."</p>

  <p>"That's a pretty beastly sort of thing to say."</p>

  <p>"It's time we faced the truth, however beastly. You made me think that you
  wanted my love, but you never deceived yourself. I thought, too, that your
  love was worth having, that it was worth sacrificing everything for; but I
  realize now that all I really wanted was a rather cheap sort of thrill, and I
  probably deserved just what I got. I should have known better, understood you
  better, recognized that your love showed all the signs of a cheap fake. The
  signs were fairly obvious, weren't they? For years you didn't come near me;
  and then the question of this land came up, and you found that it belonged to
  Selby, and it struck you as a very bright idea that, as I was Selby's wife,
  you could probably make use of me."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what sort of a swine you must think me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the same sort as I think myself," she interrupted, going towards the
  French windows. "Just a mean little swine, Frank."</p>

  <p>At the windows she paused.</p>

  <p>"Please go," she said.</p>

  <p>"Afraid Selby will hurt me? But I don't matter a hang to you now, so why
  worry about me?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was very low as she answered:</p>

  <p>"I'm not thinking of you, Frank."</p>

  <p>"Afraid I may hurt Selby, then?" he grinned, tapping his pocket
  significantly. "I'd be terribly sorry to have to do it, just when you're
  growing so fond of him. But you needn't worry too much about that, either; I
  won't hurt him unless I'm obliged to."</p>

  <p>"I'm not even worried about that," she said. "I'm afraid you won't
  understand, but why I want you to go is that I&mdash;I don't
  want&mdash;Selby&mdash;to hurt himself." She turned abruptly and went into
  the garden. She had some vague idea of finding her husband and seeing if she
  could persuade him to give O'Ryan the lease at once and let him go. But Selby
  was not in the garden, and for some time she wandered round the paths,
  pausing every now and then to admire the flowers or nip off a dead blossom,
  hardly realizing what she was doing.</p>

  <p>She had finished with Frank, anyway, she told herself. In the last few
  minutes she had definitely made that clear both to him and to herself. The
  last lingering wisps of glamour had been swept away from that affair, and it
  stood revealed in all its repelling crudeness. She was surprised and
  humiliated by the thought that she had allowed herself to be deceived by the
  glamour and had not from the first recognized it for what it really was. She
  was puzzled to understand how she had ever come to consider Frank as a
  possible substitute for Selby, how she could ever seriously have thought of
  abandoning her husband and all he stood for in her life, why she had not from
  the first suspected that, when Frank so suddenly reappeared on the scene, he
  had done so with the definite purpose of making use of her to do his dirty
  work for him&mdash;just as in the past he had made use of her to climb the
  wall to recover the ball and risk an encounter with the old gentleman with a
  stick. Selby or Frank? She must have been mad ever to imagine that there
  could be any question as to whom she should choose.</p>

  <p>And now that the choice lay between Frank and Dennis Sanderby, was there
  still any doubt? She forced herself to face that question. She reminded
  herself of all she knew concerning Dennis Sanderby, and asked herself
  whether, in face of all that, she could still honestly say that there was no
  question of a choice between them. Since she now knew that Selby was Dennis
  Sanderby, did he still stand for all those things in her life which were most
  worth preserving? The episode with Frank was definitely over. She was glad of
  that: it meant one less problem to be solved, one less decision to be made.
  She knew now beyond any further question that, whatever might happen, she
  would never go with Frank, and she could rule that possibility out of her
  calculations. But should she, in view of what she had learned, leave
  Selby?</p>

  <p>She had no doubt as to what most people would advise. Knowing what she now
  knew, she would be more than justified in leaving him; realizing, as she now
  did, the risk she ran in staying at Sunningbourne Lodge, she would be idiotic
  to remain there an hour longer. Either she should go, they would say, or she
  should tell Selby what she had discovered and have the whole thing out with
  him.</p>

  <p>Yet she felt strangely reluctant to take either the one course or the
  other. Certainly she did not want to go, and just as certainly she could not
  picture herself facing Selby over the mystery of his past, admitting to him
  that she believed him to be a criminal who had changed his name.... She
  dismissed the idea as impossible. Besides, the question of his past was quite
  beside the point. She had told Frank that she believed she loved Selby, and
  if that was true, the fact that he was Dennis Sanderby, with that
  individual's past, did not enter into the question. Love, surely, took no
  account of past or future. If she loved Selby she loved him for what he was
  now; and what he had been twenty years ago&mdash;long before she had even
  known of him&mdash;could make no difference to her love. That, at any rate,
  was her idea of love. Frank, of course, would laugh at that; and he would
  certainly call her crazy if she told him that, even if the catch-pit had been
  intended for a less innocent purpose than collecting water, if the breakdown
  of the steering gear had not been accidental, if there had been a very good
  reason why Selby had poured the cream on the flower bed&mdash;to kill the
  weeds&mdash;and been at such pains to wash out the cream jug &mdash;even if
  all these things were given their worst possible interpretation, not even
  that could affect her love. Frank would never understand that love was
  inevitable, ineluctable, unaffected by expediency. If she loved at all, that
  would be the nature of her love. And she had told Frank that she might easily
  love Selby, that she thought she did love him....</p>

  <p>O'Ryan, at any rate, must go. Whatever else might still be hazy, that fact
  stood out clear-cut. She must somehow persuade him into going&mdash;frighten
  him into going&mdash;get him somehow beyond the reach of Dennis
  Sanderby&mdash;"a ruthless man, pursuing his inexorable way, unmoved by pity,
  not to be turned aside from his purpose." For Dennis Sanderby had become
  Selby Clive&mdash;her husband&mdash;and she could not bear the thought that
  he should again become Dennis Sanderby. "Unmoved by pity." But unmoved, too,
  by love? She wondered....</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">AS Nita went across the garden, O'Ryan stood watching her,
  frowning, saw her pause by a rose bush and stoop to smell one of the blooms,
  and turned impatiently away. He was not without experience of women&mdash;no
  man who was totally inexperienced could have brought Nita Clive to the point
  of sending that telegram&mdash;and it was just that inconsequent way of
  carrying on, he reflected, which he could not stand. Smelling
  roses&mdash;now! And when he had been desperately anxious for her to tell him
  how things had gone in her interview with Clive, she had wanted to know what
  that old fool Whitcombe had said about her carnations! Didn't she realize how
  matters stood, or didn't she care?</p>

  <p>But it was no use trying to discover what she, or any other woman, thought
  or felt. You could never be certain of them. He would not have dreamed that
  Nita would round on him like that, but she had done it&mdash;first at the
  Laffan, and now over the lease&mdash;refusing to let him take it, threatening
  to tell Clive, suddenly shying at what, only a few hours ago, she had been
  quite ready to do; telling him to go and leave her there, when only yesterday
  she had jumped down his throat for even hinting that he might clear out. But
  yesterday she had been scared&mdash;just as scared as he had been&mdash;and
  today she did not seem nearly so terrified&mdash;not at all, in fact. Since
  she had had that talk with Clive she had seemed calmer, cooler. He smiled
  wryly. She was cooler towards him, anyway. He could call that episode
  definitely closed, he supposed, catalogue it among his rare failures as a
  case which could only be explained by assuming a sudden access of virtue.</p>

  <p>But was that the only possible explanation? Nita had changed so suddenly.
  It was not his unfortunate blunder during dinner at the Laffan that had
  caused her to swing round so completely and range herself against him. She
  had, as a result of that, slammed the door in his face, but he knew enough
  about slammed doors to realize that they can be coaxed open again, and that
  the door that is most furiously slammed is usually the most readily reopened,
  and he had felt confident that the Laffan affair could be smoothed over and
  would prove to be only a temporary setback. It was something, he felt, other
  than that which had induced Nita to change sides, or, if she had not actually
  done that, to refuse to side any longer with him. She had been different to
  him after that talk with Clive this morning, about which she had been so
  reluctant to tell him anything. Suppose she had told her husband....</p>

  <p>It was a disturbing thought and set him restlessly pacing the room, his
  hands thrust into his trouser pockets and cigarette glowing constantly. She
  might have done it. She was terribly scared of what might be going to happen
  to her next, and she might easily have lost her nerve and told Clive
  everything, trusting that confession might get her off the consequences. It
  didn't seem likely that Dennis Sanderby would be put off by a confession, but
  you never knew. If Nita had somehow persuaded him that her story was
  true&mdash;pitched a yarn, perhaps, in which he figured as a gay Lothario
  with a touch of Rasputin, and she as an innocent maiden who was terribly
  shocked at his wickedness&mdash;and if, as a result, they had patched things
  up between them, that would explain her sudden change of front. It would
  explain, at any rate, why she would not let him take the lease and clear out
  when he had the chance. She was working, perhaps, with Clive now, planning
  his punishment, keeping him here until her husband had a chance ...</p>

  <p>But that wasn't likely, because she had begged him to go. She had seemed
  very anxious just now that he should get away at once before anything could
  happen. Perhaps she knew what Clive was planning, knew what was in store for
  him if he persisted in staying, was trying to give him a hint, to do him a
  good turn without openly betraying Clive's newly won confidence in
  her....</p>

  <p>He glanced round the room, and then, crossing to the fireplace, rang the
  bell and continued his pacing. If he stayed on here&mdash;and he must stay on
  until he had his hands on that lease&mdash;he would have to be damnably
  careful&mdash;watch Clive&mdash;Nita, too, perhaps. If she had turned
  spiteful ...</p>

  <p>As Lane came in, O'Ryan paused in his pacing.</p>

  <p>"Bring me a drink, Lane, will you?" he said. "A whisky-and-soda."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir." He crossed to a small corner cupboard and took out a
  decanter of whisky, a glass, and a siphon of soda, and set them on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"There is always whisky in this cupboard, sir," he said. "Mr. Clive keeps
  a decanter here for visitors."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan picked up the decanter, removed the glass stopper, and sniffed at
  the neck, frowning.</p>

  <p>"A very good whisky, sir," remarked Lane, with an air of disapproval.</p>

  <p>O'Ryan held the decanter up to the light and peered at it for some
  moments.</p>

  <p>"How long has this been in the cupboard, Lane?"</p>

  <p>"A couple of days, sir, at the most," the servant informed him. "It was
  yesterday morning, as far as I remember, sir&mdash;just before you arrived.
  Mr. Clive told me to bring him a fresh bottle, and he filled the decanter
  himself."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan glanced at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"Does he usually&mdash;fill the decanter himself?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, sir, I can't remember that he has ever done it
  before."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan set down the decanter.</p>

  <p>"Can you get me an unopened bottle, Lane?" Lane's face showed his
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"It's never quite the same, you know," added O'Ryan hastily, "when it's
  been in a decanter for a few days, and if you have a fresh bottle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir&mdash;if you wish it," replied Lane reluctantly. "I will
  ask Mr. Clive for the key of the cellarette."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;if it means troubling Mr. Clive, it doesn't matter,
  Lane."</p>

  <p>As the man went out, O'Ryan tipped some whisky into the glass, splashed in
  some soda, picked up the glass, and peered into it suspiciously. Dipping in
  the tip of his finger, he touched his tongue with it and frowned.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Having a drink, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>It was Selby Clive, watching him, with an amused smile, from the French
  windows. O'Ryan set down his glass.</p>

  <p>"I was going to," he said, "but I&mdash;I don't think I will."</p>

  <p>"Something wrong with it? I saw you tasting it as if it were a dose of
  nasty medicine."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan laughed uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I was just trying&mdash;seeing if I could guess what brand it was."</p>

  <p>"You won't guess," Clive assured him. "It's a special brand of my
  own&mdash;rather potent stuff. Put that drink down and see how you like
  it."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, sir, but I'd rather not."</p>

  <p>"Afraid it might be too strong?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; it's just that I&mdash;I've lost my desire for it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I haven't," smiled Selby. He mixed himself a drink, picked up the
  glass, and held it up to the light.</p>

  <p>"I thought it looked&mdash;well, rather a queer colour, sir," said O'Ryan,
  "and it tasted a bit queer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Clive held out his glass.</p>

  <p>"Mine's all right," he said. "Try this one. It may have been something in
  the glass. Lane's a careless devil at times&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came a scream, a high, piercing scream of terror, from the garden,
  and Clive set down his glass with a bang.</p>

  <p>"Good God! What on earth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He went striding across the room, out through the French windows and onto
  the terrace. O'Ryan, with a scared look on his face, hesitated a moment and
  then went striding after him. And as he reached the terrace he saw Nita come
  running towards the house and pause at the foot of the terrace steps where
  Clive was standing. She was deathly pale; her hair was dishevelled; her dress
  was covered with dust. Her hands were opening and closing with quick,
  convulsive movements, and there was a wild look in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Selby&mdash;you devil!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He stepped towards her and grasped her arm. "Nita darling, what in the
  world has happened? You seem terribly distressed."</p>

  <p>She wrenched her arm free and stepped back from him. "Happened!" she
  exclaimed frantically. "You know what has happened&mdash;what you hoped would
  happen, what you planned should happen!"</p>

  <p>"Nita, my dear, try to calm yourself. I have no idea&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't lie, Selby! It's no use your lying to me any more. I understand
  now&mdash;everything&mdash;since I came back&mdash;everything you've said and
  done&mdash;nothing but lies&mdash;telling lies, acting lies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He grasped her arm again and, though she tried to free herself, held her
  fast.</p>

  <p>"Pull yourself together, Nita," he said sternly. "You don't know what
  you're saying. Pull yourself together and tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your trap!" she gasped. "I walked into your trap &mdash;as you intended
  that I should."</p>

  <p>"Trap?" he echoed.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;trap," she repeated. "I had no idea&mdash;I wasn't
  thinking&mdash;and a great beam of wood fell.... It missed me&mdash;just. If
  I hadn't stepped back it would have struck me&mdash;killed me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good God! The pergola! I told you it wasn't safe, didn't I? I warned you
  only this morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Warned me? Of course you warned me! You would, wouldn't you? That's part
  of your system. You warned the others, didn't you? But that didn't save them.
  You're too foully clever not to warn me. But you won't deceive me any more
  with that sort of hypocrisy."</p>

  <p>"Nita, what are you saying?"</p>

  <p>"I'm saying that you let me go out there&mdash;deliberately&mdash;knowing
  what was waiting for me, hoping that the trap would catch me, that you'd find
  me later on&mdash;crushed, with my head battered in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must be mad, Nita. I had no idea that you were going to the pergola.
  I left you in the library with O'Ryan. You're frightened, my dear, and don't
  realize what ghastly accusations you're making."</p>

  <p>"I'm not mad, Selby. I'm perfectly sane. And I know what I'm saying. I'm
  saying that you planned it all&mdash;prepared it all&mdash;tried to murder
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nita, don't be a fool!" It was O'Ryan's voice, and she swung round and
  faced him.</p>

  <p>"Mind your own business, Frank," she exclaimed. "This happened to me, not
  to you, and I know what I'm saying. I caught my foot in a wire&mdash;I wasn't
  thinking where I was going&mdash;and the whole thing fell."</p>

  <p>"But it was all an accident, Nita," urged O'Ryan soothingly. "You mustn't
  jump to the conclusion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Accident! My God, Frank, can't you see it now? The catch-pit, the car,
  and now this! And there's no knowing what other murderous schemes he has in
  his mind. And it may be your turn next, Frank. Don't forget that. You'd much
  better clear out at once&mdash;before it's too late."</p>

  <p>Clive dismissed O'Ryan with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Leave this to me, O'Ryan, please," he said.</p>

  <p>The other turned and hurried across the terrace into the house.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen to me, Nita," said her husband firmly. "You must go up to
  your room and lie down for a bit. I'm terribly sorry this has
  happened&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again she wrenched her arm free.</p>

  <p>"Sorry? Of course you're sorry&mdash;sorry your plan failed, sorry the
  beam didn't fall where you meant it to fall, sorry that I'm alive&mdash;not
  even hurt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But why should I hurt you, Nita? After all you said to me in the library
  this morning&mdash;how could I possibly want to hurt you? You made me very
  happy this morning&mdash;happier than I've been for many a long day."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Selby, don't go on lying!" she stormed. "That sort of
  thing won't work any longer. You tried to kill me. You tried yesterday, you
  tried again this morning. And now&mdash;now ... Oh, for heaven's sake, Selby,
  leave me&mdash;don't touch me&mdash;get out of my sight." She covered her
  face with her hands and stood there, trembling violently.</p>

  <p>Clive stood for some moments regarding her, his brow puckered, his lips
  set in a thin, straight line.</p>

  <p>"If I thought that you realized what you've been saying, Nita&mdash;" he
  began.</p>

  <p>"Oh, please go, Selby. I do realize."</p>

  <p>"That I tried to kill you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then you're stark mad!" he exclaimed angrily.
  "Mad&mdash;wicked&mdash;deliberately wicked. I refuse to listen to any more.
  And now pay attention to me. I've been patient enough&mdash;God
  knows!&mdash;but there are limits to my patience, and you have passed them.
  For nearly three years I've done everything in my power to make you happy,
  and had nothing in return but coldness, indifference, contempt, a sort of
  patronizing, sneering tolerance. Think back a bit, and you'll realize that
  what I'm saying is true. You told me yourself this morning that you'd been a
  mean little swine to me, and you never said a truer thing."</p>

  <p>Her shoulders heaved convulsively.</p>

  <p>"Please go!" she breathed, but he did not move.</p>

  <p>"I haven't complained," he went on. "I've endured it all, tried to take no
  notice, hoping that things might right themselves. I thought that we might
  eventually find some formula for happiness, but apparently that is out of the
  question, and we may as well face the fact that we have never been happy
  together and never shall be."</p>

  <p>"Selby, it isn't my fault."</p>

  <p>"And now you make this horrible accusation against me," he continued,
  disregarding her muttered interruption, "and I've reached the limit of my
  endurance. I know you're unbalanced, and you've said a great many things
  which no doubt you had no intention of saying, but it does not follow,
  because you did not mean to let them slip out, that you don't believe them to
  be true. You do believe them to be true. You have only said now what in your
  sane moments you have been thinking and have not dared to say, and if you can
  think me capable of the vile things you have suggested&mdash;" he made a
  quick, impatient gesture&mdash;"I'm through with you, Nita."</p>

  <p>She took her hands from her face, saw him suddenly turn from her abruptly
  and go striding away. For a few seconds she stood watching him as he went
  across the terrace towards the library. Selby was going&mdash;leaving
  her&mdash;she was losing him.... Again that sense of irreparable loss swept
  over her. She took a quick step forward, hesitated, opened her lips to call
  to him but found that she could not call. Selby was going, and she could not
  bear that he should go....</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as he stepped through the French windows into the library, her
  irresolution slipped from her. She ran up the steps, across the terrace, and
  into the room. He paused as she entered and turned to face her, his eyes
  cold, his lips grimly set.</p>

  <p>"Selby!"</p>

  <p>"I've nothing more to say, Nita."</p>

  <p>She stepped swiftly up to him and grasped his arm.</p>

  <p>"Selby, don't!" she implored. "Why do you do it? Why do you hate me? For
  God's sake, Selby, don't look at me like that. You've no reason to hate me,
  no reason to distrust me. I've never hurt you&mdash;never, Selby&mdash;never
  in all my life done anything&mdash;" She hid her face on his shoulder,
  clinging to him desperately, holding him, keeping him there, terrified lest
  she should feel him thrust her from him and see him go striding away from her
  again.</p>

  <p>For some moments he stood motionless, frowning, with doubt and
  bewilderment in his eyes. And then slowly the frown faded, the grimness left
  his lips, his arm pressed her close to him, and he was stroking her hair,
  touching her cheek, trying to raise her head and look into her face.</p>

  <p>"Steady, my dear!" he said gently. "Take it easy. You've had a bigger
  shock than I imagined, and your nerves are all to pieces."</p>

  <p>She glanced up at his face and saw that he was smiling down at
  her&mdash;that wistful smile of his that always made her feel so ashamed of
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Selby, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're going upstairs to your room," he said firmly, "and you're going to
  lie down and try to sleep. An hour's sleep will work wonders. Come along! I'm
  going to tuck you up."</p>

  <p>He took her arm and led her from the room, and she went without protest,
  glad of his support as they mounted the stairs, limp, listless, terribly
  helpless. As they reached the door of her room, however, she made an effort
  and withdrew her arm.</p>

  <p>"All right, Selby&mdash;thanks&mdash;I shall be all right now." She opened
  the door, slipped inside, and closed it hastily. Then she shot the little
  silver bolt, flung herself onto the bed, and buried her face in the
  pillow.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">NITA did not sleep. For a long time she lay there
  motionless, conscious only of a terrible weariness. She had a strange feeling
  of isolation, as if all links between herself and the outer world had been
  snapped and only she and her weariness existed. Nothing mattered except that
  she should stay where she was and be called upon to make no effort, either
  physical or mental.</p>

  <p>It was only gradually that sensation returned to her and memory began to
  seep back into her mind&mdash;a drop here, a drop there, unconnected at first
  and conveying no meaning to her: that beam crashing to the ground within an
  inch of her&mdash;Frank slipping the lease into his pocket&mdash;Selby
  sitting on the back of the couch with that wistful smile on his
  lips&mdash;Selby, grim, ruthless, angry, telling her that he had done with
  her, turning from her, striding across the terrace&mdash;out of her
  life....</p>

  <p>Slowly the little drops crept together, amalgamated, and formed a stream
  of memory that flowed steadily through her mind. She still lay there,
  watching it flow by with only a languid sort of interest, until it bore into
  her thoughts that scene with Selby in the garden; and then she stirred
  uneasily and suddenly sat upright, pressing the palms of her hands against
  her temples. What had she done? All those wild words that fear had sent
  rushing from her lips, all those hideous accusations&mdash;what had Selby
  thought of them? Had he taken them seriously? Had he really meant it when he
  had said that he was through with her?</p>

  <p>She got off the bed and glanced at her watch. She was surprised to find
  how late it was; she must have lain there for hours. She had a dim
  recollection now of having twice heard a soft tap on her door. Selby, she
  supposed, come to see if she was all right; but she had been too weary, too
  detached from everything, to feel any interest at the time. Just as well. She
  could not have faced him just then. But she would have to face him. At
  dinner, she supposed. She would have to nerve herself to it somehow. She must
  know what he was thinking, what he was intending, how far he had taken her
  outburst seriously, whether she had really lost him.</p>

  <p>She crossed to the window and stood gazing across the landscape spread out
  below her. It was bathed in the soft evening sunshine, but away to the
  northeast a huge mass of black cloud hung, sullen and ominous, in the sky;
  and as she gazed at it a vivid streak flashed from it and was gone. They were
  having a storm, she reflected, in London. She could see the rain falling over
  there, streaming down like diaphanous drapery from the cloud. They would get
  it here at Sunningbourne later, no doubt. Selby would be glad of that: the
  garden, he said, needed rain; and it would be a good test of his catch-pit.
  It was ghastly the way her head was aching&mdash;as if an iron band encircled
  it, growing tighter and tighter. ...</p>

  <p>She opened the window and breathed in deeply; but the air was heavy,
  stagnant, and with a sigh she seated herself in a chair close to the window
  in the hope that some little breeze might find her and cool her throbbing
  head. She saw Muller in the garden, walking up and down the path with Selby,
  puffing his cigar, talking earnestly, driving his points home with the bang
  of a fist against his palm. So Muller was back! She wondered if he had been
  there for lunch, and how Selby had explained her absence; whether he had told
  Muller of that scene with her in the garden, of the vile accusations that had
  leapt at him from her lips. They told each other most things, these two. She
  would have to meet Muller, too, with those shrewd eyes of his that seemed to
  see so much, to know so much. She wondered what he was saying to Selby now,
  what particular idea he was banging into his head. Telling him that he had
  endured more than any man could be expected to endure, perhaps, urging him to
  cut adrift, to leave her....</p>

  <p>Always her thoughts came back to that point: had she lost Selby? She knew
  now that above all else she was afraid of that&mdash;more afraid of it than
  of Dennis Sanderby. She felt that she could face Dennis Sanderby's past,
  however much it might shock and repel her, but the future without Selby Clive
  she could not face. She knew now why she had all the time felt so reluctant
  to go from Sunningbourne, why she had felt, despite her fear and her horror,
  that something was holding her there, almost, it had seemed, against her
  will. Something had been holding her there&mdash;her love for Selby. She
  wondered now how she had failed to know that before; she saw how, throughout
  the tumult of the last few days, it had all the time been there, steady,
  persistent, like the hum-note of a bell, gradually growing in volume until
  now it filled her ears and dwarfed all other sounds into insignificance. Her
  whole being throbbed with it, casting out all other emotions, casting out
  fear. And now that she had come to understand, to recognize her love for what
  it was, was she to lose it? Had that sudden up-rush of fear, that hysterical
  outburst in the garden, robbed her finally of Selby's love? Surely the
  treason which she had contemplated could not require that penance. That
  foolish, vulgar little episode with Frank, regretted and abandoned almost
  before it had been begun, could not surely merit so heavy a punishment.</p>

  <p>She wondered about Frank. She hoped that he had gone. Whatever she might
  have to face when she went downstairs, she felt that she could face it better
  for the knowledge that Frank was not there. With Frank gone from the house,
  there would be less to fear from Dennis Sanderby&mdash;less to fear for
  Selby. Frank&mdash;terrified, reckless, desperate&mdash;with that revolver in
  his pocket!</p>

  <p>She rose, crossed to her dressing table, and seated herself in front of
  her mirror, peering anxiously at her reflection. What a fright she looked!
  Still, thank God for make-up! She wished now that she had had her hair waved
  this morning. She must look her best this evening. She gave a wry smile. She
  had read somewhere the the aristocrats in the French Revolution had dressed
  with meticulous care before paying their visit to Madame la Guillotine, and
  she might be paying much the same sort of visit herself. She went to her
  wardrobe and stood thoughtfully surveying the frocks that hung inside. Which
  should she wear? The black, perhaps. Selby had once told her that she always
  looked most beautiful in black....</p>

  <p>She spent a long time dressing, surveying herself again in the long
  mirror, adjusting this, altering that, until she could find no flaw&mdash;or,
  rather, which seemed infinitely more important to her tonight, until she
  could find nothing which her husband might consider a flaw. She had
  sacrificed her own taste to his in every little detail. The little curl by
  her ear, which he thought rather vulgar&mdash;"fast" he had called
  it&mdash;was discreetly tucked away; there was only the merest suggestion of
  rouge on her cheeks and the faintest touch of lipstick on her lips, and round
  her neck was the diamond necklace which always made her feel that she was the
  wife of a provincial mayor who dropped his h's, called her "the missus" and
  rode in a Rolls-Royce bought from the profits of his butcher's shop. But
  Selby liked it&mdash;thought it her loveliest piece of jewelry.</p>

  <p>There came a soft tap at her door, and she started. "Nita!"</p>

  <p>It was Clive. But she did not want to see him yet&mdash;she wasn't ready
  to face him; she must have more time. "Are you all right, Nita?"</p>

  <p>She tried to steady her voice.</p>

  <p>"Quite all right, Selby."</p>

  <p>"You'll be down for dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Just dressing."</p>

  <p>"Jerry's back. He's in the library. Go and talk to him as soon as you're
  ready."</p>

  <p>"All right, Selby. I shall be down in a few minutes." She heard him go
  into his room and close the door; and then, after a final inspection of
  herself in the glass, she quietly opened her door, slipped along the corridor
  and down the stairs. She found Muller in the library, a glass in one hand and
  a cigar in the other. She smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"I've been told to come and keep you company, Mr. Muller," she said.
  "Selby's orders."</p>

  <p>He flourished his glass.</p>

  <p>"I guess he's nervous about his whisky, Mrs. Clive. Sure he didn't tell
  you to see I wasn't too heavy-handed with the decanter?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"My orders were just to come and talk to you."</p>

  <p>"And as a dutiful wife you've obeyed orders, eh? Well, I guess that's
  wisest in the end, with a guy like Selby."</p>

  <p>She felt his keen eyes searching her face and turned away towards the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;particularly&mdash;with a guy like Selby, Mr. Muller?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you should know, Mrs. Clive," he replied. "I've disagreed with
  Selby more than once, and I haven't found it a particularly pleasant
  experience. He's as obstinate as a mule sometimes, and if you worry him too
  much he kicks like a mule. He's been kicking this evening. Still, I'm
  tough."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;about that lease?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"He's crazy&mdash;chucking away a million dollars."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he can do as he likes, Mr. Muller."</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;as long as he knows what he's doing; and it's my job to see
  that he does know. I've managed it most times, but this time he just won't
  learn."</p>

  <p>She turned again to the window, and for some moments neither of them
  spoke. Nita had an uncomfortable feeling that he was staring at her back.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Clive," he said at last, "there's something I'd like to ask
  you."</p>

  <p>"About?"</p>

  <p>"About young O'Ryan."</p>

  <p>She caught her breath sharply.</p>

  <p>"In that case, Mr. Muller, surely the right person to ask is Mr.
  O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"I have asked him, but he won't tell me. You don't have to think me
  impertinent over this, Mrs. Clive. You have to remember that I'm your
  husband's oldest friend and his lawyer."</p>

  <p>"And old friends and lawyers have a right to be impertinent to their
  clients&mdash;is that it? But to their clients' wives?"</p>

  <p>"I guess I'll risk it, anyway," said Muller. "You know young O'Ryan pretty
  well, don't you? I know you do; Selby tells me you said gug-gug to each other
  before either of you could walk, and that being so, I shouldn't be surprised
  if he sometimes says things to you that he might not say to your
  husband&mdash;things that he'd much prefer that your husband shouldn't hear
  him saying, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't understand, Mr. Muller."</p>

  <p>"Am I being impertinent?"</p>

  <p>"Very."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm in the water now, so I guess I may as well keep swimming," he
  said. "I'm wondering whether he has ever said anything to you about that
  Tamagari property."</p>

  <p>"He has quite often mentioned it."</p>

  <p>"Has he mentioned, for instance, that there's silver on the land? He says
  he's going to farm it, but do you believe he's going to farm it? Don't you
  really believe, Mrs. Clive, that he's hankering to be a mine owner rather
  than a farmer? Can you see that guy farming? Sure&mdash;from an armchair in
  his club in the West End of London. Well?"</p>

  <p>"Why ask me, Mr. Muller?"</p>

  <p>"Because I don't trust young O'Ryan, and I'm looking after Selby."</p>

  <p>"And why don't you trust Mr. O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"Because I don't like him."</p>

  <p>"Is that a sound reason?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said. "I've always found it the best possible reason. If you
  don't like a man, don't trust him; if you do like him, still don't trust him.
  That's the soundest sort of philosophy for a lawyer, Mrs. Clive&mdash;and for
  a woman."</p>

  <p>"Yet you expect me to trust you, Mr. Muller," she laughed. "But really I
  can't tell you anything."</p>

  <p>"Can't or won't?"</p>

  <p>"Can't," she repeated. "Mr. O'Ryan has told me that there may be silver in
  the land&mdash;he says there's always a chance of it&mdash;but he does not
  believe that there is. Any more impertinent questions?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not even as Selby's oldest friend?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"You must try to forgive me, Mrs. Clive," he said. "I'm
  anxious&mdash;that's my excuse. Forget it. You're all right again now, are
  you? Selby tells me you nearly had a nasty accident this morning."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;a rather close shave," she said&mdash;"too close to be
  pleasant. I'm afraid it upset me, and I rather made a fool of myself. Did
  Selby tell you that?"</p>

  <p>"No, he didn't mention that. Trust Selby for keeping the family secrets to
  himself. So that crackerjack lawyer is coming in after dinner, specially to
  meet the respectable sort of American, eh? Selby told me that."</p>

  <p>"Sir Ralph Whitcombe? He's very anxious to meet you."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't anyone else listen to him?"</p>

  <p>There came a vivid flash of lightning, and Nita started violently and
  turned suddenly from the window.</p>

  <p>"Nervous, Mrs. Clive? Forgive me if I'm being impertinent again, but you
  seem all on edge this evening."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I&mdash;I am rather, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"You're not afraid of thunderstorms?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not of thunderstorms."</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Muller, "because we're sure going to have one. And I'm
  supposed to be getting back to London tonight. I only ran down here again to
  have a last glimpse of old Selby. I'm sailing tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Clive and O'Ryan came into the room at that moment, and she glanced
  anxiously at their faces. Clive smiled at her; O'Ryan did not even look in
  her direction.</p>

  <p>"Better, my dear?" asked her husband.</p>

  <p>"Quite all right now, thanks, Selby."</p>

  <p>"Fine," he said. "We're going to have a storm, Jerry, and you know what
  that means&mdash;you'll have to stay the night. The Packard has broken a
  spring, and if I know anything about weather you'll have to wade to the
  station if you try walking."</p>

  <p>"Well, all right," agreed Muller. "I guess I'm not anxious to wade. If we
  get the storm I'll stay."</p>

  <p>"Why can't you stay for a month or two? You just dash in for a few minutes
  every few years and then dash back to God's own country. If I had my way, I'd
  keep you here for good." He turned to O'Ryan, "You see this man, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, stop your kidding, Selby!" said Muller. "I know what you're going to
  say, but I've heard it all before." Clive smiled.</p>

  <p>"You see this man, O'Ryan?" he said again. "Nothing much to look at, is
  he? But that only goes to show that you can't judge by appearances. If it
  hadn't been for this unprepossessing specimen of man, I shouldn't be alive
  now. He saved my life&mdash;by talking&mdash;which is more than old
  Whitcombe's talking is ever likely to do. It's far more likely to end it." He
  turned to Muller. "You know, Jerry, I shall never forget that speech you
  made. I believe I could almost repeat it word for word &mdash;-even after
  twenty years."</p>

  <p>Muller made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, forget it, man!"</p>

  <p>"It's not easy to forget that kind of thing, Jerry. If you'd been a shade
  less convincing, a shade less clever, if you hadn't made the most of every
  scrap of evidence, I'd have been hanged."</p>

  <p>Muller gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could say that you didn't deserve it."</p>

  <p>"Hanged?" exclaimed Nita tensely. "But, Selby, if that's true&mdash;oh,
  how can you talk about these things so lightly&mdash;make a joke of
  them."</p>

  <p>"I can't," said Muller curtly. "Look here, Dennis &mdash;Selby, get off
  that subject, will you? I'm dead sick of it, and it's not the sort of thing
  you want to talk about in front of your wife."</p>

  <p>"But, Selby, I'd like to know&mdash;" began Nita.</p>

  <p>The dinner gong sounded at that moment, and Muller set down his glass with
  a bang.</p>

  <p>"If that means something to eat," he said, "that's what I call real
  music."</p>

  <p>Dinner was less of an ordeal than Nita had expected. Muller and her
  husband became engrossed in reminiscences, and she was free to think. So it
  was true&mdash;all that Sir Ralph had told her! She had the evidence from
  both Selby and Muller now. Selby would have been hanged if Muller had been a
  little less convincing, a little less clever. Sir Ralph had said that,
  too&mdash;the clever young lawyer who had got Dennis Sanderby off when
  everything looked black against him. And there was no doubt now&mdash;she had
  never really doubted it, she supposed, since she had found that document in
  the secret compartment of the writing desk&mdash;that Selby was really Dennis
  Sanderby. She had noticed Muller's slip when he called him Dennis, and seen
  the quick, warning glance that her husband had given him. Frank had noticed
  it, too. She had seen him start and glance in her direction. If only Frank
  would go! She was afraid only for him now&mdash;and for Selby. For herself
  she had no fear. She loved Selby, and surely love&mdash;the sort of love
  which had come to her&mdash;should be strong enough to wipe suspicion from
  his mind and convince him of her loyalty. Surely, whatever Muller might have
  urged him to do, the urging of her love should be stronger. Selby did not,
  after all, always take Muller's advice. He had not taken it over that lease
  for Frank. At least&mdash;he did not seem to have taken it. But there was no
  knowing. Dennis Sanderby might only be playing a part, dangling the lease as
  a bait to keep Frank there....</p>

  <p>She forced herself not to think of that. Frank knew what he was risking,
  and if he persisted in running the risk that was his own affair.</p>

  <p>She turned her thoughts to Muller. The lawyer, she felt, did not like her.
  She had felt that from the first moment she had met him, and she had done
  nothing to lessen his antagonism. She had felt his dislike and resented it,
  and had shown him quite clearly that she was no less antagonistic to him. But
  she saw now that she had been foolish. Muller would be a powerful ally. If
  she could feel that he was on her side, that he understood and sympathized
  and had confidence in her loyalty to Selby, it might help enormously to win
  back Selby's confidence. Perhaps even now it was not too late....</p>

  <p>They had just entered the drawing room when the storm broke. There came a
  brilliant flash of lightning, and almost instantly the thunder crashed above
  them and went rumbling slowly away as the rain beat furiously against the
  windows. Selby crossed the room, pulled back the curtains, and stood gazing
  out at the myriads of silver splashes dancing on the terrace.</p>

  <p>"I never see a thunderstorm, Jerry, without thinking of that day when you
  saved my life," he said. "Do you remember? There was an awful storm that day,
  and the courthouse was struck by lightning." He turned from the window and
  strolled across to the fireplace. "What a little makes all the difference
  between life and death, eh, Jerry? A little cunning, a little guile, a few
  rhetorical periods, a slight twisting of the meaning of a phrase&mdash;" He
  stopped abruptly, with a self-conscious smile. "But I'm becoming
  sentimental."</p>

  <p>"I guess you're blathering, if that's what you mean," said the lawyer.
  "And if it isn't what you mean, it's the same thing, anyway."</p>

  <p>"But I don't think you're blathering, Selby," said Nita. "You've made me
  curious&mdash;you and Mr. Muller between you. Were you really in such
  terrible danger? When Mr. Muller saved you, I mean. I'd like to hear the
  story&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't encourage him, Mrs. Clive," interrupted Muller impatiently. "Not
  while I'm here, anyway. Get it out of him when you've got him to yourself."
  He turned to O'Ryan. "Do you play picquet?"</p>

  <p>"Not very well, I'm afraid," said O'Ryan. "Rather badly, in fact."</p>

  <p>"Fine! Then we'll play for money."</p>

  <p>Muller and O'Ryan settled down to their cards, and Selby, after watching
  them for a few moments, pleaded that he had a letter to write and went off to
  the library; and some minutes later Nita followed him.</p>

  <p>She found him struggling with a cuff link, attempting the difficult task
  of thrusting it through his cuff with one hand.</p>

  <p>"Do this up for me, Nita, will you?" he said, holding out the cuff. "It
  has come undone&mdash;or perhaps I didn't fasten it."</p>

  <p>She smiled and slipped the link in for him.</p>

  <p>"I was in rather a hurry," he explained&mdash;"afraid of being late for
  dinner. I'd dressed in good time, and then I got my shirt all mussed up and
  had to put on another." He seated himself at his desk and smiled up at her as
  she stood beside him.</p>

  <p>"Quite better, my dear?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You had a good long sleep?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;quite a good one." She picked up an ivory paper-knife that
  lay on his desk and stood toying with it nervously. "Selby!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;about this morning. I said all sorts of things
  &mdash;horrible things."</p>

  <p>"Did you?"</p>

  <p>"You know I did, Selby. I don't know why; I didn't mean to say them. I was
  frightened&mdash;terribly frightened&mdash;by that beam, and my nerves were
  all anyhow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came another peal of thunder, and Clive waved a hand towards the
  window.</p>

  <p>"That may save you from Whitcombe," he smiled. "He'd hardly come over in
  this downpour. I shall be interested to see how the catch-pit does its
  job&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Selby, please listen," she interrupted. "I'm trying to tell you that I'm
  sorry about this morning. My only excuse is that I didn't realize what I was
  saying. I didn't mean to hurt you. I expect I'd have said just the same to
  anyone I'd met at that moment, and unfortunately it happened to be you. When
  I remembered&mdash;upstairs&mdash;what I'd said to you, I hated myself."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry your head about it, Nita. It's over and done with."</p>

  <p>"And it wasn't true what you said, Selby," she went on. "You didn't really
  believe it was true, did you?"</p>

  <p>"What did I say that wasn't true, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"You said that you knew I was upset at the moment, but I was only saying
  what I really thought when I was perfectly normal."</p>

  <p>"I said that?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"It hurts me, Selby&mdash;terribly&mdash;if you really think that."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It sounds as though I wasn't particularly normal myself, my dear."</p>

  <p>"And you aren't really taking any notice of what I said, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"I've forgotten what you did say."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I haven't forgotten what <i>you</i> said. You said that &mdash;that you
  were through with me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you," she went on. "I can understand your feeling like
  that. I know I've treated you abominably, and you've stood it for longer than
  most men would have stood it. If you're through with me, it's only what I
  deserve. But I hoped&mdash;after our talk this morning&mdash;Selby, truly, I
  am going to be a decent sort of wife to you in future. I <i>am</i> fond of
  you&mdash;awfully fond."</p>

  <p>"Are you?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe it? Try, Selby, please. It's terribly
  important&mdash;to me. I sometimes wonder But you wouldn't ever&mdash;ever
  get ideas about me, would you? Nasty ideas, I mean&mdash;that you couldn't
  trust me, or&mdash;or&mdash;You wouldn't, would you?"</p>

  <p>"It takes a whole lot to make me change my opinion, Nita. Ask Jerry. He
  says he'd rather be legal adviser to the army mules."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I&mdash;I see," she said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't that answer your"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I suppose so," she said listlessly.</p>

  <p>"Then think no more about it, my dear," he said. "Is O'Ryan still playing
  cards? He must stop for a little while, anyway. I want him in here. You might
  send him along, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Something&mdash;important, Selby? I mean it's a pity to spoil their
  game."</p>

  <p>"It's more important than that," he smiled. "There's a matter I want to
  get settled with him at once, and I promised to have a word with him this
  evening. He'll understand if you tell him I want to see him. And keep Jerry
  in the drawing room, will you? I don't want him butting in."</p>

  <p>With a nod she went out and returned to the drawing room.</p>

  <p>"I've got a point of five," O'Ryan was saying.</p>

  <p>"No darned good," growled Muller.</p>

  <p>"I've a tierce major."</p>

  <p>"I've a quint major, and if there's any law in this God-forsaken country
  that counts fifteen."</p>

  <p>"I've three aces."</p>

  <p>"Forget 'em; I've got four tens."</p>

  <p>"And I've got a message for you, Frank," said Nita. "Selby wants
  you&mdash;in the library."</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, Mrs. Clive," protested Muller; "don't say you're going to
  interrupt a good game. I'm just beginning to skin this guy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Mr. Muller, but Selby wants to talk to Mr. O'Ryan in private. He
  said you'd understand, Frank." O Ryan had laid down his cards and was
  frowning at them as they lay on the table. Nita noticed that his hand was
  gripping the arm of his chair so tightly that the knuckles showed white
  through his skin.</p>

  <p>"All right, I&mdash;I'll go," he said unsteadily. "Sorry, Muller." He got
  up from the table and went towards the door, and as he went his right hand
  was thrust into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Just my luck!" grumbled Muller. "Whenever I start holding cards somep'n'
  always happens. The last time I had a good hand I'm darned if the San
  Francisco earthquake didn't butt in."</p>

  <p>Nita seated herself at the table.</p>

  <p>"I'll play with you instead, Mr. Muller, shall I? Do we play for
  money?"</p>

  <p>"Money, eh? How well do you play?"</p>

  <p>"I play a better game than Mr. O'Ryan, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted Muller. "I guess the money's of no consequence. We'll play
  for love."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">O'RYAN made his way slowly towards the library; outside the
  door he hesitated for some moments, and his hand once more sought his pocket.
  The touch of the revolver seemed to give him fresh courage, and with a shrug
  he turned the handle and went in. He entered almost jauntily, closed the door
  behind him, and paused, his gaze riveted on Clive as he sat at his desk.</p>

  <p>"Nita said you wanted a word with me, sir."</p>

  <p>Selby Clive nodded and waved a hand towards the chair beside his desk.</p>

  <p>"Come in, O'Ryan, and sit down," he said. "Yes, I want to have a chat with
  you."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan seated himself and glanced at Clive inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"About this business of yours," Clive continued. "I've got the lease
  here&mdash;" he held up the document&mdash;"but before I hand it over to you
  I want to ask you one or two questions."</p>

  <p>"I shall be happy to answer them, sir&mdash;if I can." Clive laid the
  document on the desk.</p>

  <p>"If I have understood you correctly," he went on, "you mean to farm part
  of this land?"</p>

  <p>"That is our idea, sir."</p>

  <p>"There's a big section ready for cultivation, and you have certain timber
  rights?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Clive leaned back in his chair, pursing his lips.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to be frank with you, O'Ryan," he said. "My opinion is
  that you're going to find it the devil of an uphill fight. Muller is of the
  same opinion. He knows every inch of the country, and he tells me that you'll
  be heading straight for bankruptcy&mdash;if you're going to farm, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"We are, sir," O'Ryan assured him. "That&mdash;that's the whole idea."</p>

  <p>"Of course, there may be silver in the property," added Clive. "I suppose
  you're counting on that, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;no&mdash;not exactly, sir. Of course, there's always a
  sporting chance, but according to my engineer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite," agreed Clive. "Take my advice, anyway, and don't count on that.
  If there is silver in the property, you can take it from me that you've a
  darned poor chance of ever getting it."</p>

  <p>The younger man frowned. What the devil did he mean by that? If Nita,
  after all, were right&mdash;if Clive knew that there was silver on the land,
  if he suspected that O'Ryan knew ...</p>

  <p>There came another heavy clap of thunder and Clive glanced towards the
  windows.</p>

  <p>"Storm's swinging round," he remarked. "You want three thousand pounds,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;as a matter of fact, we do."</p>

  <p><i>"You</i> want it?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I do."</p>

  <p>Clive picked up his pen and began drawing angular figures on his blotting
  paper.</p>

  <p>"Is your life insured, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan shot him a swift, nervous glance, but Clive's face told him
  nothing. If only he knew what the man was getting at....</p>

  <p>"No, I&mdash;I'm not insured."</p>

  <p>"Then you've no security to offer?"</p>

  <p>"None at all, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>Selby Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said; "I'll lend you the three thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan suddenly sat upright, staring at him, with doubtful, incredulous
  eyes. If only he knew what Clive was getting at, what was going on in that
  damnably subtle mind of his! If he was really willing to lend him three
  thousand pounds ... But was it likely&mdash;without any security? Selby Clive
  did the most quixotic things, certainly. But it didn't seem quite in keeping
  with what he knew of Dennis Sanderby. The latter would have some reason, some
  powerful motive. There was a snag somewhere....</p>

  <p>"You don't seem particularly delighted, O'Ryan."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I am, sir," said the other hastily. "It's frightfully good of
  you; but I&mdash;well, it's a bit overwhelming, you know. I mean, I have
  absolutely no security to offer you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We can get over that difficulty," interrupted Clive. "I've thought of
  that, and I'll tell you what you can do. You can insure your life in my
  favour for&mdash;well, say, twenty thousand pounds. That's a simple way out
  of it, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;of course&mdash;I suppose it is," agreed O'Ryan doubtfully.
  "But I'm afraid&mdash;twenty thousand pounds&mdash;I couldn't
  afford&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The premiums? You needn't worry about that. I'll pay the premiums on a
  short-term policy&mdash;for five years, say. It's not really good security at
  all, but I'm willing to take a chance on it. If you die within the five years
  I shall take twenty thousand for my three. But it's a gamble, because you may
  not die."</p>

  <p>"Well, I&mdash;I hope not, sir," said the other nervously. "And you may
  not be able to return the three thousand&mdash;in which case I should be the
  loser."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "It would pay me much better if you should die, O'Ryan,
  wouldn't it? That's my proposition, anyway. See about the policy tomorrow,
  and as soon as that's done I'll let you have a cheque for the three thousand
  and hand over the lease."</p>

  <p>"It's terribly good of you, sir," said O'Ryan. "I&mdash;er&mdash;hardly
  know how to thank you&mdash;er&mdash;really." He was thoughtful for a few
  moments. "I'm not absolutely clear, sir," he went on. "What would happen if
  I&mdash;er&mdash;died?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it may seem a bit gruesome, but these things have to be thought of
  in business. If you die, I shall benefit to the extent of seventeen thousand
  pounds&mdash;less, of course, the premiums I've paid. Quite a good profit for
  me, but then, I'm taking a fairly heavy risk."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;quite&mdash;I really don't know what to say." Clive rose and
  patted him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I quite understand, my boy," he said. "A big relief and a bit
  overwhelming, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, it is rather."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan got up and stood thoughtfully gnawing his knuckles. He saw the
  whole scheme now quite clearly. It was just the sort of devilish plan that he
  would have expected Dennis Sanderby to evolve. Suave, pleasant, pretending to
  do him a kindness, and all the time plotting his revenge. It was very
  awkward, though. He couldn't very well refuse to do as Clive suggested.
  Probably, if he did refuse, he would not get the lease at all, and he could
  give no reasonable excuse for refusing. Besides, he badly needed that three
  thousand pounds, and he couldn't afford to throw away the chance of getting
  it. There might be no snag in it. Clive might be genuinely anxious to help
  him; it might not be part of a fiendish plan....</p>

  <p>"Of course," added Clive, with a smile, "you may not die. You're young,
  healthy, full of vitality, and in the normal course of events you should have
  many years of life yet."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;quite&mdash;in the normal way," agreed O'Ryan gloomily. "But
  I&mdash;I should have to see my doctor, shouldn't I? If he says I'm not
  fit&mdash;not a good life for insurance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about that; you're fit enough," Clive assured him.
  "Then we'll count that as fixed, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course&mdash;thanks awfully, sir. I&mdash;I'll see about the
  insurance tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Selby Clive nodded, took his pipe from his pocket and began to fill
  it.</p>

  <p>"Do you know why I'm doing this for you, O'Ryan? Any idea at all?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;yes&mdash;I've got a sort of idea."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you have," said Clive thoughtfully. "As a matter of fact, I'm
  doing it because Nita&mdash;well, we'll say that she likes you, shall
  we?"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan shot him a quick, nervous glance.</p>

  <p>"I'll swear she doesn't, Mr. Clive&mdash;" he began impetuously, but Clive
  cut him short.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a fool, O'Ryan&mdash;not a blind fool, anyway. Nita is&mdash;very
  fond of you."</p>

  <p>"You're absolutely wrong, sir. I assure you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You were friends when you were children; you grew up together; you belong
  to the same class and have many things in common. It's quite natural: I'm not
  reproaching you."</p>

  <p>"You've absolutely no cause, sir."</p>

  <p>"If you love Nita, I mean. I've always taken a broad, sane view, I think,
  of these affinities of spirit and taste. One can't, I suppose, be held
  entirely responsible for one's likes and dislikes; we are attracted or
  repelled without having any say in the matter. But you like Nita very much,
  don't you? I nearly asked her today to tell me how much she likes you, but
  I'm afraid I hadn't the courage when it came to the point."</p>

  <p>"But I&mdash;I don't like her, sir," protested O'Ryan. "I mean&mdash;well,
  I like her, naturally; but I'm not in love with her. In any case, I wouldn't
  allow myself to fall in love with her. I do hope you'll get that idea out of
  your head, sir. I respect Nita&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell me this, O'Ryan," interrupted Clive. "If you had had the money,
  would you have married her?"</p>

  <p>"Good God, no, sir! If Nita were the only woman in the world I wouldn't
  marry her."</p>

  <p>Clive raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"It might be as well to remember, O'Ryan," he said coldly, "that you're
  speaking of my wife."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;of course&mdash;I'm sorry, sir. But you know what I mean, don't
  you? I'm fond of Nita&mdash;in a brotherly way, if you understand. But I've
  never been fond of her in the way you seem to think I have. And I'm dead
  certain Nita has never liked me in that way, either."</p>

  <p>"You seem very sure of that, O'Ryan."</p>

  <p>"I am sure."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Clive thoughtfully. "Well, perhaps it is so, but I'm by no
  means so sure about it as you seem to be. I've had the impression for some
  time now that she has a very deep affection for you, and that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're wrong, sir&mdash;absolutely wrong. She has no more that kind of
  feeling for me than I have for her. She has never given me the slightest
  reason to suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door opened and Nita came into the room. She glanced anxiously first
  at her husband and then at O'Ryan. She had a feeling that they had suddenly
  stopped their conversation as she entered. There was an awkwardness, somehow,
  and it struck her that they both seemed ill at ease, that there was a
  sensation of strain. Clive looked terribly serious, and Frank couldn't keep
  his hands still, while his eyes shifted restlessly and refused to meet
  hers.</p>

  <p>She smiled at Clive.</p>

  <p>"Am I being a nuisance?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Come in, my dear. O'Ryan and I have finished our business&mdash;for the
  time being, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Satisfactorily, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes&mdash;I think so&mdash;so far. Ask O'Ryan."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;rather&mdash;quite satisfactorily, thanks, Nita," he said,
  and stared out of the window. "It's still pouring down."</p>

  <p>"The storm seems to be going round in a circle," said Clive. "Still, we
  can do with the rain." He glanced at Nita. "Whitcombe turned up yet, my
  dear?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I thought he arranged to be here for dinner, Selby."</p>

  <p>"He did. I suppose he saw the storm coming up and thought better of it.
  Just as well he did. It's hardly the night for a walk across the
  common&mdash;and it's a let-off for Jerry, anyway. But I'd have liked to hear
  those two together. Old Whitcombe can talk, but I think I'd have backed
  Jerry..."</p>

  <p>She hardly heard what he was saying. She was watching O'Ryan; he was still
  standing at the window, staring out into the garden with his hands behind his
  back, his fingers laced together, working nervously, never still. Twice she
  saw his right hand move towards his pocket, hesitate, and return to continue
  wrestling with his left. Frank was nervous&mdash;worse than nervous; he was
  in a panic, struggling to control himself, trying desperately not to let
  Selby see. If only she knew what had happened, what these two had been saying
  to each other, what Frank had told Selby! If Selby had frightened him, as
  likely as not Frank had blurted out the whole story.</p>

  <p>"Mustn't leave old Jerry alone," Clive was saying. "He's off to Canada
  again tomorrow, and I shan't have another chance of talking to him for a year
  or so. We'd better get back to the drawing room. Come along, O'Ryan."</p>

  <p>He went to the door, opened it, and glanced back. O'Ryan was still
  standing at the window.</p>

  <p>"Come along, my boy, and make yourself pleasant to Jerry."</p>

  <p>Suddenly O'Ryan swung round. His face was pallid, his eyes unnaturally
  bright, and as he stood there staring at Clive his lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Clive&mdash;please&mdash;just a moment," he began breathlessly.
  "I&mdash;-I've something to say to you."</p>

  <p>Clive raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Unless it's something particularly important&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is. Please shut that door, sir. I&mdash;I must say it now."</p>

  <p>With a shrug Clive closed the door and turned towards him.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;it's about&mdash;this."</p>

  <p>He picked up the lease from the desk.</p>

  <p>"The lease? But I thought we'd fixed up everything."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, but&mdash;but I can't take it; I can't accept the
  lease."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>For some moments O'Ryan made no reply. He stood gazing down at the
  document as his fingers twisted it this way and that.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth can't you take it?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;I've been trying to tell you&mdash;all the evening,
  sir&mdash;but I&mdash;I don't seem to have had a chance. And it's a rotten
  sort of thing to have to tell you."</p>

  <p>"You've been trying to tell me&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;about the Tamagari land&mdash;that there's silver on the
  property."</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that, O'Ryan&mdash;now?" asked Clive. "Has Muller been
  getting at you? He's got a bee in his bonnet about there being silver on the
  Tamagari land. But he's wrong: there's no silver there&mdash;none worth
  having, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Muller's right, sir; there is silver there. There's a big lode&mdash;-my
  engineer located it."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he&mdash;he surveyed the place, but it was only today that I
  actually heard about the silver. I was on the telephone to London&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Today? I didn't know that you had been on the telephone today."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;when you were out&mdash;just before dinner. It came as a
  complete surprise to me, and I&mdash;I had to tell you."</p>

  <p>"You're sure about this, O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt about it, sir, apparently. My engineer was quite
  definite about it on the telephone, and of course I can't&mdash;can't take
  the lease now."</p>

  <p>He suddenly tore the document across and across, savagely, vindictively,
  and tossed the torn fragments on to the desk.</p>

  <p>"There it is," he added sullenly, fumbled for his cigarette case, lighted
  a cigarette, and turned again to the window. "I wish to God the rain would
  stop. I can't possibly go out in this downpour."</p>

  <p>Nita's eyes were troubled.</p>

  <p>"Were you thinking of&mdash;going out, Frank?"</p>

  <p>He turned and faced her.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes&mdash;as a matter of fact, I was, Nita. I feel rather
  uncomfortable about that school dinner. You see, I promised to go, and I
  might still be able to look in before it's over."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" interrupted Clive. "I'm not letting you go. You're staying
  here. And now about that lease. You've been very sporting about
  it&mdash;splendid. Don't you think so, Nita?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;very sporting."</p>

  <p>"Many men would have kept quiet about the silver and taken the lease.
  Well, I'm glad to be dealing with a gentleman. I must tell Jerry about this.
  He'll be all cock-a-hoop that he's right again, and it'll be a long time
  before I hear the last of it."</p>

  <p>He strode quickly to the door, opened it, and paused. "You've torn up the
  lease, O'Ryan," he said, "but I want you to realize&mdash;" He hesitated,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to realize," continued Selby, "that it won't make the least
  difference."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR some time after Clive had closed the door behind him,
  O'Ryan stood staring at it fixedly, almost as if he still saw Selby standing
  there and smiling at him. Nita watched him, a rather contemptuous smile on
  her lips. At last he wrenched his gaze away and turned a white, scared face
  towards her.</p>

  <p>"Nita&mdash;did you hear?"</p>

  <p>"I've heard a lot of things this evening, Frank&mdash;some of them rather
  horrible and some of them quite amusing."</p>

  <p>"But you heard what he said?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"'I'm glad I'm dealing with a gentleman.' That was one of the amusing
  things, Frank. Do you think he meant it, or was he just indulging in a little
  sarcasm?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how the devil do I know? You can never be sure what he's thinking,
  and you can't take a single word he says at its face value. He's too
  devilishly cunning to let you know for certain what he's driving at. That's
  part of his scheme, I suppose&mdash;-to keep you guessing, wondering if he
  means what you're afraid he does mean. He enjoys it. It's like&mdash;like
  sticking a pin in a worm and watching it wriggle. That's what he's doing all
  the time&mdash;amusing himself by watching us squirm, keeping us on
  tenterhooks. He thinks that if he keeps it up long enough we shall give
  ourselves away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank, for heaven's sake, pull yourself together. You're shouting;
  they'll hear you in the drawing room." He flung himself into an armchair and
  clasped his head in his hands.</p>

  <p>"I can't stand much more of it," he said. "It's getting me down; I admit
  it. It's all so horribly&mdash;relentless. You heard what he said, Nita: 'It
  won't make the least difference.' What do you suppose he meant by that?"</p>

  <p>"It's no use asking me, Frank."</p>

  <p>"Of course, he may not have meant anything&mdash;anything rotten, may he?
  I mean, he was smiling when he said it, and he said it in quite a friendly
  sort of way. Oh, for God's sake," he exclaimed suddenly, "don't stand there
  sneering!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sneering, Frank. I'm just wondering what Selby can have said to
  you while I was playing cards with Mr. Muller in the drawing room to reduce
  you to the pitiful state of funk you're in now."</p>

  <p>"Funk? Oh, well, perhaps I am. Aren't you? You were in a blue funk this
  morning, anyway, out in the garden. You gave yourself away pretty thoroughly,
  didn't you? You were absolutely crazy with fright, and there wasn't much you
  didn't tell Selby. If you think he still doesn't realize that you know he's
  Dennis Sanderby, you're just a fatuous little optimist. Why the deuce you had
  to blurt out everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If anyone suffers for that, Frank, I shall, not you."</p>

  <p>"Shan't I? That's just where you're wrong. It's entirely your
  fault&mdash;about tonight, I mean. Selby knows now that we've rumbled him,
  and that's why he's started getting a move on. He's scared stiff in case we
  give him away, and he means to put us out of harm's way before we have a
  chance of doing it. Hang it, you told him to his face that you knew he was
  trying to murder you&mdash;just the same as he did to the others."</p>

  <p>"So I'm to blame, Frank? All right; it's no use quarrelling about whose
  fault it is. What did he want you for in here?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, about that cursed lease," replied O'Ryan. "About the Tamagari
  business, anyway. He knew I needed three thousand for the syndicate, and he
  offered to lend it to me&mdash;on conditions. You bet your life there were
  conditions! I was to insure my life in his favour for twenty thousand pounds.
  A great scheme, wasn't it? Quite worthy of Dennis Sanderby! I insure my life
  in his favour, and then he calmly murders me and pockets a cool seventeen
  thousand on the transaction."</p>

  <p>"But you don't know, Frank. He may really have meant to lend you the three
  thousand. It's just the sort of thing Selby would do, and you have no
  proof&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Proof? Isn't the fact that he's Dennis Sanderby proof enough? And what
  about the car and the catch-pit and the beam in the pergola? Isn't that
  enough proof? You thought so at the time, anyway! And now, just because he's
  been nice to you and kissed you and called you darling a few times, you swing
  right round&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She cut him short with a quick, angry gesture.</p>

  <p>"Miss me out, please, Frank."</p>

  <p>"I've all the proof I want, anyway," he went on. "I suppose he thought I
  didn't see through his scheme, but he got no change out of me. He won't make
  his seventeen thousand at my expense. He can keep his damned lease. I've torn
  it up, and that's that."</p>

  <p>"The sporting gesture, eh? You don't know how proud of you I felt when you
  ripped the lease across in that dramatic way. So Selby had discovered that
  you knew there was silver on the property, had he? I can't imagine your
  tearing up the lease for any other reason."</p>

  <p>"You would say something rotten, Nita, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Then why did you rear it up?"</p>

  <p>"I tore it up for my own protection."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's what I meant," she said. "And you thought that would make a good
  impression. You're a bigger fool than I thought you, if you believe that. Do
  you really imagine that, if Dennis Sanderby knows you were trying to swindle
  him, tearing up the lease will make any difference? He said as much, didn't
  he? And you didn't really expect him to swallow that story about the engineer
  on the telephone, did you? You may have Dennis Sanderby rumbled, Frank, but
  he has certainly got you rumbled. Did he frighten you into telling
  him&mdash;everything? About the Laffan, I mean."</p>

  <p>"I told him nothing at all," he said furiously. "But don't deceive
  yourself that he doesn't know. He tackled me about you&mdash;kept pumping me
  and trying to trap me into admitting that there'd been something between us
  and that you were in love with me. I told him it was all rot, but I could see
  he didn't believe me."</p>

  <p>"You can hardly blame him for that, can you? And whatever you had told
  him, it would probably have made no difference. 'A ruthless man, pursuing his
  inexorable way&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"My God! I see now, Nita&mdash;'It won't make the least
  difference'&mdash;I see what he meant now! But he won't get a chance. I'll
  see he doesn't!"</p>

  <p>He strode quickly towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Frank&mdash;where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to telephone&mdash;to Scotland Yard. I'm standing no more of
  it. They must send a man down here, and I'll tell him the whole damned
  story."</p>

  <p>She went swiftly to him and clutched his arm. "Frank, you can't!" she
  exclaimed breathlessly. "You shan't do anything of the kind. I'll not let
  you!" He tried to shake his arm free, but she clung to it desperately.</p>

  <p>"I'm through with the whole business," he raved. "I've nothing to lose now
  and everything to gain by putting the police on him, and I'm going to do it
  before it's too late. The man's a dangerous criminal&mdash;a
  maniac&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's not! I know he's not. You're all wrong about Selby, Frank. He isn't
  as bad as you think. Whatever he did in the past&mdash;oh, what does the past
  matter? You can't judge a man by that. You don't know what sort of hell he
  may have been through...."</p>

  <p>"I know the sort of hell I'm going through, and I've had as much of it as
  I can stand. Let me go!" Again he tried to wrench his arm away, but she
  maintained her grip.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, Frank, think what you're doing," she implored.
  "What&mdash;what about me? If my name is to be dragged into all this
  beastliness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your name!" he interrupted violently. "Damn your name! It isn't a
  question of names: it's a question of life!"</p>

  <p>"Your life!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my life."</p>

  <p>She stood for a moment gazing at him with scornful eyes; and then she
  suddenly released his arm and turned away.</p>

  <p>"All right," she said; "go on. You know where the telephone is."</p>

  <p>His hand was on the handle of the door, but he hesitated, glancing round
  at her irresolutely.</p>

  <p>"The telephone's in the hall," she said, "just outside the drawing-room
  door. Selby's in the drawing room; so is Mr. Muller. But perhaps you don't
  mind their hearing what you say to Scotland Yard!"</p>

  <p>O'Ryan's hand released the door knob.</p>

  <p>"What are you afraid of?" she taunted. "It's a matter of life&mdash;your
  life! And you've a revolver in your pocket, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>Slowly he moved away from the door.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to talk like that," he muttered sulkily. "I'm doing this
  as much for you as for myself; you seem to forget that."</p>

  <p>She smiled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I'm dealing with a gentleman, Frank," she said. "But please
  don't be chivalrous on my account. Ring up Scotland Yard, if you want
  to."</p>

  <p>She watched his face anxiously. He was still undecided; she could see
  that. But somehow she must stop him. He must not go to the telephone. Her
  name? Damn her name! What did her name matter? It wasn't a question of names:
  it was a question of everything that was worth having in life, a question of
  happiness, of love&mdash;of Selby. She felt that, rather than let Frank go to
  the telephone, she could kill him with as little compunction as she would
  kill a mad dog. And he was still wavering, still half inclined to carry out
  his purpose.... "Well, Frank? Are you going to telephone?"</p>

  <p>"I've half a mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because, if you do telephone for Scotland Yard to send a man down so that
  you can tell him all about Dennis Sanderby, you really mustn't count on ever
  seeing him, Frank. Dennis Sanderby would certainly take steps to stop you
  telling your story."</p>

  <p>"But there's no reason why he should know&mdash;or Muller either. They
  won't stay in the drawing room all the evening. I'll wait until the coast is
  clear."</p>

  <p>"But he'll still know, Frank. The moment you try to telephone he'll know
  what you're going to do."</p>

  <p>"I'm hanged if I see how&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because I shall tell him."</p>

  <p>"Nita!"</p>

  <p>"I mean it."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't be such a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I would. Try and see, Frank, if you don't believe me. Just go near the
  telephone, even, and you'll see just what I can be when I put my mind to it.
  Well?"</p>

  <p>"I think you're crazy," he said sulkily. "You're defending him now, but a
  couple of days ago nothing was too bad for him."</p>

  <p>"That isn't true."</p>

  <p>"You're all on his side now, anyway&mdash;and against me. I don't matter
  much now, do I?"</p>

  <p>"Candidly, Frank, you matter less than&mdash;other things."</p>

  <p>"Less than Selby, you mean. Because you fancy that, after all, you're in
  love with him. You must satisfy that conscience of yours, mustn't you? So you
  try to persuade yourself that you're in love with him. It's so much more
  comforting than admitting the truth&mdash;that you're crawling and cringing
  to him because you're scared stiff, trying to get into his good books because
  you hope that in that way you may be able to wriggle out of a difficult
  situation&mdash;even if it does mean letting me down. You're terribly afraid
  of him, really." She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not now."</p>

  <p>"If you're not afraid of him, why don't you tell him everything? Tell him
  about the Laffan. Tell him you know he's Dennis Sanderby, who murdered his
  wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't understand, Frank."</p>

  <p>"I understand enough to know that you daren't tell him. And that's what
  you'd have to tell him if you tried to stop my telephoning. The whole story
  would have to come out then, and you'd never dare to let it."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand, Frank," she repeated. "You don't understand that
  there are some things for which it's worth daring anything. I'm not being
  heroic; I'm just stating a simple fact. I've got something&mdash;found
  something&mdash;which seems to me to be much more important than anything
  else&mdash;so important that I'm ready to dare anything for the sake of
  keeping it. It's just a question of values. To me it seems worth while to put
  up with anything, sacrifice anything&mdash;including you, Frank, if
  necessary&mdash;to prevent its being taken away from me. Just remember
  that&mdash;if you should happen to go near the telephone."</p>

  <p>"Fine, Nita!" he sneered. "Wonderful stuff! But you can't persuade me
  you're not afraid."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I am&mdash;a little," she admitted. "But don't bank on my
  fear, Frank, that's all. Fear doesn't matter now. It's one of those things
  that it's worth while putting up with&mdash;" She stopped abruptly as Muller
  and her husband came into the room.</p>

  <p>"Here's the fellow," said Clive, with a wave of his hand towards O'Ryan.
  "You'd better shake hands with him, Jerry, for proving you right again. I've
  explained things to Jerry, O'Ryan, and he is going to redraft that lease for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Sure I am," said Muller&mdash;"with reservations."</p>

  <p>"With no reservations of any kind, Jerry. That was a great gesture of
  yours, O'Ryan. I appreciate it more than I can tell."</p>

  <p>"Fine!" said Muller. "I haven't seen one like it since Uncle Tom's
  Cabin."</p>

  <p>"Jerry, behave yourself," said Clive curtly.</p>

  <p>"A fine gesture!" repeated Muller. "I wonder if Sir Something Somebody has
  ever seen a finer. Wish he'd been here." He paused beside Nita and lowered
  his voice. "We'd have blubbered in each other's arms," he added.</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I wish he had turned up, Mr. Muller," she said. "You'd probably have
  liked him. Selby does. It was the rain that stopped him, I suppose. And it
  got dark very early tonight."</p>

  <p>"He's a talkative old gentleman," Clive said, "but I find him very
  interesting. He's writing about some case or other and wanted to consult you
  about it, I believe. What is this precious case he's writing up, Nita? He
  told you all about it, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Several times over, I believe, Selby. But I didn't listen very carefully.
  Hasn't he told you?"</p>

  <p>"No; he has been very mysterious about it with me, and as I'm really not
  very interested I haven't pressed him. Some murder case, I think." He crossed
  to the window and looked out. "Just as well he didn't come, perhaps. He
  always will insist on walking here across the common, and it's hardly a trip
  for an old man just now. I warned him of that this morning. All sorts of
  unsavoury people are beginning to gather for the racing next week, and as
  likely as not he'd have lost his watch. And I know you're thankful,
  Nita."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't dislike him really," replied Nita. "He's rather an old dear
  in many ways, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he talks too much?" suggested Clive. "There's an old saying amongst
  the Cherokee Indians: 'The man who talks too much has lived too long.'"</p>

  <p>As Lane came into the room, Clive glanced at him over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lane?"</p>

  <p>"Colonel Boscombe has phoned through, sir, with a message for Sir Ralph
  Whitcombe. I told the Colonel that Sir Ralph wasn't here."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"He seemed very surprised, sir. Sir Ralph, he said, had given him to
  understand that he was dining here this evening, and left to walk here across
  the common just before dark."</p>

  <p>"That's funny," said Clive. "I didn't meet him." Nita gave a puzzled
  frown.</p>

  <p>"You didn't meet him, Selby? But how could you have met him? You haven't
  been out this evening, have you?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;as a matter of fact, my dear, I did go out
  &mdash;just for a few minutes," replied her husband. "Didn't I tell you?" He
  seemed embarrassed, rather confused, she thought, by her remark; but she made
  no comment. "I walked a little way across the common," he went on, "thinking
  I might meet Whitcombe. This is a difficult place to find in the dark." He
  paused and looked thoughtful for a few moments. "I hope nothing has happened
  to him," he added.</p>

  <p>"Happened? But what could happen to him, Selby?" He shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He's an old man, Nita, and he has no right to go wandering about alone on
  the common at night. If he fell and twisted an ankle he might be out there
  for hours before he could attract anyone's attention."</p>

  <p>"I say, sir," began O'Ryan with alacrity, "shall I go and have a look
  round?"</p>

  <p>Nita was conscious of a vague stir of alarm&mdash;a feeling, for which she
  could find no reasonable explanation, that all was not well; yet she could
  not suppress a smile as she saw O'Ryan's eager face and noted how he was
  already at the door, anxious to be off. He intended, of course, to get out of
  the house and not to return to it&mdash;was grasping desperately at this
  chance of making his escape. If only he would go! Once out of danger, he
  would think no more about telephoning the police. She knew Frank; once he was
  out of the reach of Dennis Sanderby, he would be careful to keep clear of him
  in future, and to be involved in a police investigation was the last thing he
  would want. He glanced across at her, and she gave him a scarcely perceptible
  nod of approval.</p>

  <p>"Please, Frank&mdash;will you?" she said. "I can't help feeling rather
  nervous, and we really ought to do something."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan nodded and opened the door.</p>

  <p>"If I'm gone some time, don't worry," he said. "The common's a biggish
  place and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll come with you," announced Clive. "I know every inch of the ground,
  and if you go alone we shall probably have to send a search party for you
  later on."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan's hand released the door handle, and Nita saw the sudden alarm in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I say, sir, there's no need&mdash;" He started violently as a deafening
  clap of thunder announced the return of the storm. "I mean, it's a pretty
  foul night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, O'Ryan. A drop of rain won't hurt me&mdash; eh, Nita?"</p>

  <p>"There's no need for everyone to go, Selby," she answered. "After all, Sir
  Ralph may have taken shelter with the Haylings. Their house is on the way,
  and he knows them quite well. Perhaps if we telephoned there first ..." She
  glanced across at O'Ryan and gave him a quick, contemptuous smile. "No use
  your getting cold feet for nothing, Frank," she said.</p>

  <p>Lane coughed discreetly.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir," he said, "but what shall I say to Colonel Boscombe? He
  is holding the line."</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;I'll come and speak to him," replied Clive, and hurried
  from the room.</p>

  <p>Muller smiled.</p>

  <p>"Lost&mdash;one crackerjack lawyer," he laughed. "Well, if he's never
  found, I guess he'll be the hell of a loss to society."</p>

  <p>"He's our guest, Mr. Muller," Nita reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he agreed. "But I guess if a guest decides that he doesn't like
  your dinners, there's no sense in dragging the river for him. Selby's always
  inclined to make a vast fuss over his friends, but they never did a darned
  thing for him except let him down with a bump."</p>

  <p>"All except you, eh, Mr. Muller?"</p>

  <p>He waved that aside with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"I don't see myself tramping about a common on a night like this just in
  case a guest couldn't find my house. That's what Selby did." He smiled. "Poor
  old Selby! He must have blundered into something that wasn't his guest, I
  reckon. He was in a goodish mess when he came in, anyway&mdash;his hands all
  over red paint or somep'n."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan started.</p>

  <p>"Red paint?" he exclaimed in a hollow voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't make a close inspection, Mr. O'Ryan. He didn't give me a
  chance&mdash;went straight upstairs."</p>

  <p>"Paint?" repeated O'Ryan. He was staring at Muller with frightened eyes.
  "Are you sure it was paint?"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing&mdash;nothing been painted red," said Nita rather
  breathlessly. "I'm quite sure&mdash;there's been no painting done."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not going to swear it was paint," said Muller. "It was somep'n'
  red, anyway&mdash;all over his hands. He seemed terribly upset about it and
  didn't stop to explain. He just said he must go upstairs and change his
  shirt."</p>

  <p>Nita caught her breath sharply. Selby, of course, had changed his
  shirt&mdash;he had asked her to help him fasten his link&mdash;said he had
  got it all mussed up. And he had been out on the common&mdash;he had seemed
  quite embarrassed when he had let that out... .</p>

  <p>She started violently as O'Ryan's voice suddenly cut into the silence.</p>

  <p>"Paint!" he exclaimed. "My God, Muller, that wasn't paint! Do you know
  what it was? I'll tell you, shall I?" Muller turned and stared at him
  anxiously as he stood there with clenched hands and twitching lips.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess it's of no particular interest to me, Mr. O'Ryan," he said
  coolly, "so we won't get het up about it." He went to the door, opened it,
  and glanced back. "If you're interested, Mr. O'Ryan," he said, "I suggest
  that you ask Selby whether it was paint. I've no doubt he'll tell you!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">O'RYAN swung round and faced Nita.</p>

  <p>"My God! What a fool I am!" he exclaimed, and there was a note of hysteria
  in his voice. "I might have known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why on earth didn't you go?" she retorted. "You had the chance. If you
  haven't the pluck to go openly&mdash;to tell Selby you're going, and go
  whatever he may say&mdash;why didn't you go out to look for Sir Ralph? You
  needn't have come back."</p>

  <p>"He wanted to come with me, didn't he? You heard what he said, and he
  wouldn't have been put off it. If I'd gone, he'd have gone with me. Did you
  expect me to go&mdash;out there&mdash;on that damned deserted
  common&mdash;with Dennis Sanderby? It would have been a fine chance for him,
  wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Frank, I don't want to hear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And he'd warned me, hadn't he? You bet he had! He wouldn't forget that.
  Everyone who was in the room would give evidence that he said there were
  undesirable people about, that the common wasn't safe. He'd have got away
  with it again. He always does get away with it. He's cunning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nita made an angry gesture.</p>

  <p>"Then, for heaven's sake, Frank, go now!" she exclaimed. "Get away at
  once. I'll make some excuse for you to Selby; there's no need for you to tell
  him. Slip out while you have the chance and get to the station&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How the devil can I get to the station? Don't you see the trap? I can't
  get away. He doesn't mean me to get away. I've got no car."</p>

  <p>"Then take the Packard. Leave it at the garage next to the station, and
  I'll fetch it back in the morning."</p>

  <p>"It's out of order; he said so. It's got a broken spring &mdash;trust him
  to see to that. He doesn't forget much when he sets his traps. God knows what
  he's got in his mind this time&mdash;some devilish scheme or other&mdash;and
  he doesn't mean to fail again."</p>

  <p>"You've legs, haven't you?" said Nita curtly. "You can walk."</p>

  <p>"Across that common&mdash;alone? That's a good suggestion, isn't it? I
  wouldn't walk across there tonight for a million pounds."</p>

  <p>"Not even with a revolver in your pocket?"</p>

  <p>"It's easy to sneer!" he exclaimed angrily. "But you'll find out later
  whether I was right or not. Don't forget that somebody else walked across
  that common tonight. He started to, anyway. But how far did he get?"</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Frank, what&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I should have thought it was obvious. I mean Sir Ralph Whitcombe. How far
  did he get across the common? Just as far as meeting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I won't listen!" she cried. "You shan't say it!" She grasped his arm and
  shook it passionately, but he wrenched himself free.</p>

  <p>"Just as far as meeting Dennis Sanderby," he said. "He had no chance of
  getting any further&mdash;God help him! Didn't Selby go out specially to meet
  him? You know he did. And Muller saw him come back&mdash;with his hands
  covered with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;don't!" she begged. "You don't realize
  what you're saying."</p>

  <p>"It's as clear as daylight," he went on. "If you weren't so hopelessly
  prejudiced you'd see it yourself. You do see it, but because you think you're
  in love with Selby you won't admit it. Selby doesn't know what case it is
  that old Whitcombe's writing up, eh? He said so&mdash;here&mdash;this
  evening, didn't he? And of course, if he says so, it must be true! Don't be
  such a fool, Nita&mdash;or such a hypocrite."</p>

  <p>"But Sir Ralph hasn't mentioned it to him&mdash;he gave me his word that
  he would say nothing about it."</p>

  <p>"Selby knows, I tell you," he cried. "He knows as well as we do that old
  Whitcombe is writing up the Sanderby murder case, that he's ferreting out all
  the details to stick them in his book. Do you suppose Dennis Sanderby is
  going to stand for that? After all these years of passing himself off as a
  decent sort of man, do you suppose he's going to let an old fool like
  Whitcombe blab the whole story? Not likely! He knows that at any moment
  Whitcombe may dig up the truth&mdash;that he changed his name to Selby
  Clive&mdash;and he doesn't mean to have that proclaimed from the housetops.
  Whitcombe had to be silenced&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank, I can't believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You won't believe, you mean. Why don't you face the facts? Whitcombe
  talks too much, and you heard what Selby said: 'The man who talks too much
  has lived too long.' He didn't mean to give Whitcombe a chance of talking too
  much about him, so he went out to meet him&mdash;in the dark&mdash;on the
  common."</p>

  <p>She covered her face with her hands.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it," she stammered again. "That old man ..." Suddenly she
  snatched her hands from her face and turned to him defiantly. "It's
  hideous&mdash;foul!" she exclaimed. "He couldn't do it&mdash;-Selby couldn't
  do it! Do you hear what I say? It's all lies&mdash;filthy lies&mdash;out of
  your own filthy mind! If you weren't such a pitiful coward&mdash; "She turned
  from him abruptly. "For heaven's sake, go, Frank!"</p>

  <p>"Lies?" he sneered. "Selby couldn't do it? But he's done it before,
  remember. What was old Whitcombe to him, except a damned nuisance? But his
  wife&mdash;his first wife&mdash;she must have meant something to him. He must
  have loved her at one time, kissed her, fondled her, held her in his arms.
  But she died, didn't she?&mdash;died with his kiss on her lips. You know
  that, yet you persist in deluding yourself."</p>

  <p>Nita had flung herself into a chair, resting her elbows on her knees and
  burying her face in her hands. O'Ryan stood for some moments glancing
  irresolutely from her to the door and then again at the motionless figure in
  the chair. Then he turned on his heel, strode quickly across the room and out
  into the hall.</p>

  <p>She heard him go, but she did not move. She did not even wonder whether he
  had found the courage to leave the house or whether, in spite of her threat,
  he intended making that telephone call to Scotland Yard. It didn't seem to
  matter what he did or did not do now. Nothing mattered but Selby. If Frank
  were right, if Dennis Sanderby, rather than have his secret broadcast to the
  world, had gone out to meet Sir Ralph&mdash;-to silence him ...</p>

  <p>She thrust the thought from her frantically. She must not believe
  it&mdash;she would not believe it. Even to think of it was treason. As Frank
  had been speaking, piling up the evidence against him, the thought had crept
  into her mind that it was all hideously convincing, terrifyingly possible.
  Selby <i>had</i> said and done just what Frank had stated; she <i>was,</i>
  perhaps, prejudiced, dazzled by the wonder of the great discovery she had
  made, instinctively shrinking from anything that threatened it. But as the
  thought had slipped into her mind, all her feelings had come surging to expel
  it. No matter what Frank might say, no matter how convincing a case the facts
  might build up, no matter what her reason might tell her to be the obvious
  truth, she felt, and therefore she knew beyond all argument and reason, that
  Selby could not be guilty.</p>

  <p>The thunder was rumbling continuously now, and she rose, went to the
  French windows, pulled aside the curtains, and looked out. In the shaft of
  light from the windows countless glistening threads of rain were hanging. It
  was like a curtain of crystal beads, she thought; it swayed every now and
  then with the wind, and she could hear the swish as its end swept the stone
  paving of the terrace. Perhaps, after all, they were alarmed over nothing.
  Sir Ralph would hardly venture across the common on a night like this. Frank
  was rattled, and she had caught some of his panic. The most likely
  explanation was that Sir Ralph had seen the storm coming and had taken
  shelter with the Haylings. But if he had done that, surely he would have
  telephoned?</p>

  <p>She heard the door open and turned to see O'Ryan standing in the entrance.
  He was wearing a mackintosh, and his hat was in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm going, Nita," he announced. "I shall follow the road as far as
  Staines and get a train there."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to go with you?"</p>

  <p>He made no reply, but seemed to be considering the question.</p>

  <p>"Do you?" she repeated. "I'll go with you if you like&mdash;and hold your
  hand."</p>

  <p>He made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing to joke about, Nita. I tell you frankly, I don't fancy the
  trip, but anything's better than staying in this infernal house. Where's
  Selby?"</p>

  <p>"I've no idea, Frank. Phoning, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He's not in the hall. And there's no one in the drawing room. I wish I
  knew for certain. Lane, too&mdash;I don't trust him. If Selby asks where I
  am, Nita, say I've gone up to my room, will you?"</p>

  <p>"All right, Frank."</p>

  <p>He turned and stood listening intently. Then:</p>

  <p>"I'm off."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p><i>"Bon voyage!"</i></p>

  <p>For a few seconds he hesitated, gazing at her back as she stood by the
  window; and then he turned suddenly and hurried away. Nita heard the front
  door close, and her lips curled in a contemptuous smile.</p>

  <p>But she was glad that he had gone. While he was in the house she had felt
  that she was responsible for him, and she was thankful to be relieved of the
  responsibility. Frank was so easily rattled. At any moment he might have said
  something or done something which would have brought her whole world crashing
  about her. She could breathe more freely now that that danger was gone; she
  could fight better single-handed, should there be any need to fight.</p>

  <p>She seated herself on the Chesterfield, picked up a magazine, and began to
  turn the pages. There was nothing that she could do but be patient and await
  developments. She would have been thankful for something to do, but it was
  useless to try to hurry matters. Muller would be gone tomorrow, and she would
  have Selby to herself. She would be able to talk to him then&mdash;as she had
  talked to him this morning&mdash;intimately&mdash;wife to husband; let him
  see that, whatever he may have suspected, he had no cause for suspicion now,
  never again would have cause....</p>

  <p>The door was opened, and Clive stood in the doorway. "I wouldn't worry
  about Whitcombe, my dear," he said. "I expect he's gone to earth somewhere,
  and it would never occur to him that we might be anxious and he ought to
  telephone." He smiled. "Too absorbed in his precious case to think of
  anything else."</p>

  <p>"I am rather worried, Selby. Have you telephoned to the Haylings'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;he's not there. They know nothing about him &mdash;haven't seen
  him all day. Jerry's just trying to get through to the police station. We may
  get some news there." He glanced round the room. "What's become of
  O'Ryan?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he&mdash;he said he was going up to his room. I think he's
  rather&mdash;upset. The storm, you know."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"He's a good chap, Nita&mdash;straight. That lease, for instance. I like
  him for that."</p>

  <p>"And dislike him for&mdash;what, Selby?"</p>

  <p>Clive shook his head.</p>

  <p>"When I've any reason for disliking a person, my dear," he said, "I make a
  rule to keep it to myself." He turned as he heard Muller calling him from the
  hall. "There's my call," he said. "We'll go into the drawing room, shall we?
  It's much cooler in there. I'll just speak to the police first."</p>

  <p>He went out, leaving the door open, and Nita got up from the couch and
  stood listening.</p>

  <p>"You've heard nothing at all?" she heard him say. "All right, thanks." The
  receiver was returned to its hook. "No news there, Jerry," he said. "We'll go
  in the drawing room. Nita's coming along."</p>

  <p>Nita remained where she was for some moments, frowning thoughtfully. It
  was queer about Sir Ralph, and they really should do something. Again she had
  that uneasy feeling that something was amiss, that something was about to
  happen&mdash;something of which she was afraid....</p>

  <p>She heard a sound and glanced up sharply just in time to see O'Ryan step
  quickly into the room and hastily close the door behind him. He turned to
  face her, his hand still grasping the knob. His mackintosh was soaked, and
  his hat, still on his head, was pouring a thin stream of water onto the
  carpet. There was a look of terror in his face, and his voice shook as he
  spoke. "Nita!"</p>

  <p>"Frank&mdash;what on earth is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Nita, there's somebody&mdash;a man&mdash;out there in the
  grounds&mdash;watching.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A man?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, biting his lip.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"I nearly ran into him. He's watching&mdash;for me. Selby put him
  there&mdash;to watch&mdash;I might have known, mightn't I? I might have
  guessed that Dennis Sanderby wouldn't let me get away as easily as that!"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, Frank, that it wasn't one of the gardeners? Joslin,
  perhaps. He often comes quite late to stoke up the furnace for the
  vinery."</p>

  <p>"No, it wasn't Joslin. It wasn't any of the gardeners. I heard him speak.
  He said&mdash;I heard it quite distinctly&mdash;he said: 'Dennis Sanderby!'
  It was just as if he was giving a password. My God, Nita, you
  must&mdash;somehow&mdash;find some way&mdash;I mean, I can't stay here. Think
  of something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're sure you're not imagining all this?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm crazy? I saw him&mdash;heard him speak, I tell you. I
  nearly ran into him&mdash;nearly touched him."</p>

  <p>There came a vicious stab of fire across the curtains, a crash of thunder,
  and suddenly O'Ryan became rigid, staring at the window.</p>

  <p>"Nita, did you hear?" he whispered. "What was that?"</p>

  <p>"I only heard the thunder," she said.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Listen!"</p>

  <p>They stood in silence, listening intently; and then quite distinctly there
  came the sound of a tap on the French windows. O'Ryan turned a scared face
  towards her.</p>

  <p>"There! Hear it?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Someone's tapping at the window," she said calmly. "See who it is, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Nita. Ring for Lane."</p>

  <p>With a shrug she crossed to the windows and began to pull back the
  curtains. As she jerked them back, the lightning flashed again, and as she
  caught a glimpse of the figure that stood on the terrace she gave a stifled
  scream and stepped hastily backward, staring at the window with eyes in which
  was the glint of terror. And then she went swiftly forward again and grasped
  the handle.</p>

  <p>"Nita&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;don't open that window!"</p>

  <p>She did not seem to hear him. She twisted the handle, flung the window
  open, and stepped back with a little gasp of horror as she saw Sir Ralph,
  with an ugly red streak across his face, his dress-shirt sodden and stained
  with red, his hair in wild disorder, and his hands groping in front of him,
  stagger forward and lurch into the room.</p>

  <p>For a few moments he stood swaying, his hands still pawing at the air, his
  eyes closed; and then, with a low moan, he pitched forward and fell in a
  shapeless heap on the floor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">THE door of the library was thrown open, and Selby Clive,
  with Muller on his heels, came striding in.</p>

  <p>"Nita&mdash;I thought I heard a scream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She pointed to the huddled man that lay on the floor just inside the
  French windows.</p>

  <p>"Look!"</p>

  <p>Clive started.</p>

  <p>"Shut that window, O'Ryan," he ordered, and an instant later was on his
  knees beside the prostrate form.</p>

  <p>O'Ryan hurried to the window and closed it. Muller's fingers were already
  on Sir Ralph's pulse.</p>

  <p>Nita made an effort to speak calmly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Muller, is he&mdash;dead?"</p>

  <p>Muller shook his head, frowning.</p>

  <p>"No, I guess he's not dead, Mrs. Clive; but he's got a pulse that's
  missing on two."</p>

  <p>"Ring for Lane," ordered Clive.</p>

  <p>But at that moment Lane came in, halted as he caught sight of the group
  around the figure on the floor, and stood staring, with gaping mouth and
  wide-open eyes. "Is he badly hurt, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say, my dear. Jerry, go to the dining room and get the couch ready,
  will you? It's better than the Chesterfield."</p>

  <p>As the lawyer hurried out, Clive rose to his feet. "Where did he come
  from, Nita?"</p>

  <p>She pointed to the French windows.</p>

  <p>"Through there. He knocked, and I opened them."</p>

  <p>"It must have been Sir Ralph I saw groping about on the lawn, sir," said
  O'Ryan. "I thought he was&mdash;somebody else."</p>

  <p>Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"Lane!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Take his legs."</p>

  <p>They lifted the limp figure and began to carry it towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Shall I telephone for a doctor, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see to that, my dear. Stay where you are, and don't worry."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan went to the door and stood watching them as they carried Sir Ralph
  along the hall towards the dining room, and as the dining-room door closed he
  swung round.</p>

  <p>"Nita, you ought to go&mdash;somebody ought to go with them. They've got
  him in there&mdash;Dennis Sanderby and Muller&mdash;they've got him in their
  at their mercy. God knows what they'll get up to!"</p>

  <p>"Then why not go yourself and protect him?"</p>

  <p>"In there&mdash;with Sanderby and Muller? If I went into that room, I'd
  never come out again alive. Nor will Whitcombe&mdash;unless someone goes in.
  He's as near dead already as he can be, and it wouldn't need much&mdash;Nita,
  why don't you go? It's&mdash;it's your duty to go. You can't stand there and
  let them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Selby told me to stay here."</p>

  <p>"Of course he did!" he exclaimed. "What else would you expect him to do?
  They don't want you or anyone else in there. But you could go, Nita. They
  wouldn't dare to&mdash;do anything if you were there. And they won't hurt
  you. Selby seems pretty well all right as far as you're concerned. I mean, I
  don't think he'd do anything to you. It's not you he's after now."</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten the pergola, Frank? That wasn't many hours ago."</p>

  <p>"No, of course&mdash;but... oh, I don't know. It's ghastly! His face, as
  he came in through the window, covered with blood.... Horrible!"</p>

  <p>"You've seen blood before, haven't your" She smiled contemptuously.
  "You'll find some smelling-salts on the mantelpiece. You'd better go upstairs
  to your room and go to bed. You can leave the light burning and lock your
  door."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk such rot, Nita!"</p>

  <p>"Then, for heaven's sake," she cut in angrily, "do something intelligent
  or say something intelligent. Don't stand there whining and shivering and
  trying to get me to do the dirty work. If you really believe Sir Ralph isn't
  safe in the dining room, try to summon up the courage to go and look after
  him. If you haven't the pluck to do that, then clear out while you've the
  chance."</p>

  <p>O'Ryan stood thoughtfully by the desk, drumming on it with his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you one thing," he said: "Dennis Sanderby can't hush this up.
  This is the finish of him. If Whitcombe lives he'll tell the whole story.
  He'll tell the police what happened out there on the common tonight. And what
  he can't tell them, I will."</p>

  <p>Nita was smiling, watching him with a hint of amusement in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You don't think I'd dare?" he challenged.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking about that," she said. "I was thinking about that night
  at the Laffan."</p>

  <p>"Damn the Laffan!"</p>

  <p>"I was just wondering why I went to the trouble of bolting the door. A
  bogey would frighten you&mdash;a turnip with a candle inside. If you had
  opened the door, I need only have said 'Boo!' and you'd have scuttled away
  like a rabbit."</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"You can abuse me as much as you like," he said, "but you'll see. When the
  police arrive I'm going to do a little talking."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Who's going to stop me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you never know, Frank. It doesn't do to be too sure. Remember what
  Selby said this evening? There's a saying among the Cherokee Indians that a
  man who talks too much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As Lane entered the room she turned to him eagerly.</p>

  <p>"How is he, Lane?"</p>

  <p>"I left Mr. Clive and Mr. Muller looking after him, madam."</p>

  <p>"Looking after him!" exclaimed O'Ryan. "My God!"</p>

  <p>Lane turned his head and bestowed on him a disapproving stare.</p>

  <p>"The poor gentleman is in a very bad way, I'm afraid, madam. He's talking
  and muttering something awful."</p>

  <p>"He's not conscious?"</p>

  <p>"No, madam."</p>

  <p>"Have they sent for the police yet, Lane?" now inquired O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, sir."</p>

  <p>"Why ever not?"</p>

  <p>"I suggested to Mr. Clive that I should telephone through to the police
  station, sir, but he said that there was no need to do so for the
  moment."</p>

  <p>"No need? When a man has been nearly murdered! Why on earth didn't you
  phone at once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lane!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam?"</p>

  <p>"Please remember that if Mr. O'Ryan asks you any more questions you are
  not to answer them."</p>

  <p>"Very good, madam."</p>

  <p>"And you will certainly not telephone to the police station without Mr.
  Clive's instructions."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, madam. I shouldn't dream of it." She nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's all, Lane."</p>

  <p>He went towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I say, Lane," said O'Ryan, glancing round the room, "where the deuce is
  the whisky? I'm parched."</p>

  <p>"I'll fetch it, sir," said the servant. "I took it into the dining room at
  dinner time and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, thanks," interrupted Nita. "You needn't trouble to fetch it;
  they may want it in there. Mr. O'Ryan will have his drink in the dining
  room."</p>

  <p>Lane went out, after administering another disapproving stare, and O'Ryan
  turned to Nita furiously.</p>

  <p>"Do you expect me to stand for that sort of thing?" he exclaimed.
  "Cheapening me in front of the servants, making me look a fool, humiliating
  me.... All right, Nita&mdash;then I'll humiliate you. You thought I was in
  love, with you, didn't you? You thought you were so charming, so beautiful,
  so alluring that I'd lost my head over you and was willing to do anything
  rather than give you up. You thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up, Frank. Pull yourself together."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to shut up; I'm going to tell you the truth. You thought I
  wanted you&mdash;wanted to kiss you, to hold you in my arms. You flattered
  yourself that I couldn't resist you, that you had only to go on dangling
  yourself in front of me&mdash;just out of reach&mdash;tempting me with a
  dainty morsel, and you could get me to do anything you wanted. You thought I
  didn't realize what your game was, but I knew. It wasn't an original game;
  all women try it. But it was a bad mistake to try playing it with me. It
  didn't work, did it? And shall I tell you why? Because I didn't care a damn
  about you! I never have. All I wanted was the lease, and I just used you to
  try to get it. It was the lease that mattered, not you. You were just a
  stupid, sentimental fool who might be useful to me, and if I could get you to
  provide a little amusement for me at the same time, so much the better. What
  do you think of that, eh, Nita?"</p>

  <p>She was looking at him gravely&mdash;very calm, very pale, and for some
  moments she stood there, gazing at him fixedly, meeting his glance until it
  wavered and slipped away. Then:</p>

  <p>"What a cad you are, Frank!" she said quietly.</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Call me what you like," he said; "that's the truth. You're a great one
  for the truth, aren't you? You'll hear plenty more of it later on, I can
  promise you. When your murdering husband is in the dock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He caught the sound of footsteps in the hall and paused. Clive came
  in.</p>

  <p>"Has the doctor come, Selby?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't sent for one."</p>

  <p>"But shouldn't you? Wouldn't it be wiser&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's no need at present," he told her. "He's not so badly hurt as he
  appeared to be. I've left Jerry with him."</p>

  <p>"But surely, Selby, a doctor should see him?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, sir," urged O'Ryan. "And the police should be told. Lane was
  saying that you haven't advised the police, and in a case like this&mdash;I
  mean, it's a rotten sort of business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can safely leave it to my discretion, O'Ryan," Clive interrupted.
  "I'm used to accidents of this kind." He went to the door. "Lane!" he
  called.</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;I mean, about the police," began O'Ryan again. "Of
  course, it's none of my business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite!" snapped Clive. "There's one thing about this mysterious affair
  which I can't understand. It's difficult to see how&mdash;oh, there you are,
  Lane. Get me an electric torch."</p>

  <p>As Lane went in search of the torch, Clive began thoughtfully pacing the
  room.</p>

  <p>"You're not&mdash;not going out, Selby?"</p>

  <p>He looked up and smiled at her.</p>

  <p>"You're wrong, my dear," he said: "I am going out&mdash;as soon as Lane
  brings the torch. But there's nothing for you to make a fuss about."</p>

  <p>"I'm hanged if I'll go&mdash;" began O'Ryan, and became suddenly silent as
  Selby Clive glanced at him.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, O'Ryan," he said, with a faint smile, "I'll let you off
  this time. I'd rather go alone."</p>

  <p>Lane came in with an electric torch and handed it to Clive.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said. "If Mr. Muller asks for me, tell him I shall be back in
  a few minutes."</p>

  <p>He crossed to the French windows, opened them, and stood peering up at the
  sky.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind the draught, Nita? I shan't be long. The storm seems to have
  passed."</p>

  <p>He switched on the torch, directed the beam onto the ground and went out
  onto the terrace.</p>

  <p>Nita hurried to the window and stood watching the spot of light as it slid
  across the glistening pavement&mdash;and as it disappeared down the steps
  that led from the terrace to the garden she drew in her breath sharply and
  turned suddenly to the manservant.</p>

  <p>"Lane&mdash;would you mind? It's terribly dark, and I don't like Mr. Clive
  being out there&mdash;alone. Of course, there's nothing to be afraid
  of&mdash;I wish you'd go with him, Lane, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, madam," said the man, and stepped out onto the terrace.</p>

  <p>O'Ryan crossed to the French windows and stood beside her, peering out
  anxiously into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"I say, Nita, what's he looking for?"</p>

  <p>She took no notice of the question. She hardly heard it. She was watching
  the small patch of light that showed where Selby was. She could see it again
  now, moving this way and that about the lawn, and she could not wrench her
  gaze away from it. If only it would move towards her, back towards the
  house....</p>

  <p>O'Ryan glanced at her curiously. Her lips were parted, and there was a
  tense, strained look on her face; it was obvious that she was very
  frightened.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Frank, I&mdash;I'm going out&mdash;if anything should
  happen&mdash;now...." She took a step forward, but he grasped her arm and
  drew her back.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," he said sharply. "Who's going to hurt Selby?" He
  laughed nervously. "I don't suppose he'll fall in the catch-pit or brain
  himself with a beam of the pergola. He reserves those amusements for other
  people. Besides, Lane's there, and Lane won't hurt him."</p>

  <p>She shook her arm free.</p>

  <p>"I shall hurt you in a minute, Frank. Why don't you go out and lend a
  hand?"</p>

  <p>"I guess it's because he just can't stand cold feet, Mrs. Clive," said
  Muller's voice.</p>

  <p>They both turned to find him standing by the fireplace, lighting a
  cigar.</p>

  <p>"But I'd not worry, O'Ryan," he went on. "It makes no odds in the long
  run. If you don't die of pneumonia you'll sure die of somep'n' else."</p>

  <p>Nita stepped back into the room.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Muller, you haven't surely left him alone?"</p>

  <p>"Old crackerjack Whitcombe? Sure I have. He's O. K. Don't suppose he'll
  die for several weeks yet. K.C.&mdash;Krazy Coot!"</p>

  <p>"What happened, Muller?" asked O'Ryan.</p>

  <p>Muller raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Happened?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, he was in a pretty ghastly state."</p>

  <p>"I've seen worse. He's a tough 'un, though. Most men of his age would have
  been dead all right."</p>

  <p>"What was it&mdash;a knife?"</p>

  <p>"He'll tell you," replied Muller. "He'll enjoy doing it. Selby
  sleuthing?"</p>

  <p>"He's on the lawn, I think," Nita told him. "He said he wouldn't be many
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"Fine! Don't hurry him when he's enjoying himself. He'll be tickled to
  death if he finds the weapon that did the deed."</p>

  <p>Nita smiled at him and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It won't do, Mr. Muller."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"You're trying very hard to make me think you're utterly heartless, but
  you're not succeeding. You're terribly sorry for poor Sir Ralph really,
  aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't say I envy him, Mrs. Clive. But I don't have to sit beside
  him and spill tears on his shirt front." There came the sound of hurried
  footsteps on the terrace, and a moment later Lane came quickly in through the
  French windows and made for the door. "Lane!"</p>

  <p>He paused with evident reluctance.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam?"</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;is anything the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Clive requires a piece of rag, madam. He wished me to be as quick as
  possible." He was out through the door before she could question him
  further.</p>

  <p>She gave a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"A piece of rag?" she repeated. "Why should Selby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rag!" exclaimed O'Ryan. "I say, Muller, there must be&mdash;he's found
  somebody else&mdash;wounded&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frank&mdash;Mr. Muller&mdash;please go and&mdash;no, I'll go!" She turned
  and hurried towards the French windows, but as she reached them Clive came
  in. He was carrying a small leather attach case, sodden and discoloured by
  the rain. He dumped it on the writing desk.</p>

  <p>"Look at this, Nita," he said. He spread out his hands, displaying the
  palms for her inspection. They were smeared with red.</p>

  <p>O'Ryan took a quick step backwards.</p>

  <p>"My God, sir&mdash;blood!"</p>

  <p>Lane came hurrying in with a large piece of white rag, and as Clive took
  it from him he glanced at O'Ryan and a smile of amusement flickered round his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"Nothing so melodramatic, O'Ryan," he said, as he began wiping his hands
  on the rag. "You go to the pictures too much. It's not blood; it's
  paint."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">"SELBY, are you&mdash;sure?"</p>

  <p>Nita's voice was unsteady, but her eyes were suddenly bright as she
  stepped forward quickly to get a closer view.</p>

  <p>Clive smiled at her.</p>

  <p>"I know red paint when I see it, my dear," he said, "and I haven't such a
  craving for the dramatic as O'Ryan. I've had enough drama to last my
  lifetime&mdash;eh, Jerry?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," agreed the lawyer. "And enough paint, too, by the look of it."</p>

  <p>Nita still stood staring at his hands as he wiped them, and he paused for
  a moment and held up the rag.</p>

  <p>"Smell it yourself and be satisfied," he laughed.</p>

  <p>She leaned forward, sniffed at the rag, and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Paint!" she said&mdash;to herself, it seemed. "Just red paint!"</p>

  <p>Clive nodded, and continued wiping his hands.</p>

  <p>"Just like that damned post office," he went on. "After doing nothing for
  months, they suddenly put up that pillar box, daub it with paint, and never
  say a word to anyone about it. It's right at the entrance to the drive, and
  that's twice I've walked into it this evening. They ought to give me six
  months' free postal service as compensation for the dress shirt I ruined
  before dinner." He tossed the rag aside. "By the look of things," he added,
  "poor old Whitcombe must have cuddled it. He has got the stuff all over him.
  He'll need a bath in turpentine before he'll look presentable."</p>

  <p>He snapped back the catches of the attach case. "Now let's see if we can
  get to the bottom of all this." He opened the case, took out a bundle of
  newspaper cuttings, glanced at it casually, and laid it aside. "Press
  cuttings&mdash;stuff for his book, I suppose," he said. "They'd hardly
  explain things, eh, Jerry?"</p>

  <p>Muller smiled.</p>

  <p>"Strong stuff, I guess, Selby, but not strong enough to account for old
  Whitcombe."</p>

  <p>Clive rummaged in the case for some moments and then brought out the small
  flask-shaped bottle, which he held up.</p>

  <p>"Ah! What's this?" He smelt it, frowned, smelt it again, and shook his
  head. "What is it, Jerry?" he said.</p>

  <p>Muller took the bottle, sniffed it several times, and handed it back.</p>

  <p>"It's a new one on me," he said, "and I thought I knew 'em all."</p>

  <p>Nita smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's vodka, Selby," she said. "Sir Ralph always carries some about with
  him in that bottle. He showed it to me one day."</p>

  <p>Clive smelt the bottle again.</p>

  <p>"Vodka, eh? What do you say to vodka, Jerry?"</p>

  <p>"I'd say no wonder Russia's what she is!"</p>

  <p>"He takes it for chills," explained Nita.</p>

  <p>Clive turned the bottle upside down and smiled.</p>

  <p>"He must have had a good few chills this evening, Nita," he laughed. "Poor
  old Whitcombe! I can just imagine what happened. He must have lost his
  way&mdash;took shelter, perhaps, under a tree from the storm&mdash;and got a
  chill ... and then another chill ... and then another, until at last&mdash;"
  He smiled and set the bottle on the table. "The marvel is that he ever
  managed to find his way here at all."</p>

  <p>"I guess the pillar box puzzled him," said Muller. "Sort of new feature in
  the landscape. Well, they'll be needing another pot or two of paint to make
  it look like a pillar box. Judging by his face, I should say he kissed
  it."</p>

  <p>Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid he must have given you a bad fright, Nita," he said, "suddenly
  appearing at the window like that."</p>

  <p>"Just for a moment," she admitted. "It was silly to scream, though, but
  both Frank and I were scared for a few seconds." She smiled. "It was the
  blood, I suppose&mdash;eh, Frank?"</p>

  <p>"He looked pretty ghastly, sir," said O'Ryan. "Just for the moment I
  thought he'd&mdash;had an accident."</p>

  <p>"And the pictures did the rest," laughed Clive. "What do we do with old
  Whitcombe now, Nita? We can't send him home as he is, and there's no car to
  take him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The handle of the door rattled, and they all glanced towards it. It
  rattled again, turning first one way and then the other; and then the door
  was slowly opened a little way, and Sir Ralph's head was thrust in. It was a
  grotesque-looking head, with wildly disordered hair, of which dank, matted
  pieces straggled over the forehead, discoloured by daubs of red paint, half
  wiped away, and a pair of bloodshot eyes that peered at each of them in turn.
  The face broke into a cheery smile.</p>

  <p>"Friends!" said Sir Ralph thickly. "All friends!"</p>

  <p>The door was swung wide open, and he stood there, slightly swaying,
  looking, with his stained and crumpled shirt front, his collar missing, and
  his clothes creased into absurd shapes, like some comic figure from a
  pantomime.</p>

  <p>He advanced unsteadily into the room.</p>

  <p>"Awf'ly sorry, Clive," he said; "awf'ly sorry to trouble you&mdash;at this
  time o' night. If it weren't so awf'ly important I wouldn't dream of
  troubling you."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Whitcombe," said Clive amiably. "What is it you
  want?"</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph beamed at him.</p>

  <p>"You're a good fellow, Clive&mdash;specially at this time of night." His
  face became suddenly anxious. "I'm not keeping you up, am I? I hate keeping
  people up. Those young devils&mdash;I beg your pardon, Mrs. Clive&mdash;but
  they keep me awake every night at the Boscombes'!"</p>

  <p>"You're not keeping us up, Sir Ralph," Nita assured him. "We weren't even
  thinking of bed."</p>

  <p>"No? Most interesting! Tha'sh all right, then, because I want to ask your
  husband something. S'long as I'm not keeping anybody up, tha'sh all right. Is
  that Mr. Muller over there?" He turned to Muller, smiling genially. "Most
  remarkable thing, Mr. Muller," he said&mdash;"most remarkable thing your name
  should be Muller too. I must talk to you about that." He waved a hand as if
  dismissing Muller. "Some other time, Muller. Don't worry me about it now; I
  want to talk to Clive."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to ask me, Whitcombe?" inquired Clive.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you thish," said Sir Ralph, raising a finger and regarding
  him gravely. "Did you&mdash;in my bag&mdash;did you find a little
  bottle?"</p>

  <p>Clive nodded.</p>

  <p>"I found a little bottle and little else, Whitcombe," he laughed.</p>

  <p>He went to the desk, picked up the bottle and handed it to him. Sir Ralph
  stared at it for a few moments, held it up to the light, frowned, and shook
  his head gloomily. And then he turned to Nita and gave her his genial
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Chills," he said, tapping the bottle.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I remember, Sir Ralph," she smiled. "It's splendid for chills, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Marvellous," he assured her. "Who told you that, Mrs. Clive? Awfly good
  for chills&mdash;Russian doctor told me&mdash;nice fellow. Most respectable
  sort of Russian, I thought. Most interesting and intelligent. He told me that
  in Moscow But I'm keeping you up. I'm afraid I do keep people up when I start
  talking about my book. You shall read my book, Clive. You, too, Mrs. Clive. I
  intend to give you both a copy." He glanced at Muller.</p>

  <p>"O.K.," said Muller. "I'll buy one."</p>

  <p>"It's to be published at ten-and-six," said Sir Ralph. "Most thrilling and
  absorbing. You won't be able to put it down. I shall keep more women awake at
  nights than any man in England."</p>

  <p>"You're rather complimentary to yourself, Whitcombe," laughed Clive.</p>

  <p>"My dear Clive, when you've read my book you'll see that I've every reason
  to be colli&mdash;colpi&mdash;every reason to be proud of myself. But tha'sh
  all right. Now listen&mdash;listen everybody." He turned again to Muller.
  "Listen, my dear learned friend. I've got that last little bit of data."</p>

  <p>"Fine!" said Muller. "And now you're going to trot off to bed like a good
  boy. Unless you go to bed early you'll never be a judge."</p>

  <p>"Tha'sh all right," said Sir Ralph; "I don't want to be a
  judge&mdash;ghastly job&mdash;perfectly ghastly jub being a jodge&mdash;I've
  got that last little bit of data&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nita beckoned to Lane.</p>

  <p>"Tell the maids to get the spare room ready, please, Lane."</p>

  <p>The man nodded and went out.</p>

  <p>"Last little bit of data," repeated Sir Ralph.
  "Absolutely&mdash;data&mdash;last little bit. Most absorbing and interesting
  case, Clive&mdash;remarkable psychological study&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is this case you're so interested in, Whitcombe?" asked Clive.</p>

  <p>"Aha!" exclaimed Sir Ralph slyly. "Still, you're a good fellow, Clive, and
  as long as I'm not keeping anybody up I don't mind telling you."</p>

  <p>Nita half rose from her chair, but instantly returned to it. It was
  hopeless to try to interfere, she reflected; she would probably only make
  matters worse. If Sir Ralph meant to blurt out the whole story she could do
  nothing to prevent him.</p>

  <p>"The case I'm writing about," said Sir Ralph&mdash;"I'll tell you, Clive:
  it's the case of a man called Dennis Sanderby &mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>It was Muller's voice. He had stepped forward and was staring hard at Sir
  Ralph, who stood smiling benevolently back at him; but Nita had not missed
  the looks that had flashed between Muller and her husband. She glanced at
  O'Ryan, but he did not look at her. He was edging towards the door, his gaze
  fixed on Selby Clive, his right hand thrust into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Dennis Sanderby," repeated Sir Ralph. "Last little bit of data. Got it
  somewhere." He began groping in his pockets. "Got the
  telegram&mdash;cablegram&mdash;all the way from Canada&mdash;must have it
  somewhere&mdash;ah!" He pulled a crumpled paper from his pocket and held it
  out to Muller. "There's the last bit of data, my learned friend. Read it for
  yourself. Read it to everybody. You're not keeping anybody up&mdash;tha'sh
  all right!" Muller took the cablegram, glanced at it, then at Selby Clive's
  set face, and began to read:</p>

  <p class="telegram">"REPLY YOUR INQUIRY. DENNIS SANDERBY DIED INSANE ASYLUM
  WINNIPEG LAST OCTOBER."</p>

  <p>Nita's eyes were on Clive. She saw his hand suddenly clench and his
  eyelids flutter.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" he said in a low voice. "My God, Jerry, if that's true&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure it's true," said Muller. "This wire's from the police. Dennis
  Sanderby's dead, thank God! I wish he'd died twenty years ago!"</p>

  <p>"No, no! That's not correct, my learned friend," said Sir Ralph. "Not
  twenty years ago&mdash;died last October." Lane appeared at the door, and
  Nita, catching his eye, nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your room is ready, Sir Ralph," she said. "Lane will show you the
  way."</p>

  <p>"Awfly nice of you, Mrs. Clive," he said. "Awf'ly nice of Lane, too. Good
  fellow, Lane. Most respectable type of servant, I thought. But I was going to
  tell you about Dennis Sanderby, wasn't I?"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow, Sir Ralph," smiled Nita. "I'm rather tired tonight."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then, I am keeping you up, Mrs. Clive. I apologize. I'll tell you
  about Dennis Sanderby in the morning&mdash;at breakfast. Where's Lane?"</p>

  <p>Lane opened the door.</p>

  <p>"This way, sir, if you please," he said.</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph went unsteadily to the door and paused.</p>

  <p>"I shall sleep well tonight," he announced. "Now that I have that last
  little bit of data, I shall certainly sleep well." He waved a hand.
  "Good-night, everybody," he said, as he went out into the hall. "A very
  pleasant evening. Quite an unusually enjoyable evening, I thought. But I hope
  I haven't kept anybody up...." As Lane closed the door, Nita seated herself
  on the couch and glanced across at Clive. She had a feeling that this was the
  moment, that she must not miss it, that if she let this opportunity slip it
  would never recur. If Clive did not tell her now, she felt that he would
  never tell her, that there would always be that doubt in his mind, that there
  would always be that barrier between them. She must at any rate give him the
  chance.... "Selby!"</p>

  <p>He turned towards her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;and Mr. Muller&mdash;you seemed terribly relieved when you
  heard that Dennis Sanderby was dead. Did you&mdash;either of you&mdash;know
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Sure we did&mdash;both of us, Mrs. Clive," said Muller.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who was he?"</p>

  <p>It was her husband who answered her.</p>

  <p>"A man in Canada, Nita," he said&mdash;"a cunning and brutal murderer who
  escaped the gallows twenty years ago. The case caused a great sensation at
  the time. Jerry defended him."</p>

  <p>"He got off without me," said Muller. "I'd have hanged him if I'd had my
  way."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I see," said Nita. "Is that&mdash;all?"</p>

  <p>She saw that Clive was hesitating, saw the doubt in his eyes as he glanced
  towards Muller. The lawyer made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"Go on, man&mdash;go on!" he said brusquely. "Now you've started, go on
  and finish. You'll be doing it three years too late, anyway."</p>

  <p>"All right, Jerry," replied Clive. "No doubt you're right again."</p>

  <p>He turned and faced Nita, and she smiled at him, trying to tell him by
  that smile all that she was feeling&mdash;that she trusted him, that she
  loved him, that no matter what he might tell her she would still love
  him.</p>

  <p>"The horrible thing about the affair, my dear," he said slowly, "was that
  my name was Dennis Sanderby, too. Like a fool, I didn't take Jerry's advice
  and change my name immediately. I didn't think that having the same name
  could possibly do me any damage; I thought Jerry was making a fuss over
  nothing."</p>

  <p>Nita was still smiling at him; but her heart was pounding, and her throat
  had that queer, strained feeling, and for some reason or other she badly
  wanted to cry.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Muller was right, Selby?"</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"After Dennis Sanderby was acquitted," he went on, "my life was hell. I
  was turned out of hotels, hooted in the street. I hardly dared to show my
  face out of doors. And then one day&mdash;in Saskatoon&mdash;the crowd
  mistook me for the murderer and tried to lynch me. It was&mdash;pretty
  horrible, Nita. Luckily, Jerry was in the street at the time; it was his
  eloquence that saved my life. They had actually got the rope round my neck
  when he managed to reach me. The crowd knew Jerry. He told them that they
  were making a mistake, that I was not the Dennis Sanderby they thought I was.
  They accepted his word and let me go. I wish you could have heard that
  speech, Nita. Jerry was absolutely inspired. He held that crowd&mdash;swayed
  them just as he liked&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you're going to start getting grateful, Selby," interposed Muller, "I
  guess I'm going to bed. Good-night, everybody."</p>

  <p>He turned and hurried from the room, and Nita got up from the couch and
  went to where Clive was standing.</p>

  <p>"And then, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"And then, my dear, I changed my name to Selby Clive&mdash;as I should
  have done when Jerry first advised it."</p>

  <p>She nodded, her lips quivering and her eyes moist, and for some moments
  the silence was unbroken. And then she looked towards O'Ryan, and there was
  triumph in her eyes&mdash;triumph and scorn and anger and a great joy. But he
  did not meet her look.</p>

  <p>"That's a rather extraordinary story, sir&mdash;" he began; and then, as
  his glance met Nita's, he fell suddenly silent.</p>

  <p>Nita went to the door, opened it, and stood there waiting, her hand on the
  knob.</p>

  <p>"Please, Frank," she said.</p>

  <p>Without a word he went out of the room.</p>

  <p>She turned again to her husband.</p>

  <p>"Selby, my dear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can guess what you're going to say, Nita," he said: "that I should have
  told you. Perhaps I should. Jerry said so. He has never ceased to rub it in
  that I was in honour bound to tell you. He was at me again only yesterday
  when he telephoned from the Laffan. He begged me to tell you everything and
  trust you to understand. There was only one thing to do, in his view: have it
  out with you once and for all and get it over."</p>

  <p>"And why didn't you, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't see it that way," he told her. "I didn't want you to know that
  you might have had a name that was hated from one end of Canada to the other.
  Perhaps I was wrong. I might have known that you trusted me, that you would
  understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do, Selby," she said softly. "And you? Tell me, Selby, please&mdash;do
  you&mdash;absolutely&mdash;trust me? Have you always absolutely trusted
  me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"Always, my dear&mdash;and absolutely."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him, turned suddenly away and crossed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Selby!"</p>

  <p>He glanced towards her. She raised her hand, took the small silver bolt
  between finger and thumb, and pushed it across.</p>

  <p>"Understand, Selby?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Just you and I, Selby, in future," she said, "and everything else in the
  world&mdash;bolted out."</p>
