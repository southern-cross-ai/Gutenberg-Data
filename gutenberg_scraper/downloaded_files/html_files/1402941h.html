  <h3>PART I</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. PERCIVAL BLAND was a somewhat uncommon type of criminal. In the first
  place he really had an appreciable amount of common-sense. If he had only had
  a little more, he would not have been a criminal at all. As it was, he had
  just sufficient judgment to perceive that the consequences of unlawful acts
  accumulate as the acts are repeated; to realise that the criminal's position
  must, at length, become untenable; and to take what he considered fair
  precautions against the inevitable catastrophe.</p>

  <p>But in spite of these estimable traits of character and the precautions
  aforesaid, Mr. Bland found himself in rather a tight place and with a
  prospect of increasing tightness. The causes of this uncomfortable tension do
  not concern us, and may be dismissed with the remark, that, if one
  perseveringly distributes flash Bank of England notes among the
  money-changers of the Continent, there will come a day of reckoning when
  those notes are tendered to the exceedingly knowing old lady who lives in
  Threadneedle Street.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bland considered uneasily the approaching storm-cloud as he raked over
  the "miscellaneous property" in the Sale-rooms of Messrs. Plimpton. He was a
  confirmed frequenter of auctions, as was not unnatural, for the criminal is
  essentially a gambler. And criminal and gambler have one quality in common:
  each hopes to get something of value without paying the market price for
  it.</p>

  <p>So Percival turned over the dusty oddments and his own difficulties at one
  and the same time. The vital questions were: When would the storm burst? And
  would it pass by the harbour of refuge that he had been at such pains to
  construct? Let us inspect that harbour of refuge.</p>

  <p>A quiet flat in the pleasant neighbourhood of Battersea bore a name-plate
  inscribed, Mr. Robert Lindsay; and the tenant was known to the porter and the
  char woman who attended to the flat, as a fair-haired gentleman who was
  engaged in the book trade as a travelling agent, and was consequently a good
  deal away from home. Now Mr. Robert Lindsay bore a distinct resemblance to
  Percival Bland; which was not sur prising seeing that they were first cousins
  (or, at any rate, they said they were; and we may presume that they knew).
  But they were not very much alike. Mr. Lindsay had flaxen, or rather sandy,
  hair; Mr. Bland's hair was black. Mr. Bland had a mole under his left eye;
  Mr. Lindsay had no mole under his eye&mdash;but carried one in a small box in
  his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>At somewhat rare intervals the Cousins called on one another; but they had
  the very worst of luck, for neither of them ever seemed to find the other at
  home. And what was even more odd was that whenever Mr. Bland spent an evening
  at home in his lodgings over the oil shop in Bloomsbury, Mr. Lindsay's flat
  was empty; and as sure as Mr. Lindsay was at home in his flat so surely were
  Mr. Bland's lodgings vacant for the time being. It was a queer coincidence,
  if anyone had noticed it; but nobody ever did.</p>

  <p>However, if Percival saw little of his cousin, it was not a case of "out
  of sight, out of mind." On the contrary; so great was his solicitude for the
  latter's welfare that he not only had made a will constituting him his
  executor and sole legatee, but he had actually insured his life for no less a
  sum than three thousand pounds; and this will, together with the insurance
  policy, investment securities and other necessary documents, he had placed in
  the custody of a highly respectable solicitor. All of which did him great
  credit. It isn't every man who is willing to take so much trouble for a mere
  cousin.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bland continued his perambulations, pawing over the miscellaneous
  raffle from sheer force of habit, reflecting on the coming crisis in his own
  affairs, and on the provisions that he had made for his cousin Robert. As for
  the latter, they were excellent as far as they went, but they lacked
  definiteness and perfect completeness. There was the contingency of a
  "stretch," for instance; say fourteen years' penal servitude. The insurance
  policy did not cover that. And, meanwhile, what was to become of the
  estimable Robert?</p>

  <p>He had bruised his thumb somewhat severely in a screw-cutting lathe, and
  had abstractedly turned the handle of a bird-organ until politely requested
  by an attendant to desist, when he came upon a series of boxes containing,
  according to the catalogue, "a collection of surgical instruments the
  property of a lately deceased practitioner." To judge by the appearance of
  the instruments, the practitioner must have commenced practice in his early
  youth and died at a very advanced age. They were an uncouth set of tools, of
  no value whatever excepting as testimonials to the amazing tenacity of life
  of our ancestors; but Percival fingered them over according to his wont,
  working the handle of a complicated brass syringe and ejecting a drop of
  greenish fluid on to the shirt of a dressy Hebrew (who requested him to
  "point the dam' thing at thomeone elth nectht time"), opening musty leather
  cases, clicking off spring scarifiers and feeling the edges of strange,
  crooked, knives. Then he came upon a largish black box, which, when he raised
  the lid, breathed out an ancient and fish-like aroma and exhibited a
  collection of bones, yellow, greasy and spotted in places with mildew. The
  catalogue described them as "a complete set of human osteology" but they were
  not an ordinary "student's set," for the bones of the hands and feet, instead
  of being strung together on cat-gut, were united by their original ligaments
  and were of an unsavoury brown colour.</p>

  <p>"I thay, misther," expostulated the Hebrew, "shut that bocth. Thmellth like a blooming inquetht."</p>

  <p>But the contents of the black box seemed to have a fascination for
  Percival. He looked in at those greasy remnants of mortality, at the brown
  and mouldy hands and feet and the skull that peeped forth eerily from the
  folds of a flannel wrapping; and they breathed out something more than that
  stale and musty odour. A suggestion&mdash;vague and general at first, but
  rapidly crystallising into distinct shape&mdash;seemed to steal out of the
  black box into his consciousness; a suggestion that somehow seemed to connect
  itself with his estimable cousin Robert.</p>

  <p>For upwards of a minute he stood motionless, as one immersed in reverie,
  the lid poised in his hand and a dreamy eye fixed on the half skull. A stir
  in the room roused him. The sale was about to begin. The members of the
  knock-out and other habitués seated themselves on benches around a long,
  baize table; the attendants took possession of the first lots and opened
  their catalogues as if about to sing an introductory chorus; and a gentleman
  with a waxed moustache and a striking resemblance to his late Majesty, the
  third Napoleon, having ascended to the rostrum bespoke the attention of the
  assembly by a premonitory tap with his hammer.</p>

  <p>How odd are some of the effects of a guilty conscience! With what absurd
  self-consciousness do we read into the minds of others our own undeclared
  intentions, when those intentions are unlawful! Had Percival Bland wanted a
  set of human bones for any legitimate purpose&mdash;such as anatomical
  study&mdash;he would have bought it openly and unembarrassed. Now, he found
  himself earnestly debating whether he should not bid for some of the surgical
  instruments, just for the sake of appearances; and there being little time in
  which to make up his mind&mdash;for the deceased practitioner's effects came
  first in the catalogue&mdash;he was already the richer by a set of
  cupping-glasses, a tooth-key, and an instrument of unknown use and diabolical
  aspect, before the fateful lot was called.</p>

  <p>At length the black box was laid on the table, an object of obscene mirth
  to the knockers-out, and the auctioneer read the entry: "Lot seventeen; a
  complete set of human osteology. A very useful and valuable set of specimens,
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>He looked round at the assembly majestically, oblivious of sundry
  inquiries as to the identity of the deceased and the verdict of the coroner's
  jury, and finally suggested five shillings.</p>

  <p>"Six," said Percival.</p>

  <p>An attendant held the box open, and, chanting the mystic word "Loddlemen!"
  (which, being interpreted, meant "Lot, gentlemen"), thrust it under the
  rather bulbous nose of the smart Hebrew; who remarked that "they 'ummed a bit
  too much to thoot him" and pushed it away.</p>

  <p>"Going at six shillings," said the auctioneer, reproachfully; and as
  nobody contradicted him, he smote the rostrum with his hammer and the box was
  delivered into the hands of Percival on the payment of that modest sum.</p>

  <p>Having crammed the cupping-glasses, the tooth-key and the unknown
  instrument into the box, Percival obtained from one of the attendants a
  length of cord, with which he secured the lid. Then he carried his treasure
  out into the street, and, chartering a four-wheeler, directed the driver to
  proceed to Charing Cross Station. At the station he booked the box in the
  cloak (in the name of Simpson) and left it for a couple of hours; at the
  expiration of which he returned, and, employing a different porters had it
  conveyed to a hansom, in which it was borne to his lodgings over the oil-shop
  in Bloomsbury. There he, himself, carried it, unobserved, up the stairs, and,
  depositing it in a large cupboard, locked the door and pocketed the key.</p>

  <p>And thus was the curtain rung down on the first act. The second act opened
  only a couple of days later, the office of call-boy&mdash;to pursue the
  metaphor to the bitter end&mdash;being discharged by a Belgian police
  official who emerged from the main entrance to the Bank of England. What
  should have led Percival Bland into so unsafe a neighbourhood it is difficult
  to imagine, unless it was that strange fascination that seems so frequently
  to lure the criminal to places associated with his crime. But there he was
  within a dozen paces of the entrance when the officer came forth, and mutual
  recognition was instant. Almost equally instantaneous was the self-possessed
  Percival's decision to cross the road.</p>

  <p>It is not a nice road to cross. The old horse would condescend to shout a
  warning to the indiscreet wayfarer. Not so the modern chauffeur, who looks
  stonily before him and leaves you to get out of the way of Juggernaut. He
  knows his "exonerating" coroner's jury. At the moment, however, the
  procession of Juggernauts was at rest; but Percival had seen the presiding
  policeman turn to move away and he darted across the fronts of the vehicles
  even as they started. The foreign officer followed. But in that moment the
  whole procession had got in motion. A motor omnibus thundered past in front
  of him; another was bearing down on him relentlessly. He hesitated, and
  sprang back; and then a taxi-cab, darting out from behind, butted him
  heavily, sending him sprawling in the road, whence he scrambled as best he
  could back on to the pavement.</p>

  <p>Percival, meanwhile, had swung himself lightly on to the footboard of the
  first omnibus just as it was gathering speed. A few seconds saw him safely
  across at the Mansion House, and in a few more, he was whirling down Queen
  Victoria Street. The danger was practically over, though he took the
  precaution to alight at St. Paul's, and, crossing to Newgate Street, board
  another west-bound omnibus.</p>

  <p>That night he sat in his lodgings turning over his late experience. It had
  been a narrow shave. That sort of thing mustn't happen again. In fact, seeing
  that the law was undoubtedly about to be set in motion, it was high time that
  certain little plans of his should be set in motion, too. Only, there was a
  difficulty; a serious difficulty. And as Percival thought round and round
  that difficulty his brows wrinkled and he hummed a soft refrain.</p>

  <p>"Then is the time for disappearing,<br></p>

  <p>Take a header&mdash;down you go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A tap at the door cut his song short. It was his landlady, Mrs. Brattle; a
  civil woman, and particularly civil just now. For she had a little request to
  make.</p>

  <p>"It was about Christmas Night, Mr. Bland," said Mrs. Brattle. "My husband
  and me thought of spending the evening with his brother at Hornsey, and we
  were going to let the maid go home to her mother's for the night, if it
  wouldn't put you out."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't put me out in the least, Mrs. Brattle," said Percival.</p>

  <p>"You needn't sit up for us, you see," pursued Mrs. Brattle, "if you just
  leave the side door unbolted. We shan't be home before two or three; but
  we'll come in quiet not to disturb you."</p>

  <p>"You won't disturb me," Percival replied with a genial laugh. "I'm a sober
  man in general but 'Christmas comes but once a year'. When once I'm tucked up
  in bed, I shall take a bit of waking on Christmas Night."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brattle smiled indulgently. "And you won't feel lonely, all alone in
  the house?"</p>

  <p>"Lonely!" exclaimed Percival. "Lonely! With a roaring fire, a jolly book,
  a box of good cigars and a bottle of sound port&mdash;ah, and a second bottle
  if need be. Not I."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brattle shook her head. "Ah," said she, "you bachelors! Well, well.
  It's a good thing to be independent," and with this profound reflection she
  smiled herself out of the room and descended the stairs.</p>

  <p>As her footsteps died away Percival sprang from his chair and began
  excitedly to pace the room. His eyes sparkled and his face was wreathed with
  smiles. Presently he halted before the fireplace and, gazing into the embers,
  laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"Damn funny!" said he. "Deuced rich! Neat! Very neat! Ha! Ha!" And here he
  resumed his interrupted song: "When the sky above is clearing, When the sky
  above is clearing, Bob up serenely, bob up serenely, Bob up serenely from
  below!"</p>

  <p>Which may be regarded as closing the first scene, of the second act.</p>

  <p>During the few days that intervened before Christmas Percival went abroad
  but little; and yet he was a busy man. He did a little surreptitious
  shopping, venturing out as far as Charing Cross Road; and his purchases were
  decidedly miscellaneous. A porridge saucepan, a second-hand copy of "Gray's
  Anatomy," a rabbit skin, a large supply of glue and upwards of ten pounds of
  shin of beef seems a rather odd assortment; and it was a mercy that the
  weather was frosty, for otherwise Percival's bedroom, in which these
  delicacies were deposited under lock and key, would have yielded odorous
  traces of its wealth.</p>

  <p>But it was in the long evenings that his industry was most conspicuous;
  and then it was that the big cupboard with the excellent lever lock, which he
  himself had fixed on, began to fill up with the fruits of his labours. In
  those evenings the porridge saucepan would simmer on the hob with a rich
  lading of good Scotch glue, the black box of the deceased practitioner would
  be hauled forth from its hiding-place, and the well-thumbed "Gray" laid open
  on the table.</p>

  <p>It was an arduous business though; a stiffer task than he had bargained
  for. The right and left bones were so confoundedly alike, and the bones that
  joined were so difficult to fit together. However, the plates in "Gray" were
  large and very clear, so it was only a question of taking enough trouble.</p>

  <p>His method of work was simple and practical. Having fished a bone out of
  the box, he would compare it with the illustrations in the book until he had
  identified it beyond all doubt, when he would tie on it a paper label with
  its name and side&mdash;right or left. Then he would search for the adjoining
  bone, and, having fitted the two together, would secure them with a good daub
  of glue and lay them in the fender to dry. It was a crude and horrible method
  of articulation that would have made a museum curator shudder. But it seemed
  to answer Percival's purpose&mdash;whatever that may have been&mdash;for
  gradually the loose "items" came together into recognisable members such as
  arms and legs, the vertebra&mdash;which were, fortunately, strung in their
  order on a thick cord&mdash;were joined up into a solid backbone, and even
  the ribs, which were the toughest job of all, fixed on in some semblance of a
  thorax. It was a wretched performance. The bones were plastered with gouts of
  glue and yet would have broken apart at a touch. But, as we have said,
  Percival seemed satisfied, and as he was the only person concerned, there was
  no more to be said.</p>

  <p>In due course, Christmas Day arrived. Percival dined with the Brattles at
  two, dozed after dinner, woke up for tea, and then, as Mrs. Brattle, in
  purple and fine raiment, came in to remove the tea-tray, he spread out on the
  table the materials for the night's carouse. A quarter of an hour later, the
  side slammed, and, peering out of the window, he saw the shopkeeper and his
  wife hurrying away up the gas-lit street towards the nearest omnibus
  route.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Percival Bland began his evening's entertainment; and a most
  remark entertainment it was, even for a solitary bachelor, left alone in a
  house on Christmas Night. First, he took off his clothing and dressed himself
  in a fresh suit. Then, from the cupboard he brought forth the reconstituted
  "set of osteology" and, laying the various members on the table, returned to
  the bedroom, whence he presently reappeared with a large, savoury parcel
  which he had disinterred from a trunk. The parcel being opened revealed his
  accumulated purchases in the matter of shin of beef.</p>

  <p>With a large knife, providently sharpened before hand, he cut the beef
  into large, thin slices which he proceed to wrap around the various bones
  that formed the "complete set;" whereby their nakedness was certainly
  mitigated though their attractiveness was by no means increased. Having thus
  "clothed the dry bones," he gathered up the scraps of offal that were left,
  to be placed presently inside the trunk. It was an extraordinary proceeding,
  but the next was more extraordinary still.</p>

  <p>Taking up the newly clothed members one by one, he began very carefully to
  insinuate them into the garments that he had recently shed. It was a ticklish
  business, for the glued joints were as brittle as glass. Very cautiously the
  legs were separately inducted, first into underclothing and then into
  trousers, the skeleton feet were fitted with the cast-off socks and
  delicately persuaded into the boots. The arms, in like manner, were gingerly
  pressed into their various sleeves and through the arm-holes of the
  waistcoat; and then came the most difficult task of all&mdash;to fit the
  garments on the trunk. For the skull and ribs, secured to the back-bone with
  mere spots of glue, were ready to drop off at a shake; and yet the garments
  had to be drawn over them with the arms enclosed in the sleeves. But Percival
  managed it at last by resting his "restoration" in the big, padded arm-chair
  and easing the garments on inch by inch.</p>

  <p>It now remained only to give the finishing touch; which was done by
  cutting the rabbit-skin to the requisite shape and affixing it to the skull
  with a thin coat of stiff glue; and when the skull had thus been finished
  with a sort of crude, makeshift wig, its appearance was so appalling as even
  to disturb the nerves of the matter-of-fact Percival. However, this was no
  occasion for cherishing sentiment. A skull in an extemporised wig or false
  scalp might be, and in fact was, a highly unpleasant object; but so was a
  Belgian police officer.</p>

  <p>Having finished the "restoration," Percival fetched the water-jug from his
  bedroom, and, descending to the shop, the door of which had been left
  unlocked, tried the taps of the various drums and barrels until he came to
  the one which contained methylated spirit; and from this he filled his jug
  and returned to the bedroom. Pouring the spirit out into the basin, he tucked
  a towel round his neck and filling his sponge with spirit proceeded very
  vigorously to wash his hair and eyebrows; and as, by degrees, the spirit in
  the basin grew dark and turbid, so did his hair and eyebrows grow lighter in
  colour until, after a final energetic rub with a towel, they had acquired a
  golden or sandy hue indistinguishable from that of the hair of his cousin
  Robert. Even the mole under his eye was susceptible to the changing
  conditions, for when he had wetted it thoroughly with spirit, he was able,
  with the blade of a penknife to peel it off as neatly as if it had been stuck
  on with spirit-gum. Having done which, he deposited it in a tiny box which he
  carried in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>The proceedings which followed were unmistakable as to their object. First
  he carried the basin of spirit through into the sitting-room and deliberately
  poured its contents on to the floor by the arm-chair. Then, having returned
  the basin to the bedroom, he again went down to the shop, where he selected a
  couple of galvanised buckets from the stock, filled them with paraffin oil
  from one of the great drums and carried them upstairs. The oil from one
  bucket he poured over the armchair and its repulsive occupant; the other
  bucket he simply emptied on the carpet, and then went down to the shop for a
  fresh supply.</p>

  <p>When this proceeding had been repeated once or twice the entire floor and
  all the furniture were saturated, and such a reek of paraffin filled the air
  of the room that Percival thought it wise to turn out the gas. Returning to
  the shop, be poured a bucketful of oil over the stack of bundles of firewood,
  another over the counter and floor and a third over the loose articles on the
  walls and hanging from the ceiling. Looking up at the latter be now perceived
  a number of greasy patches where the oil had soaked through from the floor
  above, and some of these were beginning to drip on to the shop floor.</p>

  <p>He now made his final preparations. Taking a bundle of "Wheel"
  firelighters, he made a small pile against the stack of firewood. In the
  midst of the firelighters he placed a ball of string saturated in paraffin;
  and in the central hole of the ball he stuck a half-dozen diminutive
  Christmas candles. This mine was now ready. Providing himself with a stock of
  firelighters, a few balls of paraffined string and a dozen or so of the
  little candles, he went upstairs to the sitting-room, which was immediately
  above the shop. Here, by the glow of the fire, he built up one or two piles
  of firelighters around and partly under the arm-chair, placed the balls of
  string on the piles and stuck two or three bundles in each ball. Everything
  was now ready. Stepping into the bedroom, he took from the cupboard a spare
  overcoat, a new hat and a new umbrella&mdash;for he must leave his old hats,
  coat and umbrella in the hall. He put on the coat and hat, and, with the
  umbrella in his hand, returned to the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>Opposite the arm-chair he stood awhile, irresolute, and a pang of horror
  shot through him. It was a terrible thing that he was going to do; a thing
  the consequences of which no one could foresee. He glanced furtively at the
  awful shape that sat huddled in the chair, its horrible head all awry and its
  rigid limbs sprawling in hideous grotesque deformity. It was but a dummy, a
  mere scarecrow; but yet, in the dim firelight, the grisly face under that
  horrid wig seemed to leer intelligently, to watch him with secret malice out
  of its shadowy eye-sockets, until he looked away with clammy skin and a
  shiver of half-superstitious terror.</p>

  <p>But this would never do. The evening had run out, consumed by these
  engrossing labours; it was nearly eleven o'clock, and high time for him to be
  gone. For if the Brattles should return prematurely he was lost. Pulling
  himself together with an effort, he struck a match and lit the little candles
  one after the other. In a quarter of an hour or so, they would have burned
  down to the balls of string, and then&mdash;He walked quickly out of the
  room; but, at the door, he paused for a moment to look back at the ghastly
  figure, seated rigidly in the chair with the lighted candles at its feet,
  like some foul fiend appeased by votive fires. The unsteady flames threw
  flickering shadows on its face that made it seem to mow and gibber and grin
  in mockery of all his care and caution. So he turned and tremblingly ran down
  the stairs&mdash;opening the staircase window as he went. Running into the
  shop, he lit the candles there and ran out again, shutting the door after
  him.</p>

  <p>Secretly and guiltily he crept down the hall, and opening the door a few
  inches peered out. A blast of icy wind poured in with a light powdering of
  dry snow. He opened his umbrella, flung open the door, looked up and down the
  empty street, stepped out, closed the door softly and strode away over the
  whitening pavement.</p>

  <h3>PART II</h3>

  <h3>(Related by Christopher Jervis, M.D.)</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was one of the axioms of medico-legal practice laid down by my
  colleague, John Thorndyke, that the investigator should be constantly on his
  guard against the effect of suggestion. Not only must all prejudices and
  preconceptions be avoided, but when information is received from outside, the
  actual, undeniable facts must be carefully sifted from the inferences which
  usually accompany them. Of the necessity for this precaution our insurance
  practice furnished an excellent instance in the case of the fire at Mr.
  Brattle's oil-shop.</p>

  <p>The case was brought to our notice by Mr. Stalker of the Griffin Fire and
  Life Insurance Society a few days after Christmas. He dropped in, ostensibly
  to wish us a Happy New Year, but a discreet pause in the conversation on
  Thorndyke's part elicited a further purpose.</p>

  <p>"Did you see the account of that fire in Bloomsbury?" Mr. Stalker
  asked.</p>

  <p>"The oil-shop? Yes. But I didn't note any details, excepting that a man
  was apparently burnt to death and that the affair happened on the
  twenty-fifth of December."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," said Mr. Stalker. "It seems uncharitable, but one can't
  help looking a little askance at these quarter-day fires. And the date isn't
  the only doubtful feature in this one; the Divisional Officer of the Fire
  Brigade, who has looked over the ruins, tells me that there are some
  appearances suggesting that the fire broke out in two different
  places&mdash;the shop and the first-floor room over it. Mind you, he doesn't
  say that it actually did. The place is so thoroughly gutted that very little
  is to be learned from it; but that is his impression; and it occurred to me
  that if you were to take a look at the ruins, your radiographic eye might
  detect something that he had overlooked."</p>

  <p>"It isn't very likely," said Thorndyke. "Every man to his trade. The
  Divisional Officer looks at a burnt house with an expert eye, which I do not.
  My evidence would not carry much weight if you were contesting the
  claim."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," replied Mr. Stalker, "and we are not anxious to contest the
  claim unless there is manifest fraud. Arson is a serious matter."</p>

  <p>"It is wilful murder in this case," remarked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Stalker. "And that reminds me that the man who was burnt
  happens to have been insured in our office, too. So we stand a double
  loss."</p>

  <p>"How much?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"The dead man, Percival Bland, had insured his life for three thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke became thoughtful. The last statement had apparently made more
  impression on him than the former ones.</p>

  <p>"If you want me to look into the case for you," said he, "you had better
  let me have all the papers connected with it, including the proposal
  forms."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stalker smiled. "I thought you would say that&mdash;I know you of old,
  you see&mdash;so I slipped the papers in my pocket before coming here."</p>

  <p>He laid the documents on the table and asked: "Is there anything that you
  want to know about the case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "I want to know all that you can tell me."</p>

  <p>"Which is mighty little," said Stalker; "but such as it is, you shall have
  it.</p>

  <p>"The oil-shop man's name is Brattle and the dead man, Bland, was his
  lodger. Bland appears to have been a perfectly steady, sober man in general;
  but it seems that he had announced his intention of spending a jovial
  Christmas Night and giving himself a little extra indulgence. He was last
  seen by Mrs. Brattle at about half-past six, sitting by a blazing fire, with
  a couple of unopened bottles of port on the table and a box of cigars. He had
  a book in his hand and two or three newspapers lay on the floor by his chair.
  Shortly after this, Mr. and Mrs. Brattle went out on a visit to Hornsey,
  leaving him alone in the house."</p>

  <p>"Was there no servant?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"The servant had the day and night off duty to go to her mother's. That,
  by the way, looks a trifle fishy. However, to return to the Brattles; they
  spent the evening at Hornsey and did not get home until past three in the
  morning, by which time their house was a heap of smoking ruins. Mrs.
  Brattle's idea is that Bland must have drunk himself sleepy, and dropped one
  of the newspapers into the fender, where a chance cinder may have started the
  blaze. Which may or may not be the true explanation. Of course, an habitually
  sober man can get pretty mimsey on two bottles of port."</p>

  <p>"What time did the fire break out?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"It was noticed about half-past eleven that flames were issuing from one
  of the chimneys, and the alarm was given at once. The first engine arrived
  ten minutes later, but, by that time, the place was roaring like a furnace.
  Then the water-plugs were found to be frozen hard, which caused some delay;
  in fact, before the engines were able to get to work the roof had fallen in,
  and the place was a mere shell. You know what an oil-shop is, when once it
  gets a fair start."</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Bland's body was found in the ruins, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Body!" exclaimed Mr. Stalker; "there wasn't much body! Just a few charred
  bones, which they dug out of the ashes next day."</p>

  <p>"And the question of identity?"</p>

  <p>"We shall leave that to the coroner. But there really isn't any question.
  To begin with, there was no one else in the house; and then the remains were
  found mixed up with the springs and castors of the chair that Bland was
  sitting in when he was last seen. Moreover, there were found, with the bones,
  a pocket knife, a bunch of keys and a set of steel waistcoat buttons, all
  identified by Mrs. Brattle as belonging to Bland. She noticed the cut steel
  buttons on his waistcoat when she wished him 'good-night.'"</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "was Bland reading by the light of an oil
  lamp?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Stalker. "There was a two-branch gasalier with a porcelain
  shade to one burner, and he had that burner alight when Mrs. Brattle
  left."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflectively picked up the proposal form, and, having glanced
  through it, remarked: "I see that Bland is described as unmarried. Do you
  know why he insured his life for this large amount?"</p>

  <p>"No; we assumed that it was probably in connection with some loan that he
  had raised. I learn from the solicitor who notified us of the death, that the
  whole of Bland's property is left to a cousin&mdash;a Mr. Lindsay, I think.
  So the probability is that this cousin had lent him money. But it is not the
  life claim that is interesting us. We must pay that in any case. It is the
  fire claim that we want you to look into."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke; "I will go round presently and look over the
  ruins, and see if I can detect any substantial evidence of fraud."</p>

  <p>"If you would," said Mr. Stalker, rising to take his departure, "we should
  be very much obliged. Not that we shall probably contest the claim in any
  case."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, my colleague and I glanced through the papers, and I
  ventured to remark: "It seems to me that Stalker doesn't quite appreciate the
  possibilities of this case."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed. "But, of course, it is an insurance company's
  business to pay, and not to boggle at anything short of glaring fraud. And we
  specialists too," he added with a smile, "must beware of seeing too much. I
  suppose that, to a rhinologist, there is hardly such a thing as a healthy
  nose&mdash;unless it is his own&mdash;and the uric acid specialist is very
  apt to find the firmament studded with dumb-bell crystals. We mustn't forget
  that normal cases do exist, after all."</p>

  <p>"That is true," said I; "but, on the other hand, the rhinologist's
  business is with the unhealthy nose, and our concern is with abnormal
  cases."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed. "'A Daniel come to judgement,'" said he. "But my
  learned friend is quite right. Our function is to pick holes. So let us
  pocket the documents and wend Bloomsbury way. We can talk the case over as we
  go."</p>

  <p>We walked at an easy pace, for there was no hurry, and a little
  preliminary thought was useful. After a while, as Thorndyke made no remark, I
  reopened the subject.</p>

  <p>"How does the case present itself to you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Much as it does to you, I expect," he replied. "The circumstances invite
  inquiry, and I do not find myself connecting them with the shopkeeper. It is
  true that the fire occurred on quarter-day; but there is nothing to show that
  the insurance will do more than cover the loss of stock, chattels and the
  profits of trade. The other circumstances are much more suggestive. Here is a
  house burned down and a man killed. That man was insured for three thousand
  pounds, and, consequently, some person stands to gain by his death to that
  amount. The whole set of circumstances is highly favourable to the idea of
  homicide. The man was alone in the house when he died; and the total
  destruction of both the body and its surroundings seems to render
  investigation impossible. The cause of death can only be inferred; it cannot
  be proved; and the most glaring evidence of a crime will have vanished
  utterly. I think that there is a quite strong prima facie suggestion of
  murder. Under the known conditions, the perpetration of a murder would have
  been easy, it would have been safe from detection, and there is an adequate
  motive.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, suicide is not impossible. The man might have set fire
  to the house and then killed himself by poison or otherwise. But it is
  intrinsically less probable that a man should kill him self for another
  person's benefit than that he should kill another man for his own
  benefit.</p>

  <p>"Finally, there is the possibility that the fire and the man's death were
  the result of accident; against which is the official opinion that the fire
  started in two places. If this opinion is correct, it establishes, in my
  opinion, a strong presumption of murder against some person who may have
  obtained access to the house."</p>

  <p>This point in the discussion brought us to the ruined house, which stood
  at the corner of two small streets. One of the firemen in charge admitted us,
  when we had shown our credentials, through a temporary door and down a ladder
  into the basement, where we found a number of men treading gingerly, ankle
  deep in white ash, among a litter of charred wood-work, fused glass, warped
  and broken china, and more or less recognisable metal objects.</p>

  <p>"The coroner and the jury," the fireman explained; "come to view the scene
  of the disaster." He introduced us to the former, who bowed stiffly and
  continued his investigations.</p>

  <p>"These," said the other fireman, "are the springs of the chair that the
  deceased was sitting in. We found the body&mdash;or rather the
  bones&mdash;lying among them under a heap of hot ashes; and we found the
  buttons of his clothes and the things from his pockets among the ashes, too.
  You'll see them in the mortuary with the remains."</p>

  <p>"It must have been a terrific blaze," one of the jurymen remarked. "Just
  look at this, sir," and he handed to Thorndyke what looked like part of a
  gas-fitting, of which the greater part was melted into shapeless lumps and
  the remainder encrusted into fused porcelain.</p>

  <p>"That," said the fireman, "was the gasalier of the first-floor room, where
  Mr. Bland was sitting. Ah! you won't turn that tap, sir; nobody'll ever turn
  that tap again."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke held the twisted mass of brass towards me in silence, and,
  glancing up the blackened walls, remarked: "I think we shall have to come
  here again with the Divisional Officer, but meanwhile, we had better see the
  remains of the body. It is just possible that we may learn something from
  them."</p>

  <p>He applied to the coroner for the necessary authority to make the
  inspection, and, having obtained a rather ungracious and grudging permission
  to examine the remains when the jury had "viewed" them, began to ascend the
  ladder.</p>

  <p>"Our friend would have liked to refuse permission," he remarked when we
  had emerged into the street, "but he knew that I could and should have
  insisted."</p>

  <p>"So I gathered from his manner," said I. "But what is he doing here? This
  isn't his district."</p>

  <p>"No; he is acting for Bettsford, who is laid up just now; and a very poor
  substitute he is. A non-medical coroner is an absurdity in any case, and a
  coroner who is hostile to the medical profession is a public scandal. By the
  way, that gas-tap offers a curious problem. You noticed that it was turned
  off?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And consequently that the deceased was sitting in the dark when the fire
  broke out. I don't see the bearing of the fact, but it is certainly rather
  odd. Here is the mortuary. We had better wait and let the jury go in
  first."</p>

  <p>We had not long to wait. In a couple of minutes or so the "twelve good men
  and true" made their appearance with a small attendant crowd of ragamuffins.
  We let them enter first, and then we followed. The mortuary was a good-sized
  room, well lighted by a glass roof, and having at its centre a long table on
  which lay the shell containing the remains. There was also a sheet of paper
  on which had been laid out a set of blackened steel waistcoat buttons, a
  bunch of keys, a steel-handled pocket-knife, a steel-cased watch on a
  partly-fused rolled-gold chain, and a pocket corkscrew. The coroner drew the
  attention of the jury to these objects, and then took possession of them,
  that they might be identified by witnesses. And meanwhile the jurymen
  gathered round the shell and stared shudderingly at its gruesome
  contents.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, gentlemen," said the coroner, "to have to subject you to this
  painful ordeal. But duty is duty. We must hope, as I think we may, that this
  poor creature met a painless if in some respects a rather terrible
  death."</p>

  <p>At this point, Thorndyke, who had drawn near to the table, cast a long and
  steady glance down into the shell; and immediately his ordinarily rather
  impassive face seemed to congeal; all expression faded from it, leaving it as
  immovable and uncommunicative as the granite face of an Egyptian statue. I
  knew the symptom of old and began to speculate on its present
  significance.</p>

  <p>"Are you taking any medical evidence?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Medical evidence!" the coroner repeated, scornfully. "Certainly not, sir!
  I do not waste the public money by employing so-called experts to tell the
  jury what each of them can see quite plainly for himself. I imagine," he
  added, turning to the foreman, "that you will not require a learned doctor to
  explain to you how that poor fellow mortal met his death?"</p>

  <p>And the foreman, glancing askance at the skull, replied, with a pallid and
  sickly smile, that "he thought not."</p>

  <p>"Do you, sir," the coroner continued, with a dramatic wave of the hand
  towards the plain coffin, "suppose that we shall find any difficulty in
  determining how that man came by his death?"</p>

  <p>"I imagine," replied Thorndyke, without moving a muscle, or, indeed,
  appearing to have any muscles to move, "I imagine you will find no difficulty
  what ever."</p>

  <p>"So do I," said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"Then," retorted Thorndyke, with a faint, inscrutable smile, "we are, for
  once, in complete agreement."</p>

  <p>As the coroner and jury retired, leaving my colleague and me alone in the
  mortuary, Thorndyke remarked: "I suppose this kind of farce will be repeated
  periodically so long as these highly technical medical inquiries continue to
  be conducted by lay persons."</p>

  <p>I made no reply, for I had taken a long look into the shell, and was lost
  in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"But my dear Thorndyke!" I exclaimed; "what on earth does it mean? Are we
  to suppose that a woman can have palmed herself off as a man on the examining
  medical officer of a London Life Assurance Society?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "I think not," said he. "Our friend, Mr. Bland,
  may conceivably have been a woman in disguise, but he certainly was not a
  negress."</p>

  <p>"A negress!" I gasped. "By Jove! So it is! I hadn't looked at the skull.
  But that only makes the mystery more mysterious. Because, you remember, the
  body was certainly dressed in Bland's clothes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, there seems to be no doubt about that. And you may have noticed, as
  I did," Thorndyke continued dryly, "the remarkably fire-proof character of
  the waistcoat buttons, watch-case, knife-handle, and other identifiable
  objects."</p>

  <p>"But what a horrible affair!" I exclaimed. "The brute must have gone out
  and enticed some poor devil of a negress into the house, have murdered her in
  cold blood and then deliberately dressed the corpse in his own clothes! It is
  perfectly frightful!"</p>

  <p>Again Thorndyke shook his head. "It wasn't as bad as that, Jervis," said
  he, "though I must confess that I feel strongly tempted to let your
  hypothesis stand. It would be quite amusing to put Mr. Bland on trial for the
  murder of an unknown negress, and let him explain the facts himself. But our
  reputation is at stake. Look at the bones again and a little more critically.
  You very probably looked for the sex first; then you looked for racial
  characters. Now carry your investigations a step farther."</p>

  <p>"There is the stature," said I. "But that is of no importance, as these
  are not Bland's bones. The only other point that I notice is that the fire
  seems to have acted very unequally on the different parts of the body."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke, "and that is the point. Some parts are more burnt
  than others; and the parts which are burnt most are the wrong parts. Look at
  the back-bone, for instance. The vertebrae are as white as chalk. They are
  mere masses of bone ash. But, of all parts of the skeleton, there is none so
  completely protected from fire as the back-bone, with the great dorsal
  muscles behind, and the whole mass of the viscera in front. Then look at the
  skull. Its appearance is quite inconsistent with the suggested facts. The
  bones of the face are bare and calcined and the orbits contain not a trace of
  the eyes or other structures; and yet there is a charred mass of what may or
  may not be scalp adhering to the crown. But the scalp, as the most exposed
  and the thinnest covering, would be the first to be destroyed, while the last
  to be consumed would be the structures about the jaws and the base, of which,
  you see, not a vestige is left."</p>

  <p>Here he lifted the skull carefully from the shell, and, peering in through
  the great foramen at the base, handed it to me.</p>

  <p>"Look in," he said, "through the Foramen Magnum&mdash;you will see better
  if you hold the orbits towards the skylight&mdash;and notice an even more
  extreme inconsistency with the supposed conditions. The brain and membranes
  have vanished without leaving a trace. The inside of the skull is as clean as
  if it had been macerated. But this is impossible. The brain is not only
  protected from the fire; it is also protected from contact with the air. But
  without access of oxygen, although it might become carbonised, it could not
  be consumed. No, Jervis; it won't do."</p>

  <p>I replaced the skull in the coffin and looked at him in surprise. "What is
  it that you are suggesting?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I suggest that this was not a body at all, but merely a dry
  skeleton."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "what about those masses of what looks like charred
  muscle adhering to the bones?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "I have been noticing them. They do, as you say, look
  like masses of charred muscle. But they are quite shapeless and
  structureless; I cannot identify a single muscle or muscular group; and there
  is not a vestige of any of the tendons. Moreover, the distribution is false.
  For instance, will you tell me what muscle you think that is?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to a thick, charred mass on the inner surface of the left tibia
  or shin-bone. "Now this portion of the bone&mdash;as many a hockey-player has
  had reason to realise&mdash;has no muscular covering at all. It lies
  immediately under the skin."</p>

  <p>"I think you are right, Thorndyke," said I. "That lump of muscle in the
  wrong place gives the whole fraud away. But it was really a rather smart
  dodge. This fellow Bland must be an ingenious rascal."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke; "but an unscrupulous villain too. He might have
  burned down half the street and killed a score of people. He'll have to pay
  the piper for this little frolic."</p>

  <p>"What shall you do now? Are you going to notify the coroner?"</p>

  <p>"No; that is not my business. I think we will verify our conclusions and
  then inform our clients and the police. We must measure the skull as well as
  we can without callipers, but it is, fortunately, quite typical. The short,
  broad, flat nasal bones, with the 'Simian groove,' and those large, strong
  teeth, worn flat by hard and gritty food, are highly characteristic." He once
  more lifted out the skull, and, with a spring tape, made a few measurements,
  while I noted the lengths of the principal long bones and the width across
  the hips.</p>

  <p>"I make the cranial-nasal index 55," said he, as he replaced the skull,
  "and the cranial index about 72, which are quite representative numbers; and,
  as I see that your notes show the usual disproportionate length of arm and
  the characteristic curve of the tibia, we may be satisfied. But it is
  fortunate that the specimen is so typical. To the experienced eye, racial
  types have a physiognomy which is unmistakable on mere inspection. But you
  cannot transfer the experienced eye. You can only express personal conviction
  and back it up with measurements.</p>

  <p>"And now we will go and look in on Stalker, and inform him that his office
  has saved three thousand pounds by employing us. After which it will be
  Westward Ho! for Scotland Yard, to prepare an unpleasant little surprise for
  Mr. Percival Bland."</p>

  <p>There was joy among the journalists on the following day. Each of the
  morning papers devoted an entire column to an unusually detailed account of
  the inquest on the late Percival Bland&mdash;who, it appeared, met his death
  by misadventure&mdash;and a verbatim report of the coroner's eloquent remarks
  on the danger of solitary, fireside tippling, and the stupefying effects of
  port wine. An adjacent column contained an equally detailed account of the
  appearance of the deceased at Bow Street Police Court to answer complicated
  charges of arson, fraud and forgery; while a third collated the two accounts
  with gleeful commentaries.</p>

  <p>Mr. Percival Bland, alias Robert Lindsay, now resides on the breezy
  uplands of Dartmoor, where, in his abundant leisure, he, no doubt, regrets
  his misdirected ingenuity. But he has not laboured in vain. To the Lord
  Chancellor he has furnished an admirable illustration of the danger of
  appointing lay coroners; and to me an unforgettable warning against the
  effects of suggestion.</p>
