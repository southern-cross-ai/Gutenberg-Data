  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01"></a>1. &mdash; FOUR SUICIDES</h2>

  <p class="first">I unpacked my bags at the Explorers' Club gloomily enough.
  The singularly unpleasant depression with which I had awakened in my berth
  the night before had refused to be shaken off. It was like the echo of some
  nightmare whose details I had forgotten but which still lurked just over the
  threshold of consciousness.</p>

  <p>Joined to it was another irritation.</p>

  <p>Of course I had not expected any Mayor's Committee to welcome me home. But
  that neither Bennett nor Ralston had met me began to assume the aspect of a
  major tragedy of neglect. I had written to both before sailing, and I had
  looked for one of them, at least, to be on the dock to meet me.</p>

  <p>They were the closest friends I had, and the queer current of hostility
  between them had often amused me. They thoroughly liked, yet as thoroughly
  disapproved of, each other. I had the idea that away down under they were
  closer each to the other than to me; that they might have been Damon and
  Pythias if each hadn't so disliked the other's attitude toward life; and
  maybe were Damon and Pythias despite it.</p>

  <p>Old Aesop formulated their discordance centuries ago in his fable of the
  Ant and the Cricket. Bill Bennett was the Ant. The serious-minded,
  hard-working son of Dr. Lionel Bennett, until recently one of the modern,
  civilized world's five outstanding experts upon brain pathology. I make the
  distinction of modern and civilized because I have had proof that what we are
  pleased to call the uncivilized world has many more such experts, and I have
  good reason to believe that the ancient world had others much further
  advanced than those of the modern world, civilized or uncivilized.</p>

  <p>Bennett, the elder, had been one of the few specialists whose mind turned
  upon his work rather than his bank account. Distinguished but poor. Bennett,
  the younger, was about thirty-five, my own age. I knew that his father had
  rested heavily upon him. I suspected that along some lines, and especially in
  the realm of the subconscious, the son had outstripped the sire; his mind
  more flexible, more open. Bill had written me a year ago that his father had
  died, and that he had associated himself with Dr. Austin Lowell, taking the
  place of Dr. David Braile who had been killed by a falling chandelier in Dr.
  Lowell's private hospital. (See <i>Burn, Witch, Burn</i>.)</p>

  <p>Dick Ralston was the Cricket. He was heir to a fortune so solid that even
  the teeth of the depression could only scratch it. Very much the traditional
  rich man's son of the better sort, but seeing no honor, use, nor any joy or
  other virtue in labor. Happy-go-lucky, clever, generous&mdash;but decidedly a
  first-class idler.</p>

  <p>I was the compromise&mdash;the bridge on which they could meet. I had my
  medical degree, but also I had enough money to save me from the grind of
  practice. Enough to allow me to do as I pleased&mdash;which was drifting
  around the world on ethnological research. Especially in those fields which
  my medical and allied scientific brethren call superstition&mdash;native
  sorceries, witchcraft, voodoo, and the like. In that research I was as
  earnest as Bill in his. And he knew it.</p>

  <p>Dick, on the other hand, attributed my wanderings to an itching foot
  inherited from one of my old Breton forebears, a pirate who had sailed out of
  St. Malo and carved himself a gory reputation in the New World. And
  ultimately was hanged for it. The peculiar bent of my mind he likewise
  attributed to the fact that two of my ancestors had been burned as witches in
  Brittany.</p>

  <p>I was perfectly understandable to him.</p>

  <p>Bill's industry was not so understandable.</p>

  <p>I reflected, morosely, that even if I had been away for three years it was
  too short a time to be forgotten. And then I managed to shake off my gloom
  and to laugh at myself. After all, they might not have gotten my letters; or
  they might have had engagements they couldn't break; and each might have
  thought the other would be on hand.</p>

  <p>There was an afternoon newspaper on the bed. I noticed that it was of the
  day before. My eye fell upon some headlines. I stopped laughing. The
  headlines ran:</p>

  <p class="headline">$5,000,000 COPPER HEIR KILLS HIMSELF<br>
  RICHARD J. RALSTON, JR.<br>
  PUTS BULLET THROUGH HEAD</p>

  <p class="newspaper">No Reason Known for Act&mdash;Fourth New York Man of
  Wealth to Take His Life Without Apparent Cause in Last Three Months&mdash;
  Police Hint Suicide Club.</p>

  <p>I read the story:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Richard J. Ralston, Jr., who inherited some $5,000,000
  when his father, a rich mine owner, died two years ago, was found dead in his
  bed this morning in a bedroom of his house on 78th Street. He had shot
  himself through the head, dying instantly. The pistol with which he had
  killed himself was lying on the floor where it had fallen from his hand. The
  Detective Bureau identified the finger marks on it as his own.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Discovery was made by his butler, John Simpson, who
  said that he had gone into the room about 8 o'clock, following his usual
  custom. From the condition of the body Dr. Peabody, of the coroner's office,
  estimated that Ralston must have shot himself about three o'clock, or
  approximately five hours before Simpson found him."</p>

  <p>Three o'clock? I felt a little prickling along my spine. Allowing for the
  difference between ship time and New York time, that was precisely when I had
  awakened with that strange depression. I read on:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"If Simpson's story is true, and the police see no
  reason to doubt it, the suicide could not have been premeditated and must
  have been the result of some sudden overmastering impulse. This seems to be
  further indicated by the discovery of a letter Ralston had started to write,
  and torn up without finishing. The scraps of it were found under a desk in
  the bedroom where he had tossed them. The letter read:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Bill,<br>
  "Sorry I couldn't stay any longer. I wish you would think of the matter as
  objective and not subjective, no matter how incredible such a thing may seem.
  If Alan were only here. He knows more&mdash;</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"At this point Ralston had evidently changed his mind
  and torn up the letter. The police would like to know who 'Alan' is and have
  him explain what it is that he 'knows more' about. They also hope that the
  'Bill' to whom it was to have been sent will identify himself. There is not
  the slightest doubt as to the case being one of suicide, but it is possible
  that whatever it was that was 'objective and not subjective, no matter how
  incredible' may throw some light on the motive.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"At present absolutely no reason appears to exist to
  explain why Mr. Ralston should have taken his life. His attorneys, the well-
  known firm of Winston, Smith &amp; White, have assured the police that his
  estate is in perfect order, and that there were no 'complications' in their
  client's life. It is a fact that unlike so many sons of rich men, no scandal
  has ever been attached to Ralston's name.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"This is the fourth suicide within three months of men
  of wealth of approximately Ralston's age, and of comparatively the same
  habits of life. Indeed, in each of the four cases the circumstances are so
  similar that the police are seriously contemplating the possibility of a
  suicide pact.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The first of the four deaths occurred on July 15, when
  John Marston, internationally known polo player, shot himself through the
  head in his bedroom in his country house at Locust Valley, Long Island. No
  cause for his suicide has ever come to light. Like Ralston, he was unmarried.
  On August 6, the body of Walter St. Clair Calhoun was found in his roadster
  near Riverhead, Long Island. Calhoun had driven his car off the main road,
  here heavily shaded by trees, into the middle of an open field. There he had
  put a bullet through his brains. No one ever discovered why. He had been
  divorced for three years. On August 21, Richard Stanton, millionaire
  yachtsman and globe-trotter, shot himself through the head while on the deck
  of his ocean-going yacht Trinculo. This happened the night before he was
  about to set out on a cruise to South America."</p>

  <p>I read on and on... the speculations as to the suicide pact, supposedly
  entered into because of boredom and morbid thrill-hunger... the histories of
  Marston, Calhoun, and Stanton... Dick's obituary...</p>

  <p>I read, only half understanding what it was I read. I kept thinking that
  it couldn't be true.</p>

  <p>There was no reason why Dick should kill himself. In all the world there
  was no man less likely to kill himself. The theory of the suicide pact was
  absurdly fantastic, at least so far as he was concerned. I was the 'Alan' of
  the letter, of course. And Bennett was the 'Bill.' But what was it I knew
  that had made Dick wish for me?</p>

  <p>The telephone buzzed, and the operator said: "Dr. Bennett to see you."</p>

  <p>I said: "Send him up." And to myself: "Thank God!"</p>

  <p>Bill came in. He was white and drawn, and more like a man still in the
  midst of a stiff ordeal than one who has passed through it. His eyes held a
  puzzled horror, as though he were looking less at me than within his mind at
  whatever was the source of that horror. He held a hand out, absently, and all
  he said was: "I'm glad you're back, Alan."</p>

  <p>I had the newspaper in my other hand. He took it and looked at the date.
  He said: "Yesterday's. Well, it's all there. All that the police know,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>He had said that rather oddly; I asked: "Do you mean you know something
  that the police don't?"</p>

  <p>He answered, evasively I thought: "Oh, they've got their facts all
  straight. Dick put the bullet through his brain. They're right in linking up
  those other three deaths&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I repeated: "What do you know that the police don't know, Bill?"</p>

  <p>He said: "That Dick was murdered!"</p>

  <p>I looked at him, bewildered. "But if he put the bullet through his own
  brain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He said: "I don't blame you for being puzzled. Nevertheless&mdash;I know
  Dick Ralston killed himself, and yet I know just as certainly that he was
  murdered."</p>

  <p>He sat down upon the bed; he said: "I need a drink."</p>

  <p>I brought out the bottle of Scotch the club steward had thoughtfully
  placed in my room for homecoming welcome. He poured himself a stiff one. He
  repeated:</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you're back! We've got a tough job ahead of us, Alan."</p>

  <p>I poured myself a drink; I asked: "What is it? To find Dick's
  murderer?"</p>

  <p>He answered: "That, yes. But more than that. To stop more murders."</p>

  <p>I poured him and myself another drink; I said: "Quit beating about the
  bush and tell me what it's all about."</p>

  <p>He looked at me, thoughtfully; he answered, quietly: "No, Alan. Not yet."
  He put down his glass. "Suppose you had discovered a new bug, an unknown germ
  &mdash;or thought you had. And had studied it and noted its peculiarities.
  And suppose you wanted someone to check up. What would you do&mdash;give him
  all your supposed observations first, and then ask him to look into the
  microscope to verify them? Or simply give him an outline and ask him to look
  into the microscope and find out for himself?"</p>

  <p>"Outline and find out for himself, of course."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. Well, I think I have such a new bug&mdash;or a very old one,
  although it has nothing whatever to do with germs. But I'm not going to tell
  you any more about it until I put your eye to the microscope. I want your
  opinion uncolored by mine. Send out for a paper, will you?"</p>

  <p>I called the office and told them to get me one of the latest editions.
  When it came, Bill took it. He glanced over the first page, then turned the
  sheets until he came to what he was looking for. He read it, and nodded, and
  passed the paper to me.</p>

  <p>"Dick's reduced from page one to page five," he said. "But I've gotten it
  over. Read the first few paragraphs&mdash;all the rest is rehash and idle
  conjecture. Very idle."</p>

  <p>I read:</p>

  <p>"Dr. William Bennett, the eminent brain specialist and associate of Dr.
  Austin Lowell, the distinguished psychiatrist, visited Police Headquarters
  this morning and identified himself as the 'Bill' of the unfinished letter
  found in the bedroom of Richard J. Ralston, Jr., after the latter's suicide
  yesterday morning.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Bennett said that undoubtedly the letter had been meant for him, that
  Mr. Ralston had been one of his oldest friends and had recently consulted him
  for what he might describe roughly as insomnia and bad dreams. Mr. Ralston
  had, in fact, been his guest at dinner the night before. He had wanted Mr.
  Ralston to spend the night with him, but after consenting, he had changed his
  mind and gone home to sleep. That was what he had referred to in the opening
  sentence of his letter. Professional confidence prevented Dr. Bennett from
  going into further description of Mr. Ralston's symptoms. Asked whether the
  mental condition of Mr. Ralston might explain why he had killed himself, Dr.
  Bennett guardedly replied that suicide was always the result of some mental
  condition."</p>

  <p>In spite of my perplexity and sorrow, I couldn't help smiling at that.</p>

  <p>"The 'Alan' referred to in the letter, Dr. Bennett said, is Dr. Alan
  Caranac, who was also an old friend of Mr. Ralston, and who is due in New
  York today on the Augustus after three years in Northern Africa. Dr. Caranac
  is well-known in scientific circles for his ethnological researches. Dr.
  Bennett said that Mr. Ralston had thought that some of his symptoms might be
  explained by Dr. Caranac because of the latter's study of certain obscure
  mental aberrations among primitive peoples."</p>

  <p>"Now for the kicker," said Bill, and pointed to the next paragraph:</p>

  <p>"Dr. Bennett talked freely with the reporters after his statement to the
  police, but could add no essential facts beyond those he had given them. He
  did say that Mr. Ralston had withdrawn large sums in cash from his accounts
  during the two weeks before his death, and that there was no evidence of what
  had become of them. He seemed immediately to regret that he had given this
  information, saying that the circumstance could have no bearing upon Mr.
  Ralston's suicide. He reluctantly admitted, however, that the sum might be
  well over $100,000, and that the police were investigating."</p>

  <p>I said: "That looks like blackmail&mdash;if it's true."</p>

  <p>He said: "I haven't the slightest proof that it is true. But it's what I
  told the police and the reporters."</p>

  <p>He read the paragraph over again and arose.</p>

  <p>"The reporters will soon be here, Alan," he said. "And the police. I'm
  going. You haven't seen me. You haven't the slightest idea of what it's all
  about. You haven't heard from Ralston for a year. Tell them that when you get
  in touch with me, you may have something more to say. But now&mdash;you don't
  know anything. And that's true&mdash;you don't. That's your story, and you
  stick to it."</p>

  <p>He walked to the door. I said:</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Bill. What's the idea behind that bunch of words I've just
  read?"</p>

  <p>He said: "It's a nicely baited hook."</p>

  <p>I said: "What do you expect to hook?"</p>

  <p>He said: "Dick's murderer."</p>

  <p>He turned at the door: "And something else that's right down your alley. A
  witch."</p>

  <p>He shut the door behind him.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02"></a>2. &mdash; THE DEMOISELLE DAHUT</h2>

  <p class="first">Not long after Bill had gone, a man from the Detective
  Bureau visited me. It was evident that he regarded the call as waste motion;
  just a part of the routine. His questions were perfunctory, nor did he ask me
  if I had seen Bennett. I produced the Scotch and he mellowed. He said:</p>

  <p>"Hell, if it ain't one thing it's another. If you ain't got money you wear
  yourself out tryin' to get it. If you got it, then somebody's tryin' all the
  time to rob you. Or else you go nuts like this poor guy and then what good is
  your money? This Ralston wasn't a bad guy at that, I hear."</p>

  <p>I agreed. He took another drink and left.</p>

  <p>Three reporters came; one from the City News and the others from afternoon
  papers. They asked few questions about Dick, but showed flattering interest
  in my travels. I was so relieved that I sent for a second bottle of Scotch
  and told them a few stories about the mirror-magic of the Riff women, who
  believe that at certain times and under certain conditions they can catch the
  reflections of those they love or hate in their mirrors, and so have power
  thereafter over their souls.</p>

  <p>The City News man said that if he could get the Riff women to teach him
  that trick, he could lift all the mirror-makers in America out of the
  depression and get rich doing it. The other two morosely agreed that they
  knew some editors whose reflections they'd like to catch. I laughed and said
  it would be easier to bring over a good old-fashioned Bulgarian mason or two.
  Then all they need do was to get the mason a job, decoy the editor to the
  place and have the mason measure his shadow with a string. After that, the
  mason would put the string in a box and build the box in the wall. In forty
  days the editor would be dead and his soul be sitting in the box beside the
  string.</p>

  <p>One of the afternoon men glumly said that forty days would be too long to
  wait for the ones he had in mind. But the other asked, with disarming
  naiveté, whether I believed such a thing possible. I answered that if a man
  were strongly enough convinced he would die on a certain day, he would die on
  that day. Not because his shadow had been measured and the string buried, but
  because he believed that this was going to kill him. It was purely a matter
  of suggestion&mdash;of auto-hypnosis. Like the praying to death practiced by
  the kahunas, the warlocks of the South Seas, of the results of which there
  was no doubt whatever. Always providing, of course, that the victim knew the
  kahuna was praying his death&mdash;and the exact time his death was to
  occur.</p>

  <p>I ought to have known better. The morning papers carried only a few lines
  to the effect that I had talked to the police and had been unable to throw
  any light on the Ralston suicide. But the early editions of the naive
  reporter's paper featured a special article.</p>

  <p class="headline">WANT TO GET RID OF YOUR ENEMIES?<br>
  GET A RIFF GAL'S MAGIC MIRROR&mdash;OR BRING IN A BULGARIAN MASON.</p>

  <p class="headline">Dr. Alan Caranac, noted explorer, tells how to separate
  yourself safely from those you don't want around, but the catch is that first
  you have to make 'em believe you can do it.</p>

  <p>It was a good story, even if it did make me swear in spots. I read it over
  again and laughed. After all, I'd brought it on myself. The 'phone rang, and
  Bill was on the line. He asked abruptly:</p>

  <p>"What put it in your head to talk to that reporter about shadows?"</p>

  <p>He sounded jumpy. I said, surprised:</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Why shouldn't I have talked to him about shadows?"</p>

  <p>He didn't answer for a moment. Then he asked:</p>

  <p>"Nothing happened to direct your mind to that subject? Nobody suggested
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You're getting curiouser and curiouser, as Alice puts it. But no, Bill, I
  brought the matter up all by myself. And no shadow fell upon me whispering in
  my ear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted, harshly: "Don't talk like that!"</p>

  <p>And now I was truly surprised, for there was panic in Bill's voice, and
  that wasn't like him at all.</p>

  <p>"There really wasn't any reason. It just happened," I repeated. "What's it
  all about, Bill?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind now." I wondered even more at the relief in his voice. He
  swiftly changed the subject: "Dick's funeral is tomorrow. I'll see you
  there."</p>

  <p>Now the one thing I won't be coerced or persuaded into doing is to go to
  the funeral of a friend. Unless there are interesting and unfamiliar rites
  connected with it, it's senseless. There lies a piece of cold meat for the
  worms, grotesquely embellished by the undertaker's cosmetic arts. Sunken eyes
  that never more will dwell upon the beauty of the clouds, the sea, the
  forest. Ears shut forever, and all the memories of life rotting away within
  the decaying brain. Painted and powdered symbol of life's futility. I want to
  remember friends as they were alive, alert, capable, eager. The coffin
  picture superimposes itself, and I lose my friends. The animals order things
  much better, to my way of thinking. They hide themselves and die. Bill knew
  how I felt, so I said:</p>

  <p>"You'll not see me there." To shut off any discussion, I asked:</p>

  <p>"Had any nibble at your witch bait?"</p>

  <p>"Yes and no. Not the real strike I'm hoping for, but attention from
  unexpected quarters. Dick's lawyers called me up after I'd left you and asked
  what he had told me about those cash withdrawals. They said they'd been
  trying to find out what he had done with the money, but couldn't. They
  wouldn't believe me, of course, when I said I knew absolutely nothing; that I
  had only vague suspicions and had tried a shot in the dark. I don't blame
  them. Stanton's executor called me up this morning to ask the same thing.
  Said Stanton had drawn substantial amounts of cash just before he died, and
  they hadn't been able to trace it."</p>

  <p>I whistled:</p>

  <p>"That's queer. How about Calhoun and Marston? If they did the same, it'll
  begin to smell damned fishy."</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to find out," he said. "Good-by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Bill," I said. "I'm a good waiter, and all of that. But
  I'm getting mighty curious. When do I see you, and what do you want me to do
  in the meantime?"</p>

  <p>When he answered his voice was as grave as I'd ever heard it.</p>

  <p>"Alan, sit tight until I can lay the cards before you. I don't want to say
  more now, but trust me, there's a good reason. I'll tell you one thing,
  though. That interview of yours is another hook&mdash;and I'm not sure it
  isn't baited even better than mine."</p>

  <p>That was on Tuesday. Obviously, I was puzzled and curious to a degree. So
  much so that if it had been anybody but Bill who had sat me down in my little
  corner chair and told me to be quiet, I would have been exceedingly angry.
  But Bill knew what he was about&mdash;I was sure of that. So I stayed
  put.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday, Dick was buried. I went over my notes and started the first
  chapter of my book on Moroccan sorceries. Thursday night, Bill called up.</p>

  <p>"There's a small dinner party at Dr. Lowell's tomorrow night," he said. "A
  Dr. de Keradel and his daughter. I want you to come. I'll promise you'll be
  interested."</p>

  <p>De Keradel? The name had a familiar sound. "Who is he?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Rene de Keradel, the French psychiatrist. You must have read some of
  his&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course," I interrupted. "He took up some of Charcot's hypnotic
  experiments at the Sâlpetrière, didn't he? Carried them on from the point
  where Charcot had stopped. Left the Sâlpetrière under a cloud some years ago.
  Subjects died, or he was too unorthodox in his conclusions, or
  something?"</p>

  <p>"That's the chap."</p>

  <p>I said: "I'll be there. I'd like to meet him."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Bill. "Dinner's at 7:30. Wear your dinner jacket. And come an
  hour ahead of time. There's a girl who wants to talk to you before the
  company comes, as we used to say."</p>

  <p>"A girl?" I asked, astonished.</p>

  <p>"Helen," said Bill with a chuckle. "And don't you disappoint her. You're
  her hero." He hung up.</p>

  <p>Helen was Bill's sister. About ten years younger than I. I hadn't seen her
  for fifteen years. An impish sort of kid, I recalled. Eyes sort of slanting
  and yellow brown. Hair a red torch. Gawky when I saw her last and inclined to
  be fat. Used to follow me around when I was visiting Bill during college
  vacations, and sit and stare at me without speaking until it made me so
  nervous I stuttered. Never could tell whether it was silent adoration or
  sheer deviltry. That was when she was about twelve. Nor could I forget how
  she had led me, apparently innocently, to sit on a subterranean nest of
  hornets; nor the time when, going to bed, I had found it shared by a family
  of garter snakes. The first might have been an accident, although I had my
  doubts, but the second wasn't. I had dumped the snakes out the window and
  never by word, look, or gesture referred to it, having my reward in the
  child's bafflement at my reticence and her avid but necessarily mute
  curiosity. I knew she had gone through Smith and had been studying art in
  Florence. I wondered what she had grown to be.</p>

  <p>I read over some of de Keradel's papers at the Academy of Medicine Library
  next day. He was a queer bird without doubt, with some extraordinarily
  arresting theories. I didn't wonder that the Sâlpetrière had eased him out.
  Stripped of their scientific verbiage, the framework of his main idea was
  startlingly like that expounded to me by the Many-Times-Born Abbot of the
  Lamasery at Gyang-tse, in Tibet. A holy man and an accomplished
  wonder-worker, a seeker of knowledge along strange paths, what would be
  loosely called by the superstitious&mdash;a sorcerer. Also by a Greek priest
  near Delphi whose Christian cloak covered a pure case of pagan atavism. He
  offered to demonstrate his hypothesis, and did. He nearly convinced me.
  Indeed, visualizing again what he had made me see, I was not sure that he
  hadn't convinced me.</p>

  <p>I began to feel a strong interest in this Dr. de Keradel. The name was
  Breton, like my own, and as unusual. Another recollection flitted through my
  mind. There was a reference to the de Keradels in the chronicles of the de
  Carnacs, as we were once named. I looked it up. There had been no love lost
  between the two families, to put it mildly. Altogether, what I read blew my
  desire to meet Dr. de Keradel up to fever point.</p>

  <p>I was half an hour late getting to Dr. Lowell's. The butler showed me into
  the library. A girl got up from a big chair and came toward me with hand
  outstretched.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Alan," she said.</p>

  <p>I blinked at her. She wasn't so tall, but her body had all the lovely
  contours the sculptors of Athens' Golden Age gave their dancing girls. The
  provocative dress of filmy black she wore hid none of them. Her hair was
  burnished copper and helmeted her small head. The heavy chignon at the nape
  of her neck showed she had resisted the bob. Her eyes were golden amber, and
  tilted delicately. Her nose was small and straight and her chin rounded. Her
  skin was not the creamy white that so often goes with redheads, but a
  delicate golden. It was a head and face that might have served as the model
  for one of Alexander's finest golden coins. Faintly archaic, touched with the
  antique beauty. I blinked again. I blurted:</p>

  <p>"You're never&mdash;Helen!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes sparkled, the impishness that my experience with the hornets had
  set indelibly in my memory danced over her face. She took my hands, and
  swayed close to me; she sighed:</p>

  <p>"The same, Alan! The same! And you&mdash;oh, let me look at you! Yes,
  still the hero of my girlhood! The same keen, dark face&mdash;like&mdash;
  like&mdash;I used to call you Lancelot of the Lake, Alan&mdash;to myself of
  course. The same lithe, tall, and slender body&mdash;I used to call you the
  Black Panther, too, Alan. And do you remember how like a panther you leaped
  when the hornets stung you?" She bent her head, her rounded shoulders
  shaking. I said: "You little devil! I always knew you did that
  deliberately."</p>

  <p>She said, muffled:</p>

  <p>"I'm not laughing, Alan. I'm sobbing."</p>

  <p>She looked up at me, and her eyes were indeed wet, but I was sure not with
  any tears of regret. She said:</p>

  <p>"Alan, for long, long years I've waited to know something. Waited to hear
  you tell me something. Not to tell me that you love me, darling&mdash;No, No!
  I always knew that you were going to do that, sooner or later. This is
  something else!"</p>

  <p>I was laughing, but I had a queer mixed feeling, too.</p>

  <p>I said:</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you anything. Even that I love you&mdash;and maybe mean
  it."</p>

  <p>She said:</p>

  <p>"Did you find those snakes in your bed? Or did they crawl out before you
  got in?"</p>

  <p>I said again: "You little devil!"</p>

  <p>She said:</p>

  <p>"But were they there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they were."</p>

  <p>She sighed contentedly:</p>

  <p>"Well, there's one complex gone forever. Now I know. You were so damned
  superior at times I just couldn't help it."</p>

  <p>She held her face up to me:</p>

  <p>"Since you're going to love me, Alan, you might as well kiss me."</p>

  <p>I kissed her, properly. She might have been fooling with me about having
  been her girlhood hero, but there was no fooling about my kiss&mdash;nor the
  way she responded to it. She shivered and laid her head on my shoulder. She
  said, dreamily: "And there's another complex gone. Where am I going to
  stop?"</p>

  <p>Somebody coughed at the doorway. Somebody else murmured, apologetically:
  "Ah, but we intrude."</p>

  <p>Helen dropped her arms from around my neck, and we turned. In a way, I
  realized that the butler and another man were standing at the door. But all I
  could focus my eyes upon was the girl&mdash;or woman.</p>

  <p>You know how it is when you're riding in the subway, or at the theater, or
  at a race track and suddenly one face, for some reason or no reason, thrusts
  itself out from the crowd, and it's as though your mental spotlight were
  turned on it and every other face gets misty and recedes into the background.
  That often happens to me. Something in the face that stirs some old forgotten
  memory, no doubt. Or stirs the memory of our ancestors whose ghosts are
  always peering through our eyes. Seeing this girl was like that, only far
  more so. I couldn't see anything else&mdash;not even Helen.</p>

  <p>She had the bluest eyes I've ever seen, or rather eyes of a curious deep
  violet. They were big and unusually wide apart, with long curling black
  lashes and slimly penciled black eyebrows that almost met above her
  high-arched but delicately modeled nose. You felt, rather than saw, their
  color. Her forehead was broad, but whether it was low I could not tell, for
  it was coifed with braids of palest gold, and there were little ends of hair
  that curled up all over her head, and they were so fine and silken that the
  light in the hall shining through them made a queer silver-gilt aureole
  around her head. Her mouth was a bit large, but beautifully formed and
  daintily sensuous. Her skin was a miracle, white, but vital&mdash;as though
  moon fires shone behind it.</p>

  <p>She was tall almost as I, exquisitely curved, deep bosomed. Her breasts
  echoed the betrayal of her lips. Her head and face and shoulders came like a
  lily out of the calyx of a shimmering sea-green gown.</p>

  <p>She was exquisite&mdash;but I had swift understanding that there was
  nothing heavenly about the blue of her eyes. And nothing saintly about the
  aureole about her head.</p>

  <p>She was perfection&mdash;and I felt a swift hatred against her,
  understanding, as the pulse of it passed, how one could slash a painting that
  was a masterpiece of beauty, or take a hammer and destroy a statue that was
  another such masterpiece if it evoked such hatred as that which I, for that
  fleeting moment, felt.</p>

  <p>Then I thought:</p>

  <p>Do I hate you&mdash;or do I fear you?</p>

  <p>It was all, mind you, in a breath.</p>

  <p>Helen was moving by me, hand outstretched. There was no confusion about
  Helen. Our embrace that had been interrupted might have been a simple
  handshake. She said, smiling and gracious:</p>

  <p>"I am Helen Bennett. Dr. Lowell asked me to receive you. You are Dr. de
  Keradel, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>I looked at the man who was bending over her hand, kissing it. He
  straightened, and I felt a queer shock of bewilderment. Bill had said I was
  to meet Dr. de Keradel and his daughter. But this man looked no I older than
  the girl&mdash;if she was his daughter. True, the silver in the gold of his
  hair was a little paler; true, the blue of his eyes had not the violet-purple
  of hers...</p>

  <p>I thought: But neither of them has any age! And on top of that I thought,
  rather savagely: What the hell's the matter with me anyway?</p>

  <p>The man said:</p>

  <p>"I am Dr. de Keradel. And this is my daughter."</p>

  <p>The girl&mdash;or woman&mdash;seemed now to be regarding both Helen and me
  with faint amusement. Dr. de Keradel said with, I thought, curious
  precision:</p>

  <p>"The Demoiselle Dahut d'Ys," he hesitated, then finished&mdash;"de
  Keradel."</p>

  <p>Helen said:</p>

  <p>"And this is Dr. Alan Caranac."</p>

  <p>I was looking at the girl&mdash;or woman. The name of Dahut d'Ys fingered
  half-forgotten chords of memory. And as Helen named me, I saw the violet eyes
  dilate, become enormous, the straight brows contract until they met above the
  nose in a slender bar. I felt the glance of her eyes strike and encompass me.
  She seemed to be seeing me for the first time. And in her eyes was something
  threatening&mdash;possessive. Her body tensed. She said, as though to
  herself: "Alain de Carnac... ?"</p>

  <p>She glanced from me to Helen. There was calculation in that glance,
  appraisal. Contemptuous indifference, too&mdash;if I read it aright. A queen
  might so have looked upon some serving wench who had dared to lift eyes to
  her lover.</p>

  <p>Whether I read the glance aright or not, Helen evidently got something of
  the same thought. She turned to me and said sweetly:</p>

  <p>"Darling, I'm ashamed of you. Wake up!"</p>

  <p>With the side of her little high-heeled slipper she gave me a
  surreptitious and vigorous kick on the shin.</p>

  <p>Just then Bill came in, and with him a dignified, white-haired gentleman I
  knew must be Dr. Lowell.</p>

  <p>I don't know when I had ever been so glad to see Bill.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03"></a>3. &mdash; THEORIES OF DR. DE KERADEL</h2>

  <p class="first">I gave Bill the old fraternity high-sign of distress, and
  after introductions he bore me away, leaving the Demoiselle Dahut to Helen
  and Dr. de Keradel with Dr. Lowell. I felt an urgent need for a drink, and
  said so. Bill passed me the brandy and soda without comment. I drank a stiff
  brandy neat.</p>

  <p>Helen had bowled me off my feet, but that had been a pleasant upset,
  nothing that called for any alcoholic lever to right me. The Demoiselle Dahut
  had been an entirely different matter. She was damned disconcerting. It
  occurred to me that if you compared yourself to a ship bowling along under
  full sail, with your mind as a capable navigator and through charted seas,
  Helen was a squall that fitted normally into the picture&mdash;but the
  Demoiselle was a blow from a new quarter entirely, heading the ship into
  totally strange waters. What you knew of navigation wouldn't help you a
  bit.</p>

  <p>I said:</p>

  <p>"Helen could blow you into Port o' Paradise but the other could blow you
  into Port o' Hell."</p>

  <p>Bill didn't say anything, only watched me. I poured a second brandy. Bill
  said, mildly:</p>

  <p>"There'll be cocktails and wine at dinner."</p>

  <p>I said: "Fine," and drank the brandy.</p>

  <p>I thought:</p>

  <p>It's not her infernal beauty that's got me going. But why the hell did I
  hate her so when I first saw her?</p>

  <p>I didn't hate her now. All I felt was a burning curiosity. But why did I
  have that vague sense of having long known her? And that not so vague idea
  that she knew me better than I did her? I muttered:</p>

  <p>"She makes you think of the sea, at that."</p>

  <p>Bill said: "Who?"</p>

  <p>I said: "The Demoiselle d'Ys."</p>

  <p>He stepped back; he said, as though something was strangling him:</p>

  <p>"Who's the Demoiselle d'Ys?"</p>

  <p>I looked at him, suspiciously; I said: "Don't you know the names of your
  guests? That girl down there&mdash;the Demoiselle Dahut d'Ys de Keradel."</p>

  <p>Bill said, rather dumbly:</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't know that. All Lowell introduced her by was the de Keradel
  part of it."</p>

  <p>After a minute, he said: "Probably another drink won't hurt you. I'll join
  you."</p>

  <p>We drank; he said, casually:</p>

  <p>"Never met them till tonight. De Keradel called on Lowell yesterday
  morning&mdash;as one eminent psychiatrist upon another. Lowell was
  interested, and invited him and his daughter to dinner. The old boy is fond
  of Helen, and ever since she came back to town she's been hostess at his
  parties. She's very fond of him, too."</p>

  <p>He drank his brandy and set down the glass. He said, still casually:</p>

  <p>"I understand de Keradel has been here for a year or more. Apparently,
  though, he never got around to visiting us until those interviews of mine and
  yours appeared."</p>

  <p>I jumped up as the implication of that struck me. I said:</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean anything. I simply point out the coincidence."</p>

  <p>"But if they had anything to do with Dick's death, why would they risk
  coming here?"</p>

  <p>"To find out how much we know&mdash;if anything." He hesitated. "It may
  mean nothing. But&mdash;it's precisely the sort of thing I thought might
  happen when I baited my hook. And de Keradel and his daughter don't exactly
  disqualify as the sort of fish I expected to catch&mdash;and especially now I
  know about the d'Ys part. Yes&mdash;especially."</p>

  <p>He came round the table and put his hands on my shoulders:</p>

  <p>"Alan, what I'm thinking wouldn't seem as insane to you, maybe, as it does
  to me. It's not Alice in Wonderland, but Alice in Devil-land. I want you
  tonight to say anything that comes into your head. Just that. Don't be held
  back by politeness, or courtesy, or conventions or anything else. If what you
  want to say is insulting&mdash;let it be so. Don't bother about what Helen
  may think. Forget Lowell. Say whatever comes into your mind. If de Keradel
  makes any assertions with which you don't agree, don't listen politely
  &mdash;challenge him. If it makes him lose his temper, all the better. Be
  just alcoholic enough to slip out of any inhibitions of courtesy. You talk, I
  listen. Do you get it?"</p>

  <p>I laughed and said:</p>

  <p>"In vino veritas. But your idea is to make my vino bring out the veritas
  in the other party. Sound psychology. All right, Bill, I'll take another
  small one."</p>

  <p>He said: "You know your limit. But watch your step."</p>

  <p>We went down to dinner. I was feeling interested, amused, and devil-may-
  care. The image I had of the Demoiselle was simplified to a mist of
  silver-gold hair over two splotches of purple-blue in a white face. On the
  other hand, Helen's was still the sharp-cut antique coin. We sat down at
  table. Dr. Lowell was at the head, at his left de Keradel, and at his right
  the Demoiselle Dahut. Helen sat beside de Keradel and I beside the
  Demoiselle. Bill sat between me and Helen. It was a nicely arranged table,
  with tall candles instead of electrics. The butler brought cocktails and they
  were excellent. I lifted mine to Helen and said:</p>

  <p>"You are a lovely antique coin, Helen. Alexander the Great minted you.
  Someday I will put you in my pocket."</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell looked a bit startled. But Helen clinked glasses and
  murmured:</p>

  <p>"You will never lose me, will you, darling?"</p>

  <p>I said:</p>

  <p>"No, sweetheart, nor will I give you away, nor let anybody steal you, my
  lovely antique coin."</p>

  <p>There was the pressure of a soft shoulder against me. I looked away from
  Helen and straight into the eyes of the Demoiselle. They weren't just purple-
  blue splotches now. They were the damnedest eyes&mdash;big, and clear as a
  tropic shoal and little orchid sparks darted through them like the play of
  the sun through a tropic shoal when you turn over and look up through the
  clear water.</p>

  <p>I said:</p>

  <p>"Demoiselle Dahut&mdash;why do you make me think of the sea? I have seen
  the Mediterranean the exact color of your eyes. And the crests of the waves
  were as white as your skin. And there was sea-weed like your hair. Your
  fragrance is the fragrance of the sea, and you walk like a wave&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Helen drawled:</p>

  <p>"How poetic you are, darling. Perhaps you'd better eat your soup before
  you take another cocktail."</p>

  <p>I said:</p>

  <p>"Sweetheart, you are my antique coin. But you are not yet in my pocket.
  Nor am I in yours. I will have another cocktail before I eat my soup."</p>

  <p>She flushed at that. I felt bad about saying it. But I caught a glance
  from Bill that heartened me. And the Demoiselle's eyes would have repaid me
  for any remorse&mdash;if I hadn't just then felt stir that inexplicable hot
  hatred, and knew quite definitely now that fear did lurk within it. She laid
  her hand lightly on mine. It had a curious tingling warmth. At the touch, the
  strange repulsion vanished. I realized her beauty with an almost painful
  acuteness. She said:</p>

  <p>"You love the old things. It is because you are of the ancient blood
  &mdash;the blood of Armorica. Do you remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My cocktail went splashing to the floor. Bill said:</p>

  <p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, Alan. That was awkward of me. Briggs, bring Dr.
  Caranac another."</p>

  <p>I said:</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Bill."</p>

  <p>I hoped I said it easily, because deep in me was anger, wondering how long
  it had been between that "remember" of the Demoiselle's and the overturning
  of my glass. When she had said it, the tingling warmth of her had seemed to
  concentrate itself into a point of fire, a spark that shot up my arm into my
  brain. And instead of the pleasant candle-lighted room, I saw a vast plain
  covered with huge stones arranged in ordered aisles all marching to a central
  circle of monoliths within which was a gigantic cairn. I knew it to be
  Carnac, that place of mystery of the Druids and before them of a forgotten
  people, from which my family had derived its name, changed only by the
  addition of a syllable during the centuries. But it was not the Carnac I had
  known when in Brittany. This place was younger; its standing stones upright,
  in place; not yet gnawed by the teeth of untold centuries. There were people,
  hundreds of them, marching along the avenues to the monolithed circle. And
  although I knew that it was daylight, a blackness seemed to hover over the
  crypt that was the circle's heart. Nor could I see the ocean. Where it should
  have been, and far away, were tall towers of gray and red stone, misty
  outlines of walls as of a great city. And as I stood there, long and long it
  seemed to me, slowly the fear crept up my heart like a rising tide. With it
  crept, side by side, cold, implacable hatred and rage.</p>

  <p>I had heard Bill speaking&mdash;and was back in the room. The fear was
  gone. The wrath had remained.</p>

  <p>I looked into the face of the Demoiselle Dahut. I thought I read triumph
  there, and a subtle amusement. I was quite sure of what had happened, and
  that there was no need of answering her interrupted question&mdash;if it had
  been interrupted. She knew. It was hypnotism of sorts, suggestion raised to
  the nth degree. I thought that if Bill were right in his suspicions, the
  Demoiselle Dahut had not been very wise to play a card like this so soon
  &mdash;either that, or damned sure of herself. I closed my mind quickly to
  that thought.</p>

  <p>Bill, Lowell, and de Keradel were talking, Helen listening and watching me
  out of the corner of her eye. I whispered to the Demoiselle:</p>

  <p>"I knew a witch-doctor down in Zululand who could do that same thing,
  Demoiselle de Keradel. He called the trick 'sending out the soul.' He was not
  so beautiful as you are; perhaps that is why he had to take so much more time
  to do it."</p>

  <p>I was about to add that she had been as swift as the striking of a deadly
  snake, but held that back.</p>

  <p>She did not trouble to deny. She asked:</p>

  <p>"Is that all you think&mdash;Alain de Carnac?"</p>

  <p>I laughed:</p>

  <p>"No, I think that your voice is also of the sea."</p>

  <p>And so it was; the softest, sweetest contralto I'd ever heard&mdash;low
  and murmurous and lulling, like the whisper of waves on a long smooth
  beach.</p>

  <p>She said:</p>

  <p>"But is that a compliment then? Many times you have compared me to the sea
  tonight. Is not the sea treacherous?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, and let her make what she would of that answer. She did not
  seem offended.</p>

  <p>The dinner went on with talk of this and that. It was a good dinner, and
  so was the wine. The butler kept my glass filled so faithfully that I
  wondered whether Bill had given him orders. The Demoiselle was cosmopolitan
  in her points of view, witty, undeniably charming&mdash;to use that much
  misused word. She had the gift of being able to be what her conversation
  implied she was. There was nothing exotic, nothing mysterious about her now.
  She was only a modern, well-informed, cultivated young woman of extraordinary
  beauty. Helen was delightful. There wasn't a single thing for me to grow
  unpleasantly argumentative about, nor discourteous, nor insulting. I thought
  Bill was looking a bit puzzled; disconcerted&mdash;like a prophet who has
  foretold some happening which shows not the slightest sign of materializing.
  If de Keradel was interested in Dick's death, there was nothing to show it.
  For some time Lowell and he had been absorbed in low-toned discussion to the
  exclusion of the rest of us. Suddenly I heard Lowell say:</p>

  <p>"But surely you do not believe in the objective reality of such
  beings?"</p>

  <p>The question brought me sharply to attention. I remembered Dick's torn
  note&mdash;he had wanted Bill to consider something as objective instead of
  subjective; I saw that Bill was listening intently. The Demoiselle's eyes
  were upon Lowell, faint amusement in them.</p>

  <p>De Keradel answered:</p>

  <p>"I know they are objective."</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell asked, incredulously:</p>

  <p>"You believe that these creatures, these demons&mdash;actually
  existed?"</p>

  <p>"And still exist," said de Keradel. "Reproduce the exact conditions under
  which those who had the ancient wisdom evoked these beings&mdash;forces,
  presences, powers, call them what you will&mdash;and the doors shall open and
  They come through. That Bright One the Egyptians named Isis will stand before
  us as of old, challenging us to lift Her veil. And that Dark Power stronger
  than She, whom the Egyptians named Set and Typhon, but who had another name
  in the shrines of an older and wiser race&mdash;It will make Itself manifest.
  Yes, Dr. Lowell, and still others will come through the opened doors to teach
  us, to counsel us, to aid and obey us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or to command us, my father," said the Demoiselle, almost tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Or to command us," echoed de Keradel, mechanically; some of the color had
  drained from his face, and I thought there was fear in the glance he gave his
  daughter.</p>

  <p>I touched Bill's foot with mine, and felt an encouraging pressure. I
  raised my wine and squinted through it at de Keradel. I said, irritatingly
  explanatory:</p>

  <p>"Dr. de Keradel is a true showman. If one provides the right theater, the
  right scenery, the right supporting cast, the right music and script and cues
  &mdash;the right demons or whatnot bounce out from the wings as the stars of
  the show. Well, I have seen some rather creditable illusions produced under
  such conditions. Real enough to deceive most amateurs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>De Keradel's eyes dilated; he half rose from his chair; he whispered:</p>

  <p>"Amateur! Do you imply that I am an amateur?"</p>

  <p>I said, urbanely, still looking at my glass:</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I said you were a showman."</p>

  <p>He mastered his anger with difficulty; he said to Lowell:</p>

  <p>"They are not illusions, Dr. Lowell. There is a pattern, a formula, to be
  observed. Is there anything more rigid than that formula by which the
  Catholic Church establishes communion with its God? The chanting, the
  prayers, the gestures&mdash;even the intonation of the prayers&mdash;all are
  fixed. Is not every ritual&mdash;Mohammedan, Buddhist, Shintoist, every act
  of worship throughout the world, in all religions&mdash;as rigidly
  prescribed? The mind of man recognizes that only by exact formula can it
  touch the minds that are not human. It is memory of an ancient wisdom, Dr.
  Caranac&mdash;but of that no more now. I tell you again that what comes upon
  my stage is not illusion."</p>

  <p>I asked: "How do you know?"</p>

  <p>He answered, quietly: "I do know."</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell said, placatingly: "Extremely strange, extremely realistic
  visions can be induced by combinations of sounds, odors, movements, and
  colors. There even seem to be combinations which can create in different
  subjects approximately the same visions&mdash;establish similar emotional
  rhythms. But I have never had evidence that these visions were anything but
  subjective."</p>

  <p>He paused, and I saw his hands clench, the knuckles whiten; he said,
  slowly:</p>

  <p>"Except&mdash;once."</p>

  <p>De Keradel was watching him, the clenched hands could not have escaped his
  notice. He asked: "And that once?"</p>

  <p>Lowell answered, with a curious harshness: "I have no evidence."</p>

  <p>De Keradel went on: "But there is another element in this evocation which
  is not of the stage&mdash;nor of the showman, Dr. Caranac. It is, to use a
  chemical term, a catalyst. The necessary element to bring about a required
  result&mdash;itself remaining untouched and unchanged. It is a human
  element&mdash;a woman or man or child&mdash;who is en rapport with the Being
  evoked. Of such was the Pythoness at Delphi, who upon her tripod threw
  herself open to the God and spoke with his voice. Of such were the
  Priestesses of Isis of the Egyptians, and of Ishtar of the Babylonians
  &mdash;themselves the one and the same. Of such was the Priestess of Hecate,
  Goddess of Hell, whose secret rites were lost until I rediscovered them. Of
  such was the warrior-king who was Priest of tentacled Khalk-ru, the Kraken
  God of the Uighurs, and of such was that strange priest at whose summoning
  came the Black God of the Scyths, in the form of a monstrous frog&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bill broke in:</p>

  <p>"But these worships are of the far-distant past. Surely, none has believed
  in them for many a century. Therefore this peculiar line of priests and
  priestesses must long ago have died out. How today could one be found?"</p>

  <p>I thought the Demoiselle shot de Keradel a warning look, and was about to
  speak. He ignored her, swept away by this idea that ruled him, forced to
  expound, to justify, it. He said:</p>

  <p>"But you are wrong. They do live. They live in the brains of those who
  sprang from them. They sleep in the brains of their descendants. They sleep
  until one comes who knows how to awaken them. And to that awakener&mdash;
  what reward! Not the golden and glittering trash in the tomb of some
  Tut-ankh-Amen, not the sterile loot of some Genghis Khan, or of Attila...
  shining pebbles and worthless metal... playthings. But storehouses of
  memories, hives of knowledge&mdash;knowledge that sets its possessor so high
  above all other men that he is as a god."</p>

  <p>I said, politely:</p>

  <p>"I'd like to be a god for a time. Where can I find such storehouse? Or
  open such hive? It would be worth a few stings to become a god."</p>

  <p>The veins throbbed in his temples; he said:</p>

  <p>"You mock! Nevertheless, I will give you a hint. Once Dr. Charcot
  hypnotized a girl who had long been a subject of his experiments. He sent her
  deeper into the hypnotic sleep than ever he had dared before with any
  subject. Suddenly he heard another voice than hers coming from her throat. It
  was a man's voice, the rough voice of a French peasant. He questioned that
  voice. It told him many things&mdash;things the girl could not possibly have
  known. The voice spoke of incidents of the Jacquerie. And the Jacquerie was
  six hundred years before. Dr. Charcot took down what that voice told him.
  Later, he investigated, minutely. He verified. He traced the girl's
  parentage. She had come straight down from a leader of that peasant uprising.
  He tried again. He pushed past that voice to another. And this voice, a
  woman's, told him of things that had happened a thousand years ago. Told them
  in intimate detail, as one who had been a spectator of these happenings. And
  again he investigated. And again he found that what the voice had told him
  was true."</p>

  <p>I asked, even more politely:</p>

  <p>"And have we now arrived at transmigration of souls?"</p>

  <p>He answered, violently:</p>

  <p>"You dare to mock! What Charcot did was to pierce through veil upon veil
  of memory for a thousand years. I have gone further than that. I have gone
  back through the veils of memory not one thousand years. I have gone back ten
  thousand. I, de Keradel, tell you so."</p>

  <p>Lowell said:</p>

  <p>"But Dr. de Keradel&mdash;memory is not carried by the germ plasm.
  Physical characteristics, weaknesses, predilections, coloration, shape, and
  so on&mdash;yes. The son of a violinist can inherit his father's hands, his
  talent, his ear&mdash;but not the memory of the notes that his father played.
  Not his father's memories."</p>

  <p>De Keradel said:</p>

  <p>"You are wrong. Those memories can be carried. In the brain. Or rather, in
  that which uses the brain as its instrument. I do not say that every one
  inherits these memories of their ancestors. Brains are not standardized.
  Nature is not a uniform workman. In some, the cells that carry these memories
  seem to be lacking. In others they are incomplete, blurred, having many
  hiatuses. But in others, a few, they are complete, the records clear, to be
  read like a printed book if the needle of consciousness, the eye of
  consciousness, can be turned upon them."</p>

  <p>He ignored me; to Dr. Lowell he said with intense earnestness:</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Dr. Lowell, that this is so&mdash;in spite of all that has
  been written of the germ plasm, the chromosomes, the genes&mdash;the little
  carriers of heredity. I tell you that I have proved it to be so. And I tell
  you that there are minds in which are memories that go back and back to a
  time when man was not yet man. Back to the memories of his ape-like
  forefathers. Back further even than that&mdash;to the first amphibians who
  crawled out of the sea and began the long climb up the ladder of evolution to
  become what we are today."</p>

  <p>I had no desire now to interrupt, no desire to anger&mdash;the man's
  intensity of belief was too strong. He said:</p>

  <p>"Dr. Caranac has spoken, contemptuously, of the transmigration of souls. I
  say that man can imagine nothing that cannot be, and that he who speaks
  contemptuously of any belief is therefore an ignorant man. I say that it is
  this inheritance of memories which is at the bottom of the belief in
  reincarnation&mdash;perhaps the belief in immortality. Let me take an
  illustration from one of your modern toys&mdash;the phonograph. What we call
  consciousness is a needle that, running along the dimension of time, records
  upon certain cells its experiences. Quite as the recording needle of a
  phonograph does upon the master disks. It can run this needle back over these
  cells after they have been stored away, turning the graphs upon them
  into&mdash;memories. Hearing again, seeing again, living again, the
  experiences recorded on them. Not always can the consciousness find one of
  these disks it seeks. Then we say that we have forgotten. Sometimes the
  graphs are not deep cut enough, the disks blurred&mdash;and then we say
  memory is hazy, incomplete.</p>

  <p>"The ancestral memories, the ancient disks, are stored in another part of
  the brain, away from those that carry the memories of this life. Obviously
  this must be so, else there would be confusion, and the human animal would be
  hampered by intrusion of memories having no relation to his present
  environment. In the ancient days, when life was simpler and the environment
  not so complex, the two sets of memories were closer. That is why we say that
  ancient man relied more upon his 'intuitions' and less upon reason. That is
  why primitive men today do the same. But as time went on, and life grew more
  complex, those who depended less upon the ancestral memories than those which
  dealt with the problems of their own time&mdash;those were the ones with the
  better chance to survive. Once the cleavage had begun, it must perforce have
  continued rapidly&mdash;like all such evolutionary processes.</p>

  <p>"Nature does not like to lose entirely anything it has once created.
  Therefore it is that at a certain stage of its development the human embryo
  has the gills of the fish, and at a later stage the hair of the ape. And,
  therefore, it is that in certain men and women today, these storehouses of
  ancient memories are fully stocked&mdash;to be opened, Dr. Caranac, and
  having been opened, to be read."</p>

  <p>I smiled and drank another glass of wine.</p>

  <p>Lowell said:</p>

  <p>"That is all strongly suggestive, Dr. de Keradel. If your theory is
  correct, then these inherited memories would without doubt appear as former
  lives to those who could recall them. They could be a basis of the doctrine
  of transmigration of souls, of reincarnation. How else could the primitive
  mind account for them?"</p>

  <p>De Keradel said:</p>

  <p>"They explain many things&mdash;the thought of the Chinese that unless a
  man has a son, he dies indeed. The folk saying&mdash;'A man lives in his
  children...'"</p>

  <p>Lowell said:</p>

  <p>"The new born bee knows precisely the law and duties of the hive. It does
  not have to be taught to fan, to clean, to mix the pollen and the nectar into
  the jellies that produce the queen and the drone, the different jelly that is
  placed in the cell of the worker. None teaches it the complex duties of the
  hive. The knowledge, the memory, is in the egg, the wriggler, the nymph. It
  is true, too, of the ants, and of many insects. But it is not true of man,
  nor of any other mammal."</p>

  <p>De Keradel said:</p>

  <p>"It is true also of man."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04"></a>4. &mdash; THE LOST CITY OF YS</h2>

  <p class="first">There was a devil of a lot of truth in what de Keradel had
  said. I had come across manifestations of that same ancestral memory in odd
  corners of the earth. I had been burning to corroborate him, despite that
  excusable dig of his at my ignorance. I would have liked to talk to him as
  one investigator to another.</p>

  <p>Instead I drained my glass and said severely: "Briggs&mdash;I have not had
  a drink for five minutes," and then to the table in general: "Just a moment.
  Let us be logical. Anything so important as the soul and its travels deserves
  the fullest consideration. Dr. de Keradel began this discussion by asserting
  the objective existence of what the showman produced. That is correct, Dr. de
  Keradel?"</p>

  <p>He answered, stiffly: "Yes."</p>

  <p>I said: "Dr. de Keradel then adduced certain experiments of Dr. Charcot in
  hypnotism. Those cases are not convincing to me. In the South Seas, in
  Africa, in Kamchatka, I have heard the most arrant fakirs speak not in two or
  three but in half a dozen voices. It is a well-known fact that a hypnotized
  subject will sometimes speak in different voices. It is quite as well known
  that a schizoid, a case of multiple personality, will speak in voices ranging
  from high soprano to bass. And all this without ancestral memories being
  involved.</p>

  <p>"It is a symptom of their condition. Nothing more. Am I right, Dr.
  Lowell?"</p>

  <p>Lowell said: "You are."</p>

  <p>I said: "As for what Charcot's subjects told him&mdash;who knows what they
  had heard their grandmothers say? Stories passed down by the family
  &mdash;heard when children, treasured by the sub-consciousness. Built up,
  improvements suggested, by Charcot himself. Charcot finds two or three points
  true, naturally. There is none so credulous as he who seeks evidence to
  support his idée fixe, his pet theory. So these few points become all. Well,
  I am not so credulous as Charcot, Dr. de Keradel."</p>

  <p>He said: "I read your interviews in the newspaper. I seemed to detect a
  certain amount of credulity there, Dr. Caranac."</p>

  <p>So he had read the interviews. I felt Bill press my foot again. I
  said:</p>

  <p>"I tried to make plain to the reporters that belief in the hokum was
  necessary to make the hokum effective. I admit that to the victim of his
  belief it doesn't make much difference whether it was hokum or reality. But
  that doesn't mean that the hokum is real or can affect anybody else. And I
  tried to make plain that the defense against the hokum is very simple. It is
  &mdash;don't believe it."</p>

  <p>The veins on his forehead began to twitch again. He said: "By hokum you
  mean, I assume, nonsense."</p>

  <p>"More than that," I said, cheerfully. "Bunk!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell looked pained. I drank my wine, and grinned at the
  Demoiselle.</p>

  <p>Helen said: "Your manners aren't so good tonight, darling."</p>

  <p>I said: "Manners&mdash;hell! What're manners in a discussion of goblins,
  incarnation, ancestral memories and Isis, Set and the Black God of the Scyths
  who looked like a frog? Now I'm going to tell you something, Dr. de Keradel.
  I've been in a lot of out of the way corners of this globe. I went there
  hunting for goblins and demons. And in all my travels I've never seen one
  thing that couldn't be explained on the basis of hypnotism, mass suggestion,
  or trickery. Get that. Not one thing. And I've seen a lot."</p>

  <p>That was a lie&mdash;but I wanted to see the effect on him. I saw it. The
  veins in his temples were twitching more than ever, his lips were white. I
  said:</p>

  <p>"Years ago I had a brilliant idea which puts the whole problem in its
  simplest form. The brilliant idea was based on the fact that the hearing is
  probably the last sense to die; that after the heart stops the brain
  continues to function as long as it has enough oxygen; and that while the
  brain does function, although every sense is dead&mdash;it can have
  experiences that seem to last for days and weeks, although the actual dream
  lasts but a fraction of a second.</p>

  <p>"'Heaven and Hell, Inc.' That was my idea. 'Insure yourself an immortality
  of joy!' 'Give your enemy an immortality of torment!' To be done by expert
  hypnotists, masters of suggestion, sitting at the bedside of the dying and
  whispering into his ear that which the brain was to dramatize, after hearing
  and every other sense was dead&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle drew a sharp breath. De Keradel was staring at me with a
  strange intentness.</p>

  <p>"Well, there it was," I went on. "For a sufficient sum you could promise,
  and actually give, your client the immortality he desired. Any kind he wanted
  &mdash;from the houri-haunted Paradise of Mahomet to the angel choirs of
  Paradise. And if the sum were sufficient, and you could gain access, you
  could whisper into the ear of your employer's enemy the Hell he was going
  into for aeon after aeon. And I'll bet he'd go into it. That was my 'Heaven
  and Hell, Inc.'"</p>

  <p>"A sweet idea, darling," murmured Helen.</p>

  <p>"A sweet idea, yes," I said, bitterly. "Let me tell you what it did for
  me. It happens that it's entirely feasible. Very well&mdash;consider me, the
  inventor. If there is a delectable life after death, will I enjoy it? Not at
  all. I'll be thinking&mdash;this is just a vision in the dying cells of my
  brain. It has no objective reality. Nothing that could happen to me in that
  future existence, assuming it to be real, could be real to me. I would
  think&mdash;Oh, yes, very ingenious of me to create such ideas, but after
  all, they're only in the dying cells of my brain. Of course," I said, grimly,
  "there is a compensation. If I happened to land in one of the traditional
  hells, I wouldn't take it any more seriously. And all the miracles of magic,
  or sorcery, I've ever beheld were no more real than those dying visions would
  be."</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle whispered, so faintly that none but I could hear: "I could
  make them real to you, Alan de Caranac&mdash;either Heaven or Hell."</p>

  <p>I said: "In life or in death, your theories cannot be proven, Dr. de
  Keradel. At least, not to me."</p>

  <p>He did not answer, staring at me, fingers tapping the table.</p>

  <p>I went on: "Suppose, for example, you desired to know what it was that
  they worshiped among the stones of Carnac. You might reproduce every rite.
  Might have your descendant of priestess with the ancient ghost wide-awake in
  her brain. But how could you know that what came to the great cairn within
  the circle of monoliths&mdash;the Gatherer within the Cairn, the Visitor to
  the Alkar-Az&mdash;was real?"</p>

  <p>De Keradel asked, incredulously, in a curiously still voice, as though
  exercising some strong restraint: "What can you know of the Alkar-Az&mdash;
  or of the Gatherer within the Cairn?"</p>

  <p>I was wondering about that, too. I couldn't remember ever having heard
  those names. Yet they had sprung to my lips as though long known. I looked at
  the Demoiselle. She dropped her eyes, but not before I had seen in them that
  same half-amused triumph as when, under the touch of her hand, I had beheld
  ancient Carnac. I answered de Keradel:</p>

  <p>"Ask your daughter."</p>

  <p>His eyes were no longer blue, they had no color at all. They were like
  little spheres of pale fire. He did not speak&mdash;but his eyes demanded
  answer from her. The Demoiselle met them indifferently. She shrugged a white
  shoulder. She said: "I did not tell him." She added, with a distinct touch of
  malice: "Perhaps, my father&mdash;he remembered."</p>

  <p>I leaned to her, and touched her glass with mine; I was feeling pretty
  good again. I said: "I remember&mdash;I remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Helen said, tartly: "If you drink much more of that wine, you're going to
  remember a swell headache, darling."</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle Dahut murmured: "What do you remember, Alain de
  Carnac?"</p>

  <p>I sang the old Breton song&mdash;to the English words:</p>

  <p class="poem">Fisher! Fisher! Have you seen<br>
  White Dahut the Shadows' Queen?<br>
  Riding on her stallion black.<br>
  At her heels her shadow pack&mdash;<br>
  Have you seen Dahut ride by.<br>
  Swift as cloudy shadows fly<br>
  O'er the moon in stormy sky.<br>
  On her stallion black as night&mdash;<br>
  Shadows' Queen&mdash;Dahut the White?</p>

  <p>There was a queer silence. Then I noticed that de Keradel was sitting up
  oddly rigid and looking at me with that same expression he had worn when I
  had spoken of the Alkar-Az&mdash;and the Gatherer in the Cairn. Also that
  Bill's face had bleached. I looked at the Demoiselle and there were little
  dancing orchid sparks in her eyes. I hadn't the slightest idea why the old
  song should have had such an effect.</p>

  <p>Helen said: "That's a weird melody, Alan. Who was Dahut the White?"</p>

  <p>"A witch, angel," I told her. "A wicked, beautiful witch. Not a torched-
  tressed witch like you, but a blonde one. She lived twenty centuries or more
  ago in a city named Ys. Nobody knows quite where Ys was, but probably its
  towers rose where now the sea flows between Quiberon and Belle Isle.
  Certainly, it was once land there. Ys was a wicked city, filled with witches
  and sorcerers, but wickedest of all was Dahut the White, the daughter of the
  King. She picked her lovers where she would. They pleased her for a night,
  two nights&mdash;seldom three. Then she cast them from her... into the sea,
  some say. Or, say others, she gave them to her shadows&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bill interrupted: "What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>His face was whiter than before. De Keradel was looking sharply at him. I
  said:</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;shadows. Didn't I sing to you that she was Queen of Shadows?
  She was a witch&mdash;and could make shadows do her bidding. All sorts of
  shadows&mdash;shadows of the lovers she'd killed, demon shadows, Incubi and
  Succubae nightmares&mdash;a specialist in shadows was the White Dahut,
  according to the legend.</p>

  <p>"At last the Gods determined to take a hand. Don't ask me what Gods.
  Pagan, if all this was before the introduction of Christianity&mdash;
  Christian if after. Whichever they were, they must have believed that who
  lives by the sword must die by the sword and all of that, because they sent
  to Ys a youthful hero with whom Dahut fell instantly, completely, and madly
  in love.</p>

  <p>"He was the first man she had ever loved, despite her former affairs. But
  he was coy&mdash;aloof. He could forgive her previous philandering, but
  before he would accept her favors he must be convinced she truly loved him.
  How could she convince him? Quite easily. Ys, it appears was below sea-level
  and protected by walls which kept out the tides. There was one gate which
  would let in the sea. Why was there such a gate? I don't know. Probably for
  use in case of invasion, revolution, or something of the sort. At any rate,
  the legend says, there was such a gate. The key to it hung always about the
  neck of the King of Ys, Dahut's father.</p>

  <p>"'Bring me that key&mdash;and I'll know you love me,' said the hero. Dahut
  stole down to her sleeping father, and stole the key from his neck. She gave
  it to her lover. He opened the sea-gates. The sea poured in. Finish
  &mdash;for wicked Ys. Finish&mdash;for wicked Dahut the White."</p>

  <p>"She was drowned?" asked Helen.</p>

  <p>"That's the curious detail of the legend. The story is that Dahut had a
  rush of filial devotion to the heart, rushed away, awakened the father she
  had betrayed, took her big black stallion, mounted it, drew the King up
  behind her and tried to beat the waves to higher ground. There must have been
  something good in her after all. But&mdash;another extraordinary detail
  &mdash;her shadows rebelled, got behind the waves and pushed them on higher
  and faster. So the waves overtook the stallion and Dahut and her papa&mdash;
  and that was indeed their finish. But still they ride along the shores of
  Quiberon 'on her stallion black, at her heels her shadow pack-'" I stopped,
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>My left arm had been raised, the glass of wine within it. By a freak of
  the light, the candles threw its shadow sharply upon the white tablecloth,
  directly in front of the Demoiselle.</p>

  <p>And the Demoiselle's white hands were busy with the shadow of my wrist, as
  though measuring it, as though passing something under and around it.</p>

  <p>I dropped my hand and caught hers. Swiftly she slipped them under the edge
  of the table. As swiftly I dropped my right hand and took from her fingers
  what they held. It was a long hair, and as I raised it, I saw that it was one
  of her own.</p>

  <p>I thrust it into the candle flame and held it there while it writhed and
  shriveled.</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle laughed&mdash;sweet, mocking laughter. I heard de Keradel's
  chuckle echo hers. The disconcerting thing was that his amusement seemed not
  only frank but friendly. The Demoiselle said:</p>

  <p>"First he compares me to the sea&mdash;the treacherous sea. Then darkly,
  by inference, to wicked Dahut, the Shadow Queen. And then he thinks me a
  witch&mdash;and burns my hair. And yet&mdash;he says he is not credulous
  &mdash;that he does not believe!"</p>

  <p>Again she laughed&mdash;and again De Keradel echoed her.</p>

  <p>I felt foolish, damned foolish. It was touché for the Demoiselle, beyond
  any doubt. I glared at Bill. Why the devil had he led me into such a trap.
  But Bill was not laughing. He was looking at the Demoiselle with a face
  peculiarly stony. Nor was Helen smiling. She was looking at the Demoiselle
  too. With that expression which women wear when they desire to call another
  by one of those beautifully descriptive Old English words which the Oxford
  Dictionary says are "not now in decent use."</p>

  <p>I grinned, and said to her: "It appears that another lady has put me on a
  hornet's nest."</p>

  <p>Helen gave me a long comforting look. It said: "I can do that, but God
  help any other woman who tries it."</p>

  <p>There was a short and awkward silence. De Keradel broke it.</p>

  <p>"I do not quite know why, but I am reminded of a question I wished to ask
  you, Dr. Bennett. I was much interested in the account of the suicide of Mr.
  Ralston, who, I gathered from your interview in the newspapers, was not only
  a patient of yours but a close friend."</p>

  <p>I saw Bill blink in the old way when he had come to some unshakeable
  conviction. He answered, smoothly, in his best professional manner.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, Dr. de Keradel, as friend and patient I probably knew him as
  well as anyone."</p>

  <p>De Keradel said: "It is not so much his death that interests me. It is
  that in the account of it three other men were mentioned. His death linked to
  theirs, in fact, as though the same cause were behind all."</p>

  <p>Bill said: "Quite so."</p>

  <p>I had the idea that the Demoiselle was watching Bill intently from the
  corners of her lovely eyes. De Keradel took up his glass, twirled it slowly,
  and said:</p>

  <p>"I am really much interested, Dr. Bennett. We are all of us physicians,
  here. Your sister... my daughter... are of course in our confidence. They
  will not talk. Do you think that these four deaths had anything in
  common?"</p>

  <p>"Without doubt," answered Bill.</p>

  <p>"What?" asked de Keradel.</p>

  <p>"Shadows!" said Bill.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05"></a>5. &mdash; THE WHISPERING SHADOW</h2>

  <p class="first">I stared at Bill, incredulously. I remembered his anxiety
  over my mention of shadows to the reporters, and his tenseness when I had
  told of the Shadows of Dahut the White. And here we were, back to shadows
  again. There must be some link, but what was it?</p>

  <p>De Keradel exclaimed: "Shadows! Do you mean all suffered from identical
  hallucinations?"</p>

  <p>"Shadows&mdash;yes," said Bill. "Hallucinations&mdash;I'm not sure."</p>

  <p>De Keradel repeated, thoughtfully: "You are not sure." Then asked: "Were
  these shadows&mdash;what your friend and patient desired you to regard as
  objective rather than subjective? I read the newspaper reports with great
  interest, Dr. Bennett."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you did, Dr. de Keradel," said Bill, and there was an edge of
  irony to his voice. "Yes&mdash;it was the shadow which he desired me to
  regard as real, not imaginary. The shadow&mdash;not shadows. There was only
  one&mdash;" He paused, then added with a faint but plainly deliberate
  emphasis&mdash;"only one shadow for each... you know."</p>

  <p>I thought I understood Bill's plan of battle. He was playing a hunch;
  bluffing; pretending to have knowledge of this shadowy decoy of death,
  whatever the thing might be, exactly as he had pretended to have knowledge of
  a common cause for the four suicides. He had used that bait to lure his fish
  within range of the hook. Now that he thought he had them there, he was using
  the same bait to make them take it. I didn't believe he knew any more than
  when he had talked to me at the Club. And I thought he was dangerously
  underestimating the de Keradels. That last thrust had been a bit obvious.</p>

  <p>De Keradel was saying, placidly: "One shadow or many, what difference, Dr.
  Bennett? Hallucinatory shapes may appear singly&mdash;as tradition says the
  shade of Julius Caesar appeared to the remorseful Brutus. Or be multiplied by
  the thousands which the dying brain of Tiberius pictured thronging about his
  death bed, menacing him who had slain them. There are organic disturbances
  which create such hallucinations. Ocular irregularities produce them. Drugs
  and alcohol spawn them. They are born of abnormalities of brain and nerves.
  They are children of auto-intoxication. Progeny of fever, and of high blood
  pressure. They are also born of conscience. Am I to understand that you
  reject all these rational explanations?"</p>

  <p>Bill said, stolidly: "No. Say, rather, that I do not yet accept any of
  them."</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell said, abruptly: "There is still another explanation.
  Suggestion. Post-hypnotic suggestion. If Ralston and the others had come
  under the influence of someone who knew how to control minds by such
  methods... then I can well understand how they might have been driven to kill
  themselves. I, myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His fingers clenched around the stem of the wine glass. The stem snapped,
  cutting him. He wrapped a napkin around the bleeding hand. He said: "It is no
  matter. I wish the memory that caused it went no deeper."</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle's eyes were on him, and there was a tiny smile at the
  corners of her mouth. I was sure de Keradel had missed nothing. He asked:</p>

  <p>"Do you accept Dr. Lowell's explanation?"</p>

  <p>Bill answered, hesitantly: "No&mdash;not entirely&mdash;I don't know."</p>

  <p>The Breton paused, studying him with a curious intentness. He said,
  "Orthodox science tells us that a shadow is only a diminution of light within
  a certain area caused by the interposition of a material body between a
  source of light and some surface. It is insubstantial, an airy nothing. So
  orthodox science tells us. What and where was the material body that cast
  this shadow upon the four&mdash;if it was no hallucination?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell said: "A thought placed cunningly in a man's mind might cast
  such shadow."</p>

  <p>De Keradel replied, blandly: "But Dr. Bennett does not accept that
  theory."</p>

  <p>Bill said nothing. De Keradel went on: "If Dr. Bennett believes that a
  shadow caused the deaths, and if he will not admit it hallucination, nor that
  it was cast and directed by a material body&mdash;then inevitably the
  conclusion must be that he admits a shadow may have the attributes of a
  material body. This shadow came necessarily from somewhere; it attaches
  itself to someone, follows, and finally compels that someone to kill himself.
  All this implies volition, cognition, purpose and emotion. These shadows?
  They are attributes of material things only&mdash;phenomena of the
  consciousness housed in the brain. The brain is material and lives in an
  indubitably material skull. But a shadow is not material, and therefore can
  have no skull to house a brain; and therefore can have no brain, and
  therefore no consciousness. And, still again, therefore, can have no
  volition, cognition, will, or emotion. And, lastly therefore, could not
  possibly urge, lure, drive, frighten, or coerce a material living being to
  self-destruction. And if you do not agree with that, my dear Dr. Bennett,
  what you are admitting is&mdash;witchcraft."</p>

  <p>Bill answered, quietly: "If so, why do you laugh at me? What are those
  theories of ritual you have been expounding to us but witchcraft? Perhaps you
  have converted me, Dr. de Keradel."</p>

  <p>The Breton stopped laughing, abruptly, he said: "So?" and again, slowly:
  "So! But they are not theories, Dr. Bennett. They are discoveries. Or,
  rather, rediscoveries of, let us say, unorthodox science." The veins in his
  forehead were twitching; he added, with an indefinable menace: "If it is
  truly I who have opened your eyes&mdash;I hope to make your conversion
  complete."</p>

  <p>I saw that Lowell was looking at de Keradel with a strange intentness. The
  Demoiselle was looking at Bill, the little devilish lights flickering in her
  eyes; and I thought that there were both malice and calculation in her faint
  smile. There was an odd tension about the table&mdash;as of something unseen,
  crouching and ready to strike.</p>

  <p>Helen broke it, quoting dreamily:</p>

  <p>Some there be that shadows kiss.</p>

  <p>Such have but a shadow's bliss&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle was laughing; laughter that was more like the laughter of
  little waves than anything else. But there were undertones to it that I liked
  even less than the subtle menace in her smile&mdash;something inhuman, as
  though the little waves were laughing at the dead men who lay under them.</p>

  <p>De Keradel spoke rapidly, in a tongue that I felt I ought to recognize,
  but did not. The Demoiselle became demure. She said, sweetly: "Your pardon,
  Mademoiselle Helen. It was not at you that I laughed. It was that suddenly I
  am reminded of something infinitely amusing. Someday I shall tell you and you
  too will laugh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>De Keradel interrupted her, urbane as before: "And I ask your pardon, Dr.
  Bennett. You must excuse the rudeness of an enthusiast. And also his
  persistency. Because I now ask if you could, without too great violation of
  confidence between physician and patient, inform me as to the symptoms of Mr.
  Ralston. The behavior of this&mdash;this shadow, if you will call it so. I am
  greatly curious&mdash;professionally."</p>

  <p>Bill said: "There's nothing I'd like better. You, with your unique
  experience may recognize some point of significance that I have missed. To
  satisfy professional ethics, let us call it a consultation, even though it is
  a postmortem one."</p>

  <p>I had the fleeting thought that Bill was pleased; that he had scored some
  point toward which he had been maneuvering. I pushed my chair back a little
  so that I could see both the Demoiselle and her father. Bill said:</p>

  <p>"I'll start from the beginning. If there is anything you want me to
  amplify, don't hesitate to interrupt. Ralston called me up and said he wanted
  me to look him over. I had neither seen nor heard from him for a couple of
  months; had thought, indeed, that he was on one of his trips abroad. He
  began, abruptly: 'Something's wrong with me, Bill. I see a shadow.' I
  laughed, but he didn't. He repeated: 'I see a shadow, Bill. And I'm afraid!'
  I said, still laughing: 'If you couldn't see a shadow you certainly would
  have something wrong with you.' He answered like a frightened child.</p>

  <p>"'But, Bill&mdash;there's nothing to make this shadow!'</p>

  <p>"He leaned toward me, and now I realized that he was holding himself
  together by truly extraordinary effort. He asked: 'Does that mean I'm going
  crazy? Is seeing a shadow a common symptom when you are going insane? Tell
  me, Bill&mdash;is it?'</p>

  <p>"I told him that the notion was nonsense; that in all probability some
  little thing was wrong with his eyes or his liver. He said: 'But this shadow
  &mdash;whispers!'</p>

  <p>"I said: 'You need a drink,' and I gave him a stiff one. I said: 'Tell me
  exactly what it is you think you see, and, if you can, precisely when you
  first thought you saw it.' He answered: 'Four nights ago. I was in the
  library, writing-' Let me explain, Dr. de Keradel, that he lived in the old
  Ralston house on 78th Street; alone except for Simpson, the butler, who was a
  heritage from his father, and half a dozen servants. He went on: 'I thought I
  saw someone or something slip along the wall into the curtains that cover the
  window. The window was at my back and I was intent upon my letter, but the
  impression was so vivid that I jumped up and went over to the curtains. There
  was nothing there. I returned to my desk&mdash;but I couldn't get rid of the
  feeling that someone or something was in the room.'</p>

  <p>"He said: 'I was so disturbed that I made a note of the time.'"</p>

  <p>"A mental echo of the visual hallucination," said De Keradel. "An obvious
  concomitant."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Bill. "At any rate, a little later he had the same
  experience, only this time the movement was from right to left, the reverse
  of the first. In the next half hour it was repeated six times, always in the
  opposite direction&mdash;I mean, from left to right, then right to left and
  so on. He laid emphasis upon this, as though he thought it in some way
  significant. He said: 'It was, as though it were weaving.' I asked what 'It'
  was like. He said: 'It had no shape. It was just movement&mdash;No, it had no
  shape then.' The feeling of not being alone in the room increased to such an
  uncomfortable pitch that shortly after midnight he left the library, leaving
  the lights burning, and turned in. There was no recurrence of the symptoms,
  in his bedroom. He slept soundly. Nor was he troubled the next night. By the
  day following he had almost forgotten the matter.</p>

  <p>"That night he dined out and came home about eleven o'clock. He went into
  the library to go over his mail. He told me: 'Suddenly I had the strongest
  feeling that someone was watching me from the curtains. I turned my head,
  slowly. I distinctly saw a shadow upon the curtains. Or, rather, as though it
  were intermingled with them&mdash;like a shadow cast by something behind. It
  was about the size and shape of a man.' He jumped to the curtains and tore
  them away. Nothing was behind them nor was there anything beyond the window
  to cast a shadow. He sat down again at the table, but still he felt eyes upon
  him. 'Unwending eyes,' he said. 'Eyes that never left me. Eyes of someone or
  something that kept always just past the edge of my field of vision. If I
  turned quickly, it slipped behind me, was watching me from my other side. If
  I moved slowly, just as slowly did it move.'</p>

  <p>"Sometimes he caught a flickering movement, a shadowy flitting, as he
  pursued the eyes. Sometimes he thought he had caught the shadow. But always
  it faded, was gone, before he could focus it. And instantly he felt its gaze
  upon him from another quarter.</p>

  <p>"'From right to left it went,' he said. 'From left to right... and back
  again... and back again and again... weaving... weaving... '</p>

  <p>"'Weaving what?' I asked, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"He answered, quite simply: 'My shroud.'</p>

  <p>"He sat there, fighting until he could fight no more. Then he sought
  refuge in his bedroom. He did not sleep well, for he thought the shadow was
  lurking on the threshold; had pressed itself against the other side of the
  door, listening. If so, it did not enter.</p>

  <p>"Dawn came, and after that he slept soundly. He arose late, spent the
  afternoon at golf, dined out, went with a party to the theater and then to a
  night club. For hours he had given no thought to the experience of the night
  before. He said: 'If I thought of it at all, it was to laugh at it as
  childish foolishness.' He reached home about three o'clock. He let himself
  in. As he closed the door he heard a whisper&mdash;'You are late!' It was
  quite plain, and as though the whisperer stood close beside him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>De Keradel interrupted: "Progressive hallucination. First the idea of
  movement; then the sharpening into shape; then sound. Hallucination
  progressing from the visual field to the auditory."</p>

  <p>Bill went on, as though he had not heard: "He said the voice had some
  quality which&mdash;I quote him&mdash;'made you feel the loathing you do when
  you put your hand on a slimy slug in a garden at night, and at the same time
  an unholy desire to have it go on whispering forever.' He said: 'It was
  unnamable horror and perverted ecstasy in one.'</p>

  <p>"Simpson had left the lights burning. The hall was well lighted. He could
  see no one. But the voice had been reality. He stood for a few moments
  fighting for control. Then he walked in, took off hat and top-coat, and
  started for the stairs. He said: 'I happened to look down, and over the top
  of my eyes I saw a shadow gliding along about six feet ahead of me. I raised
  my eyes&mdash;and it vanished. I went slowly up the stairs. If I looked down
  at the steps I could see the shadow flitting ahead of me. Always at the same
  distance. When I looked up&mdash;there was nothing. The shadow was sharper
  than it had been the night before. I thought it was the shadow of a woman. A
  naked woman. And suddenly I realized that the whispering voice had been that
  of a woman.'</p>

  <p>"He went straight to his room. He passed the door. He looked down and saw
  the shadow still those two paces before him. He stepped swiftly back and into
  the room, closing the door and locking it. He switched on the lights and
  stood with his ear against the door. He said: 'I heard someone, something,
  laughing. The same voice that had whispered.' And then he heard it whisper
  &mdash;'I will watch outside your door tonight... tonight... tonight... ' He
  listened with that same alien mixture of horror and desire. He lusted to
  throw open the door, but the loathing held back his hand. He said: 'I kept
  the lights on. But the thing did what it had promised. It watched all night
  at my door. It wasn't quiet though. It danced... I couldn't see it... but I
  know it danced... out there in the hall. It danced and weaved... right to
  left... left to right and back again and again... danced and weaved till dawn
  outside my door... weaving... my shroud, Bill... '</p>

  <p>"I reasoned with him, much along your lines, Dr. de Keradel. I went over
  him thoroughly. I could find, superficially, nothing wrong. I took specimens
  for the various tests. He said: 'I hope to God you do find something wrong,
  Bill. If you don't&mdash;it means the shadow is real. I think I'd rather know
  I was going crazy than that. After all, craziness can be cured.'</p>

  <p>"I said: 'You're not going back to your house. You're going to stay at the
  Club until I've gotten my reports. Then, no matter what they show, you're
  going to hop on a boat and take a long trip.'</p>

  <p>"He shook his head: 'I've got to go back to the house, Bill.'</p>

  <p>"I asked: 'Why, for God's sake?'</p>

  <p>"He hesitated, puzzled distress on his face; he said: 'I don't know. But
  I've got to.'</p>

  <p>"I said, firmly: 'You stay here with me tonight, and tomorrow you hop on a
  boat. To anywhere. I'll let you know about the tests and do my prescribing by
  radio.' He replied, still with that same puzzled look: 'I can't go away now.
  The fact... ' he hesitated... 'the fact is, Bill... I've met a girl... a
  woman. I can't leave her.'</p>

  <p>"I gaped at him. I said: 'You're going to marry her? Who is she?'</p>

  <p>"He looked at me, helplessly: 'I can't tell you, Bill. I can't tell you
  anything about her.'</p>

  <p>"I asked: 'Why not?'</p>

  <p>"He answered with the same puzzled hesitation. 'I don't know why I can't.
  But I can't. It seems to be a part of&mdash;of the other in some way. But I
  can't tell you.' And to every question that touched upon this girl he had the
  same answer."</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell said, sharply: "You told me nothing of that, Dr. Bennett. He
  said nothing more to you than that? That he could not tell you anything more
  about this woman? That he did not know why&mdash;but he could not?"</p>

  <p>Bill said: "That&mdash;and no more."</p>

  <p>Helen said, coldly: "What amuses you so, Demoiselle? I do not find
  anything in all this that is humorous."</p>

  <p>I looked at the Demoiselle. The little orchid sparks were alive in her
  eyes, her red lips smiling&mdash;and cruel.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06"></a>6. &mdash; KISS OF THE SHADOW</h2>

  <p class="first">I said: "The Demoiselle is a true artist."</p>

  <p>There was a small, tense silence around the table. De Keradel broke it,
  harshly:</p>

  <p>"Exactly what do you mean by that, Dr. Caranac?</p>

  <p>I smiled: "All true artists are pleased when art attains excellence. Story
  telling is an art. Dr. Bennett was telling his perfectly. Therefore, your
  daughter, a true artist, was pleased. A perfect syllogism. Is it not true,
  Demoiselle?"</p>

  <p>She answered, quietly:</p>

  <p>"You have said it." But she was no longer smiling, and her eyes said
  something else. So did de Keradel's. Before he could speak, I said:</p>

  <p>"Only tribute from one artist to another, Helen. Go on, Bill."</p>

  <p>Bill went on, quickly:</p>

  <p>"I sat and reasoned with him. Betimes, I gave him several stiff drinks. I
  related some famous cases of hallucination&mdash;Paganini, the great
  violinist, who at times thought he saw a shadowy woman in white stand beside
  him playing her violin while he played his. Leonardo da Vinci who thought he
  saw and spoke with the shade of Chiron, wisest of all the Centaurs, who
  tutored the youthful Aesculapius&mdash;dozens of similar instances. I told
  him he had become a companion of men of genius and that it was probably a
  sign of something like that breaking out on him. After a while he was
  laughing. He said: 'All right, Bill. I'm convinced. But the thing for me to
  do is not to run away from it. The thing for me to do is meet it and knock
  out.' I said:</p>

  <p>"'If you feel you can, that's the one thing to do. It's only an obsession,
  sheer imagination. Try it tonight, anyway. If it gets a bit too thick, call
  me up on the 'phone. I'll be right here. And take plenty of good liquor.'
  When he left me he was quite his old self.</p>

  <p>"He didn't call me up until next afternoon, and then asked what I had
  heard about the specimens. I replied that what reports I had received showed
  him perfectly healthy. He said, quietly: 'I thought they would.' I asked what
  kind of a night he had had. He laughed, and said: 'A very interesting one,
  Bill. Oh, very. I followed your advice and drank plenty of liquor.' His voice
  was quite normal, even cheerful. I was relieved, yet felt a vague uneasiness.
  I asked: 'How about your shadow?' 'And plenty of shadow,' he said. 'I told
  you, didn't I, that I thought it a woman's shadow? Well, it is.' I said: 'You
  are better. Was your woman shadow nice to you?' He said: 'Scandalously so,
  and promises to be even scandalouser. That's what made the night so
  interesting.' He laughed again. And abruptly hung up.</p>

  <p>"I thought: 'Well, if Dick can joke like that about something that had him
  terrorized to the liver a day ago, he's getting over it.' That, I said to
  myself, was good advice I gave him.</p>

  <p>"Still, I felt that vague uneasiness. It grew. A little later I rang him
  up, but Simpson said he had gone out to play golf. That seemed normal enough.
  Yes&mdash;the whole trouble had been only a queer evanescent quirk that was
  righting itself. Yes&mdash;my advice had been good. What&mdash;" Bill broke
  out suddenly&mdash;"What Goddamned fools we doctors can be."</p>

  <p>I stole a look at the Demoiselle. Her great eyes were wide and tender, but
  deep within them something mocked. Bill said:</p>

  <p>"The next day I had more reports, all equally good. I called Dick up and
  told him so. I forgot to say I had also instructed him to go to Buchanan.
  Buchanan," Bill turned to de Keradel, "is the best eye man in New York. He
  had found nothing wrong, and that eliminated many possibilities of cause for
  the hallucination&mdash;if it was that. I told Dick. He said, cheerfully:
  'Medicine is a grand science of elimination, isn't it, Bill? But if after all
  the elimination you get down to something you don't know anything about
  &mdash;then what do you do about it, Bill?'</p>

  <p>"That was a queer remark. I said: 'What do you mean?' He said: 'I am only
  a thirsty seeker of knowledge.' I asked, suspiciously: 'Did you drink much
  last night?' He said: 'Not too much.' I asked: 'How about the shadow?' He
  said: 'Even more interesting.' I said: 'Dick, I want you to come right down
  and let me see you.' He promised, but he didn't come. I had a case you see
  that kept me late at the hospital. I got in about midnight and called him up.
  Simpson answered, saying he had gone to bed early and had given orders not to
  be disturbed. I asked Simpson how he seemed. He answered that Mr. Dick had
  seemed quite all right, unusually cheerful, in fact. Nevertheless, I could
  not rid myself of the inexplicable uneasiness. I told Simpson to tell Mr.
  Ralston that if he didn't come in to see me by five o'clock next day I would
  come after him.</p>

  <p>"At exactly five o'clock he arrived. I felt a sharp increase of my doubt.
  His face had thinned, his eyes were curiously bright. Not feverish&mdash;
  more as though he had been taking some drug. There was a lurking amusement in
  them, and a subtle terror. I did not betray the shock his appearance gave me.
  I told him that I had gotten the last of the reports, and that they were
  negative. He said: 'So I have a clean bill of health? Nothing wrong with me
  anywhere?' I answered: 'So far as these tests show. But I want you to go to
  the hospital for a few days' observation.' He laughed, and said: 'No. I'm
  perfectly healthy, Bill.'</p>

  <p>"He sat looking at me for a few moments silently, the subtle amusement
  competing with the terror in his over-bright eyes&mdash;as though he felt
  himself ages beyond me in knowledge of some sort and at the same time
  bitterly in fear of it. He said: 'My shadow's name is Brittis. She told me so
  last night.'</p>

  <p>"That made me jump. I said: 'What the hell are you talking about?'</p>

  <p>"He answered with malicious patience: 'My shadow. Her name is Brittis. She
  told me so last night while she lay in my bed beside me, whispering. A woman
  shadow. Naked.'</p>

  <p>"I stared at him, and he laughed: 'What do you know about the Succubae,
  Bill? Nothing, I at once perceive. I wish Alan were back&mdash;he'd know.
  Balzac had a great story about one, I remember&mdash;but Brittis says she
  really wasn't one. I went up to the library this morning and looked them up.
  Plowed through the Malleus Maleficarum-'</p>

  <p>"I asked: 'What the hell is that?'</p>

  <p>"'The Hammer Against Witches. The old book of the Inquisition that tells
  what Succubae and Incubi are, and what they can do, and how to tell witches
  and what to do against them and all of that. Very interesting. It says that a
  demon can become a shadow, and becoming one may fasten itself upon a living
  person and become corporeal&mdash;or corporeal enough to beget, as the Bible
  quaintly puts it. The lady demons are the Succubae. When one of them lusts
  for a man she beguiles him in this fashion or another until&mdash; well,
  until she succeeds. Whereupon he gives her his vital spark and, quite
  naturally, dies. But Brittis says that wouldn't be the end of me, and that
  she never was a demon. She says she was&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Dick,' I interrupted him, 'what's all this nonsense?' He repeated,
  irritably: 'I wish to God you wouldn't keep on thinking this thing is
  hallucination. If I'm as healthy as you say, it can't be-' He hesitated.
  '-But even if you did believe it real, what could you do? You don't know what
  those who sent the shadow to me know. That's why I wish Alan were here. He'd
  know what to do.' He hesitated again, then said slowly: 'But whether I'd take
  his advice... I'm not sure... now!'</p>

  <p>"I asked: 'What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>"He said: 'I'll begin from the time we agreed I'd better go home and
  fight. I went to the theater. I purposely stayed out late. There was no
  unseen whisperer at the door when I let myself in. I saw nothing as I went
  upstairs to the library. I mixed a stiff highball, sat down and began to
  read. I had turned on every light in the room. It was two o'clock.</p>

  <p>"'The clock struck the half hour. It roused me from the book. I smelled a
  curious fragrance, unfamiliar, evocative of strange images&mdash;it made me
  think of an unknown lily, opening in the night, under moon rays, in a secret
  pool, among age-old ruins encircled by a desert. I looked up and around
  seeking its source.</p>

  <p>"'I saw the shadow.</p>

  <p>"'It was no longer as though cast against curtains or walls. It stood
  plain, a dozen feet from me. Sharp cut, in the room. It was in profile. It
  stood motionless. Its face was a girl's, delicate, exquisite. I could see its
  hair, coiled around the little head and two braids of deeper shadow falling
  between the round, tip-tilted breasts. It was the shadow of a tall girl, a
  lithe girl, small-hipped, slender-footed. It moved. It began to dance. It was
  neither black nor gray as I had thought when first I saw it. It was faintly
  rosy&mdash;a rose-pearl shadow. Beautiful, seductive&mdash;in a sense no
  living woman could be. It danced, and trembled&mdash;and vanished. I heard a
  whisper: 'I am here.' It was behind me dancing&mdash;dancing... dimly I could
  see the room through it.</p>

  <p>"'Dancing,' he said, 'weaving&mdash;weaving my shroud-' he laughed. 'But a
  highly embroidered one, Bill.'</p>

  <p>"He said he felt a stirring of desire such as he had never felt for any
  woman. And with it a fear, a horror such as he had never known. He said it
  was as though a door had opened over whose threshold he might pass into some
  undreamed of Hell. The desire won. He leaped for that dancing, rosy shadow.
  And shadow and fragrance were gone snuffed out. He sat again with his book,
  waiting. Nothing happened. The clock struck three&mdash;the half-hour
  &mdash;four. He went to his room. He undressed, and lay upon the bed.</p>

  <p>"He said: 'Slowly, like a rhythm, the fragrance began. It pulsed&mdash;
  quicker and quicker. I sat up. The rosy shadow was sitting at the foot of my
  bed. I strained toward it. I could not move. I thought I heard it whisper
  &mdash;'Not yet... not yet... '"</p>

  <p>"Progressive hallucination," de Keradel said. "From sight to hearing, from
  hearing to smell. And then the color centers of the brain become involved.
  All this is obvious. Yes?"</p>

  <p>Bill paid no attention; continued: "He went to sleep, abruptly. He
  awakened next morning with a curious exaltation of spirit and an equally
  curious determination to evade me. He had but one desire&mdash;that the day
  should end so that he could meet the shadow. I asked, somewhat sarcastically:
  'But how about the other girl, Dick?'</p>

  <p>"He answered, plainly puzzled: 'What other girl, Bill?' I said: 'That
  other girl you were so much in love with. The one whose name you couldn't
  tell me.'</p>

  <p>"He said, wonderingly: 'I don't remember any other girl.'"</p>

  <p>I stole a swift glance at the Demoiselle. She was looking demurely down at
  her plate. Dr. Lowell asked:</p>

  <p>"First, he could not tell you her name because of some compulsion? Second,
  he told you he remembered nothing of her?"</p>

  <p>Bill said: "That's what he told me, sir."</p>

  <p>I saw the color drain from Lowell's face once more, and saw again a
  lightning-swift glance pass between the Demoiselle and her father.</p>

  <p>De Keradel said:</p>

  <p>"A previous hallucination negatived by a stronger one."</p>

  <p>Bill said:</p>

  <p>"Maybe. At any rate, he passed the day in a mood of mingled expectancy and
  dread. 'As though,' he told me, 'I waited for the prelude of some exquisite
  event, and at the same time as though for the opening of a door to a cell of
  the condemned.' And he was even more resolved not to see me, yet he could not
  be easy until he knew whether I had or had not found something that might
  account for his experiences. After he had talked to me he had gone out, not
  for golf as he had told Simpson, but to a place where I could not reach
  him.</p>

  <p>"He went home to dinner. He thought that during dinner he detected
  fugitive flittings from side to side, furtive stirrings of the shadow. He
  felt that his every movement was being watched. He had almost panic impulse
  to run out of the house 'while there was still time,' as he put it. Against
  that impulse was a stronger urge to stay, something that kept whispering of
  strange delights, unknown joys. He said&mdash;'As though I had two souls, one
  filled with loathing and hatred for the shadow and crying out against slavery
  to it. And the other not caring&mdash;if only first it might taste of those
  joys it promised.'</p>

  <p>"He went to the library&mdash;and the shadow came as it had come the night
  before. It came close to him, but not so close that he could touch it. The
  shadow began to sing, and he had no desire to touch it; no desire except to
  sit listening forever to that singing. He told me, 'It was the shadow of
  song, as the singer was the shadow of woman. It was as though it came through
  some unseen curtain... out of some other space. It was sweet as the
  fragrance. It was one with the fragrance, honey-sweet... and each shadowy
  note dripped evil.' He said: 'If there were words to the song, I did not know
  them, did not hear them. I heard only the melody... promising... promising...
  '</p>

  <p>"I asked: 'Promising what?'</p>

  <p>"He said: 'I don't know... delights that no living man had ever known...
  that would be mine&mdash;if..."</p>

  <p>"I asked: 'If what?'</p>

  <p>"He answered: 'I did not know... not then. But there was something I must
  do to attain them... but what it was I did not know... not then.'</p>

  <p>"Singing died and shadow and fragrance were gone. He waited a while, and
  then went to his bedroom. The shadow did not reappear, although he thought it
  there, watching him. He sank again into that quick, deep and dreamless sleep.
  He awakened with a numbness of mind, an unaccustomed lethargy. Fragments of
  the shadow's song kept whispering through his mind. He said: 'They seemed to
  make a web between reality and unreality. I had only one clear normal
  thought, and that was keen impatience to get the last of your reports. When
  you gave me them, that which hated and feared the shadow wept, but that which
  desired its embrace rejoiced.'</p>

  <p>"Night came&mdash;the third night. At dinner, he had no perception of
  lurking watcher. Nor in the library. He felt a vast disappointment and as
  vast a relief. He went to his bedroom. Nothing there. An hour or so later he
  turned in. It was a warm night, so he covered himself only with the
  sheet.</p>

  <p>"He told me: 'I do not think I had been asleep. I am sure I was not
  asleep. But suddenly I felt the fragrance creep over me and I heard a
  whisper, close to my ear. I sat up&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'The shadow lay beside me.</p>

  <p>"'It was sharply outlined, pale rose upon the sheet. It was leaning toward
  me, one arm upon the pillow, cupped hand supporting its head. I could see the
  pointed nails of that hand, thought I could see the gleam of shadowy eyes. I
  summoned all my strength and laid my hand on it. I felt only the cool
  sheet.</p>

  <p>"'The shadow leaned closer... whispering... whispering... and now I
  understood it... and then it was she told me her name... and other things...
  and what I must do to win those delights she had been promising me. But I
  must not do this thing until she had done thus and so, and I must do it at
  the moment she kissed me and I could feel her lips on mine&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"I asked, sharply: 'What were you to do?'</p>

  <p>"He answered: 'Kill myself.'"</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell pushed back his chair, stood trembling: "Good God! And he did
  kill himself! Dr. Bennett, I do not see why you did not consult me in this
  case. Knowing what I told you of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bill interrupted: "Precisely because of that, sir. I had my reasons for
  wishing to handle it alone. Reasons which I am prepared to defend before
  you."</p>

  <p>Before Lowell could answer, he went on swiftly: "I told him: 'It's nothing
  but hallucination, Dick; a phantom of the imagination. Nevertheless, it has
  reached a stage I don't like. You must take dinner with me, and stay here for
  the night at least. If you won't consent, frankly I'm going to use force to
  make you.'</p>

  <p>"He looked at me for a moment with the subtle amusement in his eyes
  intensified. He said, quietly: 'But if it's only hallucination, Bill, what
  good will that do? I'll still have my imagination with me, won't I? What's to
  keep it from conjuring up Brittis here just as well as at home?'</p>

  <p>"I said: 'All that be damned. Here you stay.'</p>

  <p>"He said: 'It goes. I'd like to try the experiment.'</p>

  <p>"We had dinner. I wouldn't let him speak again of the shadow. I slipped a
  strong sleepmaker into a drink. In fact, I doped him. In a little while he
  began to get heavy-eyed. I put him to bed. I said to myself: 'Fellow, if you
  come out of that in less than ten hours then I'm a horse doctor.'</p>

  <p>"I had to go out. It was a little after midnight when I returned. I
  listened at Dick's door, debating whether to run the risk of disturbing him
  by going in. I decided I wouldn't. At nine o'clock the next morning, I went
  up to look at him. The room was empty. I asked the servants when Mr. Ralston
  had gone. None knew. When I called up his house, the body had already been
  taken away. There was nothing I could do, and I wanted time to think. Time,
  unhampered by the police, to make some investigations of my own, in the light
  of certain other things which Ralston had told me and which I have not
  related since they are not directly related to the symptoms exhibited. The
  symptoms," Bill turned to de Keradel, "were the only matters in which you
  were interested&mdash;professionally?"</p>

  <p>De Keradel said: "Yes. But I still see nothing in your recital to warrant
  any diagnosis than hallucination. Perhaps in these details you have withheld
  I might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I had been thinking, and interrupted him rudely enough: "Just a moment. A
  little while back, Bill, you said this Brittis, shadow or illusion, or what
  not, told him that she was no demon&mdash;no Succubus. You started to quote
  him&mdash;'She said she was&mdash;' then stopped. What did she say she
  was?"</p>

  <p>Bill seemed to hesitate, then said, slowly: "She said she had been a girl,
  a Bretonne until she had been changed into&mdash;a shadow of Ys."</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle threw back her head, laughing unrestrainedly. She put a
  hand on my arm: "A shadow of that wicked Dahut the White! Alain de Carnac
  &mdash;one of my shadows!"</p>

  <p>De Keradel's face was imperturbable. He said: "So. Now do I see. Well, Dr.
  Bennett, if I accept your theory of witchcraft, what was the purpose behind
  it?"</p>

  <p>Bill answered: "Money, I think. I'm hoping to be sure soon."</p>

  <p>De Keradel leaned back, regarding Lowell almost benevolently. He said:
  "Not necessarily money. To quote Dr. Caranac, it could perhaps be only art
  for art's sake. Self-expression of a true artist. Pride. I once knew well
  &mdash;what without doubt the superstitious would have called her a witch
  &mdash;who had that pride of workmanship. This will interest you, Dr. Lowell.
  It was in Prague&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I saw Lowell start, violently; de Keradel went blandly on: "A true artist,
  who practiced her art, or used her wisdom&mdash;or, if you prefer, Dr.
  Bennett, practiced her witchcraft&mdash;solely for the satisfaction it gave
  her as an artist. Among other things, so it was whispered, she could imprison
  something of one she had killed within little dolls made in that one's image,
  animating them; and then make them do her will&mdash;" He leaned toward
  Lowell, solicitously&mdash;"Are you ill, Dr. Lowell?"</p>

  <p>Lowell was paper white; his eyes fixed on de Keradel and filled with
  incredulous recognition. He recovered himself; said in a firm voice: "A pang
  I sometimes suffer. It is nothing. Go on."</p>

  <p>De Keradel said: "A truly great&mdash;ah, witch, Dr. Bennett. Although I
  would not call her witch but mistress of ancient secrets, lost wisdom. She
  went from Prague to this city. Arriving, I tried to find her. I learned where
  she had lived, but, alas! She and her niece had been burned to death&mdash;
  with her dolls, their home destroyed. A most mysterious fire. I was rather
  relieved. Frankly, I was glad, for I had been a little afraid of the doll-
  maker. I hold no grudge against those who encompassed her destruction&mdash;
  if it were deliberate. In fact&mdash;this may sound callous but you, my dear
  Dr. Lowell, will understand I am sure&mdash;in fact, I feel a certain
  gratitude to them&mdash;if they are."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch, then spoke to the Demoiselle: "My daughter, we
  must be going. We are already late. The time has passed so pleasantly, so
  quickly&mdash;" He paused, then said with emphasis, slowly: "Had I the powers
  she had at her command&mdash;for powers she did have else I, de Keradel,
  would have felt no fear of her&mdash;I say, had I those powers, none who
  threatened me, none even who hampered me in what I had determined to do,
  would live long enough to become a serious menace. I am sure&mdash;" he
  looked sharply at Lowell, at Helen and Bill, let his pale eyes dwell for a
  moment on mine&mdash;"I am sure that even gratitude could not save them
  &mdash;nor those dear to them."</p>

  <p>There was an odd silence. Bill broke it. He said, somberly: "Fair enough,
  de Keradel."</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle arose, smiling. Helen led her to the hall. No one would
  have thought they hated each other. While de Keradel bade courteous farewell
  to Lowell, the Demoiselle drew close to me. She whispered:</p>

  <p>"I will be awaiting you tomorrow, Alain de Carnac. At eight. We have much
  to say to each other. Do not fail me."</p>

  <p>She slipped something in my hand. De Keradel said: "Soon I shall be ready
  for my greatest experiment. I look for you to witness it, Dr. Lowell. You
  too, Dr. Caranac... you... it will especially interest. Till then&mdash;
  adieu."</p>

  <p>He kissed Helen's hand; bowed to Bill. I wondered with vague misgivings
  why he had not included them in the invitation.</p>

  <p>At the door the Demoiselle turned, touched Helen lightly on the cheek. She
  said: "Some there be that shadows kiss..."</p>

  <p>Her laughter rippled like little waves as she swept down the steps after
  her father and into the waiting automobile.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07"></a>7. &mdash; THE DOLL-MAKER'S LOVER</h2>

  <p class="first">Briggs closed the door and walked away. We four stood in the
  hall, silent. Suddenly Helen stamped a foot. She said, furiously:</p>

  <p>"Damn her! She tried to make me feel like a slave girl. As if I were one
  of your lesser concubines, Alan, whom it amused your Queen to notice."</p>

  <p>I grinned, for it was almost exactly what I had thought. She said,
  viciously:</p>

  <p>"I saw her whispering to you. I suppose she was asking you to come up'n
  see her sometime." She gave a Mae West wriggle.</p>

  <p>I opened my hand and looked at what the Demoiselle had slipped into it. It
  was an extremely thin silver bracelet's half-inch band almost as flexible as
  heavy silk. Set in it was a polished, roughly oval black pebble. Incised upon
  its smoothed outer face, then filled in with some red material, was the
  symbol of the power of the ancient god of Ocean, who had many names long
  centuries before the Greeks named him Poseidon; the three-tined fork; his
  trident with which he governed his billows. It was one of those mysterious
  talismans of the swarthy little Azilian-Tardenois people who some seventeen
  thousand years ago wiped out the tall, big-brained, fair-haired and blue-eyed
  Cro-Magnons, who, like them, came from none knows where into Western Europe.
  Along the silver band, its jaws holding the pebble, was crudely cut a winged
  serpent. Yes, I knew what that pebble was, right enough. But what puzzled me
  was the conviction that I also knew this particular stone and bracelet. That
  I had seen them many times before... could even read the symbol... if only I
  could force remembrance...</p>

  <p>Perhaps if I put it around my wrist I would remember&mdash;</p>

  <p>Helen struck the bracelet from my hand. She put her heel on it and ground
  it into the rug. She said:</p>

  <p>"That's the second time tonight that she-devil has tried to snap her
  manacles on you."</p>

  <p>I bent down to pick up the bracelet, and she kicked it away.</p>

  <p>Bill stooped and retrieved it. He handed it to me and I dropped it in my
  pocket. Bill said, sharply:</p>

  <p>"Pipe down, Helen! He has to go through with it. He's probably safer than
  you and I are, at that."</p>

  <p>Helen said, passionately:</p>

  <p>"Let her try to get him!"</p>

  <p>She looked at me, grimly: "But I don't exactly trust you with the
  Demoiselle, Alan. Something rotten in Denmark there... something queer
  between you. I wouldn't hunger after that white fleshpot of Egypt if I were
  you. There've been a lot of misguided moths sipping at that flower."</p>

  <p>I flushed: "Your frankness, darling, is of your generation, and your
  metaphors as mixed as its morals. Nevertheless, you need not be jealous of
  the Demoiselle."</p>

  <p>That was a lie, of course. I felt the vague, inexplicable fear of her,
  suspicion, and a lurking, inexorable hatred&mdash;yet there was something
  else. She was very beautiful. Never could I love her in the way I could
  Helen. Still, she had something that Helen had not; something which without
  doubt was evil... but an evil I had drunk of long and long and long ago...
  and must drink of... again&mdash;and I knew a deep thirst that could be
  quenched only by that evil...</p>

  <p>Helen said, quietly:</p>

  <p>"I could not be jealous of her. I am afraid of her&mdash;not for myself
  but for you."</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell seemed to awaken. It was plain that he was sunk in his
  thoughts, he had heard none of our talk. He said:</p>

  <p>"Let us go back to the table. I have something to say."</p>

  <p>He walked to the stairs, and he walked like a man grown suddenly old. As
  we followed, Bill said to me:</p>

  <p>"Well, de Keradel was fair enough. He gave us warning."</p>

  <p>I asked: "Warning of what?"</p>

  <p>Bill answered: "Didn't you get it? Warning not to pursue the matter of
  Dick's death any further. They didn't find out all they hoped to. But they
  found out enough. I wanted them to. And I did find out what I wanted."</p>

  <p>I asked: "What was that?"</p>

  <p>"That they're Dick's murderers," he answered.</p>

  <p>Before I could ask any more questions we were seated at the table. Dr.
  Lowell rang for coffee, then dismissed the butler. He tipped a full glass of
  brandy into his coffee, and drank it. He said:</p>

  <p>"I am shaken. Undeniably I am shaken. An experience, a dreadful
  experience, which I had thought ended forever, has been reopened. I have told
  Helen of that experience. She has a strong soul, a clear brain; she is a
  bright spirit. Am I to understand&mdash;" he addressed Bill&mdash;"that Helen
  was also in your confidence this evening; that she knew in advance the facts
  that so strongly surprised me?"</p>

  <p>Bill answered: "Partly, sir. She knew about the shadow, but she didn't
  know that the Demoiselle de Keradel had an Ys pinned in her name. No more did
  I. Nor had I any cogent reason to suspect the de Keradels when they accepted
  your invitation. Before that, I did not go into the details of the Ralston
  case with you because, from the very first, I had the feeling that they would
  revive painful memories. And obviously, until de Keradel himself revealed it,
  I could have had no suspicion that he was so closely connected with the dark
  center of those memories."</p>

  <p>Lowell asked: "Did Dr. Caranac know?"</p>

  <p>"No. I had determined, whether or not my suspicions seemed to be
  warranted, to spread Dick's story before de Keradel. I had persuaded Dr.
  Caranac to anger him. I wanted to watch the reactions of himself and his
  daughter. I wanted to watch the reactions of Dr. Caranac and yourself. I hold
  myself entirely justified. I wanted de Keradel to show his hand. If I had
  laid my own hand before you, never would he have done so. You would have been
  on your guard, and de Keradel would have known it. He, also, would have been
  on guard. It was your palpable ignorance of my investigation, your
  involuntary betrayal of the horror you felt over some similar experience,
  that prompted him, contemptuous now of you, to reveal his association with
  the doll-maker and to deliver his threat and challenge. Of course, there is
  no doubt that some way, somehow, he had discovered the part you took in the
  matter of the doll-maker. He believes you are terrified to the core... that
  through fear of what may happen to Helen and me, you will force me to drop
  the Ralston matter. Unless he believed that, never would he have risked
  forearming us by forewarning."</p>

  <p>Lowell nodded: "He is right. I am frightened. We are, the three of us, in
  unique peril. But, also, he is wrong. We must go on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Helen said, sharply: "The three of us? I think Alan is in worse danger
  than any of us. The Demoiselle has her brand all ready to add him to her
  herd."</p>

  <p>I said:</p>

  <p>"Try not to be so vulgar, darling." I spoke to Lowell: "I am still in the
  dark, sir. Bill's exposition of the Ralston case was luminously clear. But I
  know nothing of this doll-maker, and therefore cannot grasp the significance
  of de Keradel's references to her. If I am to enlist in this cause,
  manifestly I should be in possession of all the facts to be truly effective,
  also, for my own protection."</p>

  <p>Bill said, grimly:</p>

  <p>"You're not only enlisted, you're conscripted."</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell said:</p>

  <p>"I will sketch them for you, briefly. Later, William, you will put Dr.
  Caranac in possession of every detail, and answer all his questions. I
  encountered the dollmaker, a Mme. Mandilip, through a puzzling hospital case;
  the strange illness and subsequent stranger death of a lieutenant of a then
  notorious underworld leader, named Ricori. Whether this woman was what is
  popularly known as a witch, or whether she had knowledge of natural laws
  which to us, solely because of ignorance, seem supernatural, or whether she
  was simply a most extraordinary hypnotist&mdash;I am still not certain. She
  was, however, a murderess. Among the many deaths for which she was
  responsible were those of Dr. Braile, my associate, and a nurse with whom he
  was in love. This Mme. Mandilip was an extraordinary artist&mdash;whatever
  else she might be. She made dolls of astonishing beauty and naturalness. She
  kept a doll-shop where she selected her victims from those who came to buy.
  She killed by means of a poisonous salve which she found means to use after
  winning the confidence of her victims. She made effigies&mdash;dolls
  &mdash;of these, in their faithful image, in faithful likeness to them. These
  dolls she then sent out on her errands of murder&mdash;animated, or at least
  so she implied, by something of the vital or, if you will, spiritual essence
  of those whose bodies they counterfeited; something that was wholly evil...
  little demons with slender stilettos... who went forth under care of a
  white-faced, terror-stricken girl whom she called her niece, subject so long
  to her hypnotic control that she had become, literally, another self of the
  doll-maker. But whether illusion or reality, of one thing there was no
  doubt&mdash;the dolls killed.</p>

  <p>"Ricori was one of her victims, but recovered under my care in this house.
  He was superstitious, believed Mme. Mandilip a witch, and vowed her
  execution. He kidnapped the niece, and in this house I placed her under my
  own hypnotic control to draw from her the secrets of the doll-maker. She died
  in this hypnosis, crying out that the doll-maker's hands were round her heart
  &mdash;strangling it..."</p>

  <p>He paused, eyes haunted as though seeing again some dreadful picture, then
  went steadily on:</p>

  <p>"But before she died, she told us that Mme. Mandilip had possessed a lover
  in Prague to whom she had taught the secret of the living dolls. And that
  same night Ricori and some of his men went forth to&mdash;execute&mdash; the
  dollmaker. She was executed&mdash;by fire. I, though against my will, was a
  witness of that incredible scene&mdash;incredible still to me although I saw
  it..."</p>

  <p>He paused, then lifted his glass with steady hand:</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems that de Keradel was that lover. It seems that beside the
  secret of the dolls, he knows the secret of the shadows&mdash;or is it the
  Demoiselle who knows that, I wonder? And what else of the dark wisdom&mdash;
  who knows? Well, that is that&mdash;and now all is to be done again. But this
  will be more difficult&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He said, musingly: "I wish Ricori were here to help us. But he is in
  Italy. Nor could I reach him in time. But his ablest man, one who passed
  through the whole experience with us, who was there at the execution, he is
  here. McCann! I'll get McCann!"</p>

  <p>He arose:</p>

  <p>"Dr. Caranac, you will excuse me? William&mdash;I leave things in your
  hands. I'm going to my study and then to bed&mdash;I am&mdash;shaken. Helen,
  my dear, take care of Dr. Caranac."</p>

  <p>He bowed and withdrew. Bill began: "Now, about the doll-maker&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was close to midnight when he had finished that story, and I had found
  no more questions to ask. As I was going out, he said:</p>

  <p>"You bowled de Keradel almost clean out when you spoke of&mdash;what was
  it&mdash;the Alkar-Az and the Gatherer within the Cairn, Alan. What the hell
  were they?"</p>

  <p>I answered:</p>

  <p>"Bill, I don't know. The words seemed to come to my lips without volition.
  Maybe they did come from the Demoiselle&mdash;as I told her father."</p>

  <p>But deep within me I knew that wasn't true&mdash;that I did know, had
  known, the Alkar-Az and its dread Gatherer&mdash;and that some day I would...
  remember.</p>

  <p>Helen said: "Bill, turn your head."</p>

  <p>She threw her arms around my neck, and pressed her lips to mine, savagely;
  she whispered: "It makes my heart sing that you are here&mdash;and it breaks
  my heart that you are here. I'm afraid&mdash;I'm so afraid for you,
  Alan."</p>

  <p>She leaned back, laughing a little: "I suppose you're thinking this is the
  precipitancy of my generation, and its morals&mdash;and maybe vulgar, too.
  But it really isn't as sudden as it seems, darling. Remember&mdash;I've loved
  you since the hornets and snakes."</p>

  <p>I gave her back her kiss. The revelation that had begun when I had met
  her, had come to complete and affirmative conclusion.</p>

  <p>As I made my way to the club, all that was in my mind was the face of
  Helen, the burnished copper helmet of her hair and her eyes of golden amber.
  The face of the Demoiselle, if I saw it at all, was nothing but a mist of
  silver-gilt over two purple splotches in a featureless white mask. I was
  happy.</p>

  <p>I started to undress, whistling, Helen's face still clear cut before me. I
  put my hand in my pocket and drew out the silver bracelet with the black
  stone. The face of Helen faded abruptly. In its place, as clearly cut, even
  more alive, was the face of the Demoiselle with her great eyes tender, her
  lips smiling&mdash;</p>

  <p>I threw the bracelet from me, as though it had been a snake.</p>

  <p>But when I went to sleep it was still the face of the Demoiselle and not
  the face of Helen that was back of my eyes.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08"></a>8. &mdash; IN DAHUT'S TOWER&mdash;NEW YORK</h2>

  <p class="first">I woke up next morning with a headache. Also, out of a dream
  which began with dolls holding foot-long needles in one hand dancing with
  pink shadows around circles of enormous standing stones, and with Helen and
  the Demoiselle alternately and rapidly embracing and kissing me. I mean that
  Helen would embrace and kiss me, and then she would fade into the Demoiselle;
  and then the Demoiselle would do the same and as quickly fade into Helen, and
  so on and so on.</p>

  <p>I remember thinking in that dream that this was quite like what occurred
  at a very unusual place of entertainment in Algiers named the "House of the
  Heart's Desire." It's run by a Frenchman, a hashish eater and also a truly
  astonishing philosopher. He and I were great friends. I won his regard, I
  think, by unfolding to him that same scheme for "Heaven and Hell, Inc." which
  had so interested the Demoiselle and de Keradel. He had quoted Omar:</p>

  <p class="poem">I sent my Soul out through the Invisible.<br>
  Some letter of that after-life to spell:<br>
  And after many days my Soul returned.<br>
  And said, "Behold, Myself am Heav'n and Hell."</p>

  <p>Then he had said my idea wasn't so original; it was really a combination
  of that quatrain and what made his place so profitable. He had a couple of
  renegade Senussi in his house. The Senussi are truly astonishing magicians,
  masters of illusion. He had a dozen girls, physically the most beautiful I've
  ever seen, and they were white and yellow and black and brown and
  intermediate shades. When one wanted to embrace "the Heart's Desire," and
  that was a most expensive undertaking, these twelve girls would stand in a
  circle, naked; a big, wide circle in a big room, hands clasped in each
  other's with their arms out at full length. The Senussi squatted in the
  center of the circle with their drums, while the aspirant for the "Heart's
  Desire" stood beside them. The Senussi drummed and chanted and did this and
  that. The girls danced, intertwining. Ever faster and faster. Until at last
  white, brown, black and yellow and intermediate seemed to coalesce into one
  supernal damsel&mdash;the girl of his dreams, as the old sentimental songs so
  quaintly put it, with trimmings of Aphrodite, Cleopatra, Phryne, and what
  not&mdash;at any rate, the girl he had always wanted whether he had realized
  it or not. So he took her.</p>

  <p>"Was she what he thought her? How do I know?" shrugged this Frenchman. "To
  me&mdash;looking on&mdash;there were always eleven girls left. But if he
  thought so&mdash;then, yes."</p>

  <p>Helen and the Demoiselle melting so rapidly into each other made me wish
  that they would coalesce. Then I'd have no bother. The Demoiselle seemed to
  stay a moment or two longer. She kept her lips on mine... and suddenly I felt
  as though I had both water and fire in my brain, and the fire was a stake
  upon which a man was bound, and the flames rushed up and covered him like a
  garment before I could see his face.</p>

  <p>And the water was a surging sea... and out upon it, pale gold hair adrift,
  wave-washed, was Dahut... eyes staring up to a sky less blue than they... and
  dead.</p>

  <p>It was then I woke up.</p>

  <p>After a cold shower I felt a lot better. While I ate breakfast, I
  marshaled the events of the night before into coherent order. First, Lowell's
  experience with the doll-maker. I knew much about the magic of the animate
  doll, which is far ahead of the simple idea of the effigy into which one
  sticks pins, or roasts at a fire or what not. Nor was I so sure that the
  hypothesis of hypnotism could account for a belief of such ancient and
  wide-spread popularity. But more ancient still, and much more sinister, was
  the shadow magic that had slain Dick. The Germans might give it the more or
  less humorous twist of Peter Schlemihl who sold his shadow to the Devil, and
  Barrie give it his own labored whimsicality of Peter Pan whose shadow was
  caught in a drawer and got torn&mdash;yet the fact remained that of all
  beliefs this of the sharing of his shadow with a man's life, personality,
  soul&mdash;whatever one may term it&mdash;was, perhaps, the most ancient of
  all. And the sacrifices and rites connected with propitiation or safety from
  shadows could parallel any for downright devilishness. I determined to go up
  to the library and look up shadow lore. I went to my room and called up
  Helen.</p>

  <p>I said: "Darling, do you know that I love you desperately?"</p>

  <p>She said: "I know that if you don't you're going to."</p>

  <p>I said: "I'm going to be tied up this afternoon&mdash;but there is
  tonight."</p>

  <p>Helen said: "I'll be waiting for you, darling. But you're not going to see
  that white devil today are you?"</p>

  <p>I answered: "I am not. I've even forgotten what she looks like."</p>

  <p>Helen laughed. My foot touched something and I looked down. It was the
  bracelet I had thrown away. Helen said: "Tonight then."</p>

  <p>I picked up the bracelet and dropped it in my pocket. I answered,
  mechanically: "Tonight."</p>

  <p>Instead of looking up shadow lore, I spent the afternoon at two unusual
  private libraries to which I have access, delving into old books and
  manuscripts upon ancient Brittany&mdash;or Armorica as it was called before
  the coming of the Romans and for five centuries thereafter. What I was
  looking for were references to Ys, and what I hoped for was to find some
  mention of the Alkar-Az and the Gatherer in the Cairn. Obviously, I must have
  read or heard those names somewhere, sometime. The only other reasonable
  explanation was that the Demoiselle had suggested them to me, and recalling
  the vividness of that vision of Carnac under the touch of her hand, I was not
  inclined to reject that. On the other hand she had denied it and I was as
  strongly disinclined to reject her denial. It had sounded like truth to me.
  Of the Alkar-Az I found no mention whatsoever. In a palimpsest of the 7th
  Century, one torn leaf, there were a few sentences that might or might not
  refer to the Gatherer. It read, translating freely the monkish Latin:</p>

  <p>"... is said that it was not because this people of Armorica took part in
  the Gaulish insurrection that the Romans treated them with such severity but
  because of certain cruel and wicked rites unparalleled in their evil by any
  tribe or people with whom the Romans had come in contact. There was one
  [several words illegible] the place of the standing stones called [two whole
  lines illegible] beating in their breasts first slowly [another lapse] until
  breast and even the heart were crushed and then when within the crypt of the
  center temple the Blackness began&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here the fragment ended. Could this "place of the standing stones" have
  been Carnac, and the "Blackness" that began "within the crypt of the center
  temple" have been the Gatherer within the Cairn? It well might be. I knew, of
  course, that the Romans had practically exterminated the primitive population
  of Armorica after that insurrection of 52 A.D., and that the survivors had
  fled from their wrath, leaving the country unpopulated until the 5th Century,
  when numbers of Celtic inhabitants of Britain, driven out by the Angles and
  Saxons, emigrated to Armorica and repopulated a great part of the peninsula.
  The Romans, taken all in all, were a broad-minded lot with the widest
  tolerance for the gods of those they conquered. Nor was it their custom to
  deal thus savagely with the conquered. What could have been these "cruel and
  wicked rites unparalleled in their evil" which had so shocked them that they
  had so ruthlessly stamped out those who practiced them?</p>

  <p>Of references to a great city which had sunk beneath the sea, I found
  many. In some it was named Ys, in others nameless. The accounts which placed
  its destruction within Christian times were clearly apocryphal. The city,
  whatever it was, belonged to prehistoric times. In almost all the references
  accent was put upon its wickedness; its prostitution to evil spirits; to
  sorcery. Largely, the legend clung closely to the resumé I had given the
  night before. But there was one variant which interested me mightily. This
  said it was a Lord of Carnac who had brought about the fall of Ys. That he
  had "beguiled Dahut the White, Daughter of the King, even as she had beguiled
  many men to their destruction." It went on to say that "so great was the
  beauty of this sorceress that not for long could the Lord of Carnac summon
  resolution to destroy her and evil Ys; and she had borne a child, a daughter;
  and when he had opened the sea gates he had fled with this child, while the
  shadows of Ys thrust him on to safety even as they thrust on the waves to
  overwhelm Dahut and her father who pursued him."</p>

  <p>That, in the light of de Keradel's theory of ancestral memories, rather
  startled me. For one thing, it gave me a clearer angle upon the Demoiselle's
  remarks about my "remembering." And it gave another explanation, though
  seemingly a preposterous one, why I had spoken those two names. If this Dahut
  came straight down from that Dahut, maybe I came straight down from the Lord
  of Carnac who had so "beguiled" her. In that event, contact might have
  started one of the de Keradel disks in my brain to action. I thought that the
  Alkar-Az and the Gatherer must have made a very strong impression upon the
  ancient Lord of Carnac, my ancestor, to cause the particular disk which
  registered them to be the first to become articulate. I grinned at the idea,
  and thought of Helen. Whatever the other memories, I remembered I had a date
  with Helen that night, and I was damned glad. I had a date with Dahut, too,
  but what of it?</p>

  <p>I looked at my watch. It was five o'clock. I pulled out my handkerchief
  and something fell tinkling to the floor. It was the bracelet, and it lay
  with the black talisman staring up at me like an eye. I stared back at it
  with that uncanny feeling of recognition of its symbol growing stronger and
  stronger.</p>

  <p>I went to the Club to dress. I had ascertained where the de Keradels were
  stopping. I sent Helen a telegram:</p>

  <p>Sorry. Unexpectedly called out of town. No time to telephone. Call you up
  tomorrow. Love and kisses.</p>

  <p>Alan.</p>

  <p>At eight I was sending my card in to the Demoiselle.</p>

  <p>It was one of those towering apartment houses overlooking the East River;
  sybaritic; their eastward and most desirable windows looking down upon
  Blackwell's Island where the outcasts, the lesser fry of criminals, those not
  worthy of Sing Sing's social life, Dannemora's austerity, or the honor of
  occupancy in similar fortresses of civilization, are penned; a catch basin
  for the dregs.</p>

  <p>The apartment houses were the Zenith complacently contemplating the
  Nadir.</p>

  <p>The elevator went up and up. When it stopped, its operator signaled, and
  after a second or two a massive door in the shaft slid aside. I stepped out
  into a hall that was like the ante-room of a medieval chamber. I heard the
  door whisper its closing, and turned. Tapestries which had been held aside by
  the women were dropping into place, hiding it. I took swift note of the
  tapestry's design, solely through force of habit&mdash;an adventurer's habit
  of studying landmarks along the path in event of forced retreat. It portrayed
  the sea-woman, the fay Melusine, being surprised by Raymond of Poitiers, her
  husband, during her weekly bath of purification. It was very ancient.</p>

  <p>The men were Bretons, swarthy, stocky, but clothed as I had never seen men
  in Brittany. They wore loose tunics of green, tight-belted and on their right
  breasts, in black, the red symbol of the bracelet's pebble. Their leg
  coverings were fawn-color, baggy, tapering below the knee and tied tightly at
  the ankle; like those of the Scythians and the old Celts. Their feet were
  sandaled. As they took my coat and hat I gave them pleasant greeting in the
  Breton&mdash;a noble's customary greeting to a peasant. They responded
  humbly, and in kind, and I saw a furtive, puzzled glance pass between
  them.</p>

  <p>They drew aside another tapestry, one pressing his hand against the wall
  as he did so. A door slid open. I passed through into a surprisingly large,
  high-ceilinged room paneled with ancient dark oak. It was dimly lit, but I
  glimpsed carven chests here and there, an astrolabe, and a great table strewn
  with leathern and vellum-covered books. I turned just in time to see the door
  slip back in place, leaving the paneling apparently unbroken. Nevertheless, I
  thought I could find it again in case of need.</p>

  <p>The two men led me across the room, toward its right hand corner. Again
  they drew a tapestry aside, and a mellow golden glow bathed me. They bowed,
  and I passed into the glow.</p>

  <p>I stood in an octagonal room not more than twenty feet across. Its eight
  sides were covered with silken hangings of exquisite texture. They were sea-
  green and woven in each was an undersea picture&mdash;fishes strangely shaped
  and colored swimming through a forest of feathery kelp... anemones waving
  deadly tentacles over mouths that were like fantastic flowers... a gold and
  silver school of winged snakes guarding their castles of royal coral. In the
  center of the room a table was set with antique crystal, translucent
  porcelain and archaic silver gleaming under the light of tall candles.</p>

  <p>I thrust my hand into the hanging by which I had entered, drew it aside.
  There was no sign of a door... I heard laughter, like the laughter of little
  ruthless waves, the laughter of Dahut...</p>

  <p>She was at the far side of the octagonal chamber, holding one of the
  hangings half aside. There was another room there, for light streamed through
  and formed a faint rosy aureole around her head. And the beauty of her made
  me for a dozen heart-beats forget everything else in the world&mdash;even
  forget that there was a world. From white shoulders to white feet she was
  draped in a web-like gown of filmy green in flowing folds like the stola of
  the women of ancient Rome. Her feet were sandaled. Two thick braids of her
  pale gold hair dropped between her breasts, and through her drapings every
  lovely line and contour were plain. She wore no jewels&mdash;nor needed any.
  Her eyes both caressed and menaced me&mdash;and there was both tenderness and
  menace in her laughter.</p>

  <p>She came toward me and put her hands on my shoulders. Her fragrance was
  like that of some strange flower of the sea, and touch and fragrance rocked
  me.</p>

  <p>She said, and in the Breton tongue:</p>

  <p>"So, Alain&mdash;you still are cautious. But tonight you go only when it
  is my will that you go. You taught me my lesson well, Alain de Carnac."</p>

  <p>I asked, stupidly, still under that numbing spell of her beauty:</p>

  <p>"When did I teach you anything, Demoiselle?"</p>

  <p>She answered:</p>

  <p>"Long... and long... and long ago." And now I thought that the menace nigh
  banished the tenderness in her eyes. The straight brows drew together in
  unbroken line. She said, absently:</p>

  <p>"I had thought that it would be easy to say that which I have to say when
  I met you tonight, Alain. I thought the words would pour from me... as the
  waters poured over Ys. But I am confused... I find it difficult... the
  memories struggle against each other... hate and love battle..."</p>

  <p>By now I had gotten myself a little in hand. I said: "I, too, am confused,
  Demoiselle. I do not speak the Breton as you and that, perhaps, is why I am
  dull to your meaning. Could we not speak French or English?"</p>

  <p>The truth was that the Breton was a little too intimate; brought me too
  close to her mind. The other languages would be a barrier. And then I
  thought: a barrier against what?</p>

  <p>She said, fiercely:</p>

  <p>"No. And no longer call me Demoiselle, nor de Keradel. You know me!"</p>

  <p>I laughed and answered:</p>

  <p>"If you are not the Demoiselle de Keradel, then you are the sea-fay
  Melusine... or Gulnar the Sea-born... and I am safe in your&mdash;" I looked
  at the hangings "&mdash;aquarium."</p>

  <p>She said, somberly: "I am Dahut... Dahut the White, Dahut of the
  Shadows... Dahut of ancient Ys. Reborn. Reborn here&mdash;" she tapped her
  forehead. "And you are Alain de Carnac, my ancient love... my great love...
  my treacherous love. So&mdash;beware."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she leaned toward me; she pressed her lips to mine, savagely; so
  savagely that her small teeth bruised them. It was not a kiss one could be
  indifferent to. My arms held her, and it was as though I held flame sheathed
  in fair flesh. She thrust me from her with what was almost a blow, and so
  strongly that I stumbled back a step.</p>

  <p>She walked to the table and filled from an ewer two slender glasses with
  pale yellow wine. She said, with mockery:</p>

  <p>"To our last parting, Alain. And to our reunion."</p>

  <p>And as I hesitated at the toast: "Don't be afraid&mdash;it is no witch's
  potion."</p>

  <p>I touched her glass and drank. We sat, and at some signal I neither saw
  nor heard, two other of the oddly dressed servants came in and served. They
  did it in the olden way, kneeling. The wines were excellent, the dinner was
  superb. The Demoiselle ate and drank daintily. She spoke little, at times
  deep in thought, at times regarding me with that blend of tenderness and
  malice. I have never dined tête-à-tête with a pretty girl and had so little
  to say&mdash;nor with one who was so silent. We were, in fact, like two
  opponents in some game upon which vital issues hung, studying our moves,
  studying each other, before beginning it. Whatever the game, I had the
  uncomfortable feeling that the Demoiselle knew much more about it than I
  &mdash;had, in all probability, made the rules.</p>

  <p>From the great room beyond the hidden door came muted music and singing.
  They were queer melodies, vaguely familiar. It was as though the singers were
  in that room, and yet far, far away. They were shadows of song and music.
  Shadows of song? Suddenly I thought of Dick's description of the singing of
  the shadow. A creep went down my spine. I looked up from my plate to find
  Dahut's gaze upon me, amused, mockery in it. I felt wholesome anger begin to
  stir in me. The lurking fear of her vanished. She was a beautiful woman, and
  dangerous. That was all. But how dangerous rested with me. I had no doubt she
  knew what I was thinking. She summoned the servants and they cleared the
  table, leaving the wine. She said, matter-of-factly: "We'll go out on the
  terrace. Bring the wine with you, Alain. You may need it. I laughed at that,
  but picked up a bottle and glasses and followed her through the hangings into
  the room of rosy light.</p>

  <p>It was her bedroom.</p>

  <p>Like the other it was octagonal, but, unlike it, the top was that of a
  true turret&mdash;that is, the ceiling did not run straight across. It lifted
  in a graceful cone. In fact, the two rooms made a double tower, and I
  surmised that the walls were false, having been built into what had been one
  large chamber. In this, they were hung with the same sea-green tapestries but
  with no figures upon them. As I walked slowly on, their hues seemed to change
  and shift, darkening here into ocean depths, lightening there into the pale
  emerald of shallows, while constantly within them moved shadows; shadowy
  shapes that floated up from the depths, then loitered, then languidly sank
  beneath the range of sight.</p>

  <p>There was a low, wide bed, an ancient armoire, a table, two or three low
  stools, a curiously carven and painted chest, a couch. The rosy light
  streamed down from some cunningly hidden fixture in the turret's roof. I felt
  again the uncomfortable sense of familiarity that had come to me when I had
  looked upon the black pebble of the bracelet.</p>

  <p>A casement opened upon the terrace. I set the wine upon the table and
  walked out upon the terrace, Dahut beside me. The tower was at the top of the
  building as I had thought, and at its southeast corner. At my right was the
  magical night panorama of New York. Far below, the East River was a belt of
  tarnished silver studded with the diamonded bands of bridges. About twenty
  feet beneath was another terrace, plain to the view since the building was of
  the step-back kind.</p>

  <p>I said to the Demoiselle, jestingly:</p>

  <p>"Is this like your tower in ancient Ys, Dahut? And was it from a balcony
  such as this that your servants hurled the lovers of whom you had tired?"</p>

  <p>This was in questionable taste, but she had invited it; and, beside, the
  inexplicable anger was growing within me. She answered:</p>

  <p>"It was not so high. Nor were the nights in Ys like these. You looked up
  into the skies to see the stars, instead of down upon the city. And my tower
  looked down upon the sea. Nor did I cast my lovers from it, since in&mdash;
  death&mdash;they served me better than in life. And not by casting them from
  any tower could I have brought that to be."</p>

  <p>She had spoken tranquilly; with evident sincerity. Whether she had spoken
  truth or not, I had then no slightest doubt that what she had spoken she
  believed to be truth. I caught her by the wrists. I said:</p>

  <p>"Did you kill Ralston?"</p>

  <p>She answered with that same tranquillity:</p>

  <p>"Why, yes."</p>

  <p>She pressed a sandaled foot on mine and leaned close to me, looking up
  into my eyes. Hot jealousy mingled with my wrath. I asked:</p>

  <p>"Had he been your lover?"</p>

  <p>She said:</p>

  <p>"He would not have been had I met you before I met him."</p>

  <p>"And those others? You killed them?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes."</p>

  <p>"And were they too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not if I had met you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My hands ached to go round her throat. I tried to drop her wrists, and
  could not. It was as though she held them, clamped. I could not move a
  finger. I said:</p>

  <p>"You are a flower of evil, Dahut, and your roots feed on hell." I said:
  "It was his money then that bought you, like any harlot?"</p>

  <p>She leaned back and laughed; and her eyes laughed and in the laughter of
  eyes and mouth was triumph. She said:</p>

  <p>"In the old days you cared nothing about lovers who had gone before. Why
  do you care now, Alain? But no&mdash;it was not his money. Nor did he die
  because he had given it to me. I was tired of him, Alain... yet I liked
  him... and Brittis had had no amusement for a long, long time, poor child...
  if I had not liked him I would not have given him to Brittis..."</p>

  <p>I came back to sanity. Undoubtedly, the Demoiselle was scoring me off for
  those suggestions of mine about her the night before. Her method might be a
  bit elaborate, but certainly it had been effective. I was more than a little
  ashamed of myself. I dropped her hands and laughed with her... but why and
  whence that anger and the devastating jealousy?</p>

  <p>I thrust that doubt aside. I said, ruefully:</p>

  <p>"Dahut, that wine of yours must have been more potent than I knew. I've
  been acting like a damned fool, and I ask forgiveness."</p>

  <p>She looked at me, enigmatically:</p>

  <p>"Forgiveness? Now&mdash;I wonder! I am cold. Let us go in."</p>

  <p>I followed her into the turreted room. Suddenly I, too, felt cold, and a
  strange weakness. I poured some wine and drank it down. I sat upon the couch.
  There was a haziness about my thoughts, as though a cold fog had gathered
  round my brain. I poured another glass of wine. I saw that Dahut had brought
  one of the stools and was sitting at my feet. In her hands was an old and
  many-stringed lute. She laughed again, and whispered:</p>

  <p>"You ask forgiveness&mdash;and you do not know what it is that you
  ask."</p>

  <p>She touched the strings and began to sing. There was something archaic
  about that song&mdash;all weird, sighing minors. I thought that I ought to
  know that song; that I did know it; had heard it often and often&mdash;in
  just such a turret as this. I looked at the walls. The hues in the hangings
  were shifting more rapidly... changing from malachite depths to pallid
  shoals. And the shadows were rising more and more rapidly; were coming closer
  and closer to the surface before they sank again...</p>

  <p>Dahut said:</p>

  <p>"You brought the bracelet I gave you?"</p>

  <p>Passively, I thrust my hand into my pocket, drew out the bracelet and gave
  it to her. She fastened it around my wrist. The red symbol on the pebble
  gleamed as though traced in lines of fire. She said:</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten I gave you that... long and long and long ago... lover
  I loved above all men... lover I have hated above all men. And you have
  forgotten the name it bears. Well, hear that name once more, Alain de
  Carnac... and remember what you ask me to forgive."</p>

  <p>She spoke a name. Hearing it, a million sparks seemed to burst in my brain
  &mdash;fireflies dissipating the cold fog that gripped it.</p>

  <p>She spoke it again, and the shadows within the green tapestries rushed to
  the surface of the waves, twined arms, locked hands...</p>

  <p>Round and round and round the walls they danced... faster and ever
  faster... shadows of women and of men. Hazily, I thought of the dancing girls
  in the "House of the Heart's Desire," dancing in a circle to the drums of the
  Senussi sorcerers... as these shadows were dancing to the luting of
  Dahut.</p>

  <p>Faster and faster the shadows spun, and then they, too, began to sing; in
  faint whispering voices, shadows of voices... and in the green tapestries the
  shifting colors became the surge and withdrawal of great waves, and the
  shadow singing became the murmuring of waves, and then their song, and then a
  clamorous shouting.</p>

  <p>Again Dahut spoke the name. The shadows sprang out of the tapestries and
  ringed me... closer and closer. The shouting of the waves became the roaring
  of a tempest, beating me down and down&mdash;out and out.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09"></a>9. &mdash; IN DAHUT'S TOWER&mdash;YS</h2>

  <p class="first">Hurricane-roaring and clamor of the sea dwindled into the
  ordered beat of great waves breaking against some barrier. I was standing at
  a window in some high place looking out over a white-capped, stormy sea. The
  sunset was red and sullen. It made a wide path of blood across the waters. I
  leaned out the window, eyes straining to the right to find something that
  ought still to be visible in the gathering dusk. I found it. A vast plain
  covered with immense upright stones, hundreds of them, marching from every
  side to a squat, rock-built temple like the hub of a gigantic wheel of which
  the monoliths were the spokes. They were so far away that they looked like
  boulders. Then suddenly by some trick of mirage they quivered and swam close.
  The rays of the dying sun painted them and they seemed splashed with blood
  and the squat temple to drip blood.</p>

  <p>I knew that this was Carnac, of which I was the Lord. And that the squat
  temple was the Alkar-Az where the Gatherer in the Cairn came at the evocation
  of Dahut the White and the evil priests.</p>

  <p>And that I was in ancient Ys.</p>

  <p>Then the mirage quivered again and was gone. The dusk blotted out Carnac.
  I looked down upon Cyclopean walls against which long combers broke,
  shouting. They were enormously thick and high here, these walls; jutting into
  the ocean like the prow of some ship of stone; they lessened as they fell
  back toward the mainland through shallows which were bare sands when the
  tides ebbed.</p>

  <p>I knew the city well. A fair city. Temples and palaces of sculptured stone
  with tiled and painted roofs red and orange and blue and green adorned it,
  and dwellings of lacquered wood utterly unlike the rude homes of my clan. It
  was filled with hidden gardens where fountains whispered and strange flowers
  bloomed. It was clustered, this city, between the wave-beaten walls as though
  the land upon which it stood was a deck of a ship and the walls the bulwarks.
  They had built it on a peninsula that stretched far out into the sea. The sea
  menaced it always, and always was held at bay by the walls, and by the
  sorcery of Ys. Out of the city ran a wide road, straight over the sands to
  the mainland, and straight to the evil heart of the circling monoliths
  &mdash;where my people were sacrificed.</p>

  <p>They who had built Ys were not my people. But it was not they who had
  raised the stones of Carnac. Our grandmothers had said their grandmothers had
  told that long and long ago the people who built Ys had come sailing in
  strangely shaped ships, fortified the neck of the peninsula and settled
  there; and now we were in thrall to them; and they had taken Carnac and on
  the trunk of its dark ritual had grafted branches that bore the fruit of
  unnameable evil. I had come to Ys to lop those branches. And if I lived
  thereafter to put ax to trunk.</p>

  <p>Bitterly did I hate these people of Ys, sorcerers and sorceresses all, and
  I had a plan to destroy them, one and all; to end the dreadful rites of the
  Alkar-Az and rid the temple forever of That which came in the wake of torment
  and death to my own people at the summoning of Dahut and the priests of Ys. I
  thought all that while knowing at one and the same time I was the Lord of
  Carnac and also Alan Caranac who had allowed himself to be caught by the
  wiles of the Demoiselle de Keradel, and was seeing only what she was willing
  him to see. At least, Alan Caranac knew that, but the Lord of Carnac did
  not.</p>

  <p>I heard the sweetness of a lute touched lightly; heard laughter like
  little heartless waves, and a voice&mdash;the voice of Dahut!</p>

  <p>"Lord of Carnac, the dusk hides your lands. And have you not looked long
  enough on the sea, beloved? Her arms are cold&mdash;mine are warm."</p>

  <p>I turned from the window, and for a moment ancient Carnac and ancient Ys
  seemed fantastic dream. For I was still in that tower from which I had
  thought the dancing shadows had thrust me. It was the same room;
  rose-lighted, octagonal, hung with the same tapestries in which green shadows
  waxed and waned; and upon a low stool sat Dahut, lute in hand, draped in the
  same sea-green web, her braids falling between her breasts.</p>

  <p>I said:</p>

  <p>"You are true a witch, Dahut&mdash;to trap me like that again." And turned
  to the window to look upon the familiar lights of New York.</p>

  <p>But that was not what I said, nor did I turn. I found myself walking
  straight toward her, and instead of the words I had thought to speak, I heard
  myself saying:</p>

  <p>"You are of the sea, Dahut... and if your arms are warmer, your heart is
  as merciless."</p>

  <p>And suddenly I knew that whether dream or illusion, this was Ys, and while
  the part of me that was Alan Caranac could see through the eyes, hear with
  the ears, and read the thought of this other part of me which was Lord of
  Carnac, I was powerless to control him and he was unaware of me. Yet I must
  abide by what he did. Something like an actor watching himself go through a
  play&mdash;but with the quite important difference that I knew neither the
  lines nor the situations. A most disturbing condition. I had a swift thought
  that Dahut ought either to have laced me under better hypnotic control or
  passed me up entirely. I felt a faint disappointment in her. That idea shot
  out of my mind like a rocket.</p>

  <p>She looked up at me, and her eyes were wet. She loosed her braids and
  covered her face with her hair and she wept behind its curtain. I said,
  coldly:</p>

  <p>"Many women have wept as you do... for men you have slain, Dahut."</p>

  <p>She said:</p>

  <p>"Since you rode into Ys from Carnac a month ago, I have had no peace.
  There is a flame in my heart that eats it. What to me or to you are the
  lovers who have gone before, since until you came never did I know love? I
  kill no more&mdash;I have banished my shadows."</p>

  <p>I asked, grimly:</p>

  <p>"What if they do not accept their banishment?"</p>

  <p>She threw back her hair; looked at me, sharply:</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>I answered:</p>

  <p>"I make serfs. I train them to serve me well and to acknowledge no other
  master. I feed and house them. Suppose, then, I feed them no longer, deny
  them shelter. Banish them. What will my hungry, homeless serfs do,
  Dahut?"</p>

  <p>She said, incredulously:</p>

  <p>"You mean my shadows may rebel against me?" She laughed, then her eyes
  narrowed, calculatingly: "Still there is something in what you say. And what
  I have made, I can unmake."</p>

  <p>I thought that a sighing went round the room, and that for an instant the
  hues in the tapestries shifted more rapidly. If so, Dahut paid no heed, sat
  pensive. She said, musingly:</p>

  <p>"After all, they do not love me&mdash;my shadows. They do my bidding
  &mdash;but they do not love me... who made them. No!"</p>

  <p>I who was Alan Caranac smiled at this, but then I reflected that the I who
  was Lord of Carnac, quite evidently took these shadows seriously,
  disconcertingly, as matter-of-fact... as Dick had!</p>

  <p>She stood up, threw white arms around my neck, and the fragrance of her
  that was like some secret flower of the sea rocked me, and at her touch
  desire flamed through me. She said, languorously:</p>

  <p>"Beloved who have swept my heart clean of all other loves... who have
  awakened me to love... why will you not love me?"</p>

  <p>I said, thickly:</p>

  <p>"I do love you, Dahut&mdash;but I do not trust you. How can I know your
  love will last... or that the time may not come when I, too, become a
  shadow... as did those others who loved you?"</p>

  <p>She answered, lips close to mine:</p>

  <p>"I have told you. I loved none of them."</p>

  <p>I said: "There was one you loved."</p>

  <p>She swayed back, looked deep into my eyes, her own sparkling:</p>

  <p>"You mean the child; you are jealous, Alain&mdash;and therefore I know you
  love me! I will send away the child. Nay&mdash;if you desire, she shall be
  slain."</p>

  <p>And now I felt cold fury stifle all desire for this woman who held life so
  lightly against passion that she would turn her hand even against the
  daughter she had borne. Ah, but that was no secret, even in Carnac. I had
  seen the little Dahut, violet-eyed, milk-white with the moonfire in her veins
  &mdash;no mistaking who had given her birth, even had her mother denied her.
  But I mastered the fury&mdash;after all, it was but what I had expected, and
  it steeled me in my determination.</p>

  <p>"No," I shook my head. "What would that mean but that you had tired of her
  &mdash;as you tired of her father&mdash;as you tired of all your lovers?"</p>

  <p>She whispered, desperately, and if I ever saw true madness of love in a
  woman's face it was there in hers: "What can I do! Alain&mdash;what can I do
  to gain your trust!"</p>

  <p>I said: "When the moon wanes, then is the feast of the Alkar-Az. Then you
  will summon the Gatherer in the Cairn&mdash;and then will many of my people
  die under the mauls of the priests and many more be swallowed by the
  Blackness. Promise me you will not summon It. Then I will trust you."</p>

  <p>She shrank away, lips white; she whispered: "I cannot do that. It would
  mean the end of Ys. It would mean the end of me. The Gatherer would summon
  me... Ask anything else, beloved... but that I cannot do."</p>

  <p>Well, I had expected her refusal; had hoped for it. I said:</p>

  <p>"Then give me the keys to the sea-gates."</p>

  <p>She stiffened; I read doubt, suspicion, in her eyes; and when she spoke,
  softness had gone from her voice. She said, slowly:</p>

  <p>"Now why do you ask for them, Lord of Carnac? They are the very sign and
  symbol of Ys. They are Ys. They were forged by the sea-god who led my
  forefathers here long and long and long ago. Never have they been in any
  hands except those of the Kings of Ys. Never may they be in any hands except
  those of a King of Ys. Why do you ask for them?"</p>

  <p>Ah&mdash;but this was the crisis. This was the moment toward which for
  long I had been working. I caught her up in my arms, tall woman that she was,
  and held her cupped in them. I pressed my lips to hers, and I felt her quiver
  and her arms lock round my neck and her teeth bruise my mouth. I threw back
  my head. I roared laughter. I said:</p>

  <p>"You yourself have said it, Dahut. I ask because they are the symbol of
  Ys. Because they are&mdash;you. Perhaps because I would hold them against any
  change of heart of yours, White Witch. Perhaps as a shield against your
  shadows. Double your guards at the sea-gates, if you will, Dahut. But&mdash;"
  again I held her close and set my mouth against hers: "I kiss you never again
  until those keys are in my hands."</p>

  <p>She said, falteringly:</p>

  <p>"Hold me so another moment, Alain... and you shall have the keys... Hold
  me... it is as though my soul were loosed from bondage... You shall have the
  keys..."</p>

  <p>She bent her head and I felt her lips upon my breast, over my heart. And
  black hate of her and red lust for her fought within me.</p>

  <p>She said: "Put me down."</p>

  <p>And when I had done this she looked at me long with soft and misty eyes;
  and she said again:</p>

  <p>"You shall have the keys, beloved. But I must wait until my father is
  asleep. I shall see to it that he goes early to sleep. And the keys of Ys
  shall be in the hands of a King of Ys&mdash;for King of Ys you shall be, my
  own dear Lord. Now wait here for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was gone.</p>

  <p>I walked to the window and looked out upon the sea. The storm had broken,
  was rising to tempest strength and the long combers were battering, battering
  at the stone prow of Ys, and I could feel the tower tremble in the blast.
  Blast and sea matched the exultation in my heart.</p>

  <p>I knew that hours had passed, and that I had eaten and had drunk. There
  was confused memory of a great hall where I had sat among gay people close to
  a dais where was the old King of Ys, and at his right Dahut, and at his left
  a white-robed, yellow-eyed priest around whose forehead was a narrow band of
  gold and at whose girdle the sacred maul with which the breasts of my own
  people were beaten in before the Alkar-Az. He had watched me, malevolently.
  And the King had grown sleepy, nodding... nodding...</p>

  <p>But now I was in Dahut's tower. The storm was stronger and so were the
  surge and beat of waves on the stone prow of Ys. The rosy light was dim, and
  the shadows in the green hangings were motionless. Yet I thought that they
  were closer to the surface; were watching me.</p>

  <p>In my hands were three slender bars of sea-green metal, strangely notched
  and serrated; upon each the symbol of the trident. The longest was three
  times the space between my index finger and wrist, the shortest the length of
  my hand.</p>

  <p>They hung from a bracelet, a thin band of silver in which was set a black
  stone bearing in crimson the trident symbol that was the summoning name of
  the seagod. They were the keys of Ys, given by the sea-god to those who had
  built Ys.</p>

  <p>The keys to the sea-gates!</p>

  <p>And Dahut stood before me. She was like a girl in her robe of white, her
  slender feet bare, hair of silvery gold flowing over exquisite shoulders and
  the rosy light weaving a little aureole around her head. I who was Alan
  Caranac thought: She looks like a saint. But I who was Lord of Carnac knew
  nothing of saints, and only thought: How can I kill this woman, evil as I
  know her to be!</p>

  <p>She said, simply: "Now can you trust, Lord of me?"</p>

  <p>I dropped the keys and set my hands on her shoulders: "Yes."</p>

  <p>She raised her lips to me, like a child. I felt pity, against all my
  knowledge of what she truly was and I against my will I felt pity for her. So
  I lied. I said: "Let the keys stay where they are, white flower. In the
  morning, before your father awakens, you shall take them back to him. It was
  but a test, sweet white flame."</p>

  <p>She looked at me, gravely:</p>

  <p>"If you wish it, so shall it be done. But there is no need. Tomorrow you
  shall be King of Ys."</p>

  <p>I felt a little shock go through me, and pity fled. If that promise meant
  anything it meant that she was going to kill her father as remorselessly as
  she had offered to kill her child. She said, dreamily:</p>

  <p>"He grows old. And he is weary. He will be glad to go. And with these keys
  &mdash;I give you all of myself. With them&mdash;I lock behind me all life
  that I have lived. I come to you&mdash;virgin. Those I have slain I forget,
  as you will forget. And their shadows shall&mdash;cease to be."</p>

  <p>Again I heard that sighing whisper go round the room, but she did not
  &mdash;or if she did, she gave it no heed.</p>

  <p>And suddenly she clasped me in her arms, and her lips clung to mine... nor
  were they virginal... and the desire of her swept like wild-fire through
  me...</p>

  <p>I had not been asleep. Knowing what I must do, I had not dared to sleep
  though sleep pressed heavy on my eyes. I had lain, listening to the breathing
  of Dahut, waiting for her to sink into deepest slumber. Yet I must have
  dozed, for suddenly I became conscious of a whispering close to my ear, and I
  knew that the whisper had not just begun.</p>

  <p>I lifted my head. The rosy light was dim. Beside me was Dahut, one white
  arm and breast uncovered, hair a silken net upon her pillow.</p>

  <p>The whispering continued; grew more urgent. I looked about the room. It
  was thronged with shadowy shapes that swayed and shifted like shadows in the
  waves. Upon the floor where I had thrown them lay the keys of Ys, the black
  pebble glimmering.</p>

  <p>I looked again at Dahut&mdash;and looked and looked again. For over her
  eyes was a shadow as though of a hand, and over her lips another such shadow,
  and upon her breast was a shadow like a hand upon her heart, and around knees
  and ankles were other shadowy hands, clasping them like fetters.</p>

  <p>I slipped from the bed; dressed swiftly and threw my cloak over my
  shoulders. I picked up the keys.</p>

  <p>One last look I took at Dahut&mdash;and almost my resolution broke. Witch
  or not&mdash;she was too fair to kill...</p>

  <p>The whispering grew fiercer; it threatened; it urged me on, implacably. I
  looked at Dahut no more&mdash;I could not. I passed out of her chamber
  &mdash;and I felt the shadows go with me, wavering before and around and
  after me.</p>

  <p>I knew the way to the sea-gates. It led through the palace, thence
  underground to the vault at the end of the prow of stone against which the
  waves were thundering.</p>

  <p>I could not think clearly&mdash;my thoughts were shadows&mdash;I was a
  shadow walking with shadows...</p>

  <p>The shadows were hurrying me, whispering... what were they whispering?
  That nothing could harm me... nothing stop me... but I must hurry...
  hurry.</p>

  <p>The shadows were like a cloak, covering me.</p>

  <p>I came upon a guard. He stood beside the passage I must take from the
  palace into the underground way. He stood there, as in dream, staring
  vacantly, staring through me, as though I, too, were but a shadow. The
  shadows whispered&mdash;"Kill." I thrust dagger through him, and went on.</p>

  <p>I came out of that passage into the ante-room of the vault of the gates.
  There was a man there, coming out of the vault. It was the white-robed priest
  with the yellow eyes. To him, at least, I was no shadow.</p>

  <p>He stared at me and at the keys I held as though I were a demon. Then he
  rushed toward me, maul upraised, lifting a golden whistle to his lips to
  summon aid. The shadows swept me forward, and before it could touch his lips
  I had thrust my dagger through his heart.</p>

  <p>And now the gate of the vault was before me. I took the smallest key, and
  at its touch in the slot that gate drew open. And again the shadows crowded
  before and around, and pushed me on.</p>

  <p>There were two guards there. One I killed before he could draw weapon. I
  threw myself on the other, throttling him before he could cry alarm.</p>

  <p>I thought that as we writhed the shadows wound themselves around him,
  smotheringly. At any rate, he soon lay dead.</p>

  <p>I went on to the sea-gates. They were of the same metal as the keys;
  immense; ten times my height at the least, twice again as wide; so massive
  that it did not seem they could have been forged by the hands of men&mdash;
  that they were indeed the gift of the sea-god as the people of Ys had told
  us.</p>

  <p>I found the slits. The shadows were whispering... first I must thrust in
  the larger key and turn... now the smaller and turn... and now I must cry out
  the name upon the pebble... once and twice and thrice... I cried that
  name...</p>

  <p>The massive valves shuddered. They began to open inward. A thin sheet of
  water hissed through the opening striking the opposite side of the vault like
  a sword.</p>

  <p>And now the shadows were whispering to me to flee... quickly...
  quickly...</p>

  <p>Before I could reach the doorway of the vault the split between the
  opening valves was a roaring cataract. Before I could reach the passage a
  wave struck me. On its crest was the body of the priest, arms stretched out
  to me as though in death he was trying to drag me down... down under the
  smother...</p>

  <p>And now I was on a horse, racing over the wide road to Carnac through the
  howling tempest. In my arms was a child, a girl whose violet eyes were open
  wide, and blank with terror. And on and on I raced, with the waves reaching
  out for me, clamoring behind me.</p>

  <p>Above the tumult of wind and waves, another tumult from Ys&mdash;the
  crashing of its temples and palaces, the rape of its sea-walls and the death-
  cry of its people blended into one sustained note of despair...</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10"></a>10. &mdash; AND OUT OF DAHUT'S TOWER</h2>

  <p class="first">I lay, eyes shut, but wide awake. I had battled back into
  this awakening, wrestling for mastery over another self that had stubbornly
  asserted its right to be. I had won, and the other self had retreated into my
  memories of Ys. But the memories were vivid and he was as strong as they; he
  was entrenched among them and he would live as long as they lived; waiting
  his chance. I was as spent as though that fight had been physical; and in my
  mind the Lord of Carnac and Alan Caranac and Dahut of ancient Ys and the
  Demoiselle de Keradel danced a witches' dance, passing in and out of each
  other, shifting from one to another&mdash;like the girls in the "House of the
  Heart's Desire."</p>

  <p>Time had passed between the moment of awakening and the moment when the
  death cry of Ys had smitten me in my flight over the sands. I knew that. But
  whether it had been minutes or millenniums I did not know. And other things
  had happened which I did not like remembering.</p>

  <p>I opened my eyes. I had thought that I had been lying on a soft bed. I was
  not. I was standing fully dressed beside a window in a room of dim rosy
  light; a room like a turret... with octagonal walls covered by sea-green
  tapestries in which furtive shadows moved. And suddenly that other self
  became alert, and I heard a far off clamor of waves racing toward me...</p>

  <p>I turned my head quickly and looked out of the window. There was no stormy
  sea, no spurning combers beating upon great walls. I looked down upon
  bridge-bound East River and the lights of New York; looked and fed upon them,
  drawing strength and sanity from them.</p>

  <p>Slowly I turned from the window. Upon the bed was Dahut. She was asleep,
  one white arm and breast uncovered and her hair a silken net upon her pillow.
  She lay there, straight as a sword, and in her sleep she smiled.</p>

  <p>No shadowy hands held her. Around her wrist was the bracelet, and the
  black stone was like an unwinking eye, watching me. I wondered whether her
  eyes under the long curling lashes were also watching me. Her breasts rose
  and fell, like the slow lift and fall of waves in a slumbering sea. Her
  mouth, with the kiss of the archaic upon her lips, was peaceful. She was like
  a soul of the sea over which tempest had passed, leaving it sleeping. She was
  very lovely... and there was desire for her in my heart, and there was fear
  of her. I took a step toward her... to kill her now while she lay asleep and
  helpless... to set my hands around her throat and choke the black life out of
  the white witch... to kill her, ruthlessly, as she had killed...</p>

  <p>I could not do that. Nor could I awaken her. The fear of her stood like a
  barrier against awakening. The desire for her stood like another barrier
  against the urge to slay her. I drew back, through the window and out upon
  the terrace.</p>

  <p>I waited there for a moment, considering, watching Dahut's chamber for any
  movement. Witchcraft might be superstition&mdash;but what Dahut had twice
  done to me measured up fully to any definition of it. And I thought of what
  had happened to Dick&mdash;and of her calm confession about that. She had
  told the truth there, whether she had brought his death about by suggestion
  or by actual shadow. My own experiences had been too similar to doubt that.
  She had killed Dick Ralston, and those other three. And how many more only
  she knew.</p>

  <p>I gave up any idea of slinking through her turret and trying to find the
  hidden door to the great room from whence had come the shadowy singing. Maybe
  the shadows wouldn't be as helpful as they had been back in ancient Ys. Also,
  there was the ante-chamber of the elevators.</p>

  <p>The truth was that the cold fear I felt of the Demoiselle seemed to
  paralyze all trust in myself. I was too vulnerable to her on her own picked
  field. And if I killed her, what possible reason could I offer? Ralston's
  death, shadows, witchcraft? The best I could expect was the madhouse. How
  could I prove such absurdities? And if I awakened her and demanded release
  &mdash;well, I couldn't see that working either. New York and ancient Ys were
  still too close together in my mind&mdash;and something whispered that the
  way I had taken in Ys was still the best way. And that was to go while she
  slept. I walked to the edge of the terrace and looked over its coping. The
  next terrace was twenty feet below. I didn't dare risk the drop. I examined
  the wall. It had bricks jutting out here and there that I thought I could
  manage. I took off my shoes and hung them around my neck by the laces. I slid
  over the coping and with an occasional slip or two I landed on the lower
  terrace. Its windows were open and there was the sound of heavy sleeping from
  within. A clock rang two and the breathing stopped. A singularly formidable
  woman came to the casements, looked out, and slammed them shut. It occurred
  to me that this was no place for a hatless, coatless, shoeless fugitive to
  ask sanctuary. So I did the same crawl down to the next terrace, and that was
  all boarded up.</p>

  <p>I climbed to the next, and that too was boarded. By this time my shirt was
  a wreck, my trousers ripped here and there, and my feet bare. I realized that
  I was rapidly getting in such shape that it would take all my eloquence to
  get away no matter what lucky break might come. I hastily slipped over the
  coping and half-slid, half-fell upon the next terrace.</p>

  <p>There was a brilliantly lighted room. Four men were playing poker at a
  table liberally loaded with bottles. I had overturned a big potted bush. I
  saw the men stare, at the window. There was nothing to do but walk in and
  take a chance. I did so.</p>

  <p>The man at the head of the table was fat, with twinkling little blue eyes
  and a cigar sticking up out of the corner of his mouth; next to him was one
  who might have been an old-time banker; a lank and sprawling chap with a
  humorous mouth, and a melancholy little man with an aspect of indestructible
  indigestion.</p>

  <p>The fat man said: "Do you all see what I do? All voting yes will take a
  drink."</p>

  <p>They all took a drink and the fat man said: "The ayes have it."</p>

  <p>The banker said: "If he didn't drop out of an airplane, then he's a human
  fly."</p>

  <p>The fat man asked: "Which was it, stranger?"</p>

  <p>I said: "I climbed."</p>

  <p>The melancholy man said: "I knew it. I always said this house had no
  morals."</p>

  <p>The lanky man stood up and pointed a warning finger at me: "Which way did
  you climb? Up or down?"</p>

  <p>"Down," I said.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "if you came down it's all right so far with us."</p>

  <p>I asked, puzzled: "What difference does it make?"</p>

  <p>He said: "A hell of a lot of difference. We all live underneath here
  except the fat man, and we're all married."</p>

  <p>The melancholy man said: "Let this be a lesson to you, stranger. Put not
  your trust in the presence of woman nor in the absence of man."</p>

  <p>The lanky man said: "A sentiment, James, that deserves another round. Pass
  the rye, Bill."</p>

  <p>The fat man passed it. I suddenly realized what a ridiculous figure I must
  make. I said: "Gentlemen, I can give you my name and credentials, which you
  can verify by 'phone if necessary. I admit, I prefer not to. But if you will
  let me get out of this place you will be compounding neither misdemeanor nor
  felony nor any other crime. And it would be useless to tell you the truth,
  for you wouldn't believe me."</p>

  <p>The lanky man mused: "How often have I heard that plea of not guilty
  before, and in precisely those phrases. Stand right where you are, stranger,
  till the jury decides. Let us view the scene of the crime, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>They walked out to the terrace, poked at the overturned plant, scanned the
  front of the building, and returned. They looked at me curiously.</p>

  <p>The lanky man said: "Either he has a hell of a nerve to take a climb like
  that to save the lady's reputation&mdash;or Daddy just naturally scared him
  worse than death."</p>

  <p>The melancholy man, James, said bitterly: "There's a way to tell if it's
  nerve. Let him stack a couple of hands against that God-damned fat
  pirate."</p>

  <p>The fat man, Bill, said, indignantly: "I'll play with no man who wears his
  shoes around his neck."</p>

  <p>The lanky man said: "A worthy sentiment, Bill. Another round on it." They
  drank.</p>

  <p>I slipped on my shoes. This was doing me good. It was about as far as
  possible from ancient Ys and the Demoiselle. I said:</p>

  <p>"Even under a torn shirt, ripped pants and footless socks a fearless heart
  may beat. Count me in."</p>

  <p>The lanky man said: "A peerless sentiment. Gentlemen, a round in which the
  stranger joins." We drank, and I needed it.</p>

  <p>I said: "What I'm playing for is a pair of socks, a clean shirt, a pair of
  pants, an overcoat, a hat and a free and unquestioned exit."</p>

  <p>The melancholy man said: "What we're playing for is your money. And if you
  lose you get out of here how you can in the clothes you've got on."</p>

  <p>I said: "Fair enough."</p>

  <p>I opened, and the lanky man wrote something on a blue chip and showed it
  to me before he tossed it into the pot. I read: "Half a sock." The others
  solemnly marked their chips and the game was on. I won and lost. There were
  many worthy sentiments and many rounds. At four o'clock I had won my outfit
  and release. Bill's clothes were too big for me, but the others went out and
  came back with what was needful.</p>

  <p>They took me downstairs. They put me in a taxi and held their hands over
  their ears as I told the taxi man where to go. That was a quartette of good
  scouts if ever there was one. When I was unsteadily undressing at the Club a
  lot of chips fell out of my pockets. They were marked: "Half a shirt": "One
  seat of pants": "A pant leg": "One hat brim": and so on and so on.</p>

  <p>I steered a wavering nor'-nor'-east course to the bed. I'd forgotten all
  about Ys and Dahut. Nor did I dream of them.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11"></a>11. &mdash; DAHUT SENDS A SOUVENIR</h2>

  <p class="first">It was different when I woke up about noon. I was stiff and
  sore and it took about three pick-me-ups to steady the floor. The memories of
  the Demoiselle Dahut and of Ys were all too acute, and they had a nightmarish
  edge to them. That flight from her tower for example. Why hadn't I stayed and
  fought it out? I hadn't even the excuse of Joseph fleeing from Potiphar's
  wife. I knew I had been no Joseph. Not that this troubled my conscience
  particularly, but the facts remained that I had made a most undignified exit
  and that each time I had met Dahut&mdash;with the problematical exception of
  Ys&mdash;she had worsted me. Both facts outraged my pride.</p>

  <p>Hell, the plain truth was that I had run away in terror and had let down
  Bill and let down Helen. At that moment I hated Dahut as much as ever had the
  Lord of Carnac.</p>

  <p>I managed a breakfast and called up Bill. Helen answered. She said with
  poisonous solicitude: "Why, darling, you must have traveled all night to get
  back so early. Where did you go?"</p>

  <p>I was still pretty edgy and I answered, curtly: "Three thousand miles and
  five thousand years away."</p>

  <p>She said: "How interesting. Not all by yourself, surely."</p>

  <p>I thought: Damn all women! and asked: "Where's Bill?"</p>

  <p>She said: "Darling, you have a guilty sound. You weren't alone, were
  you?"</p>

  <p>I said: "No. And I didn't like the trip. And if you're thinking what I'm
  thinking&mdash;yes, I'm guilty. And I don't like that either."</p>

  <p>When she spoke again, her voice had changed, filled with real concern and
  a little frightened: "You mean that&mdash;about three thousand miles and
  centuries away?"</p>

  <p>I said: "Yes."</p>

  <p>Again she was silent; then: "With the Demoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She said, furiously: "The damned witch! Oh, if you'd only been with me...
  I could have saved you that."</p>

  <p>I said: "Maybe. But not on some other night. Sooner or later it had to
  come, Helen. Why that is true I don't know&mdash;yet. But it is true." For
  suddenly I had remembered that strange thought which had come to me&mdash;
  that I had drunk of the Demoiselle's evil long and long ago&mdash;and must
  drink again, and I knew that it had been a true thought.</p>

  <p>I repeated: "It had to be. And it is done."</p>

  <p>That I knew was a lie, and so did Helen. She said, a bit piteously:</p>

  <p>"It's just begun, Alan."</p>

  <p>I had no answer to that. She said: "I'd give my life to help you,
  Alan&mdash;" Her voice broke; then, hurriedly: "Bill said to wait at the Club
  for him. He'll be there about four." She rang off.</p>

  <p>Hardly had she done so than a boy brought me a letter. On the envelope was
  a tiny imprint of the trident.</p>

  <p>I opened it. It was in the Breton:</p>

  <p class="letter">My elusive friend! Whatever I may be&mdash;I am still a
  woman and therefore curious. Are you as insubstantial as shadows? That doors
  and walls are nothing to you? You did not seem so&mdash;last night. I await
  you with all eagerness tonight&mdash;to learn.<br>
  &mdash;Dahut</p>

  <p>There was subtle threat in every line of that. Especially the part about
  the shadows. My anger rose. I wrote:</p>

  <p class="letter">Ask your shadows. Perhaps they are no more faithful to you
  now than they were in Ys. As for tonight&mdash;I am otherwise engaged.</p>

  <p>I signed it Alan Caranac and sent it off by messenger. Then I waited for
  Bill. I drew some comfort from the thought that the Demoiselle evidently knew
  nothing of how I had escaped from her turret. That, at least, meant that her
  powers, whatever they might be, were limited. Also, if those damned shadows
  had any reality except in the minds of those who strayed into her web of
  suggestion, the idea I had planted might bring about some helpful confusion
  in her menage.</p>

  <p>Promptly at four, Bill came in. He looked worried. I laid the whole thing
  before him from start to finish, not even passing up the poker party. He read
  the Demoiselle's letter and my reply. He looked up:</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you for last night, Alan. But I rather wish you had
  answered this differently."</p>

  <p>"You mean accepted it?"</p>

  <p>He nodded: "Yes, you're pretty well forewarned now. You might temporize.
  Play her along a bit... make her believe you love her... pretend you would
  like to join her and de Keradel..."</p>

  <p>"Sit in on their game?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated, then said: "For a little while."</p>

  <p>I laughed: "Bill, as for being forewarned, if that dream of Ys she
  conjured up means anything, it means Dahut is a damned sight better
  forewarned than I am. Also, much better forearmed. As for temporizing with or
  playing her&mdash;she'd see through me in no time, or her father would.
  There's nothing to do but fight."</p>

  <p>He asked: "How can you fight shadows?"</p>

  <p>I said: "It would take me days to tell you all the charms, counter-
  charms, exorcisms and whatnot that man has devised for that sole purpose Cro-
  Magnons and without doubt the men before them and perhaps even the half-men
  before them. Sumerians, Egyptians, Phoenicians, the Greeks and the Romans,
  the Celts, the Gauls and every race under the sun, known and forgotten, put
  their minds to it. But there is only one way to defeat the shadow sorcery
  &mdash;and that is not to believe in it."</p>

  <p>He said: "Once I would have agreed with you&mdash;and not so long ago. Now
  the idea seems to me to resemble that of getting rid of a cancer by denying
  you have it."</p>

  <p>I said impatiently: "If you had tried a good dose of hypnotism on Dick,
  counter-suggestion, he'd probably be alive today."</p>

  <p>He replied, quietly: "I did. There were reasons I didn't want de Keradel
  to know it. Nor you. I tried it to the limit, and it did no good."</p>

  <p>And as I digested this, he asked, slyly: "You don't believe in them, do
  you, Alan&mdash;in the shadows? I mean in their reality?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered&mdash;and wished it were the truth.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "your incredulity doesn't seem to have helped you much
  last night!"</p>

  <p>I went to the window and looked out. I wanted to tell him that there was
  another way to stop the shadow sorcery. The only sure way. Kill the witch who
  did it. But what was the use? I'd had my chance to do that and lost it. And I
  knew that if I could relive the night, I would not kill her. I said:</p>

  <p>"That's true, Bill. But it was because my disbelief was not strong enough.
  Dahut weakens it. It's why I want to keep away from her."</p>

  <p>He laughed: "I'm still reminded of the cancer patient&mdash;if he could
  only have believed strongly enough that he had none, it couldn't have killed
  him. Well, if you won't go you won't. Now I've some news for you. De Keradel
  has a big place on Rhode Island. I found out about it yesterday. It's an
  isolated spot, hell gone from nowhere and right on the ocean. He keeps a
  yacht&mdash;seagoing. He must be almighty rich. De Keradel is up there now,
  which is why you had it all to yourself with the Demoiselle. Lowell sent
  yesterday for McCann and McCann is coming in tonight to talk things over.
  It's Lowell's idea, and mine, too, to have him go up and scout around de
  Keradel's place. Find out what he can from the people about. Lowell, by the
  way, has gotten over his panic. He's rather deadly in his hatred for de
  Keradel and that includes the Demoiselle. I told you he is all wrapped up in
  Helen. Thinks of her as a daughter. Well, he seems to think that she's in
  danger."</p>

  <p>I said: "But that's a damned good idea, Bill. De Keradel spoke of some
  experiment he is carrying out. That's undoubtedly where he's working. His
  laboratory. McCann might find out a lot."</p>

  <p>Bill nodded: "Why not come up and sit in?"</p>

  <p>I was about to accept when suddenly I had the strongest feeling that I
  must not. A tingling warning of danger, like some deep hidden alarm going
  off. I shook my head: "Can't do it, Bill. I've got work to do. You can tell
  me about it tomorrow."</p>

  <p>He got up. "Thinking you might change your mind about that rendezvous with
  the Demoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"No chance," I answered. "Give my love to Helen. And tell her I don't mean
  maybe. Tell her I'm taking no more journeys. She'll understand."</p>

  <p>I did spend that afternoon working; and that night. Now and then I had an
  uncomfortable feeling that someone was watching me. Bill called up next day
  to say that McCann had gone to Rhode Island. Helen got on the 'phone and said
  she had received my message and would I come up that night. Her voice was
  warm and sweet and somehow&mdash;cleansing. I wanted to go, but that deep
  hidden alarm was shrilling, peremptorily. I apologized&mdash;rather
  awkwardly. She asked:</p>

  <p>"You haven't it in your stubborn head that you'd carry some witch taint
  with you, have you?"</p>

  <p>I said: "No. But I might carry danger to you."</p>

  <p>She said: "I'm not afraid of the Demoiselle. I know how to fight her,
  Alan."</p>

  <p>I asked: "What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>She said, furiously: "Damn your stupidity!" And hung up before I could
  speak.</p>

  <p>I was puzzled, and I was troubled. The inexplicable warning to keep away
  from Dr. Lowell's and from Helen was insistent, not to be disregarded. At
  last I threw my notes into a bag with some clothes and sought shelter in a
  little hide-away hotel I knew, after having sent Bill a note telling him
  where he could find me but warning him not to tell Helen. I said I had the
  strongest reasons for this temporary obscuration. So I had, even though I
  didn't know what they were. That was Tuesday. On Friday I went back to the
  Club.</p>

  <p>I found two notes from the Demoiselle. One must have come just after I had
  left for the hide-out. It read:</p>

  <p class="letter">There was a debt from you to me. In part, you have paid it.
  There is not nor ever was a debt from me to you. Beloved&mdash;come to me
  tonight.</p>

  <p>The other had been delivered the day after. It read:</p>

  <p class="letter">I go to join my father in his work. When next I call you,
  see to it that you come. I have sent a souvenir that you may not forget
  this.</p>

  <p>I read and re-read those notes, wondering. In the first there was appeal,
  longing; the kind of letter any woman might write to some reluctant lover. In
  the other was menace. Uneasily, I paced the floor; then called up Bill. He
  said:</p>

  <p>"So you're back. I'll be right down."</p>

  <p>He was there in half an hour. He seemed a little on edge. I asked:</p>

  <p>"Anything new?"</p>

  <p>He sat down and said casually, a bit too casually: "Well, yes. She's
  pinned one on me."</p>

  <p>I said, dumbly: "Who's done what?"</p>

  <p>He answered: "Dahut. She's pinned one of her shadows on me."</p>

  <p>My feet and hands were suddenly cold and I felt a thin cord draw tight
  around my throat. The letter in which Dahut had spoken of the souvenir she
  was sending lay open before me, and I folded it. I said:</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it, Bill."</p>

  <p>He said: "Don't look so panicky, Alan. I'm not like Dick and the others.
  It won't handle me so easily. But I'm not saying it's exactly&mdash;
  companionable. By the way, do you see something at my right? Something like a
  bit of dark curtain&mdash;fluttering?"</p>

  <p>He was keeping his eyes upon mine, but the effort of will he was making to
  do it was plain. They were a bit bloodshot. I looked, intently, and said:
  "No, Bill. I don't see a thing."</p>

  <p>He said: "I'll just shut my eyes, if you don't mind. Last night I came out
  of the hospital about eleven. There was a taxi at the curb. The driver was
  half asleep, hunched over the wheel. I opened the door and was about to get
  in when I saw someone&mdash;something&mdash;move in the far corner of the
  seat. The cab was fairly dark and I could not determine whether it was a man
  or a woman.</p>

  <p>"I said: 'Oh! I beg your pardon. I thought the taxi idle.' And I stepped
  back.</p>

  <p>"The taxi man had awakened. He touched my shoulder. He said: 'O.K. boss,
  get in. I ain't got anybody.' I said: 'Sure you have.' He flashed on the
  inside light. The cab was empty. He said: 'I been waitin' here an hour, boss,
  on a chance. Just dozin'. Nobody got in. You seen a shadow.'</p>

  <p>"I stepped into the cab and told him where to take me. We had gone a
  couple of blocks when I thought someone was sitting beside me. Close to me. I
  had been looking straight ahead and turned quickly. I caught a glimpse of
  something dark between me and the window. Then there was nothing, but I
  distinctly heard a faint rustling. Like a dry leaf being blown along a window
  in the night. Deliberately, I moved over to that side. We had gone another
  few blocks when I once more saw the movement at my left, and again there was
  a thin veil of deeper darkness between me and that window.</p>

  <p>"The outline was that of a human body. And again as it flicked out I heard
  the rustling. And in that instant, Alan, I knew.</p>

  <p>"I confess that I had a moment of pure panic. I called to the driver,
  about to tell him to take me back to the hospital. Then my nerve came back,
  and I told him to go ahead. I went into the house. I felt the shadow flitting
  with me as I entered. There was no one up. It companioned me, impalpable,
  incorporeal, glimpsed only by its movement, until I went to bed. It was with
  me through the night. I didn't steep much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes, and quickly shut them again.</p>

  <p>"I thought that like Dick's shadow it would go with the dawn. This one
  didn't. It was still there when I woke up. I waited until they'd all had
  breakfast&mdash;after all, Alan, a little playmate like that was nothing to
  introduce to the family, you know." He squinted at me sardonically. "Also
  &mdash;it has other points of difference with Dick's. I gather that Dahut
  rather favored him in that matter. I wouldn't call my pal&mdash;cozy."</p>

  <p>I asked: "It's pretty bad then, Bill?"</p>

  <p>He said: "I can get along with it&mdash;unless it gets worse."</p>

  <p>I looked at my watch. It was five o'clock. I said: "Bill, have you got de
  Keradel's address?"</p>

  <p>Bill said: "Yes," and gave it to me. I said: "Bill, don't worry any more.
  I have an idea. Forget about the shadow as much as you can. If you haven't
  anything important, go home and go to sleep. Or would you rather sleep here a
  bit?"</p>

  <p>He said: "I'd rather lie down here for a bit. The damned thing doesn't
  seem to bother me so much here."</p>

  <p>Bill lay down on the bed. I unfolded the Demoiselle's last letter and read
  it again. I called up the telegraph company and found the nearest village to
  the de Keradel place. I got the telegraph office there on the 'phone and
  asked them if there was telephone communication with Dr. de Keradel. They
  said there was, but that it was a private wire. I said that was all right, I
  only wanted to dictate a telegram to the Demoiselle de Keradel. They asked
  &mdash;"the what?" I answered "Miss de Keradel." I felt ironic amusement at
  that innocent "Miss." They said they could take it.</p>

  <p>I dictated:</p>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>YOUR SOUVENIR MOST CONVINCING, BUT EMBARRASSING. TAKE
  IT BACK AND I SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY. I'M AT YOUR COMMAND AT ANY MOMENT
  WHEN ASSURED THIS IS DONE.</tt></p>

  <p>I sat down and looked at Bill. He was asleep, but not very happily. I was
  wide awake but not very happy either. I loved Helen, and I wanted Helen. And
  I felt that what I had just done had lost Helen to me forever.</p>

  <p>The clock struck six. There was a ring on the telephone. It was long
  distance. The man to whom I had dictated the telegram spoke: "Miss de Keradel
  got the message O.K. Here's one from her. It reads: 'Souvenir withdrawn but
  returnable.' You know what it means?"</p>

  <p>I answered: "Sure." If he had expected me to go into details, he was
  disappointed. I hung up the 'phone.</p>

  <p>I went over to Bill. He was sleeping more quietly. I sat watching him. In
  half an hour he was breathing peacefully, his face untroubled. I gave him
  another hour and then awakened him.</p>

  <p>"Time to get up, Bill."</p>

  <p>He sat up and looked at me blankly. He looked around the room, and went
  over to the window. He stood there a minute or two, then turned to me.</p>

  <p>"God, Alan! The shadow's gone!"</p>

  <p>He said it like a man reprieved from death by torment.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12"></a>12. &mdash; THE VANISHING PAUPERS</h2>

  <p class="first">Well, I'd expected results, but not quite so soon nor so
  complete. It gave me a fresh and disconcerting realization of Dahut's
  powers&mdash;whether of remote control by suggestion, as the Christian
  Scientists term it, or witchcraft. Such control would in itself savor of
  witchcraft. But certainly something had happened as the result of my message;
  and by the relief Bill was showing I knew how much he had understated the
  burden of the shadow upon him.</p>

  <p>He looked at me, suspiciously. He asked: "What did you do to me while I
  was asleep?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing," I said.</p>

  <p>"What did you want with de Keradel's address?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, just curiosity."</p>

  <p>He said: "You're a liar, Alan. If I'd been myself, I'd have asked that
  before I gave it to you. You've been up to something. Now what was it?"</p>

  <p>"Bill," I said, "you're goofy. We've both been goofy over this shadow
  stuff. You don't even know you had one."</p>

  <p>He said, grimly: "Oh, I don't?" And I saw his hands clench.</p>

  <p>I said, glibly: "No, you don't. You've been thinking too much about Dick
  and de Keradel's ravings, and of what I told you of the Demoiselle's pretty
  little hypnotic experiment on me. Your imagination has gotten infected. Me
  &mdash;I've gone back to hard-headed, safe-and-sane, scientific incredulity.
  There ain't no shadow. The Demoiselle is one top-notch expert hypnotist and
  we've been letting her play us&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>He studied me for a moment: "You never were good at lying, Alan."</p>

  <p>I laughed. I said: "Bill, I'll tell you the truth. While you were asleep I
  tried counter-suggestion. Sent you deeper and deeper down until I got to the
  shadow&mdash;and wiped it out. Convinced your subconsciousness you'd never
  see it again. And you won't."</p>

  <p>He said, slowly: "You forget I tried that on Dick, and it didn't
  work."</p>

  <p>"I don't give a damn about that," I said. "It worked on you."</p>

  <p>I hoped he'd believe me. It would help build up his resistance if the
  Demoiselle tried any more of her tricks on him. Not that I was any too
  sanguine. Bill was a psychiatrist of sorts, knew far more about the quirks
  and aberrations of the human mind than I did, and if he hadn't been able to
  convince himself of the hallucinatory aspect of the shadows how could I
  expect to?</p>

  <p>Bill sat quietly for a minute or two, then sighed and shook his head:
  "That's all you're going to tell me, Alan?"</p>

  <p>"That's all I can tell you, Bill. It's all there is to tell." He sighed
  again, then looked at his watch: "Good God, it's seven o'clock!"</p>

  <p>I said: "How about staying here for dinner? Or are you busy tonight?"</p>

  <p>Bill brightened. "I'm not. But I'll have to call up Lowell." He took up
  the telephone. I said: "Wait a minute. Did you tell Lowell about my little
  party with the Demoiselle?"</p>

  <p>He said: "Yes. You don't mind, do you? I thought it might help."</p>

  <p>I said: "I'm glad you did. But did you tell Helen?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated: "Well&mdash;not everything."</p>

  <p>I said, cheerfully: "Fine. She knows what you left out. And it saves me
  the time. Go ahead and 'phone."</p>

  <p>I went downstairs to order dinner. I thought both of us were entitled to
  something extra. When I came back to the room Bill was quite excited. He
  said:</p>

  <p>"McCann is coming tonight to report. He's found out something. He'll be at
  Lowell's about nine o'clock."</p>

  <p>I said: "We'll get dinner and go up. I want to meet McCann."</p>

  <p>We had dinner. At nine o'clock we were at Lowell's. Helen wasn't there.
  She hadn't known I was coming, nor had Lowell told her about McCann. She had
  gone to the theater. I was glad of that, and sorry. A little after nine
  McCann came in.</p>

  <p>I liked McCann from the start. He was a lanky, drawling Texan. He had been
  the underworld leader Ricori's trusted bodyguard and handyman; a former
  cow-puncher; loyal, resourceful and utterly without fear. I had heard much of
  him when Bill had recounted the story of that incredible adventure of Lowell
  and Ricori with Mme. Mandilip, the doll-maker, whose lover this de Keradel
  had been. I had the feeling that McCann took the same instant liking to me.
  Briggs brought in decanters and glasses. Lowell went over and locked the
  door. We sat at the table, the four of us. McCann said to Lowell:</p>

  <p>"Well, Doc&mdash;I reckon we're headed for about the same kind of round-
  up we was last time. Only mebbe a mite worse. I wish the boss was
  around..."</p>

  <p>Lowell explained to me: "McCann means Ricori&mdash;he's in Italy. I think
  I told you."</p>

  <p>I asked McCann: "How much do you know?" Lowell answered: "Everything that
  I know. I have the utmost faith in him, Dr. Caranac."</p>

  <p>I said: "Fine." McCann grinned at me. He said:</p>

  <p>"But the boss ain't around, so I guess you'd better cable him you need
  some help, Doc. Ask him to cable these fellers&mdash;" he thrust a list of
  half a dozen names to Lowell "-an' tell 'em he wants 'em to report to me an'
  do what I say. An' ask him to take the next ship over."</p>

  <p>Lowell asked, uncertainly: "You think that is justified, McCann?"</p>

  <p>McCann said: "Yeah. I'd even go as far as to put in that cable that it's a
  matter of life an' death, an' that the hag who made dolls was just a nursery
  figure compared to the people we're up against. I'd send that cable right
  off, Doc. I'll put my name to it, too."</p>

  <p>Lowell asked again: "You're sure, McCann?"</p>

  <p>McCann said: "We're going to need the boss. I'm telling you, Doc."</p>

  <p>Bill had been writing. He said: "How's this?" He passed the paper to
  McCann. "You can put in the names of the people you want Ricori to
  cable."</p>

  <p>McCann read:</p>

  <p>Ricori. Doll-maker menace renewed worse than before. Have urgent immediate
  need of you. Ask you return at once. In meantime cable (so-and-so) to report
  to McCann and follow implicitly his orders. Cable when can expect you.</p>

  <p>"That's O.K.," McCann said. "I guess the boss'll read between the lines
  without the life and death part."</p>

  <p>He filled in the missing names and handed it to Dr. Lowell. "I'd get it
  right off, Doc."</p>

  <p>Lowell nodded and wrote an address on it. Bill ran the message off on the
  typewriter. Lowell unlocked the door and rang for Briggs; he came, and the
  message to Ricori was on its way.</p>

  <p>"I hope to God he gets it quick an' comes," said McCann, and poured
  himself a stiff drink. "An' now," he said, "I'll begin at the beginning. Let
  me tell the whole thing my own way an' if you got questions, ask them when
  I'm through."</p>

  <p>He said to Bill: "After you give me the layout, I head for Rhode Island. I
  got a sort of hunch, so I take along a big roll of bills. Most of 'em is
  phoney but imposing in the herd. An' I don't aim to dispose of the mavericks
  &mdash;just display 'em. I see by the road map there's a place called Beverly
  down that locality. It's the nearest place on the map to this de Keradel
  ranch. On beyond, it's empty country or big estates. So I head the car that
  way an' give her the spur. I get there about dark. It's a nice little
  village, old-fashioned, one street running down to the water, some stores, a
  movie. I see a shack with a sign Beverly House an' figure to bed down there
  for the night. Far as I can see de Keradel an' his gal have got to ride
  through here to get to the ranch, an' mebbe they do some buying of their
  truck here. Anyway, I'm betting that there's talk going 'round, an' if so
  then the gent that runs this Beverly House knows all of it.</p>

  <p>"So I go in an' there's an old galoot who looks like a cross between a
  goat an' a human question mark at the desk an' I tell him I'm looking for
  shelter for the night an' maybe a day or so longer. He asks if I'm a tourist,
  an' I say no, an' hesitate, an' then say I got a piece of business on my
  mind. He pricks up his ears at that, an' I say where I come from we put our
  stake on the table before we play, an' pull out the roll. He waggles his ears
  at that, an' after I've talked him down about two bits on the tariff he's not
  only plumb curious but got quite a respect for me. Which is the impression I
  want.</p>

  <p>"I go in an' have a darn good meal, and when I'm near through the old goat
  comes an' asks me how things is an' so on, an' I tell him fine an' to sit
  down. He does. We talk of this an' that, an' after a while he gets probing
  what my business is, an' we have some dam good applejack. I get confidential
  an' tell him I been nursing cows for years down Texas way, an' they've left
  me sitting mighty pretty. Tell him my grand-pap came from round these parts
  an' I've got a yearning to get back.</p>

  <p>"He asks me grand-pap's name an' I tell him Partington, an' what I'd hoped
  to do was buy back the old house, but I was too late learning it was on the
  market an' I'd found some Frenchman called de Keradel had bought it from the
  estate an' so I supposed that was out. But mebbe, I say, I could pick up a
  place near, or mebbe the Frenchman would sell me some of the land. Then I'd
  wait till mebbe this Frenchman got tired of it an' I could pick the old house
  up cheap."</p>

  <p>Bill explained to me: "This place de Keradel bought had belonged to the
  Partington family for generations. The last one died about four years ago. I
  told McCann all that. Go on, McCann."</p>

  <p>"He listened to this with a queer look on his face, half-scared," said
  McCann. "Then he opined my grand-pap must have been Eben Partington who went
  West after the Civil War, an' I said I guessed so because pap's name was
  Eben, an' he seemed to hold quite a grudge against the family an' never
  talked much about 'em, which was mainly what made me want to get hold of the
  old place. I said I thought buying it back an' living in it might rile the
  ghosts of them who kicked grand-pap out.</p>

  <p>"Well, that was a shot in the dark, but it hit the mark. The old goat gets
  more talkative. He said I was a grandson of Eben all right, for the
  Partingtons never forgot a grudge. Then he said he didn't think there was a
  chance of me getting the old place back because the Frenchman had spent a lot
  of money on it, but there was a place right close he knew of that I could get
  an' if I'd put it in his hands he'd get me the lowest price for it. Also, he
  was sure I couldn't buy in on the Partington ranch, an' with that same queer
  look said he didn't think I'd like it there if I could. An' he kept staring
  at me as though he was trying to make up his mind about something.</p>

  <p>"I said I'd set my mind on the old homestead, which I always understood
  was a pretty fairish size for the East though mebbe not so sizeable out West.
  An' I asked what was the improvements the Frenchman had put in, anyway. Well,
  the old goat got a map an' showed me the layout. It's a big chunk of land
  sticking out into the sea. There's a narrow neck about a thousand feet across
  before the land spreads out. Outside that it spreads a fantail which I
  figure's got two or three thousand acres in it.</p>

  <p>"He tells me the Frenchman's built a twenty foot high wall across that
  thousand foot neck. There's a gate in the middle. But nobody gets through it.
  Anything that goes from the village, including the mail, is took in by the
  guards. Foreigners, he says; funny little dark men who always have the money
  ready an' say nothing no way. He says they take in a lot of supplies in their
  boat. Also, they got a truck, farm, an' livestock&mdash;cattle an' sheep an'
  such, an' bosses an' a pack of big dogs. He says: 'Nobody ain't seen the
  dogs, except one man, an' he&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Then he shuts up all of a sudden as though he's saying too much an' that
  funny, scared look comes on his face. So I file that for reference but don't
  press him none.</p>

  <p>"I ask him if nobody ain't been inside an' knows what it looks like, an'
  he says: 'Nobody round here has been except the man who-' Then he shuts up
  again, so I figure he's referring to the man who seen the dogs, an' I get
  more curious about him.</p>

  <p>"I say that with all that coastline I don't see why people can't slip in
  an' look around a bit without anybody knowing. But he tells me it's all rock,
  an' only three places where you can land a boat, an' that these three places
  are guarded like the gate. He looks at me suspicious an' I say: 'Oh, yes, now
  I remember, pap told me about that.' An' I'm afraid to ask much more on that
  line.</p>

  <p>"I ask casual what other improvements there are, and he says they made a
  big rockery. I ask what anybody wants making a rockery in a place where
  nature has been so prodigal with rocks. He takes another drink an' says, this
  is a different kind of rockery, an', he says, mebbe it ain't a rockery but a
  cemetery, an' that funny scared look comes on his face plainer than ever.</p>

  <p>"We have some more applejack an' he tells me that his name is Ephraim
  Hopkins, an' he goes on to say about a month after the Frenchman moves in
  there's a couple of fishermen coming home when their kicker goes bad right
  off the point where the house stands. The Frenchman's yacht has just dropped
  her anchor an' she's lightering a lot of men to the house landing. The
  fishermen drift awhile an' while they're doing it, they figure more'n a
  hundred men must been landed.</p>

  <p>"Well, he says, about a month after that a Beverly man named Jim Taylor is
  driving along at night when his headlights pick up a feller staggering along
  the road. This man gives a yelp when he sees the lights, an' tries to run but
  he falls down. Taylor gets out an' sees he ain't got nothing on but his
  underclothes an' a pouch tied round his neck. He's fainted. Taylor picks him
  up an' totes him to this Beverly House. They pour liquor in him an' he comes
  to, but he's an Eyetalian who don't speak much English, an' he acts like he's
  scared half to death. All he wants is to get some clothes an' get away. An'
  he opens the pouch an' shows money. They get out of him that he's run off
  from this de Keradel place. Got to the water and swum till he figured he was
  past the wall, then come to land. He says he's a stone-cutter an' one of a
  big gang brought in on the boat. He says they're putting up a big rockery
  there, cutting out stones an' standing 'em up like giants' tombstones all in
  circles around a house they're building in the middle. Says these stones are
  twenty, thirty, feet high."</p>

  <p>I felt something like a cold hand pass through my hair. I said:</p>

  <p>"Say that again, McCann!"</p>

  <p>He said, patiently: "Better let me go on an' tell this in my own way,
  Doc."</p>

  <p>Bill said: "I know what you're thinking, Alan. But let McCann go on."</p>

  <p>McCann said: "The Eyetalian won't tell what scared him. Just jabbers, and
  shivers, an' keeps crossing himself. They get he's telling 'em the house in
  the middle of the stones is cursed. Tells 'em it's the Devil's house. They
  pour more liquor in him an' he says the Devil is taking his toll. Says out of
  more'n a hundred men that come with him, half have died by stones falling on
  'em. Says nobody knows where their bodies went afterwards. Says the gang was
  recruited from distant cities an' nobody knew each other. Says about fifty
  more have since been brought in. Says only men without any families were
  hired.</p>

  <p>"Then all of a sudden he gives a screech an' ducks an' covers his head
  with hands an' runs out the door an' disappears before anybody can foller.
  And two days after, says the old goat, they find him washed up on the shore
  about a mile away.</p>

  <p>"He tells me they all figure the Eyetalian's drunk or crazy. But I don't
  believe him. He looks too agitated. It don't take any eagle eye to see
  there's something queer here. He says, though, that some of the lads cruise
  around in boats trying to get a look at this rockery. But they can't see
  nothing. That don't mean it ain't there, because the rocks are steep around
  the point an' where they ain't there's big trees growing.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, they bury the Eyetalian an' pay their taxes to the poor farm with
  his money. I'm telling you about that poor farm later," said McCann.</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems to me that by then the old goat gets the sudden idea what
  he's been telling me ain't selling talk, for that place he's picked out for
  me. Anyway, be shuts up and waggles his beard and considers me. So I say that
  every word he's said only makes me more interested. Tell him there's nothing
  I like better than a good mystery, an' the more I hear him the more I yearn
  to settle right down close to a real-life one. We take another drink, an' I
  say if he can only dig up some more stuff like he's been telling me, I'm as
  good as sold. Also, I'm paying cash. Also, that tomorrow we'll go an' take a
  look at this ranch he's got in mind. I feel it's better to let all this sink
  in, so we have another drink and I go to bed. I notice he's looking at me
  darned peculiar as I go.</p>

  <p>"The next day&mdash;that's Wednesday&mdash;he's up bright an' early, pert
  an' panting. We pile into his bus an' start out. After a bit he starts
  telling me about this feller that seen the dogs. 'Lias Barton, he calls him.
  He says 'Lias is more curious than ten old maids peeking out behind the
  curtains at a house with a bride just moved in. Says curiosity is like a
  disease with 'Lias. Says he'd pull out a plug in Hell for a look in, even if
  he knew it'd squirt in his face. Well, 'Lias gets brooding and brooding over
  this wall an' what's behind it. He's been all over the old Partington place
  dozens of times an' he knows darned well what it's like, but this wall's like
  his wife putting a veil over her face sudden. He'd know he'd see the same old
  face but he'd have to lift the veil just the same. An' for the same reason
  'Lias just has to look over that wall.</p>

  <p>"He knows there ain't a chance by day, but he reconnoiters an' crawls
  around, an' at last he picks a place down near the water. Eph says there's
  breasts of rock each end of the wall into which the wall is built an' you
  can't get over 'em from the water. 'Lias figures he can row down, slip to
  land and climb the wall. So he picks a night when it's full moon but clouds
  obscuring the moon frequent. He packs a light ladder an' sculls down
  cautious. He lands an' puts up his ladder an' when the moon's under a cloud
  he swarms up. An' there he is on top the wall. He draws up the ladder an'
  flattens out an' peers round. It's 'Lias's idea to drop the ladder on the
  other side an' prospect. He waits till the moon comes; he sees it's an open
  meadow below him out again an' dotted with big bushes. He waits till another
  cloud comes an' he unslings the ladder an' starts down&mdash;</p>

  <p>"An' when he gets to this point in his story, Eph shuts up an' heads the
  bus to the side of the road where we halt. I say: 'Yeah, an' what then?' Eph
  says: 'Then we pick him up next morning rowing round and 'round the harbor
  an' crying "keep 'em off me&mdash;keep 'em off me!" 'We take him in, he says,
  an' get him calmed down some an' he tells us what I've told you.'</p>

  <p>"An' then," said McCann, "an' then&mdash;" He poured himself a drink and
  gulped it&mdash;"An' then the old goat shows he's the best liar or the best
  actor I ever rode range with. For he says after that 'Lias goes like this an'
  Eph's eyes roll an' his face twitches an' he sort of screeches&mdash;'Hear
  the piping! Oh, hear the piping like birds! Oh, God&mdash;look at 'em running
  and hiding in the bushes! Hiding and piping! God&mdash;they look like
  men&mdash;but they ain't men. Look at 'em run an' hide!...</p>

  <p>"'What's that? It sounds like a hoss... a big hoss... galloping...
  galloping! Christ! Look at her... with her hair streaming... look at the blue
  eyes an' white face of her... on the hoss... the big black hoss!</p>

  <p>"'Look at 'em run... an' hear 'em pipe! Hear 'em pipe like birds! In the
  bushes... running from bush to bush...</p>

  <p>"'Look at the dogs... they ain't dogs... Christ I keep 'em off me! Christ!
  keep 'em off me! The hounds of Hell... dear Jesus... keep 'em off me!'"</p>

  <p>McCann said: "He made me crawl. I'm telling you I'm crawling now.</p>

  <p>"Then he started the bus an' went on. I managed to ask: 'Then what?' He
  says: 'That's all. That's all we can get out of him. Ain't never been the
  same since. Mebbe he just fell off the wall an' hit his head. Mebbe so
  &mdash;mebbe not. Anyway 'Lias ain't curious no more. Goes round the village
  sort of wide-eyed an' lonesome. Get him started an' he'll do for you what I
  just did.' He cackled&mdash;'But better.'"</p>

  <p>"I said, still crawling: 'If what looked like men wasn't, an' the dogs
  that looked like dogs wasn't, then what the hell were they?'</p>

  <p>"He says: 'You know as much as I do.'</p>

  <p>"I say: 'Oh, yeah. Anyway, ain't you got any idea on who was the gal on
  the big black hoss?'</p>

  <p>"He says: 'Oh, her, sure. That was the Frenchman's gal.'</p>

  <p>Again the icy hand ruffled my hair, and my thoughts ran swiftly... Dahut
  on the black stallion... and hunting&mdash;what... and with what? And the
  upright stones and the men who had died raising them as they did of old... as
  of old in Carnac...</p>

  <p>McCann's narrative was going smoothly on. He said: "We ride along quiet
  after that. I see the old goat is pretty agitated, an' chewing his whiskers.
  We come to the place he's been telling about. We look around. It's a nice
  place all right. If I was what I say I was, I'd buy it. Old stone house, lots
  of room&mdash;for East. Furniture in it. We amble around an' after a while we
  come in sight of this wall. It's all the old goat said it was. It'd take
  artillery or TNT to knock it down. Eph mutters not to pay attention to it,
  except casual. There's big gates across the road that look like steel to me.
  An' while I don't see nobody I get the idea we're being watched all the time.
  We stroll here an' stroll there, an' then back to the other place. An' then
  the old goat asks me anxious what I think of it, an' I say it's all right if
  the price is, an' what is the price. An' he gives me one that makes me blink.
  Not because it's high but because it's so low. It gives me the glimmer of
  another idea. Nursing that idea, I say I'd like to look at some other places.
  He shows me some, but halfhearted-like an' the idea grows.</p>

  <p>"It's late when we get back to the village. On the way we run across a man
  who draws up to talk. He says to the old goat: 'Eph, there's four more gone
  from the poor farm.'</p>

  <p>"The old goat sort of jitters an' asks when. The other man says last
  night. He says the superintendent's about ready to call in the police. Eph
  sort of calculates an' says that makes about fifty gone. The other man says,
  yeah, all of that. They shake their heads an' we go on. I ask what's this
  about the poor farm, an' Eph tells me that it's about ten miles off an' that
  in the last three months the paupers have been vanishing an' vanishing. He's
  got that same scared look back, an' starts talking about something else.</p>

  <p>"Well, we get back to the Beverly House. Thar's quite a bunch of villagers
  in the front room, an' they treat me mighty respectful. I gather that Eph has
  told 'em who I'm supposed to be, an' that this is a sort of committee of
  welcome. One man comes up an' says he's glad to see me but I've been too slow
  coming home. Also, they've all got the news about these vanishing paupers,
  an' it's plain they don't like it.</p>

  <p>"I get my supper, an' come out an' there's more people there. They've got
  a sort of look of herding for comfort. An' that idea of mine gets stronger.
  It's that I've been wronging Eph in thinking all he wants is a profit from
  me. I get the flattering idea that they're all pretty plumb scared, an' what
  they think is that mebbe I'm the man who can help 'em out in whatever's
  scaring them. After all, I suppose the Partingtons in their time was big guns
  'round here, an' here I am, one of 'em, an' coming back providentially, as
  you might say, just at the right time. I sit an' listen, an' all the talk
  goes 'round the poor farm an' the Frenchman.</p>

  <p>"It gets around nine o'clock an' a feller comes in. He says: 'They picked
  up two of them missing paupers.' Everybody sort of comes close, an' Eph says:
  'Where?' An' this feller says: 'Bill Johnson's late getting in, an' he sees
  these two floaters off his bow. He hooks an' tows 'em. Old Si Jameson's at
  the wharf an' he takes a look. He says he knows 'em. They're Sam an' Mattie
  Whelan who's been at the poor farm for three years. They lay 'em out on the
  wharf. They must have drowned themselves an' been hitting up against a rock
  for God knows when, says this feller.</p>

  <p>"'What d'you mean hitting up against a rock?' asks Eph. An' the feller
  says they must have been because, there ain't a whole bone in their chests.
  Says the ribs are all smashed, an' the way it looks to him they must have
  been pounding on a rock steady for days. Like as if they'd been tied to it.
  Even their hearts are all mashed up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I felt sick&mdash;and abreast of the sickness a bitter rage; and within me
  I heard a voice crying: "So it was done in the old days... so they slew your
  people... long ago&mdash;" Then I realized I was on my feet, and that Bill
  was holding my arms.</p>

  <p>I said: "All right, Bill. Sorry, McCann," and poured myself a drink.</p>

  <p>McCann said, oddly: "Okay, Doc, you've got your reasons. Well, just then
  into the room comes a gangling sort of feller with empty eyes an' a loose
  mouth. Nobody says a word, just watches him. He comes over to me an' stares
  at me. He starts to shake, an' he whispers to me: 'She's riding again. She
  riding on the black horse. She rode last night with her hair streaming behind
  her an' her dogs around her&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Then he lets out the most God-awful screech an' starts bowing up an' down
  like a jumpin jack, an' he yells&mdash;'But they ain't dogs! They ain't dogs!
  Keep em off me! Dear Jesus... keep 'em off me!' At that there's a bunch
  around him saying 'Come along 'Lias, now come along' an' they take him out,
  still screeching. Them that's left don't say much.</p>

  <p>"They look at me solemn, an' pour down a drink or two an' go. Me&mdash;"
  McCann hesitated "&mdash;me, I'm feeling a mite shaky. If I was the old goat
  I could give you an' idea how 'Lias yelped. It was like a couple of devils
  had pincers on his soul an' was yanking it loose like a tooth. I drunk a big
  one an' started for bed. Old Eph stops me. He's putty-white an' his beard is
  quivering. He trots out another jug an' says: 'Stay up a while, Mr.
  Partington. We've an idea we'd like you to settle here with us. If that price
  don't suit you, name your own. We'll meet it.'</p>

  <p>"By that time it don't take a master-mind to tell this is a pretty well-
  scared village. An' from what I know before an' what I've heard since I don't
  blame 'em. I say to Eph: 'Them paupers? You got an idea where they're going
  to? Who's taking them?'</p>

  <p>"He looks around before he answers, then he whispers&mdash;'De
  Keradel.'</p>

  <p>"I says: 'What for?' An' he whispers: 'For his rockery.'</p>

  <p>"Earlier I might have laughed at that. But somehow now I don't feel like
  it. So I tell him I'm interested, but I got to go back to New York tomorrow
  an' think it over an' why don't they get the police to look into things. He
  says the village constable's as scared as any, an' there ain't no evidence to
  get out a search warrant, an' he's talked to a couple of country officers but
  they think he's crazy. So the next morning I check out, saying I'll be back
  in a day or two. There's quite a little delegation sees me off an' urges me
  to come back.</p>

  <p>"I'm mighty curious to see that place behind the wall, an' especially what
  Eph calls the rockery. So I run down to Providence where I've got a friend
  with a hydroplane an' we fix it to ride over the de Keradel place that night.
  We go along the coast. It's a moonlight night, an' we raise it about ten
  o'clock. I get out the glasses as we come close. We're flying about 500 feet
  up. It's clear, but there's a fog rising about this point as we get closer. A
  quick fog, too, that looks as if it's trying to beat us to it.</p>

  <p>"There's a big boat lying off the point, too, in a sort of deep cove. They
  flash searchlights up at us, whether trying to blind us or to find out who we
  are I don't know. I give my friend the office and we duck the lights. I've
  got my glasses up an' I see a long rambling stone house half hid by a hill.
  Then I see something that sort of makes me feel creepy&mdash;like old Eph's
  wailing. I don't just know why. But it's a lot of big stones all doing ring-
  around-a-rosy around a bigger gray heap of stones in the middle. The fog's
  swirling all around like snakes, an' there's lights flickering here an'
  there... gray sort of lights... rotten..."</p>

  <p>McCann stopped and lifted a drink with a none too steady hand: "Rotten
  sort of lights is right. Like they're... decaying. An' there appears to be
  something big an' black squatting on that big gray heap... without no shape
  to it... shadowy. An' it quivers an' wavers... an' the standing stones are
  like they're reaching up to pull us down to this squatting thing..."</p>

  <p>He set the glass down with a hand even less steady:</p>

  <p>"Then we're over an' zooming away. I look back an' the fog's covered
  everything."</p>

  <p>He said to Lowell: "I'm telling you, Doc, that never at no time with the
  Mandilip hag did I feel as slimy as when we flew over that place. The
  Mandilip hag had a line into Hell all right. But this is Hell itself&mdash;
  I'm telling you!"</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13"></a>13. &mdash; SUMMONS FROM DAHUT</h2>

  <p class="first">"Well, that's all." McCann lighted a cigarette and looked at
  me. "But I got the idea what I've been telling makes a lot more sense to Dr.
  Caranac than it does to me. Me&mdash;I know it's black poison. Mebbe he knows
  just how black. For instance, Doc, why'd you shy so when I made mention of
  them two paupers?"</p>

  <p>I said: "Dr. Lowell, you won't mind if I have a little talk with Bill.
  McCann, I apologize to you in advance. Bill, come over here in the corner. I
  want to whisper to you."</p>

  <p>I took Bill out of earshot, and asked: "Just how much does McCann
  know?"</p>

  <p>Bill answered: "All that we know about Dick. He knows de Keradel's
  connection with the doll-maker. And that would be enough for him, if he knew
  nothing else."</p>

  <p>"Anything about my experiences with the Demoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said Bill stiffly. "Both Lowell and myself thought too
  much of the confidential element entered into them."</p>

  <p>"That," I said, keeping solemn with an effort, "was true delicacy. But
  have you spoken to anyone except me about the shadowy visitation your
  imagination drew upon you?"</p>

  <p>Bill exclaimed: "Imagination hell! But no&mdash;I haven't."</p>

  <p>"Not even to Helen?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Fine," I said. "Now I know where I stand." I went back to the table and
  apologized again to McCann. I said to Lowell:</p>

  <p>"You remember de Keradel spoke to us of a certain experiment he
  contemplated? Its purpose the evocation of some god or demon worshiped long
  ago? Well, from McCann's story I would say that his experiment must be rather
  far advanced. He has set up the standing stones in the order prescribed by
  the ancient ritual, and he has built in their center the Great Cairn. The
  House of the Blackness. The Shrine of the Gatherer. The Alkar-Az&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lowell interrupted, eagerly: "You have identified that name? I recall that
  when first you spoke it de Keradel showed consternation. You evaded his
  questions. Did you do that to mystify him?"</p>

  <p>I said: "I did not. I still do not know how that name came into my mind.
  Perhaps from that of the Demoiselle as other things may have come later. Or
  perhaps not; the Demoiselle, you will also recall, suggested to him that I
  had&mdash;remembered. Nevertheless, I know that what he has built in the
  heart of the monoliths is the Alkar-Az. And that, as McCann truly says, it is
  black poison."</p>

  <p>McCann asked: "But the two paupers, Doc?"</p>

  <p>I said: "It may be that they were beaten by the waves against the rocks.
  But it is also true that at Carnac and at Stonehenge the Druid priests beat
  the breasts of the sacrifices with their mauls of oak and stone and bronze
  until their ribs were crushed and their hearts were pulp."</p>

  <p>McCann said, softly: "Jesus!"</p>

  <p>I said: "The stone-cutter who tried to escape told of men being crushed
  under the great stones, and of their bodies vanishing. Recently, when they
  were restoring Stonehenge, they found fragments of human skeletons buried at
  the base of many of the monoliths. They had been living men when the
  monoliths were raised. Under the standing stones of Carnac are similar
  fragments. In ancient times men and women and children were buried under and
  within the walls of the cities as those walls were built&mdash;sometimes
  slain before they were encased in the mortar and stone, and sometimes encased
  while alive. The foundations of the temples rested upon such sacrifices. Men
  and women and children... their souls were fettered there forever... to
  guard. Such was the ancient belief. Even today there is the superstition that
  no bridge can stand unless at least one life is lost in its building. Dig
  around the monoliths of de Keradel's rockery. I'll stake all I have that
  you'll discover where those vanished workmen went."</p>

  <p>McCann said: "That poor farm's on the water. It wouldn't be hard to take
  them away by boat."</p>

  <p>Lowell objected, sharply: "Nonsense, McCann! How could they be taken
  secretly? You're surely not suggesting that de Keradel could steam in, gather
  the paupers on his boat and sail away without anyone being aware of it?"</p>

  <p>McCann said, placatingly: "Well, now, Doc, there wouldn't be much of a
  trick in that. I've seen 'em snaked out of penitentiaries. Guards can always
  be fixed, you know."</p>

  <p>I said: "There are other ways. They might slip away of their own volition.
  Who knows what de Keradel might promise them&mdash;if they slipped away to
  him?"</p>

  <p>Lowell said: "But how could he get to them? How establish contact?"</p>

  <p>Bill answered, quietly: "By the shadows of Dahut!"</p>

  <p>Lowell thrust his chair back, violently. He said: "Preposterous! I
  acknowledge that such abnormal suggestion as we have been considering might
  have been effective in Ralston's case. But to assert that a collective
  hallucination could be induced which would draw away half a hundred inmates
  of&mdash;it is&mdash;preposterous!"</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway," drawled McCann, "they went."</p>

  <p>I said: "De Keradel is an enthusiast, and thorough. Like Napoleon, he
  knows that you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs; nor can you
  have meat without cattle; nor human sacrifices without humans. How did he get
  his workmen? He engaged an agent who collected men without family&mdash;and
  therefore with nobody to care whether they turned up again or did not. Also,
  they came from widely separated parts and they did not know each other. Why?
  Because that reduced to a minimum any chance of inquiry concerning them. What
  became of those who were left after they had finished his rockery! Who knows
  &mdash;and who cares? Were any of them allowed to go after they had finished
  their work? I doubt it. Otherwise, why all these peculiar precautions? Again
  &mdash;who knows and cares?"</p>

  <p>Bill said: "You mean he used them for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I interjected: "For his experiment, of course. Or as McCann's old goat put
  it&mdash;for his rockery. They were laboratory subjects. Well, the supply
  runs short. He hasn't enough. For one reason or another he doesn't want to
  bring in any more that way. Still, he must have more subjects. For a show
  such as he proposes putting on, he may need quite a crowd. Where could he get
  them with the least risk? Not by stealing them from around the countryside.
  That would raise hell. Not from a prison&mdash;because even ten men vanishing
  from a prison would raise even more hell. Also, he needs women as well as
  men. What is the least missed person in the world? A pauper. And here close
  at hand is a reservoir of them. And so&mdash;the paupers vanish."</p>

  <p>McCann said: "It listens. But what about them dogs that ain't dogs that
  sent 'Lias loco?"</p>

  <p>I thought: "Riding on her stallion black, at her feet her shadow pack-" I
  answered: "Your guess about that is as good as mine, McCann. What are you
  going to do with these men, if Ricori puts them under your command? What plan
  have you in mind?"</p>

  <p>He settled himself in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's this way. If the boss turns 'em over to me, it means he's
  going to come back. An' when the boss makes up his mind, he moves quick. Now
  these lads I named are handpicked an' none afraid of hell or its angels.
  Handy with the Tommy-guns an' what not, but they ain't a bad-looking or a
  bad-behaved lot&mdash;ordinarily. Now what I'm figuring is that if this de
  Keradel's up to the tricks we've been talking of, something's likely to
  happen that'll give us the breaks on him. I got a hunch the floating off of
  them two paupers was a mistake. He don't want nothing that'll point a finger
  at him. All right, maybe he'll make another mistake. An' we'll be there.</p>

  <p>"The Beverly people'll be damned glad to see me. I been a mite modest
  about how much they took to me. I go back with a couple of the lads an' tell
  Eph I'll try out for a bit that house he offered me. Then in a day or two the
  rest filter in, just coming up to stay with McCann for the fishing an' the
  rest. We'll fish around all right, an' sort of ride an' tramp an' scout. By
  the time the boss gets here we'll have the lay of the land. Then, after
  you've shown him, he'll tell us what to do further."</p>

  <p>Dr. Lowell said: "McCann, all of this will cost money. I cannot consent to
  it unless you permit me to defray the expenses."</p>

  <p>McCann grinned: "Don't worry about that, Doc. The house won't cost us
  nothing. Eph an' his friends'll see to that. As for the lads&mdash;well, I
  look after some things for the boss an' he's left me plenty funds. The
  boss'll pay for the party. An' should the party get rough, well&mdash;" there
  was a lawless glint in McCann's eyes "&mdash;from what you and Doc Bennett
  tell me there ought to be good pickings at the de Keradel joint."</p>

  <p>Lowell exclaimed, shocked: "McCann!"</p>

  <p>I laughed; nevertheless I studied McCann. Suddenly I had an uneasy feeling
  that he might not be so disinterested after all. Straightforward enough he
  seemed, and his story supported our every suspicion&mdash;but wasn't it just
  a little too pat? He and Ricori had been gangsters and racketeers, operating
  ruthlessly outside the law. I had no doubt that in the main his story was
  true; that he had found a village filled with fear and rumor. But this might
  be nothing more than the gossip of a small community whose curiosity and
  resentment had been aroused by being barred from a place to which they had
  enjoyed free ingress for generations. In many parts of rural New England it
  is a neighborhood affront to pull down the window shades at night. Families
  have been ostracized and preached against in the churches for doing it.
  Unless you are doing something wrong, why cover the windows so the neighbors
  can't look in? The same argument might be at the bottom of the Beverly
  unrest. Their imaginations painted what might be going on behind the de
  Keradel wall. And tale after tale would grow stronger in the telling.</p>

  <p>How easy for a quick-witted crook to take advantage of such a situation;
  bring in a gang and set up headquarters in this house between the village and
  the isolated de Keradel place. Then, on some manufactured evidence or without
  it, under pretense of ridding the villagers of their terror, with their rear
  protected by these superstitious allies, to storm the wall, raid the house
  and loot it. Its guards once overcome, there would be none to interfere.
  Perhaps McCann had information as to the extent of the "pickings" beyond
  Bill's surmises as to what had been secured from Ralston and the others.
  Perhaps he had already apprised Ricori of the opportunity, and the cable he
  had induced Lowell to send was only a blind.</p>

  <p>These thoughts ran through my mind in a fraction of the time it has taken
  to tell them. I said:</p>

  <p>"It sounds first rate. But what you need is somebody inside the place who
  will keep in touch with you."</p>

  <p>McCann said, emphatically: "That's one thing can't be done."</p>

  <p>I said: "Wrong. I know somebody who will do it."</p>

  <p>He grinned: "Yeah? Who?"</p>

  <p>I said: "Me."</p>

  <p>Lowell leaned forward, staring at me incredulously. Bill whitened, and
  little beads of sweat came out on his forehead. McCann's grin faded. He
  asked:</p>

  <p>"How you going to get in?"</p>

  <p>I said: "By the front door, McCann. I have, in fact, an invitation from
  Mademoiselle de Keradel. I've accepted it. I'm afraid I forgot to tell you
  that, Bill."</p>

  <p>Bill said, grimly: "I'm afraid you did. So... that... was why you wanted
  de Keradel's address? And that was what you did while I was asleep... and
  that was why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I said, airily: "I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about,
  Bill. The Demoiselle, no matter what else she may be, is a damned interesting
  lady. I'd been thinking over what you suggested a few days ago&mdash;about
  sitting in and so on. It just happened that the invitation came while you
  were asleep, and I immediately accepted. And that's all."</p>

  <p>He said, slowly: "And immediately the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I said, hastily: "Nothing to that, Bill. Forget it. Now as I see the
  situation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>McCann interrupted, his eyes narrowed and face hardened: "Seems to me you
  know this de Keradel gal better'n anybody told me, Dr. Caranac. Seems to me
  you know a hell of a lot you've not come clean with."</p>

  <p>I said, cheerfully: "A hell of a lot is right, McCann. And that's the way
  it stays. Take me or leave me. You'll have your gang outside the wall. I'll
  be inside. If you want me to cooperate, fine. If you don't, I'd just as soon
  play a lone hand. What are you afraid of?"</p>

  <p>He flushed, and his hands went down to his hips in a swift stiff motion.
  He drawled: "I ain't afraid&mdash;but I like to know the brand of who I work
  for."</p>

  <p>I laughed: "Take it from me, McCann, whatever it is, it's not the Double-
  Cross. But you'll have to leave it at that."</p>

  <p>Bill said, still sweating: "I can't let you do that, Alan."</p>

  <p>I said: "Listen. Either de Keradel and the Demoiselle brought about the
  suicide of Dick and the others&mdash;or they did not. If they did&mdash; they
  accomplished it by some dark knowledge they possess, or by hypnotic
  suggestion. In either case, no evidence could be brought against them that
  any court would consider. So that's out. But if de Keradel is actually
  carrying on that devilish experiment he hinted, and if he is luring, stealing
  or otherwise securing human sacrifices to complete that experiment, then he's
  leaving himself open to perfectly tangible evidence and a charge of murder.
  He's bending his neck to the noose. And so&mdash;" I winced at the thought
  "-is the Demoiselle. The only place to get that evidence is up there in Rhode
  Island. McCann's plan is good, but he's outside the wall, and he could not
  have the advantages that someone inside would have for observation. It
  happens that I am not only invited to go inside, but uniquely fitted for
  doing so&mdash;" I couldn't help giving Bill a sardonic grin at that. "Also,
  Bill, if there is danger, I have a real conviction that I run less risk by
  accepting the Demoiselle's invitation than I do by refusing it."</p>

  <p>And that was true enough, I thought. If I obeyed Dahut's summons, I'd
  probably lose Helen forever. But if I didn't&mdash;well, I would just as
  probably lose her anyway. And I didn't like to think of what might happen to
  her and to Bill in the process. At that time incredulity and absolute
  conviction of the Demoiselle's unholy powers revolved in my mind like a two-
  sailed windmill. And sometimes so fast that I found myself both believing and
  disbelieving at the same time.</p>

  <p>Bill said: "You were always a rotten bad liar, Alan."</p>

  <p>McCann stuck out his hand: "Okay, Doc, I'm sorry I said it. You don't need
  tell me nothing more. What you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>I was really moved by that. I took his hand and said: "I'm sorry, too,
  McCann."</p>

  <p>McCann asked: "What for?" I said: "For something I'd been thinking. Come
  down to the Club with me and we'll map out some line. We won't talk here
  because from now on I want Dr. Bennett to keep out of this."</p>

  <p>Bill said, hotly: "The hell I will. When McCann goes up there I go with
  him."</p>

  <p>I said: "I know what I'm talking about. I'll play this game with McCann.
  And with Ricori&mdash;if he comes over. But you're out of it, Bill. I don't
  want you even to talk to Ricori. Let Dr. Lowell do all the explaining."</p>

  <p>Bill said, stubbornly: "I go with McCann."</p>

  <p>I said: "You poor boob, do you think it's you I'm considering? It's
  Helen."</p>

  <p>He dropped at that, and again I saw his face whiten and the little beads
  of sweat come out on his forehead. He said, slowly: "So&mdash;that's it."</p>

  <p>I said: "That's exactly it. Think it over and see how right I am. Nothing
  doing, Bill. You're out."</p>

  <p>I turned to Dr. Lowell: "I have the best of reasons for what I am saying.
  I am hoping you will support me. I don't think there's much danger for you.
  But for Helen and Bill&mdash;a lot."</p>

  <p>Lowell said, very gravely: "I understand you, Alan. I will not fail
  you."</p>

  <p>I got up; I looked at Bill and laughed. I said: "You've the look of
  somebody who sees his best friend pacing from the condemned cell toward that
  Little Green Door from which none returneth. It's nothing of the sort, Bill.
  I'm going to visit a charming lady and her perhaps insane but nevertheless
  brilliant father. I expect to have a most interesting time. And if papa gets
  too crazy I have McCann to fall back on. If I want you, I'll call on you.
  There are mails and telephone. Come on, McCann."</p>

  <p>We went down, the four of us, to the hall. I said: "Also, Bill, don't tell
  Helen anything about this until I give you the word."</p>

  <p>And just then the door opened and Helen came in.</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened, and she looked distressed and she said: "Hello, darling.
  Why didn't somebody tell me you were coming tonight? I'd not have gone
  out."</p>

  <p>She put her arms around my neck and kissed me. Her lips were soft and
  warm, and there was a fragrance about her&mdash;not like some unknown sea-
  bloom but flowers blossoming on a breast of earth.</p>

  <p>I said: "I didn't know it myself until after you'd gone, angel."</p>

  <p>She said: "Well, you're coming right back. I've a lot to talk to you
  about."</p>

  <p>I wanted to be with Helen, right enough&mdash;but some way, tonight, I
  didn't want to talk to her. I cast an involuntary glance of appeal at
  McCann.</p>

  <p>McCann caught it. He said: "Sorry, Miss Helen, but we got to get right
  out."</p>

  <p>Helen looked at him: "Hello, McCann. I didn't notice you. What are you
  going to do with this man of mine?"</p>

  <p>"Anything you say, Miss Helen." McCann was grinning, but I had the idea he
  was speaking absolute truth, and that whatever Helen ordered he would
  certainly do his best to accomplish.</p>

  <p>Bill said: "Alan has to go, Helen."</p>

  <p>She took off her hat and smoothed the copper helmet of her hair. She
  asked, quietly: "The de Keradel affair, Alan?"</p>

  <p>I nodded and she went a little white. I said: "It's nothing very
  important, but, honestly, I can't stay. Let's make a day of it tomorrow,
  Helen. Meet me at Marguens and take lunch. Then we'll ride around a bit and
  get supper and go to some show or other. I haven't been to a theater for
  three years."</p>

  <p>She looked at me for a long minute or two, then rested her hands on my
  shoulders: "All right, Alan. I'll meet you there&mdash;at two. But&mdash; be
  there."</p>

  <p>As I went out I swore to myself that come hell or highwater, I'd be there.
  Summons from Dahut notwithstanding. If Bill had to entertain one of her
  shadows for a few hours&mdash;well, he'd have to stand it. Down at the Club,
  McCann and I had a few drinks and I told him a few more things. I said I
  thought both de Keradel and his daughter were a bit crazy, and the reason I'd
  been invited down was because she had a wild idea we'd been in love with each
  other a few thousand years ago. He listened, silently. When I was done, he
  said: "The shadders, Doc. You think they're real?"</p>

  <p>I said: "I don't see how they can be. But certainly the people who see
  them think they are."</p>

  <p>He nodded, absently: "Well, they got to be treated as if they're real. But
  how can you put the heat on a shadder? The people responsible for 'em are
  real, though. An' you can always put the heat on them."</p>

  <p>He said, shrewdly:</p>

  <p>"This de Keradel gal, now. How do you feel about her? I hear she's mighty
  ornamental. Feel safe&mdash;going down there?"</p>

  <p>I flushed at that; I said, coldly: "When I need a guardian, McCann, I'll
  let you know."</p>

  <p>He answered as coldly: "I didn't mean it that way. Only&mdash;I ain't
  aiming to see Miss Helen get any crooked deal."</p>

  <p>That stung me; I began, unthinkingly: "If it wasn't for Miss Helen&mdash;"
  then shut up. He leaned over toward me, his eyes less hard:</p>

  <p>"I thought so. You're scared for Miss Helen. That's why you're going. But
  mebbe that ain't just the way to protect her."</p>

  <p>I said: "All right, McCann, tell me a better."</p>

  <p>He said: "Why not leave it to me an' the hands?"</p>

  <p>"I know what I'm about, McCann," I told him.</p>

  <p>He sighed and got up: "Well, soon's we hear from the boss you an' me's got
  to get together on signals an' how to meet down there. There'll be boats
  fishing at the end of the walls, for one thing. When do you figure on
  visiting?"</p>

  <p>"When I'm sent for."</p>

  <p>He sighed again, shook my hand solemnly, and left. I went to bed, and
  slept soundly. The next morning at nine Bill called me up to say that Ricori
  had cabled the necessary instructions and that he was flying from Genoa to
  Paris that day to catch the Mauretania and would be in New York in a week.
  McCann 'phoned the same news, and we made an engagement for that midnight to
  go over details of our team work.</p>

  <p>I spent a gorgeous day with Helen. I met her at Marguens and said: "This
  day is yours and mine, darling. We're not going to think about anything else.
  To hell with the de Keradels. This is the last mention of them."</p>

  <p>She said, sweetly: "To hell with them suits me perfectly, darling."</p>

  <p>It was, as I have said, a gorgeous day, and long before it was over I knew
  just how much I was in love with her; how utterly lovely and desirable she
  was. Every time the thought of the Demoiselle crept out of the far corner of
  my mind into which I had thrust her, I pushed her back with a pang of hatred.
  At half-past eleven I bade good-by to Helen at Lowell's door. I asked: "How
  about tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>She said: "All right&mdash;if you can."</p>

  <p>I asked: "Why the devil couldn't I?"</p>

  <p>She said: "This day's over, Alan. You'll not be rid of Dahut so easily." I
  started to answer; she stopped me: "You don't know how much I love you.
  Promise me&mdash;if you need me... come to me... at any time... in any
  shape!"</p>

  <p>I caught her in my arms: "In any shape&mdash;what the devil do you mean by
  that?"</p>

  <p>She drew my head down, pressed her lips to mine&mdash;savagely, tenderly,
  passionately all in one for long. She thrust me from her and I saw that she
  was crying. She threw open the door, then turned for a moment:</p>

  <p>"You don't know how much I love you!"</p>

  <p>She closed the door. I went down to the waiting cab and rode to the Club,
  cursing the Demoiselle more comprehensively than I had since ancient Ys
  &mdash;if and when that had been. McCann hadn't arrived, but a telegram had.
  It was from Dahut and read:</p>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>THE YACHT WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE LARCHMONT
  CLUB AT NOON TOMORROW. HER NAME IS BRITTIS. I WILL MEET YOU. SINCERELY HOPE
  YOU WILL COME PREPARED FOR INDEFINITE STAY.</tt></p>

  <p>Well&mdash;that was that. I did not miss the nuance of the name, nor the
  mockery in that "indefinite stay." Helen was reality, and Dahut was shadow.
  But I knew that now shadow had become the true reality. With a sinking of the
  heart; with forebodings against which I raged, impotently; with sorrow for
  Helen as though I were bidding her farewell forever; with cold hatred against
  this woman who was contemptuously summoning me&mdash;I knew I could do
  nothing but obey her.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14"></a>14. &mdash; BEHIND DE KERADEL'S WALL</h2>

  <p class="first">I had one of my valises packed when McCann was announced. He
  squinted at it with surprise: "You ain't going away tonight, Doc?"</p>

  <p>With sudden impulse toward frankness, I pushed over to him the
  Demoiselle's telegram. He read it stolidly; looked up: "This just come?
  Thought you told Doc Bennett you'd already had an invitation."</p>

  <p>"This," I explained patiently, "is merely a confirmation of an engagement
  previously made, setting a definite time for one left indefinite before as
  you will see if you read it over again carefully." I began to pack the other
  valise. McCann reread the telegram, watched me silently for a while, then
  said mildly:</p>

  <p>"Doc Bennett had one of them shadders trailing him, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>I turned to him sharply: "What makes you think that?"</p>

  <p>He went on, as though he had not heard me: "An' he lost it down here with
  you, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"McCann," I said, "you're crazy. What gave you that idea?"</p>

  <p>He sighed, and said: "When you an' him was arguing tonight about you going
  down an' setting in with this de Keradel, I got a mite puzzled. But when I
  see this telegram, I ain't puzzled no more. I get the answer."</p>

  <p>"Fine," I said, and resumed packing. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>He said: "You traded something for Doc Bennett's shadder."</p>

  <p>I looked at him and laughed: "You've grand ideas, McCann. What have I to
  trade, and with whom and for what?"</p>

  <p>McCann sighed again, and put a finger on the Demoiselle's name: "With
  her&mdash;" He pointed to the "indefinite stay" and said: "An' you traded
  this for his shadder."</p>

  <p>"McCann," I went over to him. "He did think a shadow was following him.
  But that may have been only because he has been thinking too much about this
  whole queer matter. And he has much the same idea as you about how be was
  relieved of the obsession. I want you to promise me that you will say nothing
  of your own suspicions to him&mdash;and especially nothing to Miss Helen. If
  one or the other should speak to you about it, do your best to discourage the
  notion. I have good reasons for asking this&mdash;believe me I have. Will you
  promise?"</p>

  <p>He asked: "Miss Helen don't know nothing about it yet?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless Dr. Bennett has told her since we left," I answered. Uneasily
  I wondered whether he had, and cursed my stupidity for not getting his
  promise that he wouldn't.</p>

  <p>He considered me for a time, then said: "Okay, Doc. But I've got to tell
  the boss when he comes."</p>

  <p>I laughed, and said: "Okay, McCann. By that time the game may be all over
  &mdash;except for the post-mortems."</p>

  <p>He asked, sharply: "What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>I answered: "Nothing." And went on with my packing. The truth was I didn't
  know myself what I had meant.</p>

  <p>He said: "You figure on getting there some time tomorrow evening. I'll be
  up at the old goat's with some of the lads long before dusk. Probably won't
  get to this house I been telling you of until next day. But nothing's likely
  to happen right off. You got any plans how we're going to get together?"</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking about that." I stopped the packing, and sat on the
  bed. "I'm not so sure how much I'm going to be under surveillance, or what
  liberty I'll have. The situation is&mdash;well, unusual and complicated.
  Obviously, I can't trust to letters or telegrams. Telegrams have to be
  telephoned and telephones can be tapped. Also, letters can be opened. I might
  ride to the village, but that doesn't mean I could get in touch with you when
  I got there, because I don't think I'd be riding alone. Even if you happened
  to be there, it would be highly impolitic to recognize and talk to you. The
  de Keradels are no fools, McCann, and they would realize the situation
  perfectly. Until I've been on the other side of de Keradel's wall and studied
  the ground, I can suggest only one thing."</p>

  <p>"You talk like you been sentenced an' bound for the Big House," he
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"I believe in looking for the worst," I said. "Then you're never
  disappointed. That being so&mdash;put this down, McCann&mdash;a telegram to
  Dr. Bennett which reads&mdash;'Feeling fine. Don't forget to forward all
  mail' means that you're to get over that wall despite hell or high water as
  quick as you can and up to the house as quick as you can and damn the
  torpedoes. Get that McCann?"</p>

  <p>"Okay," he said. "But I got an idea or two likewise. First&mdash; nobody's
  going to keep you from writing after you get there. Okay again. You write an'
  you find some excuse to get to the village. You get out to this Beverly House
  I been telling you about an' go in. Don't matter who's with you, you'll find
  some way to drop that letter on the floor or somewhere. You don't have to
  give it to nobody. After you go they'll comb the place through to find it.
  An' I'll get it. That's one line. Next&mdash;they'll be a couple of lads
  fishing around the north side of that wall all the time &mdash;that's the
  left end of it coming from the house. There's a breast of rock there, an' I
  don't see why you can't climb up that to look at the surroundings, all by
  yourself. Hell, you're inside the wall an' why should they stop you? Then if
  you've writ another note an' put it in a little bottle an' casually throw
  some stones an' among 'em the bottle, the lads being on the look-out for just
  such stuff will just as casually rope it in."</p>

  <p>"Fine," I said, and poured him a drink. "Now all you have to do is to tell
  Dr. Bennett to look out for that message and bring up your myrmidons."</p>

  <p>"My what?" asked McCann.</p>

  <p>"Your gifted lads with their Tommies and pineapples."</p>

  <p>"That's a grand name," said McCann. "The boys'll like it. Say it
  again."</p>

  <p>I said it again, and added: "And for God's sake, don't forget to give that
  message straight to Dr. Bennett."</p>

  <p>He said: "Then you ain't going to talk to him before you go?"</p>

  <p>I said: "No. Nor to Miss Helen either."</p>

  <p>He thought over that for a bit, then asked: "How well you heeled,
  Doc?"</p>

  <p>I showed him my 32-automatic. He shook his head: "This is better, Doc." He
  reached under his left armpit and unstrapped a holster. In it was an
  extraordinarily compact little gun, short-barreled, squat.</p>

  <p>"It shoots a .38," he said. "Ain't nothing under armor plate stands up
  against that, Doc. Tote your other but stick this under your arm. Keep it
  there, asleep or awake. Keep it hid. There's a few extra clips in that pocket
  of the holster."</p>

  <p>I said: "Thanks, Mac." And threw it on the bed.</p>

  <p>He said: "No. Put it on an' get used to the feel of it."</p>

  <p>"All right," I said. And did so.</p>

  <p>He took another drink, leisurely; he said, gently: "Of course, there's one
  straight easy way out of all this, Doc. All you need do when you sit at the
  table with de Keradel an' his gal is to slip that little cannon loose an' let
  'em have it. Me an' the lads'd cover you."</p>

  <p>I said: "I'm not sure enough for that, Mac. Honestly&mdash;I'm not."</p>

  <p>He sighed again, and arose: "You got too much curiosity, Doc. Well, play
  your hand your own way." At the door he turned: "Anyway, the boss'll like
  you. You got guts."</p>

  <p>He went out. I felt as though I'd been given the accolade.</p>

  <p>I dropped a brief note to Bill, simply saying that when one had made up
  one's mind to do something, there was no time like the present and that
  therefore I was making myself one of the de Keradel menage on the morrow. I
  didn't say anything about the Demoiselle's telegram, leaving him to think I
  was on my way solely of my own volition. I told him McCann had a message that
  was damned important, and that if and when he received it from me to forward
  it quick, according to directions.</p>

  <p>I wrote a little letter to Helen...</p>

  <p>The next morning I left the Club early&mdash;before the letters could be
  delivered. I taxied leisurely to Larchmont; arrived at the Club shortly
  before noon and was told that a boat from the Brittis was awaiting me at the
  landing stage. I went down to the boat. There were three men on it&mdash;
  Bretons or Basques, I couldn't tell which, oddly enough. Rather queer looking
  &mdash;stolid faces, the pupils of their eyes unusually dilated, skins
  sallow. One turned his eyes up to me and asked, tonelessly, in French:</p>

  <p>"The Sieur de Carnac?"</p>

  <p>I answered, impatiently: "Dr. Caranac." And took my place in the
  stern.</p>

  <p>He turned to the two: "The Sieur de Carnac. Go."</p>

  <p>We shot through a school of small fry and headed for a slim gray yacht. I
  asked: "The Brittis?" The helmsman nodded. She was a sweet craft, about a
  hundred and fifty feet over all, schooner rigged and built for speed. I
  doubted McCann's estimate of her ocean-going capabilities.</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle was standing at the head of the ladder. Considering the
  manner of my last parting with her, there were obvious elements of
  embarrassment in this meeting. I had given them considerable thought and had
  decided to ignore them, or pass them over lightly&mdash;if she would let me.
  It was no picture of a romantic hero I had made sliding down from her tower,
  and I was still somewhat sensitive as to its undignified aspects. I hoped her
  arts, infernal or otherwise, hadn't enabled her to reconstruct that
  spectacle. So when I had climbed the ladder, I simply said with cheerful
  idiocy:</p>

  <p>"Hello, Dahut. You're looking beautiful."</p>

  <p>And so she was. Nothing at all like the Dahut of ancient Ys; nothing at
  all like a shadow queen; nothing at all like a witch. She had on a snappy
  white sport suit, and there was no aureole, evil or otherwise, about her pale
  gold hair. Instead there was a tricky little green knit hat. Her great violet
  eyes were clear and ingenuous with not a trace of the orchid hell sparks. In
  fact, to outward appearance only an extraordinarily beautiful woman with no
  more high explosive about her than any beautiful woman would naturally carry.
  But I knew different, and something whispered to me to be doubly on my
  guard.</p>

  <p>She laughed, and held out her hand: "Welcome, Alain."</p>

  <p>She glanced at my two bags with a small enigmatic smile, and led me down
  to a luxurious little cabin. She said, matter-of-factly: "I'll wait for you
  on deck. Don't be long. Lunch is ready." And she was gone.</p>

  <p>The yacht was already under way. I looked out of the port and was
  surprised to see how far we were from the Club. The Brittis was speedier than
  I had surmised. In a few minutes I went up on deck and joined the Demoiselle.
  She was talking to the captain whom she introduced to me by the good old
  Breton name of Braz; and me to him as the "Sieur de Carnac." The captain was
  of stockier build than the others I had seen, but with the same stolid
  expression and the same abnormally dilated eyes. I saw the pupils of his eyes
  suddenly contract, like a cat's, and a curiously speculative gleam come into
  them... almost as though it were recognition.</p>

  <p>I knew then that what I had taken for stolidity was not that at all. It
  was withdrawal. This man's consciousness lived in a world of its own, his
  actions and responses to the outer world instinctive only. For some reason
  that consciousness had looked out from its inner world into this under the
  spur of the ancient name. From its own world... or from another's into which
  it had been sent? And were the other men upon this boat under that same
  strange duress?</p>

  <p>I said: "But Captain Braz, I prefer to be called Dr. Caranac&mdash;not the
  Sieur de Carnac." I watched him closely. He did not respond, his face
  impassive, his eyes wide and blank. It was as though he had not heard me.</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle said: "The Lord of Carnac will make many voyages with
  us."</p>

  <p>He bent and kissed my hand; he answered, tonelessly as had the boatman:
  "The Lord of Carnac does me great honor."</p>

  <p>He bent to the Demoiselle and walked away. I watched him, and felt a creep
  along my spine. It was exactly as though an automaton had spoken; an
  automaton of flesh and blood who had seen me not as I was but as someone else
  had bidden him.</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle was regarding me with frank amusement. I said,
  indifferently: "You have perfect discipline, Dahut."</p>

  <p>Again she laughed: "Perfect, Alain. Let us go to lunch."</p>

  <p>We went to lunch. That, too, was perfect. Somewhat too perfect. The two
  stewards who served us were like the others I had seen; and they served us on
  bent knees. The Demoiselle was a perfect hostess. We talked of this and
  that... and steadily I forgot what she probably was, and thought of her as
  what she seemed to be. Only toward the last did that which was buried deep in
  both our minds crop out. The blank-eyed stewards had knelt, and gone. I said,
  half to myself:</p>

  <p>"Here feudal and the modern meet."</p>

  <p>She answered, quietly: "As they do in me. But you are too conservative in
  naming feudal times, Alain. My servants go further back than that. As do
  I."</p>

  <p>I said nothing. She held her wine glass against the light, turned it to
  catch the colors, and added, casually:</p>

  <p>"As do you!"</p>

  <p>I lifted my own glass, and touched hers with its rim: "To ancient Ys? If
  so, I drink to it."</p>

  <p>She answered gravely: "To ancient Ys... and we drink to It."</p>

  <p>We touched glasses again, and drank. She set down her glass and looked at
  me, faint mockery in her eyes and, when she spoke, within her voice:</p>

  <p>"Is it not like a honeymoon, Alain?"</p>

  <p>I said, coldly: "If so&mdash;it would be somewhat lacking in novelty
  &mdash;would it not?"</p>

  <p>She flushed a little at that. She said: "You are rather brutal,
  Alain."</p>

  <p>I said: "I might feel more a bridegroom if I felt less like a
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>Her straight brows drew together, and for a moment the hell sparks danced
  in her eyes. She dropped her eyes and said, demurely, although the angry
  flush still stained her cheeks:</p>

  <p>"But you are so elusive, my beloved. You have such a gift for
  disappearance. There was nothing for you to fear that night. You had seen
  what I had willed you to see, done as I had willed&mdash;why did you run
  away?"</p>

  <p>That stung; the sleeping wrath and hate against her that I had known since
  I met her flared up; I caught her wrists:</p>

  <p>"Not because I feared you, white witch. I could have strangled you while
  you slept."</p>

  <p>She asked, tranquilly, and tiny dimples showed beside her lips:</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you?"</p>

  <p>I dropped her hands: "I may still. That was a wonderful picture you
  painted in my sleeping mind."</p>

  <p>She stared at me, incredulously: "You mean... you do not think it was
  real? That Ys was not real?"</p>

  <p>"No more real, Dahut, than the world in which the minds of the men on this
  boat live. At your command&mdash;or your father's."</p>

  <p>She said, somberly: "Then I must convince you of its reality."</p>

  <p>I said, rage still hot within me: "Nor more real than your shadows,
  Dahut."</p>

  <p>She said, yet more somberly: "Then of those, too, you must be
  convinced."</p>

  <p>The moment I had said that about the shadows I was sorry for it. Her reply
  did nothing to reassure me. I cursed myself. This was no way to play the
  game. There was no advantage to be gained by quarreling with the Demoiselle.
  It might, indeed, bring down upon those I was trying to protect precisely
  what I was trying to save them from. Was that the meaning behind her promise
  to convince me? She was pledged so far as Bill was concerned and here I was
  in payment&mdash;but she had made no pledges as to Helen.</p>

  <p>If I was to play my game, it must be to the limit; convincingly; with no
  reservations. I looked at Dahut and thought, with a sharp pang of
  compunction, for Helen, that if the Demoiselle were a willing partner it
  would have its peculiar compensations. And then I thrust Helen out of my
  mind, as though she might read that thought.</p>

  <p>And there was only one way to convince a woman...</p>

  <p>I stood up. I took the glass from which I had drunk and I took Dahut's
  glass and threw them to the cabin floor, splintering. I walked to the door
  and turned the key. I went to Dahut and lifted her from the chair and carried
  her to the divan beneath the port. Her arms clung round my neck, and she
  raised her lips to mine... her eyes closed...</p>

  <p>I said: "To hell with Ys and to hell with its mysteries. I live in
  today."</p>

  <p>She whispered: "You love me?"</p>

  <p>I answered: "I do love you."</p>

  <p>"No!" she pushed me away. "In the long ago you loved me. Loved me even
  though you killed me. And in this life it was not you but the Lord of Carnac
  who for a night was my lover. Yet this I know&mdash;again in this life you
  must love me. But must you again kill me? I wonder, Alain... I wonder..."</p>

  <p>I took her hands, and they were cold; in her eyes there was neither
  mockery nor amusement; there was vague puzzlement and vague dread. Nor was
  there anything of the witch about her. I felt a stirring of pity&mdash;what
  if she, like the others upon this boat, were victim of another's will? De
  Keradel's who called himself her father... Dahut who lay there looking at me
  with the eyes of a frightened maiden and she was very beautiful...</p>

  <p>She whispered: "Alain, beloved&mdash;better for you and better for me if
  you had not obeyed my summons. Was it because of that shadow I was forced to
  send your friend... or had you other reasons?"</p>

  <p>That steadied me. I thought: Witch, you are not so clever.</p>

  <p>I said, as though reluctantly: "There was another reason, Dahut."</p>

  <p>She asked: "And that?"</p>

  <p>"You," I said.</p>

  <p>She bent toward me, took my chin in one soft hand and held my face close
  to hers: "You mean that&mdash;Alain de Carnac?"</p>

  <p>I said: "I may not love you as the Lord of Carnac did. But I am tempted to
  try."</p>

  <p>She leaned back at that, laughing&mdash;little rippling waves of laughter,
  careless and cruel.</p>

  <p>"You woo me strangely, Alain. Yet I like it&mdash;for I know that what you
  say is truth. What do you truly think of me, Alain?"</p>

  <p>I said: "I think of you as a garden that was planned under the red Heart
  of the Dragon ten thousand years before the Great Pyramid was built and its
  rays fell upon the altar of its most secret shrine... a strange garden,
  Dahut, half of the sea... with trees whose leaves chant instead of whisper...
  with flowers that may be evil and may not be, but certainly are not wholly of
  earth... whose birds sing strange songs... whose breath is more of ocean than
  of land... difficult garden to enter... more difficult to find its heart...
  most difficult, once entered, to find escape."</p>

  <p>I said: "I think of you as a garden that was planned."</p>

  <p>She bent to me, eyes wide and glowing; kissed me: "You think that of me!
  And it is true... and the Lord of Carnac never saw me so truly... you
  remember more than he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She fastened my wrists, her breast against mine: "The red-haired girl
  &mdash;I forget her name&mdash;is she not a garden, too?"</p>

  <p>Helen!</p>

  <p>I said, indifferently: "A garden of earth. Fragrant and sweet. But no
  difficulty there about finding your way out."</p>

  <p>She dropped my wrists, and sat for a time silent; then said, abruptly:</p>

  <p>"Let us go up on deck."</p>

  <p>I followed her, uneasily. Something had gone amiss, something I had said
  or had not said about Helen. But what the devil it could have been, I did not
  know. I looked at my watch. It was after four. There was a fog, but the yacht
  seemed not to mind it; instead of diminishing, it seemed to me that the speed
  had increased. As we sat on the deck chairs, I mentioned this to the
  Demoiselle. She said, absently: "It is nothing. There can be no danger."</p>

  <p>I said: "The speed seems rather dangerous."</p>

  <p>She answered: "We must be at Ys by seven."</p>

  <p>I echoed, stupidly: "Ys?"</p>

  <p>She said: "Ys. It is so we have named our home."</p>

  <p>She sank back into silence. I watched the fog. It was an odd fog. It did
  not swirl past us as fog normally does. It seemed to go with us, to
  accommodate its pace to ours.</p>

  <p>To move with us.</p>

  <p>The wide-eyed, vacant-faced sailors padded past. I began to have a
  nightmarish sort of feeling that I was on a ship of ghosts, a modern Flying
  Dutchman, cut off from the rest of the world and sped on by unseen, unheard,
  unfelt winds. Or being pushed along by some gigantic swimmer whose hand was
  clasped about the stern of this boat... and whose breath was the fog that
  shrouded us. I glanced at the Demoiselle. Her eyes were shut, and she seemed
  to be fast asleep. I closed my own eyes.</p>

  <p>When I opened them, the yacht had stopped. There was no sign of fog. We
  lay in a little harbor between two rocky headlands. Dahut was shaking me by
  the shoulders. I was outlandishly sleepy. The sea air, I drowsily thought. We
  dropped into a tender, and landed at a dock. We climbed up steps,
  interminably, it seemed to me. A few yards from the top of the steps was a
  long rambling old stone house. It was dark, and I could see nothing beyond it
  but the banks of trees, half-stripped by autumn of their leaves.</p>

  <p>We went into the house, met by servants, wide-pupilled, impassive, as
  those who manned the Brittis. I was taken to my room, and a valet began to
  unpack my bags. In the same torpor, I dressed for dinner. The only moment of
  real consciousness I had was when I put my hand up and felt McCann's holster
  under my armpit.</p>

  <p>I have the vaguest recollection of the dinner. I know that de Keradel
  greeted me with the utmost politeness and hospitality. During the dinner, he
  talked on and on, but what he was talking about I'm damned if I knew. Now and
  then I was aware acutely of the Demoiselle, her face and big eyes swimming
  out of the haze that gripped me. And now and then I thought that I must have
  been drugged&mdash;but whether I had or hadn't been didn't seem to matter.
  There was one thing that I was acutely conscious did matter, however&mdash;
  and that was how I answered de Keradel's questions. But another sense, or
  another self, unaffected by what had so paralyzed my normal ones, seemed to
  have taken charge of that, and I had the comfortable feeling that it was
  doing it most satisfactorily.</p>

  <p>And after a while I heard Dahut say: "But, Alain, you are so sleepy. Why,
  you can hardly keep your eyes open. It must be the sea air."</p>

  <p>I replied, solemnly, that it must indeed be the sea air and apologized for
  my dullness. I had a dim perception of the solicitous readiness with which de
  Keradel accepted the feeble excuses. He, himself, took me to my room. At
  least, I was hazily aware that he accompanied me to some place where there
  was a bed. I rid myself of my clothes by sheer habit, dropped into the bed
  and in an instant was sound asleep.</p>

  <p>I sat up in my bed, wide-awake. The strange drowsiness was gone; the
  irresistible torpor lifted. What had awakened me? I looked at my watch, and
  it was a few minutes after one. The sound that had awakened me came again
  somberly&mdash;a distant muffled chanting, as though from far under earth. As
  though from far beneath the old house.</p>

  <p>It passed slowly from beneath the house, rising, approaching; becoming
  ever plainer. A weird chanting, archaic; vaguely familiar. I got up from the
  bed, and went to the windows. They looked out upon the ocean. There was no
  moon but I could see the gray surges breaking sullenly against the rocky
  shore. The chanting grew louder. I did not know where was the switch to turn
  on the electrics. There had been a flashlight in one of my bags, but these
  had been unpacked; their contents distributed.</p>

  <p>I felt around in my coat and found a box of matches. The chanting was
  dying away, as though those singing were passing far beyond the house. I
  lighted a match, and saw a switch beside the wall. I pressed it, and without
  result. I saw my flashlight on a table beside the bed. I clicked the catch,
  but no ray streamed forth. Suspicion began to take hold of me that these
  three things were linked&mdash;the strange sleepiness, the useless flash, the
  unresponsive switch...</p>

  <p>McCann's gun! I felt for it. There it was, nestling under my left armpit.
  I looked at it. The magazine was full and the extra clips safe. I went to the
  door and cautiously turned the key. It opened into a wide, old-fashioned hall
  at the end of which dimly glimmered a great window. The hall was curiously
  uneasy. That is the only word for it. It was filled with whisperings and
  rustlings&mdash;and shadows.</p>

  <p>I hesitated; then stole to the window and looked out.</p>

  <p>There was a bank of trees through whose half-bare branches I could see
  across a level field. Beyond that level field was another bank of trees. From
  beyond them came the chanting.</p>

  <p>There was a glow through and over these trees&mdash;a gray glow. I stared
  at it... thinking of what McCann had said... like light decaying...
  rotten...</p>

  <p>It was exactly that. I stood there, gripping the window, looking at the
  putrescent glow wax and wane... wax and wane. And now the chanting was like
  that dead luminescence transformed to sound...</p>

  <p>And then a sharp scream of human agony shot through it.</p>

  <p>The whisperings in the hall were peremptory. The rustlings were close. The
  shadows were pressing around me. They pressed me from the window, back to my
  room. I thrust the door shut against them, and leaned against it, wet with
  sweat.</p>

  <p>Leaning against it, I heard again that scream of anguish, sharper, more
  agonized. And suddenly muffled.</p>

  <p>Again the torpor swept over me. I crumpled down at the edge of the door,
  and slept.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15"></a>15. &mdash; BEHIND DE KERADEL'S WALL&mdash;2</h2>

  <p class="first">Something was dancing, flittering, before me. It had no
  shape, but it had a voice. The voice was whispering, over and over: "Dahut...
  beware of Dahut... Alan, beware of Dahut... give me release, Alan... beware
  of Dahut, Alan... give me release... from the Gatherer... from the
  Blackness..."</p>

  <p>I tried to focus upon this flittering thing, but there was a brilliancy
  about it into which it melted and was lost; a broad aureole of brilliancy and
  only when I turned my eyes from it could I see the thing dancing and
  flittering like a fly caught in a globule of light.</p>

  <p>But the voice&mdash;I knew the voice.</p>

  <p>The thing danced and flittered; grew larger but never assumed definite
  shape; became small, and still was shapeless... a flittering shadow caught in
  a brilliancy...</p>

  <p>A shadow!</p>

  <p>The thing whispered: "The Gatherer, Alan, the Gatherer in the Cairn, do
  not let It eat me but beware, beware of Dahut free me, Alan, free... free...
  " Ralston's voice!</p>

  <p>I lifted myself to my knees, crouching, hands on the floor; my eyes fixed
  upon the brilliancy&mdash;straining to focus this flittering thing that
  whispered with the voice of Ralston.</p>

  <p>The brilliancy contracted&mdash;like the eyes of the captain of the
  Brittis. It became the knob of a door. A knob of brass glimmering in the
  light of dawn.</p>

  <p>There was a fly upon the knob. A bluebottle; a carrion fly. It was
  crawling over the knob, buzzing. The voice I had thought that of Dick was
  drained down into the buzzing; became one with it. There was only a
  bluebottle fly flittering and buzzing upon a shining brass door-knob. The fly
  left the knob, circled me and was gone.</p>

  <p>I staggered to my feet. I thought: Whatever you did to me there on the
  boat, Dahut, it was a first-class job. I looked at my wristwatch. It was a
  few minutes after six. I opened the door, cautiously. The hall was
  shadowless; tranquil. There was not a sound in the house. It seemed to sleep,
  but I didn't trust it. I closed the door quietly. There were great bolts at
  top and bottom which I dropped into place.</p>

  <p>There was a queer emptiness in my head, and I could not see clearly. I
  made my way to the window and drew deep breaths of the sharp morning air, the
  tang of the sea strong within it. It made me feel better. I turned and looked
  at the room. It was immense; paneled in old wood; tapestries, colors softened
  by centuries, fell here and there. The bed was ancient, carved and postered
  and canopied. It was the chamber of some castle in Brittany, rather than that
  of a New England manse. At my left was an armoire, ancient as the bed. Idly,
  I opened a drawer. There upon my handkerchiefs lay my pistol. I pulled it
  open. Not a cartridge was in the chamber.</p>

  <p>I looked at it, unbelievingly. I knew that I had loaded it when I had
  placed it in one of my bags. Abruptly, its emptiness linked itself with the
  useless flash, the unresponsive switch, the strange sleepiness. It jarred me
  wide-awake. I put the gun back in the drawer and went and lay down on the
  bed. I hadn't the slightest doubt that something other than natural cause had
  induced the stupor. Whether it had been suggestion by Dahut while I lay
  asleep on the deck, or whether she had given me some soporific drug with my
  lunch, made no difference. It had not been natural. A drug? I remembered the
  subtle drug the Tibetan lamas administer&mdash;the drug they name "Master of
  the Will" which weakens all resistance to hypnotic control and renders the
  minds of those to whom it is given impotent against command, wide-open to
  hallucination. All at once the behavior, the appearance, of the men on the
  boat, the servants in this house, fell into an understandable pattern.
  Suppose that all were being fed with such a drug, and moved and thought only
  as the Demoiselle and her father willed them to move and think? That I was
  surrounded by human robots, creatures who were reflections, multiplications,
  of the de Keradels?</p>

  <p>And that I, myself, was in imminent peril of the same slavery?</p>

  <p>Belief that something like this was the truth became stronger the more I
  thought over it. I strove to recall the conversation with de Keradel the
  night before. I could not&mdash;but I still retained the conviction I had
  passed the ordeal successfully; that the other sense or self which had taken
  charge had not allowed me to be betrayed. Deep within, I felt that
  assurance.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as I lay there, I felt other eyes upon me; knew that I was being
  watched. I was facing the windows. I drew a deep breath, sighed as one does
  in deep sleep, and turned with arm over face. Under its cover, with scarcely
  opened lids, I watched. In a few moments a white hand stole from behind a
  tapestry, drew it aside, and Dahut stepped into the room. Her braids fell
  below her waist, she wore the sheerest of silken negligées and she was
  incomparably lovely. She slipped to the bottom of the bed, soundlessly as one
  of her shadows, and stood studying me. I forced myself to breathe regularly,
  as though in soundest slumber. She was so lovely that I found it rather
  difficult. She came to the side of the bed and leaned over me. I felt her
  lips touch my cheek as lightly as the kiss of a moth.</p>

  <p>Then, as suddenly, I knew she was gone.</p>

  <p>I opened my eyes. There was another scent, unfamiliar, mingling with the
  breath of the sea. It was oddly stimulating. Breathing it, I felt the last
  traces of lethargy vanish. I sat up, wide-awake and alert. There was a
  shallow metal dish on the table beside the bed. Piled on it was a little heap
  of fern-like leaves. They were smoldering, and from their smoke came the
  invigorating scent. I pressed out the sparks and instantly smoke and scent
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>Evidently this was an antidote to whatever had induced the other
  condition; and quite as evidently there was no suspicion that I had not slept
  uninterruptedly throughout the night.</p>

  <p>And possibly, it occurred to me, the shadow-crowded, rustling hall and the
  bluebottle fly that had buzzed with the voice of Ralston might have been by-
  products of this hypothetical drug; the sub-consciousness fantastically
  picturing under its influence, as it does in dream, chance sounds in terms of
  what has been engrossing the consciousness.</p>

  <p>Maybe I really had slept through the night. Maybe I had only dreamed I had
  gone out into the shadow-crowded hall... and had fled from it and dropped
  down beside the door... had only dreamed the chanting.</p>

  <p>But if there had been nothing they had wanted me to be deaf and blind to
  &mdash;then why had they bundled me up in that blanket of sleep?</p>

  <p>Well, there was one thing I knew I had not dreamed.</p>

  <p>That was Dahut slipping into the room with the leaves.</p>

  <p>And that meant I hadn't acted precisely as they had expected, else I
  wouldn't have been awake to see her. There was one lucky break, whatever the
  cause. I would be able to use those leaves later, if they repeated the
  bundling.</p>

  <p>I went over to the tapestry and raised it. There was no sign of opening,
  the paneling seemingly solid. Some secret spring existed, of course, but I
  postponed hunting for it. I unbarred the door; the bars were about as much a
  guarantee of privacy as one wall in a room with the other three sides open. I
  took what was left of the leaves, put them in an envelope and tucked them in
  McCann's holster. Then I smoked half a dozen cigarettes and added their ashes
  to those on the dish. The appeared about the same, and they were about what
  would have remained if all the leaves had burned. Maybe nobody would bother
  to check&mdash;but maybe they would.</p>

  <p>By then it was seven o'clock. I wondered whether I ought to get up and
  dress. How long was it supposed to be before the antidote took effect? I had
  no means of knowing and no desire to make the least mistake. To sleep too
  long would be far safer than to wake too soon. I crawled back into bed. And I
  did go to sleep, honestly and dreamlessly.</p>

  <p>When I awakened there was a man laying out my clothes; the valet. The dish
  that had held the smoking leaves was gone. It was half after eight. I sat up
  and yawned, and the valet announced with antique humility that the Lord of
  Carnac's bath was ready. Despite all that the Lord of Carnac had on his mind,
  this combination of archaic servility and modern convenience made me laugh.
  But no smile answered me. The man stood, head bent, wound up to do and say
  certain things. Smiling had not been in his instructions.</p>

  <p>I looked at his impassive face, the blank eyes which were not seeing me at
  all as I was, nor the world in which I lived, but were seeing me as another
  man in another world. What that world might be, I suspected.</p>

  <p>I threw a robe over my pajamas and locked the bathroom door against him;
  unstrapped McCann's holster and hid it before bathing. When I came out I
  dismissed him. He told me that breakfast would be ready a little after nine,
  and bowing low, departed.</p>

  <p>I went to the armoire, took out my gun and snapped it open. The cartridges
  were in place. Furthermore, the extra clips lay orderly beside where it had
  been. Had I also dreamed that it had been emptied? A suspicion came to me. If
  I were wrong, I could explain it as an accident. I carried the gun to the
  window, aimed it at the sea and touched the trigger. There was only a sharp
  crack as the cap exploded. In the night the cartridges had been made useless
  and, without doubt, had been restored to the pistol during my later
  sleep.</p>

  <p>Well, here was warning enough, I thought grimly, without any buzzing
  bluebottle, and put the gun back. Then I went down to breakfast, cold with
  anger and disposed to be brutal if I had the chance. The Demoiselle was
  waiting for me, prosaically reading a newspaper. The table was laid for two,
  so I judged her father had business otherwhere. I looked at Dahut, and as
  always admiration and a certain tenderness reluctantly joined my wrath and my
  rooted hatred of her. I think I have mentioned her beauty before. She was
  never more beautiful than now&mdash;a dewy freshness about her, like the
  dawn; her skin a miracle, clear-eyed, just the right touch of demureness...
  not at all the murderess, harlot, and witch I knew her in my heart to be.
  Clean.</p>

  <p>She dropped the paper and held out her hand. I kissed it, ironically.</p>

  <p>She said: "I do hope you slept soundly, Alan."</p>

  <p>And that had just the right touch of domesticity. It irritated me still
  more. I dropped into my chair, spread my napkin over my knees: "Soundly,
  Dahut. Except for a big bluebottle fly that came and whispered to me."</p>

  <p>Her eyes narrowed at that, and distinctly I saw her tremble. Then she
  dropped her eyes, and laughed: "You're joking, Alan."</p>

  <p>I said: "I am not. It was a big bluebottle that whispered and buzzed, and
  buzzed and whispered."</p>

  <p>She asked, quietly: "What did it whisper, Alan?"</p>

  <p>"To beware of you, Dahut."</p>

  <p>She asked, again quietly: "Were you awake?"</p>

  <p>Now, regaining caution, I laughed: "Do bluebottle flies whisper to people
  who are awake? I was sound asleep and dreaming&mdash;without doubt."</p>

  <p>"Did you know the voice?" Her eyes lifted suddenly and held mine. I
  answered:</p>

  <p>"When I heard it I seemed to know it. But now, awake, I have
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>She was silent while the blank-eyed servants placed this and that before
  us. Then she said, half-wearily: "Put away your sword, Alan. For today, at
  least, you do not need it. And today, at least, I carry no weapons. I pledge
  you this, and you can trust me for today. Treat me today only as one who
  loves you greatly. Will you do this, Alan?"</p>

  <p>It was said so simply, so sincerely, that my anger fled and my distrust of
  her weakened. For the first time I felt a stirring of pity. She said:</p>

  <p>"'I will not even ask you to pretend to love me."</p>

  <p>I said, slowly: "It would not be hard to love you, Dahut."</p>

  <p>The violet of her eyes was misted with tears; she said: "I wonder."</p>

  <p>I said: "A bargain. We meet for the first time this morning. I know
  nothing of you, Dahut, and today you will be to me only what you seem to be.
  Perhaps by tonight I will be your slave."</p>

  <p>She said, sharply: "I asked you to put down your sword."</p>

  <p>I had meant nothing more than what I had said. No innuendo... But now I
  heard again the voice that had changed to the buzzing of a fly&mdash;
  "Beware... beware of Dahut... Alan, beware of Dahut... " And I thought of the
  blank-eyed, impassive men... slaves to her will or to her father's...</p>

  <p>I would not put away the sword&mdash;but I would hide it.</p>

  <p>I said, earnestly: "I haven't the slightest idea what you mean, Dahut.
  Really I haven't. I meant precisely what I said."</p>

  <p>She seemed to believe me. And on that basis, piquant enough considering
  what had gone before in New York and ancient Ys, our breakfast continued. It
  had its peculiar charm. Before it was done I found myself dangerously close
  several times to thinking of the Demoiselle exactly as she wanted me to think
  of her. We dawdled, and it was eleven when we ended. She suggested a ride
  around the place, and with relief I went up to change my clothes. I had to
  snap my gun a few times and look at the leaves in McCann's holster to clear
  my mind of disarming doubts. Dahut had a way with her.</p>

  <p>When I came down she was in riding breeches, her hair braided around her
  head like a helmet. We went to the stables. There were a dozen first class
  horses. I looked around for the black stallion. I didn't see it, but there
  was a box stall where it might have been. I picked out a sweet roan and Dahut
  a leggy bay. What I wanted most to see was de Keradel's "rockery." I didn't
  see it. We trotted along a well-made bridle path which gave occasional vistas
  of the water, but most of the time the rocks and trees shut off the ocean. It
  was a peculiar lay-out and one better adapted for solitude I have never seen.
  We came at last to the wall, turned and rode along it. Wicked, inverted
  chevaux-de-frise guarded the top, and there were a couple of wires that I
  suspected of carrying heavy voltage. They could not have been there when
  'Lias had scaled the wall. I thought that probably he had taught a lesson as
  well as having received one. And here and there stood one of the swarthy
  little men. They had clubs, but how otherwise armed I could not tell. They
  knelt as we passed them.</p>

  <p>We came to a massive gate, and there was a garrison of half a dozen. We
  rode past the gate and came to a wide, long meadow land dotted with stunted
  bushes, crouching like cowering men. It came to me that this must be where
  the unfortunate 'Lias had encountered the dogs that weren't dogs. Under the
  sun, the brisk air and the exhilaration of riding, that story had lost many
  of its elements of reality. Yet the place had a frightened, forbidding
  aspect. I mentioned this casually to Dahut. She looked at me with a secret
  amusement; answered as casually: "Yes&mdash;but there is good hunting
  here."</p>

  <p>She rode on without saying what kind of hunting. Nor did I ask; for there
  had been that about her answer which had abruptly restored my faith in
  'Lias's veracity.</p>

  <p>We came to the end of the wall, and it was built in the rock as McCann had
  said. There was a big breast of the rock which shut off view of what lay
  beyond. I said:</p>

  <p>"I'd like to take a look from here." And before she could answer, had
  dismounted and climbed the rock. From the top, it was open ocean. A couple of
  hundred yards from shore were two men in a small fishing boat. They raised
  their heads as they saw me, and one drew out a hand net and began dipping
  with it. Well, McCann was on the job.</p>

  <p>I scrambled down and joined Dahut. I asked: "How about riding back and
  going out the gate for a canter. I'd like to see more of the
  countryside."</p>

  <p>She hesitated, then nodded; we rode back and through the garrison and out
  upon a country road. In a little while we sighted a fine old house, set well
  back among big trees. A stone wall protected it from the road, and lounging
  beside one of its gates was McCann.</p>

  <p>He watched us come imperturbably. Dahut passed without a glance. I had
  hung back a few paces, and as I went by McCann I dropped a card. I had hoped
  for just this encounter, and I had managed to scribble on it:</p>

  <p>"Something very wrong but no definite evidence yet. About thirty men,
  think all well-armed. Barbed and charged wires behind wall."</p>

  <p>I drew up beside the Demoiselle and we rode on a mile or so. She halted,
  and asked: "Have you seen enough?"</p>

  <p>I said, yes; and we turned back. When we went by McCann he was still
  lounging beside the gate as though he had not moved. But there was no paper
  on the road.</p>

  <p>The garrison had seen us coming, and the postern was swinging open. We
  returned to the house the same way we had gone. I had gotten not a glimpse of
  the "rockery."</p>

  <p>Dahut was flushed with the ride, full of gaiety. She said: "I'll bathe.
  Then we'll have lunch on the boat&mdash;go for a little cruise."</p>

  <p>"Fine," I said. "And I hope it doesn't make me as sleepy as it did
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>Her eyes narrowed, but my face was entirely innocent. She smiled: "It
  won't, I'm sure. You're getting acclimated."</p>

  <p>I said, morosely: "I hope so. I must have been pretty dull company at
  dinner last night."</p>

  <p>She smiled again: "But you weren't. You pleased my father immensely."</p>

  <p>She went into the house laughing.</p>

  <p>I was very glad I had pleased her father.</p>

  <p>It had been a thoroughly delightful sail with a thoroughly charming girl.
  Only when one of the tranced crew knelt as he passed did I feel the sinister
  hidden undertow. And now I sat at dinner with de Keradel and the Demoiselle.
  De Keradel's conversation was so fascinating that he had made me forget that
  I was a prisoner. I had discussed with him much that I had wished to on the
  night Bill had persuaded me to be so objectionable. If at times his manner
  was irritatingly too much like that of a hierophant instructing a neophyte in
  elementary mysteries, or if he calmly advanced as fact matters which modern
  science holds to be the darkest of superstitions, investing them with all the
  authenticity of proven experience&mdash;it made no difference to me. The
  man's learning was as extraordinary as his mind, and I wondered how in one
  short life he could have acquired it. He spoke of the rites of Osiris, the
  black worship of Typhon whom the Egyptians also named Set of the Red Hair,
  the Eleusinian and the Delphic mysteries as though he had witnessed them.
  Described them in minutest detail&mdash;and others more ancient and darker,
  long buried in age-rotten shrouds of Time. The evil secrets of the Sabbat
  were open to him, and once he spoke of the worship of Kore, the Daughter, who
  was known also as Persephone, and in another form as Hecate, and by other
  names back, back through the endless vistas of the ages&mdash;the wife of
  Hades, the Queen of the Shades whose daughters were the Furies.</p>

  <p>It was then I told him of what I had beheld in the Delphian cave when the
  Greek priest with the pagan soul had evoked Kore... and I had watched that
  majestic&mdash;that dreadful&mdash;form taking shape in the swirls of smoke
  from what was being consumed upon her thrice ancient altar...</p>

  <p>He listened intently, without interrupting, as one to whom the story held
  no surprise. He asked: "And had She come to him before?"</p>

  <p>I answered: "I do not know."</p>

  <p>He said directly to the Demoiselle: "But even if so, the fact that She
  appeared to&mdash;to Dr. Caranac&mdash;is most significant. It is proof that
  he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dahut interrupted him, and I thought there was some warning in the glance
  she gave him: "That he is acceptable. Yes, my father."</p>

  <p>De Keradel considered me: "An illuminating experience, indeed. I am
  wondering, in the light of it, and of other things you have told me&mdash;I
  am wondering why you were so&mdash;so hostile&mdash;to such ideas the night
  we met."</p>

  <p>I answered, bluntly: "I was more than half drunk and ready to fight
  anybody."</p>

  <p>He bared his teeth at that, then laughed outright: "You do not fear to
  speak the truth."</p>

  <p>"Neither when drunk nor sober," I said.</p>

  <p>He scrutinized me silently, for moments. He spoke, more as though to
  himself than to me: "I do not know... she may be right... if I could wholly
  trust him it would mean much to us... he has curiosity... he does not shrink
  from the dark wisdom... but has he courage... ?"</p>

  <p>I laughed at that, and said, baldly: "If I did not have&mdash;would I be
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Quite true, my father." Dahut was smiling maliciously.</p>

  <p>De Keradel struck down his hand like one who has come at last to a
  decision: "Carnac, I spoke to you of an experiment in which I am deeply
  interested. Instead of being a spectator, willing or unwilling... or no
  spectator, whichever I might decide... " he paused as though to let the
  covert menace of this sink in... "I invite you to participate with me in this
  experiment. I have good reason to believe that its rewards, if successful,
  will be incalculably great. My invitation is not disinterested. I will admit
  to you that my experiment has not as yet met with full success. I have had
  results&mdash;but they have not been what I hoped. But what you have told me
  of Kore proves that you are no barrier to the materialization of these
  Beings&mdash;Powers or Presences, or if you prefer, discarnate, unknown
  energies which can take shape, become substance, in accordance with laws
  discoverable to man&mdash;and discovered. Also, you have within you the
  ancient blood of Carnac, and the ancient memories of your race. It may be
  that I have missed some slight detail that your stimulated memory will
  recall. It may be that with you beside us this Being I desire to evoke will
  appear in all its power&mdash;and with all that implies of power for us."</p>

  <p>I asked: "What is that Being?"</p>

  <p>He said: "You, yourself, named it. That which in one of its manifold
  shapes came to the Alkar-Az of ancient Carnac as it came to the temples of my
  own people ages before Ys was built or the stones of Carnac raised&mdash; the
  Gatherer in the Cairn&mdash;the Blackness..."</p>

  <p>If I felt cold creep along my skin he did not know it. It was the answer I
  had been expecting and I was prepared.</p>

  <p>I looked long at Dahut, and he, at least, misinterpreted that look, as I
  had hoped he would. I struck my own hand down upon the table: "De Keradel, I
  am with you."</p>

  <p>After all, wasn't that why I had come there?</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16"></a>16. &mdash; THE MAEL BENNIQUE</h2>

  <p class="first">De Keradel said: "We drink to that!"</p>

  <p>He dismissed the servants, unlocked a closet and took from it a decanter
  half-filled with a green liqueur. The stopper was clamped and difficult to
  withdraw. He poured three small glasses and quickly clamped the stopper down.
  I raised my glass.</p>

  <p>He checked me: "Wait!"</p>

  <p>There were little bubbles rising through the green drink; like atoms of
  diamonds; like splintered sun rays shot back by crystals bottoming still
  shallows. They rose more and more quickly, and suddenly the green drink
  fumed; then became quiescent, pellucid.</p>

  <p>De Keradel lifted his glass: "Carnac, you join us of your own will?"</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle said, her glass close to mine: "It is of your own will you
  join us, Alain de Carnac?"</p>

  <p>I answered: "Of my own will."</p>

  <p>We touched glasses and drank.</p>

  <p>That was a strange drink. It tingled through brain and nerve, and
  immediately there was born of it an extraordinary sense of freedom; swift
  sloughing of inhibitions; a blowing away of old ideas as though they had
  crumbled to dust and, like dust, had been puffed from the surface of
  consciousness. As though I were a serpent which had, abruptly, shed an
  outworn skin. Memories grew dim, faded away, readjusted themselves. I had an
  indescribable sense of liberation... I could do anything, since, like God,
  there existed for me neither good nor evil. Whatever I willed to do that I
  could do, since there was neither evil nor good but only my will...</p>

  <p>De Keradel said: "You are one with us."</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle whispered: "You are one with us, Alain."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were closed, or seemed to be; the long lashes low upon her
  cheeks. Yet I thought that beneath them I saw a glint of purple flame. And de
  Keradel's hands covered his eyes, as though to shield them, but between his
  fingers I thought I saw them gleaming. He said:</p>

  <p>"Carnac&mdash;you have not asked me what is this Gatherer&mdash;this Being
  I would evoke in Its completeness. Is it because you know?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered; and would have followed by saying that I did not care
  except that suddenly I knew I did care; that of all things that was what I
  thirsted to know. He said:</p>

  <p>"A brilliant Englishman once formulated perfectly the materialistic credo.
  He said that the existence of man is an accident; his story a brief and
  transitory episode in the life of the meanest of planets. He pointed out that
  of the combination of causes which first converted a dead organic compound
  into the living progenitors of humanity, science as yet knows nothing. Nor
  would it matter if science did know. The wet-nurses of famine, disease, and
  mutual slaughter had gradually evolved creatures with consciousness and
  intelligence enough to know that they were insignificant. The history of the
  past was that of blood and tears, stupid acquiescence, helpless blunderings,
  wild revolt, and empty aspirations. And at last, the energies of our system
  will decay, the sun be dimmed, the inert and tideless earth be barren. Man
  will go down into the pit, and all his thoughts will perish. Matter will know
  itself no longer. Everything will be as though it never had been. And nothing
  will be either better or worse for all the labor, devotion, pity, love, and
  suffering of man."</p>

  <p>I said, the God-like sense of power stronger within me: "It is not
  true."</p>

  <p>"It is partly true," he answered. "What is not true is that life is an
  accident. What we call accident is only a happening of whose causes we are
  ignorant. Life must have come from life. Not necessarily such life as we know
  &mdash;but from some Thing, acting deliberately, whose essence was&mdash; and
  is&mdash;life. It is true that pain, agony, sorrow, hate, and discord are the
  foundations of humanity. It is true that famine, disease, and slaughter have
  been our nurses. Yet it is equally true that there are such things as peace,
  happiness, pity, perception of beauty, wisdom... although these may be only
  of the thickness of the film on the surface of a woodland pool which mirrors
  its flowered rim&mdash;yet, these things do exist... peace and beauty,
  happiness and wisdom. They are."</p>

  <p>"And therefore&mdash;" de Keradel's hands were still over his eyes, but
  through the masking fingers I felt his gaze sharpen upon me, penetrate me
  "&mdash;therefore I hold that these desirable things must be in That which
  breathed life into the primeval slime. It must be so, since that which is
  created cannot possess attributes other than those possessed by what creates
  it."</p>

  <p>Of course, I knew all that. Why should he waste effort to convince me of
  the obvious. I said, tolerantly: "It is self-evident."</p>

  <p>He said: "And therefore it must also be self-evident that since it was the
  dark, the malevolent, the cruel side of this&mdash;Being&mdash;which created
  us, our only approach to It, our only path to Its other self, must be through
  agony and suffering, cruelty and malevolence."</p>

  <p>He paused, then said, violently:</p>

  <p>"Is it not what every religion has taught? That man can approach his
  Creator only through suffering and sorrow? Sacrifice... Crucifixion!"</p>

  <p>I answered: "It is true. The baptism of blood. The purification through
  tears. Rebirth through sorrow."</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle murmured: "Chords that must be struck before we may attain
  the supreme harmonies."</p>

  <p>There was a mocking note to that; I turned to her quickly. She had not
  opened her eyes, but I caught the derisive curving of her lips.</p>

  <p>De Keradel said: "The sacrifices are ready."</p>

  <p>I said: "Then let us sacrifice!"</p>

  <p>De Keradel dropped his hands. The pupils of his eyes were phosphorescent,
  his face seemed to retreat until nothing could be seen but those two orbs of
  pale blue fire. The Demoiselle raised her eyes, and they were two deep pools
  of violet flame, her face a blur beyond them. I did not think that strange
  &mdash;then.</p>

  <p>There was a mirror at the back of the sideboard. I looked into it and my
  own eyes were shining with the same feral fires, golden, my face a blurred
  setting from which yellow gleaming eyes stared back at me...</p>

  <p>Nor did that seem as strange, either&mdash;not then.</p>

  <p>De Keradel repeated: "The sacrifices are ready."</p>

  <p>I said, rising: "Let us use them!"</p>

  <p>We went out of the dining room and up the stairs. The inhuman exaltation
  did not wane; it grew stronger; more ruthless. Life was to be taken, but what
  was the life of one or the lives of many if they were rungs of a ladder up
  which I could climb out of the pit into the sun? Force recognition from That
  which had lived before life... command It... the Creator?</p>

  <p>With de Keradel's hand upon my arm I passed into my room. He bade me strip
  and bathe, and left me, I stripped, and my hand touched something hanging to
  my left armpit. It was a holster in which was an automatic. I had forgotten
  who had given it to me, but whoever it was had told me it was important...
  most important; not to be lost nor given up... essential. I laughed. This toy
  essential to one about to summon the Creator of life? I tossed it into a
  corner of the room...</p>

  <p>De Keradel was beside me and I wondered vaguely why I had not seen him
  come into the room. I had bathed, and was stark naked. He was wrapping a
  breechclout of white cotton around my loins. He laced sandals on my feet, and
  he drew my arms through the sleeves of a robe of thick fine cotton. He stood
  back, and I saw that he was clothed in the same white robes. There was a
  broad belt either of black metal or ancient wood around his middle. There was
  a similar cincture around his breast. They were inlaid with symbolings in
  silver... but who ever saw silver shift and change outline... melt from this
  rune into another... as these did? Around his forehead was a black chaplet of
  oak leaves, and from his belt swung a long black knife, a black maul, a black
  and oval bowl, and a black ewer...</p>

  <p>Dahut was watching me, and I wondered why I had not seen her enter. She
  wore the robe of thick white cotton, but the girdle around her waist was of
  gold and on it the shifting symbols were red; and of red gold was the fillet
  that bound her hair and the bracelets upon her arms. In her hand was a golden
  sickle, razor-edged.</p>

  <p>They fastened around my waist another black and silver symboled belt, and
  set upon my head a chaplet of the black oak leaves. De Keradel drew from his
  belt the maul and put it in my hand. I shrank from its touch and dropped it.
  He picked it up and closed my fingers around it. I tried to unclose them and
  could not, although the touch of the maul was loathsome. I raised the maul
  and looked at it. It was heavy and black with age... like the belt... like
  the chaplet. It was shaped all of one piece as though carved from the heart
  of oak; shaft in center, ends of its massive head blunt.</p>

  <p>The <i>mael bennique</i>! The beater in of breasts! Heart crusher! And I
  knew that its blackness was less from age than from red baptisms.</p>

  <p>My exaltation ebbed. Something deep within me was stirring, tearing at its
  fetters, whispering to me... whispering that it had been to stop the beating
  of his maul that I had gone from Carnac long and long ago to slay Dahut...
  that whatever else I did I must not use the maul... but also that I must go
  on, go on as I had in... lost Ys meet and even steep myself in this ancient
  evil, so that... so that...</p>

  <p>De Keradel's face was thrust into mine, mouth snarling, hell-fire flaming
  in his eyes: "You are one with us, Bearer of the Maul!"</p>

  <p>Dahut's hand closed around mine; her cheek touched me. The exaltation
  swept back; the deep revolt forgotten. But some echo of it remained. I
  said:</p>

  <p>"I am one with you&mdash;but I will not wield the maul." Dahut's hand
  pressed and my fingers were loosed and I threw the thing from me.</p>

  <p>De Keradel said, deadly: "You do as I command. Pick up the maul."</p>

  <p>Dahut said, sweetly, but with voice as deadly as his own: "Patience, my
  father. He shall bear the bowl and the ewer and do with them as is
  prescribed. He shall feed the fires. Unless he wields the maul of his own
  will, it is useless. Be patient."</p>

  <p>He answered her, furiously: "Once before you betrayed a father for your
  lover."</p>

  <p>She said, steadily: "And may again... and if so what can you do, my
  father?"</p>

  <p>His face writhed; he half raised his arm as though to strike her. And then
  crept into his eyes that same fear as had shown there on the night we had met
  when he had spoken of Powers summoned to aid and obey, and she had
  added&mdash;"or to command us."</p>

  <p>His arm dropped. He picked up the maul, and gave to me the bowl and ewer.
  He said, sullenly: "Let us go."</p>

  <p>We went out of that room, he on one side of me and Dahut at the other.
  Down the stairs we went. A score of the servants were in the great hall. All
  wore the white robes and they held unlighted flambeaux. They sank upon their
  knees as we approached them. De Keradel pressed upon the wall and a section
  slid open, revealing wide stone steps winding down and down. Arm in arm,
  Dahut and de Keradel and I trod them, the servants behind us until we faced
  what seemed to be a wall of solid stone. Here again de Keradel pressed, and a
  part of the wall raised slowly and silently like a curtain.</p>

  <p>It had masked a portal to a vast chamber hewn out of the solid rock.
  Through the portal stole a penetrating pungent odor, and from beyond it came
  the murmur of many voices. The light that filled it was dim but crystal clear
  &mdash;like a forest twilight. There were a hundred or more men and women
  facing us, and their eyes wide-pupilled and blank&mdash;rapt&mdash; looking
  into another world. But they saw us. There were cubicles all around the
  cavern, and others came out of them, women who carried babies in their arms,
  women at whose skirts children clung. Babies and children were wide-eyed too,
  small faces rapt and impassive, dreaming. And men and women wore that ancient
  dress.</p>

  <p>De Keradel raised the maul and shouted to them. They answered the shout
  and rushed toward us, throwing themselves upon their faces as we drew near;
  crawling to and kissing my feet, the feet of de Keradel, the slim and
  sandaled feet of Dahut.</p>

  <p>De Keradel began a chant, low-voiced, vibrant&mdash;archaic. Dahut joined
  him, and my own throat answered... in that tongue I knew and did not know.
  The men and women lifted themselves to their knees. They joined, full
  throated, in the chant. They lifted themselves to their feet and stood
  swaying to its cadence. I studied them. They were gaunt-faced and old, most
  of them. Their garb was what I had known in ancient Carnac, but their faces
  were not those of Carnac's sacrifices.</p>

  <p>There was a glow in their breasts, over their hearts. But in too many it
  was dim and yellowed, flickering toward extinction. Only in the babies and
  the children was it clear and steady.</p>

  <p>I said to de Keradel: "Too many are old. The fire of life is dim within
  them. The essence of life which feeds the wicks runs too low. We need younger
  sacrifices&mdash;those in whom the fire of life is strong."</p>

  <p>He answered: "Does it matter&mdash;so long as there is life to be
  eaten?"</p>

  <p>I said, angrily: "It does matter! We must have youth. Nor are these of the
  old blood."</p>

  <p>He looked at me for the first time since I had refused to pick up the
  maul. There was calculation in the glowing eyes, and satisfaction and
  approval. He looked at Dahut, and I saw her nod to him, and she murmured: "I
  am right, my father... he is one with us, but... patience."</p>

  <p>De Keradel said: "We shall have youth&mdash;later. All we need of it. But
  now we must do with what we have."</p>

  <p>Dahut touched my hand, and pointed. At the far end of the cavern a ramp
  led up to another door. She said:</p>

  <p>"Time goes&mdash;and we must do with what we have now."</p>

  <p>De Keradel took up the chant. We walked, the three of us, between the
  ranks of swaying, chanting men and women. The servants with the flambeaux
  fell in behind us and behind them trooped the singing sacrifices. We ascended
  the ramp. A door opened smoothly. We passed through it into the open air.</p>

  <p>De Keradel stepped ahead; his chanting fuller voiced; challenging. The
  night was cloudy and thin wisps of fog eddied around us. We crossed a broad
  open stretch and entered a grove of great oaks. The oaks sighed and
  whispered; then their branches began to toss and their leaves soughed the
  chant. De Keradel raised his maul and saluted them. We passed out of the
  oaks.</p>

  <p>For an instant ancient time and this time and all times reeled around me.
  I stopped my chanting. I said, strangled: "Carnac&mdash;but it cannot be!
  Carnac was then... and this is now!"</p>

  <p>Dahut's arm was around my shoulders; Dahut's lips were upon mine; she
  whispered: "There is no then... there is no now... for us, beloved. And you
  are one with us."</p>

  <p>Yet still I stood and looked; while behind me the chanting became ever
  fainter, faltering and uncertain. For there was a level space before me over
  which great monoliths marched, not leaning nor fallen as at Carnac now, but
  lifting straight up, defiant, as in Carnac of old. Scores of them in avenues
  like the spokes of a tremendous wheel. They marched and circled to the
  gigantic dolmen, the Cairn, that was their heart. A crypt that was truly an
  Alkar-Az... greater than that which I had known in most ancient Carnac... and
  among and between the standing stones danced the wraiths of the fog... the
  fog was a huge inverted bowl covering the Cairn and the monoliths. And
  against the standing stones leaned shadows... the shadows of men...</p>

  <p>Dahut's hands touched my eyes, covered them. And abruptly all strangeness,
  all comparisons of memory, were gone. De Keradel had turned, facing the
  sacrifices, roaring out the chant, black maul raised high, the symbols on
  black belt and cincture dancing like quicksilver. I raised the bowl and ewer
  and roared the chant. The faltering voices gathered strength, roared out to
  meet us. Dahut's lips were again on mine... "Beloved, you are one with
  us."</p>

  <p>The oaks bent and waved their boughs and shouted the chant.</p>

  <p>The servants had lighted their flambeaux and stood like watching dogs on
  the fringes of the sacrifices. We entered the field of the monoliths. In
  front of me strode de Keradel, maul held high, raised to the Cairn as the
  priest raises the Host to the Altar. Dahut was beside me, singing...
  singing... her golden sickle uplifted. Thicker grew the walls of the great
  inverted bowl of the fog above and around us; and thicker grew the
  fog-wraiths dancing among and circling the monoliths. Darker became the
  shadows guarding the standing stones.</p>

  <p>And the sacrifices were circling the monoliths, dancing around them in the
  ancient measures as though hand in hand with the fog wraiths. The servants
  had quenched their torches, for now the corposants had begun to glimmer over
  the standing stones. The witch lights. The lamps of the dead. Faintly at
  first, but growing ever stronger. Glimmering, shifting orbs of gray
  phosphorescence of the grayness of the dead. Decaying lights, and
  putrescent.</p>

  <p>And now I stood before the great Cairn. I looked into its vault; empty;
  untenanted&mdash;as yet. Louder was the chanting as the sacrifices danced
  between and around the monoliths. Coming ever closer. And more lividly
  gleamed the corposants, lighting the path of the Gatherer.</p>

  <p>The chanting muted, became a prayer, an invocation... The sacrifices
  pressed upon me, swaying, murmuring, rapt eyes intent upon the Cairn... and
  seeing&mdash;what?</p>

  <p>There were three stones close to the entrance to the chamber of the Cairn.
  The middle one was a slab of granite, longer than a tall man, and at about
  where the shoulders of a man lying upon it would be there was a rounded ridge
  of stone like a pillow. It was stained&mdash;like the maul; and the stains
  ran down its sides. At its left was another stone, lower, squat, hollowed
  shallowly and channeled at its lower end as though to let some, liquid escape
  from it. And at the right of the long slab was a more deeply hollowed stone
  black with fire.</p>

  <p>There was a curious numbness creeping through me; a queer sense of
  detachment as though a part of me, and the most vital part, were stepping
  aside to watch some play in which another and less important self was to be
  an actor. At the same time, that lesser part knew perfectly well what it had
  to do. Two of the white robed servants handed me small bunches of twigs,
  small bundles of leaves, and two black bowls in which were yellow crystals
  and lumps of resinous gum. With the twigs I built the fire on the blackened
  altar as the ancient rites prescribed... well did I remember how the priests
  of Ys had made that fire before the Alkar-Az at Carnac...</p>

  <p>I struck the flint, and as the twigs blazed I cast on them leaves and
  crystals and gums. The strangely scented smoke arose and wound around us and
  then went streaming into the Cairn as though sucked by a strong draft.</p>

  <p>Dahut glided past me. There was a woman close by with a child in her arms.
  Dahut drew the child from her, unresisting, and glided back to the squat
  altar. Through the smoke I caught the flash of the golden sickle, and then de
  Keradel took the black bowl and ewer from me. He set them beneath the gutter
  of the squat altar. He gave them to me, and they were filled...</p>

  <p>I dipped my fingers into the bowl and sprinkled what filled it over the
  threshold of the Cairn. I took the ewer and poured what it held from side to
  side of that threshold. I went back to the altar of the fire and fed it from
  red hands.</p>

  <p>Now de Keradel was standing at the squat altar. He raised a small body in
  his arms, and cast it into the Cairn. Dahut was beside him, rigid, golden
  sickle upraised&mdash;but the sickle was no longer golden. It was red... like
  my hands...</p>

  <p>The smoke from the sacred fire swirled between and around us.</p>

  <p>De Keradel cried a word&mdash;and the chant of the prayer ended. A man
  shambled from the sacrifices, eyes wide and unwinking, face rapt. De Keradel
  caught him by the shoulders, and instantly two of the servants threw
  themselves upon this man, tore off his clothing and pressed him naked down
  upon the stone. His head fell behind the stone pillow&mdash;his chest
  strained over it. Swiftly de Keradel pressed upon a spot on the neck, and
  over the heart, and under the thighs. The sacrifice lay limp upon the slab...
  and de Keradel began to beat upon the naked lifted breast with the black
  maul. Slowly at first... then faster and faster... harder... to the ancient
  prescribed rhythm.</p>

  <p>There was a shrilling of agony from the man on the stone. As though fed by
  it, the corposants flared wanly. They pulsed and waned. The sacrifice was
  silent, and I knew that de Keradel had pressed fingers against his throat...
  the agony of the sacrifice must not be articulate since agony that is
  voiceless is hardest to bear, and therefore most acceptable to the
  Gatherer...</p>

  <p>The maul crashed down in the last stroke, splintering ribs and crushing
  heart. The smoke from the fire was swirling into the Cairn. De Keradel had
  raised the body of the sacrifice from the slab... held it high over his
  head...</p>

  <p>He hurled it into the Cairn, while fast upon its fall came the thud of a
  smaller body, hurled after it...</p>

  <p>From the hands of Dahut! And they were stained red and dripping&mdash;
  like my own.</p>

  <p>He gave them to me, and they were filled...</p>

  <p>There was a buzzing within the Cairn, like hundreds of carrion flies. Over
  the Cairn the fog blackened. A formless shadow dropped through the fog and
  gathered over the Cairn. It had no shape, and it had no place in space. It
  darkened the fog and it squatted upon the Cairn&mdash;yet I knew that it was
  but a part of Something that extended to the rim of the galaxy of which our
  world is a mote, our sun a spark... and beyond the rim of the galaxy...
  beyond the universe... beyond, where there is no such thing as space.</p>

  <p>It squatted upon the Cairn, but it did not enter.</p>

  <p>Again the golden sickle flashed in the hand of Dahut; and again de Keradel
  filled the ewer and the bowl and gave them to me. And again, numbly, I walked
  through the smoke of the altar fire and sprinkled the red drops from the bowl
  into the Cairn, and poured the red contents of the ewer from side to side of
  its threshold.</p>

  <p>De Keradel held up the black maul, and cried out once more. A woman came
  out of the sacrifices, an old woman, wrinkled and trembling. The acolytes of
  de Keradel stripped her, and he threw her upon the stone... and swung the
  black maul down upon her withered breasts... and again and again...</p>

  <p>And he swung her body up and out and through the portal of the Cairn...
  and others came running to him... and them he slew with the black maul... no
  longer black but dripping crimson... and hurled them into the Cairn...</p>

  <p>The squatting darkness on the Cairn was no longer there. It had seeped
  through the great stones that roofed it, but still its shadow stained the fog
  reaching up and up like a black Pillar. The chamber of the Cairn was thick
  with the Blackness. And the smoke from the altar fire no longer clothed Dahut
  and de Keradel and I, but streamed straight through into the Cairn.</p>

  <p>The buzzing ceased, all sound died everywhere, a silence that was like the
  silence of space before ever a sun was born took its place. All movement
  ceased. Even the drifting fog wraiths were motionless.</p>

  <p>But I knew that the formless darkness within the Cairn was aware of me.
  Was aware of me and weighing me with a thousand eyes. I felt its awareness,
  malignant&mdash;crueler beyond measurement than even human cruelty. Its
  awareness streamed out and flicked over me like tiny tentacles... like black
  butterflies testing me with their antennae.</p>

  <p>I was not afraid.</p>

  <p>Now the buzzing began again within the Cairn, rising higher and higher
  until it became a faint, sustained whispering.</p>

  <p>De Keradel was kneeling at the threshold, listening. Beside him stood
  Dahut, listening... sickle in hand... sickle no longer golden but red...</p>

  <p>There was a child upon the squat altar, crying&mdash;not yet dead...</p>

  <p>Abruptly the Cairn was empty... the fog above it empty of the shadow...
  the Gatherer gone.</p>

  <p>I was marching back between the standing stones, Dahut and de Keradel
  beside me. There were no corposants over the monoliths. The flambeaux flared
  in the hands of the servants. Behind us, chanting and swaying, danced those
  who were left of the sacrifices. We passed through the oaks, and they were
  silent. The curious numbness still held me, and I felt no horror of what I
  had seen or of what I had done.</p>

  <p>The house was before me. It was strange how its outlines wavered... how
  misty and unsubstantial they seemed...</p>

  <p>And now I was in my own room. The numbness that had deadened all emotional
  reactions during the evocation of the Gatherer was slowly giving way to
  something else not yet defined, not yet strong enough to be known. The
  exaltation which had followed the green drink ebbed and flowed in steadily
  decreasing waves. I had an overpowering sense of unreality&mdash;I moved,
  unreal, among unreal things. What had become of my robe of white? I
  remembered that de Keradel had stripped it from me but where and when I could
  not think. And my hands were clean&mdash;no longer red with blood... the
  blood of...</p>

  <p>Dahut was with me, feet bare, white skin gleaming through a silken shift
  that held no concealment. The violet fires still flickered faintly in her
  eyes. She put her arms around my neck, drew my face down to hers, set her
  mouth on mine. She whispered: "Alan... I have forgotten Alain de Carnac... he
  has paid for what he did, and he is dying... it is you, Alan&mdash;you that I
  love... "</p>

  <p>I held her in my arms, and within them I felt the Lord of Carnac die. But
  I, Alan Caranac, was not yet awake.</p>

  <p>My arms closed tighter around her... there was the fragrance of some
  secret flower of the sea about her... and there was the sweetness of new-
  learned or long forgotten evil in her kisses...</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17"></a>17. &mdash; THE BOWL OF SACRIFICE</h2>

  <p class="first">I awakened as though escaping from some singularly
  unpleasant dream. I could not remember what the dream had been, but I knew it
  had been rotten. It was a stormy day, the surges hammering against the rocky
  shores, the wind wailing, and the light that came through the windows was
  gray. I raised my left arm to look at my watch, but it was not there. Nor was
  it on the table beside the bed. My mouth was dry, and my skin was dry and
  hot. I felt as though I had been drunk for two days.</p>

  <p>Worst of all was my fear that I would remember the dream.</p>

  <p>I sat up in bed. Something was missing besides my watch&mdash;the gun
  under my armpit&mdash;McCann's gun. I lay back, and tried to remember. There
  had been a green drink which had sparkled and effervesced&mdash;after that,
  nothing. There was a fog between the green drink and now. The fog hid what I
  feared to have uncovered.</p>

  <p>Fog had been in the dream. The pistol had been in the dream, too. When I
  had taken the green drink I still had the gun. There was a flash of memory
  &mdash;after the drink the gun had seemed absurd, unconsequential and I had
  thrown it into a corner. I jumped out of the bed to look for it.</p>

  <p>My foot struck against a black and oval bowl. Not all black&mdash;there
  were stains along its sides, and inside it was a viscous scum.</p>

  <p>The bowl of sacrifice!</p>

  <p>Abruptly the fog lifted and there was the dream... if dream it had been...
  stark and clear in each dread detail. I recoiled from it, not only sick of
  soul but nauseated of body...</p>

  <p>If it had been no dream, then was I damned and trebly damned. If I had not
  killed, I had acquiesced in killing. If I had not beaten in the breasts of
  the sacrifices with my own hands, I had not lifted a hand to save them
  &mdash;and I had fed the fires that were their funeral torches.</p>

  <p>Equally with Dahut and de Keradel, I had summoned that black and evil
  Power... equally with them I was murderer, torturer... thrall of Hell.</p>

  <p>What was there to prove it dream? Illusion suggested by de Keradel and
  Dahut while my will lay quiescent under the spell of the green drink?
  Desperately out of the damning memories I tried to sift some evidence that it
  had been only dream. There had been the flaring of the feral phosphorescence
  in their eyes&mdash;and in mine. A physiological peculiarity which man does
  not commonly possess, nor could any drink create the layer of cells which
  causes it. Nor does humanity bear within its breasts, over its hearts,
  perceptible lumens bright in youth and dimmed and yellow in age. Yet they had
  glowed in the breasts of the sacrifices!</p>

  <p>Nor where except in dream do oaks chant as though their leafed boughs had
  voices?</p>

  <p>But&mdash;there was the blood-stained bowl! Could that materialize from a
  dream?</p>

  <p>No... but de Keradel or Dahut might have placed it there to make me,
  waking, believe the dream had been real. And dream or no dream&mdash;I was
  tainted with their evil.</p>

  <p>I got up and searched for the automatic. I found it in the corner of the
  room where I had tossed it. Well, that much had been true. I strapped the
  holster under my arm. My head felt like a hive, my brain a honeycomb in and
  out of which lame bees of thought went buzzing aimlessly. But a cold,
  implacable hatred, a loathing of de Keradel and his witch-daughter held
  steady in the shaken fabric of my mind.</p>

  <p>The rain lashed the windows, and the gale cried around the old house.
  Somewhere a clock struck a single clanging note. Whether it was the half-hour
  or the full I could not tell. A straight thought struck through the aimless
  ones. I took a pinch of the leaves out of the holster and chewed them. They
  were exceedingly bitter, but I swallowed them&mdash;and almost instantly my
  head was clear.</p>

  <p>There was no use in hunting out de Keradel and killing him. In the first
  place, I could give no real defense for doing so. Not unless there was a heap
  of bodies in the Cairn, and I could open the cavern of the paupers. I had not
  the slightest belief that I could find that cavern or that there would be any
  bodies. Killing de Keradel would seem the act of a madman, and for doing so a
  madhouse would be the best I could expect. Also, if I killed him, there would
  yet be the blank-eyed servants to reckon with.</p>

  <p>And Dahut... I doubted whether I could shoot down Dahut in cold blood. If
  I did there still would be the servants. They would kill me... and I had no
  especial desire to die. The face of Helen came before me... and still less
  did I desire to die.</p>

  <p>Also, there was the necessity of knowing whether what I had been
  visualizing had been dream or reality. It was most necessary that I know
  that.</p>

  <p>Someway, somehow, I must get in touch with McCann. Whether dream or
  reality, I must continue to play the game, not allow myself to be trapped
  again. At any rate, at first I must seem to believe in its reality; convince
  de Keradel that I did so believe. For no other reason could he or Dahut have
  left the bowl beside my bed.</p>

  <p>I dressed, and picked up the bowl and went downstairs, holding it behind
  me. De Keradel was at the table, but the Demoiselle was not. I saw that it
  was a little after one. He looked up at me, sharply, as I sat and said: "I
  trust you slept well. I gave order that you should not be disturbed. It is a
  desolate day, and my daughter sleeps late."</p>

  <p>I laughed: "She should&mdash;after last night."</p>

  <p>He asked: "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"No need to fence longer with me, de Keradel," I answered, "after last
  night."</p>

  <p>He asked, slowly: "What do you remember of last night?"</p>

  <p>"Everything, de Keradel. Everything&mdash;from your convincing
  disquisition upon the dark begetting of life, its darker delivery, its
  darkest evolution&mdash;and the proof of it in what we summoned to the
  Cairn."</p>

  <p>He said: "You have dreamed."</p>

  <p>"Did I dream this?"</p>

  <p>I set the stained bowl upon the table. His eyes widened; he looked from it
  to me and back again to the bowl. He asked: "Where did you find that?"</p>

  <p>I answered: "Beside my bed. When I awoke not long ago."</p>

  <p>The veins upon his temples swelled and began to throb; he whispered: "Now
  why did she do that..."</p>

  <p>I said: "Because she is wiser than you. Because she knows I should be told
  the truth. Because she trusts me."</p>

  <p>He said: "As once before she trusted you&mdash;and to her cost and to her
  father's."</p>

  <p>"When I was Lord of Carnac," I laughed. "The Lord of Carnac died last
  night. She told me so."</p>

  <p>He looked at me, long: "How did the Lord of Carnac die?"</p>

  <p>I answered, brutally: "In your daughter's arms. And now she prefers
  &mdash;me."</p>

  <p>He pushed back his chair, walked to the window and stared out at the
  driving rain. He came back to the table and sat quietly down: "Caranac, what
  did you dream?"</p>

  <p>I said: "A waste of time to answer that. If it was a dream, you dictated
  it, and therefore know. If it was no dream, you were there."</p>

  <p>He said: "Nevertheless, I ask you to tell me."</p>

  <p>I studied him. There was something strange about this request, made
  apparently in all sincerity. It threw a totally unexpected monkey-wrench of
  doubt into the simple machinery of my deductions. I sparred for time.</p>

  <p>"After I've eaten," I answered.</p>

  <p>Not once while I breakfasted did he speak to me; nor, when I looked at
  him, were his eyes on me. He seemed deep in not particularly pleasant
  thoughts. I tried to fish the monkey-wrench out of my calculations. His
  surprise and anger when I produced the bowl had seemed genuine. If so, then
  obviously he had not put it beside me. Therefore it was not he who had wished
  to awaken my memory&mdash;either of dream or reality.</p>

  <p>Then it must have been Dahut. But why should she want me to remember if
  her father did not? The only answer seemed to be that they were in conflict.
  Yet it might mean something else, far wider reaching. I had respect for de
  Keradel's mentality. I did not believe he would ask me to tell him something
  he already knew. At least not without a reason. Did his question mean that he
  had taken no part in the summoning of the Gatherer? That there had been no
  sacrifices... that all had been illusion... and that he had taken no part in
  the creation of the illusion?</p>

  <p>That all had been the work of Dahut alone?</p>

  <p>But wait! Might it not also mean that the green drink, after it changed me
  into what I had become, had also been supposed to make me forget? And that
  for some reason I had been partly immune to its effect? That now de Keradel
  wanted to know to what extent it had failed... to compare my memories with
  what he knew had occurred?</p>

  <p>Yet there was the bowl... and twice I had seen fear in his eyes when Dahut
  had spoken to him... and what was the rift between the pair... and how could
  I take advantage of it?</p>

  <p>Could anyone except Dahut have left beside me the sacrificial bowl... any
  thing...</p>

  <p>I heard the voice of Ralston changing to the buzzing of a fly... I heard
  Dick's voice crying out to me... Beware, beware of Dahut... give me
  release... from the Gatherer... Alan.</p>

  <p>And the room darkened as though the dripping clouds had grown heavier...
  or had filled with shadows...</p>

  <p>I said: "Dismiss the servants, de Keradel. I'll tell you."</p>

  <p>And when he had done so, I did tell him. He listened without interrupting,
  expression unchanged, pale eyes now glancing out of the windows, now fixed on
  mine. When I was through, he asked, smiling:</p>

  <p>"Do you think it dream&mdash;or real?"</p>

  <p>"There is this&mdash;" I threw the stained bowl on the table.</p>

  <p>He took it, and examined it, thoughtfully. He said:</p>

  <p>"Let us first assume your experiences were real. Under that assumption, I
  am sorcerer, warlock, priest of evil. And I do not like you. Not only do I
  not like you, but I do not trust you. I am not deceived by your apparent
  conversion to our aims and purposes. I know that you came here only because
  of your fear of what might befall your friends if you did not. In short, I am
  fully aware of my daughter's command to you, and what led up to it. I could
  get rid of you. Very easily. And would, were it not for one obstacle. My
  daughter's love for you. In awakening those memories which were her most
  ancient mother's in Ys... in resolving her into that ancient Dahut...
  obviously I could not pick and choose among her memories. They must, for my
  purposes, be complete. I must revive them all. Unfortunately, the Lord of
  Carnac was in them. Most unfortunately she met you, whose ancient father was
  that same Lord of Carnac. To destroy you would mean a complete and most
  probably abortive rearrangement of all my plans. It would infuriate her. She
  would become my enemy. Therefore you&mdash;continue to be. Is this
  plain?"</p>

  <p>"Admirably so," I said.</p>

  <p>"What then&mdash;still assuming I am what you think&mdash;am I to do?
  Obviously, make you <i>particeps criminis</i>. A partner in my crimes. You
  cannot denounce me without denouncing yourself. I give you a certain drink
  which deadens your inhibitions against this and that. You become <i>particeps
  criminis</i>. Helpless to denounce, unless you want the same halter around
  your neck as would encircle mine. Doubtless," he said, courteously, "all this
  has occurred to you."</p>

  <p>"It has," I answered. "But I would like to put a few questions to you
  &mdash;in your character of sorcerer, warlock, priest of evil&mdash; assumed
  or otherwise, of course."</p>

  <p>"In that character," he said gravely, "ask."</p>

  <p>"Did you bring about the death of Ralston?"</p>

  <p>"I did not," he said. "My daughter did. It is she who commands the
  shadows."</p>

  <p>"Was the shadow which whispered him to his death&mdash;real?"</p>

  <p>"Real enough to cause his death," he replied.</p>

  <p>"You become ambiguous," I said. "I asked was it real?"</p>

  <p>He smiled: "There is evidence that he thought so."</p>

  <p>"And the other three?"</p>

  <p>"Equally as real. It was the unexpected linking of those cases by Dr.
  Bennett that prompted our visit to Lowell... an exceedingly unfortunate
  visit, I repeat, since it resulted in my daughter meeting you. The admission,
  Caranac, is in my character of warlock, only."</p>

  <p>"Why, in that character, did you kill them?"</p>

  <p>"Because we were temporarily in need of funds. You will recall there was
  difficulty in getting gold out of Europe. We had killed many times before
  &mdash;in England, in France, and otherwhere. Dahut needs amusement&mdash; so
  do her shadows. And they must feed&mdash;now and then."</p>

  <p>Could he be speaking truth&mdash;or was he playing with me? I said,
  coldly, hoping to bomb him out of his calm:</p>

  <p>"You profit well by your daughter's whoredom."</p>

  <p>He laughed outright at that: "What is whoredom to one who is warlock,
  sorcerer, and priest of evil?"</p>

  <p>"Those who marched last night to the Cairn&mdash;still assuming these
  sacrifices reality&mdash;the paupers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted me: "Paupers! Why do you call them that?"</p>

  <p>Now I laughed: "Aren't they?" He recovered his poise: "Always under the
  same conditions of response, the majority of them, yes. And now you would ask
  me how I&mdash;collected&mdash;them. That, my dear Caranac, was remarkably
  simple. It involved only the bribing of an orderly or two, the administering
  to the paupers of a certain drug, a little whispering to them by my
  daughter's shadows, their slipping away under the guidance of those shadows
  to where my boat lay waiting for them. And they were here&mdash;and very
  happy to be here I assure you... between sacrifices."</p>

  <p>He asked, suavely: "Have I given tangible form to the vaguest of your
  suspicions, hardened into certainty those not so vague? Is not all this
  credible conduct for a sorcerer and his witch-daughter?"</p>

  <p>I did not answer. He said:</p>

  <p>"Speaking still in this capacity, my dear Caranac, assuming that you leave
  here, tell this story to others, bring down upon me man's law&mdash;what
  would happen? They would find no sacrifices, either dead in the Cairn or
  alive in the Cavern. There would be no Cavern. I have provided for all that.
  They would find only a peaceful scientist, one of whose hobbies is to
  reproduce Carnac in miniature. He would show them his standing stones. His
  entirely charming daughter would accompany and entertain them. You&mdash;if
  you were here&mdash;would be merely a lunatic dissonance. Whether you were
  here or not&mdash;what would happen to you thereafter? You would not die...
  but very heartily would you wish to die... if mind enough remained to
  formulate a wish."</p>

  <p>His lips were smiling, but his eyes were pale blue ice: "I am still
  speaking as sorcerer, of course."</p>

  <p>I asked: "Why did you come here for your experiment, de Keradel? Could you
  not have carried it on better in Carnac, before the ancient Cairn&mdash;the
  path to which the Gatherer knew well?"</p>

  <p>He answered: "All paths are known to the Gatherer. And how could I have
  had freedom to open that ancient path in a land where memory still lingers?
  Where could I have gotten the sacrifices&mdash;or carried on the ritual
  without interruption? It was not possible. Therefore I came here. Where the
  Gatherer is unknown&mdash;as yet."</p>

  <p>I nodded; that was reasonable enough. I asked, bluntly:</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to gain?"</p>

  <p>He laughed: "You are too naive, Caranac. That I will not tell you."</p>

  <p>Anger and remorse swept away my caution; I said:</p>

  <p>"You'll never have my aid again in that black work, de Keradel."</p>

  <p>"So!" he said, slowly. "So! And so I thought. But I will not need you
  again, Caranac. The rapprochement last night was almost perfect. So
  perfect... that I may not even need... again... Dahut."</p>

  <p>He had said that last musingly, more as though sealing by words a secret
  thought than speaking to me. And once more I had the feeling of dissension
  between the two... and fear of Dahut driving him... driving him to
  what?...</p>

  <p>He leaned back and roared laughter; his eyes and lips both laughing,
  without malice or evil.</p>

  <p>"That is one side of the matter, Dr. Caranac. And now I give you the other
  side, the commonsense side. I am an able psychiatrist, and adventurous. I am
  an explorer, but not of the jungles nor the deserts of this world. I explore
  the brains of men, which are thousands of worlds. Mostly, I admit, they are
  distressingly similar; yet now and then there is one sufficiently different
  to justify the labor of exploration. Let us suppose that I have heard of you
  &mdash;as a matter of fact, Caranac, I know the history of your family better
  than you do yourself. Still, I have no desire to meet you until I read your
  interview in the case of this Ralston, whom I knew not at all. It arouses my
  curiosity, and I decide to explore&mdash;you. What is my best approach
  without exciting your suspicions? The most favorable, unguarded entrance into
  the particular territory of your brain which I wish to survey? I read that
  you are a friend of Dr. Bennett, who has interesting ideas upon the death of
  this same Ralston and others. I read that he is with Dr. Lowell, a brother
  psychiatrist upon whom I have long been intending to call. So I do call upon
  him, and what more natural that I should receive a dinner invitation for
  myself and my daughter. And, as I expect, there are you and Dr. Bennett.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. You are a connoisseur of warlocks, a student of sorcery.
  I turn the conversation in that direction. You have spoken to the pressmen of
  shadows, and to my delight I find that Dr. Bennett is obsessed by the same
  idea. Better still, he is half-convinced of sorcery's reality. You two are so
  thoroughly en rapport that not only do I find entrance to your mind doubly
  easy, but his also open to me."</p>

  <p>He paused as though inviting comment. I made none. Something of the
  amiability faded from his face. He said: "I have called myself an explorer of
  minds, Caranac. I can cut my trails through them even as other explorers cut
  theirs through the jungles. Better. Because I can control the&mdash;
  vegetation."</p>

  <p>Again he paused, and when again I made no comment, asked with edge of
  irritation: "You understand me?"</p>

  <p>I nodded: "I follow you perfectly." I did not add that not only did I
  follow him but was a bit ahead of him... a thought was forming in my
  mind.</p>

  <p>He said: "I now suggest to you&mdash;in my character of psychiatrist,
  Caranac, not of sorcerer&mdash;that my whole experiment has been centered
  upon awakening those memories which have come down to you from ancestors who
  did make sacrifices to a Demon-god. Those very sacrifices in which last night
  it seemed to you that you participated. That what you thought you saw upon
  the Cairn and within the Cairn was the image of that Demon-god the
  imaginations of your ancestors created long centuries ago... that, and
  nothing more. I suggest that from the moment we met, little which has seemed
  reality to you has been wholly so&mdash;a tapestry of dark ancestral memories
  and innocent realities of which I have been the weaver. There is no
  Gatherer... there are no creeping Shadows... no hidden lair beneath this
  house. My daughter, who shares in my experiments, is in truth what sometimes
  she has seemed to you to be... a woman of today's world, sophisticated,
  certainly, but no more witch nor harlot than the Helen you called your
  antique coin. And finally, that you are a guest here, only. No prisoner, and
  under no compulsion to remain other than your own imagination&mdash;
  stimulated, as I have admitted, by my own passion for research."</p>

  <p>He added with barely discernible irony: "And my daughter's."</p>

  <p>Now it was I who walked to the window, and stood with my back to him.
  Absently, I noted that the rain had stopped and the sun was breaking through
  the clouds. He was lying&mdash;but in which of his two interpretations were
  the lies the fewer? No sorcerer could have set the stage of Dahut's towers in
  New York and Ys, nor have directed my experiences there, real or imagined;
  nor been fugleman to what had happened after the rites of last night. Only a
  sorceress could have managed those things.</p>

  <p>Also, there were other weak spots to that second explanation. But the one
  indissoluble rock on which it split was that McCann, flying over this place,
  had also seen the corposants, the rotting lights of the dead... had seen the
  black and formless shape squatting upon the Cairn... glimpsed figures weaving
  among the standing stones before the fog had covered all.</p>

  <p>Which of the two stories did de Keradel want me to believe? Which was it
  better for me to pretend to believe? That he had never really trusted me, I
  knew. Was this a sort of Lady or the Tiger trap? Which door ought I open?</p>

  <p>The thought that had been forming in my mind grew clear. I turned to him
  with what I hoped was the precise mixture of chagrin and admiration. I
  said:</p>

  <p>"Frankly, de Keradel, I don't know whether to be disappointed or relieved.
  After all, you know, you did take me up on the mountain and show me the
  kingdoms of Earth, and a part of me rejoiced exceedingly at the prospect and
  was perfectly willing to sign over to you. If a tenderer part is set at ease
  because it was mirage, still the sterner part wishes it had been true. And I
  am divided between resentment that you should make me the subject of such an
  experiment, and admiration for your perfect workmanship."</p>

  <p>I sat down and added, carelessly: "I take it that now you have made
  everything plain, the experiment is ended."</p>

  <p>The pale blue eyes dwelt upon me; he answered, slowly: "It is ended
  &mdash;so far as I am concerned."</p>

  <p>Well did I know it wasn't, and well did I know I was as much a prisoner as
  ever; but I lighted a cigarette, and asked: "I suppose, then, I am free to go
  whenever I choose?"</p>

  <p>"An unnecessary question," the pale eyes narrowed, "if you have accepted
  my commonsense interpretation of your experiences."</p>

  <p>I laughed: "It was an echo of my servitude to you. One does not so quickly
  feel himself free of such fetters of illusion as you forge, de Keradel. By
  the way, I'd like to send a telegram to Dr. Bennett."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "but the storm has broken the wire between us and
  the village."</p>

  <p>I said: "I am sure it has. But what I would like to wire Dr. Bennett is
  that I like it here, and intend to remain as long as I am welcome. That the
  matter in which we have been so interested has been explained to my complete
  satisfaction, and to drop it. That there is nothing for him to worry about,
  and that I will amplify all this later by letter."</p>

  <p>Pausing, I looked him straight in the eyes: "We would collaborate in that
  letter&mdash;you and I."</p>

  <p>He leaned back, appraising me with expressionless face, but I had not
  missed the flicker of astonishment when I had made my proposal. He was
  nibbling at the bait, although he had not yet swallowed it. He asked:</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because of you," I said, and walked over to him: "De Keradel, I want to
  stay here. With you. But not as one held by ancestral memories. Not by an
  imagination stimulated or guided by you or your daughter. Nor by suggestion
  nor sorcery. I want to stay here wide-awake and all myself. Nor have the
  charms of your daughter anything to do with that desire. I care little for
  women, de Keradel, except for the naked lady they name Truth. It is because
  of you, solely because of you, that I want to stay."</p>

  <p>Again he asked: "Why?"</p>

  <p>But he had taken the bait. His guard had dropped. Every symphony has its
  chord, and every chord its dominant note. So has every man and every woman.
  Discover that note, and learn just how and when to sound it&mdash;and man or
  woman is yours. De Keradel's dominant was vanity&mdash;egotism. I struck it
  heavily.</p>

  <p>"Never, I think, has a de Carnac named a de Keradel&mdash;Master. Never
  asked to sit at a de Keradel's feet and learn. I know enough of the histories
  of our clans to be sure of that. Well, it has come to pass. All my life I
  have sought to lift Truth's veil. I think you can do that, de Keradel.
  Therefore&mdash;I would stay."</p>

  <p>He asked, curiously: "Which of my two stories do you believe?"</p>

  <p>I laughed: "Both and neither. Otherwise would I deserve to be your
  acolyte?"</p>

  <p>He said, almost wistfully: "I wish I could trust you... Alain de Carnac!
  There is much that we could do together."</p>

  <p>I answered: "Whether you trust me or do not, I cannot see how I, being
  here, can harm you. If I should disappear or, for example, appear to have
  killed myself or seem to have gone insane... that, of course, might harm
  you."</p>

  <p>He shook his head, absently; with a chillingly convincing indifference: "I
  could be rid of you very easily, de Carnac and there would be no necessity of
  explanations, but I wish I could trust you."</p>

  <p>I said: "If you have nothing to lose by it&mdash;why not?"</p>

  <p>He said, slowly: "I will."</p>

  <p>He picked up the bowl of sacrifice in his hands, and weighed it. He
  dropped it on the table. Stretching both hands out toward me but without
  touching me, he did with them that to which, knowing what was in my heart
  against him, I could not respond. It was an immemorially ancient gesture, a
  holy gesture that had been taught to me in Tibet by a lama whose life I had
  saved... and the way de Keradel made that gesture defiled it, although it
  still held within it the obligation... an obligation beyond life.</p>

  <p>Dahut saved me. A sudden flood of sunshine poured into the room. She came
  through toward us. If anything could have made me believe without
  reservation, de Keradel's second and commonsense version it would have been
  Dahut walking through that sunshine. She had on her riding breeches and
  boots, and a sea-green silk shirt that just matched the color of her eyes,
  and a beret on her silver gilt hair that was exactly the same green. Coming
  through the sunshine toward me like this, she knocked de Keradel and
  everything else out of my head.</p>

  <p>She said: "Hello, Alan. It's cleared. Let's take a canter."</p>

  <p>She saw the bowl of sacrifice. Her eyes dilated so that I could see the
  whites both above and below them... and how the orchid hell sparks
  danced...</p>

  <p>De Keradel's face whitened. Then comprehension came into it... a warning,
  a message, darted from him to her. The Demoiselle's lids dropped, the long
  lashes swept her cheeks. All this in a split second. I said, carelessly, as
  though I had observed nothing:</p>

  <p>"Fine. I'll change my clothes."</p>

  <p>I had known damned well that de Keradel hadn't put that bowl of sacrifice
  beside me. Now I knew just as damned well that Dahut hadn't, either.</p>

  <p>Then who had?</p>

  <p>I stepped into my room... again I seemed to hear the buzzing... Alan,
  beware of Dahut...</p>

  <p>Maybe the shadows were going to be kind to me again.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18"></a>18. &mdash; THE HOUNDS OF DAHUT</h2>

  <p class="first">Whatever the mystery of the bowl, Dahut's invitation was a
  break I hadn't hoped for. I got into my riding togs with haste. I had the
  idea that the conversation between her and her father would not be entirely
  amicable, and I didn't want her to have time to change her mind about that
  gallop. Probably I would not be able to get to the village, but I ought to be
  able to make the rock where the patient fishermen waited.</p>

  <p>I wrote a note to McCann: "Be at the rock tonight from eleven until four.
  If I don't show up, be there tomorrow night between the same hours. Same
  holds for night after tomorrow. If you then haven't heard from me, tell
  Ricori I say to use his own judgment."</p>

  <p>Ricori should have landed by then. And if by then I had not been able to
  get a message to McCann, it would mean that I was in a tight corner&mdash;
  if, indeed, I was in any shape to be in any corner whatsoever. I banked upon
  Ricori's resourcefulness and ruthlessness as adequate to meet de Keradel's
  own. Also, he would act swiftly. I wrote the note in duplicate, since after
  all I might be able to get to the village. I put one in a two ounce bottle,
  stoppering it tightly. The other I put it my pocket.</p>

  <p>I went downstairs whistling, giving artless warning of my approach. I went
  into the room as though I had not a care nor a suspicion in the world. Nor
  was I entirely acting; I did have a heady sense of elation; somewhat like
  that of a fighter who has lost round after round with an opponent whose style
  has been devastatingly unfamiliar, but who suddenly gets the key to it and
  knows he can meet it.</p>

  <p>The Demoiselle was standing beside the fireplace, switching at her boots
  with her quirt. De Keradel was still at the table's head, scrunched down a
  bit, more stolid than I had seen him. The bowl of sacrifice was nowhere in
  sight. The Demoiselle was rather like a beautiful wasp; De Keradel a quite
  small Gibraltar repelling stings. I laughed as that comparison came into my
  head.</p>

  <p>Dahut said: "You are gay."</p>

  <p>I said: "Indeed I am. Gayer than&mdash;" I looked at de Keradel "-than I
  have been for years."</p>

  <p>She did not miss that look, nor his faint answering smile. She said: "Let
  us go. You are sure you will not join us, my father?"</p>

  <p>De Keradel shook his head: "I have much to do."</p>

  <p>We went out to the stables. She took the same leggy bay, and I the roan.
  For a time she rode a little ahead of me, silent; then dropped back. She
  said: "You are as gay as though you rode to meet a loved woman."</p>

  <p>I said: "I hope to meet her. But not on this ride, Dahut."</p>

  <p>She whispered: "Is it&mdash;Helen?"</p>

  <p>"No, Dahut&mdash;although Helen has many of her attributes."</p>

  <p>"Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know her very well, Dahut. She wears no clothes, except a veil
  over her face. Her name is Truth. Your father has promised me to lift her
  veil."</p>

  <p>She reined closer; grasped my wrist: "He promised that&mdash;to you?"</p>

  <p>I said, casually: "Yes. And he rather more than intimated that he need not
  call you in to assist."</p>

  <p>"Why do you tell me this?" Her fingers tightened on my wrist.</p>

  <p>"Because, Dahut, I am exceedingly anxious to meet this naked lady Truth
  with no veil over her face. And I have a feeling that unless from now on I
  answer all questions with perfect candor, our meeting will be delayed."</p>

  <p>She said, dangerously: "Do not play with me. Why did you tell me
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I am not playing with you at all, Dahut. I am only being bluntly honest.
  So much so that I will give you my secondary reason."</p>

  <p>"And that?"</p>

  <p>"Divide&mdash;and rule," I answered.</p>

  <p>She stared at me, uncomprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"They tell a story in India," I said. "It is one of their jatakas or
  animal fables. Tiger Queen and Lion King could not agree. Their enmity upset
  the jungle. At last they made a bargain. They were to sit on the pans of a
  balance suspended just over a pool filled with crocodiles. The heavier one
  obviously would drop into the water, to the delight of the crocodiles. Tiger
  Queen and Lion King sat on the scales. Each weighed exactly the same. But an
  ant had hidden himself mid-beam with a grain of sand in his mandibles. 'Ho!'
  he cried. 'Who bids? And what is bid?' Thus he cried, this humble ant, to
  Tiger Queen and Lion King. And a grain of sand in his mandibles was life or
  death to one of them."</p>

  <p>Dahut asked, breathlessly: "Which lived?"</p>

  <p>I laughed: "The story does not say."</p>

  <p>She knew what I now meant, and I watched the color creep into her cheeks
  and the sparks dance in her eyes. She dropped my wrist. She said:</p>

  <p>"My father is truly pleased with you, Alan."</p>

  <p>"I think you told me that once before, Dahut&mdash;but no gaiety
  followed."</p>

  <p>She whispered: "And I seem to have heard you speaking like this before...
  and there was no gaiety thereafter for me... " Again she grasped my
  wrist:</p>

  <p>"But I am not pleased, Alan."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Dahut."</p>

  <p>She said: "Despite his wisdom, my father is rather ingenuous. But I am
  not."</p>

  <p>"Fine," I said, heartily. "Nor am I. I loath ingenuousness. But I have not
  as yet observed any naivete about your father."</p>

  <p>Her grip upon my wrist tightened: "This Helen... how much does she
  resemble the naked but veiled lady of your quest?"</p>

  <p>My pulse leaped: I could not help it; she felt it. She said, sweetly: "You
  do not know? You have had no opportunity, I take it, for... comparison."</p>

  <p>There was mercilessness in the rippling of the little waves of her
  laughter: "Continue to be gay, my Alan. Perhaps, some day, I shall give you
  that opportunity."</p>

  <p>She tapped her horse with her crop, and cantered off. I ceased feeling
  gay. Why the devil had I allowed Helen to be brought into the talk? Not
  choked mention of her off at the beginning? I followed close behind Dahut,
  but she did not look at me, nor speak. We went along for a mile or two, and
  came out on that haunted meadow of the crouching bushes. Here she seemed to
  regain her good-humor, dropped back beside me. She said:</p>

  <p>"Divide&mdash;and rule. It is a wise saying, that. Whose is it, Alan?"</p>

  <p>I said: "So far as I know, some old Roman's. Napoleon quoted it."</p>

  <p>"The Romans were wise, very wise. Suppose I told my father that you had
  put this thought into my head?"</p>

  <p>I said, indifferently: "Why not? Yet if it has not already occurred to
  him, why forearm him against yourself?"</p>

  <p>She said, thoughtfully: "You are strangely sure of yourself today."</p>

  <p>"If I am," I answered, "it is because there is nothing but the truth in
  me. So if there are any questions upon the tip of your lovely tongue whose
  truthful answers might offend your beautiful ears&mdash;do not ask them of
  me."</p>

  <p>She bent her head, and went scudding over the meadow. We came to the
  breast of rock which I had scaled on our first ride. I dropped from my horse
  and began to climb. I reached the top, and turning, saw that she, too, had
  dismounted and was looking up at me, irresolutely. I waved to her, and sat
  down upon the rock. The fishing boat was a few hundred yards away. I threw a
  stone or two idly into the water, then flipped out the small bottle in which
  was the note to McCann. One of the men stood up, stretched, and began to pull
  up the anchors. I called out to him: "Any luck?"</p>

  <p>Dahut was standing beside me. A ray of the setting sun struck the neck of
  the small bottle, and it glinted. She watched it for a moment, looked at the
  fishermen, then at me. I said: "What is that? A fish?" And threw a stone at
  the glint. She did not answer; stood studying the men in the boat. They rowed
  between us and the bottle, turned the breast of rock and passed out of sight.
  The bottle still glinted, rising and falling in the swell.</p>

  <p>She half lifted her hand, and I could have sworn that a ripple shot across
  the water straight to the bottle, and an eddy caught it, sending it swirling
  toward us.</p>

  <p>I stood up, and caught her by the shoulders, raised her face to mine and
  kissed her. She clung to me, quivering. I took her hands, and they were cold,
  and helped her down the breast of rock. Toward the bottom, I lifted her in my
  arms and carried her. I set her on her feet beside her horse. Her long
  fingers slipped around my throat, half-strangling me; she pressed her lips to
  mine in a kiss that left me breathless. She leaped on the bay and gave it the
  quirt, mercilessly. She was off over the meadow, swift as a racing
  shadow.</p>

  <p>I looked after her, stupidly. I mounted the roan...</p>

  <p>I hesitated, wondering whether to ascend the breast again to see if
  McCann's men had come back and retrieved the bottle. I decided I'd better not
  risk it, and rode after Dahut.</p>

  <p>She kept far ahead of me, never looking back. At the door of the old house
  she flung herself from the back of the bay, gave it a little slap, and went
  quickly in. The bay trotted over to the stables. I turned across the field
  and rode into the grove of oaks. I remembered it so well that I knew
  precisely when I would reach its edge and face the monoliths.</p>

  <p>I reached the edge, and there were the standing stones, a good two hundred
  of them lifting up from a ten-acre plain and hidden from the sea by a
  pine-thatched granite ridge. They were not gray as they had been under fog.
  They were stained red by the setting sun. In their center squatted the Cairn,
  sullen, enigmatic, and evil.</p>

  <p>The roan would not pass the threshold of the grove. He raised his head and
  sniffed at the wind and whinnied; he began to shiver and to sweat, and the
  whinny grew shrill with fear. He swerved and swung back into the oaks. I gave
  him his head.</p>

  <p>Dahut sat at the head of the table. Her father had gone somewhere in the
  yacht and might not return that night, she had said... I wondered, but not
  aloud, if he were collecting more paupers for the sacrifices.</p>

  <p>He had not been there when I had come in from the ride. Nor, until I had
  sat down at the table, had I seen Dahut. I had gone up to my room and bathed
  and dressed leisurely. I had set my ear to the tapestry and had searched
  again for the hidden spring; and had heard and found nothing. A kneeling
  servant had announced that dinner was ready. It interested me that he did not
  address me as his Lord of Carnac.</p>

  <p>Dahut wore a black dress, for the first time since I had met her. There
  wasn't much of it, but what there was showed her off beautifully. She looked
  tired; not wilty nor droopy, but in some odd fashion like a sea flower that
  was at its best at high tide and was now marking time through the low. I felt
  a certain pity for her. She raised her eyes to mine, and they were weary. She
  said:</p>

  <p>"Alan, do you mind&mdash;I'd rather talk commonplaces tonight."</p>

  <p>Inwardly, I smiled at that. The situation was somewhat more than piquant.
  There was so little we could talk about other than commonplaces that wasn't
  loaded with high explosive. I approved of the suggestion, feeling in no mood
  for explosions. Nevertheless, there was something wrong with the Demoiselle
  or she would never have made it. Was she afraid I might bring up that matter
  of the sacrificial bowl, perhaps&mdash;or was it that my talk with de Keradel
  had upset her. Certainly, she had not liked it.</p>

  <p>"Commonplaces it is," I said. "If brains were sparks, mine tonight
  wouldn't even light a match. Discussion of the weather is about the limit of
  my intelligence."</p>

  <p>She laughed: "Well, what do you think of the weather, Alan?"</p>

  <p>I said: "It ought to be abolished by Constitutional amendment."</p>

  <p>"And what makes the weather?"</p>

  <p>"Just now," I answered, "you do&mdash;for me."</p>

  <p>She looked at me, somberly: "I wish that were true&mdash;but take care,
  Alan."</p>

  <p>"My mistake, Dahut," I said. "Back to the commonplace."</p>

  <p>She sighed, then smiled&mdash;and it was hard to think of her as the Dahut
  I had known, or thought I had known, in her towers of Ys and New York... or
  with the golden sickle red in her hand...</p>

  <p>We stuck to commonplaces, although now and then perilous pits gaped. The
  perfect servants served us with a perfect dinner. De Keradel, whether
  scientist or sorcerer, did himself well with his wines. But the Demoiselle
  ate little and drank hardly at all, and steadily her languor grew. I pushed
  aside the coffee, and said:</p>

  <p>"The tide must be on the ebb, Dahut."</p>

  <p>She straightened, and asked, sharply:</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know. But always you have seemed to me of the sea, Dahut. I told
  you so that night I met you. So why should your spirit not rise and fall with
  the rise and fall of the tides?"</p>

  <p>She arose, abruptly, and her face was colorless: "Good-night, Alan. I am
  very tired. Sleep&mdash;without dreams."</p>

  <p>She was out of the room before I could answer her. Why had that mention of
  the tides brought about such change in her, forced her to flight&mdash;for
  flight that swift, departure had been? I could find no answer. A clock struck
  nine. I sat at the table for a quarter-hour more, the blank-eyed servants
  watching me. I stood up, yawning. I smiled drowsily at the butler and said to
  him in the Breton:</p>

  <p>"Tonight I sleep."</p>

  <p>He had been among the van of those who with their flambeaux had herded the
  sacrifices. He bowed low, no slightest change of expression to betray that he
  sensed the true significance of what I had said. He held the curtains open
  for me, and I felt his gaze upon me as I slowly went up the stairs to my
  room.</p>

  <p>I paused for a moment in the hall and looked out the window. There was a
  rack of thin clouds over the sky, half-veiling the moon, now a few nights
  past its full. It was a dimly luminous night, and a very silent one. There
  were no shadows in the wide, old-fashioned hall&mdash;whispering and
  rustling. I entered my room, undressed and went to bed. It was close to
  ten.</p>

  <p>An hour went by while I lay there feigning sleep. Then that for which I
  had been waiting happened. Someone was in the room, and by the faint strange
  fragrance I knew it was Dahut, and that she stood close beside my bed. I felt
  her bend over me and listen to my breathing; then her fingers, light as the
  touch of a moth, upon the pulse in my neck and upon the pulse in my wrist. I
  sighed, and turned, and seemed to sink again in deepest slumber. And I heard
  her sigh, and felt a touch upon my cheek that was not of fingers. The
  fragrance stole away, soundlessly. Yet I knew Dahut had paused before the
  tapestry, listening. For long minutes she stood there, and then there was the
  faintest of clicks, and I knew that she had gone.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, I waited until the hands upon my watch-face pointed to
  eleven before I slipped out of bed, and drew on breeches, shirt, dark
  sweater, and sneakers.</p>

  <p>The driveway to the house ran straight to the guarded gates, a mile and a
  half away. I did not believe this was patrolled, and I purposed to follow it
  to within half a mile of the gates, strike off to the left, reach the wall
  and skirt it to the rock where McCann would be awaiting me. True, the keeper
  of the inn had said the breast could not be scaled from the water, but I had
  no doubt McCann would find a way. I should make it in half an hour,
  easily.</p>

  <p>I stepped out into the hall, crept to the head of the stairs, and looked
  down. A faint light was burning, but there was no sign of servants. I stole
  down the stairs and reached the front door. It was unlocked and unbolted. I
  closed it behind me and merged into the shadow of a rhododendron, getting my
  bearings.</p>

  <p>Here the driveway made a wide curve, unprotected by shrubbery. The scud
  had thinned and the moon was far too bright, but once the loop was crossed,
  there would be cover from the trees that bordered the road. I walked across
  the loop and gained the shelter of the trees. I waited a good five minutes,
  watching. The house remained dark, no lights from any window; no stir nor
  sound. I set off along the roadway.</p>

  <p>I had covered a trifle under my mile when I came to a narrow lane angling
  to the left. It was fairly straight, what I could see of it in the watery
  moonlight. It struck in the general direction of the rock, and promised not
  only a shorter cut but a safer way. I took it. A few score yards and the
  trees ended. The lane continued, but bordered with scrub and bushes just too
  high for me to look over and far too dense for me to see through.</p>

  <p>A half mile of this, and I began to have an acutely disagreeable feeling
  of being followed. It was an extraordinary unpleasant feeling&mdash;as though
  that which followed was peculiarly loathsome. And suddenly it was at my
  back&mdash;reaching out to me? I wheeled, snatching the gun from the
  holster.</p>

  <p>There was nothing behind me. The lane stretched dimly back, and empty.</p>

  <p>My heart was pumping as though I had been running, the backs of my hands
  and my forehead wet with sweat and I felt a stirring of nausea. I fought it
  down and went on, gun in hand. A dozen steps, and again I felt the stealthy
  approach&mdash;coming closer, closer, closer... faster and faster... sweeping
  upon me. I mastered panic impulse to run, and wheeled again&mdash; and again
  saw only empty lane.</p>

  <p>I pressed my back against the bushes, and sidled along, watching the path
  I had traversed.</p>

  <p>Now there was furtive movement in the scrub that lined the lane; movement
  as of things flitting through the bushes to the measure of my steps, watching
  me, gloating upon me; and there were rustlings and whisperings and thin
  obscene pipings as though they talked of me as I sidled on and on, legs
  trembling, nausea growing, and fighting, fighting at every step that panic
  desire to fling away my gun, cover my eyes with my arms lest I see the things
  &mdash;and run and run.</p>

  <p>The lane ended. Step by step I backed away from it until I could no longer
  hear the rustlings and the pipings. But still there was movement in the
  bushes and I knew the things watched me from them. I turned and saw that I
  was on the edge of the haunted meadow. Sinister enough it had seemed by day,
  but it had been gay to what it was now, by night, under the scud-veiled,
  waning moon. It was desolate, unutterably desolate, and the bushes that had
  seemed like crouching men were now bent souls chained for eternity to that
  desolation, in irrevocable despair.</p>

  <p>I could not cross that meadow unless I did it quickly. I could not go back
  through the piping things. I began to run straight across the meadow, toward
  the wall.</p>

  <p>I was a third over it when I heard the baying of the hounds. It came from
  the direction of the house, and involuntarily I stopped, listening. It was
  not like the cry of any pack I had ever heard. It was sustained, wailing,
  ineffably mournful; with the thin unearthly quality of the obscene pipings.
  It was the desolation of the meadow given voice.</p>

  <p>I stood, throat dry, every hair prickling, unable to move. And nearer drew
  the howling, and nearer.</p>

  <p>The lane spewed shadow shapes. They were black under the moon and they
  were like the shadows of men, but of men deformed, distorted, changed into
  abominable grotesques within a workshop in Hell. They were&mdash;foul. They
  spread fan-wise from the mouth of the lane and came leaping, skipping,
  flittering over the meadow; squattering in the crouching bushes, then
  flinging themselves out again, and as they ran they mewed and squeaked and
  piped. There was one with bloated body like a monstrous frog that came
  hopping toward me and leaped croaking over my head. There was another that
  touched me as it passed&mdash;a shadowy thing with long and twisted ape-like
  arms, dwarfed legs and head the size of an orange set upon a thin and
  writhing neck. It was not all shadow, for I felt its touch, gossamer as the
  wing of a moth, thin as mist&mdash;but palpable. It was unclean, a
  defilement, a horror.</p>

  <p>The baying of the dogs was close, and with it a tattoo of hoofs, the
  drumming of a strong horse, galloping.</p>

  <p>Out of the lane burst a great black stallion, neck outstretched, mane
  flying. Upon his back rode Dahut, ash-gold hair streaming loose in the wind,
  eyes flaming with the violet witch-fire. She saw me, and raised her whip and
  screamed, reining in the stallion so that he danced, fore-feet high in air.
  Again she screamed, and pointed to me. From behind the stallion poured a pack
  of huge dogs, a dozen or more of them, like staghounds... like the great
  hounds of the Druids.</p>

  <p>They raced down upon me like a black wave... and I saw that they were
  shadowy, but in the blackness of their shadows red eyes gleamed with the same
  hell-fires that were in Dahut's. And behind them thundered the stallion with
  Dahut&mdash;no longer screaming, her mouth twisted into a square of fury and
  her face no woman's but a fiend's.</p>

  <p>They were almost upon me before my paralysis broke. I raised the automatic
  and shot straight at her. Before I could press trigger again, the shadow pack
  was on me.</p>

  <p>Like the thing that had touched me, they, too, had substance, these shadow
  hounds of Dahut. Tenuous, misty&mdash;but material. I staggered under their
  onslaught. It was as though I fought against bodies made of black cobwebs,
  and I saw the moon as though it were shining through a black veil; and Dahut
  upon the stallion and the desolate meadow were dimmed and blurred as though I
  looked through black cobwebs. I had dropped my gun and I fought with bare
  hands. Their touch had not the vileness of the ape-armed thing, but from them
  came a strange and numbing cold. They tore at me with shadowy fangs, tore at
  my throat with red eyes burning into mine, and it was as though the cold
  poured into me through their fangs. I was weakening. It was growing harder to
  breathe. The numbness of the cold had my arms and hands so that now I could
  only feebly struggle against the black cobwebs. I dropped to my knees,
  gasping for breath...</p>

  <p>Dahut was down from the stallion and I was free from hounds. I stared up
  at her and tried to stagger to my feet. The fury had gone from her face, but
  in it was no mercy and out of its whiteness the violet flames of her eyes
  flared. She brought her whip down across my face: "A brand for your first
  treachery!" She lashed. "A brand for your second!" A third time again. "A
  brand for this time!"</p>

  <p>I wondered, dazedly, why I did not feel the blows.</p>

  <p>I felt nothing; all my body was numb, as though the cold had condensed
  within it. Slowly it was creeping into my brain, chilling my mind, freezing
  my thought. She said: "Stand up."</p>

  <p>Slowly, I arose. She leaped upon the stallion's back. She said: "Raise
  your left arm." I lifted it, and she noosed the lash of the quirt around my
  wrist like a fetter.</p>

  <p>She said: "Look. My dogs feed."</p>

  <p>I looked. The shadow hounds were coursing over the meadow and the shadow
  things were running, hopping from bush to bush, squeaking, piping in terror.
  The hounds were chasing them, pulling them down, tearing at them.</p>

  <p>She said: "You, too, shall feed!"</p>

  <p>She called to her dogs and they left their kills and came coursing to
  her.</p>

  <p>The cold had crept into my brain. I could not think. I could see, but what
  I saw had little meaning. I had no will, except hers.</p>

  <p>The stallion trotted away, into the lane. I trotted at its side, held by
  the fetter of Dahut's lash, like a runaway slave. Once I looked behind. At my
  heels was the shadow pack, red eyes glinting in their bodies' murk. It did
  not matter.</p>

  <p>And the numbness grew until all I knew was that I was trotting,
  trotting.</p>

  <p>Then even that last faint fragment of consciousness faded away.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19"></a>19. &mdash; "CREEP, SHADOW!"</h2>

  <p class="first">There was no feeling in my body, but my mind was awake and
  alert. It was as though I had no body. The icy venom from the fangs of the
  shadow hounds still numbed me, I thought. But it had cleared from my brain. I
  could see and I could hear.</p>

  <p>All that I could see was a green twilight, as though I lay deep in some
  ocean abyss looking upward through immense spaces of motionless,
  crystal-clear green water. I floated deep within this motionless sea, yet I
  could hear, far above me, its waves whispering and singing.</p>

  <p>I began to rise, floating up through the depths toward the whispering,
  singing waves. Their voices became clearer. They were singing a strange old
  song, a sea-song old before ever man was... singing it to the measured chime
  of tiny bells struck slowly far beneath the sea... to measured tap, tap, tap
  on drums of red royal coral deep beneath the sea... to chords struck softly
  on harps of sea-fans whose strings were mauve and violet and
  crocus-yellow.</p>

  <p>Up I floated and up, until song and drum beat, chimes and sighing harp
  chords blended into one... The voice of Dahut.</p>

  <p>She was close to me, and she was singing, but I could not see her. I could
  see nothing but the green twilight, and that was fast darkening. Sweet was
  her voice and pitiless... and wordless was her song except for its
  burden...</p>

  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left: 36%;">Creep, Shadow!<br>
  Thirst, Shadow!<br>
  Hunger, Shadow!<br>
  Creep, Shadow&mdash;creep!</p>

  <p>I strove to speak and could not; strove to move and could not. And still
  her song went on... only its burden plain...</p>

  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left: 36%;">Creep, Shadow!<br>
  Hunger, Shadow,<br>
  feed only where and when I bid you!<br>
  Thirst, Shadow<br>
  drink only where and when I bid you!<br>
  Creep, Shadow creep!</p>

  <p>Suddenly I felt my body. First as a tingling, and then as a leaden weight,
  and then as a wrenching agony. I was out of my body. It lay upon a wide, low
  bed in a tapestried room filled with rosy light. The light did not penetrate
  the space in which I was, crouching at my body's feet. On my body's face were
  three crimson welts, the marks of Dahut's whip, and Dahut stood at my body's
  head, naked, two thick braids of her pale gold hair crossed between white
  breasts. I knew that my body was not dead, but Dahut was not looking at it.
  She was looking at me... whatever I was... crouched at my body's feet...</p>

  <p class="poem">Creep, Shadow... creep... creep...<br>
  Creep, Shadow... creep...</p>

  <p>The room, my body, and Dahut faded&mdash;in that precise order. I was
  creeping, creeping, through darkness. It was like creeping through a tunnel,
  for solidity was above and below and on each side of me; and at last, as
  though reaching a tunnel's end, the blackness before me began to gray. I
  crept out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>I was at the edge of the standing stones, on the threshold of the
  monoliths. The moon was low, and they stood black against it.</p>

  <p>There was an eddy of wind, and like a leaf it blew me among the monoliths.
  I thought: What am I to be blown like a leaf in the wind! I felt resentment,
  rage. I thought: A shadow's rage!</p>

  <p>I was beside one of the standing stones. Dark as it was, a darker shadow
  leaned against it. It was the shadow of a man, although there was no man's
  body to cast it. It was the shadow of a man buried to the knees. There were
  other monoliths near, and against each of them leaned a man's shadow...
  buried to the knees. The shadow closest to me wavered, like the shadow cast
  by a wind-shaken candle flame. It bent to me and whispered: "You have life!
  Live, Shadow and save us!"</p>

  <p>I whispered: "I am shadow... shadow like you... how can I save you?"</p>

  <p>The shadow against the standing stone swayed and shook: "You have life...
  kill... kill her... kill him..."</p>

  <p>The shadow on the stone behind me whispered: "Kill... her... first."</p>

  <p>From all the monoliths rose a whisper: "Kill... kill... kill..."</p>

  <p>There was a stronger eddy of the wind, and on it I was whirled like a leaf
  almost to the threshold of the Cairn. The whispering of the shadows fettered
  to the circling monoliths grew locust shrill, beating back the wind that was
  whirling me into the Cairn... shrilling a barrier between the Cairn and me...
  driving me back, out of the field of the monoliths...</p>

  <p>The Cairn and the monoliths were gone. The moon was gone and gone was the
  familiar earth. I was a shadow... in a land of shadows...</p>

  <p>There were no stars, no moon, no sun. There was only a faintly luminous
  dusk which shrouded a world all wan and ashen and black. I stood alone, on a
  wide plain. There were no perspectives, and no horizons. Everywhere it was as
  though I looked upon vast screens. Yet I knew there were depths and distances
  in this strange land. I was a shadow, vague and unsubstantial. Yet I could
  see and hear, feel and taste, I knew that because I clasped my hands and felt
  them, and in my mouth and throat was the bitter taste of ashes.</p>

  <p>Ahead of me were shadow mountains, stacked against each other like
  gigantic slices of black jade; lamellar; distinguishable from each other only
  by their varying darknesses. It seemed that I could reach out a hand and
  touch them, yet I knew they were far and far away. My eyes&mdash;my sight
  &mdash;whatever it was that functioned as sight in this shadow that was I,
  sharpened. I was ankle-deep in somber, shadowy grass starred by small flowers
  that should have been gay blue instead of mournful gray. And shadowy livid
  lilies that should have been golden and scarlet swayed in a wind I could not
  feel.</p>

  <p>I beard above me a thin trilling, plaintively sweet. Shadowy birds were
  winging over me toward the distant mountains. They passed... but the trilling
  lingered... shaped itself into words into the voice of Dahut.</p>

  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left: 36%;">... Creep, Shadow! Hunger! Thirst!</p>

  <p>My way was toward the mountains&mdash;the shadowy birds had pointed it. I
  had a swift moment of rebellion, I thought: I will not take it. This is
  illusion. Here I stay...</p>

  <p>The voice of Dahut, pitiless: Creep, Shadow! Learn whether it is not
  real!</p>

  <p>I began to walk, through the somber grass, toward the black mountains.</p>

  <p>There was a muted beat of hoofs behind me. I turned. A shadowy horse was
  driving down upon me, a great gray destrier, armored. The shadow who rode it
  was armored, the shadow of a big man, wide of shoulder and thick of body;
  unvisored, but chain-mailed from neck to feet, in his belt a battle-axe and
  across his shoulders a long two-edged sword. The destrier was close, yet the
  sound of its hoofs was faint, like distant thunder. And I saw that far behind
  the armored man raced other shadowy horsemen, leaning forward over the necks
  of small steeds. The armored man drew up his horse beside me, looked down at
  me with faint glint of brown eyes in shadowy face.</p>

  <p>"A stranger! Now by Our Lady I leave no straggler in the path of the
  wolves I draw! Up, Shadow... up!"</p>

  <p>He swung an arm and lifted me; threw me astride the destrier behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"Hold fast!" he cried, and gave the gray horse the spur. Swiftly it raced,
  and soon the slices of the black mountains were close. A defile opened. At
  its mouth he stopped, and looked back, made gestures of derision and laughed:
  "They cannot catch us now..."</p>

  <p>He muttered: "Still, I do not know why my horse should be so weary."</p>

  <p>He stared at me from shadowy face: "I do know... you have too much of
  life, Shadow. He who casts you is not... dead. Then what do you here?"</p>

  <p>He twisted, and lifted me from the horse, and set me on the ground,
  gently.</p>

  <p>"See!" he pointed to my breast. There was a filament of glistening silver,
  fine as the finest cobweb, floating from it... stretching toward the ravine
  as though pointing the way I must take... as though it came from my heart...
  as though it were unwinding from my heart...</p>

  <p>"You are not dead!" Shadowy pity was in his regard. "Therefore you must
  hunger... therefore you must thirst... until you feed and drink where the
  thread leads you. Half-Shadow&mdash;it was a witch who sent me here, Berenice
  de Azlais, of Languedoc. But my body has long been dust and I have long been
  content to feed on shadow fare. Long dust, I say and so suppose... but here
  one knows no time. My year was 1346 of Our Lord. What year was yours?"</p>

  <p>"Nigh six centuries after," I said.</p>

  <p>"So long... so long," he whispered. "Who sent you here?"</p>

  <p>"Dahut of Ys."</p>

  <p>"Queen of Shadows! Well, she has sent us many. I am sorry, Half-Shadow,
  but I can carry you no further."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he slapped his sides, and shook with laughter: "Six hundred
  years, and still I have my lemans. Shadowy, 'tis true&mdash;but then so am I.
  And still I can fight. Berenice&mdash;to you my thanks. St. Francis... let
  Berenice hereafter toast less hotly in Hell, where without doubt she is."</p>

  <p>He leaned and clapped me on the shoulder: "But kill your witch, Half-
  brother&mdash;if you can!"</p>

  <p>He rode into the ravine. I followed in his wake, walking. Soon he was out
  of sight. How long I walked I did not know. It was true that there was no
  time in this land. I passed out of the ravine.</p>

  <p>The black jade mountains were palisades circling a garden filled with the
  pallid lilies. In its center was a deep black pool in which floated other
  lilies, black and silver and rusty-black. The pool was walled with jet...</p>

  <p>It was there that I felt the first bite of the dreadful hunger, the first
  pang of the dreadful thirst...</p>

  <p>Upon the wide jet wall lay seven girls, dull silver shadows... and
  exquisite. Naked shadows... one lay with chin cupped in misty hands, glint of
  deepest-sapphire blue eyes in shadowy face... another sat, dipping slender
  feet in the black of the pool, and her hair was blacker than its waters,
  black spume of blacker waves, and as fine... and out of the black mist of her
  hair eyes green as emeralds but soft with promise glanced at me...</p>

  <p>They arose, the seven, and drifted toward me. One said: "He has too much
  of life."</p>

  <p>Another said: "Too much... yet not enough."</p>

  <p>A third said: "He must feed and drink... then come back, and we shall
  see."</p>

  <p>The girl whose eyes were sapphire blue, asked: "Who sent you here,
  Shadow?"</p>

  <p>I said: "Dahut the White. Dahut of Ys."</p>

  <p>They shrank from me: "Dahut sent you? Shadow&mdash;you are not for us.
  Shadow&mdash;pass on."</p>

  <p>... Creep, Shadow!...</p>

  <p>I said: "I am weary. Let me rest here for a while."</p>

  <p>The green-eyed girl said: "You have too much of life. If you had none you
  would not be weary. Only life grows weary."</p>

  <p>The blue-eyed girl whispered: "And life is only weariness."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, I would rest. Also I am hungry, and I thirst."</p>

  <p>"Shadow with too much of life... there is nothing here that you can eat...
  nothing here that you can drink."</p>

  <p>I pointed to the pool: "I drink of that."</p>

  <p>They laughed: "Try, Shadow."</p>

  <p>I dropped upon my belly and thrust my face toward the black water. The
  surface of the pool receded as I bent. It drew back from my lips... it was
  but the shadow of water... and I could not drink...</p>

  <p>... Thirst, Shadow... drink only when and where I bid...</p>

  <p>The voice of Dahut!</p>

  <p>I said to the girls: "Let me rest."</p>

  <p>They answered: "Rest."</p>

  <p>I crouched upon the rim of jet. The silver girls drew away from me,
  clustered, shadowy arms entwined, whispering. It was good to rest, although I
  felt no desire to sleep. I sat, hands clasping knees, head on breast.
  Loneliness fell upon me like a garment; loneliness rained upon me. The girl
  whose eyes were blue slipped to my side. She threw an arm around my
  shoulders, leaned against me:</p>

  <p>"When you have fed... when you have drunk... come back to me."</p>

  <p>I do not know how long I lay upon the rim of jet around the black pool.
  But when at last I arose the girls of tarnished silver were not there. The
  armored man had said there was no time in this land. I had liked the armored
  man. I wished that his horse had been strong enough to carry me wherever he
  had been going. My hunger had grown and so had my thirst. Again I dropped and
  tried to sip of the pool. The shadow waters were not for me.</p>

  <p>Something was tugging at me, drawing me on. It was the silver filament and
  it was shining like a thread of living light. I walked out of the garden,
  following the thread...</p>

  <p>The mountains were behind me. I was threading my way through a vast marsh.
  Spectral rushes bordered a perilous path, and in them lurked shadow shapes
  unseen but hideous. They watched me as I went, and I knew that here I must go
  carefully lest a misstep give me to them. A mist hung over the marsh, a gray
  and dead mist that darkened when the hidden things furtively raised
  themselves... or fled ahead to crouch beside the path and wait my coming. I
  felt their eyes upon me&mdash;cold, dead, malignant.</p>

  <p>There was a ridge feathered with ghostly ferns behind which other shadowy
  shapes lurked, pushing and crowding against each other, following me as I
  threaded my way through the spectral rushes. And at every step more woeful
  became my loneliness, more torturing my hunger and my thirst.</p>

  <p>I passed the marsh and came out upon a dim path that quickly widened into
  a broad highway which, wavering, stretched across an illimitable and cloudy
  plain. There were other shadow shapes upon this highway... shapes of men and
  women, old and young, shapes of children and of animals... but no shape
  inhuman or unearthly. They were like shapes formed of heavy fog... of frozen
  fog. They flittered and loitered, ran or stood forlorn... singly, in groups,
  in companies. And as they went by, or overtook me or I overtook them, I felt
  their gaze upon me. They seemed of all times and of all races, these shadow
  folk. There was a lean Egyptian priest upon whose shoulder sat a shadowy cat
  that arched its back and spat soundlessly at me... three Roman legionaries
  whose round, close-fitting helmets were darker stains upon their heads and
  who raised shadowy arms in the ancient salute as they strode past... there
  were Greek warriors with helms from which shadow plumes streamed, and shadowy
  women in litters carried by shadow slaves... and once a company of little men
  went by on shaggy silent ponies, spectral bows at backs, slant shadowy eyes
  glinting at me... and there was the shadow of a child that turned and trotted
  beside me for a space, reaching up its hands to the slender filament that was
  leading me... dragging me... where?</p>

  <p>The road went on and on. It became ever more thronged with the shadow
  people, and I saw that many more were going my way than against me. Then at
  my right, out upon the vaporous plain, a wan light began to glow...
  phosphorescent, funereal... like the glimmer of the corposants, the lights of
  the dead... among the monoliths...</p>

  <p>It became a half-moon that rested upon the plain like a gigantic gateway.
  It sent a path of ashen light across the plain, and from the highroad into
  that path, the shadow people began to stream. Not all&mdash;one that tarried
  paused beside me, gross of body, with plumed and conical hat and cloak that
  streamed and wavered in a wind I could not feel, as though by it his gross
  body were being whipped in tatters.</p>

  <p>He whispered: "The Eater of Shadows eats from a full board."</p>

  <p>I echoed, thinly: "The Eater of Shadows?"</p>

  <p>I felt his gaze upon me, intent. He tittered in a voice like the rustling
  of rotting, poisonous leaves:</p>

  <p>"Heh-heh-heh... a virgin! New born into this delectable world! You know
  nothing of the Eater of Shadows? Heh-heh-heh... but he is our only form of
  Death in this world, and many who weary of it go to him. This you do not yet
  fully perceive, since he has not made himself manifest. They are fools," he
  whispered, viciously. "They should learn, as I have learned, to take their
  food in the world from which they came. No shadow-food... no, no, no... good
  flesh and body and soul... soul, heh-heh-heh!"</p>

  <p>A shadowy hand snatched at the shining filament, and recoiled, twisting as
  though seared... the gross shadow cringed and writhed as though in agony. The
  rustling voice became a vile high whining: "You are going to your marriage
  feast... going to your marriage bed. You will have your own table... a fair
  table of flesh and blood and soul... of life. Take me with you, bridegroom...
  take me with you. I can teach you so much! And my price is only a few crumbs
  from your table... only the smallest share in your bride..."</p>

  <p>Something was gathering in the doorway of the half-moon; something forming
  upon its glimmering surface... fathomless black shadows were grouping
  themselves into a gigantic, featureless face. No, it was not featureless, for
  there were two apertures like eyes through which the wan phosphorescence
  shone. And there was a shapeless mouth which gaped while a writhing ribbon of
  the dead light streamed out of it like a tongue. The tongue licked among the
  shadows and drew them into the mouth, and the lips closed on them then opened
  again, and again the tongue licked out...</p>

  <p>"Oh, my hunger! Oh, my thirst and hunger! Take me with you, bridegroom to
  your bride. There is so much I can teach you for such a little price..."</p>

  <p>I struck at that gibbering shadow and fled from its dreadful whispering;
  fled with shadowy arms covering my eyes to shut out vision of that vague and
  dreadful face.</p>

  <p>... Hunger, Shadow... feed only where and when I bid. Thirst, Shadow...
  drink only where and when I bid!...</p>

  <p>And now I knew. I knew where the silver filament was dragging me, and I
  tore at it with shadowy hands, but could not break it. I tried to run back,
  against it, and it swung me around, dragging me inexorably on.</p>

  <p>I knew now what the evil, tittering shadow had known... that I was on my
  way to food and drink... to my marriage feast... to my bride...</p>

  <p>Helen!</p>

  <p>It was on her body and blood and life my hunger was to be appeased, my
  thirst slaked.</p>

  <p>Upon Helen!</p>

  <p>The shadow-land lightened. It became crystalline. Heavier, blacker shadows
  thrust themselves within it. These steadied, and the land of shadows
  vanished.</p>

  <p>I was in an old room. Helen was there, and Bill and McCann, and a man I
  did not know; a lean and dark man with thin, ascetic face and snow-white
  hair. But wait... that must be Ricori...</p>

  <p>How long had I been in shadow-land?</p>

  <p>Their voices came to me as a low humming, their words an unintelligible
  drone. I did not care what they were talking about. My whole being was
  focused upon Helen. I was starving for her, famishing for her... I must eat
  and drink of her...</p>

  <p>I thought: If I do... she must die!</p>

  <p>I thought: Let her die... I must eat and drink...</p>

  <p>She raised her head, sharply. I knew that she was aware of me. She turned
  and looked straight at me. She saw me... I knew that she saw me. Her face
  whitened... then grew pitiful. The amber-gold of her eyes darkened with a
  wrath in which was complete comprehension... then became tender. Her little
  rounded chin hardened, her red mouth with its touch of the archaic became
  inscrutable. She arose and said something to the others. I saw them rise,
  staring at her incredulously&mdash;then search the room with their eyes.
  Except Ricori, who looked straight at her, stern face softened. And now words
  shaped themselves from the low humming of their voices. I heard Helen
  say:</p>

  <p>"I fight Dahut. Give me an hour. I know what I am doing&mdash;" a wave of
  color spread over her face "-believe me, I know."</p>

  <p>I saw Ricori bend and kiss her hand; he raised his head and there was iron
  assurance in the look he gave her... "And I know&mdash;win, Madonna... or if
  you lose, be sure that you shall be avenged."</p>

  <p>She walked from the room. The shadow that was I crept after her.</p>

  <p>She walked upstairs, and into another room. She turned on lights,
  hesitated, then locked the door behind her. She went to the windows and drew
  down the curtains. She held her arms out to me:</p>

  <p>"Can you hear me, Alan? I can see you... faintly still, but more plainly
  than below. Can you hear me? Then come to me."</p>

  <p>I quivered with desire for her... to eat and drink of her. But the voice
  of Dahut was in my ears, not to be disobeyed&mdash;Eat and drink... when I
  bid you.</p>

  <p>I knew that the hunger must grow stronger, the thirst more consuming,
  before I could be loosed from that command. This so that only all the life of
  Helen could appease the hunger and slake the thirst. So that feeding,
  drinking... I killed her.</p>

  <p>I whispered: "I hear you."</p>

  <p>"I hear you, darling. Come to me."</p>

  <p>"I cannot come to you&mdash;not yet. My thirst and hunger for you must
  grow greater... so that when I come to you&mdash;you die."</p>

  <p>She dimmed the lights; raised her arms and loosed her hair so that it fell
  in shining red-gold ringlets almost to her waist. She asked: "What keeps you
  from me? From me who loves you... from me whom you love?"</p>

  <p>"Dahut... you know that."</p>

  <p>"Beloved&mdash;I do not know that. It is not true. None can keep you from
  me if I truly love you and if you truly love me. Both are true... and I say
  to you come to me, beloved... take me."</p>

  <p>I made no answer; I could not. Nor could I go to her. And more ravenous
  grew the hunger, more maddening the thirst.</p>

  <p>She said: "Alan, think only that. Think only that we love. That none can
  keep us from each other. Think only that. Do you understand me?"</p>

  <p>I whispered: "Yes." And tried to think only that while the hunger and the
  thirst for her... for the life of her... were two starved hounds straining at
  the leash.</p>

  <p>She said: "Darling, can you see me? See me clearly?"</p>

  <p>I whispered: "Yes."</p>

  <p>She said: "Then look... and come to me."</p>

  <p>She raised her arms again, and slipped from her dress; drew off slippers
  and stockings. She let fall from her the silken sheath that remained. She
  stood facing me, all lovely, all desirable, wholly human. She threw back her
  hair uncovering her white breasts... her eyes were golden pools of love that
  held no shame...</p>

  <p>"Take me, beloved! Eat and drink of me!"</p>

  <p>I strained against the fetters that held me&mdash;strained against them as
  a soul led up from Hell to the gates of Paradise would strain to break its
  bonds and enter.</p>

  <p>"She has no power over you. None can keep us apart... come to me,
  beloved."</p>

  <p>The fetters broke... I was in her arms...</p>

  <p>Shadow that I was, I could feel her soft arms around me... feel the warmth
  of her breast pressing me closer, closer... feel her kisses on my shadowy
  lips. I merged with her. I ate and drank of her... of her life... and felt
  her life streaming through me... melting the icy venom of the shadow
  hounds...</p>

  <p>Releasing me from the shadow bondage...</p>

  <p>Releasing me from Dahut!</p>

  <p>I stood beside the bed looking down on Helen. She lay, white and drained
  of life, half covered by her red-gold hair... and was she dead? Had Dahut
  conquered?</p>

  <p>I bent shadowy head to her heart and listened and could hear no beat. Love
  and tenderness such as I had never known throbbed from me and covered her.
  And I thought: This love must surely be stronger than death... must give back
  to her the life I have taken...</p>

  <p>And still I could not hear her heart...</p>

  <p>Then despair followed the pulse of that love. And on its wake a hate
  colder than the venom of the shadow hounds.</p>

  <p>Hate against Dahut.</p>

  <p>Hate against the warlock who called himself her father.</p>

  <p>Hate implacable, relentless, remorseless against both.</p>

  <p>That hate grew. It merged with the life I had stolen from Helen. It lifted
  me. Upon its wings I was rushed away... away from Helen... back through the
  shadow-land...</p>

  <p>And awakened... shadow no more.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20"></a>20. &mdash; THE LAST SACRIFICE</h2>

  <p class="first">I lay upon a wide low bed in a tapestried room where an
  ancient lamp burned with a dim rose light. It was Dahut's room from which she
  had sent me forth as shadow. My hands were crossed upon my breast, and
  something bound my wrists. I raised them and saw twined tight around them the
  witch-fetters &mdash;a twisted thread of pale-gold hair, the hair of Dahut. I
  broke them. My ankles were crossed and bound with the same fetters, and these
  I broke. I swung from the bed. Around me was a robe of the soft white cotton,
  a robe like that I had worn to the sacrifices. I tore it from me with
  loathing. There was a mirror over the dressing table&mdash;on my face were
  the three marks of Dahut's whip-branding, no longer crimson but livid.</p>

  <p>How long had I been in the shadowy land? Long enough to allow Ricori to
  return&mdash;but how much longer? More important, what time had elapsed since
  Helen? A clock showed close to eleven. But was this still the same night? It
  might not be&mdash;shadow time and shadow space were alien. I had seemed to
  cover immense distances, and yet I had found Helen just outside de Keradel's
  gates. For I was sure that that old room had been in the house McCann had
  taken.</p>

  <p>And clearly, this return of mine had not been expected by Dahut&mdash;at
  least not so soon. I reflected grimly that I always seemed to be a little
  ahead of schedule so far as Dahut and her father were concerned... I
  reflected much more grimly that it had never advantaged me greatly.
  Nevertheless, it must mean that her dark wisdom had its limits&mdash;that
  there had been no shadowy spies to whisper to her my escape... that she
  believed me still under her sorceries; still obedient to her will; still held
  back by her command until my lust for Helen had grown strong enough to kill
  when loosed...</p>

  <p>Might that not also mean her purpose had failed... that loosed too soon I
  had not killed... that Helen was alive?</p>

  <p>The thought was like strong wine. I walked to the door and saw that the
  heavy inside bars were down. How could they have been dropped, since only I
  was in the room? Of course... I was Dahut's prisoner, and she wanted no
  tampering with my body when she was not beside it. She had barred the door
  and made use of the secret opening into my room to come and go. Quite
  evidently she had considered the bars safe from my helpless hands. I lifted
  them cautiously, and tried the door. It was unlocked. I opened it as
  cautiously, slowly, and stood peering out into the hall, listening.</p>

  <p>It was then I first felt the unease, the trouble, the fear, of the old
  house. It was filled with fear. And with wrath. It came to me not only from
  the shadowed hall, but from all of the house. And suddenly it seemed to be
  aware of me, and to focus itself upon me, frantically... as though it were
  trying to tell me why it was troubled and raging and afraid.</p>

  <p>So sharp was the impression that I closed the door, let one of the bars
  fall, and stood with my back to it. The room was unhaunted, unafraid, and
  shadowless, the faint rose light penetrating to every corner...</p>

  <p>The house invaded the room, striving to make coherent to me what it was
  that troubled it. It was as though the ghosts of all those who had lived and
  loved and died there were in revolt... appalled by something about to
  happen... something execrable, abhorrent... an evil something that had been
  conceived in the old house while its ghosts had watched, impotent to
  prevent... and now were appealing to me to abort.</p>

  <p>The house trembled. It was a tremor that began far beneath it and throbbed
  up through every timber and stone. Instantly that which had feared and had
  appealed to me withdrew; sweeping down to the source of the trembling&mdash;
  or so it seemed to me. Again the house trembled. Trembled in actuality, for
  the door at my back quivered. The trembling increased and became a shuddering
  under which the solid old hand-hewn joists creaked and groaned. There
  followed a distant, rhythmic thudding.</p>

  <p>It ceased, and the old house quivered, then seemed to settle, and again
  the joists cracked and groaned. Then a stunned silence... and again the
  ghosts of the old house were around me, outrage in their wrath, panic in
  their fear, crying, crying to me to hear them... to understand them.</p>

  <p>I could not understand them... I walked to the window, and crouched there,
  peering out. It was a dark night, sultry and oppressive. There was a flashing
  of lightning from far beneath the horizon and faint distant rumbling of
  thunder. I went quickly about the room looking for some weapon, but could
  find none. My intention was to get into my room, clothe myself and then hunt
  down Dahut and de Keradel. Precisely what I was going to do after I found
  them I did not know&mdash;except to end their sorceries. All confusion as to
  whether these were sorceries or super-illusions was gone. They were evil
  realities belonging to a dark wisdom evilly used... none should be allowed to
  live to wield this evil power... and they were swiftly mounting to some
  dreadful climax which must be thwarted at any cost...</p>

  <p>The ghosts of the old house were silent&mdash;I had gotten their message
  at last. They were silent, but they had lost none of their fear, and they
  were watching me. I went to the door. Some obscure impulse made me pick up
  the white robe and throw it around me. I stepped out into the hall. It was
  filled with shadows but I gave them no heed. Why should I, who myself had
  been a shadow. As I passed, they clustered and crept behind me. And now I
  knew that the shadows too were afraid, like the old house... were cringing
  before some imminent and dreadful doom... like the ghosts were beseeching me
  to avert it...</p>

  <p>From below came the murmur of voices, then that of de Keradel raised in
  anger, and following it, the laughter of Dahut&mdash;taunting, mocking,
  brittle with menace. I slipped to the head of the stairs. The lower hall was
  but dimly lighted. The voices came from the big living room, and that the two
  were quarreling was evident, but their words were inaudible. I crept down the
  stairs and flattened myself beside the edge of one of the heavy curtains
  which covered the doorway.</p>

  <p>I heard de Keradel say, voice now level and controlled: "I tell you that
  it is finished. There remains only the last sacrifice... which I perform
  tonight. I do not need you for that, my daughter. Nor after it is done shall
  I ever need you more. And there is nothing you can do to stop it. The end
  toward which I have been working all my life has been reached. He... has told
  me. Now... He... will become wholly manifest and ascend His throne. And
  I&mdash;" all De Keradel's egotism was in his voice, colossal,
  blasphemous&mdash;"and I shall sit beside Him. He... has promised me. The
  dark power which men in all ages and in all lands have sought&mdash;the power
  which Atlantis almost attained and that Ys drew but thinly from the
  Cairn&mdash;the power for which the medieval world so feebly groped&mdash;
  that power will be mine. In all its fullness. In all its unconquerable might.
  There was a rite none knew, and... He... has taught me it. No, I need you no
  longer, Dahut. Yet I am loath to lose you. And... He... is inclined to you.
  But you would have a price to pay."</p>

  <p>There was a little silence, and then Dahut's voice, very still:</p>

  <p>"And that price, my father?"</p>

  <p>"The blood of your lover."</p>

  <p>He waited for her answer&mdash;as did I, but she made none, and he
  said:</p>

  <p>"I do not need it. I have pressed the paupers and have enough and to
  spare. But his would enrich it, and it would be acceptable to... Him. He...
  has told me so. It would strengthen His draught. And... He... has asked for
  it."</p>

  <p>She asked, slowly: "And if I refuse?"</p>

  <p>"It will not save him, my daughter."</p>

  <p>Again he waited for her to speak, then said with simulated and malicious
  wonder: "What&mdash;a Dahut of Ys to hesitate between her father and her
  lover! This man has a debt to pay, my daughter. An ancient one since it was
  for one who bore his name an ancestress of yours betrayed another father. Or
  was it you, Dahut? It is my duty to cancel that ancient wrong... lest,
  perchance, it should recur."</p>

  <p>She asked, quietly: "And if I refuse&mdash;what of me?" He laughed: "How
  can I tell? Now, I am swayed by my fatherly impulses. But when I sit
  beside... Him... What you may mean to me I cannot know. Perhaps&mdash;
  nothing."</p>

  <p>She asked: "What shape will He assume?"</p>

  <p>"Any or all. There is no shape he cannot take. Be assured that it will not
  be the inchoate blackness which the dull minds of those who evoked... Him...
  by the rites of the Cairn forced upon... Him. No, no&mdash;He might even take
  the shape of your lover, Dahut. Why not? He... is inclined to you, my
  daughter."</p>

  <p>Now at this my skin grew cold, and the hatred I felt for him was like a
  band of hot iron around my temples, and I gathered myself to leap through the
  curtains and lock my hands around his throat. But the shadows held me back
  and whispered, and the ghosts of the old house whispered with them&mdash;
  "Not yet! Not yet!"</p>

  <p>He said: "Be wise, my daughter. Always this man has betrayed you. What are
  you with your shadows? What was Helen with her dolls? Children. Children
  playing with toys. With shadows and dolls! Pass from childhood, my daughter
  &mdash;give me the blood of your lover."</p>

  <p>She answered, musingly: "A child! I had forgotten that I had ever been a
  child."</p>

  <p>He made no reply to that. She seemed to wait for one; then said,
  tranquilly:</p>

  <p>"So you ask for the blood of my lover? Well&mdash;you shall not have
  it."</p>

  <p>There was the crash of an overthrown chair. I drew the curtain a hair's
  breadth aside and peered in. De Keradel stood at the head of the table
  glaring at Dahut. But it was not the face nor the body of the de Keradel I
  had known. His eyes were no longer pale blue... they were black, and his
  silvery hair seemed black and his body had grown... and long arms reached
  toward and long taloned fingers clutched at Dahut.</p>

  <p>She threw something down upon the table between her and him. I could not
  see what it was, but it sped like a racing, small and shining wave straight
  at him. And he threw himself back from it, and stood trembling, eyes again
  blue but suffused with blood, and body shrunken.</p>

  <p>"Beware, my father! Not yet do you sit on the throne with... Him. And I am
  still of the sea, my father. So beware!"</p>

  <p>There was a shuffle of feet behind me. The blank-eyed butler was at my
  side. He started to kneel&mdash;and then the vagueness went from his eyes. He
  sprang at me, mouth opening to cry alarm. Before he could make a sound, my
  hands were around his throat, thumbs crushing into his larynx, my knee in his
  groin. With a strength I had never before known, I lifted him by his neck and
  held him up from the floor. His legs wrapped round me and I thrust my head
  under his chin and drew it sharply up. There was a faint snap and his body
  went limp. I carried it back along the hall and set it noiselessly on the
  floor. The whole brief struggle had been soundless. His eyes, blank enough
  now, stared up at me. I searched him. In his belt was a sheath, and in that a
  long, curved, razor-sharp knife.</p>

  <p>Now I had a weapon. I rolled the body under a deep settee, stole back to
  the living room and peeped through the curtains. It was empty, Dahut and de
  Keradel gone.</p>

  <p>I stepped back for a moment into the cover of the curtains. I knew now
  what it was the ghosts of the old house had feared. Knew the meaning of the
  trembling and the rhythmic thudding. The cavern of the sacrifices had been
  destroyed. It had served its purpose. How had de Keradel put it?... that he
  had "pressed the paupers" and had enough and more than enough blood for the
  last sacrifice. Incongruously, a line came into my mind&mdash;"He is
  trampling out the wine press where the grapes of wrath are stored... " Not so
  incongruous... I thought: De Keradel has trampled out another wine press for
  the Gatherer's drink. My blood was to have been mixed with it, but Dahut had
  refused to let it be!</p>

  <p>I felt no gratitude toward her for that. She was a spider who thought her
  fly securely in her web, and was resisting another spider's attempt to take
  it from her. That was all. But the fly was no longer in her web nor did it
  owe her for its release. If I felt increase of hatred for de Keradel, I felt
  no decrease of it for Dahut.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, what I had heard had changed the vague pattern of my
  vengeance. The design clarified. The shadows were wrong. Dahut must not die
  before her father. I had a better plan... it came to me from the Lord of
  Carnac whom Dahut thought had died in her arms... and he counseled me as he
  had counseled himself, long and long and long ago in ancient Ys.</p>

  <p>I walked up the stairs. The door to my room was open. I switched on the
  lights, boldly.</p>

  <p>Dahut was standing there, between me and the bed.</p>

  <p>She smiled&mdash;but her eyes did not. She walked toward me. I thrust the
  point of the long knife toward her. She stopped and laughed&mdash;but her
  eyes did not laugh. She said:</p>

  <p>"You are so elusive, my beloved. You have such a gift for
  disappearance."</p>

  <p>"You have told me that before, Dahut. And&mdash;" I touched my cheek
  "&mdash;have, even emphasized it."</p>

  <p>Her eyes misted, welled, and tears were on her cheeks: "You have much to
  forgive&mdash;but so have I, Alan."</p>

  <p>Well, that was true enough.</p>

  <p>... Beware... beware Dahut...</p>

  <p>"Where did you get your knife, Alan?"</p>

  <p>A practical question that steadied me; I answered it as practically: "From
  one of your men whom I killed."</p>

  <p>"'And would kill me with it&mdash;if I came close?"</p>

  <p>"Why not, Dahut? You sent me as a shadow into the shadowy land and I have
  learned its lesson."</p>

  <p>"What was that lesson, Alan?"</p>

  <p>"To be merciless."</p>

  <p>"But I am not merciless, Alan&mdash;else you would not be here."</p>

  <p>"Now I know you lie, Dahut. It was not you who released me from that
  bondage."</p>

  <p>She said: "I did not mean that... nor do I lie... and I am tempted to try
  you, Alan... " She came toward me, slowly. I held the point of the knife in
  readiness against her coming. She said:</p>

  <p>"Kill me if you want to. I have not much love for life. You are all that I
  love. If you will not love me&mdash;kill me."</p>

  <p>She was close; so close that the point of the knife touched her breast;
  she said: "Thrust&mdash;and end it."</p>

  <p>My hand dropped.</p>

  <p>"I cannot kill you, Dahut!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes softened, her face grew tender&mdash;but triumph lurked under the
  tenderness. She rested her hands on my shoulders; then kissed the whip-welts
  one by one, saying: "By this kiss I forgive... and by this I forgive... and
  by this I forgive..."</p>

  <p>She held her lips up to me: "Now kiss me, Alan&mdash;and with that kiss
  say that you forgive me."</p>

  <p>I kissed her, but I did not say that I forgave, nor did I.</p>

  <p>I let fall the knife. She trembled in my arms and clung to me and
  whispered: "Say it... say it..."</p>

  <p>I pushed her away from me and laughed: "Why are you so eager for
  forgiveness, Dahut? What do you fear that makes my forgiveness so desirable
  before your father kills me?"</p>

  <p>She asked: "How did you know he means to kill you?"</p>

  <p>"I heard him say so when he was making that pleasant little demand for my
  blood not long ago. Bargaining with you for me. Promising you a substitute
  who would be far more satisfactory... " Again I laughed... "Is my forgiveness
  a necessary part of that incarnation?"</p>

  <p>She said, breathlessly: "If you heard that, you must also know that I
  would not give you to him."</p>

  <p>I lied: "I do not. Just then your servant forced me to kill him. When I
  was free to resume my eavesdropping&mdash;returned, in fact, to cut your
  father's throat before he could cut mine&mdash;you and he had gone. I
  supposed the bargain closed. Father and daughter reunited and of one purpose
  &mdash;setting forth to prepare the funeral meats&mdash;myself, Dahut
  &mdash;to furnish forth the marriage tables. Thrift, thrift, Dahut!"</p>

  <p>She winced under my mockery; whitened. She said, strangled: "I made no
  bargain. I would not let him have you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>She said: "Because I love you."</p>

  <p>"But why this insistence upon my forgiveness?"</p>

  <p>"Because I love you. Because I want to wipe away the past. Begin afresh,
  beloved..."</p>

  <p>For a moment I had the queer feeling of double memory; that I had acted
  this scene before in minutest detail, had heard the same lines; and realized
  I had in that dream of ancient Ys, if dream it had been. And now, as then,
  she whispered piteously, despairingly: "You will not believe me beloved, what
  can I do to make you believe!"</p>

  <p>I answered: "Choose between your father&mdash;and me."</p>

  <p>She said: "But I have chosen, beloved. I have told you... " Again she
  whispered... "How can I make you believe!"</p>

  <p>I answered: "End his&mdash;sorceries."</p>

  <p>She said, contemptuously: "I do not fear him. And I no longer fear that
  which he evokes."</p>

  <p>I said: "But I do. End his&mdash;sorceries."</p>

  <p>She caught the pause this time, and its significance. Her eyes dilated,
  and for seconds she was silent, studying me. She said, slowly:</p>

  <p>"There is but one way to end them."</p>

  <p>I made no comment on that.</p>

  <p>She came to me and drew my head down to her and looked deep into my
  eyes:</p>

  <p>"If I do this... you will forgive me? You will love me? Never leave me...
  as once before you did... long and long and long ago, in Ys... when once
  before I chose between my father and you?..."</p>

  <p>"I will forgive you, Dahut. I will never leave you as long as you have
  life."</p>

  <p>That was true enough, but I closed every window of my mind so she might
  not glimpse the determination that was its source. And again, as it had been
  in Ys, I took her in my arms... and the lure of her lips and her body shook
  me and I felt my resolution weaken... but the life within me that had come
  from Helen was implacable, inexorable... hating Dahut as only one woman who
  loves a man can hate another who loves him...</p>

  <p>She loosed my arms from round her: "Dress, and wait for me here." She
  passed through the door.</p>

  <p>I dressed, but I kept the long knife close.</p>

  <p>The tapestry that concealed the secret panel wavered, and she was in the
  room. She wore an archaic robe of green; her sandals were green; her girdle
  was not golden but of clear green stones that held the shifting gleam of
  waves, and a wreath of green sea flowers bound her hair. Upon her wrist was
  the silver bracelet set with the black stone that bore in crimson the trident
  symbol which was the summoning name of the sea-god. She looked like a
  sea-god's daughter...</p>

  <p>I felt my resolution weakening again until she came close and I could see
  clearly her face. It was unsmiling, and the mouth was cruel, and the hell-
  sparks were beginning their dance in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She lifted her arms and touched my eyes with her fingers, closing them.
  The touch of her fingers was like that of cold sea-spray.</p>

  <p>"Come!" she said.</p>

  <p>The ghosts of the old house were whispering: "Go with her... but
  beware!..."</p>

  <p>The shadows were whispering: "Go with her... but beware!"</p>

  <p>"Beware Dahut... " My hand tightened on the knife hilt as I followed
  her.</p>

  <p>We went out of the old house. It was strange how plainly I could see. The
  sky was heavy with clouds, the air murky. I knew the night must be dark
  indeed, yet every stone and bush and tree stood out plain, as though by some
  light of its own. Dahut led me by a dozen paces, nor could I lessen that
  distance, try as I might. She moved like a wave, and around her played a
  faint nimbus of palest golden green like the phosphorescence that sometimes
  clothes a wave moving through darkness.</p>

  <p>The shadows flittered and swayed around us, interlacing, flowing in and
  out of each other, like shadows cast by some great tree fretted by a fitful
  wind. The shadows followed us, and flanked us, and swayed before us&mdash;
  but they shrank from Dahut, and never was there one between her and me.</p>

  <p>There was a glow beyond the oaks where were the standing stones. It was
  not the wan gleam of the corposants. It was a steady, ruddy glow as from
  still fires. I heard no chanting.</p>

  <p>She did not go toward the oaks. She took a way that led upward to the
  ridge of rocks hiding the standing stones from the water. Soon the path
  topped the ridge, and the open sea lay before me. It was a sullen sea and
  dark, with long, slow swells breaking sluggishly on the ledges.</p>

  <p>The path climbed steeply over a cliff which lifted above the waves a full
  two hundred feet. And suddenly Dahut was on its crest, poised on its verge,
  arms outstretched to the sea. From her lips came a call, low and inhumanly
  sweet; in it the plaintiveness of the gull's cry, the singing of waves over
  unfathomable, unspoiled deeps, the chant of deep-sea winds. It was a voice of
  the sea transmuted goldenly in a woman's throat, but losing no inhuman
  quality and taking on no human one.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that the surges stopped as though listening while that cry
  went forth.</p>

  <p>Again she sent the call... and once again. And after that she cupped her
  hands to mouth and cried a word... a name.</p>

  <p>From far out at sea there came a roaring answer. A long white line of foam
  sped from the darkness, a great comber whose top was the tossing manes of
  hundreds of white horses. It raced shouting against the ridge and broke.</p>

  <p>A column of spume swept up and touched her outstretched hands. It seemed
  to me that something passed to it from her hands, and that as the spume fell
  something within it glittered silver with glint of scarlet.</p>

  <p>I climbed up to her. There was no hint of tenderness now in her eyes or
  face. Only triumph... and her eyes were violet flames. She lifted a fold of
  her dress, veiling eyes and face from me.</p>

  <p>The bracelet of Ys was gone from her arm!</p>

  <p>She beckoned, and I followed her. We skirted the ridge, and ever the ruddy
  glow grew brighter. I saw that the surges were no longer sullen, but that
  great waves marched with us, clamoring, white banners of foam streaming,
  white manes of the sea-horses tossing.</p>

  <p>The path ran now below the crest of the ridge. Ahead, on the landward
  side, was another upthrust of rock, and here again she waited for me. She
  stood with face averted, still covered by the fold. She pointed to the rock;
  she said:</p>

  <p>"Climb&mdash;and see." Once more the spray-cold fingers touched my eyes...
  "And hear"... they touched my ears.</p>

  <p>She was gone.</p>

  <p>I climbed the rock. I scrambled over its top.</p>

  <p>Strong hands caught my arms, pinioning them behind me, forcing me to my
  knees. I twisted and looked into the face of McCann. He was bending, his face
  close to mine, peering as though he found it difficult to see me clearly.</p>

  <p>I cried: "McCann!"</p>

  <p>He swore, incredulously, released me. Someone else was on the rock&mdash;
  a lean and dark man with thin, ascetic face and snow-white hair. He, too, was
  leaning and peering at me as though he found it difficult to see me. That was
  odd, for I could see them both clearly. I knew him... he had been in the old
  room where my shadow search for Helen had ended... Ricori.</p>

  <p>McCann was stammering: "Caranac&mdash;my God, boss, Caranac!"</p>

  <p>I whispered, steeling myself against any blow:</p>

  <p>"Helen?"</p>

  <p>"She lives." It was Ricori who answered.</p>

  <p>My whole body went weak with reaction so that I would have fallen had he
  not caught me. A new fear took me: "But will she live?"</p>

  <p>He said: "She has had a&mdash;strange experience. When we left her she was
  fully conscious. Steadily growing stronger. Her brother is with her. You are
  all she needs. We are here to take you back to her."</p>

  <p>I said: "No. Not until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gale blast that closed my mouth as though a hand had struck it. Crash of
  wave against the ridge, shaking it. I felt the spray of it on my face, and it
  was like the whip of Dahut and it was like the cold fingers of her on my
  eyes...</p>

  <p>And suddenly McCann and Ricori seemed unreal and shadowy. And suddenly I
  seemed to see the shining body of Dahut swaying onward upon the path between
  the sea and the ridge... and I heard a voice in my heart&mdash;the Lord of
  Carnac's voice and mine: How can I kill her, evil as I know her to be?...</p>

  <p>Ricori's voice... how long had he been talking?... "and so when last night
  you did not appear, I used, as you had suggested&mdash;my judgment. After we
  were assured of her safety, we set out. We persuaded the guardians of the
  gates to let us enter. They will guard no more gates. We saw the lights, and
  we thought that where they were you would most likely be. We distributed our
  men, and McCann and I came by chance upon this excellent place for
  observation. We saw neither you nor the Demoiselle Dahut..."</p>

  <p>... Dahut!... another wave broke upon the rock, and shook it, then surged
  back shouting shouting&mdash;Dahut! Another gust roared over the rock
  roaring&mdash;Dahut! Ricori was saying: "They are down there, awaiting our
  signal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I interrupted, attention abruptly centered: "Signal for what?"</p>

  <p>He said: "To stop what is going on down there."</p>

  <p>He pointed toward the inward edge of the rock, and I saw that its edge was
  outlined black against depths of the ruddy light. I walked to the edge and
  looked down.</p>

  <p>The Cairn was plain before me. I thought: How strangely close it seems...
  how stark the monoliths stand out!</p>

  <p>It was as though the Cairn were but a few yards away... de Keradel so
  close that I could reach out my hand and touch him. I knew that there were
  many of the standing stones between me and the Cairn, and that it must be a
  full thousand feet away. Yet not only could I see the Cairn as though I were
  beside it, I could see within it as well.</p>

  <p>Strange, too, although the wind was roaring overhead and whipping us on
  the rock, that the fires before the Cairn burned steadily; flickering only
  when those who fed them sprinkled them from the black ewers they carried...
  and that although the wind came from the sea, the smoke of the fires streamed
  straight against it.</p>

  <p>And strange how silent it was down there among the monoliths when steadily
  grew the shouting and the clamor of the sea... nor did the flashing of the
  lightning marching ever higher dim the fires, nor did the rumbling thunder
  invade the silence of the plain more than did the clamor of the
  combers...</p>

  <p>Those who fed the fires were not now in white but in red. And de Keradel
  was clothed in a robe of red instead of the white robe of the sacrifices. He
  wore the black belt and the cincture but the shifting symbols on them
  glittered not silver but scarlet...</p>

  <p>There were ten of the fires, in a semi-circle between the three altars and
  the monoliths which faced the threshold of the Cairn. Each was a little more
  than a man's height, and they burned with a cone-shaped, still flame. From
  the peak of each arose a column of smoke. They were as thick as the arm of a
  man, these columns, and having risen twice the height of the fires, they
  curved, and then streamed straight toward the threshold of the Cairn. They
  were like ten black arteries of which the ten fires were the hearts, and they
  were threaded with crimson filaments, like little fiery veins.</p>

  <p>The blackened hollowed stone was hidden by a greater fire which burned not
  only red but black. Nor was this, like the others, a still flame. It pulsed
  with slow and rhythmic beat&mdash;as though in truth it were a heart. Between
  it and the great slab of granite upon which he had beaten in the breasts of
  the sacrifices stood de Keradel.</p>

  <p>There was something lying upon the stone of sacrifice, covering it. At
  first I thought it a man, a giant, lying there. Then I saw that it was an
  immense vessel, strangely shaped, and hollow.</p>

  <p>A vat.</p>

  <p>I could look into this vat. It was half-filled with a clotted, reddish-
  black fluid over the surface of which ran tiny flames. Not pale and dead like
  the corposants, but crimson and filled with evil life. It was to this vat
  that the blank-eyed men who fed the fires came to have their ewers refilled.
  And it was from it that de Keradel took that which he sprinkled upon the
  pulsing fire and his hands and his arms were red with it.</p>

  <p>On the threshold of the Cairn was another vessel, a huge bowl like a
  shallow baptismal font. It was filled, and over its surface ran the crimson
  flames.</p>

  <p>The smoke from the lesser fires, the ten crimson-threaded arteries, met in
  the thicker column that arose from the throbbing fire, mingled with it, and
  streamed as one into the Cairn.</p>

  <p>The silence of the plain was broken by a whispering, a faint wailing, and
  up from the bases of the monoliths shadows began to rise. They lifted, as I
  had first seen them, to their knees... and then they were wrenched from the
  earth, and whimpering, wailing, were sucked into the Cairn... beating about
  it... fighting to escape.</p>

  <p>Within the Cairn was the Gatherer... the Blackness.</p>

  <p>From the first I had known It was there. It was no longer shapeless,
  nebulous&mdash;part of an infinitely greater Something that dwelt in space
  and beyond space. The Gatherer was breaking loose... taking form. The small
  crimson flames were running through It... like corpuscles of evil blood. It
  was condensing, steadily becoming material.</p>

  <p>That which filled the font on the threshold of the Cairn was empty.</p>

  <p>De Keradel filled it from the vat... and again... and again.</p>

  <p>The Gatherer drank from the font and fed upon the shadows, and upon the
  smoke of the fires which were fed by blood. And steadily It assumed
  shape.</p>

  <p>I stepped back, covering my eyes.</p>

  <p>Ricori said: "What do you see? All I see are men in red, far away, who
  feed fires&mdash;and another who stands before the house of stones... what do
  you see, Caranac?"</p>

  <p>I whispered: "I see Hell opening."</p>

  <p>I forced myself to look again at that which was being spawned from the
  Cairn's stone womb... and stood, unable now to look away... I heard a voice,
  my own voice, screaming&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Dahut... Dahut... before it is too late!"</p>

  <p>As though in answer, there was a lull in the clamor of the sea. Upon the
  ridge at our left appeared a point of brilliant green light... whether far
  away or near I could not tell with that strange witch-sight Dahut had given
  me. It became an oval of brilliant emerald...</p>

  <p>It became&mdash;Dahut!</p>

  <p>Dahut... clothed with pale green sea-fires, her eyes like violet sea-
  pools and wide so wide that they were ringed with white; her slim black brows
  a bar above them; her face white as foam and cruel and mocking; her hair like
  spin-drift of silver. Far away or not, she seemed as close to me as did de
  Keradel. It was as if she stood just above the Cairn... could reach out, as
  I, and touch de Keradel. To me that night, as in the shadowy land, there was
  no such thing as distance.</p>

  <p>I caught Ricori's wrist, pointed and whispered: "Dahut!"</p>

  <p>He said: "I saw far away and dimly a shining figure. I thought it a woman.
  With your hand upon me, I seem to see her more plainly. What do you see,
  Caranac?"</p>

  <p>I said: "I see Dahut. She is laughing. Her eyes are the eyes of no
  woman... nor is her face. She is laughing, I say... can't you hear her,
  Ricori? She calls to de Keradel... how sweet her voice and how merciless...
  like the sea! She calls&mdash;'My father, I am here!' He sees her... the
  Thing in the Cairn is aware of her... de Keradel cries to her&mdash;'Too
  late, my daughter!' He is mocking, contemptuous... but the Thing in the Cairn
  is not. It strains... toward completion. Dahut calls again, 'Is my bridegroom
  born? Is the labor done? Your midwifery successful? My bedfellow delivered?'
  Can't you hear, Ricori? It is as though she stood beside me..."</p>

  <p>He said: "I hear nothing."</p>

  <p>I said: "I do not like this jesting, Ricori. It is&mdash;dreadful. The
  Thing in the Cairn does not like it... although de Keradel laughs... It
  reaches out from the Cairn... to the vat on the stone of sacrifice... It
  drinks... It grows... God!... Dahut... Dahut!"</p>

  <p>The shining figure raised hand as though she heard... and bent toward
  me... and I felt the touch of her fingers on eyes and ears... her lips on
  mine...</p>

  <p>She faced the sea and threw wide her arms. She cried the Name, softly
  &mdash;and the sea winds stilled... again, like one who summons as of right
  &mdash;and the shouting of the combers waned... a third time, jubilantly.</p>

  <p>Shouting of the combers, thunder of the surges, roaring of the winds, all
  the clamor of sea and air, arose in a mighty diapason. It melted into chaotic
  uproar, elemental bellowing. And suddenly all the sea was covered with the
  tossing manes of the white sea-horses... armies of the white horses of the
  sea... the white horses of Poseidon... line upon endless line racing out of
  the darkness of ocean and charging against the shore.</p>

  <p>Beyond the lower line of the ridge between that high rock on which stood
  Dahut and this high rock on which stood I, arose a mountain of water...
  lifting, lifting swiftly, yet deliberately. Changing shape as it lifted ever
  higher... gathering power as it lifted. Up it lifted and up; a hundred feet,
  two hundred feet above the edge. It paused, and its top flattened. Its top
  became a gigantic hammer...</p>

  <p>And beyond it I seemed to see a vast and misty shape towering to the
  clouds, its head wreathed with the clouds and crowned with the
  lightnings...</p>

  <p>The hammer swung down... down upon the Thing in the Cairn... down upon de
  Keradel and the red-clad, blank-eyed men... down upon the monoliths.</p>

  <p>The Cairn and the monoliths were covered with waters, boiling, spouting,
  smashing at the standing stones. Uprooting, overturning them.</p>

  <p>For an instant I saw the evil fires glare through the waters. Then they
  were gone.</p>

  <p>For an instant I heard an unearthly shrilling from the stone womb of the
  Cairn, and saw a Blackness veined with crimson flames writhing under the
  hammer stroke of the waters. Struggling in the myriad arms of the waters.
  Then it, too, was gone.</p>

  <p>The waters rushed back. They licked up at us as they passed and a wave
  swirled round us knee high. It dropped... chuckling.</p>

  <p>Again the mountain arose, hammer topped. Again it swept over the ridge and
  smote the Cairn and the standing stones. And this time the waters rushed on
  so that the oaks fell before them... and once more they retreated... and once
  more they lifted and struck and swept on... and now I knew that the old house
  with all its ghosts was gone...</p>

  <p>Through all, the sea-fire shape of Dahut had remained unmoved, untouched.
  I had heard her merciless laughter above the bellowing of the sea and the
  crashing of the hammer strokes.</p>

  <p>Back rushed the last waters. Dahut held her arms out to me, calling:</p>

  <p>"Alain... come to me, Alain!"</p>

  <p>Clearly could I see the path between her and me. It was as though she were
  close... close. But I knew she was not and that it was the witch-sight she
  had given me that made it seem so. I said:</p>

  <p>"Good luck, McCann. Good luck, Ricori&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Alan... come to me, Alan..."</p>

  <p>My hand dropped on the hilt of the long knife. I shouted: "Coming&mdash;
  Dahut!"</p>

  <p>McCann gripped me. Ricori struck down at his hands. He said: "Let him
  go."</p>

  <p>"... Alan... come to me..."</p>

  <p>The waters were rushing back, over the ridge. A swirl swept out. It coiled
  around Dahut to the waist. It lifted her... high and high...</p>

  <p>And instantly from over her and from every side of her a cloud of shadows
  swept upon her... striking at her with shadowy hands... thrusting at her,
  hurling themselves at her, pushing her back and down... into the sea.</p>

  <p>I saw incredulity flood her face, then outraged revolt, then terror
  &mdash;and then despair.</p>

  <p>The wave crashed back into the sea, and with it went Dahut, the shadows
  pouring after her...</p>

  <p>I heard myself crying: Dahut... Dahut!</p>

  <p>I rushed to the verge of the rock. There was a prolonged flaring of the
  lightning. By it I saw Dahut... face upturned, hair floating around her like
  a silver net, her eyes wide and horror-filled and... dying.</p>

  <p>The shadows were all around her and over her... pushing her down...
  down...</p>

  <p>The witch-sight was fading from my eyes. The witch-hearing stilling in my
  ears. Before that sight went, I saw de Keradel lying on the threshold of the
  Cairn, crushed beneath one of its great stones. The stone had pulped the
  breast and heart of de Keradel as he had pulped the breasts and hearts of the
  sacrifices. There were only his head and his arms... his face upturned, dead
  eyes wide and filled with hate, dead hands held high in imprecation and in
  &mdash;appeal...</p>

  <p>The Cairn was flat, and of the standing stones not one was erect...</p>

  <p>Witch-sight and witch-hearing were gone. The land was dark save for the
  glare of the lightning. The sea was dark save for the foaming tops of the
  waves. Their shouting was the voice of waves&mdash;and nothing more. The
  roaring of the wind was the voice of the wind&mdash;and nothing more.</p>

  <p>Dahut was dead...</p>

  <p>I asked Ricori: "What did you see?"</p>

  <p>"Three waves. They destroyed all that was below. They killed my men!"</p>

  <p>"I saw much more than that, Ricori. Dahut is dead. It is ended, Ricori.
  Dahut is dead and her witchcraft ended. We must wait here till morning. Then
  we can go back... back to Helen..."</p>

  <p>Dahut was dead...</p>

  <p>She was dead as of old, long and long and long ago in Ys... by her shadows
  and by her wickednesses... by the sea... and by me.</p>

  <p>Would I have killed her with the long knife had I reached her before the
  wave?</p>

  <p>The cycle had been reborn and it had ended as it had of old, long and long
  and long ago... in Ys.</p>

  <p>The sea had cleansed this place of her sorceries as it had cleansed Ys of
  them in that long and long and long ago.</p>

  <p>Had there been a Helen in Carnac when I set forth from Carnac to Ys to
  slay Dahut?</p>

  <p>Had she cleansed me of the memories of Dahut when I returned to her?</p>

  <p>Could&mdash;Helen?</p>
