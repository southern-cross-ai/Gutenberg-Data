<h3><a name="1_0_2">Preface</a></h3>

<p>This little volume has but one purpose&mdash;to give an authentic,
useful, and readable account of the Pony Express. This wonderful
enterprise played an important part in history, and demonstrated what
American spirit can accomplish. It showed that the "heroes of sixty-one"
were not all south of Mason and Dixon's line fighting each other. And,
strange to say, little of a formal nature has been written concerning
it.</p>

<p>I have sought to bring to light and make accessible to all readers the
more important facts of the Pony Express&mdash;its inception,
organization and development, its importance to history, its historical
background, and some of the anecdotes incidental to its operation.</p>

<p>The subject leads one into a wide range of fascinating material, all
interesting though much of it is irrelevant. In itself this material is
fragmentary and incoherent. It would be quite easy to fill many pages
with western adventure having no special bearing upon the central topic.
While I have diverged occasionally from the thread of the narrative, my
purpose has been merely to give where possible more background to the
story, that the account as a whole might be more understandable in its
relation to the general facts of history.</p>

<p>Special acknowledgment is due Frank A. Root of Topeka, Kansas, joint
author with William E. Connelley of The Overland Stage To California, an
excellent compendium of data on many phases of the subject. In preparing
this work, various Senate Documents have been of great value. Some
interesting material is found in Inman and Cody's Salt Lake Trail.</p>

<p>The files of the Century Magazine, old newspaper files, Bancroft's
colossal history of the West and the works of Samuel L. Clemens have also
been of value in compiling the present book.</p>

<h3><a name="1_0_3">Chapter I. At A Nation's Crisis</a></h3>

<p>The Pony Express was the first rapid transit and the first fast mail
line across the continent from the Missouri River to the Pacific Coast.
It was a system by means of which messages were carried swiftly on
horseback across the plains and deserts, and over the mountains of the
far West. It brought the Atlantic coast and the Pacific slope ten days
nearer to each other.</p>

<p>It had a brief existence of only sixteen months and was supplanted by
the transcontinental telegraph. Yet it was of the greatest importance in
binding the East and West together at a time when overland travel was
slow and cumbersome, and when a great national crisis made the rapid
communication of news between these sections an imperative necessity.</p>

<p>The Pony Express marked the highest development in overland travel
prior to the coming of the Pacific railroad, which it preceded nine
years. It, in fact, proved the feasibility of a transcontinental road and
demonstrated that such a line could be built and operated continuously
the year around&mdash;a feat that had always been regarded as
impossible.</p>

<p>The operation of the Pony Express was a supreme achievement of
physical endurance on the part of man and his ever faithful companion,
the horse. The history of this organization should be a lasting monument
to the physical sacrifice of man and beast in an effort to accomplish
something worth while. Its history should be an enduring tribute to
American courage and American organizing genius.</p>

<p>The fall of Fort Sumter in April, 1861, did not produce the Civil War
crisis. For many months, the gigantic struggle then imminent, had been
painfully discernible to far-seeing men. In 1858, Lincoln had forewarned
the country in his "House Divided" speech. As early as the beginning of
the year 1860 the Union had been plainly in jeopardy. Early in February
of that momentous year, Jefferson Davis, on behalf of the South, had
introduced his famous resolutions in the Senate of the United States.
This document was the ultimatum of the dissatisfied slave-holding
commonwealths. It demanded that Congress should protect slavery
throughout the domain of the United States. The territories, it declared,
were the common property of the states of the Union and hence open to the
citizens of all states with all their personal possessions. The Northern
states, furthermore, were no longer to interfere with the working of the
Fugitive Slave Act. They must repeal their Personal Liberty laws and
respect the Dred Scott Decision of the Federal Supreme Court. Neither in
their own legislatures nor in Congress should they trespass upon the
right of the South to regulate slavery as it best saw fit.</p>

<p>These resolutions, demanding in effect that slavery be thus
safeguarded &mdash;almost to the extent of introducing it into the free
states&mdash;really foreshadowed the Democratic platform of 1860 which
led to the great split in that party, the victory of the Republicans
under Lincoln, the subsequent secession of the more radical southern
states, and finally the Civil War, for it was inevitable that the North,
when once aroused, would bitterly resent such pro-slavery demands.</p>

<p>And this great crisis was only the bursting into flame of many smaller
fires that had long been smoldering. For generations the two sections had
been drifting apart. Since the middle of the seventeenth century, Mason
and Dixon's line had been a line of real division separating two
inherently distinct portions of the country.</p>

<p>By 1860, then, war was inevitable. Naturally, the conflict would at
once present intricate military problems, and among them the retention of
the Pacific Coast was of the deepest concern to the Union. Situated at a
distance of nearly two thousand miles from the Missouri river which was
then the nation's western frontier, this intervening space comprised
trackless plains, almost impenetrable ranges of snow-capped mountains,
and parched alkali deserts. And besides these barriers of nature which
lay between the West coast and the settled eastern half of the country,
there were many fierce tribes of savages who were usually on the alert to
oppose the movements of the white race through their dominions.</p>

<p>California, even then, was the jewel of the Pacific. Having a
considerable population, great natural wealth, and unsurpassed climate
and fertility, she was jealously desired by both the North and the
South.</p>

<p>To the South, the acquisition of California meant enhanced prestige -
involving, as it would, the occupation of a large area whose soils and
climate might encourage the perpetuation of slavery; it meant a rich
possession which would afford her a strategic base for waging war against
her northern foe; it meant a romantic field in which opportunity might be
given to organize an allied republic of the Pacific, a power which would,
perchance, forcibly absorb the entire Southwest and a large section of
Northern Mexico. By thus creating counter forces the South would
effectively block the Federal Government on the western half of the
continent.</p>

<p>The North also desired the prestige that would come from holding
California as well as the material strength inherent in the state's
valuable resources. Moreover to hold this region would give the North a
base of operations to check her opponent in any campaign of aggression in
the far West, should the South presume such an attempt. And the
possession of California would also offer to the North the very best
means of protecting the Western frontier, one of the Union's most
vulnerable points of attack.</p>

<p>It was with such vital conditions that the Pony Express was
identified; it was in retaining California for the Union, and in helping
incidentally to preserve the Union, that the Express became an important
factor in American history.</p>

<p>Not to mention the romance, the unsurpassed courage, the unflinching
endurance, and the wonderful exploits which the routine operations of the
Pony Express involved, its identity with problems of nation-wide and
world-wide importance make its story seem worth telling. And with its
romantic existence and its place in history the succeeding pages of this
book will briefly deal.</p>

<h3><a name="1_0_4">Chapter II. Inception and Organization of the Pony
Express</a></h3>

<p>Following the discovery of gold in California in January 1848, that
region sprang into immediate prominence. From all parts of the country
and the remote corners of the earth came the famous Forty-niners. Amid
the chaos of a great mining camp the Anglo-Saxon love of law and order
soon asserted itself. Civil and religious institutions quickly arose,
and, in the summer of 1850, a little more than a year after the big rush
had started, California entered the Union as a free state.</p>

<p>The boom went on and the census of 1860 revealed a population of
380,000 in the new commonwealth. And when to these figures were added
those of Oregon and Washington Territory, an aggregate of 444,000
citizens of the United States were found to be living on the Pacific
Slope. Crossing the Sierras eastward and into the Great Basin, 47,000
more were located in the Territories of Nevada and Utah,&mdash;thus
making a grand total of nearly a half million people beyond the Rocky
Mountains in 1860. And these figures did not include Indians nor
Chinese.</p>

<p>Without reference to any military phase of the problem, this detached
population obviously demanded and deserved adequate mail and
transportation facilities. How to secure the quickest and most dependable
communication with the populous sections of the East had long been a
serious proposition. Private corporations and Congress had not been
wholly insensible to the needs of the West. Subsidized stage routes had
for some years been in operation, and by the close of 1858 several lines
were well-equipped and doing much business over the so-called Southern
and Central routes. Perhaps the most common route for sending mail from
the East to the Pacific Coast was by steamship from New York to Panama
where it was unloaded, hurried across the Isthmus, and again shipped by
water to San Francisco. All these lines of traffic were slow and tedious,
a letter in any case requiring from three to four weeks to reach its
destination. The need of a more rapid system of communication between the
East and West at once became apparent and it was to supply this need that
the Pony Express really came into existence.</p>

<p>The story goes that in the autumn of 1854, United States Senator
William Gwin of California was making an overland trip on horseback from
San Francisco to Washington, D. C. He was following the Central route via
Salt Lake and South Pass, and during a portion of his journey he had for
a traveling companion, Mr. B. F. Ficklin, then General Superintendent for
the big freighting and stage firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell of
Leavenworth. Ficklin, it seems, was a resourceful and progressive man,
and had long been engaged in the overland transportation business. He had
already conceived an idea for establishing a much closer transit service
between the Missouri river and the Coast, but, as is the case with many
innovators, had never gained a serious hearing. He had the traffic
agent's natural desire to better the existing service in the territory
which his line served; and he had the ambition of a loyal employee to put
into effect a plan that would bring added honor and preferment to his
firm. In addition to possessing these worthy ideals, it is perhaps not
unfair to state that Ficklin was personally ambitious.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ficklin confided his scheme enthusiastically to Senator
Gwin, at the same time pointing out the benefits that would accrue to
California should it ever be put into execution. The Senator at once saw
the merits of the plan and quickly caught the contagion. Not only was he
enough of a statesman to appreciate the worth of a fast mail line across
the continent, but he was also a good enough politician to realize that
his position with his constituents and the country at large might be
greatly strengthened were he to champion the enactment of a popular
measure that would encourage the building of such a line through the aid
of a Federal subsidy.</p>

<p>So in January, 1855, Gwin introduced in the Senate a bill which
proposed to establish a weekly letter express service between St. Louis
and San Francisco. The express was to operate on a ten-day schedule,
follow the Central Route, and was to receive a compensation not exceeding
$500.00 for each round trip. This bill was referred to the Committee on
Military Affairs where it was quietly tabled and "killed."</p>

<p>For the next five years the attention of Congress was largely taken up
with the anti-slavery troubles that led to secession and war. Although
the people of the West, and the Pacific Coast in particular, continued to
agitate the need of a new and quick through mail service, for a long time
little was done. It has been claimed that southern representatives in
Congress during the decade before the war managed to prevent any
legislation favorable to overland mail routes running North of the
slave-holding states; and that they concentrated their strength to render
government aid to the southern routes whenever possible.</p>

<p>At that time there were three generally recognized lines of mail
traffic, of which the Panama line was by far the most important. Next
came the so-called southern or "Butterfield" route which started from St.
Louis and ran far to the southward, entering California from the extreme
southeast corner of the state; a goodly amount of mail being sent in this
direction. The Central route followed the Platte River into Wyoming and
reached Sacramento via Salt Lake City, almost from a due easterly
direction. On account of its location this route or trail could be easily
controlled by the North in case of war. It had received very meagre
support from the Government, and carried as a rule, only local mail.
While the most direct route to San Francisco, it had been rendered the
least important. This was not due solely to Congressional manipulation.
Because of its northern latitude and the numerous high mountain ranges it
traversed, this course was often blockaded with deep snows and was
generally regarded as extremely difficult of access during the winter
months.</p>

<p>While a majority of the people of California were loyal to the Union,
there was a vigorous minority intensely in sympathy with the southern
cause and ready to conspire for, or bring about by force of arms if
necessary, the secession of their state. As the Civil War became more and
more imminent, it became obvious to Union men in both East and West that
the existing lines of communication were untrustworthy. Just as soon as
trouble should start, the Confederacy could, and most certainly would,
gain control of the southern mail routes. Once in control, she could
isolate the Pacific coast for many months and thus enable her
sympathizers there the more effectually to perfect their plans of
secession. Or she might take advantage of these lines of travel, and, by
striking swiftly and suddenly, organize and reinforce her followers in
California, intimidate the Unionists, many of whom were apathetic, and by
a single bold stroke snatch the prize away from her antagonist before the
latter should have had time to act.</p>

<p>To avert this crisis some daring and original plan of communication
had to be organized to keep the East and West in close contact with each
other; and the Pony Express was the fulfillment of such a plan, for it
made a close cooperation between the California loyalists and the Federal
Government possible until after the crisis did pass. Yet, strange as it
may seem, this providential enterprise was not brought into existence nor
even materially aided by the Government. It was organized and operated by
a private corporation after having been encouraged in its inception by a
United States Senator who later turned traitor to his country.</p>

<p>It finally happened that in the winter of 1859-60, Mr. William
Russell, senior partner of the firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, was
called to Washington in connection with some Government freight
contracts. While there he chanced to become acquainted with Senator Gwin
who, having been aroused, as we have seen, several years before, by one
of the firm's subordinates, at once brought before Mr. Russell the need
of better mail connections over the Central route, and of the especial
need of better communication should war occur.</p>

<p>Russell at once awoke to the situation. While a loyal citizen and
fully alive to the strategic importance which the matter involved, he
also believed that he saw a good business opening. Could his firm but
grasp the opportunity, and demonstrate the possibility of keeping the
Central route open during the winter months, and could they but lower the
schedule of the Panama line, a Government contract giving them a virtual
monopoly in carrying the transcontinental mail might eventually be
theirs.</p>

<p>He at once hurried West, and at Fort Leavenworth met his partners,
Messrs. Majors and Waddell, to whom he confidently submitted the new
proposition. Much to Russell's chagrin, these gentlemen were not elated
over the plan. While passively interested, they keenly foresaw the great
cost which a year around overland fast mail service would involve. They
were unable to see any chance of the enterprise paying expenses, to say
nothing of profits. But Russell, with cheerful optimism, contended that
while the project might temporarily be a losing venture, it would pay out
in time. He asserted that the opportunity of making good with a hard
undertaking&mdash;one that had been held impossible of
realization&mdash;would be a strong asset to the firm's reputation. He
also declared that in his conversation with Gwin he had already committed
their company to the undertaking, and he did not see how they could, with
honor and propriety, evade the responsibility of attempting it. Knowledge
of the last mentioned fact at once enlisted the support or his partners.
Probably no firm has ever surpassed in integrity that of Russell, Majors,
and Waddell, famous throughout the West in the freighting and mail
business before the advent of railroads in that section of the men, the
verbal promise of one of their number was a binding guarantee and as
sacredly respected as a bonded obligation. Finding themselves thus
committed, they at once began preparations with tremendous activity. All
this happened early in the year 1860.</p>

<p>The first step was to form a corporation, the more adequately to
conduct the enterprise; and to that end the Central Overland California
and Pike's Peak Express Company was organized under a charter granted by
the Territory of Kansas. Besides the three original members of the firm,
the incorporators included General Superintendent B. F. Ficklin, together
with F. A. Bee, W. W. Finney, and John S. Jones, all tried and
trustworthy stage employees who were retained on account of their wide
experience in the overland traffic business. The new concern then took
over the old stage line from Atchison to Salt Lake City and purchased the
mail route and outfit then operating between Salt Lake City and
Sacramento. The latter, which had been running a monthly round trip stage
between these terminals, was known as the West End Division of the
Central Route, and was called the Chorpenning line.</p>

<p>Besides conducting the Pony Express, the corporation aimed to continue
a large passenger and freighting business, so it next absorbed the
Leavenworth and Pike's Peak Express Co., which had been organized a year
previously and had maintained a daily stage between Leavenworth and
Denver, on the Smoky Hill River Route.</p>

<p>By mutual agreement, Mr. Russell assumed managerial charge of the
Eastern Division of the Pony Express line which lay between St. Joseph
and Salt Lake City. Ficklin was stationed at Salt Lake City, the middle
point, in a similar capacity. Finney was made Western manager with
headquarters at San Francisco. These men now had to revise the route to
be traversed, equip it with relay or relief stations which must be
provisioned for men and horses, hire dependable men as station-keepers
and riders, and buy high grade horses[1] or ponies for the entire course,
nearly two thousand miles in extent. Between St. Joseph and Salt Lake
City, the company had its old stage route which was already well supplied
with stations. West of Salt Lake the old Chorpenning route had been
poorly equipped, which made it necessary to erect new stations over much
of this course of more than seven hundred miles. The entire line of
travel had to be altered in many places, in some instances to shorten the
distance, and in others, to avoid as much as possible, wild places where
Indians might easily ambush the riders.</p>

<p>The management was fortunate in having the assistance of expert
subordinates. A. B. Miller of Leavenworth, a noteworthy employe of the
original firm, was invaluable in helping to formulate the general plans
of organization. At Salt Lake City, Ficklin secured the services of J. C.
Brumley, resident agent of the company, whose vast knowledge of the route
and the country that it covered enabled him quickly to work out a
schedule, and to ascertain with remarkable accuracy the number of relay
and supply stations, their best location, and also the number of horses
and men needed. At Carson City, Nevada, Bolivar Roberts, local
superintendent of the Western Division, hired upwards of sixty riders,
cool-headed nervy men, hardened by years of life in the open. Horses were
purchased throughout the West. They were the best that money could buy
and ranged from tough California cayuses or mustangs to thoroughbred
stock from Iowa. They were bought at an average figure of $200.00 each, a
high price in those days. The men were the pick of the frontier; no more
expressive description of their qualities can be given. They were hired
at salaries varying from $50.00 to $150.00 per month, the riders
receiving the highest pay of any below executive rank. When fully
equipped, the line comprised 190 stations, about 420 horses, 400 station
men and assistants and eighty riders. These are approximate figures, as
they varied slightly from time to time.</p>

<p>Perfecting these plans and assembling this array of splendid equipment
had been no easy task, yet so well had the organizers understood their
business, and so persistently, yet quietly, had they worked, that they
accomplished their purpose and made ready within two months after the
project had been launched. The public was scarcely aware of what was
going on until conspicuous advertisements announced the Pony Express. It
was planned to open the line early in April.</p>

<p>[1] While always called the Pony Express, there were many blooded
horses as well as ponies in the service. The distinction between these
types of animals is of course well known to the average reader. Probably
"Pony" Express "sounded better" than any other name for the service,
hence the adoption of this name by the firm and the public at large. This
book will use the words horse and pony indiscriminately.</p>

<h3><a name="1_0_5">Chapter III. The First Trip and Triumph</a></h3>

<p>On March 26, 1860, there appeared simultaneously in the St. Louis
Republic and the New York Herald the following notice:</p>

<p>To San Francisco in 8 days by the Central Overland California and
Pike's Peak Express Company. The first courier of the Pony Express will
leave the Missouri River on Tuesday April 3rd at 5 o'clock P. M. and will
run regularly weekly hereafter, carrying a letter mail only. The point of
departure on the Missouri River will be in telegraphic connection with
the East and will be announced in due time.</p>

<p>Telegraphic messages from all parts of the United States and Canada in
connection with the point of departure will be received up to 5 o'clock
P. M. of the day of leaving and transmitted over the Placerville and St.
Joseph telegraph wire to San Francisco and intermediate points by the
connecting express, in 8 days.</p>

<p>The letter mail will be delivered in San Francisco in ten days from
the departure of the Express. The Express passes through Forts Kearney,
Laramie, Bridger, Great Salt Lake City, Camp Floyd, Carson City, The
Washoe Silver Mines, Placerville, and Sacramento.</p>

<p>Letters for Oregon, Washington Territory, British Columbia, the
Pacific Mexican ports, Russian Possessions, Sandwich Islands, China,
Japan and India will be mailed in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Special messengers, bearers of letters to connect with the express the
3rd of April, will receive communications for the courier of that day at
No. 481 Tenth St., Washington City, up to 2:45 P. M. on Friday, March 30,
and in New York at the office of J. B. Simpson, Room No. 8, Continental
Bank Building, Nassau Street, up to 6:30 A. M. of March 31.</p>

<p>Full particulars can be obtained on application at the above places
and from the agents of the Company.</p>

<p>This sudden announcement of the long desired fast mail route aroused
great enthusiasm in the West and especially in St. Joseph, Missouri, Salt
Lake City, and the cities of California, where preparations to celebrate
the opening of the line were at once begun. Slowly the time passed, until
the afternoon of the eventful day, April 3rd, that was to mark the first
step in annihilating distance between the East and West. A great crowd
had assembled on the streets of St. Joseph, Missouri. Flags were flying
and a brass band added to the jubilation. The Hannibal and St. Joseph
Railroad had arranged to run a special train into the city, bringing the
through mail from connecting points in the East. Everybody was anxious
and excited. At last the shrill whistle of a locomotive was heard, and
the train rumbled in&mdash; on time. The pouches were rushed to the post
office where the express mail was made ready.</p>

<p>The people now surge about the old "Pike's Peak Livery Stables," just
South of Pattee Park. All are hushed with subdued expectancy. As the
moment of departure approaches, the doors swing open and a spirited horse
is led out. Nearby, closely inspecting the animal's equipment is a wiry
little man scarcely twenty years old.</p>

<p>Time to go! Everybody back! A pause of seconds, and a cannon booms in
the distance&mdash;the starting signal. The rider leaps to his saddle and
starts. In less than a minute he is at the post office where the letter
pouch, square in shape with four padlocked pockets, is awaiting him.
Dismounting only long enough for this pouch to be thrown over his saddle,
he again springs to his place and is gone. A short sprint and he has
reached the Missouri River wharf. A ferry boat under a full head of steam
is waiting. With scarcely checked speed, the horse thunders onto the deck
of the craft. A rumbling of machinery, the jangle of a bell, the sharp
toot of a whistle and the boat has swung clear and is headed straight for
the opposite shore. The crowd behind breaks into tumultuous applause.
Some scream themselves hoarse; others are strangely silent; and
some&mdash;strong men&mdash;are moved to tears.</p>

<p>The noise of the cheering multitude grows faint as the Kansas shore
draws near. The engines are reversed; a swish of water, and the, craft
grates against the dock. Scarcely has the gang plank been lowered than
horse and rider dash over it and are off at a furious gallop. Away on the
jet black steed goes Johnnie Frey, the first rider, with the mail that
must be hurled by flesh and blood over 1,966 miles of desolate
space&mdash;across the plains, through North-eastern Kansas and into
Nebraska, up the valley of the Platte, across the Great Plateau, into the
foothills and over the summit of the Rockies, into the arid Great Basin,
over the Wahsatch range, into the valley of Great Salt Lake, through the
terrible alkali deserts of Nevada, through the parched Sink of the Carson
River, over the snowy Sierras, and into the Sacramento Valley&mdash;the
mail must go without delay. Neither storms, fatigue, darkness, rugged
mountains, burning deserts, nor savage Indians were to hinder this pouch
of letters. The mail must go; and its schedule, incredible as it seemed,
must be made. It was a sublime undertaking, than which few have ever put
the fibre of Americans to a severer test.</p>

<p>The managers of the Central Overland, California and Pike's Peak
Express Company had laid their plans well. Horses and riders for fresh
relays, together with station agents and helpers, were ready and waiting
at the appointed places, ten or fifteen miles apart over the entire
course. There was no guess-work or delay.</p>

<p>After crossing the Missouri River, out of St. Joseph, the official
route[2] of the west-bound Pony Express ran at first west and south
through Kansas to Kennekuk; then northwest, across the Kickapoo Indian
reservation, to Granada, Log Chain, Seneca, Ash Point, Guittards,
Marysville, and Hollenberg. Here the valley of the Little Blue River was
followed, still in a northwest direction. The trail crossed into Nebraska
near Rock Creek and pushed on through Big Sandy and Liberty Farm, to
Thirty-two-mile Creek. From thence it passed over the prairie divide to
the Platte River, the valley of which was followed to Fort Kearney. This
route had already been made famous by the Mormons when they journeyed to
Utah in 1847. It had also been followed by many of the California
gold-seekers in 1848-49 and by Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston and his army
when they marched west from Fort Leavenworth to suppress the "Mormon War"
of 1857-58.</p>

<p>For about three hundred miles out of Fort Kearney, the trail followed
the prairies; for two thirds of this distance, it clung to the south bank
of the Platte, passing through Plum Creek and Midway[3]. At Cottonwood
Springs the junction of the North and South branches of the Platte was
reached. From here the course moved steadily westward, through Fremont's
Springs, O'Fallon's Bluffs, Alkali, Beauvais Ranch, and Diamond Springs
to Julesburg, on the South fork of the Platte. Here the stream was forded
and the rider then followed the course of Lodge Pole Creek in a
northwesterly direction to Thirty Mile Ridge. Thence he journeyed to Mud
Springs, Court-House Rock, Chimney Rock, and Scott's Bluffs to Fort
Laramie. From this point he passed through the foot-hills to the base of
the Rockies, then over the mountains through South Pass and to Fort
Bridger. Then to Salt Lake City, Camp Floyd, Ruby Valley, Mountain Wells,
across the Humboldt River in Nevada to Bisbys', Carson City, and to
Placerville, California; thence to Folsom and Sacramento. Here the mail
was taken by a fast steamer down the Sacramento River to San
Francisco.</p>

<p>A large part of this route traversed the wildest regions of the
Continent. Along the entire course there were but four military posts and
they were strung along at intervals of from two hundred and fifty to
three hundred and fifty miles from each other. Over most of the journey
there were only small way stations to break the awful monotony.
Topographically, the trail covered nearly six hundred miles of rolling
prairie, intersected here and there by streams fringed with timber. The
nature of the mountainous regions, the deserts, and alkali plains as
avenues of horseback travel is well understood. Throughout these areas
the men and horses had to endure such risks as rocky chasms, snow slides,
and treacherous streams, as well as storms of sand and snow. The worst
part of the journey lay between Salt Lake City and Sacramento, where for
several hundred miles the route ran through a desert, much of it a bed of
alkali dust where no living creature could long survive. It was not
merely these dangers of dire exposure and privation that threatened, for
wherever the country permitted of human life, Indians abounded. From the
Platte River valley westward, the old route sped over by the Pony Express
is today substantially that of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific
Railroads.</p>

<p>In California, the region most benefited by the express, the opening
of the line was likewise awaited with the keenest anticipation. Of course
there had been at the outset a few dissenting opinions, the gist of the
opposing sentiment being that the Indians would make the operation of the
route impossible. One newspaper went so far as to say that it was "Simply
inviting slaughter upon all the foolhardy young men who had been engaged
as riders". But the California spirit would not down. A vast majority of
the people favored the enterprise and clamored for it; and before the
express had been long in operation, all classes were united in the
conviction that they could not do without it.</p>

<p>At San Francisco and Sacramento, then the two most important towns in
the far West, great preparations were made to celebrate the first
outgoing and incoming mails. On April 3rd, at the same hour the express
started from St. Joseph[4], the eastbound mail was placed on board a
steamer at San Francisco and sent up the river, accompanied by an
enthusiastic delegation of business men. On the arrival of the pouch and
its escort at Sacramento, the capital city, they were greeted with the
blare of bands, the firing of guns, and the clanging of gongs. Flags were
unfurled and floral decorations lined the streets. That night the first
rider for the East, Harry Roff, left the city on a white broncho. He rode
the first twenty miles in fifty-nine minutes, changing mounts once. He
next took a fresh horse at Folsom and pushed on fifty-five miles farther
to Placerville. Here he was relieved by "Boston," who carried the mail to
Friday Station, crossing the Sierras en route. Next came Sam Hamilton who
rode through Geneva, Carson City, Dayton, and Reed's Station to Fort
Churchill, seventy-five miles in all. This point, one hundred and
eighty-five miles out of Sacramento had been reached in fifteen hours and
twenty minutes, in spite of the Sierra Divide where the snow drifts were
thirty feet deep and where the Company had to keep a drove of pack mules
moving in order to keep the passageway clear. From Fort Churchill into
Ruby Valley went H. J. Faust; from Ruby Valley to Shell Creek the courier
was "Josh" Perkins; then came Jim Gentry who carried the mail to Deep
Creek, and he was followed by "Let" Huntington who pushed on to Simpson's
Springs. From Simpson's to Camp Floyd rode John Fisher, and from the
latter place Major Egan carried the mail into Salt Lake City, arriving
April 7, at 11:45 P. M.[5] The obstacles to fast travel had been numerous
because of snow in the mountains, and stormy spring weather with its
attendant discomfort and bad going. Yet the schedule had been maintained,
and the last seventy-five miles into Salt Lake City had been ridden in
five hours and fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>At that time Placerville and Carson City were the terminals of a local
telegraph line. News had been flashed back from Carson on April 4 that
the rider had passed that point safely. After that came an anxious wait
until April 12 when the arrival of the west-bound express announced that
all was well.</p>

<p>The first trip of the Pony Express westbound from St. Joseph to
Sacramento was made in nine days and twenty-three hours. East-bound, the
run was covered in eleven days and twelve hours. The average time of
these two performances was barely half that required by the Butterfield
stage over the Southern route. The pony had clipped ten full days from
the schedule of its predecessor, and shown that it could keep its
schedule&mdash;which was as follows:</p>

<p>From St. Joseph to Salt Lake City&mdash;124 hours.</p>

<p>From Salt Lake City to Carson City&mdash;218 hours, from starting
point.</p>

<p>From Carson City to Sacramento&mdash;232 hours, from starting
point.</p>

<p>From Sacramento to San Francisco&mdash;240 hours, from starting
point.</p>

<p>From the very first trip, expressions of genuine appreciation of the
new service were shown all along the line. The first express which
reached Salt Lake City eastbound on the night of April 7, led the Deseret
News, the leading paper of that town to say that: "Although a telegraph
is very desirable, we feel well-satisfied with this achievement for, the
present." Two days later, the first west-bound express bound from St.
Joseph reached the Mormon capital. Oddly enough this rider carried news
of an act to amend a bill just proposed in the United States Senate,
providing that Utah be organized into Nevada Territory under the name and
leadership of the latter[6]. Many of the Mormons, like numerous persons
in California, had at first believed the Pony Express an impossibility,
but now that it had been demonstrated wholly feasible, they were
delighted with its success, whether it brought them good news or bad; for
it had brought Utah within six days of the Missouri River and within
seven days of Washington City. Prior to this, under the old stage coach
r&eacute;gime, the people of that territory had been accustomed to
receive their news of the world from six weeks to three months old.</p>

<p>Probably no greater demonstrations were ever held in California cities
than when the first incoming express arrived. Its schedule having been
announced in the daily papers a week ahead, the people were ready with
their welcome. At Sacramento, as when the pony mail had first come up
from San Francisco, practically the whole town turned out. Stores were
closed and business everywhere suspended. State officials and other
citizens of prominence addressed great crowds in commemoration of the
wonderful achievement. Patriotic airs were played and sung and no attempt
was made to check the merry-making of the populace. After a hurried stop
to deliver local mail, the pouch was rushed aboard the fast sailing
steamer Antelope, and the trip down the stream begun. Although San
Francisco was not reached until the dead of night, the arrival of the
express mail was the signal for a hilarious reception. Whistles were
blown, bells jangled, and the California Band turned out. The city fire
department, suddenly aroused by the uproar, rushed into the street,
expecting to find a conflagration, but on recalling the true state of
affairs, the firemen joined in with spirit. The express courier was then
formally escorted by a huge procession from the steamship dock to the
office of the Alta Telegraph, the official Western terminal, and the
momentous trip had ended.</p>

<p>The first Pony Express from St. Joseph brought a message of
congratulation from President Buchanan to Governor Downey of California,
which was first telegraphed to the Missouri River town. It also brought
one or two official government communications, some New York, Chicago,
and St. Louis newspapers, a few bank drafts, and some business letters
addressed to banks and commercial houses in San Francisco&mdash;about
eighty-five pieces of mail in all[7]. And it had brought news from the
East only nine days on the road.</p>

<p>At the outset, the Express reduced the time for letters from New York
to the Coast from twenty-three days to about ten days. Before the line
had been placed in operation, a telegraph wire, allusion to which has
been made, had been strung two hundred and fifty miles Eastward from San
Francisco through Sacramento to Carson City, Nevada. Important official
business from Washington was therefore wired to St. Joseph, then
forwarded by pony rider to Carson City where it was again telegraphed to
Sacramento or San Francisco as the case required, thus saving twelve or
fifteen hours in transmission on the last lap of the journey. The usual
schedule for getting dispatches from the Missouri River to the Coast was
eight days, and for letters, ten days.</p>

<p>After the triumphant first trip, when it was fully evident that the
Pony Express[8] was a really established enterprise, the St. Joseph Free
Democrat broke into the following panegyric:</p>

<p>Take down your map and trace the footprints of our quadrupedantic
animal: From St. Joseph on the Missouri to San Francisco, on the Golden
Horn&mdash;two thousand miles&mdash;more than half the distance across
our boundless continent; through Kansas, through Nebraska, by Fort
Kearney, along the Platte, by Fort Laramie, past the Buttes, over the
Rocky Mountains, through the narrow passes and along the steep defiles,
Utah, Fort Bridger, Salt Lake City, he witches Brigham with his swift
ponyship &mdash;through the valleys, along the grassy slopes, into the
snow, into sand, faster than Thor's Thialfi, away they go, rider and
horse&mdash;did you see them? They are in California, leaping over its
golden sands, treading its busy streets. The courser has unrolled to us
the great American panorama, allowed us to glance at the homes of one
million people, and has put a girdle around the earth in forty minutes.
Verily the riding is like the riding of Jehu, the son of Nimshi for he
rideth furiously. Take out your watch. We are eight days from New York,
eighteen from London. The race is to the swift.</p>

<p>The Pony Express had been tried at the tribunal of popular opinion and
given a hearty endorsement. It had yet to win the approval of shrewd
statesmanship.</p>

<p>[2] Root and Connelley's Overland Stage to California.</p>

<p>[3] So called because it was about half way between the Missouri River
and Denver.</p>

<p>[4] Reports as to the precise hour of starting do not all agree. It
was probably late in the afternoon or early in the evening, no later than
6:30.</p>

<p>[5] Authorities differ somewhat as to the personnel of the first trip;
also as to the number of letters carried.</p>

<p>[6] On account of the Mormon outbreak and the troubles of 1857-58,
there was at this time much ill-feeling in Congress against Utah. Matters
were finally smoothed out and the bill in question was of course dropped.
Utah was loyal to the Union throughout the Civil War.</p>

<p>[7] Eastbound the first rider carried about seventy letters.</p>

<p>[8] The idea of a Pony Express was not a new one in 1859. Marco Polo
relates that Genghis Khan, ruler of Chinese Tartary had such a courier
service about one thousand years ago. This ambitious monarch, it is said,
had relay stations twenty-five miles apart, and his riders sometimes
covered three hundred miles in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>About a hundred years back, such a system was in vogue in various
countries of Europe.</p>

<p>Early in the nineteenth century before the telegraph was invented, a
New York newspaper man named David Hale used a Pony Express system to
collect state news. A little later, in 1830, a rival publisher, Richard
Haughton, political editor of the New York Journal of Commerce borrowed
the same idea. He afterward founded the Boston Atlas, and by making
relays of fast horses and taking advantage of the services offered by a
few short lines of railroad then operating in Massachusetts, he was
enabled to print election returns by nine o'clock on the morning after
election.</p>

<p>This idea was improved by James W. Webb, Editor of the New York
Courier and Enquirer, a big daily of that time. In 1832, Webb organized
an express rider line between New York and Washington. This undertaking
gave his paper much valuable prestige.</p>

<p>In 1833, Hale and Hallock of the Journal of Commerce started a rival
line that enabled them to publish Washington news within forty-eight
hours, thus giving their paper a big "scoop" over all competitors. Papers
in Norfolk, Va., two hundred and twenty-nine miles south-east of
Washington actually got the news from the capitol out of the New York
Journal of Commerce received by the ocean route, sooner than news printed
in Washington could be sent to Norfolk by boat directly down the Potomac
River.</p>

<p>The California Pony Express of historic fame was imitated on a small
scale in 1861 by the Rocky Mountain News of Denver, then, as now, one of
the great newspapers of the West. At that time, this enterprising daily
owned and published a paper called the Miner's Record at Tarryall, a
mining community some distance out of Denver. The News also had a branch
office at Central City, forty-five miles up in the mountains. As soon as
information from the War arrived over the California Pony Express and by
stage out of old Julesburg from the Missouri River&mdash;Denver was not
on the Pony Express route&mdash;it was hurried to these outlying points
by fast horsemen. Thanks to this enterprise, the miners in the heart of
the Rockies could get their War news only four days late.&mdash;Root and
Connelley.</p>

<h3><a name="1_0_6">Chapter IV. Operation, Equipment, and
Business</a></h3>

<p>On entering the service of the Central Overland California and Pike's
Peak Express Company, employees of the Pony Express were compelled to
take an oath of fidelity which ran as follows:</p>

<p>"I,&mdash;-, do hereby swear, before the Great and Living God, that
during my engagement, and while I am an employe of Russell, Majors
Waddell, I will, under no circumstances, use profane language; that I
will drink no intoxicating liquors; that I will not quarrel or fight with
any other employe of the firm, and that in every respect I will conduct
myself honestly, be faithful to my duties, and so direct all my acts as
to win the confidence of my employers. So help me God."[9]</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that all, nor any considerable number of the
Pony Express men were saintly, nor that they all took their pledge too
seriously. Judged by present-day standards, most of these fellows were
rough and unconventional; some of them were bad. Yet one thing is
certain: in loyalty and blind devotion to duty, no group of employees
will ever surpass the men who conducted the Pony Express. During the
sixteen months of its existence, the riders of this wonderful enterprise,
nobly assisted by the faithful station-keepers, travelled six hundred and
fifty thousand miles, contending against the most desperate odds that a
lonely wilderness and savage nature could offer, with the loss of only a
single mail. And that mail happened to be of relatively small importance.
Only one rider was ever killed outright while on duty. A few were
mortally wounded, and occasionally their horses were disabled. Yet with
the one exception, they stuck grimly to the saddle or trudged manfully
ahead without a horse until the next station was reached. With these men,
keeping the schedule came to be a sort of religion, a performance that
must be accomplished&mdash;even though it forced them to play a desperate
game the stakes of which were life and death. Many station men and
numbers of riders while off duty were murdered by Indians. They were
martyrs to the cause of patriotism and a newer and better civilization.
Yet they were hirelings, working for good wages and performing their
duties in a simple, matter-of-fact way. Their heroism was never a
self-conscious trait.</p>

<p>The riders were young men, seldom exceeding one hundred and
twenty-five pounds in weight. Youthfulness, nerve, a wide experience on
the frontier and general adaptability were the chief requisites for the
Pony Express business. Some of the greatest frontiersmen of the latter
'sixties and the 'seventies were trained in this service, either as pony
riders or station men. The latter had even a more dangerous task, since
in their isolated shacks they were often completely at the mercy of
Indians.</p>

<p>That only one rider was ever taken by the savages was due to the fact
that the pony men rode magnificent horses which invariably outclassed the
Indian ponies in speed and endurance. The lone man captured while on duty
was completely surrounded by a large number of savages on the Platte
River in Nebraska. He was shot dead and though his body was not found for
several days, his pony, bridled and saddled, escaped safely with the mail
which was duly forwarded to its destination. That far more riders were
killed or injured while off duty than when in the saddle was due solely
to the wise precaution of the Company in selecting such high-grade riding
stock. And it took the best of horseflesh to make the schedule.</p>

<p>The riders dressed as they saw fit. The average costume consisted of a
buckskin shirt, ordinary trousers tucked into high leather boots, and a
slouch hat or cap. They always went armed. At first a Spencer carbine was
carried strapped to the rider's back, besides a sheath knife at his side.
In the saddle holsters he carried a pair of Colt's revolvers. After a
time the carbines were left off and only side arms taken along. The
carrying of larger guns meant extra weight, and it was made a rule of the
Company that a rider should never fight unless compelled to do so. He was
to depend wholly upon speed for safety. The record of the service fully
justified this policy.</p>

<p>While the horses were of the highest grade, they were of mixed breed
and were purchased over a wide range of territory. Good results were
obtained from blooded animals from the Missouri Valley, but considerable
preference was shown for the western-bred mustangs. These animals were
about fourteen hands high and averaged less than nine hundred pounds in
weight. A former blacksmith for the Company who was at one time located
at Seneca, Kansas, recalls that one of these native ponies often had to
be thrown and staked down with a rope tied to each foot before it could
be shod. Then, before the smith could pare the hoofs and nail on the
shoes, it was necessary for one man to sit astride the animal's head, and
another on its body, while the beast continued to struggle and squeal. To
shoe one of these animals often required a half day of strenuous
work.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the horse as well as rider traveled very light.
The combined weight of the saddle, bridle and saddle bags did not exceed
thirteen pounds. The saddle-bag used by the pony rider for carrying mail
was called a mochila; it had openings in the center so it would fit
snugly over the horn and tree of the saddle and yet be removable without
delay. The mochila had four pockets called cantinas in each of its
corners one in front and one behind each of the rider's legs. These
cantinas held the mail. All were kept carefully locked and three were
opened en route only at military posts&mdash;Forts Kearney, Laramie,
Bridger, Churchill and at Salt Lake City. The fourth pocket was for the
local or way mail-stations. Each local station-keeper had a key and could
open it when necessary. It held a time-card on which a record of the
arrival and departure at the various stations where it was opened, was
kept. Only one mochila was used on a trip; it was transferred by the
rider from one horse to another until the destination was reached.</p>

<p>Letters were wrapped in oil silk to protect them from moisture, either
from stormy weather, fording streams, or perspiring animals. While a mail
of twenty pounds might be carried, the average weight did not exceed
fifteen pounds. The postal charges were at first, five dollars for each
half-ounce letter, but this rate was afterward reduced by the Post Office
Department to one dollar for each half ounce. At this figure it remained
as long as the line was in business. In addition to this rate, a
regulation government envelope costing ten cents, had to be purchased.
Patrons generally made use of a specially light tissue paper for their
correspondence. The large newspapers of New York, Boston, Chicago, St.
Louis, and San Francisco were among the best customers of the service.
Some of the Eastern dailies even kept special correspondents at St.
Joseph to receive and telegraph to the home office news from the West as
soon as it arrived. On account of the enormous postage rates these
newspapers would print special editions of Civil War news on the thinnest
of paper to avoid all possible mailing bulk.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank A. Root of Topeka, Kansas, who was Assistant Postmaster and
Chief Clerk in the post office at Atchison during the last two months of
the line's existence, in 1861, says that during that period the Express,
which was running semi-weekly, brought about three hundred and fifty
letters each trip from California[10]. Many of these communications were
from government and state officials in California and Oregon, and
addressed to the Federal authorities at Washington, particularly to
Senators and Representatives from these states and to authorities of the
War Department. A few were addressed to Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States. A large number of these letters were from business and
professional men in Portland, San Francisco, Oakland, and Sacramento, and
mailed to firms in the large cities of the East and Middle West. Not to
mention the rendering of invaluable help to the Government in retaining
California at the beginning of the War, the Pony Express was of the
greatest importance to the commercial interests of the West.</p>

<p>The line was frequently used by the British Government in forwarding
its Asiatic correspondence to London. In 1860, a report of the activities
of the English fleet off the coast of China was sent through from San
Francisco eastward over this route. For the transmission of these
dispatches that Government paid one hundred and thirty-five dollars Pony
Express charges.</p>

<p>Nor did the commercial houses of the Pacific Coast cities appear to
mind a little expense in forwarding their business letters. Mr. Root says
there would often be twenty-five one dollar "Pony" stamps and the same
number of Government stamps&mdash;a total in postage of twenty-seven
dollars and fifty cents&mdash;on a single envelope. Not much frivolity
passed through these mails.</p>

<p>Pony Express riders received an average salary of from one hundred
dollars to one hundred and twenty-five dollars a month. A few whose rides
were particularly dangerous or who had braved unusual dangers received
one hundred and fifty dollars. Station men and their assistants were paid
from fifty to one hundred dollars monthly.</p>

<p>Of the eighty riders usually in the service, half were always riding
in either direction, East and West. The average "run" was seventy-five
miles, the men going and coming over their respective divisions on each
succeeding day. Yet there were many exceptions to this rule, as will be
shown later. At the outset, although facilities for shorter relays had
been provided, it was planned to run each horse twenty-five miles with an
average of three horses to the rider; but it was soon found that a horse
could rarely continue at a maximum speed for so great a distance.
Consequently, it soon became the practice to change mounts every ten or
twelve miles or as nearly that as possible. The exact distance was
governed largely by the nature of the country. While this shortening of
the relay necessitated transferring the mochila many more times on each
trip, it greatly facilitated the schedule; for it was at once seen that
the average horse or pony in the Express service could be crowded to the
limit of its speed over the reduced distance.</p>

<p>One of the station-keeper's most important duties was to have a fresh
horse saddled and bridled a half hour before the Express was due. Only
two minutes time was allowed for changing mounts. The rider's approach
was watched for with keen anxiety. By daylight he could generally be seen
in a cloud of dust, if in the desert or prairie regions. If in the
mountains, the clear air made it possible for the station men to detect
his approach a long way off, provided there were no obstructions to hide
the view. At night the rider would make his presence known by a few lusty
whoops. Dashing up to the station, no time was wasted. The courier would
already have loosed his mochila, which he tossed ahead for the keeper to
adjust on the fresh horse, before dismounting. A sudden reining up of his
foam-covered steed, and "All's well along the road, Hank!" to the station
boss, and he was again mounted and gone, usually fifteen seconds after
his arrival. Nor was there any longer delay when a fresh rider took up
the "run."</p>

<p>Situated at intervals of about two hundred miles were division
points[11] in charge of locally important agents or superintendents. Here
were kept extra men, animals, and supplies as a precaution against the
raids of Indians, desperadoes, or any emergency likely to arise. Division
agents had considerable authority; their pay was as good as that received
by the best riders. They were men of a heroic and even in some instances,
desperate character, in spite of their oath of service. In certain
localities much infested with horse thievery and violence it was
necessary to have in charge men of the fight-the-devil-with-fire type in
order to keep the business in operation. Noted among this class of
Division agents, with headquarters at the Platte Crossing near Fort
Kearney, was Jack Slade[12], who, though a good servant of the Company,
turned out to be one of the worst "bad" men in the history of the West.
He had a record of twenty-six "killings" to his credit, but he kept his
Division thoroughly purged of horse thieves and savage marauders, for he
knew how to "get" his man whenever there was trouble.</p>

<p>The schedule was at first fixed at ten days for eight months of the
year and twelve days during the winter season, but this was soon lowered
to eight and ten days respectively. An average speed of ten miles an hour
including stops had to be maintained on the summer schedule. In the
winter the run was sustained at eight miles an hour; deep snows made the
latter performance the more difficult of the two.</p>

<p>The best record made by the Pony Express was in getting President
Lincoln's inaugural speech across the continent in March, 1861. This
address, outlining as it did the attitude of the new Chief Executive
toward the pending conflict, was anticipated with the deepest anxiety by
the people on the Pacific Coast. Evidently inspired by the urgency of the
situation, the Company determined to surpass all performances. Horses
were led out, in many cases, two or three miles from the stations, in
order to meet the incoming riders and to secure the supreme limit of
speed and endurance on this momentous trip. The document was carried
through from St. Joseph to Sacramento&mdash;1966 miles&mdash;in just
seven days and seventeen hours, an average speed of ten and six-tenths
miles an hour. And this by flesh and blood, pounding the dirt over the
plains, mountains, and deserts! The best individual performance on this
great run was by "Pony Bob" Haslam who galloped the one hundred and
twenty miles from Smith's Creek to Fort Churchill in eight hours and ten
minutes, an average of fourteen and seven-tenths miles per hour. On this
record-breaking trip the message was carried the six hundred and
seventy-five miles between St. Joseph and Denver[13] in sixty-nine hours;
the last ten miles of this leg of the journey being ridden in thirty-one
minutes. Today, but few overland express trains, hauled by giant
locomotives over heavy steel rails on a rock-ballasted roadbed average
more than thirty miles per hour between the Missouri and the Pacific
Coast.</p>

<p>The news of the election of Lincoln in November 1860, and President
Buchanan's last message a month later were carried through in eight
days.</p>

<p>Late in the winter and early in the spring of 1861, just prior to the
beginning of the war, many good records were made with urgent Government
dispatches. News of the firing upon Fort Sumter was taken through in
eight days and fourteen hours. From then on, while the Pony Express
service continued, the business men and public officials of California
began giving prize money to the Company, to be awarded those riders who
made the best time carrying war news. On one occasion they raised a purse
of three hundred dollars for the star rider when a pouch containing a
number of Chicago papers full of information from the South arrived at
Sacramento a day ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>That these splendid achievements could never have been attained
without a wonderful degree of enthusiasm and loyalty on the part of the
men, scarcely needs asserting. The pony riders were highly respected by
the stage and freight employees&mdash;in fact by all respectable men
throughout the West. Nor were they honored merely for what they did; they
were the sort of men who command respect. To assist a rider in any way
was deemed a high honor; to do aught to retard him was the limit of
wrong-doing, a woeful offense. On the first trip west-bound, the rider
between Folsom and Sacramento was thrown, receiving a broken leg. Shortly
after the accident, a Wells Fargo stage happened along, and a special
agent of that Company, who chanced to be a passenger, seeing the
predicament, volunteered to finish the run. This he did successfully,
reaching Sacramento only ninety minutes late. Such instances are typical
of the manly cooperation that made the Pony Express the true success that
it was.</p>

<p>Mark Twain, who made a trip across the continent in 1860 has left this
glowing account[14] of a pony and rider that he saw while traveling
overland in a stage coach:</p>

<p>We had a consuming desire from the beginning, to see a pony rider; but
somehow or other all that passed us, and all that met us managed to
streak by in the night and so we heard only a whiz and a hail, and the
swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out of
the windows. But now we were expecting one along every moment, and would
see him in broad daylight. Presently the driver exclaims:</p>

<p>"Here he comes!"</p>

<p>Every neck is stretched further and every eye strained wider away
across the endless dead level of the prairie, a black speck appears
against the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well I should think so!
In a second it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling, rising and
falling&mdash; sweeping toward us nearer and nearer growing more and more
distinct, more and more sharply defined&mdash;nearer and still nearer,
and the flutter of hoofs comes faintly to the ear&mdash;another instant a
whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider's hands but
no reply and man and horse burst past our excited faces and go winging
away like the belated fragment of a storm!</p>

<p>So sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that but for
a flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mail sack after
the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we might have doubted whether
we had seen any actual horse and man at all, maybe.</p>

<p>[9] This was the same pledge which the original firm had required of
its men. Both Russell, Majors, and Waddell, and the C. O. C. and P. P.
Exp. Co., which they incorporated, adhered to a rigid observance of the
Sabbath. They insisted on their men doing as little work as possible on
that day, and had them desist from work whenever possible. And they stuck
faithfully to these policies. Probably no concern ever won a higher and
more deserved reputation for integrity in the fulfillment of its
contracts and for business reliability than Russell, Majors, and
Waddell.</p>

<p>[10] Exact figures are not obtainable for the west bound mail but it
was probably not so heavy.</p>

<p>At this time&mdash;Sept., 1861&mdash;the telegraph had been extended
from the Missouri to Fort Kearney, Nebraska, and letter pouches from the
Pony Express were sent by overland stage from Kearney to Atchison.
Messages of grave concern were wired as soon as this station was
reached.</p>

<p>[11] These were executive divisions and not to be confused with the
riders' divisions. The latter were merely the stations separating each
man's "run."</p>

<p>[12] Slade was afterward hanged by vigilantes in Virginia City,
Montana. The authentic story of his life surpasses in romance and tragedy
most of the pirate tales of fiction.</p>

<p>[13] The dispatch was taken from the main line to the Colorado capital
by special service. Denver, it will be remembered, was not on the regular
"Pony route," which ran north of that city. There was then no telegraph
in operation west of the Missouri River in Kansas or Nebraska.</p>

<p>[14] Roughing It.</p>

<h3><a name="1_0_7">Chapter V. California and the Secession
Menace</a></h3>

<p>When the Southern states withdrew, a conspiracy was on foot to force
California out of the Union, and organize a new Republic of the Pacific
with the Sierra Madre and the Rocky Mountains for its Eastern boundary.
This proposed commonwealth, when once erected, and when it had subjugated
all Union men in the West who dared oppose it, would eventually unite
with the Confederacy; and in event of the latter's success&mdash;which at
the opening of the war to many seemed certain&mdash;the territory of the
Confederate States of America would embrace the entire Southwest, and
stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Aside from its general plans,
the exact details of this plot are of course impossible to secure. But
that the conspiracy existed has never been disproved.</p>

<p>That the rebel sympathizers in California were plotting, as soon as
the War began, to take the Presidio at the entrance to the Golden Gate,
together with the forts on Alcatraz Island, the Custom House, the Mint,
the Post Office, and all United States property, and then having made the
formation of their Republic certain, invade the Mexican State of Sonora
and annex it to the new commonwealth, has never been gainsaid. That these
conspiracies existed and were held in grave seriousness is revealed by
the official correspondence of that time. That they had been fomenting
for many months is apparently revealed by this additional fact: during
Buchanan's administration, John B. Floyd, a southern man who gave up his
position to fight for the Confederacy, was Secretary of War. When the
Rebellion started, it was found[15] that Floyd, while in office, had
removed 135,430 firearms, together with much ammunition and heavy
ordnance, from the big Government arsenal at Springfield, Massachusetts,
and distributed them at various points in the South and Southwest. Of
this number, fifty thousand[16] were sent to California where twenty-five
thousand muskets had already been stored. And all this was done
underhandedly, without the knowledge of Congress.</p>

<p>California was unfortunate in having as a representative in the United
States Senate at this time, William Gwin, also a man of southern birth
who had cast his fortunes in the Golden State at the outset, when the
gold boom was on. Until secession was imminent, Gwin served his adopted
state well enough. His encouragement of the Pony Express enterprise has
already been pointed out. It is doubtful if he were statesman enough to
have foreseen the significant part this organization was to play in the
early stages of the War. Otherwise his efforts in its behalf must have
been lacking&mdash;though the careers of political adventurers like Gwin
are full of strange inconsistencies[17].</p>

<p>Speaking in the Senate, on December 12, 1859, Gwin declared, that he
believed that "all slave holding states of this confederacy can establish
a separate and independent government that will be impregnable to the
assaults of all foreign enemies." He further went on to show that they
had the power to do it, and asserted that if the southern states went out
of the Union, "California would be with the South." Then, as a convincing
proof of his duplicity, he had these pro-rebel statements stricken from
the official report of his speech, that his constituents might not take
fright, and perhaps spoil some of the designs which he and his scheming
colleagues had upon California. Of course these remarks reached the ears
of his constituents anyhow, and though prefaced by a studied evasiveness
on his part, they contributed much to the feeling of unrest and
insecurity that then prevailed along the Coast.</p>

<p>It is of course a well-known fact that California never did secede,
and that soon after the war began, she swung definitely and conclusively
into the Union column. The danger of secession was wholly potential. Yet
potential dangers are none the less real. Had it not been for the
determined energies of a few loyalists in California, led by General E.
A. Sumner and cooperating with the Federal Government by means of the
swiftest communication then possible&mdash;the Pony Express&mdash;
history today, might read differently.</p>

<p>Now to turn once more to the potential dangers[18] that made the
California crisis a reality. About three-eighths of the population were
of southern descent and solidly united in sympathy for the Confederate
states. This vigorous minority included upwards of sixteen thousand
Knights of the Golden Circle, a pro-Confederate secret organization that
was active and dangerous in all the doubtful states in winning over to
the southern cause those who feebly protested loyalty to the Union but
who opposed war. Many of these "knights" were prosperous and substantial
citizens who, working under the guise of their local respectability,
exerted a profound influence. Here then, at the outset, was a vigorous
and not a small minority, whose influence was greatly out of proportion
to their numbers because of their zeal; and who would have seized the
balance of power unless held in check by an aroused Union sentiment and
military intimidation.</p>

<p>Another class of men to be feared was a small but powerful group
representing much wealth, a financial class which proverbially shuns war
because of the expense which war involves; a class that always insists
upon peace, even at the cost of compromised honor. These men, with the
influence which their money commanded, would inevitably espouse the side
that seemed the most likely of speedy success; and in view of the early
successes of the Confederate armies and the zealous proselytizing of
rebel sympathizers in their midst they were a potential risk to loyal
California.</p>

<p>The native Spanish or Mexican classes then numerically strong in that
state, were appealed to by the anti-Unionists from various cunning
approaches, chief of which was the theory that the many real estate
troubles and complicated land titles by which they had been annoyed since
the separation from Old Mexico in 1847, would be promptly adjusted under
Confederate authority. While nearly all these natives were ignorant, many
held considerable property and they in turn influenced their poorer
brethren. Chimerical as this argument may sound, it had much weight.</p>

<p>Another group of persons also large potentially and a serious menace
when proselyted by the apostles of rebellion, were the squatters and
trespassers who were occupying land to which they had no lawful right.
Many of these men were reckless; some had already been entangled in the
courts because of their false land claims. Hence their attitude toward
the existing Government was ugly and defiant. Yet they were now assured
that they might remain on their lands forever undisturbed, under a rebel
r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>Added to all these sources of danger was the attitude of the thousands
of well-meaning people&mdash;who, regardless of rebel solicitation, were
at first indifferent. They thought that the great distance which
separated them from the seat of war made it a matter of but little
importance whether California aroused herself or not. They were of course
counseling neutrality as the easiest way of avoiding trouble.</p>

<p>Turning now to the forces, moral, military, and political, that were
working to save California&mdash;first there was a loyal newspaper press,
which saw and followed its duty with unflinching devotion. It firmly held
before the people the loyal responsibility of the state and declared that
the ties of union were too sacred to be broken. It was the moral duty of
the people to remain loyal. It truthfully asserted that California's
influence in the Federal Union should be an example for other states to
follow. If the idea of a Pacific Republic were repudiated by their own
citizens, such action would discourage secession elsewhere and be a great
moral handicap to that movement. And the press further pointed out with
convincing clearness, that should the Union be dissolved, the project for
a Pacific Railroad[19] with which the future of the Commonwealth was
inevitably committed, would likely fail.</p>

<p>Aroused by the moral importance of its position, the state
legislature, early in the winter of 1860-1861, had passed a resolution of
fidelity to the Union, in which it declared "That California is ready to
maintain the rights and honor of the National Government at home and
abroad, and at all times to respond to any requisitions that may be made
upon her to defend the Republic against foreign or domestic foes."
Succeeding events proved the genuineness of this resolve.</p>

<p>In the early spring of 1861, the War Department sent General Edwin A.
Sumner to take command of the Military Department of the Pacific with
headquarters at San Francisco, supplanting General Albert Sidney Johnston
who resigned to fight for the South. This was a most fortunate
appointment, as Sumner proved a resourceful and capable official, ideally
suited to meet the crisis before him. Nor does this reflect in any way
upon the superb soldierly qualities of his predecessor. Johnston was no
doubt too manly an officer to take part in the romantic conspiracies
about him. He was every inch a brave soldier who did his fighting in the
open. Like Robert E. Lee, he joined the Confederacy in conscientious good
faith, and he met death bravely at Shiloh in April, 1862.</p>

<p>Sumner was a man of action and he faced the situation squarely. To
him, California and the nation will always be indebted. One of his first
decisive acts was to check the secession movement in Southern California
by placing a strong detachment of soldiers at Los Angeles. This force
proved enough to stop any incipient uprisings in that part of the state.
Some of the disturbing element in this district then moved over into
Nevada where cooperation was made with the pro-Confederate men there. The
Nevada rebel faction had made considerable headway by assuring
unsuspecting persons that it was acting on the authority of the
Confederate Government. On June 5, 1861, the rebel flag was unfurled at
Virginia City. Again Sumner acted. He immediately sent a Federal force to
garrison Fort Churchill, and a body of men under Major Blake and Captain
Moore seized all arms found in the possession of suspected persons. A
rebel militia company with four hundred men enrolled and one hundred
under arms was found and dispersed by the Federals. This decisive action
completely stopped any uprisings across the state line, uprisings which
might easily have spread into California.</p>

<p>In the meantime, under General Sumner's direction, soldiers had been
enlisted and were being rapidly drilled for any emergency. The War
Department, on being advised of this available force, at once sent the
following dispatch, which, with those that follow are typical of the
correspondence which the Pony Express couriers were now rushing across
the Continent toward and from Washington.</p>

<p>Telegraph and Pony Express. Adjutant-General's Office.</p>

<p>Washington, July 24, 1861. Brigadier General Sumner, Commanding
Department of the Pacific.</p>

<p>One regiment of infantry and five companies of cavalry have been
accepted from California to aid in protecting the overland mail route via
Salt Lake.</p>

<p>Please detail officers to muster these troops into service. Blanks
will be sent by steamer.</p>

<p>By order: George D. Ruggles. Assistant Adjutant General.</p>

<p>While recognizing the great need of extending proper military
protection to the mail route, it must have been disheartening to Sumner
and the loyalists to see this force ordered into service outside the
state. For now, late in the summer of 1861, the time of national
crisis&mdash;the Californian trouble was approaching its climax. On July
20, the Union army had been beaten at Bull Run and driven back, a rabble
of fugitives, into the panic stricken capital. Then came weeks and months
of delay and uncertainty while the overcautious McClellan sought to build
up a new military machine. The entire North was overspread with gloom;
the Confederates were jubilant and full of self-confidence. In California
the psychological situation was similar but even more acute, for
encouraged by Confederate success, the rebel faction became bolder than
ever, and openly planned to win the state election to be held on
September 4. If successful at the polls, the reins of organized political
power would pass into its hands and a secession convention would be a
direct possibility. And to intensify the danger was the confirmed
indifference or stubbornness of many citizens who seemed to place petty
personal differences before the interests of the state and nation at
large.</p>

<p>As is well known, Lincoln and the Federal Government accepted the
defeat at Bull Run calmly, and set about with grim determination to whip
the South at any cost. The President asked Congress for four hundred
thousand men and was voted five hundred thousand. In pursuance of such
policies, these urgent dispatches were hurried across the country:</p>

<p>War Department. Washington, August 14, 1861. Hon. John G. Downey,</p>

<p>Governor of California, Sacramento City, Cal.</p>

<p>Please organize, equip, and have mustered into service, at the
earliest date possible, four regiments of infantry and one regiment of
cavalry, to be placed at the disposal of General Sumner.</p>

<p>Simon Cameron, Secretary of War.</p>

<p>By telegraph to Fort Kearney and thence by Pony Express and
telegraph.</p>

<p>War Department, August 15, 1861. Hon. John G. Downey,</p>

<p>Governor of California, Sacramento City, Cal.</p>

<p>In filling the requisition given you August 14th, for five regiments,
please make General J. H. Carleton of San Francisco, colonel of a cavalry
regiment, and give him proper authority to organize as promptly as
possible.</p>

<p>Simon Cameron, Secretary of War.</p>

<p>Telegraph and Pony Express and telegraph.</p>

<p>The work of enlisting the five thousand men thus requisitioned was
carried forward with great rapidity. Within two weeks, on the 28th, the
Pony Express brought word that the War Department was about to order this
force overland into Texas, to act, no doubt, as a barrier to the
advancing Confederate armies who were then planning an invasion of New
Mexico as the first decisive step in carrying the conflict into the heart
of the Southwest. It was understood, further, that General Sumner would
be ordered to vacate his position as Commander of the Department of the
Pacific and lead his recruits into the service.</p>

<p>To the authorities at Washington, a campaign of aggression with
western troops had no doubt seemed the best means of defending California
and adjacent territory from Confederate attack. To the Unionists of
California, the report that their troops and Sumner were to leave the
state spelt extreme discouragement. They had felt some degree of hope and
security so long as organized forces were in their midst, and the
presence of Sumner everywhere inspired confidence among discouraged
patriots. To be deprived of their soldiers was bad enough; to lose Sumner
was intolerable. Accordingly, a formal petition protesting against this
action, was drawn up, addressed to the War Department, and signed by
important firms and prominent business men of San Francisco[20].</p>

<p>In this petition they said among other things, that the War Department
probably was not aware of the real state of affairs in California, and
they openly requested that the order, be rescinded. They declared that a
majority of the California State officers were out-and-out secessionists
and that the others were at least hostile to the administration and would
accept a peace policy at any sacrifice. They were suspicious of the
Governor's loyalty and declared that, "Every appointment made by our
Governor within the last three months, unmistakably indicates his entire
sympathy and cooperation with those plotting to sever California from her
allegiance to the Union, and that, too, at the hazard of Civil
War."[21]</p>

<p>Continuing at detailed length, the petitioners spoke of the great
effort being put forth by the secession element to win the forthcoming
election. Whereas their opponents were united, the Union party was
divided into a Douglas and a Republican faction. Should the
anti-Unionists triumph, they declared there were reasons to expect not
merely the loss of California to the Union ranks but internecine strife
and fratricidal murders such as were then ravaging the Missouri and
Kansas border.</p>

<p>The petition then pointed out the truly great importance of California
to the Union, and asserted that no precaution leading to the preservation
of her loyalty should be overlooked. It was a thousand times easier to
retain a state in allegiance than to overcome disloyalty disguised as
state authority. The best way to check treasonable activities was to
convince traitors of their helplessness. The petitioners further declared
that to deprive California of needed United States military support just
then, would be a direct encouragement to traitors. An ounce of precaution
was worth a pound of cure.</p>

<p>The loyalists triumphed in the state election on September 4, 1861,
and on that date the California crisis was safely passed. The contest, to
be sure, had revealed about twenty thousand anti-Union voters in the
state, but the success of the Union faction restored their feeling of
self-confidence. The pendulum had at last swung safely in the right
direction, and henceforth California could be and was reckoned as a loyal
asset to the Union. Such expressions of disloyalty as her secessionists
continued to disclose, were of a sporadic and flimsy nature, never
materializing into a formidable sentiment; and, adding to their
discouragement, the failure of the Confederate invasion of New Mexico in
1862, was no doubt an important factor in suppressing any further open
desires for secession.</p>

<p>Sumner was not called East until the October following the election.
His removal of course caused keen regret along the coast; but Colonel
George Wright, his successor in charge of the Department of the Pacific,
proved a masterful man and in every way equal to the situation. In the
long run, Colonel Wright probably was as satisfactory to the loyal people
of California as General Sumner had been. The five thousand troops were
not detailed for duty in the South. Like the first detachment of fifteen
hundred, their efforts were directed mainly to protecting the overland
mails and guarding the frontier[22].</p>

<p>Throughout this crisis, news was received twice a week by the Pony
Express, and, be it remembered, in less than half the time required by
the old stage coach. Of its services then, no better words can be used
than those of Hubert Howe Bancroft.</p>

<p>It was the pony to which every one looked for deliverance; men prayed
for the safety of the little beast, and trembled lest the service should
be discontinued. Telegraphic dispatches from Washington and New York were
sent to St. Louis and thence to Fort Kearney, whence the pony brought
them to Sacramento where they were telegraphed to San Francisco.</p>

<p>Great was the relief of the people when Hole's bill for a daily mail
service was passed and the service changed from the Southern to the
Central route, as it was early in the summer. * * * Yet after all, it was
to the flying pony that all eyes and hearts were turned.</p>

<p>The Pony Express was a real factor in the preservation of California
to the Union.</p>

<p>[15] Bancroft.</p>

<p>[16] lbid.</p>

<p>[17] After the War had started, Gwin deserted California and the Union
and joined the Confederacy. When this power was broken up, he fled to
Mexico and entered the service of Maximilian, then puppet emperor of that
unfortunate country. Maximilian bestowed an abundance of hollow honors
upon the renegade senator, and made him Duke of the Province of Sonora,
which region Gwin and his clique had doubtless coveted as an integral
part of their projected "Republic of the Pacific." Because of this empty
title, the nickname, "Duke," was ever afterward given him. When
Maximilian's soap bubble monarchy had disappeared, Gwin finally returned
to California where he passed his old age in retirement.</p>

<p>[21] In the writer's judgment, these charges against Governor Downey
were prejudicial and unjust.</p>

<p>[22] During the War of the Rebellion, California raised 16,231 troops,
more than the whole United States army had been at the commencement of
hostilities. Practically all these soldiers were assigned to routine and
patrol duty in the far West, such as keeping down Indian revolts, and
garrisoning forts, as a defense against any uprising of Indians, or
protection against Confederate invasion. The exceptions were the
California Hundred, and the California Four Hundred, volunteer
detachments who went East of their own accord and won undying honors in
the thick of the struggle.</p>

<h3><a name="1_0_8">Chapter VI. Riders and Famous Rides</a></h3>

<p>Bart Riles, the pony rider, died this morning from wounds received at
Cold Springs, May 16.</p>

<p>The men at Dry Creek Station have all been killed and it is thought
those at Robert's Creek have met with the same fate.</p>

<p>Six Pike's Peakers found the body of the station keeper horribly
mutilated, the station burned, and all the stock missing from
Simpson's.</p>

<p>Eight horses were stolen from Smith's Creek on last Monday, supposedly
by road agents.</p>

<p>The above are random extracts from frontier newspapers, printed while
the Pony Express was running. The Express could never have existed on its
high plane of efficiency, without an abundance of coolheaded, hardened
men; men who knew not fear and who were expert&mdash; though sometimes in
vain&mdash;in all the wonderful arts of self-preservation practiced on
the old frontier. That these employees could have performed even the
simplest of their duties, without stirring and almost incredible
adventures, it is needless to assert.</p>

<p>The faithful relation of even a considerable number of the thrilling
experiences to which the "Pony" men were subjected would discount
fiction. Yet few of these adventures have been recorded. Today, after a
lapse of over fifty years, nearly all of the heroes who achieved them
have gone out on that last long journey from which no man returns. While
history can pay the tribute of preserving some anecdotes of them and
their collective achievements, it must be forever silent as to many of
their personal acts of heroism.</p>

<p>While lasting praise is due the faithful station men who, in their
isolation, so often bore the murderous attacks of Indians and bandits, it
is, perhaps, to the riders that the seeker of romance is most likely to
turn. It was the riders' skill and fortitude that made the operation of
the line possible. Both riders and hostlers shared the same privations,
often being reduced to the necessity of eating wolf meat and drinking
foul or brackish water.</p>

<p>While each rider was supposed to average seventy-five miles a trip,
riding from three to seven horses, accidents were likely to occur, and it
was not uncommon for a man to lose his way. Such delays meant serious
trouble in keeping the schedule, keyed up, as it was, to the highest
possible speed. It was confronting such emergencies, and in performing
the duties of comrades who had been killed or disabled while awaiting
their turns to ride, that the most exciting episodes took place.</p>

<p>Among the more famous riders[23] was Jim Moore who later became a
ranchman in the South Platte Valley, Nebraska. Moore made his greatest
ride on June 8, 1860. He happened to be at Midway Station, half way
between the Missouri River and Denver, when the west-bound messenger
arrived with important Government dispatches to California. Moore "took
up the run," riding continuously one hundred and forty miles to old
Julesburg, the end of his division. Here he met the eastbound messenger,
also with important missives, from the Coast to Washington. By all the
rules of the game Moore should have rested a few hours at this point, but
his successor, who would have picked up the pouch and started eastward,
had been killed the day before. The mail must go, and the schedule must
be sustained. Without asking any favors of the man who had just arrived
from the West, Moore resumed the saddle, after a delay of only ten
minutes, without even stopping to eat, and was soon pounding eastward on
his return trip. He made it, too, in spite of lurking Indians, hunger and
fatigue, covering the round trip of two hundred and eighty miles in
fourteen hours and forty-six minutes an average speed of over eighteen
miles an hour. Furthermore, his west-bound mail had gone through from St.
Joseph to Sacramento on a record-making run of eight days and nine
hours.</p>

<p>William James, always called "Bill" James, was a native of Virginia.
He had crossed the plains with his parents in a wagon train when only
five years old. At eighteen, he was one of the best Pony Express riders
in the service. James's route lay between Simpson's Park and Cole
Springs, Nevada, in the Smoky Valley range of mountains. He rode only
sixty miles each way but covered his round trip of one hundred and twenty
miles in twelve hours, including all stops. He always rode California
mustangs, using five of these animals each way. His route crossed the
summits of two mountain ridges, lay through the Shoshone Indian country,
and was one of the loneliest and most dangerous divisions on the line.
Yet "Bill" never took time to think about danger, nor did he ever have
any serious trouble.</p>

<p>Theodore Rand rode the Pony Express during the entire period of its
organization. His run was from Box Elder to Julesburg, one hundred and
ten miles and he made the entire distance both ways by night. His
schedule, night run though it was, required a gait of ten miles an hour,
but Rand often made it at an average of twelve, thus saving time on the
through schedule for some unfortunate rider who might have trouble and
delay. Originally, Rand used only four or five horses each way, but this
number, in keeping with the revised policy of the Company, was afterward
doubled, an extra mount being furnished him every twelve or fifteen
miles.</p>

<p>Johnnie Frey who has already been mentioned as the first rider out of
St. Joseph, was little more than a boy when he entered the pony service.
He was a native Missourian, weighing less than one hundred and
twenty-five pounds. Though small in stature, he was every inch a man.
Frey's division ran from St. Joseph to Seneca, Kansas, eighty miles,
which he covered at an average of twelve and one half miles an hour,
including all stops. When the war started, Frey enlisted in the Union
army under General Blunt. His short but worthy career was cut short in
1863 when he fell in a hand-to-hand fight with rebel bushwhackers in
Arkansas. In this, his last fight, Frey is said to have killed five of
his assailants before being struck down.</p>

<p>Jim Beatley, whose real name was Foote, was another Virginian, about
twenty-five years of age. He rode on an eastern division, usually west
out of Seneca. On one occasion, he traveled from Seneca to Big Sandy,
fifty miles and back, doubling his route twice in one week. Beatley was
killed by a stage hand in a personal quarrel, the affair taking place on
a ranch in Southern Nebraska in 1862.</p>

<p>William Boulton was one of the older riders in the service; his age at
that time is given at about thirty-five. Boulton rode for about three
months with Beatley[24]. On one occasion, while running between Seneca
and Guittards', Boulton's horse gave out when five miles from the latter
station. Without a moment's delay, he removed his letter pouch and
hurried the mail in on foot, where a fresh horse was at once provided and
the schedule resumed.</p>

<p>Melville Baughn, usually known as "Mel," had a pony run between Fort
Kearney and Thirty-two-mile Creek. Once while "laying off" between trips,
a thief made off with his favorite horse. Scarcely had the miscreant
gotten away when Baughn discovered the loss. Hastily saddling another
steed, "Mel" gave pursuit, and though handicapped, because the outlaw had
the pick of the stable, Baughn's superior horsemanship, even on an
inferior mount, soon told. After a chase of several miles, he forced the
fellow so hard that he abandoned the stolen animal at a place called Loup
Fork, and sneaked away. Recovering the horse, Baughn then returned to his
station, found a mail awaiting him, and was off on his run without
further delay. With him and his fellow employes, running down a horse
thief was but a trifling incident and an annoyance merely because of the
bother and delay which it necessitated. Baughn was afterward hanged for
murder at Seneca, but his services to the Pony Express were above
reproach.</p>

<p>Another Eastern Division man was Jack Keetly, who also rode from St.
Joseph to Seneca, alternating at times with Frey and Baughn. Keetley's
greatest performance, and one of the most remarkable ever achieved in the
service, was riding from Rock Creek to St. Joseph; then back to his
starting point and on to Seneca, and from Seneca once more to Rock Creek
&mdash;three hundred and forty miles without rest. He traveled
continuously for thirty-one hours, his entire run being at the rate of
eleven miles an hour. During the last five miles of his journey, he fell
asleep in the saddle and in this manner concluded his long trip.</p>

<p>Don C. Rising, who afterwards settled in Northern Kansas, was born in
Painted Post, Steuben County, New York, in 1844, and came West when
thirteen years of age. He rode in the pony service nearly a year, from
November, 1860, until the line was abandoned the following October, most
of his service being rendered before he was seventeen. Much of his time
was spent running eastward out of Fort Kearney until the telegraph had
reached that point and made the operation of the Express between the fort
and St. Joseph no longer necessary. On two occasions, Rising is said to
have maintained a continuous speed of twenty miles an hour while carrying
important dispatches between Big Sandy and Rock Creek.</p>

<p>One rider who was well known as "Little Yank" was a boy scarcely out
of his teens and weighing barely one hundred pounds. He rode along the
Platte River between Cottonwood Springs and old Julesburg and frequently
made one hundred miles on a single trip.</p>

<p>Another man named Hogan, of whom little is known, rode northwesterly
out of Julesburg across the Platte and to Mud Springs, eighty miles.</p>

<p>Jimmy Clark rode between various stations east of Fort Kearney,
usually between Big Sandy and Hollenburg. Sometimes his run took him as
far West as Liberty Farm on the Little Blue River.</p>

<p>James W. Brink, or "Dock" Brink as he was known to his associates, was
one of the early riders, entering the employ of the Pony Express Company
in April, 1860. While "Dock" made a good record as a courier, his chief
fame was gained in a fight at Rock Creek station, in which Brink and Wild
Bill[25] "cleaned out" the McCandless gang of outlaws, killing five of
their number.</p>

<p>Charles Cliff had an eighty-mile pony run when only seventeen years of
age, but, like Brink, young Cliff gained his greatest reputation as a
fighter,&mdash;in his case fighting Indians. It seems that while Cliff
was once freighting with a small train of nine wagons, it was attacked by
a party of one hundred Sioux Indians and besieged for three days until a
larger train approached and drove the redskins away. During the conflict,
Cliff received three bullets in his body and twenty-seven in his
clothing, but he soon recovered from his injuries, and was afterward none
the less valuable to the Pony Express service.</p>

<p>J. G. Kelley, later a citizen of Denver, was a veteran pony man. He
entered the employ of the company at the outset, and helped
Superintendent Roberts to lay out the route across Nevada. Along the
Carson River, tiresome stretches of corduroy road had to be built. Kelley
relates that in constructing this highway willow trees were cut near the
stream and the trunks cut into the desired lengths before being laid in
place. The men often had to carry these timbers in their arms for three
hundred yards, while the mosquitoes swarmed so thickly upon their faces
and hands as to make their real color and identity hard to determine.</p>

<p>At the Sink of the Carson[26], a great depression of the river on its
course through the desert, Kelley assisted in building a fort for
protecting the line against Indians. Here there were no rocks nor timber,
and so the structure had to be built of adobe mud. To get this mud to a
proper consistency, the men tramped it all day with their bare feet. The
soil was soaked with alkali, and as a result, according to Kelley's
story, their feet were swollen so as to resemble "hams."</p>

<p>They next erected a fort at Sand Springs, twenty miles from Carson
Lake, and another at Cold Springs, thirty-two miles east of Sand Springs.
At Cold Springs, Kelley was appointed assistant station-keeper under Jim
McNaughton. An outbreak of the Pah-Ute Indians was now in progress, and
as the little station was in the midst of the disturbed area, there was
plenty of excitement.</p>

<p>One night while Kelley was on guard his attention was attracted by the
uneasiness of the horses. Gazing carefully through the dim light, he saw
an Indian peering over the outer wall or stockade. The orders of the post
were to shoot every Indian that came within range, so Kelley blazed away,
but missed his man. In the morning, many tracks were found about the
place. This wild shot had probably frightened the prowlers away, saving
the station from attack, and certain destruction.</p>

<p>During this same morning, a Mexican pony rider came in, mortally
wounded, having been shot by the savages from ambush while passing
through a dense thicket in the vicinity known as Quaking Asp Bottom.
Although given tender care, the poor fellow died within a few hours after
his arrival. The mail was waiting and it must go. Kelley, who was the
lightest man in in the place&mdash;he weighed but one hundred
pounds&mdash; was now ordered by the boss to take the dead man's place,
and go on with the dispatches. This he did, finishing the run without
further incident. On his return trip he had to pass once more through the
aspen thicket where his predecessor had received his death wound. This
was one of the most dangerous points on the entire trail, for the road
zigzagged through a jungle, following a passage-way that was only large
enough to admit a horse and rider; for two miles a man could not see more
than thirty or forty feet ahead. Kelley was expecting trouble, and went
through like a whirlwind, at the same time holding a repeating rifle in
readiness should trouble occur. On having cleared the thicket, he drew
rein on the top of a hill, and, looking back over his course, saw the
bushes moving in a suspicious manner. Knowing there was no live stock in
that locality and that wild game rarely abounded there, he sent several
shots in the direction of the moving underbrush. The motion soon ceased,
and he galloped onward, unharmed.</p>

<p>A few days later, two United States soldiers, while traveling to join
their command, were ambushed and murdered in the same thicket.</p>

<p>This was about the time when Major Ormsby's command was massacred by
the Utes in the disaster at Pyramid Lake[27], and the Indians everywhere
in Nevada were unusually aggressive and dangerous. There were seldom more
than three or four men in the little station and it is remarkable that
Kelley and his companions were not all killed.</p>

<p>One of Kelley's worst rides, in addition to the episode just related,
was the stretch between Cold Springs and Sand Springs for thirty-seven
miles without a drop of water along the way.</p>

<p>Once, while dashing past a wagon train of immigrants, a whole
fusillade of bullets was fired at Kelley who narrowly escaped with his
life. Of course he could not stop the mail to see why he had been shot
at, but on his return trip he met the same crowd, and in unprintable
language told them what he thought of their lawless and irresponsible
conduct. The only satisfaction he could get from them in reply was the
repeated assertion, "We thought you was an Indian!"[28] Nor was Kelley
the only pony rider who took narrow chances from the guns of excited
immigrants. Traveling rapidly and unencumbered, the rider, sunburned and
blackened by exposure, must have borne on first glance no little
resemblance to an Indian; and especially would the mistake be natural to
excited wagon-men who were always in fear of dashing attacks from mounted
Indians&mdash; attacks in which a single rider would often be deployed to
ride past the white men at utmost speed in order to draw their fire. Then
when their guns were empty a hidden band of savages would make a furious
onslaught. It was the established rule of the West in those days, in case
of suspected danger, to shoot first, and make explanations afterward; to
do to the other fellow as he would do to you, and do it first!</p>

<p>Added to the perils of the wilderness deserts, blizzards, and wild
Indians&mdash;the pony riders, then, had at times to beware of their
white friends under such circumstances as have been narrated. And that
added to the tragical romance of their daily lives. Yet they courted
danger and were seldom disappointed, for danger was always near them.</p>

<p>[23] Root and Connelley.</p>

<p>[24] Pony riders often alternated "runs" with each other over their
respective divisions in the same manner as do railroad train crews at the
present time.</p>

<p>[25] "Wild Bill" Hickock was one of the most noted gun fighters that
the West ever produced. As marshal of Abilene, Kansas, and other wild
frontier towns he became a terror to bad men and compelled them to
respect law and order when under his jurisdiction. Probably no man has
ever equaled him in the use of the six shooter. Numerous magazine
articles describing his career can be found.</p>

<p>[28] Indians would sometimes gaze in open-mouthed wonder at the
on-rushing ponies. To some of them, the "pony outfit" was "bad medicine"
and not to be molested. There was a certain air of mystery about the
wonderful system and untiring energy with which the riders followed their
course. Unfortunately, a majority of the red men were not always content
to watch the Express in simple wonder. They were too frequently bent upon
committing deviltry to refrain from doing harm whenever they had a
chance.</p>

<h3><a name="1_0_9">Chapter VII. Anecdotes of the Trail and Honor
Roll</a></h3>

<p>No detailed account of the Pony Express would be complete without
mentioning the adventures of Robert Haslam, in those days called "Pony
Bob," and William F. Cody, who is known to fame and posterity as "Buffalo
Bill."</p>

<p>Haslam's banner performance came about in a matter-of-fact way, as is
generally the case with deeds of heroism. On a certain trip during the
Ute raids mentioned in the last chapter, he stopped at Reed's Station on
the Carson River in Nevada, and found no change of horses, since all the
animals had been appropriated by the white men of the vicinity for a
campaign against the Indians. Haslam therefore fed the horse he was
riding, and after a short rest started for Bucklands[29], the next
station which was fifteen miles down the river. He had already ridden
seventy-five miles and was due to lay off at the latter place. But on
arriving, his successor, a man named Johnson Richardson, was unable or
indisposed to go on with the mail[30]. It happened that Division
Superintendent W. C. Marley was at Bucklands when Haslam arrived, and,
since Richardson would not go on duty, Marley offered "Pony Bob" fifty
dollars bonus if he would take up the route. Haslam promptly accepted the
proposal, and within ten minutes was off, armed with a revolver and
carbine, on his new journey. He at first had a lonesome ride of
thirty-five miles to the Sink of the Carson. Reaching the place without
mishap, he changed mounts and hurried on for thirty-seven miles over the
alkali wastes and through the sand until he came to Cold Springs. Here he
again changed horses and once more dashed on, this time for thirty miles
without stopping, till Smith's Creek was reached where he was relieved by
J. G. Kelley. "Bob" had thus ridden one hundred and eighty-five miles
without stopping except to change mounts. At Smith's Creek he slept nine
hours and then started back with the return mail. On reaching Cold
Springs once more, he found himself in the midst of tragedy. The Indians
had been there. The horses had been stolen. All was in ruins. Nearby lay
the corpse of the faithful station-keeper. Small cheer for a tired horse
and rider! Haslam watered his steed and pounded ahead without rest or
refreshment. Before he had covered half the distance to the next station,
darkness was falling. The journey was enshrouded with danger. On every
side were huge clumps of sage-bush which would offer excellent chances
for savages to lie in ambush. The howling of wolves added to the
dolefulness of the trip. And haunting him continuously was the thought of
the ruined little station and the stiffened corpse behind him. But pony
riders were men of courage and nerve, and Bob was no exception. He
arrived at Sand Springs safely; but here there was to be no rest nor
delay. After reporting the outrage he had just seen, he advised the
station man of his danger, and, after changing horses, induced the latter
to accompany him on to the Sink of the Carson, which move doubtless saved
the latter's life. Reaching the Carson, they found a badly frightened lot
of men who had been attacked by the Indians only a few hours previously.
A party of fifteen with plenty of arms and ammunition had gathered in the
adobe station, which was large enough also to accommodate as, many
horses. Nearby was a cool spring of water, and, thus fortified, they were
to remain, in a state of siege, if necessary, until the marauders
withdrew from that vicinity. Of course they implored Haslam to remain
with them and not risk his life venturing away with the mail. But the
mail must go; and the schedule, hard as it was, must be maintained. "Bob"
had no conception of fear, and so he galloped away, after an hour's rest.
And back into Bucklands he came unharmed, after having suffered only
three and a half hours of delay. Superintendent Marley, who was still
present when the daring rider returned, at once raised his bonus from
fifty to one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Nor was this all of Haslam's great achievement. The west-bound mail
would soon arrive, and there was nobody to take his regular run. So after
resting an hour and a half, he resumed the saddle and hurried back along
his old trail, over the Sierras to Friday's Station. Then "Bob" rested
after having ridden three hundred and eighty miles with scarcely eleven
hours of lay-off, and within a very few hours of regular schedule time
all the way. In speaking of this performance afterwards, Haslam[31]
modestly admitted that he was "rather tired," but that "the excitement of
the trip had braced him up to stand the journey."</p>

<p>The most widely known of all the pony riders is William F. Cody&mdash;
usually called "Bill," who in early life resided in Kansas and was raised
amid the exciting scenes of frontier life. Cody had an unusually
dangerous route between Red Buttes and Three Crossings. The latter place
was on the Sweetwater River, and derived its name from the fact that the
stream which followed the bed of a rocky ca&ntilde;on, had to be crossed
three times within a space of sixty yards. The water coming down from the
mountains, was always icy cold and the current swift, deep, and
treacherous. The whole bottom of the ca&ntilde;on was often submerged,
and in attempting to follow its course along the channel of the stream,
both horse and rider were liable to plunge at any time into some abysmal
whirlpool. Besides the excitement which the Three Crossings and an Indian
country furnished, Cody's trail ran through a region that was often
frequented by desperadoes. Furthermore, he had to ford the North Platte
at a point where the stream was half a mile in width and in places twelve
feet deep. Though the current was at times slow, dangers from quicksand
were always to be feared on these prairie rivers. Cody, then but a youth,
had to surmount these obstacles and cover his trip at an average of
fifteen miles an hour.</p>

<p>Cody entered the Pony Express service just after the line had been
organized. At Julesburg he met George Chrisman, an old friend who was
head wagon-master for Russell, Majors, and Waddell's freighting
department. Chrisman was at the time acting as an agent for the express
line, and, out of deference to the youth, he hired him temporarily to
ride the division then held by a pony man named Trotter. It was a short
route, one of the shortest on the system, aggregating only forty-five
miles, and with three relays of horses each way. Cody, who had been
accustomed to the saddle all his young life, had no trouble in following
the schedule, but after keeping the run several weeks, the lad was
relieved by the regular incumbent, and then went east, to Leavenworth,
where he fell in with another old friend, Lewis Simpson, then acting as
wagon boss and fitting up at Atchison a wagon train of supplies for the
old stage line at Fort Laramie and points beyond. Acting through Simpson,
Cody obtained a letter of recommendation from Mr. Russell, the head of
the firm, addressed to Jack Slade, Superintendent of the division between
Julesburg and Rocky Ridge, with headquarters at Horseshoe Station,
thirty-six miles west of Fort Laramie, in what is now Wyoming. Armed with
this letter, young Cody accompanied Simpson's wagon-train to Laramie, and
soon found Superintendent Slade. The superintendent, observing the lad's
tender years and frail stature, was skeptical of his ability to serve as
a pony rider; but on learning that Cody was the boy who had already given
satisfactory service as a substitute some months before, at once engaged
him and assigned him to the perilous run of seventy-six miles between Red
Buttes and Three Crossings. For some weeks all went well. Then, one day
when he reached his terminal at Three Crossings, Cody found that his
successor who was to have taken the mail out, had been killed the night
before. As there was no extra rider available, it fell to young Cody to
fill the dead courier's place until a successor could be procured. The
lad was undaunted and anxious for the added responsibility. Within a
moment he was off on a fresh horse for Rocky Ridge, eighty-five miles
away. Notwithstanding the dangers and great fatigue of the trip, Cody
rode safely from Three Crossings to his terminal and returned with the
eastbound mail, going back over his own division and into Red Buttes
without delay or mishap&mdash;an aggregate run of three hundred and
twenty-two miles. This was probably the longest continuous performance
without formal rest period in the history of this or any other courier
service.</p>

<p>Not long afterward, Cody was chased by a band of Sioux Indians while
making one of his regular trips. The savages were armed with revolvers,
and for a few minutes made it lively for the young messenger. But the
superior speed and endurance of his steed soon told; lying flat on the
animal's neck, he quickly distanced his assailants and thundered into
Sweetwater, the next station, ahead of schedule. Here he found&mdash;as
so often happened in the history of the express service&mdash;that the
place had been raided, the keeper slain, and the horses driven off. There
was nothing to do but drive his tired pony twelve miles further to Ploutz
Station, where he got a fresh horse, briefly reported what he had
observed, and completed his run without mishap.</p>

<p>On another occasion[32] it became mysteriously rumored that a certain
Pony Express pouch would carry a large sum of currency. Knowing that
there was great likelihood of some bandits or "road agents" as they were
commonly called getting wind of the consignment and attempting a holdup,
Cody hit upon a little emergency ruse. He provided himself with an extra
mochila which he stuffed with waste papers and placed over the saddle in
the regular position. The pouch containing the currency was hidden under
a special saddle blanket. With his customary revolver loaded and ready,
Cody then started. His suspicions were soon confirmed, for on reaching a
particularly secluded spot, two highwaymen stepped from concealment, and
with leveled rifles compelled the boy to stop, at the same time demanding
the letter pouch. Holding up his hands as ordered, Cody began to
remonstrate with the thugs for robbing the express, at the same time
declaring to them that they would hang for their meanness if they carried
out their plans. In reply to this they told Cody that they would take
their own chances. They knew what he carried and they wanted it. They had
no particular desire to harm him, but unless he handed over the pouch
without delay they would shoot him full of holes, and take it anyhow.
Knowing that to resist meant certain death Cody began slowly to unfasten
the dummy pouch, still protesting with much indignation. Finally, after
having loosed it, he raised the pouch and hurled it at the head off the
nearest outlaw, who dodged, half amused at the young fellow's spirit.
Both men were thus taken slightly off their guard, and that instant the
rider acted like a flash. Whipping out his revolver, he disabled the
farther villain; and before the other, who had stooped to recover the
supposed mail sack, could straighten up or use a weapon, Cody dug the
spurs into his horse, knocked him down, rode over him and was gone.
Before the half-stunned robber could recover himself to shoot, horse and
rider were out of range and running like mad for the next station, where
they arrived ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>The following is a partial list, so far as is known[33], of the men
who rode the Pony Express and contributed to the lasting fame of the
enterprise:</p>

<p>Baughn, Melville Beatley, Jim "Boston" Boulton, William Brink, James
W. Burnett, John Bucklin, Jimmy Carr, William Carrigan, William Cates,
Bill Clark, Jimmy Cliff, Charles Cody, William F. Egan, Major Ellis, J.
K. Faust, H. J. Fisher, John Frey, Johnnie Gentry, Jim Gilson, Jim
Hamilton, Sam Haslam, Robert Hogan (first name missing) Huntington, Let
"Irish Tom" James, William Jenkins, Will D. Kelley, Jay G. Keetley, Jack
"Little Yank" Martin, Bob McCall, J. G. McDonald, James McNaughton, Jim
Moore, Jim Perkins, Josh Rand, Theodore Richardson, Johnson Riles, Bart
Rising, Don C. Roff, Harry Spurr, George Thacher, George Towne, George
Wallace, Henry Westcott, Dan Zowgaltz, Jose.</p>

<p>Many of these men were rough and unlettered. Many died deaths of
violence. The bones of many lie in unknown graves. Some doubtless lie
unburied somewhere in the great West, in the winning of which their lives
were lost. Yet be it always remembered, that in the history of the
American nation they played an important part. They were bold-hearted
citizen knights to whom is due the honors of uncrowned kings.</p>

<p>[29] Afterwards named Fort Churchill. This ride took place in the
summer of 1860.</p>

<p>[30] Some reports say that Richardson was stricken with fear. That he
was probably suffering from overwrought nerves, resulting from excessive
risks which his run had involved, is a more correct inference. This is
the only case on record of a pony messenger failing to respond to duty,
unless killed or disabled.</p>

<p>[31] After the California Pony Express was abandoned, Bob rode for
Wells Fargo Co., between Friday's Station and Virginia City, Nevada, a
distance of one hundred miles. He seems to have enjoyed horseback riding,
for he made this roundtrip journey in twenty-four hours. When the Central
Pacific R. R. was built, and this pony line abandoned, Haslam rode for
six months a twenty-three mile division between Virginia City and Reno,
traveling the distance in less than one hour. To accomplish this feat, he
used a relay of fifteen horses. He was afterwards transfered to Idaho
where he continued in a similar capacity on a one hundred mile run before
quitting the service for a less exciting vocation.</p>

<h3><a name="1_0_10">Chapter VIII. Early Overland Mail Routes</a></h3>

<p>In the history of overland transportation in America, the Pony Express
is but one in a series of many enterprises. As emphasized at the
beginning of this book, its importance lay in its opportuneness; in the
fact that it appeared at the psychological moment, and fitted into the
course of events at a critical period, prior to the completion of the
telegraph; and when some form of rapid transit between the Missouri River
and the Pacific Coast was absolutely needed. To give adequate setting to
this story, a brief account of the leading overland routes, of which the
Pony Express was but one, seems proper.</p>

<p>Before the middle of the nineteenth century, three great thoroughfares
had been established from the Missouri, westward across the continent.
These were the Santa Fe, the Salt Lake, and the Oregon trails. All had
important branches and lesser stems, and all are today followed by
important railroads&mdash;a splendid testimonial to the ability of the
pioneer pathfinders in selecting the best routes.</p>

<p>Of these trails, that leading to Santa Fe was the oldest, having been
fully established before 1824. The Salt Lake and Oregon routes date some
twenty years later, coming into existence in the decade between 1840 and
1850. It is incidentally with the Salt Lake trail that the story of the
Pony Express mainly deals.</p>

<p>The Mormon settlement of Utah in 1847-48, followed almost immediately
by the discovery of gold in California, led to the first mail route[34]
across the country, west of the Missouri. This was known as the "Great
Salt Lake Mail," and the first contract for transporting it was let July
1, 1850, to Samuel H. Woodson of Independence, Missouri. By terms of this
agreement, Woodson was to haul the mail monthly from Independence on the
Missouri River to Salt Lake City, twelve hundred miles, and return.
Woodson later arranged with some Utah citizens to carry a mail between
Salt Lake City and Fort Laramie, the service connecting with the
Independence mail at the former place. This supplementary line was put
into operation August 1, 1851.</p>

<p>In the early fifties, while the California gold craze was still on, a
monthly route was laid out between Sacramento and Salt Lake City[35].
This service was irregular and unreliable; and since the growing
population of California demanded a direct overland route, a four year
monthly contract was granted to W. F. McGraw, a resident of Maryland. His
subsidy from Congress was $13,500.00 a year. In those days it often took
a month to get mail from Independence to Salt Lake City, and about six
weeks for the entire trip. Although McGraw charged $180.00 fare for each
passenger to Salt Lake City, and $300.00 to California, he failed, in
1856. The unexpired contract was then let to the Mormon firm of Kimball
Co., and they kept the route in operation until the Mormon troubles of
1857 when the Government abrogated the agreement.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1857, General Albert Sidney Johnston, later of Civil
War fame, was sent out with a Federal army of five thousand men to invade
Utah. After a rather fruitless campaign, Johnston wintered at Fort
Bridger, in what is southwestern Wyoming, not far from the Utah line.
During this interval, army supplies were hauled from Fort Leavenworth
with only a few way stations for changing teams. This improvised line,
carrying mail occasionally, which went over the old Mormon trail via
South Pass, and Forts Kearney, Laramie, and Bridger, was for many months
the only service available for this entire region.</p>

<p>The next contract for getting mail into Utah was let in 1858 to John
M. Hockaday of Missouri. Johnston's army was then advancing from winter
quarters at Bridger toward the valley of Great Salt Lake, and the
Government wanted mail oftener then once a month. In consideration of
$190,000.00 annually which was to be paid in monthly installments,
Hockaday agreed to put on a weekly mail. This route, which ran from St.
Joseph to Salt Lake City, was later combined with a line that had been
running from Salt Lake to Sacramento, thus making a continuous weekly
route to and from California. For the combined route the Government paid
$320,000.00 annually. Its actual yearly receipts were $5,142.03.</p>

<p>The discovery of gold in the vicinity of Denver in the summer of 1858
caused another wild excitement and a great rush which led to the
establishment in the summer of 1859 of the Leavenworth and Pike's Peak
Express, from the Missouri to Denver. As then traveled, this route was
six hundred and eighty-seven miles in length. The line as operated by
Russell, Majors, and Waddell, and that same year they took over
Hockaday's business. As has already been stated, the new firm of Pony
Express fame&mdash;called the Central Overland California and Pike's Peak
Express Co.&mdash;consolidated the old California line, which had been
run in two sections, East and West, with the Denver line. In addition to
the Pony Express it carried on a big passenger and freighting business to
and from Denver and California.</p>

<p>Turning now to the lines that were placed in commission farther South.
The first overland stage between Santa Fe and Independence was started in
May, 1849. This was also a monthly service, and by 1850 it was fully
equipped with the famous Concord coaches, which vehicles were soon to be
used on every overland route in the West. Within five years, this route,
which was eight hundred fifty miles in length and followed the Santa Fe
trail, now the route of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe railroad, had
attained great importance. The Government finally awarded it a yearly
subsidy of $10,990.00, but as the trail had little or no military
protection except at Fort Union, New Mexico, and for hundreds of miles
was exposed to the attacks of prairie Indians, the contractors complained
because of heavy losses and sought relief of the Post Office and War
Departments. Finally they were released from their old contract and
granted a new one paying $25,000.00 annually, but even then they fell
behind $5,000.00 per year.</p>

<p>By special act passed August 3, 1854, Congress laid out a monthly mail
route from Neosho, Missouri, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, with an annual
subsidy of $17,000.00. Since the Mexican War this region had come to be
of great commercial and military importance. A little later, in March
1855, the route was changed by the Government to run monthly from
Independence and Kansas City, Missouri, to Stockton, California, via
Albuquerque, and the contractors were awarded a yearly bonus of
$80,000.00 This line was also a financial failure.</p>

<p>The early overland routes were granted large subsidies and the
privilege of charging high rates for passengers and freight. To the
casual observer it may seem strange that practically all these lines
operated at a disastrous loss. It should be noted however, that they
covered an immense territory, many portions of which were occupied by
hostile Indians. It is no easy task to move military forces and supplies
thousands of miles through a wilderness. Furthermore, the Indians were
elusive and hard to find when sought by a considerable force. They
usually managed to attack when and where they were least expected.
Consequently, if protection were secured at all, it usually fell to the
lot of the stage companies to police their own lines, which was expensive
business. Often they waged, single-handed, Indian campaigns of
considerable importance, and the frontiersmen whom they could assemble
for such duty were sometimes more effective than the soldiers who were
unfamiliar with the problems of Indian warfare.</p>

<p>Added to these difficulties were those incident to severe weather,
deep snow, and dangerous streams, since regular highways and bridges were
almost unknown in the regions traversed. Not to mention the handicap and
expense which all these natural obstacles entailed, business on many
lines was light, and revenues low.</p>

<p>News from Washington about the creation of the new territory of
Utah&mdash; in September 1850&mdash;was not received in Salt Lake City
until January 1851. The report reached Utah by messenger from California,
having come around the continent by way of the Isthmus of Panama. The
winters of 1851-52, and 1852-53 were frightfully severe and such
expensive delays were not uncommon. The November mail of 1856 was
compelled to winter in the mountains.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1856-57 no steady service could be maintained between
Salt Lake City and Missouri on account of bad weather. Finally, after a
long delay, the postmaster at Salt Lake City contracted with the local
firm of Little, Hanks, and Co., to get a special mail to and from
Independence. This was accomplished, but the ordeal required
seventy-eight days, during which men and animals suffered terribly from
cold and hunger. The firm received $1,500.00 for its trouble. The Salt
Lake route returned to the Government a yearly income of only
$5,000.00.</p>

<p>The route from Independence to Stockton, which cost Uncle Sam
$80,000.00 a year, collected in nine months only $1,255.00 in postal
revenues, whereupon it was abolished July 1st, 1859.</p>

<p>By the close of 1859 there were at least six different mail routes
across the continent from the Missouri to the Pacific Coast. They were
costing the Government a total of $2,184,696.00 and returning
$339,747.34. The most expensive of these lines was the New York and New
Orleans Steamship Company route, which ran semi-monthly from New York to
San Francisco via Panama. This service cost $738,250.00 annually and
brought in $229,979.69. While the steamship people did not have the
frontier dangers to confront them, they were operating over a roundabout
course, several thousand miles in extent, and the volume of their postal
business was simply inadequate to meet the expense of maintaining their
business[36].</p>

<p>The steamer schedule was about four weeks in either direction, and the
rapidly increasing population of California soon demanded, in the early
fifties, a faster and more frequent service. Agitation to that end was
thus started, and during the last days of Pierce's administration, in
March 1857, the "Overland Mail" bill was passed by Congress and signed by
the President. This act provided that the Postmaster-General should
advertise for bids until June 30 following: "for the conveyance of the
entire letter mail from such point on the Mississippi River as the
contractors may select to San Francisco, Cal., for six years, at a cost
not exceeding $300,000 per annum for semi-monthly, $450,000 for weekly,
or $600,000 for semi-weekly service to be performed semi-monthly, weekly,
or semi-weekly at the option of the Postmaster-General." The
specifications also stipulated a twenty-five day schedule, good coaches,
and four-horse teams.</p>

<p>Bids were opened July 1, 1857. Nine were submitted, and most of them
proposed starting from St. Louis, thence going overland in a
southwesterly direction usually via Albuquerque. Only one bid proposed
the more northerly Central route via Independence, Fort Laramie, and Salt
Lake. The Postoffice Department was opposed to this trail, and its
attitude had been confirmed by the troubles of winter travel in the past.
In fact this route had been a failure for six consecutive winters, due to
the deep snows of the high mountains which it crossed.</p>

<p>On July 2, 1857, the Postmaster General announced the acceptance of
bid No. "12,587" which stipulated a forked route from St. Louis, Missouri
and from Memphis, Tennessee, the lines converging at Little Rock,
Arkansas. Thence the course was by way of Preston, Texas; or as nearly as
might be found advisable, to the best point in crossing the Rio Grande
above El Paso, and not far from Fort Filmore; thence along the new road
then being opened and constructed by the Secretary of the Interior to
Fort Yuma, California; thence through the best passes and along the best
valleys for safe and expeditious staging to San Francisco. On September
is following, a six year contract was let for this route. The successful
firm at once became known as the "Butterfield Overland Mail Company."
Among the firm members were John Butterfield, Wm. B. Dinsmore, D. N.
Barney, Wm. G. Fargo and Hamilton Spencer. The extreme length of the
route agreed upon from St. Louis to San Francisco was two thousand seven
hundred and twenty-nine miles; the most southern point was six hundred
miles south of South Pass on the old Salt Lake route. Because of the
out-of-the-way southern course followed, two and one half days more than
necessary were nominally-required in making the journey. Yet the postal
authorities believed that this would be more than offset by the southerly
course being to a great extent free from winter snows.</p>

<p>On September 15, 1858, after elaborate preparations, the overland
mails started from San Francisco and St. Louis on the twenty-five day
schedule &mdash;which was three days less than that of the water route.
The postage rate was ten cents for each half ounce; the passenger fare
was one hundred dollars in gold. The first trip was made in twenty-four
days, and in each of the terminal cities big celebrations were held in
honor of the event. And yet today, four splendid lines of railway cover
this distance in about three days!</p>

<p>These stages&mdash;to use the west-bound route as an
illustration&mdash; traveled in an elliptical course through Springfield,
Missouri, and Fayetteville, Arkansas, to Van Buren, Arkansas, where the
Memphis mail was received. Continuing in a southwesterly course, they
passed through Indian Territory and the Choctaw Indian reserve&mdash;now
Oklahoma - crossed the Red River at Calvert's Ferry, then on through
Sherman, Fort Chadbourne and Fort Belknap, Texas, through Guadaloupe Pass
to El Paso; thence up the Rio Grande River through the Mesilla Valley,
and into western New Mexico&mdash;now Arizona to Tucson. Then the journey
led up the Gila River to Arizona City, across the Mojave desert in
Southern California and finally through the San Joaquin Valley to San
Francisco.</p>

<p>Today a traveler could cover nearly the same route, leaving St. Louis
over the Frisco Railroad, transferring to the Texas Pacific at Fort
Worth, and taking the Southern Pacific at El Paso for the remainder of
the trip.</p>

<p>As has been shown, the outbreak of the Civil War in the spring of 1861
made it necessary for the Federal Government to transfer this big and
important route further north to get it beyond the latitude of the
Confederacy. Hence the Southern route was formally abandoned[37] on March
12, 1861, and the equipment removed to the Central or Salt Lake trail
where a daily service was inaugurated. About three months was necessary
to move all the outfits and in July 1861, the first daily overland
mail&mdash;running six times a week&mdash;was started between St. Joseph
and Placerville, California, 1,920 miles by the way of Forts Kearney,
Bridger, and Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>The Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad had been built into St. Joseph
and was doing business by February 1859. For some time that city enjoyed
the honor of being the eastern stage terminal; but within a year the
railroad was extended to Atchison, about twenty miles down the stream.
The latter place is situated on a bend of the river fourteen miles west
of St. Joseph, and so the terminal honors soon passed to Atchison since
its westerly location shortened the haul.</p>

<p>In transferring the Butterfield line from the Southern to the Central
route, it was merged with the Central Overland California and Pike's Peak
Express Company which already included the Leavenworth and Pike's Peak
Express Company, under the leadership of General Bela M. Hughes. This
line was known to the Government as the Central Overland California
Route. As soon as the transfer was completed, through California stages
were started on an eighteen day schedule a full week less time than had
been required by the Butterfield route, and ten days less than that of
the Panama steamers. This was the most famous of all the stage routes,
and except for three interruptions, due to Indian outbreaks in 1862,
1864, and 1865, it did business continuously for several years.</p>

<p>Within a few months came another change of proprietorship, the route
passing on a mortgage foreclosure into the hands of Benjamin Holladay, a
famous stage line promoter, late in 1861. Early the following year
Holladay reorganized the management under the name of the Overland Stage
Line. This seems to have been what today is technically known as a
holding company; for until the expiration of the old Butterfield contract
in 1863[38], he allowed the business east of Salt Lake City to be carried
on by the old C. O. C. P. P. Co.; west of Salt Lake, the new Overland
Line allowed, or sublet the through traffic to a vigorous subsidiary, the
Pioneer Stage Line[39].</p>

<p>Holladay was fortunate in securing a new mail contract for the Central
route which he now controlled. For supplying a six day letter mail
service from the Missouri to Placerville together with a way mail to and
from Denver and Salt Lake City, he was paid $1,000,000 a year for the
three years beginning July 1, 1861. At the expiration of this period he
was to get $840,000.</p>

<p>In the meantime gold was discovered in Idaho and Montana, and
Holladay, encouraged by his big subsidy from the Government, put stage
lines into Virginia City, Montana, and Boise City, Idaho.</p>

<p>In 1866 the Butterfield Overland Despatch, an express and fast freight
line, was started above the Smoky Hill route from Topeka and Leavenworth
across Kansas to Denver. Within a short time this organization, mainly
because of the heavy expense caused by Indian depredations, and was
consolidated with the Holladay Company. Just prior to this transfer, Mr.
Holladay received from the Colorado Territorial legislature a charter for
the "Holladay Overland Mail and Express Company," which was the full and
formal name of the new concern. This corporation now owned and controlled
stage lines aggregating thirty-three hundred miles. It brought the
service up to the highest point of efficiency and used only the best
animals and vehicles it was possible to obtain.</p>

<p>In addition to his federal mail bonus, Holladay had the following
rates for passenger traffic in force:</p>

<p>In 1863, from Atchison to Denver $75.00</p>

<p>In 1863, from Atchison to Salt Lake City $150.00</p>

<p>In 1863, from Atchison to Placerville $225.00</p>

<p>In 1865, on account of the rise of gold and the depreciation of
currency, these rates were increased; the fare from the Missouri River to
Denver was changed to $175.00; to Salt Lake $350.00. The California rate
varied from $400.00 to $500.00. A year later the fare to Virginia City,
Montana, was fixed at $350.00 and the rate to Salt Lake City reduced to
$225.00.</p>

<p>These high rates and Indian dangers did not seem to check the desire
on the part of the public to make the overland trip. Stages were almost
always crowded, and it was usually necessary for one to apply for
reservations several days in advance.</p>

<p>Late in the year 1866, Holladay's entire properties[40] were purchased
by Wells Fargo and Co. This was a new concern, recently chartered by
Colorado, which had been quietly gaining power. Within a short time it
had exclusive control of practically all the stage, express, and
freighting business in the West and this business it held.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the overland stage and freight lines were rapidly shortening
on account of the building of the Pacific railroads, and the terminals of
the through routes became merely the temporary ends of the fast growing
railway lines. By the early autumn of 1866, the Kansas Pacific had
reached Junction City, Kansas, and the Union Pacific was at Fort Kearney,
Nebraska. The golden era of the overland stage business was from 1858 to
1866. After that, the old through routes were but fragments "between the
tracks" of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific roads which were
building East and West toward each other.</p>

<p>Wells Fargo Co., however, clung to these fragments until the lines met
on May 10th, 1869, and a continuous transcontinental railroad was
completed. Then they turned their attention to organizing mountain stage
and express lines in the railroadless regions of the West,&mdash; some of
which still exist. And they also turned their energies to the railway
express business, in which capacity this great firm, the last of the old
stage companies, is now known the world over.</p>

<p>[34] Authority for Early Mail Routes is Root and Connelley's Overland
Stage to California.</p>

<p>[35] The reader will keep in mind that during the early days of
California history, practically all communication between that locality
and the East was carried on by steamship from New York via Panama.</p>

<p>[36] In June, 1860, Congress got into trouble with this company over
postal compensations. The steamship company, it appears, thought its
remuneration too low and it further protested that the diversion of mail
traffic, due to the daily Overland Stage Line and the Pony Express would
reduce its revenues still further. Congress finally adjourned without
effecting a settlement, and the mail, which was far too heavy for the
overland facilities to handle at that time, was piling up by the ton
awaiting shipment. Matters were getting serious when Cornelius Vanderbilt
came to the Government's relief and agreed to furnish steamer service
until Congress assembled in March, 1861, provided the Federal authorities
would assure him "a fair and adequate compensation." This agreement was
effected and the affair settled as agreed. At the expiration of the
period, the war and the growing importance of the overland route made
steamship service by way of the Isthmus quite obsolete.</p>

<p>[37] The contractors are said to have been awarded $50,000 by the
Government for their trouble in haying the agreement broken.</p>

<p>[38] See page 153. Holladay secured possession of the outfits of the
C. O. C. P. P. Exp. Co., between the Missouri and Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>[39] The Pioneer Line which had recently come into power and
prominence had gained possession of the equipment west of Salt Lake. This
line was owned by Louis and Charles McLane. Louis McLane afterward became
President of the Wells Fargo Express Co.</p>

<p>[40] Holladay is said to have received one million five hundred
thousand dollars cash, and three hundred thousand dollars in express
company stock for his interests. Besides these amounts which covered only
the animals, rolling stock, stations, and incidental equipment, Wells
Fargo and Co. had to pay full market value for all grain, hay and
provisions along the line, amounting to nearly six hundred thousand
dollars more.</p>

<h3><a name="1_0_11">Chapter IX. Passing of the Pony Express</a></h3>

<p>When Edward Creighton completed the Pacific telegraph, and, on October
24, 1861, began sending messages; by wire from coast to coast, the
California Pony Express formally went out of existence. For over three
months since July 1, it had been paralleled by the daily overland stage;
yet the great efficiency of the semi-weekly pony line in offering quick
letter service won and retained its popularity to the very end of its
career. And this was in spite of the fact that for several weeks before
its discontinuance the pony men had ridden only between the ends of the
fast building telegraph which was constructed in two divisions&mdash;from
the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Missouri River&mdash;at the same
time, the lines meeting near the Great Salt Lake.</p>

<p>The people of the far West strongly protested against the elimination
of the pony line service. Early in the winter of 1862 it became
rumored&mdash; perhaps wildly&mdash;that the Committee on Finance in the
House of Representatives had, for reasons of economy, stricken out the
appropriation for the continuance of the daily stage. Whereupon the
California legislature[41] addressed a set of joint resolutions to the
state's delegation in Congress, imploring not only that the Daily Stage
be retained, but that the Pony Express be reestablished. The stage was
continued but the pony line was never restored.</p>

<p>As a financial venture the Pony Express failed completely. To be sure,
its receipts were sometimes heavy, often aggregating one thousand dollars
in a single day. But the expenses, on the other hand, were enormous.
Although the line was so great a factor in the California crisis, and in
assisting the Federal Government to retain the Pacific Coast, it was the
irony of fate that Congress should never give any direct relief or
financial assistance to the pony service. So completely was this
organization neglected by the government, in so far as extending
financial aid was concerned, that its financial failure, as foreseen by
Messrs. Waddell and Majors, was certain from the beginning. The War
Department did issue army revolvers and cartridges to the riders; and the
Federal troops when available, could always be relied upon to protect the
line. Yet it was generally left to the initiative and resourcefulness of
the company to defend itself as best it could when most seriously menaced
by Indians. The apparent apathy regarding this valuable branch of the
postal service can of course be partially excused from the fact that the
Civil War was in 1861 absorbing all the energies which the Government
could summon to its command. And the war, furthermore, was playing havoc
with our national finances and piling up a tremendous national debt,
which made the extension of pecuniary relief to quasi-private operations
of this kind, no matter how useful they were, a remote possibility.</p>

<p>That the stage lines received the assistance they did, under such
circumstances, is to be wondered at. Yet it must be borne in mind that at
the outset much of the political support necessary to secure
appropriations for overland mail routes was derived from southern
congressmen who were anxious for routes of communication with the West
coast, especially if such routes ran through the Southwest and linked the
cotton-growing states with California.</p>

<p>At the very beginning, it cost about one hundred thousand dollars to
equip the Pony Express line in those days a very considerable outlay of
capital for a private corporation. Besides the purchase of more than four
hundred high grade horses, it cost large sums of money to build and equip
stations at intervals of every ten or twelve miles throughout the long
route. The wages of eighty riders and about four hundred station men, not
to mention a score of Division Superintendents was a large item.</p>

<p>Most of the grain used along the line between St. Joseph and Salt Lake
City was purchased in Iowa and Missouri and shipped in wagons at a
freight rate of from ten cents to twenty cents a pound. Grain and food
stuffs for use between Salt Lake City and the Sierras were usually bought
in Utah and hauled from two hundred to seven hundred miles to the
respective stations. Hay, gathered wherever wild grasses could be found
and cured, often had to be freighted hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>The operating expenses of the line aggregated about thirty thousand
dollars a month, which would alone have insured a deficit as the monthly
income never equaled that amount.</p>

<p>A conspicuous bill of expense which helped to bankrupt the enterprise
was for protection against the savages. While this should have been
furnished by the Government or the local state or territorial militia, it
was the fate of the Company to bear the brunt of one of the worst Indian
outbreaks of that decade.</p>

<p>Early in 1860, shortly after the Pony Express was started, the
Pah-Utes, mention of whom has already been made, began hostilities under
their renowned chieftain Old Winnemucca. The uprising spread; soon the
Bannocks and Shoshones espoused the cause of the Utes, and the entire
territory of Nevada, Eastern California and Oregon was aflame with Indian
revolt. Besides devastating many white settlements wherever they found
them, the Indians destroyed nearly every pony station between California
and Salt Lake, murdered numbers of employes, and ran off scores of
horses. For several weeks the service was paralyzed, and had it been in
the hands of faint-hearted men it would have been ended then and
there.</p>

<p>The climax came with the defeat and massacre of Major Ormsby's force
of about fifty men by the Utes at the battle of Pyramid Lake in western
Nevada. Help was finally sent in from a distance, and before the first of
June, eight hundred men, including three hundred regulars and a large
number of California and Nevada volunteers, had taken the field. This
formidable campaign finally served the double purpose of protecting the
Pony Express and stage line and in subduing the Indians in a primitive
and effective manner. Order was restored and the express service resumed
on June 19. Desultory outbreaks, of course, continued to menace the line
and all forms of transportation for months afterwards.</p>

<p>During this campaign, the local officers and employes of the express
gave valiant service. It was remarkable that they could restore the line
so quickly as they did. The total expense of this war to the Company was
$75,000, caused by ruined and stolen property and outlays for military
supplies incidental to the equipment of volunteers.</p>

<p>This onslaught, coming so soon after the enterprise had begun, and
when there was already so little encouragement that the line would ever
pay out financially, must have disheartened less courageous men than
Russell, Majors and Waddell and their associates. It is to their
everlasting credit that this group of men possessed the perseverance and
patriotic determination to continue the enterprise, even at a certain
loss, and in spite of Federal neglect, until the telegraph made it
possible to dispense with the fleet pony rider. Not only did they stick
bravely to their task of supplying a wonderful mail service to the
country, but they even improved their service, increasing it from a
weekly to a semi-weekly route, immediately after the disastrous raids of
June, 1860. Nor did they hesitate at the instigation of the Government a
little later to reduce their postal rates from five dollars to one dollar
a half ounce.</p>

<p>This condensed statement shows the approximate deficit which the
business incurred:</p>

<pre class="POEM">
To equip the line .....................................$100,000
 
Maintenance at $30,000 per month (for sixteen months). $480,000
 
War with the Utes and allied tribes ................... $75,000
 
Sundry items ...........................................$45,000
 
                                                       _________

</pre>

<p>Total ................................................ $700,000</p>

<p>The receipts are said to have been about $500,000 leaving a debit
balance of $200,000. That the Company changed hands in 1861 is not
surprising.</p>

<p>While the Pony Express failed in a financial way; it had served the
country faithfully and well. It had aided an imperiled Government, helped
to tranquilize and retain to the Union a giant commonwealth, and it had
shown the practicability of building a transcontinental railroad, and
keeping it open for traffic regardless of winter snows. All this Pony
Express did and more. It marked the supreme triumph of American spirit,
of God-fearing, man-defying American pluck and determination&mdash;
qualities which have always characterized the winning of the West.</p>
