<h2><a name="ch00" id="ch00"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

<p>From some miles away, the train was a worthwhile sight. It
slipped across the gently undulating country like a linked string
of flame-coloured jewels, now springing across an iron bridge, now
vanishing momentarily from sight as it dived into a cutting. In
that desolate stretch of country nothing seemed alive, save the
cold stars, already brightening in a sky dusky with approaching
night, and that twisting metal snake with the single flashing eye
set in its head.</p>

<p>Hans von Rasch, curled up in his corner, paid little
attention.</p>

<p>The young man sat upright and, pushing aside his rug, took a
leather wallet from his coat-pocket. He drew out a folded letter
and first glanced at the newspaper-cutting pinned in one
corner.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"A position is offered to a third or fourth
year medical student possessing a fairly sound knowledge of
anatomy. Applicants should be without family responsibilities.
Apply, giving full particulars of training and qualifications, to
'Medicus,' this office."</p>

<p>From the cutting von Rasch lowered his eyes to the letter. There
was no printed heading; the address on the top stated briefly
"Eldon Towers," and gave the date. The contents he knew by
heart.</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Sir, I have great pleasure in informing you
that your application for the position of assistant to Dr.
Bernhardt Meyersen, of this address, has been accepted. You will
report for duty on Monday, April 8th. Enclosed you will find cheque
to cover your travelling expenses, also directions as to the
vicinity of Eldon Towers.<br>
<br>
Dr. Bernhardt wishes me to impress upon you the greatest need for
discretion about your new position. You are not to discuss the name
of your employer nor your destination with any other person.<br>
<br>
Please reply to this letter in person. The doctor is expecting
you.<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
<br>
R. Austin Linton (Secretary).</p>

<p>A sudden noise recalled him. The door at the end of the carriage
was flung open and a guard entered, rolling his body to the lurch
of the train. He was a middle-aged man with a stolid, pleasant
face. He paused near the solitary traveller.</p>

<p>"Getting near Greycliffe prison now, sir. Thought you might like
to take a look." As though excusing his uninvited approach, he
added: "Most folks do, travelling on this line, you know."</p>

<p>Von Rasch nodded.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. He spoke slowly, choosing his words with
care. Their guttural accent betrayed his nationality, so that the
official glanced at him curiously.</p>

<p>"That's where the chap escaped from a week ago," he volunteered.
"Warders and dogs been hunting the place for days now&mdash;stopped
the train once, they did, for a search. Guess they'll never find
him now. He's probably fallen into one of those gullies and broken
his neck&mdash;sure as sin!"</p>

<p>Von Rasch had heard about the queer volcanic formation of this
country; of the hollow earth that opened beneath the feet and the
depthless caverns with their wells of green and stagnant water. He
averted his head. "That is horrible."</p>

<p>The guard ran his tongue along the gum of a cigarette-paper.
"Horrible's right." He spat out a wisp of tobacco. "But then, this
chap was a horrible one himself. Oscar Dowling, the Golganna
murderer. You remember him&mdash;no? Well, he murdered his wife and
three children&mdash;chopped off their hands. Mad, he was&mdash;mad
's a hatter! That's why he got life instead of the noose. But I
guess he's dead now all right."</p>

<p>"I cannot remember the case," von Rasch replied shortly. "I do
not read newspapers."</p>

<p>The guard lit his cigarette and tossed away the match. He seemed
glad to impart the information. "Strange case, it was. Made a lot
of talk at the time. This Dowling was a well-educated man&mdash;one
of those chaps who write books and things. Loving husband and
father, the newspapers said. All at once he went off his
head&mdash;phut." He clicked his fingers in the air. "Just like
that! Been working too hard, doctors said. Anyhow, when he came
round again, he knew nothing of what he'd done. In the court he
swore they were sentencing an innocent man, said someone else was
responsible for the murders! Then he went off again. They locked
him in a madhouse for three months, then shifted him down here.
When he was sane they set him to work in the cook-house. That's how
he came to escape. Cunning, you see&mdash;cunning." The guard
nodded to himself. "That's how they all are. But I guess he's gone
for keeps now&mdash;and the best thing that could happen, I
say!"</p>

<p>He paused in his gloomy recital and leaned closer to the window.
Then he straightened and turned back. "You're for Henbane station,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"That is right."</p>

<p>"Well, it's the next stop." Reluctantly the guard pinched out
his half-smoked cigarette and pocketed it. "Better get ready. We
don't stop more than a minute or so." With a nod he moved out of
the carriage and vanished with the slamming of a door.</p>

<p>Von Rasch rose to his feet and began to fold the rug. Reaching
up, he took the suit-case from the wire rack overhead and, thus
laden, began to sway down the corridor, and out onto a vacant
platform.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Ten minutes passed before a sudden commotion aroused him. He
jumped to his feet as a man walked into the station and halted a
few paces away from him. Von Rasch had a swift impression of a
huge, swarthy giant, bearded to the eyes, his great form wrapped
from throat to ankles in an old-fashioned Burberry overcoat
buttoned about his throat. A slouch hat was pulled low on his
forehead. The new-comer stared at the young man for a moment, then
asked gruffly:</p>

<p>"Mr. von Rasch?" He barely moved his lips as he spoke.</p>

<p>The young man replied quietly: "That is my name."</p>

<p>Without another word the big man bent and lifted the heavy
suit-case as though it were a child's school-bag, then turned and
walked out of the station. As the other made no move to follow, he
turned and flung the words over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"This way. Carriage's waiting."</p>

<p>It was a small rubber-tyred sulky that waited a few paces away,
drawn by a plump mare who fogged the chilling air with her
breath.</p>

<p>With a nod he placed one foot on the step and sprang into the
seat. With a grunt the big man was by his side, and the next minute
they were spanking along the grassy bank leading to the road.</p>

<p>They must have been driving for close on half an hour when von
Rasch saw a dark grove of trees some distance ahead. From the
tangle of foliage, he could make out something like a squat tower
pushing its way, reminding him of a deserted lighthouse in a dark
and waveless sea. As they approached along the gently sloping road,
he picked out the dim lines of pointed gables and steep roofs, and
began to wonder if this house, guarded by the whispering army of
trees, was his destination. He was not left long in doubt. The
sulky purred on its way and ten minutes later turned in between the
high stone pillars of the entrance gate.</p>

<p>The drive was to short that the house seemed almost to leap out
from the trees to confront them. Von Rasch had a confused
impression of outbuildings lost in obscurity, of arched doorways
and twisted chimneys grotesque against the star-spangled sky. The
sulky pulled up so abruptly that the mare's hoofs pawed the ground.
The driver, lopping the reins about the whip socket, jumped out and
nodded to his companion to follow. He gestured in the direction of
the house.</p>

<p>"This way," he said briefly.</p>

<p>The young man had naturally assumed that they would enter
through the front of the house. But he was mistaken. The servant
led the way past massive pillars and a creeper-covered verandah to
the side of the building. Here he pushed open a door with his foot
and told his companion to enter. In the darkness they groped along
a narrow corridor. The guide opened another door, and a flood of
light illuminated the corridor.</p>

<p>"Wait in there," the bearded man muttered. Von Rasch heard him
moving away, and a slam of a door announced his departure. He moved
forward into the room and looked around.</p>

<p>It was apparently the library, this wide room with the four
walls lined from floor to ceiling with books. The reds and golds of
the bindings winked in the light of an old-fashioned oil-lamp
hanging on chains from the ceiling. What little furnishings the
room contained were artistic rather than utilitarian. A marble bust
of a saturnine Dante sneered from a mahogany cabinet; there were
several imitation tapestries stretched on screens here and there,
and a barbaric note was struck by the presence of a many-armed
Hindu idol raising pious almond eyes in one corner of the room. Von
Rasch was about to examine this close, when the servant
entered.</p>

<p>"Dr. Meyersen will see you," he said. "Come along."</p>

<p>Again they trod the dark corridors that wound so endlessly that
the young man lost all sense of direction. At length they paused
before a heavy door. The servant knocked sharply, favoured his
companion with a curt nod, and moved off. From within came the
harsh scrape of a chair thrust back, and footsteps approached. It
was flung open and the young man had his first glimpse of Dr.
Bernhardt Meyersen.</p>

<p>His first impression was a pair of deep-set eyes in a face of
astonishing pallor, a pallor accentuated by the wild aureole of
white hair. The eyes swept him from head to foot as he stood there
staring at this man who was to be his employer. The silence became
almost embarrassing, and the young man spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Herr Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The voice was as thin and as sharp as the face.</p>

<p>"I am Hans von Rasch."</p>

<p>"So?" The eyes narrowed, focused on the other's face. "You are
very young. How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-three, Herr Doctor. I understood you knew that from my
letter."</p>

<p>There was no reply. Von Rasch dropped his eyes under this
penetrating scrutiny. He was aware that the doctor had stepped
aside to allow him to pass. "Come inside," he said.</p>

<p>The room into which they moved was almost Spartan in its
severity; he noticed that the floor was of bare, unpolished boards
and the furniture heavy and cheap. Near the centre stood a table
covered with papers, and above this a hanging oil-lamp spread a
yellow tent of light cutting sharply downward and leaving the rest
of the room in half-shadow. High in the wall was the outline of a
small window, protected by iron bars.</p>

<p>The doctor followed him inside and, pausing by the table, pulled
up a chair. "Sit down, Herr von Rasch," he invited, and when the
other had obeyed he leaned against the table, folded his arms, and
stared down at him. He spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"You have adhered rigidly to the terms of my letter&mdash;told
nobody of your destination or the name of your employer?"</p>

<p>"I have told no one, Herr Doctor."</p>

<p>"You are not married, nor have you family responsibilities of
any kind which bind you to the outside world?"</p>

<p>Von Rasch said simply: "I am quite alone in the world, sir."</p>

<p>Dr. Meyersen nodded and pulled forward a chair. "That is good,"
he announced. "Now listen carefully, my boy. I want you to
understand exactly what is required of you."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>Bertha Fenton pushed open the door of her tiny room on the
"Weekly Informer" and, moving inside, dropped into a woven-cane
chair near the table. For a while she sat limply, yielding to the
pleasure of complete relaxation. The mirror on the opposite wall
threw back her reflection&mdash;a dumpy, untidily dressed,
middle-aged woman with sharp, almost cunning features centring
about an arrogant beak of a nose. With her mousy hair drawn back
and cut as short as a man's, Bertha Fenton looked every day her
forty-three years.</p>

<p>A knock on the door aroused her. She peered through the grey
haze of tobacco-smoke at the copy-boy who stood in the entrance. He
pushed a sleek, pomaded head into the room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Armitage wants you, Miss Fenton."</p>

<p>Bertha made her way into the news editor's room and crossed to
his desk.</p>

<p>Herbert Armitage, a prematurely bald young man wearing
thick-lensed spectacles, leaned back in his swivel chair and waved
a slip of paper. "Carstairs, nosing round the detective office this
morning, ran across a pretty definite rumour that Judge Sheldon had
been murdered&mdash;"</p>

<p>The woman sat up, her indifference dropping like a garment. "Not
Sheldon, the K.C.M.G. of Spring Street?"</p>

<p>Armitage nodded; "The same man. It's a wonderful story&mdash;if
it's genuine."</p>

<p>"There's just a chance that the dailies may not get on to it
until late this afternoon," he said. "There's only one thing for
you to do, Bertha. Get around there and bluff your way inside
somehow. Keep your eyes open and don't let a word out to those
daily scroungers."</p>

<p>In the office of the "Informer" Bertha Fenton stood out as an
individual, unique almost. But the moment she set foot in the
street the great moving throng swallowed her, and her
eccentricities were lost in the bewildering kaleidoscope of colour
and motion that packed the pavements and overflowed on to the
streets.</p>

<p>Carnavon Chambers was a new block of apartments built at the top
end of Spring Street. A policeman stood waiting under the striped
canvas awning that decorated the entrance. He knew Bertha, and
grinned as she approached. "You're the fourth," he told her. "Talk
about vultures around a corpse."</p>

<p>The woman halted, standing with feet apart. "Don't be so damned
crude, Thomas," she admonished. "Three here, you say? Who are the
others?"</p>

<p>"Wilkinson from the 'Courier,' another new chap from the
Associated Press&mdash;don't know his name&mdash;and that
fair-haired mother's boy from the 'Globe.' Lascelles, isn't it?"
Constable Graves eyed her closely. "How'd you come to get in on
this, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"That well-known little bird," Bertha told him airily. She
shrugged her shoulders and spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Who's looking around for the Department?"</p>

<p>Graves considered a moment. "Four of them. Burford, the Coroner
Doc Conroy, O'Connor the plain-clothes man, and the fingerprint
boys."</p>

<p>"And who's in charge?"</p>

<p>"Denis O'Connor temporarily. They're waiting for Chief Inspector
Read."</p>

<p>Bertha pursed her lips. "So-o&mdash;? It's that big, is it? The
Chief Inspector himself?"</p>

<p>The constable nodded portentously. "In the flesh," he added
impressively.</p>

<p>"Then I'm going up," Miss Fenton said abruptly</p>

<p>Like a bird zooming for cover, the elevator soared upward.</p>

<p>The steel cage slid to a stop, and Bertha, stepping out, found
herself in a long, brown-panelled corridor. A few paces away from
the lift-shaft, a narrow, circular staircase wound downwards.
Outside an opening half-way down the corridor two uniformed
policemen stood. They watched her suspiciously as she approached,
and one, after a whispered conference with his companion, began to
walk toward her. Bertha cursed under her breath. If they were going
to be officious...</p>

<p>"You're not allowed along here, madam," the policeman told her
brusquely. Six feet of blue uniform blocked her way so that she was
forced to halt. Bertha stiffened. She fumbled in her bag and
produced a tiny leather-and-cardboard square.</p>

<p>"I'm from the 'Weekly Informer,'" she said curtly. "Here's my
Press pass."</p>

<p>The constable did not even glance at it. Neither did he move. "I
don't care who you are or where you're from," he returned. "You
can't come along here."</p>

<p>The woman checked the hot retort that rose to her lips. She
realized that it would be foolish to quarrel with these officials
at such a time. Producing a card and pencil, she scribbled a few
hasty lines and handed the card to the constable.</p>

<p>"Would you mind taking that inside to Mr. O'Connor?" she said,
trying to keep the harshness out of her voice.</p>

<p>Miss Fenton waited impatiently, a square-toed shoe drumming the
carpet. So! They were trying to keep the Press out of this thing.
Wilkinson, Lascelles, and the A.P. man must have got in with the
first alarm at headquarters before the police realized the
seriousness of the business. They had apparently given orders that
all other reporters were to be refused admission. What luck that
she happened to know Denis O'Connor! Because, the more dailies
excluded from this murder, the more chance for the "Weekly
Informer."</p>

<p>The constable returned and was beckoning to her. Bertha allowed
herself a sniff, eloquent of the contempt she felt for this
underling. Tossing her head, she strode past like a triumphant
Amazon.</p>

<p>She was standing in what was apparently a bedroom, a small
apartment made to appear larger by the skilful arrangement of the
furnishings. Her eyes made a swift survey, took in the low bed,
covered with scarlet satin eiderdown, the built-in cupboard and
wardrobe, the inlaid table near the bed with its pipe and
tobacco-jar, and the small bookcase standing in the far corner. On
the opposite side of the room, a door leading to a larger apartment
had been torn from its hinges and lay askew, portions of the
shattered woodwork splintering about the lock. Bertha was staring
at this ruin when it was pushed aside and O'Connor, a thick-set
giant of a man with curly hair surmounting a good-natured
moon-face, came out. He glanced at her and nodded.</p>

<p>"It certainly never pays to ask a presswoman a favour," he
complained. "Sooner or later they'll ask for it back a
hundredfold." But the twinkle in his blue eyes belied the tone.</p>

<p>Bertha Fenton grinned and took his hand in a grip firm as a
man's. "You know these men, of course?" O'Connor was saying.</p>

<p>The woman nodded and glanced around, exchanging greetings. She
recognized the stocky, dapper man with a dark moustache as Dyke
Wilkinson, while the tall blond boy standing by the bed was Gilbert
Lascelles of the "Globe." The third man had her puzzled for a
moment, although she remembered having seen those pleasant, regular
features photographed in a trade paper. Then the young man himself
came forward, hand outstretched.</p>

<p>"Miss Fenton, isn't it?" he said. "My name is Yates&mdash;Martin
Yates. I'm the new man on the Associated Press. Took Ken Hubbard's
place about a month ago."</p>

<p>The detective spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"It's a bad business, Miss Fenton. We can't hope to hush it up,
but we don't want a line more publicity than we can help.
Especially at this early stage. In fact, they're getting the new
Chief Inspector on the job&mdash;the big chief from London. The
Coroner and the medical examiner are inside now, with Larsen, the
finger-print man. I'll take you inside as soon as they're through.
But you must promise to publish nothing save what we&mdash;the
Chief, that is&mdash;actually gives you."</p>

<p>"Does that go for the others?" the woman demanded.</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Then it suits me." Bertha tossed her bag and hat on the bed and
sat down. "Now, what's it all about?"</p>

<p>O'Connor thrust his hands in his pockets. "There's not much we
actually know," he said. "Briefly, it amounts to this. Judge
Sheldon who has been renting this apartment for about two years,
came out of that inner room about seven o'clock last night. He told
his man, Hoskins, to take the evening off. The servant watched him
return to that apartment, lock himself in, and cross to his desk.
Then Hoskins went to his own room (which is farther down the
corridor), dressed, and left the building, to return about eleven
o'clock and go straight to bed. He says he rose about seven o'clock
this morning, came in here, and discovered his master's bed had not
been slept in. Crossing to the door of the inner room, he found it
still locked, so he knocked. There was no answer. Believing that
the judge must have spent the night away, he did not worry until
about nine-fifteen, when something happened that aroused his
fears."</p>

<p>Bertha, following this recital closely, looked up. "What was
that?"</p>

<p>"At that time, the telephone-girl in the desk downstairs came to
Hoskins and asked what was the matter with Judge Sheldon's
telephone," O'Connor explained. "She said that the Judge had
forgotten to replace the receiver on the hook, and although she had
rung him several times in the morning he had not answered. This
made Hoskins suspicious. While the manager telephoned police
headquarters, three porters broke in the door of the apartment."
The detective paused for breath. "They found the Judge sitting
behind his desk. He was dead&mdash;stabbed in the back."</p>

<p>Miss Fenton nodded slowly. "I suppose it was murder?" she said
shrewdly.</p>

<p>The detective looked, at her. "Suicide?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"It's happened before now," the woman reminded him.</p>

<p>It was Gilbert Lascelles who drawled from his corner: "Not in
this case, Miss Fenton. You see, they can't find the weapon."</p>

<p>Denis O'Connor squared his shoulders like a man tackling an
unpleasant task. "There's more to it than that,", he explained. His
tone was harsh and awkward. "You people haven't seen the body. The
murderer took a souvenir away with him. One of Sheldon's ears is
missing. The right ear&mdash;neatly sliced off his head."</p>

<p>"I'll take you inside now," he announced. "And please remember
to touch nothing. Do you understand&mdash;nothing at all!"</p>

<p>It was a much larger room than the one they had left&mdash;a
long apartment lit by two tall windows in the outer wall. The
massive glass-topped desk before the nearest window, the figured
blackwood cabinet, the deep leather chairs scattered over the
scarlet velvet pile carpet squares&mdash;these things bespoke
dignity and comfort. At the far end of the room an ornamental grate
housed an electric fire, and there were small cabinets and inlaid
tables about the room. The floor, uncovered by the carpet squares,
was highly polished.</p>

<p>Standing near the desk were four men. Burford was engaged in
earnest conversation with Dr. Conroy. Larsen, with his insufflator,
was busy searching the glass top for fingerprints. A young man
standing near a photographic apparatus was watching him. As the
reporters entered, Larsen and his assistant moved across to the
long window behind the desk. Burford and the doctor, still talking,
paced to the cabinet, leaving the desk clear. It was at that moment
that the reporters had their first glimpse of the body of Sir
Merton Tenison Sheldon.</p>

<p>It was propped up in a swivel chair behind the desk, slumping
limply like a bundle of washing tied to give semblance to a human
form. With both hands resting on the desk and the head lolling on
one side, the eyes stared glassily. The pallid face still reflected
the gracious somnolence that had marked the features during life,
but the head was disfigured by a blackish clot of blood where the
right ear had been removed.</p>

<p>As the reporters started to walk toward the desk, the Coroner's
voice sounded authoritatively:</p>

<p>"Don't touch anything, please! And walk on the carpet."</p>

<p>Martin Yates was first to reach the desk, but Miss Fenton was
only a split second behind. They stared at the body. The
single-breasted coat, swinging open, showed the material of the
waistcoat unstained. Bertha turned to the detective.</p>

<p>"Got it in the back, did he?"</p>

<p>O'Connor nodded. "Took him completely by surprise. Accounts,
too, for the lack of expression on his face."</p>

<p>They walked around the desk. Wilkinson moved forward and touched
the stain that smeared raggedly across the back of the coat. "Seems
to have bled very little for a mortal wound," he remarked, his
fingers touching the damp material gingerly.</p>

<p>"That's because of the weapon used," the detective explained.
"Something resembling a long, thin piece of steel, very sharp and
strong. Most of the bleeding would have occurred inwardly,
according to the doctor."</p>

<p>"But why take his ear?" murmured Gilbert Lascelles. And no
person offered an explanation.</p>

<p>Burford came forward again. At a nod from O'Connor, the
reporters withdrew toward the shattered door. Now Larsen was
working on the catch of the long window, and the tall frames stood
wide open. Miss Fenton's eyes rested on that tiny balcony outside,
the balcony overhanging a sheer drop of eighty feet into the street
below.</p>

<p>The reporters crowded together in the doorway. The Coroner and
the detective were bending over the dead man, transferring articles
from his pockets to the desk. Presently they finished the task.
Burford nodded, and O'Connor rejoined the others in the
bedroom.</p>

<p>"Anything new?" Yates said eagerly, as he came in.</p>

<p>The detective nodded, his face shadowed. "We've found the key of
the locked door," he told them.</p>

<p>"Where was it?"</p>

<p>O'Connor eyed them levelly. "It was in the dead man's waistcoat
pocket."</p>

<p>There was a surprised, momentary silence. Then, as the full
realization dawned upon the company:</p>

<p>"How could that be?" Wilkinson demanded. "Do you mean to say
that the door was locked on the inside?"</p>

<p>O'Connor nodded slowly. "That's what it looks like, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>Gilbert Lascelles gave a droll whistle. "Good Lord&mdash;and
those windows look out on to a sheer drop of eighty feet!"</p>

<p>"We're faced with an apparent impossibility," Bertha told, the
room. "Seeing that Sheldon had the key, that door could have been
locked only from the inside. As there are no other known entrances,
it means that the murderer must have locked himself in with the
dead man. And if he did that," said Miss Fenton forcibly, "where
the sweet hell is he now?"</p>

<p>Dyke Wilkinson sniffed. "I once read a story in which a murderer
climbed a sheer wall with suckers on his feet. And, if I remember
rightly, he shot a man through a window. The story was called
'Strawberry Jam.'"</p>

<p>"'Raspberry Jam,'" Gilbert corrected him. "Carolyn Wells wrote
it." He smiled. "Yes, I've read that one also. And now all we have
to do is to examine the entire wall with a magnifying glass,
looking for damp, circular rings the size of an ordinary
breakfast-cup rim." He turned to the detective. "There's your case,
Denis."</p>

<p>O'Connor regarded him unsmilingly. "There won't be any need for
that," he told them. "Nobody came through that way into the room.
Both windows were firmly latched on the inside when we broke down
that door. It was one of the first things we looked at."</p>

<p>He broke off as voices raised in conversation were heard in the
corridor. The next moment four men entered, and Miss Fenton,
watching them as they filed past, named three. The tall,
well-dressed man with the military bearing and the bristling grey
moustache set against his ruddy face was Chief Inspector William
Read. His two companions were plain-clothes detectives&mdash;Steve
Donlin and Jed Armstrong. It was the fourth man she could not
place. He was talking intimately with the Chief Inspector, who had
taken his arm as they passed into the room. Bertha, who prided
herself that she knew all the officials in the Criminal
Investigation Department by their first names, puckered her brows
over this stranger.</p>

<p>He was a man in his middle thirties, clean-shaven, with the face
of a scholar, a face that might have been severe but for a pair of
grey eyes that twinkled humorously. Of medium build, he had that
lean fitness that comes from perfect training, and the broad
shoulders and spare hips emphasized his well-cut, quiet clothes.
One hand was buried in his pocket, the other had its long fingers
clasped about a stick and gloves. At that moment O'Connor came
forward. The Chief Inspector turned, and Bertha heard him say:</p>

<p>"I want you to meet a friend of mine from London&mdash;Mr.
Jeffery Blackburn." The young man smiled, acknowledging the
greeting quietly, and moved away. Read, about to follow him,
appeared to notice the others in the room for the first time. He
frowned and turned back to the detectives. "Who are these people?"
he snapped. "They have no business up here. Who let them in?" He
added quickly: "They haven't touched anything, I hope?"</p>

<p>Detective O'Connor, suddenly sheepish, explained the reporters'
presence.</p>

<p>The peppery Inspector was not to be placated. "Get them out of
here&mdash;at once!" he shouted. He turned and strode into the
inner room, muttering to himself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>Jeffery Blackburn stood in the entrance of the late Judge
Sheldon's apartment. "From higher mathematics to the mathematics of
murder," he murmured.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector William Jamieson Read had been Blackburn
senior's closest friend, and young Jeffery had inherited that
affection to almost the same degree. The only other thing that
threatened to rival his friendship was the young man's love of his
work. As a professor of higher mathematics, Jeffery Blackburn was
destined for a brilliant career. His parents dead, he had few
responsibilities, and every minute that could be spared from his
equals and infinitives was spent in the company of the elder
man.</p>

<p>They were taking coffee together when the news of the Sheldon
death was telephoned from headquarters. Read's suggestion that
Jeffery should coma along had been welcomed by the young man. An
hour later, they were entering the block of flats side by side.</p>

<p>Read walked across to the desk and ran his eye over its
furnishings. In addition to Sheldon's personal belongings, the
glass top supported the usual office fittings&mdash;a clean sheet
of blotter, an automatic calendar in a nickelled frame, a pen-tray
and inkwell, some books between bronze stands, and a deep ashtray
containing fragments of cigarettes. A desk telephone stood near the
edge, but the receiver was hanging at the end of the wire, dangling
almost to the floor. A pipe with a highly polished bowl lay near
the ash-tray.</p>

<p>Read turned away and spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"Donlin! Armstrong!"</p>

<p>The two plain-clothes men stepped forward alertly.</p>

<p>"Search the room. Every inch of it." The Inspector swung around
on the waiting detective. "You've been on the spot all the time,
O'Connor. What's the news up to date?"</p>

<p>Speaking in terse phrases, the plain-clothes man put his
superior in full possession of the facts, beginning with the story
of the manservant, Hoskins, and concluding with the discovery of
the key.</p>

<p>Read pulled him up shortly.</p>

<p>"What pocket?"</p>

<p>"Lower right-hand pocket, sir, in the waistcoat."</p>

<p>"H'm." The Inspector tugged at his moustache. "Where is this man
Hoskins?"</p>

<p>"In his room. He occupies a small apartment about two doors
farther along the corridor."</p>

<p>The Inspector rubbed his hands. His tone was business-like.</p>

<p>"Good! We'll see him as soon as I've had a word with the doctor.
In the meanwhile, stand by in case you're wanted." He dismissed the
detective and turned to where Conroy was staring out of the long
window. "What can you tell me, Doctor?"</p>

<p>Conroy, a fussy little man with a short, pointed beard, walked
across to the desk. "Here's my report, Chief. Death almost
instantaneous. Caused by a thin, strong, steel weapon entering the
back below the shoulder-blades. Weapon pierced the anterior tip of
the heart where the large blood vessels lie. As far as can be
ascertained, without an autopsy, I should say that the point of the
weapon rested somewhere near the sternum bone. Wound neat and
clean-edged, resulting in a certain amount of bleeding, but not
nearly so much as if the wound had been jagged. A bullet-wound, for
instance, would have made an ugly mess." He paused and looked at
his superior. "There's one outstanding point. The direction taken
by the weapon, the strength of the thrust, and the neatness of the
entire business points to some person with a good elementary
knowledge of anatomy." Conroy eyed the Inspector quizzically.
"Anything more?"</p>

<p>"Very comprehensive," Read admitted. "What about the time of the
murder?"</p>

<p>Dr. Conroy frowned, and one hand stroked his beard. "I can't say
definitely without an autopsy," he said brusquely. "But rigor is
well advanced and the wound has closed..." He considered
frowningly. "I should say about twelve hours ago&mdash;say round
about ten o'clock last night. Can't say nearer, at this stage."</p>

<p>Read nodded. "That's near enough. Anything else?"</p>

<p>The doctor took a turn up and down before the desk. Then he took
the Inspector by the arm and walked him around to the rear of the
body. "See that stain on the back? Well, it puzzles me. That weapon
penetrated the large blood-vessels, and although the orifice was
small it should have bled much more freely. That stain's merely a
seepage after the blood clotted and closed the wound." Again he
eyed the body disapprovingly, as though resentful of this illogical
point.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector considered for a moment. "And what about the
ear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" Conroy dismissed it with a gesture. "Another neat
job. Sliced off with a sharp instrument&mdash;probably a surgeon's
scalpel. No mystery there."</p>

<p>"Not from your point of view perhaps," Read muttered. He was
silent for a moment. "The weapon used to incise the ear wasn't the
same as did the stabbing, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Impossible. The two wounds are entirely different. A scalpel
has only one cutting edge. The weapon used for stabbing was
circular, without any cutting edge."</p>

<p>Read frowned. "Queer...queer...he could have quite easily
stabbed with the scalpel, I suppose? Then why the devil didn't
he?"</p>

<p>Conroy allowed himself a prim smile. "That's your job." He
turned away. "That's all the help I can give you at the moment.
I'll tell O'Connor to 'phone the morgue and get this body out of
your way. Then perhaps I'll be able to tell you more." He moved out
of the room, stopping to talk to the detective near the door. The
Inspector, watching, raised his voice.</p>

<p>"When you've done that, O'Connor, we'll see that manservant.
Then the desk-clerk and the rest of the witnesses. Make it snappy,
now." He turned back to Jeffery, who was watching interestedly.
"Take a seat, son. And keep your ears wide open. Don't be afraid to
ask questions. This isn't a murder case&mdash;it's a chapter out of
a detective serial."</p>

<p>If, as Chief Inspector Read had said, this was a chapter from a
detective serial, then Hoskins, who entered the room with O'Connor,
was well cast in the role of sinister servant. Thin,
stoop-shouldered, and dressed in sombre black, there was a certain
funereal atmosphere about him that clashed with the Inspector's
vital personality. He came forward apprehensively and took his
stand opposite Read. In deference to the feelings of the witnesses,
the Inspector had ordered the body behind the desk to be sheeted,
and had Hoskins been face to face with the ghost of his late
master, he could not have looked more ill-at-ease. He stood with
downcast eyes, hands linked together, every now and then passing
his tongue across his pale lips.</p>

<p>"Afraid, eh?" Read barked abruptly.</p>

<p>Hoskins raised his eyes, encountered the sheeted figure, and
lowered them quickly. "No, sir. But a thing like that has never
happened to me before, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be afraid of," Read assured him. "If you've
nothing to hide, that is. What's your full name?"</p>

<p>"Albert Turner Hoskins, sir."</p>

<p>"How long had you been with the Judge?"</p>

<p>"About five years, sir. I came from Sir Trevor Anthony, the
millionaire stockbroker. About five years ago Sir Trevor sailed for
London and broke up his home here. I was unemployed when a friend
of Sir Merton's, who knew of my service, suggested he should take
me on. I have been with the Judge ever since."</p>

<p>"Did you serve him at his home as well?"</p>

<p>Hoskins shook his head. "Not for the past two years, sir. That's
since Sir Merton had this apartment. During that time, he visited
his home very rarely." He raised his pale eyes. "I understand that
Sir Merton and his wife were not&mdash;not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not compatible, eh?" the Chief Inspector rapped. "Well, well!
And what time do you retire at night?"</p>

<p>"Usually about eleven o'clock, sir. Unless, of course, I was
given the evening off. Sometimes I received a summons in the night.
The Judge has a bell-push by his bed connected to my room. If he
wanted anything in the night, he rang for me."</p>

<p>Read eyed him narrowly. "That was rather an imposition, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>The man passed his tongue over his lips before he replied.
"I&mdash;I think Sir Merton was nervous about sleeping alone."</p>

<p>"Ah! Attacks on his life, you mean?"</p>

<p>Hoskins nodded. "Yes, sir. There was that business of the key to
this apartment, sir. Sir Merton insisted on having a special lock
made for the door and retaining the only key. I was never allowed
to enter this room. Sir Merton used to bring his correspondence
into the bedroom and collect it from me when he returned in the
afternoon. He locked this door after him on every occasion, and, as
far as I know, the key was never out of his possession. Once when
Sir Merton was in a confidential mood he showed me the key,
balancing it in his hand. 'There's many a person who'd like to get
hold of this for a few minutes, Hoskins,' he said. 'But they'll
never catch me napping.'"</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded and gestured toward the long windows. "Do
you know if these were always kept latched?"</p>

<p>Hoskins nodded. "Whenever I caught a glimpse of them through the
doorway they were shut, sir. I could not see whether they were
latched."</p>

<p>The Inspector, his face darkened with a frown, paused before his
next question. Then: "What about that bedroom outside? Was the same
guard placed on the key of that room?"</p>

<p>The servant shook an emphatic head. "No, sir. The door was
always left unlocked all night. On occasions when I have answered
Sir Merton's bell I have just walked into the room. And I know the
door was unlocked during the day, since the maid cleans the
room."</p>

<p>Read caressed his moustache. Jeffery, straddled across a chair,
saw that his friend was mulling over the servant's reply, and he
anticipated the Inspector's next question. Read fixed the servile
Hoskins with a keen eye.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it strike you as peculiar, my man, that Judge Sheldon
should have been so particular about the locks on this room&mdash;a
room in which he was constantly on the alert&mdash;yet his bedroom,
where he could have been easily attacked during sleep, was not even
locked during the night?"</p>

<p>A shadow crossed the man's face. But his voice was steady. "I
can't offer any explanation at all, sir. Naturally, the same thing
occurred to me. But it was not my place to ask questions."</p>

<p>"Naturally." Read's tone was suave. "And did the Judge occupy
this room frequently?"</p>

<p>"About three afternoons in every week," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What was the nature of his business?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea, sir." There was cold reproof in the tone. "I
was always busy in my own room."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector accepted the snub calmly. "Of course, the
perfect servant. Did Sir Merton remain in here long?"</p>

<p>"On those afternoons, he would go in about two o'clock and come
out for dinner at seven-thirty."</p>

<p>Again Read paused. He ran his fingers through his greying hair
as if uncertain how to continue. Jeffery was pencilling some lines
on a slip of paper. This he passed to the elder man, who read it
and crumpled the paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"Did the Judge occupy this room yesterday afternoon?" he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>Hoskins, who had noticed Jeffery's action, darted a sudden
suspicious glance in his direction. He looked back at Read and
nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He came in about the usual time. But I noticed a
difference...worried, he seemed, and irritable, as if he had
something on his mind. I heard him tramping backwards and forwards
about this room all the afternoon. There might be a lull of about
five minutes and he would be off again. When he came out at
dinner-time he looked pale and ill. I noticed his hands when he lit
his pipe&mdash;unsteady and trembling, they were. He told me to
take the evening off. I was rather surprised, for I had already
taken my regulation night off."</p>

<p>"Where did you go last night?"</p>

<p>"To a talking-picture, with a friend. I left him outside this
building and came up to my room about eleven thirty."</p>

<p>Read's tone was quiet. "You didn't think to look in the bedroom
and see if your master was all right?"</p>

<p>The servant's face reddened. "It did occur to me. But I was
rather nervous about going into that room in the dark. Sir Merton
was a queer man&mdash;he would not have thought twice about
attacking anyone who came blundering in there unexpected like
that."</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded curtly. "That's all right, my man. Now, as
regards visitors&mdash;did Sir Merton have many women calling on
him?"</p>

<p>Again the shadow crept across the servant's face, and this time
there was definite fear in the expression. He shifted nervously and
his eyes roved from face to face. Jeffery, watching the
danger-signals hoist suddenly in the Inspector's cheeks, sighed for
the man. There were storm-rumblings in Read's voice as he
barked:</p>

<p>"Come on, my man! What's up with you?" Then, as the other
swallowed awkwardly but did not speak, he leapt forward. Taking the
servant's narrow shoulders between his powerful hands, he glared
into the working face.</p>

<p>"You've been paid, is that it? You've been paid to keep your
mouth shut!" The narrowed, steel-blue eyes almost shot sparks at
the hapless Hoskins. "By God, if you don't speak, I'll turn you
over to the boys at Headquarters and they'll get it out of you with
a piece of hose-pipe!" He released the trembling man and stepped
back.</p>

<p>Hoskins washed his hands in agitation. "I'll tell you," he
whimpered dryly. Then, with sudden defiance, he burst out: "Yes.
It's true that I was paid&mdash;that Sir Merton gave me certain
sums of money to keep quiet about these women. They were always
coming to him&mdash;sometimes half a dozen in a week..." His voice
slurred, broke.</p>

<p>"And did they occupy this room with the Judge on
his&mdash;er&mdash;afternoons at home?"</p>

<p>"No, sir." The reply came so quickly that the words almost
tumbled on each other. "Sir Merton never kept them in this room
longer than a few minutes. Some came at night, sir, but they never
stayed long in his company."</p>

<p>Read smiled fiercely, his moustache bristling. "Ha! Guessed we'd
find a love-nest if we probed deeply enough!"</p>

<p>The Inspector considered for a moment. "You knew Lady Sheldon
and her daughter, of course. Did either visit the Judge while he
lived here?"</p>

<p>The man raised his eyes. "Miss Sheldon came very infrequently,
sir. Lady Sheldon never."</p>

<p>"And in your handling of Sir Merton's correspondence, did you
ever run across anything that suggested an attack on his
life...threatening or anonymous letters or anything of that
nature?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever, sir."</p>

<p>"And you have nothing to add to the story you told O'Connor
about your finding of the body?"</p>

<p>Again the man shook his head. He seemed anxious for the
termination of the interview. Read measured him with a calculating
stare for some moments. At length, he nodded.</p>

<p>"That's all, Hoskins. You may go now. You'll be wanted for the
inquest, of course, as you found the body. You'd better wait in
your room in case we want you again."</p>

<p>Thankfully, the servant turned to go. He had reached the door
when Jeffery spoke quietly from his chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hoskins!" As the man wheeled about: "Did Judge Sheldon know
that you were dismissed from the service of Sir Trevor Anthony for
attempted blackmail?"</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as though the servant would drop where he
stood. The colour drained from his narrow face, leaving it deathly
in its pallor. One hand sought the shattered door to steady
himself. He glanced quickly about him like a trapped animal, and
when his eyes came to rest on the young man, hatred burned beneath
their heavy lids. He spoke with an effort.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, sir. He knew about it. I..." He turned and
almost ran from the room. There was a silence while they watched
him go. Read glanced at Jeffery and traces of a smile hovered about
the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"A reminiscence of your Court days, son?" he asked. As Jeffery
nodded: "That's close on four fears ago, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I never forget a face," the younger man returned. He eyed the
servant's trail speculatively. "I shouldn't have brought that
business up again perhaps, but it was a particularly nasty piece of
work. Just about finished Sir Trevor's daughter's life, you know.
That was the reason for the millionaire's sudden flight from
Australia. And friend Hoskins was responsible for it all." He broke
off as O'Connor signalled from the door.</p>

<p>"The boys are here to collect the body, sir," he called, and in
response to Read's nod, two young men entered with a stretcher and
proceeded to load it with their gruesome burden. The Inspector did
not speak until they were out of the room. Then he gave an order to
the plain-clothes man.</p>

<p>"Send in that desk-clerk from the other room. Hennessy brought
her up ten minutes ago." He crossed to the desk and took up a sheet
of paper, glancing at it. "Miss Mary Meynell."</p>

<p>Miss Meynell, when she appeared, was a tall, dark-haired girl
with a firm, business-like mouth. She answered the questions put to
her intelligently and with the crisp readiness of one long
experienced in the business of inquiries. She stood opposite the
Chief Inspector, returning his truculent, stare with level eyes.
The grim lines about Read's mouth relaxed and his tone softened as
he asked:</p>

<p>"What time did you come on duty last night, Miss Meynell?"</p>

<p>"Six o'clock," the girl replied promptly. "I finished my
eight-hour shift at two o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector glanced at Jeffery with a look that said
plainly: "There's something for your higher mathematics," then
faced the girl. "I understand you have something to tell us about a
visitor&mdash;who called to see Judge Sheldon last night." He
pushed forward a chair. "Please sit down, Miss Meynell. And tell us
everything, no matter how insignificant or trifling it may appear
to you."</p>

<p>The desk-clerk thanked him. Seating herself, with her hands
folded loosely in her lap, she began:</p>

<p>"It was a few minutes after nine o'clock last night. I remember
the exact time, because at the nine hour I put my wrist-watch right
by the clock in the foyer. Sir Merton entered from the street with
another man. He came over to the desk to inquire for mail, leaving
his companion standing some distance away. But it was this man's
appearance that attracted my attention. He
looked&mdash;well&mdash;rather queer."</p>

<p>"Queer?"</p>

<p>Miss Meynell wrinkled her forehead, and her words came slower.
"Yes. It's hard actually to describe how&mdash;unless it was the
full beard and moustache that the man wore. It's unusual to see a
man wearing such an extravagant beard and moustache these
days."</p>

<p>Read considered for a moment. "You weren't, of course, close
enough to see if the beard was natural?"</p>

<p>The girl hesitated. "Well&mdash;it looked as natural as any full
beard ever looks," she said with a slow smile. Then she sobered and
continued crisply. "However, there were no letters for Sir Merton.
As he moved away I heard him say to the bearded man, 'What is it
you want?' and the man replied, 'If I could see you alone, I won't
keep you more than a few seconds. But it's a matter of utmost
importance.' Then they passed on out of earshot, walking toward the
elevator. That was the last I saw of either man."</p>

<p>"You heard this bearded man say that he would keep the Judge
only a few seconds?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Yet, although you were on duty until two o'clock in the
morning, you did not see this man come downstairs again?"</p>

<p>Miss Meynell shifted in her seat. "I didn't see him," she
admitted.. "But that's not to say that he didn't come downstairs.
Round about ten o'clock, we get busy at the desk&mdash;we serve
after-theatre suppers, and people start booking by telephone about
that time. I may have been busy on the wire when he came down." She
paused and added: "However, if he came down by the elevator, the
boy would know."</p>

<p>"Good!" Read rubbed his hands briskly. "Could we speak to that
boy now?"</p>

<p>The clerk nodded and rose to her feet. "It was young Tommy
Mallory&mdash;he's off shift and we'll probably find him in the
basement. I'll send him up straight away."</p>

<p>Jeffery gave an apologetic shrug of his shoulders. He seemed
rather uncertain how to continue. He was engaged in framing an
opening sentence, when there came the sound of footsteps outside.
Then O'Connor announced that a Tommy Mallory was waiting to see the
Inspector.</p>

<p>Tommy Mallory, when he entered, was a young man about sixteen
years of age. A pill-box hat was perched askew on his
close-cropped, fiery hair and he had a snub nose set amid scattered
freckles. The Chief Inspector surveyed him.</p>

<p>"You're Thomas Mallory?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You were on duty last night about nine o'clock, I believe? Do
you remember the man who came in with Sir Merton Sheldon&mdash;a
man with a curling black beard?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded, and his eyes gleamed intelligently. "Yes, sir.
Funny-looking chap."</p>

<p>Read said slowly: "Now&mdash;think carefully, Thomas. Do you
remember taking this same person down in your lift last night?"</p>

<p>Without hesitation the lad replied: "I didn't take him down. He
walked downstairs."</p>

<p>"Ah! What time was this?"</p>

<p>"Must have been close on twenty past nine, sir."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector and Jeffery exchanged the briefest of nods.
Then Read asked: "You actually saw him on the stairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It was like this. I was standing outside my car last
night when a party of young chaps came in. I think they'd been
celebrating, sir, 'cause one was a bit funny. The others were
trying to get him across the floor to my car. The clock inside was
just sixteen minutes past nine. At that moment, the bell in my car
buzzed and I saw it was a party on the eighth floor ringing. I
thought it would probably be the chap with the beard, sir&mdash;but
I didn't know what to do&mdash;whether to wait for the young chaps
or go up to answer the buzz. At last the chaps got their friend
inside. All the time the chap on the eighth floor was buzzing away
and I thought how mad he'd be."</p>

<p>Young Mallory paused for breath. When he continued, the veneer
of the Carnavon management began to slip away in his
excitement.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, they put the tight chap off at th' fif' floor, and
that took quite a time. It must have been about four minutes before
I got up t' the eighth. When I got there an' pulled up, there was
no party. I opened the door on the car an' there he was, sir, just
starting to walk downstairs. 'Lift waiting,' I called to him. He
looked round but didn't stop. 'Go to hell,' he says. 'I've been
waiting for your lift for five minutes an' now I'll walk
downstairs!' Mad, he was, sir. An' he went round the bend in the
stairs an' that's the last I saw of him. A party on the tenth gave
me a buzz an' I shot up t' answer that."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Thomas," said the Chief Inspector. "That's all for
the time."</p>

<p>The boy nodded, grinned, and scuttled from the room.</p>

<p>Read looked across at Jeffery.</p>

<p>But the younger man's face reflected no satisfaction. "We're
merely back where we started," he mused. "Sheldon's movements from
nine o'clock until nine-thirty are accounted for&mdash;but what
happened between that time and ten o'clock?"</p>

<p>Read was about to speak, when a sudden commotion in the outer
room interrupted him. The next moment a young woman burst
in&mdash;a tall, dark-haired girl, severely but expensively
dressed. She stood in the broken doorway and glanced about with
complete self-possession.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector spoke sharply. "What are you doing in here,
young woman? You have no right to come pushing your way into this
room."</p>

<p>With calm confidence the girl walked forward and halted opposite
him. "I believe I have quite as much right in here as you have,"
she said coolly. "After all, this is still Sir Merton's apartment."
A cold smile hovered about her lips. "Allow me to introduce myself,
gentlemen. I am Valerie Sheldon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>Jeffery Blackburn sat up and stared at the newcomer with sudden
interest. So this was Val Sheldon, the twenty-five-year-old
daughter of Sir Merton. He knew her age, as every person who read
the newspapers knew it. Valerie Sheldon, despite her tender years,
had already begun to make a name for herself with her brilliant
detective novels, and critics promised a golden future for this
young writer.</p>

<p>She was no bespectacled blue-stocking. Youth and freshness
marked her clever, rather disdainful face. As she stood there, the
young man found himself wondering just what it was that marred the
attractiveness of her features. Perhaps it was the mouth, with its
sullen droop. Perhaps her face was too austere, too sharply etched
for beauty. There were no traces of grief on the chiselled
features, only an expression of repressed excitement. The eyes, too
darted quickly about the room. It was scarcely the face of an only
child, who had lest her father. Read wondered at this also. He
spoke gravely:</p>

<p>"This is a sad occasion for you, Miss Sheldon. The sudden death
of your father must have come as a severe shock."</p>

<p>The girl, sitting with crossed knees, was occupied in the
business of lighting a cigarette. She struck a match and, while it
burned, raised her eyes and stared at the speaker steadily. Then
she lit the cigarette, dropped the match on the carpet, and blew
out a thin plume of smoke. "Let's get this business straight," she
said. Her dark eyes never left the Inspector's face. Her voice was
level. "This murder doesn't mean a thing in my life. I'm not going
about shedding crocodile-tears over an occurrence that doesn't even
stir me. Call it callous if you please&mdash;but Sir Merton
probably got just what he deserved." She paused, shrugged her
shoulders, and drew on her cigarette. "And he wasn't my father,"
she added slowly. "Sir Merton was my step-father."</p>

<p>"Your stepfather? Then Lady Sheldon&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "Mother was, obviously, married twice. I was
the child of her first husband. He enlisted with the first batch of
men to go to France, and he was reported killed&mdash;although I
feel sure that there was some mistake in that report. However, that
doesn't concern us at this time." Her voice was grave,
matter-of-fact, flowed on without variation. "After his death,
Mother, who is one of the sweetest souls on this green earth, threw
herself into Red Cross work. In that way, she met my stepfather,
and they were married. I called myself Val Sheldon and let it be
thought that I was Sir Merton's daughter because&mdash;well,
frankly, it was a social advantage to be known as the daughter of a
knight. And nobody, with the exception of Mother's personal friends
and relatives, knew the truth." She paused to flick the ash from
her cigarette.</p>

<p>"The marriage was a mistake from the start. My stepfather just
didn't believe in monogamy&mdash;three, four, or even five weren't
a crowd for him, so long as they were pretty and attractive. Mother
discovered all manner of shady intrigues that almost broke her
heart. She wouldn't divorce Sir Merton&mdash;had some quaint idea
about the honour of the family, I believe. So it just went on,
getting worse and worse. Then my stepfather took to secret vices,
and that was the finish! I had disliked him intensely up to that
point. From then onward I loathed the sight of him. After Mother
had found about his unfaithfulness, he made no effort to hide it;
indeed, he rather flaunted it in Mother's face. About two years
ago, he took this apartment, and we at home saw less and less of
him, thank heaven! He came down for an occasional week-end for the
sake of appearances&mdash;but that was all. I visited him here when
I wanted money matters arranged. And, except for these occasions,
we tried to forget that he ever existed." She broke off with a
crooked smile. "So you can scarcely expect me to shed copious tears
at his passing, can you?"</p>

<p>"You know, gentlemen, I often believe there is too much fuss
made about murder, especially the murder of a man like my
stepfather. After all, human life is just about the cheapest thing
in the world, and it has always puzzled me why the violent death of
one insignificant individual should make such a difference." She
had been studying the tip of her cigarette. Now she looked up. Her
face was grave, "Wasn't it Oscar Wilde who pointed out that the
meanest scullery-maid and the most loutish of ploughboys could
manufacture human life between them? Even congenital idiots are
capable of it."</p>

<p>"Where is all this leading us?" Read asked brusquely.</p>

<p>"Only to the fact that the means do not seem sufficient to the
end," Miss Sheldon said calmly. "If a person steals a rare painting
or a valuable piece of pottery, even the plans of an
invention&mdash;by which I mean anything created, anything that
could only be achieved by one brain out of tens of
thousands&mdash;then that person should assuredly be punished. For
that person has taken away something that may never be replaced.
But to punish a person for taking the cheapest and most easily
replaced of all things&mdash;human life&mdash;seems to me as
ridiculous as punishing a person who crushes a spider on the
floor."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector eyed her grimly. "Fortunately, Miss Sheldon,
the vast majority reject such an advanced point of view. An eye for
an eye, the Scripture says. Here a man has been murdered and,
regardless of the character of that man, the law says that the
murderer shall pay forfeit with his life."</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"According to what I've heard," she said coolly, "it's a most
original murder. One of those locked-room enigmas, isn't it? All
the doors and windows bolted on the inside and not a single clue
left. Just like the plot from the latest novel..." She paused
abruptly.</p>

<p>Read leapt on her words. "Rather the kind of plot you would
plan, eh, young lady?"</p>

<p>Jeffery watched the dark eyes open and the brows rise
arrogantly. "I don't understand you," she said coldly. "Are you
accusing me of the murder of my stepfather?"</p>

<p>The Inspector grunted. Blackburn interposed gently: "Don't you
realize that you've done everything in your power to make us
believe that?"</p>

<p>Val Sheldon looked at him. Anger and amusement struggled for
expression on her face. "Listen to me," she said at length. "The
constable who rang my home this morning told Mother that Sir Merton
had met with an accident last night. The detective in the other
room told me that my stepfather had met his death at ten o'clock."
She paused to give impressiveness to her words.</p>

<p>"At a quarter to ten last night I was speaking to my stepfather
on the telephone from our house at Toorak."</p>

<p>The Inspector took a step forward. "You actually talked to him
at that time?"</p>

<p>Miss Sheldon inclined her head. "That was what I said."</p>

<p>Jeffery moved from his chair and crossed to where Read was
standing by the desk. He asked gently: "If you were barely on
speaking terms with your stepfather, as you would have us
believe&mdash;why did you ring him at that late hour?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain that without telling you the whole incident,"
the girl replied. She sat back in her chair and fingered her
driving-gloves. "Last night Mother was giving a bridge-party. About
half-way through the evening, as I happened to be dummy, I got up
to look for some cigarettes. Just as I stepped into the hall, the
telephone rang. Elsie, our maid, answered it, and told me that the
call was for my stepfather. Mother was deep in her game&mdash;I
didn't want to disturb her, so I told Elsie I would speak."</p>

<p>"What time was this?"</p>

<p>"A minute or so before half past nine. I took up the receiver,
and a deep voiced asked, 'Is that Sir Merton?' in answer to my
greeting. I told him (for it sounded like a man) no, and asked who
was speaking. There was a slight hesitation, almost as though the
voice were conferring with somebody. Eventually it replied, 'I'm a
friend of Sir Merton's, and I must get in touch with him at once.'
I suggested that the speaker ring my stepfather's town apartment,
but he replied he had already rung there without raising an answer.
Then suddenly the speaker seemed to lose all control. I could hear
his voice trembling over the wire. 'For God's sake get in touch
with Sir Merton and tell him to keep away from his town apartment
to-night. Or you'll never see him alive again!' Naturally, I was
astounded at such a message. I just stood there open-mouthed.
Before I could think of a suitable reply, there came a click as the
receiver was hung up abruptly. Just as that happened, the clock in
the hall chimed nine-thirty."</p>

<p>Read nodded slowly. "What happened then?"</p>

<p>Val Sheldon gave a shrug. "It rather upset me, that call," she
admitted. "I did not know what to do. If I told Mother, it would
ruin her evening; and, besides, she had enough worry on
stepfather's account already. I considered the matter for some
minutes and then decided to ring up Sir Merton's town apartment. He
must be there. When I did so, the call was answered almost
immediately by my stepfather himself. He was surprised at my
ringing him, naturally."</p>

<p>"You were sure it was Sir Merton's voice answered you?" Jeffery
asked.</p>

<p>"Positive!" Miss Sheldon's lips twisted. "I've heard it raised
against me often enough. Shortly, I told him of the message. He
took it with a sneering chuckle. 'I don't see why you should take
the trouble to do this, my dear, when you'd be perfectly happy to
see me dead.' I told him that it was for Mother's sake. He chuckled
again. 'Such touching thoughtfulness. But I've managed to struggle
along these past two years without your felicitations, and I'll
continue to do so.' With that, he hung up. Pleasant kind of parent,
you see. I replaced the receiver and then the clock struck
nine-forty-five. Mother was calling me from the drawing-room to
come and continue my game."</p>

<p>Blackburn put a question when she paused. "When your stepfather
spoke to you, Miss Sheldon, could you say if he was alone in his
apartment?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "I was only speaking to him for a few
seconds. It never occurred to me to listen for any other
voices."</p>

<p>There was a silence in the room. A sharp exclamation broke the
hush, It came from the direction of the blackwood cabinet&mdash;a
massive piece of furniture with drawers fitted on either side of a
centre door. One of these drawers was standing open, and the two
plain-clothes men were bending over it, their eyes focused on
something that lay inside.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Read barked sharply.</p>

<p>Donlin turned toward him. "Let's have those tweezers, Chief.
There's something in here that's going to interest you."</p>

<p>Without a word, the Inspector crossed to the cabinet, passing
the tweezers to the detective. Blackburn did not move, nor did Val
Sheldon, but their eyes followed every gesture. They watched Donlin
manipulating the tweezers, attempting to grasp something that lay
inside the drawer. After three attempts he lifted out the object,
and, carrying it carefully, laid it on the desk. They craned
forward and, as the detective stepped back, had their first
glimpse.</p>

<p>It was a long, slender steel spike, one end sharpened to a
needle-point and the other sunk in a small leaden base a trifle
larger than a matchbox. The upper portion of this thin spike was
stained a faded, reddish brown...</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Read, his arms folded, surveyed the object with
narrowed eyes. He wheeled on Jeffery. "So that's the weapon. It's a
paper-file, isn't it?"</p>

<p>No one answered. Then Val Sheldon rose to her feet and moved
across to the desk, her eyes on the grim exhibit. She nodded
quietly.</p>

<p>"It's certainly a paper-file," she told them. "But I can place
it nearer home than that. For some months I was doing casual
reporting work for the 'Courier,' and I saw dozens of files
identical with this one." She raised her dark eyes to meet the
Inspector's keen scrutiny. "Every reporter on that paper keeps one
on his desk to file his notes upon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>If Valerie Sheldon had expected to cause a sensation with her
statement, she was disappointed. Read merely grunted
non-committally. The plain-clothes men gave the girl a hard stare
and returned to their work of searching the room. It was Jeffery
who put the question:</p>

<p>"Is the 'Courier' the only newspaper using these steel
files?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," was the reply. "Every office must have a few dozen
lying about. They're common enough, heaven only knows."</p>

<p>Blackburn was bending over the weapon, careful not to touch it.
He looked up. "Perhaps you can help us to establish this point," he
said quietly. "If this is the weapon&mdash;as it certainly appears
to be&mdash;could an ordinary outsider, a person not connected with
a newspaper office, obtain one of these files?"</p>

<p>"I should say it would be a fairly simple matter," the girl told
him. She was about to say something further, when she closed her
lips. Jeffery, watching, noticed a thoughtful expression cross her
face. He smiled at her. "You were going to say...?"</p>

<p>Val Sheldon's eyes were grey. She spoke slowly, almost as though
weighing every word.</p>

<p>"I was going to say this," she confessed. "It isn't so much a
question of what manner of person could get possession of a
paper-file, so much as the manner of person who would recognize a
potential weapon in an object of that nature." Her voice dropped a
key. "See what I mean, gentlemen? Probably someone used to impaling
papers..." She was staring at the file with fascinated eyes.</p>

<p>The Inspector crossed over to the cabinet, staring down at the
strip of polished flooring. "He must have stood about here and
tossed the file into the drawer." He was measuring the distance to
the open drawer with his eyes. "If so, why aren't his footprints on
the polished floor?"</p>

<p>With a faint curl of her lips, Miss Sheldon retorted:
"Footprints can't show through carpet."</p>

<p>A flush crept into Read's face at her tone. He said coldly: "It
so happens that there is no carpet in front&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he was interrupted. Val Sheldon gave a sudden ejaculation
and snapped her fingers decisively. Excitement trembled her
tone.</p>

<p>"I knew there was something different about this room from the
moment I stepped into it! But I couldn't think what it was. Now I
know." She crossed to where Read stood staring at her. "See! One of
the squares of carpet has been moved!"</p>

<p>"Moved?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" She was staring at the floor, genuinely excited
over her discovery. She turned with a quick gesture of her hands.
"When my stepfather furnished this room, it was impossible for him
to get a carpet length large enough to cover the entire floor. He
had the floor stained while the management purchased two smaller
squares. When I visited Sir Merton last week&mdash;and on every
time before that&mdash;these squares were placed together in the
centre of the room. This formed one large carpet with a wide border
of stained wood showing on the four sides of the apartment." Again
that quick gesture, this time to the floor. "Now look at them."</p>

<p>There had certainly been an alteration in the carpet. Instead of
the two squares fitting closely edge to edge, the nearer square had
been dragged up against the wall supporting the shattered door.
This square fitted close to the skirting-board, and its new
position left a wide swathe of polished boards down the centre of
the room and in front of the cabinet. The carpet square on the
further side of the room had not, apparently, been touched.</p>

<p>Read was already walking about the moved square, his eyes on the
scarlet pile. Near the heavy desk, he dropped on to his knees, and
Jeffery saw him purse his lips in a silent whistle. Presently he
rose.</p>

<p>"The carpet's been shifted all right," he announced. "You can
see where the desk-legs have impressed into the pile. Whoever moved
those legs must have lifted them one at a time and kicked the
carpet away from under them. Then the rug was dragged from its
position in the centre of the room and over to the left-hand wall."
He paused, one nervous hand tugging his moustache. He seemed
irritated by this discovery. "Now, why in the name of Noah should
anyone go to that trouble?" He swung round on the girl. "You say
that arrangement of this carpet was in order last week?"</p>

<p>"Positively."</p>

<p>"And you have never seen it in this position before?"</p>

<p>Val Sheldon shook her head emphatically. "Never! You see how it
throws the entire room out of proportion? Makes it appear
lop-sided. That was what struck me when I entered, although I never
thought of looking at the floor."</p>

<p>Read turned back to the desk. He bent his knees and, gripping a
corner of the massive woodwork with both hands, put forth all his
strength. The heavy leg jerked clear of the carpet, but the strain
was apparent in the blood that crimsoned the Inspector's face. He
lowered the leg and moved round, glancing ruefully at the ugly red
weals scored across his palms by the desk-edge.</p>

<p>"It took a husky to move that carpet," he admitted. "I'm no
weakling, yet the task of holding that leg up long enough to kick
the square from under it doesn't appeal to me. And, remember, he
had to do the same with both the front legs."</p>

<p>Val Sheldon frowned. "But what's the idea of it?"</p>

<p>Jeffery, hands in pockets, came forward. "Perhaps my
mathematical training may help," he suggested drolly. "You see, one
of the first things we learn concerns Marteen's law of
compensation. That when an article of a given dimension is moved
across a flat plane of a larger area, it must necessarily cover an
area of similar proportions to that which it automatically
reveals." He grinned as the elder man's moustache began to bristle.
"All right&mdash;don't bite me, Chief. In simple language that
strip of carpet has been moved for only one logical reason. To
cover something on the left side of the room that the murderer
wants to hide!"</p>

<p>"It's sense," Read admitted gruffly. "Even though you had to
make a dashed mathematical problem out of it." He broke off to call
to the detectives, who came forward. "I want you to lift that desk
so that the legs clear the carpet," he ordered. "We're going to
drag that strip back into position. Now, you take this corner,
Jeff, and I'll manage the other." He waited while the men took
their place. "Right? Then&mdash;away with her!"</p>

<p>The square of the carpet was jerked suddenly from the wall,
leaving a wide patch of polished boards clear. But those in the
room had eyes for only one portion. They were focused on a smeared
patch that lay directly in front of the shattered door&mdash;a dark
stain which straggled blurred tentacles where the carpet had
dragged across it. The Inspector and Blackburn released the carpet,
while the detectives dropped the desk with a thud that set the
floor trembling. Read spoke briskly, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>"A bloodstain, eh?" There was pleased satisfaction in his tone.
"So that's where the Judge was killed! No wonder Conroy was puzzled
about the paucity of blood on his clothes."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded soberly. Together with the plain-clothes men,
they crossed to the spot and stood looking down at the stain. It
was an irregular patch about eighteen inches square. As the
Inspector came up:</p>

<p>"Here's a find, Chief!" O'Connor announced.</p>

<p>It took but an instant to comprehend the detective's jubilance.
On the outer rim of the stain were the prints of two small shoes,
the narrow toes pointing into the room. A more perfect pair of
prints could not be imagined. Even the worn patches in the soles
were visible. Miss Sheldon gave a soft exclamation that held an
undercurrent of mockery.</p>

<p>"Ah-ah! <i>Cherchez la femme!</i>" And as Read's eyes dropped to
her shoes, she added: "My dear Inspector&mdash;how you flatter me!
Although I have previously blushed to admit it, I am now most
thankful to inform you that I could barely get my toes into those
shoes. They are twos&mdash;or two and a half, at the outside.
Fortunately for my neck"&mdash;she patted it fondly&mdash;"I've
never been able to don less than a five!"</p>

<p>Read did not answer. Jeffery said slowly: "Size two&mdash;or two
and a half."</p>

<p>"And pretty worn," added the girl. She began to pull on her
gloves. "Without appearing too Holmes-ish, may I suggest that you
look for the owner of those shoes in the theatrical world&mdash;a
dancer presumably, and one pretty much down on her luck?" She
nodded to the men. "Will you be wanting me any more,
gentlemen?"</p>

<p>The Inspector stared at her, almost speechless by her cool
insolence.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he barked at length.</p>

<p>The girl turned back a furry driving-glove to reveal a tiny gold
wrist-watch. "It's twelve o'clock," she told them. "I have an
important luncheon appointment with an editor. If I can't help you
further, I'm sure you'll excuse me..." Her voice trailed away
confidently.</p>

<p>Read looked at Jeffery, who shook his head, then back at the
girl. She stood tapping one foot impatiently, but the Inspector was
obviously reluctant to let her go. Yet he could think of no reason
for detaining her. Slowly he nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Sheldon. You may go now. But please understand that
you are not to leave town without first communicating with us." He
turned away. "That is all."</p>

<p>Valerie Sheldon inclined her head, slipped her glove back on her
wrist, and without a word, moved through the shattered door. They
heard her moving about in the other room, picking up her purse and
belongings; then the sound of her footsteps echoed in the silent
corridor.</p>

<p>Inspector Read turned to Jeffery.</p>

<p>"So that's Sheldon's daughter." His tone was not appreciative.
"Self-possessed little puss&mdash;and a bit too casual for my
liking." He stared dawn at the shifted carpet square. "Still, she
gave us some interesting news."</p>

<p>Jeffery's eyes were very thoughtful. A queer smile shadowed his
lips.</p>

<p>"She gave us information on everything save the most important
point," he drawled.</p>

<p>Read glanced up sharply.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, son?"</p>

<p>The young man paused in the act of lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I wonder why Miss Valerie Sheldon really came here this
morning. She is too intelligent to be merely inquisitive; she bore
her stepfather no love, so the visit was not one of sentimental
attachments, and nobody ordered her presence in this room. Yet, of
her own free will, she came here."</p>

<p>"Well...?" Read demanded.</p>

<p>"Why was it?" Jeffery asked. "Did she come here to find just how
much we had discovered&mdash;or was it for some other
reason?&mdash;a reason that would help us far more than all the
other evidence that she so willingly gave."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>Seated by the desk in the inner apartment of the late Judge
Sheldon's suite, Chief Inspector William Read and Mr. Jeffery
Blackburn were enjoying a tasty lunch and continuing their
investigation by examining the contents of the dead man's
pockets.</p>

<p>Read handled the late Judge's possessions while Jeffery, a
sandwich in one hand, a fountain-pen in the other, jotted each item
down on paper. At length, as the Inspector paused in his
enumerating, the young man laid down his pen. "Is that all?" he
asked.</p>

<p>His companion nodded. "Just check them over with me, son."</p>

<p>Jeffery laid down his sandwich, swallowed a final morsel, and
read slowly:</p>

<p>"One tobacco-pouch.<br>
One pipe-case,<br>
One matchbox in silver case,<br>
One long envelope containing packet of treasury-notes,<br>
Twenty-five shillings in loose change,<br>
Two handkerchiefs,<br>
One gold watch and chain,<br>
Gold pen and pencil,<br>
Spectacle-case with spectacles,<br>
One leather wallet containing:<br>
Folded newspaper-cutting,<br>
Two stubs theatre-tickets,<br>
Business cards,<br>
Three private letters,<br>
Banknotes,<br>
Motor-car licence."</p>

<p>He glanced up. "Is that all right?"</p>

<p>Read sat back. "Right as a bank!" He picked up a cream cake and
sank his teeth into it. "Wonder if there's anything in that little
lot to help us?"</p>

<p>"If so, it will be in the wallet," Blackburn opined.</p>

<p>"Personally, I'm more interested in this packet of money." Read
took up the envelope and began counting the notes. He spoke after a
pause. "There's two hundred pounds here, son. That seems to clinch
the theory that robbery was not the motive. But why should the
Judge carry that sum about with him?"</p>

<p>Jeffery shook his head. The Inspector replaced the packet of
banknotes on the desk and took up the newspaper-cutting. He
unfolded it&mdash;a slip of newsprint some six inches long. His
eyes swept it casually, then more closely. Reading, he gave a
sudden ejaculation.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!"</p>

<p>Blackburn looked surprised. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>The elder man did not reply for a moment. He was re-reading the
cutting. He raised his eyes and passed the printed slip to his
companion. "Read this," he invited. "It's either the long arm of
coincidence or something deeper."</p>

<p>Jeffery took the cutting and read it carefully. There was no
date on the print. The story began with the headlines:</p>

<p class="newspaper">BACK FROM THE DEAD!<br>
STRANGE STORY OF WAR SURVIVOR.<br>
Here on Mission Work<br>
(By Dyke Wilkinson, Special Correspondent)<br>
<br>
To be erroneously reported dead in the war, only to return safely
and lose his memory in an air-raid upon London, was the experience
of a passenger on the "Cornwall," which berthed at Port Melbourne
to-day. His name is James Alfred Torrance, and he is travelling to
Australia to inaugurate a Gospel Tent Mission in this city.<br>
<br>
Mr. Torrance's experience dates back to the early days of the war.
He is an Australian and was among the first to enlist. In December
of 1914, a mistake in identification-discs occurred and he was
reported dead.<br>
<br>
In reality, Mr. Torrance was among those scheduled for early leave
in London. While in that city, he was seeking shelter from an
air-raid when a bomb exploded near him. The shock caused a complete
loss of memory, followed by a nervous breakdown. He spent three
years in hospital, during which time he partly recovered. When
released, he could not remember his name nor recall any
recollection of friends or family. He adopted the name of Torrance
and obtained work at the King Alfred Hospital, where he worked
until six months ago.<br>
<br>
It was about this time when Mr. Torrance was fortunate to win 2000
in a newspaper contest. At first he refused to take the money,
since the competition was in the nature of a lottery. He
determined, however, to resign from his position and spend the
money financing a Gospel Tent Mission that would tour Victoria
through the Centenary Celebrations.<br>
<br>
While in Australia, Mr. Torrance hopes to meet and talk with
friends who may help him in regaining his lost memory. He will
disembark at Sydney, from which capital he will set out with his
Tent Mission.</p>

<p>Blackburn raised his eyes. "Well?" he inquired.</p>

<p>The Inspector spoke slowly. "I wonder whether Mr. Torrance could
possibly locate his relatives in this city."</p>

<p>The young man tossed the cutting on the desk. He rose to his
feet. "Meaning Miss Sheldon's story about her father?" He shook his
head. "That seems rather like twisting the arm of coincidence clean
off!"</p>

<p>"When you've been in this game as long as I have," Read told
him, with a frown, "you'll come to depend on coincidences." He
thrust out a finger at Jeffery. "If this missioner hasn't anything
to do with the case, why should Sheldon keep that cutting?" As
Blackburn shrugged his shoulders, the other man made an impatient
movement. "Wonder where we could locate this Torrance? He'd surely
be able to tell us something."</p>

<p>Blackburn was forming the crumbs on the desk-top into neat
little heaps. Without looking up, he said: "If you're so persistent
in third degree methods, the opportunity is to hand: Torrance's
Gospel Tent arrived in Melbourne two weeks ago."</p>

<p>Read jumped to his feet. "The deuce!" he exclaimed. "Do you know
the address?"</p>

<p>"It's in the newspapers every day. I suggest you send one of
your minions to the stall in the foyer."</p>

<p>Already Read was half-way across the apartment and calling to
the constable on duty at the door. Within a few minutes the man
returned with the daily. Spreading it on the desk, the two
investigators flicked the pages Until they found the advertisement.
Read straightened with a satisfied grunt and rubbed his hands. "We
can be there in ten minutes!" he announced. Recalling the constable
from the door, he barked out a quick succession of orders.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>Half an hour later, the police-car, with Chief Inspector Read
and Jeffery in the rear seat, slowed down before a wide space of
ground surrounded by a galvanized-iron fence. The Gospel Tent
Mission had its location on the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>About the iron fencing, fluttering bills were
plastered&mdash;bills that adjured in bold, scarlet lettering:</p>

<p>"ARE YOU PREPARED TO MEET YOUR GOD?", "REPENT, THE DAY OF
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!"</p>

<p>and, farther down, the invitation:</p>

<p>"GO YE INTO THE WORLD AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO ALL MEN."</p>

<p>From the fence, the top of a large bell tent could be seen. The
police-car crawled slowly until it halted opposite a swinging gate.
The Inspector and his companion stepped out and made their way
across to the entrance.</p>

<p>They passed through and their eyes rested on what appeared to be
a tiny village under canvas. The large tent occupied the main
position on the grounds and a number of smaller canvas structures
were spread about it in a wide circle.</p>

<p>There was a collection of people about the encampment, some
sitting outside their tents reading, others moving about the
grounds in twos and threes, talking quietly. From somewhere came
the wheezing strains of a harmonium, followed by a choir of voices
which balanced in enthusiasm what they lacked in harmony. In an
open marquee people were engaged in clearing tables, while from the
end of the tent a curl of blue smoke proclaimed the cook-house.</p>

<p>"Seems rather like a loafer's paradise," Read grunted, looking
around. "Sitting out in the sun, reading and singing, appears to me
a pretty pleasant way to heaven!"</p>

<p>Jeffery's tone was reproachful. "'Neither did we eat any man's
bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and
day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you,'" he
quoted.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you talking about?" snapped Read.</p>

<p>"Thessalonians two. Chapter three&mdash;verse eight," Jeffery
explained mildly.</p>

<p>The other gave a surly grunt. With the young man at his heels,
he strode across to the marquee and buttonholed a young woman who
was passing with her arms laden with hymn books. She was a rather
plain young woman, with rather sharp, pinched features emphasized
by the manner she wore her hair&mdash;strained harshly back to form
a tight bun. There was a pallid wart on her chin. She walked
straight ahead, lips moving soundlessly, eyes fixed on some distant
goal, so that when Read laid a hand on her arm she started like a
sleeper awakening and flinched back. Her eyes were wide with
alarm.</p>

<p>"Just a moment, young lady," Read spoke quietly, without
preamble. "We are from the Criminal Investigation Department. Could
you say where I would find Mr. Torrance?"</p>

<p>The girl blinked at him. "You the police?" she stammered.</p>

<p>The Inspector's mouth tightened impatiently. "Yes&mdash;yes!
Where is Mr. Torrance?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, darting swift, suspicious glances at the two men.
A tongue moistened her lips. "We&mdash;we don't know, none of
us."</p>

<p>One of her books toppled from its pile and fell to the ground.
Jeffery picked up the volume, dusted it carefully and returned it.
The girl was staring at them. "Honestly, we don't know," she
repeated.</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;don't know?"</p>

<p>Sudden defiance blazed in the girl's eyes. "We just
don't&mdash;that's all." After a pause, she continued: "We haven't
seen the Master for two days. Took morning prayer yesterday, he
did&mdash;and we haven't seen him since!"</p>

<p>"Oh...!" The Inspector murmured slowly. He stood with his hands
clasped behind him, staring narrow-eyed at the frightened girl.
"And has the Tent Mission business been delayed all that time?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir. First Bond-servant Hillier has been conducting the
services in the Master's absence:"</p>

<p>"First Bond-servant?" The Chief Inspector made no attempt to
keep the amusement from his voice. "What's the idea of the fancy
name?"</p>

<p>The girl shifted the burden in her arms. Her tone was stiff with
dignity. "We're all known by names like that here," she said
tightly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Torrance is our Master. Mr. Hillier, next to the Master, is
his First Bond-servant. Miss Turpin, in charge of the women, is
First Handmaiden."</p>

<p>Read nodded, his grey eyes twinkling. "And what are you, young
lady?"</p>

<p>A blush spread across the girl's plain features. "I'm just one
of the Daughters of Israel," she said primly. "One of the
Gershonite daughters."</p>

<p>The Inspector, glancing at Jeffery, noticed the corners of the
young man's mouth twitching dangerously. His eyes telegraphed a
warning and he turned back to the waiting girl. "At least you have
the virtue of humility," he said dryly. "And now, where would we
find Mr. Hillier?"</p>

<p>"This way." And the girl, wheeling about, began to retrace her
steps across the stubbly ground. The two men followed at a
respectful distance.</p>

<p>The tent occupied by First Bond-servant Hillier proclaimed his
rank by being larger than the average. It stood apart from the
circle, and a cleared path through the dried grass and rubble led
to the entrance. The Inspector thanked the girl with a nod and,
dismissed, the Gershonite daughter almost scuttled away. The two
men approached the tent and then, as though by mutual consent,
halted suddenly. Inside the canvas structure, two voices were
raised. A woman's voice, husky with emotion, put a question&mdash;a
question that caused the two men outside to stiffen. For the voice
had asked tremblingly:</p>

<p>"You fool! Don't you realize that it's murder?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Read and his companion exchanged a
significant glance. The woman's voice spoke again, and they could
read fear and agitation in the frenzied syllables.</p>

<p>"But why did he do it? He must have known he'd be found
out."</p>

<p>A second voice&mdash;that of a man&mdash;interrupted. The words,
mumbled and slurred, were barely audible.</p>

<p>"'And one of these smote the servant of the High Priest, and cut
off his ear. And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye this far. And
He touched the ear&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Again the woman's voice, bitter, sneering, interrupted, cutting
into the crooning monotone:</p>

<p>"Don't try to work off that biblical tripe on me! Justification
or not, it's callous murder! Understand that! It's murder and he'll
swing for it!"</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Read advanced and rapped sharply on a wooden box
standing outside the tent. From inside there came the sound of
breaths sharply drawn and a sudden tense silence, as though the
occupants were eyeing each other in terror. Read knocked
again&mdash;peremptorily. Scarcely had he moved back when the
canvas flap was thrust violently aside and a woman emerged. Then,
with a sharply drawn gasp, she turned and plunged her way across
the grounds. They had a momentary impression of wide fear-darkened
eyes set in a sallow complexion, and then she was gone. They were
still watching when a smooth voice called:</p>

<p>"Yes, gentlemen. You were wanting someone?"</p>

<p>Both men swung round. At the entrance to the tent stood a
middle-aged man dressed in ill-fitting sombre clothes. He was quite
bald, yet it was the face that held Jeffery's eyes: a remarkable
face, thin to the point of emaciation so that the pale skin
stretched tightly over the jutting beak of a nose and high
cheekbones. The mouth was a tight, grim line, almost devoid of
lips. But even more disturbing than this cruel slit were the
deep-set burning eyes that peered from under sparse brows. Sunken,
wild, they were the eyes of a fanatic. So might Savonarola, or one
of those pallid elders who sent old women screaming to the stake in
the dark days of witchcraft, have looked. The young man felt a
ripple of fear shudder down his spine. To his relief, those
smouldering eyes were turned away, to fix on Read, who came
forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hillier?" And as the man nodded, the Inspector performed
introductions. "We would like a few minutes' talk with you." He
paused and eyed the other keenly. "We are investigating the murder
of Sir Merton Sheldon."</p>

<p>Not the shadow of expression crossed the lean face. The dark
eyes, smouldering deeply, did not waver. "Certainly, gentlemen.
Come inside. My dwelling is humble, but you are welcome." He stood
aside to let them pass.</p>

<p>The furnishings of the tent were spartan in their simplicity. A
narrow truckle-bed, a table, and a cheap chest of drawers stood on
the bare wooden floor. The young man's sensitive nostrils
contracted at the odour of stale food and unaired clothing which
hung about the place. The missioner pulled out two wooden chairs,
and motioning his guests to be seated, dropped on to the bed.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen." He linked his fingers in an attitude of prayer
And waited.</p>

<p>Read came to the point at once.</p>

<p>"We have reasons to believe, Mr. Hillier, that your employer,
Mr. Torrance, may be able to give us certain information regarding
the case we are investigating. One of your followers in the mission
has told us that Mr. Torrance is not here at present." He paused as
if expecting the other man to say something, but Hillier continued
to stare at the floor, his eyes veiled by heavy lids. Read flashed
a quick glance at him, and when he spoke again a sharpness had
crept into his voice.</p>

<p>"We understand that Mr. Torrance left this camp yesterday
morning and has not been seen since that time." He hunched forward
in his seat and flung the question abruptly. "Do you know where he
is, Mr. Hillier?"</p>

<p>A shadow, too faint to be called an expression, flitted across
the lean face. "I have no idea, Inspector Read."</p>

<p>"But surely you are making some effort to find your leader?"</p>

<p>The evangelist unclasped his hands and spread them in apologetic
gesture. "We have been so busy. After all, it is only two days..."
The voice trailed away. The thin fingers met and clasped almost
lovingly.</p>

<p>Jeffery spoke from his chair. "Surely this is strange, Mr.
Hillier? The most important person in your mission disappears
without warning for forty-eight hours and you do not consider it a
serious matter!"</p>

<p>Hillier's eyes sought the young man's face. Their queer
fascination was almost hypnotic. "The Master is not like an
ordinary man. Often he leaves us for days at a time...wandering
here and there, his mind filled with the great holy Voice, his eyes
on the high stars, and his earthly desires subjugated to the divine
glorification of truth, light, and beauty." The voice rose,
resonant, compelling. It completed the impression of power and
authority about this man. Now it dropped to that monotonous
semi-tone. "But always his feet were safely guided&mdash;always..."
He nodded convincingly. "He will return...never fear."</p>

<p>Blackburn glanced at Read and shrugged his shoulders. This man
Hillier was side-tracking them, whether by accident or design he
could not say. But his movement was not lost on the Inspector, who
squared his shoulders and gave a sharp cough, as though bracing
himself for a difficult task. He spoke smoothly.</p>

<p>"You will forgive our intruding on your more private affairs,
sir. But as we approached your tent we could not avoid overhearing
a rather remarkable conversation between yourself and a young lady
visitor. That conversation dealt with the subject of murder, and
you quoted a biblical reference to the losing of an ear." He paused
and spaced the next words heavily. "The body of Sir Merton Sheldon,
found murdered this morning, was mutilated in the same way!"</p>

<p>No answer. The evangelist's lips were locked tight as a steel
trap. The knuckles of his hands showed ivory-white as his fingers
clenched firmer. In the silence, it was as though some invisible
hostile presence had crept into the tent and stroked the air with
lean suggestive fingers.</p>

<p>Jeffery was first to speak.</p>

<p>"We saw this woman as she left your tent. Although it was only a
brief glimpse, we noticed two things. One was that she appeared to
be in deadly terror, and the other, that she resembled Miss Gloria
Grey, a former musical-comedy actress."</p>

<p>With his words, a change swept over the man. Two scarlet spots
burned in his cheeks and his eyes were so merciless as to be
terrible. He was like one in the grip of a torturing dilemma. Then
his clasped hands broke, hung limply at his side as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, brother. Miss Grey was here. She too had the idea that the
Master knew something about this killing, and that, through
cowardice, he was hiding away. Pah!" He spat the word in bitter
scorn.</p>

<p>"Who is this woman?" Read demanded.</p>

<p>"The Master engaged her as a soloist to lead the singing. That
was two weeks ago. Since that time she has brought nothing save
trouble to the great work. By her wiles and her flattery she turned
the Master's mind to the fleshly things of earth." The venom in his
tone could almost be felt, so searing was it. "Cursed be she and
her harlot sisterhood!</p>

<p>"She was a wicked woman! I knew it as soon as I saw her enter
these gates. I told the Master. I prayed and implored him not to
jeopardize our great work in this way." The hand dropped, the lean
body seemed to shrink in its garments. "But she had blinded his
eyes, even as Bathsheba the Hittite's wife tempted David. The
Master could not&mdash;would not see, even after I proved to him
that this woman sneered at the great work..." He broke off suddenly
and stood looking at them.</p>

<p>Jeffery shifted. His voice was high, excited. "And so you both
had a thundering row." It was a statement rather than an
inquiry.</p>

<p>For a moment it looked as though the missioner would spring
across the tent at him. They saw the long body tense, the hands
clench into fists. The red blotches on his cheeks spread until the
face was an angry mottled scarlet. The Inspector jumped to his
feet. There was a tense momentary clashing of will-power that
seemed to quiver the still, hot air inside the room. Then Hillier
relaxed and sank down on the bed. The scarlet drained from his
cheeks, leaving them pallid. Only his eyes glittered and burned
beneath the craggy brows. After a pause, his words
came&mdash;jerkingly, dryly.</p>

<p>"Yes. We did quarrel&mdash;the Master and I. I told him he was
sinning. Sinning in sight of God and man. But that was
later&mdash;after the woman had left us."</p>

<p>Read had resumed his seat. Now he leaned forward. "Left you?
What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"About four days ago the Master came to me saying that the woman
would be with us no longer." The harsh, dry tone did not vary. "She
had broken her engagement with us. He gave no reason for this,
merely telling me to look for another soloist."</p>

<p>"And have you any idea what caused the break between these
two?"</p>

<p>Hillier shook his head. "No. But I can only pray that the Master
repented and drove her from the camp." He paused as if considering
the point. "But this cannot have been so. The next day he brought a
second woman into the mission. Then it was that I reproached him.
He refused any explanation and became angry. So we
quarrelled...bitterly!"</p>

<p>Jeffery Blackburn had taken a small notebook from his pocket and
was making entries with a pencil. He looked up. "Just correct me if
any of these points are wrong, Mr. Hillier." Consulting the book,
he continued: "Gloria Grey joined your mission two weeks ago. Four
days ago Torrance told you she was leaving, but refused an
explanation. The following day he brought a second woman into the
camp. That same day you quarrelled. The following morning (one day
prior to the murder we are investigating) he disappeared. No trace
of him has been discovered up till this moment." He looked up at
the evangelist. "Is that all correct?"</p>

<p>Hillier inclined his head. "Perfectly."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded and pocketed his note-book. The Inspector
asked:</p>

<p>"Had you seen the second woman before Torrance brought her
here?"</p>

<p>"No." The answer was curt, the thin lips barely moving.</p>

<p>"At what time did she arrive?"</p>

<p>"About ten o'clock in the morning. She and the Master stayed in
his tent for some three hours. They came out to lunch in the city
and returned to the mission in the afternoon. Finally, the woman
left in the evening, before prayers. That is, at seven
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Did Torrance accompany her this last time?"</p>

<p>The evangelist's eyes glowed, as though at some recollection
that was not unpleasing. "The Master did not leave the grounds
until close on nine o'clock that night," he said softly. "Three
times I visited his tent, and each time I found him on his knees,
praying. About a few minutes before the nine hour, I crossed to his
tent again and met him coming out. He seemed excited and thrust me
aside almost roughly. Without, a word, he walked on and out through
the gates." Hillier paused. "And that was the last I saw of
him."</p>

<p>"He came back again that night, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I did not see him. Other friends in the mission told
me. I was rather upset over the quarrel of the day and tried to
avoid the Master as much as possible." Almost as though
anticipating their question, he added: "He left the mission about
eight o'clock next morning."</p>

<p>Read appeared satisfied. He rose and looked around the small
room. "Have you a portrait of Torrance&mdash;one that would help us
to identify him?" he asked.</p>

<p>Hillier crossed to the chest of drawers and drew out an
unmounted print. This he passed to the Inspector, and as Jeffery
moved across to inspect it:</p>

<p>"That photograph was taken by the Press when we came to this
city," Hillier explained.</p>

<p>The two men scarcely heard his words. Their attention was
focused on the square of glossy paper. It showed a stocky, strongly
built man with a flowing black beard stepping from the express. He
was being greeted by a group of clergymen.</p>

<p>"A black beard..." Read murmured. Smartly, he spoke to Hillier:
"May we take this photograph?"</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>"Just one last thing," the Inspector added, slipping the
photograph in his pocket. "Can you give us any description of this
second woman whom Torrance brought to the mission?"</p>

<p>The dark shadow had fallen across the evangelist's face. "I can
do more than describe her," he said sombrely. "I can show you her
photograph. The Master has one in his tent." He made a movement
toward the door. "If you would come this way...it is not far." He
led the way across the cleared patch of ground to a larger tent,
isolated from the remainder. Hillier held back the tent-flap and
motioned the two men inside.</p>

<p>The tent of the Master was larger and more lavishly furnished
than the tent of the Bond-Servant. There were rugs on the wooden
floor and among the furnishings a handsome radio cabinet of
polished wood. A low divan, covered with cushions, occupied one
side of the tent. Hillier crossed to a small desk and gestured
toward a photograph propped against a vase of withered flowers.</p>

<p>"That's the woman!" he said bitterly.</p>

<p>Jeffery took one look at the elaborate studio portrait of Miss
Valerie Sheldon.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The afternoon editions of the "Globe" and the "Courier" were on
the streets when Bertha Fenton emerged from the detective
headquarters that afternoon to make her way back to the offices of
the "Informer." She passed an army of newsboys screaming the
headlines of the Sheldon murder to the four corners of the
city.</p>

<p>Although this premature competition was regrettable, it did not
perturb her, since Miss Fenton was feeling pleased with herself on
that particular afternoon. In spite of the authority's attempts at
"hushing-up" the strange decease of Sir Merton, she had wormed a
valuable clue.</p>

<p>Shortly after three o'clock, in company with Wilkinson, Yates,
and Lascelles, she had gone down to the detective offices to pick
up what further information was available. The result had been
disappointing. the finger-print experts reported no success.</p>

<p>Back to the offices on the ground floor...and here was a find!
The woman's quick eyes gleamed as she took in the collection of
objects on the table: that tobacco-pouch, the spectacle-case, and
the other articles found on the dead man. The folded
newspaper-cutting interested her particularly. Long experience in
Press psychology told this plump scribe that a person rarely
carries a newspaper cutting about unless the printed words touch
that individual closely.</p>

<p>Miss Fenton, whose ideas on the subject of <i>meum et tuum</i>
were extraordinarily elastic, meant to appropriate that cutting in
the sacred cause of the scribbler. But she had reckoned without
authority.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she reached out a hand to take the cutting when the
detective in charge rapped out an order to get back behind the
counter. Bertha obeyed reluctantly. "Behind the counter" meant
being four feet away from that much-desired cutting. She took her
stand and lit a cigarette, and all the time her sharp brain was
doing an admirable piece of deduction.</p>

<p>Every newspaperman and woman comes to know the peculiarities of
type and printing in the rival pages. Each newspaper had certain
characteristics known to the initiated&mdash;a slight gloss on the
surface of one paper, a dark-ink printing on a second, a scare-head
on a third, and a dignified quiet line on a fourth. That was how
Miss Fenton was able to identify the cutting as coming from the
columns of the "Courier." There was the smooth-surfaced paper and
the light-ink printing. So much was easy. But the cutting was
folded in four, and now Miss Bertha must tread delicately as Agag.
She smoked and considered, her narrowed eyes never leaving the slip
of newsprint.</p>

<p>The cutting lay at an angle to her eyes so that the top was
facing half way. She could perceive only half of the printed black
heading, the first word "BACK" followed by something that appeared
like "THE D..." In the smaller-type line she read the words
"Strange story..." and the rest was lost in the acute angle of the
paper. And next&mdash;"Here on M..." was plain. This was followed
by a small nonpareil line which absolutely defied her short-sighted
stare.</p>

<p>Bertha considered.</p>

<p>The headings, as far as she could see, were inked in a bold
bodoni type, which meant that the report would probably be found on
the main news page of the "Courier" and almost assuredly at the top
of a column. Now&mdash;bold bodoni. Hadn't there been a row about
that type of heading on the "Courier" some months ago? She
remembered how Wilkinson had told her that the
sub-editors&mdash;lazy bums!&mdash;had been slamming bold bodoni
heads on every single column until its prevalence began to attract
unfavourable attention. A notice had come forth from Carmody, the
editor-in-chief, forbidding the use of bold bodoni until further
orders. That was about six months ago.</p>

<p>Miss Fenton's plump fingers drummed the counter. The "Courier"
of six months ago. Main news page. Top of column. That narrowed the
search considerably. Now, if she could discover the day of
publication...</p>

<p>The detectives were talking in a group in the far corner of the
room. If she could only turn that cutting an inch nearer her
eyes...but she dare not reach out! Suddenly her eyes gleamed. She
drew deeply on her cigarette and, leaning her chin on her hand,
blew a careful cloud of smoke toward the table. After the fourth
attempt, she was successful! The breath from her lips caught the
edge of the cutting and twisted it about so that it faced her
squarely.</p>

<p>Now she could see the entire heading...now she could read "By
Dyke Wilkinson, Special Correspondent", and also&mdash;praise
be&mdash;she could make out the words of the opening paragraph. She
screwed her eyes ferociously and picked up the words "Cornwall" and
"Port Melbourne to-day." Crushing her butt out, she gave a grunt of
satisfaction and dragged her hat into position. Overseas steamers
berthed on Port Melbourne three times a week, but mail steamers
like the "Cornwall" on Mondays only. Now she had everything she
wanted.</p>

<p>Back in her office, she entered the reporters' room. A group of
men were chatting near the door; they looked up as she approached,
and she returned their greeting vaguely. She made her way to a high
bench at one side of the room where files of the various newspapers
were kept bound for reference. Her fingers closed about a
safety-razor blade in a nickelled holder.</p>

<p>Above the bench, a stern black-lettered warning read: "THESE
FILES MUST NOT BE CUT. THIS MEANS YOU!" Bertha closed an expressive
eye at the notice and dragged the fat bound copy of the "Courier"
toward her. Six months ago. She must begin her search well back in
the volume. She began to turn the dog-eared pages. Luck was with
her. On the main news page for May 8 she ran the cutting down. With
a muttered ejaculation she flourished her razor-blade in the face
of the notice and neatly clipped the cutting.</p>

<p>Back in her cubicle, she read the report carefully. It conveyed
nothing to her. The reason why Judge Sheldon should cherish a
cutting of a crazy evangelist was beyond her comprehension. Sitting
back, she turned the newsprint over in her fingers. Suddenly her
eyes dilated.</p>

<p>On the rear of the Torrance story was another report. Bertha
held the cutting close and read':</p>

<p class="newspaper">OSCAR DOWLING DEAD<br>
GUARD FINDS BODY<br>
Strange Wounds on Throat<br>
<br>
The body of Oscar Dowling, the Golganna murderer, who was serving a
life-sentence at Greycliffe prison for the murder of his wife and
children, was found late this afternoon by a guard of the gaol. The
body was lying face downwards in a small creek running through one
of the gullies. It had apparently been there for some time, since
the face was bloated and disfigured by the length of time in the
water. The lower part of the face was mutilated and there were
wounds an the throat.<br>
<br>
Dr. Crotty, the prison doctor who examined the convict's body after
recovery, is of the opinion that the man had been dead for some
time, possibly a week or even longer. The gully in which the body
was found is in an isolated spot and it is quite possible for it to
have lain there that length of time without being discovered.<br>
<br>
Dr. Crotty, after an examination of the wounds on Dowling's face
and throat, said they may have been caused by the teeth of a
bloodhound. These animals were used in tracking the convict after
his escape. It is believed that Dowling must have encountered the
animal and attempted to kill it to prevent an alarm being given.
The animal must have turned on the man and inflicted the
wounds.</p>

<p>Bertha Fenton raised here eyes from the report. A wrinkle formed
between her brows. There was something she was trying to place,
some fugitive idea that would not be trapped. Oscar Dowling. Oscar
Dowling. She repeated the words as if they might help her. But it
was useless. With a shrugging movement of her shoulders she dropped
the cutting, and reached across for her glass.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>Nine-thirty on the following morning found Chief Inspector Read
sitting in one of the deep arm-chairs at the far end of the Sheldon
apartment.</p>

<p>On the heavy glass-topped desk at the other end of the room
stood a pair of shoes. Woman's shoes, almost fragile in their black
satin uppers fronted with rhinestone buckles, their heels slim and
soles paper-like. Those soles and the satin uppers were stained and
dirty...</p>

<p>There came the sound of a door being opened, and footsteps
crossed the bedroom. Read rose as Jeffery Blackburn entered,
accompanied by O'Connor and Donlin. The Inspector nodded to the
young man, who came forward eagerly.</p>

<p>"Any luck?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded and gestured toward the desk. Jeffery
turned, dropped his stick and gloves on the near-by chair, and
walked across. He did not touch the shoes, but stood looking at
them.</p>

<p>"How did you get them?" He turned toward the elder man.</p>

<p>"Give the credit to O'Connor and Donlin," the Inspector replied.
"They enlisted the aid of the boots downstairs and, through that
lad, traced the shoes to the lessee of an apartment about six doors
down the corridor. I've asked the manager to keep quiet about the
business for the time being." He paused and nodded to the
plain-clothes man. "Give Mr. Jeffery the layout, O'Connor."</p>

<p>The big detective came forward. "The apartment belongs to an
actress. She's not working at the time. Been renting the rooms for
the past month. Name's Grey&mdash;Gloria Grey."</p>

<p>Blackburn glanced up sharply and caught Read's eye.</p>

<p>A grim smile played about the Inspector's lips. "You've heard
the name before, haven't you, son?" he inquired.</p>

<p>With a nod, he prompted the detective to continue.</p>

<p>"When we traced the shoes to this Grey woman, it must have been
close on ten o'clock last night," O'Connor went on. "We walked to
the door and knocked. There wasn't an answer, so we tried the door.
It was locked. I sent one of the constables downstairs to find the
Chief and report. Then I rang for Colbert, the manager of these
flats, and asked him to bring the master-key of the apartment.
Inspector Read came along, and as soon as Colbert put in an
appearance, we unlocked the door and went inside.</p>

<p>"The apartment was a sort of bed-sitting-room. It was empty so
far as the occupant was concerned. The bed had not been slept in,
but it was indented as though someone had been sitting or lying on
it. In one corner of the room, just as if they had been kicked off
in a hurry, were the shoes. The stains were still showing on the
soles. But there was no trace of the woman herself, although it
certainly didn't look as if she'd cut and run."</p>

<p>Jeffery, who was following this recital closely, asked: "What
makes you think that?"</p>

<p>Read interposed quickly: "There were a number of small points
that suggested the contrary, son. This Miss Grey is a heavy smoker,
according to manager Colbert. She is rarely without a cigarette.
Yet her silver case, almost filled, was on her dressing-table. It
seems unlikely that, if this woman had made a get-away, she would
have left that case behind. Again, on the dressing-table was about
five pounds in notes and change. She'd apparently gone away with
only a few pence, unless, of course, she had more money on her
person&mdash;which is unlikely, since she has been unemployed. And
we could find no clothing missing nor anything that suggested she
had gone for a long time."</p>

<p>O'Connor nodded. He eyed his superior for a moment, and as the
Inspector was silent took up the story again.</p>

<p>"We took the shoes and made a thorough search of the apartment,"
the detective continued. "Nothing incriminating was further brought
to light. Then we left, after putting two men to watch for the
woman's return. About midnight she came back, and she hasn't left
the apartment since. As we came up, our men reported that she'd
been there all night, and she's still inside. The man on the door
could hear her moving about in the room."</p>

<p>Jeffery turned to the Inspector. "Why not an arrest last night?
You're taking a risk leaving that girl alone to destroy evidence,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>Read took a turn up and down the room before he spoke. The
indecision in his movements was mirrored in his voice as he halted
opposite the young man. He spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"Honestly, son, I'm not satisfied. Why in the name of sanity
should that woman, knowing that evidence like those shoes has hung
people before now, leave them lying about quite openly for anyone
to find? It's incredible! The first thought of even the most
dull-witted person would be to destroy them, don't you agree?"</p>

<p>Blackburn nodded. As he did not comment, the Inspector went
on:</p>

<p>"There's another thing, Jeff. It's only small, but sticks in my
mind. When I went into the apartment last night with the boys, I
wanted a match to search the cupboard. I hadn't any in my coat and
looked about the room. There wasn't a single match to be
found&mdash;not even a burnt end!" He held up his hand as Blackburn
started to speak. "Yes, I know that it isn't unusual&mdash;but,
remember, this woman is a heavy smoker. The room had that smell of
stale tobacco-smoke and there were at least thirty cigarette-ends
crushed out in the ash-tray on the table. But not a single match
could be found in the entire apartment!"</p>

<p>"Probably because she used a lighter," suggested Jeffery.</p>

<p>Read brought his fist down on the desk with a thump that
emphasized his next words. "She did use a lighter! That's the
queerest point of all. Colbert said that he could never remember
this woman striking matches. She always carried a small silver and
mother-of-pearl lighter. Now, although we ran a fine-tooth comb
through that apartment, there was no trace of the lighter found."
He paused and thrust his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Here's what I've been leading up to. Why should a woman, who is
a heavy smoker, leave her cigarettes behind and take the lighter
with her&mdash;especially when she goes on an errand of such
importance that even an habitual practice like smoking is driven
temporarily from her mind?"</p>

<p>The young man considered for a moment. "There seems to be two
explanations, Chief," he returned. "Either this lighter was in some
way incriminating and therefore dangerous if left out of her
possession&mdash;or else it must have had some important bearing on
her errand. It may have actually been the cause of the hurried
journey last night."</p>

<p>Read nodded doubtfully. "Then the questions arise: Firstly, what
possible part could the automatic lighter have played in the murder
of Sheldon? And secondly, how can the lighter possibly be more
incriminating than the shoes, which weren't even concealed, let
alone destroyed?"</p>

<p>Jeffery squared his shoulders. "The answer to both questions
probably lies in Miss Grey's apartment. Shall we go?"</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded. He paused only long enough to pick up the
shoes and hand them to Donlin. In a group, the four men passed out
into the corridor and walked down toward a door at the far end. A
constable stationed before it saluted as they approached.</p>

<p>"All correct, sir," he reported smartly to the Inspector, and
stood aside.</p>

<p>Read advanced to the closed door and knocked authoritatively.
Sounds of movements, heard through the flimsy partition, ceased
abruptly. There was no answer. The Inspector rapped again and
waited. Slow footsteps approached the door.</p>

<p>Read had time to whisper curtly to Donlin, "Keep those shoes out
of sight until I tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then the door swung back and a woman stood in the entrance, her
face hard, surveying the party with eyes frankly hostile. "What do
you want?" she demanded.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector pushed past her and the men filed into the
room. The woman closed the door and stood with her back against it,
every line of her attitude resentful of this forced intrusion. Read
gave a quick glance about the apartment. His voice quiet and
authoritative, he turned to the occupant.</p>

<p>"Your name is Grey...Miss Gloria Grey?" As the woman nodded
curtly, he added: "We are investigating the murder of Sir Merton
Sheldon. We should like to ask you a few questions, if you don't
mind."</p>

<p>The woman did not move. She braced her slender body as though
against an attack, and an angry wrinkle marred her forehead.</p>

<p>"I do mind!" She flung the words at them, drawing a deep,
hissing breath. "I want to know what right you have to break into
my apartment last night and search through my personal
possessions."</p>

<p>Her lips curled. "That's just what one might expect from the
police! Why don't you go and arrest a man who can retaliate instead
of frightening a woman?" She was breathing heavily, watching them
closely.</p>

<p>Throughout this jeremiad, Jeffery was taking stock of Gloria
Grey. He saw a slim, almost emaciated blonde woman closely
approaching the dangerous forties, a blonde with thin, sharp
features giving an impression of hungriness that even the hastily
applied make-up could not conceal. A green peignoir was tied about
her body, and her tiny feet were thrust into green slippers with
enormous pom-poms. But it was the face that held his attention. The
complexion was sallow, contrasting with the china-blue eyes, which
protruded like those of a frightened child. As she talked, the
woman revealed a number of teeth filled with gold. Her hair, cut
into a boyish bob, was tangled and unbrushed, while the shadows
beneath her eyes were painted there by sorrow and something darker.
There was about her entire appearance an air of fugitiveness
constantly maintained.</p>

<p>Read was speaking again, grimly genial.</p>

<p>"You'll do no good by taking that attitude, young lady. Because
we're not trying to frighten. We are merely seeking information.
There's no need to become abusive unless"&mdash;he paused
momentarily and his eyes bored sharply into her face "&mdash;unless
you have anything to hide!"</p>

<p>Gloria Grey came forward. She was plainly forcing herself to be
calm, and sat down on the arm of a chair. It was a particularly
stagy movement, and Jeffery expected her to cross her knees. She
sat quietly, her face hard and her eyes defiant.</p>

<p>"I've nothing to hide," she said sullenly. "Get on with your
business."</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded. "Where were you, Miss Grey, between the
hours of eight o'clock and midnight on the night of the
murder?"</p>

<p>It seemed as though the woman was not listening. Her eyes roamed
the apartment as though searching for something. Jeffery, with
quick intuition, came forward with open cigarette-case and a smile
that was an invitation. Gloria Grey took a cigarette with fingers
that trembled and placed it between her lips. The Inspector
repeated his question.</p>

<p>"I was here"&mdash;she waved the cigarette widely&mdash;"here in
this room."</p>

<p>"All the time?"</p>

<p>"All the time," the actress repeated. With the cigarette, some
of her self-control had returned. "I was reading a novel," she
elaborated. "About ten-thirty I decided it was time for bed. So I
undressed and went to sleep almost at once. Reading always makes me
tired."</p>

<p>Jeffery smiled. "Probably a rather boring novel, Miss Grey.
Could you remember the name?"</p>

<p>The woman flashed him a look. There was fear and suspicion in
her blue eyes. "I&mdash;I'm afraid not. I never remember the names
of books." She made a little helpless gesture.
"They're&mdash;well&mdash;they're just books, and that's all."</p>

<p>The young man nodded sympathetically. But Read's tone was hard.
"We understand, Miss Grey. Probably you had too much on your mind
at the time. I take it there was no one in the room with you?"</p>

<p>"There was not!"</p>

<p>"Nor did you ring for service during that time?" And as the
actress shook her head, Read clicked his tongue. "Then we have only
your bare word that you were here? You have no other
witnesses?"</p>

<p>Gloria Grey jumped to her feet. The abrupt movement almost upset
the chair. "Say!" she demanded. "What is this? The third
degree?"</p>

<p>Read shook his head. "No, my dear young lady. That is something
from which we are trying to save you." With deliberate intent he
ignored her, and his eyes wandered about the room. Through the open
door of an ante-room, he noticed a locked and strapped suitcase, He
nodded toward it. "Going away, Miss Grey?" His tone was suave.</p>

<p>Again for a moment, fear darkened her eyes. She nodded. "Yes.
I've been packing all the morning. I told you I was busy. Got a job
in Perth, if you must know&mdash;singing in prologues at a picture
theatre."</p>

<p>Jeffery had taken a cigarette and placed it between his lips.
Automatically his hands moved to his pockets for matches, sought,
and sought in vain. He sighed, and began to move about the room. On
an inlaid table close to the divan was a small silver lighter. He
crossed, conscious that the woman's eyes were following his every
movement. As he bent to pick up the lighter, the actress leapt from
her position and almost snatched the toy from his fingers. It was
not so much the movement as the ferocity of it that startled the
young man. He stared at the woman, who stood with the lighter
clutched against her breast. She faced him, pale with anger.</p>

<p>"God! But you've got a nerve!" Her tone was harsh, spitting.
"Who d' you think you are&mdash;walking into a strange apartment
helping yourself to other people's property? And I suppose you'd
call yourself a gentleman!" She was trembling violently, like one
who has had a narrow escape.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Jeffery apologized. "After all, I merely wanted a
light for my cigarette."</p>

<p>Her mouth was a bitter, sneering line. "Then get one from one of
these policemen. But keep your damned paws off my things!" She
wheeled about and walked into the smaller room. They heard the
scrape of a drawer and the thump as the lighter was dropped inside.
Then the woman returned and stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Are you finished?"</p>

<p>Read shook his head. "Far from finished, Miss Grey. Come in here
and sit down. I'm afraid this is going to be rather a lengthy
business."</p>

<p>The actress hesitated for a moment. She seemed uncertain whether
to ignore the invitation or obey. Then she shrugged her shoulders
and came forward, seating herself in the arm-chair.</p>

<p>The Inspector had not moved from his position. He asked quietly:
"You knew Judge Sheldon, of course? Did you ever meet him or hold
conversation with him?"</p>

<p>"Never!" She was lighting a second cigarette with a match taken
from a cardboard holder. Her fumbling movements showed how
unaccustomed she was to this procedure. Read waited for a moment
and then took another line.</p>

<p>"Have you missed any piece of wearing-apparel lately? A dress,
perhaps. Or a hat, or gloves or"&mdash;a significance crept into
his tone&mdash;"a pair of shoes?"</p>

<p>The woman shook her head impatiently. "Of course not."</p>

<p>Read held out his hand to the plain-clothes man and, with an
abruptness meant to be startling, thrust the shoes before her face.
"Are these your property, Miss Grey?"</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the investigators, the actress nodded
calmly. "Most certainly. I wore them yesterday." Her voice rose a
key. "What right have you to take my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that!" Read's voice rapped sharply. "Take those
shoes and examine them, please. Do you notice the stains on the
soles?"</p>

<p>Gloria Grey took the shoes and turned them over. There was an
expression on her face that Jeffery, watching closely, read as part
anger and part surprise. Certainly there was no trace of
apprehension or fear. Either this woman is a remarkable actress,
the young man told himself, or else this whole thing is mad...</p>

<p>After a short interval she spoke again, impatiently. "Yes. I see
the stains. What about them&mdash;what are they?"</p>

<p>Like steel was the Chief Inspector's voice. "They are blood,
young woman! Blood from the wound that killed Sir Merton
Sheldon!"</p>

<p>There was a naked, quivering silence in the room, a concentrated
electrification of the atmosphere that was almost too tense to be
borne. It lasted but a few seconds. Then it passed. Bated breaths
were released in long sighs, feet shuffled, hands were restless.
The woman in the chair was staring at Read, and two daubs of rouge
stood out vividly on her cheeks, giving mockery to her face instead
of beauty. Yet there was something wrong, something that did not
fit. Gloria Grey's whole attitude was that of a person stunned, not
so much with guilty fear as with overwhelming astonishment tempered
with anxiety. She had dropped her eyes and was staring at the shoes
with rapt, fascinated stare. When she spoke it was as though every
word was a painful effort. Those listening had the impression that
she addressed herself rather than the detectives.</p>

<p>"But how could his blood have got on to my shoes?"</p>

<p>Read made an impatient gesture. He too sensed the anomaly before
them. But where it made the younger man thoughtful, it irritated
the Chief Inspector. He spoke harshly.</p>

<p>"I think it is only right to tell you, Miss Grey, that you are
in a very serious position. The murderer of Judge Sheldon left a
pool of blood at the door of the Sheldon inner apartment. Yesterday
we found prints of those shoes you hold plainly marked in that
blood. That is how the stains appeared on them. While you were away
last night, my men searched your apartment and found the shoes,
marked with blood as you see them now." His voice became hard and
formal. "Have you anything to say before we arrest you on a charge
of suspicion of being concerned in the murder of Sir Merton
Sheldon?"</p>

<p>While he was speaking, the actress had half risen from her
chair, her face paper-white and one hand at her throat. But as the
Inspector continued, she sank back. An expression of relief crossed
her face, leaving them hard. The eyes that met Read's were
unwavering.</p>

<p>"Go ahead and arrest me," she said. "You'll be sorry, though, I
warn you."</p>

<p>"You've nothing to say?" Read barked.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever!" The tone held finality.</p>

<p>And in the awkward pause that followed:</p>

<p>"Not even if it would save the neck of your friend Mr. Torrance
from the Tent Mission?" Jeffery asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Ah-h!..." Gloria Grey sprang to her feet and drew a long,
sobbing breath. The horror had flooded back into her face, and she
glanced from man to man like an animal trapped and cornered.
Believing the woman about to break from the room, the detectives
braced themselves to ward her off. Surprisingly, she did no such
thing. She gave an inane choking giggle, her mouth sagged
vacuously, and she dropped to the floor. So unexpected was the
movement that no man stooped to catch her; all remained staring at
her in silence.</p>

<p>"Fainted, by Christopher!" exclaimed Read. "Here&mdash;O'Connor,
Donlin! Carry her to the divan. That's it! Get that constable at
the door to fossick out some brandy. Go on! Don't stand staring!
And, Jeffery, pop into that other room and see if there's any
smelling-salts on the dressing-table. Quickly!"</p>

<p>From chained astonishment, the apartment was quick with
movement. Read was bending over the unconscious woman, massaging
her wrists gently. Blackburn, emerging from the ante-room, held a
green-stoppered bottle in one hand, and in the other a small object
of silver and mother-o'-pearl. He handed the restorative to the
Inspector and, moving away, began to turn the lighter over in his
fingers.</p>

<p>It was, as far as he could see, an ordinary novelty of its kind,
except that it was some inch and a half longer than the average
toy. Rather bulky, Jeffery considered, especially for a lady. He
pressed a thumb on the nickelled top and it shot up, to reveal a
pale-yellow flame. This he extinguished and began a close
examination of the casing. Upending the lighter, he attempted to
prise out the reservoir that held the petrol. It was stiff and he
broke a finger-nail in the operation. At length he managed to
obtain a grip and tugged. The reservoir shot out abruptly, and with
it came another tiny metal container that dropped to the floor.
Jeffery bent and retrieved it, laying the remains of the lighter on
the table.</p>

<p>The second container was about an inch and a half long, fitted
with a close-fitting metal cap which needed his pen-knife to
dislodge it. Tipping the open container, half a dozen tiny capsules
fell into his hand. Jeffery's eyes narrowed. He crushed a pellet
and poked his forefinger into the white crystalline powder, then
straightened with a whistle in which enlightenment and surprise
were blended. Holding the capsules carefully, he turned to the
Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>"I've just discovered, Chief, why Miss Grey was so anxious to
prevent alien hands being laid on her lighter."</p>

<p>The elder man, smelling-salts in hand, wheeled abruptly. "You
have? And why's that?"</p>

<p>"Because," Jeffery told him, "she uses it to conceal her supply
of heroin tablets!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>Heroin!</p>

<p>Chief Inspector William Read stared at his young companion, and
his florid face paled. Few men knew better than the Inspector the
dread ramifications of the drug traffic and the sinister
fascination of this derivative of morphia which held tens of
thousands of unhappy devotees in its grip. But Read's mind was
racing, pursued by dark possibilities. What in heaven's name did
this new discovery mean? Were they to be called upon to expose a
drug racket as well as investigate a murder?</p>

<p>"You know, Chief," Jeffery was saying, "I should be kicked for
not guessing before. Everything about this poor woman points to the
protracted use of drugs. The sallow complexion, the bad teeth, and
the excessive thinness&mdash;all are outward signs of the vice. And
her nervousness, her frequent lapses into hysteria, her heavy
smoking of cigarettes&mdash;see how it all fits in?"</p>

<p>"Does it, by God!" Read snapped. He was taking the brandy from
the constable. "Damned if it fits in at all to me!"</p>

<p>Blackburn did not answer. He was refitting the lighter, minus
the capsule-case. His movements were abstracted as though his mind
was elsewhere. Donlin, who was wetting the unconscious woman's lips
with the spirits, spoke from the divan.</p>

<p>"I think she's coming round, Chief."</p>

<p>They moved across the room. Gloria Gray was lying motionless,
her long eyelashes sweeping her cheeks. As they approached, the
lashes fluttered, parted to reveal dazed blue eyes. They moved from
face to face and came to rest upon the lighter in Jeffery's
fingers. The sight roused her; the blood flamed into her ashen
cheeks and she half raised herself from the divan. Then, as if the
effort was too great, she dropped back and closed her eyes again.
Her breathing was deep and laboured.</p>

<p>"So"&mdash;it was little more than a hopeless sigh&mdash;"you've
found..."</p>

<p>Read's face was very grave. He nodded. "Yes, Miss Grey. We've
found it."</p>

<p>For some seconds the woman lay relaxed. Then with a sudden
clenching of her hands she sat up. Her eyes were filmed and dark
with tragedy. There was utter dejection in the sullen curve of her
mouth, the droop of her shoulders. Jeffery found himself pitying
her&mdash;so old, so tired and pitiful was her appearance. Defiance
had dropped from her like a cloak; her surrender, complete and
unconditional, revealed itself in her next words.</p>

<p>"Now that you've found out about the dope, you might as well
know the rest. It can't matter now." Her tone was one of bitter
resignation. "I've nothing to be ashamed of, although you might
think differently. I'll tell you the whole story."</p>

<p>She was leaning forward now, elbows on her knees, eyes fixed on
the door. After an interval, the woman continued:</p>

<p>"I lied when I told you that I hadn't moved from this apartment
last night. I lied again when I told you I had never spoken to
Sheldon. I've spoken to him too often&mdash;known him and feared
him." Her voice climbed a key. The hatred that burned darkly in her
eyes seemed to rack her whole wasted body as she screamed:</p>

<p>"He's dead and I'm glad! Glad&mdash;d' you hear? Glad! The dirty
rotten damn' dope-pedlar!"</p>

<p>From something approaching frenzy, she quietened, lapsing again
into hopeless apathy, eyes moodily on the carpet. Her words,
however, caused a mild sensation in that room. Read started and
glanced toward Jeffery, who was nodding to himself in mute
satisfaction. The two plain-clothes men stared at the actress,
incredulity written large upon their faces. The Inspector bent down
and touched her gently on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're speaking metaphorically..." he began.</p>

<p>Gloria Grey roused herself. The face she turned toward him was
bitter. "Metaphorical hell!" she sneered. "Sheldon has been
supplying heroin to at least a dozen women, including myself, for
the past six months to my knowledge." As Read started to speak: "Oh
yes, I know it sounds far-fetched, but that was the beauty of his
rotten schemes. Who was likely to suspect a High Court judge of
peddling dope to women? And we wouldn't talk! No, sir! Why should
we? We were sure of getting a regular supply without risk. That was
all that mattered..." Her voice trailed away. The effort seemed to
exhaust her. She leant back panting, with eyes closed.</p>

<p>Read nodded to Donlin, who poured the remainder of the brandy in
a glass and placed it in the actress's hand. She sipped at it
thankfully without moving her position.</p>

<p>Jeffery took the Chief Inspector aside and a whispered
conversation took place.</p>

<p>"Don't you see how perfectly it all fits in now?" the younger
man was saying. "The continued visits of the women, the secrecy
about the room with its one key and its locked windows, the long
periods of silence on the part of Sheldon, probably when he was
allocating the drug. It all dovetails completely. No wonder he paid
Hoskins to keep quiet about the visits of the women! He wasn't
taking any chances, you see?"</p>

<p>Read nodded sombrely. "It's incredible&mdash;but it must be
true, Jeff. Remember how that Sheldon girl spoke of her
stepfather's secret vices? She'd apparently heard rumours about
this business." He broke off as an idea struck him. "But&mdash;son.
If Sheldon kept this dope in his apartment, how was it that we
discovered nothing when we searched the room?"</p>

<p>Jeffery's eyes were gleaming. "That's a most important point,
Chief. It may be that the dope is still there, hidden&mdash;let us
say in some secret drawer. But I think there's more to it than
that." He took his companion's arm. "I believe that, in some way,
Sheldon had a bad fright on the morning of his murder. Remember
what Hoskins told us about the Judge's movements that
afternoon&mdash;how he heard Sheldon's pacing up and down, and how
nervous he looked when he came out of the room? I believe he gave
that manservant the evening off&mdash;not his customary evening,
remember&mdash;with deliberate intention. "He wanted a clear coast
to remove all traces of his horrible trade. You see, Chief, he
couldn't destroy anything in that apartment...there was no
fire-place for one thing. And we mustn't forget that mysterious
telephone call received by Val Sheldon. That must have some
important bearing on the case."</p>

<p>The Inspector grunted. "Seems to me that the further we probe,
the more complicated it gets. We'd better see the Commissioner
about this drug business." He shook a foreboding head. "There's
going to be quite an amount of dirty linen washed before this case
is finished."</p>

<p>He moved back to the divan, to find Gloria Grey sitting up. The
inevitable cigarette was between her lips and she seemed to have
recovered her poise. Read drew up a chair opposite her and sat
down. His voice was kindly, but firm.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Grey. We want the whole truth about your movements on
the night of the murder."</p>

<p>The actress shrugged her shoulders, eased herself to a more
comfortable position, and drew a deep preparatory breath. "Okay,"
she replied, and her tone held something of her former animation.
"But it's a long story and I'll have to go back three months before
the murder to make everything clear to you."</p>

<p>She paused to draw on her cigarette.</p>

<p>"It was about that time when my contract with the Honeymoon
Hotel company ran out. Things being tough in the legitimate, I
found another job hard to get. I had got into
the&mdash;er&mdash;habit some two years before. There's no game on
earth so wearing as the stage racket&mdash;no time for meals and
little time for sleep, grinding all the morning at rehearsals and
trying to appear fresh and bright at matinees and evenings. Two
years ago, I was doing second lead in 'Hollywood Girl,' and it was
either dope or go under. I took the easiest way. On top of losing
my job, I had another bad blow. The man who regularly supplied me
disappeared"&mdash;she snapped her fingers&mdash;"just like that.
Then it was that another girl in the company introduced me to
Sheldon, and from then on it was just the matter of a weekly
visit.</p>

<p>"So three months ago, I found myself a lady of leisure. But I
dare not take the risk of leaving Melbourne to look for an opening.
For one thing, with the Centenary celebrations coming, the managers
were casting several new shows. But, most important, I wanted to be
near my source of supply. For two months I hung about the agencies.
All I got was the usual hooey&mdash;oily smiles and promises. Then
I determined to risk all in a gamble. I knew the value of a good
address, so I took rooms in this place. It was handy to my source
of supply, too. But it was devilishly expensive, and even a few
weeks were sufficient to burn a hole in my wad, which, believe me,
was mighty slender."</p>

<p>She paused. Reaching over to brush the ash from her cigarette, a
crooked smile played about her lips. It faded as she continued.</p>

<p>"Matters came to a head about two weeks ago. My money had just
about run out. I was thinking of packing my grips, when an agency
rang me to say that they had a job. Would I take the chief solo
part in a choir for a Tent Mission? They were rather apologetic
about it&mdash;it was a come-down, but the money was good and
steady. I needed that cash, needed it like hell! So I jumped at the
chance and made an appointment straight away to meet my new boss,
who, they said, was an evangelist by the name of Torrance.</p>

<p>"I went down to see him that afternoon. He had just arrived in
the city and turned out to be a stocky little man with a long black
beard&mdash;a real Child of Israel. With him was another, a
nasty-minded scarecrow named Hillier. They looked me over, heard me
sing, and after the try-out I was engaged. I had to sing three
solos every night. So I signed the contract in true legal style and
went out of the evangelist's hotel thanking my stars that I'd
fallen on my feet. It gave me a kick, too. Imagine it&mdash;me
singing sacred solos in a Tent Mission!"</p>

<p>She flashed them a bitter smile. No one spoke, except that
Jeffery nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"At the end of the first week," the actress went on, "I began to
suspect that Torrance was taking a deeper interest in me than mere
business called for. From the first performance, he insisted that I
take supper with him in his tent. Then he began to buy me little
presents. At the end of the first week he was ringing me up in the
morning asking to take me to lunch and dinner. I didn't mind that.
He was mealy-mouthed, dirty, and not too mentally
balanced&mdash;but his money was as good as any other man's. So
long as he didn't want what every sugar-dad wants sooner or later,
it was all right with me. And when he came to the pawing stage, I
meant to put this small foot down once and for all!</p>

<p>"Last Sunday night&mdash;that's six days ago&mdash;matters began
to move in a direction I didn't like. We were sitting in
Torraftce's tent having supper after the choir when suddenly he
grabbed me and started playing catch-as-catch-can all over the
divan. What annoyed me was the fact that he wouldn't come out in
the open with it&mdash;he kept on mumbling about the Song of
Solomon and how I was young and fair and was born to be his
handmaiden. I began to get frightened, for this Israelite had the
strength of an ox. Just as I was about to scream for help, the
skeleton-faced Hillier walked into the tent. He gave one look and
scuttled out of the tent as though devils were after him."</p>

<p>Inspector Read put a quiet question when she paused. "You say,
young lady, that this Torrance was a strong man? Would you say that
he was stronger than the average man?"</p>

<p>"I certainly should," the woman replied promptly. "Look here!"
She pulled back the sleeve of her gown. On her upper arm were a
number of small bruises. "See that? It's where he grabbed
me&mdash;and those bruises are a week old."</p>

<p>She readjusted her sleeve, and Jeffery prompted: "What happened
after Hillier saw this episode?"</p>

<p>Again that hard smile shadowed her lips. "It shook Torrance more
than my most fervent remonstrances," the actress told him. "He
dropped me and sat back, mumbling about how he loved me and why
couldn't we be married and carry out the great work together and so
on until I felt absolutely sickened. I'm far from being a saint,
but this hairy-chested old hypocrite just brought out the worst in
me! I jumped up and bawled at him. 'I'll tell you why we can't be
married,' I told him. 'Because the like of you would spit on a girl
if you knew the truth about me.' Then, because I had absolutely
lost my head, I told him about the dope. But it only made things
worse. He fell on his knees, he raved and moaned and beat his head
until I was afraid to stay in the tent. I slid off and hurried back
to this place, where I sat down to do some pretty fast
thinking.</p>

<p>"My first thought was to keep as far away from the mission as
possible. Then I realized that Torrance couldn't sack me until my
contract was up. Sleeping on it made a difference. Next morning I
determined to see it through. When I put in appearance at the
mission, however, Torrance was busy. I ran across Hillier in his
tent, and he began putting the kind-father stuff over on me. I told
him to mind his own business. Then he turned and began to abuse
me&mdash;called me names that no woman would stand. I gave back as
good as I got and there was a fine old scene. It ended with Hillier
swearing that he'd have me stoned from the camp.</p>

<p>"I wasn't sitting down under that! I'd tear up my contract
first! I rushed into Torrance's tent to tell him so. But he was
surprisingly humble about it. Begged me to stay on&mdash;offered to
raise my contract salary&mdash;promised to make Hillier apologize
to me. He seemed so genuine that I relented, for, after all,
breaking my contract meant going back on the bread-line. Then
Torrance asked me to have lunch with him. He was so decent about it
all that I couldn't refuse. That was a stupid decision. No sooner
had we sat down than he began his old ravings. Told me that I was a
brand to be plucked from the burning. Swore he would find out who
was supplying me with the drug and smite him with the Vengeance of
the Lord! Vowed that he would cleanse my body and soul&mdash;and
then, carried away by his eloquence, he grabbed me in his arms and
began pressing kisses all over me."</p>

<p>Gloria Grey broke off with a little shiver. Blackburn was
following her recital closely, and he found himself stirred to
something akin to pity. This woman, hard, bitter, and even immoral,
was certainly no credit to her class, yet there was no doubt that
her story was sincere. She was moving on, speaking in short
staccato phrases that were unusually vivid.</p>

<p>She wiped her mouth with a quick trembling gesture.</p>

<p>"It was terrible," she whispered. "He held me close&mdash;so
close I could not move. His lips were wet, drooling. My face was
crushed into his beard and it smelt of stale oil. His fingers were
twined in my hair. He was beside himself with, his own crazy
passion. God knows what would have happened to me. Suddenly he
relaxed and I twisted free just as he was trying to strip my blouse
from my shoulders. I was mad with fear and rage. There was a large
china vase filled with flowers on a cabinet near the couch. I broke
from him and ran to it. He came after me, shoulders hunched, arms
groping. With all my strength, I brought this vase down over his
head, and it smashed into half a dozen pieces. Torrance dropped in
his tracks&mdash;black-out! I grabbed my hat and pulled my dress
into some kind of order and beat it from that tent as fast as I
could. I didn't rest until I'd got in here and looked the door. I
just dropped on to the bed crying with fear and exhaustion and
horror. I felt sickened, revolted, as though I'd been mauled by
some slimy reptile..." She broke off, panting a little. Her
cigarette burnt away unheeded in her trembling fingers.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Read was first to speak.</p>

<p>"Was that the final break, Miss Grey?"</p>

<p>The actress nodded. "On my part&mdash;certainly!"</p>

<p>"And when did this take place?"</p>

<p>"Last Monday morning&mdash;five days ago."</p>

<p>Read nodded. His voice was quiet. "Thank you. And what happened
then?"</p>

<p>Gloria Gray closed her eyes as though trying to arrange her
thoughts. When she spoke again, her voice was steadier and more
controlled.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear another word from Torrance until Wednesday
morning&mdash;the morning of the murder. I was taking breakfast in
bed about nine o'clock when the telephone rang. I answered it.
Torrance was at the other end! But it was not that so much as what
he said that made my heart go tipsy. He told me he had found the
source of my drug supply and that he was going to save me in spite
of myself. I was horrified. I begged him not to be stupid&mdash;but
he had rung off. You can imagine my feelings! Once Sheldon realized
that someone else knew of his trade, it would be the end of my
supply. I didn't care a damn for the man's reputation&mdash;the
swine used to bleed us white with his prices. But I just had to
have the stuff. After what I had passed through during the last few
days, I should have gone crazy without the drug to steady me.</p>

<p>"All that morning I lived through an utter hell of suspense. I
couldn't think what was the best course to take. Then I made up my
mind to warn Sheldon. About eleven o'clock I rang his rooms. He
wasn't there. I tried his club, found him, and told him what had
happened. He was furious and slammed the receiver down without even
a word of advice. Next I thought to reason with Torrance. I 'phoned
the mission&mdash;only to learn that he had gone out that morning
raging like a lion. Then I knew that he meant to kill Sheldon! God
grant that I never pass through an afternoon like that again. I
paced up and down, up and down, making schemes and discarding them.
I must try and protect Sheldon, but how was I to do it?</p>

<p>"And then came the night."</p>

<p>The woman's tone dropped and fear shadowed her thin face darkly.
She had crushed out her cigarette and spoke with her eyes fixed on
her clenched fingers, twined tightly in her lap.</p>

<p>"Dinner was served at seven. But it was a mockery of a meal to
me. After it was over, I lay down on this couch and tried to read a
novel. It was useless; I couldn't concentrate. Once Torrance got
religion into his head, he was mad enough to do anything. At nine
o'clock I could stand it no longer. I knew that if Torrance made an
attack, he would choose Sheldon's apartment across the corridor. I
felt I must warn Sheldon to keep away from there. But how was I to
give that warning? Perhaps Torrance had already struck&mdash;if so,
I dare not take the chance of being seen near the Sheldon
apartment. Then it was that I decided to ring. I did, but there was
no answer. Then the girl on the switchboard told me that Sheldon
had gone out just after dinner and, to my horror, she finished,
'I'll call you when he comes back, Miss Grey.' She had recognized
my voice&mdash;the very thing I wanted to avoid! Now, if inquiries
were made, I was sure to be implicated.</p>

<p>"But I was relieved to find Sheldon away. If only he would stay
away for to-night, I could see Torrance in the morning and talk him
out of his crazy ideas. But the Judge might return! The more I
thought of it, the more I realized I must warn Sheldon not to come
near his apartment to-night. I could 'phone his home. But I dare
not use the room telephone a second time&mdash;the switch-girl
would be listening. So I threw on a few clothes and walked down
Elizabeth Street to the booths in the post-office.</p>

<p>"I rang the Sheldon home, and a voice, obviously that of the
maid, told me Sheldon was not at home. Then another voice&mdash;I
recognized it as Miss Valerie Sheldon's&mdash;spoke to me. I had
met her once or twice in the Judge's apartment. I dare not take the
chance of her recognizing my voice, so I adopted an old stage trick
and dropped my tone to a harsh baritone. To make the business more
puzzling, I pretended to confer with somebody in the booth. I
delivered the warning, hoping against hope that it would be of some
use. As I came out of the booth, the clock in the tower chimed
nine-thirty."</p>

<p>Inspector Read exchanged a quick glance with Jeffery. The woman
did not notice it. Her dark eyes, staring into space, were dilated,
and she was obviously living over the events of that night. Her
tone was little more than a whisper when she continued.</p>

<p>"I walked slowly back to this building. It must have been almost
ten minutes to the hour when the lift-boy brought me upstairs and I
began to walk down the corridor. Just as I was about to enter this
room, I glanced down at the Sheldon apartment. I went cold all
over! The bedroom door of his apartment was open and there was a
light shining behind it. Then all my warning had been for
nothing&mdash;Sheldon had returned and was actually in that room.
In that moment I thought of nothing save one final effort. I must
get him away before it was too late. I crept toward the bedroom
door. Just as I stood outside, a horrible thing occurred. The door
began to open, slowly, cautiously. The next moment, a face was
thrust out. I had a second's glimpse of a tangled black beard and a
pair of wild, staring eyes! Then it vanished and the door was
slammed again.</p>

<p>"I almost fainted on the spot with sheer horror. How long I
stood staring at that closed door I don't know. It must have been
only a few seconds, but it seemed like years. One thought hammered
at my mind. I had to know what Torrance had done. Without stopping
to think, I pushed open the door and walked into the bedroom.
Everything seemed all right there. The door of the inner apartment
was open and the lights were blazing. I crossed to the door and
halted in the opening."</p>

<p>Dramatically she paused and turned her wide eyes to the
listening men.</p>

<p>"That room was empty of any living soul! I can swear to that on
any Bible! It seemed unbelievable, incredible! Ten seconds before,
I had seen that man standing at the door, and now the room was
empty. Then I saw Sheldon. He was sitting behind his desk, his body
limp and his head lolling forward on the glass top. For one moment
I thought he must be asleep. Then it came to me that this pose was
too rigid, too unnatural even for sleep. Sheldon was dead! And
Torrance had struck him down! With a cry, I turned and flew out of
the room and into this apartment. Dragging off my clothes, I
slipped into pyjamas in case the alarm should be raised. But I
couldn't sleep. I spent the night walking and smoking. I felt too
weak and ill even to cry. I had been through too much!</p>

<p>"I stood the suspense until morning. I took a cup of coffee for
breakfast, then dressed and went down to the mission. They told me
that Torrance had not been seen since the morning of the previous
day. I spent all the morning trying to trace him, and early in the
afternoon returned to the mission. I went straight to Hillier's
tent and faced him with the fact that I had seen Torrance's face in
Sheldon's bedroom the night before. We quarrelled about it:" She
raised her eyes, glanced from Read to Jeffery. "We were at it when
you gentlemen came to the tent.</p>

<p>"There isn't much more to tell. I spent all yesterday afternoon
trying to find Torrance, but it was useless. Returning home about
midnight, I found that somebody had been through my rooms. But I
was too tired to worry&mdash;I dropped into bed and slept like a
log. But the search had frightened me badly. I woke early and
packed my trunk, intent on getting away as soon as possible." Again
her eyes flitted from face to face and dropped. "Yes. I lied about
that Perth job. God knows I wish it were true!" Abruptly her voice
broke. She was crying softly.</p>

<p>A sympathetic silence brooded for some minutes. Jeffery was
scribbling in his notebook. At length the Inspector gave a short
cough.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Grey," he said gently. "You have cleared up
quite a number of points. Now, there are just a few questions..."
He paused. "When Torrance rang to say that he had discovered the
source of your drug-supply, he did not actually mention the name of
Sheldon?"</p>

<p>Gloria Grey wiped her eyes with a furtive gesture and made an
attempt to regain her self-control. She shook her head. "No. But I
naturally took it for granted that he meant Sir Merton."</p>

<p>Read nodded thoughtfully. "And you could not swear, feature for
feature, that the face you saw in the doorway of the bedroom was
that of the evangelist?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No...I couldn't," she admitted. "Except for
the beard and moustache, of course, You see, I only glimpsed the
face for a split second before he slammed the door."</p>

<p>"And the shoes? I take it you had no idea that there were
bloodstains on the soles until we pointed them out to you? Didn't
You notice that you were standing in a pool of blood when you
looked into that inner room?"</p>

<p>The actress shuddered. "Thank God&mdash;no! That would have been
the last straw. As it was, I was so upset that such a thing never
occurred to me. When I came back to my apartment that night I just
kicked them off and left them lying on the floor." She looked up
rather timidly. "Sorry I was so hipped when you came in&mdash;but
I'd been through hell. I didn't feel like being over-polite to
anyone, let alone the police."</p>

<p>The Inspector received her apology with a quiet nod. Jeffery,
notebook in hand, came forward.</p>

<p>"Would you mind checking over the time element in your story,
Miss Grey?" he asked. "It's really most important." He handed her
the note-book, and the woman ran her eyes over the pencilled
lines.</p>

<p>The actress nodded and handed back the book. "That's correct,"
she told the young man. "Although, of course, all those times are
approximate&mdash;say within a few minutes either way." That
crooked smile returned. "Naturally, I didn't wait to clock myself
with a stopwatch."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded, slipping the book into his pocket.</p>

<p>Read took up the questioning. "We progress," he announced,
rubbing his hands. "When you saw the body of Sheldon behind the
desk, were the windows open or shut?"</p>

<p>"They were shut."</p>

<p>"And the body lay with its head fallen forward on the desk?" He
thrust a finger at the woman. "You're positive on that point?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely!" She gave a shiver. "I'll never forget that
horrible picture!" As she spoke, it seemed that the events of the
night swept before her again. Lassitude gripped her and she lay
back with closed eyes. Her face was haggard. "I'm very tired,
gentlemen. Do you mind if I rest? I've told you everything I
know."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Grey. I think that will be all." The Chief
Inspector was scribbling on one of his cards. "You will, of course,
hold yourself in readiness in case we want you." He looked up and
gave her one of his rare smiles. "And, because you have helped us,
I want to help you." He passed across the card.</p>

<p>The actress took it and read the inscription. "Dr. Vernon
Montrose. Collins Street." A sudden enlightenment flashed across
her face. The blue eyes sparkled, and in that moment Gloria Grey
looked almost pretty. Her voice was choking, husky. "You think he
can&mdash;can...?"</p>

<p>Read nodded gravely. "He has cured many cases," he told her. "I
think you can hope for the best. Even now it is not too late."</p>

<p>In a group, the men moved toward the door and out into the
corridor. There Jeffery halted, turned back into the room. The
actress was staring at the card, her blue eyes filmed with tears.
But there was a light in her face that had been missing for many
months. The young man gave an awkward little cough. Gloria Grey
looked up.</p>

<p>"Pardon my persistence," Jeffery smiled, "but there is one last
point I'd like clear. You said that in some way Torrance had
discovered the source of your supply. Have you any idea how he
could have discovered this?"</p>

<p>The woman shook her head. "I'm afraid I can't help you there,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Was there any other person besides yourself and the other women
who knew or suspected that Sheldon was peddling heroin?"</p>

<p>Gloria Grey did not answer immediately. She seemed rather
reluctant to speak, but at length:</p>

<p>"Only one other person suspected, as far as I know."</p>

<p>"Ah! And that was...?"</p>

<p>The actress rose to her feet. "It was the Judge's own
daughter&mdash;Valerie Sheldon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>"It's about time," announced Inspector Read, "that we called a
temporary halt to see just where we stand in this case. Don't you
think, son?"</p>

<p>He addressed Jeffery Blackburn, who was sprawled in one of the
deep arm-chairs in the Sheldon apartment. The time was early
afternoon. After leaving Gloria Grey, Read had set about putting
out a widely flung net to trap the evangelist Torrance. O'Connor
and his men were dispatched on a similar errand to round up Valerie
Sheldon for a second interrogation.</p>

<p>The Inspector settled his bulk squarely against the desk. In his
hands he held a thick wad of papers, bound together with a
paper-fastener. He flicked over the neatly typewritten notes.</p>

<p>"We have as our victim in this case an apparently highly
respectable and greatly honoured judge in the high court of law,"
he began, "one Sir Merton Tenison Sheldon. This gentleman occupies
a town apartment away from his own home, which is some miles from
the city. On the morning of Thursday, he is found dead in this city
apartment. Alarm has been given through the fact that Sheldon's
telephone-receiver has been unhooked for some hours. Medical
examination proves that the victim has been stabbed in the back
with a sharp, thin steel instrument, the weapon penetrating the
heart and causing almost instantaneous death. This weapon, later
proving to be a paper-file prepared for the purpose, is found in
the drawer of a cabinet, where it was, presumably, tossed by the
murderer or murderess.</p>

<p>"But there are a number of highly mystifying points about the
murder of this man. The room is situated on the eighth floor of the
building. The windows, which are locked on the inside, look out on
to small balconies hanging over a sheer drop of ninety feet to the
ground. One of the victim's ears has been removed by a different
weapon. And&mdash;most puzzling of all&mdash;the door is locked on
the inside and the only existing key of the apartment is found in
the dead man's top-waistcoat pocket."</p>

<p>The Inspector paused. Jeffery was lying back in his chair, eyes
closed. Only the ceaseless tapping of his foot showed that he did
not sleep. "It's a pretty problem, isn't it?" he murmured. "And it
shows one thing plainly. That's long and careful
premeditation&mdash;a planning as careful and meticulous as a
novelist who plots a fictional murder." He gave a little sigh. "But
go on. We'll come back to that in good time."</p>

<p>Read rustled his papers. "Dr. Conroy's evidence places the time
of the murder within the vicinity of ten o'clock on the previous
night," he continued. "Now, from the evidence of the desk-clerk
downstairs, we learn that a few minutes after nine o'clock on that
night Sheldon came into the building with a black-bearded man, who,
for the purposes of simplification, we will call Blackbeard. We
have the testimony of the lift-boy that he took both men up to the
Sheldon apartment; from the same source comes the information that
Blackbeard was seen to go downstairs at twenty past nine. At a
quarter to ten, Sheldon, very much alive and apparently in the best
of spirits, talks to his stepdaughter on the telephone. Now, though
we have reason to suspect that Miss Valerie Sheldon is not quite as
blameless as she tries to appear, we have corroboration of this
telephone call by a surprising story that comes to light from the
actress Gloria Grey.</p>

<p>"In view of this woman's story, a number of apparently
irrelevant and isolated factors begin to fall into place. As we
know these points, it is unnecessary to categorize them. Instead,
let us attempt to reconstruct the murder of Judge Sheldon and the
events which led up to it from the information we have in
hand."</p>

<p>The Inspector tossed the typewritten notes on the desk and,
thrusting his hands in his pockets, began to pace about the room.
Blackburn, from his chair, followed the movements with half-closed
eyes.</p>

<p>"Sheldon was supplying heroin to a number of women, among whom
was Miss Grey," Read went on. "She, in the meanwhile, has
consciously or unconsciously attracted the amorous attentions of
her employer, an evangelist named Alfred Torrance. According to her
story, she tries to repulse him by telling him that she is a
drug-taker. Torrance learns, presumably from Val Sheldon, that her
stepfather is the source of the actress's drug supply. Just why
Miss Sheldon should tell a complete stranger this startling
information is answered by the fact that Torrance is, presumably,
not a stranger to the girl. He may be her own father, believed to
be dead in the war. This, however, is mere conjecture at the
moment. To return to our evidence, the evangelist swears to protect
Miss Grey even to the point of destroying the source of her drug
supply, and all our reasoning points to the inescapable fact that
if Torrance did not actually murder Judge Sheldon, he is the only
person with sufficient motive to have done so."</p>

<p>"Objection!" called Jeffery smartly from his chair. "Dozens of
'em, in fact! But to take the simplest&mdash;why should Torrance
murder Sheldon with a paper-file, of all things?"</p>

<p>The Inspector shrugged his broad shoulders. "How should I know?
Perhaps it was lying on his desk. Perhaps it was the first weapon
handy. Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, perhaps, always perhaps," sighed the young man.
"Ignore my censure, Chief. Go on."</p>

<p>The Inspector gave his barking cough.</p>

<p>"Leaving the business of the paper-file out for a moment, let us
follow out the other conclusions. On the morning of the murder,
when Torrance rings Miss Grey with the information he had found who
was supplying her with the drug, the actress communicated with
Sheldon. Now, from that point we can build our reconstruction of
what must have occurred.</p>

<p>"At the time of the communication, Sheldon must have been at
first annoyed, then anxious. Anxious not for his life&mdash;for he
had no idea that the evangelist had any personal enmity toward
him&mdash;but for his reputation, since he was sure that Torrance
would inform the police. We can visualize the Judge going to his
apartment straight after lunch, locking himself inside and spending
the afternoon pacing about, making plans and rejecting them. He
must dispose of his stock before the police make any
investigations. Once that move was completed, he could laugh at
Torrance, for who could possibly suspect a man of Sheldon's
standing without evidence to back up the charge? Eventually he
arranges for some as yet unknown person to take the drug off his
hands. Sheldon gives his man the evening off to prevent
interruptions, packs the heroin, and goes out after dinner to meet
this dealer. From the packet of banknotes found in his possession,
we may presume that cash was paid for the transaction."</p>

<p>Read halted before the desk.</p>

<p>"Sheldon returned to this apartment a few minutes after nine
o'clock. He was accompanied by a bearded man, evidence so far
pointing to Torrance as this individual. Remember how Blackbeard
was heard to say, 'I wont keep you long. It's a matter of utmost
importance'? Where Sheldon met Torrance and what the Judge did
between the hours of seven o'clock and nine o'clock must remain a
matter of conjecture. In any case, such information is not strictly
important at this time.</p>

<p>"Accompanied by Torrance, Sheldon came upstairs and entered this
apartment. Ten minutes later, Torrance was seen by the lift-boy to
start walking downstairs. But we have no evidence that he continued
to walk down into the foyer! Bear that in mind. In the meanwhile,
Gloria Grey was putting her call through to the Sheldon home,
which, in turn, was the cause of Val Sheldon ringing, her
stepfather at a quarter to ten. Now"&mdash;Read picked up the sheaf
of papers and thumbed them rapidly&mdash;"here is our time
schedule. Listen.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"9.5. Sheldon and Torrance enter this
building.<br>
9.10. Sheldon and Torrance enter this apartment.<br>
9.25. Torrance is seen by lift-boy on top of circular
staircase.<br>
9.28. Gloria Grey rings Sheldon home.<br>
9.41. Valerie Sheldon rings Sheldon apartment<br>
. 9.43. Valerie Sheldon finishes 'phone conversation."</p>

<p>The Inspector looked up and stabbed a forefinger at Jeffery.</p>

<p>"Torrance must have crept back into the bedroom while the Judge
was speaking to his stepdaughter. As soon as Sheldon replaced the
receiver, he called the Judge over to the door and stabbed him in
the back with the paper-file."</p>

<p>Jeffery leapt up from his chair. "Objection! Objection!" he
cried. "No, Chief! It won't do." He walked across to the elder man.
"Take a look at this room. This desk is twenty feet away from the
door. If the paper-file was standing on the desk, how on earth
could Torrance reach across that distance?"</p>

<p>Read frowned. "It may not have been on the desk, son. Torrance
might have brought it with him."</p>

<p>Jeffery made an irritable little gesture.</p>

<p>"No. That's hardly possible. Oh, hell!..." He paced the room for
a minute, then dropped back in his chair. "You see, Chief, the very
unconventionality of that weapon is annoying. It confutes all
arguments." He leaned forward. "For instance, if Torrance had crept
in here with premeditated intention of murdering Sheldon&mdash;and
this whole business was carefully premeditated&mdash;he would have
brought a knife, a revolver, or a bludgeon. Anything but that
damned paper-file! Even if Torrance committed the murder in a heat
of passion, he still wouldn't have stabbed the Judge with the
paper-file. If he saw it lying there and picked it up in a rage,
his impulse would be to swing it like a bludgeon and attack with
the weighted end. But we can entertain none of these theories,
because not only the crime but the actual stabbing was cool and
calculated. Remember Dr. Conroy's evidence."</p>

<p>The Inspector made a gesture of helplessness. "Point waived for
the moment," he muttered. "Where were we? Oh yes...</p>

<p>"After the stabbing, Sheldon dropped in the doorway. It was then
just after nine-forty-five. Torrance, for some reason, wishes to
leave a false trail and make us believe that the murderer entered
by the window. He carries the body to the desk, plumps it down into
the chair, lifts the desk and pulls the carpet aside, and is about
to place it in position covering the bloodstains, when something
disturbs him. He hears footsteps coming down the corridor and they
halt outside the bedroom. It is Gloria Grey returning to her
apartment after the telephoning, although Torrance does not know
this.</p>

<p>"He drops the carpet and stands motionless. The seconds pass.
Has the intruder gone? He must know! Cautiously he tiptoes to the
bedroom door, opens 'it, and peers out. Gloria Grey is standing
there, and he realizes that the woman has recognized him. He slams
the door and hides, presumably in the bedroom, which would offer
ample concealment. Miss Grey enters, crosses the bedroom, and looks
into this apartment. She sees the body of Sheldon behind the desk,
then turns and runs back to her own apartment.</p>

<p>"Torrance believes that she has gone to raise the alarm. He must
work fast! He moves back into this room, drags the carpet to cover
the bloodstain at the door, sits the corpse upright in its chair,
and drops the weapon in the cabinet drawer. All this could be
accomplished in a few minutes. Then, because he wants to make us
believe that the murderer came by the window, he goes to open that
window behind the desk. But..."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector broke off and faced Blackburn. He was
frowning, and the bewilderment on his face was reflected in his
moody tone as he continued.</p>

<p>"But he didn't open that window. Before he had time to reach it,
an interruption came. An interruption so startling and so
unexpected that it put every thought save flying from this room out
of his head. Now, figure that out!"</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. His eyes were gleaming. "I have figured it out,
Chief. I can tell you that it was an interruption that came from
within this very room. And it was of the duration of about one
minute. It couldn't have been a sudden momentary shock. It must
have occupied our murderer's time for at least sixty
seconds&mdash;if not more."</p>

<p>"How d' you know that?" Read barked.</p>

<p>The young man rose. "Listen, Chief! Gloria Grey was waiting in
her room, ears tuned to catch every movement in this apartment. If
the interruption came from outside&mdash;a knock or a voice
calling&mdash;she would have heard it, together with the footsteps
approaching the door. But she heard nothing of these things.
Therefore the interruption must have come from inside this room."
And as the Inspector nodded: "The second theory is more
intricate."</p>

<p>Jeffery was standing, his hands making jerky demonstrative
movements. "Remember, our murderer was in a hurry. Imagine his
state of mind! The actress, he believes, is raising the alarm
downstairs. He is caught in the room with the body of his victim.
He must fly before it is too late! But first to open that window,
which is an essential part of his plan&mdash;so essential that he
must do it! Now, if that interruption had been a momentary shock it
would not have prevented him from reaching the window, opening it,
and still having time to escape! But this interruption delayed him
for so long that, after it had ceased, so much time had elapsed
that he was afraid to linger in this room a second longer. And,
finally, this interruption somehow conveyed a disturbing
message&mdash;a message that frightened the murderer so much that
he rushed from the apartment, every thought of false trails driven
from his mind by this ominous warning!"</p>

<p>Jeffery paused and drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"In some way, Chief, a voice spoke to the murdered in this room.
A voice without a presence! A voice that gave the murderer a
message so unnerving that he ran out in blind panic without waiting
to complete his plans."</p>

<p>Read was staring at the young man with wide eyes. The scorn on
his face was tempered with an expression that almost approached
fear. Then he shrugged his shoulders and snorted violently:</p>

<p>"Tripe! Tripe! At least keep witchcraft out of this thing, son."
Jeffery paused in the act of lighting a cigarette. His eyes were
mild.</p>

<p>"You scoff at the very idea of disembodied voices, yet you have
been listening to them every day for the past ten years." He
smiled. "You hear one every time you answer the telephone!"</p>

<p>There was a silence. Read stared fixedly at Jeffery. "So!" He
drawled the word slowly. "So that's what you mean."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "Of course, Chief. There's only one way that our
murderer could have heard a message in this room that
night&mdash;and that was over the telephone-line." His voice became
animated. "Can't you see? The man knows he has only a minute or so
to make his getaway. He starts to cross to the window, when the
telephone-bell rings&mdash;loudly&mdash;insistently. Immediately he
is in a panic. Any person may hear it. For a second he stands
irresolute. Then, moving to the desk, he picks up the telephone and
answers the call.</p>

<p>"Then, across the wire, the unknown speaks and delivers a
message so startling that the murderer drops the telephone in sheer
terror and rushes out of the room without waiting even to pick up
the instrument from the floor."</p>

<p>Silence. The two men measured each other with a long, quiet
stare. Read dropped his eyes and turned away.</p>

<p>"The door was locked on the inside," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"Point waived for a moment," retorted Blackburn. "At this time,
we're more interested in that message. It must have been something
pretty startling. Our murderer, remember, is a callous, cool-headed
creature. It would take something very outlandish to frighten him
into a panic, you know."</p>

<p>The Inspector said tartly: "Perhaps you can tell me the actual
wording, since you know so much?"</p>

<p>Jeffery smiled. "Not the actual wording, Chief. But I think I
can get something approaching it. When the murderer picked up that
telephone and put the receiver to his ear, a deep, sonorous voice
spoke at the other end. And it said something like this:</p>

<p>"Many eyes are watching you! Your wickedness is known to all!
Beware! Retribution is close at hand and may strike you even as you
stand!"</p>

<p>Read nodded. "I can well imagine anyone who had just committed a
murder getting the wind up over a message like that," he admitted.
"But&mdash;this is the whole point of the matter&mdash;who could
have possibly seen Torrance commit the murder?"</p>

<p>"Nobody saw him commit the murder."</p>

<p>The Inspector's jaw hardened. "Say," he rumbled, "just what are
you trying to do to me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Chief, can't you see?" Jeffery was at the desk, thumping
his fist on the glass top. "Can't you see what I'm driving at? That
message over the telephone was meant for Sheldon!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It was meant for Sheldon," the young man continued. "It was a
call from someone who wanted to frighten the Judge, from a person
who had been brooding all day on the fact that Sheldon was a
dope-pedlar, and who adopted the sonorous voice and the lateness of
the hour to put the fear of God into the Judge." He stood back and
thrust his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"In other words, my dear Chief, the person who rang the Sheldon
apartment a few minutes after ten o'clock on the night of the
murder was our evangelist James Alfred Torrance!"</p>

<p>The Inspector's jaws dropped. In the tense silence the chimes of
the clock were heard, thin and far away, striking the hour of three
o'clock. Read drew a a whistling little breath, then, taking his
handkerchief from his sleeve, passed it over his ruddy face.</p>

<p>"Then this bearded man&mdash;the murderer in this room...?" He
broke off helplessly and glanced at Jeffery.</p>

<p>"The murderer in this room was no more James Alfred Torrance
than it was yourself," Blackburn finished quietly.</p>

<p>When he spoke again, his tone was lighter. "But we've got a
start! Now let's try to prove beyond all doubt that Torrance could
not have been in this room on the night of the murder."</p>

<p>He crossed to the desk telephone and put through a call to the
foyer. "Would you ask Miss Meynell to step up here, please?" he
asked. He hung up the receiver and spoke to Read. "You've got that
enlargement of Torrance's photograph, Chief?" And as the other
nodded and handed the print across Jeffery pushed the Inspector
into a chair. "Just sit down there and let me do the talking."</p>

<p>When the desk-clerk appeared, the young man greeted her with a
smile. "We'll not keep you long," he promised. "Remember your
evidence about the bearded man who accompanied Judge Sheldon on the
night of the murder? Would you take a look at this photograph and
tell us if this is the same man you saw?"</p>

<p>The girl took the print and scanned it. She looked up and shook
her head. "No. That's not the man." Her tone was assured. "The
person in this photograph is older than the man I saw that night.
And shorter&mdash;more stockily built." She stared at the print
again, then handed it back with a decided shake of her head. "No.
They are two different men altogether."</p>

<p>"You're sure?" Jeffery pressed.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," Miss Meynell said shortly.</p>

<p>Blackburn dismissed the girl with a word of thanks and put
through a call to the telephonist in the desk downstairs. Was she
on duty on the night of the murder?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Could she remember if a call came through for the Judge shortly
after ten o'clock.</p>

<p>Yes. A call had come through, and Sir Merton had forgotten to
replace his receiver. She had flashed his apartment at intervals
through the night without result. In the morning she had reported
the matter.</p>

<p>Blackburn hung up and turned to the Inspector. He spread his
hands. "There you are, Chief. Just as simple as that. And you were
going to hang the crime about the neck of an innocent man."</p>

<p>The Inspector thumbed at his pipe. "It's all very ingenious,
son," he admitted. "But where does it get us? We're right back
where we started. Admittedly, we've smoothed out a few wrinkles,
but we've formed others in their place. We're still face to face
with the fundamental problems of the murder. Take the four
outstanding questions. How did the murderer leave a room that was
locked on the inside? How did the key get into the Judge's pocket?
What's the motive for all this? Why was Sheldon's ear taken?"</p>

<p>Jeffery shrugged his shoulders and turned away. Something of the
Inspector's discouragement had communicated itself to him, and just
in time he checked the sharp remark that rose to his lips. The
pause was interrupted by the entrance of O'Connor, who strode into
the apartment with frowning face. He crossed and nodded to
Read.</p>

<p>"We've landed that evangelist, Chief," was his greeting. "But if
you want to question him, you'll have to take a ride. He can't be
shifted."</p>

<p>The Inspector jumped to his feet. "What do you mean&mdash;can't
be shifted?"</p>

<p>"We discovered him in the Sisterhood of Light hospital,"
O'Connor explained stolidly. "About ten o'clock on the night of the
murder, he was stepping out of a telephone-booth and started to
cross the road, when a motor-car smacked him. Broke both his legs.
They drove him to the hospital and he's been there ever since."</p>

<p>Jeffery Blackburn spoke quietly. "Where was this
telephone-booth?"</p>

<p>"It was down at St. Kilda beach."</p>

<p>"And almost four miles away from the scene of the crime." He
turned to the Chief Inspector. "It looks as though our main suspect
is definitely out of the running." He smiled wryly at his
friend.</p>

<p>"Don't let anyone tell you, Chief, that there is no such thing
as a perfect alibi."</p>

<p>O'Connor gave a perfunctory little cough and jerked his head in
the direction of the bedroom.</p>

<p>"We picked up that Sheldon dame," he said to Read. "She's
waiting out in the corridor now. Want her in here?"</p>

<p>Read nodded. The detective moved out of the room to reappear a
moment later with Valerie Sheldon. A leather driving-coat with a
heavy furred collar was belted about her. Without waiting for an
invitation, she crossed the room and sat down in a vacant chair,
pulling off her driving-gloves. Her eyes moved from face to face.
They came to rest on the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked calmly. "Aren't I off your suspected list?"
Read faced her. Abruptly he asked:</p>

<p>"Is Alfred Torrance your father, Miss Sheldon?"</p>

<p>The girl raised her eyebrows. A slow smile broke across her
face. She began folding her gloves in a neat pair on her lap.</p>

<p>"So that's it?" Her voice was level, controlled. "I thought that
you would probably unearth something in that direction. One of the
disadvantages of a murder investigation is the complete
impossibility of having any private life. Every small action, no
matter how simple or trivial, is spied upon and dragged out for
public autopsy."</p>

<p>"All this is scarcely an answer to our question, Miss Sheldon,"
Jeffery reminded her.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;come on!" The Inspector was in no mood for evasion.
"Was Torrance Lady Sheldon's first husband?"</p>

<p>Valerie Sheldon raised her eyes. "No. He was not!" She threw the
words at them one at a time. "Mr. Torrance is a complete stranger
to our family."</p>

<p>Read shot a forefinger at her. "Then what is your photograph
doing in his tent?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;that?" The girl shrugged her shoulders. "I gave him
that photograph to see if it could recall any recollection of his
past. And that was why I visited him at the mission. You see, I
thought there might be a chance of his being something connected
with the family history." She shook her head. "But it was a
failure." Again the smile shadowed her lips. "However, I'm just as
glad. As a father, I should say Mr. Torrance would make a very good
evangelist."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. He asked quietly:</p>

<p>"But why should you go on believing that your father is still
alive, Miss Sheldon? Surely you didn't conduct this search on the
mere suspicion that his reported death was a mistake?"</p>

<p>The girl took a cigarette from her case and lit it. She pulled
off the tiny beret that had clung to one side of her head, and
settled herself more comfortably in the chair. "I'll tell you
everything," she said, after a pause. "Whether it will help you
with your investigation, however, is another thing.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know why it was that Mother clung to the idea
that my father's death was wrongly reported. To my mind, there was
something psychological about it. Mother received such rotten
treatment at the hands of Sir Merton that she simply had to have a
refuge, a sanctuary. She made this the idea that some day her first
husband may return and deliver her from the hell that was her life.
Not that she really believed it&mdash;rather, she made herself
believe it. That's my explanation, anyhow. You can supply your
own.</p>

<p>"But the idea, right or wrong, was merely passive until twelve
months ago. Then something happened that made it an active force in
Mother's life. One night, for the fun of the thing, she and I
visited a spiritualist. We had a sitting, and during the seance,
the medium told Mother that her husband was not dead, that he would
return to her within the year." Val Sheldon frowned over the
recollection.</p>

<p>"Looking back on it, I suspect deliberate trickery. The medium
must have learnt of Mother's unhappy life and manufactured this
information. However, false or true, it made a great difference to
Mother's existence.</p>

<p>"From being merely a vague longing, the idea of Father's return
became an obsession with her. She began living for the day when
such an occurrence actually came true. And she spent a small
fortune on attempting to trace him. Private agencies were employed.
Every missing person advertised in the newspapers was followed up.
I begged her to give up the scheme; but it was too deeply
ingrained. An Idee fixe. And then, about six months ago, we
happened to read that a man who had lost his memory in the war was
coming back to his home in Victoria, searching for his family. That
was enough for Mother. She was positive it could be only one man!
She began to count the days until that man arrived in
Melbourne."</p>

<p>The girl paused and made a little gesture with her cigarette.
"Well, he did arrive. Mother dare not do any inquiring on her own,
so I had to do it for her. I wrote to Torrance and asked him to
meet me, saying that I believed he could throw some light on our
family mystery. Three days later, Torrance rang me, telling me to
come to the Mission Camp. I went, taking with me a photograph of
Mother and one of myself. We stayed talking together, Mr. Torrance
and myself, took lunch together, and I left about six o'clock in
the evening. Although I was satisfied that this man was a complete
stranger to our family, I determined to give the business a final
test. I would take Mr. Torrance to our home next morning to meet
Mother.</p>

<p>"The meeting next morning was a complete frost. Mother gave not
the faintest sign of recognition. A half-hour's talk convinced her,
too, that this man was a stranger. I drove Mr. Torrance back to the
encampment. And that, gentlemen, was the last I saw of Mr.
Torrance."</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded. "Thank you, Miss Sheldon." He thrust his
hands in his pockets and jingled his keys for a moment, then turned
back to the girl. His tone was cautious.</p>

<p>"There is another rather unpleasant little matter that has come
to light regarding your stepfather. It has been proved, only too
conclusively, that he was carrying on a rather shameful traffic. A
traffic in drugs."</p>

<p>Val Sheldon gave a quick intake of breath, then bit her lip. It
was obvious that this last information had at last pierced her
armour of self-control. She played with her gloves with nervous,
uneasy fingers. "So you've found that out, too?" she said
softly.</p>

<p>It was Blackburn who answered: "You knew&mdash;of course?"</p>

<p>The girl raised her eyes. "I've known for months," she told
him.</p>

<p>Read put the question: "In some way, Miss Sheldon, we believe
that Torrance also discovered it. Was that through anything you
might have inferred?"</p>

<p>"I suspected that he knew," Val Sheldon replied. "He must have
heard it from one of the women whom my stepfather was supplying.
But he did not know conclusively. During our conversation Torrance
asked me, quite abruptly, if it was true that Sir Merton was
dealing in the drug-traffic. I was so horrified that he must have
read the truth in my face. Then I began to deny the accusation so
emphatically that I'm afraid I only convinced him the more."</p>

<p>She gave that old crooked smile. "And now that I've been so
frank I might as well tell you the rest. Remember how I came into
this room on the morning of the murder discovery? You probably
wonder what brought me here?"</p>

<p>"You came to see if the police had unearthed the family
skeleton, didn't you?" Jeffery asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes! When I heard that the police were actually in my father's
apartment, I was frantic with anxiety. I was sure that a search
would reveal the drugs. I just dashed away from home without any
fixed plan. I thought I might get a chance to remove the drug
before the police found it. Or, at the worst, I would know if the
police had discovered it. You thought I was callous, didn't you?
You didn't realize how I was holding myself in under tremendous
strain. That if I let myself go, I'd just have a
screaming-fit!"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, crushing out her cigarette. "And added to
this was a cold, bitter rage against my stepfather for the rotten
mess he had dragged the family into. I meant every word I said in
that direction." She began pulling on her gloves. "I know that it's
wrong to bear malice, but before you slap the handcuffs on that
murderer, I'd rather like to shake his hand." She paused and added:
"Will that be all now?"</p>

<p>Read's voice was very quiet. "Yes, Miss Sheldon. That will be
all for the time. And thank you."</p>

<p>They watched here as she walked from the room, very neat and
self-assured. The Inspector turned back to Jeffery. "A remarkable
young woman," he commented. "I can't make up my mind whether I like
or dislike her. One thing I know. I shouldn't care to have Valerie
Sheldon for an enemy. She has a quick tongue, that young
woman."</p>

<p>"And a quick brain," added the young man. "You've never read her
detective-stories, I take it? Her plots are amazingly ingenious. It
must take her months of careful plotting and planning to work them
out. She's an expert at the 'perfect murder' theory."</p>

<p>Something too subtle to be called an expression crossed the
Chief Inspector's face. "Just what do you mean by that, son?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" The young man spread his hands. "But we've got to
remember and consider every possibility, Chief. And there's another
thing."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"We've spent too much precious time working on the theory that
murder is man's work alone. I wonder why our minds leap to the
conclusion? We rarely think of cold-blooded murder in connection
with a woman. And yet our drama, our history, and our criminal
records are studded with female assassins. Take Lady Macbeth and
Luceriza Borgia. You can't draw hard-and-fast rules when it comes
to murder, Chief. Murder is an abnormality, and the abnormal mind
cannot be measured by known standards."</p>

<p>He was standing by the desk. The contents of Sheldon's wallet,
returned from headquarters, lay on the desk. Jeffery was turning
over the different articles. He paused with the newspaper-cutting
in his hand, was about to replace it, when something caught his
eye. He examined it closer, turning it over in his fingers. Then he
gave a low whistle of surprise and faced Read.</p>

<p>"Take a look at this cutting, Chief," he said, passing it
across. "What do you see?"</p>

<p>Read glanced at the report. "I see a slip of newsprint about
seven inches in length, a report of Torrance's arrival, that has
been folded in four places."</p>

<p>"But you're missing the most significant fact," Jeffery pointed
out. "Remember that newspapers, for the purposes of economy, are
printed on both sides." He took the cutting from his companion and
held it up.</p>

<p>"Notice how the report of the evangelist's arrival is folded on
the outside and is so worn that it is almost illegible through
contact with the wallet? Now, we agreed that the report printed on
this slip must be of interest to Sheldon, otherwise he would not
have kept it. Therefore, Chief, if that Torrance report was so
important to the Judge, would he not have folded that report on the
inside to protect it from wear and tear? But, in this case, we see
it folded on the outside.</p>

<p>"Consequently, the Torrance report could not have been the
important thing. It was the report folded on the inside that
interested the Judge&mdash;this report that is almost as fresh as
the day on which it was printed!"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector crossed to his side as he straightened out
the cutting. Together they scanned the story printed on the back of
the Torrance report.</p>

<p class="newspaper">OSCAR DOWLING DEAD!<br>
GUARD FINDS BODY<br>
Strange Wounds on Throat</p>

<p>Following the report was a single-column photograph, a horrible
image of pale, staring eyes looking out from a face seared with
lines of cruelty and passion. Blackburn shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"Definitely a criminal type. Look at that shortened
skull&mdash;brachycephalic!" He began folding the cutting. "Now,
why should the Judge cherish a six-months-old report of the death
of a criminal lunatic? And how strange that this death should be
reported on the same day as the arrival of the evangelist!"</p>

<p>Read flung himself down in a chair. His face was dark and
frowning, his tone moody.</p>

<p>"I'm sick of it, Jeff," he confessed. "Heartily sick and tired
of it! We've been forty-eight hours on this crime and we're no
nearer the solution than when we started. Every time we make a move
it's in the wrong direction. Every time we discover a lead-line it
brings us up against a dead wall! Honestly, son, I'm beginning to
despair of ever getting to the bottom of this damned business."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>Miss Bertha Fenton lived in an apartment in a block of flats,
"St. Ives," situated on the Dandenong Road.</p>

<p>It was nearing twelve-thirty when Bertha drove her two-seater
car into the garage at the rear of the building. A Saturday
afternoon free from office duties is a luxury for those who work
upon a weekly paper, but this woman was a privileged person. She
seemed very satisfied with herself and hummed a tuneless lay as she
climbed out of the car, collected her bag, and slammed the door of
the garage. A few minutes later she was letting herself into her
apartment.</p>

<p>The woman crossed to the bed and dropped her bag and hat on the
satin coverlet. From here she moved to the tiny kitchenette and,
opening the door of the ice-chest, peered inside. It was almost
empty. Bertha gave an ejaculation and glanced at her wrist-watch.
Twelve-forty-five!</p>

<p>Hastily she smoothed her greying hair and walked outside.</p>

<p>Glancing right and left, she began to make her way across the
road. She had reached the opposite side when her eyes lighted on a
familiar figure. Some yards ahead of her and carrying a small black
bag was a man she had seen on the morning of the Sheldon murder.
Bertha had the true journalist's memory for names and faces, and
even as she stared at this man's retreating back his name came to
her. It was Hoskins, the Judge's personal man. Whatever was he
doing down here? Standing at the edge of the pavement, her peering
little eyes followed him. He was walking quickly, clutching the
black bag close under his arm. At an intersection he paused and
looked up and down the street. In a few moments he was joined by a
second man.</p>

<p>The woman strained her eyes to recognize the newcomer. But he
was standing with his back turned. The two men talked animatedly,
and the second individual was obviously asking a question, since
Hoskins nodded and tapped the bag under his arm. The men moved off
and were lost in the crowd. Bertha stood frowning for a space,
then, dismissing the matter temporarily from her mind, she turned
her attention to more pressing business.</p>

<p>The windows of the shops gleamed like ice and silver in the
reflected sunlight. Groups of shoppers passed and repassed along
the footway. Miss Fenton halted opposite a greengrocer's shop where
the piled fruit made gay splashes of colour against the sombre
green background of leaves and ferns. A carefully laid out pattern
of fat and juicy sugar-pears attracted her.</p>

<p>Have I time to slip in? she wondered. The grocery store was some
distance down the street on the opposite side of the road. She
crossed to the pavement edge and from here could see the doors were
still open and a steady trickle of customers moved in and out. She
nodded and walked into the fruiterer's shop.</p>

<p>Then she saw it! She clung to the counter as the shag swam in a
mist before her eyes.</p>

<p>Bertha Fenton had long prided herself on her perfect control,
her unshakable equanimity. But in that awful moment, horror drained
her body of strength and her mind of coherent thought. She who had
sneered at any feminine weaknesses came as near to swooning as had
ever been her experience. Every nerve in her body seemed throbbing
in wild protest against this terrible sight; there was a drumming
in her ears, and in her stomach a black nausea rose. Suddenly,
unexpectedly, she belched and felt better.</p>

<p>For some seconds she stood clinging to the counter with eyes
tightly shut. Then, opening them, she leaned forward and took a
second look at the body, holding her breath as though doing some
unholy thing. It was a man, she could see that, although the face
was partly turned away, and the body was mutilated beyond
description. She wormed her way around, still clinging to that
solid counter, until she could take in the details of those
half-hidden features. In that moment recognition came.</p>

<p>The dead and mutilated body belonged to Ted Biggs, the cheerful,
florid-faced, good-naturedly vulgar Ted Biggs, owner of the
shop!</p>

<p>Now that the first shock of horror had passed, Bertha could look
upon that torn and crimsoned body more calmly. The curious position
of the right arm caught her eye. Her glance travelled down from
shoulder to elbow...from elbow to wrist...and there it halted,
frozen...</p>

<p>The right hand was missing! The arm finished in a stained pulp
at the end of the wrist!</p>

<p>In the flash of that discovery, all her horror returned, all her
sickening panic. The nausea in her stomach rose uncontrollably,
surged into her head, blinding, throbbing. With a harsh scream
Bertha Fenton rushed from the shop, and was violent and
undignifiedly ill in the street outside.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>Ten o'clock on that Saturday morning saw Martin Yates sitting in
the untidy room that the Associated Press dignified with the name
of an office. He was seated at his desk, staring thoughtfully at
the littered pigeon-holes before him. In a small ante-room, his
assistant rattled a rusty typewriter. She lifted her fingers from
the keyboard as Yates called from his office.</p>

<p>"Give Chief Inspector Read another ring, Miss Routledge,
please."</p>

<p>For the tenth time that morning the young man dropped his eyes
to the dirty crumpled sheet of paper on the desk before him. It was
a section of manuscript paper, and upon its surface were pasted
strips of typewritten cable. This cable was ten years old, but it
was not its antiquity which caused the reporter to handle it so
carefully. Once more he smoothed the surface and read the
information contained in those typewritten lines.</p>

<p class="newspaper">Unparalleled scene Sy P C to-day Rudolph

<p>For the benefit of the Chief Inspector, Yates had ordered his
assistant to retype a more lucid construction of the cable. This he
placed on top of the ancient document. The translation read:</p>

<p class="newspaper">An unparalleled scene was witnessed in the
Sydney Police Court to-day when Rudolph Heulier was sentenced to
twelve months' hard labour for an attack upon Miss Rosa O'Malley, a
dressmaker. Heulier made threatening statements from the dock
toward Chief Justice Sheldon, who had passed the sentence upon
him.<br>
<br>
"You'll pay for this!" he screamed from the dock. "You'll pay for
this if I have to wait a lifetime! I'll have my revenge!" The court
officials managed to prevent a demonstration just in time. The
prisoner was carried screaming from the court. Heulier, who is
believed to be a religious fanatic, is a thin-faced man with wild
eyes. His attack on Miss O'Malley was unjustified, as he accused
her of being associated with street-walkers.</p>

<p>As Martin Yates raised his eyes from the printed lines:</p>

<p>"The Chief. Inspector will be right over," came Miss Routledge's
voice.</p>

<p>The young man thanked her, and, reaching across his desk, pulled
a sheet of paper toward him. Picking up a pencil, he tapped it idly
for a moment. He wrote quickly:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Hillier<br>
Hoskins<br>
Val Sheldon<br>
Gloria Grey<br>
Torrance<br>
?</p>

<p>He was still frowning over the names when Miss Routledge
announced the Chief Inspector. Read, his figure moulded inside a
well-tailored grey double-breaster his moustache clipped against a
face rather paler than usual, entered and nodded as Martin rose to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Read," the young man invited. "You'll be
interested to know that I've run across something in this office
which I believe may have an important bearing on the Sheldon
murder."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector took the proffered chair. Martin pulled out
his pipe and began to fill it. Read sat with fingers clasped about
his crossed knees. Yates spoke again, raising his eyes over the
pipe-bowl.</p>

<p>"One of the first jobs I tackled was the cleaning and sorting of
a quantity of old cables that had been filed away in dusty corners.
I was finishing off the business this morning when I ran across a
file marked 1925. I glanced through the collection, and one
particular cable happened to catch my eye."</p>

<p>He broke off and pushed the sheet of paper across to the
Inspector. "I sorted it out from the others. Here it is. I think
you'll be interested."</p>

<p>Read glanced at the paper, frowned, and looked up. "What is it?"
he asked gruffly. "A code?"</p>

<p>"Sorry." Martin pushed across the translation. "That's Press
economy in cable-sending. This will make it easier."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector began to read, perfunctorily at first and
then with deep interest. Yates sucked at his pipe, his quiet eyes
on the other man's face. At length Read looked up.</p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Martin shrugged. "You've got to supply the answer to that." Read
dropped his eyes to the paper on the desk. "Ten years ago," he
murmured. "A thin-faced man with wild eyes name Heulier..."</p>

<p>"Or Hillier," suggested Martin quietly.</p>

<p>Read stretched his long legs and sat back, tossing the paper on
the desk. "But where does it get us?" he wanted to know. "Certainly
it gives us suggested motive. But the whole case reeks with
suggested motives. Assuming that Rudolph Heulier is our
evangelistic Hillier, he may have killed Sheldon out of revenge,
just as Val Sheldon may have murdered her stepfather out of sheer
hatred. For the same motive, Alfred Torrance may have engineered
the murder, although we know that it was impossible for him to have
actually committed it. What we lack is a definite centralized
motive! Once we can find that, we can get a start from that
point."</p>

<p>"I quite agree," Yates nodded. "All the same, it wouldn't do any
harm to check up on Hillier's movements on that night."</p>

<p>Read sat up. His voice had taken a grim note. "I'm going to. I'm
going to get the movements of every person who entered or left that
apartment within twelve hours before or after the murder." Abruptly
he leaned forward and fired the question at Martin.</p>

<p>"Where were you, Mr. Yates, on the evening of the Sheldon
murder?"</p>

<p>The young man's mouth gaped. His pipe dropped on to the desk and
scattered a shower of sparks. He stared at his companion in
amazement, then a slow smile broke over his face. "What is this,
Inspector? The theory of the least-suspected person?"</p>

<p>The severe lines of the Inspector's face did not relax. "I asked
you for an account of your movements on the evening of the
murder."</p>

<p>Yates flushed at the inflexion in the voice. Then he shrugged
his shoulders and picked up his pipe. "You'd better get your
handcuffs ready, Inspector," he said wryly. "I spent the night
walking about the streets, and I passed within range of the Oates
where Sheldon was murdered perhaps half a dozen times." He paused,
to add quickly as Read opened his mouth: "No, I was unaccompanied
and I met no one whom I knew. In other words, you have only my bare
statement that I did not go into the Carnavon."</p>

<p>"Just a bare, unsubstantiated statement?" There was an odd note
in Read's voice.</p>

<p>Martin's teeth bit on his pipe-stem. "Yes," he said measuredly,
and was silent. And as the Inspector continued to stare at him, he
took the pipe from his lips. His voice, touched with anger, leapt a
note.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what are you going to do about it? I've told you the
truth! I'd like to be able to prove that I was in hospital with
broken legs like Torrance, or playing bridge at home like Val
Sheldon, or conducting a meeting before seventy witnesses like
Hillier&mdash;but I can't. I was walking those streets alone
because I had been working inside a stuffy office all day! Now,
make a case out of that if you can."</p>

<p>"Listen to me!" Read shot out a forefinger. "That murder was
committed with a paper-file&mdash;a paper-file that was specially
brought to that apartment for the killing. I don't forget that
reporters use paper-files, and I'm not going to forget that
reporters can commit a murder just as easily as they can report
one." He rose to his feet. "I think that's all, Mr. Yates."</p>

<p>"Just a moment!" Yates was on his feet. "An accused man always
has a chance to prove his innocence, I believe? Well, I'm going to
turn detective! I've been thinking pretty deeply over this thing
and I've come to one definite conclusion." He picked up a slip of
paper from the desk and thrust it before the Chief Inspector. "The
guilty person is somewhere among those people. And I'll prove it to
you!"</p>

<p>Read ran his eyes down the six names, and his lip curled. "So
you've actually come to that conclusion," he said pleasantly. "The
killer is among that list." He nodded with an expression too benign
to be genuine. Abruptly it was wiped away.</p>

<p>"Listen, you!" he barked. "Go ahead and nuzzle about for
yourself. But if you print anything without our official sanction,
the great God help you!" He gave the young man a stiff little bow
and walked out. Martin heard him slam the door of the office. He
shrugged his shoulders again and pressed the bell on his desk.</p>

<p>Miss Routledge pushed a long face around the door. "You rang?"
she said.</p>

<p>Martin nodded. "Miss Routledge," he announced solemnly, "you see
standing before you the cruel and bloodthirsty slayer of judge
Sheldon. At any tick of the clock stout gendarmes may manacle my
wrists and I may be dragged down this corridor to the scaffold!"
His face broke into a smile. The expression on his secretary's face
was too amusing.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Yates." Miss Routledge's tone was profoundly
disapproving. "Such foolishness, indeed!"</p>

<p>"In this mad maze, who can say which is foolish and which the
sane?" quoted Martin. "But I really called you in to ask you to get
Wilkinson of the 'Courier' on the telephone for me. I must tell him
to cook up a good alibi for the night of the murder!" He grinned
again. "And then you can go home."</p>

<p>Two minutes later Miss Routledge called. "Mr. Wilkinson is not
in his office. Any message?"</p>

<p>"No thanks. You might try Gilbert Lascelles at the 'Globe'
office."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Yates."</p>

<p>Two minutes passed. Then: "Mr. Lascelles is out too!"</p>

<p>Martin clicked his tongue impatiently. "Good lord! What it is to
have a job on a daily! All right, Miss Routledge, let it go. You
can toddle off now."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Yates."</p>

<p>Somewhere a clock struck the half-hour. The young man heard his
secretary bustling about as she tidied her desk and prepared to
depart. He answered her good-bye rather absently, for his mind was
busy with the Chief Inspector's suggestions. From there his
thoughts moved to his secretary's reports, and abruptly he leapt to
his feet. His pleasant face was grey. Then he shook his head.</p>

<p>For some seconds he stood there undecided. Then with a swift
movement he crossed to the pegs and slipped on his brown coat and
hat, and locking the office door behind him strode off down the
corridor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>The business of the late Edward Biggs was a double-windowed shop
with a frontage of some twenty feet on to the footpath. Entrance
was made through swing-doors, narrow-panelled, with centres covered
in with wire gauze. At one side of the shop a small alley ran to a
blind end. It was here that the market carts unloaded the fruit and
vegetables for the business, and these were taken in through a side
door that led from the shop into the lane. The proprietor lived on
the premises, occupying rooms built on to the back of the store. As
was later ascertained, Mr. Edward Biggs was a bachelor, forty-five
years of age, and well liked and respected in the neighbourhood. He
had a reputation for honesty and for being generous to the
children. He had no enemies, having lived an obscure and quiet
existence that rarely took him outside his shop. Hobbies he had
none, recreations but few, and among these might be classed a
fondness for detective-stories, an occasional glass of ale and
stout, and an infrequent visit to the talking pictures. Summing up,
Mr. Biggs was an unobtrusive, pleasant gentleman leading an
unobtrusive, pleasant, and methodical existence. He was certainly
the last person in the world one would have imagined to meet his
end in such a brutal and horrific manner.</p>

<p>Three o'clock on that fatal Saturday afternoon found the little
store besieged by an army of the morbid-minded numbering such
strength as would have appalled the limelight-shunning Mr. Biggs
had he been alive to see them.</p>

<p>Inside the dark, green-smelling shop, Jeffery Blackburn and
Chief Inspector Read stood talking quietly together in the shadows.
They were watching the precise movements of Conroy, who was
kneeling beside the body with sensitive nostrils wrinkled in
distaste. Read tugged nervously at his moustache, and his florid
face was almost as grey as the bristling adornment. He kept
glancing uneasily and frequently at the younger man, almost as if
he expected censure from Jeffery's lips. Blackburn stood with
folded arms, his thin lips set and his eyes shadowed with horror.
His long fingers tapped restlessly on his upper arm.</p>

<p>The plain-clothes men were there, silent like their superior.
O'Connor, Donlin, and a Detective Bartlett made an awkward triangle
just inside the door. In another group stood the reporters: Bertha
Fenton, her pallid face almost green in the reflected light and her
eyes red-rimmed with tears produced by the shock of her discovery,
Martin Yates, Gilbert Lascelles, and a grey-haired man from the
'Courier,' relieving Wilkinson on his day off duty. There was a
heavy, swollen silence, something approaching the hush of death,
yet too electrical and lacking the resigned reverence of that
state. It was an atmosphere strangely in contrast with the snapping
efficiency that opened the discovery of the Sheldon death. So quiet
was it that Jeffery's tapping finger, beating against his arm,
could be plainly heard...tap...tap...tap...</p>

<p>Martin Yates moved closer to Lascelles and whispered: "How did
you get in on this?"</p>

<p>"Bertha put me wise on the 'phone." Gilbert's lips barely moved.
"I was back in the office. I tried to get you, but you were
gone."</p>

<p>"I was down at the detective office. Sheerest stroke of luck.
Popped in to inquire about the Sheldon murder. Just as I got inside
the door, I heard them talking about this, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sssh!" Gilbert hissed a quick warning. Martin, glancing up, saw
the Chief Inspector, his face dark, glaring across at them. There
was silence for a few moments. Then Gilbert murmured:</p>

<p>"This business seems to be getting the old man down. He came
over to my office this morning and practically accused me of
murdering Sheldon. Wanted to know my movements on the night of the
murder and did I have a perfect alibi, and if not, why not?"</p>

<p>Yates smiled with tight lips. "The worry seems to have turned
his head. He came to me with the same request, and I told
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before he could continue, Read wheeled sharply. "If you can't
stop that whispering, get outside!" he snapped. "And don't come
back!"</p>

<p>The reporters looked suitably abashed. At that moment Dr. Conroy
rose to his feet. Hands on hips, he stood looking down at the body,
shaking his head slowly.</p>

<p>"Messy job!" He spoke quietly, as though to himself. Glancing
up, he saw the collective eyes upon him. He addressed the Chief
Inspector. "When you clap the irons on this beauty, I'd like to
have his brain for my research work. Your killer looks like a case
for the psychiatrist rather than the hangman."</p>

<p>Read's rejoinder was almost a snarl.</p>

<p>"Optimist, aren't you, Conroy? First catch your hare..."</p>

<p>"Pretty beastly, isn't it?" Jeffery spoke from the shadows.</p>

<p>Conroy inclined his head. His voice, whether by accident or
design, was flat and unemotional. "I have counted fifteen
stabbings," he reported primly. "There may be&mdash;probably
are&mdash;more. The greater number are inflicted in the region of
the stomach and the groin. From a cursory examination, I believe
the majority were inflicted after death. I may be able to tell you
more about that after the autopsy." He made a pernickety gesture of
distaste and turned away to face the detectives. "This is not borne
out by a close examination, gentlemen, but there is one rather
interesting fact about the murder. I believe that that unfortunate
man was killed in much the same manner as Judge Sheldon&mdash;by a
strong upward knife-thrust which found the heart first time!"</p>

<p>There was no comment. Strangely enough, no one felt surprised.
Read shrugged his shoulders. There was a certain hopelessness in
his voice as he asked: "What of the other wounds, Doctor?"</p>

<p>Conroy linked long white fingers. "Inflicted with a similar
instrument to that which made the initial thrust&mdash;a long,
thin, sharp weapon. I should say that this man was stabbed from
behind and his body fell to the floor. The murderer must have knelt
over it and stabbed away in blind fury." He paused.</p>

<p>"Death took place instantaneously&mdash;within a few seconds of
twelve-thirty."</p>

<p>A mild commotion agitated the quiet air. Read spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"But without an autopsy, Doctor, how can you
possibly&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The medical examiner's tone was dry as he interrupted. "No
autopsy needed to fix that point, Read. Just taking a leaf out of
your own book. See this?" He bent down and lifted the left hand of
the body. "A wrist-watch. Smashed as he dropped to the floor. Hands
point to half past twelve."</p>

<p>Jeffery came forward. "The most important point, Doctor, is
whether, from your examination, you can say if this crime has
anything to do with the Sheldon murder, or if it is a separate
killing. Can you?"</p>

<p>Conroy clasped his hands behind him and swayed on his toes.</p>

<p>"That's hardly my work," he said testily. "Anyhow, here's your
points of similarity. Method of killing, pointing to knowledge of
anatomy. Wounds made by weapon similar to that used to remove the
Sheldon ear&mdash;looks like a scalpel. And don't forget that in
this case the right hand is missing." He was looking down at the
body. As Read gave a thin sigh, he glanced up. "Odd, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Anything else, Doctor?" queried the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Only a small cut on the lower portion of the chin, at one side
of the lower lip. Little more than a scratch really. Made by some
sharp object pressed tightly and breaking the skin. That abrasion
might be, and probably was, caused by a ring on the murderer's
little finger. When he pressed his hand over the victim's mouth to
prevent an outcry, the ring scratched his skin. That's all at the
present." A struggling at the door attracted his attention. "Here's
my boys now, Read. Can we shift the remains?"</p>

<p>Read nodded. At a signal from Conroy, two men came forward and
placed the body on a stretcher, covering it with an oilskin. With
three constables clearing the way, they shouldered their way
through the crowd, and with difficulty slid the stretcher into the
waiting police-ambulance. Inside the shop no one moved until the
hum of the receding vehicle died away.</p>

<p>The Inspector turned to O'Connor. His orders snapped like
whip-cracks. "Get a policeman to cover those bloodstains. Where's
that fat woman from next door&mdash;the one who had so much to say
when we came in? All right, get her in here! Listen, you reporters!
I want to see every line of that stuff before it's printed.
Understand?"</p>

<p>Gilbert Lascelles looked pained.</p>

<p>"But we print in half an hour, Inspector, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Read fixed him with a basilisk glare. "You heard what I said r
If you don't like it, get outside!" He turned away as Jeffery
touched his arm. "Well? What d' you want?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to poke about the shop," the young man asked. "May I
go ahead?"</p>

<p>"All right. All right! You don't want written permission, do
you?" Jeffery made a tiny grimace to the reporters and began
picking his way through the cases of fruit, pausing every now and
then to examine some object more closely. He was in the far corner
near the side door when Mrs. Myrtle Minnick entered.</p>

<p>The term "buxom" really applied to Mrs. Minnick. Everything
about her was plump, from her swollen-veined ankles to her
double-chinned face. The Chief Inspector addressed her sharply.</p>

<p>"You are the owner of the confectionery shop next door?"</p>

<p>The woman smoothed her apron and nodded three times. Her fat
chins quivered. "That I am," she responded. "Though how long I'll
own it, with young Bert smokin' the profits and the kids stealin'
from the ha'penny tray&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there!" Read snapped at her. "Save your sales-talk! We
didn't call you in to listen to that. I want to hear about this man
you saw in this shop shortly after noon to-day."</p>

<p>Mrs. Minnick flung up her head. She was plainly on her dignity.
"What about him?" she said stiffly.</p>

<p>"All about him&mdash;all about him! What was he like? What did
he do?"</p>

<p>The woman opened her mouth twice before words came. "If you mean
that he had anything to do with poor Mr. Biggs' murder, you're
wrong," she brought out. "With my own eyes I saw him standin' by
the door talkin' to Mr. Biggs, 'n' then he walked off down the
road."</p>

<p>The Inspector was pulling at his moustache. "You mean that Biggs
was still alive after the man had left?"</p>

<p>"Mister Biggs," replied Mrs. Minnick, with faint emphasis on the
title, "was alive." She paused, and, as the man opposite her
obviously expected more information, she added: "From quarter to
twelve until close on one o'clock I was standing outside my shop.
No one else went into this place after that man went away. If they
had, I would've seen them." Her tone added silently: "So there, Mr.
Rudeness&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Read stared at her keenly for some seconds. "Let me get this
thing clearly," he said slowly. "You say that a few minutes after
twelve o'clock to-day you saw a man come out of this shop with
Biggs, stand talking to him for ten minutes or so, and then move
away, while Biggs re-entered this shop? From that time onwards, no
person entered this place?"</p>

<p>"You 'ave it right," Mrs. Minnick assured him.</p>

<p>The Inspector shot out a stabbing forefinger.</p>

<p>"Then how come that he was found brutally murdered half an hour
later?"</p>

<p>The large woman collapsed on to an empty fruit-case, her massive
bosom heaving. "Lord bless me! I don't know." She stared at him
with wide china-blue eyes. "You surely don't think...Why, we've
been best o' neighbours for years, we have. Never a
cross&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;of course!" Read wiped her trembling
remonstrances aside with a gesture. "What did he look
like&mdash;this man?"</p>

<p>"That I can't say very well. He had his back to me all the time
an' he walked in the opposite direction to what I was. But he wore
a brown suit and was clean-shaven, I could see that."</p>

<p>"And did you hear what they were talking about?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Minnick hesitated. "Well," she admitted, "as a matter of
fac'..." And then she stopped. But the expression on the Chief
Inspector's face spurred her on. "Not that I'm a woman to listen to
what's a private conversation, but there was a lull in the traffic
once and those two were talking pretty loud. That man was saying to
Mr. Biggs: 'I say you're just a fool. He won't even stop at
murder!'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" Read barked.</p>

<p>The woman nodded complacently. "Them's the words," she repeated.
"Just as I heard them, plain as plain!"</p>

<p>"And what time did this man leave Biggs?"</p>

<p>"At exactly quarter past twelve," came the prompt answer.</p>

<p>"Oh." The Inspector was savagely genial. "So you happened to see
his wrist-watch?"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Mrs. Minnick rose, not without difficulty, from the
fruit-case. "I know because I heard the whistle at the Woollenside
Mills just as he left. It always goes off at quarter past twelve on
Saturdays."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector raised his voice. "Any questions, son?"</p>

<p>From his position by the door, Jeffery called: "Did Mr. Biggs
have an assistant, Mrs. Minnick, or did he manage his business on
his own?"</p>

<p>At this unexpected voice from the shadows, the woman wheeled.
But Jeffery came forward and smiled disarmingly. "It's rather
important," he added.</p>

<p>The big woman thawed under Jeffery's smile. "He did," she
replied. "My own boy Bertie use' to come in an' give him a hand on
Friday afternoons and Saturday mornings. That was the busy times,
you see."</p>

<p>"Then why wasn't your son in the shop at twelve-fifteen?"</p>

<p>"Young Bert finishes at twelve, when the rush is generally
over," Mrs. Minnick told him.</p>

<p>Jeffery thanked her and moved back to the door leading into the
alley. Read nodded curtly to the woman. "That's be all now. And
keep quiet about what's been said in here&mdash;understand?" He
turned away. Myrtle Minnick rolled with rather unwieldy dignity
toward the door, paused to sniff disparagingly, and then
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Chief!" Blackburn called suddenly.</p>

<p>Read moved over to the alley door to find the young man pointing
to the Yale lock fixed to the inside of the jamb. He turned as the
Chief Inspector approached. His voice was very quiet.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in coincidence?" he asked. "Perhaps it may be
something deeper. Anyhow, you've heard the evidence up to date,
Chief. Now, take a lock at this door. Notice that it's locked on
the inside!"</p>

<p>"H'm."</p>

<p>"Doesn't anything strike you about this murder?" Jeffery asked.
"Mrs. Minnick was watching the front of the shop, therefore our
murderer could not have entered that way. This side door was his
only means of entry, and that is locked on the inside. In other
words, this murder was committed in a locked room from which every
entrance was barred!"</p>

<p>Read snapped his fingers. "Exactly the same layout as the
Sheldon killing."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "Of course! Is it coincidence? Has the apparent
success of that crime inspired another on similar lines&mdash;or is
this the work of the same person? Remember the taking of the hand
and Conroy's evidence about the method of killing?" He 'paused.
"What do you think?"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector flung up his hands.</p>

<p>"What am I to think? Although these crimes parallel in some
ways, in others they're Poles apart. Take, for instance, the social
positions of the victims&mdash;one a knight and the other a
tradesman. Again, while Sheldon was anything but a saint and
probably brought about his killing through his shady dealing,
nothing like that applies to this man. He was a quiet,
insignificant little unit without an enemy in the world. The two
crimes can't possibly be connected&mdash;unless the murderer is a
homicidal maniac..." He broke off as Jeffery gave an ejaculation of
impatience.</p>

<p>Read turned away. He called to O'Connor, telling him to bring in
the boy Minnick. As the big detective moved away on his errand, the
Inspector turned to Jeffery. The young man, cigarette between his
lips, was staring at a large bouquet of blooms hung near the door.
His forehead was creased in a puzzled form. The elder man, who knew
the signs well, said curiously:</p>

<p>"What's biting you now, son?"</p>

<p>Blackburn did not move. "Chief," he said quietly, "why should
our unfortunate shopkeeper&mdash;a gentleman, remember, who has a
splendid reputation for honest business methods&mdash;sell
tarnished camellia flowers?"</p>

<p>Read said tartly: "Come back to earth, son! What's that got to
do with this murder?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jeffery admitted. His tone was worried. "If I
did, I'd feel easier in my mind." He broke off to gesture upward at
the hanging bunches of white camellia flowers. "Take a look at
those blooms, Chief. Lovely specimens, aren't they? Yet some are
tarnished about the edges. Not all, certainly&mdash;but a few in
each bouquet."</p>

<p>He moved closer. "And they're fresh to-day. See, the stems are
wet from the picker's basket. And they can't possibly be damaged
stock, since they're marked, 'Prize Camellias, sixpence each.'"
Jeffery drew thoughtfully on his cigarette. "It can't have anything
to do with the murder, as you say&mdash;and yet, how could Biggs
ever hope to sell tarnished blooms at that price?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me&mdash;I've got other things to think about." Read
was walking back to the front door. "Besides, I'm not a
horticulturist. The only thing I can tell you about camellias is
that you can't touch the petals without&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Blackburn interrupted. It was a sharply drawn breath that
caused Read to wheel about. The young man was standing with clasped
hands, his face shining. "That's it, Chief! That's the answer! You
can't touch the sensitive petals of the camellia flower without
turning the edges black! Why didn't I think of it before?"</p>

<p>"But what is that to do with...?" the Inspector began.</p>

<p>"Everything," Jeffery told him. "It might even give us the
answer to the greatest question." He was staring at the blooms.
"Imagine it&mdash;a crime as carefully planned as this
one&mdash;shot up in the air by the petals of a camellia flower.
Who was it, Chief, that said no murderer could ever guard against
the unforeseen detail?..." He broke off as O'Connor entered with a
young lad about sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>"Here's the boy you wanted, Chief," the detective announced.</p>

<p>Jeffery grasped Read's arm. "Let me do the questioning of this
lad. I've got the craziest idea at the back of my mind. But first I
want to satisfy myself on one small point."</p>

<p>He crossed to the alley door, opened it, and peered out into the
lane. Returning, he pushed the door shut. The spring lock shot into
place with a soft click. Jeffery stood for a moment turning the
brass knob of the lock backward and forward, watching the lug
sliding in and out. Then he nodded. Hands in pockets, he strolled
over to where the boy was standing watching the proceedings with
wide eyes.</p>

<p>Blackburn smiled. "Nothing to be afraid of, Bert. We won't eat
you." He ran his eyes over the lad's gangling figure. "You were Mr.
Biggs' assistant yesterday afternoon and this morning?"</p>

<p>The lad nodded. "Yessir."</p>

<p>"And you were here this morning from what time?"</p>

<p>"From eight o'clock sir, when Mr. Biggs opened up this
shop."</p>

<p>"Good! Now, Bert, did your employer get in a fresh supply of
camellia flowers this morning?"</p>

<p>"That's right," young Minnick replied promptly. "Yessir. They
come in about nine o'clock. I helped Mr. Biggs check em' off. Six
bundles with twelve in a bundle, sir."</p>

<p>"Admirable," commented Jeffery. "I don't suppose any of those
flowers were tarnished when they were brought in here? None had
their petals blackened at the edges?"</p>

<p>"No, sir!" The lad shook his head. "Mr. Biggs&mdash;he was most
careful about that. Used t' look 'em over very closely, he did.
Wouldn't take a flower with the tiniest marking on it. Why,
sir"&mdash;Bert elaborated, warming to his subject&mdash;"he
wouldn't even let me hang up the flowers&mdash;said I'd be sure an'
spoil them."</p>

<p>"Most unjust, I'm sure," The young man nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"Those flowers, I believe, hung near the door that opens out on
to the alley?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Now, come over here, Bert." Blackburn led the way to the door
and gestured toward the hanging bouquets. "Those are the blooms
that came in this morning?" And as the boy nodded, he reached up
and took down a bunch, pointing to three tarnished flowers. "Then,
my Bert, how do you account for these damaged blooms?"</p>

<p>Bert Minnick stared at the disfigured petals. "Coo, sir. Jus'
look at them. They weren't like that when they come in this
morning."</p>

<p>"You're sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Pos'tive, sir! I had a look at them flowers before I left the
shop at twelve o'clock. They was all right then, too."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Jeffery pursed his lips for a moment. He moved on toward
the door, nodding to himself. "This side door, Bert&mdash;it's
always kept locked, I take it?"</p>

<p>The lad nodded.</p>

<p>"'Cept when the carts bring the fruit in, sir. That's about half
past eight or nine o'clock. I go t' help unload th' carts and bring
the cases in through this door. Then it's locked f'r the day.
Spring lock, y' see, sir. If you slam it, it locks itself."</p>

<p>Jeffery spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"And you're absolutely sure that you locked that door after the
fruit was taken in at nine o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Yessir! I locked it an' Mr. Biggs went an' had a look f'r
himself. He was always particular about that door, sir. 'Fraid
someone might come in an' pinch the till." Bert was very serious
over this possibility.</p>

<p>"Were those camellia flowers touched after your employer hung
them in position? Were any sold to customers?"</p>

<p>Again that positive shake of the head. "No, sir. I didn't sell
any and I would have seen if Mr. Biggs had of."</p>

<p>"Then tell me, Bert, how do you account for the fact that,
although those blooms were untarnished when they were placed in
their position&mdash;although, as you say, they remained untouched
during the entire morning, those flowers are now turning black from
careless handling?"</p>

<p>Bert Minnick said simply: "I dunno, sir."</p>

<p>There was a baffled silence. Disappointment was plainly written
on Jeffery's face. He lit another cigarette and turned away. He
paced up and down the narrow shop for some moments, Bert Minnick
following his movements with astonished gaze. Presently a thought
seemed to strike him. Jeffery turned back to the boy.</p>

<p>"During the morning," Blackburn said slowly, "was there any time
when this shop was left empty? When both Mr. Biggs and yourself
were away at the same time?"</p>

<p>Again the lad shook his head. "No, sir. There's too much of a
rush on Saturday morning for anything like that. The busy time
doesn't slacken off until about eleven o'clock&mdash;that's when
Mr. Biggs used t' have his morning tea." Bert paused and continued:
"He used t' boil the kettle on the gas-ring in the kitchen." He
gestured to the rear of the building.</p>

<p>"Then you were alone in the shop for&mdash;how long?"</p>

<p>"Between ten minutes and a quarter of an hour, sir."</p>

<p>Blackburn levelled a finger at the boy. His tone was
measured.</p>

<p>"Now, Bert&mdash;think carefully! While your employer was out of
this shop, did you leave it at all? Even for a minute?"</p>

<p>Bert Minnick spoke promptly. "No, sir. You see, I was serving a
customer all the time Mr. Biggs was away. He came in just after Mr.
Biggs 'ad gone out and he wanted t' see some nice bananas. Bought
six of them an' then..." The lad broke off, and a startled
expression flashed into his eyes.</p>

<p>Jeffery cried impatiently. "Yes, yes! What about him?"</p>

<p>Young Minnick looked uncomfortable. "By Golly, you're right,
sir! I did leave the shop, The chap I was serving gave me a
five-pound note to pay f'r the six bananas, an' as we'd run out of
change I had to slip into Mum's shop." His eyes sought Blackburn's
eagerly. "But I wasn't away more than a minute, sir."</p>

<p>Jeffery brought his fist down with a thump on the counter.</p>

<p>"At last," he murmured. Slowly, admiringly almost, he shook his
head. "God! What a brain!" He glanced at Read. "And you, Chief,
talk of homicidal mania!"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector grunted. "At least I talk sense," he
snapped. "Where's all this getting us?"</p>

<p>"To the identity of the mysterious banana-purchaser who wanted
to be alone," Blackburn retorted. He turned back to the lad. "Now,
Bert, I want to know everything about this customer."</p>

<p>Minnick screwed up his eyes in an effort of concentration.
"Well, sir, it must have been a few minutes after eleven when he
comes in. Mr. Biggs was in the back o' the shop. This man stands
for a moment lookin' round. 'Want somethin', sir?, I says. 'Yes,'
he said. 'I want t' buy some fruit f'r a sick friend, but I don't
know what kind.' So he starts t' walk aroun' the shop, lookin' in
all the cases. I called out, 'The bes' fruit's over on these
Stan's' sir,' and so he comes back t' th' counter and finally
decides on th' bananas.</p>

<p>"When I puts 'em in th' bag, he gives me this five-pound note.
'Got anything smaller?' I say. 'Sorry, no,' he says. 'Then you'll
'ave t' wait while I go out an' change it,' I tells him. Hardly
gone a minute, I was&mdash;and when I got back th' customer was
waiting at the door o' this shop. I gives him his change and he
goes off down the road. An' what d' you think 'e did with those
bananas?" Bert paused impressively. "He gives them to some kids
playing up the street."</p>

<p>"So?" Jeffery was drumming his long fingers on the counter. "Can
you give us a description of this customer&mdash;what he looked
like? You saw his face' of course?"</p>

<p>Bert Minnick looked doubtful. "Well, sir, I did and I didn't' if
you understand. He was wearing a long overcoat and he wasn't quite
as tall as you. But as for his face..."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You really couldn't see much of it at all, sir. This chap had a
curly black beard and moustache that just about covered it."</p>

<p>Blackbeard!</p>

<p>At the mention of that name which automatically sprang to the
lips, a ripple of excitement vibrated the tense atmosphere inside
the shop. Here was incontrovertible proof that the same dread hand
that had struck down Sir Merton Sheldon had shown itself for the
second time. But with this confirmation came the realization of
dismay. For this evidence served only to fog the situation to a
greater extent. Now that a definite connection between the two
crimes had been made, the dark enigma of the whole business weighed
on the investigators like a mocking incubus.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Read came forward and nodded to the boy. "And
that's all you can tell us about this customer?" he asked. His
bulldog manner had dropped from him. It was succeeded by a
hopelessness, almost an apathy, that contrasted strangely with his
former behaviour.</p>

<p>Young Minnick, impressed by the sensation he had made, was only
too willing to continue in the spotlight.</p>

<p>"That's all about him, sir. But the other man&mdash;the one who
came down to see Mr. Biggs after I'd gone, sir&mdash;I think he
rang up yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"You were here?"</p>

<p>"Yessir. About four o'clock I answered the telephone and a man's
voice wanted t' speak to Mr. Biggs. He went t' the 'phone, and they
talked for a few minutes. I heard Mr. Biggs say, 'Yes, I was
foreman on that job.' After a while Mr. Biggs said, 'Better make it
after twelve t' morrow. I won't be so busy then.' With that, he
rang off."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" Read demanded.</p>

<p>"Only that Mr. Biggs sent me up t' the 'Courier' office for some
newspapers, sir. He wrote some dates down on a piece of paper and
gave me three shillings. Told me t' be sure an' get the right ones.
'Bout half a dozen papers, there was, sir. When I got back, he took
them into the back rooms and began to read them."</p>

<p>Jeffery spoke quickly. "Where are those newspapers now?"</p>

<p>"They were in the dining-room when Mr. Biggs made 'is tea this
morning," the lad replied. "I saw them there."</p>

<p>"Good!" Blackburn seemed pleased. "Would you slip in there and
see if they're still available? If so, bring them out here."</p>

<p>Young Minnick moved away. The Chief Inspector glanced at
Blackburn. "I suppose you've reason for all this madhouse business,
son," he muttered. "Personally, it gets crazier every minute for
me. I've got to the stage when I expect to find our murderer flying
out of an apple in the form of a codlin moth!"</p>

<p>The young man smiled faintly. He crushed his cigarette-end under
his heel. "It's not quite as fantastic as that, Chief," he said.
"And all those crazy questions of mine have brought out one
definite point. We do know how Blackbeard entered this shop. He
came back about a quarter past twelve, after the first man in the
brown suit had left Biggs. But Blackbeard couldn't walk in through
the front door, because Mrs. Minnick was watching and would have
seen him."</p>

<p>"Then how in Thor's name did he get in?"</p>

<p>"He came in through that side door leading from the alley."</p>

<p>Read stared at the young man. "You're mad," he said simply.
"Quite mad. Didn't that young lad tell you the door was locked from
nine o'clock until we came along after the murder?"</p>

<p>"So was the door of the Sheldon apartment," Blackburn pointed
out. "But that didn't stop Blackbeard. Nor did it in this
case&mdash;because that side door wasn't locked all this morning.
Blackbeard opened that door ready to slip inside when he was left
alone in the shop!"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector started to speak, but Jeffery stopped him
with a gesture. "Come across to the door," he invited, "and I'll
show you just how it was worked."</p>

<p>Taking the elder man by the arm, he crossed to the side of the
shop, halting before the door. He began to speak quickly, making
swift, flying gestures to demonstrate various points.</p>

<p>"This side door was locked at nine o'clock this morning when the
fresh camellia flowers were brought in," Blackburn explained. "It
is a spring-lock, as you see, with a small button that can be
pushed up and down to hold or release the steel lug of the lock.
Right!</p>

<p>"Now, we must bear in mind that there was nothing haphazard or
unprepared about this murder. It was planned and executed with the
same careful skill as was shown in the Sheldon killing. Blackbeard
probably made a survey of this shop days ago. He then realized that
entrance through this side door was not only the safest way, but
also the most baffling. For this creature, Chief, plans his murders
with the direct intention of putting every available obstacle in
the way of the police.</p>

<p>"Blackbeard comes down to this shop shortly after eleven
o'clock. He sees that there is only a boy in the shop, but to
arrange for his mysterious entrance an hour later he must have the
place empty. So he works the trick of the change to get young
Minnick out of the way&mdash;even for sixty seconds. That was quite
long enough to accomplish what he had to do."</p>

<p>"Well, what did he do?"</p>

<p>"He crosses swiftly to this door," Jeffery went on, "and,
screwing back the steel lug of the lock, presses into position the
button that holds the steel lug into position and prevents it from
catching the lock! He then closes the door, which does not lock,
wedging it into position so that it cannot blow open and give his
scheme away. All this, bear in mind, could be accomplished in five
seconds. His only reason for anxiety was the make of the lock,
since, if it had not been a Yale, he could not have fixed it so.
But he found that out when he first came into the shop. Remember
how he wandered about on the pretence of examining the fruit.
Really, he was examining the lock. However, the door fixed and
entrance made easy, he crosses to the front door and waits for the
return of young Minnick."</p>

<p>Jeffery paused and eyed his listeners. He dropped his voice a
tone as he continued.</p>

<p>"At a quarter past twelve he returns to this shop. He creeps
down the side alley and slips in through the unlocked side door.
Biggs, in the meanwhile, is saying good-bye to the first man
outside the shop. Blackbeard has seen this as he approached, and it
is an unforeseen hitch to his plans. What if this first man and
Biggs decide to re-enter the shop? Concealment is necessary, and
what better position could there be than behind this pile of
fruit-cases near the door? But Blackbeard has overlooked one thing.
Hanging behind the cases near the door are a number of camellia
blooms. When the murderer crushes himself into this confined space,
his head presses against the petals. We know the result.</p>

<p>"Now, Biggs and his companion were talking fairly
loudly&mdash;so loudly that Mrs. Minnick, standing a dozen feet
away, could hear part of their conversation. And Blackbeard, less
than that distance, probably caught every word. As soon as Biggs
leaves the first man and re-enters the shop, Blackbeard is upon
him! In a few moments the unfortunate man is dead.</p>

<p>"Then the murderer crosses to the side door, pushes the metal
button on the lock back into position so that the lug is released,
passes through and slams the door after him. The side door locks.
And we are faced with another apparently inexplicable murder in a
locked building."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Read nodded. "Sounds feasible," he
admitted.</p>

<p>"It's the only possible explanation," argued Jeffery. "The
murderer couldn't have entered by the front without Mrs. Minnick
seeing him. Therefore the side door must have been used. Since
neither of the legitimate occupiers of this store had touched it,
some unknown agency must be responsible and have tinkered with that
door unseen by the occupiers. When young Minnick told me of the
shop being left empty, it was the second step in the process of
reasoning. The tarnished camellias, hanging about the height of the
man's head from the floor, were the first. And the identity of the
mysterious customer definitely clinched the scheme of
reasoning."</p>

<p>"Well, that's that!" announced the Chief Inspector. He turned to
where Bert Minnick stood waiting with a bundle of papers under his
arm. "You've found them? Good! Put them on the counter and then you
can go along."</p>

<p>As the lad obeyed and vanished through the swing-doors, Jeffery
crossed and began to spread wide the newspapers. "Almost a year
old,," he commented. "They're the papers giving an account of the
trial of Oscar Dowling. Remember it?" He was running his eyes down
the printed columns, thrusting his dark head close to the lines of
small type. Suddenly he gave a low whistle of astonishment. He
straightened and turned toward the watching group.</p>

<p>"We're getting hot," he announced. Excitement trembled in his
tones. "God! What does it all mean? Where is it leading us?"</p>

<p>He faced them squarely. "I've just realized what 'job' it was on
which Biggs was foreman. And instead of simplifying matters, it
only serves to complicate them all the more." He paused.</p>

<p>"For that 'job' was the trial of the criminal murderer Oscar
Dowling. And Edward Biggs was foreman of the jury."</p>

<p>There was not a sound in the dimly lighted shop. Jeffery waited
for a moment, then added slowly:</p>

<p>"And Chief Justice Sheldon passed sentence upon the
murderer!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Some hours later, Jeffery Blackburn and the Chief Inspector were
seated before the fire in Read's cosy cottage-flat overlooking the
river. Dinner over, they were taking coffee in their chairs and
reviewing the events of the day.</p>

<p>Read waved his pipe at Jeffery. "You scoff at the idea that the
murderer is a homicidal maniac, son. I disagree with you! The
motiveless lust for destruction that marks the crimes of a maniac
is surely uppermost in these murders. They can't be explained any
other way. Why, here are two men at the opposite end of the social
scale killed without rhyme or reason."</p>

<p>"But there is reason, Chief," Blackburn objected. "There's too
much reason."</p>

<p>"You might call it a bloody version of 'The House that Jack
Built,," said Jeffery. "Only in this case it would be framed
differently." He began to chant slowly: "This is the man who
murdered his wife who lived in the House that Jack built. This is
the Judge who heard the evidence that sentenced the man who
murdered his wife who lived in the House that Jack built. This is
the Foreman who told the Judge to sentence the man who murdered his
wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a roar from the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>"Say! What are you getting at now?"</p>

<p>Jeffery clasped his hands behind his head and stared up at the
ceiling. His voice was very quiet.</p>

<p>"I'm going to talk, Chief," he said. "You can listen or you can
doze off to sleep in your chair. I've got a dozen ideas seething in
my brain that must be whipped into some coherent order."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," invited Read grimly.</p>

<p>"Firstly," began the young man, "we must consider the surprising
evidence that turned up this afternoon. It's important. It's put
our inquiries on a completely fresh line. Consider it! A malignant
criminal, certified by prison doctors to be insane, is sentenced to
life imprisonment. Later this man escapes, is tracked down, and his
dead body discovered by warders. Months later, the same judge who
pronounced sentence upon him is murdered. And when the body is
found, one of the ears is missing&mdash;the right ear!</p>

<p>"A fortnight later, the proprietor of a greengrocer's
store&mdash;a stolid, kindly man with no enemies&mdash;is found
murdered in a manner so particularly revolting that a hardened
medical surgeon inclines to the theory that the killing was done by
a maniac. And the foreman's right hand is missing. It has been hewn
off in exactly the same manner as the dead judge's ear. Now, Chief,
does this suggest nothing to you?"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector shook his head.</p>

<p>"It does to me," the young man continued. "It suggest something
very sinister. It's partly an echo of my Court days. When we
consider that the foreman of a jury raises his right hand to give
the fatal verdict to the judge, who has been listening to the
evidence, we get a recurrence of that dark rhyme I spoke about. And
if we can use our imagination sufficiently to peer into the
perverted, twisted brain of a maniac, these conclusions must throw
some singularly lurid light on the removal of these
portions&mdash;the ear that heard the evidence and the right hand
that helped to sentence the criminal! Do you follow me thus
far?"</p>

<p>"It holds water," Read assented doubtfully. "But you're not
going to suggest that the spirit of Oscar Dowling, whose corporeal
frame we know to have been underground these past six months, is
flitting about creating mayhem and bloody murder among his
enemies?"</p>

<p>"I'm not suggesting anything of the kind," retorted Jeffery
amiably. "It isn't possible for the unpleasant Oscar to wield a
power from beyond the grave, while a quick Mr. Dowling is just as
ridiculous. For one thing, apart from the fact that his death
completely satisfied the criminal authorities at Greycliffe, his
appearance is so striking that&mdash;even had some hitch occurred
in the burial&mdash;he must have been recognized and apprehended
before now. I'm coming back to this important point in a moment.
But what we have now to consider is that Oscar Dowling had two
brothers and a sister. And the younger of the two brothers was a
medical student. All three, if you remember, were bitterly opposed
to the sentence placed on their elder brother by Judge Sheldon.
Now, what is more likely than the inference that one of these
relatives is carrying on this vendetta?"</p>

<p>Jeffery paused. Read, however, merely nodded from behind his
pipe.</p>

<p>"Now, there is another point to bear in mind," the young man
continued. "In spite of what Hoskins said, I firmly believe that
Judge Sheldon had received anonymous letters threatening his
death&mdash;letters that he connected in some way with Oscar
Dowling. It's a psychological point, based on pure surmise. It
gives one explanation why Sheldon carried that cutting relating to
Dowling's death about with him. May we not assume that, allowing
for these threatening letters, Sheldon carried that slip of
newsprint about with him as a kind of assurance that the vengeful
convict was really past harming him?"</p>

<p>"H'h," the Chief Inspector grunted doubtfully. "Then you must
assume that these vindictive relatives were responsible for the
letters?"</p>

<p>"For the moment, we may take that view."</p>

<p>"Then, admitting that premise, these people must also be touched
with the family insanity that wrecked Dowling's life."</p>

<p>"Only periodically," Jeffery explained. "Because, at certain
times, I believe that this man or this woman has long periods of
normality he or she behaves as an ordinary individual. During these
sane periods, he or she can go among his or her fellows without
arousing the slightest suspicion as to a mental kink." Blackburn
sat up suddenly and faced his companion.</p>

<p>"Chief! Even you and I have been deceived!"</p>

<p>Read's jaw gaped and his pipe almost dropped from his lips. "Do
you mean to say that we have actually met and talked with this
person?"</p>

<p>"I believe we have." Jeffery tossed his cigarette-end in the
fire. "Because that person must be among the people we have
questioned in regard to these murders." He paused. "More than that,
the murderer is an individual known to sight by at least one or
more of these people who have been under our investigation!"</p>

<p>The other man frowned. "That's a pretty fantastic statement,
son. How do you figure that out?"</p>

<p>"If we analyse the facts of the Biggs murder, we can face no
other conclusion," Jeffery assured him quietly. He lit another
cigarette and resumed his position of clasped hands behind his
head. "Now, listen carefully, Chief.</p>

<p>"You recall my reconstruction of how the murderer of Biggs fixed
that door at eleven o'clock so that he could enter soon after noon
to-day? I came to a conclusion that Blackbeard had chosen the alley
door merely to baffle the police, since Mrs. Minnick was watching
the front entrance. But when I came to think about it, there was a
weakness in this scheme of reconstruction that caused the whole
thing to topple to the ground. Blackbeard, remember, fixed that
door at eleven o'clock. At that time, he could not have possibly
known that Mrs. Minnick would be watching in front of her shop an
hour later! Now, bearing this in mind, let us follow out a logical
chain of reasoning. If Blackbeard did not know of Mrs. Minnick's
intention to stand outside her shop, why trouble to fix that side
door? Why could he not have planned to enter the front doors of the
shop? Because the presence of that woman, together with her
evidence that no one entered the front doors of the shop, made it
tantamount to a locked-room murder, the killer could not have known
that it would appear so. Then why all this preliminary scheming to
unbolt that side door?</p>

<p>"There can be only one reason, Chief! The murderer wanted that
side door unlocked so that he could enter the fruit-shop after the
front doors were locked! That is, after one o'clock to-day. In
other words, Chief, Blackbeard, meant to murder Biggs later on in
the afternoon! Then the tradesman's body would not have been
discovered until Monday at the earliest." Jeffery leaned forward.
"These crimes are so carefully planned that Blackbeard needs at
least twelve hours to cover his tracks! That's why he chooses this
locked-room idea. It gives him plenty of time before the alarm is
raised to create watertight alibis and cover all traces of his
connection with the crime!</p>

<p>"In the Sheldon murder, he obtained his twelve hours and
destroyed the vital clues so thoroughly that we were baffled. But
in this case we've forestalled him! He hasn't had time to clear
away his incriminating trail and perhaps we'll be able to take
advantage of this lead."</p>

<p>Read bent down and thrust another log on the fire. "Clever son,"
he admitted. "Deuced clever! But I can see one serious flaw in your
theory. If Blackbeard planned to commit the murder this
afternoon&mdash;why the devil didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Because he had to strike before he was ready!" Blackburn's eyes
gleamed over his cigarette. "Because, Chief, someone forced his
hand by discovering who the next victim was to be! Blackbeard had
to work fast or he was lost. So he took a chance."</p>

<p>Jeffery leaned forward, elbows on knees, clasped fingers
supporting his chin, staring into the fire. He was talking
animatedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Chief. Someone had penetrated the Blackbeard mystery to
the extent of knowing who the next victim was to be! And in some
manner the murderer discovers this&mdash;don't ask me how, at the
moment.</p>

<p>"Now, consider Blackbeard's position! He has planned to kill
Biggs this afternoon; he has set his stage to achieve this murder
successfully. But now he realizes that he cannot wait that long!
The tradesman, warned by this unknown but astute person, may go to
the police for protection. But that is the least important point.
This does not concern Blackbeard so much as the disturbing
suspicion that this unknown person knows of the murderer's true
identity! He may even inform Biggs&mdash;and if this occurs,
Black-beard is lost. So he determines to strike at once, without a
moment's delay, before the unknown person can get in touch with the
tradesman. Shortly after noon he moves down to the Biggs shop, this
time without his black beard!</p>

<p>"Now, this is an important point, Chief. In the light of what I
am going to explain directly, it proves that the murderer could not
have known the identity of this person who went to warn
Biggs&mdash;until he saw him talking to the tradesman outside his
shop. Now, there are two points that prove this. If Blackbeard had
known that this warning individual could recognize him, he would
have worn his disguise of the beard. Secondly, and more important,
if he had known the man's identity, he would have struck down the
man who threatened his secret instead of the tradesman. Follow me?
Biggs was, at that time, quite unaware of his danger. He would have
made no attempt to escape Blackbeard's vengeance. But the murderer
would have certainly done everything possible to prevent this
unknown individual from meeting and warning the tradesman&mdash;and
possibly divulging the identity of Blackbeard!"</p>

<p>Jeffery paused for a moment as though to assemble his ideas.</p>

<p>"This afternoon, Chief, I assumed that Blackbeard&mdash;when he
made his second appearance shortly after twelve
o'clock&mdash;slipped in through the side door because he saw Mrs.
Minnick watching the front of the shop. But I was wrong! Blackbeard
used that side door because the unknown individual was talking to
Biggs in front&mdash;and he would have instantly recognized the
murderer! This man who warned Biggs must have prepared a list of
suspects, and among those is the true Blackbeard. He knows that
this killer means to strike at Biggs. Naturally, if one of those
suspects walked into the greengrocer's shop just at that time, this
unknown individual's suspicions must crystallize into certainty.
Remember, the murderer was without his disguise.</p>

<p>"Therefore, when he saw and recognized this warning individual
as a person he knew well and who was quite familiar with him, the
murderer dare not take a chance of being seen. That was the reason
he used the side door."</p>

<p>Read was listening carefully. As the young man paused, he said
slowly: "That's good reasoning, son. But why did Blackbeard go
through the side door after he had committed the murder? He could
have walked through the front doors, because he was still unaware
that Mrs. Minnick was watching."</p>

<p>"I think he was afraid to chance the fact that the unknown man
might still be watching around the shop," Blackburn replied.
"Because he did not see these two actually part. He had slipped
into the shop before they took leave of each other."</p>

<p>He paused and tapped the arm of his chair impressively. "But the
value of all this reasoning, Chief, is most important. If the
murderer was a complete stranger to the warning man, he needn't
have feared recognition. He could have passed Biggs and his
companion quite openly. Because he dared not do this, we have the
first real lead in these murders since the investigation began.
Blackbeard and the unknown person who warned Biggs of his danger
must have met under circumstances in which they became very
familiar with each other!</p>

<p>"Now, there are a certain number of suspects in these murders,
and they are people who have come into contact with each other in
the course of our investigation. For one thing, they were brought
together at the inquest. Let us consider these names." He held up
one hand and began to check the names off on his fingers. "They are
the man-servant Hoskins, Miss Val Sheldon, the actress Gloria Grey,
Alfred Torrance, Ernest Hillier, and Lady Sheldon. Now, with our
search narrowed to that extent, it is merely a question of a close
scrutiny of alibis."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector sat up and tapped out his pipe in the
ashtray. "Leave that to me," he announced. "On Monday morning I'll
have every single person concerned in these crimes at headquarters,
and I'll wring them dry!"</p>

<p>Jeffery shook his head. "No, Chief. We can't afford to wait
until Monday. That's thirty-six hours away." He rose to his feet
and stood looking down at his companion.</p>

<p>"Don't you realize what has happened? There's a man wandering
somewhere loose in this city who knows too much for the murderer's
peace of mind. And Blackbeard, who recognised him outside Biggs'
shop, knows his true identity! We've got to find that man, Chief,
and insist on his taking police protection! Because Blackbeard will
stop at nothing to close his mouth!"</p>

<p>Scarcely were the last words out of his mouth when the brass
knocker on the door of the Read flat sounded. The Chief Inspector
rose, and as both men stood eyeing each other, the summons was
repeated.</p>

<p>"Someone in a deuce of a hurry," Jeffery remarked. He walked
into the hall and swung the door open. A young man almost fell
across the entrance, a man with a grey face and fear-stricken eyes.
He recovered himself quickly, seized the door, and slammed it shut.
His breath was laboured and tiny beads of perspiration dewed his
forehead. His brown suit was dishevelled as though he had been
running. Blackburn stared at the newcomer, and in that moment
recognition dawned. It was one of the reporters who had been in the
fruit-shop that afternoon.</p>

<p>The visitor seemed to have recovered some of his self-control.
He stood motionless by the door, as though listening. Then he
straightened and gave a half-hearted grin. He was breathing more
freely.</p>

<p>"Excuse the hurried entrance," he murmured. "But I think I was
followed here. My name is Yates. Martin Yates of the Associated
Press." He gave another glance at the closed door, and for an
instant dark fear showed in his eyes. "And I think I came pretty
near being chosen to add to your quota of murders to-night. But a
miss is as good as a mile!" He drew a handkerchief from his pocket
and dabbed at his face. "I did that last quarter of a mile in
record time," he muttered apologetically. "My wind isn't what it
used to be."</p>

<p>Blackburn said quietly: "You must have something rather
important to tell us, Mr. Yates." He paused, staring at the visitor
with new interest. "A brown suit..." he murmured. "So you were the
man who warned Biggs of this danger this morning!"</p>

<p>Martin's pleasant face broke into a wry smile. "And I thought I
was miles ahead of you in this investigation! It looks as if I've
put my head into a pretty tight noose for no reason at
all&mdash;seeing that you know practically all I'm going to tell
you."</p>

<p>Read was calling from the sitting-room. "Who is it, Jeff?"
Jeffery gestured in the direction of the voice. "Better meet the
Chief," he said. "Come along."</p>

<p>The young reporter followed him into the sitting-room and, after
his greeting to the surprised Read, took the chair that Jeffery
indicated. As he sat, his hands were trembling noticeably and
Blackburn brought him a stiff drink. Yates sipped it thankfully.
After a short silence he looked up to find the two men looking at
him curiously. The young man drained his glass and sat back.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're wondering why I knocked you up so late in the
evening?" he said. "I couldn't wait any longer to tell you the
information that I've dug out. It's rather fantastic, really."</p>

<p>Jeffery said quickly: "I should say that the true identity of
the mysterious Blackbeard is anything but fantastic. Because that's
what you've come to tell us, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Mat tin Yates threw a half-glance at the shadowed window behind
him and crouched closer in his chair. His voice was scarcely above
a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I think I know his real name&mdash;and so do
you!"</p>

<p>With a second drink in his fingers, Martin Yates lay back in the
arm-chair. He did not speak for almost a minute, and the two
investigators did not urge him. Directly he squared his shoulders
and faced them.</p>

<p>"You can thank Inspector Read for what I've done," he said with
a faint smile. "Because after he came around to see me it put me on
the defensive and I determined to have a try at probing this queer
business myself. Anyhow, I made out a list of persons who were
under suspicion, and this morning in my office I went over each one
carefully. All at once I remembered a chance phrase dropped by one
of these people&mdash;and the whole thing became as clear as
daylight! The more I thought about it, the more assured I grew.
Then it was that I realized who the next victim would inevitably
be. So I hurried down to warn poor Mr. Biggs. But my warning was
useless, as you know."</p>

<p>Martin paused to sip his drink.</p>

<p>"Leaving the Biggs murder for a while, let me tell you about
certain conclusions I have made regarding the Sheldon killing. In
both these murders it has been shown that a fair knowledge of
anatomy was required. Add to this the fact that a surgeon's scalpel
was used to amputate the ear of the first victim and the hand of
the second&mdash;and one definite point is established.</p>

<p>"Continuing with the first murder, we are faced with what
appears to be an insurmountable difficulty&mdash;that the murderer
seemingly vanished from a room in which all entrances were locked
on the inside! Now, I ask you to recall the lock on the door of the
Sheldon apartment. It was not a Yale lock&mdash;one that
automatically locked when the door was slammed. Such was the case
of the lock on the door of Biggs' shop. But the lock on the door of
the Sheldon apartment was of the ordinary type in which a key had
to be turned in it before it locked. But everyone seems to have
overlooked one important point. That the door of the Sheldon
apartment could be locked from the outside as well as the
inside!"</p>

<p>The speaker broke off and looked interrogatively from face to
face.</p>

<p>Read was first to speak. "But if the door was locked on the
outside, how is it possible that the only existing key was found in
the dead man's pocket?"</p>

<p>Yates sat up. "There is only one way in which the key could have
been found there," he said quietly. "It was placed there by the
murderer."</p>

<p>He paused. In the silence the flames growled and muttered about
the logs. An uneasy wind had sprung up&mdash;a wind that shivered
the windows in their frames and brushed the doors of the building.
Jeffery gave a low whistle of surprise. "Clever," he murmured. "Go
on."</p>

<p>Martin, his fingers about his glass, leaned forward. "Let us
suppose, gentlemen, that the man who murdered Sheldon that night
searched the body for the key of the apartment, found it, walked
out of the room and, closing the door, locked it behind him. Now,
the murderer is a person whose business makes it necessary for him
to be first on the scene of any murder! When the alarm over the
Sheldon killing is given, he is naturally called. He brings the key
of the apartment with him. When he gets a chance, he slips the key
into the dead man's pocket! When it is found by the detectives,
everyone concludes that the key has been in the dead man's pocket
overnight!"</p>

<p>Yates paused triumphantly and looked at each man in turn.
Jeffery was nodding to himself. After a while the young reporter
went on.</p>

<p>"The cleverness of his move would never be suspected. Who would
ever dream that this man could possibly be the murderer when his
very duty...?" He broke off with a gasp. A sudden crash shook the
pictures on the walls. A violent gust of wind had blown open the
front door. Yates started abruptly at the sound and his fingers,
contracting about the thin glass, shattered the top. Jeffery gave
an ejaculation of annoyance and, striding along the hall closed the
door with a slam. When he returned, Martin was dabbing at his
fingers with a crimson-flecked handkerchief. The fragments of glass
had pierced the skin and the cut was bleeding freely. The young man
looked up as Blackburn entered.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he said briefly. "My nerves are shot to the devil." He
wound the handkerchief about his fingers while Read mixed him
another drink. Jeffery was looking into the hall with puzzled eyes.
"Strange about that door. I could have sworn that I shut it."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector came across with a fresh glass. "Now that
we've cleared up those points," he announced, "there's only one
more mystery." He placed the glass in Yates' hand. "Who is
Blackbeard?"</p>

<p>The reporter did not answer. Instead, he reached into his pocket
with his bound finger and drew out a blank envelope. "The name of
the killer is written inside here," he said quietly. "I'm not going
to divulge that name until I've made a little experiment to-night.
At present I've no definite proof&mdash;only suspicion. To-night
will prove beyond all doubt if that name is correct. I want you to
promise me that you won't open that envelope until I ring you on
the telephone tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"Then why write it down at all?" Read demanded. "Why not wait
until to-morrow to tell us the man's name?"</p>

<p>A curious expression crossed the reporter's face.</p>

<p>"Because, Inspector, to-morrow I may be dead! If I haven't
'phoned you by three o'clock tomorrow, you have full permission to
open the envelope and read the name!"</p>

<p>There was a hushed silence broken only by the sighing of the
wind.</p>

<p>Jeffery asked: "What is this experiment?"</p>

<p>"It's childishly simple," Yates explained. "When I went down to
warn Biggs this morning, I believe the murderer followed and
recognized me. He also believes that I know his identity, and I'm
certain he followed me to this place to-night. I was afraid that he
would strike before I could get this envelope into your safe
keeping." He paused and handed the envelope to the Chief Inspector.
"Now, this person is certain to have another attempt to close my
mouth. But forewarned is forearmed! I know in which direction the
danger lies." He lowered his voice. "There is only one way to trap
this murderer. That is to catch him red-handed. I want him to come
after me&mdash;I want him within reach of my hands so I can rip off
that black beard and see his true features. Then I'll know whether
that name on the paper is correct!"</p>

<p>Yates rose to his feet as he spoke. He began making preparations
for his departure. Jeffery, however, seemed far from satisfied. He
watched the reporter with worried, anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"But the risk!" he muttered. "We can't let you do this thing.
You're not dealing with an ordinary murderer. You're putting
yourself in the hands of a maniac who will stop at nothing." He
turned to the elder man. "Chief, you must arrange police protection
for Mr. Yates."</p>

<p>Martin shook his head quickly. "No, no! Don't you see, Mr.
Blackburn, that such obvious protection would ruin everything? This
murderer is cunning personified&mdash;he'd never venture near me if
there was a police uniform in sight!" He shook his head again.
"It's a risk, I know. But think of the months of work it will save
if I manage to grab that beggar red-handed! Once we get him behind
bars, there's enough evidence to hang him a dozen times over!"</p>

<p>"You're armed, of course?" Read asked curtly.</p>

<p>Yates smiled and tapped a bulge in his pocket. "I may be
reckless&mdash;but I'm not a fool. It's loaded in every one of the
six chambers, and I won't hesitate to use it, believe me!"</p>

<p>He nodded to Read and moved outside. With Jeffery at his side,
the two men reached the door. They shook hands and Blackburn
watched the reporter as he moved cautiously into the darkened
street. In a few minutes the shadows swallowed him and he was lost
to sight. The young man shook his head slowly. "There goes a very
gallant gentleman," he murmured, and closed the door. The tall
clock in the hall struck ten o'clock.</p>

<p>Jeffery returned to the sitting-room to find the Chief Inspector
turning the blank envelope over in his fingers.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p>Before breakfast on the following morning, the telephone in the
Read cottage rang urgently. Jeffery jumped out of bed to answer
'it. His first thought was of Martin Yates, but it was Bertha
Fenton on the other end of the line. She had rung up to tell young
Mr. Blackburn that a few minutes before her discovery of the body
of the tradesman, she had seen the Judge's man, Hoskins, on the
Dandenong Road. He had carried a black bag under his arm and had
met and talked with a second individual whom she had not
recognized. Bertha then apologized for her tardiness in forwarding
this information&mdash;the shock of her experience had temporarily
driven it from her mind. During the night, however, she had
remembered the incident&mdash;hence the early call.</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded over the instrument.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Miss Fenton. Thanks for your trouble. You
can't recall having seen this second man before?"</p>

<p>Bertha explained that she had seen only a glimpse of his
back&mdash;a view much too limited for recognition. On this slight
identification, the man had certainly appeared a complete stranger
to her.</p>

<p>With a request that if she, by chance, could recall having met
the unknown man, she would ring him immediately, Jeffery hung up.
Slipping into dressing-gown and slippers, he walked into the
sitting-room, opened the door of the book-case, and peeped inside.
Satisfied, he prowled into the Chief Inspector's bedroom. That
gentleman yawned mightily and raised himself on one elbow.</p>

<p>"Who's ringing at this unearthly hour," he demanded. "That damn'
'phone woke me! Don't people realize that Sunday is a day of
rest&mdash;even for policemen?"</p>

<p>Blackburn drew his dressing-gown about him. "No rest for the
policeman to-day," he announced briskly. "We've got to
work&mdash;and wok fast." He looked about the room. "Where did you
put that black-list&mdash;the list of telephone-numbers?"</p>

<p>Read yawned again. "In my wallet&mdash;inside breast pocket in
the grey suit." He eyed the young man speculatively. "D' you mean
to get those people down here to-day, son?"</p>

<p>"This morning," Jeffery corrected gently. He was at the
wardrobe, running his hands over the suit. "And in answer to your
earlier question, that was Miss Fenton on the wire. You remember
that funny old dear who found Biggs' body." In a few words, he told
the other of Bertha's message.</p>

<p>The Inspector received it with a grunt. "Thought it might have
been that young reporter." He sat up and searched for his
dressing-gown. "I'm worried about that chap," he admitted. "Had a
funny dream last night, too." He stroked his moustache into place.
"Black beards and knives and envelopes all mixed up. I don't like
it!"</p>

<p>Jeffery walked from the wardrobe with a slip of paper in his
hand. "You're getting nervy," he said calmly. "By the way; while I
get through to these people, would you put the sturdy O'Connor on
the trail of Hoskins? I'd like to know what was in that black bag
he hugged so securely."</p>

<p>Read nodded and set off in the direction of the bathroom.
Jeffery made his way to the sitting-room, and five minutes later, a
cigarette between his lips and the "black list" in front of him, he
was dialling numbers on the small ebonite telephone.</p>

<p>Shortly after ten o'clock the knocker on the door thumped twice.
Young Mr. Blackburn, clothed, breakfasted and almost at peace with
the world, opened it to meet the first arrival. Gloria Grey stood
outside.</p>

<p>"How can I help you this time?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We just want a few minutes of your time," the young man
explained. "If you'll come inside..." He stood back to allow her to
enter. As they walked toward the sitting-room, Jeffery could not
help but notice the change in her appearance, even in this
comparatively short space of time. The blue eyes were clearer and
her nervous, uneasy fumblings had disappeared. Evidently the cure
was obtaining results.</p>

<p>Jeffery said quietly: "We want to know your movements between
the hours of ten o'clock and three o'clock yesterday afternoon,
Miss Grey."</p>

<p>For just an instant that old haunting fear flashed into her
eyes. Then her face cleared.</p>

<p>"I see," she spoke softly. "It's about the fruit-shop murder, is
it?" She lifted her head. "I went to see a talkie yesterday
morning, Mr. Blackburn. Dropped into the"&mdash;she mentioned a
well-known Bourke Street theatre&mdash;"about eleven o'clock and
came out about half past two."</p>

<p>The young man raised his eyebrows. "Oh?" He pursed his lips.
"Did you go alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You didn't think to keep your ticket stub, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The actress shook her head. "I can't afford seats that require
ticket stubs," she returned quietly. "I went into the cheapest
seats where they sell you ordinary tickets off the roll at the
box-office."</p>

<p>"And you saw no one who could identify you?" pressed Jeffery.
"Perhaps the girl who showed you to your seat...?"</p>

<p>The woman sat up in her chair. Her eyes, frank and level, sought
his. Her voice was as level as her gaze.</p>

<p>"I know you've got to do this kind of thing, Mr. Blackburn, and
I'm not annoyed. I only wish I could be of some help to you. I
haven't forgotten what you and Mr. Read have done for me. But I
can't tell lies&mdash;I've finished with all that kind of thing.
When I tell you I went to a talkie theatre yesterday morning, it's
the whole truth. I bought an ordinary ticket off the roll, and
found my way to my seat by groping about in the dark. During the
entire programme I saw no one I knew. Coming out, I took a tram to
my new boarding-house, getting back about half past two." She rose
from her chair. "That's all I can tell you, though it may
incriminate me again. But it's the truth!"</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded slowly. "I believe you, Miss Grey&mdash;although
you have ruined a very promising theory by your frankness." He
smiled. "I don't think we will have to worry you again." He was
shepherding her into the hall. By the entrance, he paused. Gloria
Grey had given a little start of recollection. She turned to him.
"Mr. Blackburn, I think someone did see me as I came out of that
theatre."</p>

<p>"Who was that?"</p>

<p>"Valerie Sheldon. As I began to cross the road, she drove past
in her car, coming from the bottom end of Bourke Street. I don't
know whether she saw me, but I recognized her all right."</p>

<p>Blackburn was staring at her.</p>

<p>"You're positive of that, Miss Grey? Because Miss Sheldon told
us that she would be out of town over the week-end."</p>

<p>The actress set her lips. "She certainly wasn't out of town at
half past two on Saturday afternoon, anyhow," she returned.</p>

<p>Blackburn did not press the point. He said good-bye to the woman
and turned away, closing the door.</p>

<p>"So Miss Sheldon wasn't out of town at all on Saturday," he
murmured. "'Oh, what a tangled web we weave...'"</p>

<p>Still murmuring to himself, he sought out the Chief Inspector,
who was finishing a belated breakfast.</p>

<p>The step-daughter of the late Sir Merton Sheldon was the next
visitor to the cottage. She drove up after lunch, thumped on the
brass knocker, and was admitted to the living-room. She wore her
leather driving-coat and small beret. She entered apologizing for
her lateness.</p>

<p>"I had to drive all the way from the country," she said, as she
seated herself. "Mother didn't deliver your message until close on
eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>Jeffery's face expressed polite surprise. "Did you drive home
again yesterday afternoon, Miss Sheldon?"</p>

<p>A faint expression crossed the girl's face, leaving her eyes
hard and suspicious. "Yesterday?"</p>

<p>The young man nodded. "Of course. You were in town yesterday
afternoon, weren't you? Driving down Bourke Street about half past
two?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes." Again that fleeting expression of fear crossed
her 'ace. Like lightning, it flickered and was gone. Now her voice
was perfectly controlled. "I came down to visit the Melbourne
Public Library."</p>

<p>Yet you were going to lie, Jeffery told himself. But no
suggestion of this reached his tone when he echoed her words. "The
Public Library?"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Sharpness edged her expression. "I am working on a
new novel while staying with Mother, and it so happened that I
required some data relating to poisons. I drove down to the city,
reaching here about ten o'clock. From then onward until two o'clock
I was sitting reading in the library."</p>

<p>Read, openly suspicious, snapped: "What was the book?"</p>

<p>The question was clearly unexpected. Valerie Sheldon stared at
he Chief Inspector. After a momentary hesitation, she replied
stiffly: "It was Benedikt's 'Der Raubthierypus am menschliken
Gehirme.' I wanted a confirmation on the effects of solanine, a
particularly rare poison distilled from&mdash;"</p>

<p>Read's bark cut into her explanation. "Did a librarian find the
book for you?"</p>

<p>The girl measured him with a frigid stare that would have been
like a cold douche to a more sensitive person than William Jamieson
Read. "He did not!" Deliberately she turned away from the Chief
Inspector and addressed herself to Blackburn. "It wasn't necessary.
I'm almost as familiar with the criminology section of the library
as I am with my own room. I went straight to the shelf and took
down the book myself."</p>

<p>The young man frowned. "Unfortunate," he murmured. "Then, since
you are a rather frequent visitor to the Public Library, surely it
is strange no one saw you there. You surely recognized somebody you
knew and who knew you?"</p>

<p>Valerie Sheldon shrugged her shoulders. Her tone had the
faintest hint of condescension. "My dear man, when I get hold of
Benedikt, the Prince of Wales could sit next to me without my
noticing him!"</p>

<p>This facetiousness stung the Chief Inspector. He stood up,
looking even taller than usual. There was no humour in his words
when he spoke. "And so, young lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Val Sheldon, springing to her feet, interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Go ahead!" Her face, always austere, was rigid and pale as
marble. "And so, as you have no witnesses, we have only your bare,
unsubstantiated statement that you spent the time as you say!" Her
speech was a sarcastic parody of the Inspector's words. She faced
him, her head high. "Isn't that how it goes? I've written the sane
sentence half a dozen times in my own manuscripts!"</p>

<p>Read took a step forward. "This is no time for fooling, young
woman," he said sharply.</p>

<p>"And it's no time for blind, senseless accusations!" Her eyes
were blazing, and she swept from the room. A slam of a door and the
angry hum of a starting car and she was gone.</p>

<p>Even as the sound of the car died away, there came-a sharp
summons at the door and the young man sprang to open it. He found
O'Connor on the step, and the burly detective was in a state of
high excitement.</p>

<p>"It's Hoskins, Mr. Blackburn!" he cried. "That's your man! He's
made a dash for it. When we got down to his rooms we found the
whole place turned upside down. His landlady said that he packed
his bags and left for the station yesterday afternoon!"</p>

<p>He paused and drew a deep breath. "And that ain't all, sir. Take
a look at this!" He reached down and picked up a small black bag.
"When we searched the rooms, we found this hidden away in the
corner of a cupboard. Guess what's inside?"</p>

<p>Holding the bag under Blackburn's nose, he sprang it open. The
young man took one glance and almost recoiled.</p>

<p>Inside the bag lay a human hand, a right hand that had been
severed at the wrist!</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>For a full thirty seconds Jeffery stared at this grim relic as
though he could not believe the evidence of his own eyes. Hoskins!
Back into his mind flooded the words of Martin Yates: "The murderer
must be a man who was first on the scene of the crime." Hoskins had
discovered the Sheldon murder! He was "on the scene" when the door
of the inner apartment was broken down.</p>

<p>Of course! Hoskins!</p>

<p>For a brief space elation flooded his heart. Then abruptly it
died. Jeffery shook his head. "Come in and see the Chief," he
invited.</p>

<p>The detective, needing no second bidding, almost ran across the
hall and into the sitting-room. Jeffery, following more slowly,
could hear his voice raised in triumphant recital. As he entered,
O'Connor was saying:</p>

<p>"He won't get far! The landlady told us that he left about six
o'clock yesterday afternoon. That's too late for the express and
there's no boats in port. He must be hiding away somewhere, waiting
his chance. We've got a drag-net out that'd trap a greasy pig! He
can't possibly get through!"</p>

<p>Both men looked up as Blackburn entered. The young man threw
himself down in a chair and drew his hands wearily over a face that
had suddenly gone worried and grey. Presently he looked up and
shook his head.</p>

<p>"It isn't natural, Chief. I'm sorry to be a wet blanket, but
it's useless to go on fooling ourselves. No man is going to leave a
damning piece of evidence like that behind him." He made a wide
gesture with his hands. "Here we have a careful, cautious murderer,
a man who has such a grasp of his wicked game that he plans his
moves days ahead. And you ask me to believe that such a man could
possibly leave evidence like that"&mdash;he indicated the
bag&mdash;"behind him. Why, it's an absolute fingerpost to his
guilt!"</p>

<p>O'Connor was plainly disappointed at this reception. "Every
criminal makes at least one mistake, sir," he pointed out. "They
all slip up some place."</p>

<p>"Admitted! Admitted!" Jeffery jumped from the chair and 'began
to pace the room. "But if our man does make one mistake, it won't
be a childishly stupid piece of negligence like that! To leave that
severed hand about is tantamount to pinning a visiting-card on the
bodies. I just can't believe it!"</p>

<p>Read said quietly: "Perhaps Hoskins had to leave it somewhere,
son. It may be that he hadn't time to destroy it."</p>

<p>At the other end of the room Blackburn wheeled. "Then why didn't
he bury the hand? Or weigh the bag with stones and toss it into the
river? Or parcel it up and leave it somewhere 'to be called for'?
He could have done any of these things quite easily. Can you
imagine for a moment that the murderer's first thought wouldn't be
to get rid of that thing as quickly as possible&mdash;instead of
hugging it to his breast like a keepsake?"</p>

<p>He was standing in the centre of the room. When he spoke again
the frenzy had left his tone and it was quiet by contrast.</p>

<p>"No, Chief. Our murderer left that bag in Hoskins' rooms. But
the servant had taken fright over something and run away. Why?
Where is he now? How did the murderer contrive to plant that bag?
Questions&mdash;questions&mdash;there's no end of them!" He broke
off suddenly and glanced at his wrist-watch. "It's four o'clock,
Chief&mdash;which brings us to the most important question of all:
where is Martin Yates?"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector sprang to his feet. As he moved, the
telephone at his elbow shrilled impatiently, and Jeffery, his face
alight, stepped forward. But Read was before him. The big man
grasped the receiver. "Yes&mdash;yes," he barked. "Chief Inspector
Read speaking...what? Oh, God!"</p>

<p>His voice choked suddenly. The two men watching saw the high
colour ebb slowly from his face, leaving it paper-white. The hand
that grasped the receiver was trembling. In the silence, the
unintelligible scratching voice at the other end was audible. Then
Read spoke a few husky words into the instrument and replaced the
receiver. When he turned his face was that of an old man.</p>

<p>"You asked, son, where is Martin Yates." His lips, tight and
pale, barely moved. "They've just found him over by the river with
half his head blown off. That was Dr. Conroy on the wire...he's
gone back there. Fixes the time of death at about ten-thirty last
night." He seemed to choke on his words. "Must have got him just
after he left this room."</p>

<p>Jeffery, sunk in the lethargy of despair, buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>"The third!" he muttered. "What fools we were ever to let him
go! We should have forced police protection on him. That insane
experiment..." Abruptly his voice splintered. He sprang to his
feet. "Chief! That letter! Yates' sealed letter!"</p>

<p>Read was already at the book-case, dragging at the glass panels
with fingers strangely clumsy. The younger man could have shouted
in his impatience as the Inspector fumbled among the books. At last
he had the required volume; he opened it, and took out the envelope
Jeffery reached out his hand. Read, however, was crouched before
the panels, staring at the corner of the page.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Blackburn cried impatiently.</p>

<p>"Everything! Last night, son, I placed this envelope in the
book, taking particular care to notice the number of the page. You
say you haven't touched this letter?"</p>

<p>"No, no! Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," Read answered slowly, "this envelope was in a
different page from the one I placed it next to last night."</p>

<p>A silence, tensed with a dozen unanswered questions, quivered
between them. Jeffery drew a deep breath and spoke in a whisper.
"Open the letter...quickly!"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector ran a heavy forefinger under the gummed flap
and extracted a piece of ordinary paper, folded four times. He
opened it, spread it wide, and Blackburn, with O'Connor peering
over his shoulder, read the two typewritten lines:</p>

<p>"The body of Martin Yates will be found near the Thatched House
on the southern side of the river."</p>

<p>And the note was signed:</p>

<p>"Blackbeard."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p>It was a very silent party that moved along the green slopes
bordering the river ten minutes later. There was no need to search
about for the location of the latest murder. The Thatched House,
standing against a background of trees, with its rustic seats and
tables for the convenience of picnickers, was a well-known landmark
along the river, and this afternoon it was all the more conspicuous
by the crowds moiling about it. The smooth banks of the Yarra were
popular as strolling-grounds on a Sunday afternoon, and even in the
most uninviting weather the winding paths were dotted with couples.
On this particular afternoon, however, the sunny skies had brought
out crowds expecting nothing more than a pleasant walk among the
flowered beds. And they had found that most dramatic and
fascinating of all attractions&mdash;murder! Small wonder that the
launches, the gardens, and the itinerant bands were forgotten in
the mad scramble to satisfy the morbid craving of the inquisitive
mind.</p>

<p>Fortunately the police had been early on the spot and had roped
off a considerable area that took in the Thatched House and the
lawn for many yards. It was over this hempen barrier that the Chief
Inspector, Jeffery Blackburn, and Detective O'Connor climbed,
pushing their way ruthlessly through the crowds and walking to
where a group of plain-clothes men had gathered about the rear of
the tea-house. The men stood aside as the investigators came
forward. Dr. Conroy advanced to meet them.</p>

<p>He nodded curtly. "Is this thing ever going to stop, Read?
They're getting worse as they go on, you know." As he spoke, he was
leading the three men forward. They halted near the back wall of
the house, where a sheet concealed the body. Conroy bent and
whipped it aside.</p>

<p>Jeffery took one look and turned away.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector, after a moment of revulsion, did not
flinch. The body lay sprawled at the bottom of the wall&mdash;the
body of Martin Yates dressed as they had last seen him. The brown
suit was stained and dyed with blood from a great wound that had
almost pulped the top of the head and the upper part of the face.
The unfortunate man lolled like some grotesque marionette, both
arms outflung, palms upward as though defending himself. A revolver
lay on the grass near by. Blackburn, steeling himself to look
again, recalled the weapon that the young reporter had carried on
the previous night. Detective Donlin, seeing the young man's
attention, came forward.</p>

<p>"That's his gun, Mr. Blackburn," he volunteered. "His
fingerprints are on the butt. One bullet fired from the chamber
too. Looks as if the poor chap made an effort to save himself."</p>

<p>Jeffery caught his breath. "Horrible!" he muttered. At that
moment all personal interest in the case seemed lost; he was filled
only with a vast and nauseating horror at the brutal murder of this
young man, who had gone to his death merely because he was cleverer
than the police. He turned away and crossed to where Read and
Conroy were conversing in low tones.</p>

<p>"Blown the top of his head almost off," the doctor was saying.
"You see that, Read! A wound of such nature could have only been
caused by a shot-gun&mdash;a twelve gauge, I should say, and fired
at close-range. Say about six feet away. It would take a
twelve-gauge cartridge with a number two, or three, shot." He
stared speculatively at the corpse. "There's only one other weapon
capable of making a hole like that&mdash;that's a rifle. A
Winchester or a Remington with a hollow bullet, say a twenty-two or
a forty-four. But it wasn't a rifle." He paused and, feeling in his
pocket, produced a screw of paper. Opening it, he exhibited a
number of small stained shot.</p>

<p>"I picked these out of the wound with tweezers," he explained,
proffering the screw for Read's inspection.</p>

<p>That gentleman glanced at them and nodded. "Death, of course,
was instantaneous?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I ask you!" Conroy gestured toward the body.</p>

<p>The sarcasm in the little doctor's tone nettled Read. "No need
to be funny," he snapped. "I'm not asking questions for my health.
If this chap's death was instantaneous, how about that revolver?
There's a shot fired from the chamber. He couldn't have done that
after he was dead!"</p>

<p>Dr. Conroy, his face flushing, drew himself up stiffly. Jeffery,
sensing the dangerous atmosphere, interposed quietly: "He was
probably holding that revolver, Chief. Remember, Yates knew that
someone was dogging him, and he was shaky when he left us last
night. When he got out on to the road, he probably drew his
revolver and walked with it at full cock. When the charge hit him,
the shock would cause his finger to tighten on the trigger. That's
how that shot was fired."</p>

<p>There was a pause while Conroy cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Besides the rifle," he said primly, "the murderer used his
scalpel again. It's the lips this time. Both the upper and lower
lobes have been cut out in a neat ellipse..."</p>

<p>Another silence, broken only by the uneasy murmuring of the
crowd. Jeffery spoke with the tonelessness of despair.</p>

<p>"The ear that heard the evidence, the hand that passed the
sentence&mdash;and now the lips that would have betrayed! It fits
exactly&mdash;damnably so!" He moved over, and conquering his
repulsion, stared down at the body. His eyes hard, he took in every
detail from the grass-stained soles of the shoes to the dangling
ornament on the watch-chain slung across the slumped stomach.
Suddenly Jeffery's eyes narrowed. For a moment he stared
unbelievingly at the body, then dropped on his knees beside it.
Then he straightened with a low whistle of surprise, and thrusting
his hands in his pockets walked slowly up and down.</p>

<p>Read, meanwhile, had been talking to Donlin. The plain-clothes
man nodded and, walking round the house, returned with a scared
looking young man. He was accompanied by a girl, her eyes scarlet
with weeping. The Chief Inspector, hands behind his back, stared at
the couple with a frowning, official eye. He addressed the man.</p>

<p>"So you found the body, Mr...?" he paused interrogatively. The
young man started and fumbled nervously. "William Baily, sir.
That's my name. I'm a clicker at the Wearwell Boot Factory in
Fitzroy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that! How did you come to find the body?"</p>

<p>Mr. Baily glanced rather helplessly at the girl, who appeared
about to dissolve into a fresh flood of tears. "Me and Flo, here,
we thought, the day being fine, we'd like a stroll along the river.
Flo's inside all the week an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Confound Flo!" snapped the Chief Inspector. "Get to the
point!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." William Baily swallowed something. "Well, we caught
the tram to the city an' got to the bridge about three o'clock. We
walked for an hour or so, an' then Flo wants a cuppa tea. So we
came across here t' give our order, sir."</p>

<p>At this point, the girl began to heave and dab at her red eyes
with a damp handkerchief. Read glared unsympathetically and her
escort hurried on.</p>

<p>"The place was pretty much full, so I suggests we takes our tray
out in the garden here. We starts out, an' as we rounds the corner
we ran slap-bang into&mdash;into..." Baily swallowed again, went
pale, and his voice trailed off. A glance at the Inspector's
truculent eye spurred him on. "Gawd! But it gave us a turn! I drops
the tray an' Flo screams and everyone comes rushing up."</p>

<p>"You didn't touch the body?"</p>

<p>Mr. Baily shuddered. "Gawd, no, mister!"</p>

<p>Read dismissed him. He turned to Donlin.</p>

<p>"Nothing in the footprints, I suppose?" They were moving back to
the body. The Chief Inspector examined the ground with a hard eye.
"Looks as if a herd of cattle have been trampling about the
place!"</p>

<p>The plain-clothes man was apologetic. "Sorry, Chief. We roped
off the area as soon as we got here, but that was twenty minutes
after the body was found. Meanwhile, every person near the river
seems to have had a peep."</p>

<p>O'Connor, who had been searching among the trees, came toward
them. Read greeted him with a curt monosyllable.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Looks fairly open-and-shut," the big detective reported.
"There's only one set of tracks from the road up through the trees.
They end here, trodden out by other footprints of the crowd. That
trail is Yates' prints all right. The murderer must have come along
the gravel path in front of the tea-house&mdash;to avoid leaving
prints&mdash;slipped round this side and waited with his gun.
Yates, who was walking forward with his revolver ready, got the
charge full in the face as he stepped from the trees."</p>

<p>Jeffery, who had joined the group, was listening intently. He
nodded to himself as though pleased about some point. The Chief
Inspector was staring at the trodden ground.</p>

<p>"Did anyone find the cartridge-case from the shotgun? No? That's
queer."</p>

<p>Conroy, fingering his beard, spoke crisply. "You may be sure our
murderer kept it, Chief. He's too careful to leave any clues about,
excepting those he manufactures himself. He ties his loose ends
very neatly:"</p>

<p>Donlin came forward, holding in his hand a number of objects
wrapped in a handkerchief. He opened it for Read's examination.
"They mean to shift the body, Chief, so I'm taking these along to
headquarters." He displayed the initialled watch, business cards,
addressed envelopes, a cigarette-case with "Martin Yates" engraved
on the lid, and a wallet, besides some loose change. Read nodded,
lifting his eyes to where two men were loading the body on to a
stretcher. When they were gone, he turned to Jeffery.</p>

<p>"This is where I hand in my resignation," he said slowly. There
was no humour in the sombre tone. "This thing's too much for me,
son. It's got right out of hand."</p>

<p>Blackburn gripped his arm. "Don't be ridiculous, Chief! I don't
want to raise your hopes&mdash;but in the black fog of this thing I
can see the first tiny patch of blue sky." He nodded at the
eagerness that flooded his companion's face. "Yes. For the first
time during these long weeks I think we're on the right track!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;?" began the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>Jeffery held up his hand. "Not another word. I can't say more,
because even this time I may be wrong." He dropped his voice. "And
this time, Chief, we can't afford to make a mistake!"</p>

<p>Five minutes later, they were seated in the police-car skimming
towards the city. Read sat with folded arms in one corner. Jeffery,
in an effort to divert his mind, picked up a day-old paper that he
had found on the seat and began to turn the leaves idly. Suddenly
he brought the printed sheet closer and read with interest. Then he
glanced at the date line showing that it was of a Saturday edition.
Jeffery folded the paper so that the printed paragraph showed on
the outside and handed it across to the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>"Here's something to occupy your mind," he said. "Also notice
that the paper is yesterday's edition."</p>

<p>Read took the paper and dropped his eyes to the paragraph
indicated by the young man's pointing finger. He read:</p>

<p class="newspaper">CLOSED FOR CLEANING<br>
<br>
The annual cleaning of the Melbourne Public Library will begin from
today, Saturday, when the library will be closed to all visitors
until further notice. It is anticipated that the library will
probably reopen for the public within the next three days.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector dropped the paper on his knees and looked up
at his companion. He nodded slowly, dangerously. "So much for Miss
Valerie Sheldon's perfect alibi," he commented.</p>

<p>As they walked into Read's private office, the constable on duty
in the corridor came forward with a letter in his hand. "Came for
you about ten minutes ago, sir," he reported. "Brought by special
messenger."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector walked into his office, holding the letter
as though he expected it to explode. Tossing it on the desk, he
examined it closer, and relief lighted his face. "Thought it might
be from the Commissioner," he grunted. Dropping into the swivel
chair, he ripped the envelope. Jeffery moved away to light a
cigarette and stare at the view from the window with vague,
disinterested eyes. An exclamation from his companion caused him to
turn. Read was frowning over the sheet of paper he had removed from
the envelope.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes and waved the letter. "Take a look at this,
son."</p>

<p>Jeffery crossed and took the paper. The address, printed in the
top right-hand corner, caught his attention.</p>

<p class="letter">Cairnside Mental Hospital.<br>
<br>
Chief Inspector Read.<br>
<br>
Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
I wish to bring under your notice a rather peculiar circumstance in
which you may be interested.<br>
<br>
About six months ago we received into our home a patient who had
been found wandering on the main Express line between Adelaide and
Melbourne. He was a young German who later gave his name as Hans
von Rasch, and he had received a blow on the head which temporarily
deranged his mind.<br>
<br>
At first it seemed doubtful that the patient would live through his
injuries. However, he rallied after the first week and has since
been convalescing in a darkened room. He was, of course, allowed to
see no one or have contact, in any way, with the outside world.
This treatment proved successful, and gradually the young man's
mental faculties became stronger.<br>
<br>
About two days ago we believed that our patient was sufficiently
advanced on the way to recovery to receive mental stimulus in the
shape of outside impressions. To this end, we provided him with a
number of illustrated magazines and current newspapers. Among the
latter were three giving accounts of the terrible crimes now
agitating the Commonwealth. These accounts excited our patient
almost to a frenzy. He insisted that he was in the position to
provide a valuable clue to the murderer.<br>
<br>
At first we put his statement down to temporary hysteria, believing
it would pass in the night. But this morning the patient insisted
on seeing me. He has told me a most remarkable story&mdash;a
recital so strange and bizarre that I am still doubtful whether to
accept it or not. Therefore, I am taking the liberty of writing to
you.<br>
<br>
I honestly believe that the young man has certain information that
can assist you in this investigation. His manner impressed me
deeply and I feel that, in justice to yourself, you should see this
patient and listen to what he has to say.<br>
<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
Harris Talbot.<br>
<br>
(Lay Superintendent)</p>

<p>Jeffery handed back the letter. "Remarkable," he commented. "I
wonder what's behind it?"</p>

<p>Read took the letter, crumpled it in his hand, and tossed it
into the waste-paper-basket. "That's what I think of it," he
snorted.</p>

<p>"Every murder committed brings in letters like that from crazy
lunatics who either want publicity or auto-suggest themselves into,
confessing the crime. That won't get us anywhere."</p>

<p>Blackburn shrugged. "Perhaps not. Still, it wouldn't do any harm
to have a word with young von Rasch."</p>

<p>"Then you go ahead," retorted the other. "At present I'm more
interested in Miss Sheldon's 'perfect alibi'." His voice slowed. "I
never did like that clever young lady."</p>

<p>Jeffery bent and rescued the crumpled letter from the litter in
the basket. As he straightened, the constable knocked and
entered.</p>

<p>"A Mrs. Bowes to see you, sir." He addressed the Chief
Inspector. "Says she's the landlady of the rooms where a Mr.
Hoskins used to stay. She has some information for you."</p>

<p>As Read nodded, he moved out, to return almost immediately with
a middle-aged woman. Her neat black dress set off the thin, refined
face. Jeffery pushed forward a chair, and after introductions were
performed she began to speak.</p>

<p>"Your detective came down to see me this morning," she
explained. "I could tell him very little at the time. But since, I
have found out more details that may interest you." She paused and
fingered the black beads at her throat rather nervously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hoskins left my rooms, as I told your man, about six
o'clock yesterday afternoon. Almost an hour later, two people rang
the bell and asked for Mr. Hoskins. Connie, our maid, answered the
door. She told them Mr. Hoskins had left. The couple then asked if
they could see his room. Connie, believing that they wanted to rent
the apartment, allowed them to go upstairs. They came down about
five minutes later. Connie heard them talking, but, when she went
to let them out, they had gone."</p>

<p>Read nodded quickly. "Did your maid describe this couple?"</p>

<p>"Only very vaguely," the woman replied. "I could get nothing
more than the fact that the man wore a blue suit and the lady
looked 'kinda uppish', as Connie put it. But as they came down the
stairs, my maid heard the man say to the girl: 'There's nothing to
be afraid of now. The thing's in the bag.'"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bowes nodded quietly. "I know what you're thinking. You
know as well as I do what your man found in that room. He showed it
to me and asked me about it." The woman's voice trembled for a
moment, then she mastered herself. "I was out of the house when
that couple called yesterday. It was only when I told Connie of
that horrible bag found in Mr. Hoskins' rooms that she remembered
the man's speech and she told me. I hurried down here at once to
tell you."</p>

<p>"Your maid is positive she has those words right?" asked the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"Absolutely! I made her repeat them several times." She rose
from the chair. "Just one last request, gentlemen. My boardinghouse
is my living. It's all I have. You realize that any unwelcome
publicity would&mdash;would..." She hesitated and went on:
"...Would give my house a bad reputation. Just now it's packed with
holiday visitors, and for the first time in many months I am making
a little money." She gave them a fluttering, tremulous smile. "I'm
sure you understand."</p>

<p>Read inclined his head. "Of course, madam. We will be very
discreet. And thank you."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the door closed behind her when the Chief Inspector
swung round in his chair. "So the girl was 'kinda uppish,' was
she?" he said savagely. "Well, Miss Val Sheldon has been 'kinda
uppish' too often for my liking." He rose and pressed a bell on his
desk. "Perhaps she'll drop that grand manner when we put the screws
on her." The door opened and the constable entered. "Send O'Connor
to me as soon as he gets in," he ordered.</p>

<p>The man saluted and disappeared. Read came around the desk,
rubbing his big hands. "I'm going along to prepare for Miss
Sheldon's reception," he said. "Are you coming along, son?"</p>

<p>The young man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Go and dig your own grave," he returned. "But don't expect me
to help you. I've worries enough of my own at the moment."</p>

<p>Nine o'clock on that never-to-be-forgotten Sunday night found
Chief Inspector William Read curled up in an armchair before his
cottage fire. He was reading "Monsieur Venus", and paused from time
to time to chuckle over the sly writing. Evidently this official
gentleman was feeling pleased with himself. The fire blazed
brightly, and outside the house the wind was springing up in a
rehearsal of the previous night, rattling the windows and stroking
the doors. Presently there came the sound of a car driven up;
within a few minutes Jeffery strode into the room and, tossing down
his driving gloves, spread his hands to the fire.</p>

<p>Read glanced up from his page. "Where have you been?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"About and about," he young man replied. He began to slip out of
his overcoat. "Been busy since this afternoon. What's the latest
bulletin on Hoskins and his partner in crime?"</p>

<p>The elder man carefully marked his place in the book and laid it
on the arm of his chair. "They're bringing them in now," he said.
"Both of them. O'Connor caught them up at a service station about
three miles out of the city." He sat back in his chair. "I'm
letting them stew for a night behind bars to loosen their
tongues."</p>

<p>Jeffery bent and picked up the book.</p>

<p>"Chief, I'm willing to bet every penny I own that Hoskins and
Val Sheldon had no more to do with these murders than you did."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;all right." Read shrugged a good-humoured
shoulder. "You go your way and I'll go mine. Another bit of
blundering can't make the situation any worse."</p>

<p>"But it can, Chief!" Jeffery dragged an empty chair opposite the
Inspector and sat down. "Because the real murderer hasn't finished
his work."</p>

<p>It was the young man's tone rather than his words that caused
Read to stare at him. He did not speak, for the other was hurrying
on.</p>

<p>"Don't you see. This man's mind is dominated with the one insane
idea&mdash;to get rid of every person responsible for the
imprisonment of Oscar Dowling. That's why he chose to strike during
the Centenary celebrations, when these people would be sure to be
gathered together in the city. He's scored with Sheldon and Biggs,
but the killing of Yates was a necessary incidental. For a moment
he was diverted from his main task by the dictates of safety. Now
he must be getting ready to strike again." Jeffery paused.</p>

<p>"Imagine it, Chief! Murder en masse! Murder on such a sale that
our killer must have spent months planning every move. Planning for
the Centenary, when he could strike again and again! Imagine the
intellect of such a creature." His voice dropped. "And then you
waste time over people like Hoskins and Val Sheldon!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Read began.</p>

<p>But Jeffery's flow of words drowned his half-formed
rebuttal.</p>

<p>"It stands to cold reason that the girl can't be guilty," the
young man continued. "Remember, the person who came to this room
last night, who must have shadowed poor Yates here and watched
where we hid the envelope, knew definitely and absolutely where the
body of that reporter was to be found. Yates was already dead when
these envelopes were changed! In other words, the person who crept
in here last night was our murderer!</p>

<p>"Remember, it must have been well past midnight when this person
entered, since we did not retire until twelve o'clock. At that
time, Val Sheldon was driving her car toward her home at
Greenacres&mdash;almost seventy miles away from here."</p>

<p>He paused. Outside, the wind had risen and moaned about the
walls. Jeffery leaned back in his chair, his eyes half closed.</p>

<p>Read looked uncomfortable. "Maybe you're right, son," he
muttered. "But what can that girl be doing hanging about with a man
like Hoskins? And, don't forget, she was actually seen with the man
who admitted to putting that severed hand in the bag!" He glanced
across at the younger man. "Have you any other ideas?"</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes. There's an almost connected string of ideas running
through my mind," he said lazily. "But half-way along that string,
there's a tangled knot. And it's holding me back. I can't tell you
anything definite until I've straightened out that tangle."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>Without moving from his position, Jeffery replied: "Going to do
a spot of mental wrestling, Chief. Now, complete silence while the
medium goes into a trance."</p>

<p>In the hall the clock ticked away the minutes. They lengthened
into an hour, into an hour and a half. The Chief Inspector turned
page after page. But it was easy to see that his mind was not fully
upon his reading. From time to time, he glanced up at Jeffery's
long body sagging ungracefully in the arm-chair. A cloud of grey
smoke hovered about his head and writhed to the ceiling in slow
spirals. The young man was lying back with closed eyes, and he
might have been asleep except for the restless tapping of one long
finger on the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock struck. Outside the wind had risen. Read gave a
little grunt of impatience, closed the book, and placed it on the
small table. "I'm going to bed, son," he said.</p>

<p>Jeffery did not open his eyes. "Go ahead," he murmured. "I'll
probably be here all night."</p>

<p>And in that moment, it happened. The Chief Inspector had just
risen from his chair when the front door blew open with a crash
that rattled the windows. In that hushed room the sound was
detonating. Jeffery almost leapt from his chair, and the cigarette
went flying from between his lips, scattering sparks like a
miniature rocket. He began to stamp wildly on the carpet. The crash
had startled Read too. He moved into the hall and shut the door
with a slam. Back in the room, he stared at the groping Jeffery and
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Must get that door fixed," he muttered. "And as for you,
son&mdash;you ought to take things easy. Your nerves are worse than
poor Yates'..."</p>

<p>He broke off in astonishment. Jeffery had risen to his feet and
was staring at him. There was an expression on his face that was
surprise, wonder, and enlightenment mingled. For some seconds he
held his gaze, mouth wide, eyes vacant. Then abruptly, his face
blazed with excitement.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" His voice was shrill. "By the Great Living God!
It must be right!" His lean body was trembling with eagerness and
he gripped the table to steady himself. "A door slams back and in
comes truth! The whole wonderful, amazing truth! Can't you hear it,
Chief? The room's ringing with it&mdash;ringing with one name!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;out with it." Read himself was on tiptoe with the
wild excitement.</p>

<p>Jeffery had sobered. He shook his head and crossing to the
divan, struggled into his overcoat. "No, Chief. It wouldn't be
fair. You'd laugh...Even to me, the idea seems too fantastic for
consideration." He was fumbling with his gloves, muttering to
himself. "And yet, I must be right. I must! It's
mad&mdash;mad&mdash;but there's no other possible explanation that
can cover all the facts."</p>

<p>"The name," Read was roaring at him. "Hillier? Hoskins? Who can
it be?"</p>

<p>The young man, with a cheerful wave of his hand, was moving
through the door.</p>

<p>"You might at least tell me where you're going!" the Chief
Inspector yelled after him.</p>

<p>"Down to see your crazy loon in the Cairnside Mental Hospital,"
the answer floated back. But Jeffery Blackburn himself had
gone.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p>Four o'clock on the following afternoon found Miss Bertha Fenton
hunched untidily over her portable machine in the small cubicle
bearing her name at the "Informer" office. With a cigarette between
her lips, she was wrestling with a "fill-up" special&mdash;one of
those incredible pieces of journalistic insanity which the reading
public accept as part of the weekly newspaper.</p>

<p>She was at work on her last slip of copy when a boy tapped on
her door, entered, and deposited on her table the latest edition of
the "Courier." Bertha pushed back her typewriter with a sigh of
relief and picked up the newspaper.</p>

<p>The first page, devoted almost exclusively to the Yates murder,
was merely a journalistic rehash of the morning papers' report. The
woman crinkled her little eyes wickedly. "It's got them
beaten&mdash;the whole thing," she muttered to herself. There was
almost a note of savage satisfaction in her voice. She glanced down
the paper and her eyes contracted. Set in the centre of the sheet
was a story that commanded attention&mdash;a double-column report
bearing the photograph of a young foreign-looking man. Bertha held
the paper closer to her eyes and read.</p>

<p class="newspaper">NEW WITNESS IN MURDER MYSTERIES<br>
<br>
FORMER MENTAL PATIENT MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE CLUE<br>
<br>
The "Courier" announces the discovery of a new witness in the
sensational Centenary murders that are at present agitating the
Commonwealth. This is a young German medical student, Hans von
Rasch. For the past six months, following an injury that he
sustained, this young man has been confined to the Cairnside Mental
Hospital undergoing treatment.<br>
<br>
Two days ago he learnt of the murders through an old newspaper and
immediately asked leave to come to the city, as he had, so he said,
an important clue in his possession that would identify the
murderer.<br>
<br>
Herr von Rasch, who will arrive in the city late this afternoon,
has booked rooms at the Britannia Hotel. Here he will start to
interview the Chief Inspector Read who has been investigating this
series of horrible crimes. The witness will return to the hospital
by special police-car early to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>Bertha Fenton crumpled the paper in her strong fingers. She sat
staring before her for almost a minute. Then, glancing at her
wristwatch, she rose, and, crushing her hat on her head, walked
quickly from the room.</p>

<p>In his bedroom at the Britannia Hotel, Hans von Rasch sat
reading.</p>

<p>He was sitting in a deep chair, his legs stretched toward the
gas radiator. His thin, fair face had that fine pallor that comes
to a skin long denied the sunshine. The hands that rested on the
book were white and slender as the sticks of an ivory fan. From
time to time the young man raised his eyes from the printed page
and glanced up at the clock on the mantel, a merrily ticking
time-piece showing close to eight o'clock. Then he would drop his
eyes to his book again.</p>

<p>Silence in the room&mdash;a silence made all the more oppressive
by the subdued background of small sounds: the whisper of the gas
fire, the rustle of a turned page, and the cheeky chirruping of the
small clock.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. Von Rasch began to yawn, casting envious
glances toward the old-fashioned though undeniably comfortable bed.
He made an effort to overcome the advance of his weariness, but he
realized he had been reading without his mind taking impressions of
the printed words. Once the book almost slipped from his fingers.
He roused himself to glance again at the clock. Eight-thirty. His
interview with the police was arranged for nine o'clock. Perhaps,
if he set the alarm for that hour, he might doze a little. The room
was comfortably warm, the chair was cosy, and he was so tired.</p>

<p>He raised an indolent arm, reached over; and set the alarm.
Rising, he walked to the door and turned the key in the lock. His
next move was to the window, locking the panes together. Turning
out the light, he resumed his seat by the fire, snuggled down, and
closed his eyes. Within a few minutes, deep, regular breathing
announced that he slept.</p>

<p>A deeper silence settled on the room. The clock ticked on with
cheerful disinterest&mdash;a mechanical thing of tin and brass and
cardboard aloof from the dark emotions of mankind. The whisper of
the blue fire crawling about the white cylinders seemed to have
taken on a sinister warning note.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed.</p>

<p>From the direction of the door came a slight rustling sound, a
soft scuffling. The handle of the door turned...to the right...to
the left. It creaked as though some heavy body was placed against
it. A pause and the rustling sounded again. This time its origin
was revealed. Under the door, between the woodwork and the
oilcloth, a sheet of paper was being inserted from
outside&mdash;slowly, cautiously...A soft rattling from the lock
and the key fell from its position, to drop on to the paper with a
soft thud. Quickly the paper carrying the key was whisked under the
door.</p>

<p>Von Rasch stirred slightly, but he did not awaken</p>

<p>Again the silence. It was deeper this time, more tense, as
though the inanimate objects in the room waited and watched.
Minutes passed.</p>

<p>Once more the knob of the door began to turn. Slowly, inch by
inch, the door began to open, and now a slim white hand insinuated
itself around the edge&mdash;a sensitive groping hand. The door
opened wider; the next moment a figure was in the room&mdash;a
figure dressed in a long dark overcoat that hung to the knees, its
face hidden behind a luxuriant black beard and moustache. From the
dimly seen forehead, pale eyes peered swiftly about the
room&mdash;to light exultantly. The man in the chair breathed
deeply in his sleep.</p>

<p>The clock, as though in a panic to warn the sleeper, ticked
frenziedly. It seemed almost straining itself to touch the alarm
that would galvanize the sleep-drugged brain of the unconscious
man.</p>

<p>Slowly the bearded figure crept forward. The slim hand
disappeared in the pocket of the coat, to reappear holding a long
thin blade of razor sharpness. The fire reflected itself luridly on
the scalpel, and the poised weapon seemed already stained. Fingers
clutched tightly about a hilt, the murderer crept forward. One
step...another...the knife was raised now, higher than that dark,
bearded face and those pale, staring eyes. One more step...</p>

<p>"On him!" screamed a voice, and Jeffery Blackburn darted from
the adjoining room.</p>

<p>With that cry, the room seemed suddenly filled with men O'Connor
and Donlin leapt from behind the bed and flung themselves on the
bearded creature. Four constables were close behind them. The knife
was whisked from his hands; it described a glittering arc across
the room and buried itself in the floor some feet away. Now the
long overcoat was buried under a surging, struggling group of men.
Suddenly there came a shot that snapped like a whip-crack; the
acrid tang of smoke hung on the air and the writhing heap froze for
a moment, then parted. The bearded figure lay sprawled across the
floor, a dark shadow in the lesser gloom. Across the front of his
coat, blood oozed slowly. There was a long silence. Then O'Connor
detached himself from the group and came across to where Jeffery
and the Chief Inspector were standing.</p>

<p>"Grabbed my gun and turned it on himself during the struggle,"
the detective explained quietly. "Got it through the chest, I
think."</p>

<p>Blackburn, staring down at the motionless figure, nodded.
"Perhaps it was the best way," he commented. "Right, Donlin. Let's
have the house-light. The drama's finished."</p>

<p>With the flashing-on of the light, he walked over to the young
man, who had risen from his chair and stood looking about, his pale
face flushed.</p>

<p>"Good work, von Rasch," Jeffery said curtly. "You've got nerve!"
He patted the lad on the shoulder and turned back to the waiting
detectives. "Bring that body over here and place it in this chair."
In a few moments it was in position. Blackburn, standing at one
side, cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Read and gentlemen, allow me to present to you
the true identity of the most clever and audacious killer in the
history of your records. The murderer of Sir Merton Sheldon in his
locked apartment, of Mr. Edward Biggs in his fruit-shop, and
"&mdash;his voice rose a note&mdash;"of Mr. Dyke Wilkinson, the
reporter who was found with his head blown away on the banks of the
river two days ago."</p>

<p>Astonishment quivered in the air. Eyes widened. No one spoke.
Jeffery hurried on.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, look upon the face of this murderer!"</p>

<p>He leaned forward and grasped the black beard, winding it in his
fingers. The silence in the room was too tense to be borne&mdash;a
silence of bated breaths, arrested movement, unblinking
eyes&mdash;a silence when time itself seemed to stand still. Then
Jeffery jerked at the beard. It slipped off, together with the
moustache to reveal the pleasant, regular features of&mdash;Martin
Yates!</p>

<p>There came a long, almost unanimous sigh of breaths released in
unison. Still no person in that room broke the silence. Amazement
laid a hand on every mouth, stilled every tongue. Each pair of eyes
was focussed on that handsome Judas face, prepossessing even in
death. Then Read made a jerky little movement and swallowed. His
voice, when he spoke, was curiously shrill.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then Yates was not murdered?"</p>

<p>"Obviously not," Jeffery returned. "It was Wilkinson's body
dressed in Yates' clothes that we found. Remember, the upper part
of the face was disfigured beyond recognition. There was only one
means of identifying the body, and that was because Wilkinson wore
a small moustache. So Yates removed the lips and destroyed our last
chance of recognition."</p>

<p>Read shuddered. "What a fiend! Then Yates was Oscar Dowling's
brother?"</p>

<p>Blackburn smiled grimly. "On the contrary, he was no relation at
all."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector stared. "Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No relation at all," Jeffery repeated. He paused and drew a
deep breath.</p>

<p>"You see, Chief, Martin Yates is Oscar Dowling&mdash;Oscar
Dowling given a new set of features by the miracle of plastic
surgery and the genius of a certain Dr. Bernhardt Meyersen."</p>

<p>At that moment, as if waiting for its cue, the alarm on the
clock shrilled agitatedly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p>Jeffery Blackburn pushed his coffee-cup back and fumbled for his
cigarette case.</p>

<p>"You see, Chief, the criminal's greatest advantage lay in the
fact that with his character of the reporter he was on the inside
of every new plan. After the first murder, he knew practically
every move in advance and could take steps to counteract them. It
was this fact that made it possible for him to elude justice so
long."</p>

<p>It was the following morning and Jeffery was lingering over a
belated breakfast with the Chief Inspector. Read eyed the younger
man over the rim of his cup.</p>

<p>"You certainly go to the head of the class this time, son.
Whoever would have dreamed of a climax like that? Certainly not
this police. man!"</p>

<p>Jeffery lit a cigarette and rocked back in his chair. Gone were
the lassitude and anxiety of the past few days; now he was a man at
peace with the world and tasting the sweets of triumph. He
smiled.</p>

<p>"The biggest surprise was reserved for me when Bertha Fenton
walked out of that side room and demanded a personal statement," he
chuckled. "What a woman! Seems she'd been hiding in there since
four o'clock in the afternoon&mdash;came along as soon as she read
the 'Courier' report and slipped in without 'being seen. No wonder
her paper prizes her services!" He paused, to blow out a feather of
smoke. "But, seriously, Chief, if you hadn't made that remark last
night about my nerves, I might still be walking round in
circles."</p>

<p>Read grunted. He lowered his cup and reached for the toast-rack.
"Stop talking rot and pass the marmalade," he ordered brusquely.
"You know quite well that the whole business is still so much a
closed book to me." He looked up from his spreading. "Here's your
chance to hold the floor, son. How about a little explaining?"</p>

<p>Jeffery grinned. "Just for that, I've a good mind to emulate the
oyster," he declared. "But I couldn't 'forgo this chance of crowing
over you, Chief. So here goes'.</p>

<p>"It's a long and complicated business," he began. "To make it
more understandable, we shall take the supposed murder of Yates as
our stepping-stone and work backward.</p>

<p>"In the killing of the tradesman Biggs, the murderer left a few
loose ends. But in the murder of Wilkinson, the nasty business
simply reeked with inconsistencies. Yates was getting panicky, and
he took a bold step without stopping to plan carefully. Even so, it
was the merest piece of luck that proved his undoing. You see, we
were pressing him hard and he took a last desperate
chance&mdash;gambled and lost!</p>

<p>"Now, Chief, take that last murder as we heard of it on Sunday
afternoon. We were told over the telephone that the body of Martin
Yates had been found on the river-bank. Although we did not
question this at the time, there was absolutely no proof that the
body was that of Yates. Remember how the upper part of the face had
been disfigured beyond recognition&mdash;and, to make
identification even more unlikely, the lower part of the face had
been mutilated. So that, reduced to its barest terms, all we saw on
the bank was the body of an unidentifiable person dressed in Yates'
clothes with Yates' belongings in its pocket and Yates' revolver
lying on the grass near by.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;why should we have been so ready to take this false
evidence at its face value? Because Yates, on the previous night,
had prepared us for his death in a manner that was brilliantly
clever. But his cleverness by no means ended with that preparation.
Because if we had found a body with the entire face shot away, we
might have suspected an attempt to destroy identification. But by
blowing away part of the head and mutilating the lower portion of
the face in a manner so typical of the other murders, he carried on
the horrid motif, as it were, and also managed to lay his false
trail without arousing the faintest suspicion&mdash;at that
time."</p>

<p>Jeffery paused to draw at his cigarette.</p>

<p>"But after the first shock of horror had worn off," he
continued, "I began to think logically over this latest killing.
And I discovered a number of things that give off a definite
fish-like odour. Consider, for instance, the position of the dead
body of the supposed Yates. He had been killed among a thick growth
of trees about one hundred yards off the main road. Now, recall the
behaviour of our supposed victim. On the previous night he had
called on us, openly admitting that he was in deadly fear of his
life, so much so that when he left this house, he was tarrying with
him a revolver fully loaded and ready for instant use. Remember, he
expected an attack to be made upon his life! His path, as we know,
lay along the main road, over the bridge that crosses the river and
into the city. He had no need to go anywhere near that grove of
trees on his way home. Then why should he go wandering about in a
place where the cover and the darkness would very naturally afford
his attacker an excellent hiding-place and an unparalleled
opportunity for murder? One would naturally think that, to a man
expecting and fearing a murderous attack on his life, such a place
would have been avoided at all costs."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector cleared his throat as Jeffery paused. "But
he could have been called in from the trees," he suggested.</p>

<p>"Good! Let us say that he was called in," Blackburn continued.
"There would still be no reason for him to go. Yates, according to
his story, knew who the murderer was. If he were called, wouldn't
he be likely to recognize the voice? Of course he would. And,
having recognized the voice as belonging to the murderer, is it
likely that he would walk calmly into that grove of trees to his
death? I don't think so!"</p>

<p>"Remember, son," Read pointed out, "that Yates had told us he
wanted to meet the murderer to see if the person tallied with that
name on the paper."</p>

<p>"I know! But he still wouldn't have risked his life as
recklessly as all that. Yates wanted us to believe that he was
going to his home and would wait there until the murderer attacked
him."</p>

<p>Read made one last effort. "Then supposing the murderer had met
him on the road and coaxed him into the trees?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see that exactly the same argument applies? Yates,
knowing that the man had designs on his life and having recognized
him as the murderer, would be far more likely to shoot than to walk
into the trap." Jeffery shook his head. "Again, Yates hadn't been
shot on the road and dragged to the Thatched House&mdash;the
bloodstains proved that. No, Chief, as it stood, we were asked to
believe a most illogical fact. We were asked to believe that,
entirely of his own free will, Yates, a man in danger of his life,
had gone completely out of his way to wander in among the
trees&mdash;and had been shot down there. For the life of me I
couldn't reconcile the facts.</p>

<p>"The second inconsistency came from a clue supplied by Dr.
Conroy. Remember how Yates had supposedly received a charge from a
shot-gun in the face as he was creeping through the trees carrying
his revolver? When he was shot, the weapon had apparently dropped
from his fingers to the ground. Now, that, my dear Chief, is a
sheer physical impossibility! One shot, you recall, was fired. At
first it was presumed that this shot had been fired in
self-defence. Then Conroy pointed out that upon the body receiving
the charge in the face, the natural tensing of the muscles would
have flexed the finger on the trigger and the shot would be
discharged in that way. So far, so good! Then why should the
revolver have dropped from the hand? If one finger contracted on
the trigger, why shouldn't all the fingers have contracted about
the revolver? Muscles don't work independently in a case like
this&mdash;the reaction is quite automatic. According to Conroy,
that revolver should have been gripped tightly in the hand, But it
had been dropped on the grass! Why?"</p>

<p>"But the dead man must have dropped it," objected Read. "His
fingerprints and the prints on the revolver tallied exactly."</p>

<p>"And I'll tell you why they tallied," the young man returned.
"Because, after murdering Wilkinson, Yates wiped his revolver
clean, placed it in the dead man's hand, double his fingers around
the butt and so formed the prints on the gun. If Yates had left his
own prints on that gun, they would have not only proved that the
gun had never been in the dead man's&mdash;Wilkinson's&mdash;hand,
but those prints, being Yates' own, would have proved to the world
that he was Oscar Dowling! Remember, a record of Yates'
prints&mdash;under the name of Dowling&mdash;was already in the
possession of the Department. Any smart detective might have
stumbled on the similarity, for although plastic surgery might
alter a man's face beyond recognition, no process yet known to
science can change finger-prints."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector nodded quietly. After a pause, Blackburn
went on.</p>

<p>"Now we come to the third overlapping. It deals with the
incredibly cunning trick of the envelope. After we found that
someone had broken in and changed that envelope&mdash;I'll have
something more to say on that point directly&mdash;I was forced to
one conclusion. There were no signs of a search being made,
therefore I concluded that the intruder must have gone directly to
the book-case. There was no other person in this room, barring our
two selves, when we hid that letter, therefore Blackbeard must have
watched where we put the envelope! And that man was the
murderer.</p>

<p>"Yates left this cottage at ten o'clock. I heard the clock
strike as I let him out. I came back into this room and we talked
for half an hour before deciding that the book-case was the safest
hiding-place for the envelope. Therefore Blackbeard must have been
outside our window at that time. Yet five minutes later, according
to Conroy's medical evidence, he was engaged in shooting Yates on
the river-bank a mile away. How could this killer possibly be in
two places at the one time?"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector thought over this point for a moment.</p>

<p>"But Yates himself must have looked in the window, watched where
we hid the note&mdash;and then killed Wilkinson," he pointed out.
"Even though he was the murderer instead of the victim, how did
Yates manage to be in two places at once?"</p>

<p>"He wasn't," Jeffery replied. "He looked in at our window at
ten-thirty and murdered Wilkinson on the riverbank five minutes
later. Because he had a motor-car with the bound reporter in it
waiting a street away. He could have easily covered that distance
in five minutes, driving the car.</p>

<p>"But what occurred to me was the fact that the murderer could be
in two places only by split-second timing. It meant the most
meticulous planning&mdash;planning by a person who must have known
every move in advance&mdash;must have known that Yates intended
visiting us that night (a thing that Yates, had he been innocent,
was most unlikely to mention to anyone), must have known the exact
route Yates would take on his way home, must have known exactly
what time he would leave this place, and a dozen other details that
no one save Yates himself could have possibly known. You follow my
reasoning?"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector nodded. "But I can't understand why Yates,
after giving us the envelope, should take the risk of breaking in
here to change it. Why couldn't he have left the envelope we
found&mdash;the one with the warning from Blackbeard inside
it&mdash;why couldn't he have left that one here in the first
place?"</p>

<p>Jeffery looked reproachful.</p>

<p>"My dear Chief, has the coffee drugged the grey cells? Remember
that even while Yates was sitting here on that night, you wanted to
open the envelope and look at the contents. If that first envelope
had contained Blackbeard's warning and we had opened it, Yates
would have been exposed outright!" He paused and shook his head.
"No, Chief. Yates was taking no risks about our honour. Although it
is a guess, I believe the first envelope contained the name of Dyke
Wilkinson. Thus, if we did break our word and open the envelope, we
would have merely found a fresh suspect to add to our list.</p>

<p>"The planting of the second envelope was a brilliant stroke of
cunning. It not only prepared us for putting the name of Yates to
the disfigured body on the riverbank, but it also made it appear
that Yates had really been shadowed that night. Who would ever
conceive that, having given us one envelope, the same man would
break in and substitute a second. On the face of it, the idea was
preposterous!</p>

<p>"Then why leave the first envelope, you may ask? Because Yates,
knowing that the next day we should examine an unrecognizable body,
wanted to impress the idea deeply in our minds that he (Yates) was
in deadly peril of his life. He wanted to give us a motive for his
death! Once Wilkinson's body was buried as Yates, the murderer had
a clear run. Where he obtained the idea of the substitution of the
bodies in this last murder, will be clear to you as I explain.</p>

<p>"By his visit, however, Yates cleared up one bewildering point.
You recall his 'suggestion' as to how the murderer may have escaped
from the Sheldon apartment? That the killer may have taken the key
from the Judge's pocket, locked the door, and returned the key to
the pocket when he returned on the following morning after the
discovery of the murder? Yates, unless I am much mistaken, used
that very method himself! I learned from O'Connor that he was one
of the first persons on the scene of the Sheldon killing and that
he and the other reporters examined the body before O'Connor
searched the dead man's pockets. Thus he had plenty of opportunity
to slip the key in the waistcoat pocket."</p>

<p>Jeffery crushed out his smouldering cigarette-butt before he
continued.</p>

<p>"Now we come to the greatest inconsistency&mdash;the mistake
which cost Yates his life and revealed to me the whole amazing
truth just when hope seemed most feeble.</p>

<p>"Think back to that Saturday night, Chief. Yates was, you
remember, sitting in a chair holding a glass of whisky in his hands
and acting the part of the gallant hero in fear of his life. Then a
gust of wind blew open the door. Yates started so violently that he
rather overdid it. His hand, closing about the thin glass,
shattered the edges, and the jagged fragments inflicted a deep cut
on his fingers. He had to use a handkerchief to stop the bleeding.
Remember?</p>

<p>"When I examined the supposed body of Yates on the river-bank, I
was conscious of another discrepancy. I couldn't think, at the
time, exactly what it was, but was there at the back of my
mind.</p>

<p>"I came back that night and tried to reason it out. I pictured
Yates as we saw him last, sitting there with that glass in his
hand. Then that thrice-blessed door blew open and you made the
remark that my nerves were in no better condition than
Yates'.&mdash;Yates, who on the previous night had started and cut
his hand on the glass. Then the discrepancy was clear. The outflung
hands of that body on the river were unmarked by so much as a
scratch! Now, how could that wound on Yates' hand have healed in a
day&mdash;not only healed, but disappeared altogether in less than
twenty-four hours?</p>

<p>"We were faced, Chief, with a direct contradiction of facts.
Yates had left our rooms with a deep cut on his hand. The next
afternoon his body was found with hand without trace of the wound.
And here was the point that immediately occurred to me&mdash;the
body was faceless. We had no corroboration of identity from that
angle. Then an amazing possibility occurred to me. The body on the
river bank was not Yates! And with that realization, the whole
monkey-puzzle fell into position. Can you wonder why I behaved like
a wild Indian that night?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you explain?" Read demanded.</p>

<p>"Because, at that moment, there was nothing to explain, except a
wild theory that you would have laughed at," Blackburn replied. "My
next step was to discover whose body it was. Hoskins was behind
bars. Hillier's gaunt frame was out of the running. Torrance was in
hospital. Gilbert Lascelles was alive that afternoon, for I had
spoken to him after leaving your headquarters. The only other
person was Dyke Wilkinson. When I left this room, I hurried around
to his rooms, to learn that the reporter had been missing since
Saturday afternoon. That strengthened my suspicions. I took a
photograph from his rooms and called on Mrs. Bowes' servant. She
identified the photograph as a likeness of the man who called with
Val Sheldon&mdash;the man who had said that 'the thing was in the
bag'."</p>

<p>"Now, consider those words! 'In the bag.' Has it occurred to you
that the phrase may have been a colloquialism? Say, for instance,
Wilkinson had suspected Hoskins of the murder of Sheldon, say he
had crime down to warn Biggs and had straightaway gone to Hoskins'
rooms with Val Sheldon to discover more evidence. Isn't it
extremely likely that, believing he had a water-tight case against
Hoskins, he would say to Val Sheldon, 'There's nothing to be afraid
of now. The thing's in the bag'&mdash;meaning, of course, that the
whole investigation was finished?"</p>

<p>Jeffery grinned. "Because, according to Val Sheldon, that's
exactly what did happen. Wilkinson, believing Hoskins to be the
murderer, came down on that Saturday afternoon to warn Biggs and
was seen by Yates, who arrived at noon. Then Wilkinson went to his
rooms for lunch, changed from his brown suit to a blue and, ringing
Val Sheldon, went to Hoskins' rooms. Yates followed him and the two
men met. Then it was that Wilkinson told Yates about his suspicions
of Hoskins. This gave Yates the idea of planting the hand on
Hoskins, which he did that night.</p>

<p>"Now, although Wilkinson did not suspect Yates, that person knew
that if Hoskins could prove a definite alibi for his movements on
the Saturday, suspicion must inevitably fasten somewhere else. And
already Wilkinson had proved too astute for Yates' peace of mind.
There and then the idea of killing Wilkinson must have been
born.</p>

<p>"Of course," Jeffery continued. "I knew nothing of these things
at the time. All I knew was that Wilkinson suspected who the
murderer was and that Wilkinson was missing. Then could it be
Wilkinson's body that we had found? When I left this room last
night, I intended going to Cairnside. But first I wanted to be
certain about the identity of that body. So I stopped at the city
morgue.</p>

<p>"Wilkinson, I knew, wore a moustache. Was that why the lips of
the third victim had been removed? Uncovering that body, I did
something that took pure nerve. I bent over that mutilated face and
examined the edges of the wounds with a magnifying-glass. And on
the corners were traces of black hairs. Those lips had carried a
moustache! Then the body was Wilkinson's!</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;where was Yates himself? Unless he was being kept
prisoner somewhere, he must have heard of the murder and come
forward to explain. Yet he had not. That left two explanations.
Either the prime mover in these murders was an unknown person
entirely out of our sphere of investigation who was keeping Yates
prisoner&mdash;or else Yates himself must be the murderer. As I
stood in that morgue, trying to grasp this incredible truth, I
found every hitherto irrelevant factor slipping into place to form
one inescapable conclusion.</p>

<p>"Here was an explanation of the split-second timing on the night
of the third murder. Of the so-called perspicacity of Yates in
fathoming how the murderer got in and out of the Sheldon apartment;
of the Biggs murder when Yates, instead of being the man who warned
the tradesman, was the actual murderer; of the envelope exchange
and a dozen other riddles. Whatever way I turned I found no other
solution for the terrible list of occurrences.</p>

<p>"But what was the motive? Was Yates a homicidal maniac, striking
down for the sheer lust of killing? But I refused to accept this
explanation. Then I realized that the final clue must lie with that
patient in the Cairnside Mental Hospital."</p>

<p>Jeffery Blackburn lit a second cigarette. The Chief Inspector,
his arms folded across his chest, did not break into the pause.
Presently Jeffery continued.</p>

<p>"I'll skip the needless details," he resumed. "Because it's a
long enough story as it is I was shown into the room of this
patient, young von Rasch, and he told me one of the queerest
stories I've heard in a long time&mdash;a story that could have
only happened in these post-war days and which made the whole
business clear as daylight.</p>

<p>"More than six months ago, this young chap joined up with a Dr.
Bernhardt Meyersen, who was at that time living in a lonely mansion
out on Henbane plains, some miles from Greycliffe prison. This was,
you will recall, about the time of the Dowling escape.</p>

<p>"Meyersen was a genius at plastic surgery and he had fallen foul
of the police in Vienna over some scandal with a wealthy woman. He
took refuge in this country with his mind soured against police and
legal authority. He told von Rasch that Dowling was hidden in
his&mdash;Dr. Meyersen's&mdash;house, and that he was going to use
him as an experiment.</p>

<p>"He was going to give Dowling an absolutely new set of features
so as to render his identification impossible after the operation.
Then he would keep the man as living proof of his genius. Von Rasch
was to act as Meyersen's assistant during this operation.</p>

<p>"But the first necessity was to account for the disappearance of
Dowling. Meyersen had in his laboratory a corpse such as are used
in hospitals and universities for experimental purposes. He clawed
the face away, dressed the body in the convict's uniform, and left
it in a creek for the warders to find. The body, found a month
later, was buried as Dowling, and there that part of the business
ended. Meanwhile, the real criminal was lying in the Meyersen
laboratory and the operation of grafting new skin on his face was
taking place. Now, Chief, this is not nearly as fantastic as it
sounds. Plastic surgery made wonderful strides during the war, and
to-day it is a fairly common, although expensive, operation among
the wealthier women. We often read of screen stars and actresses
submitting to treatment after sustaining injuries in accidents.
Also, we have to remember that Meyersen was at the top of his
profession."</p>

<p>He paused to draw on his cigarette.</p>

<p>Read said quietly:</p>

<p>"So that's where Yates&mdash;or Dowling&mdash;got his idea about
the substitution of the bodies in the last murder?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. As a matter of fact, I believe it was while undergoing
this operation and during the period of convalescence that Dowling,
as we must now call him, planned these amazing murders. Remember,
Chief, Dowling had been a brilliant novelist before his attacks of
madness overcame him. His fiction plots were extraordinary. He was
labouring under a perverted sense of injustice, and realizing what
a wonderful opportunity the new face would give him, he set about
planning the greatest crime-plot of his career. He brought to it
his imagination coupled with cold logic. Week after week as he lay
there wrapped in bandages, unable to see or occupy his mind in any
other way, he was perfecting his infamous schemes. There were four
long months of planning behind these murders, since it took
Meyersen 'that long to complete the operation. At the end of the
fifth month the doctor began to treat the scars with new skin. And
midway through the sixth month the operation was complete. Oscar
Dowling had disappeared. In his place stood Martin Yates, younger
and with a handsome regular set of features, without a single
betraying scar.</p>

<p>"For some weeks prior to this, the doctor allowed Yates to move
about the house and even went so far as to teach him a smattering
of anatomy and elementary surgery. Now, Meyersen, believing Yates
to have been merely an ignorant brute without brains or
imagination, never dreamed that he would want to leave him. After
all, Meyersen held his secret, and again, Yates was getting good
pay as a handy-man about the place. But the doctor had reckoned
without those long months of scheming. Yates waited until one night
when Meyersen and a big servant had gone to Henbane for supplies.
Then he attacked the young von Rasch with a poker and made his
escape. Von Rasch, struck savagely about the head, recovered
sufficiently to give chase to the railway-line. There he collapsed
and remembers nothing more until he awoke in the Cairnside
Hospital."</p>

<p>Again Jeffery paused.</p>

<p>"Now that Yates is dead by his own hand," he continued, "we have
no way of filling in the blanks save by guesswork. We know that
Yates reached the city and in some way obtained a position with the
Associated Press. He was, remember, a splendid journalist and was
well equipped for the post. A few weeks later he was shifted to a
position in charge of the office, where he would be on the inside
of all the information. It was a wonderful opportunity, and he
grasped it&mdash;the opportunity to revenge himself on the society
which he believed had wrongly sentenced him to the living death of
a labour prison."</p>

<p>"Yates was a mental case, of course?" asked Read.</p>

<p>"Decidedly. He was the dangerous mental type with too much
imagination and little regard for human feelings. He had brooded on
his supposed wrongs for so long that he had actually come to
believe them. Added to this were his periodic fits of insanity."
Jeffery broke off. "But I'm getting ahead of my story.</p>

<p>"I had cut from a trade paper a photograph of Yates. This I
showed to the young patient, and he immediately identified the face
as that which Meyersen had given to Dowling. Then I realized that,
if the young man would co-operate with me, I had in my hands a
powerful weapon by which I could lay the murderer low.</p>

<p>"You see, Yates was assured that, with Wilkinson dead, his
secret was safe. Only three persons knew of his operation, and they
were unlikely to connect that with the Centenary crimes. Another
thing was that Meyersen and his servant, returning and finding
Yates gone, naturally became afraid of their action coming to the
ears of the police. Where they went is not known, but one may
surmise that they lost no time in getting out of the country, and
Yates naturally concluded that von Rasch had fled with them! He had
no idea that all this time the young man was in the hospital. But
if he were to find out, I believed that he would leave no stone
unturned to blot out this last surviving clue to his identity.</p>

<p>"So I arranged for the trap in the room at the 'Britannia', with
von Rasch as the bait. A story in the 'Courier' was the lead. We
grabbed our friend as he walked into the trap." Jeffery spread his
hands. "And so to bed!"</p>

<p>Read nodded. "Very conclusive," he returned. "But you're wrong
in one detail, son. You presumed that Wilkinson must have rung up
Val Sheldon and asked her to come around to Hoskins' rooms. As a
matter of fact, the girl met Wilkinson outside quite by
chance."</p>

<p>"What was she doing there&mdash;and what's her association with
Hoskins?"</p>

<p>A shadow crept across the Chief Inspector's face. "Seems I owe
that girl an apology," he said gruffly. "Hoskins, you see, was
trying the old blackmail game again. He'd got some letters
implicating Lady Sheldon in one of Sheldon's shady deals, and he
wrote to Val Sheldon asking for a certain sum of money for their
return. The girl considered the matter for a week, and on that
Saturday morning of Biggs' death drove into the city to pay the
money. Hoskins had the letters in a black bag and was probably
going to meet Miss Sheldon, when that reporter woman saw him.</p>

<p>"Val Sheldon and Hoskins had lunch together, and the latter,
seeing that the girl was anxious to get the correspondence, popped
up the price. The girl was furious and refused to pay the extra.
They parted. Later in the afternoon, however, she decided to bow to
the servant's demands and went around to Hoskins' rooms. That was
where she met Wilkinson. Hoskins, however, had left to visit Lady
Sheldon. The girl, suspecting this, gave chase and caught Hoskins a
few miles out of the city as he was changing trams. Miss Sheldon
took Hoskins into her car, when the police grabbed them. That's why
the girl had to tell all those lies&mdash;to protect her mother.
Anyhow, the result will be bars for Albert Hoskins and apologies to
Val Sheldon."</p>

<p>"Very sincere apologies, I hope," the young man said quietly.
"That girl seems to have had a raw deal all through this
investigation. No wonder she flew off the handle the last time we
tried to question her."</p>

<p>A short silence fell. It was broken by Read, who asked:</p>

<p>"When did Yates trap Wilkinson?"</p>

<p>"Must have been shortly after the two left Hoskins' rooms,"
Jeffery replied. "We can imagine that Yates asked the reporter to
come into his apartment and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;have a drink. All
he had to do was to drug the drink, and Wilkinson was in his power.
After Yates left this cottage on the Saturday night, he merely had
to change clothes with the drugged man. Remember it was a full moon
and everything was planned to the second."</p>

<p>Read was silent for a moment. Then he looked up.</p>

<p>"Why did Yates use a reporter's paper-file for the murder of
Judge Sheldon? One would have thought that an article so closely
connected with the profession would have been the last thing to be
chosen."</p>

<p>Jeffery crushed his cigarette in the ash-tray. "That was his
damnable cleverness again," he explained. "He worked through all
the murders on the theory of reversed or inverted evidence. He knew
only too well that such a distinctive weapon as a paper-file could
point to only one set of persons&mdash;the reporters on the case.
Yet the very oddness of the weapon was his safeguard, since it
appeared to have been chosen for the reason of throwing suspicion
on the pressmen! It actually had the property of turning our
attention away from the murderer, since we would argue that only a
madman would use a distinctive weapon that was a direct finger-post
to his guilt. In other words, he deliberately laid suspicion on
himself, knowing all the time that we would never take that
suspicion seriously, but would look for a person diametrically
opposed.</p>

<p>"Also that same cleverness extended to his apparent inability to
furnish an alibi on the night of the Sheldon murder. He told you
that he could give no satisfactory account of his movements. Now,
no guilty person would dare make an admission like that&mdash;they
would have provided themselves with a water-tight alibi, or so we
would have reasoned. You see, Chief, paradoxical as it sounds,
Yates actually avoided suspicion by deliberately casting it on
himself&mdash;but in such a manner that we refused to take that
suspicion at its face value!"</p>

<p>"And the ten-year-old cable implicating Hillier was another
attempt to plant false evidence?"</p>

<p>"I believe so. About that time Yates must have begun to worry
about the crimes not turning out just as he had planned. The
discovery of the old cable gave him an excellent opportunity to pin
suspicion on the evangelist."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector rose and crossed to the window. He stood
looking out for some moments before he spoke. There was a faint
note of awe in his voice.</p>

<p>"I can scarcely believe it's over, son. When you consider those
crimes and what lay behind them, it's amazing. Never anything in
criminal records like it before."</p>

<p>"Nor again, I hope." Jeffery came across and joined his friend
at the window. "I've had quite enough of crime for a considerable
period. You know, Chief, it was only by a most unforeseen incident
that we unearthed the truth. But for that, we would have still been
stumbling about in the dark."</p>

<p>He placed his hand on the other's shoulders. His voice was very
quiet. "And next time, Chief, luck may be on the side of the
criminal. Remember that before you start heaping congratulations on
my bowed but blushing head."</p>
