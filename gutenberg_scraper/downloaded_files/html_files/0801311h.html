<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="poem">"The poor old horse, must go of course,<br>
If cars have come to stay,<br>
The engine is the greater force<br>
And so must have its way."<br>
The gossips had their say. The poor old horse, since then
perforce<br>
Has gone. Ah, lack-a-day!<br>
God rest his bones! The wind intones<br>
For him a heartfelt lay.</p>

<p>It was in those days, so lately fled, when horseless carriages
were a curiosity beyond the seaboard. Some young bloods had made
the journey from Sydney to Melbourne in one as the most
enterprising adventure at command following the picturesque
performances of the Boer War, and had thereby rendered themselves
as glamorous as minor flight pilots of later years. Desirous of
inspecting the country which produced their high-priced staples, a
few German or French wool-buyers had penetrated by car to the
Southern Tableland, but these were foreigners, and in local
consideration, their potentialities were outweighed by their
peculiarities.</p>

<p>It was another pair of sleeves when Sandy Lindsey and his son
Ross came back from Sydney with a car of their own. Motor cars
became a personal and local concern from Canberra to Brindabullah,
Bombala to Yass, and back again to Bandicoot, and the kernel of
gossip. Nothing had so titillated the neighbourhood since Mabel
Barry "went wrong."</p>

<p>There was panic among the horses. Even the most ring-boned and
sluggish, as though of instinctive premonition, stood on their
tails and with terrified snorts and breathings, regardless of
culverts or cuttings, backed from the devilish monster which
threatened their existence. Horse breeders were derisive. Wait till
the horseless wonder started up when no one was in it and careered
over a precipice or crashed into a shop window in Monaro Street!
Such evil-smelling, unnatural contrivances should be stopped by
law. What were innocent women, mothers of large families, to do
when a man had the right to make the roads unsafe for them? People
who drove cars were murderers.</p>

<p>Such a clack, but a salutary change from morbid preoccupation
with varicose and renal or uterine derangements.</p>

<p>The ordinary cackled as the ordinary do concerning each advance
or innovation: the percipient and young were interested: none but
were curious and agog to see the notorious contraption. From
Bungendore and Tharwa, Uriarra and Gininderra everyone approached
Queanbeyan hoping to see the new machine traversing the plains: to
have seen it scattering the horses in Crawford or Monaro Streets,
or standing before Walsh's Hotel, was achievement.</p>

<p>William Barry from Bandicoot expressed loud contempt. He
condemned Lindsey's possession of the car as to be expected from
such a flash jackass. Lindsey would be rightly served if the
fakement ran away from him down the Eight Mile and broke his neck.
If the car frightened his horses Barry wasn't going to wait to have
the law on Lindsey, but would thrash him in Monaro Street for all
to see. He ached for e justifiable demonstration against Lindsey.
This was his unwavering attitude towards Lindsey operations. Many
jokes were current about each new ebullition. So far, he, Lindsey
and the car had not met in Queanbeyan or elsewhere. Such a meeting
was the luck of Dora Barry, seldom allowed abroad alone owing to
her father's notions.</p>

<p>Mabel, the elder daughter, never went to Queanbeyan or Yass at
all&mdash;never. This seclusion was connected in Dora's mind with
Mabel's weak heart: that the symptom was isolated had not yet
occurred to Dora. Mrs. Barry was also a confirmed home bird on
account of headaches, so it was usually Dora's father who
accompanied her abroad. She was a great pet with him and when
inclined could wheedle him to her needs.</p>

<p>She sang with natural ease and her voice was much admired by
those who heard it raised in the tuneful Weatherley melodies. She
had mastered the piano according to local standards, from her
governesses, and now that the days were growing longer, had coaxed
her father to let her take singing lessons. Owing to the singing
lessons and contrary to custom, she was allowed to go to Queanbeyan
unattended.</p>

<p>It was a glorious season and the combination of lambing and
foot-rot had on one or two occasions made Father too busy to give a
whole day to going to Queanbeyan for a trivial singing lesson. On
the other hand, he was paying three whole guineas per quarter in
advance for those blasted lessons, an enormous outlay for a bit of
foolish ah-ing and squeaking&mdash;sheer robbery and
impudence&mdash;worse than the bushrangers. And if a day were
missed not to make it good! What was the world coming to, full of
every kind of swindler bent upon making money without honest work.
However, Barry was in the power of this extortioner and meant to
have the worth of his guineas.</p>

<p>Thus Dora, under weighty, injunctions as to behaviour, and on
Challenger, one of the best saddle hacks extant, had ridden to town
alone one fine Wednesday. She set off gleefully, elated by her
freedom.</p>

<p>"What on earth could happen me, Daddy?" she demanded, using her
pet title, permitted on emotional occasions and to her alone. To
other members of the family he was strictly 'Father.' "No one on
the road could catch me on old Challenger, and there aren't any
bushrangers."</p>

<p>But Father's suspicions were deeply rooted in spleen, in the
stock allegations against human nature, and alas, in disastrous
experience.</p>

<p>The girl skimmed across the plains which were pullulating with
spring, a fair Monaro breeze whipping her cheeks to a deeper pink,
and Challenger dripping with the sweat of too much green food and
too L exercise. She had the coveted singing lesson and returned
home in less time than allocated. Her father's careful questionings
elicited nothing beyond that she had eaten her dinner at the Royal
in company with old Slattery and his wife and Rose Ann from
Whipstick Crossing.</p>

<p>Dora omitted to mention that she met Ross Lindsey bang in the
middle of Crawford Street, riding his black racing colt, but newly
broken. The colt had lately succeeded a prize-winning trotting mare
that was the delight and envy of the youth of the district. Unable
to resist a glance at the new colt, Dora had found Ross looking
back after her. Caught in the act, she smiled. Ross promptly raised
his hat and smiled in response, showing a set of teeth, long, white
and narrow-arched&mdash;most fascinating. She was disappointed not
to encounter the car, but this was something.</p>

<p>On the second Wednesday of her escape from tutelage she had
better luck. Entering the town a few paces past where the Hotel
Queanbeyan to-day catches the winds and the full glare of the sun
without a sheltering tree, she branched down Campbell Street on an
errand for her mother, and when she turned into Monaro Street,
there before the Royal, for which she was bound, she discerned the
motor car. She cantered up so as not to miss her opportunity. The
engine was running and the approaching Challenger acted like any
green two-year-old. He snorted and backed, and when his rider urged
him forward, he reared uncompromisingly. Dora applied the whip.
Challenger gave a ripping exhibition, which Dora and all the
quickly gathering loiterers immensely enjoyed. The girl, sprucely
habited, with her pretty tackle on the shining blood was a glad
sight; she sat so easily and the horse capered so perfectly.</p>

<p>Lindsey, Sr., dived out of the bar and stopped his engine. Ross
sprang towards Dora, who now rode around into the hotel yard. Ross
followed. "Miss Barry, I presume," he said with a little excess of
manner, which old Barry regarded as flash hypocrisy, but it was
delightful to Dora. Ross would have been a dunce to presume her
other than herself, as they had been reared on the same ridings,
but Dora was of an inexperience to value conventionality. Ross
hoped she had not been alarmed. With a "Permit me," he unstrapped
her music and handed it to her with effusive compliments on her
handling of the startled horse.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing! Old Challenger is as easy as a rocking
chair," deprecated Dora, flushing rosily.</p>

<p>"You could carry everything before you if you only rode at the
Show."</p>

<p>"Father would never let me be what he calls 'conspicuous'," said
Dora, hurriedly escaping, regretting the brevity of the encounter,
while to prolong it was beyond her. Ross let her go with a gallant
sweep of his hat plus another smile.</p>

<p>All through her singing lesson Dora was wishing such exciting
happenings could be repeated, and was delighted when she went to
dinner upstairs at her hotel, to see Lindsey already seated in
company with old Slattery. They were talking politics and took
little notice of Dora, but when she was leaving the room, Lindsey
rose and opened the door for her, bowing with exaggerated courtesy
and expressing regret that he had frightened her horse. Dora never
had had anyone open a door for her, and thought it wonderful
manners on Lindsey's part. When she later rode out of the hotel
yard, Lindsey, Sr., was issuing on the veranda with Slattery, and
gravely raised his hat again. A glorious and entertaining day.</p>

<p>"The gurrl remoinds me," remarked Slattery in an important and
reverberating whisper, "that 'tis a pity owld Blastus wouldn't be
afther burying the hatchet."</p>

<p>Lindsey himself during his courtesies to Dora had been thinking
peace would be good business, but he dismissed his neighbour's
observation with a nod and continued their discussion.</p>

<p>Dora thought of the inspiring encounter all the way home, all
the way across the rolling treeless plain guarded by its lone
English spire, till leaving the shouldered masses of Black Mountain
and Ainslie the view widened again beyond the Eight Mile, showing
Bandicoot Hill like another Mount Ainslie all bald and tamed in the
distant foreground, and beyond it piled the vallary beauty of the
Tinderies, the Bimberies, the Brindabullahs&mdash;all the blue and
timeless splendour of the Murrumbidgee Ranges.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="poem">He raised his hat with winning smile,<br>
She turned her head, but no word said;<br>
She laughed, and that is all.<br>
But as a fire in grasses tall,<br>
When wind is high, a smile or sigh<br>
Can carry young love many a mile.</p>

<p>In warm weather it was old Barry's custom to snooze after
mid-day dinner, to have tea about three-thirty and then work till
dark. He was getting up in years and a division of the day was
grateful to him when practicable. He had no need to slog now, but
ceaseless industry had been his youthful habit and he clung to its
semblance by rising at dawn and ignoring the time he spent on the
verandas. He extended his formidable vision with a pair of
binoculars, and any man thinking ca'canny tactics would pass on
Bandicoot Hill Station was speedily undeceived. Old Barry's muscles
had developed first as son and then as owner, ringing, felling,
grubbing, scrubbing and burning-off on its wide acreage. He was so
proud of his battle against the trees that he would never admit
that Bandicoot Hill was too treeless. In later years never a
blackberry, briar nor castor oil plant remained to hide from view
sheep, horse or man. The proprietor could sit on one of his
verandas and inspect the home paddocks of rolling country or
foothills intersected by the main road and also by a stream, which
can be herein known as the Bandicoot River, though it is otherwise
written on the map. If he contemplated mustering in the other
direction, he could look up to the treeless peaks of his own
ranges, and, locating his beasts, set out or depute a retainer. Nor
could his stock be driven off by marauders, unless on very dark
nights, always spread out under his eye as they were.</p>

<p>Hardly a tree showed to the top of the skyline behind the house
where the western sun hung, and high on the rim of the chief
peak&mdash;Bandicoot himself&mdash;a salt shed was outlined. Beyond
that edge were gullies and gorges still untamed backing into the
mountainous region which has since become Federal Territory and
summer relief country. Here Bandicoot was bounded by part of
Lindsey's run, and much of Lindsey holdings remained "unimproved."
Old Barry's opinion of Lindsey's back paddocks was so familiar as
no longer to be amusing.</p>

<p>Barry spent hours on one or other of his verandas doting on his
peerless Vermonts, prize-winners unbeaten in a wide radius
including Cooma, Bombala, Yass and Goulburn. In the hot weather it
was the family's custom to have afternoon tea on the back veranda,
a comfortable retreat shaded from the sun and sheltered from the
famous Monaro winds.</p>

<p>The day that Dora encountered the Lindseys was unusually hot for
the time of year, so the family moved out. Father, through the
binoculars, recognised Dora, a speck five miles distant across the
ridges, and she arrived before the tea things were cleared away. A
spirited horse going homeward and ridden with youthful zest ticked
off the miles in record time. She put Challenger in the stable to
cool a little before he could have a drink, and made her way
through the big white gates of the backyard, feeling no fatigue
from nearly fifty miles in the saddle since early morning, an
arresting figure of young womanhood in her form-fitting habit of
dark cloth, smartly held. Galloping in the breeze and blazing
sunlight had made her delicate cheeks fiery red, and she pulled off
her neat felt hat and white veil showing a mass of red-gold hair
restrained in a heavy plait but escaping in shining tendrils around
her snow white brow and ears.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mick!" She nodded with disfavour at a man in dark
shirt and working trousers, who was eating his tea at the edge of
the veranda. He never raised his hat to her. He did not know enough
to take it off when on the veranda. He sat on his
hunkers&mdash;when there were plenty of seats&mdash;his jungle
beard wagged as he ate, and she knew his eyes were slyly aware of
her every detail. How nice if she could have come home to find a
young man like Ross Lindsey present instead of this one.</p>

<p>She even looked with disappointment at her father, who had his
shirt sleeves rolled up exposing his broad forearms, tanned as
brown as leather. He too had a brushwood beard, differing only in
colour from Mick's. Why couldn't he trim it neatly like Mr.
Lindsey's, and not look so much and so complacently the old
bush-whacker? Nevertheless she advanced upon him, kissed him
filially and proclaimed that she was starving.</p>

<p>"Better hurry," remarked her mother, "or Arthur will have
everything gormandised."</p>

<p>Arthur was her younger brother. There was only ten months
between him and Dora. Some said there was not seven months, which
is the key to a relationship of which Dora and Arthur alone were
ignorant.</p>

<p>"Is there any mail for me?" inquired Dora, noting the papers
strewn about. On mail days Mick Bell, under excuse of collecting
his own mail, of which there was rarely anything but a circular,
would ride in from his selection beyond Lindsey's, picking up the
Bandicoot bag at the turn-off as he came. Governor, his fat old
nag, a cross between a coacher and a light draft, was flinching the
flies off his flanks under the hawthorn trees near the stables.</p>

<p>"There's this," said Father, self-consciously producing a parcel
from behind his chair.</p>

<p>"Anthony Hordern and Sons&mdash;goodie! What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's addressed to you, not me."</p>

<p>"Save the string," said Mother.</p>

<p>"I was in such a hurry, I forgot," said Dora, sawing with a
knife.</p>

<p>A length of fine white muslin, laces, ribbons and sashes
billowed from a packet weighted with a fashion book. Everyone
crowded to look, even Mabel the elder daughter, who was
thirty-seven, and looked forty-five, and thought of nothing but
work.</p>

<p>"Aw! Girl's stuff!" said Arthur contemptuously, wrinkling his
freckled nose.</p>

<p>"Did you expect a pipe and bowyangs for Concertina?" said Dora,
looking with animosity towards Mick's knees, and thinking he'd be
out of place if anyone like Miss Lindsey called. "Oh, Father, you
are a duck-a-down-dilly for keeps."</p>

<p>Satisfaction beamed from Father's large red face as he bent
himself from behind the newspaper for Dora's hug. "Make it up nice
and pretty from the book, for your birthday, and I'll get your
photo taken in it for Christmas...There's never anything in this
dashed rag, I don't know why I pay for it," he observed, tossing
the paper aside. It was seized upon by Mother, who had been waiting
for it.</p>

<p>"Aw, I wish I was a girl," complained Arthur. "Dora always gets
everything."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Arthur. You hill the potatoes as Father told you
and I'll see that you get a Christmas present too," said
Mother.</p>

<p>"Aw, a pair of Blucher boots I suppose, w'en me toes are acting
potatoes outer these. Why can't I have me photer taken too?"</p>

<p>"You an' me could be took together to scare the crows from the
turkeys," offered Mick.</p>

<p>"Don't choose a style too hard to do up and make more work,"
said Mother.</p>

<p>"I'll do it up for you, Kiddy," said Mabel. "You make it just as
pretty as you can."</p>

<p>"You're a trump, Mabel! I'll make a dress for you too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want anything gay."</p>

<p>Mabel brought Dora some fresh tea, and Father inquired
concerning her day in Queanbeyan.</p>

<p>"I forgot in the surprise of the parcel. I've seen the great and
wonderful motor car; and didn't old Challenger just play up!"</p>

<p>"There's a long article in the Queanbeyan Courier about it,"
remarked Mother.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Father. "You might have had the politeness to
mention it."</p>

<p>"You ought to have seen it. You had the paper first."</p>

<p>Father snatched the paper and after reading for a few minutes
shouted: "Him, blast him! The bleeding skunk is not fit...</p>

<p>"What is the matter now, Father? Everyone has known this three
weeks or more that Lindsey has a motor car."</p>

<p>"Matter, woman! Matter! One of the lowest blasted scoundrels
that ever walked God's earth..."</p>

<p>Father became incoherent as he tore the paper across and stamped
on it. Dora pieced it together and began: "'Our readers will learn
with pleasure...'"</p>

<p>"Our readers&mdash;be damned! With pleasure, be damned! Never
let that blasted rag come inside the house again!"</p>

<p>Unmoved by so familiar an outburst, Dora proceeded, "'Alexander
Lindsey, the popular owner of...'"</p>

<p>"Good God! Pop'ler! A jail bird at large&mdash;pop'ler!"</p>

<p>"But that's the way to be popular," interjected Mabel.</p>

<p>"'The popular owner of Chesham Park'," persisted Dora, adding
her comment. "Good for old Sandy! He ought to call it Wombat Castle
and be done with it. He'll be an English lord next if he doesn't
take care! What a lark!"</p>

<p>"I knowed the place w'en it was Dead Horse Crik," contributed
Mick Bell, and added gratuitously: "He's been made a Justice of the
Peace."</p>

<p>"I wonder he wasn't that years ago," said Mother.</p>

<p>"A J.P.! The first thing he ought to do is give himself ten
years without the option. Blasted..."</p>

<p>"Listen! Listen! to the book of words. 'Mr. Lindsey, who is a
leading pioneer of the district...'"</p>

<p>"A leading cattle duffer is nearer the mark..."</p>

<p>"'Has converted what was at his coming primeval forest...'"</p>

<p>"Primeval forest, be blowed! It was just bush&mdash;poor wallaby
scrub most of it, not near as good land as Bandicoot. That's
written by some of these townie liars that are wrong in the
head."</p>

<p>"'...primeval forest into a valuable estate'."</p>

<p>"Estate be blasted! He started like the rest of us. We had a
good bark hut before he was born. I am the King Billy pioneer of
these parts among them that's still living, mark my words! My
father put up the first slab hut this side of the Murrumbidgee. All
the world came to look at it. Sandy Lindsey never came here till
thirty years ago, and where did he come from? Nobody knows. R'ared
in some town I suppose. He came here and sat down on the tail of my
coat. I treated him white..."</p>

<p>"'Mr. Lindsey was the first in the district to instal the
telephone'," proceeded Dora.</p>

<p>"So as he can listen to other people's business&mdash;the
crawler! I wouldn't have a telephone if it was put in free."</p>

<p>"I wish we had one," murmured Mother.</p>

<p>"I knowed him when he hadn't a second shirt to his back,"
inserted Mick in his lingering drawl, as though he lacked
sufficient bellows force to propel the words from his beard.</p>

<p>"You always knowed everyone when he hadn't a shirt to his back.
Must have been in the Garden of Eden," rebuked Dora, and continued.
"'Mr. Lindsey, who has done more for the district than any man in
it, is again to the fore in purchasing a motor car'."</p>

<p>"More for the district! He was only a new chum. He didn't know a
stringy-bark from a brittle gum till I showed him..."</p>

<p>"An' he never can see w'en another brand ain't his own to this
day," slyly assisted Mick.</p>

<p>"Gosh, man! You're right there. And he couldn't ride an old
milking cow, that's why he's got this&mdash;motor car."</p>

<p>"He doesn't need to ride a milking cow that I can see; that
would curdle the cream," observed Dora, antagonised by Mick's
pandering to her father's bile. "A car would get him miles and
miles ahead of a horse, let alone a cow."</p>

<p>"You'll see him sitting in the bog out there by Slattery's and
he'd be glad of a cow&mdash;or a team of bullocks to take him home,
mark my words! With all his flash motor car he never has known
enough to run a fire break."</p>

<p>"I knowed him w'en if he wanted a w'eelbarrer he'd have to
borrer it."</p>

<p>"Yes. I wet-nursed him, and how did he reward me?&mdash;By
duffing my cattle and riding the tails off my horses while I was
down with a bad back. Now it's a motor car. Some dodge behind it
I'll swear, like the time he got his advance on my sheep."</p>

<p>"All the same, Mr. Lindsey spoke very nicely to me."</p>

<p>"He would! Them snakes in the grass are great at speaking
nicely. But what right had he to speak to you at all?"</p>

<p>"He was having dinner at the Royal."</p>

<p>"I've left two hotels because of him, and if I have to leave a
third...Never let me catch you having anything to do with a
Lindsey."</p>

<p>"There's not much danger. I don't think they'd find us stylish
enough to touch with anything but a roping pole. Ross Lindsey
said..."</p>

<p>"How do you know what Ross Lindsey said?"</p>

<p>"I met him face to face in the hotel yard. He had as good a
right to be there as I had, and I couldn't bolt like a piker with a
hot brand on her hide. It was so silly, we laughed, that is
all."</p>

<p>"Enough too! Laughed! I'm sorry that a girl of mine wouldn't
know better than to lower herself by laughing with a Lindsey. A
Barry and a Lindsey could never laugh together except in hell."
Father had assumed an arch-episcopal tone which was droll to Dora.
She laughed.</p>

<p>"What are we to do then&mdash;pipe our eyes?"</p>

<p>"Now my girl, don't be pert. Nothing is gained by treating
serious things flippantly, and this is more serious than you know.
Lindsey and his brood of vipers have done that to me which can
never be undone in this world, nor forgiven in the next."</p>

<p>"Now Father, that about the next world is a little too
strong&mdash;blaspheming against God, I call it, and Dora, you've
had enough argument with Father now. Let Lindsey and his motor car
alone: time will show whether it's a success or not."</p>

<p>Father, checked for the moment, took up his glasses and scanned
the landscape.</p>

<p>"A good deal of castor oil down there near the peppermints,
Arthur." The lad could always be pounced upon when other quarry
eluded.</p>

<p>"Aw! It grows like old boots with all this blooming rain,"
defended Arthur between gobblings.</p>

<p>"Cut it out before it seeds," commanded Father continuing his
long-range inspection. "Two or three of those old ewes look like
foot-rot. Did you notice them as you came along, Mick?"</p>

<p>Mick evaded. "I reckon you're the only man I know can see the
condition of a beast seven miles out on the run."</p>

<p>"And there're too many cotton tails there for my health.
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five. I must take a go
with the poison cart and get One-eyed Sam in there with his dogs.
Gosh! I never saw such a season. We'll have a devil of a time with
fires if it turns dry with all this grass."</p>

<p>"All the same, Bandicoot is cleaner of rabbits than any place
this side of the watershed," commended Mick.</p>

<p>"God bless me soul, I'd have it as clean as the backyard if it
depended on me, but with a J.P. running a breeding ground for all
the vermin known next door...but now that he has a motor car we'll
have the millennium before they choose the Federal Capital. Well,
this won't do. Are you staying the night?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind if I do. Old Governor has a bit of a stone
bruise."</p>

<p>"It's lucky it's always near here when things happen old
Governor," said Dora.</p>

<p>"Run the cows in with him and turn him out. He'll get his belly
too full anywhere now...Too much grass! If it's not drought, it's
fluke and foot-rot...Now Arthur, are you going to see those sheep
through Stringy-bark, or am I? Mick can give us a tune on the 4
concertina to-night."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious Arthur, are you never going to be done!"
exclaimed Dora, rescuing the tea cloth from a clumsily held
teapot.</p>

<p>This pricked Mabel. "A pretty thing if the boy can't even have
enough to eat."</p>

<p>"Enough, yes. But he must be a boa constrictor."</p>

<p>"Growing boys never know when to cry crack," said Mother
pacifically. "But get along now, boy. You'll have another chance as
soon as your work is done."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Dora's stuck-up because she has a new dress," said
Arthur, grabbing a final supply. "Dora, the Roarer, the
Rick-stick-storer; the Reebor-Ribor-Cock-tailed Dora! Dora's
growing a moustache!"</p>

<p>"And Arthur wishes he was&mdash;always looking in the glass to
see if it's coming," countered Dora.</p>

<p>"A moustache!" said Father ponderously. "Never let me hear you
say a coarse thing like that about any decent woman&mdash;or an
indecent one either. If you do, I'll give you such a skelping that
you won't sit down for a week. Mark my words!"</p>

<p>"He only meant it in fun," said Mabel tensely.</p>

<p>"Well, get about your business and come back at once and don't
get talking to the drover."</p>

<p>"I was torkin' to him w'en he came larst night, an' he arsked me
w'at relation I was to old Blastus&mdash;that's w'at he called you,
Father. An' I told him he was a mutton-head, that you were my Dad.
An' he tried to shove it down my throat that you are my
grandfather. He bet me a bob. He said to arsk you an' see how you
took it. Some of these blokes try to be funny an' don't know how, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"You mind your business and let the drover mind his," said
Father, helplessly mild, and added: "Leave old Challenger
saddled."</p>

<p>"Orl right! But that's w'at that bloke said." Arthur went out
through the back gates, slashing with his stockwhip and whistling
for his dog.</p>

<p>Mabel took refuge in the kitchen, but not before Mick Bell could
wink at her.</p>

<p>"Dora, before you change your habit, are you man enough to run
the horses from the River paddock and pick out those we want? I
promised to go and look at that fistula on old Mother Turpey's
mare."</p>

<p>Dora put on her hat and taking a stockwhip went out the back
gate with Concertina Mick. Despite her attitude he found her
irresistible and now offered her his hand to mount. Dora was off
before he could attain old Governor to accompany her. She looked
back and flipped roguishly at him with the whip, calling out:
"Mick, I knowed old Challenger before he had a saddle to his
back."</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="poem">The old, quaint songs, alas, are sung,<br>
Their singers gone to come no more,<br>
But mem'ry lingers softly strung,<br>
And sweetly sound the chords of yore.</p>

<p>Old Barry moved in and out on various chores and roared to
Mabel: "Bring me a bottle of that balsam I made up when Bally was
down."</p>

<p>Mabel produced it with her ceaseless, tireless efficiency and
disappeared again quickly before her father could say anything.</p>

<p>"I'll ride around by the travelling sheep. They'll do a service
to eat down a bit of the grass, but in the name of reason can you
understand a man who would say a thing like that to the boy?"</p>

<p>"People like to say something nasty that they know will sting,
and if they've been given the chance, you have to put up with it,
and grin on the other side of your face."</p>

<p>"I believe it would have been better to bring him and Dora up
knowing. We've only got to face it some day."</p>

<p>"It's better for the young people as it is. Say nothing and it
will pass over." Mrs. Barry continued to tickle the earth in her
flower pots on the back veranda of the house. It was connected with
the kitchen veranda by a wide awning of galvanised iron supported
by adzed gum posts. She was a placid looking woman with mousy brown
hair going grey, screwed in a bun at the back and frizzed in front.
She was wearing a dress of zephyr and a large white bibles apron
with crochetted lace on the hem. Her husband often bent to her will
as the boisterous do to the meekly-mannered. He took his coat off a
nail on a post of the kitchen wall, and his old donkey supper hat,
with the fly veil, from a peg near-by, and, after inspecting
himself in the mirror for men's toilets, went off to his
neighbour's aid.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Turpey kept the post-office and a lolly shop several
miles away on the roadside. There was also a blacksmith shop when
"the boys"&mdash;her grandsons&mdash;were home; but they had some
weeks since gone clown the Riverina shearing and thus she had sent
for Barry. Everyone sent for him when in need. Practical experience
upon industry, strength and innate giftedness gave him unsurpassed
knowledge in all that appertained to the land on the Southern
Tableland. He knew more than all the stock inspectors, vets, and
agricultural collegians combined, and never jibbed at a request for
help or advice. In addition, he was always at hand. He had had but
few trips to Sydney in his life, and since he had reached fifty
rarely went farther afield than Queanbeyan once or twice a week, or
to Yass occasionally.</p>

<p>As he dropped out of view in the direction of Turpey's, Tom
Harris, who lived beyond Lindsey's on the other side, hove into
sight on the ridges Queanbeyanwards. He was driving a score of
mixed cattle he had picked up to put on the surplus grass that the
season promised, and as one of the animals had developed a swelling
that he did not like, he left the herd in an angle near the
Bandicoot while he came to the homestead for Barry's opinion.</p>

<p>Tom was a long, narrow, awkward young man, who did not know what
to do about his hat. He lacked the courage to raise it with the
dash of Ross Lindsey, or the fortitude to keep it tight on his head
as did Concertina Mick, and between two minds generally foozled it.
He was wearing a greasy felt hat and coloured shirt, grey moleskin
trousers, with leggings, and hobnailed boots. He was entitled to
equal social standing with the Lindseys, and financially, Blastus
was fond of declaring that he had a banking account of his own
while all that Ross had was his father's overdraft.</p>

<p>In the hope of seeing Dora in passing, he had contemplated a
mid-week shave, but had funked at the last lest such lah-de-dahing
might announce what was just dawning on himself, that Dora could
attract his ten-stone-eight ten or twelve miles as easily as a
magnet a needle.</p>

<p>He rode up and asked Mrs. Barry for the Boss. She invited him
in, and he, hoping to see Dora, entered sheepishly and then told
his business about the cow. Mrs. Barry explained her husband's
absence and his sure return by dark. No word or sight of Dora. Tom
arose in the attitude of a man fearing his garments may slip, and
murmured: "I must he getting back or the beasts may stray."</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry advised him to put his stock in the paddock and stay
the night. Tom mumbled something unintelligible and withdrew, still
in trouble about his hat, peering into it and circuitously
shuffling it into place. Nevertheless he was sufficiently tenacious
of purpose to hang about till the return of Barry, who was firm
about the cattle being put in the paddock and Tom staying the
night. It would be easier to diagnose the cow's infirmity by
daylight.</p>

<p>"What's your hurry? There's plenty grass, and Mick can give us a
tune on his hurdy-gurdy."</p>

<p>Dora later found Tom washing on the kitchen veranda with her
father and looked at him contemptuously. The encounter with Ross
Lindsey and his father had grown a new bud on her standards.</p>

<p>After the evening meal they gathered in the "best" room, a
ceremonial apartment dedicated to the piano and enlarged
photographs of Barry's champions. The latter, elaborately framed as
for the Royal Academy, were hung all around the walls, and a
growing array of trophies rested on a silver tray on a sideboard.
Anti-macassars of elaborate crochet, and fat cushions of wool-work
covered every available space. There were also some photographs of
people. It was the day of photographs and silver frames. It was
Dora's ambition to have photographs of celebrities standing about
as certificates of social standing as the clergyman's fife had in
her drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mick Bell was a celebrated performer on concertinas and such and
owing to this proficiency was known as Concertina Mick, or more
intimately, Concertina. Dora hated Mick and his accordion. His
beard also offended her ripening womanhood. The male social lights
of the younger broods were clean-shaven to a man. Mick's beard, of
a rich brown with scarcely a grey hair despite his fifty years, was
the variety that sprouts on a chin never scraped, and as wide east
and west from the cheeks as southward from the nose. A veteran pipe
usually marked the whereabouts of his mouth.</p>

<p>Tom borrowed the razor he had secretly given Arthur two years
before, but even at that date it had been "as blunt as a butter
knife," so Tom did not look much better for its passage.</p>

<p>Father had an ear for music and was proud of Dora's singing and
mastery of the piano and it was irritating to her that he insisted
upon her singing now when she was trying to acquire the new method
of the expensive teacher from Goulburn. She was perforce overborne
because Father thought he knew as much about music as merinos. The
evening was an increasing trial to the girl. She sang the old songs
demanded by Dad: "We wandered to-day to the Hill, Maggie"; "Her
bright Smile haunts me still"; "Shades of evening close not o'er
me";&mdash;-the tried favourites with which he had courted his
wife. Tom sang "Sweet Belle Mahone," to Mick's accompaniment, and
with his eyes closed, and also "The Letter that never came." In
response to his request Dora sang: "Then fly with me across the
sea, and leave the wo-o-rld behind, for here am I-I, to live or
die-i, as you prove hard or kind, as you prove ha-a-rd or kind.
Oh-ah-ah-la-ah, as you prove ha-a-rd or kind."</p>

<p>Tom was entranced, unable to discern that as she trilled she was
filled with discontent and craved the inspiration of a more
congenial audience than sleepy sawny Tom, and Mick with his large
beard and nipping remarks.</p>

<p>Between numbers Father detailed the symptoms of Turpey's old
hollow-backed mare, and asked Tom's advice.</p>

<p>"It sounds like a fistula," he offered. "But I wouldn't venture
with an expert like you in the field."</p>

<p>"Tom's makin' a track to Dad's heart to git near Dorer,"
whispered Concertina aside, taking himself farther, if possible,
from Dora's regard. She was relieved by Arthur's demand for "Where
did you get that Hat?" This made Arthur chortle, but he was sent to
bed well before nine o'clock. Father's bright idea was to leave
Dora and Tom in the parlour for a little chaste companionship amid
the champions. Dora was nearly a woman now, and he meant to look
ahead for her. No use in going against nature. Dora developed
unknown fatigue, and Tom was too Bauch to improve his opportunity,
so they all wound up in the kitchen where Mabel provided tea and
cake, and a fire which was still cosy in the evenings.</p>

<p>Dora was noticeably uncordial in the morning when Concertina
offered to give Tom a hand, and Father went with them to see the
cow. Father so disapproved of her attitude that he decided to speak
to her. He came back after seeing the cow and called for morning
tea to further that purpose. He had no hesitancy. He sat down on
one of the cane chairs on the veranda, and began: "Dora, I want to
speak to you."</p>

<p>Dora was assisting her mother to give the pot plants a spring
overhauling. These were in a varied collection of buckets, boxes
and kerosene cans set on stands like stairs all painted green.</p>

<p>"Come and sit down and listen properly when I speak to you."</p>

<p>Dora was wrestling with a justicea in a mutilated toilet jug.
She halted, pot in arms, but did not make any remark.</p>

<p>"I want to speak about your behaviour. If you want to be pop'lar
you shouldn't be so snippy to Mick Bell. It's not lady-like."</p>

<p>Dora had no desire to be popular with Mick Bell. "I thought you
said it was the sign of a jail bird to try to be popular."</p>

<p>"Now, my girl, I've told you before not to be pert. Mick Bell is
as fine and honest a man as you'll find; and he'll have a home of
his own when some of these flash squibs are sold up by the
bailiffs."</p>

<p>"Old pipe-sucker! He'll get lost in his beard one of these days.
You ought to run a fire break in it for him."</p>

<p>"And there's Tom Harris," proceeded Father undaunted. It would
never penetrate his self-complacence that he could be out of touch
with the heart of a girl or a youth.</p>

<p>"Gawpy-looking object!" said Dora, equally undashed.</p>

<p>"There's not a finer young fellow in the district than Tom.
Honest and steady and unassuming. You'll never see him too big for
his boots."</p>

<p>"That would be hard when they reach from here to
Brindabullah."</p>

<p>"That's silly exaggeration. He doesn't want flash boots like a
jockey or buck-jump rider when he's about his work. He shows his
sense."</p>

<p>"He doesn't even know how to raise his hat."</p>

<p>"Any girl who gets Tom will be lucky."</p>

<p>"If he was the last man on a desert island with me, I wouldn't
allow him to save my life."</p>

<p>"It's lack of judgment to pass by solid worth for fal-de-rals
that are negleegible. I wanted to talk to you yesterday when you
came home from town, but Mick Bell was here. Don't let me hear of
you talking to Ross Lindsey or the old man again. It's the thin
edge of the wedge."</p>

<p>"What wedge?" said Dora, letting the pot crash.</p>

<p>"Now let me know best in this, my girl. Ross Lindsey has got
himself up in a scutty turn-out with buttons on the sides of his
pants and long boots like a circus rider, and rides a flash horse
that isn't half so flash as himself, but it isn't in his breed to
be a white man. I've sworn that if ever a Lindsey attempted to
darken my door again I'd take a gun to him myself; and if ever one
of mine darkened the door of a Lindsey, I'm done with her for ever.
Don't let me have to say this again."</p>

<p>Dora felt rebellious, but there was nothing she could do. She
sat down and crossed her knees exposing slim ankles which looked a
picture amid her flounces. Father became pontifical.</p>

<p>"My girl, I don't want to talk about these things, but never let
me see you sitting in that loud way. It is the first symptom of a
girl going to the dogs, like a fast woman, if she is immodest about
showing her lower limbs. You'll never have a man respect you if you
act like that." Those were the days when a man could not name a
male animal correctly in the hearing of a "refined" woman.</p>

<p>"I don't want a man to respect me. I'll disrespect a man for a
bit of a change," said Dora, relieved by this opportunity for
opposition.</p>

<p>"Hush! You don't know the world. I do."</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, Dora, don't come to issues with your father
over nothing. It upsets me so that I can't sleep, and you're
shirking your work with these pots."</p>

<p>Mother, though she condemned Dora's standings-up to her father,
found them an alleviation of stagnation, Dora put her feet
genteelly together. She was chafing to end her father's dull and
familiar homily, and to be rid of her mother's tiresome old pot
plants, in order to practice her singing lesson and try a new song,
and plan her new dress, and day-dream of what might happen the next
time she went to Queanbeyan, still six days distant, and no
possibility of anything happening till then.</p>

<p>"If you get bold and flippant," pursued her father, "you'll have
to give up flashing about to town and help Mabel and your mother
with the work."</p>

<p>This was alarming. If Father got his bristles up he would be
capable of wasting the tuition fee, or of making the teacher return
it. Dora capitulated.</p>

<p>"All right, Father. I didn't mean anything. Old Lindsey only
came to the Royal to see Mr. Slattery about something. They're not
likely to be there again."</p>

<p>"What could he be after old Slattery for? Old Slattery ought to
have more sense than to have anything to do with Lindsey."</p>

<p>"It's no use of trying to stampede others to your way of
thinking," observed Mother among her pot plants.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="poem">The row began farther back, they say,<br>
When Chesham Park was Dead Horse Creek,<br>
And bandicoots not far to seek,<br>
Tho' the little dears are scarce to-day.</p>

<p>Dora was not allowed to ride to town on the following Wednesday.
Her father drove her as usual and Ross Lindsey kept as carefully
out of sight as a mosquito on La Pampa when dragon flies appear.
Dora had a good lesson and was commended for her progress, but it
was all a little dull, lacking a motor car about the streets or on
the road to provide entertainment, and with no good-looking and
prohibited young man to take off his hat to her as if he meant it.
Not even Tom was in evidence to offer relief as something to snub.
There was only old Slattery with his big red face and jew lizard
frill of beard from ear to ear under his jaw. Rose Ann Slattery was
slightly more interesting at dinner when she talked about the party
to provide funds for the hospital. She wanted to know if Dora was
to attend.</p>

<p>"You're old enough now, Dora. Now's the time to dance and enjoy
yourself. Ross Lindsey is a crack dancer. He waltzes like
heaven."</p>

<p>Dora said her father did not approve of dancing and that she had
no one to take her because Mabel had a weak heart, and her mother
was subject to deadly headaches. She brooded on that party and
Ross's ability as a dancer all the way home. Being unaware of the
main reason for the feud, she considered her father's dislike of
the Lindsey's excessive. She had heard about the sheep, and that
night asked Mabel to go over the old story in detail.</p>

<p>Lindsey once upon a time had seen a good opportunity to clear
£3,000 in a cash deal, if only he could raise £1,000 for a few
days. The bank manager was much impressed with his representations
but demanded security. Lindsey offered his sheep&mdash;four
thousand picked ewes for which he said he would not take £1 per
head. He had been measuring the banker, new to the district, and no
stockman.</p>

<p>He suggested driving the banker out to inspect. It was urgent.
They would barely have time to see the sheep before dark. Lindsey
had the intrepidity and the power of quick decision of a gambler.
He knew Barry to be away in Yass. As he passed Bandicoot that
morning he had seen the magnificent ewes in the paddock near the
roadside, where they had been put to eat clown young briar shoots.
Chance favours the daring.</p>

<p>They reached the sheep just as the sun was sinking back of
Bandicoot and the ewes streaming up a hillside to camp for the
night. They couldn't have been better arranged for inspection by a
couple of drovers. Lindsey tethered his horses to the fence, and on
foot hurried the callow bank man into the paddock among the
bleating merinos. Even he could estimate that it was an exceptional
flock in exceptional health and condition, as was everything under
Bandicoot management, always.</p>

<p>The bank official was so impressed that he would have been
willing to risk his personal savings on such security. The sheep
were all branded with a big BB, but as they were in long wool it
was not decipherable by the inexpert. It never occurred to him that
he was the victim of a trick.</p>

<p>"I didn't realise you had such beautiful sheep, Mr. Lindsey;" he
repeated. "A photograph of such a flock should be in the papers. Do
you win many prizes?"</p>

<p>Lindsey said something about it being too rough on sheep to drag
them about to shows. On finding that the banker was willing to make
the necessary advance, Lindsey apologised profusely that he was
unable to take him home with him for the night. He must
unfortunately hurry back to Queanbeyan to send a telegram. He must
act instantly&mdash;business before pleasure. The bank man fully
understood. The jaded horses were whipped back across hill and
plain, the travellers freezing in the wide wild winds that sweep
over Canberra and Queanbeyan from the snow-capped Muniongs.</p>

<p>The bank man further understood Lindsey's need for secrecy till
the deal was through, but later it was through the banker that the
story became current. Lindsey never said a word himself. This was
his defence when eventually tackled by Barry. He also urged his
necessity. He had known the £3,000 was certain if only he had
£1,000 with which to operate. It was a simple harmless dodge that
injured no one and comforted the bank manager. If Barry had been at
home he would have asked him, but Barry snorted at that. The story
added lustre to Lindsey. Only Barry and the banker were
dissentient, and the laugh was against them.</p>

<p>Dora listened with unusual attention to the old story, putting
her own interpretation upon it. She found it amusing, and in any
case, as it had been before she was born, she could not see that it
mattered now. Ross too had only been a tiny thing in those
days.</p>

<p>Mabel, alarmed by this attitude, marshalled other instances of
Lindsey's lack of principle. Dad had "copped" him once making off
with Bandicoot cattle, but Lindsey as usual had wriggled out of the
situation. Dora didn't see why her father alone should be
policeman, and she be guarded from the Lindseys as if they were
contaminating, when they were courted by everyone in the district
and out of it. Dora put it down to the general silliness of old
people.</p>

<p>She knew there was another grievance with regard to Sid Lindsey
jilting Mabel, and that Father seemed to feel worse about it than
Mabel herself, in fact he acted as if it were a big disgrace. But
that too had been before her birth, and she had never seen Sid
Lindsey nor heard of him anywhere about the district. She wanted to
ask Mabel the particulars of that story too, but it was not so
approachable as the one about the sheep deal. Mabel was awfully
good to shield her from work. There was never any danger of Mabel
"telling on her," but in this Lindsey business, and when Dora
wanted to go abroad alone, Mabel lined up with Father, which Dora
put down to Mabel's advanced years.</p>

<p>She sat over the blackening coals with Mabel pondering the case.
Dad, though fiery of temper, would surely not threaten to shoot
Lindsey because Sid had changed his mind about marrying Mabel.
Better to keep quiet and not let the Lindseys know it mattered. It
made Mabel cheap, Dora considered. Some reserve about Mabel made it
impossible for her to open the subject direct.</p>

<p>"Don't you think there must have been something else?" she
prospected. "Lindsey must have stung Dad's vanity deeply in some
way that he doesn't say anything about, but just lays it on the
sheep deal and a few other things. Instead of being so jealous and
raging, why doesn't Dad get up in society himself. He easily could.
I'd like to find out what is really the matter."</p>

<p>Dora retired and sat for a time on the edge of her bed,
embowered in her bright tresses, her Mind busy. She was full of
concrete discontent and vague longings, for what she hardly knew,
except that something should happen&mdash;romance, adventure,
action to fill the days.</p>

<p>Mabel remained in the kitchen crouching over the dying coals.
Dora's curiosity about old dead days frightened her. She shivered.
The day must come when Dora would learn the truth, and Mabel
steeled her heart. She had thought it dead long ago, but through
the years it had recovered somewhat and when Dora should come to
knowledge and repudiate her it would be a blow.</p>

<p>Dora was a clever girl, she could not permanently he kept in the
dark about anything, also she was of an uncompromising disposition
and would not assume innocence to keep up appearances. She already
suspected that Lindsey's sharp practice could not be the real
reason for so solid a feud. She would one day learn that the
families had remained on visiting terms and marrying prospects till
one dread day Mabel had stood before her father's terrible rage.
Her mother, in a delicate condition preceding the arrival of Dora,
had fainted dead away, and at intervals until Dora's birth her life
had been despaired of.</p>

<p>Barry had taken his daughter's fall so hard that all the
district rocked with the tragedy. Dave and Bob, the elder sons,
taking their tone from their father, had threatened to shoot Sid
Lindsey and traipsed about the bush with loaded rifles. So much
rage was behind their threats that their mother was relieved to
have them leave the district for a time. Mrs. Lindsey and Mrs.
Barry had tried to retrieve the disaster peacefully by marriage,
but the boys wanted murder. Old Barry, too, was violently against
marriage, the only stand possible to his hurt pride.</p>

<p>Lindsey swore that Sid must marry Mabel or leave home and the
district for ever, and meant it. Sid was recalcitrant. He put
restitution to Mabel beyond possibility by marrying a barmaid in a
public house in Yass. Gossip said he did this to be safe from
Mabel, and also that he had been between two guns and married to
spike one of them. In any case, Lindsey fulfilled his threat and
forbade him the paternal roof for evermore.</p>

<p>The young Barrys went away to Queensland and had never been back
since. Altogether a terrible business for both families, though
Bandicoot saw only his own side of it.</p>

<p>Mabel stayed on at Bandicoot, caring for her mother, rearing her
boy&mdash;when he came&mdash;becoming the household drudge. She
never brooded on her case or put it forward. No one realised that
she had one. Expiation was her lot. She worked and worked, a
miracle among housewives, her service accepted as unconsciously as
the sunlight or the rain. As soon as he was able to hold a tomahawk
or cow's teat, her boy too worked always, knowing nothing else on
Bandicoot, and nothing beyond Bandicoot.</p>

<p>The Bandicoot homestead became a hermitage. As it paid no
visits, in time no visitors came to it. On the other hand, Chesham
Park (it was but lately that park had been substituted for creek)
took an upward trend after that £3,000 in cash. Lindsey,
emboldened, made one coup after another. He ascended in the social
scale and became firmly familiar with the pioneerage of the
district, some of the households with pretentions approximating the
landed gentry of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>Barry remained where he had started socially. He could not be
ignored as a pioneer squatter whose beginnings were as early as
any, and whose antecedents were more blameless than many. His
father, employing a social boast in days when there were free and
Government men, maintained that he and his father before him never
had a key turned on them in their lives. Barry was highly esteemed
for his honesty, for his ever-ready services to all neighbours, and
his sound financial ability and pastoral knowledge, but his women
and those of the would-be seigniorial cliques did not know each
other.</p>

<p>Half a dozen years since Lindsey had built a fine stone house,
and following this, Kate Lindsey had Chesham Park boldly embossed
on her stationery. Fiercely loyal to the adzed gum posts of his
verandas, Barry boasted that he had built his own house whereas
Lindsey couldn't drive a nail without hitting his thumb with the
hammer.</p>

<p>Georgina Lindsey, who had gone to the smartest school in Sydney,
took advantage of her training to marry young Judson of
Cobbramorragong, near Bungendore, whose sister had married a son of
a seignioral and historical family of Queanbeyan district. In spite
of Sid's disgrace and banishment with a barmaid wife&mdash;daughter
of a bullocky-selector&mdash;Lindsey thus put the cap on his social
connections, while old Barry foolishly made his daughter's disgrace
a chain ball about the leg of his.</p>

<p>He had raged for a week about the Judson-Lindsey-Cameron
alliances and the rottenness of these jumped-up people, giving
themselves such infernal airs, all of them without any principle,
and with pedigrees that could not stand nearly so strong a
search-light as his own. If there was anything he despised it was
this society frill and flummery. Dishonesty and immorality and a
tissue of lies. There was old K&mdash;&mdash; of G&mdash;&mdash;,
one of the superfine swells, with whom Lindsey had managed to crawl
in, like a native cat after the fowls, and it was well known that
Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash; could never keep a housemaid because of the
old man. No respectable ettler would allow his daughters near the
place. Barry adduced other cases, all authenticated, enough to
stuff a pillow case or the columns of the Queanbeyan Courier, which
went to show that the society of Counties Murray and Monaro was
like that of most other counties and boroughs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry had an unerring facility in deflation. "If you don't
like society and think it's rotten, what does it matter to you, as
you can't get in it?" she would logically demand. "And if Lindsey
can get there, that takes him off your beat and you ought to be
satisfied."</p>

<p>"But woman, think of the principle of the thing! Setting himself
up, and a man's brands are not safe with him."</p>

<p>"There are lots of others who don't set themselves up who are
the same about brands, so I don't see what that has to do with this
argument."</p>

<p>"But goodness me, there's..."</p>

<p>"You're jealous, Father. That's what's the matter with you. It's
a terrible thing to have a jealous disposition. You make yourself
unhappy for no cause. Let Lindsey get up in society without a
pedigree, if he can. What's the use of you having such a fine
pedigree if you don't get into society with it. You can't use it
for anything else that I can see. It's not like a sheep's. I'm
always thankful that I haven't a jealous disposition."</p>

<p>What a triumph for Barry had he known how little was thought of
the society lights of County Murray by those of the English shires
and boroughs. The effect on him of the knowledge that there were
sets which denied that Australia had any endurable society at all,
was not to be computed, except apoplectically. How he would have
acted-towards those who in ignorance and prejudice considered any
swarthy Australian "Eurasian" or otherwise tarbrush, goodness alone
knows, but Wm. Barry was so perfect a flower of his Own
environment, that lacking interest in any other, he was saved much
useless and irritating information.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry would have been content could visits to Mrs. Lindsey
have continued. It would have enriched her life to gloat even
second-hand and vicariously on the social doings around Queanbeyan.
She was not socially ambitious. She was the daughter of a brumby
selector far up the Bandicoot. It had been a great social lift when
young Barry of Bandicoot Hill Station had married her and brought
her to a sthall home on the place, and later, when the old Barrys
died, to the main homestead. She didn't know what her great
grandfather nor even her grandfather was, whether free or
Government men, and she did not care. She was satisfied with a
pedigree inferior to her husband's, one reason her marriage
continued to be a personal success. As a rule men prefer inferior
wives. The superior can be so uncomfortably supertoploftical.</p>

<p>Bandicoot was the best-fenced, best-improved place in the
district, and magnificently watered. Too much timber had
disappeared but Barry had corrected that by buying a selection on
his back boundary from which excellent timber for all purposes
could be procured. No drought or other crisis was able to leave
Barry without a bank balance. Even the nabobs envied and respected
him for that. Lindsey rarely was free from an overdraft. But that
was his own business and did not prevent his family visiting Sydney
and appearing at the select races and shows and other social events
around Goulburn and elsewhere, and Chesham Park saw many
guests.</p>

<p>Barry kept his family confined to Bandicoot, a regime which ran
smoothly till that very spring had found Dora verging on eighteen
and restless for her birthright of fun and frolic and youthful
companionship. Nature was very grand before and behind Bandicoot
Hill, but it was singularly desolate to Dora's hot young heart
expanding to life. Two or three young folks about her own age would
at that date have made a social centre of a camp, and an unrivalled
theatre of delight of Queanbeyan or Yass. The banal stagnation of
her days would have been electrified, but she had little to do or
see and champed her bit from one week to the next on Bandicoot. No
callers but swagmen, drovers, or the odious Tom Harris and
Concertina Mick, or old Slattery (without even Rose Ann who would
have talked of those matters about which she longed to hear). Was
ever such social bankruptcy!</p>

<p>She planned and re-planned her new dress. Dad was of the old
brigade that insisted on his women doing their own dressmaking, and
Dora's talent had ripened with practice.</p>

<p>The plains were glowing with bluebells, trigger plant, creamy
stackhousia, the little pink tetratheca thymifolia and other
flowers. Magpies, butcher and soldier birds, leatherheads, thrushes
and warblers filled the day with music. The orchard was a
paradise&mdash;the apple trees bridal bouquets with fluttering
butterflies; the pear and cherry trees bridal veils, and the quince
trees with a beauty of their own. The premises were hedged about
with yellow broom and roses, old-fashioned hardy bloomers richly
smelling. The flower beds were tightly packed posies of foxglove,
snapdragon, verbena, sweet william, gaillardia, ranunculus, iris,
calliopsis, lupin, larkspur, columbine, balsam, candytuft,
gypsophila, pansies and other sweet friends. The wistaria shook out
its exotic perfumed glory on the wide awning between house and
kitchen, and was again the wonder of the district. It had been
measured, photographed and reproduced in the Town and Country
Journal.</p>

<p>The young lambs cried on the hillsides, the frizzy-tailed foals
frisked with the soft young calves, chickens and ducklings ran
about like balls of fluff. A burgeoning world was around Dora and
her heart expanded with it. One of the most glorious inland views
on the globe unfolded before her every time she went abroad but she
scanned it only in the hope of seeing the magic motor car or a
dapper rider on a spirited black colt, or sitting jauntily behind a
prize mare in a trotting spider.</p>

<p>When she missed this sight one Wednesday it was a long time to
wait till the next. True, she was free to ride about the station
and was frequently to be seen galloping towards the main road on
Challenger or on her own filly, Greygown. Lately she had taken it
into her head to tear down across the new bridge and disappear up
Dingo Creek which was a short cut to Chesham Park, otherwise six or
seven miles distant from Bandicoot Hill. She dug up some of the
maiden hair which abounded along Dingo Creek and took it home for
her pots, should Father be curious about her direction. Then she
would ride homeward by the road past Chesham Park gates about a
quarter of a mile from the house.</p>

<p>On one occasion she was lucky in seeing the motor car full of
people just about to turn in. Greygown was a nervous animal and
inexperienced. She behaved frantically, really bucking in her
fright and resentment of the monster, a pioneer among those that
have superseded the Challengers and Greygowns&mdash;God rest their
hooves!</p>

<p>Lindsey stopped the engine. The motorists were so alarmed for
the girl's safety that they capered to her assistance, but she
laughingly assured them all was well, and after bringing the
terrified filly to a standstill and petting her arching neck, went
off at a gallop, waving her handkerchief to show she was completely
at her ease.</p>

<p>In the car with Lindsey were Blackett, Federal Member for the
district, and Slattery and McTavish, the latter a lean old Scot
with a naked upper lip in the middle of a stiff white beard. These
two were neighbouring squatters but decidedly dunniewassals when
compared with the social standing attained by Lindsey. They had a
taint of the farmer about them and were mid-way between heaven and
hell, as Bandicoot Sr expressed it. That the trio were riding about
in the new car with Lindsey was such entertaining news that Dora
risked telling it that night at tea, as the evening meal was called
regardless of the bill of fare. Barry bit immediately.</p>

<p>"What were that old bogtrotter and that old sour belly
Presbyterian McTavish doing with Blackett in Lindsey's motor car?
Lindsey is very likely making-up to them for Rose Ann Slattery or
Jean McTavish for that flash circus rider. He's so pushed for
money, he's lowering the pedigree a bit&mdash;can't get the pure
toff to take his flash son. It's always easier for girls to marry
above them. Lindsey will be glad to rope in a goanna soon to save
bankruptcy. And what was Blackett doing there? I supported him last
election, but I won't again."</p>

<p>"Now Father, I think that downright silly," said Mother.
"Blackett has to look after his supporters even if they do buy a
motor car, and if he busied himself about their characters he
wouldn't find enough to put him in Parliament."</p>

<p>"But you haven't seen him here. Isn't my vote and yours and
Mabel's as good as old Lindsey's? and that old Slattery and
McTavish running about in a motor car&mdash;the old fools! Can't
they see that cars would only bring down the price of horses and
oats?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Blackett will come here to-morrow. He can't be in
two places at once," said Mother, bringing peace for the time.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="poem">Love is a duel more oft than a jewel,<br>
So I have heard them tell, my dear,<br>
So I have heard them tell.<br>
And 'tis Dan Cupid's merry jest,<br>
'Twixt enemies to give it zest<br>
It lacks where all is well, my dear,<br>
It lacks where all is well.</p>

<p>Dora quickly disappeared from the tea table, thankful to have
escaped her father's curiosity. She played and sang in the best
room under the aegis of the aristocratic merinos. She was delighted
with a new song, "Whisper and I shall hear," but early tired of
singing to herself. She longed for an audience other than those of
her own household, or Tom and Mick, and went to her room to dress
her hair in some new fashion and to try on her new dress, and dream
of what might be.</p>

<p>She was ambitious to go to the socially pretentious races and
wear ravishing dresses. "Miss Dora Barry on the lawn!" "Miss Dora
Barry in the saddling paddock!" What could she do as a kick-off? If
only she could sing as well as that girl who was such a rage two or
three years ago, and now in Paris studying!</p>

<p>Dora scarcely felt of prima donna weight. Neither did she feel
capable of writing a book as that other girl, about whom everyone,
even the old bushwhackers, made such a fuss. She was more practical
than artistic. If Father would permit her, she could ride at the
Shows, not only in Yass and Queanbeyan and Goulburn, but in Sydney
as some of the other up-country girls had done, who were not nearly
such good riders, as she was. Or if she had a chance to dance she
could undoubtedly eclipse that giraffe of a Rose Ann Slattery, who
had no ear for music and must wear No. 9 shoes like, "Oh, my
darling, Oh, my darling, Oh, my darling Clementine," in Arthur's
silly ass of a song; but Father was quite cracked about
dancing.</p>

<p>She blew out her candle early with the fervent wish that
something would happen, preferably something delightful and
eventful, but barring that, something&mdash;anything, it did not
matter what so long as it relieved a monotonous and prosaic
routine.</p>

<p>Something to happen was her last thought as she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Her wish was speedily to be answered generally and
particularly.</p>

<p>That very evening, as she slept, things were moving on the
general score at Chesham Park.</p>

<p>Old Smithers, the sitting member for the Weeowera district of
the State Parliament, in which were situated the holdings of
Lindsey, Slattery, McTavish, Barry and others, had whispered that
at the next general election, about a year distant, he was to
retreat upon a safe metropolitan seat which would not entail such
hard canvassing on his ancient bones. Blackett was desirous of
having Lindsey put forward as the candidate. A man of the district
for the district would be a good cry. Thus Lindsey was likely to
have another honour thrust upon him, and this meeting at Chesham
Park was a first and secret move among his supporters.</p>

<p>The possibilities were discussed when Mrs. Lindsey went to bed,
and her daughter Kate was flirting with a neighbouring squatter,
who bored her, but flirting was one of the few diversions open to
her. Ross was absent at a dance in Queanbeyan.</p>

<p>Up and down the gullies were a number of "cockies" who could
turn the election if they voted solidly. The big landholders were
sure to stand by one of themselves. Old Barry was the reason for
caution. His enmity was so bitter that he could not be expected to
vote for Lindsey, but if he would keep quiet and merely abstain
from voting as a protest, all would be well. If he would come out
on Lindsey's side it would be a walk-over. The danger was that he
would create an uproar, and, by sheer obstinacy, vote and canvass
for the other side. There was an even deadlier possibility that he
might oppose Lindsey himself. That would finish Lindsey's hope of
election and be a joke for the wags. Old Blastus had money and
energy and by his sheer ingenuousness would be a riot on the
hustings and capture every little man on the land in the
electorate. Hence the circumspection lest the Lindsey caucus should
be prematurely defeated.</p>

<p>"Shure we'd betther wait till we're ready," observed old
Slattery, "and the first gun be foired by Mr. Blackett, and you and
me, Mr. McTavish, as the two most important neeburs, could act
next."</p>

<p>"You're richt," said McTavish solemnly. "Wi' auld Blastus on his
side 'twould save us much money."</p>

<p>"Now if a deputation of prominent min loike you and me, Mr.
McTavish, and wan or two others, with Mr. Blackett and Mr. Smithers
at our head, was to put it to owld Bandicoot as a public matther
that his ill will is an obsthruction of public affairs, do ye think
'twould hilp anny?"</p>

<p>"'Twould need thinking on, Muster Slattery," cautiously
responded McTavish.</p>

<p>Lindsey being called to the telephone, discussion took a
personal turn.</p>

<p>"Shure, the only way to settle that now would be for the young
feller here to take up wid the gurrl."</p>

<p>"And I don't see how he could help himself," said the Federal
Member gallantly. "I never saw a prettier girl; and the way she
handled that horse!"</p>

<p>"And a power o' Biller. Auld Bandicoot is the richest mon i' the
distreect if you get down to solid assets."</p>

<p>"Sure the young feller couldn't do betther. Do you think now,
Mr. Blackett, that Lindsey would cotton to that?"</p>

<p>"I haven't an idea. Mr. Lindsey has never said a word."</p>

<p>"Ach, Sondy's the deep one. You'll never know what he'd be
thinkin' gin you'd wait till he tellt you."</p>

<p>As a result of their conclave it was agreed that Slattery and
McTavish should cautiously mound certain souls in the electorate.
They did not ascertain what Lindsey might think of a conjugal way
out of the feud. His manner did not invite sufficient
familiarity.</p>

<p>Magnetism, youth, romance, Cupid or what not was moving more
forcefully than political wire-pulling, and on the very next
afternoon.</p>

<p>At Bandicoot it was the hour when Father, awakened from siesta,
was scanning the roads or doting on his woolly darlings with the
aid of his binoculars. Mother was teetering with her equally
beloved pot plants. Dora was laying the tea on the back veranda.
Arthur, unable to restrain his appetite was spreading honey and
butter mixed on a slab of bread and devouring it. Mabel was
thumping resoundingly with a ten-pound sad iron. The elaborate
garments hung on a line to air testified to her industry and skill
as a laundress. She was neat and clean, but patently paid no other
attention to appearances. Her mousy hair, like her mother's was
drawn back severely and carelessly from her thin temples. She was
slightly bent, sunburned and wrinkled, and her hands were as horny
as a navvy's.</p>

<p>It was mail day once more and Mick had brought the bag. He
turned Governor out without subterfuge before coming in, as he was
to remain some days at Bandicoot and construct new stables for the
prize merinos. He was wearing a snake-skin belt, significant to no
one but Arthur, who instantly demanded one similar and then secured
some more bread and honey.</p>

<p>Dora snatched a gun from the wall and ran out. While observation
was on a hawk in the heavens, Concertina approached Mabel and
handed her a small parcel.</p>

<p>"What's that?" she demanded in a brusque whisper.</p>

<p>"Chocolates."</p>

<p>"I never take presents."</p>

<p>"It ain't exactly a present. I won 'em in a in a raffle and
thought you might have a sweet tooth. If you don't want 'em, you
can sling 'em to the chooks."</p>

<p>Mabel disappeared under excuse of a hot iron. It was so long
since she had been tendered chocolates that she was upset. A
bifurcated frilly garment fell on Mick from the line. He picked it
up and waggishly proceeded to examine it. His were days of much
humbug about women's underclothing. Mabel, returning, recovered her
self-possession by seizing the garment.</p>

<p>"You're a great ironer, Mabel," drawled Mick. "If you perked-up
in some of them fal-de-rals yourself you could hold your own
yet."</p>

<p>"How do you mean&mdash;hold my own?"</p>

<p>"To ketch a man, er course."</p>

<p>"Humph! About as useful as an alligator when he is caught. It's
the women who are caught, if you ask me."</p>

<p>A shot sounded from behind the kitchen and Mick moved away to
investigate, not without observing from the corner of his eye that
Mabel hid the box of chocolates amid the linen.</p>

<p>Dora returned swinging a dead hawk by its wing and stood the gun
beside the post. "There! I upset his duck house just as he was
swooping on Mother's turkeys."</p>

<p>"Mind where you put that gun!" aclmonished Father.</p>

<p>"It's not loaded."</p>

<p>"Hang it up at once. It's always the unloaded gun that kills,
mark my words."</p>

<p>Mick had taken down his accordion and was tuning-up.</p>

<p>"That sounds like the tune the old cow died of," said Dora.
"Take some tea and see if you feel better."</p>

<p>"Dora likes blokes to play the peanner," said Mick as a
reprisal. "I hear Ross Lindsey is takin' lessons again. I see him
as I come along&mdash;makin' this way. Oughter reach here just
about tea."</p>

<p>Dora had her father's complexion and turned a fiery red. She
loathed Mick and was exasperated to feel herself blushing. Mick was
triumphant to see his shafts go home. His gifts would have been of
infinite service to a fortune teller.</p>

<p>"Making here," said Father. "What would he be doing coming this
way?"</p>

<p>"Short cut," replied Mick with a sly wink at Dora. It was at
least seven miles out of the way to come by Bandicoot to get to
Chesham Park. Father turned his glasses on the road. Mick did not
need glasses. His eyesight would have made a telescope envious.</p>

<p>"It looks like the cut of that flash weedy colt of his,"
observed Barry with the glasses.</p>

<p>Arthur added the testimony of his sharp eyesight. Dora's heart
quickened. She busied herself with tea.</p>

<p>"Put his foot in a rabbit hole," drawled Mick.</p>

<p>"Golly! The horse went right on top of him," yelled Arthur.</p>

<p>"Some circus trick to get in here, I'll bet me boots," said
Father, lowering the glasses with feigned indifference. Dora
adjusted them hastily to her vision.</p>

<p>"His horse has got away from him," shouted Arthur.</p>

<p>"He's lying quite still. He may be killed." Dora's voice was
cold and dead. It sounded far away to herself. She laid down the
glasses and ran through the big white gates in the direction of the
road. Arthur bounded after her. Mick too sprang up with more
agility than his bowyanged knees promised, and pursued, all three
heedless of what Barry was roaring.</p>

<p>"Has there been an accident?" inquired Mother, placidly turning
from her pots.</p>

<p>"If there is, it's a judgment of God and nearly time."</p>

<p>"Hush! I don't think you ought to talk about God that way. Think
of his poor mother."</p>

<p>"There's plenty hot water if it's wanted," said Mabel, looking
into the kitchen. She set down her iron and came to where she could
get a view. As Father disdained the glasses, she picked them up.
"He's lying quite still," she remarked.</p>

<p>Mother claimed the glasses now. Mabel, feeling nervous and
unhappy, went back to her work, her unfailing refuge. In work alone
had she found refuge for more than seventeen hard years. Father
took down his whip and skelped an innocent dog to ease himself.</p>

<p>"Arthur is there now. The horse is galloping over beyond the
creek. It oughtn't to be let go home to startle his mother.
Couldn't you go after it, Father?"</p>

<p>Father growled like an old Hereford. No one knew what he said.
He did not know himself.</p>

<p>"He still does not move," reported Mother. "Mick and Dora are
picking him up and carrying him this way. You ought to go and help
them, Father."</p>

<p>"There's nothing the matter with him! I won't have him here if
there is. Never shall a Lindsey cross my doorstep and I know
it."</p>

<p>"That's all right in its place, but you couldn't turn away from
an injured man, if it was the devil. He may be dying. We must get
ready."</p>

<p>"Everything is spick and span in the spare room," said Mabel.
"I've only got to put the sheets on the bed."</p>

<p>"We'd better remove some of the things."</p>

<p>Mother and Mabel hurried into the house and began to remove
surplus furniture from the spare room. Mother in casual tones
called for Father's aid in shifting a wardrobe to give better
access to the bed. Father rumbled like a Hereford bull but acted as
obediently as a trained dog. He was very much master in his own
house. Mother never disputed his governance: she upheld it, but
managed to be heroine of her own domain.</p>

<p>When the room was ready, they went out to see the progress of
the first-aid party. Unskilled in carrying a limp form, the weight
was almost too much for Dora. Mabel went to the gates and laid them
open.</p>

<p>"Shut those gates," bellowed the Hereford now. "I won't have him
here."</p>

<p>Mabel's impulse to relieve Dora was checked, but she left the
gates open. Dora and Mick approached slowly step by step with the
slender, dark-haired form. It was quite limp, eyes closed, arms
dangling. Dirt encrusted the top boots and the smart grey corduroy
breeches like tights with the pearl button decoration that so
disgusted old Barry. One of the spanking long-necked spurs was
twisted.</p>

<p>"Don't bring that blasted son of a viper here!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, do come quick. I think he's dead!" cried Dora,
overburdened and distressed, her face flaming with emotion and
exertion.</p>

<p>"No Lindsey crosses my doorstep&mdash;dead or alive!" It was
Father's final gesture.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Father," said Mother diplomatically. "Take
him in the side way, Mick."</p>

<p>"Mother, is he really dead?" demanded Arthur, gambolling about
in the intoxication of the biggest adventure that had come to
Bandicoot in his day. "He just looks like he always does, only his
eyes are closed."</p>

<p>Welcoming diversion, Barry turned fiercely upon the boy. "You
get away out of here or I'll skelp the pants off you."</p>

<p>"Gently, gently! Don't hurt him&mdash;oh, don't hurt him!"
exclaimed Dora, as they were lowering the injured man on to the
bed.</p>

<p>"Is that what people look like when they're dead? It's just like
w'en they are alive," said Arthur, the threat not having penetrated
his absorption.</p>

<p>"If you don't go at once and hoe those potatoes, mark my words,
I'll, I'll..."</p>

<p>"Yes. Get away, boy. Go after his horse and don't let it get to
Chesham to frighten Mrs. Lindsey. That's something for you to
do."</p>

<p>"Yes, go at once," supplemented Father.</p>

<p>"Orl right. But if he's really dead, can I see him?" Mother and
Mabel undid Ross's collar. Mick pulled off his boots. The work of
first aid went ahead.</p>

<p>"He can't be dead. He doesn't feel dead, Mother," cried Dora,
unnerved by this near approach of death to one but lately as
vigorous as herself. "Don't let him die! I couldn't bear to see him
dead like an old person."</p>

<p>"He's not dead!" reported Mother. "I expect it's concussion like
young Turpey when he was pitched on his head and never spoke for
three weeks. We must have the doctor at once."</p>

<p>"Let me go for him. I ride lighter than anyone here."</p>

<p>"There's no need for that. We can telephone from Turpeys'. At a
time like this a telephone would be very useful in the house."</p>

<p>"I better git a horse saddled," said Mick.</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. and Mrs. Lindsey must know at once. Father, will you
see about that?"</p>

<p>The Hereford emitted one last bellow of protest to vindicate his
prestige. "I'll do nothing," he said and followed it by a dramatic
pause. "But go you, Mick Bell, take old Challenger. Don't girth him
too tight, and ease him up the pinches. He's fat and rising ten but
there's not another to match him within a hundred miles. I bred him
meself, that's why! As for that Lindsey dunky tumbling on its nose
and killing a man..."</p>

<p>Concertina enjoyably awaited the completion of the sentence. He
knew the old man. He needed someone to see his dexterous and
expressive wink. It was wasted on the masses of grape-like blossoms
of the wistaria filling the sunset hour with ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, I think his eyelids moved. He's not dead!" cried
Dora. "Oh, Daddy!" she turned to her father, nervously excited and
burst into sobs in his beard.</p>

<p>"He's not dead," said Mabel, halting in her work with sponge and
basin. She too was nervously disturbed but rigidly suppressed. She
left the room, turning at the door to remark: "He's not dead! It's
to be hoped the day won't come when you'll wish he had been."</p>

<p>"There! There! There!" comforted Father, the last vestige of
Hereford prestige relinquished by an affectionate and
over-indulgent parent, a man moved by feminine tears. "There!
There! He's all right with your mother."</p>

<p>"He can't help being a Lindsey, Daddy," said Dora, youthfully
sentimental. "He hasn't a good father like you." Mick winked again
communicatively. It was again lost on the wistaria, as his smile
was drowned in his bushy beard.</p>

<p>"Go you Mick Bell to Turpeys' and get them to telephone for the
doctor immediately. And telephone Lindsey's to come here. They'll
be welcome. Tell them Ross can't be moved till the doctor sees him.
Say it just as I tell you."</p>

<p>Mick hurried away with his commission. No old Mother Turpey's
for him, when it was only three miles farther to Chesham Park,
where the Lindseys could do their own telephoning, and Mick, hungry
for events, could witness a much fuller and more stylish
comedy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy! I knew you'd think differently," exclaimed Dora
triumphantly, as Mick disappeared.</p>

<p>"I don't think a jot different," maintained the old man.
"Nothing is altered. A scoundrel is a scoundrel, and I never saw a
worse one than that young man's father; but a neighbour is a
neighbour, and no matter what the other fellow does, never yet have
I, William Barry of Bandicoot, been a bad neighbour, so help me

<p class="poem">I must up and take the way<br>
Over the hill.<br>
My heart has grown afraid<br>
Sitting dumbly in the shade&mdash;<br>
The shade itself has made&mdash;<br>
And there's rust upon the blade.<br>
I must! I will!<br>
I shall up and make my way<br>
Over the hill.<br>
Where the brave heart surely may<br>
Find courage still.<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
Mabel thus might pause to ruminate.<br>
But prosaic, inarticulate.<br>
Lacked words. No poet she.<br>
She sighed. Her lot would ne'er abate.<br>
She dar'd not dream one day of being free:<br>
Seeking no ease, nor mental salves,<br>
She turned about to pen the calves,<br>
And feed the fowls, and set the tea.</p>

<p>Ross lay unconscious hour after hour. Mabel or Mother sat beside
him in turn, though there was nothing they could do. Dad ordered
Dora to bed, but she would not go. Mother advised Father to go
himself, but was that likely either?</p>

<p>Arthur was the only one who could be commanded, and his protests
were vigorous; but having filled his stomach to outside capacity
while free from surveillance, sleep eventually overcame him.</p>

<p>Dora was startled and felt a little guilty by what seemed an
excessive fulfilment of her wish for something&mdash;anything to
happen, but it was so far the most eventful night of her life.</p>

<p>They awaited both the doctor and the Lindseys. Mick found
Lindsey absent in Queanbeyan, ad Kate in attendance upon her
mother, who was undergoing one of her bad spells. Every now and
again Mrs. Lindsey's life was despaired of. She was a confirmed
invalid, frail as a leaf. Kate could not leave her for long at the
best of times. Nurses were unsatisfactory for the case.</p>

<p>Lindsey had left Queanbeyan well before the telephone message
went through. The doctor set out with his buggy and pair. Lindsey
had a breakdown and after tinkering for an hour and walking another
was given a lift by old Slattery to Whipstick Crossing. He stayed
to dinner and a game of cards, ambling home in the small hours. He
set out for Bandicoot at once. The doctor had just been and was to
come again on the afternoon of the day already four hours old.
Lindsey explained that his daughter could not leave his wife, and
that his own tardy appearance was owing to his car having broken
down.</p>

<p>Ross was stunned. The doctor had found no broken bones. He would
know more when he came again. For the present the patient must not
be moved.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" laughed Barry. "Lindsey sitting in his horseless wonder
in the mud near Slattery's like a hen on eggs in the dark, as I
prophesied, and his flash circus rider near dead off his weedy
Junky and lying helpless at my place!"</p>

<p>He was in great humour, triumphant, resourcefully full of
hospitality, king of his own backyard and of Lindsey's too for the
time. Lindsey could only await the doctor's progressive report. He
rode to Turpeys', the nearest telephone, and guardedly explained
the situation to Kate. Mrs. Lindsey had not yet been informed of
the accident. She thought her husband's absence was connected with
the motor car, and Ross was often away for a night or two on
business or pleasure. The doctor was to go on to Chesham Park after
his second visit to Bandicoot.</p>

<p>He said little following this. He could tell better after two or
three days. He did not fear any complications. In a world of
reckless horsemen he was familiar with such cases. Complete quiet
was imperative and lie forbade removal for a week or ten days.</p>

<p>Lindsey had to accept the situation. He did not feel it so
humiliating as Barry would have done had the position been
reversed. He wanted to engage a professional nurse, but Barry
maintained that his wife and daughter were worth a dozen of these
flipperty-jibbets from town. Lindsey suggested payment at rates
current in private hospitals. Barry's enjoyment mounted.</p>

<p>"I've never yet charged a neighbour for a meal or bed under my
roof, nor did my father before me, and I'm not going to start now,"
said the old man grandly. "You can pay for the doctor and medicine
and that sort of thing, but the bit of food and the bed, and the
women looking after him, why man alive, they'd do the same for a
black or Chinaman, if he had the same happen to him near by."</p>

<p>Lindsey submitted sensibly. His present anxiety was Ross's
condition and the effect the news might have on his wife. He rode
home to tell her and received word that the motor car had been
hauled to Queanbeyan by a horse team, was suffering a sheered axle
and that it was necessary to have parts from Sydney for
repairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lindsey was unusually ill. She was told that Ross had
broken his leg to account for his detention at Bandicoot. They
telegraphed for daughter Georgina (Mrs. Judson) but she was
prevented from coming by sickness in her own home.</p>

<p>Barry made light of the care that Ross required, provided the
doctor paid regular visits-to advise his home nurses. The weight of
the work fell on Mabel, and the glory on Mother and Dad, so all was
satisfactory.</p>

<p>It was an event and situation of piquant interest for the
district. Everyone babbled about it. Old Slattery and McTavish dug
each other in the ribs and chuckled gaily. "This, bedad, will woipe
out the owld row, and we'll have owld Bandicoot wid us for the
election. It seems as if the young feller done it
providential."</p>

<p>"Ye're richt, Muster Slattery. We'll bide a wee while and see
what happens."</p>

<p>There was a weak area in Father's satisfaction, the danger to
Dora's affections of this devil's offspring being thus placed in a
situation to touch her imagination. Mabel was equally alarmed, but
said nothing. Dora was forbidden the hospital room, so was Arthur.
Mabel did the lion's share, relieved by Mother, with Father as
self-constituted final authority, and consultant-in-chief.</p>

<p>Days, which had seemed flatly empty to Dora, became radiantly
alive. It was she who rode to Turpeys' each morning to report by
telephone Ross's progress and to inquire of Mrs. Lindsey's
condition, and she became interested in new household
responsibilities to free Mabel as nurse.</p>

<p>On the fifth day Ross was able to speak to them, but he
complained of his head so the doctor ordered continuance of the
quiet. Father could not be an unremitting dragon and Dora after
that soon gladdened Ross with her smiles and bubbling vitality. He
responded to her advances gaily with no complaints about his head.
Father and Mabel, quickly noting this, increased their vigilance,
and at the end of ten days the doctor said the patient could be
removed to his home.</p>

<p>Lindsey rode over upon each visit of the doctor, and as the car
was recommissioned determined to bring it at the earliest possible
moment. Mrs. Barry said there was no need for haste and insisted
that Ross should he up for a part of the day several times before
his removal.</p>

<p>The country was wrapped in a glowing October and it was
particularly warm for the time of year. Ross on his last two days
at Bandicoot lay on a cane lounge just outside the "best" room on
the front veranda, while Dora, under pretext of practising and
getting the worth of her tuition, played or sang softly specially
for him. He pronounced the new song "Whisper and I shall hear," the
prettiest he had heard in many a day, and joined in the refrain. He
assured Mrs. Barry that music did not hurt his head.</p>

<p>Father had the mischance to be called away on urgent veterinary
business. A good draught mare had ripped herself on a barbed wire
fence. He saw Rosa alone on the veranda, apparently sound asleep,
and let matters take a chance. The plight of the valuable mare
engrossed him, and Ross would be gone on the morrow and all would
be safe.</p>

<p>As soon as his voice faded in the distance, Rosa called Dora
softly. Mabel and Mother were in the back premises deep in
laundering the Lindsey linen in readiness for the morrow. Kate had
sent over ample supplies.</p>

<p>"How do you feel? Do you want something?" inquired Dora archly,
coming out on the veranda.</p>

<p>"Only to talk to you."</p>

<p>"I wish they wouldn't take you away so soon. It might shake you
up, and it'll be as dead as a door nail when you go."</p>

<p>"With motor cars it will be like living next door."</p>

<p>"Yes, if they didn't keep up this silly old fight. But don't you
think this has ended it all now? They seem quite friendly!"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't reckon too much on it. They're pretty old in the
horn, and the Pater's determined&mdash;neat but not noisy."</p>

<p>"And Father's a hummer!" She laughed gaily. "The thing is to
stand up to him."</p>

<p>"Better to wait till things blow past."</p>

<p>"I haven't the patience."</p>

<p>"At any rate I'm not going to lose my little rose of
Bandicoot."</p>

<p>"Who calls me that?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"But you're a poor old silican with a broken pate."</p>

<p>"Mr. Blackett says you are a rose blushing unseen behind
Bandicoot Hill."</p>

<p>"Well, Father thinks a girl can't be let off the chain without
coming to harm."</p>

<p>"He knows some that would be better tied up; and you see, I made
good use of the first opportunity that came my way."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it funny! I couldn't believe it was the terrible Ross
Lindsey. 'Oh, excuse me! Miss Barry, I presume'," she mimicked him
mischievously. "As if you didn't know me! You couldn't very well
mistake me for Jean McTavish."</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! I hung about till I took root waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Hypocrite! You pretended to be so surprised!"</p>

<p>"Your Pater knows a little after all," chuckled Ross. "At any
rate I broke into acquaintance with you, though I had to break my
head to get any farther."</p>

<p>"Dad says that was because your ill-bred donkey fell down. He
thinks old Challenger is the only real horse alive."</p>

<p>"The horse isn't foaled that's proof against putting his foot in
a rabbit hole. I'm pacing him for a lady."</p>

<p>"What lady?" Coquetry was in the inquiry.</p>

<p>"One who could run rings around everyone if she rode at the
Shows."</p>

<p>"I've often wished to ride at the Shows," said. Dora affecting
to misunderstand him, "but Father won't let me be 'conspicuous,' he
calls it."</p>

<p>"We must see that all that sort of tosh is finished, after this,
one way or another. You do want to see me again as much as I want
to see you, don't you?</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"You're too fond of that word perhaps."</p>

<p>"It's such a dear useful little word."</p>

<p>"Too uncertain for my taste."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Father will keep up his old rules."</p>

<p>"In that case, we must be military strategists...You know that
old hollow tree up the pinch by Dingo Creek, on the short cut
home?"</p>

<p>"Rather! I often go there for ferns. Lots of these came from
there," said Dora, indicating her mother's display.</p>

<p>"Well, if we don't get a chance to see each other in Queanbeyan
or elsewhere, perhaps there might be some thing in that hollow, in
a tin&mdash;one with a lid would best."</p>

<p>"If your horse or mine left a track within a mile of each other
perhaps old Concertina Mick would spot it and insinuate to
Father."</p>

<p>"I'll tie my horse at the turn-off."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't help. He said you were sneaking around here to
see me the day your horse fell."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was. What Concertina doesn't know won't be any use to
the trackers. He's one of the old bush telegraphs who could be
useful."</p>

<p>"I don't know what for, unless to keep a pipe warm. I hate his
sneaking, sneering old ways, and no perhaps about that."</p>

<p>"Don't let him know it and get his knife into you. Can you
dance?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if only I could get the chance, I'm sure I could, and I'd
just love it!"</p>

<p>"You've got the cut of a ripping little dancer. You had better
kiss me good-bye now in case we don't get another chance."</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho! Who said I was going to kiss you good-bye! You get Rose
Ann Slattery to kiss you welcome home."</p>

<p>"Now Dora," said her mother, coming around the corner, "is that
you chattering like a pet magpie, when you know Ross has to keep
very quiet."</p>

<p>"I hardly heard her," said Ross with affected drowsiness. "I was
just dropping off to sleep."</p>

<p>"That's good...Then Dora, you can come and spread out the
clothes and relieve me, and leave him in peace."</p>

<p>Dora had no chance of private chat with Ross again. Father Barry
bore him company during the afternoon, and Mother banished him
early to the quiet of his bedroom to rest for the morrow's
journey.</p>

<p>In the kitchen preparations raged for the Lindsey arrival.
Mother had hesitated to ask Lindsey at what hour he could be
expected. In view of the paradoxical state of association she was
not equal either to pressing or limiting hospitality. Lindsey had
caused a flutter by murmuring that Kate might come with him to take
care of Ross on the homeward way.</p>

<p>Kate had not been to Bandicoot since she was younger than Dora,
and since then had gone to the top of the social ladder. Mrs. Barry
was determined to show-off her housekeeping and cooking, and Mabel
therefore spared no effort. Mabel was most uncomfortable. She
longed to disappear for the day, but that was unthinkable. She
would be escaping the work, a thing she had not attempted since she
had gone astray.</p>

<p>In case they should arrive before dinner, a heavy banquet was in
course of preparation, and virtually another for afternoon tea.
Kate Lindsey was equally in a quandary, wondering what she had best
do and how the Barrys might construe her actions.</p>

<p>"Do the kindest thing possible, my dear," weakly murmured her
mother, "and then you'll have done your duty: and don't forget to
give my love as well as thanks to Mrs. Barry and that poor girl,
Mabel. How I wish I could do something for her."</p>

<p>They decided to obviate possible embarrassment about meals, as
well as to avoid making extra work where they had already made so
much, by setting nut immediately after lunch and returning well
before afternoon tea.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="poem">"To combat these roarings and shoutings,<br>
Because of unauthorised outings<br>
I'm highly unable," mus'd long-suff'ring Mabel.<br>
"Without any floutings or two-penny doubtings,<br>
I'd rather go live in a stable."</p>

<p>Mid-day and one o'clock passed without guests to eat the
banquet. It was disappointing. When she had cleared away and washed
the dishes and pots, Mabel took refuge and relief from her
nervousness in ironing. She kept in the deep old kitchen to-day,
hoping to see without being seen from behind the screens of roses
and jasmine. The Chesham Park linen, to go home with Ross, was
laundered as for an exhibition and hanging on a line to air, while
Mabel turned to her mother's and Dora's petticoats, like crinolines
with their ruched or crochetted flouncings, or netting stiffened in
raw starch. Each garment took an hour to iron as Mabel turned it
out.</p>

<p>Bandicoot himself, for all his assumed contempt of towniness and
society airs and graces, was nervous at the prospect of one of the
Lindsey women. He roared in and out of the house, unable to settle
to anything, and demonstrating his importance in various chores.
Challenger got a new pair of shoes before it was necessary because
the smithy was near the house. Dora, who had inherited something of
her father's temperament as well as his colouring, was simply
seething. Ross found her much too inattentive through restlessness
to proceed with his courtship, whether real or fictitious, his
fever was insufficiently advanced for him to determine. Dora's
wayward indifference piqued him to rather more than he had intended
to say.</p>

<p>"Perhaps something has happened so they aren't coming to-day,"
Dora remarked to him after lunch.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm quite content, if you are?" Ross gave the words extra
meaning by a laughing lift in his lively black eyes.</p>

<p>Mother gave her pots an extra tickle. Dora walked in and out,
sang a bar, said a word or two to Ross or examined her dress
material, and frequently encountered her father who was acting
similarly, with the anvil instead of the piano as his chief
instrument.</p>

<p>Mabel thumped resoundingly with the heavy iron and glanced under
a corner of the window veil to command a view of the approaching
road. The motor car was to be an added excitement for her.</p>

<p>Ross asked Dora to sing him "Whisper and I shall hear" once
more, and said he would procure a copy and be able to play the
accompaniment for her next time they met. In spite of his head he
essayed a couplet or two of "Anchored" and "The Vagabond" to Dora's
accompaniment.</p>

<p>During one of these breaks Arthur walloped in like a half-grown
puppy and announced that the motor car was coming. It did not come
right to the house, to the triumph of Dad and the disappointment of
Mabel. It gave out at the foot of the incline that led to the back
gates, and Lindsey and Kate had to walk the last quarter of a mile.
Dora ran and Mother walked to meet them. Even Father advanced,
natural hospitality overcoming unnatural hostility. Mabel peeped
and peeped from various windows, and made sure that the fountain
was full of boiling water. It was her pride that she could produce
water, boiling or near the boil, day and night, for any emergency.
Then she fell upon her ironing with renewed ferocity.</p>

<p>Kate Lindsey was two years Mabel's junior but looked fully ten
as she advanced towards the house. She had discarded her dust-coat,
veil and goggles and was stylishly dressed in the trailing flounces
of the prevailing mode, which she held about her ankles with
exceeding skill. She was tall, healthy and good-looking. She gave
the idea of capacity and good nature. She was perhaps a trifle
showy and town for Bandicoot in her delicate high-heeled shoes.
Full-bosomed and long and slender-waisted, she moved like a dancer.
She was much admired for her fine carriage and figure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry was saying she had expected them to dinner. Kate said
that Ross had made enough trouble already, and that now with the
motor car they could go quite long distances between meals. As they
neared the gates, Lindsey said he would not go inside, as he would
have to see what was the matter with the car. "I'll have to borrow
a spanner or screw wrench from you, Barry."</p>

<p>Barry led the way to his tool house with a feeling of
superiority that gave him pride and good humour. Lindsey bettered
matters by asking him to look at the engine.</p>

<p>"There's hardly a thresher or a shearing turn-out within twenty
miles that I haven't been called in to doctor, but I've never
tackled one of these contraptions."</p>

<p>"Good practice by the time you get one yourself."</p>

<p>"I'd rather have a good old horse that I could depend on."</p>

<p>Father and Lindsey went away to the car. Ross stood on the
veranda and waved his hand to show that he was quite well. Kate and
he kissed affectionately, and the four went into the best room with
all the framed merinos and the piano. It was difficult for them to
talk. In good bush fashion Mrs. Barry invited Kate to take off her
hat, but Kate said they could only stay a few moments as she was
anxious to return to her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry inquired minutely about Mrs. Lindsey. Conversation
dried up again. Kate admired the roses, especially a bowl of
perfumed blush ones not commonly seen. Mrs. Barry said she would
send some to Mrs. Lindsey who of old had always admired that rose
bush.</p>

<p>"Won't you show me the garden?" said Kate. This took her and
Mother outside. Dora remained with Ross. While Mrs. Barry clipped
and Kate enthusiastically admired, she also said she would like to
see Mabel again.</p>

<p>"She was in the kitchen ironing a little while ago. I'll tell
her," said Mrs. Barry.</p>

<p>"I'll go and see her, if I may, while you are cutting the
flowers. I haven't forgotten the way."</p>

<p>This dismissed Mrs. Barry and Kate found herself treading a path
that was laden with memories. At Bandicoot all remained as of yore.
No new house as at Chesham had superseded the pioneer structure.
Kate had been a rollicking girl younger than Dora and riding with
Dora's skill, when she used to push her way between the roses and
jasmine, finding delight in the banter and pursuit of the
long-absent Bob, while Sid and Mabel had been wont to disappear.
She noted how well-kept the flower-beds were, how massed with
vigorous bloom&mdash;a contrast to Chesham Park, where the new and
more pretentious lay-out was often disreputably shaggy.</p>

<p>She stepped softly through the doorway of the old kitchen, while
Mabel faced the other way, ironing steadily. Kate's voice startled
her. She dropped the petticoat.</p>

<p>"It's only me, Mabel. Have I changed so that I frighten
you?"</p>

<p>Mabel was too nervous for speech. Kate, radiant, well-dressed,
mature but unwithered made her feel a miserable derelict. Kate
picked up the garment and came to the ironer's rescue. "How
perfectly you iron. All these things of Ross's done up as for the
Show. I use the mangle on those."</p>

<p>Mabel found her voice, but only fretfully: "I think a mangle a
lazy woman's dodge."</p>

<p>"I have so much to do that I have to adopt any dodge that will
keep it all going: and we entertain a good deal."</p>

<p>The last phrase made Mabel feel that Kate was putting on
"side."</p>

<p>"I thought you kept servants," she said ungraciously.</p>

<p>"We do. But they need a great deal of supervision, and then I
have Mother on my hands."</p>

<p>"How is your mother these days?"</p>

<p>"She has had a bad turn this time, but ordinarily she is about
the same. Lies on a sofa, or sometimes sits in an armchair. It's
her nerves, the doctor says."</p>

<p>Mabel made no comment. She took up a fresh iron. She did not
invite Kate to be seated. Kate continued her efforts: "Mabel, she
sent her love to you and asked me to thank you for all your
kindness to Ross, and to say that she is sorry he made you so much
extra work."</p>

<p>Mabel did not know what to say. She put the hot iron back at the
fire in her flurry and took up the previous one. Kate took a packet
from her handbag and laid it on the table. "Mother sent you
this."</p>

<p>"I don't want anything. I won't take anything!" protested Mabel,
brusque with nervousness and long seclusion.</p>

<p>"I know you don't want anything, but I couldn't tell poor old
Mother that: she is so frail. She said you were to be sure and wear
that with her love. May I tell her that you asked after her
health?"</p>

<p>Mabel's tension was relieved by Arthur bursting in at the back
door on an errand from Father. He came to a halt, rather
loose-mouthed and staring, a tall, ungainly lout, well-acquainted
with hard work. He had Bandicoot's colouring and large frame, but
the Lindsey cast of features was striking.</p>

<p>"This is the boy&mdash;Arthur?" said Kate to Mabel under her
breath. Arthur was transfixed with the adventure of seeing one of
the grand female members of the devilish Lindsey brood in the
kitchen talking to Mabel while she ironed. No one but Concertina
ever talked specially to Mabel.</p>

<p>"Take off your hat!" commanded Mabel.</p>

<p>This brought Arthur to himself. "Father wants an old boot to
make a washer."</p>

<p>"Look behind the duck house, and shut the gate after you."</p>

<p>"How are you, Arthur?" said Kate kindly, offering her hand. "I
have something for you."</p>

<p>"W'at is it?" demanded Arthur, bemused.</p>

<p>"Just a little remembrance from my mother."</p>

<p>"W'at for?"</p>

<p>"You've done so much for Ross."</p>

<p>"Who said I done anything?"</p>

<p>"Father is wanting you," said Mabel nervously.</p>

<p>"Oh, you've all been very good to Ross, and wouldn't you like
this handkerchief and spurs?"</p>

<p>"I asked Ross if I could have his broken pair."</p>

<p>Kate produced a splendid pair, a replica of Ross's, and a
brilliant silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>"There! A new pair of your own."</p>

<p>Arthur was overcome. "Oh, thank you KKK-Kate&mdash;I mean Miss
Lindsey. These are bosker."</p>

<p>Father's shout here intervened. "Are you coming to-day or next
week?"</p>

<p>Arthur hurriedly hid his treasures in Mabel's ironing basket and
whooped off, elated. Kate watched him closely.</p>

<p>"Someone told me he was the image of poor Sid, and I see it is
true."</p>

<p>"Good thing he is!" said Mabel, thumping prodigiously, the
petrified hurt of years finding expression. "You tried hard enough
to blacken me by fastening him on to everyone else."</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that, Mabel. But Sid was my brother, and I
felt so terribly disgraced, and was frantic to shift the blame, and
you know how girls are reared to believe that a man won't misbehave
if a woman keeps him in his place."</p>

<p>"The men have got it all fixed up to suit themselves, but some
of us know different."</p>

<p>"We do now, but I had no experience in those days, and I've
always wanted you to know how sorry I am."</p>

<p>"All the mud was slung at me."</p>

<p>"Not all, Mabel. Your father did his share&mdash;still does. He
won't let it die out, and he's quite a snorter, you must
admit."</p>

<p>"I expect he has good reasons," said Mabel pointedly.</p>

<p>Kate was stung to retort, but Ross had asked Dora to sing just
once again, and the girl's voice with its happy young lilt floated
across from the house:</p>

<p class="poem">"Just whisper my name to the woodlands,<br>
Sigh what your heart would say<br>
And I shall hear, your message, dear,<br>
Born on the breeze awa-a-y.<br>
Oh, winds that blow from the South<br>
Sighing so soft and low,<br>
Whisper your secret sweet,<br>
Whisper and I shall kno-o-w."</p>

<p>Kate smiled, tempted to join in the refrain. Mabel again changed
her iron unnecessarily. Kate turned the subject.</p>

<p>"Do you ever hear from your brother Bob?"</p>

<p>"Not likely! Do you?"</p>

<p>"A Christmas card now and again. It's a wonder he doesn't come
home to see his mother."</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do, Kate Lindsey, that Bill and Bob went
off swearing they'd never come back again where they were known as
my brothers, and cursing me for the disgrace."</p>

<p>"Very likely they feel differently now."</p>

<p>"If you want Bob, you'd better write and tell him so yourself,"
said Mabel, roughly.</p>

<p>"We've all had time to suffer and learn a lot since then,"
offered Kate, tolerantly.</p>

<p>"I'm the one that's borne all the suffering, and I can keep on
without asking for help."</p>

<p>"Not all the suffering, Mabel. Mother has never recovered from
the shock. If she could make it up to you with her life, she would.
Mother never allows any mud to be thrown."</p>

<p>"Your mother was always kind," murmured Mabel, suddenly touched.
She had to bite her lip to hide its trembling.</p>

<p>"Not only that; the Pater never let Sid come near the house from
that day, no matter how Mother pled for him."</p>

<p>"I didn't think your father cared only to chuck mud at me."</p>

<p>"He's a very ambitious man, and Sid spoiled everything." They
were both silent. Kate looked at the irons before the fire, at the
shining brass lid of the water fountain, from which steam issued.
She looked at the canisters and pot lids and dish covers,
everything was spotless and shining, giving evidence of unrelaxing
housewifery, which it was impossible to buy for Chesham Park. She
thought how comfortable and homey the old place looked and so
prosperous, so paid-up. Then she turned back to Mabel and asked
softly: "Did you hear that Sid is dead?"</p>

<p>"Dead! I never knew." Mabel went white under her weather-beaten
tan.</p>

<p>"The Pater wouldn't have his name mentioned, even for that."</p>

<p>"When was it?"</p>

<p>"Some months ago&mdash;in New Zealand."</p>

<p>Mabel turned abruptly from the ironing table and disappeared
into an adjoining store-room, shutting the door after her. The
young voices floated over from the house in a melodious duet. The
warm afternoon air was heavy with wistaria perfume and fluttering
butterflies. The roses leant against the window panes and framed
the doorway. Kate stood a minute or two and then tapped on the
store-room door. There was no sound, so she returned to the
drawing-room. Mother, under orders from Father, was so closely
chaperoning Dora that the young pair had taken refuge in music.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry urged tea. Kate said that would be ridiculous, as
they had only just had luncheon. She suggested going to see how the
car was progressing. They were out the back gate together before
Mrs. Barry noticed that Dora had remained with Ross.</p>

<p>Mabel heard them going, and feeling the need of outlet for her
strictured emotions, fell upon the ironing with renewed fury. At
this moment Concertina Mick entered through the orchard, pipe in
face as usual. An acute or suspicious observer might have thought
him rather togged-up. In addition to the envied snakeskin belt to
supplement prosaic braces, about a fourth of an inch had been
rounded off his beard, and he was without bowyangs. It was mail day
and with telepathic instinct for news he knew it was about the time
for Ross's removal, and was irresistibly drawn to the theatre of
events.</p>

<p>"Good-day! Hard at it as usual," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Someone has to do the work. We can't all be jumped-up swells
and live on mortgages or botching other people's brands."</p>

<p>"No more we can, nor ride about in motor cars neither," agreed
Mick.</p>

<p>"I've got a terrible lot to do, and the fountain's boiling dry,"
said Mabel as that neglected property emitted a long clattering
sound like the cackle of geese.</p>

<p>"I'll give her a drink. But ain't you sockin' it into them a
little more than usual?" he inquired as he took the dipper and went
for water. Before seating himself, he took a parcel from his
pocket. He had some difficulty in extracting it. When unwrapped it
proved to be a pound or two of boiled lollies very much stuck
together and to the paper. He put it down beside Mabel.</p>

<p>"I told you I don't take presents."</p>

<p>"But you did the larst time."</p>

<p>"You told me you won that in a raffle and had to get rid of
it."</p>

<p>"Well, this time I got it specially for you, ain't that goin'
one better?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't do that," she said tensely.</p>

<p>"It's a free country. Surely to God a bloke can do w'at he likes
sometimes."</p>

<p>Mabel shook her head and bent lower over her work. She was
trembling so that she could scarcely stand and escaped again to the
store-room. Gasping, she clutched the doorpost striving to keep
command of her faculties and limbs. A question from Mick recalled
her to her work.</p>

<p>"W'at's Lord Wallaby's horseless carriage doin' down
there&mdash;too swell to git any nearer?"</p>

<p>"It's gone bung and Father and old Sandy are trying to tinker it
up."</p>

<p>"Gripes! That would please the old man. How's he takin' it?"</p>

<p>"Which old man?"</p>

<p>"Both of 'em, only I know the Dook of Chesham Park is too slimy
to give hisself away. Anyone with him?"</p>

<p>"Kate."</p>

<p>"A Wonder she never come afore, and not leave everythink to
you."</p>

<p>"I'm not the sort has to have people running after me to pick up
my handkerchief," snapped Mabel, thumping even harder, if that were
possible.</p>

<p>Mick agreed equably. "Gripes, you're right there! Here Mabel,
you take these lollies."</p>

<p>Mabel flinched from the proffered gift, then suddenly snatched
it. "Perhaps I might as well. It can't matter now."</p>

<p>"Gripes! Has Kate or any of that mob been slinging-off at
you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing's been said that matters to anyone in the world only
me, but it will be different now."</p>

<p>"About time in sonic ways. I'll go an' see if I can lend a hand
with the royal coach." As soon as he was safely gone Mabel thrust
the sweets into her ironing basket.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ross had been making the most of opportunity.</p>

<p>"What about that good-bye kiss?" he bantered, laughing,
audacious, detaining Dora by her wrist as she passed the sofa where
he reclined.</p>

<p>"You're so silly about kissing! Someone will see us."</p>

<p>"Would you care if they did?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps! But there, that's to mend your silly old pate. If it
goes bad again, send for me and I'll do it up in vinegar and brown
paper." She lightly touched his forehead with her lips.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully. My head is terrible now. Keep on."</p>

<p>"Oh, people don't kiss unless they're engaged or something
deadly," laughed Dora, her light words disguising her fluttering
pulses.</p>

<p>"Oh, look here," said Ross vigorously. "You must come to our
ball this year."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I only could!" Dora's eyes enlarged with longing.</p>

<p>"If you do, you'll give me a real kiss then."</p>

<p>"What ever for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, girls always kiss their principal partner at their first
ball."</p>

<p>"I'm sure!" retorted Dora in the catch phrase of another
day.</p>

<p>"Yes they do. You ask&mdash;now let me see whom you could
ask."</p>

<p>"Rose Ann Slattery," mischievously suggested Dora.</p>

<p>"Or Tom Harris," riposted Ross. "He must have had whips of
experience."</p>

<p>They laughed merrily, and Dora, while entertained as she had
never been before, was also inconsistently-driven to escape. "I
must go and help Mabel with the tea," she said.</p>

<p>"You had better say good-bye to me now, and remember the old
hollow tree, just in case hostilities are resumed."</p>

<p>"Concertina would upset that duck house for us."</p>

<p>"The thing with Concertina is to find out his pet duck house and
let him know that upsetting a duck house is a game that we all
could play at."</p>

<p>Mabel sent Dora to find out if they were nearly finished working
on the car, ad she reached it just as Kate said good-afternoon to
Mick.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon Miss!" he responded, respectfully touching his
hat.</p>

<p>"How's the concertina?"</p>

<p>"Same as ever, Miss."</p>

<p>"I'd like to hear it again. Where are you wheeling your barrow
these days?"</p>

<p>"On me selection out beyond the Little Ten Mile."</p>

<p>Father here rolled from under the car. Lindsey cranked-up and
found the engine all right. Father was very pleased with himself.
"I would soon get the hang of it, but I'd rather have an old
draught horse in a tip dray and travel in the seat like a human
being, than a thing that goes shoost-bust! for a mile or two, and
then a man has-to get out and travel the rest of the way on his
belly underneath like a goanna."</p>

<p>"Oh, but this is only the beginning," contended Lindsey. "Motor
cars have come to stay. It means a revolution in the way of life
and the value of property. It will bring the outlying places near
to the market. You and I who have been in the Back Blocks will be
practically in the suburbs of Queanbeyan as soon as the horseless
vehicle is properly on the market."</p>

<p>"And if it doesn't break down in Slattery's bog when you are
going for the doctor," guffawed Father, pleased with his own
wit.</p>

<p>Lindsey forced a propitiatory laugh&mdash;good practice for a
prospective parliamentary candidate. Barry added: "What will the
horse breeders do?"</p>

<p>"They'll have to move with the times and do something else."</p>

<p>"Come and have some tea?"</p>

<p>"I have to meet a man at home at four o'clock, thanks," said
Lindsey.</p>

<p>"I expect the women have some ready. Come and have a wash."</p>

<p>They approached the door of the kitchen where Mabel had laid out
a towel and soap beside hand basins improvised from kerosene tins.
Barry was in a picture of a mess. His white moleskins were enough
to dismay the most hardened washer-woman, covered as they were with
grease and dust. Lindsey was strikingly in contrast throughout. He
was spare of form and smartly dressed. His black hair and
close-cropped beard showed the merest sprinkling of white. He was
only a few years younger than Barry but looked no more than fifty.
His manner was polite and alert, his movements quick and deft. He
was not at all disarrayed; only his hands were soiled.</p>

<p>"We'll need some hot water to get rid of this," observed Barry
and called to Mabel to bring some. It did not occur to him that he
was submitting her to an ordeal. It did not occur to her to
disobey. She had not encountered Lindsey since the old days. She
passed swiftly out, set down a dipper of boiling water and withdrew
without a glance to right or left. Palpitant, she listened inside
the kitchen and heard both Kate and her father firmly refuse even a
cup of tea.</p>

<p>"We've made you trouble enough as it is." said Lindsey.</p>

<p>"And I cannot leave Mother longer than absolutely necessary. She
will be impatient to see Ross."</p>

<p>Mabel sent Arthur to the motor car with the linen. Dora and her
parents between them conducted Ross and his belongings. He was
comfortably placed with a pillow or two. Dora was eagerly
interested in the car.</p>

<p>"You look like a mummy!" she said gaily as Kate enveloped
herself in goggles and the voluminous veils and dustcoats that were
deemed indispensable by pioneer motorists.</p>

<p>"One feels the dust and glare so in a motor," said Kate.</p>

<p>Lindsey had put on his smart silk duster and swung his goggles
on his finger as he awaited Kate.</p>

<p>"It must be wonderful," pursued Dora. "I'd love a ride in
one."</p>

<p>"Come a little way with us now," invited Kate.</p>

<p>Father interposed firmly. "The old buggy and horses have served
me pretty well, and I reckon they'll do me to the end; and a horse
vehicle will have to do Dora as long as she's a daughter of mine,
thank you, Miss Lindsey."</p>

<p>Kate and her father estimated that the old man was still
harbouring his enmity. Ross thought with satisfaction of the hollow
tree trunk by Dingo Creek, and purposely to deceive Barry, hardly
noticed Dora in his adieux.</p>

<p>Kate warmly expressed her thanks. She told Mrs. Barry that her
mother often wished for a talk with her.'</p>

<p>"Good-day, Barry. Many thanks," said Lindsey. "If an opportunity
arises I'll be glad to repay some of what you have done for
Ross."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it! It's only what me and my wife would do for
any tramp." The old men merely nodded without attempting to shake
hands.</p>

<p>With a few; snorts and lurches the car was off and the Barrys
turned back to the house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="poem">He took off his bowyangs and put on a belt<br>
From a serpent,<br>
Then off he went<br>
In a trusty wide-spreading old hat of felt.<br>
With voice so soft and low,<br>
On Gov'nor smug and slow,<br>
He went a-courting:<br>
No loud and sporting<br>
Racketty gent;<br>
Tho' out his beard he often sneered<br>
With firm intent,<br>
Or tuned an old-time song<br>
To push his cause along.</p>

<p>Mabel had tea laid and they fell upon it, seasoning it with
voluble chatter of the great event now ended. Concertina Mick fired
the first squib. "She's as flash as a fashion plate now, but I've
seed her running about barefooted."</p>

<p>Dora resented this. She had noted Mick's servile manner at the
motor car and was indignant that he should have the right to call
her Dora and to sit at the table with her and speak disparagingly
of Kate. "You hate to see people going up in the world. If you
always knowed them when they were down, it's a give-away that you
were down too. Mother, don't you think Kate Lindsey is awfully
nice?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She was always a nice friendly little girl."</p>

<p>"She wasn't friendly enough to have tea with you. Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"You are trying to manufacture a grievance, Father." Mother
spoke puncturingly. She was thinking what a pleasure it would be to
resume visits to the Lindseys to hear all the doings of the
district's upper ten. "If Kate Lindsey ever went barefooted it was
only for fun. All children love to take off their boots," she added
to Mick, thereby supporting Dora.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lindsey was the granddaughter of old Harnett the shepherd,
and when he used to come to my father he ate in the kitchen. So
that is the origin of your flash Lindseys, with their horseless
wonder, that won't go till I make it,
and&mdash;and&mdash;goggles."</p>

<p>"There were lots of aristocrats among the shepherds in the old
days," said Mrs. Barry. "Dr. Morton was a shepherd at first."</p>

<p>"And it isn't Mrs. Lindsey you say things against&mdash;it's Mr.
Lindsey," persisted Dora, looking at Mick, and wishing he could be
banished to the kitchen for meals.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Father.</p>

<p>"It's better to rise from a shepherd in any case than slip back
from a swell," continued Dora.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed her mother. "I never think it anything hut
creditable to improve one's circumstances."</p>

<p>"If it's done honestly."</p>

<p>Arthur, having taken the sharp edge off his appetite with about
half a loaf of bread and "cockies' joy" now went to seek his
treasures in the ironing basket. He found there also the parcel of
boiled lollies which Mabel had forgotten. He rushed forth and
plumped down his booty. "Look w'at Kate Lindsey gave me, and this
must be w'at she gave Mabel."</p>

<p>"Give that to me," said Mabel, rescuing her gift.</p>

<p>"You don't mean, Mabel, that a Lindsey had the hide to offer you
anything, and that you'd be crawler enough to take it," said
Father, witheringly.</p>

<p>"Kate Lindsey did not give me these."</p>

<p>"Was it Mr. Lindsey then?" inquired Dora.</p>

<p>"Look at me things, that she gave me, Dad," exclaimed
Arthur.</p>

<p>"Don't ever let me hear any of this loud dad business to
me.."</p>

<p>"That's w'at Ross called old Lindsey."</p>

<p>"It's good enough for him, but don't let me catch you dadding
me."</p>

<p>"Well Father, ain't that a bosker handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"Fling them on the manure heap behind the cow-yard. That's the
place for such presents. Take them away."</p>

<p>"Who gave you the lollies, Mabel?" again inquired Dora.</p>

<p>"It would be a pity if anyone gave me anything, wouldn't
it?"</p>

<p>"I think you are mean to make such a mystery of it. I always
tell you if I get anything."</p>

<p>Mabel had seized Arthur's booty. He was not going to relinquish
it tamely. "Dad!" burst from him.</p>

<p>"I'll flay the skin off you if you call me Dad again!"</p>

<p>"I forgot."</p>

<p>"It's not your business to forget, blast you."</p>

<p>"Well, Father, what right has Mabel to boss me and collar me
things w'at was gave to me?"</p>

<p>"You do what Mabel tells you and mind your own business. Go and
hill those potatoes at the far end of the paddock. Go at
once&mdash;look lively."</p>

<p>"It ain't fair," blubbered Arthur. "I didn't ought to be treated
this way."</p>

<p>"I'll teach you what's fair, and how you ought to be
treated&mdash;mark my words!"</p>

<p>"I don't think it's fair either," said Dora gallantly. "Kate
gave me a beautiful silver photo frame."</p>

<p>"You'll give me that frame."</p>

<p>"What for? It's mine."</p>

<p>"Do you defy me?"</p>

<p>"I've just been dying for a frame for Bob's photo."</p>

<p>"I'll get you one if you want it. You don't have to take things
from that crew."</p>

<p>"Then why were you so sweet to their faces?"</p>

<p>"I had to offer hospitality. I wouldn't be inhospitable to the
devil if he was injured: but who are you to question me&mdash;this
insolence and defiance."</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, Dora, can't you live without coming to
issues with your father about nothing?"&mdash;Mother's locutions
were well-worn&mdash;"It upsets me so I can't sleep. You're as
childish as she is,"&mdash;she turned to her husband. "She couldn't
be rude to Kate about the frame. I was there when Kate gave it. It
was a kindly thought. She wanted to make some return, and you
wouldn't let them pay. Can't you let it go at that and say no more
about it?"</p>

<p>"If that was all!"</p>

<p>Mick saw a thunderstorm at hand. No one would have enjoyed the
claps more than he, but instinct warned him that both Mrs. Barry
and Dora were hostile to him on this occasion, so he took himself
to the backyard and cut some wood. When he had disappeared, Father
turned towards Dora in earnest.</p>

<p>"Now, do you hear this, let that be the last of the Lindseys for
all of you, mark my words."</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry was disappointed. She found seclusion dull and had
hoped the accidental obtrusion of the Lindseys might have ended it.
Dora attempted to ignore her father.</p>

<p>"I'll start on my lovely new dress at once. I'll make it like
Kate Lindsey's while the idea is in my head. I'll need a petticoat,
too. Did you notice Kate's&mdash;it was simply glorious."</p>

<p>"It was one of those that Davy Jones and Company is advertising
for ten-and-six&mdash;madapollam with Inde linen flounce," observed
Mabel. "I noticed the five tucks and a space, and then five more
tucks."</p>

<p>Dora sought the Town and Country Journal and there in the
advertisement pages, amid requests for emu eggs, and praise of bile
beans for biliousness, etc., etc., was pictured the very petticoat
that Kate had worn. Dora pored over it, but Father was not to be
hoodwinked.</p>

<p>"Sit down, I want to talk to you, and no evasion or back talk.
You heard what I said about the Lindseys. If I catch you making up
to Ross Lindsey, I'll&mdash;I'll, well, the long and the short of
it is, I won't have it&mdash;so there!"</p>

<p>Dora received this in silence, her mind on the torchon frill,
and a forming determination to have a hat pictured in an adjacent
illustration, like a distorted dinner plate, with a wreath of roses
and supports of ribbon blobs.</p>

<p>"Do you hear? I'll have no making up to Ross Lindsey or anyone
of his breed. And I won't have any of this sulking when I speak to
you. Do you hear?" boomed Father.</p>

<p>"You roar so that you deafen me, and if I answer, I get blown up
for back talk."</p>

<p>"You're very pert, aren't you? I've had to speak before about
it, but mark my words, I won't have you making up to Ross
Lindsey."</p>

<p>"I wasn't," said Dora indignantly.</p>

<p>"Then I won't have him making up to you. I'll put it that way.
Now do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he make up to me, as you call it, or to any other
girl who would be silly enough to listen to him? It's a free
country."</p>

<p>"Now listen to me." Father emitted the real Hereford roar. Still
it did not daunt Dora. She was accustomed to it. She always met it
blithely without subterfuge or diplomatic wriggling.</p>

<p>"It would be fun for you to listen to me for a change. You just
shout at me and never give any reason. You say old Lindsey took
your cattle in the old days, and always got his mutton from his
neighbours, and will pop his brand on any stray sheep if he can get
away with it, but what has Ross ever done? He's the only young man
about here with a spark of gentlemanliness."</p>

<p>"There are false standards of gentlemanliness, and the Lindseys
are one of them. It's all very fine to prance about with a man in a
scutty turn-out&mdash;that's courting. It's a horse of a different
weight when it comes to washing his old moleskin trousers&mdash;and
that's marriage."</p>

<p>"That's why I'm not particularly struck on marriage, and if I
had a husband and he wore those disgusting old moleskins and messed
them up, I wouldn't wash them&mdash;I'd burn them."</p>

<p>Mother went to tickle her plants to be within hearing. The
disturbance was going quite entertainingly. There were no radio
sets in those days to bemuse the empty minds the half-occupied
housewives and rouseabouts. They were dependent on other
pabulum.</p>

<p>Barry was jolted out of step. He returned to the main theme with
a bang. "It's no use trying to deceive me. Ross was making up to
you. Can you answer me this, if he wasn't? Why did it happen that
if I wanted to talk to him, his head had to be kept quiet; or if
your mother said a few words to him, he was sleepy; but if we went
out of sight he talked to you nineteen to the dozen? If he's such a
gentlemanly young fellow&mdash;blast him&mdash;was it nice for him
to be so insulting lb me and your mother, who were saving his life
in our house?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was I did the talking to him and waked him up."</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" said Father triumphantly. "Give you enough rope and
you'll hang yourself. I thought you said you weren't making up to
him."</p>

<p>"I did. That was only talking to him."</p>

<p>"But that's how it begins, my fine lady. It doesn't begin by
holding your tongue and keeping away from a young man."</p>

<p>"I'd have to be in a deaf and dumb asylum to please you."</p>

<p>"I warned you before about being pert. You can't put me off the
track. You thought I didn't see him kiss you? Have you no
self-respect?" This was a venture on the old man's part. He hoped
for complete denial, but Dora nonplussed and alarmed him.</p>

<p>"He was just grateful because we saved his life."</p>

<p>"He was! Was he? Why didn't he kiss me and your mother then?" He
was so thunderstruck by Dora's admission of osculation that he was
quiet. How to extirpate this noxious weed which in spite of him
seemed to have taken firm root! He was floored by Dora's unconfused
manner. She did not act like a girl disturbed by amatory emotion.
On the other hand if she was so casual about her first experience,
as her father believed it to be, and he had guarded her
unrelaxingly, good God, no vigilance would save her from Mabel's
fate!</p>

<p>Dora laughed openly. "I must tell him he forgot to kiss you, and
your feelings are hurt. I'd simply love to see him kissing
you."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you you were never to speak to him again?"</p>

<p>"But if he comes up and says good-day, have I to tell him the
row that was gone-again like Donnegan, is in-again like Finnegan's
whiskers? It was all right while I was supposed not to know him and
could pretend."</p>

<p>"You're very pert with your tongue."</p>

<p>"You just say that because I bested you in the argument, but
supposing Ross, being a man, is a villain, what has Kate ever done
that is wrong? Everyone likes her."</p>

<p>"It's easy enough to get liked."</p>

<p>"That's not any argument. What is the matter with Ross
Lindsey?"</p>

<p>"Why is he riding about the country on a flash horse, not half
so flash as himself, and such a mongrel in the legs that it falls
down and breaks the fine fellow's head for not minding his own
business?"</p>

<p>"You object to a motor car, too. He'll have to get a flying
machine to please you. When you were young, you have often told me,
you had a fall and broke your collar bone. Did everyone say you
were a flash, useless young fool?"</p>

<p>"I expect they did often enough, and it would be no lie."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that old people always think young people are
flash fools and useless if they don't tie themselves up in a
blanket all night, and hill potatoes all day."</p>

<p>"Then supposing just for argument we admit that the police are
not after Ross Lindsey yet: but I don't like a man whose eyes run
in near under his nose like that. It always means a mean character
that you can't trust. Mark my words."</p>

<p>"Arthur's eyes are just the same. Is he a mean character?"</p>

<p>"As I was saying...as I was going to say&mdash;er," said Father,
thrown out of stride again for the moment, "Ross Lindsey may be a
dove in a hawk's nest. But seeing the law of throw-back in all
animals, you'd be safer in my opinion in looking for good stock,
and taking a hawk out of a dove's nest, than a dove out of a hawk's
nest."</p>

<p>"You are talking about animals. Human beings are different!"</p>

<p>"In what way, pray, unless most animals are gentlemen compared
with most so-called gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Well, haven't I a right to a little fun? I never can go to
anything for fear the Lindseys will be there. Supposing they do
duff a few sheep, it's none of my business. It's a pleasure to see
Mr. Lindsey raise his hat. Most men fumble as if they had
rheumatism in the joints."</p>

<p>"Raise his hat! Be damned! Blast him and his hat!" Father roused
to the loudest Hereford bellow. "I've always noticed that these
villains in the newspapers, that embezzle and murder, are
well-dressed and very polite. They raise their hats! I think
raising the hat is one of the signs of a scoundrel. I'll never
raise my hat again to anyone as long as I live. I'll set an example
against this hat-raising among decent men."</p>

<p>"Oh, Father! What a card you are." Dora laughed outright.
"People will only think it's because you have a chin-strap or
because your head is slippery like an ostrich egg."</p>

<p>She escaped into the house on this note, her father check-mated
for the moment, calling after her: "You needn't try to change the
subject. You hear now! I'll have no goings-on with Ross Lindsey
under any excuse or name. I'll stop it if I have to keep you on a
chain under lock and key."</p>

<p>He turned to Mother, a note of defeat in his declamation. "Not
whether he's a good neighbour, or a good husband and father, or
clever with stock, or keeps his fences trailed in a dry season, but
to put a man on a pedestal because he raises his hat! Gosh! What
can the world be coming to?"</p>

<p>"It's the same as it always was, Father."</p>

<p>"Did you notice when I said he kissed her, she was as bold as
brass? I'm not going to have a second case of Mabel, if I have to
take a gun to both of them."</p>

<p>"You make her wilful trying to coerce her, and if you blare the
same thing at her over and over again, it loses its effect."</p>

<p>"Do you countenance them?"</p>

<p>"I don't; but why not try being peaceful for a time?"</p>

<p>"And let it happen all over again. Gosh, how can you be so cool
about it? It must have come from your side of the family. There was
never any looseness in mine."</p>

<p>"Everything good came from your wonderful family and everything
bad from mine. It's a lucky thing I just had sufficient
intelligence to marry you." Mother returned to her pots definitely.
Father drooped with dejection. Mother looked at him and added: "The
trouble is, you are so much alike."</p>

<p>"Alike! When did I ever carry on with this defiance?"</p>

<p>"Anyone can see you're out of the same basket. You're going the
right way to drive her to Ross Lindsey. His attraction lies in
being forbidden fruit, and she doesn't know the rights of the old
trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, that's your idea, keeping it from her. I don't believe in
secrets, and she'll have to find out some time."</p>

<p>"I think she is much happier not to know."</p>

<p>Father reflected that all he could do was to increase his
vigilance as chaperon. "Gosh, it beats Bannagher; girls will pass
by good deserving young men and be caught by&mdash;by&mdash;God
bless me soul, by hat-raising."</p>

<p>"As for that, when you were courting me, my father had a sawny
something like Tom Harris picked out; but I wouldn't look at him
once you came my way."</p>

<p>"But God bless me soul, I was never as flash as Ross
Lindsey."</p>

<p>"My father thought you were."</p>

<p>"But not you&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Not then."</p>

<p>"I wonder what you would think now?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I'd do it all over again."</p>

<p>"We haven't done so badly," said Father in a mollified tone.
"Some of the young ones will have their work cut out to do as
well...Dear me, and so you would do it all over again."</p>

<p>"I suppose I'd have to. Girls have very little choice," said
Mother with a sigh. This qualifying rider did not prevent Barry
from stooping to kiss her affectionately before departing on an
evening tour of inspection. He put his hat on his head and pulled
down the green fly veil. Then he turned to survey himself in the
looking glass hanging on the kitchen wall. He regarded the big
beard. Once it had been a hearty red, now it was the colour of
straw. If his face could be turned upside down, he mused, he would
have a tremendous shock of hair. Apropos of his threat against
hat-raising, he undid his chin-strap and lifted his hat. His head,
as Dora announced, was naked as an ostrich egg in a slight nest of
bleached grass. No, he was damned if he was going to act like a
monkey on a stick with his hat. He jammed it on and buckled the
strap a hole tighter than comfortable. He took a long stockwhip
from a peg and went out by the back gates.</p>

<p>While he and Dora had been wrangling, Concertina Mick chopped
and carried a fine supply of wood for Mabel. He consulted her about
oven wood and long wood and remarked with meaning: "There's one
thing I'd never let a woman belonging to me do, and that's chop
wood. A man that lets a woman cut wood is a crawler, I reckon."</p>

<p>With this sentiment Dad Barry would have cordially agreed had he
been within hearing. Mother or Dora had never chopped wood except
in extreme emergency. Mabel frequently chopped wood when she ran
out, but no one noticed. She never uttered a word of criticism of
her lot. She was deeply grounded in the belief that she had brought
it on herself and in doing so had also ruined the lots of all her
family. She never thought of changing her lot nor yet of escaping
from it. She just plugged away like a working cow, only the law
forbade that cows should be worked in chains or ploughs.</p>

<p>Something in the way Mick looked at her while uttering his noble
sentiments suddenly suggested new possibilities, that and the two
offerings of sweets. Also, Sid was dead. The shock of the
announcement had made her feel sick at first, but now it was like
an eased ligature. When Mick played on the accordion that evening,
she stayed among his audience and darned socks instead of going to
her own room as was her habit when there were visitors, though Mick
was more of a cross between a station "hand" and a member of the
household than a visitor.</p>

<p>Dora regarded him with increasing disfavour. She was also
discontented with her father in his white flannel undershirt,
collarless. He had only put a coat over it for the evening meal,
and still wore his moleskins anchored by able braces of striped
elastic.</p>

<p>He irritated her in comparison with the Lindseys. They would not
be eating with such as Concertina. Kate might even be in real
evening dress. Dora felt her home dull and empty, and life a
deflated toy balloon. The Lindseys had gone, and future association
with them was forbidden. Downcast and lonely, she retired early.
She dragged the comb savagely through her heavy curls till she
remembered what Ross had said in case of hostilities being resumed.
The old tree hollow by Dingo Creek. Would he really leave a message
there! It was an interesting possibility.</p>

<p>Even Father and Mother were feeling cheerless, and retired
early. Mabel, contrary to custom, went to the kitchen, where Mick
followed, and she made a cup of tea in which he joined her. Arthur
came blinking from his bed in the adjoining store-room, complaining
of toothache. Concertina was fertile in remedies, and Arthur
subsided in a way suggesting that his malady contained a good deal
of heart ache. He was wrath about the withholding of his gifts.</p>

<p>"W'at right has Father to take me things? He doesn't give me any
money to get things meself, and I work a lot more than one-eyed
Sam, and he gets near a quid a week."</p>

<p>"But you get all your food and clothes," said Mabel, alarmed by
this rebellion.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be working for someone else. If Father won't give
back me things, I've a good mind to go and arsk Mr. Lindsey for a
job."</p>

<p>"You couldn't do that! Mr. Lindsey wouldn't give you a job,"
said Mabel earnestly.</p>

<p>"How do you know? I could arsk him at any rate."</p>

<p>"You better come and help me, Arthur. I must have a man to help
me for a few weeks. That 'u'd be a bit of a start for you. I was
thinkin' of arskin' for your help in return for me doin' something
here, and I could let you have a few bob for yourself."</p>

<p>"Great jumping snakes, do you mean it, Concertina?"</p>

<p>"You bet your shirt, I do. I'll ask the Dad ter morrer."</p>

<p>Mabel persuaded Arthur to suppress his excitement and go to bed
upon this, and his snores soon arose.</p>

<p>"I've been thinkin' of that for a good while," said Concertina.
"The boy wants a bit of a change. It's a pity he gets nothink but
work. I could take him to the cricket match at Canberra."</p>

<p>"You're the first person ever thought of Arthur," said Mabel.
Mick saw with satisfaction that she was overcome. This had had an
immediate result whereas his snake-skin belt and trimmed beard had
apparently gone unnoticed. He was moved to go farther.</p>

<p>"A bloke would be lucky to have a son like Arthur, all ready
grown, so to speak&mdash;he's as splendid a worker as there is in
the district."</p>

<p>But at this Mabel left the kitchen, simply warning Mick to blow
out the lamp and bolt the door. Mick however was satisfied. He had
noted her trembling lip.</p>

<p>She threw herself on her bed and sobbed carefully, into the
pillow so that she could not be heard through the slab walls. She
had not sobbed for many years. Long ago the well of her tears had
been scorched dry, but these tears were relieving as raindrops on
the dust after prolonged drought.</p>

<p>She soon dried her eyes and took out the parcel sent by Mrs.
Lindsey. It was filmy lace of exquisite quality. She put it away,
startled by its beauty, and wept again.</p>

<p>Sid Lindsey was dead. He had become non-existent. She could no
longer maintain her hatred of him for his cowardice and cruelty to
her. His mother had sent her love and this beautiful lace. Mick had
said a man would be lucky to have a son like Arthur, and that a
women belonging to him would never have to chop wood. Mick's voice
was soft and low and slow. Her lot lightened as the landscape under
the rising sun. Perhaps she need not for ever endure Father's
bullyragging about the bed she had made. There might be another bed
for her, and it couldn't be harder than her present couch for all
it was cushioned with feathers.</p>

<p>Mick pulled off his boots thinking he would have to act up to
his offer to Arthur. He was growing very fond of his sojourns at
Bandicoot. The bed was grand, so were the meals&mdash;all Mabel's
work. Gripes, what a good worker she was! The old man if properly
managed might let a bit of cash come with her as an offset to.
Arthur. A double bargain in that, as Arthur was as good as a man
and used to bullocking. It would be great to have a fire and a meal
awaiting him at dark, and a woman moving about looking to things.
First rate to have a feather bed of his own, and a wife in it. His
consideration reverted to Arthur. Mick, like Mrs. Barry, was not
socially ambitious. If Arthur had been some tramp brat, it would
not be so good, but he was Sid Lindsey's, and Sid Lindsey was dead.
Mick knew that, as he also knew that Sid's father had parliamentary
opportunities. It pricked Mick's sense of humour to think of Arthur
as his own stepson and at the same time grandson of a member of the
Legislative Assembly. Mirk was like that.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="poem">ROSS TO DORA<br>
<br>
"Why should some old story<br>
Shut us from the glory<br>
Of soft shadows falling<br>
When night birds are calling,<br>
When spring's at its sweetest,<br>
And life's at its fleetest<br>
What harm can there possibly be?<br>
Why, none that I possibly see."<br>
<br>
DORA TO ROSS<br>
<br>
"Sir! Your hand to my toe,<br>
To my saddle I go,<br>
Then off in the spring.<br>
Swiftly hoof-falls shall ring<br>
And chime with our song<br>
As we gallop along.<br>
Oh, come for a gallop with me,<br>
A gallop, a gallop with me!"</p>

<p>The ordinary routine of life was resumed at Bandicoot. Old Barry
was healthily occupied superintending his flocks and homestead, in
riding abroad on business connected with his property. He was
honorary consulting&mdash;and often working&mdash;veterinary to the
district. His time was full and his life might have been happy and
public but for the kink in his temper which made him nurse and
exaggerate his wounded pride and rancour against Lindsey.</p>

<p>Mabel too was very busy. She worked so unremittingly from
morning till night that she usually went to bed thoroughly tired.
On her thin shoulders fell the task, stealthily, of helping Arthur
to milk the cows in the winter when his fingers were cracked and
bleeding with chilblains. Or she would creep to the dark room at
the end of the stables help him de-sprout the potatoes, or to the
orchard and assist in bandaging and whitewashing the apple trees,
or to the barn to work with the chaff cutter or corn sheller or the
prize merinos&mdash;anything to brighten his loneliness and soften
his nascent rebellion, everything to avoid Arthur's altercations
with her father. Those Hereford bellows that stimulated her mother
and failed to bruise Dora, fell on Mabel's shattered nerves like a
sledge hammer.</p>

<p>Despite her efforts Arthur grew more loutish and fractious from
too much dull drudgery and suppression. From the age of twelve, a
huge, over-grown fellow, he had earned his keep. For the last two
years, since he had turned fifteen, eager and energetic, he had
swelled with pride because he could outdo any ordinary man hired to
work on the station. He had to be restrained from some work, such
as fencing, lest he injure himself in his desire to demonstrate his
strength and size. He had Barry's physique and colouring&mdash;the
features only of his father. The Barry resemblance which in regular
conditions would have been full of pride for the old man, was but
an additional thorn in his hand. The relationship of the
bastard&mdash;a Lindsey bastard&mdash;was evident, and as grit
between his teeth.</p>

<p>It never occurred to him that he was mean to accept so much work
from Mabel and Arthur without wages. On the contrary he prided
himself as an unsurpassed husband and father. He had not struck
Mabel nor kicked her out upon the dreadful discovery. He kept both
her and the boy. Mabel still in her own room. They were free at the
table to eat their fill without comment save Dora's animadversions
upon the youth's appetite. They were clothed. In making out the
list for his own dungarees, hoots, etc., Barry always provided a
good supply for Arthur, and his wife purchased Mabel's dress
requisites with her own. After the first outbreak he had never
directly attacked nor abused Mabel. His roarings were no more
directed at her than at Dora, the darling, only in Mabel's case
they fell on a wound that never healed, on her own count and her
boy's.</p>

<p>"He's a good boy! Why should Father be so hard on him?" she
would question resentfully, and lie awake and plan. Though her
father withheld wages he was generous with perquisites. She took
charge of the dairy and poultry. So long as there was a plentiful
supply of butter and eggs she was permitted to sell the surplus as
opportunity offered. She had some stud fowls too with which she won
prizes in Father's name, and he allowed her the money. This had
likewise been the rule with preserves and fruit. Pound by pound she
wag adding to her store for her old age in the expectation of the
alienation of her normal share in her father's property.</p>

<p>She started a bank account, getting Dora as she grew up to take
the money in a sealed envelope, and a receipt or other notice from
the bank was her only correspondence. She was secret concerning her
hoard, and fearing that it might some day be confiscated, had in
addition a golden store in a crock buried in the earthen floor of
the dairy. When a sovereign came her way she put it in the crock,
and there had been nearly a hundred at latest counting.</p>

<p>Confronted by Arthur's discontent her thoughts were continually
on this hoard. She wondered if she could select a block of land
somewhere, far away from her disgrace and her father's bellowings,
and with the aid of Arthur work it. When it came to the point she
was too timid from seclusion, and shrank also from the sensation
her course would excite all over again. She was also afraid to
tackle her father with such a scheme, and the thought of leaving
Bandicoot and the orchard and the live stock with which she was so
intimate and in which she found her association, held her. She
would only work up to the final act by some move against Arthur or
herself.</p>

<p>Then Concertina Mick put on a snake-skin belt and trimmed his
beard and brought her sweets.</p>

<p>The sly, observant man had noticed that perquisites went her
way. He had no idea to what extent and was too wise to ask Mabel.
He considered that fifty pounds or one hundred pounds in cash with
a wife would be a great lift, and that Arthur was cheap labour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry, though past the meridian, also had her discontents
for lack of occupation and recreation. Her flowers did not engage
all her energy. She did not read. She was weak on fancy work. She
had no correspondents. Father did not encourage her relatives. They
were always wanting to borrow money or live stock. Some years since
most of them had moved to the Bellinger, and Barry hoped they would
remain safely there. Mrs. Barry needed that diversion that comes
through human contacts, that drama which for her was contained in
gossip, and the few folks who visited Bandicoot lacked direct
access to the big establishments that flecked Canberra Plain. If
she could have resumed association with Chesham Park, she could
have sat in some corner and quietly pumped diverting information
from various sources.</p>

<p>Dora too was running to waste for the right kind of occupation,
and every time Mabel heard her bewail the lack of fun and friends,
the knowledge that it was due to her own fall so stabbed Mabel that
she strove to make life physically easier for Dora. The girl was
thus freed in the wrong way, but Mabel knew no other, Dora was not
educated to employ leisure. It degenerated to idleness fermenting
with restlessness. She had grown up and clamoured for her
birthright. Matters were merely precipitated by Ross Lindsey
breaking his pate at Bandicoot gates. In any case the old situation
could not have been maintained.</p>

<p>Following Ross's departure she became increasingly aware of the
unsatisfactory nature of her days. Once a week to town for a
singing lesson from an elderly woman, to which she was firmly
escorted by her father, did not meet her ideas of a gay life. She
could put on her smart habit and admire her developing figure
assisted by a pair of Excelsior corsets to assume those lines
indispensable to the ultra feminine in her day. She could mount
Greygown, worth forty or fifty pounds in the open market, but who
was there to appreciate her person or her horsemanship? She could
gallop to old Mrs. Turpey's on some excuse, but that was not
exciting. She was not forbidden calls upon a few settlers' families
on cleared patches in the gullies back of Bandicoot range, but she
craved the more interesting companionship of Kate and Ross Lindsey,
and it was incomprehensible that her father would not let her go
near them.</p>

<p>There was Tom Harris. Her father was delighted with him. He had
lately bought out a couple of inept selectors and was entrenching
himself as a sound man of property. There was nothing against
either his principles or his breed. He was a cousin of one of the
seigniorial homesteads dotting the plains between Bungendore and
Yass, but to Dora's taste he was on a level with Concertina.</p>

<p>He came at least once a week, and Concertina remarked with a
grin to Mabel: "Cripes! He's got it bad!"</p>

<p>"Mark my words, Tom will own as far as you can see when some of
these other fellows will be trying to cadge a bob for a bed and a
drink," Father would exclaim.</p>

<p>Tom wanted to escort Dora to a cricket match and King's birthday
picnic at Canberra. Father was ready for Dora to accept, but she
wasn't going to make a laughing-stock of herself by appearing with
Tom. She did not approve of his tailor. He had a reddy-brown suit
that sickened her, and she hated the way the stubble appeared on
his chin, and as for his ears, she could have cheerfully cut them
off. She averred she could hear them flapping a mile distant. His
horse too was a trial. The faithful beast could not keep up with
Greygown's superb walk, and Tom was always hop-hopping after her in
a sort of running jog, half-standing in the stirrups, "As if he was
drunk." One of the shearers that came each year always rode in the
stirrups, and he was described as "a regular old swamp hog for
booze."</p>

<p>Things were somewhat tame at Chesham Park, too. The political
plans for Lindsey were retarded for the time. Whatever Lindsey's
principles in business, he was a model husband. Mrs. Lindsey adored
him and he showed her the utmost devotion. She begged him not to
stand for Parliament as it would take him so much from her, she not
being strong enough to go to Sydney with him.</p>

<p>Lindsey asked his supporters to find someone else. They did not
press the question. There would be no dissolution for nearly a
year, and other matters such as the choice of the site for the
Federal Capital and the compensation likely to be paid to the
dispossessed squatters were more vital to the district. Bearded
chins wagged unceasingly on every public-house veranda.</p>

<p>Noting Dora's restlessness and to keep her out of danger, her
father attempted to entertain her. He took her here and there in
his light buggy drays drawn by the prize pair of greys. Cajolements
had netted the stylish hat like a distorted dinner plate filled
with roses, advertised by Anthony Hordern and Sons, and in which
Dora looked a picture.</p>

<p>As a great splash, Father took her to the Church of England
Bazaar in Queanbeyan, where she immediately become one of the
pretty maidens in the stall presided over by the wife of the
leading bank manager. Dora was a new attraction and in her
enthusiasm and energy did the work of three.</p>

<p>Barry was an enormous success at the bazaar. So was Tom Harris,
and he looked quite personable, so that Dora hoped one of the
Misses Chitters (daughters of the banker) would take him off her
hands. They applied their blandishments in vain. Tom had the
faithfulness of the unattractive.</p>

<p>Delight was heightened for Dora when she saw Kate Lindsey
entering the hall, followed by Mr. Lindsey and Ross. Barry was in a
hole. He wanted to shepherd Dora, but he did not want to be too
friendly to Lindsey. He suspected something of the curiosity there
might be to observe how he met Lindsey since Ross had been laid up
at Bandicoot. He nodded "Good day" curtly. He did not offer to
shake hands, but Lindsey had been too crafty to offer his. He
raised his hat.</p>

<p>Kate put out her hand, which Barry could not refuse, and he
asked after Mrs. Lindsey. He did not raise his hat, much to Dora's
chagrin. She was at that age when this was a minor disgrace. The
district was used to Blastus however, and was not critical of what
he did with his hat. At bazaars it was his fat and freely flowing
purse that was popular, and in the district at large it was his
veterinary skill and electoral influence that counted.</p>

<p>Kate, genuinely kind, asked Dora if there were any of the
Bandicoot preserves or cakes on sale. If so she wanted them all.
They were away at the provision stall provided over by matrons with
as lively a sense of values as of rivalry. Kate said she would go
there later when Ross was ready to go home and help her carry
things. The gossips said that Kate was "smoodging" so to the Barrys
that her father's candidature was still to be expected. They were
only postponing announcement till old Blastus could be buttered up
a little.</p>

<p>Then Ross began his depreciations among the beauties. They had
the Sweets Stall and the Fish Pond and the Post Office and were
reaping a rich harvest of fun and silver. A Miss Chitters got him
to take a ticket for a tin of station sweets which she was
raffling. Dora likewise asked him to contribute towards her
offering which was a huge box of chocolates. While she was writing
his name and he was sharpening her spare pencil, he asked the price
of another prize box at the back of the stall. It was in the shape
of a crescent moon, very large, tied up with a blue sash and
decorated with a lovely girl and "the man in the moon."</p>

<p>"It's a guinea. We'll have to raffle that too to get the money,"
said Dora.</p>

<p>But when Ross returned the pencil, he also passed a sovereign
and a shilling and murmured laughingly: "Say there is a reserve on
it, and when you are going home take it yourself. Only she's not
half so pretty, the girl reminds me of you, and I'm afraid Tom
Harris will be nabbing her."</p>

<p>Dora laughed, all confusion and excitement. Poor Tom was like a
gissob, wobbling and stuttering and unable to say yes or no. He had
spent two or three pounds already and yet he could not do a stylish
thing like that. No wonder people liked the Lindseys.</p>

<p>"I must go to the post office to send you all letters, and be
sure you all reply," continued Ross to the girl in charge at that
moment.</p>

<p>A gay chorus rang after him as he penned his missives. He
certainly knew how to do things. He went off raising his hat. Dora
fairly revelled in his proficiency in this salute. He smiled back
over his shoulder, inexpressibly handsome and lithe, his lips
fascinating about his long white teeth of the narrow arch. Old
Barry, watching him from a little distance muttered: "Blasted fox!
That's just what he looks like."</p>

<p>Ross no sooner left the post office than it was besieged by the
Misses Chitters, Dora and others. None had been forgotten.</p>

<p>"I do think Ross Lindsey is the loveliest young man in the
district," said the elder Miss Chitters, to be married at Easter.
"Listen to this: 'Dear Miss Chitters, why were you in such a hurry?
No one else but Bob Cameron had a chance.' What has he said to the
rest of you?"</p>

<p>One girl announced a request for a place on her programme at the
next ball, a third a merry gibe about an admirer, and so it went.
"And now Miss Barry must read what he said to her." Dora could not
escape. She trembled lest Ross might have divulged something, but
it was merely: "Don't forget the old bush post office. There may be
something there for you." They all wanted to know what this meant.
Dora said she took it as a reminder that they all had promised to
write replies. This busied them.</p>

<p>Dora after a few attempts wrote: "The dear old bush post
office."</p>

<p>During the evening a request floated around for a song from Miss
Dora Barry. No one but Ross knew how it had originated. Dora
protested genuinely and said she had no music with her, but
business was a little flat and the chief organiser was ready to
pounce on anyone to create diversion. Dora was pressed as far as
consenting if she had her music. Ross stepped forward and said he
would play the accompaniment of "Whisper and I shall hear." He had
practised designedly. Dora, swept on by her high spirits, almost of
others' volition, found herself on the platform, with a sudden
sickness of stage fright so that all the faces seemed running
together and her knees to be melting like sperm candles in the
summer. But Ross played the prelude twice to give her time, and
whispered "Ready!" with such a heartening smile that she sang as
youthful excitement can sing when it has a pleasing voice and
immense vitality. The effort was really enjoyable, Dora looked so
splendid in her glowing beauty and youth, made endearing by her
evident nervousness. She was vociferously recalled.</p>

<p>"What shall it be?" whispered Ross, his face stuck too blasted
close to Dora's, thought old Barry, but the clergyman's wife was
beside him, "chirruping like a blasted old magpie" and Hereford
tactics were impossible in Protestant Hall, on Crawford Street at
the Church of England Bazaar.</p>

<p>Dora suggested "Twickenham Ferry." Ross had practised that too,
so off they went.</p>

<p>"Who is the girl?" many inquired with interest and admiration.
"Someone from Sydney I suppose."</p>

<p>The last supposition was rapture to Dora, when repeated to her
with the additional information that the lady, an artist from
Sydney, had raved about her "glorious. Titian hair." Dora's success
was assured. She had sung quite delightfully and Ross had
accompanied with dash. Congratulations were poured on father as
well as daughter and put the former in a quandary. Ross was the
blot, but Dad did not know how to frame his gravamen. The wife of
the Presbyterian minister sought him immediately and asked if Dora
might sing at a concert that was being arranged for funds to repair
the manse. "She would be such an attraction. Such a lovely girl."
Father demurred.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's only for the church, just here in the same hall.
You could come and look after her, and she could stay the night
with me."</p>

<p>Father could not bellow at the meenister's wife, and was quickly
involved in a 'possum dance of a conversation from which he did not
extricate himself till promising what the lady wanted. He would
have been puffed up by Dora's triumph if Ross could have been
eliminated and Tom Harris substituted, but Tom could not play so
much as "The Piper's Son" on a mouth organ. He looked on from afar
disconsolately. What a lucky fellow that Ross Lindsey was. Not only
did his horse fall near Bandicoot, but he could play the piano like
a professor.</p>

<p>The bazaar lasted three days and this was only the first. Father
did not know which way to turn for safety. A beautiful young
daughter proved a handful. She was invited to stay with the Misses
Chitters&mdash;Barry kept a solid balance at the bank. He placed no
reliance on the Chitters. The way they acted, it looked as if Ross
Lindsey might be in and out at the bank residence for meals. When
the elder Miss Chitters appeared in a real town evening dress he
was startled. She seemed a scarlet woman to him. What on earth was
he to do? The idea that Dora might be able to hold her
own&mdash;her own virtue, be safe within her own cleanly courage,
did not occur to him. His idea was to guard her by main strength.
His previous experience of freedom for daughters had been
disastrous. He sent word to Mother that he was staying in town too
for the duration.</p>

<p>The bazaar came to an end at last and Dora was safely at home,
still unspotted from the world, her father felt reasonably sure. He
had funked making a rumpus about Ross playing her accompaniments.
How to keep her out of future danger he did not know. He would have
been staggered had he known how much of dancing Dora had acquired
in the intervals of the bazaar during her stay at the bank with the
Misses Chitters.</p>

<p>However, following the bazaar, Dora seemed content and unusually
biddable. She wrote her father's letters and sang his favourite
songs with alacrity. She also practised diligently. Her father
would have been dismayed could he have understood the import of her
quieter demeanour. It covered a determination to live her own life
that was remarkably fixed for one of her age and day. She did not
quite know how to set about it but the intention was brewing like
yeast. She would not sit down with Concertina and Tom and Mabel and
Arthur and forego a radiant future out in the world.</p>

<p>She smiled when she looked at the big crescent box. The Misses
Chitters suspected it had come from Tom Harris, a suspicion which
Dora fostered. She read and re-read the note about the post office
and threw it among her ribbons. Was love awakening towards Ross
Lindsey? Was it rather that she had an untried maiden's love of
love and Ross was so much more a seemly instrument of romance than
was Tom Harris?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="poem">When Lindsey invites him, no reck how it spites
him,<br>
Her father says: "Ho! I shan't let her know,"<br>
And thinks thus to settle her flings,<br>
But Cupid says: "No! I'll send her a beau,<br>
Who can dance; and play while she sings."</p>

<p>Attentions to Dora which caused consternation and worry at
Bandicoot passed unnoticed at Chesham Park, where they were used to
Ross's gallantries. He played accompaniments for Rose Ann, who
could not keep the key, and for Blackett M.H.R. while he bleated.
"Larboard Watch," and for the stream of Young ladies who visited
Chesham Park, some coming from as far afield as Melbourne, and all
feeling for a time that they had made a conquest of Ross. He had
undoubted social gifts.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Lindsey pleaded with her husband not to stand for
Parliament she said: "What good will it do you? You will be out of
pocket by it and won't be able to attend to the station."</p>

<p>These arguments were to be overborne by insistence upon the
immense amount of good Lindsey could do for the district,
especially now when there was a possibility that the Federal
Capital might be placed in its midst. It was pointed out that Ross
could manage the station and that a sojourn in the climate of
Sydney with hot sea water baths&mdash;which were then a medical
fashion&mdash;might set Mrs. Lindsey up. These arguments had a
certain weight. Lindsey had sufficient leaning toward Parliament to
consider a ball for the district.</p>

<p>The inner caucus discussed it secretly. It was proposed for new
year, in the warm weather, so that the old as well as the young
could attend. It was to be held somewhat in the open air in and
about the woolshed and to be preceded by a picnic high tea at the
house. To that sort of affair every one could be invited, and more
particularly the selector neighbours. If the time seemed propitious
Lindsey as a candidate could be sprung on the assembled
multitude.</p>

<p>Would the Barrys accept an invitation? This would prove whether
or not the old man would be against Lindsey, or consent at least to
be neutral.</p>

<p>Kate wrote a kind letter to Mrs. Barry hoping that she would
come, as her mother was specially looking forward to seeing her.
Unfortunately that letter reached Bandicoot on the day that Father
opened the Courier and read a piece copied from the Sydney papers.
Some free lance familiar with the Queanbeyan district had written
an article on London wherein he stated that in a window of one of
the great shipping companies in Cockspur Street he had noticed a
fleece of merino tied up with a blue sash that took him back to
Queanbeyan and Yass. On examining the attached ticket it proved to
be a prize fleece from Bandicoot Hill Station near Queanbeyan,
whose owner, Mr. Wm. Barry, a type of fine old pioneer&mdash;alas,
becoming rare&mdash;had done so much for Australian wool growing.
The article had been copied in full and there were other
compliments to Barry.</p>

<p>"There!" he said, elated. "That's the kind of tribute that a man
can take comfort in. Something honest and solid and practical
behind it. Compare that with having the first telephone, or buying
the first motor car and splashing about. Any fool with an overdraft
and burrs in his wool can do that, but raising the breed of sheep,
raises the price of wool and brings more money to the whole
district. I'm prouder of that honour than if I was made a dozen
J.P.'s. I'd like to see that fleece in the window in London."</p>

<p>"It mightn't be your fleece at all," said Mother.</p>

<p>"God bless me soul, woman, what do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"It might be any fleece, and your name just stuck on it for an
advertisement."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You don't know what you're talking about. Business
men don't do that sort of thing." Mother's words however took so
much gas out of him that he turned from the delectable article to
another column. If, instead of puncturing him, Mrs. Barry had
humoured him and called him apart to consider Kate's letter while
he was glowing, he may have surrendered, at least to the picnic,
but in her love of taking him clown a peg or two, she lost the
right moment. In the gossip column someone had been indiscreet:
there was a paragraph about a little bird whispering that Mr.
Lindsey was probably the next parliamentary representative for
Weeowera. This surpassed the fleece. Father was off.</p>

<p>"Good God! Here's old Sandy Lindsey been chose for member of
Parliament instead of Smithers."</p>

<p>"Show me," said Mother, and later remarked: "It's no use of
counting chickens before they're hatched. He would have to be voted
in."</p>

<p>"He'll never e voted in if any votes I can control can keep him
out. I will not stand for a scoundrel like that being made a god
of. How could a crawler that can't keep laws know how to make them.
I'll stump the district against him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry, knowing that this attitude was fatal to her hopes
and in the sting of disappointment, arose and remarked that
jealousy was a terrible thing and that bad temper was madness. It
was worse than dishonesty to poison one's life. Father bellowed,
but Mother went off to tickle her plants. She did not find the
virus so stimulating when it thwarted her own plans as when it was
operating against some other wight. Father did not pursue the
matter with her. She was one of those meekly stubborn people as set
in her own way as was her spouse.</p>

<p>Though Father was lord of his stock runs and the "best room"
adorned with the merino chiefs, Mother had little difficulty in
reigning on the front veranda or in the conjugal apartment. A woman
of small spiritual and mental register, and with a lively sense of
number one, was well-adapted to succeed in the individualistic
circle herein considered. Protected by the unavailability of other
complaisant women, or the inexperience plus conventional
respectability which prevented her man seeking extra marital
service, she had a firm hold on him through his sexual frailty.
Father's snortings were rarely directed towards his wife. She had a
comfortable existence. The seclusion insisted upon by Father irked
her more than the disgrace which had caused it and which had
provided her with an unresisting and permanent domestic slave. She
had no such puritanical moral sense as Barry, as he perspicaciously
suspected, and would have enjoyed going abroad to gossip and to
pose as a martyr&mdash;the "had a lot of trouble" role in which
women starved for drama and sex adventures revel.</p>

<p>She did not show her husband Kate's letter till he was safely in
bed. To her surprise he did not roar. He spoke almost in a whisper.
"Dora must not see this. Take no notice of it. Don't let them know
we ever received it." Father assumed the role of virtuous parent.
"I'm very anxious about Dora. She is taken by the flash airs of
Ross and he means no good, I can see that. This coming by here was
on purpose to worm his way in, only he overdid it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Father! He wouldn't risk his life."</p>

<p>"No, but he pretended to be a lot worse than he was."</p>

<p>"How could he deceive the doctor?"</p>

<p>"Well, can you answer me how a fellow so bad as he was supposed
to be, only a few weeks after was in Queanbeyan flashing about, all
night at bazaars."</p>

<p>"I thought the bazaar closed before midnight, and he was only
there one evening. Youth soon recovers. You'd better make a nun of
Dora if you want her to be quite safe."</p>

<p>"I've noticed him with all the girls&mdash;you'd think he was
struck on them all, and Dora is silly enough to think she comes
first."</p>

<p>"How can you tell what she thinks? You'd he the last to find
out."</p>

<p>"What does she think, if you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't. That's why I don't pretend to say."</p>

<p>Father went off on another track. "I knew the Lindseys were
smoodging to us for some end of their own. It wasn't our society
they suddenly wanted. This member of Parliament business explains
it all. If he thinks he can pull the wool over my eyes, he's a
fool&mdash;blast him! He's too flash to have a meal here, and he
only invites you there with old McTavish, who looks like a pauper
with the sign of 'God help us' on him; and old Slattery, the real
old bog-trotter with a face like a big red potato; and his daughter
like alike a flour-bag on a clothes-prop."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Father! That's spleen. If he asked you there when
there was only the family, you'd say it was because you weren't
good enough for anyone else to see. He couldn't please you if he
tried."</p>

<p>"Now you've spoken the truth. He couldn't please me because a
scoundrel couldn't please an honest man, who has carried his day as
a pioneer and will continue to carry it without these
crawlers..."</p>

<p>"All right, Father. I know all about that. I pioneered with you,
bore my children without help and suffered in many ways. You carry
your day and let Lindsey carry his now."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I can't say a thing but you take it up wrong."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll hold my tongue, and you hold yours. If I'm
worried I can't sleep."</p>

<p>As a final gesture Barry tore the letter to pieces, filling
Mother with resentment. It was her letter and she was interested in
the embossed note-paper. Despite this she was soon soundly asleep
while her husband lay awake seething, the poison of habitual
rancour boiling in his veins. He thought of his "improved" acres,
while Lindsey's were still wild or choked with briars, blackberries
or other noxious weeds, and alive with rabbits. He thought of his
Vermont darlings and the fleece of one in a blue sash in a great
window in London. What maddened him was that despite such
solidities people were attracted by Lindsey's spurious style and
his financial show which was a mere shell supported by a heavy
overdraft.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry said nothing of the invitation to Dora. She confided
in Mabel, who was unusually noncommittal. As a rule she was as
suspicious of Lindsey good-will as was her father, but Sid Lindsey
was dead now. Her rock of rancour had dissolved, leaving an open
stream on which she contemplated embarking.</p>

<p>Every now and again when safely bolted in her own room for the
night she would look at Mrs. Lindsey's lace. The gift, and the
beauty of it had the softening effect of a flower on one long shut
in a dungeon. And there was the bank balance and also the crock in
the dairy. She was beginning to dream of a way out of the weary
turmoil about the Lindseys.</p>

<p>Mick Bell would not let a woman of his cut wood. His voice was
soft and low and slow. He was kind to Arthur. Perhaps he would be
willing to go out of the district. A new bed. It couldn't be any
harder than the old one, though that was of feathers and down, and
in winter was covered by a gorgeous 'possum rug. Concertina and his
beard would be in the new bed; but Mabel was no feminist. She had
no ambition to struggle on without a man. She felt a husband would
help to reinstate her.</p>

<p>Could she trust Mick? Was he, under his soft manner, a liar and
a coward like Sid Lindsey? She must keep her money to herself, make
legally sure of it. To test whether Mick really cared for her she
would not let him guess how much she had.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry replied to Kate's letter. She said that she never
went to any public function now, and that as Dora's father did not
approve of her dancing they would not be present at the picnic or
ball. She was very thankful for the kind invitation and sent her
love to Mrs. Lindsey. She would make an effort to visit her at some
other time.</p>

<p>To post this, Mrs. Barry drove over in her sulky to see old Mrs.
Turpey at the post office and when no one was looking, dropped the
letter in the mail box.</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Lindsey, when Kate showed him the letter. "Old
Blastus has put his foot down. Bellowing old bull, it would take an
earthquake to change him." That was all Lindsey said. He never
wasted energy in fulminating, a great asset to an intending M.L.A.
when not on the hustings.</p>

<p>Was Ross in love with Dora? Was she to be the major passion of
his life? Was he capable of a major passion? Is there more
practical value in a major than a minor passion? The matter is
openly controversial to-day. In Dora's day and in the neighbourhood
of Bandicoot there were set conventions. Major or minor, passion on
coming to a head had either to be sent about other business or
confined in legal marriage, and no hanky-panky.</p>

<p>Ross had a gay and volatile disposition ungiven to brooding or
introspective immersion. Dora was a present delight. She was
immensely good-looking in form and face and full of youthful high
spirits. She rode superbly on topping horses, it was a pride to be
seen riding with her and a pleasure to play her accompaniments when
she sang. Added to that, the difficulties of association with her
lent zest to pursuit. Farther than that he had not examined
himself.</p>

<p>Following the bazaar he found it impossible to see her at all.
The girl was as disappointed as he. She had made up the fine new
dress in time for her birthday. She put up her hair, first like the
Misses Chitters', and then like Kate's, and then copied the fashion
books; but it was wasted with no one to conquer but Tom and
Concertina, and no spectators but the magpies, and peewits, plovers
and willy-wags. She needed someone to dress-up for instead of
dress-down-to as at Bandicoot. She looked at Mother in an apron in
the "best" room. She looked at the best room with its big table and
anti-macassars and rams and ewes, and was irritated by its hybrid
inelegant furniture and arrangement since she had seen the
drawing-room at the bank manager's. She could not picture the bank
man in a collarless flannel undershirt, with elbow sleeves exposing
forearms hairy and tanned like leather, as her father came to table
now that the days were hot. Mabel too had no pretensions to
gentility and little to amiability, though she was always ready to
do Dora's work for her upon request. Arthur was a great trying lout
who ate, and ate, and ate. Dora brooded upon what an afflicted girl
she was. She read a "little piece" about counting her blessings,
and as her high spirits revived, remembered that Greygown was much
superior to the black colt, and that Father's buggy pair could not
be equalled. The Lindseys had a motor car, but it was at that date
more of a phenomenon than the social distinction cars later
became.</p>

<p>Dora saddled Greygown and penetrated to Dingo Creek, just to see
if there was anything in the old hollow tree. To her surprise there
was a bright new mustard tin and in it a note. "If you are really
game for an adventure, why not come to the New Year ball?" Dora had
a stump of pencil and wrote on the note: "F, would kill me."</p>

<p>A day or two later she found another note. "Not a bit of fear.
Bark worse than bite."</p>

<p>"People cannot go where not invited."</p>

<p>"Invited a dozen times, by me and K."</p>

<p>This game gave a spice of romance to the girl's days, but she
had more character than to be satisfied with a petty intrigue or
the netting of Ross. She was more her father than her mother.</p>

<p>She cogitated much on possible ways of escape from Bandicoot, of
which she was weary. She could not measure the opulent resources of
the place, because she had known nothing else. She craved
singleheartedly those things lacking&mdash;congenial youthful
companions and other outlet for her energy than household tasks.
Not that she would have objected to the daily tasks if they could
have been done for more inspiration than Tom and Concertina could
supply. She would have been occupied for a time with a houseful of
guests. But reared alone, she had no friends, nor any circle of
homes with which to exchange visits.</p>

<p>She thought and thought. There was one possible avenue of
escape. She would become a trained nurse in one of the big Sydney
hospitals. That was the usual opening for girls of social
pretensions who had to earn a livelihood. Daughters of widows and
clergymen, who were poor, filled the ranks, and were joined by the
lesser squatters' daughters bored with bush life. Few of them had a
divine call to tend the sick. It was fashionable work in which they
could engage without losing social caste, and to housewives it
presented no difficulties, requiring principally stamina in feet
and a modicum of capability plus industry.</p>

<p>Dora surprised the family by announcing her intention.</p>

<p>"You'd soon come home," said her mother. "You'd never be able to
get up in the morning."</p>

<p>Father was so alarmed that he preached a rousing homily against
girls who wanted to run about and show-off in uniforms, nursing
strangers. The real womanly girls were those who could nurse their
fathers and mothers. Dora out-faced him.</p>

<p>"You and Mother aren't old enough to die yet, and if I had the
training I could look after you better when the time comes."</p>

<p>"You're too young."</p>

<p>"I wrote to the Matron of the Sydney Hospital and also to Prince
Alfred's, and they both wrote me very nice letters. They would like
me to be a little older, and the Sydney Matron says she likes
country girls and gives them every chance to begin young."</p>

<p>Father trembled in his bluchers. "The right thing for a girl is
to marry, that's in accordance with nature. She'll get all the
nursing she wants with her own children. This loud business of
wanting to be before the public never ends well."</p>

<p>"I don't want to marry," said Dora with finality, and added:
"Besides, if I did, there's no one to marry. Who would I see
here?"</p>

<p>Father discussed it in bed that night. "Has seen for herself
that that flash scut is only philandering, and she has taken this
turn. I'm glad of it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! The Miss Chitters and some of the girls she met in
Queanbeyan are going to be nurses&mdash;it's imitation. Don't
oppose her, tell her she can go when she's twenty&mdash;and long
before that age she'll forget all about it."</p>

<p>Father was so uneasy that he laid himself out to entertain. He
obtained the makings of another dress and when it was compiled took
Dora to be photographed. He promised that she should drive with him
at the Show. Dora pictured herself in the ring in the light double
buggy with the hood thrown back, the horses spanking around and she
looking tremendously grown-up in a stylish hat and one of the new
gowns that trailed on the ground, but a photograph in November, or
the Show away in the autumn, was not much of a sop to the
restlessness of hearty eighteen.</p>

<p>Dora had other plans to fill the time until old enough to be
called up at P.A. or the Sydney Hospital. Each of these fortunate
institutions had a waiting list of the finest young womanhood
extant that would take about that time to work through and reach
Dora Barry.</p>

<p>Father's security in his notion that Dora had received a
set-back from Ross was helpful to the post office trysts, merrily
proceeding. Ross boldly suggested her being present at the ball
without her father's knowledge, Dora was at first aghast but later
began to consider the adventure, Ross met her in person one
afternoon and planned for her to slip down to the gate on the main
road after her people retired, where he would meet her in a sulky
with his fast trotting mare and arrive at the ball in about half an
hour.</p>

<p>Dora's qualms gradually faded. She prepared for the worst.
Should her father e so angry as to beat her or turn her out of
doors, she would run away to Bob in Queensland. Ross said that ten
chances to one she would never be missed, as he would return her
well before daylight, and no one would tell. Ross relied on the
political expediency involved to silence talebearers.</p>

<p>Dora had more forethought, more management than that. The first
letter she had ever written had been to big brother Bob in
Queensland, and though he had not seen her since she could sit up,
they were great friends. He never failed to send her presents for
birthday and Christmas, and she wrote regularly. The other brother,
Bill, was married; but Bob was still a bachelor. The brothers had
remained in partnership and had done well, being as practical as
their father.</p>

<p>Dora had a romantic affection for this big brother, he no less a
warm sentiment for the baby sister whose photo came at various
stages of development. He was proud of her beauty, and when he
received the latest picture, he saw, as she announced, that she was
really grown-up, even to having her hair up. She told him at this
date of her determination to leave Bandicoot, and asked Bob to let
her go to Queensland and house-keep for him until she was old
enough to enter the hospital as a probationer. Later she sent a
note saying she was sick of having no fun, while other girls could
do as they liked, and for a lark was going to slip out with Ross
Lindsey for a dance or two at Lindsey's ball. She explained that
her father had an unaccountable derry on the Lindseys, and she was
tired of it. She also stated that if Dad found out he would
probably be so fierce that Bob must not be surprised to find her on
his doorstep some morning with nothing but her toothbrush for
luggage.</p>

<p>A day or so previously Bob had received a letter from Kate
Lindsey in reply to his carefully and sentimentally chosen
Christmas card. Kate, too, had mentioned the coming ball and
recalled that Bob had been her first ball partner. She mentioned
her disappointment that despite all efforts the weary old feud with
Bandicoot still continued and was spoiling the young people's
association as it had broken her own and Bob's.</p>

<p>Kate enclosed a few photographs of herself among the roses at
Chesham Park, taken by an amateur enthusiast. She observed, half
wistfully, half humorously, that she was so old and fat that he
would not recognise her, and it was a sure sign of advancing
senility that old days and friends seemed so much sweeter than new
ones.</p>

<p>That letter had made Bob consult a railway guide and talk about
taking a trip home in the autumn&mdash;in time for the Show. Dora's
note on top of it set him to packing his gladstone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="poem">The long day closes o'er the purple hills,<br>
The cooler night its starry splendour spills.<br>
By rock and sedge<br>
To water's edge<br>
The thirsty small things creep;<br>
And Mabel's heart all cold and sad<br>
Groping a way, or good or bad,<br>
If only they be free,<br>
Her lonely boy and she,<br>
Full weary falls asleep.</p>

<p>Dora's expressed determination against marriage and in favour of
nursing threw her father off the scent. More concrete signs threw
Concertina on. His only reading was the local newspaper. Otherwise
he read the roads, the trees, the whole landscape about him. He
could not have missed Greygown's tracks back and forth unless he
had two bungy eyes. They were as plain to him as hobnail boots on
new asphalt. The black Lindsey colt too had left his signatures
near by.</p>

<p>One day Mick had seen Dora approaching Dingo Creek, and hiding
behind a tree, watched her movements. A little tracking and
prospecting led him to the private post office. With undisguised
pleasure and no niceties he was free of the trysting secrets. They
were a juicy morsel in a prosaic day. Mick smiled in his beard.
What should he do with his news?</p>

<p>Finally he confided in Mabel. Relations had considerably ripened
between them. Mabel gave him late supper in the kitchen every night
he stayed at Bandicoot now, and had told him of her desire to leave
the district. Concertina agreed that he too would like a change if
he saw an opportunity of bettering himself. A man with a little
capital could start a dairy. Butter was looking up, with all the
talk of capturing the Japanese butter trade. Mabel confessed to
having nearly fifty pounds in cash, which she would like to put
into something for Arthur. Concertina had made a tentative offer,
he said Arthur would be a good partner for any man with sense. It
stood at that. After the fruit season and Show, Mabel would have
added to her hoard, and she did not want to be hurried.</p>

<p>Mick felt it decent to do something about Ross and Dora. He did
not think Ross very serious and, to do him justice, was as
interested to avert trouble as to satisfy curiosity. That he
regarded it in terms of "trouble" merely showed Mick of an orthodox
mind. He told Mabel under seal of secrecy.</p>

<p>She was panic stricken. She could see her father's rage and
Dora's danger. She thought of it as danger only. She did not want
to get Dora into trouble, but if later there was tragedy, she would
never forgive herself. Again, she was remorseful. She was the cause
of Dora's seclusion which had this dubious result. If she and
Arthur left the district, Dora would have a better field. It was
Dora's repression (her fault) that was at the bottom of this
disobedience. Mabel recalled the old days of eighteen or nineteen
years past when she and Bill and Bob had been free to roam the
district at will and to bring home their friends at any hour or day
and raise a racket of fun. Father used to join in heartily, the
only regulation being that work should not be scamped for pleasure.
Then after her slip...and it had come about so simply, so
unbelievably, she could see the same pitfall yawning for Dora, no
romance, only danger...And Sid, so eager, so loving, so full of
promises, and then, he the first to repudiate her, to treat all her
wild pleadings with scorn&mdash;treacherous, cruel. He the first to
Slander her, she who had worshipped him, who had been entirely
innocent except for him. Her heart hardened against Ross, who
reminded her of Sid. He was wonderful now, full of flattery even to
her, but...she was distraught to picture that immediate and
dastardly change.</p>

<p>What should she do? She tried to quieten her fears. Surely it
was only talk between the young people. They could not be so
daring. In any case it was evident that Ross and Dora were meeting
in the wilds, and that was more alarming than the contemplated
appearance at the ball without her father's permission and in
defiance of his edicts.</p>

<p>The night of the ball approached. The entertainment was never
mentioned by Father and Mother. Mabel counted on Concertina coming
to Bandicoot on New Year's day, but unaccountably there was no sign
of him. It increased Mabel's dilemma. She had thought to enlist him
as an unseen guardian of Dora. Mick was almost as wonderful as an
Aborigine at being stealthily present at all sorts of
functions.</p>

<p>Mick had been waylaid by Ross when on the way to Bandicoot,
riding cheerfully and carefully because of a sack across Governor's
loins, each end of which was weighted with a prime watermelon, the
first of the season, and exceedingly early&mdash;as a present for
Mabel and Arthur. For the double purpose of his music and to hold
him so that he could not report Dora's presence till too late, Ross
asked Mick to play some accordion numbers. To earn ten bob and be
in the thick of things was joyous luck to the lonely man, but there
was not time to go to Bandicoot and back again as well as to return
to his selection for his clothes. It was not Saturday afternoon or
Sunday, so he was not wearing his best suit, and his new accordion
also happened to be at the selection. The hollow post office tree
was not a hundred yards distant, and Mick said he would leave his
cargo there, a grin of impish humour being still-born in his beard
as he watched Ross's face, but Ross "never gave hisself away," as
Mick reported later. "He's as foxy as the old bloke." To be present
at the ball also satisfied Mick because he would be able to keep an
eye on Dora, but as he was unable to inform Mabel it was no help to
her.</p>

<p>Barry, instead of going to the sports at Canberra as Arthur had
pleaded, out of sheer stubbornness kept the boy bullocking from
daylight till dark. In anticipation of a plague of fires, the old
man had ploughed firebreaks everywhere as soon as the grass began
to dry. Not alone the surplus grass but in certain seasons
something in the air&mdash;stronger electric currents
perhaps&mdash;seemed to conduct fire astonishing distances by air
alone. Without wind to blow sparks Father had known fires start
spontaneously many yards apart. This was going to be that kind of a
season, mark his words, and instead of doing his share to make the
district safe, there was that crawler of a Lindsey giving a ball to
dupe people to vote for him so that he would be in a better
position to fleece the public. The flash Chesham Park had grass to
the eyes, a menace to the country. Where would it be if a tramp
threw a match, or left a bit of fire! See how much the motor car
and dancing would help then!</p>

<p>Mother, disappointed about the party, said that Father, as
usual, was looking for trouble. Father roared that he had been
watching the signs of the season, and that the extensive fires both
in Victoria and about Sydney itself showed that the Southern
Tableland's turn would come any day. He had noticed in The Daily
Telegraph that in nearly every case it had been reported that the
cause of the fires was a mystery.</p>

<p>Mother's pricks and his own rancour because he could not bring
himself to accept the Lindsey olive branch, drove him hard. "Mark
my words, I know what I'm talking about. I don't need anyone to
teach me my business in these parts," he said, coming in at mid-day
with a face like the sun, and grime from head to foot. Arthur was
like a blackamoor and in rebellious temper at being driven to work
on New Year's day. Dad pretended that his tactics were so important
that he couldn't even indulge in siesta, but sweated himself and
the youth all the blazing afternoon in burning the grass which had
grown and dried on the firebreaks since their ploughing.</p>

<p>By nightfall he was exhausted as well as irritable and this
helped Dora's purpose. Arthur wanted to sit up to celebrate the-New
Year. Father said he could blasted well celebrate by himself.
Arthur pled with Dora, but she too repudiated any celebration as
unnecessary, especially as it was twenty-four hours late. This was
such a blow to Arthur, and he looked so dejected that she offered
to sing a few songs as a substitute.</p>

<p>The boy was so tired that he objected to cleaning himself so
extensively as demanded by the society of the sacred merinos in the
"best" room, and compromised by sitting on the veranda outside the
window. He kept awake through "Where did you get that Hat?" and
"The Rooster laid a Brick," but "The Letter that never came" put
him on the blink.</p>

<p>Mabel had made a minor Christmas cake and plenty of honey mead
of a quality to shame much night club champagne at thirty shillings
per bottle, and that was the end of Arthur. It was also the end of
Father. He snored in his chair. Mother waked him. She said if he
snuffled and snorted there he would keep her awake later. The
result was that before 9.30 p.m. the parents and Arthur were sound
asleep.</p>

<p>Dora was in her room awaiting the hour of meeting. Mabel went to
her on the excuse of bringing some home-made sweets, and saw that
she was quite in bed. She was dressed under her night robe. She had
no need to crinkle her hair artificially, or that might have been a
clue. Certain boxes were strewn about, but Dora had a habit of
dressing-up in her finery. Mabel was not satisfied though Dora
seemed very drowsy. She withdrew to her own room, and Dora
reconnoitring later saw that her light was out.</p>

<p>Ross was to be at the main road gate at ten o'clock and wait
till Dora appeared. She left home at ten-to-ten, well covered in a
dark macintosh and carrying her dress and dancing shoes in a
bandbox. She was to complete her toilet at Chesham Park. Mabel did
not hear her go as she was at the other side of the house, but
after a time she slipped out to the kitchen and sat there. She
could not arouse Dora's suspicions by prowling around her door
again. She would wait till nearly twelve and then peep in.</p>

<p>She mused on Concertina's voice so soft and slow. He would not
bellow his displeasure, and he liked Arthur; but she must not
weakly count on seeming kindness. Her bank deposits and crock of
gold had more surety. She must not put her head in a noose without
legal partnership. She would go to Goulburn to a lawyer who did not
know her&mdash;run down on the excuse of seeing a dentist
there&mdash;and secretly find out her powers to possess her own
money. Father would roar and Mother be curious, but she must brave
that.</p>

<p>She thought of Bob. He had written her kind letters for the last
Christmas and birthday, and sent her a five-pound note as he had
often done to Dora. More money! That was grand, and now that Sid
Lindsey was dead there was no sense in keeping alive the grudge she
had against Bob and Bill for the bitter things they had said.</p>

<p>In the new hope that was bracing her, she recognised that her
seclusion had been a mistake, not so much for her own sake as
Dora's. People might have despised her, but she could have held her
head stiffly and now would he in a position to follow Dora herself
instead of telling her father, as would be necessary if Dora really
went to the ball.</p>

<p>As for the talk, people always babbled and criticised the
blameless as well as the culpable. She habitually restrained
herself with Dora, feeling that as soon as the girl knew the rights
of the case there would be a bitter re-awakening of the old
trouble. She was beginning to hope that she would be away out of
the district before Dora became enlightened, and in case Dora
should hate her she need never cross her path again.</p>

<p class="poem">List to Willy-wag! Hark to his brag!<br>
"See how he meets her! Watch how he greets her!"<br>
Away! Away!<br>
The moke-pokes cry as the pair speed by,<br>
And the plovers call: "Away to the ball! The ball!<br>
Tut! Tut!<br>
'Tis wrong! But-but!"<br>
<br>
The merry night with summer dight<br>
Has a half-grown moon in her hair.<br>
<br>
"I shall be there! I shall be there!<br>
Oh, how I long to do and to dare,"<br>
Thus throbbed the girl. Away! Away!<br>
The iron hoofs of the trotting mare<br>
Fling the gravel like spray.<br>
<br>
Down through the gully the water sings<br>
Soft as the whisper of angels' wings<br>
Lisping, loving nocturnal things.<br>
<br>
What does the young man say?<br>
"We're in for it now, but I don't care<br>
How much the old man curse or swear.<br>
Let him go ramp and rage and blare"<br>
Away! Away! The tree tops sway,<br>
And dance with the stars till break o' day.<br>
<br>
The old can wait: they are out of date.<br>
But the young must love, and yearn<br>
To light their candle and seek their fate<br>
While yet they have time to burn.<br>
<br>
The merry night with summer dight<br>
Had a half-grown moon in her hair.</p>

<p>Dora went down to the road stepping circumspectly to avoid grass
seeds and deep ruts of dust. Her dark macintosh covered her white
underclothes; but it was moonlight&mdash;a growing moon, and Ross
saw her coming and whistled softly from where he was drawn up
behind a high clump of briars.</p>

<p>Excited greetings in subdued tones. The bandbox was stowed. One
lithe hand on the reins, the other safely swinging Dora into the
bounding vehicle, a swift, excited hug, then all attention to the
reefing blood and they were off, the gravel flying around them like
hail. Ross thrilled with conquest. He had old Barry's pet girl with
him to display like a banner before his world&mdash;a silken,
starry banner, an unsurpassed prize for its own sake, and it was
immense to tweak the old man's tail and think of his rage and
roars.</p>

<p>Dora regarded Ross as a fine cavalier, a hat-raiser, an exponent
of manners with whom she could e seen without humiliation, a
daring, stylish young gentleman who carried out this adventure with
a prize trotter such as few girls had sat behind. She gasped a
little to realise her own audacity and her father's ire. She never
thought to evade the latter. Her mind was farther ahead, on the
setting-out to Bob in Queensland, there to await a call to one of
the hospitals. No young man could overcome her with amorous
blandishments. Her father had little cause for worry. Mabel could
have gone to bed and slept soundly. Character and intelligence
behind maidenhood keep it safer than all the duennas and bars ever
marshalled. But Mabel, trembling and feeling the pain of old
wounds, could not know that, neither could old Blastus tossing
wakefully, -unhappy in his spleen. People have to be big themselves
to measure size in others.</p>

<p>At Chesham Park all was going well. The inner clique knew that
overtures towards peace had been rejected and that Bandicoot would
not he represented at the gathering. "Still 'twill have done a
power of good," said Slattery. "Shure he will be able to roar that
he rayfused an invite, and that will put him in such good humour
wid himself that ye'd be able to play marbles on his coat
tail."</p>

<p>People were interested in the possibility of the Barrys being
present. There was an idea that the old feud must have broken down
when Ross lay at death's door at Bandicoot and was nursed by the
Barrys while the Lindseys were occupied with Mrs. Lindsey.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lindsey was remarkably well and had sat out on the veranda
for an hour among the picnickers, she had also expressed a wish to
watch the dancing. To that end Kate laid her away to rest during
the early part of the evening while dressing and final preparations
had the house in a commotion.</p>

<p>When the Barrys did not appear, people wondered if they had been
invited. No one had the temerity to ask the Lindseys direct, as
they had sufficient reserve to keep impertinence at a distance, and
the inside clique kept the secret for political reasons. The Barrys
were forgotten. People had their own comedies to conduct. The young
could not be restrained from beginning the ball as soon as dusk had
fallen. They repaired to the woolshed about half a mile from the
house, complaining of the grass seeds. Not even around the
homestead buildings had any trailing been done at Chesham Park.</p>

<p>It had been a blazing day. No thunderstorm had relieved the heat
for three weeks. Everything was dry. The landscape far and wide
except for lucerne patches had been bleached to ivory by the
pitiless glare. The wide sweeping zephyrs ran like a silken shiver
over the undulations of Canberra Plain clad in long fine grasses
brittle from December heat. The treeless knolls about Bandicoot had
a naked appearance like a glistening bald head&mdash;the head of a
wicked old man who knows all about life and knows it so little good
that he is cynical. The wind had collected the dry fairy grasses
against the rabbit fences where they clung in miles of mats, tinder
dry.</p>

<p>Ross and Kate were very active, supporting their father in
hospitality. Kate was slightly decollete in a white silk dress with
many flounces frilled and looped with lace, her splendid figure
accentuated at the waist by a peaked belt. The chief persons had
given thought to their apparel to suit the occasion. The
full-bosomed nakedness of fashionable evening dress for women would
have caused a scandal among the untravelled matrons of the
Murrumbidgee gullies in those days ere the engines of Thor had rent
Mrs. Grundy's castle of propriety. On the other hand if they were
not sufficiently decorated it would e looked upon as a slight.
Kate's gown was just about right, quite grand yet modest. Lindsey
Sr., carefully on guard against "side," was in a well-cut black
cloth suit with a blaze of shirt and cuffs. Ross had attired
himself in white ducks with a cummerbund of oriental splendour and
was much admired. He had sartorial as well as social knack.</p>

<p>It was not exclusively a gathering of the seigniorage, but there
was a sprinkling, which together with the Queanbeyan professional
clique and some of the medium old pioneerage and dunniewassals was
sufficient to make the hoi-polloi feel they were seeing high
society. The bankers' and lawyers' and clergymen's wives were
there, and one or two women representatives of the homesteads whose
woolly supporters were grazing where Canberra City lies to-day.
Mrs. Blackett, the Federal Member's wife, was present and generated
whisperings as being excitingly "townie" because she had ventured
on the right degree of evening dress for the occasion, to wit, a
work of black lace with elbow sleeves and white kid gloves, and a
transparent net yoke through which the contours of her motherly
though nulliparous bosom could be discerned by intrepid
investigators. She was further exciting by a jewelled pendant, gift
of the constituents.</p>

<p>Mrs. Judson (Georgina Lindsey) was there, and then all the
neighbours and their families from the octogenarians down to
half-fledged misses in short frocks&mdash;short for those days,
about the length worn by conservative grandmothers in the
sartorially saner period of 19254930. It was a fine muster of
parental squatters, male and female, well-conditioned and
weather-beaten, and specially attired with great respect to
themselves, their hosts and fellow guests though not in evening
uniforms. The place was alive with people knowing a great deal
about live stock and nothing at all about literature or
psycho-analysis, men immensely familiar with crops and innocent of
academic culture, women who thought that in violent housewifery
they fulfilled all that God intended for the intellect of female
human beings.</p>

<p>Ross buzzed about teasing the matrons and asking them for
dances. He even steered one or two of the more grandmotherly under
the mistletoe, still hanging in the dining room, and exacted
tribute, and was riotously popular.</p>

<p>"Shure if the young feller put up, he'd be very pop'lar wid the
ladies," said Slattery, looking on.</p>

<p>Dancing was vigorously proceeding. Ross had danced with the
Misses Chitters, and got out of the way of the hoofs of Rose Ann,
as he would have expressed it, and then suggested about 9.15 that a
stroll to the house would be nice and cool.</p>

<p>The ceremonial quadrille was to be about ten o'clock, at which
hour Mrs. Lindsey wanted to e in the shed, and until which the
celebrities were not expected to appear. Ross was to transport them
in the car to escape the grass seeds. He was seen everywhere till a
little after nine o'clock but as soon as he suggested dispersal he
raced to the stable where his fast trotter was tethered in the
sulky all ready, and easing himself out of sight, tore off to
Bandicoot as for the doctor. He was back at the house by
ten-thirty, and with a word to the surprised Kate popped Dora into
her room to complete her toilet while he went on duty to the shed.
Lindsey Sr., wondering where the deuce his son had gone&mdash;with
what charmer&mdash;himself had taken several car loads to the shed,
and the opening quadrille was awaited. Ross and Kate set it in
motion, themselves not dancing in it.</p>

<p>Then someone having obliged with "The Newchum Rider," Blackett,
McTavish, Slattery and Lindsey made up one table of cards, and the
other parliamentarian, the two bankers and a seigniorial pioneer a
second in a corner cunningly arranged and well-lighted. Later they
would decamp to the house for more comfort and a snooze, but for
the time they were on duty. Their wives were similarly busy
admiring the girls and asking about teething babies or laying hens.
Their lords were concerned with the proper time to put Lindsey
forward as candidate. They did not see the first waltz. One by one
the couples took the floor. When it was comfortably full, in
whirled Ross with Dora in his arms. The political plotters missed
this sensation. A buzz of gossip ran around the edge where the
matrons were sitting, as well as around the higher tier where the
non-dancing men were established, many perched on the rails of the
sheep pens.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lindsey, a sensitive palsied wraith, was in a deep armchair
to one side and immediately caught sight of the new arrival,
closely but modestly pressed to her pet son's breast. They were the
most striking pair on the floor, for their contrasting good looks,
their dress and their zestful demeanour. Dora's gown had been
copied from a fashion plate. It had elbow sleeves and she had
daringly removed the high collar. Her hair, more brilliant than a
new penny, was elaborately "up" in a style she had practised for
days, with white roses tucked in it and also at waist and shoulder.
Like a rose bud about to open, she was radiant, healthy, excited.
Ross, slim as a reed, dark as a gipsy, was equally outstanding.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lindsey called Kate to her as she was about to enter the
circle with an elderly squatter. "Who is that lovely girl dancing
with Ross?"</p>

<p>"Dora Barry."</p>

<p>"Dora Barry! Impossible!" Mrs. Lindsey started and trembled and
could not control herself for some time. Kate sat on the arm of her
chair and held her frail fingers. "But my dear, my dear! Does her
father know she is here? I wish I had been told."</p>

<p>"I knew nothing about it, Mother, till Ross brought her to dress
in my room, and I've been too busy to ask him about it."</p>

<p>Dora was the observed of all eyes. Georgina Judson, a buxom
woman of Kate's pattern, but riper, was much interested in her. Tom
Harris was another goggle-eyed to see her. She had told him her
family was not invited, yet here she was with that Ross! How did
she get there? Things had never been promising to Tom, but there
had been hope. This quenched it. He went outside and mopped his
brow, though the night was turning suddenly cool. The sky had a
look of wind high up.</p>

<p>Kate took her mother a sip of lemonade. "Not tiring you,
Mother?"</p>

<p>"No dear. It is so nice to see you all enjoying yourselves. But
I'm so anxious&mdash;to see that poor little girl here, against her
father!"</p>

<p>"It's pathetic to see how she is enjoying herself."</p>

<p>"You'll keep her here all night and take care of her?"</p>

<p>"She wants to get home without old Blastus knowing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lindsey clutched Kate's sleeve. "Then you'll go with her
and Ross?"</p>

<p>"I expect they'd rather be alone." Kate, noting Ross's
absorption in Dora, wondered what it meant. Ross could hardly be so
foolish as to humbug Dora Barry, seeing the circumstances. Had
seriousness befallen Ross unawares? She decided to take Dora apart
and have a little chat when things settled down.</p>

<p>"We can't afford to be careless with that child's reputation.
You know what her father is. He'll think we have set a trap to ruin
her. Promise me, Kate, you won't let her out of your sight and will
take her home yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother darling, I'll see to her, though I hope we can
trust Ross."</p>

<p>"I can trust my boy, but it is the look of the thing."</p>

<p>Tom rushed up to ask Dora for a dance but she postponed him
because Mrs. Judson stopped to speak to her.</p>

<p>"I remember your brother Bill very well. Do you ever hear from
him?"</p>

<p>"Bob is the one who always writes to me.</p>

<p>"Bill was quite a beau of mine&mdash;like you and Ross seem to
be to-night, but he went away and forgot me."</p>

<p>"You forgot him too, Mrs. Judson."</p>

<p>"Looks like it, with a girl of fourteen." The matron laughed
good naturedly and went on to her mother, while eager partners
surrounded Dora.</p>

<p>Another dance was ending and Ross was determined on his deserts.
He led Dora to a nook he knew amid a few bales of wool from
stragglers and fittingly lit by Japanese lanterns.</p>

<p>The card players were stoking their pipes and having a chat
between games. Slattery's bass was leading. "Some of my yeos were
very light-woolled and had a touch of fluke in them. Och, there's
too much grass this season."</p>

<p>"Yes," squeaked McTavish. "I was ridin' about the day to pick
oot the paddock wi' the least grass seeds."</p>

<p>"Well now," began Slattery. "At supper Mr. Blackett and the
mimer for Queanbeyan can foire the first guns, an' me an' Mr.
McTavish, as two of the most important neeburs, can second it."</p>

<p>At this moment the light fell on Dora's gleaming head as she
passed with Ross. The elderly gentlemen were shaken out of their
political stride by that glad and unexpected sight. Had old Blastus
relented? Scarcely! In any case if not a complication, it was a
stimulation. The self-contained Lindsey Sr. made no remark other
than that he had forgotten something and would have to be excused
for five minutes. He would send someone to take his hand. He sent
Tom Harris, who was mooning about unengaged.</p>

<p>"Sondy's a guid mon for the deestrik," remarked McTavish while
they were waiting, "for all it is best to count your sheep wi' him
and watch the brands. He! He!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" agreed Slattery.</p>

<p>"That's aye what auld Blastus says, but he has the auld reason
for his. blether, and he'll hae maim the nicht, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>Here Tom took his seat.</p>

<p>"Crikey won't there be a nize whin owld Blastus foinds out that
the gurrl has eloped to the ball wid the young fellow," old
Slattery remarked to him genially. "Shure whoi did ye let him cut
ye out, young man?"</p>

<p>This was an infelicitous remark to Tom and no less to McTavish,
who was pleased with Tom's steadiness and tendencies toward
accumulating property, and shepherding him for Jeanie McTavish, a
long thin girl with a bleak nose and a bad complexion.</p>

<p>McTavish said: "Maye this ginger lassie Will do better than her
sister and ketch the young fellow outright."</p>

<p>"Shure I hear he's trying to ketch Concertina Mick for the owld
wan. He'll be lucky to git her off." The old man cackled.</p>

<p>"If these two bairns wad settle doon together, it wad be weel
for all concerned. Auld Blastus wadna oppose us then."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Lindsey's a goer, always first, and it's to him we
mostly owe the bridge."</p>

<p>Tom was uneasy thinking of Ross and Dora away in some romantic
corner. His suspicions were grounded. No sooner was Ross sure of
being alone with Dora than he clasped her without preliminary
approach and kissed her rapturously.</p>

<p>Dora was not expecting such a sudden and devouring onslaught.
She was breathless and thrilled. This was life indeed! Romance!
However, she protested.</p>

<p>"But that's what you promised me. This is the first ball. I've
been patient all these weeks and weeks."</p>

<p>Dora was not quite satisfied. Ross was putting things out of
place. "I don't think people should go about kissing unless they
are relatives or engaged," she said naively.</p>

<p>"You darling!" he exclaimed. "That's easily remedied. That's
what I want you&mdash;us&mdash;to be engaged. Say it's a go."</p>

<p>This placed his overtures on a proper footing for Dora. She
became mistress of the situation. "Oh, but I don't want to get
married or even be engaged." Her career was still first. This did
not make her waver in her plan to go to Queensland and then to a
hospital for training. Ross was acting splendidly in harmony with
his hat-raising proficiency. Dora savoured power and success. The
way those Miss Chitters gassed about Mr. Ross Lindsey, and how Rose
Ann gloated on him! If they only knew what he was saying and doing
now! Dora emitted a triumphant giggle which Ross interpreted as his
own conquest. She was charmed by Ross's quick witty remarks and
dashing address. It was intoxicating to feel the rhythm of the
dance in his arms, but she was in no danger of the complete abandon
that had brought disaster to Mabel.</p>

<p>"Ross, what really made our fathers such dreadfully bad friends?
What did Sid and Mabel do?" Her question was direct, earnest and
practical.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was rather over the mark. Sid was engaged to Mabel and
then went off and married some streel in a pub at the very last
minute."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't advertise it if I were thrown over."</p>

<p>"Oh, but Sid hadn't much stamina. He made a complete fool of
poor old Mabel; and I expect there were other things too."</p>

<p>"I know some of them, like Father's boots and the sheep, but
still the whole thing is silly. If one man didn't want me, I'd find
another, or do without. I think," she pursued, provocatively, "that
I'd really prefer to do without altogether. In any case this is the
loveliest night in all my life so far. I wish it could last for
ever."</p>

<p>"That's easy. It can, the minute you say the word." She turned
her face up, not at all because she had surrendered, but
paradoxically because she felt that Ross was her trophy. "We'd
better be making back to the dance. We mustn't set every old
cockadoodle cackling from here to Queanbeyan and Yass."</p>

<p>Lindsey, on leaving the card players, sought Kate and sent her
to shoo Ross and Dora back to the crowd while he said a word to his
wife. Kate told Ross his father wanted a word with him and detained
Dora.</p>

<p>"Enjoying yourself, Dora?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it's heavenly, and I think you look lovely. You are the
belle."</p>

<p>"I leave that to you now."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for inviting me."</p>

<p>"Did Ross tell you that I invited you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Of course if Father finds out he'll kill me, but it's
worth it. I'll run away to Bob."</p>

<p>"Does Bob ever talk of coming home?"</p>

<p>"No...I wish he would...Your sister Mrs. Judson says Bill used
to be an old beau of hers, and Mabel said that Bob was snooks on
you. Is that true?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we may have had a little fun like you and Ross to-night,
but such things don't count for much."</p>

<p>This was damping. "Oh, don't you think they do&mdash;not
ever?"</p>

<p>"It would mostly be better if they didn't." Kate sighed as if
weary of the ball. Dora at eighteen did not conceive of Kate at
thirty-five as still young and marriageable.</p>

<p>"Why have old people such a derry on love? Didn't they fall in
love themselves?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was the falling out of love that biassed them." Kate
did not contest the inference of her elderliness.</p>

<p>"Bob doesn't talk of coming home, but I asked him to. You see,
Father is sure to make an awful noise, so I asked Bob to come to
this ball, right here."</p>

<p>"Good for you! What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He never replied, but he hardly had time. There may e a letter
for me to-morrow."</p>

<p>While they talked, Lindsey Sr. said a word aside to Ross. "How
did that Barry girl get here?"</p>

<p>"I brought her, Pater."</p>

<p>"Clever way of stirring up the mud just now when we're trying to
bring old Blastus around! He'll be bellowing around the electorate
like his old bally bull. Watch how you tread with her."</p>

<p>"Kate and I are taking her home. The old man has no right to
keep her like a nun."</p>

<p>"He'll let you know his rights in the case." It did not occur to
Lindsey to inquire if his son were serious. "Bring her around and
I'll have a dance with her. That will give some of them a pain in
the curiosity."</p>

<p>Ross returned to claim Dora and to take her to his mother. Mrs.
Lindsey had assessed the beatific expression of Ross when with the
girl.</p>

<p>"Mother, this is Miss Dora Barry. I brought her to our
party."</p>

<p>"God bless you, my dear. How I wish your father had come too.
You must stay with us till the morning. Kate can tuck you in with
her."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, thank you, Mrs. Lindsey. I must go home just as soon as
supper is over."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, enjoy yourself...I see you think my baby boy is
rather nice."</p>

<p>"I expect, that, like all babies, he's not bad when he's
asleep," she said archly, and then impulsively bent down and kissed
Mrs. Lindsey. "I think you are lovely. Thank you ever so much for
being so beautiful to me."</p>

<p>Ross was here called upon to manage the lancers, and Dora was in
great demand. Old Slattery, confined in heavy tweeds, mopped his
brow and dug her in the ribs. "Phwat will feyther say, whin he
foinds out?"</p>

<p>"Were you never young yersel'?" rebuked McTavish, lean as a bean
stalk, with a leather face.</p>

<p>"You are not going to tell on me, are you, Mr. Slattery?"
countered Dora.</p>

<p>"Divvil a bit! Wan doesn't live at peace wid the neeburs by
tellin' tales out of school. Oi'm going to dance wid ye instid, if
ye'll say the worrud."</p>

<p>"Of course, I shall be delighted."</p>

<p>"Shure we'll have to wait for a good owld rayspictable dance.
That teetering round and round is vulgar. It would give annywan wid
annything in his head the dizzies."</p>

<p>"You must dance with me, too," interposed Mr. Blackett.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, if I can dance well enough. I've never danced with a
member of Parliament."</p>

<p>"Now, young Miss; ye're not daysertin' me for a rascally mimber
of Parliament?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mr. Slattery, of course not. I'll dance with you
both."</p>

<p>"They all seem very taken with the little girl from Bandicoot,"
remarked Mrs. Lindsey.</p>

<p>"Yes. If a girl is pretty or marked out by any notoriety, the
old men are more rabid than the young ones," replied the indulgent
voice of her daughter Georgina.</p>

<p>Applause followed the entry of Ross, escorting Concertina and
his accordion. Dora saw him with dismay and disgust, though he was
looking inoffensive and incontestably respectable in a dark slop
suit and the snake-skin belt, but minus the bowyangs, slouch felt
hat and seasoned pipe. His reception was unmistakably cordial. It
made Dora doubt the worth of her own.</p>

<p>Familiar old tunes broke out in a rich roar after the thinner
tones of fiddle and piano. A large crowd danced, or rather bumped
about, Mrs. Blackett and several other celebrities being too fat
and heavy really to dance. Ross deputed Tom Harris to be M.C. and
did not dance himself as Dora was otherwise engaged. He arranged
his mother's pillows and talked to her.</p>

<p>"What do you think of her, Mater?"</p>

<p>"She's as pretty as a picture and full of life and excitement.
But, laddie, do you think it's wise to have her here? It will shake
up all the bad feeling with the old man."</p>

<p>"Mater, we can't let that old roarer squeeze every bit of fun
out of life. I don't care if she's the devil's daughter&mdash;I
want her, Mater." It suddenly seemed to Ross that that is how it
was with him.</p>

<p>"I see you do, but heaven help me, if I can see a happy end to
it...Ah, laddie, it was fate I suppose that took you to Bandicoot
for old Barry's pet girl." Ross watched Dora in the dance with an
eager absorption there was no mistaking. His mother watched him
watching the girl. "Kate will go with you to take her home."</p>

<p>"Mater, it seems as if you didn't trust us, but even if I was a
crawler, she's the straightest little girl I know."</p>

<p>"I trust you, my boy. It's not that, but you know what's behind
this old rage&mdash;she doesn't. Every old gossip here will be
trying to pick holes in her behaviour because of what is past. I
need say no more, laddie."</p>

<p>"All right, Mater: Kate will come with us, and I'll call two or
three of the biggest bush telegraphs to see us start."</p>

<p>"That's a dear laddie."</p>

<p>Kate sat pensively on the wool bales where Dora had left her.
Dora's unconscious reference to her as old was depressing. Old! She
supposed she was out of the running now. Balls certainly bored her,
though she was a splendid dancer and still much sought as a
partner. When Dora's age, she had been equally enthusiastic, and so
had Bob Barry. No one could quite take Bob's place. He had been so
manly, so fiery, so proud, No man seemed to feel things so keenly
as Bob had done. He had been so savage and hurt. He need not have
been with her, for she too had been wounded by the disgrace. Yes,
something was lacking since those days. Youth. They could get on
without her. She was old. She remained where she was, dispirited.
She longed to go to bed, but there was no possibility of that for
hours, and when the ball waned she would have to tear all the way
to Bandicoot, squeezed and bumped, three in a sulky. Oh, well!</p>

<p>A tall, bronzed, bearded stranger stood in the opening in the
gloom, regarding her with a spreading smile that was most
infectious. He a-hemmed so as not to startle her: "Good evening,
Miss Lindsey. May I come into your nook?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she said politely. "But I can't see who it
is."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't remember me," he said, swinging up and
extending his hand. "Don't you know me, Kate?"</p>

<p>"Bob, isn't it? I might not have known you only we have just
been talking about you, and I was thinking about you."</p>

<p>"By George, that's good to hear."</p>

<p>"I know your eyes now," she smiled. "And your hands. There's the
same old lumpy finger-nail where you smashed it in the slip-rail at
Dingo Creek."</p>

<p>"So you remember that. Do you ever go that way now?"</p>

<p>"The new road goes wide of it and I have no need of a trysting
place these days."</p>

<p>"You're a sight for homesick eyes, and not changed at all." His
glances covered her devouringly.</p>

<p>"Dora tells me she wrote to you about this ball."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I got your letter too, and here I am, and what can I
do for both of you?"</p>

<p>"Mountains of things. Dora is here, and you know what that will
mean when your father finds out. We invited them all with no result
and then Ross went clandestinely and brought Dora."</p>

<p>"The Dad hasn't let-up with the years?"</p>

<p>"Not an inch. They were so good to Ross while he was there with
a cracked head&mdash;I suppose Dora told you&mdash;that we thought
it would begin a reign of peace, but no."</p>

<p>"Poor old Dad. And there's not a better old fellow going,
according to his lights."</p>

<p>"There's nothing sly about him." Kate's tone was perfunctory.
She inquired politely: "Have you come home for a real stay or only
a flying visit?"</p>

<p>"I'm determined to clear up this old row before I go back."</p>

<p>"That's nice. We'll have you here for the remainder of our
lives." Kate's tone still lacked enthusiasm. "Do they know at
Bandicoot that you've come?"</p>

<p>"Haven't a suspicion. I just dropped in for a private peep at
you, and then I must off home like greased lightning."</p>

<p>Bob looked at her and smiled. He was an immense man, vivid and
overflowing, like his father, though his waving crest had never
been so fiery, and his skin tanned without freckling and peeling.
There was something so magnetic and friendly about him that Kate's
weariness began to melt. She felt warmer and younger than following
Dora's revelation. Bob had enough of his mother's placidity to be
soothing as well as energetic.</p>

<p>"I want my appearance here to be secret. It would break the
Dad's heart to know I came here before going home."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, too much for human nature," she responded, kindling to
her usual kindliness, and with a smile that matched somewhat the
gladness in his. "Aren't you hungry? I could take you to the house
and smuggle a snack."</p>

<p>"Still the same old Kate! By George, it is spilling to see you."
They laughed at the old slang word. He looked her over with
remembrance from their youth and she eased and expanded when she
read in his eyes that he found her as good in her maturity as he
had done in her budding.</p>

<p>"Come and take a peep at Dora. We can see her without being
seen."</p>

<p>"I've been watching a young couple here having a fine time. What
about following a good example and welcoming a fellow home?"</p>

<p>"With that beard!"</p>

<p>"Show me where to shave?"</p>

<p>She led him to an aperture between some boughs and he balanced
her on the top rail of a sheep pen while he looked over her
shoulder, using her and a post as a shield. He held her carefully,
chastely, yet Kate could feel in the surrounding atmosphere that
her nearness was delightful to him, comforting and exhilarating to
her, so different from the repulsive liberties taken by the
clumsily, crudely amatory.</p>

<p>The quadrille ended. Bob chuckled with glee to recognise old
Slattery in the middle of the floor, mopping his brow on a large
coloured handkerchief. "Not a day older! and I used to think the
old geezer old a life-time ago."</p>

<p>"They have a habit of growing younger as we get old ourselves.
It's nice to have someone about my own age," she said, pressing his
arm.</p>

<p>"You! Why, bless me, you're a girl yet. You don't look a clay
over twenty-five." Kate felt retrieved from senescence at a stroke.
She could have accepted the comfort of Bob's arms without further
preliminaries, but various inhibitions and conventions rolled
between.</p>

<p>"Och, it's a hot toime of year fur a dance&mdash;and in this
shed," grunted Slattery. "The house would have been betther."</p>

<p>"The ball has been held in the shed and at this time of year by
special request, Mr. Slattery. The old folks got goose flesh in the
draughts last time."</p>

<p>"That's Ross," whispered Kate.</p>

<p>"By George, is it, the little nipper! He's grown out of sight,
and quite a dandy."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the real ladies' man."</p>

<p>"Shure, it stands to rayson 'twouldn't be the owld payple who
were discontinted. 'Twas the young, I'll bet ye, wanted the shed
for the corners and the turtledoving." There was loud laughter at
this, as at a witticism, led by Slattery himself. "An' none is
betther at that than yerself, young fellow."</p>

<p>The laugh was against Ross.</p>

<p>"Can ye no gie us a song?" inquired McTavish. "'Annie Laurie,'
or the C'auld, cauld blast.' Wouldn't a wee bittie be guid in this
heat. He! He! He!"</p>

<p>Half a dozen voices called upon Miss Barry. "Now you'll see
Dora," whispered Kate.</p>

<p>"So that was Dora! Can she sing?" inquired Bob with gathering
excitement. This was a delightful homecoming.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, quite nicely. She's taking lessons."</p>

<p>Ross led the girl forward amid general applause and evident
interest. Bob could not credit his eyes that this splendid, strange
young woman, gathering the roses of flattery on all sides, was his
own sister. Ross seated himself at the piano.</p>

<p>"So that's it, is it?" exclaimed Bob. "I'm learning lots of
things in a short time."</p>

<p>Dora sang "Whisper and I shall hear," and as encore, "Twickenham
Ferry." Then it was Ross's turn. He gave "Anchored" and "The
Bedouin's love song." Dora could not manage the accompaniment of
the latter, so to a Miss Chitters fell the triumph, but it was at
Dora that Ross looked over the piano as he chanted:</p>

<p class="poem">"Till the sun grows cold and the stars are old<br>
And the leaves of the Judgment Book un&mdash;fold.<br>
I love thee! I love but thee! With a love that<br>
shall not die&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>with the unabashed exuberance and intoxication of amour in full
crow. It disturbed the old no more than a passing breeze, but Tom
Harris endowed it with deadly importance. His temperature fell into
his boots. He felt driven to do something, even to rush forth and
drone "Sweet Belle Mahone." That would not have helped. Quite the
reverse. Amour is cruel if its vanity is touched. It has no mercy
for ridiculous deeds though they may manifest a nature
magnificently conditioned for the hum-drum wear and tear of the
marriage arena.</p>

<p>"By George! There's old Concertina Mick! Well, I never! and the
same pipe too, I do believe!"</p>

<p>Bob whispered that he must be off to forestall his father in
case of accident. Kate led him by a secluded way to supper and cool
drinks and shaving tackle.</p>

<p>"It's been so nice to see you. I hope this is not the last of
you, except at a distance," she said as she explained the changes
in the track to Bandicoot.</p>

<p>"No jolly fear! e bang over to see you tomorrow
afternoon&mdash;if you'll be awake. I'm not going to let the old
tow-row spoil things any longer. The Dad won't be able to keep set
against all of us. So long!"</p>

<p>He had been driven out of town, but now went off on a bicycle
with which he had provided himself for independent transport. Kate
stood watching his departure, a dark figure against the moonlight.
He looked back and caught the gleam of her white gown and felt that
his homecoming was a great success.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="poem">Soon as Time and the Wind began<br>
Or ever Life had fashioned Man,<br>
And thrust him pent upon this ball,<br>
Reckless of portent, careless of gain,<br>
Time made songs of dreams and deeds,<br>
Of softest whisper out the reeds,<br>
And the blithe Wind piped them all.<br>
All of laughter, all of pain,<br>
Dream of saint, or passion of brute,<br>
Only Time and the Wind remain&mdash;<br>
Time the player, the Wind his lute.</p>

<p>Mabel sat in the kitchen in the dark till nearly eleven and then
decided it would be safe to investigate. She crept through the
drawing-room, off which Dora's opened. The outside door was open,
the moonlight streamed through the window.. The bed was vacant.
There was every sign of where Dora had gone.</p>

<p>The girl was in danger as measured by tragic experience. Mabel
was dismayed. She must act, come what may. For a moment she
considered going after Dora herself, but her courage failed at the
prospect of breaking her long seclusion in such a dramatic manner.
She was forced to tell her father or to go to bed and feign
ignorance of Dora's actions. She was too conscientious, according
to her light, for the latter course. It was through her old fall
that Dora was driven to this subterfuge, she therefore owed it to
Dora at whatever sacrifice to save her from catastrophe.</p>

<p>She went to her parents' room with candle lit. The door was open
owing to the warm night. Her mother was sound asleep. She slept
like a child though it was one of her little pretensions of
feminine refinement to insist that she hardly slept at all. After
an hour's good snore, Barry's exhaustion had eased and his
perturbation of mind had wakened him. He lay there picturing his
enemy's success at his ball with the whole district gathered about
him to hear the announcement of the candidature, while all
Bandicoot success with woolgrowing was eclipsed, all its owner's
virtue with firebreaks unnoted&mdash;perhaps unnecessary.</p>

<p>There was Mabel at his side with a candle. She beckoned and
signed for quiet. He slipped out without disturbing his wife. Mabel
took his Sunday clothes off a peg and he picked up his boots and
socks. Safely in the kitchen Mabel confessed what had happened. She
shirked disclosing that she had any suspicions until going to
Dora's room for eau de cologne. Some cover was necessary for
survival. It was rather relieving than otherwise to the old warrior
simmering in perspiration and his own rancour. Now he could burst
into Lindsey's grand party and show up Ross's tactics. Temper is
more closely allied to lunacy than is pity to love.</p>

<p>He ordered Mabel to harness the horse to the sulky while he
dressed. In lieu of a telephone he always kept a horse handy at
night. He said no unnecessary word. His unusual quietness was
ominous to Mabel, Nor did he question Dora's whereabouts. He
insisted upon something to eat and then was ready.</p>

<p>"Don't disturb your mother till necessary," he cautioned. He had
an idea that his wife might enjoy Dora's defiance and with a word
reduce the proportions of the drama he was bent on enacting. On dit
that all women of feminine capability dramatise their lives. Men
are inclined to melodramatise women's lives with sentimentality,
but Dad Barry insisted upon bellow-dramatising his existence, and
the inconvenience to his women folk be blasted!</p>

<p>Mabel did not dare plead with him to conduct the rescue quietly.
She had surrendered such privileges long ago. When he had gone she
made a fire under the fountain, as she was shivering in spite of
the time of year.</p>

<p>Dora's escapade would bring things to such a climax that her own
days at Bandicoot were probably numbered. She would come in for all
the blame again, and her old disgrace very likely be disclosed to
Dora. She wound accept Mick's overtures and with him and Arthur
retreat to some new district and begin her own life. It couldn't be
more cruel to her whatever Mick might turn out, and when she was
gone life could be arranged with more liveliness for Dora.</p>

<p>All fell silent around the homestead again. The dogs settled
down and the cry of the woke-pokes could be heard in the peppermint
trees around the cow-yard.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="poem">Why such rage, Old Man? Why such rage?<br>
The young command a different wage,<br>
Alignments new to meet their age,<br>
And whether you be dunce or sage,<br>
'Tis you, Old Man, must change your gauge.</p>

<p>When Kate returned to the shed a barn dance was in progress, the
music being supplied by Mick Bell, who had been hoisted on to the
wool table. Mick was asked to add a polka or schottische, but he
took his pipe from his mouth and drawled: "I must fust see what a
bit of fire up the crik means. I've been watchin' it. It mightn't
be much, but then again with all this grass and if the wind rose,
it might."</p>

<p>The graziers melted away to inspect the fire. It was visible to
few besides Concertina, a tiny glint on a far horizon. The members
of Parliament and other elders clustered around Dora, as
enthusiastic about her singing as if she were a prima donna. The
wine of success mounted to Dora's inexperienced head. It was a
repetition of her appearance at the bazaar. She outshone all the
other girls, everybody was so hearty and fraternal, yet her father
kept her shut up because of extraordinary notions.</p>

<p>A later moment brought disillusion. She moved away behind a post
to escape Tom Harris, whom she saw steering towards her. While she
was in hiding, Mrs. Blackett, making herself agreeable to Mr.
Slattery, an important supporter, descanted upon the charm of the
old accordion music.</p>

<p>"And that gentleman who plays so well, is he a resident of the
district?"</p>

<p>"Divvil a jintleman, he's a selector up the creek here. He does
a good deal of work for owld Blastus on Bandicoot, that is the
feyther of the girl who was singing. Her owld sister made a mess of
it some years ago wid a Lindsey, and that's how the row began that
we're all thryin' to patch up. I'm hearing now that the owld man is
thryin' to ketch the accordion player for the said sister. Shure I
hope he succeeds. Maybe we could dispose of the botheration if she
was settled."</p>

<p>"And the young people, do you think they are serious?"</p>

<p>"You mean the red-headed wan and young Ross? Sure if she knew
enough to hang on, but shure there's room in his heart for more
than wan. He makes up to Rose Ann, but she has been too well-rared
to flout her religion."</p>

<p>Mrs. Blackett murmured understandingly. Dora fled incontinently,
her cheeks flaming, her blood drumming in her ears. Red-head
indeed! The Sydney lady with the Chitters simply raved about it as
Titian.</p>

<p>If left to herself she would be among the elite but she was
dragged down to the level of that old Concertina with his stale
pipe and jungle beard, by her father and that stupid Mabel who
roosted at home for ever like an owl! And Ross&mdash;not in
earnest! He had to be polite to that great galumphing Rose Ann; and
her old potato hogtrotting father thought it was Rose Ann's
religion held her back, when it was her big feet, and her long dull
face. Dora could see Jean McTavish in the distance fawning upon
Ross.</p>

<p>She would test it. She would let Tom and Ross propose to her
completely and accept them both. When asked why she did such a
thing she would be as cool as a cucumber and say she never dreamt
that they were in earnest. She would so entirely reverse this
business of Mabel mooning like a hermit because Sid Lindsey had
changed his mind about her, that that indignity would be dispersed.
As a beginning she would stay in the wool bale corner and see if
Ross missed her.</p>

<p>"What's this the noo? Fire did ye say?"</p>

<p>"It's likely to be in moi direction," said Slattery. "And in
mine. Wi' grass like a hay field a sough of wind would send it to
Kingdom come."</p>

<p>"Owld Blastus has been roarin' around the country this month
past about trailin' finces and ploughing firebreaks around the
stacks and houses."</p>

<p>"Awld Blastus aye knows what he is talkin' aboot when it is
practical matters."</p>

<p>They moved off among others to discover what substance was in
the rumour of fire.</p>

<p>Dora did not have long to wait in her retreat, till Ross, taking
advantage of the interest in the fire, came eagerly seeking her. He
was for kisses again, but found a changed Dora.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, darling?" he inquired, her distance making
him sure in his predilection. "Are you tired?"</p>

<p>"Tired! There's been nothing to make me tired, but I want you to
take me home at once. It doesn't seem to me to be very dignified to
be here secretly. It may disturb your mother, and she is such a
darling, and so frail that I'd hate to worry her."</p>

<p>"There's not many can come up to the Mater," agreed Ross. "I can
get away as soon as supper is well started."</p>

<p>"You must remember I have to face Father, and that awful old
Concertina will bake my cake."</p>

<p>"But you'll have me to face things with you now. Do let's be
publicly engaged."</p>

<p>"But I want to go to Queensland with Bob."</p>

<p>"Queensland is not off the earth. I could soon get you from
there."</p>

<p>Dora was walking towards the crowd who were discussing the
possibilities of fire.</p>

<p>"It's all right so long as the wind doesn't rise," said Tom
Harris, who though no Chesterfield was an excellent bushman.</p>

<p>"But the wind will be high as soon as the moon sets," said
Concertina, looking at the sky.</p>

<p>"A fire could only run down into the river there," said Lindsey
Sr.</p>

<p>"Too far to the left."</p>

<p>"Someone has been trailing and let it get away."</p>

<p>"Or a tramp has left a fire."</p>

<p>"Father has everything safe about Bandicoot," announced
Dora.</p>

<p>"Ay, I knew it. If he was here he'd tell us," said McTavish.</p>

<p>"Let us get away to supper," said Lindsey, "and by that time
we'll know whether there's a fire or not."</p>

<p>Mrs. Judson went with her mother and Mrs. Blackett, her father
driving. Ross and Kate stayed with the other guests of importance
and years who were to make successive loads.</p>

<p>"I'm off to see the fire," said Mick Bell. "You better come too.
It's in your direction as well as mine."</p>

<p>Tom consented and they disappeared together, Lindsey Sr. had
just departed with the second earful of guests when the others were
electrified by the appearance of Barry with a buggy-whip in his
hand. Bob had taken the bridle track and had missed him on the
way.</p>

<p>"Hussy! Is this where I find you? I'd sooner see you in your
coffin!" He went straight to Dora, oblivious of making an
exhibition of himself. He would have laid the whip about the girl
but for Ross's intervention. He seized the handle and the two men
confronted each other, the elder determined to strike, the younger
desirous of protecting himself without undue violence.</p>

<p>"Father! Father! Please stop. It is all my fault," said Dora,
clutching his arm.</p>

<p>Kate also hurried forward. "Mr. Barry, no harm has been
done&mdash;just a little dance among the neighbours.</p>

<p>"You brazen harlot!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Barry, you forget yourself."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it enough to make Mabel like yourself, without working
for the downfall of this child?"</p>

<p>"Haud on mon, ye're oot o' yersel'!"</p>

<p>"And who are you, you old jew lizard, to interfere between a man
and his family?"</p>

<p>"Havers mon! There's no harrum done."</p>

<p>"Shure the choild has been but here in full view of the neeburs
all night."</p>

<p>"Please God, I've found her in time. If I haven't, I'll shoot
you like a snake, Ross Lindsey. That's what you are&mdash;a snake!
I took you into my home, and this is the reward I get&mdash;you
blasted viper!"</p>

<p>"No man shall speak to me like that!"</p>

<p>"Who are you to tell your superiors how to speak, you flash
pup." Barry rushed at Ross with the freed whip. Dora sprang
between.</p>

<p>"Run away till he cools down," she said, aside.</p>

<p>"Yes, lave this to us," said Slattery.</p>

<p>"Shure Barry, ye're mad. Mad as an owld hat."</p>

<p>"Aye, an' there's weightier matters the nicht."</p>

<p>"I know what are weighty matters to me, and will allow no man to
dictate to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Barry, do listen," pleaded Kate.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you shameless slut with your bosom
exposed."</p>

<p>"Oh, Father, don't say such terrible things."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue too&mdash;you with your neck bare like a loud
woman," he bellowed, throwing Dora violently to the floor. Slattery
and Kate picked her up while Ross held on to the excited old
man.</p>

<p>"Muster Barry, yell bust a blood vessel."</p>

<p>"Ye're out of ye're moind, Bill Barry. It's unseemly among
neeburs."</p>

<p>"Auch aye, 'tis all that noo. Your dochter will never come to
harrum wi' us, Muster Barry."</p>

<p>"Shure do ye quischin our rayspictability? The district has put
up with these exhibitions too long."</p>

<p>Barry dropped the buggy-whip, wrenched free from Ross and made a
rush at Slattery. "I want my daughter in my own home, and I'll
shoot any man that helps to entice her out of it."</p>

<p>"Hoots mon, ye're haverin'. Some amang us hae been decidin' the
nicht that you..."</p>

<p>"You've been deciding&mdash;you!" said Barry with crushing
scorn.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bill Barry, some of the neeburs have come to the
conclusion that this lunacy..."</p>

<p>"When it comes to lunacy, you old bogtrotter..."</p>

<p>"That hardly becomes you, Muster Barry."</p>

<p>"And you, you old jew lizard with your frill."</p>

<p>"Some of the most important people in the district," valiantly
proceeded Slattery, and not without dignity, "have come to the
conclusion that ye'r capers are an obsthruction of the public amity
and..."</p>

<p>"You'd talk to me like that, would you?"</p>

<p>"Let him alone till he comes to. He doesn't know what he is
saying," advised Kate in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Hoots! It's no safe for a mon to approach him. Let him bide wi'
the petticoats till he comes to."</p>

<p>"Father, come on home."</p>

<p>"Bill Barry, ye're loike a mad dog, and only I know ye're no
dhrinker...</p>

<p>"You know, you!"</p>

<p>"Come on, Father, come home."</p>

<p>"Nearly time," he yelled with a shove that sent her reeling.
"Another word out of you and I'll flay you on foot all the way to
Bandicoot."</p>

<p>"We'll lave ye to the faymales, ye owld mad bull," said
Slattery, his ire at last aroused. McTavish had had enough. He
edged away.</p>

<p>Slattery glared and Barry glared. It was a glowering match.</p>

<p>"You would, would you! You old&mdash;old&mdash;you Irish
potato!"</p>

<p>"Potato ye'rself, ye owld&mdash;owld&mdash;ye ugly owld
bald-headed Australian goanna."</p>

<p>Dora made off in the hope of finding her father's sulky and
ending the humiliating scenes. Her father followed. Ross and Kate
pursued Barry. Dora got into the sulky. Her father unhitched the
horse. Ross attempted to say good night but Barry bashed at him
with a sheep-pen slat and Ross sprang out of the way.</p>

<p>"Kate, come with me," he pleaded. "I can't let the poor little
kid in for such an unholy row without doing something. The old
lunatic will beat her and shut her up. I might as well face it out
now as later. He shan't be able to say I'm acting like Sid. I
proposed to Dora to-night and she as good as said yes. If I
announce that to the old roarer it puts his evil suspicions out of
court."</p>

<p>Kate thought it wiser to allow the old man time to cool,
particularly in light of her knowledge that Bob was on the scene.
But she had promised her mother to go with Dora, and knowledge of
the full force of this eruption must be kept from her, at least for
to-night while she was undergoing the unusual exertion of the
entertainment. The thought of seeing Bob handle this emergency also
took from the ordeal and added to the interest of getting to
Bandicoot that night. She consented. She had however to go to the
house for a cloak. She merely whispered to her mother that she and
Ross were off to Bandicoot, taking a bit of supper to eat on the
way. She left her father and Georgina Judson in charge. These
delays gave Barry a good start.</p>

<p>The ball was over in any case, and the supper hurried and
disturbed by anxiety. The wind was dropping downwards from the high
heavens. Already an occasional whisper could be heard in a lifted
leaf. There was confusion in the darkness of the departing moon's
great shadows of trees and rocks and ranges. Men whistled or
dropped an oath, the sound of vehicles and hoofs was everywhere.
Folks wanted to be home in case of danger, the possibilities of
which the skilled would not minimise.</p>

<p>Concertina and Tom Harris had been the stormy petrels. The fire
could be plainly seen now. From the size of a lamp it had grown to
be a bonfire on the rim with a hint of much volume on the other
side of the spur. If only the wind would not whisper, but it
continued and grew louder in the gullies and foothills of the
ranges back of Chesham Park and gained volume for its onward sweep
across Canberra Plains.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="poem">Down the road beside the river,<br>
There the phantom stations lie,<br>
Where the sunlight seems to quiver,<br>
And the gum trees touch the sky.<br>
<br>
There the old folks wrought a clearing<br>
'Mid the trees so grand and tall,<br>
Nothing doubting, nothing fearing,<br>
Asking nought and giving all.<br>
<br>
But a generation passes;<br>
Days of old come not again;<br>
Graves lie deep in seeding grasses;<br>
New folks buy the hill and plain,<br>
<br>
And the old folks soundly sleeping,<br>
Now alone in mem'ry 'bide,<br>
Ghostly watches softly keeping<br>
O'er loved road and riverside..<br>
<br>
Down the road beside the rivers,<br>
There the old-time stations lay,<br>
Where the burning sunlight quivers,<br>
In that lone land far away.</p>

<p>The shadows from the west were blacking out the wide white
moonlight as Bob Barry ran up to the old place, straining his eyes
to recognise remembered contours. He dismounted softly, laid his
machine against the palings of the backyard and stood looking about
him ere raising the hasp of the gates. Everrything slept. No, there
was a light in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mabel was there, with a little fire of coals, and her water
fountain on the boil, as her father would he sure to demand tea
upon his return. To pass the trying wait, she had brought out the
big tray of silver trophies and polished them, and now was engaged
on a basket of mending.</p>

<p>Every now and again she strained to listen, fancying she heard
something, but it was only a moke-poke calling to his mate.</p>

<p>"Moke-poke! Moke-poke! Moke-poke! Moke-poke!" or the willy-wags
twittering: "A little stick to beat her! A little stick to beat
her!"</p>

<p>Bob opened the gates and quietly entered. He knew his way about
here. Nothing was changed, whereas at Chesham Park, so far as he
could discern in the moonlight, it was an entirely new place.</p>

<p>Mabel heard his step and knew it was not her father, coming so
quietly without the dogs barking or any sound of hoof or wheel. It
might be Mick. Bob knocked on the door. It was firmly pegged.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"It that you, Mabel?"</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Bob. Don't be frightened. Straight wire, it's me."</p>

<p>She opened the door in some trepidation and stood well back
while he entered. "Are you really Bob?"</p>

<p>"As sure as eggs are eggs."</p>

<p>"You are very changed."</p>

<p>"You bet your sweet life I am&mdash;from a hobbledehoy into an
old man."</p>

<p>"I don't remember you."</p>

<p>"Ask me any test questions you like. Perhaps you remember my
lumpy nail. Someone else did today."</p>

<p>"Oh yes. I do remember it now, and there is a resemblance to
Father. How did you come?"</p>

<p>"I biked it from the turn-off."</p>

<p>She made no advances. She did not seem to know what to do. Bob
kissed her kindly on the cheek. "You'd better sit down," she said,
setting a chair.</p>

<p>"How is Mother these days?"</p>

<p>"She says she doesn't sleep, but she does."</p>

<p>"And how are you&mdash;a bit thin on it."</p>

<p>"I'm all right."</p>

<p>Embarrassment silenced them. Bob looked around the old kitchen
with the indulgence and delight of one who returns after long years
of homesickness. It was a wide room of adzed slabs, papered with
pictures from the Sydney Mail and Town and Country Journal, and
such publications. He fondly regarded the dresser of rough timber
reaching from floor to ceiling, decorated with newspaper valances
cut in peaks, a different pattern to each shelf. He missed nothing,
from the big colonial oven in one corner of the mighty white
hearth, to the great meat dishes, and the graduated row of metal
dish covers gleaming on another wall. Everything gleamed,
advertising vigilant housewifery and no sparing of elbow grease. On
the opposite wall above the door was a well-known picture of Queen
Victoria with an order on her bosom, and similar pictures of King
Edward and Queen Alexandra. These had appeared as coloured
supplements to The Town and Country Journal. They were contained in
home-made frames of peach and apricot stones, glued on boards and
varnished.</p>

<p>"By George! I'm glad to see everything just the same, and
shining like gold. If you knew how often I've longed for a squint
at this old kitchen, and here it is at last. Oh, a happy New Year,
Mabel, old girl." He patted her on the shoulder and went to the
trophies. "This looks like a jeweller's window."</p>

<p>"Father's champion cups."</p>

<p>Bob read an inscription: "'Champion two-year-old Ewe.' Does he
still call it yeo?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Dora tries to change him, but it's not much use."</p>

<p>"He's all right as he is, bless him," chuckled Bob, picking up
the smallest cup. "'Champion hogget in class...'"</p>

<p>"That's his pet. He got it away from Lindsey the only time he
had a chance of winning."</p>

<p>Bob let this pass. His glances wandered happily around the old
room again. "By George, there's the old boiler where you used to
plant the cake. Many a raid I've made on it and was threatened with
tally-whack. Is there anything in it these days?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I-made a New Year cake. You must be hungry. I'm
getting something ready for Father. I'm expecting him any
minute."</p>

<p>"How does he happen to be out so late?"</p>

<p>It was relieving to Mabel's tension to speak. "Oh, Bob, you've
fallen in for a big row. There's a shivoo to-night at Chesham
Park&mdash;as they call it since they built the new house&mdash;and
Dora sneaked off to it with Ross Lindsey."</p>

<p>"So that's what young Ross has come to."</p>

<p>"Yes. He's a towney sort of chap, a bit flash with horses and
riding togs, and as Dora can ride anything, that's the
attraction."</p>

<p>"You think the Dad will cut-up rough about it?"</p>

<p>"You won't be able to hear your ears."</p>

<p>"Oh well, if there a dust-up, it will show if young Ross means
business."</p>

<p>"He means business all right, but I don't know what sort."</p>

<p>"It's about this whole business with the Lindseys that I've come
home. I thought the young people mightn't be getting a fair show,
and it's time the old scrimmage was turned out to grass."</p>

<p>He seated himself astride a chair, filling his pipe and lighting
it, then rested his arms comfortably. "I believe I made this old
chair myself! By gum, it's dinkum to find the old place the same.
Everything else but the ranges in the whole blooming district is so
changed."</p>

<p>Mabel offered him a cool drink of honey mead. "You don't mean we
should have anything to do with the Lindseys?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You don't countenance dishonesty, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life. But don't spend your life in a peltering rage
because some other fellow is not as honest as you think you are or
he ought to be."</p>

<p>"But old Lindsey is an out-and-outer."</p>

<p>"He's an infant unborn compared with most smart business men who
get on, and a lot of it is only in the Dad's bile."</p>

<p>"I never thought I'd hear you talking lightly of
dishonesty."</p>

<p>"I don't...But look at the Dad. Not an honester or cleverer old
geezer in the world. I had to go away from home to get the full
measure of him. Yet he spoiled all our lives because he once found
Lindsey making off with a few head of Bandicoot cattle."</p>

<p>"But that sort of thing goes on all the time still."</p>

<p>"Well now, I have a story I want to tell you...It bears on all
this...When Bill and I took up land in Queensland we had next to us
a fellow from England&mdash;any amount of capital but didn't know B
from bull's foot about working the land. Bill and I weren't reared
by the Dad for nothing, and all the time we could spare, this
fellow had us on his place...Well, I found him one day out on our
run making off with a good little lot of our sheep. His excuse
would have looked pretty drought-stricken on paper&mdash;about as
good as Lindsey's famous snake yarn that he found the Dad's stock
straying and was bringing them home&mdash;in the opposite
direction. Dad ought to have accepted that yarn...but to get on
with my own...By this time Bill was dead snooks on the chap's
sister."</p>

<p>"He soon forgot Georgina Lindsey."</p>

<p>"That's another thing. Some are born to remember and others to
forget, and there's nothing gained by jawing about it either way.
Luckily I was struck by the parallel to our case here and didn't
raise a rumpus, and the upshot was that the chap took us into
partnership. We should never have got on at the rate we did without
his backing."</p>

<p>"He has gone straight since then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We keep him up to it, and Bill has a fine wife and kiddies
and we've never looked back. Well now, I come back to Queanbeyan,
and was mooching about there waiting for the coach and I heard a
lot."</p>

<p>"Didn't they know you?"</p>

<p>"I had a beard this morning."</p>

<p>"Well, I never!"</p>

<p>"There was a great deal of talk about Lindsey&mdash;about his
motor car and his prominence in getting this low level bridge, and
some of them say he is sure to be our next member of
Parliament."</p>

<p>"You should have heard how Father went on about that."</p>

<p>"Lindsey is a rising man all the time. I asked about the Dad
when I saw they didn't know me, and it was readily admitted that
he's the smartest all-round man on the land; but they talk about
his language and his bad temper. He's only 'old Blastus,' but it's
Mister Lindsey. People would rather have a pleasant-mannered man
who's not an apostle for principle, than St. Peter bellowing at
them."</p>

<p>"It's easy to be popular."</p>

<p>"It's easier to be unpopular if you don't take care&mdash;and
it's not nearly such good business. Not a man said that the family
row was because Lindsey was a sheep duffer, but because 'old
Blastus' had a daughter go a mucker with one of the Lindsey boys
years ago, and he'll never let it rest...They might have let it die
down if Father had acted sensibly. He'll make another noise
to-night, and it'll be great sport for all the pub loafers...How
did he find out?"</p>

<p>Mabel felt desperate. "I told him," she faltered. "Well, it was
Mick Bell told me. He saw them meeting at Dingo Creek. It looked as
if they were not content with one of us being ruined."</p>

<p>"Mabel! Tsst! Tsst! How could you think the Lindseys such fools
as to want another mess. Why on earth didn't you stop the kiddy
before she went?"</p>

<p>"I didn't believe she'd really dare go till I found her
gone."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you follow her yourself&mdash;quietly,
decently?"</p>

<p>"I've never set foot off Bandicoot&mdash;not since...I could no
more go out where they'd all be glaring at me than..."</p>

<p>"I see. Poor old girl! Never mind...Does the kiddy give you any
reason to think she's like...that she's that sort of girl?"</p>

<p>"You mean the same sort of girl as I am."</p>

<p>"No. No. I mean what has she grown up like?"</p>

<p>"She's very petted by Father, by everyone&mdash;coming so long
after us all. She's wilful and fiery like Father himself. He spoils
her one minute and has a shindy with her the next, but she can hold
her own with him. What he says doesn't upset her for long, and then
she wheedles him." Mabel moved from one object to another without
purpose. "You don't think I should have sent Father, but Bob, I was
nearly off my head with worry about her. I'd die to save her from
what I've been through. She was such a dear brave little thing when
she used to play with Arthur. She used to ask me why I cried so
much." Mabel broke down piteously, the first emotion she had let
anyone see in her for years.</p>

<p>"Never mind, you did your best, and we must stand the gaff now.
Poor old girl, tell me what your own life has been all these
years."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. I've just kept on working and working. I'm always
afraid I spoiled things for poor little Dora, so I try to make home
easy for her."</p>

<p>He noticed her careworn look and her knotted, work-roughened
hands with a pang. It suddenly brought home Mabel's side of the
case to him. "I expect you made it too easy for them all, and no
one thought about making it better for you."</p>

<p>"And Bob, when you ask if Dora is inclined to be my sort of a
girl..."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mabel, don't take me up so short. I didn't mean..."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean; but I wasn't 'that sort of girl' till it
happened. I was more thunderstruck than the rest of you. I'm not
that sort of woman, though it may seem like it."</p>

<p>"I know. I think the world is too hard on that kind of
a&mdash;an accident. But we can't make the world over again; we can
only take it as it comes."</p>

<p>"It comes as unjust as a bush fire."</p>

<p>"We were brutes not to think of it from your point of view, but
only from the disgrace; and you've stuck it like a trojan."</p>

<p>"I can't stand it much longer."</p>

<p>"Is there any truth in this about Mick Bell?"</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that he's sneaking around after you."</p>

<p>"He comes before everyone; he doesn't sneak to places at night
like Ross Lindsey."</p>

<p>"Sorry I said the wrong thing again. I only meant that I heard
he was giving you some attention. It would be easy to do worse.
He's as steady as a church. No hanging around pubs or race courses
for Concertina. Sort of old chap to have a tidy nest-egg."</p>

<p>"If he suits me it oughtn't to matter to the rest of you, so
long as you need never see me again."</p>

<p>"So you really mean to make a go of it?"</p>

<p>"Don't say anything to the others yet. I want to go dairying
down about Wollongong or in Gippsland."</p>

<p>"Better stick to wool. You can sit down while the sheep are
growing it&mdash;that suits me all to pieces; but this dairying is
continual slavery."</p>

<p>"I'm used to that. I want to get away where I can mind my own
business and let other people mind theirs. I'm sick of hints of it
all everlastingly, and Father for ever roaring in my ears about
what I've done or not done. I'm dead sick of Bandicoot."</p>

<p>"Little wonder. This jumping down people's throats is a mistake.
But there's a better-idea than kicking over the traces altogether.
Come away to Queensland with me for a year. You've stuck in this
groove too long."</p>

<p>"I couldn't gad about&mdash;and there's Arthur."</p>

<p>"Bring him with you. They'd take him for my young brother
honestly up there."</p>

<p>Mabel was so touched by this that she sat by the table and bent
her head on her arms. "Dora doesn't know yet," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I reckon she's the only being in the district doesn't and it
will soon be flung at Arthur when he gets among men."</p>

<p>"It's been thrown at him already. That's why I want to get him
away."</p>

<p>"How's he shaping?"</p>

<p>"Big for his age, and works better than a man."</p>

<p>"The Dad would see to that...Any wages?"</p>

<p>"No. Father believes in visiting the sins of the mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, things are going to change." Bob had a comfortable
belief in his own powers of dispensation.</p>

<p>"You never married," Mabel presently remarked. "Kate Lindsey was
asking after you."</p>

<p>"I used to think a lot of Kate. How is she these days?"</p>

<p>"Much the same. She wears well. Takes good care of herself."</p>

<p>"I've never seen a finer-looking girl anywhere."</p>

<p>"She's like a towney. Likes to stick on the jam. Has her dresses
made by the dressmaker."</p>

<p>"She's none the worse for that. If a woman can run her house and
looks well, it's a great help to a man."</p>

<p>"The Lindseys have got up among the tip-top swells."</p>

<p>"That's where the Dad could be too if he acted sensibly. I bet
he has a sounder property than Chesham, and his pedigree is as
good, or better."</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="poem">They demanded beauty&mdash;<br>
That was youth&mdash;<br>
To give thanks and testify<br>
Of love with courage high,<br>
That seemed all of duty,<br>
And the truth.</p>

<p>While Bob was talking to Mabel, Dad Barry was running swiftly
towards them, Dora, hatless and without any wrap over her light
dress, sitting very straight beside him. It was a warm night, and
in any case she was too excited to feel cold. That she had
carefully turned up her skirts to preserve her new dress indicated
that she was unafraid of her father and unconvicted of sin in her
dire insubordination. Old Barry was beyond speech. He drove
furiously, bottling his denunciations till he reached home. Dora
was likewise hardening her resentment and determination. No thought
of surrender weakened her. She was so angry with her father for the
humiliating exhibition to which she had been subjected that she was
contemplating her packing to set out to Queensland.</p>

<p>Ross and Kate, equally silently and swiftly pursued Dora and
Dad. Bullocky Bill, sent to mobilise Barry, and those not on the
telephone, followed Kate and Ross, for the wind had reached down
from on high and was disturbing the grasses like the waves of the
sea over those open undulating square miles where the wilful new
city gleams to-day.</p>

<p>"They're here," said Mabel, who had been painfully on the qui
vive. Swiftly upon her words Dora entered with spirited mien
followed by Father with portentous attitude as about to wrestle
with unrighteousness.</p>

<p>"Father, Bob has come home," announced Mabel, in an effort to
divert too loud a crash.</p>

<p>"Bob! Never! God bless me soul, me boy! Where did you spring
from? Let me look at you. Man alive, this is a pleasant
surprise."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Father. I should have known you anywhere."</p>

<p>"Let me see...fifteen years last October."</p>

<p>"Seventeen years this May," corrected Mabel. "Why didn't you
send word and let us meet you properly?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to save Mabel and Mother any fuss about
preparations."</p>

<p>"Man alive, this will be great for your mother! Run and wake
her, Mabel."</p>

<p>"Don't disturb Mother whatever you do."</p>

<p>Dora had been looking at him critically and now ran to him,
clasping her arms about his neck and sobbing with excitement: "Bob,
why didn't you come to the ball and save me from..."</p>

<p>Father sat down ponderously and a trifle pompously.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Bob, that your homecoming after all these years
should happen on such a night. My grey hairs are being shamed a
second time. In spite of all my efforts to save her she seems bent
on going the same way as Mabel. Good God, it must be in them,
though they didn't get that sort of thing from me."</p>

<p>Bob noted that Mabel cowered as if struck, and was smitten with
renewed regret to remember how indifferent they all had been to
Mabel's sufferings. He hastened to interpose. "Well, Father, I've
done some thinking since last we met, and it seems to me that what
is in Mabel is to be the best housekeeper and hardest worker I have
ever seen."</p>

<p>"Bob, I'm going away with you to Queensland. Father rushed in
like the old Hereford bull when he's mad, and disgraced me so that
I never want to show my face around Bandicoot again."</p>

<p>"That's just what I want, some girls to go back to Queensland
with me. Mabel must come first."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, take me first. Father is not always picking at Mabel
like he is at me. I can't stand it any longer."</p>

<p>"Well, well, well,". said Bob cheerfully. "Who's going to speak
first?"</p>

<p>Mabel busied herself with the fountain and cupboard. Dora and
her father spoke excitedly and mostly in duet. The old man was sure
of Bob's support. As a lad he had been solidly behind his father in
the Sid Lindsey disaster.</p>

<p>"My boy, I grieve to welcome you home to this."</p>

<p>"You've just come at the right time to save me."</p>

<p>"I've been to Lindsey's and found Dora at a dance where she went
with young Lindsey, as Sneaking a viper as ever his father was. I
took him in here and me and your mother nursed him back to life
when he fell with a dunkey so badly bred..."</p>

<p>"Father came roaring over to Chesham Park."</p>

<p>"Chesham Park!"</p>

<p>"With a buggy-whip as if I were a slave in a harem."</p>

<p>"That's what you will be if you go the ways of harlotry."</p>

<p>"He called me dreadful bad names before everyone and tried to
thrash people with his whip as if he was drunk."</p>

<p>"I pray God I was not too late. By God if I was..."</p>

<p>"Why should he say such fearful things about me as if, as if,
oh, as if I was something terrible?"</p>

<p>"Well, well now, we must sort this out," said Bob. Mabel
proceeded with her preparations. The clock on the mantel struck
one. The moke-pokes out of doors resumed their calling.</p>

<p>"Ross Lindsey has never been anything but a gentleman to me.
He's the only young man within twenty miles of Bandicoot who knows
how to behave."</p>

<p>"Gentleman!...Hold your tongue while I speak."</p>

<p>"I won't! You're not fair."</p>

<p>"I found her jumping about in a half-naked dress with young
Lindsey. What sort of self-respect is it to go where she's not
wanted with a scut who is bent on ruining her?"</p>

<p>"Take me away, Bob. I never want to see Father again as long as
I live."</p>

<p>"Tsst! Tsst! Tsst! Strong words for a little tummy. Let us all
keep our hair on. Father, what reason have you to think that Ross
Lindsey was offering Dora insult?"</p>

<p>"Insult! My daughter sneaked out of her bed to go to an enemy.
It was an insult for him to take her there."</p>

<p>"How has Ross treated you, Dora? He has me to reckon with as
well as Father if..."</p>

<p>"He has asked me to be engaged to him. If you think that an
insult&mdash;Father himself is married&mdash;at least I've always
supposed him to be."</p>

<p>"That'll show you the kind of mind she has on serious subjects,"
said Father, scandalised.</p>

<p>"Well," said Dora, who from solid training was able to take care
of herself in these storms, "if you are married, as I've always
been led to believe, you must have proposed to Mother first. That's
how Ross Lindsey has insulted me&mdash;by proposing."</p>

<p>"Girls that are led astray are always promised marriage. What
guarantee have I that it isn't a case of Sid?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Father. We'll leave that out of it," said Bob,
wincing on Mabel's behalf.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see the man who could lead me astray," said Dora
contemptuously. "He'd have to be lots more wonderful than any I've
seen so far."</p>

<p>"Ross has shown good taste to propose to you. What do you think
about it, little sis?"</p>

<p>"Think about it-with that son of a viper."</p>

<p>"Suppose we hear what Dora says."</p>

<p>"Ross is good fun, and it's a relief to see someone with nice
manners, but how could I think about him either way with Father
disgracing me and threatening murder."</p>

<p>"Saving you from disgrace, no matter what anyone thinks."</p>

<p>"If Ross wants to marry her, that's no disgrace. I don't suppose
there's a girl within twenty miles who wouldn't think him a
catch."</p>

<p>"Catch be damned&mdash;catch in a dingo trap. He's as flash as a
new concertina with his Chesham Park and motor car and&mdash;and
goggles, but they're mortgaged up to the ears."</p>

<p>"Ross at least knows how to behave and not make a fool of
himself every time he opens his mouth with bad grammar and a beard
and bowyangs."</p>

<p>Father turned to Bob. "Old Lindsey is the same man he always
was. Only three weeks ago I went across to Yass to the sales: and
it's always well to keep an eye on any lot that Lindsey is putting
up. I spotted a sheep with old McTavish's brand botched up, but as
soon as Lindsey knew I was on the scene the sheep mysteriously
disappeared."</p>

<p>"Aw, I bet old Mac knows all about it and finds a sheep or two
worth it to be in with Lindsey. Let him mind his own duck
house."</p>

<p>"That sort of thing goes on all the time."</p>

<p>"Then the only way to keep our flocks intact would be to get old
Lindsey in the family," smiled Bob.</p>

<p>"What does Father mean about going the same way as Mabel, and
that it must be in me? What must be in me? I'm sure I don't run
after a hideous old pipe-sucking noodle who goes about in bowyangs
and sits on his hunkers like an orang outang." Dora seethed over in
another direction.</p>

<p>"What's this about?" inquired Bob.</p>

<p>"That old Mick Bell. He's called Concertina, that will show what
people think of him."</p>

<p>"People think a great deal more of him than they do of the
Lindseys," maintained Father, halted by this flank attack.</p>

<p>"Rubbish! An old working man that they put in the kitchen to
eat. And I heard them saying to-night that you are trying to catch
him for Mabel. That shows their respect for us in connection with
him."</p>

<p>"If you heard nothing worse, you have little to complain of,"
said Father, rather inconsequently.</p>

<p>"You are awfully angry when I associate with Ross Lindsey and
the aristocrats. You must have a queer taste for men. Concertina
for Mabel, and that gawping idiot of a Tom Harris for me&mdash;or
better still, One-eyed Sam the rabbitter."</p>

<p>"You're beside yourself! Mick Bell is as fine and honest a man
as we've got in the district, and he'll have a comfortable home
when some of the flash windbags are sold up by the bailiffs."</p>

<p>"A beard like a gorilla," interjected Dora.</p>

<p>"Mick's beard is as the Almighty made it," gasped Father,
plucking at his own.</p>

<p>"Then I don't think much of the Almighty." Dora was merely
baiting her father now. She had recovered her spirits. She produced
the expected roar. "Don't let me hear you blaspheme."</p>

<p>"I think it's blasphemy to blame the Almighty for beards. If he
had anything to do with them and is omnipotent, he'd surely have
put more of them on the top of men's heads and not have such a
frowsy mess around their mouths and under their chins."</p>

<p>"Silence! I won't have this blasphemy against the Almighty."</p>

<p>"It's against beards.. You're not fair in keeping to the
point."</p>

<p>"A little disrespect to beards isn't any harm," said Bob,
smothering a smile. "They're a darned nuisance. If a man isn't
always scraping at himself like a pig, he becomes a frowsy old
bison."</p>

<p>"The sacred, sweet,
pipe-sucking-orang-outang-bearded-bowyanged-Concertina-Mick was at
the ball to-night, as large as life."</p>

<p>"We're all born, but we're not all buried yet," remarked Mabel
as she went from kitchen to pantry.</p>

<p>"Mick comes here trying to curry favour with Father by
everlastingly saying snaky things against the Lindseys, yet he was
there."</p>

<p>"Mick knows what he is doing, you don't," said Father, a little
taken back by this defection on Mick's part.</p>

<p>At this moment Ross Lindsey knocked on the door, and Bob,
opening it said: "Come in."</p>

<p>Ross stepped into the light of the kerosene lamp. "Excuse me,
Mr. Barry," he began.</p>

<p>"To what do I owe this intrusion?" inquired Father, grimly and
grandly.</p>

<p>"Owing to things you said at the woolshed, I have come to make
explanations. My sister Kate is with me."</p>

<p>Kate stepped in, blinking in the light. She greeted Mabel
kindly. Bob brought a chair forward. There was a confusion of
greetings. Dora whispered to Kate that this was Bob: "He did come
after all." Kate and Bob bowed without admitting their previous
meeting.</p>

<p>"You've grown a little since last I saw you, Ross," said Bob,
shaking hands with him and hoping Father would be more reasonable
now, but his mental rheum was barnacled with years. He glowered
unrelentingly.</p>

<p>"The whole thing will take some explaining."</p>

<p>"The things you said, Mr. Barry. I know you were excited," began
Ross ineptly.</p>

<p>"Excited, what was there to be excited about?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wanted to say your accusations were utterly unfounded.
I've already made known my wishes to Miss Dora, and I do so again
before you all."</p>

<p>"That's very fine and glib, but I ask you if it was a
neighbourly or decent way to do it&mdash;to entice my girl...</p>

<p>"I wasn't enticed, as if I were an idiot. I went because I was
invited."</p>

<p>"What sort of an invitation?" He turned to Kate. "Now, Miss
Lindsey, you're a little too towney for my taste, but you are an
upstanding woman of the world: when you knew my idea of the ball,
do you think it was a fair thing to endanger the name of a young
girl by..."</p>

<p>Ross interrupted. "I must take the blame there. I alone was
responsible for Miss Dora's presence at the woolshed to-night. Kate
knew nothing about it till Miss Dora arrived."</p>

<p>Father looked from one to the other and grinned in his great
beige beard.</p>

<p>Kate spoke up generously. "As soon as I knew she was there I
added my invitation, and my mother added her welcome, though she
was upset about what you might think, and greatly regretted your
absence."</p>

<p>"There! You see how you were invited."</p>

<p>Dora was nonplussed. She burst out ingenuously: "I should never
have gone only I thought Kate invited me."</p>

<p>"I did. The whole family were formally invited, and immediately
you arrived my invitation became retrospective, as they say in the
Acts of Parliament."</p>

<p>"What else have you to say? This fine flash offer of marriage,
is that retrospective too, or is it negligible?" Father, having won
a round seemed in slightly better humour.</p>

<p>"A man has to make an offer of marriage on his own," said
Bob.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But his whole family is involved in the success or
failure of it. What, may I ask, would be your father's attitude
towards such a marriage?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose in his heart he's any sweeter to you, than you
are to him, but the Pater is a business man."</p>

<p>"Humph!" snorted Father. "Is that what you call it?"</p>

<p>"Let us talk this out quietly," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying, the Pater..."</p>

<p>"The Pater&mdash;what does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It's the Latin word for father," said Dora.</p>

<p>"Why the blazes then, can't he say father? Plain English is good
enough for better men than he'll ever be."</p>

<p>All this time Mabel moved back and forth preparing food. She had
quietly secured an elaborate cloth and good china from the house
since the Lindseys had been added to the arrivals.</p>

<p>"Well," conceded Ross, "the Dad, I know, thinks there has been
enough of our lives wasted in this row. He'd be satisfied to hear
the end of it."</p>

<p>Barry turned to Kate with exaggerated calm: "Now, Miss Lindsey,
I ask you, knowing what is between our families, if you think there
could be a happy marriage between a Barry and a Lindsey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Barry. The old trouble was about a marriage that did
not take place. It separated us and was magnified out of all
proportion. Let us unite now, and forget it as far as
possible."</p>

<p>"Is that your idea of morality?"</p>

<p>"Father, I agree with Kate. We've let it spoil too much of our
lives. If there was a marriage between the families the trouble
would soon be forgotten."</p>

<p>"Such things are never forgotten between decent people."</p>

<p>Bob persisted. "But there's a difference between a thing being
remembered and being continual sport for the whole district."</p>

<p>Dora asserted herself. "I think there's been a silly fuss about
Sid jilting Mabel. I wouldn't have all the neighbourhood in an
uproar if a man got tired of me and married someone else. He could
go any minute he liked, and good riddance."</p>

<p>"You speak without knowing the facts," said Father grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, what are the facts?" There was an embarrassed silence.
Mabel laid out the New Year cake. The tea was steaming in the
silver teapot, Mabel's skilled cooking was spread on the tea cloth
laundered to perfection.</p>

<p>"Have something to eat," she said. "Excuse it being set here,
but I didn't want to wake Mother, and the fire is nice now that the
wind is driving over the plains."</p>

<p>"It's lovely, Mabel, and I am quite peckish," Kate hastened to
say, hoping to avert tragedy.</p>

<p>"Yes," Bob was quick to support her. "I'm quite hungry too, and
that's one of Mabel's very own brand of cakes."</p>

<p>Dora was not to be put off. She felt she was being treated as a
child. Her voice came clear and determined: "What are the facts
that Father talks about? I don't want any more of these hints. You
tell me the facts, Mabel."</p>

<p>"What facts?" asked Mabel, but her pallor made it evident that
this was subterfuge. Her hand trembled as she placed a chair.</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;about Sid Lindsey jilting you."</p>

<p>"Mabel, tell her the facts," ordered her father.</p>

<p>Kate's and Bob's hearts were wrung by Mabel's predicament. They
were also sorry for what Dora was bringing on herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Barry, it's not fair to Mabel, and now that Sid is
dead...let it rest in his grave."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bob. "Let old things rest and begin again."</p>

<p>"I shall find out the truth whether you tell me or not,"
announced Dora.</p>

<p>"I never do believe in secrets. Tell her, Mabel," said Father,
obtuse to any but his own point of view.</p>

<p>"Tell her yourself, if you want her to know," said Mabel
piteously, as if struck.</p>

<p>"This is not the point at all," stammered Bob. "If Mabel's love
affair did not end happily..."</p>

<p>"But what did Sid do that's so terrible that Father talks as if
Ross were an alligator lying in wait to devour me?"</p>

<p>The food waited. The clock ticked loudly. The moke-pokes' cry
could be heard. The rising wind whispered around the house and sped
to rustle the silken grasses on the open rises.</p>

<p>"We must give Ross a chance to show his mettle," Bob thrashed
into the gap of silence. "Father, will you consent to Ross coming
to see Dora?"</p>

<p>"You're getting away from the point. I want to get down to bed
rock and be done with it."</p>

<p>Mabel saw that her hour had come. She had lived in dread of it
this ten years. She faced it as a victim the operating table,
nerving herself to the ordeal. "Goodness knows, I want to be done
with it too, and I'm going to be after this." Mick or no Mick, she
had a bank balance and a crock of sovereigns in the dairy. She felt
their support and resumed. "Well, Sid Lindsey and I..." She
baulked.</p>

<p>"Come on, Mabel, you've made your bed," said Father.</p>

<p>Mabel turned and looked at them bitterly. At bay, she spoke
savagely: "You've never let me forget that. Have it then, if you
want it, Dora...Arthur is not your brother&mdash;he's&mdash;he's
your nephew."</p>

<p>Dora stepped towards her unbelievingly. "What do you mean? Oh,
you can't mean..."</p>

<p>"Sid Lindsey and I were never married. That's the bed Father
means I made. He's always taken care I never got off it for a
moment. I've been thrown-off at and thrown-off at till I'm dead
sick of it. Father can get someone else to bellow at from this day
on."</p>

<p>It was Mabel's first word of rebellion. With it some
constriction gave way and loosed her to the vehement declamation to
which she had been reared.</p>

<p>The revelation foundered Dora. "Oh, oh, oh, do you mean that
Mabel is a-a-a-Oh, oh, I can't bear it."</p>

<p>Kate moved towards Mabel, but Mabel's attitude was stony. She
turned and went out into the night with the moke-pokes and
willy-wags and the wind, the hilarious wind that was growing rude
and wild. She had a feeling of guilt that her chief emotion was
relief that Mick had not witnessed her final humiliation. The
anguish of enlightening Dora had been robbed of potency by the long
years of anticipation. Sympathy too had lost power to wound or to
comfort. She had won self-reliance and fortitude.</p>

<p>Bob moved to Dora but she repulsed him. Ross was in a highly
nervous state, chewing his knuckles and tapping with his toe.
Father alone wore a triumphant expression as if he had finally
exposed the full villainy of the Lindseys.</p>

<p>Bob put his arm around Dora. "Never mind, Kiddy. It's an old
affair, all past long ago."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Kate. "You had nothing to do with it. You were
scarcely born."</p>

<p>"But Mabel&mdash;my own sister&mdash;a bad woman. I suppose
everyone has been looking at me and thinking I'm the same. Oh, I
hate you all," she sobbed with sudden passion. "Deceiving me and
making a fool of me! I thought the ball was a lark because Father's
always trying to come the harem lord on me. If I'd known, not the
invitation of the Governor-General himself would have got me to
Chesham Park. Ross, how dared you treat me like that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dora, I am sure you're taking it too hard."</p>

<p>"Now you know, I hope you're satisfied," said Father
complacently. "If you'd minded me..."</p>

<p>"I hate you worst of all&mdash;roaring over to the wool-shed and
making an exhibition of me before everyone. If you had behaved
quietly it wouldn't have been so terrible. You needn't roar about
it any more or try to keep me from the Lindseys or anyone else. The
longest day I live, I'll never show my face about Queanbeyan
again."</p>

<p>Passionate sobs stifled further utterance. Ross moved towards
her, but Bob intervened. "Leave her to me for the present. Give her
time."</p>

<p>"Poor little girl, it is hard on her," murmured Kate. "Yes. It
came as such a knock-down blow. You remember how we felt at her
age."</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="poem">Thus unwise graziers caught a-napping<br>
When word of fire came a-tapping<br>
At their door,<br>
Ran in and out and back again<br>
And round about as maids and men<br>
Have done before.</p>

<p>The appetising supper lay untouched. The cry of the moke-pokes
disappeared before whip cracks sounding like rifle shots.</p>

<p>"Listen! Something's up," said Bob.</p>

<p>Arthur bundled in from the adjoining store-room clad in shirt
and trousers, his tousled hair on end. He blinked comically.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Arthur! Sorry we disturbed you," said Kate.</p>

<p>"You're Kate Lindsey," he announced, pointing a horny finger.
"And what's Dora yowling about? And I don't know you," he concluded
to Bob.</p>

<p>The whip cracks came in off the main road. The men went out and
returned after a few minutes with Bullocky Bill from up the
Bandicoot River. He was a tall, lean, black-bearded bushman, clad
in felt hat, flannel shirt and moleskins. He announced that the
fire was sweeping the country back of Dead Horse Spur, not to be
seen from Bandicoot homestead, and that he had been sent to get
Barry out of his bed, as there was no one from Queanbeyan to
Riverina so useful in a bush fire.</p>

<p>"I heerd as I come by Turpeys' that the fire is gettin' away
from 'em, and with the wind risin' no man could tackle it like
you," said Bullocky.</p>

<p>"When did the fire start, and where?" inquired Barr.</p>

<p>Ross volunteered that it had started in a haystack up by the
head of Dingo Creek about 11 p.m.</p>

<p>"Why the devil wasn't I told when I was at the wool-shed?"
bawled Father. "And, blasted jackass, what are you doing here
poking your nose into other people's business, when the grass
around your precious park is like hay! Mabel!" he yelled.</p>

<p>Mabel appeared with a bottle in hand. The technique of a
life-time could not be discarded in a moment.</p>

<p>"That's right! Give Bill a nip..."</p>

<p>"I don't mind if I do," said that worthy, licking his lips.</p>

<p>The dramatic call to action came at the right moment to release
Father from an unhappy predicament of his own engineering. He stood
at the back door of the kitchen, master of himself and the
situation, unmistakable leader of those around him, scrutinising
the night. "The wind is coming towards us. If the fire gets to the
old saw mill, there's nothing between it and Lindsey's but the road
from Whipstick Crossing. Blasted fools! I've been telling the whole
district till I'm black in the face to prepare for fire; with no
rain for weeks on top of all that grass; but no, they prefer to run
about in motor cars, and swing flash goggles on their thumbs, and
give balls to the aristocracy, and philander with girls who ought
to have more sense than to look their way!"</p>

<p>Father's prestige was restored.</p>

<p>"Come on Kate, let's get home," said Ross. He was halted by
Barry.</p>

<p>"Blasted fools! You Lindseys have no more practical sense than
the rabbits&mdash;and that's underestimating the rabbits. You can't
get round the way you came with the wind where it is without
burning the tail off your horse. You'll have to go up Dingo Creek
and leave the horse go loose and run the sulky in the water hole
under the rocks."</p>

<p>He strode from the kitchen to the store-room collecting bags,
axes and other gear, and roaring orders. "Arthur, fling a saddle on
old Challenger. Tell One-eyed Sam I want him. Look slippy when I
tell you. Don't tread on a snake!"</p>

<p>"Get me some of Father's moleskins, there's a pet," said Bob to
Dora, "and don't worry over this thing now. It'll be better bye and
bye. I'll tell you the right way to look at it to-morrow. We've all
been through it. Think of poor old Mabel, she's the one we must
consider. It's gone by years ago in any case."</p>

<p>Dora collected herself and went to do his bidding. Father
returned to the kitchen, stuffing his shirt into his moleskins.</p>

<p>"You haven't forgotten what I taught you of trailing when you
were a boy?"</p>

<p>"No. I remember it all and some more of my own."</p>

<p>"Then you and Ross, get through the best way you can, and trail
that spur back of McTavish down into Slattery's flats. You can help
to save Lindsey's that way."</p>

<p>"Is it as bad as that!" exclaimed Kate.</p>

<p>"A smoke like Sodom and Germorrer," contributed Bill. "I'll be
making tracks."</p>

<p>"Where's Concertina Mick?"</p>

<p>"He went off at the beginning with Tom Harris," replied
Kate.</p>

<p>"I thought so. There'll be two men there, thank God, with a
little more sense than a cross-eyed wombat."</p>

<p>"I must get home somehow," said Kate.</p>

<p>"Just let Dad get out of sight and I'll go with you," said Dora,
rising like her father to emergency.</p>

<p>Arthur shouted that Challenger was ready. Father bulked in the
doorway giving final injunctions. "Keep inside the house. You'll be
pretty safe here, but watch the wind. Mark my words, this is going
to be one of those fires than runs in the atmosphere. If it gets
any nearer than big Bandicoot go to Turpeys' and turn all the old
woman's live stock loose and bring her up here."</p>

<p>Mabel handed her father his tucker bags. Loaded with his gear he
left the lighted doorway, and soon Challenger's hoofs could be
heard in smart action. He was followed by Ross and Bob in Bandicoot
clothes and the Lindsey sulky. Dora took Kate with her to change
their ball attire. Mabel provided something stout and plain for
Kate's wear.</p>

<p>Mother now appeared, wanting to know what was happening.</p>

<p>"Don't tell Mother about anything but the fire," adjured Dora.
Mabel nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>Dora and Kate got away as the sky was paling for Dawn. It was
full of mighty mares' tails rayed out from rim to rim,
rose-coloured, resembling a colossal mock sun and heralding
continuing wind. The fire could now be seen from the hill behind
Bandicoot homestead, sending up great columns of smoke and
devouring the ranges towards the Murrumbidgee.</p>

<p>Arthur pleaded wildly to go, and Dora undertook to be
responsible for him. He raced off with a whoop to put a horse in
the sulky for Dora and Kate, and to saddle another for himself.
Mabel released him from the milking, the care of the pigs and
Father's stud rams and ewes, and everything else about the
place.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="poem">Wild and wide the fire swept,<br>
Swift the creeks aria roads o'er-leapt:<br>
With fortitude plus skill, adept,<br>
Safe their homes the bushmen kept.</p>

<p>That terrible week in January finished as an overwhelming
triumph for old Bandicoot. Before it was half through he was
vindicated as a prophet and a bushman.</p>

<p>His own homestead stood as a model. The group of buildings was
protected in general by a wide ploughed surface. In addition around
every neat haystack was its own firebreak, not so long ploughed and
in other instances burned black the very day of the ball. There was
no scrub, and even the loss of green timber, the place's one
drawback, now had its purpose. Bandicoot was as safe as those
houses on Canberra Plains where fires started up like magic now and
again but were readily beaten out leaving no devastation other than
great black patches which reduced a little of the dead grass and
would sweeten the pasturage after the autumn rains.</p>

<p>It was beyond the Murrumbidgee in the foothills backed by those
fastnesses which lie upon the heavens like a necklace of sapphires
and opals that men warred day and night against one of nature's
elemental forces to save their lives' hard work. Here it was that
Bandicoot was a Joffre or Foch of the Allied Forces, with
Concertina, Bob, Tom Harris and several others as a Haig or
Pershing or Monash under him. Men rolled up from all directions,
called by telephone from Queanbeyan or Gininderra, and the most
skilled, the very ablest called by the smoke in the sky. Pioneers
by nature, by breed, by training, saw the signs afar and sped to
their neighbours' need. They rallied in communal
self-preservation.</p>

<p>The fire had started ten miles from Chesham in a haystack. A
sundowner was blamed. A miracle in wind swept the flames from the
house instead of towards it, or a grass-widow and her
children&mdash;Pat Burns was away towards Cooma,
fencing&mdash;might have been burned in their beds. From here the
flames rushed as if in special tubes towards the holdings of
McTavish, Slattery and three or four other extensive graziers, but
especially towards Chesham Park. The fire eddied and leapt by gully
and spur and made it difficult to reach its head, and there was no
use in hanging on to its tail.</p>

<p>Dora and Kate, driving desperately, with a horse that shied and
swerved, got through about sunrise with nothing worse than singed
paint on the sulky and a few inches off the horse's tail. They were
a great comfort to Mrs. Lindsey, who, with the cook and housemaid,
were all that were left in the house.</p>

<p>Dora, pet and companion of her Daddy, had spent much of her
infantile life in the open with him imitating or sharing his tasks
till he had banished her to the house so as not to spoil her
chances of feminine gentility. Her early training gave her the
leadership now and was the most wholesome thing that could have
happened her in the special circumstances. She set to work with
confident management. Mrs. Lindsey asked to be where she could see,
so the girls placed her in her big chair on one of the
verandas.</p>

<p>"You be sentinel and keep us informed," said Dora cheerfully,
having postponed the debacle of her life. She took stock of the
premises, which she had not seen at close quarters except last
night in the moonlight. There was ample ground for her father's
censure. The motor car and social pretensions subsided considerably
in the murk of that blazing January morning, with timber and
underbrush to within a quarter of a mile of the orchards and weeds
and grass everywhere, even along the sides of the house, in the
drive and around the hen houses and pig sty. There was no break but
a swamp full of dry reeds and bulrushes, and a small lucerne patch,
which had been allowed to run down because of the surplus of
natural fodder that season.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of her father in Dora as she inspected
that homestead and compared it with Bandicoot. The Lindsey
superiority was tarnished.</p>

<p>"We must let the race on everywhere we can, and have you a hose?
We must turn it on the house and garden and have everything as
sopping as possible."</p>

<p>Nothing approached Bandicoot method. The race had not been
maintained in first-class order because of the season. There were
breaks, and she and Kate worked exhaustingly to mend it. At
Bandicoot, wet season or dry, the race and water supply were always
in working order.</p>

<p>Before the sun was properly up it was plain that it was to be a
black day. The sky was heavy with smoke, the sun shone as a red
disc, the wind was relentless. For the first six or eight hours the
beaters concentrated on saving McTavish and Slattery. By nine
'o'clock it was evident that every effort backed by daring and
experience would be needed to save Chesham Park homestead.</p>

<p>Bandicoot had been quite right, the fire seemed to carry in the
air, or to start of spontaneous combustion, and the wind was
bringing the flames without halt straight towards the Lindsey home
paddocks. Flames ran up green gum trees as if they were tinder and
sent crashing blazing tops in a vast shower of brands and sparks to
set alight hundreds of yards around. Matters were so serious that
Dora sprang on to her own sulky horse without a saddle and galloped
for her father. She found him sweating and blackened from his
heroic labour, and clever as a sailor in a veering flaw tacking the
greedy flames.</p>

<p>He went back with Dora. He armed himself with green saplings and
set a match to the dry grass in the paddock between the orchard and
the timber. Dora and Kate continued their efforts about the house.
They freed all the small stock&mdash;dogs, pigs and
poultry&mdash;to the safety of the water from the race. Later it
became necessary to turn cattle, sheep and horses on the main road
where they could run free for twenty miles.</p>

<p>Kate and the maids, with buckets and dippers, threw water on the
creepers and vines covering the wooden verandas of the back
premises. By mid-day it was dark as twilight in the house, the air
full of floating cinders. The crockery on the kitchen dresser
became too hot to hold in the hands. Mrs. Lindsey's armchair was
moved to another veranda but nevertheless it was so hot that Dora
and Kate each fanned her for a few minutes as they passed.</p>

<p>More and more men arrived to concentrate on the flames, and work
desperately. They would be cut off, surrounded by flames, escape
with clothes on fire to be extinguished by their fellow beaters.
Ross tore in to remove his mother to a settler's home on the bank
of the river where there was better promise of safety. He brought a
horse and sulky around, lifted his mother in and supported her with
one arm and drove with the other. He said Kate and Dora should
retreat too. Dora, forgetting that her life had been smashed,
cockadoodled at him and threw some water over him for safety. He
looked comical with her father's mighty trousers hanging on him and
gathered round his slim loins. Neither Kate nor Dora could be
spared from their efforts to save the house.</p>

<p>During the hottest hour of the afternoon a hundred men or more
gathered on the opposite hillside battling with the flames. Only
Barry's acres, safely burned in spite of the high wind, lay as a
barrier between the house and the oncoming flames. Barry was the
general, in spite of his years working like ten, encouraging
others, risking his life, doing daring deeds like a vulcan, his
beige beard long since singed and blackened beyond repair. Bob was
his able lieutenant. Arthur worked like a wild thing, and to save
his life, had to be ordered back time after time. He worked beside
Lindsey. He had a desire to do well in Lindsey's eyes and ask him
for a job later.</p>

<p>Tom Harris and Mick Bell were leaders at another strategic
point, and Ross strove furiously. Lindsey worked superhumanly to
save his home and family but he could not out-do old Bandicoot, who
was a giant beside him, and performed with the abandon of a highly
geared temperament spending the pent-up rancour and hurt of half a
lifetime in a gladiatorial gesture in the eyes of his world.</p>

<p>Many of the men were more tired than they should have been had
they been called from bed instead of from a ball. No one dared
halt, no one thought of rest nor needed it for the first
twenty-four hours. As the battle drew nearer, the women from
Chesham carried tea along the ranks, and food which the men
snatched in blackened hands, and bolted without desisting from
beating.</p>

<p>At night the ranges were alight like towns, or that vain new
city which spreads to-day on the old plains, where in those days
the spire of St. John's reigned over an area as large as a
principality, and Duntroon was a private township far from
neighbours.</p>

<p>Rabbits; kangaroos, wallabies, lizards, goannas, snakes, birds
of all descriptions rushed from their flame-swept hinterlands. Many
thousands of pounds' worth of fencing was wrecked.</p>

<p>The flames licked the old haystacks and bark-roofed cowsheds.
When all seemed lost, Bandicoot turned the fire and Kate ran with a
bucket of water and extinguished his clothes. Pursued by tongues of
flame, many of the men rolled in the race, and rising soaked,
rushed to work again. Neither roads nor streams were much break on
the flames that day and night.</p>

<p>The second dawning showed the house still untouched, but the
fire was menacing it from another scrubby point. The men were not
so full of speed and strength to-day. It seemed for a time as if
the flames would conquer them. There was a tall old box tree not
far from the stables. It was riddled with borers and pipey. The
flames reaching the dry bark of its trunk ran up its hollow as up a
chimney. It threw sparks right on the stable, and beyond that, via
storehouses and pantry, lay the house. Here it was that Arthur
surpassed himself. It was he who really saved the premises, at one
crisis pulling Lindsey Sr. out of the flames cast by a dead falling
limb of the tree and himself receiving a painful burn on the upper
arm. Even that did not deter him till the danger from that point
was past.</p>

<p>The men had been too busy to note the sky and to see that the
mares' tails had massed in mighty thunder clouds like celestial
mountains. Then miraculously the wind went out. A few big drops
fell hissing in the ashes around the beaters. They could not
believe their senses. They halted and looked up. Effort immediately
slackened. The exhausted earlier beaters withdrew, leaving later
corners on guard.</p>

<p>Ross took the sulky and went away to see if his mother was safe.
He feared for her comfort in the crowded quarters of the settler.
Men trooped to the house. Some sat on the edge of the verandas,
heads against wall or post. Others stretched out on the floor,
asleep as they lay.</p>

<p>Old Barry, with beard gone and eyelashes singed off, scars like
brands on hands and arms, tumbled into Mrs. Lindsey's armchair.
Lindsey tried to get him inside to rest properly.</p>

<p>"He's a great old warrior," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Kate. "I don't care how he roars hereafter, it
will seem no more than the song of a canary to me."</p>

<p>Lindsey too had his thoughts on neighbourliness, seeing the old
man exhausted and battered and knowing to the full that the safety
of Chesham homestead was largely due to him. He said nothing
however. It was his habit to act. Bandicoot was triumphant now. He,
Lindsey, must make some public acknowledgment of it as the time
came.</p>

<p>Kate and Dora went around throwing rugs over heated and
exhausted old men or putting cushions under their heads. Now that
the tension had relaxed, Arthur was howling with the pain of his
burn. Kate and Dora applied baking powder and oil and other
remedies, but they failed to relieve him. He screamed for cold
water despite all advice. He rushed off to the race and thrust his
arm in. The cool water brought a certain amount of relief and he
was so exhausted that he fell asleep as he lay half in the water
and the rain falling on him.</p>

<p>Ross brought his mother home, and as she came the horse shied at
Arthur. Ross saw what had happened and was able to reassure his
mother, but only partly.</p>

<p>"That dear child!" she wept to Kate. "It is our boy, poor Sid's
child. He has suffered pain and danger saving the home which cast
him out and has never been his." Kate, calmed her mother by
promising deeply that in future they should do all that was
possible for Arthur.</p>

<p>The rain mercifully continued, a sharp thunder shower, lasting
half an hour; never had one been so opportune. Everyone could now
safely seek rest, and later there were jolly episodes in foraging
for food.</p>

<p>Dora awakened after a couple of hours and found the fire was
safely subdued by the rain and she back again in that desolation
wrought on the night of the ball by knowledge of Mabel's fall. It
was a worn-out Sensation or a calloused cicatrix to others, to Dora
it was crushingly new. The fire had been an interruption of her
tragedy but she returned to it now with a sick jolt. She insisted
upon going home immediately. She imperiously refused Ross's escort.
She roused up Arthur, who looked ill from fatigue and pain, and
took him, leaving both her father and Bob sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>Kate, on the contrary, as she drifted into well-earned sleep
felt that life would begin anew on waking. It would have freshened
purpose and savour. Bob was a sheltering rock. He was so big and
comfortable, and the look in his eyes made her feel young and
beautiful still, cleansed from the corrosion of age with which
Dora's unwitting imputation had stained her.</p>

<p>Dora found a full house at Bandicoot. Mabel had had some work to
save the post office, and ended by bringing old Mrs. Turpey to
Bandicoot for safety: Later she had seen the roads dark with
liberated live stock, and with the assistance of a wise old stock
horse and Ginger, an expert dog, had turned everything that came
along into the paddocks where they could not cause a shortage of
grass that season. Lindsey's brand predominated, but McTavish,
Slattery and others were well represented. Mabel saved half a dozen
neighbours endless trouble and loss and was later blessed for miles
around.</p>

<p>She also baked a mighty batch of bread and cakes galore, and
boiled a vast round of beef to be sent to Chesham, where she
estimated a Mother Hubbard condition would be inevitable.</p>

<p>Bob returned home not so long after Dora and was sent back with
the provender, a congenial jaunt as it took him again to Kate. The
adventures of the last couple of nights had re-established their
youthful relations in a manner which under normal conditions might
have been uncertain or in any case tardy.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="poem">All is the same, yet none the same, I see!<br>
A shade has come across the sun<br>
And turn'd my world of gold to dun,<br>
The old, they do not understand&mdash;Ah me!</p>

<p>The grass, was green again on Whipstick Crossing and Bonnie Brae
(McTavish's), Chesham Park and Turpey's, and all the other charred
places. The winds in the early morning and at sundown had an edge
that reminded they would soon rush cuttingly across Canberra Plains
from the frore highlands beyond the Timlinbillies and
Brindabullahs. Folks were saying that the bridge picnic would be
too late as the days were perceptibly shortening. The official
opening of the bridge, which Lindsey was largely credited with
securing, was to be the culminating summer event of the
district.</p>

<p>Following the bush fires, life had shaken back into its
accustomed ruts. Everyone knew that Bob Barry was home from
Queensland, developed into an enormous man and said to be highly
well-to-do. He was as striking a figure as his father and without
his father's defects of temper. He was invited everywhere and went
everywhere without restraint or snobbery. He was the current social
lion.</p>

<p>"Shure, if he was put up for mimber there would be none against
him," said old Slattery, and others agreed. But Bob made it clear
that he would never return to the cold country permanently after
knowing the Queensland climate. Rose Ann was equally delighted with
him and her father would have aided her in "ketching" him
regardless of his religion, but Bob was always at Chesham Park. The
know-alls recollected that he and Kate had been sweethearts of
yore. A mere girl and boy affair, but it was remarkable that Kate,
with plenty of opportunities, had not married, and that Bob was
still a bachelor.</p>

<p>Everyone looked upon the Barry-Lindsey embroglio as washed-out
at last. The perspicacious Lindsey was not so sure about it. The
old man was subdued in manner and changed by his closely-cropped
beard that was slow to regain its old luxuriance. Dora would have
been pleased if he had clipped it in a smart peak, but he insisted
upon it being round, which she said made him look more like a
feeble-minded 'possum than the old style. He walked proudly before
men these days, but he simply could not quite give in. Some clot of
spleen remained undissolved.</p>

<p>To Dora all was changed. She refused to go abroad, so keenly did
she feel the old disgrace. She would not even go to Queanbeyan for
singing lessons, though, her quarter being finished, her father
sought to coax her with another.</p>

<p>Following the fire, Ross rode over boldly. Bob welcomed him and
brought him in. Father, though not gushing, was neutral. Dora
disappeared. Ross enlisted Bob's support. He said to give her time.
The shock had been great, but she would recover. Dora said she did
not want to see Ross or any other man again, all she asked was to
return to Queensland and remain with Bob till old enough to train
as a nurse.</p>

<p>Father noted with satisfaction that she did not always disappear
when Tom Harris came. Tom knew better than to take heart, because
she managed so that he never saw her a moment alone, and she
ignored his letters. She returned Ross's.</p>

<p>This subdued her father. He was worried to death about her. He
was mild and indulgent and tried to arouse her interest in any kind
of pleasure. He promised to take her to all the up-country Shows,
and later to Sydney at Easter. He grew insistent. It was unavailing
against the new Dora, who would not be led into the dissipation of
invective as of old. She wanted only to know when Bob was returning
to Queensland. He postponed it for one thing and another, which
seemed trivial to Dora. She wondered how Bill could do without him,
but now he had finalised his stay by promising his friends to
remain for the bridge picnic. In seventeen years he had never taken
a holiday; it was the right time of year for him to have leave of
absence, and he did not find three months too long to devote to
what he considered the most important business of his life.</p>

<p>Mabel was worried by Dora's withdrawal from all she had been
demanding and by her changed attitude and demeanour, Bob had had
many long talks with Dora following the fire. Patiently, wisely.,
affectionately, earnestly, he discussed the subject that had
changed her. He laid before her the great mistake of his own youth,
which had been to follow his father in enmity towards the Lindseys,
and his failure till recently to recognise Mabel's tragedy. He
confessed his determination to compensate Mabel by treating her
with all possible consideration and tenderness now and hereafter.
He had pleaded for Dora's co-operation.</p>

<p>The girl had responded generously and warmheartedly to Bob's
representations as far as tenderness to Mabel was concerned. She
turned from her carefree ways and relieved Mabel of much of her
hard drudgery and affectionately, almost fiercely championed her,
but her own withdrawal continued. This was more difficult to Mabel
than if Dora had hated her and been hard to her. That she had
expected, and had the technique for enduring. Her lonely heart
swelled with affection towards Dora but she was filled with renewed
remorse owing to what she had brought upon the girl. It set her
intention to leave the old place and district without any backward
glances. Bob, suspecting something of her feelings, pleaded with
her to be brave and wait a while without doing anything rash. This
alone was causing her to delay.</p>

<p>She and Mick had arrived at a definite understanding, and in the
kitchen when he remained the night at Bandicoot, and when the
family were in bed, they would discuss the pros and cons of the
home they were to make together. They were to add poultry keeping
to dairying, and Mabel was fascinated with the illustrations and
directions concerning incubators to be seen in certain
publications, and deeply absorbed in the reports of a popular
egg-laying contest proceeding near Sydney. Mick was against
incubators. Late at night, as-the coals subsided and he and Mabel
drew nearer over them, he might have been heard to maintain: "There
ain't nothink you can teach a good old hen with all her feathers
on. I'm allus for nature as much as possible."</p>

<p>Under cover of a visit to the dentist, Mabel had been to
Goulburn to consult a lawyer. She went down at the time of the
Highland Gathering&mdash;from Queanbeyan. Mick had proceeded via
Yass, a subterfuge which had not prevented certain Queanbeyan
sleuths from putting two and two together, and the result was a
good deal of chuckling and gossip. Mick had wanted to be married
then, but Bob's pleas for delay restrained Mabel, and she needed
just a little more time to steady herself for the final plunge. To
her intense surprise she found that Arthur was entirely hers as he
could not have been with a legal father, and her plans immediately
coalesced more richly around him. Everything was to be arranged for
his protection. Any slight to Arthur would have jeopardised
Concertina's position, but Concertina was enamoured of Arthur as a
valuable asset, and too cautious to take risks. Besides, he liked
the lad and was touched by his friendliness and belief in him,
Concertina being the only person other than Mabel who had ever paid
him particular attention.</p>

<p>Other plots were ripening.</p>

<p>"The poor old Dad just can't give in," said Bob to Kate as they
were exploring one of the old tracks and came to a halt on the rim
of Bandicoot Hill, with the foothills and ramparts of the mountains
wreathed in the background, and the plains towards Queanbeyan and
Gininderra and Yass spread far in the bright sunlight before.
"There's a sort of mental gallstone left that wants operating
upon."</p>

<p>"If Ross breaking his head and your Dad to the rescue, then the
fire and he being boss hero of the district, hasn't melted him and
given him sufficient satisfaction, it would take some
gelignite."</p>

<p>"The trouble with these old fellows is that they are so much
cock of their own walks that they get an exaggerated idea of their
importance. I got thinking when I got away to Queensland, also
there are three of us in partnership there, and we've had to
consider each other and none of this bellowing as soon as another
point of view comes up. These old chaps are like monarchs on their
own dust heap and no one dare say boo. The Dad's been made worse by
having poor old Mabel as an absolute slave. By George! what she
does!&mdash;as much as two women and a jolly good man. If she
dropped out the king-pin of Bandicoot would be gone. It would have
to be entirely reorganised, and the Dad would find he'd have to
soft-pedal a bit with people in a position to roll up their swags
and clear out if things didn't please them."</p>

<p>"But where could Mabel drop out to? She has stayed in that rut
so long she would be lost elsewhere." Kate was fishing to discover
if there was any truth in the rumours about Concertina. She so
little esteemed him as a possible brother-in-law that she would not
ask the question direct. Bob felt similar reticence.</p>

<p>"I'd like to take Mabel to Queensland with me for a year and let
her have a good change, for a start."</p>

<p>"But don't you live with Bill?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we're thinking of adding to the property by a place
with such a first-rate house and orchards and garden that it would
be a pity to let it go to ruin."</p>

<p>"You want a housekeeper?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and a heart-keeper too if..."</p>

<p>Kate adroitly changed the subject. She did this continually. It
made Bob nervous. Sometimes he rode home under the stars connoting
the evidence and deducing therefrom that Kate was all his. He felt
he had only to speak. More frequently she would be so aloof that he
was as timorous as a boy lest he be sent about his business. He now
had a definite plan of procedure which he would follow unless Kate
enticed him from it, and for that he would be on the alert.</p>

<p>He must really get back to Queensland after the picnic, taking
Dora. Mabel decidedly refused his invitation. She had given him no
further confidence about Mick. He thought she was waiting for Mick
to come to a definite head. He, Bob, would foster the present
friendly relations with Kate till the last day. If she accepted, he
could then make new plans. If she refused, he would go off with
Dora as intended, and leave people to think what they liked about
him and Kate not finalising matters.</p>

<p>It was the best of plans to draw Kate from her wearing wavering.
She had passed the age when a woman can plunge into marriage
without reserves and hesitations. She was not pushed by the need to
find a berth. She had her share in the station. Concertina Mick
threw a shade against her acceptance of Bob. Nor did she altogether
like the thought of migrating to Queensland. And there was her
mother so dependent upon her care. On the other hand, she really
desired the adventure of marriage before it was too late. The
longer she waited the harder it grew to surrender deepening
habits&mdash;to surrender herself. There were other men still in
the offing&mdash;city men offering a city life, but she had rather
a contempt for them, having been reared in the pioneer school as to
what constituted manliness. Bob Barry seemed less besmirched by the
repellent traffic in other women which has put marriage out of
bounds for many a fastidious woman capable of self-support. His
station in Queensland was not in those areas with gins available to
the white man's prestige and virility. Yes, Bob was ever so decent.
He was getting fat like his father, and his hair was thinning to
put a curb on transports, but in marriage there was so many cons
that when the pros were at all enticing, at thirty-five one had
better plunge. Then she would fear that Bob had no thought of her
beyond passing his holiday pleasantly with an old friend. It was
then that she would entice him&mdash;almost over the brink.</p>

<p>Bob was completely satisfied with Kate: She was six years his
junior and looked ten even in the sunlight. She had worn well. She
had gone high in the social scale since he had left Bandicoot, and
Bob liked that. He desired something in his wife to set against the
English pretensions of Bill's wife and her brother. Oh, dear, oh
dear, if only Mabel had kept up with Kate, Mrs. Bill's brother
might have been won from bachelorhood by her, and he was much more
presentable than Concertina Mick.</p>

<p>When Kate considered the matter she thought that should Dora
marry Ross, as she undoubtedly would as soon as she recovered front
her present cloud of depression, which made Ross more and more
eager, this pair would naturally run Chesham Park while her father
went to Sydney for the Parliamentary season. She could take care of
her mother in Sydney. Her mother was so frail however, that any day
might see her lamp go out, and Kate would be without a metier. She
would like to be engaged to Bob Barry and delay marriage on the
score of her mother.</p>

<p>Bob was enthusiastic about the possibilities of motor transport
if only it could be rendered fairly dependable.</p>

<p>"But that's all coming," Lindsey would say. "Before another ten
years, there'll be as many shops for repairing motor cat's as there
are blacksmith's forges to-day."</p>

<p>Bob was as clever as his father with machinery and was a boon to
Lindsey. Soon he could take the engine apart and give it skilled
attention, and could drive as well as a professional chauffeur. "By
George, I wish the Dad would take to one. It would be a hobby for
him. He would be his own mechanic, but he has taken a dead set
against cars just out of jealousy and stubbornness."</p>

<p>This observation, made to Kate, gave her an idea, which she
passed on to her father.</p>

<p>There was a plan brewing to make a big presentation to Barry at
the time of the opening of the bridge. This was a final attempt to
placate the old man for political reasons plus genuine appreciation
of what he had done in the big bush fire. A committee met. Various
gifts were suggested such as a silver tea and coffee service for
Pa, and a piece of jewellery for Ma Bandicoot, but there was money
in the district that year and the response had been so liberal that
a motor car became possible. The collectors went forth again, each
giver pledged to secrecy, and as the secret was known to all but
one man and two or three of his dependents, this time it was kept.
Half a dozen graziers such as Slattery, McTavish and Lindsey
contributed substantial sums, but the smaller settlers were now
tapped and proved a mine. Scarcely any for a radius of many miles
but had received service from old Bandicoot in one way or
another&mdash;had been given grass for a last cow or horse in
droughts, or lent a dray or horse, or presented with a load of
fruit or a joint of beef, or Mrs. Barry's practical aid in
child-birth, and they all wanted to contribute. One or two dances
were organised in back localities to procure the final amount
needed. Then Bob and the Lindsey men had business in Sydney, though
Bob went down a day in advance for obvious reasons. He wanted to
take Dora with him, but even this she refused.</p>

<p>The plan was to surprise Barry at the bridge celebrations when
all the district would gather, and the onus of getting him there
was laid on Bob.</p>

<p>"If he really jacks-up I'll have to rope him and bring him by
force, or we should all look fools."</p>

<p>"Let us all make a family raid upon him and vanquish him once
and for all before the thing is exposed to the public again,"
suggested Kate.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know where he stands in the matter since the
fire," said Bob.</p>

<p>That was what Barry did not know himself, but it was
crystallised to him and made plain to Bob in a family tornado a few
days later.</p>

<p>Previous to the revelations about Mabel, Dora had never been
rendered unhappy by her father's ravings. She had grown up to them,
and having a lively wit and high spirits could hold her own and
sometimes carry off polemical honours. Until the night of the ball
it was the limitations of her life against which she had been in
purposeful rebellion. Mother subconsciously enjoyed the turmoil. As
with persons of low emotional pressure she had to absorb from the
more highly dowered in feeling. She only grew tired of it when it
conflicted with her own desires. It was on Mabel that the din had
had a deleterious nervous effect.</p>

<p>Since the night of the ball however Dora was as wounded as Mabel
by Father's invective and she was in a position to protest, which
Mabel had lost. Father's storms were becoming more noisy with age
and through having no outlet but his own family.</p>

<p>It had not always been so. His animadversions on Lindsey's
character were once to be heard half the length of Crawford Street
and up and down Monaro Street. Lindsey had been driven to put a
stop to that. As he had ascended in the social scale it became
insupportable to have Blastus bawling his alleged felonies to the
wide and windy skies for every visiting aristocrat to hear.</p>

<p>He sued Barry for libel. He would have had no trouble in winning
his case, and a few fat thousands in the overdrawn Lindsey coffers
would have been as acceptable as those he had won by exhibiting
Bandicoot sheep as security. Barry had the money and Lindsey had a
water-tight case, but he also had Mrs. Lindsey, and no matter what
Barry knew or suspected of him, Lindsey so deserved his high
reputation as a devoted husband and father that it cannot be too
often repeated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lindsey intervened with tears and pleadings and a 'bad
turn.' "Think what they have suffered. Oh, Alec dearest, never,
never can we bring more sorrow to that house, no matter how foully
he roars."</p>

<p>Lindsey maintained that he would be doing Barry as well as
himself a benefit to shut off the slander. It called attention to
the tragedy which reacted more heavily on Bandicoot Hill than on
Chesham Park. This was quite true, but Mrs. Lindsey persuaded him
to compromise. He let it be known to Barry's lawyer that he would
be satisfied with a full and abject apology from the defendant to
be published in the four adjacent papers of Goulburn, Yass,
Queanbeyan and Cooma.</p>

<p>It was a bitter bolus for Blastus to swallow. He considered
hard, but all his liquid assets and a good bag of his prime merinos
in the balance was no light matter. He halted till reminded that
failing the alternative the case would proceed. He blustered and
delayed but common sense, plus the lawyer, suave but relentless,
won. In spite of his high temper he was an unrivalled business man.
If he paid he would nevertheless be debarred from expressing
himself thereafter. Mulct or unmuleted, he had to restrain his
tongue. His withers were wrung by the abject apology put forward
for him to sign. Not only had he to withdraw all he had said as
wholly untrue and brand himself as a liar, but also to express
profound regret for the unnecessary pain he had given innocent
people, and he could never again safely vent his spleen to
outsiders. His family thereafter had it all.</p>

<p>He was compelled to insert the advertisement, but had an idea
that took some of the sting out of the humiliation. The copy sent
to the press had to be passed and proof-read by Lindsey's lawyer,
there was no dickering there, but so long as he paid for it, and it
contained nothing obscene nor libellous, the apologist was free to
insert a line of personal advertisement in the same issue of the
paper. He had this placed immediately under the black lines which
guarded the apology. The various editors accepted it with glee. It
ran:</p>

<p class="newspaper">IF I HAD THE MONEY I WOULD STICK TO WHAT I
FIRST SAID<br>
<br>
(Signed) WM. BARRY,<br>
Bandicoot Hill Station,<br>
via Queanbeyan.</p>

<p>Four districts enjoyed that, and the story is told with gusto
to-day by a few of the remaining old hands. The apology was
defeated...Barry was a hero. He was one-up on Lindsey.</p>

<p>Lindsey's lawyer phrased a letter to Barry warning him that in
case of further libels he would not be "given the option of an
apology." Lindsey had to be content that at least he had silenced
his enemy from roaring in the ears of that higher social clique
into which he ascended.</p>

<p>When the gilt wore off the joke the abject apology rankled in
Barry's craw. And not so long after that it was his turn to be put
to confusion. At that date he was patronising McCarthy's Hotel,
down near the bridge. After retiring one night he arose to put his
boots in the passage to be cleaned. He did not make a light, and
losing his direction, opened the door of a wardrobe and thrust in
the boots. There was a great hub-bub next morning. The rouseabout
who cleaned the boots swore he had not eaten them. Barry was for
having the whole staff dismissed, but that was ridiculous. The
publican did not believe any of them guilty and retained them
all.</p>

<p>The fellow guests that night were all squatters of Barry's
standing and above suspicion. A commercial traveller who departed
at four in the morning to catch the train for Cooma was mentioned,
but it was contended that he was a small man who would have no
personal use for Barry's boots. The old man cast aspersions on a
house where an honest man could not stay a night without the boots
being stolen from his feet. The landlord offered to supply a new
pair and Barry sat at breakfast, in his socks&mdash;no available
slippers being large enough&mdash;and afterwards in the hotel
parlour an assistant from Wright Bros. had the fun and the profit
of supplying a new pair of hoots.</p>

<p>Barry's remained in the wardrobe till they came to light in a
spring cleaning, and there was a rattling joke for the wags. Barry
was one-down. The story is still told but the raconteurs cannot say
whether Barry paid the publican for the new boots when the others
were found&mdash;a question invariably put.</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="poem">Ross sang with the birds<br>
That his beautiful Dora was like the Aurora,<br>
Transporting, amazing&mdash;such comical phrasing!<br>
And others and others and others.<br>
With ardour nigh crazing, and logic quite dazing<br>
Such love oft-times smothers and smothers<br>
In millions of words.</p>

<p>Those were the days, such a fleeting moment past, when Tumut was
the choice of the House of Representatives and Bombala that of the
Senate for the site of the Federal City. Bombala was nervous about
being selected or not selected, and longing for a decision to
stabilise business. There were imputations concerning this, town's
capacity to grow wheat, but what bearing that had on its
suitability as a site for the continent's political experiments is
not apparent in casual reference to old newspapers. Tumut had kept
itself to the fore by a new railway, opened by the Governor and
Minister for Works with bunting and a banquet and all such
conventional trimmings.</p>

<p>Blackett, the Federal Member, and other important elders were
desirous of some stir in their area. There was nothing to hang it
on but the bridge, and a low level bridge over the Bandicoot,
though of service to various settlers, was a parochial structure.
Had it been across the Murrumbidgee it would have been much better.
The Minister for Works and the Governor could not, without loss of
dignity, officially open the Bandicoot Bridge, especially as it had
been in use for weeks.</p>

<p>But fortune&mdash;social fortune was favouring the district at
that date. One of the seigniorial establishments of the
Plains&mdash;such a perfect home from home for vice-regality that
it was whispered of its chatelaine: "She tries to be quite
vice-regal herself",&mdash;was to be honoured by a visit from the
Governor of an adjoining State. The visit was announced in the
Metropolitan press of the Mother State as well as of the Governor's
own. Blackett and Smithers acted. The gentleman, though on holiday
recovering from indisposition, nevertheless could attend the bridge
picnic and attract attention to the district's claim to Federal
consideration so zealously promulgated by the noted townsman, John
Gale. The concensus of opinion among the graziers was that one
Governor was much as another, no matter what State he represented,
all being representatives of His Majesty's and equally the property
of the taxpayers.</p>

<p>Viscount&mdash;the holidaying Governor expressed a wish to take
part in a wallaby and hare drive. His nephew, at one time aide to a
Governor of New South Wales, had spent a month's vacation on
Brindabullah, and was permanently enthusiastic concerning the
hospitality, horses and sport on that station. The bunyip being
discredited, and widgeon, black duck. bustard, emu, kangaroos,
wallabies and other charming natives having long since given place
on Canberra Plains to seigniorial baa-baas, or to Mesdames
Crinningan's and Sullivan's turkeys and geese, it was necessary, in
pursuit of hares and marsupials, to meet the request of the lordly
guest to farm him but on the Lindseys, the best substitute for
Brindabullah.</p>

<p>The Lindseys, seizing opportunity, and inviting the
neighbourhood's co-operation were to present the Viscount to a
gathering at the bridge, have some old hand break a bottle on it,
have an early picnic lunch, alias a banquet, dulled with speeches
about the glories of Queanbeyan and Canberra, to be reported in the
Metropolitan newspapers. Then to the wallaby hunt, the hosts
astutely estimating that two or three hours halloing and riding the
rough gorges back of Bandicoot Hill would meet requirements.</p>

<p>The visiting Viscount was desirous of seeing the real bush, as
extolled by his nephew, the vice-regal aide, and eagerly accepted
the Lindsey invitation to stay two or three days with genuine
pioneers. Here Bandicoot could have come in most happily, but
through the difficulties of approaching him, a happy issue out of
old troubles was not to be achieved without a final storm or
two.</p>

<p>The Governor expressed his intention to potter around informally
among the real bush homes, and Bob and Kate were in a quandary.</p>

<p>"The Dad considers that he has the chief patent on pioneering.
Old Cameron is the only man he admits to the same rank; so if the
Viscount comes here to see the old pioneers and ignores Dad
there'll be a noise. On the other hand we're so out of things that
a visit from a viscount would cause such a flutter that the old
people would exhaust themselves and smother the guests with fuss
and feathers."</p>

<p>"Your father is the very person his Excellency would enjoy.
Bandicoot has lots of pioneer fakements, and the merinos are such
swells that it would be insulting to leave them off the visiting
list. I'll take it in hand."</p>

<p>The result was that Kate and Ross were to bring the visitor for
a surprise call at Bandicoot, and preliminary to his appearance
Barry was to be confronted by his own family plus Kate and Ross,
and forced to common sense. Bob could see that plans for peace at
the bridge and the presentation of the motor car would be wrecked
without strong measures, but he was uneasy about those measures
taking his family by surprise. However he was so enamoured of Kate
and her social ability that he had submitted, but he gave the women
a hint to be in readiness for both deputation and vice-regal
call.</p>

<p>Bandicoot homestead was a centre of work those glorious late
March days. The Governor would have been in his element could he
have stayed there, where the old ways still held and the orchard
was yielding up its treasures for the winter. Apples, quinces,
baking pears and, pie melons were packed carefully on great shelves
and sometimes held till the following spring. Bandicoot was
vigilant against codlin moth, and the less gentlemanly vermin that
now destroy fruit before it can properly ripen, had not then
appeared. Bottling, jam-making and drying were in full blast. Mabel
shouldered the chief burden in this work and was invaded by
homesickness to realise that this winter she would not be there to
enjoy her preserves.</p>

<p>Upon such a scene Mick Bell once more intruded with the mail
bag. He came often to Bandicoot now. He and Mabel had their plans
fully laid. His beard was considerably trimmed since the fire, but
the black pipe was generally in active service.</p>

<p>Bob had robbed the bee hives and a mass of comb in a canvas
cloth the size of a blanket was straining into a wide milk pan at
one side of the hearth. Dora was peeling and coring apples. Mother
was covering jam in vessels ranging from a kerosene tin to a wine
glass. Mabel was baking cookies and marshalling afternoon tea on a
corner of the dresser, all other spots being requisitioned.</p>

<p>Arthur, Bob and Dad came from the orchard with clothes baskets
full of choice fruit. Bob said he was thirsty. Arthur complained of
being hungry.</p>

<p>"Your stomach must be of the best elastic," grinned Bob. "I saw
at least a kerosene can of peaches go into it."</p>

<p>"Aw, fruit!" complained Arthur. "It only makes you
hungrier!"</p>

<p>"Keep away from the honey! Who'll want to eat it after you
lapping in it," said Mother.</p>

<p>Bob voiced his idea about a dash of cross breed being good for
the frozen meat trade, and Father contended: "The pure merino for
me. That Champion Vermont of mine has done more for the quality of
wool about here this last few years than all your Romneys and
Leicesters, and that ewe&mdash;twenty-four pounds of wool last
shearing."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mick, did you see what they are doing at the bridge as you
come by?" eagerly inquired Arthur, while Father unlocked the mail
bag. Arthur had hopes that this year at last he would be permitted
to attend sports and other celebrations.</p>

<p>"It's goin' to be quite a turn-out," began Mick. "They're goin'
to have tree ferns all along the sides, and poles, and them little
bits of flags."</p>

<p>"Bunting," suggested Mrs. Barry.</p>

<p>"That's it. Old McTavish and Slattery and a pack of others are
all on the job. Old Mother Turpey is all atwitter. She's got an
idea in her head that as she's such a old pioneer she'll be asked
to cut the ribbon." Good old Grandma Turpey was only pretending
this to put Barry off the scent of what was actually planned.</p>

<p>"Do spit it out," Arthur broke in. "Goin' to be any horse
racin'? If Dad would let me run old Challenger."</p>

<p>"So you think you are going to be there!" said Dad from behind
the Courier.</p>

<p>"Ain't we?"</p>

<p>"This is the first I've heard of it."</p>

<p>"Why can't we?"</p>

<p>"Because you can't. Let me hear no more about it. Suit you
better to dig those potatoes."</p>

<p>"Aw, be sugared! Just because old Lindsey will be there. He
can't eat us, and it ain't his bridge. I think meself he's a nice
ole bloke. If you arsk me, I think it's downright unfair."</p>

<p>Arthur had been firmly for going to work on Chesham Park after
the fire, but Mick Bell had turned him from it with one thing and
another. There was a first-class shaving kit and watch coming to
Arthur from Mrs. Lindsey, to be given quietly so as not to arouse
too much gossip, but that, Arthur did not yet know.</p>

<p>"There's whips and whips of things unfair to you and me, Arthur,
and we've got to put up with it." Dora was working with tense
energy. She had taken Arthur under her wing since discovering the
blot on his birth.</p>

<p>"Dashed rag, there's never anything in it," murmured Father as
he had murmured many a time before, and turning from the price of
ewes and fats to the news column. "I don't know why I'm such a fool
as to keep on paying for it." Suddenly he thrashed the paper.
"Listen to this: 'His Excellency Viscount &mdash;&mdash;'" (He
pronounced it: Ex-cellency Vizcount)...</p>

<p>"What's a Vizcount?" inquired Arthur. "I thought them old blokes
w'at they make into Governors was Lords."</p>

<p>"You'll be a Vizcount if you slip into that honey," admonished
Bob.</p>

<p>"Do you want to hear this, or do you not? God bless me soul, I
can't be heard in me own house."</p>

<p>"Fire away, Father. We're all ears," encouraged Bob, who himself
was on tenderhooks as well. He wanted to get away to Turpeys' and
telephone Kate for a word or two. They had quite a code on the
telephone to puzzle, if not defeat, the listeners-in. It might be
this afternoon that the deputation would appear.</p>

<p>"Well, his Excellency Vizcount &mdash;&mdash; is to be at the
bridge."</p>

<p>"He ain't our Governor," contributed Mick. "I heerd as I come
along. He's one of the others come here for a spell and to see if
it's fit for the Federal Capital."</p>

<p>"'The Vizcount who has several volumes of an historical
character to his credit, is greatly interested in the pioneering
days and is to spend a week or more in the vicinity interviewing
the old hands. During part of his stay he will be the guest of A.
Lindsey Esq. at Chesham Park.' Chesham Park! That'll show you!"</p>

<p>It was the real Hereford roar that of late had not awakened the
echoes. "This Vizcount Governor comes here to write one of those
bits of books&mdash;what in thunder would he know about the early
days?"</p>

<p>"Some of those English lad-de-dahs couldn't tell the difference
atween a old yeo and a bandicoot, but they give theirselves as many
airs as if they knowed it all."</p>

<p>"I suppose the gentleman can find out," said Dora, severely.</p>

<p>"Yes, but do they come to those whose ancestors settled the
place to find out&mdash;no! They come to people who don't know
enough to&mdash;to&mdash;to..."</p>

<p>"Git in outer a wet thunderstorm," suggested Mick.</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't know enough to trail their fences in a dry season.
If his Excellency came to me, but these English fools that we have
to pay taxes for&mdash;and there's too blasted many of them eating
their heads off:<i>I</i> could choose better men for the job of
Governor at seven bob a day! God bless me soul, there would be no
Chesham Park to come to, if it hadn't been for me."</p>

<p>"I expect the Viscount will hear all about that," said Bob
soothingly, thinking what a mess it would be if Kate appeared with
him that afternoon.</p>

<p>"He's coming to meet the real pioneers&mdash;blast it, the
pioneering days are done now."</p>

<p>"A good thing, too," interposed Mother. "I couldn't live through
any more of them."</p>

<p>"There isn't any more pioneering. There's only soft-handed
sappy-headed fools leathering about in motor cars&mdash;in
parks&mdash;parks! Does the Governor go out and meet the few real
pioneers among the old hands? No, he stays with a low-down lying
scoundrel with..."</p>

<p>"Goggles," said Mick with a wink at Mabel.</p>

<p>There was worse to come. Father read on and discovered that Lord
&mdash;&mdash; longed above all things to take part in a wallaby
and hare drive and that one was being organised in the back
paddocks of Chesham Park at which in the usual way, each shooter
was to appear attended by a driver. Father was so red in the face
that Mother looked at him and said: "I'd be afraid to get so
excited if I were you William, lest. I drop dead of apoplexy."</p>

<p>Dora stepped forward tense and white-faced. "Father, another
word about the Lindseys and I walk out of the door and never come
back."</p>

<p>Bob had had difficulty in extracting a promise from Dora to
attend the bridge picnic. She consented only on condition that he
would start for Queensland immediately following and take her with
him. Kate said she understood how Dora would want to escape for the
present and that that was the way for her to recover normality.</p>

<p>Dora's ultimatum to her father was received with surprise as she
had been unusually silent for three months. Mabel stoked the oven
and slammed its door unnecessarily.</p>

<p>"Things are coming to a pretty pass if I can't open me mouth in
me own house without you jumping into it."</p>

<p>"The bargain was that there would be no more about the
Lindseys."</p>

<p>"God bless me soul! You can't live in the same locality with
people and not mention them. A pretty thing."</p>

<p>"You can mention them sanely when you have to. But don't run
them down all the time. It shows a deplorable spirit."</p>

<p>"And by what authority do you set yourself up to judge my
words?"</p>

<p>Here the fountain raised its voice. "My fountain's nearly boiled
dry," exclaimed Mabel.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'd better give her a drink," said Mick, going for
water.</p>

<p>Bob put a hand on Dora's shoulder but she shook it off
nervously. "I cannot stand Father shouting continually about people
who are no worse than ourselves."</p>

<p>"A pretty thing if I'm to be dictated to in me own house. What's
the world coming to, I want to know. Here is Lindsey, a man of poor
principle&mdash;I have proved him to be, and here he's chose for
Parliament..."</p>

<p>"I want to go to the bridge sports," said Arthur
discontentedly.</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to the bridge," said Mick. "You better come with
me that day. I'm goin' to Queanbeyan."</p>

<p>"Straight wire, do you mean it, Concertina?" Arthur was all
agog. They went outside together.</p>

<p>"We ought to have cleared out years ago when poor Mabel went
wrong and made a fresh start somewhere," said Mother, regardless of
Mabel's feelings now that Dora no longer had to remain uninformed.
Mabel tightened her lips and thought with satisfaction that she
would soon be out of hearing of all their reflections.</p>

<p>"This 'poor Mabel' business makes me sick. Mabel is a jolly
sight better than other people, if she only held her head up," said
Dora.</p>

<p>"Cleared out, woman! Me clear out! My father came through the
Gap back there at Dead Horse Creek&mdash;Chesham Park! It was our
horse that died there&mdash;an old brumby with a white rump that
carried the packs&mdash;I've heard my eldest brother
say&mdash;about 1836 and this fellow doesn't come here till the
seventies&mdash;and where did he come from&mdash;rared in some town
most likely."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter where you came from, William, it's where you
go to that makes for success."</p>

<p>"I'll do without success if I can't come by it like a white
man."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, William, that's it's not so hampering for a man
to be a little shady in his own dealings as it is for him to be too
concerned with other people's sins."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Bob, "the thing is to mind your own duck house and
let the other fellow mind his."</p>

<p>"Man alive, haven't I been a good neighbour and husband and
father? Did I ever give an example to my boys of anything
dishonest?"</p>

<p>"I hope not. But if I had my life over again I'd pass over
anything short of murder, before I'd be at outs with the
neighbours."</p>

<p>"It's against nature, its against the Bible that he should
flourish so. He lets his place run wild and is a menace to the
whole district.<i>I</i> have to risk me life and have the beard
burned off of me saving him, but the Governor goes to stay with
him. I keep the rabbits clown and all vermin killed off, yet a lord
comes here and old Lindsey gets up into the seventh heaven of
society because he has a breeding ground for hares and wallabies to
have a drive with. What do you make of that?"</p>

<p>Arthur here appeared with a piece of watch-dog news. "Some one
is coming in Mrs. Turpey's old sulky, at least I'm sure it's her
old mare, I could tell her hollow back a mile away, but it doesn't
look like old Mrs. Turpey, it looks like Ross and Kate
Lindsey."</p>

<p>"The flash motor car broken down again and they're crawling
about with Turpey's old mare," said Father.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="poem">Vanity pleaseth as a flower,<br>
Its fall hurteth for an hour:<br>
Short the sweet and long the sour<br>
Of oddly measured mortal dower.</p>

<p>Bob went down towards the main road to meet them and learn what
had happened.</p>

<p>Lord &mdash;&mdash; was on his way to pay a call at Bandicoot.
He was at Turpeys' talking of old times with the pioneer
postmistress while Kate and Ross hurried on in the borrowed sulky
to have the arranged interview with Barry. Lindsey Sr. was with the
visitor and would bring him in the car to Bandicoot and then slip
away in the sulky to keep a fictitious appointment, and leave the
Bandicoot visit with Ross and Kate.</p>

<p>Concertina had instructions to keep Arthur well out of the way
and Mabel had agreed to stand with the others in the meeting,
though she had not budged an inch from her refusal to appear at the
bridge picnic. Bob, recognising her as the one hero of the whole
boiling, had eventually allowed her to keep to her own gait.</p>

<p>Bob entered with Ross and Kate and confronted his father in the
kitchen. His sisters and mother were already there. Bob was
spokesman. "Well Father, the whole district wants to do you honour
and they want to be sure you will attend the bridge picnic the day
after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What's this about?" He glowered suspiciously at Ross and Kate,
and noted that his own women, though protected by aprons, were
quite dressed up.</p>

<p>"It's about what you did to save the district in the fire, Mr.
Barry," said Kate.</p>

<p>"That's all bosh. A civilised man has to take his part against a
fire, or in killing snakes when he sees them."</p>

<p>"You're dead right, of course, and have always practised what
you preached," pursued Bob. "Still, the district wants to do itself
proud, and Kate and I ask you for the sake of the young people, and
the sake of Mother who used to be so friendly with Mrs. Lindsey,
and for the sake of Mabel, who has been the mainstay of Bandicoot
ever since she could bake a batch of bread, to let the old trouble
die out and begin on a clean slate...Dora, that is what you want,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I can't live under the old conditions, and shan't ever
come home if they continue." Her evident nervousness impelled Ross
to speak when his silence would have been more helpful.</p>

<p>"The Pater&mdash;beg pardon&mdash;I mean Dad, sends his
compliments, Mr. Barry."</p>

<p>"So! It's your father is back of this, is it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Kate. "Father is only one of many who wishes to show
public appreciation, and I cannot deny my mother's desire for
peace."</p>

<p>"So your father sends his compliments&mdash;he does," persisted
the old man testily. "His compliments! All the way from Chesham
Park to Bandicoot Hill."</p>

<p>"Well, Father, why don't you go one better and send your
compliments and best wishes for success at the next election to Mr.
Lindsey," suggested Dora.</p>

<p>"That's what you want me to do, is it&mdash;send my compliments
to Chesham Park. You're all very clever and smart now, but when you
are my age&mdash;and I hope you will be able to carry your day as
well as I've carried mine&mdash;you'll find it's hard to teach an
old dog new tricks. Compliments!"</p>

<p>"It needn't exactly be compliments, but something decent and
friendly," added Dora.</p>

<p>"Something decent. Have I ever been indecent?" He looked on them
one by one and saw they were all of a mind. "So this is what you
all want?"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of affirmation.</p>

<p>"So Bob, you want this?"</p>

<p>"More than I ever wanted anything in my life. I came home to
bring it about and it is high time I was getting, back to my own
place." He had taken his courage in his teeth a couple of days
previously with satisfactory results. Kate would not consider an
immediate marriage, she would at least have to await the result of
the parliamentary election, still six months hence, and settle her
mother in Sydney, but Bob felt sure of his future happiness.</p>

<p>The old man turned to Kate. "You have come here to demand this,
to hold me up. Why?"</p>

<p>"It would help to restore my dear mother's health. She has
prayed for peace continually. Surely she has suffered long
enough."</p>

<p>"Why do you want this?" He turned to Ross.</p>

<p>"I want goodwill and peace."</p>

<p>"Do you want to marry this Ross Lindsey? Is he the only man in
the district?" he asked Dora.</p>

<p>"I want to be able to meet him calmly without this silly
hullabaloo. I don't want to marry anyone, but I do want peace:"</p>

<p>"Do you want this, Mabel? Are you ready to forget and forgive
and kiss the Lindseys and send compliments?"</p>

<p>"You're piling it on a bit, Father, but I think it would be
best. I'm sick of the thing being raw about me." Mabel, having
fulfilled her undertaking insofar as the deputation was concerned,
went out to see that her fountain was boiling and the tea in
readiness for the approaching aristocracy.</p>

<p>"Not one of you has spoken the truth. The real reason is because
Sandy Lindsey wants to get into Parliament and he thinks if he
smoodges to me..."</p>

<p>"Oh, Father, for shame!" cried Dora.</p>

<p>"You do my father injustice. Mother doesn't want him to stand at
all because it will take him so much away from her."</p>

<p>"We've had some trouble to get the Pater to toe the line," Ross
added inopportunely. "You needn't be afraid of him loving you too
dearly."</p>

<p>"I expect not, unless it suits him," said Father grimly.</p>

<p>"This suits us all." It was a chorus.</p>

<p>Father turned to Mother, not hitherto interlocuted. "Mother,
what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I shall be thankful to have the row ended. I have always said
so. I've missed Mrs. Lindsey's friendship more than I can say."</p>

<p>"You too! Everyone, even you are against me." He sat down,
visibly overcome.</p>

<p>"Not against you," said Bob. "We simply want you to give over
advertising Mabel's trouble for ever."</p>

<p>Expostulations and asseverations were stopped by Arthur, whom
Concertina could no longer restrain. He rushed into the kitchen.
Father's attitude meant nothing to him. The presence of Kate and
Ross were insufficient to inhibit him. He was as impetuous as his
grandfather, and vice-regality, a kind of deity, was at his
gates.</p>

<p>"Old Lindsey's motor car is up there by the potato paddick, and
there's a funny old bloke with a rag hat sitting beside old Lindsey
in front. Mick says it's this other Governor."</p>

<p>"It's that Lord hisself alright," corroborated Mick. "I seed his
picter in The Town and Country Journal down at Turpeys'."</p>

<p>"Bring me The Town and Country Journal," ordered Father,
catching at the final phrase.</p>

<p>"You stopped it weeks ago when it printed the pictures of
Chesham Park," said Mother aside to him, with her little flicker of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Golly, I'm going to have a good squint at him," exclaimed
Arthur. "How can he be the Governor! He just looks like any other
old bloke, only for his funny hat." Such rare fauna had not
hitherto appeared on Arthur's restricted beat.</p>

<p>"Don't go gawping at people like a yahoo," ordered Mabel.</p>

<p>Arthur darted to the door and ejaculated: "Holy Smoke!"</p>

<p>"Don't act like a wild thing, boy. Keep out of sight, unless you
clean yourself. Mabel, bring your father his coat."</p>

<p>"What the devil is the Governor doing here?"</p>

<p>"He ain't our own Governor," said Mick.</p>

<p>"He's the representative of His Majesty just the same," said
Mother. "And is deserving of respect."</p>

<p>"He wishes to see the old pioneers in their own homes without
any formality," said Ross. "He's a whale on the real pioneers
without any frill and the Mater told him this was the place to
come."</p>

<p>"Any honest man is welcome at Bandicoot," said Father
oracularly, "at any hour of the day or night, and he'll always find
a feed and a bed for himself and his horse, whether he's the
Governor or a black fellow. That's my idea of hospitality."</p>

<p>"A jolly good one, too, Mr. Barry."</p>

<p>"Yes, Father," said Bob, taking the reins. "Lord &mdash;&mdash;
is calling on you specially because you are the leading wool-grower
and pioneer. You must go to the bridge affair the day after
to-morrow. You couldn't hold out without raking up things that must
be let lie from now on. We cannot stand it any longer. That's why
we came and had this understanding beforehand, to save you from
making a fool of us all. You must join in the crowd. You must go
with the times. Might as well be in jail as refuse to
progress."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kate, with equal firmness. "So while his Excellency
was visiting old Mrs. Turpey we came on ahead. He expects to see
you now. He is not interested in our past mistakes."</p>

<p>Barry bristled and gave a Hereford glare right and left, but
Mother, regardless of the symptoms, summarily helped him into his
coat, urgently insisting: "Come on! Come on! You always make a fuss
when the grandees ignore you, and here's a Governor, one of the
highest real lord ones, nearly here and you're busy roaring about
something that will give you apoplexy one of these days. Mabel, see
about tea. Come on, Dora."</p>

<p>The women had already discarded their aprons and were revealed
in careful toilets.</p>

<p>Kate went out to receive and introduce the guest. Mabel went on
duty with cakes and cups. Concertina helped with the boiling water.
Arthur peeped openmouthed under a corner of the window curtainette.
Ross detained Dora outside the door.</p>

<p>"Don't treat me as a stranger and as if nothing mattered. You
haven't answered a single letter."</p>

<p>Dora shook her head but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dora, that isn't fair. Did you only pretend to care because
you thought I was going to peg out?"</p>

<p>"I know things now that I didn't know then:"</p>

<p>"Poor little kid. It wasn't fair the way it was thrown at you.
But it should make you and me care more instead of less."</p>

<p>"Everything is changed and spoilt somehow," said Dora with
filling eyes.</p>

<p>"Hang it all, I don't see why you and I should punish ourselves.
There's been enough mess and suffering already to wipe out other
people's old scores."</p>

<p>"But if I had known, I should never have gone to the ball."</p>

<p>"Oh, be sugared! That's a wash-out long ago. My black colt is a
clinker now. He's waiting for you to ride him and name him:"</p>

<p>"I'm going away with Bob the day after the bridge." Ross's face
fell. "Oh, I say, don't go, and you can have the colt for
keeps."</p>

<p>"I want to go away," said Dora, beginning to cry softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, don't cry. Everything is cooked-up to come right,
better than before the Bally old ball. Don't go for a week or two
at least." Dora still shook her head. "Perhaps it will be best for
you to have a change, but please, if I write to you, will you
promise not to send my letters back?"</p>

<p>An imperative call from Father terminated the interview. Lindsey
was now approaching the house. He had halted for a quarter of an
hour on the hillside so his guest could enjoy the splendid view,
and Kate and Ross conclude their mission. Mrs. Barry, in company
with Kate, was advancing upon the arriving representative of King
Edward. She was dressed in a flowered sateen of the day, its high
stuffed collar finished with lace, her hair carefully frizzed in
front and confined in its unbeauteous bird's nest at the back, and
she was sure of herself as a virtuous, industrious she-pioneer.
While Kate introduced her, Lindsey excused himself and went to
return Mrs. Turpey's vehicle.</p>

<p>Father was at a disadvantage, being taken completely without
warning, but he advanced gamely in his working clothes and hastily
applied coat, plucking for the moral and masculine support of his
pioneer beard only to find it trimmed. He strode through Kate's
introduction extending a great hand and wringing the Governor's.
"Welcome to Bandicoot, your Excellency. I am proud to welcome you
both for your own sake and mine, and because you are one of the
representatives of His Majesty the King."</p>

<p>"It is very kind and generous of you to say that, Mr. Barry."
The Governor took off the rag hat so exercising to Arthur. It was
of stitched tweed. Arthur's glances moved from this to the snowy
spats, even more astonishing, so that Mabel administered a thwack
from the rear lest his ejaculations betray his presence.</p>

<p>Lord &mdash;&mdash; was thin, pale, clean-shaven, bald-headed,
and mild-mannered to obliteration. He was the physical type of
Englishman who in London would attract no more attention than a
blackberry among its fellows on a branch. He lacked the aplomb and
spectacularity which sits so well on high officials in the
limelight. He was the type of Englishman which overseas has excited
ridicule and caricature, and which, because so unimpressive
personally; has been dismissed as either silly or stuck-up.
Sometimes such an exterior has disguised the most insidious
diplomats of the old regime, men who as a race and class have
annexed the world and ruled the seas with a low voice and mild
manner plus first-class guns and engineers. Other times in its
unpretentious simplicity, which wears so well, are contained the
human salt of the earth, men for ever holding aloft standards of
justice and integrity, or relighting lamps of freedom. Of such was
the first official Viscount ever to visit Bandicoot Hill.</p>

<p>He was led into the museum of the prize merinos. He was
unaffectedly interested in each one and expressed a desire to see
the originals. Bob went forth to round up those that were running
at large.</p>

<p>Kate spoke of the great up-country fireplace, and Father
conducted his guest to it on the way to the sheep stables. He
ordered Dora to appear.</p>

<p>"At Bandicoot you'll see things just as they are without any
fal-de-ral," he said. Arthur bolted into the storeroom, where he
could see through an augur hole in a slab, which he preserved
uncovered for his own purposes.</p>

<p>"Magnificent!" murmured his Excellency. "I should like to see it
full of logs in winter."</p>

<p>"There's not many of the old fireplaces left," said Father.
"They're getting these flash grates so that you can only warm one
toe at a time."</p>

<p>"The old ways go. It is sad, but I suppose we must
progress."</p>

<p>Father said they would inspect the prize winners and then have
some tea. "If your Excellency had sent me word, you should have had
a real bush damper."</p>

<p>They went to the stables through the flower garden bright now
with cosmos, carnations, petunias, pentstemon, golden glow, phlox,
canterbury bells, cornflowers, alyssum, chrysanthemums, dahlias,
asters and the festive poles of giant hollyhocks. The Viscount
halted in the orchard to eat a late peach and a wonderful seedling
apple without a core, which melted in the mouth and about which he
was most enthusiastic. Kate noted the trim order, the bristling
prosperity. The place looked so substantial. With a few
improvements and womanly touches it would be a home fit for
anyone.</p>

<p>The subjugation of Bandicoot proceeded amain. The Viscount was
not merely a composition of unsuspected tact, he was genuinely
enjoying this surprise visit to an ordinary bush homestead.</p>

<p>"I must congratulate you that you are not snorting through the
country like a dog with a tin can to his tail as most of the
sight-seers do."</p>

<p>By the time they had seen the merinos, Lord &mdash;&mdash; knew
a great deal about old Blastus, but old Blastus knew nothing of the
nobleman except to consider him: "A real gentleman&mdash;no frill
or nonsense&mdash;a sensible man that knows his business."</p>

<p>"He's Johnny on the spot for that all right," agreed Ross.</p>

<p>Father told about the fire and the loss of his beard. Dora so
recovered in the ease of the vice-regal manners that she said: "The
fire was very hard on beards, your Excellency. It was a blessing in
that."</p>

<p>"I fear you weren't sympathetic about the casualties in beards,"
twinkled his Excellency, and turned to Father again. "Mrs. Lindsey
tells me that their estate was not long since called 'Dead Horse
Creek' after a horse of yours. I've made a note of that."</p>

<p>"Yes, your Excellency, my oldest brother, he was many years
older than me, was the first white child born up the Murrumbidgee
here. Pioneering&mdash;man alive, the tales I could tell your
Excellency." He switched off from this to tell how he had stood in
Macquarie Street to see the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York
passing. "I wouldn't be surprised now if you would actually see His
Majesty and the Duke when you return."</p>

<p>"I shall have that honour, Mr. Barry."</p>

<p>"Well, then, tell them from me that me and my wife and Dora here
stood in the street for hours waiting, and saw them as near as I
see your Excellency now. Would they be interested to hear
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Father, how could they! They see millions of people," said
Dora deprecatingly, but Lord&mdash;was equal to this. He had been
efficiently educated to govern a bumptious democracy, and had a
kindly nature.</p>

<p>He had another call to make in the nature of the one on Mrs.
Turpey. Ross went with him for this. Kate waited at Bandicoot. As
the motor car departed, the deputation reformed around Father.</p>

<p>He sat down heavily again now that the excitement waned. "I'm
only the old way-backer, and pioneering has had its day. I've had
mine. You all want things your way. I must go to the bridge because
his Excellency commands it and he is a representative of the
King."</p>

<p>"That's a good Daddy," said Dora. "I'd rather stay at home, but
I'll go to keep you company."</p>

<p>"I've had my day," he repeated. "It's your turn now. Go and do
as you want among yourselves and ignore me. We old bushmen didn't
know enough to be good for us. We pulled through somehow by main
strength and neighbourliness. It's your turn now. See to it that
you carry your day as well as the old way-backers did who blazed
the track for you. That's all."</p>

<p>"Daddy, you haven't sent any message to Mr. Lindsey."</p>

<p>"Compliments! No, I. won't send compliments. That's fal-de-ral.
No compliments, but I don't mind sending my best respects to your
mother."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Kate. "It will make Mother very happy."</p>

<p>Dora ran to him and put her arms about his neck: "Oh, Daddy,
that's lovely."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness," murmured Mother in the background. "Now I
shall be able to go to Chesham again and not be shut like a rabbit
in my own burrow."</p>

<p>Old Bandicoot rose up stiff and straight, turned about as if
undecided and said: "Your mother is a good woman, Kate Lindsey.
Always was from a girl. I might as well do it proper. Your
mother&mdash;well, for your mother's sake, you can tell your father
that he has nothing to fear from me in the election. I'll keep
inside me own burrow."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Barry," said Kate, offering him her hand, which
he took. Then she had to hurry away to meet the car.</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="poem">PHANTOM HORSES<br>
<br>
Upon the range their hoofs wild music make,<br>
And echoes clear in gullies dim below:<br>
Where waterfall and night birds keep<br>
Their ancient watch from dusk to break<br>
Of day, by haunted tracks they know,<br>
They pass where wild things softly sleep<br>
Till the sunset's lingering glow<br>
Has gone, and shadows velvet deep,<br>
From bush and bough the colours take,<br>
And o'er the world the star beams creep,<br>
And in the homesick heart there sharply wake,<br>
Poignant as youth the thoughts of long ago.</p>

<p>On the day of the celebrations, the sun quivered in bright waves
across Canberra Plains and by Tharwa and Tuggranong as the
neighbours far and near rolled up to meet the visiting Governor and
take part in picnic or wallaby hunt, or both. The presence of
vice-regality brought out the whole electorate plus folks from
adjoining divisions. The wallaby and hare drive would be mostly
rabbits, not that that entirely spoiled its novelty for the English
visitors.</p>

<p>-Bandicoot Hill was well represented though not by the whole
family. Mabel was absent. Arthur had partly adhered to Mick's plan
and was to meet him at the cross roads at 1 p.m. This would give
Arthur something of both worlds, and he was satisfied. He had a
notion of persuading Mick to abandon the Queanbeyan trip in favour
of returning to the hunt.</p>

<p>Bandicoot drove his prize greys. Dora rode Grey-gown, and Bob
was on Challenger. The Governor was in the motor car, but Kate and
Ross were on horseback. It was still the day of the horse.</p>

<p>As soon as the picnickers were out of sight, Mabel could have
been seen running about with violent energy putting the house in
faultless order for her departure. Her modest tin trunk was packed.
The contents of the crock had been changed for more convenient ten
pound notes and sewn in her stays, and no one knew of their
existence but herself. She did not entirely trust premarital
professions of affection.</p>

<p>She was taking only a few intimately personal belongings, and
Arthur's working clothes and whip. Everything else was left
untouched in her room, even the furniture which had been given to
her on her fifteenth birthday, and the bed&mdash;that thorny bed
she had made, which she was now deserting for Concertina's. He had
managed to dispose of his selection quite profitably and had but
few things for which to return later. He and Mabel were to be
married in Queanbeyan and set out for the South Coast there to
inspect one or two dairy properties that enticed them in
advertisements, taking Arthur in tow. Mick recognised the lad's
potential value on a dairy and did not want to lose him. Mabel was
set that neither she nor Arthur should enter that dairy except upon
clearly and legally defined partnership. So much for
experience.</p>

<p>Mabel had been preparing silently each night. There remained
only final touches. Everything was spotless, shining, perfect. She
gave the pigs an extra helping so that they should not be too
hungry. She went around the hen houses and gathered the forenoon
eggs with a pang to realise it was for the last time on Bandicoot.
She laid the table in readiness for the homecomers' meal that
evening, and placed some match bark and small wood ready to kindle
a fire.</p>

<p>When all was to her satisfaction, she took off her father's old
hat, disclosing her front hair in curlers which she had not dared
to use for nearly eighteen years. She put on a new dress, very
plain and sedate, but well made recently by Dora. She applied the
lace sent to her by Mrs. Lindsey. She put it on and off a number of
times, fearing it too gay or that it might be considered "loud" in
her in conjunction with frizzed hair. She was justified and set at
ease by Mick's glances when he arrived with old Governor amiably
drawing the lately-acquired sulky.</p>

<p>"By tripes! You are a swell. You look younger than flash Kate
now. I allus said if you perked up, Mabel, you'd run rings round
some of 'em."</p>

<p>To ease her self-consciousness she asked him to pen the calves
while she made the tea.</p>

<p>She cleared away every crumb, put away their implements,
re-swept the hearth, which needed no touch to its white perfection.
She put the letter of explanation she had written on her father's
plate, took a final look around and went out with Mick, filled with
tremors that outweighed all sense of escape.</p>

<p>Father was greeted by cheers as he drove up to the bridge in his
buggy drawn by the beautiful greys. This surprised him but put him
in good tune. Lord &mdash;&mdash; had already arrived. He had not
forgotten the pioneer of Bandicoot Hill and left some old timers
and talk about wool, to greet him. These people could not go to
Lord &mdash;&mdash; culturally or socially, but his education had
been so comprehensive that profitably and entertainingly he could
come to them. He was capable of absorbing new impressions, and he
had crops and pastures, sheep and cattle on his own estate in the
Shires.</p>

<p>His recognition of Bandicoot washed away the last of the old
rancour and the old man strutted like Chanticleer recovered from a
successful moult. There was better to come when he was chosen to
cut the ribbon to champagne the bridge. He collected himself
sufficiently to hand the little gold scissors to Mother, who
accepted the honour without losing her composure.</p>

<p>Dora alone was perhaps not quite reconciled. Youth has its
exaggerated sensibilities, its own conventions and snobberies, and
it appeared to her that the old pioneer business was a little
overdone. Her father was found to be entertaining rather on the
order of a performing bear. This accentuation of the pioneerage had
to her a touch of condescension from the peerage and was too
obviously arranged to placate her father, who behaved so
childishly.</p>

<p>There were speeches in the Governor's marquee built as a guard
against the breezes of disciplinary temperature that rushed from
blue mountains behind them right across Yass and Queanbeyan down to
Goulburn and beyond.</p>

<p>Lindsey's candidature was vociferously received. Old Blastus,
right in the limelight, was so exhilarated that he stood up and
shook hands with Lindsey for all to see, the first time in years
and years. The gathering was raised to a great excitement. Father,
noting Dora's smile, went a little above himself, and placing his
hand on her shoulder made his amende honourable for the humiliation
he had brought upon her when last seen together in public.</p>

<p>"Me daughter and me here never do things by halves. We're not
namby-pambies, are we?"</p>

<p>"No, Daddy," said Dora, wondering how much champagne he had
taken and hoping he would not make too much of a fool of himself.
Bob's happy expression reassured her.</p>

<p>"When all is said and done, Sandy Lindsey is a better man for
the district than that sappy-headed gormoral they are trying to
shove on us from the other camp."</p>

<p>This was greeted so noisily that Father went one better. He
looked around till he caught Kate's eye: "Go and tell your mother,
Miss Lindsey, that me and me wife and me eldest daughter will vote
for your father at the next election."</p>

<p>Riotous excitement and calls by Bandicoot for three cheers for
Mrs. Lindsey. "A lady for whom I have always had the highest
regard, one of the best neighbours in the district."</p>

<p>It occurred to Bob that mayhap unrequited regard long ago lay at
the root of his father's long-a-dying animosity towards a
usurper.</p>

<p>"And, please, Father, can young Ross marry your youngest
daughter?" inquired the district wag. This was the cap. Dora's
blushes and Ross's mounted like flags, but Ross raised his hat with
a grand sweep.</p>

<p>"I always believe in the ladies marrying any men who please
them, and the men in marrying the girls they want, if they can,"
said Bandicoot handsomely. The speeches then turned on political
points such as the Burren Juck water reservation plan and the still
undecided site for the Federal Capital, and the district's
claims.</p>

<p>As Barry was pledging his eldest daughter's vote, she was
crossing the plains, nervous from long seclusion, regretfully
looking back for a last glimpse of the comfortable, well-kept old
homestead under the brow of its sheltering hill with its gardens
and orchards richly spread about it. She hardly expected to see it
again. She thought sadly of the calves penned so early, the pigs
whimpering to sleep without their late draft, the fowls waiting
about the back gate and going to roost disappointed. All these
creatures had looked to her and never wounded her. There had been
so much of her labour in maintaining the homestead that a great
deal of her existence was amputated in those stores of dried
fruits, the jams and jellies on the pantry shelves, and the neat
offices.</p>

<p>Mick saw her wistful looks. "Lonely, old girl?" he said kindly.
"We might have near as comfortable a place of our own afore we're
ten years older."</p>

<p>The speeches were curtailed in the bush marquee as all were
eager to get to the hunt. The Governor rose a second time. "I have
a very pleasant duty to perform. It has fallen to my lot as a
visitor on this delightful occasion..." These words led on to the
announcement that the splendid new motor car&mdash;much out-doing
the Lindsey Ford&mdash;that Ross was bringing right up to the
banquet table, was the district's presentation to William Barry,
Esq., and his family.</p>

<p>Father's voice for once failed him. Words, indeed, following
what had gone before, would have been anticlimax. Lord
&mdash;&mdash; patted the distinguished pioneer on the
shoulder.</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="poem">The old man came to his home on the hill&mdash;<br>
A goodly place, the work of hands ne'er still,&mdash;<br>
With all its rich and cleanly lands<br>
Well-plough'd, and clear, and fenc'd and trim,<br>
But futile seem'd his wealth to him.<br>
That night he learned that firmer stand<br>
The houses built sans human hand.</p>

<p>There remained the Bandicoot homecoming at dusk in the grand new
car, which Bob drove. Mother sat beside him, half frightened of the
new vehicle, but upheld by the thought of all she would have to
tell Mabel. Mabel had her mother's enjoyment of gossip, the need
for it as recreation, the crueler then that she should so many
years have been shut off from its indulgence while being its object
in major and unpleasant degree. One of Concertina's charms for
Mabel was that he was a great gossip. Nothing on his own plane
escaped him.</p>

<p>Father followed the car at a safe distance with his buggy and
greys, feeling for them somewhat as for lovely twins displaced by a
greater phenomenon. There was regret as well as triumph in
possessing a machine so wonderful that it would banish the peerless
saddle and harness horses.</p>

<p>Dora came after the buggy, leading old Challenger&mdash;grand
old beast. Ross had wished to accompany her, but she dismissed him
at the turn-off. He could not get beyond her promise not to return
his letters. For vanity's sake if not for love's he must win Dora
now. He was increasingly ardent and was glad that Kate and Bob had
arrived at the engagement stage. It acted as a kind of insurance
upon his connection with Dora. Bob would be coming back for Kate,
the sooner the better, Ross felt, as, in case Dora should persist
in remaining in Queensland, he could pay Kate a visit. There were
all sorts of possibilities, and Dora would recover from her
depression when she got away where no one knew of her family
misfortunes.</p>

<p>He rode home full of renewed hope. Tom Harris on the contrary,
was so dispirited by what had happened that he accepted Jean
McTavish's invitation in preference to returning to a desolate
hut.</p>

<p>Barry was thinking of Mabel as he turned off the main road. He
was glad he had mentioned her, held his head up about her. She
would be surprised when she heard he was going to vote for old
Lindsey. So would Concertina, who had so loyally gone off to
Queanbeyan and taken Arthur with him in preference to going to the
bridge and watching old Lindsey showoff with this Lord Somebody.
Concertina would be surprised to see him with a motor car. Ha! Ha!
Life had some queer somersaults.</p>

<p>Dora was likewise thinking of Mabel as she neared home. Poor old
Mabel, she must be made to come out of her shell. Dora would be
willing to return from Queensland for part of the time before going
to train in a hospital, if Mabel would consent to have some nice
dresses and go to Queensland and have a good holiday.</p>

<p>It was Mabel's hour in all their thoughts.</p>

<p>Each in turn was surprised by the absence of a light in the
kitchen window as they neared the house. They were more surprised
to find no fire on the hearth, the fountain stone cold. Never for
eighteen years had Mabel been absent when they returned at the end
of the day.</p>

<p>Alarm gave place to consternation when they found all in order,
the table laid and a letter addressed to Father. The letter was
short and stiff. Mabel had written so few and was not practised in
affectionate expression. She wrote that she was going to marry Mick
Bell, and then they were going to look at some places on the South
Coast. She had taken Arthur with her. She concluded: "I am sorry
that I spoiled all your lives, and hope now that I am going away
and will have a different name that it will be better for you all.
The calves are in, and I fed the pigs before I left."</p>

<p>She asked nothing, offered nothing beyond the sentence
quoted.</p>

<p>Blankness fell upon each member of her family, blankness that
took all the warmth and satisfaction from the day's triumphs. That
she could produce such an effect by her withdrawal, she no more
than they could have conceived. In that cold, empty hour it was
brought home to them all how much they owed her, how heavily
Bandicoot Homestead and its comfort, its shining order rested on
her thin and slightly stooped shoulders. They had so wanted to tell
her about everything, and she evidently had not cared to hear, did
not need them.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" gasped Mother, feeling as if the underpinning
of existence had given way. "There's everything in this great place
to be done. It's very thoughtless of her to go off suddenly like
this, very undutiful after all that's been done for her." Mother
had never before acknowledged Mabel's indispensability. She herself
had taken credit for being an unexcelled housewife.</p>

<p>"The ingratitude of her, when she had everything that she could
want here, and after what she brought on us," Father tried to roar,
but his utterances sank to a gloomy mutter.</p>

<p>"I think we brought it on ourselves," said Bob with honest
bravery. "What have we ever done for Mabel but let her and her boy
slave from daylight till dark and after, year in and year out, to
make things comfortable for everyone else. You'll never get two men
and two women at good wages to take their places."</p>

<p>"I never turned her out, when I might have done," faltered the
old man.</p>

<p>"That's one good thing. We might have, we were so ignorant and
cruel," said Bob.</p>

<p>Dora burst into sobs of deepest grief without any effort at
dissembling. "I was always a pig to her. I never thought at all. I
wish I could go with her," she wailed. She had never been without
the indulgent and long-suffering Mabel in her life.</p>

<p>"It would kill me to take up all the responsibility and hard
work again," said Mother.</p>

<p>Father broke down too. "What's the good of me flash motor car if
I'm left alone. I've a good mind to set a light to the blasted
thing."</p>

<p>"You'll have to set-to now," said Mother to Dora. "You are
bigger and stronger than Mabel, and have run about idle long
enough. You can't expect me to wait on you."</p>

<p>"I meant to be kinder to her," sobbed Dora, "and now I'll never
get the chance or see her any more."</p>

<p>"She's put up with so much she might forgive us.</p>

<p>"What would you do, Bob, to get her back?" asked Father, the
first time his family had ever seen him in a humble mood.</p>

<p>"Well, by George, if ever anyone has earned a thumping share in
a place, it's Mabel in this one. You could make Mick a small
partner and give Arthur decent wages. He wants a bit more
schooling. It's not too late to make amends. Things could be better
than ever if arranged on a business basis. You and Mother will need
someone to keep you from being lonely as you get on in years."</p>

<p>"Well, let's have something to eat. I'll make the fire, Bob, if
you'll let the horses out, and we'll have to cover that blasted
car. Then we can lay out a plan and write to Mabel by to-morrow's
post."</p>

<p>Father was subdued and amenable, but hopeful. Even Mother was
cheered. "Dora, you make the tea, and see that everything is on the
table, while I change my good things."</p>

<p>It was victoriously Mabel's hour.</p>
