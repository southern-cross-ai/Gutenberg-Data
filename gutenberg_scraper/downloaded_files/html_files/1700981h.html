<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-1" name="ch-1">I</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR Walter Paull of the Criminal
Investigation Branch, Sydney stood in the doorway between the two
offices, gazing before him reflectively. Behind him stood a
white-faced girl, trying to peer fearfully past the Inspector's
large bulk into the inner office.</p>

<p>The room was barely furnished. By the window stood a large, plain,
sloping desk, on which rested a big drawings board and a large
assortment of rulers, paints, inks, etc. Against the wall opposite
the door was an ordinary desk, the swivel chair drawn close to the
knee's aperture. In the chair sat a man leaning back, his head
lolling to one side and turned so that a considerable portion of
his face could be seen from the door. A small book-case and three
plain chairs completed the furnishing of the room.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt but that the man at the desk was dead.
Yet, Paull hesitated to advance into the room. For some moments he
stood scratching his clean-shaven chin carefully; then, carefully
keeping his large bulk between the girl and the desk, he turned.</p>

<p>"Haven't been in there, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;You didn't say what
your name was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anstey, Maude Anstey!"</p>

<p>The girl spoke in low hesitating tones. "No, I haven't been in
there. I couldn't! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there!" Taking the girl by the arm, the Inspector led her
to a chair in the outer office.</p>

<p>"Just a bit of an accident, I should say. Nothing for you to be
frightened about. Now, sit there, m'dear. Have a drink of water?
No? Well, well. Now, Miss&mdash;yes&mdash;Miss Anstey. You rang
Police Headquarters? Quite right. Let me see&mdash;Yes, twenty
minutes ago; just after you got here this morning, eh? Sharp to
time, yes? Ten minutes to ten now; that makes your time to arrive
at half-past nine, eh? Thought so&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Inspector rambled on, waiting for the girl to recover, in
some measure, her composure. For a awhile she sat, shaken, and with
little choking sobs rising irregularly in her throat. At length she
quieted.</p>

<p>"Get here at nine-thirty, don't you?" repeated the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock, sir." She spoke weakly.</p>

<p>"Never mind the 'sir.'" The little cupid-bow mouth twisted to an
expression of distaste. "Call me Inspector, or Mr Paull; I answer
to both&mdash;Except when I'm at home and the missus is wild. Then
to anything she thinks of."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Inspector."</p>

<p>"That's right!" The soft podgy hand of the detective patted the
girl's reassuringly. "Feel better, eh? Well, well! You get here at
nine, eh? What time does Mr. Delaney get here?"</p>

<p>"About half-past, as a rule; sometimes later."</p>

<p>"Irregular, eh? Well, you came in here. Got a key to the
offices, eh? Thought so. Opened the door and walked in.
Now&mdash;was that door open when, you arrived? Think carefully.
Plenty of time! I'm in no hurry, and he&mdash;" Paull shrugged
nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"The door was shut, Mr Paull."</p>

<p>"Didn't go in there at once?"</p>

<p>"Not for some time. I didn't think that Mr. Delaney had
arrived&mdash;and there was nothing for me to do there." The girl
hesitated. "I had a drawing to finish for him by the time he came
and&mdash;and I was a bit behind with it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you settled down to work? Did you finish the drawing?
Yes. You're an artist, eh, like Mr. Delaney? Commercial artist.
Heard of him. Good man, they say. Plenty of work here?"</p>

<p>"Quite a lot." The girl smiled faintly</p>

<p>"Well, well! You went on with the drawing and finished it.
Then&mdash;well, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought I would tidy up Mr Delaney's room. He's&mdash;rather
untidy, you know, like all men."</p>

<p>"Leaves things about and&mdash;" Paull grimaced. "Poor devils,
men!" A slow chuckle came from the thick throat. "Ever thought what
an untidy world this would be, if it weren't for the women, Miss
Anstey? No? Well, take my word for it. So you went in there." He
pointed to the inner office.</p>

<p>"I opened the door."</p>

<p>"Didn't go in? Ah well, perhaps as well."</p>

<p>He paused a moment. "Where's the 'phone? Ah, here on your
desk."</p>

<p>"There's two&mdash;one in Mr Delaney's room. There's a switch
here. I take calls and put them through to him." The girl
illustrated as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Quite neat," Paull nodded. "So you didn't go in there? Rang us
up from here? Good! Now about yourself, m'dear. Feel all right,
now? Able to stay here for a time? Good! May want to ask you some
questions, later. I'll have a little look around, first. He raised
himself from the low chair on which he was seated and strolled to
the inner room, the girl watching him fearfully. At the door he
turned.</p>

<p>"By-the-bye, Miss Anstey. Been long here?"</p>

<p>"Just over six months."</p>

<p>"Clerk, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Apprentice artist." The girl spoke quickly. "I'm here to gain
experience in commercial work."</p>

<p>"Ah! Hm!" Paull nodded; "Well, if anyone calls, or telephones,
just say that Mr. Delaney's engaged, and will be for some time.
That's true&mdash;as true as ever will be. Get their names and make
a list of them. Get me?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. Paull turned to the inner room. Just within the
door he hesitated, glancing about him inquisitively, yet not
allowing his eyes to rest on the dead man. Nothing in the room
appeared to be out of place. There were no signs of a struggle. He
took a few steps forward and peered over the dead man's body at the
desk. On the blotting pad lay a large sketch, covered by a sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>Again Paull scratched his chin. There was an atmosphere in the
room he could not understand. The man had been murdered. From where
he stood the detective could plainly view the swollen distorted
face, the big powerful frame. It seemed impossible that a man of
that build could be done to death without putting up a fight.
Yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Nothing in the room had been disturbed. He bent to the ground
close to the desk, examining the linoleum under the deed man's
feet. A few marks showed, but nothing out of the common. Then
Delaney had died swiftly; almost unknowingly, as he sat alone
before his desk.</p>

<p>The sounds of someone in the outer office brought the detective
to his feet. He went to the door. Miss Anstey was at the counter,
talking to a tall, thin man carrying a bag.</p>

<p>"Ah, doctor! Thought you wouldn't be long after me." Paull
ambled to the counter and lifted up the flap.</p>

<p>"Come in. I want your opinion on things before
anything&mdash;or&mdash;well, you know&mdash;is moved."</p>

<p>He preceded the doctor into the inner office and stood on one
side while the medical man made his examination. In a few minutes
the doctor turned, shrugging.</p>

<p>"How long, Dr. Carter?"</p>

<p>"About twelve to fourteen hours!"</p>

<p>"Hm! Eight to ten o'clock last night!" Paull mused a moment;
then turned in the doorway. "Miss Anstey, what time did you leave
work last night?"</p>

<p>"Five o'clock, Inspector."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Delaney was still here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Said he was going to work late?"</p>

<p>"He usually, did, Mr. Paull." The girl hesitated. "He never did
much work in the daytime&mdash;drawing, I mean. Used to be in and
out; rarely at his desk. Late in the afternoon he would commence
work. I nearly always left him here. He would go out to dinner
about six and then come back and work on."</p>

<p>"Late?"</p>

<p>"Till about ten o'clock&mdash;sometimes later."</p>

<p>Paull nodded. He turned again to face the doctor. "Cause of
death?" he asked casually.</p>

<p>"Want me to tell you?" The medical man pointed to the thin cord
embedded in the flesh of the neck. "That's
plain&mdash;strangulation&mdash;and by someone who knew what they
were doing."</p>

<p>Paull stepped to the side of the dead man and bent to examine
the cord.</p>

<p>"Nothing out of the ordinary here, doctor. Stuff you can buy in
any shop, almost. Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Want that cord, Inspector?" Dr. Carter placed his bag on the
desk and opened it.</p>

<p>"Hmmm&mdash;Yes." Paull frowned. "The cord's not worth much; but
the knot now, that's interesting. Can you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Course!" A few deft movements and the cord came away from the
flesh. The doctor handed it to the detective, who placed it on the
desk. "That all you want from me?"</p>

<p>"For the time&mdash;and here," the detective nodded. "Thanks.
I'll want you to see our friend later, of course. But
now&mdash;well, the ambulance men are here and before I examine
things we'll send him on a journey."</p>

<p>Paull accompanied the doctor to the door and out into the
corridor. There, as he expected, he found the ambulance men,
waiting. A few minutes and the body was carried out of the office.
Paull shut the door with a sigh of relief and walked over to where
Miss Anstey sat at her desk.</p>

<p>"Mr. Delaney married, miss?"</p>

<p>"No." The girl hesitated. "There was a young lady who used to
call sometimes."</p>

<p>"Hm! Engaged?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"Any relations?"</p>

<p>"A brother, Ernest Delaney. He's a printer&mdash;manager for
Ferroll and Royce."</p>

<p>"A printer, eh?" The detective took a toothpick from his pocket
and chewed it meditatively. "Commercial artist and a printer. Ah!
Hm! Well, give the gentleman a ring and tell him that his
brother&mdash;say, what's his name?"</p>

<p>"David, Mr. Paull."</p>

<p>"Say that brother David has met with an accident. Get me?
Accident! Say he'd better come round here, at once. That's all,
'cept&mdash;Any 'phones while I was in there?"</p>

<p>"A Mr. Matthews rang up."</p>

<p>"Who's he?"</p>

<p>"A friend of Mr. Delaney's, Mr. Paull."</p>

<p>"What's his line?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Hm! Anyone else?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Persus rang up. He wanted to see Mr. Delaney as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>"Mr. Persus! Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Delaney used to buy copper plates off him, Mr. Paull."</p>

<p>"Copper plates?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Delaney used to make wonderful etchings." The girl pointed
to some frames on the wall. Paull strolled around examining the
etchings. They were certainly beautiful examples of the
art&mdash;even to the detective's inexpert eyes. "No one else?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Paull nodded and returned to the inner office, closing the door
after him. Again he made a rapid survey of the room. Its order and
exactness exasperated him. A murder should not be committed in such
surroundings. The criminal should leave some signs of his presence!
An overturned chair&mdash;something smashed! But, here was
nothing&mdash;nothing but the empty chair where the dead man sat.
And before the chair a large square of cardboard, covered with a
sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Sometime between eight and ten o'clock on the previous evening
David Delaney had sat at that desk, at work. Someone had stealthily
entered the room creeping up behind him. The sudden cast of a thin
strong cord&mdash;a strangled cry! The sudden tension of the cord;
a gasp&mdash;and the deed was accomplished. David Delaney had
ceased to exist!</p>

<p>But, what had the murdered man been doing at the time of his
death? He had not been working. The covered drawing showed that.
Yet if he had finished work and covered the drawing for the night,
how had his attention been engrossed so that the murderer could
steal up to him? If there was one thing certain, it was that
Delaney had considered that he was alone in the offices.</p>

<p>Paull frowned perplexedly. There was a mystery here&mdash;one he
could not fathom. With a sudden gesture of impatience he drew out
the chair and sat down before the desk. He leaned forward, drawing
imaginary lines on the paper before him. Yes, in the quietness of
the evening it would have been possible for a man to steal up
behind him&mdash;to attack him unawares. But Delaney had finished
work. He had covered his drawing. That meant that he had finished
for the night. It was reasonable to suppose that he was on the
point of rising from his chair to leave the offices.
Then&mdash;</p>

<p>A quick examination of the surface of the paper and Paull lifted
it from the drawing&mdash;to sit back, with an exclamation of
astonishment. On the cardboard was a complete drawing of a man
seated in a chair, bending forward over a desk, at work. Behind him
was a crouching figure, holding over the seated man's head a
slender cord! A revulsion of feeling, shook, the portly frame of
the detective, as with ague. Delaney had been strangled while he
sat at his desk before his work&mdash;at work on the sketch of a
man being strangled at work!</p>

<p>The idea was fantastic&mdash;almost unbelievable. For long
minutes Paull sat, staring at the sketch. Then, something on the
upper edge of the cardboard attracted his attention. They were
three little, dark, round objects. He picked up one, to drop it in
disgust. Three small dead snails! How had they come to be on the
drawing the dead man had been engaged upon a few seconds before he
met his death?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-2" name="ch-2">II</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"THREE snails!" Paull murmured the words, a grim
smile playing around his lips. "The three snails! Now, what the
devil are they doing here&mdash;in a common-place commercial
office. A market garden&mdash;and a fellow would understand! Even
an ordinary garden would help&mdash;or a window box, but&mdash;" He
pursed his lips in a low whistle&mdash;then laughed,
noiselessly.</p>

<p>Picking up a pencil he flicked the little round objects until
they rolled down the cardboard to the edge of the desk. He took a
powerful magnifying glass from his pocket and carefully scrutinised
the shells. So far as he could see they were innocent of any
foreign marks.</p>

<p>"No fingerprints! No marks!" He shook, his head sadly. "Now,
what's a fat policeman going to do if crooks forget to leave their
'cards' about? T'isn't fair! All this scientific stuff is hampering
the police. What's it all going to come to? Why, they'll want the
police to attend University lectures soon&mdash;same as they do
journalists&mdash;and then&mdash;Lord! We'll not only do our
detecting work but we'll be writing our own account of the crimes
for the newspapers. Oh, hell!"</p>

<p>Emptying out a match-box he swept the three snails into it and
stowed the box: in his pocket. Again he let his attention revert to
the sketch. A careful scanning of the drawing, and he half-turned
in the swivel chair.</p>

<p>"Miss Anstey!" He waited until the girl came to the dividing
door. "Oh, come on in, there's nothing here to bite you&mdash;or I
wouldn't be here, myself. Have a look at this. Mr. Delaney's work?
'Course! Jolly good eh? Seen it before?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Paull," the girl replied promptly. "It's for a story.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>She bent to the desk and from a drawer pulled out a bundle of
printers' proofs.</p>

<p>"Here it is. Mr. Delaney asked me to read the story and mark the
places where I thought it would illustrate."</p>

<p>"So!" Paull was surprised. "In a story, eh? Well, Well! So Mr.
Delaney illustrates a story and&mdash;and dies the same way,
sitting looking at his work. That's a newie. Hm! There's something
in this. Now, let's see&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He sat back in his chair, pondering deeply, the girl standing
beside him, curiosity in her eyes. The Inspector was acknowledging
himself frankly puzzled. During his service he had solved many
problems&mdash;some of them bringing to him great credit and
promotion&mdash;mainly by an inability to acknowledge defeat. But
here, in this office, he had a case where none of the ordinary
methods of detection would serve.</p>

<p>David Delaney had been murdered while illustrating a story of a
murder! The murder had been committed in a manner exactly similar
to that depicted by the artist. Then the murderer had been
acquainted not only with the story but with the actual lines that
the artist had decided to illustrate&mdash;or there had been a
coincidence far out of the common. Again, the murderer had known
that David Delaney had been commissioned to illustrate the story.
Paull shook his head. Here was a situation bizarre to an absurdity!
With a shrug Paull pulled the proofs of the story before him and
scanned the heading:</p>
<br>

<p class="headline">THE ATELIER MURDER!<br>
By Austin Farnborough.</p>

<p>With nervous fingers, he turned the long slips of paper,
watching for the heavy double pencil marks on the margin that
indicated the words the artist was to illustrate. In a few minutes
he found the lines:</p>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">The door opened slowly. Into the darkened room
crept a shadow. For some seconds it hovered behind the chair on
which the artist sat; then moved swiftly. A strangled cry; a
throaty gurgle, and the man fell back in his chair&mdash;dead.</p>

<p><br>
"Humph!" Paull leaned back in the seat scowling. "Couldn't have
described it better myself." He pushed back the chair and turned
his attention to the drawers of the desk. There was nothing of
consequence in them. He turned to the desk-top. Under a pile of
papers he found a thin copper plate&mdash;blank. "Interesting!" The
detective turned to where the girl had stood, but she had
disappeared.</p>

<p>A little chuckle came from his lips, immediately suppressed. He
struggled to his feet and wandered to the door, expecting to find
the artist-apprentice in the outer office, but she was not
there.</p>

<p>"Feelings overcame her, eh?" Again he chuckled, wandering over
to the high table on which the girl worked. There was nothing on it
that interested him; only the usual paraphernalia of the studio.
"Ah, well!"</p>

<p>He heard the click of the door-lock but did not turn.</p>

<p>"Miss Anstey!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!" The strange voice caught his attention. In
spite of his bulk he whirled round, quickly.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" He surveyed the pretty girl on the other side of the
counter, quizzically. "I'm not used to keeping office, y'know,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Delaney in?" Without waiting for a reply the girl lifted
the counter-flap and passed into the outer office, making for the
inner room. Paull quietly interposed between her and the door.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Again?" A bright smile flashed on the girl's face. "Is being
sorry a habit of yours?"</p>

<p>"Always&mdash;when I have to disappoint a charm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks!" A moue pursed the girl's lips. "Then Mr. Delaney is
not in?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid&mdash;he's out&mdash;right out!" Paull spoke slowly,
looking restlessly towards the outer door for the girl artist. "I'm
afraid he'll be out for quite a time."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" The girl paused, undecided, for a moment: "Perhaps if
I wait?"</p>

<p>"You may have to wait a long time, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you are busy, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;" The girl mimicked,
laughingly.</p>

<p>"Paull, Walter Paull," The Inspector interposed hurriedly. "Of
course, I shall be delighted if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Delaney's partner, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Walter Paull?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;hardly that. I'm&mdash;er&mdash;sort of interested
in him at the moment. Not attached here&mdash;nor anywhere else.
Just drop in when anything happens, y'know."</p>

<p>Where the devil had the girl got to?</p>

<p>"Miss Anstey's out for the moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>He tried to remember if the girl-artist had told him the name of
Delaney's fiancée. No, he hadn't asked that question. What
the&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you an appointment?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Paull. Do you suggest that I should have rung up Mr.
Delaney and asked for an interview? It's not very usual
between&mdash;" she hesitated and swung round at the opening of the
office door. "Why&mdash;Bill! Fancy you coming here! Have you come
to see David? Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Paull says he's out&mdash;and he's
so rude&mdash;he won't let me into David's private room."</p>

<p>"Sorry, miss." A couple of strides brought the detective to the
door of the inner room. He flung it open with a flourish. "If I'd
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you!" The girl gave a little mocking curtsy as she passed
into the inner room. The young man was about to follow her when
Paull tapped him on the shoulder significantly.</p>

<p>"Just a moment. Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sinclair! Bill Sinclair!" The young man looked puzzled. "I
don't recognise you here. Has anything happened to David?"</p>

<p>"A bit." Paull nodded suggestively towards the other room.
"There's been an acci&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bill!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dora."</p>

<p>"Come here! I want you."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind a moment, miss, it's a matter of
business."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The girl rose and came to where Paull stood.</p>

<p>"Now I thought&mdash;I may have been mistaken&mdash;but I really
thought that I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dora!"</p>

<p>"Bill!" They both laughed. Paull looked from one to the other
somewhat amazedly. The girl glimpsed his face, and laughed anew.

<p>"The joke's on me!" The detective made a gesture of resignation. "Mr. Sinclair, if you'll explain."</p>

<p>"Explain Dora!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" The girl mocked. "No one has succeeded in that,
so far&mdash;even mother couldn't. David tried; then Bill."</p>

<p>The Inspector threw up his hands. "I'm beat! Mr. Sinclair, will
you please introduce me to this young lady. I suggested to her some
little while ago that I would like to know her name,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss&mdash;er&mdash;" the girl laughed.</p>

<p>"Delaney." The young man concluded.</p>

<p>"Miss Delaney?" The detective was staggered. "And I thought you
were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Anstey!" Sinclair turned towards the outer door as the
apprentice artist entered the studio. "Will Mr. Delaney be long?
This gentleman says he's out. I came to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meet me, Bill." Dora Delaney dimpled wickedly. "Now boy, don't
deny it. You know I 'phoned you just before I left home and said I
was coming here." She turned to the detective. "I'm rather worried
about my brother, Mr. Paull. He never came home last night.
Brothers&mdash;modern brothers&mdash;are really awful! So trying to
real sisters. They go out and no one can guess when they will come
home again&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective nodded, a worried frown on his brows.</p>

<p>"And the modern girl, Dora&mdash;" commenced Sinclair.</p>

<p>"Is no lower than an angel," Dora concluded. "But that doesn't
answer my question. David didn't come home last night&mdash;so I
came here for an explanation&mdash;and I'm going to have a good
one!" She paused, then continued: "There are but two of us, Mr.
Paull&mdash;David and me. He's a great boy, my brother, but of
course, I have to look after him, carefully."</p>

<p>"Women always do." Paull remarked, ponderously. "It's a habit
they acquired from an ancestress&mdash;looking after
men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Paull!"</p>

<p>"They look after their brothers&mdash;until they think they want
a change, then they take on the job of looking after some other
girl's brother. If they want a change after that there's a special
court of law to oblige them&mdash;but then&mdash;the public knows
they didn't do their job properly! Looking after the other girl's
brother&mdash;I mean."</p>

<p>"Well!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Delaney's out." The detective assumed command of the
situation. "There's been a bit of trouble here. I'm going to ask
you to go into the inner room, Miss Delaney, with Miss Anstey, and
let her explain."</p>

<p>Paull carefully avoided catching the girl-artist's eyes. "While
she's talking to you I'll have a word with Mr. Sinclair here."</p>

<p>There was something in the Inspector's voice that sobered the
mocking retort on Dora's lips. Without a word she went into the
private room. As he closed the door behind the girls, Sinclair
looked significantly at the detective, raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Paull nodded.</p>

<p>"Trouble? Bad?" The young man queried.</p>

<p>"Worse than that. I'm Inspector Walter Paull. That his
sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;not quite his&mdash;his brother-in-law."</p>

<p>"So!" For the moment the detective hesitated. "Perhaps I'd
better tell you quick, before Miss Anstey blurts it out to her.
Delaney's dead!"</p>

<p>"Dead?"</p>

<p>"Murdered."</p>

<p>"Good God!"

<p>Strangled while working at his desk." The Inspector
spoke in almost a whisper. "Strange, but he had just finished a
drawing of a man sitting at his desk, with a strangler creeping on
him from behind and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Sinclair clutched the detective's arm.
"Strangled!"</p>

<p>"Just as it was described in the story," Paull nodded. "A story
by a writer named Austin Farnborough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My story!"</p>

<p>"Yours!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, I understand&mdash;but I write under the name of
Austin Farnborough. That story was for the Critic and I persuaded
Manning to get Delaney to illustrate it. You say&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It was just as you wrote it in the story." Suspicion deepened
in the detective's eyes. "The man who killed Delaney must have read
that story&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Written it!" Sinclair completed the detective's accusation.
"But, I didn't strangle David. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you didn't, who did?" Paull shot the question at the young
man. "There he sat, just as he had pictured the man in the story
sat, with the assassin creeping up behind him. There's not an
iota of difference between the two scenes. Why, Delaney had even
drawn in his office setting. He drew the story&mdash;the
scene&mdash;then someone acted it. Who could have done that but
the man who wrote the story?"</p>

<p>A look of dumb despair grew on the young man's face. He glanced
about him; as if seeking some means of escape. Paull's eyes
hardened. He took a step forward, his hand outstretched towards
Bill Sinclair' shoulder.</p>

<p>"William Sinclair, I arrest you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" The door of the inner room was flung open and Dora rushed
in. "No, no!" He never did it! "Bill! Bill! Why don't you speak.
Tell him&mdash;tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me what the three snails, arranged along the top edge of
the drawing mean?" Paull spoke in hard, level tones.</p>

<p>"The three snails?"</p>

<p>With a moan of despair Sinclair turned and threw himself into a
chair. "The three snails."</p>

<p>With a quick motion Paull produced the match-box and tilted the
three round black objects into the palm of his hand, holding them
under the young man's eyes. "Look! I say, look! What do those three
dead snails mean?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-3" name="ch-3">III</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FOR many seconds there was silence in the room.
Bill Sinclair sat with his head in his hands; Dora standing beside
him, flashing indignant glances at the Inspector. Paull stood
stolid and efficient before the pair, his hand outstretched and, on
the palm, three small black dead snails.</p>

<p>"There's a story here." The detective spoke, at length. "And I'm
going to have it. Make up your mind to that, Mr. Sinclair. I want a
satisfactory explanation of these three snails&mdash;and what they
stand for. Afterwards, well, I'll hear how you spent last night
between the hours of six and twelve."</p>

<p>"You are going to arrest him for the murder of my brother?" The
girl gasped, slightly.</p>

<p>"That depends." Paull nodded slowly. "I'll hear what Mr.
Sinclair has to say, first. I may be a policeman and I may be fat,
but I'm not unjust or arbitrary, although there's more than one who
say I fling my weight about more than a bit. Just as if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bill." Dora turned to the young, man. "Tell me! Bill! I want to
know. I must know. You know nothing about&mdash;about
David's&mdash;death?"</p>

<p>"Not very much." Bill Sinclair had recovered from the first
shock. He now sat upright, raising his head. A slight shudder shook
him as his eyes fell on the three snails in the detective's
hand.</p>

<p>"And these&mdash;things?" Paull spoke sternly.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You don't know?" The detective spoke with expressive unbelief.
"Funny that! You take one long look at the things and then almost
chuck a faint. Start moaning about the 'three snails' and look as
if the end of the world has come&mdash;well, if not that, then
prohibition. And then you say, you don't know. Can't you think up
something better?"</p>

<p>"I don't really know!" Bill stood up and shook himself. The
colour returned to his cheeks and he squared his shoulders. Turning
to the girl he slipped his arm around her.</p>

<p>"You believe me, Dora?"</p>

<p>"Of course." The girl flashed defiance at the detective.</p>

<p>"You don't know&mdash;but you can guess&mdash;something."</p>

<p>"That's just it." Bill turned to the detective. "Let's get in
the inner room and&mdash;and&mdash;well, in your words&mdash;I'll
come clean. That's what you want?"</p>

<p>Paull nodded. For a moment he paused, and then led the way to
the inner room. He stood aside for the girl and young man to pass
in; then, as Miss Anstey made to follow he half-barred her passage.
She looked up at him in surprise, and he shrugged.</p>

<p>"No, I won't disappoint you." He laughed slightly. "I was going
to tell you to take care of the outer office&mdash;but you know too
much. If I keep you out you'll speculate&mdash;and that leads to
gossip in a woman. Come in; we'll hear if anyone comes into the
office; but keep what you hear under you
hat&mdash;<i>sabe</i>?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded and passed into the room. Paull waited until the
others were seated, and then sat down in the dead man's chair,
before the desk. He swung the chair half-round and looked at
Sinclair, expectantly.</p>

<p>"You found the three snails on the desk, you say?" The young man
asked the question.</p>

<p>"On the cardboard&mdash;just above the drawing, yes."</p>

<p>"On the drawing?" Sinclair came across to the desk and bent
down, peering at the illustration. He shuddered slightly and turned
quickly to his chair, beside the girl.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I know," he commenced hesitatingly. "If you
can make head and tail of it well, you're cleverer than I. I've
puzzled over it, again and again, trying to understand&mdash;and
the more I've thought of the affair the more perplexing it
appears." He paused a moment, then continued.</p>

<p>"The first time the snails appeared I came in here with David.
We had been out to lunch together and for some reason I can't now
remember I came back here with him, instead of going home to work.
You know. I'm an author&mdash;Austin Farnborough."</p>

<p>Paull nodded.</p>

<p>Dora looked up, flashing a bright smile at the young man.</p>

<p>"We came in here&mdash;David and I&mdash;arguing over
something." Sinclair continued. "David led the way and as he came
through the door he blocked out sight of the desk from me&mdash;you
know he's more than a size larger than I am?"</p>

<p>Again Paull nodded. He had mentally noted that the dead man had
stood well up towards six feet and broad in proportion. Sinclair,
on the other hand, was not more than five-feet, eight inches, and
slight in build. "First I knew was when David, staggered back,
stamping on my toes, and nearly knocking me down. I managed to
prise him up and push him into the room. Then I saw the snail."</p>

<p>"The snail?" Paull exclaimed, astonished.</p>

<p>"One snail." A slight smile came on Sinclair's lips. "One
solitary snail&mdash;By the bye, Inspector, will you be so kind as
to place the three snails where you found them?"</p>

<p>Paull turned to the desk and placed the three snails along the
top, edge of the cardboard, about an inch apart, and half an inch
from the edge. He then covered the drawing and snails with the
sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"That's right, except for the covering paper." The author
nodded. "I remember well, for after the second appearance of the
snails I took full note of how and where they, were placed."</p>

<p>He turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"You see, Dora, the whole thing was bizarre&mdash;and I thought
that I could later be able to use the incident in a story."</p>

<p>"But you said there was only one snail?" interjected Paull.</p>

<p>"The first time, yes. I told you that David stumbled back on me,
nearly knocking me down. I pushed him into the room and into a
chair. Then I closed the door and turned to him. He was staring at
the drawing on his desk. Right in the centre of the top edge was
one small black snail."</p>

<p>"Mr. Delaney seemed alarmed at the sight of it?" suggested?
Paull.</p>

<p>"I should say he was." Sinclair smiled. "For a moment he was
little more than a gibbering idiot. I got him a glass of
water&mdash;had to go to the outer office for it. When I, got back
the snail had disappeared but there was a bit of a mess on the
linoleum just before the desk."</p>

<p>"That was about a fortnight, ago." Maude Anstey interrupted. "I
remember you coming out for the water. Then you insisted that Mr.
Delaney went home. I came in here later and saw the&mdash;the
squashed snail on the floor."</p>

<p>"I thought he had done that." The author smiled. "It was the
only way I could explain the disappearance of the snail. I knew he
wouldn't put it in his pocket. The strange thing is that, exactly a
week later, a similar incident happened&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A week exactly." Miss Anstey spoke excitedly. "No, a week ago,
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Then the snails appeared at weekly intervals?" the detective
mused.</p>

<p>"So it appears." Sinclair hesitated. "I happened to come in late
that afternoon. David had just entered the office. In fact I was
in the corridor, talking to a friend and waiting for him to come
up. I saw him leave the elevator and come in here. I left my friend
and followed him in. Miss Anstey was not in the office at the
moment and I went direct to the inner room. David was seated in
that chair before his desk, his head in his hands, rocking
himself, and moaning audibly."</p>

<p>"Well?" The Inspector queried as the author paused.

<p>"I asked him
what was the matter, and at first he wouldn't answer. I pressed
him, thinking that something might have happened that I could help
him with." He hesitated and smiled at the girl. "I'm not a rich
man&mdash;no author can be in Australia&mdash;but I had a pound or
two to spare&mdash;to help Dora's brother."

<p>Dora looked up quickly
and pressed the young man's hand. Paull waited a moment before he
spoke.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>David groaned.</p>

<p>"'The jig's up,'" he said. "I asked him what he meant. He
replied, 'You can't help Bill. I've got myself in a devil of a hole
and I must find my own way out.' It was then I noticed the two
snails perched at the head of his drawing&mdash;and remembered the
incident of the snail the previous week. I pointed to the snails
and asked: 'Anything to do with them, David?' He did not answer
directly. For some seconds he sat silent, then muttered: 'When you
see three snails there, Bill&mdash;look after Dora! I won't be able
to.'"</p>

<p>"What did he mean?" asked Paull, much perplexed.</p>

<p>"That I cannot say." The author replied, promptly. "His manner
didn't encourage me to ask questions. I let the matter drop
intending to reopen it later. Hadn't a chance, though. The next day
I got a commission to write six stories for the Critic. That was
too good to miss, although it meant sticking tightly to my desk for
a few weeks. I got Manning, the Editor, to commission David to make
illustrations. That's why I came round here today. I wanted to see
what David was doing with them."</p>

<p>"Umph!" Paull glanced from the man to the girl. "I understood
that you came here to see Miss Dora?"</p>

<p>"Well, what if he did?" The girl spoke sharply. "Early Victorian
or Edwardian, Mr. Paull?"</p>

<p>"Now that's where you and my missus would have words," Paull
drawled, stroking his triple chins complacently. "She says that
when there's girls about I'm a modern of the very latest Georgian
era."</p>

<p>Dora laughed, gently. She turned to her lover. "That all, Bill?"
Then in a very low voice: "Poor David!"</p>

<p>"So that's all you know, Mr. Sinclair?" Paull asked the
question.</p>

<p>"There is one other thing I think I should mention." Yet the
young man hesitated. "Just before I left David on the last
occasion&mdash;when the two snails appeared&mdash;I asked him,
bluntly, if there was anything I could do&mdash;money, y'know. He
shook his head and pulled out a drawer, taking from it a bundle of
notes! There were two or three fives, a couple of tens, and at
least three twenties."</p>

<p>"About how many notes in the roll?" asked the detective
quickly.</p>

<p>"About a dozen&mdash;but they weren't in a roll." The author
frowned. "They were new notes, quite clean and uncreased."</p>

<p>"A dozen notes&mdash;fives, tens and twenties!" Paull meditated.
"Three twenties&mdash;that's sixty pounds; a couple of tens, brings
the total to eighty; four fives would make the clean hundred. Agree
to that, Mr. Sinclair?"</p>

<p>"I should say you have given a fair estimate of the notes."</p>

<p>"Then he wasn't in want of money." Paull nodded. "What did he do
with the money? Put it in his pocket?"</p>

<p>"No. He took one of the twenties from the packet and placed it
on the desk. The others he replaced in the drawer."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"I told him that he was foolish to keep all that money in an
office desk. He grunted, and answered so shortly that I got out, as
quick as possible. As I have said, I did not see him
afterwards."</p>

<p>For some moments the detective sat, staring at the drawing on
the desk. At length his podgy hand moved lightly over the papers on
the desk. He found what he wanted and turned to the young man, his
hand extended. "Know that, Mr. Sinclair?"</p>

<p>"Yes." For a moment the young man hesitated. "David used a lot
of them. He was an exceedingly fine etcher. That's an etching
plate."</p>

<p>"Hm! Small though." Paull's hand went to his waistcoat pocket
and reappeared with a ten shilling note between his fingers. He
spread it carefully on the plate. It fitted well, leaving a fair
printing margin all round.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Dora sprang to her feet, her face aflame
with indignation. "Are you inferring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Testing all possibilities, Miss Delaney," Paull answered
imperturbably. "Now, this plate&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, as three slow knocks sounded from the outer office.
In a single second he was at the door, wrenching it open. He sprang
into the outer office and looked around. The place was empty. With
an angry exclamation he ran to the flap in the counter&mdash;to
jump back with a shout of astonishment. On the centre of the flap,
at intervals of about an inch, were arranged three small black
snails.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-4" name="ch-4">IV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR PAULL was seated in the small
dining-room of his house at Bourden Road, Ashfield. On the
mahogany-topped table before him lay a strange collection of
articles, all of them associated with the murder of David Delaney.
Outside, it was raining. The wind, driving the rain in thick gusts
before it, rattled on the windows like a charge of buck-shot. Paull
shivered. Although it was only early autumn the rain had brought a
distinct coldness in the air. The detective was engrossed in the
problem before him, yet once he looked up as a particularly
violent, gust rattled doors and windows and swayed the walls of the
house, to return immediately to a concentrated contemplation of the
articles on the table.</p>

<p>They were few. A large sketch of a man seated at a desk,
drawing; and behind him a menacing figure creeping up, intent on
murder. On right side of the drawing was placed six small, black
snails, and on the left a thin plate of metal and a length of cord
with a knot in it.</p>

<p>There was little there to trace a man guilty of the sin of murder,
yet Paull did not despair. The three snails! Twice on the one day
he had seen the three snails and then again within a bare couple of
hours. He had found the first three on the desk at which the dead
man sat. The second three had come on the office counter while he
had been investigating the inner room.</p>

<p>The thought brought a smile to his pursed lips.</p>

<p>Many years' police work had taught him that the most dangerous
criminal is the one who commits his crime and then leaves matters
to follow their normal course. The criminal who tries to control or
assist fate, plays directly into the hands of the police.</p>

<p>Men who represented themselves by the sign of the 'Three Snails'
had murdered David Delaney. They had done their foul work well, yet
had hot been content to leave it. They had feared enquiries; they
had tried to threaten him, and in doing so were playing directly
into his hands. Now he awaited their next move, confident that it
would offer him one more link in the chain of evidence he was
trying to build.</p>

<p>Yet as he turned to the table, he sighed. The few articles
before him represented almost a minimum of clues. They were all he
could find in the dead man's offices bearing on the murder.
They&mdash;and the story the young man&mdash;Sinclair&mdash;had
told. He had searched the offices thoroughly, yet one thing he
lacked. He wanted the packet of banknotes Sinclair had mentioned
in his story. He wanted to find a meaning behind the banknotes; he
wanted the connection between the banknotes and the Three Snails.
He could guess&mdash;and he did; but there was little of the
substance of evidence in the theory he had constructed, covering
the few facts he had in hand.</p>

<p>In some way, David Delaney had come in contact with men from
Sydney's underworld. In some manner they had obtained a hold over
him. They had demanded from him certain work. What work? David
Delaney was an artist. Then, it was possible to believe that the
work was connected with Delaney's general occupation&mdash;or his
hobby. And that hobby was etching. Paull remembered asking Dora
Delaney if her brother had made money from his etching, and the
girl had shaken her head.</p>

<p>Again Paull spread a banknote on the metal plate. It fitted,
but the margin around the note was irregular. For some moments he
sat back, pondering then levered himself to his feet, scrambled to
the door.</p>

<p>"Mary!" he called, gently.</p>

<p>Heavy footsteps sounded on the upper floor of the house.</p>

<p>"Mary, got a fiver about?"</p>

<p>"Me?" A stout, pleasant-featured woman came to the head of the
stairs. "Me and a fiver! Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just the fiver, Mary dear." Paull rubbed the lowest of his
triple chins, thoughtfully. "For the time I'll spare you&mdash;the
fiver will be sufficient&mdash;yes, for the time!"</p>

<p>Mary chuckled delightedly. "Just like all you men!" She
commenced to descend the stairs, slowly. "Leave your lawful wives
at home to do the cleanin' and cookin' and go ambling off to Paris
House, or the Ambassadors with some bit of frock. Oh, you men! And
of all men&mdash;why did I ever marry a policeman?"</p>

<p>"'Cos you wanted taking care of, darling." Paull matched her
laughter with, a subdued rumbling that shook his large frame.
"Sure, if you hadn't married me you'd have been in Long Bay
today&mdash;an' you know it, so don't deny it. Now, as to that
fiver?"</p>

<p>"Me and a fiver!" The stout woman tapped the detective on his
broad chest. "And what might Walter Paull be wanting with a fiver
on a night when all decent men choose to stay at home?"</p>

<p>"Lor'." The Inspector groaned, "she calls a detective a decent
man. Don't you know the company they keep, honey? Rogues, thieves
and vagabonds! Why, if it weren't for the uniform&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fine one you'd look in uniform&mdash;if you could find or build
one to fit you." Mary Paull passed her husband and went into the
dining-room, looking inquisitively at the articles on the
table.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Taking to collecting snails! Well, I could find you better
ones than those on my dahlias, boy&mdash;prettier ones, too; but I
hate the beastly things. I can't bring myself to handle them. I
have to knock them off into a tin of salt and water&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Salting them down for a rainy day?" Paull chuckled loudly at
his small joke.</p>

<p>"Getting away from the fiver question." The stout woman laughed,
gently. "Who's the girl, Walter? Don't mind me knowing, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, old girl." Paull's arm slid rounds his wife's ample
waist. "Name's Mary. Good-looker, though she runs slightly to
weight of late years. Shows her good taste&mdash;copying her fancy
boy?"</p>

<p>"Go on, you!" The hand that tapped the Inspector's cheek was not
light, although affectionate. She disengaged herself from Paull's
arm and went to the corner of the room. From under the corner of
the carpet she took a five-pound note and brought it to him.</p>

<p>"Now, don't waste it, dear."</p>

<p>"Lor'! An' she's been married to a detective for more'n twenty
years!" Paull groaned. "Keeps her loose change in a vase and her
solid cash under the edge of a carpet. Well, well!"</p>

<p>"What if I do?" Mrs. Paull bridled. "There's some people I know
of as can't keep cash at all, at all. Thank the lord, I've got a
husband who brings a cheque home, not cash. Good thing, too, if he
had cash, he'd lend it, like&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mary became silent. For some moments Paull looked at his wife, a
grin on his face. He slipped an arm around her, drawing her to a
chair he set close beside the one he had occupied at the table.</p>

<p>"Thinking of Mrs. Milestone, Mary!"</p>

<p>"Aye." The woman turned and drew out his pocket handkerchief to
wipe her eyes. "Poor woman; got a journalist for a
husband&mdash;and never a bean in the house. He gets big money and
gets away with it big, lends money to other journalists and then
has to try to borrow it back. Them journalists never have
money&mdash;although they earn plenty. They&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alice Maplestone been here today?"</p>

<p>"What if she has?" Mary shifted; uneasily on her chair. "She
came to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To borrow a quid&mdash;and you let her have it." Paull shook a
finger at his wife. "Thought I was the one at fault, lending
money?"</p>

<p>"The poor woman hadn't a cent in the house," Mary defied.</p>

<p>"And today only Saturday. Maplestone gets paid Friday," Paull
commented.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see her starve&mdash;and now you're wanting
fivers, Walter. If you're going out on wet nights to the
Ambassadors we shan't have many of them left&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll have to take up the carpets, eh, what?" Paull chuckled.
"Ah, well, old dear, we won't starve, even if you do lend quids to
writer-chaps' wives."</p>

<p>"And as for that fiver you're making all that fuss
about&mdash;just look here. What's this metal plate for?"</p>

<p>He smoothed out the note and placed it carefully on the plate.
It fitted exactly, with an inch margin all round. Paull looked up,
to catch his wife's eyes. She nodded. "Came from that poor fellow's
office?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The David Delaney case." Paull nodded. "You caught it in one,
old girl. Yes, that plate's for banknote engraving."</p>

<p>"Bit thick, isn't it?" Mrs. Paull was turning it over, on her
hand. "Why, Walter, it looks like two plates&mdash;a thick and a
thin one stuck together."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" Paull bestowed but a cursory glance on the plate held
out to him by his wife. He was arranging six dead snails in a row
along the edge of the table. "Now, Mary, you're clever. Explain
these?"</p>

<p>"Ugh! The nasty things!" Very gingerly she touched one of the
shells with the tip of a finger. "Dead and dry&mdash;and six of
them?"</p>

<p>"Three on his desk when we found him and three more on the
counter in the outer office when someone thought I was getting too
hot on the trail."</p>

<p>"Three snails." Mary Paull tucked her husband's handkerchief in
his pocket, arranging it methodically.</p>

<p>"Three dead snails&mdash;looks to me like a sign, Walter.</p>

<p>"And is, on&mdash;What's that?" From the direction of the window
came the sounds of cutting wet glass with a diamond&mdash;a long,
slow grating sound. With finger to his lips, Paull rose to his feet
and moved in the direction of the sound. At the window, he
released the spring blind with a jerk. Immediately the sound
ceased. He peered through the window out on the rain-swept street.
A standard lamp was immediately opposite his front gate and he
could see the dim outlines of his little front garden as well as
the street beyond. There was no one in sight.</p>

<p>"Getting old&mdash;getting nervy!" Paull complained. He mounted
a chair and pulled down the blind.</p>

<p>"Somebody was there," Mary Paull asserted positively.</p>

<p>"Then they jumped up on to the roof to escape." The detective
laughed. "They couldn't have even got to the road before I was at
the window, m'dear."</p>

<p>"No." The woman spoke doubtfully. "I heard them cutting the
glass when you had your hand on the blind."</p>

<p>"Nerves!" Paull shook his head slowly. "Effects of a misplaced
youth&mdash;That's right misplaced&mdash;Lost it so long ago that
I've forgotten just where. Say, Mary old girl, we've had our time,
eh? Hasn't been bad, has it? You've stood by me like a real brick
and I've stuck tight to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stuck tight! Should think so." Mary shook with suppressed
laughter. "Let me tell you, Walter there aren't many husbands in
Ashfield as would stay in, wet night or fine, if their wives handed
them five pound notes when they asked for them. Stuck
ti&mdash;"</p>

<p>Paull sat down heavily on his chair, which answered with creaks
and groans under the sudden weight. As Mary was speaking the lights
in the room had failed, leaving them in total darkness. Again at
the window sounded&mdash;the grating cutting of the glass.</p>

<p>Paull climbed to his feet with an agility surprising in a man of
his bulk, and moved around the table, followed by Mrs. Paull. At
length he came to the door and pulled it open. The passage was in
darkness. He found the light switch and worked it up and down with
no effect. He glanced towards the kitchen, at the rear of the
house. The light there had been burning when he had been in the
hall before. Now it was out. For some moments he stood listening.
The strange sound was still coming from the direction of the
window.</p>

<p>Whispering a caution to his wife, for silence, Paull stole to
the front door. Half-a-minute's wait and he wrenched the door open
and ran out into the rain. There was no one in the front
garden&mdash;yet the sound of glass cutting still came from the
window. Paull went down the path to the gate and peered up and down
the road. It was deserted, glistening with the still driving rain.
There was not a soul in sight. Picking his way gingerly over the
wet grass&mdash;for he had only carpet slippers on, he went to the
window. So far as he could see in the semi-darkness there was
nothing against it&mdash;yet the sounds of cutting continued.</p>

<p>"Damn!" Paull scratched his head, thoughtfully "What the&mdash;"
He went to the front door. Mary was standing there, a pocket torch
in her hand, gazing up at the electric light-meter. One glance
showed the detective one of the main wires had been cut. An ugly
frown came on the detective's good-humoured face. Taking the torch
from his wife's fingers he beckoned her to, follow him to the
window.</p>

<p>Waiting a moment to listen to the strange sound, he pressed the
trigger of the torch, and threw the light on the grass. "My! Look
there, Walter!" Mary pointed to a corner of the window panel. On
the glass was a small, black ball. As the detective watched, it
moved upwards&mdash;and from it came the grating, cutting
sound.</p>

<p>"Jove! A snail!" Paull burst into a roar of laughter. He picked
the thing from the window and tossed it over the hedge into the
road. "Gave me quite a start, it did!"</p>

<p>"Me too." Mrs. Paull picked her way from the grass to the
doorstep. "And my feet are all wet, too."</p>

<p>"Go up and change your socks, old girl," Paull ordered.</p>

<p>"But the light, Walter?"</p>

<p>"I'll fix that." He pushed her inside the door and followed to
the dining room. Taking a chair to the porch a few minutes work
sufficed to give light to the house for the evening. As he entered
the dining room again, carrying the chair, he stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>Someone had been in the room. The sketch still remained where he
had placed it, but along the edge of the table were only three of
the snails he had placed there. On the table lay the metal plate,
bent and twisted.</p>

<p>"Well, they made a 'fiver' out of their work." Paull laughed
ruefully. "No, I'm damned if they did." He bent to the floor and
picked up the note, screwed up in a ball.</p>

<p>"Now what sort of crooks have we here&mdash;refusing easy money,
throwing it about as if of no account?" Then he noticed a white
envelope on the seat of the chair on which he had sat. For some
moments he stood, surveying it, his lips pursed to a soundless
whistle.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-5" name="ch-5">V</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">PAULL made no motion to pick up the envelope. For
a long time he stood staring at the envelope, his little mouth
pursed, but silent. In his eyes were a strange gleam, as of dawning
understanding. He had forgotten his home, his wife, the snail on
the window. Every nerve was merged in the white envelope on his
chair. Someone had known that he had brought to his home the few
clues he had found to the murderers of David Delaney. He had been
watched while he sat at the table, studying them. By whom?</p>

<p>He did not have to think to answer the question. The only person
or persons who had any interest in the matter were the men who were
responsible for the artist's death.</p>

<p>Yet, for the time, he had not a glimmer of an idea who these men
could be. The advent of the three snails on the counter in the
artist's office had shown they had been carefully watching him from
the time of the murder. They had followed to his home&mdash;still
watching. They had decided that he was getting too close to their
trail.</p>

<p>He bent down to study the envelope more closely. It was
addressed to Detective-Inspector Paull, in awkward capital letters.
He went to where his outdoor coat hung in the hall and took from
the breast-pocket a powerful magnifying glass. Again by the chair
he scanned the letter, still refraining from touching it. Again he
went to his coat, returning with a small black box from which he
took a sufflator. Dusting the letter and the chair with yellow
powder he carefully blew away the residue and scanned the letter
and chair for fingerprints. So far as he could see there were
none.</p>

<p>He looked around the room. On the mantel-piece lay a pair of
scissors. He brought them to the chair and caught the edge, of the
letter, gently, between the blades, lifting it on to the table and
turning it over. Then he commenced to dust the chair with his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the&mdash;"</p>

<p>The handkerchief was snatched from his hand, smartly. "If you
want to dust chairs and tables, m'boy, there's plenty of work here
for you." Mrs. Paull had come silently into the room.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;don't use your handkerchiefs. I've trouble enough
getting them white as it is, the way you use them at that office of
yours. Why, what's this?"</p>

<p>"A letter," Paull answered with suspicious meekness.</p>

<p>"Any fool can see that." The good lady went to the hall and
returned with a duster. "Put that thing away." She pointed to the
sufflator. "Littering up my rooms with your nasty dirty
powders!"</p>

<p>"Just wanted to see if there were finger-prints about."</p>

<p>"Plenty, I should say." Mrs. Paull's voice was tart. "You've
been in here ever since you came home, sitting at that table and
drumming on it with your fingers."</p>

<p>She looked up quickly. "Finger-prints? Don't you know the modern
crook doesn't leave them about. And&mdash;Where did that letter
come from?"</p>

<p>"There is an echo, also asking where." Paull spoke pensively.
"The strict truth is that it was not here when we went out to
interview a&mdash;a snail. It was here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then those aren't your footprints?" Mrs. Paull pointed to some
wet marks on the carpet. "And I thought they were. What's the world
coming to? I'll be apologising to my own husband next."</p>

<p>"What for? Marrying him?" The detective chuckled. "No. That was
a saving grace for the poor mutt."</p>

<p>The good lady bridled. "Aren't you going to open your letter,
Walter?"</p>

<p>"May as well!" Taking a penknife from his pocket Paull slit the
envelope down one side. From it he drew out a scrap of paper.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look at this metal plate!" Mrs. Paull interrupted. "Did you do
that, Walter?"</p>

<p>The Inspector shook his head. He dropped the paper he had drawn
from, the envelope and went to take up the metal plate, but Mrs.
Paull anticipated him. She turned it over on her hands for some
minutes, then began to study the edges.</p>

<p>"Anything there, Mary?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. What's in your letter?"</p>

<p>"Just a message." The fat voice rolled in merriment. "Listen,
girlie. 'Keep out of this, Paull or you'll get yours.' And it is
signed by 'The Three Snails.'"</p>

<p>"Not much of the snail about those folk, if they can get in and
out of a house while one of the heads of the detective department
is standing at his front door."</p>

<p>Mary Paull gave an excellent imitation of her husband's snort
when displeased. "Oh, my!"</p>

<p>Paull was at her side in a moment. With the aid of the scissors
Mary Paull had succeeded in separating the edges of the two pieces
of metal that formed the plate. Exercising his martial prerogative,
Paull took the plate from her and examined it under his magnifying
glass.</p>

<p>"Well?" The lady asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"Careful does it!" Paull went to the sideboard. From, a drawer
he took a pair of pliers. Catching the thin metal sheet in the jaw
of the pliers he rolled back the copper an inch. A sudden gravity
came on his face and he whistled lowly. Placing the plate on the
table he rolled off the thinner, topmost sheet of metal. It came
away fairly easy.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" Mrs. Paull gasped. "We were right."</p>

<p>The detective nodded. "There's the answer to our conundrums.
David Delaney was a forger." He dropped the pliers on the table and
took the thicker sheet of metal in his hands. A few minutes
straightening it, and he placed on the table before his wife an
excellent engraving of a twenty-pound banknote. "So that's what the
money was in the drawer for," he mused.</p>

<p>"But why didn't they take the plate just now?" asked Mrs. Paull
bewilderingly.</p>

<p>"Why did David Delaney conceal his engraving under a false top
of metal?" retorted the detective.</p>

<p>The questions were unanswerable. All they could understand was
that David Delaney had made an etching of a twenty-pound banknote;
that the crooks who called themselves the Three Snails had come to
the detective's home to leave a warning, yet had neglected to take
away with them the etching for which they had killed Delaney. They
must have seen the plate on the table. They had, or one of them had
picked it up, and, furious that it was not the etching he expected
to find, had twisted the plate out of shape.</p>

<p>Paull wondered at the daring of the men. They had entered the
house under cover of darkness caused by the cutting of the electric
light main wire, after attracting the detective and his wife into
the front garden through the snail crawling up the wet window-pane.
They had had to use a torch in the dark dining room; yet Paull had
hardly been out of sight of the room all the time.</p>

<p>How had they entered and left the house? If by the front door
they must have passed out under the detective's observation. No.
They had been wiser than that. They had entered by the back door,
after arranging to draw Paull out into the front garden. In the
dining room they had waited their opportunity for the few seconds
while the detective was out of sight of the room. Then, leaving the
letter and the twisted plate they had escaped by the back way.
Ruefully, Paull remembered that a long narrow lane lay behind the
lower wall of his garden.</p>

<p>Paull sat down heavily in his chair. He wanted to think; to
co-ordinate his thoughts to the new facts. Somewhere in the events
of the past few minutes lay the clue he had sought through the long
evening. Somewhere in that twisted plate of metal, or the letter,
was the slender thread that would lead him to the murderers. For
now he knew that three men, not one, were responsible for the death
of the artist. He wanted three men who specialised in forging
banknotes.</p>

<p>His keen brain ran over the list of crooks with whom his
department had come in contact during the past few years. Of
forgers; of slush-workers; he could name more than a score. But, of
three men who worked regularly together his mind was a blank.</p>

<p>He turned to the slip of paper bearing the warning left by the
crooks. Like the name on the envelope the message was printed in
ungainly capital letters. Drawing his sufflator to him he dusted
yellow powder over the paper. Again he was disappointed. The crooks
had been too wary to leave their cards behind them.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Paull turned with a broad grin, to face his wife, seated beside
him.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "They're too leery for me, old girl."</p>

<p>"Giving it up, Walter?" There was scorn in the lady's voice.</p>

<p>"There isn't much to go on." Paull spoke doubtfully. "Perhaps
I'm getting old, old girl. Perhaps I ain't got the scientific
knowledge that's wanted in these da&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bosh!" Mrs. Paull spoke emphatically. "What were those names
you mentioned at dinner?"</p>

<p>"William Sinclair?"</p>

<p>"Pass him." The lady waved the author aside, "'Sides, he's
engaged to a pretty girl and she'd have too much sense to cotton to
a forger."</p>

<p>"That all? Well, what about Ernest Delaney? He's a printer."</p>

<p>"No good. The man who was going to print notes from this plate
isn't advertising his trade."</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o!" Paull thought a moment. "There's a Mr.
Matthews&mdash;a friend of Delaney's."</p>

<p>"Friend?" Mary Paull sniffed. "David Delaney wasn't friends with
the men he made that engraving for."</p>

<p>"Think not? Well, there's the last of the list. A man named
Persus. Delaney used to purchase metal plates from him."</p>

<p>"Too obvious." Yet Mrs. Paull hesitated before speaking.
"That all you know of his associates?"</p>

<p>"Delaney was only&mdash;strangled&mdash;last night, old
girl."</p>

<p>"And you've had the whole day to work on the case! Now, if they
only had women detectives&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What world this would be! Bright and handsome&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ugh!"</p>

<p>"Sure!" Paull chuckled. "Women detectives would arrest all the
plain and ugly men and let the handsome ones go free."</p>

<p>"In that case there'd be quite a dearth of husbands." The
retort came swift and telling.</p>

<p>"Score one, old girl." Paull lifted his hands above his head.
"Now-"</p>

<p>The <i>tring</i> of the telephone bell broke on the detective's
words. With a sigh he struggled to his feet and waddled into the
hall where the instrument hung. For some minutes he remained at the
'phone, giving vent at intervals to weird grunts and exclamations.
Mrs. Paull, wriggled excitedly, on her chair, but refused to give
way to her curiosity and go into the hall.</p>

<p>"Rolling up!" Paull spoke cheerfully, as he re-entered the
dining room. "I quite agree with you, Mary."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The Three Snails don't run true to form&mdash;or rather, I
should say&mdash;name." Paull stood before his wife, rocking from
heels to toes and smiling happily. "They're quick workers, I'll say
that for them."</p>

<p>"Sakes alive!" The lady bounced up from her chair. "Walter, do
you want me to box your ears?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't be the first time you've been kissed for assaulting
your lawful spouse." The detective grinned. "Well, I suppose I must
tell you, or you'll poison my porridge to-morrow morning. The Three
Snails have taken a fancy to Dora Delaney's company."</p>

<p>"What on earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Abduction, m'dear." Paull chuckled. "And that game is like
erecting a sign-post at country crossroads."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-6" name="ch-6">VI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A WILD night of wind and rain. Paull strode
moodily up and down Ashfield railway station, waiting for the
electric train to take him to the city. Suddenly he paused, to
glare malignantly at a poster advertising a new mystery novel by
"England's Leading Mystery Writer."</p>

<p>"Pah! Detective stuff! The poor mutts!" He snorted indignantly.
"Lot they know about detecting crime. Never had to turn out at
umpteen hours in the middle of the night, in search of a girl who's
fool enough to get herself abducted by a crowd calling themselves
'The Three Snails'. Pah! Poof!"</p>

<p>The advent of the train saved the poster from annihilation at
the hands of the detective. He mounted to a first-class carriage to
swear under his breath because he had to walk the length of the
compartment to the smoking section. Paull was in a real bad temper.
For the 'Three Snails' to set him a problem to solve&mdash;a
problem relating to their identity&mdash;was but in the day's work.
The detective revelled in intricate problems&mdash;in spite of his
penchant to growl often and loudly. The fewer the clues revealed,
the quicker his brain became, the more involved the problem, the
sleepier and fatter he appeared. Yet, behind his apparent gross
smoothness lay the keenness and directness of that greatest of all
hunters, the man-chaser.</p>

<p>The train was a slow one. Paull lay back in a corner seat,
steadily chewing on a half-lit cigar. He watched the deserted
platforms as the train drew in to them, and halted a bare minute
and then slid out on the short journey to the terminus. The rattle
and speed lulled his irritableness and gradually his brain turned
to the problem before him.</p>

<p>Of knowledge of the quest before him he had little. The
telephone message had come from Police Headquarters. He would have
to go there for further details. For the present all he knew was
that Dora Delaney had been abducted from her home, in North
Sydney&mdash;and in her place had been left three small, black
snails.</p>

<p>"The Three Snails." Paull closed his eyes and before his mental
vision danced three snails, their shells in the form of
heads&mdash;eyes and mouths jeering at him and his lack of
knowledge of their meaning. Mentally, he jeered back, scoffingly.
For the time they had the laugh of him. They knew him and he had
not even a suspicion as to their identity. But time would alter
that. Always he had had the dread of a criminal who knew well when
to let alone&mdash;the crook who planned carefully in advance and
then, when his work had been accomplished, was content to sit back,
content, and await the judgment of time; to watch and wait
events&mdash;to calmly accept arrests and conviction if he had
failed to outguess the police and safeguard himself on all points
before he acted.</p>

<p>In his career Paull had met with few reverses. He had seemed to
possess a marvellous ability to out-think and out-manoeuvre his
opponents. To himself, he confessed that his success was almost
invariably due to his ability to watch and wait&mdash;to watch for
the mistakes of the criminal trying to improve on his original and
perfected plan; to wait, until his opponent blundered into the trap
he would prepare from an intensive study of after-crime errors.</p>

<p>The train drew into Central Station and Paull alighted and
walked down the stairs into the long, narrow, vaulted compartment
that made the assembling platform of the electric railway section.
He turned to the left and mounted a flight of stairs that lead to
the main station. Opposite the covered tramway stopping place he
hesitated, and then went on to the taxi-ramp. The night was wild
and stormy; he had little time to waste. Surely a taxi was in
order&mdash;in spite of recent emphatic memoranda circulating the
department on the need of strict economy.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he alighted at the dull red-bricked building
at the corner of Phillip and Hunter Streets. He sauntered up the
steps and through the swing-doors, into the detective branch.
Twenty yards down the corridor he hesitated, glancing to the left,
towards the Superintendent's office. A light showed under the edge
of the door. He turned and went up the short passage and knocked. A
loud, masterful voice bade him enter.</p>

<p>"Got here, then, Paull." Superintendent Manners locked up with a
smile as the stout Inspector entered the cosy office. "Have a good
journey from the suburbs in?"</p>

<p>"Sure." Paull strolled across to the big lounge chair in the
corner and lowered his bulk carefully into its welcoming embraces.
"May I inquire if this is overtime?"</p>

<p>"Overtime?" The bushy brows of the superintendent lifted
quickly. "Now, I really was complimenting you on the speed with
which you answered the telephone call off duty."</p>

<p>"And I imagined I lived in Australia&mdash;the home of the happy
working man." Paull addressed a fly that happened to be emulating
Bruce's spider up the wall beside his chair. "At one time there was
a demand for an eight hours' day. Eight hours work, eight hours
play, and eight hours sleep. But, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Done your eight hour's play, Paull?"</p>

<p>"I entered the portals of this House of Crime at the early hour
of nine, ack emma, yesterday morning." The Inspector looked
significantly at the clock on the big desk.</p>

<p>"I left for home at five-thirty, exactly. I know that, for I
caught a train at St. James' station that I am informed by the
Railway Commissioners through divers broadsheets and pamphlets
leaves punctually at five forty-five. There had been adduced no
evidence that it was late or early, yesterday."</p>

<p>"Eight and a half-hours." The superintendent spoke with the air
of a man who prided himself on his mental arithmetic. "I presume
that during the time you slept in the 'House of Crime' you awakened
for meals&mdash;say, lunch at one o'clock? Ah yes. You fill that
chair too comfortably to have missed a meal."</p>

<p>"I said&mdash;work." Paull protested, feebly.</p>

<p>"That's before you m'boy." The Superintendent's manner became
excessively genial. "When you return to the bosom of your family
you may convey to Mrs. Paull my regrets&mdash;or
congratulations&mdash;that I have been forced to deprive her of a
musical accompaniment to her dreams, tonight. Now, as I said, to
work&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Three Snails." Paull spoke dreamily, ignoring the
Superintendent's covert remarks. "Even a fat policeman can stand
them&mdash;so long as they are without 'manners.'"</p>

<p>"Now I know he has woken up." The Superintendent drew a sheet of
paper before him; "Listen, Paull. Shortly after eleven o'clock
to-night the Department had a telephone call from&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A Mr. William Sinclair." Paull interjected mournfully. "I know
him better as Bill. Go on, Mr. Manners, I attend your
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Good! Mr. Sinclair informed Sergeant Palmer, who answered his,
call, that he had visited at Miss Delaney's home up to nine-thirty,
this evening. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;is either too good for this wicked world&mdash;or
hopelessly Victorian." Paull spoke sadly.</p>

<p>"Eh?" Superintendent Manners looked up, startled,</p>

<p>"To me, the lady appeared to be decidedly modern
Georgian&mdash;and rather an unique and interesting specimen." The
detective appeared to be speaking to himself. "Then&mdash;why this
nine-thirty? In the days of my youth&mdash;days when I and my Mary
were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, go to blazes!" Manners could not help laughing. "If you're
going to reveal the licentious secrets of your courting days,
Paull, I'll send for the night patrol."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;it is possible to shock a Superintendent of
Detectives?" Paull's little eyes opened wide in feigned
astonishment. "But, pray proceed, Mr. Manners. My lips are
sealed."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sinclair left Miss Delaney's residence, at Dale Park, North
Sydney, at nine-thirty. Miss Delaney complained of a headache and
stated that she would retire early. She also stated that she first
required a breath of fresh air and for that purpose accompanied Mr.
Sinclair some hundred yards down the road, to the tram-stop. Before
leaving home she informed Mrs. Weston, her aunt, who is at present
visiting her, that she should not be absent more than ten minutes,
or at most, a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"And did not return, at all," Paull added. He mused for a few
moments. "Now, tell me. How did Mr. Sinclair come to ring up the
police and not Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Weston?"</p>

<p>"Sinclair rang up Mrs. Weston," explained the Superintendent,
carefully. "I understood that, before leaving Dale Park, Mr.
Sinclair was requested by Mrs. Weston, to telephone to her, that
night, the time a certain train left Central Station, the next day.
He did so, after consulting one of those pamphlets issued by the
Railway Commissioner you mentioned a little while ago, Mrs. Weston
thanked him for his information, and then asked at what time her
niece would return-"</p>

<p>"She had apparently not returned then?"</p>

<p>"Nor has since&mdash;I believe. I am trying to make that plain to you,
Inspector." Manners frowned. "Otherwise I should not have requested
your presence in this humble office, at this hour of the night,
after your very arduous day's toil. To continue. Mr. Sinclair was
surprised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As I thought&mdash;intensely Victorian!" Paull murmured.</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh! Well, Mr. Sinclair informed Mrs. Weston that her niece,
Miss Delaney had left him at the corner of the road, with the
defined object of returning to her home. In his opinion she should
have rejoined her aunt at least half-an-hour before that time. Mrs.
Weston became alarmed. She telephoned to all Miss Delaney's friends
in the neighbourhood she had knowledge of, to be informed that they
had not seen the young lady that night. Then Mrs. Weston rang up
Mr. Sinclair, to report her non-success in tracing her niece. Mr.
Sinclair caught the alarm and rang up North Sydney Police Station.
Inspector Fawcett, knowing I had placed the case in the very
capable hands of Detective-Inspector Paull, immediately telephoned
this office. He was anticipated a few minutes by Mr. Sinclair."</p>

<p>"Friend Fawcett will rise to the very top of the detective-tree,
if he is not very careful," commented Paull meditatively.</p>

<p>"Your perspicacity is excellent," Manners murmured, gently. "I
have now only to add that Mr. Sinclair is on his way here, in his
car, to take Inspector Paull to the seat of the crime, and I can
tap 'Bundy' gently on the nose and retire to the bosom of my family
knowing that Miss Delaney's fate is in very excellent hands."</p>

<p>"Bundy! Don't!" A look of almost pain passed over the stout
Inspector's countenance. "Bundy and I are not friends&mdash;he lets
one down. I&mdash;I long to hit him, hard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall&mdash;one day." Manners rose from his seat and
reached for hat and mackintosh. "Pray don't disturb yourself, Mr.
Paull. I will leave you to meditate, in solitude, not even
remembering to put out the light when you leave&mdash;others will
attend to that. Anon, Mr. William Sinclair&mdash;whom you know as
'Bill'&mdash;will arrive. He will bear you to North Sydney&mdash;to
an investigation I am certain you will bring to a successful
conclusion. Tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is there to be a tomorrow?" Paull opened his little eyes very
wide.</p>

<p>"I believe so. Tomorrow I will resume my labours here and trust
that among the numerous reports I shall regretfully read will be
one announcing another success on the scroll of Fame&mdash;headed
'Paull, Inspector&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are times&mdash;" Regretfully Paull ceased to speak, for
the door had closed sharply on the Superintendent's bulky form. For
some moments the Inspector continued to sit in the comfortable
chair, then rose to his feet and wandered down the corridor to the
main hall. Almost as he passed through the swing doors, Bill
Sinclair sprang up the steps into Police! Headquarters.</p>

<p>"So you're here!" The young author sprang forward to greet the
stout Inspector. "Mr. Paull, for God's sake do something! Dora's
disappeared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" The short, snapped word caught the young man's taunted
nerves, as a blow. He stopped short and glanced keenly at the
detective.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" He paused a moment. "I've got my car here. Can you come
at once?"</p>

<p>"Might as well." Paull shrugged his broad shoulders with
apparent indifference; yet the keen, quick look he bestowed on the
young man was kindly. He pulled out his watch. "Take it coolly,
young fellow! We've twenty minutes before the next punt starts to
cross the Harbour." He followed the young man out onto the street,
very leisurely, pulling up the collar of his mackintosh against the
storm. His quiet acceptance of the situation acted as a tonic on
Sinclair's frayed nerves. The young man slid into the driver's seat
and set the car in motion, turning up to Macquarie Street and in
the direction of Bennelong Point.</p>

<p>"Been to Dale Park, Mr. Sinclair?" The Inspector spoke
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I drove there after telephoning North Sydney and
Headquarters and getting instructions to come here for you."</p>

<p>The young author's tones matched the detective's casual words.
"In fact, I was nearly a quarter of an hour there."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Nothing." Sinclair laughed bitterly. "Just nothing! Mrs. Weston
took me to Dora's room. It's just as she left it&mdash;just as if
she was going to enter it again within a few minutes.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Didn't touch anything?" Paull questioned sharply.</p>

<p>"No. I remembered that."</p>

<p>The car slid down the hill and turned to the right, joining the
long line of cars waiting for the punt.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to show&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>"Miss Delaney went to the corner of the street with you?" Paull
hesitated. "You let her return home alone?"</p>

<p>"It was her wish." Sinclair flushed slightly. "I didn't want
to&mdash;I wanted to walk back with her but&mdash;but I've got to
get up very early tomorrow morning. There's been a bit of
trouble&mdash;the Critic stories, you know. I'm behind hand on my
contract and I have to pick up time. Now that's important. Davy's
gone and&mdash;and&mdash;Well, you know."</p>

<p>"Miss Delaney's alone?" Paull nodded, understanding.</p>

<p>"No, she has her aunt with her. Mrs. Weston only came up for the
day, this morning, when we telegraphed her news of Davy's death. She
has to go back to Moss Vale tomorrow. Dora will be alone then&mdash;all
alone until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until you can get married&mdash;that it?"</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, well! Best thing for the pair of you. Authors are
happy-go-lucky people at their best. Marriage may steady one of
them down. Who knows? You'll have, something to work for then, eh?
Well, well!"</p>

<p>For the remainder of the journey across the Harbour, Paull
chatted inconsequently, recounting to the author the events of the
evening at Ashfield.</p>

<p>Bill Sinclair was interested, asking many questions and
declaring that Paull's home adventures deserved enshrining in a
story. The detective laughed. He had a very small opinion of the
mystery novel detective.</p>

<p>The car rolled slowly off the punt at North Shore. Sinclair
stood heavily on the accelerator and drove swiftly up the hill, towards
North Sydney. Some hundred yards along the main road he turned to
the right and, skirting the head of Neutral Bay, came to the suburb
of Dale Park. In a quiet, tree-shrouded road he brought the car to
a halt before a small cottage, set back in a large garden. Paull
alighted and watched the author lock his machine. As they turned to
the garden gate the detective laid his hand quickly on the young
man's arm.</p>

<p>"You came in by this gate when you visited Mrs. Weston, just
before you came to Sydney to-night?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Notice anything about it? Anything strange?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have another look." The detective drew the young man close to
the gate, yet held him back from touching it. "See anything strange
about that gate?"</p>

<p>"Good God!"</p>

<p>The young author looked up quickly at the detective. "I'll swear
they weren't there when I left the house. I must have seen them
when I came out, if they had been there."</p>

<p>"Just so." Paull nodded wisely. "Now I really admire those
fellows. A boon and a blessing to a fat policeman, like myself. No
guessing&mdash;all made plain for one. They come and go&mdash;and
then I come. I take one single look at where they have been and
state, wisely: 'The Three Snails.' Can't miss! They put them there
for me to see!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch-7" name="ch-7">VII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A SHORT, slight, grey-haired woman came to the
door of the cottage as Inspector Paull and Bill Sinclair walked up
the gravel path. The detective looked at her with interest.
Somehow, he had a feeling that he must watch and doubt everyone and
everything he came across in this house. For a few minutes he
stood chatting with Mrs. Weston; then, stepping back on the gravel
path, carefully surveyed the front of the house.</p>

<p>It was a low-pitched cottage, of one floor built of rough-cast
walls and with a red-tiled roof. Around it was spread a wide
veranda. The front door was at the right-hand corner of the house.
Around the cottage lay a wide expanse of gardens, filled, as he
could see in the very imperfect night-light, with a profusion of
ornamental shrubs and flowers. There was no lawn at the front of
the house, facing the roadway. Gravel paths extended in all
directions, broken, at intervals, by trellised arches, over which
straggled flowering creepers. It was a pretty place, a garden in
which an artist would delight to rest and develop, at leisure. The
place intrigued the detective and for some minutes he stood out in
the rain, staring around him appreciatively. Then, he strolled back
on to the veranda and to where Mrs. Weston and Sinclair stood
watching and waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Nice place, Mrs. Weston." The old lazy tones crept into the
Inspector's voice. To the woman he appeared to be a stout, rather
amiable old police officer, of mediocre ability. "Just the sort of
a place a fat policeman like myself dreams about, somewhere in the
country&mdash;a place to end one's days, when retirement from
active service becomes imperative."</p>

<p>"Yes." The elderly little woman flashed a questioning glance at
the young author.</p>

<p>"I live at Moss Vale&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pretty place." Paull nodded. "Went there once. Remember Sam
Conway, Mr. Sinclair? Got rid of his wife&mdash;in a somewhat
unorthodox fashion; something with arsenic in it, y'know. They
found him at Moss Vale and I went there to bring him to Sydney.
Queer sort of chap. Did not want to talk about anything but birds.
Well, well! Don't suppose there's anything but crows where he's
living now&mdash;or was it jackdaws; well, a kind of crow. Well,
well."</p>

<p>Very quietly, almost imperceptibly, the detective edged Mrs.
Weston into the house and followed. She led into a prettily
furnished living room, overlooking the front gardens. For some time
the detective sat, talking to her; Sinclair fidgeting, impatiently,
about the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Weston could give Paull little help in his quest. She had
been in and out of the room where Dora and Sinclair had sat during
the evening. About half-past nine Sinclair had got up to go
home&mdash;he had said that he wanted to be up by five o'clock the
next morning to finish the story he would have to deliver that day.
Dora had said she would walk to the end of the street with him.
Mrs. Weston had protested. It was raining&mdash;but Dora had been
self-willed. She had donned rain-coat and galoshes and had gone out
with Bill Sinclair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Weston had expected her back in ten minutes, or a quarter
of an hour at latest. Half-an-hour had passed and then Sinclair had
telephoned to give her the time of the train to Moss Vale, as he
had promised. She had asked him if Dora had spoken of calling
anywhere on her way home. She had told him the girl had not
returned home.</p>

<p>Sinclair had been much disturbed at her news and had driven over
at once. While she was waiting his arrival she had telephoned those
friends of Dora she knew of, asking if they had seen the girl that
evening. By the time Sinclair arrived she had fully realised that
the girl was lost.</p>

<p>"Lost?" Paull frowned. "You're still certain she is not with
friends?"</p>

<p>"How can she be?" The lady gestured to the clock; the hands now
approaching two o'clock. "Dora wouldn't stay out to this hour
without telephoning home. No, someone's taken her away.
I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Weston showed every sign of dissolving into tears.</p>

<p>"Humph!" Paull turned to the young author who had taken a seat
close beside him. "You left here at nine-thirty&mdash;to catch a
tram home? Hadn't you your car with you?"</p>

<p>"No." There was a slight hesitation in Sinclair's manner. "I
came here direct from the city, with Dora. We had lunch in town
and then took the ferry to Neutral Bay. The tram brought us to the
end of this road. I spent the afternoon with Dora and Mrs.
Weston&mdash;in fact I was here when Mrs. Weston arrived."</p>

<p>The lady nodded in confirmation of the statement. Bill Sinclair
had been in the house with Dora when she had driven up, in a taxi.
She and Dora had cooked and dished up the dinner. During the
evening, they had sat in that room and talked&mdash;up to the
moment that Sinclair had risen to go home.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the two, Paull made a cursory search of the
house. In the girl's room he lingered for some time, walking around
peering inquisitively at ornaments and articles of attire, but
touching nothing. Sometimes, he chatted, freely; at other, times he
fell into long silences, but always moving about some room, or from
one room to another. Once he caught a glance, almost of resignation
pass between the man and woman.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Paull led back to the sitting-room. "There doesn't
seem much for me to see around here." He stroked his triple chins
reflectively. "Don't think you meed worry, Mrs. Weston. We'll have
Miss Dora back, lively as a cricket, as they say, very soon."</p>

<p>"You know something?" Mrs. Weston spoke eagerly.</p>

<p>"Just a few things." Paull tried to make his laugh as fatuous as
possible. "We do see things that others don't&mdash;we policemen."
He laughed again. "I've seen quite a lot, tonight. Now Mr.
Sinclair, how do we get back to the city?"</p>

<p>"But you stay here tonight." Mrs. Weston, spoke hospitably. She
glanced at the clock. "You live&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At Ashfield, ma'am."</p>

<p>"But you'd never get home, at this time of night. No, no. You
must stay here, I insist!"</p>

<p>"Very good of you, ma'am," Paull acquiesced meekly. "If you can
put me up, I'll be very glad. Sleep on the couch,
here&mdash;perhaps as well. One can't see much on a rainy night and
I'd like to have a look at that garden in the morning, early."</p>

<p>"Oh, the house isn't as small as that," Mrs. Weston laughed.
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll see about a room for you. Bill, you
know where Davy keeps his whisky. I'm sure Inspector Paull is just
dying for a long drink." She bustled out of the room and Sinclair
turned to small cabinet, bringing from it bottles and glasses.
Paull mixed a drink in appreciative silence. A long, satisfying
draught and he lay back in the comfortable chair he had
appropriated, satisfied with the world and all that was in it.</p>

<p>For some time the young author paced the room, restlessly. Paull
had noticed that he had mixed his whisky with very little soda,
and had drunk it at a gulp. Suddenly he turned to the
detective.</p>

<p>"Mr. Paull&mdash;Inspector. What do you think? Where is
Dora?"</p>

<p>"We-l-l."' Paull spoke slowly. The young, man had asked a
question he did not want to reply to, directly, at the moment.
Gradually an idea was building up in his mind; a theory so
far-fetched and fantastic that he was almost afraid of it. "I
can't say right off, y'know&mdash;but I don't think she is far from
here&mdash;if you know what I mean."</p>

<p>"I don't," Sinclair said: impatiently. "And I don't think you
are as great a fool as you would like us to think. I may not be a
detective, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You write detective, stories, eh?" A slow rumble, answering for
a laugh, came in Paull's throat. "Well, well. Read your Sherlock
Holmes? Thought so. What do you think of Dr. Watson? Bit of a goat,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the seemingly fool question he asks explains the
detective's reasonings to the reader."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" Paull meditated. "Never thought of that. Well, well! I'm
not a great reader of detective yarns, y'know. Always seem a bit
far-fetched to me. Of course, the author knows what is going to
happen and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not always."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Paull looked up, startled. "I thought it was the rule to
work, from the end to the beginning. Always envied that way of
working. Suit me, just. Hang the murderer, then set out his trial
in real life. There'd be questions asked in Parliament&mdash;and
that's a thing the Police Department doesn't encourage."</p>

<p>"I like to make my mysteries; crowd, them one on the other on, a
loosely strung thread of story, and then during the last two or
three chapters work out the solution, tying up all the loose
threads&mdash;and that."</p>

<p>"That so?" Paull looked inquisitive "Ever read those stories by
a lady; Agatha Christie, I think. Created a French
detective&mdash;no, a Belgian&mdash;who spent most of his time in
England solving mysteries the English police could not understand.
They must have been grateful: Well! Well! She gave her detective a
friend. Man that was always trying to get in one jump ahead of the
real detective in the story&mdash;and always falling into
bloomers&mdash;mistakes, I mean; not the things that Lady Habberton
used to wear."</p>

<p>"That doesn't explain Dora's disappearance?" Sinclair exclaimed,
irritatedly.</p>

<p>"Course not, yet it might!" Paull shook his head. "What I was
trying to get at was that things don't happen in life like they do
in stories. Now, if I was one of those detectives you write about I
should look wise, walk three times around that table, pick up a
hairpin&mdash;beg pardon, forgot girls don't wear them now; well,
say a hair-slide&mdash;and tell you to look in the cellaret. No,
thanks, Mr. Sinclair, no more, and that wasn't a hint. Ah, here
comes Mrs. Weston. Now I'm going to prescribe for us all. One
little drink, to the safe return of Dora, and then bed with clear
consciences for a good sleep. Eh, what? as the English say!"</p>

<p>In spite of some reluctance on Sinclair's part, Paull had his
way and shepherded his companions to their rooms. He found a cosy
little room at the rear of the house had been prepared for him,
and stripped off coat and waistcoat, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>As he caught at the top of his collar stud a sudden thought
struck him. Opening the door, he went to the room which he knew
Sinclair occupied and knocked gently. The door opened almost
immediately, showing the author fully dressed.</p>

<p>"Naughty." Paull shook a solemn forefinger. "And I thought we'd
all agreed to go to bed. Just came along to tell you not to worry
if you heard me at the telephone. Just going to talk to the wife.
She'll worry at my not coming home, y'know." He drew the door
closed, gently, but firmly and walked in his stockinged feet to the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>Just within the door he halted abruptly and bent to listen. For
some minutes he remained tensed and alert then, hearing no sounds
from the passage, shut the door and went to the telephone. The
number he dialled was not on the Ashfield exchange and had 'B' for
an initial letter. When the call was answered he spoke in almost a
whisper. His words were ambiguous, yet might have been addressed to
Mrs Paull had she been at the other end of the wire. They did not
refer to the case on which he was working nor entirely to home
affairs&mdash;yet the Inspector seemed satisfied that they were
understood.</p>

<p>He turned from the instrument and stole softly to the door.
Again he listened for sounds without the room, but the house lay
silent. Opening the door he crept back to the room allotted to him,
and to bed, to fall asleep, immediately.</p>

<p>The sun had hardly topped the horizon when Paull was up and
dressing. Taking care not to disturb the other members of the
house-hold, he crept out on to the veranda and into the gardens.
For some time he paced the various paths, stopping now and again to
trace their direction and general relation to the house. The set of
paths, to the right of the house, interested him greatly. He went
over them again and again and at last stopped at the fence dividing
the Delaney property from the next house.</p>

<p>Finding a large flower-pot in the garden, he carried it to the
fence and mounted it, although the fence was very low. A short
examination of the next premises seemed to afford him considerable
satisfaction. Carrying the flowerpot back to where he found it he
returned to the paths and subjected them to a very careful
scrutiny. Again his manner expressed satisfaction. He stood upright
and looked at his watch. It was barely seven o'clock. For some
minutes he stood meditating, then having formed some sudden
resolve, or plan, strolled back to the house. At the top step,
leading up to the veranda, he stopped and pulled off his shoes. In
stockinged feet he crept into the house, into the living room where
he had talked to Mrs. Weston and Sinclair the previous night. A
glance around showed him a small desk, set close to the window. In
it he found notepaper and envelopes. The composition of the letter
gave him some trouble. Thrice he wrote it before he sat back,
satisfied. Then he carefully folded the spoilt sheets and placed
them in his pocket. He read the last letter he wrote with some
satisfaction, enclosed it in an envelope and addressed it with a
single line. Then he returned to the garden and on the bottom step
leading up to the veranda, resumed his footwear.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he boarded an early tram, en-route for Neutral
Bay, whistling gaily. The tram arrived at the wharf just as the
ferry pulled alongside. Without a glance back, Paull went aboard,
his whistling causing some consternation among the steamer's
crew.</p>

<p>Bill Sinclair, in spite of his worries, slept soundly. He awoke
shortly after and, dressing quickly, went into the sitting room. A
letter propped against the decanter caught his eyes. It was
addressed to him.</p>

<p>He tore it open and swore under his breath as he read the few
scrawled lines.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sinclair." Mrs. Weston spoke from the door. "I went to take
Mr. Inspector Paull a cup of morning tea and he didn't answer to
my knock. I opened the door and he wasn't there. He's not in the
gardens nor in the house. Has&mdash;has anything happened to him, I
wonder."</p>

<p>"Only a sanity self-revelation." Bill Sinclair answered
bitterly. "He's chucked the job; least, he doesn't say that
but&mdash;but that's what the letter he wrote me means. He's gone
back to the city. Now, who's going to find Dora?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-8" name="ch-8">VIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR PAULL was not whistling when he came off
the boat at Circular Quay. The bare twenty minutes journey had
given him time for reflection&mdash;and wonderment. For the first
time in longer than his memory would carry him back in the years,
he had acted on impulse. There had been little in the garden at
Dale Park to cause the detective to break away from his usual solid
passivity.</p>

<p>Although he had gone to the cottage in a state of suspended
suspicion, he had to confess that Mrs. Weston, for one, was free
from all complicity in the crime he was investigating. At the time
of David Delaney's murder she was not even in Sydney. She had
arrived at the Delaney cottage some considerable time after Dora
and Sinclair had returned from the city. Bill Sinclair was in a
different position. Suspicion must, to some extent, rest on him
until the real murderers were unmasked. He had written the story;
the story the artist was illustrating at the time of his death. The
artist had been killed in a similar manner to the man in the story.
That could only indicate that the murderer had knowledge of what
the story contained and who could that be saving only the author
who wrote it, the editor who accepted it or the artist who
illustrated it.</p>

<p>Against the facts accumulating to throw suspicion on Bill
Sinclair were the three small black snails on the drawing. They had
been in the artist's office while he sat before his desk, dead.
Sinclair might have placed them there, but he could not have placed
the three snails on the counter in the outer office, for he had
been with the detective at the time they appeared. He could not
have journeyed to Ashfield to raid the detective's house, for he
had been in the company of Dora Delaney and Mrs. Weston at the time
of that occurrence.</p>

<p>He had to presume the organisation calling themselves the 'Three
Snails' was composed of three men. He was certain of that. Sinclair
might be one of the three; Paull had more than a suspicion that he
was. Certainly he knew more of the incidents surrounding the death
of David Delaney than he had told. The house next door to the
Delaney cottage had interested the Inspector.</p>

<p>Although the rain through the previous night had washed out many
of the signs on the gravel paths sufficient had remained to make
the detective certain that the house next door was unoccupied, as
it was intended to appear. Someone had passed from the Delaney's
cottage, to the house and back again several times during the
previous day. Someone had passed between the house and the cottage
during the early hours of that morning, after the rain had
ceased.</p>

<p>For a time during the journey between Neutral Bay and Circular
Quay, Paull had doubted his wisdom in leaving Dale Park so
precipitately. He wondered whether he should not have remained at
the cottage, communicating with the North Sydney Police and having
the house next door raided. He was certain that if he had carried
out that plan he would have learned many strange things. But, would
he have learned the whole truth; would he have learned more than
that Dora Delaney was detained, in that house; if, indeed, she was
not staying there of her own free will? A police raid would have
settled the many questions that puzzled the detective's brains
concerning the cottage and the house next door.</p>

<p>But he doubted if that raid would have gone any way towards
solving the mystery surrounding the murder of David Delaney. More,
he had a feeling that the raid would have shrouded the murder with
a still deeper pall of mystery. He came to the conclusion that he
had been right to follow impulse&mdash;although he was dissatisfied
that he had, in his mature and sober age, allowed impulse to master
him. He grinned as he thought of the disgust on the young author's
face when he found and read the letter he had left in the sitting
room. But, the boy wanted a lesson. He was of the mystery writer
class&mdash;writers that the detective had a deep and abiding
loathing for. He was of the men who created a murderer, laid the
clues backwards, and then constructed a crime to fit what they had
planned.</p>

<p>He laughed, silently&mdash;a laugh that shook his bulky
frame&mdash;at the thought of Sinclair on the trail of the girl's
abductors. That would be real detective work and the author, at the
end of the trail, might have to considerably reconstruct his
theories of crime and criminals.</p>

<p>Again in the city, Paull made his way to Random Buildings and
ascended to the offices formerly occupied by David Delaney. The
door was locked, but Paull carried a key. He looked round the two
rooms carefully and then locked the door behind him.</p>

<p>In the offices, standing in the doorway between the two rooms he
mentally reviewed the crime. The artist was seated at his desk,
finishing the illustration to the crime story. The door from the
corridor was stealthily opened and a silent, stealthy black shadow
glided into the room. The slow minutes passed as the shadow crept
towards the inner office. The sudden, sharp spring; the tightening
of the cord around the victim's throat; the dragging of the dead
body back in the chair; and, the departure of the murderer.</p>

<p>And the reason for the crime? The double metal plate told that.
Delaney was an associate of a gang of forgers. They had provided
him with the metal plate and the banknotes he was to imitate;
but&mdash;Why had Delaney covered the etching with the thin plate
of copper? Paull remembered that his wife had stated, in her
emphatic manner that Delaney had not been on friendly terms with
his criminal associates. Had he covered the etching with the copper
plate so as to conceal it,? If that supposition was correct then
there was only one logical explanation.</p>

<p>David Delaney had been forced to carry out the work of forgery
under some definite threat. But while he had been engaged in the
work he had sensed some means of escape from his thraldom. It had
been good policy for him to continue the work in case his avenue of
escape from the criminals' clutches proved unusable. But, when he
had completed, the etching he had covered it with the copper plate,
so that it should remain concealed until he could escape from his
obligation&mdash;or hand over the etching to his associates.</p>

<p>The theory was reasonable. In some manner the criminals had
discovered that Delaney planned to escape from the hold they had
established over him. They had gone to his office late in the
evening, knowing his habit of working long after the dinner hours.
There had been a quarrel; possibly the forgers had demanded that
the etching be handed over to them immediately? Delaney had refused
to comply, with their demands and they had killed him.</p>

<p>Then had followed the quick search of the offices. The crooks
had departed, disappointed, never thinking that the etching they
sought had been under their eyes all the time, perhaps actually in
their hands. They had taken the banknotes away with them. Then
they had set a watch on the offices. They had come to the
conclusion that the detective had discovered what they had sought,
in vain. They had raided his house only to discover what they
thought to be the etched plate was of plain metal.</p>

<p>But Paull had to acknowledge that not one of the theories he
constructed would lead to the discovery of the identity of the
'Three Snails.' Sinclair might be one of the gang. If so, then
Persus might be another member? Who was the third? Could the third
man he was seeking be David Delaney's
brother&mdash;Ernest&mdash;the printer?</p>

<p>Paull left the offices, careful to lock the door behind him. A
few moments of hesitation and he commenced to canvass the offices on
that floor. He found there were quite a number of them. He made his
inquiries in a strange, haphazard fashion, seeming more interested
in talking to the girl-clerks&mdash;and about the girl-clerks in
the building. Gradually a straight line settled around his little
mouth, as again and again his casual questions failed to bring the
information he sought.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;he had just come out of an office and was debating
where next to call when the elevator came to the floor and a girl
alighted. She walked quickly down to David Delaney's office. At the
door she opened her bag and took out a key. A moment and the door
opened and the girl entered. Paull strode swiftly down the corridor
and, followed her into the offices.</p>

<p>For some minutes he stood watching her.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Anstey." The detective spoke casually.</p>

<p>"Oh!" The girl straightened from the desk over which she was
bending. "Mr.&mdash;Inspector Paull! Why&mdash;you gave me quite a
shock. I didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Didn't expect to see me here?", Paull finished her sentence as
the girl paused. "Now, that shows bad psychology on your part,
m'dear. You should have guessed that a detective, like a ghost,
returns to haunt the scene of the crime."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I thought you had&mdash;had finished here?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because&mdash;" Maude Anstey looked distressed. "Well,
because you had taken him away&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But had not discovered who put him there." Paull chuckled. "No,
m'dear. We don't consider a case finished in our Department
until we've caught our man and handed him over
to&mdash;to&mdash;well, you don't want to know that."</p>

<p>"Then you think&mdash;" Miss. Anstey broke off suddenly. "But,
what can you do here?" She faced the detective boldly.
"Are&mdash;you&mdash;are you watching&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>"Not before ten minutes ago." Again Paull laughed his strange
silent laugh that shook his huge bulk. "Fact is, Miss Anstey, I've
made a mistake. I clean forgot all about you&mdash;until an hour
ago.</p>

<p>"I?" The girl caught her breath suddenly. "What&mdash;what do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"As a factor in the&mdash;" For quite an appreciable time the
detective hesitated "&mdash;in the murder mystery."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I didn't murder him. I&mdash;I wouldn't for
I&mdash;" The girl sank sobbing into a chair, tearing futilely at
her bag for her handkerchief. Paull crossed the room to her side,
lumberingly.</p>

<p>"Now, now, m'girl!" He drew out his own handkerchief and pressed
it into her hand.</p>

<p>"Cry into that, if you want to cry at all. You can't get over
the fact that you discovered him and telephoned the police. You
can't, any more than I can, get over the fact that I made a big
mistake when I forgot all about you. Hmm! Wonder what my missus 'ud
say? Once a girl called me a 'shriek' and Mary&mdash;that's my
missus&mdash;said it wasn't a bad description, even though I
hadn't got it quite right. Now, when I tell her I quite
overlooked a pretty girl in conning my problem&mdash;well,
well&mdash;she'll call me better than a shriek. Ah! I thought
you'd soon smile if I went on talking. Mary says I'd make a great
nurse to put babies to sleep with my lullabies."</p>

<p>Maude Anstey had recovered her composure. She was looking up at
the detective with a little smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"I'm quite all right now, Mr. Paull and&mdash;and&mdash;please
let Mrs. Paull know that she's quite right."</p>

<p>"About the 'shriek' business?"</p>

<p>"No, about the lullabies."</p>

<p>"So? I'm as good as that eh? Well, what about yourself, young
lady? You're no dud at it, are you?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Paull?" A frightened look came in the
girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"Crooning lullabies to&mdash;to something larger than a
baby."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That a certain young lady wasn't so frightened and alarmed, at
coming to work one morning and finding a dead man in the offices as
she&mdash;well, as she might have been."</p>

<p>"Mr. Paull?"</p>

<p>"You can call me 'Walter' if you like&mdash;or 'dad.' Perhaps
the last might be better, as then Mary would have nothing to
complain of. Never could persuade her that modern girls judge men
by looks, not weight. She still thinks I'm a runner in the
Philanderers' Stakes. Now, what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think you could be&mdash;be very nice." There was a
twinkle of amusement in the girl's eyes; a vagrant dimple at the
corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>"As nice as&mdash;as David De&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Paull! He's dead!"</p>

<p>"My mistake, m'dear, I'd forgotten. By the way, know Mr.
Persus?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Like him?"</p>

<p>"No." The word was most emphatic.</p>

<p>"Thought so! A little bird whispered to me that Robert Persus
thought very well of himself, eh?"</p>

<p>"He's&mdash;he's a fool, a conceited fool!" The girl spoke
hotly.</p>

<p>"So? Thinks too well of himself?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded, a slight blush creeping into her cheeks. "So
that's it?" The girl's eyes met Paull's and she nodded; dimpling.
"Just have to raise your finger and he'll come hoppin' eh?" Paull
laughed softly.</p>

<p>Again the girl laughed and dimpled.</p>

<p>"Suppose I asked you to raise that little finger? Now, m'dear
don't get excited. David Delaney wasn't a bad sort of chap, was he?
You'd do a bit, to get&mdash;well, you know."</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;" The girl hesitated, then rose from her chair
and came to where the detective was standing. "Mr. Paull, if you'll
trust me&mdash;tell me plainly what you want me to
do&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll try&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good girl!" Paull patted her shoulder, approvingly. "'Tisn't
much I want. You know where Persus lunches? Thought so.
Well&mdash;Say, got plenty of money." His hand went to his trousers
pocket and came away with a note, screwed up. "Oh, take it, m'dear.
You're a member of the Police Department, for the time. Now, get to
that lunch room and have a bang-up lunch. See Persus and let him
talk to you&mdash;But then, you're a modern girl and don't want
instruction in that from an old 'has-been' like me. Just tip the
gentleman off that you're taking care of these offices until the
Delaney estate is settled up&mdash;and may be alone here to-morrow
afternoon. That'll fetch him."</p>

<p>Maude Anstey laughed and nodded.</p>

<p>"Thought so." Paull joined in her laughter. "He'd be deaf, dumb,
blind and plumb silly if he didn't&mdash;and you play your cards
right. Now, remember. Three o'clock, to-morrow afternoon
and&mdash;and if things go right&mdash;well, you can wear it
again."</p>

<p>"Wear what?" The girl looked up startled, and the smile banished
from her lips.</p>

<p>"The ring that you used to wear on the third finger of your left
hand." Paull only breathed the words. "No need to be frightened,
m'dear. Shall I guess more?"</p>

<p>"You know?"</p>

<p>"Know what? That David Delaney put that ring there? Yes."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-9" name="ch-9">IX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT the hell do you want here?" The man seated
at the other end of the room, facing Anstey, looked up angrily as
Inspector Paull entered the offices and lifted the counter-flap.
"Get out, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Persus&mdash;Robert Persus, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Who are you?" The short, slight, foppishly dressed man
stroked a small slightly-twisted moustache; of straw-coloured
hairs.</p>

<p>"Inspector Paull. Investigating the Delaney murder." The
detective spoke distinctly, watching the man closely. He wondered
if he had noticed a slight start from the man when he mentioned his
name.</p>

<p>"Paull." The man frowned. "Well, what do you want here? Don't
think the murderer's going to hang about these offices, waiting for
you to pick him up, do you? Pah! You detectives make me sick. But,
who can wonder&mdash;" His coarse, bold eyes swept Paull's rotund
figure with contempt. "No one but a fool would set a fat man to
catch a murderer."</p>

<p>"Yet a tortoise once raced a hare." In spite of the humility
with which Paull spoke he was enjoying himself. "Glad to meet you,
Mr. Persus."</p>

<p>"Might be glad to meet you elsewhere, Inspector." The man winked
lewdly, bringing a swift, blush to the girl's cheeks. She looked
at Paull helplessly. He dared not signal to her, for the man was
watching him keenly. "Had any luck yet?"</p>

<p>"Not until today."</p>

<p>The fatuous look on Paull's good-humoured face deepened and he
strolled forward with an air of eager confidence. "Fact is, I've
had a most astonishing piece of luck.. All but got my hands on the
party I want."</p>

<p>"That so?" Persus hardly bothered to conceal his contempt.
"Well, why not go the whole hog. I'll entertain Miss Anstey while
you're completing your job. Good-day Paull; see you later." A
slight wave of the over-manicured, bejewelled fingers was intended
to sweep the detective from the visible map; but Paull stood his
ground. A short nod and a wink, when the man turned towards the
girl, reassured her.</p>

<p>"But that's&mdash;" Paull commenced.</p>

<p>"What?" Persus swung round, almost a menace in his manner. "I
told you to get out. Now get."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I've arranged to meet him here." The lazy, sleepy
look had crept into the detective's face.</p>

<p>"Here?" The man glanced from the detective to the girl, sudden
suspicion in his eyes. "You mean to say, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just that." Much of the fatuity had gone from Paull's voice.
"Like to meet him, Mr. Persus?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The man who murdered David Delaney."</p>

<p>"But he&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man paused, quickly.</p>

<p>"What?" The detective, questioned.</p>

<p>"I was going to say that the man who murdered Delaney would not
be such a fool as to come here. Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rather a remarkable theory." Paull drew up a chair, placing it
so that he could interpose instantly between the girl and the man,
if necessary. "You theorise that a murderer smells blood, and won't
come near it, unless forced. Something like the theory that
prevailed in the middle-ages when suspects were forced into the
presence of the murdered persons. Our forefathers had the idea that
the victims would spout blood when the real murderer came near.
Perhaps they had it wrong&mdash;and you are right! That the
murderer on the scene of his crime can't help confessing."</p>

<p>Persus nodded. A puzzled look came in his eyes. "May be
something in that," he acknowledged.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Miss Anstey?" For the first time the
Inspector addressed the girl. "But, there! Not a very pleasant
subject to argue before a lady, is it? Still, I'm interested.
S'pose you committed a murder, Mr. Persus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" The man was on his feet in an instant. Immediately he
recovered his composure and resumed his chair. "You have queer
ideas, Mr. Paull."</p>

<p>"So the missus says." The detective stroked his triple chins,
thoughtfully. "Still, I try to reason them out while, so far as I
can see, women trust to what they call intuition and that's a form
of guessing. Still, I'll say this for her; she often guesses
right."</p>

<p>"When are you going to catch your murderer?" The man fidgeted,
uneasily; his eyes flashing banefully at the detective. "You say
he's coming here? Well, I'd like to meet him, but&mdash;" He looked
at his watch. "Half-past three! I say, Miss Anstey, what about
afternoon-tea and a dance."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can't spare her." Paull spoke quickly. "You see, I
engaged Miss Anstey as my assistant yesterday."</p>

<p>"Your assistant?" The keen, black eyes flashed from the man to
the girl. A dark flush mounted to the man's face. "May I know
when?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Yesterday, midday, wasn't it, Miss Anstey. Of course
I remember, just before lunch. She's a member of the New South
Wales Police Department, now."</p>

<p>"Is she?" Persus swung round on the girl so quickly that she
started back in her chair. "So that's why you were so pleasant all
of a sudden. You little&mdash;"</p>

<p>Paull laughed throatily; yet he moved forward between the man
and the girl. "Nice girl, Miss Anstey, isn't she?" The detective's
face was inexpressive. "What's the matter, Mr. Persus? Going to
leave us?"</p>

<p>"Damned little double-crosser!" The man turned on the detective,
with a snarl. "Well, I'm going to congratulate you on your
assistant. You might ask her what she knows of David Delaney's
murder."</p>

<p>"S'pose I ask you." Again Paull's bulk interposed before the
man, this time barring his way to the door. "At the same time you
might explain how you come to know the facts you suggest? You
weren't here when David Delaney&mdash;er&mdash;died?"</p>

<p>"Find out!" Persus snarled. "I'll tell you this; she was."</p>

<p>"I guessed that." The detective's quaint silent laughter shook
his portly frame. "Thought that directly I came in here. A girl
doesn't come to her office in the morning and find a dead man there
without showing a lot more emotion than Miss Anstey let me
see."</p>

<p>"So you're not as dumb as you look!" Persus laughed. "If you
keep on like that you'll discover something more&mdash;with
luck."</p>

<p>"I'll chance the luck," Paull grinned. "Going, Mr. Persus? Now,
do you know I've got so fond of you that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" the man asked, as the detective paused. "What's on your
mind? Going to arrest me?"</p>

<p>"Now, what made you think that?" The Inspector hooked a chair
towards him, kicking it into a position that commanded the door.
"Ever been in the United States, Mr. Persus?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What of it?"</p>

<p>"Then you know their police have an excellent facility. They get
out a 'John Doe' warrant and detain anyone they think would make a
material witness of the prosecution."</p>

<p>"You think I know something?"</p>

<p>"Sure of it." Paull nodded, in satisfaction. "You've just told
me so."</p>

<p>"I told you?" The man sneered, openly.</p>

<p>"'Course! Didn't you tell me that Miss Anstey was here
when&mdash;er&mdash;David Delaney died? What's that but a hint that
you were here, yourself?"</p>

<p>For a full minute Persus looked at the Inspector, the colour
fading from his face. Then, without warning, he struck at the
police officer. Paull had expected something of the kind to happen
and was on the alert. The man found himself caught in a grip of
iron and forced back into a chair. For a moment he struggled
against the detective, then became passive.</p>

<p>"That's right, little man," Paull smiled genially. "Now we'll
get along." He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Nearly four o'clock. The others will be here, soon."</p>

<p>"Mr. Paull!" Maude Anstey looked up at the detective with wide,
frightened eyes. "You don't&mdash;don't believe what he said?"</p>

<p>"But I do, my dear girl." The Inspector's, smile was reassuring.
"You puzzled me at first, but when I had time to reason things out
I began to&mdash;Well, what shall I say? I can't say,
suspect&mdash;I don't want to say, doubt. No, neither of them will
do. I'll just remark that if you'd come in this office without
knowing what to expect, you'd have shown a lot more agitation.
There's others in the same boat. Perhaps we'll get at the root of
the business this afternoon."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you&mdash;think&mdash;David&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Wait and see."</p>

<p>The detective turned at the opening of the door. "Ah, there you
are, Mrs. Weston. And Mr. Sinclair, as well. Sorry to have had to
leave you that note this morning, Mr. Sinclair&mdash;but if you
people call in the police and then try to keep them in the
dark&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bill Sinclair opened his mouth to speak, then thought better of
it and coloured slightly. The Inspector placed a chair for Mrs.
Weston.</p>

<p>"Sorry I had to cancel your journey home." He chatted easily to
Mrs. Weston. "Oh, I should have introduced Miss Anstey. Miss Maude
Anstey, a fellow artist of Mr. Delaney and&mdash;No, we'll leave
that for a time&mdash;just till we see how things work out. Then
there's Mr. Persus, traveller for a firm who makes metal plates
used by etchers. Good plates, too. I've got one in my pocket and a
real fine etching on it. Not going to leave us, Mr. Persus. I
thought I had persuaded you to stay, and see the
drama&mdash;er&mdash;comedy, I should say, worked out."</p>

<p>"Aw, get on with it and less talk." The man turned his back on
the detective.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Paull went to his seat. "There's three more people to
come and I'd have liked to have waited for at least one of them. A
Mr. Delaney&mdash;no, not David Delaney, but his brother, Ernest.
He's a&mdash;Ah, here he is."</p>

<p>The detective broke off as the door opened.

<p>"Know Mrs. Weston,
Mr. Delaney? Of course, she's your aunt. And Mr.
Sinclair&mdash;going to be your brother-in-law. Then there's Mr.
Persus. Ah, I thought you knew him. If you hadn't&mdash;" His voice
died away in a little rumble.</p>

<p>"What's this gathering for?" Sinclair swung sharply on the
detective. "And where's Dora? You rang me up, midday, and told me
she'd be here this afternoon."</p>

<p>"T'isn't over yet." Paull grinned and crossed his stout legs,
comfortably. "The ladies object to a little smoking? Thanks. Now
we'll get along."</p>

<p>For a considerable time he was silent, busy lighting one of the
rank stogies he favoured. The cigar drawing freely, he looked up,
glancing around the little circle, inquisitively.</p>

<p>"Time we made a start." He glanced at his watch. "I'm going back
to when Miss Anstey rang up the Police Department and reported that
she had come here to find Mr. Delaney at his desk&mdash;dead."
Again he paused, meditatively. "There was one thing I noticed and
thought queer."</p>

<p>Paull resumed, after a satisfying puff or two at his cigar. "A
girl who comes to her office in the morning to find a dead man
there, is usually much disturbed. Miss Anstey appeared, to me, to
take it as a matter of course." He paused and smiled at the girl.
"All right, m'dear! It does sound tough that way, but I'm speaking
of things as they struck me.</p>

<p>"I asked Miss Anstey what time she usually left the office and
she told me, about five o'clock. At the same time I noticed that
she had, for some considerable time, been wearing an engagement
ring&mdash;and that that morning it was missing. By the way, Miss
Anstey, got that ring here?"</p>

<p>Without replying, the girl opened her hand-bag and produced a
half-hoop of diamonds. At the detective's nod she slipped it on her
finger.</p>

<p>"That's better." Paull turned to the others. "Lad&mdash;no, lady
and gentlemen. May I introduce Mr. David Delaney's fiancée?"</p>

<p>"But David Delaney is dead," exclaimed Sinclair.</p>

<p>"So he is." Paull bent a peculiar look at the young author.
"Now, if you'll let me continue my report? Thanks. I found
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Delaney seated at his office table in rather
peculiar surroundings. I am not going to mention them for you are
all well acquainted with the facts. I made just one mistake there.
Perhaps it has caused some confusion. If so, I'm sorry. After all,
I'm only a fat policeman and not supposed to possess brains.</p>

<p>"Before I left this office," continued Paull, after a pause, "I
came to the conclusion that David Delaney was mixed up with a gang
of forgers&mdash;that he was making the etching plates from which
the notes were printed. That's right, Mr. Sinclair, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The young man nodded, miserably.</p>

<p>"And you, Miss Anstey?"</p>

<p>"He was tempted." The girl answered spiritedly. "But&mdash;he
didn't."</p>

<p>"No," Paull interposed. "Here's the first and last plate David
Delaney etched. A darned good one, I'll say that, but he hid it so
effectively that the crooks had it in their hands and didn't know
it. Now, why was David Delaney tempted to break the law?"</p>

<p>"May I?" Maude Anstey spoke slowly. At the detective's nod she
faltered then continued bravely. "David and I have been engaged for
some time. We wanted to get married, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Natural." Paull smiled cheerfully. He turned to the metal plate
traveller. "Now, Mr. Persus, I'll have those notes."</p>

<p>"What notes?" The man gasped.</p>

<p>"Not banknotes." There was real enjoyment in Paull's laugh.
"Just those P.N.'s that David Delaney signed for money borrowed
from you to pay his debts in the speculations you led him
into."</p>

<p>"I'll see you damned!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit." The detective held out his hand and after a few
seconds hesitation Persus took from his pocket a bundle of papers
and handed them over.</p>

<p>"That's good." He tossed the papers to the girl. "You'd better
take charge of them, Miss Anstey&mdash;at least for the time.
Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Persus came to David Delaney and pressed for payment of the
notes," the girl continued rapidly. "David couldn't pay. He had not
the money. Then, that man insisted that David worked the notes out.
David was willing to do that in legitimate work, but refused to
make plates for banknote printing." The girl hesitated. "I was
away for a time and during my absence Mr. Persus induced David to
try his hand on a plate&mdash;that one." She pointed to the plate
Paull had placed on the desk.</p>

<p>"When I returned I was able to convince David that he was making
a mistake. He wouldn't destroy the plate, but he covered it with a
sheet of copper, concealing the etching."</p>

<p>"Good!" Paull interrupted. "Now, m'dear. Get on to the night of
the murder.</p>

<p>"I left the office at five o'clock, as I said." The girl spoke
dully. "David came with me and we had dinner, together. I had to
make a call and we arranged that he was to come back here and
finish the illustration for Bill's story. I was to call for him
soon after half-past seven and we intended to go to the
pictures."</p>

<p>"You did come back here?" Paull questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes." Maude Anstey hesitated. "To find&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A man seated in the chair before David Delaney's
desk&mdash;dead?"</p>

<p>The quick opening of the office door prevented the girl
answering. Two men and a woman entered the office. Immediately the
woman passed the counter she ran to Bill Sinclair.</p>

<p>"Dora!"</p>

<p>"Bill!"</p>

<p>"Where have you been to?" the young author questioned,
anxiously. Before she could answer Maude Anstey had run to one of
the men passing the counter.</p>

<p>"Davy! Oh, Davy, I've been so frightened for you!"</p>

<p>The man glared round the office, over the girl's head. Paull
stepped forward, a warning in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you, Mr. David Delaney." The smile on his lips
broadened. "Should I say I'm glad to welcome you back to life?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-10" name="ch-10">X</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"QUITE a queer case." Inspector Paull was seated
in Superintendent Manners' office, pulling steadily on one of the
rank stogies he offended his fellow-mortals by smoking. "Rather
enjoyed it, towards the end, though they had me beat, at
first."</p>

<p>"Can't quite make head or tail of it, yet." Manners frowned
perplexedly. "David Delaney's strangled, then turns up full of life
to marry a pretty girl."</p>

<p>"And I'm to give away the bride," Paull grinned. "Don't know
what my missus'll say. She's always declaring you give me the cases
where I get mixed up with a lot of girls."</p>

<p>"Get that out of your head." The Superintendent spoke quickly.
"I've a great respect for Mrs. Paull and I'm not going to quarrel
with her just because she's got a lying, tricky, good-for-nothing,
girl-chasing husband. No, sir! Get that, straight!</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Manners drowned Paull's defence.</p>

<p>"You came here to tell me the true story of the Delaney case.
Now, get on with it."</p>

<p>Paull sighed, trying to pose as the much misunderstood man. He
rolled the stogie between his lips, and a broad grin spread over
his fat, good-humoured face.</p>

<p>"A real strange tale!" He laughed, in anticipation. "Now, if
you'll let me do some of the talking, I'll make it plain to
you."</p>

<p>He waited a few seconds, then continued.</p>

<p>"First thing I noticed when I got down to Random Buildings was
that Miss Anstey did not appear so greatly distressed at finding a
dead man in her office when she arrived, yesterday morning. I
wondered a bit, but not so much as when I found that she had been
in the habit of wearing an engagement ring, and wasn't wearing it
then. An hour or so later I came across another lady who seemed to
think that the murder of a brother was a casual happening of
life.</p>

<p>"The two things set me thinking. It wasn't long before the few
brains I'm credited with put me on the right trail. Here it is!</p>

<p>"David Delaney managed to get in the toils of a man named Robert
Persus. Persus is a scoundrel who doesn't care where the money
comes from so long as there is plenty of it. He saw that Delaney's
ability as an artist could be turned to fruitful account in the
banknote industry. But first, he had to get him in the right frame
of mind."</p>

<p>Again Paull paused, to critically examine his stogie. "David
Delaney was engaged to his assistant, Maude Anstey, and wanted to
get married. That was Persus' opportunity. He induced Delaney to
enter into a series of speculations, lending him the money for the
purpose and acting as financial adviser. Naturally, the
speculations failed. Now Persus had Delaney where he wanted him. He
offered to hand back his Promissory Notes to Delaney if he would
make a series of banknote etchings. Delaney half-fell for the
trick and Persus sent the plates to his office."</p>

<p>"I don't think Delaney is a very strong character&mdash;one of
those inferiority complexes that seem to be all the rage
now-a-days." Paull continued after a pause. "I'm guessing that he
confided his predicament to his sweetheart and that she opposed the
proposition bitterly. That enraged Persus and he brought into the
game a printer from North Sydney, named Chalmers."</p>

<p>"The dead man!" exclaimed Manners, interestedly. "Now how did
Delaney come to kill Chalmers?"</p>

<p>"He didn't, or he'd be in the Central Police Station cells now."
Paull spoke imperturbably. "I'm going to draw your attention to the
afternoon before the murder took place.</p>

<p>"Maude Anstey knew something of her lover's irresponsible, or
should I say, artistic, character. She worked on him to break with
Persus and tell him to do his worst regarding the P.N.'s. But, in
the meantime, Delaney had commenced to make one of the etchings.
Maud Anstey found him at work on it and persuaded him to telephone
Persus that he wouldn't go on with the scheme. Persus was furious
and wanted to meet Delaney and argue the matter out. Backed by the
girl, Delaney refused to meet the man."</p>

<p>"Yet he kept the plate he had made," suggested the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>"That's so." Paull drew strongly on his cigar. A few seconds and
he continued. "He kept the plate, but to hide it covered it with a
thin plate of copper. That happened the afternoon before the
murder."</p>

<p>"Well?" Manners questioned, as Paull hesitated. "About six
o'clock Delaney and Miss Anstey went out to dinner. During the meal
they came to a complete agreement&mdash;that Delaney was to cut
Persus, absolutely. Then they parted for a time. Miss Anstey to
call on some girl; Delaney to return to his offices and complete
the illustrations he was making for Sinclair's story. He had only
an hour or so of work before him. Then the girl was to call at the
offices for him and they planned the pictures for the rest of the
evening."</p>

<p>"What happened during Miss Anstey's absence I don't quite
understand&mdash;perhaps we shall never know. Anyway, Delaney met a
friend and yarned with him for some time. He only got back to his
offices a few minutes before the girl arrived. She entered his room
to find him standing beside the desk, staring down on a man seated
in his chair, strangled."</p>

<p>"Who by?"</p>

<p>"Persus confessed to the deed." Paull spoke slowly. "He says he
had arranged to take Chalmers to Delaney's offices to arrange there
the printing of the notes. When Chalmers heard that Delaney refused
to go on with the scheme, he also tried to draw out. I think,"
added Paull, "that Persus held him by similar means to those he
tried to bind Delaney with."</p>

<p>"And Persus killed Chalmers in Delaney's offices? Why?"</p>

<p>"To incriminate Delaney," the detective answered quickly.
"Printers are plentiful&mdash;there are dozens of little printers
whom Persus could use. But etchers of Delaney's quality are few and
rare."</p>

<p>"Well?" Again Manners showed impatience.</p>

<p>"There's little more." Paull laughed gently. "The plan to leave
Chalmers in Delaney's offices and bring in the police, claiming
that the murdered man was Delaney, can be credited to Miss Anstey.
She evolved it to puzzle and frighten Persus. It did. The man
couldn't understand That set him improving on his original
plan&mdash;an always fatal thing for a crook wanted by the police
to do. To straighten matters to his liking again, Persus tried out
another scheme."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"He planned to get Dora Delaney in his power and through her
bring Delaney under his thumb again. Strange, he planned to use the
house next door to the Delaney cottage, where David Delaney was
hiding. He was watching the cottage when Dora left to accompany
Sinclair to the tram-stop. He caught the girl while she was
returning home alone and carried her into the house, confining her
in one of the rooms. Of course, David Delaney was on the watch and,
when Persus left, released his sister. They arranged to stay in the
house, hiding, until I had got on the scoundrel's, track. They had
plenty of provisions and could jump the fence to their home, next
door, for clothing and things. Fact, Miss Delaney told me that if I
hadn't tumbled to Persus's game so soon she would have come to
Police Headquarters in search of me, and confessed the whole
thing."</p>

<p>"But the raid on your house? How could Persus get away with that
while he was abducting Dora Delaney at North Sydney?" objected the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>"I worked that out." The Inspector showed interest. "It was a
neatly planned game. Persus had a fast a car awaiting him at Dale
Park. Immediately he had secured Miss Delaney, he jumped in the car
and came to Ashfield. The times are close, but he was specially
favoured with a wet night and little traffic on the road. Then he
managed to run a punt across the harbour, without waiting. A real
genius scheme!"</p>

<p>"Then Persus was 'The Three Snails?'" Manners laughed.</p>

<p>"He planned to make Delaney, Chalmers and himself 'The Three
Snails.'" A broad smile illuminated the Inspector's cheerful
countenance. "At the end he carried the triple load himself, and it
broke his back&mdash;or shall we say, neck?"</p>

<p>"While the rest of the characters in the story live happy ever
after." Manners turned to his desk.</p>

<p>"Including the investigating detective," suggested Paull
meekly.</p>

<p>"Him?" The Superintendent swung round on his chair, in
stimulated amazement. "Him? Why, when he wakes up from this latest
pipe dream of his I'm going to give him a real mystery to
investigate."</p>
