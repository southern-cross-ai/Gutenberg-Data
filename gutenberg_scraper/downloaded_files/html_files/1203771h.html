  <h2><a name="pt1"
     id="pt1">THE CAVE GIRL</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="cha1"
     id="cha1">I. &mdash; FLOTSAM</a></h2>

<p class="first">The dim shadow of the thing was but a blur
against the dim shadows of the wood behind it.</p>

<p>The young man could distinguish no outline that might mark the
presence as either brute or human.</p>

<p>He could see no eyes, yet he knew that somewhere from out of
that noiseless mass stealthy eyes were fixed upon him.</p>

<p>This was the fourth time that the thing had crept out from the
wood as darkness was settling&mdash;the fourth time during those
three horrible weeks since he 	had been cast upon that lonely
shore that he had watched, terror-stricken, while night engulfed
the shadowy form that lurked at the forest's edge.</p>

<p>It had never attacked him, but to his distorted imagination it
seemed to slink closer and closer as night fell&mdash;waiting,
always waiting for the moment that it might find him
unprepared.</p>

<p>Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones was not overly courageous. He had
been reared among surroundings of culture plus and ultra-
intellectuality in the exclusive Back Bay home of his ancestors.</p>

<p>He had been taught to look with contempt upon all that savored of
muscular superiority&mdash;such things were gross, brutal,
primitive.</p>

<p>It had been a giant intellect only that he had
craved&mdash;he and a fond mother&mdash;and their wishes had been
fulfilled. At twenty-one Waldo was an animated
encyclopedia&mdash;and about as muscular as a real one.</p>

<p>Now he slunk shivering with fright at the very edge of the
beach, as far from the grim forest as he could get.</p>

<p>Cold sweat broke from every pore of his long, lank, six-foot-
two body. His skinny arms and legs trembled as with palsy.
Occasionally he coughed&mdash;it had been the cough that had
banished him upon this ill-starred sea voyage.</p>

<p>As he crouched in the sand, staring with wide, horror-dilated
eyes into the black night, great tears rolled down his thin,
white cheeks.</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that he restrained an overpowering
desire to shriek. His mind was filled with forlorn regrets that
he had not remained at home to meet the wasting death that the
doctor had predicted&mdash;a peaceful death at least&mdash;not
the brutal end which faced him now.</p>

<p>The lazy swell of the South Pacific lapped his legs, stretched
upon the sand, for he had retreated before that menacing shadow
as far as the ocean would permit. As the slow minutes dragged
into age-long hours, the nervous strain told so heavily upon the
weak boy that toward midnight he lapsed into merciful
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>The warm sun awoke him the following morning, but it brought
with it but a faint renewal of courage. Things could not creep to
his side unseen now, but still they could come, for the sun would
not protect him. Even now some savage beast might be lurking just
within the forest.</p>

<p>The thought unnerved him to such an extent that he dared not
venture to the woods for the fruit that had formed the major
portion of his sustenance. Along the beach he picked up a few
mouthfuls of sea-food, but that was all.</p>

<p>The day passed, as had the other terrible days which had
preceded it, in scanning alternately the ocean and the forest's
edge&mdash;the one for a ship and the other for the cruel death
which he momentarily expected to see stalk out of the dreary
shades to claim him.</p>

<p>A more practical and a braver man would have constructed some
manner of shelter in which he might have spent his nights in
comparative safety and comfort, but Waldo Emerson's education had
been conducted along lines of undiluted
intellectuality&mdash;pursuits and knowledge which were practical
were commonplace, and commonplaces were vulgar. It was
preposterous that a Smith-Jones should ever have need of vulgar
knowledge.</p>

<p>For the twenty-second time since the great wave had washed him
from the steamer's deck and hurled him, choking and sputtering,
upon this inhospitable shore, Waldo Emerson saw the sun sinking
rapidly toward the western horizon.</p>

<p>As it descended the young
man's terror increased, and he kept his eyes glued upon the spot
from which the shadow had emerged the previous evening.</p>

<p>He felt
that he could not endure another night of the torture he had
passed through four times before. That he should go mad he was
positive, and he commenced to tremble and whimper even while
daylight yet remained. For a time he tried turning his back to
the forest, and then he sat huddled up gazing out upon the ocean;
but the tears which rolled down his cheeks so blurred his eyes
that he saw nothing.</p>

<p>Finally he could endure it no longer, and with a sudden gasp
of horror he wheeled toward the wood. There was nothing visible,
yet he broke down and sobbed like a child, for loneliness and
terror.</p>

<p>When he was able to control his tears for a moment he took the
opportunity to scan the deepening shadows once more.</p>

<p>The first glance brought a piercing shriek from his white
lips.</p>

<p>The thing was there!</p>

<p>The young man did not fall groveling to the sand this
time&mdash;instead, he stood staring with protruding eyes at the
vague form, while shriek after shriek broke from his grinning
lips.</p>

<p>Reason was tottering.</p>

<p>The thing, whatever it was, halted at the first blood-curdling
cry, and then when the cries continued it slunk back toward the
wood.</p>

<p>With what remained of his ebbing mentality Waldo Emerson
realized that it were better to die at once than face the awful
fears of the black night. He would rush to meet his fate, and
thus end this awful agony of suspense.</p>

<p>With the thought came action, so that, still shrieking, he
rushed headlong toward the thing at the wood's rim. As he ran it
turned and fled into the forest, and after it went Waldo Emerson,
his long, skinny legs carrying his emaciated body in great leaps
and bounds through the tearing underbrush.</p>

<p>He emitted shriek after shriek&mdash;ear-piercing shrieks that
ended in long drawn out wails, more wolfish than human. And the
thing that fled through the night before him was shrieking, too,
now.</p>

<p>Time and again the young man stumbled and fell. Thorns and
brambles tore his clothing and his soft flesh. Blood smeared him
from head to feet. Yet on and on he rushed through the semi-
darkness of the now moonlit forest.</p>

<p>At first impelled by the mad desire to embrace death and wrest
the peace of oblivion from its cruel clutch, Waldo Emerson had
come to pursue the screaming shadow before him from an entirely
different motive. Now it was for companionship. He screamed now
because of a fear that the thing would elude him and that he
should be left alone in the depth of this weird wood.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely it was drawing away from him, and as Waldo
Emerson realized the fact he redoubled his efforts to overtake
it. He had stopped screaming now, for the strain of his physical
exertion found his weak lungs barely adequate to the needs of his
gasping respiration.</p>

<p>Suddenly the pursuit emerged from the forest to cross a little
moonlit clearing, at the opposite side of which towered a high
and rocky cliff. Toward this the fleeing creature sped, and in an
instant more was swallowed, apparently, by the face of the
cliff.</p>

<p>Its disappearance was as mysterious and awesome as its
identity had been, and left the young man in blank despair.</p>

<p>With the object of pursuit gone, the reaction came, and Waldo
Emerson sank trembling and exhausted at the foot of the cliff. A
paroxysm of coughing seized him, and thus he lay in an agony of
apprehension, fright, and misery until from very weakness he sank
into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>It was daylight when he awoke&mdash;stiff, lame, sore, hungry,
and miserable&mdash;but, withal, refreshed and sane. His first
consideration was prompted by the craving of a starved stomach;
yet it was with the utmost difficulty that he urged his cowardly
brain to direct his steps toward the forest, where hung fruit in
abundance.</p>

<p>At every little noise he halted in tense silence, poised to
flee. His knees trembled so violently that they knocked together;
but at length he entered the dim shadows, and presently was
gorging himself with ripe fruits.</p>

<p>To reach some of the more luscious viands he had picked from
the ground a piece of fallen limb, which tapered from a diameter
of four inches at one end to a trifle over an inch at the other.
It was the first practical thing that Waldo Emerson had done
since he had been cast upon the shore of his new home&mdash;in
fact, it was, in all likelihood, the nearest approximation to a
practical thing which he had ever done in all his life.</p>

<p>Waldo had never been allowed to read fiction, nor had he ever
cared to so waste his time or impoverish his brain, and nowhere
in the fund of deep erudition which he had accumulated could he
recall any condition analogous to those which now confronted
him.</p>

<p>Waldo, of course, knew that there were such things as step-
ladders, and had he had one he would have used it as a means to
reach the fruit above his hand's reach; but that he could knock
the delicacies down with a broken branch seemed indeed a mighty
discovery&mdash;a valuable addition to the sum total of human
knowledge. Aristotle himself had never reasoned more
logically.</p>

<p>Waldo had taken the first step in his life toward independent
mental action&mdash;heretofore his ideas, his thoughts, his acts,
even, had been borrowed from the musty writing of the ancients,
or directed by the immaculate mind of his superior mother. And he
clung to his discovery as a child clings to a new toy.</p>

<p>When he emerged from the forest he brought his stick with
him.</p>

<p>He determined to continue the pursuit of the creature that had
eluded him the night before. It would, indeed, be curious to look
upon a thing that feared him.</p>

<p>In all his life he had never imagined it possible that any
creature could flee from him in fear. A little glow suffused the
young man as the idea timorously sought to take root.</p>

<p>Could it be that there was a trace of swagger in that long,
bony figure as Waldo directed his steps toward the cliff? Perish
the thought! Pride in vulgar physical prowess! A long line of
Smith-Joneses would have risen in their graves and rent their
shrouds at the veriest hint of such an idea.</p>

<p>For a long time Waldo walked back and forth along the foot of
the cliff, searching for the avenue of escape used by the
fugitive of yesternight. A dozen times he passed a well-defined
trail that led, winding, up the cliff's face; but Waldo knew
nothing of trails&mdash;he was looking for a flight of steps or a
doorway.</p>

<p>Finding neither, he stumbled by accident into the trail; and,
although the evident signs that marked it as such revealed
nothing to him, yet he followed it upward for the simple reason
that it was the only place upon the cliff side where he could
find a foothold.</p>

<p>Some distance up he came to a narrow cleft in
the cliff into which the trail led. Rocks dislodged from above
had fallen into it, and, becoming wedged a few feet from the
bottom, left only a small cavelike hole, into which Waldo
peered.</p>

<p>There was nothing visible, but the interior was dark and
forbidding. Waldo felt cold and clammy. He began to tremble. Then
he turned and looked back toward the forest.</p>

<p>The thought of another night spent within sight of that dismal
place almost overcame him. No! A thousand times no! Any fate were
better than that, and so after several futile efforts he forced
his unwilling body through the small aperture.</p>

<p>He found himself on a path between two rocky walls&mdash;a
path that rose before him at a steep angle. At intervals the blue
sky was visible above through openings that had not been filled
with debris.</p>

<p>To another it would have been apparent that the cleft had been
kept open by human beings&mdash;that it was a thoroughfare which
was used, if not frequently, at least sufficiently often to
warrant considerable labor having been expended upon it to keep
it free from the debris which must be constantly falling from
above.</p>

<p>Where the path led, or what he expected to find at the other
end, Waldo had not the remotest idea. He was not an imaginative
youth. But he kept on up the ascent in the hope that at the end
he would find the creature which had escaped him the night
before.</p>

<p>As it had fled for a brief instant across the clearing
beneath the moon's soft rays, Waldo had thought that it bore a
remarkable resemblance to a human figure; but of that he could
not be positive.</p>

<p>At last his path broke suddenly into the sunlight. The walls
on either side were but little higher than his head, and a moment
later he emerged from the cleft onto a broad and beautiful
plateau.</p>

<p>Before him stretched a wide, grassy plain, and beyond
towered a range of mighty hills. Between them and him lay a belt
of forest.</p>

<p>A new emotion welled in the breast of Waldo Emerson Smith-
Jones. It was akin to that which Balboa may have felt when he
gazed for the first time upon the mighty Pacific from the Sierra
de Quarequa. For the moment, as he contemplated this new and
beautiful scene of rolling meadowland, distant forest, and
serrated hilltops, he almost forgot to be afraid. And on the
impulse of the instant he set out across the tableland to explore
the unknown which lay beyond the forest.</p>

<p>Well it was for Waldo Emerson's peace of mind that no faint
conception of what lay there entered his unimaginative mind. To
him a land without civilization&mdash;without cities and towns
peopled by humans with manners and customs similar to those which
obtain in Boston&mdash;was beyond belief.</p>

<p>As he walked he strained his eyes in every direction for some
indication of human habitation&mdash;a fence, a
chimney&mdash;anything that would be man-built; but his efforts
were unrewarded.</p>

<p>At the verge of the forest he halted, fearing to enter; but at
last, when he saw that the wood was more open than that near the
ocean, and that there was but little underbrush, he mustered
sufficient courage to step timidly within.</p>

<p>On careful tiptoe he threaded his way through the parklike
grove, stopping every few minutes to listen, and ready at the
first note of danger to fly screaming toward the open plain.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his fears, he reached the opposite boundary of
the forest without seeing or hearing anything to arouse
suspicion, and, emerging from the cool shade, found himself a
little distance from a perpendicular white cliff, the face of
which was honeycombed with the mouths of many caves.</p>

<p>There was no living creature in sight, nor did the very
apparent artificiality of the caves suggest to the impractical
Waldo that they might be the habitations of perhaps savage human
beings.</p>

<p>With the spell of discovery still upon him, he crossed the
open toward the cliffs; but he had by no means forgotten his
chronic state of abject fear. Ears and eyes were alert for hidden
dangers; every few steps were punctuated by a timid halt and a
searching survey of his surroundings.</p>

<p>It was during one of these halts, when he had crossed half the
distance between the forest and the cliff, that he discerned a
slight movement in the wood behind him.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood staring and frozen, unable to
determine whether he had been mistaken or really had seen a
creature moving in the forest.</p>

<p>He had about decided that he had but imagined a presence when
a great, hairy brute of a man stepped suddenly from behind the
bole of a tree.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="cha2" id="cha2">II. &mdash; THE WILD PEOPLE</a></h2>

<p class="first">The creature was naked except for a bit of hide
that hung from a leathern waist thong.</p>

<p>If Waldo viewed the newcomer with wonder, it was no less than
the wonder which the sight of him inspired in the breast of the
hairy one, for what he saw was as truly remarkable to his eyes as
was his appearance to those of the cultured Bostonian. And Waldo
did indeed present a most startling exterior. His six-feet-two
was accentuated by his extreme skinniness; his gray eyes looked
weak and watery within the inflamed circles which rimmed them,
and which had been produced by loss of sleep and much
weeping.</p>

<p>His yellow hair was tangled and matted, and streaked with dirt
and blood. Blood stained his soiled and tattered ducks. His shirt
was but a mass of frayed ribbons held to him at all only by the
neck-band.</p>

<p>As he stood helplessly staring with bulging eyes at the awful
figure glowering at him from the forest his jaw dropped, his
knees trembled, and he seemed about to collapse from sheer
terror.</p>

<p>Then the hideous man crouched and came creeping warily toward
him.</p>

<p>With an agonized scream Waldo turned and fled toward the
cliff. A quick glance over his shoulder brought another series of
shrieks from the frightened fugitive, for it revealed not alone
the fact that the awful man was pursuing him, but that behind him
raced at least a dozen more equally frightful.</p>

<p>Waldo ran toward the cliffs only because that direction lay
straight away from his pursuers. He had no idea what he should do
when he reached the rocky barrier&mdash;he was far too frightened
to think.</p>

<p>His pursuers were gaining upon him, their savage yells
mingling with his piercing cries and spurring him on to
undreamed-of pinnacles of speed. As he ran, his knees came nearly
to his shoulders at each frantic bound; his left hand was
extended far ahead, clutching wildly at the air as though he were
endeavoring to pull himself ahead, while his right hand, still
grasping the cudgel, described a rapid circle, like the arm of a
windmill gone mad. In action Waldo was an inspiring
spectacle.</p>

<p>At the foot of the cliff he came to a momentary halt, while he
glanced hurriedly about for a means of escape; but now he saw
that the enemy had spread out toward the right and left, leaving
no means of escape except up the precipitous side of the cliff.
Up this narrow trails led steeply from ledge to ledge.</p>

<p>In places crude ladders scaled perpendicular heights from one
tier of caves to the next above; but to Waldo the thing which
confronted him seemed absolutely unscalable, and then another
backward glance showed him the rapidly nearing enemy; and he
launched himself at the face of that seemingly impregnable
barrier, clutching desperately with fingers and toes.</p>

<p>His progress was impeded by the cudgel to which he still
clung, but he did not drop it; though why it would have been
difficult to tell, unless it was that his acts were not purely
mechanical, there being no room in his mind for aught else than
terror.</p>

<p>Close behind him came the foremost cave man; yet, though he
had acquired the agility of a monkey through a lifetime of
practice, he was amazed at the uncanny speed with which Waldo
Emerson clawed his shrieking way aloft.</p>

<p>Half-way up the ascent, however, a great hairy hand came
almost to his ankle. It was during the perilous negotiation of
one of the loose and wobbly ladders&mdash;little more than small
trees leaning precariously against the perpendicular rocky
surface&mdash;that the nearest foe-man came so close to the
fugitive; but at the top chance intervened to save Waldo, for a
time at least. It was at the moment that he scrambled frantically
to a tiny ledge from the frightfully slipping sapling. In his
haste he did by accident what a resourceful man would have done
by intent&mdash;in pushing himself onto the ledge he kicked the
ladder outward&mdash;for a second it hung toppling in the
balance, and then with a lunge crashed down the cliff's face with
its human burden, in its fall scraping others of the pursuing
horde with it.</p>

<p>A chorus of rage came up from below him, but Waldo had not
even turned his head to learn of his temporary good fortune. Up,
ever up he sped, until at length he stood upon the topmost ledge,
facing an overhanging wall of blank rock that towered another
twenty-five feet above him to the summit of the bluff.</p>

<p>Time and again he leaped futilely against the smooth surface,
tearing at it with his nails in a mad endeavor to climb still
higher. At his right was the low opening to a black cave, but he
did not see it&mdash;his mind could cope with but the single
idea: to clamber from the horrible creatures which pursued him.
But finally it was borne in on his half-mad brain that this was
the end&mdash;he could fly no farther&mdash;here, in a moment
more, death would overtake him.</p>

<p>He turned to meet it, and below saw a number of the cave men
placing another ladder in lieu of that which had fallen. In a
moment they were resuming the ascent after him.</p>

<p>On the narrow ledge above them the young man stood, chattering
and grinning like a madman. His pitiful cries were now punctuated
with the hollow coughing which his violent exercise had
induced.</p>

<p>Tears rolled down his begrimed face, leaving crooked, muddy
streaks in their wake. His knees smote together so violently that
he could barely stand, and it was into the face of this
apparition of cowardice that the first of the cave men looked as
he scrambled above the ledge on which Waldo stood.</p>

<p>And then, of a sudden, there rose within the breast of Waldo
Emerson Smith-Jones a spark that generations of over-refinement
and emasculating culture had all but extinguished&mdash;the
instinct of self-preservation by force. Heretofore it had been
purely by flight. With the frenzy of the fear of death upon him,
he raised his cudgel, and, swinging it high above his head,
brought it down full upon the unprotected skull of his enemy.</p>

<p>Another took the fallen man's place&mdash;he, too, went down
with a broken head. Waldo was fighting now like a cornered rat,
and through it all he chattered and gibbered; but he no longer
wept.</p>

<p>At first he was horrified at the bloody havoc he wrought with
his crude weapon. His nature revolted at the sight of blood, and
when he saw it mixed with matted hair along the side of his
cudgel, and realized that it was human hair and human blood, and
that he, Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, had struck the blows that had
plastered it there so thickly in all its hideousness, a wave of
nausea swept over him, so that he almost toppled from his dizzy
perch.</p>

<p>For a few minutes there was a lull in hostilities while the
cave men congregated below, shaking their fists at Waldo and
crying out threats and challenges. The young man stood looking
down upon them, scarcely able to realize that alone he had met
savage men in physical encounter and defeated them. He was
shocked and horrified; not, odd to say, because of the thing he
had done, but rather because of a strange and unaccountable glow
of pride in his brutal supremacy over brutes. What would his
mother have thought could she have seen her precious boy now?</p>

<p>Suddenly Waldo became conscious from the corner of his eye
that something was creeping upon him from behind out of the dark
cave before which he had fought. Simultaneously with the
realization of it he swung his cudgel in a wicked blow at this
new enemy as he turned to meet it.</p>

<p>The creature dodged back, and the blow that would have crushed
its skull grazed a hairbreadth from its face. Waldo struck no
second blow, and the cold sweat sprang to his forehead when he
realized how nearly he had come to murdering a young girl. She
crouched now in the mouth of the cave, eying him fearfully. Waldo
removed his tattered cap, bowing low.</p>

<p>"I crave your pardon," he said. "I had no idea that there was
a lady here. I am very glad that I did not injure you."</p>

<p>There must have been something either in his tone or manner
that reassured her, for she smiled and came out upon the ledge
beside him.</p>

<p>As she did so a scarlet flush mantled Waldo's face and neck
and ears&mdash;he could feel them burning. With a nervous cough
he turned and became intently occupied with the distant scenery.
Presently he cast a surreptitious glance behind him.</p>

<p>Shocking! She was still there. Again he coughed nervously.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said. "But&mdash;er&mdash;ah&mdash;you&mdash;I
am a total stranger, you know; hadn't you better go back in,
and&mdash;er&mdash;get your clothes?"</p>

<p>She made no reply, and so he forced himself to turn toward her
once more. She was smiling at him.</p>

<p>Waldo had never been so horribly embarrassed in all his life
before&mdash;it was a distinct shock to him to realize that the
girl was not embarrassed at all.</p>

<p>He spoke to her a second time, and at last she answered; but
in a tongue which he did not understand. It bore not the
slightest resemblance to any language, modern or dead, with which
he was familiar, and Waldo was more or less master of them
all&mdash;especially the dead ones.</p>

<p>He tried not to look at her after that, for he realized that
he must appear very ridiculous.</p>

<p>But now his attention was required by more pressing
affairs&mdash;the cave men were returning to the attack. They
carried stones this time, and, while some of them threw the
missiles at Waldo, the others attempted to rush his position. It
was then that the girl hurried back into the cave, only to
reappear a moment later carrying some stone utensils in her
arms.</p>

<p>There was a huge mortar in which she had collected a pestle
and several smaller pieces of stone. She pushed them along the
ledge to Waldo. At first he did not grasp the meaning of her act;
but presently she pretended to pick up an imaginary missile and
hurl it down upon the creatures below&mdash;then she pointed to
the things she had brought and to Waldo.</p>

<p>He understood. So she was upon his side. He did not understand
why, but he was glad.</p>

<p>Following her suggestion, he gathered up a couple of the
smaller objects and hurled them down upon the men beneath.</p>

<p>But on and on they came&mdash;Waldo was not a very good shot.
The girl was busy now gathering such of the cave men's missiles
as fell upon the ledge. These she placed in a pile beside
Waldo.</p>

<p>Occasionally the young man would strike an enemy by accident,
and then she would give a little scream of
pleasure&mdash;clapping her hands and jumping up and down.</p>

<p>It was not long before Waldo was surprised to find that this
applause fell sweetly upon his ears. It was then that he began to
take better aim.</p>

<p>In the midst of it there flashed suddenly upon him a picture
of his devoted mother and the select coterie of intellectual
young people with which she had always surrounded him.</p>

<p>Waldo felt a new pang of horror as he tried to realize with
what emotions they would look upon him now as he stood upon the
face of a towering cliff beside an almost naked girl hurling
rocks down upon the heads of hairy men who hopped about,
screaming with rage, below him.</p>

<p>It was awful! A great billow of mortification rolled over him.
He turned to cast a look of disapprobation at the shameless young
woman behind him&mdash;she should not think that he countenanced
such coarse and vulgar proceedings. Their eyes met&mdash;in hers
he saw the sparkle of excitement and the joy of life and such a
look of comradeship as he never before had seen in the eyes of
another mortal.</p>

<p>Then she pointed excitedly over the edge of the ledge.</p>

<p>Waldo looked. A great brute of a cave man had crawled, unseen,
almost to their refuge. He was but five feet below them, and at
the moment that he looked up Waldo dropped a fifty-pound stone
mortar full upon his upturned face.</p>

<p>The young woman emitted a little shriek of joy, and Waldo
Emerson Smith-Jones, his face bisected by a broad grin, turned
toward her.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="cha3" id="cha3">III. &mdash; THE LITTLE
EDEN</a></h2>

<p class="first">The mortar ended hostilities&mdash;temporarily,
at least; but the cave men loitered about the base of the cliff
during the balance of the afternoon, occasionally shouting taunts
at the two above them. These the girl answered, evidently in
kind. Sometimes she would point to Waldo and make ferocious
signs, doubtless indicative of the horrible slaughter which
awaited them at his hands if they did not go away and leave their
betters alone. When the young man realized the significance of
her pantomime he felt his heart swell with an emotion which he
feared was pride in brutal, primitive, vulgar physical
prowess.</p>

<p>As the long day wore on Waldo became both very hungry and very
thirsty. In the valley below he could see a tiny brooklet
purling, clear and beautiful, toward the south. The sight of it
drove him nearly mad, as did also that of the fruit which he
glimpsed hanging ripe for eating at the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>By means of signs he asked the girl if she, too, were hungry,
for he had come to a point now where he could look at her almost
without visible signs of mortification. She nodded her head and,
pointing toward the descending sun, made it plain to him that
after dark they would descend and eat.</p>

<p>The cave men had not left when darkness came, and it seemed to
Waldo a very foolhardy thing to venture down while they might be
about; but the girl made it so evident that she considered him an
invincible warrior that he was torn with the conflicting emotions
of cowardice and an unaccountable desire to appear well in her
eyes, that he might by his acts justify her belief in him.</p>

<p>It seemed very wonderful to Waldo that any one should look
upon him in the light of a tower of strength and a haven of
refuge; he was not quite certain in his own mind but that the
reputation might lead him into most uncomfortable and
embarrassing situations. Incidentally, he wondered if the girl
was a good runner; he hoped so.</p>

<p>It must have been quite near midnight when his companion
intimated that the time had arrived when they should fare forth
and dine. Waldo wanted her to go first, but she shrank close to
him, timidly, and held back.</p>

<p>There was nothing else for it, then, than to take the plunge,
though had the sun been shining it would have revealed a very
pale and wide-eyed champion, who slipped gingerly over the side
of the ledge to grope with his feet for a foothold beneath.</p>

<p>Half-way down the moon rose above the forest&mdash;a great,
full, tropic moon, that lighted the face of the cliff almost as
brilliantly as might the sun itself. It shone into the mouth of a
cave upon the ledge that Waldo had just reached in his descent,
revealing to the horrified eyes of the young man a great, hairy
form stretched in slumber not a yard from him. As he looked, the
wicked little eyes opened and looked straight into his.</p>

<p>With difficulty Waldo suppressed a shriek of dismay as he
turned to plunge madly down the precipitous trail. The girl had
not yet descended from the ledge above.</p>

<p>She must have sensed what had happened, for as Waldo turned to
fly she gave a little cry of terror. At the same instant the cave
man leaped to his feet. But the girl's voice had touched
something in the breast of Waldo Emerson which generations of
disuse had almost atrophied, and for the first time in his life
he did a brave and courageous thing.</p>

<p>He could easily have escaped the cave man and reached the
valley&mdash;alone; but at the first note of the young girl's cry
he wheeled and scrambled back to the ledge to face the burly,
primitive man, who could have crushed him with a single blow.</p>

<p>Waldo Emerson no longer trembled. His nerves and muscles were
very steady as he swung his cudgel in an arc that brought it
crashing down upon the upraised guarding arm of the cave man.</p>

<p>There was a snapping of bone beneath the blow, a scream of
pain&mdash;the man staggered back, the girl sprang to Waldo's
side from the ledge above, and hand in hand they turned and fled
down the face of the cliff.</p>

<p>From a dozen cave-mouths above issued a score of cave men, but
the fleeing pair were half-way across the clearing before the
slow-witted brutes were fully aware of what had happened. By the
time they had taken up the pursuit Waldo and the girl had entered
the forest.</p>

<p>For a few yards the latter led Waldo straight into the shadows
of the wood, then she turned abruptly toward the north, at right
angles to the course they had been pursuing.</p>

<p>She still clung to the young man's hand, nor did she slacken
her speed the least after they had entered the darkness beneath
the trees. She ran as surely and confidently through the
impenetrable night of the forest as though the way had been
lighted by flaming arcs; but Waldo was continually stumbling and
falling.</p>

<p>The sound of pursuit presently became fainter; it was apparent
that the cave men had continued on straight into the wood; but
the girl raced on with the panting Waldo for what seemed to the
winded young man an eternity. Presently, however, they came to
the banks of the little stream that had been visible from the
caves. Here the girl fell into a walk, and a moment later dragged
the Bostonian down a shelving bank into water that came above his
knees. Up the bed of the stream she led him, sometimes
floundering through holes so deep that they were entirely
submerged.</p>

<p>Waldo had never learned the vulgar art of swimming, so it was
that he would have drowned but for the strong, brown hand of his
companion, which dragged him, spluttering and coughing, through
one awful hole after another, until, half-strangled and entirely
panic-stricken, she hauled him safely upon a low, grassy bank at
the foot of a rocky wall which formed one side of a gorge,
through which the river boiled.</p>

<p>It must not be assumed that when Waldo Emerson returned to
face the hairy brute who threatened to separate him from his new-
found companion that by a miracle he had been transformed from a
hare into a lion&mdash;far from it.</p>

<p>Now that he had a moment in which to lie quite still and
speculate upon the adventures of the past hour, the reaction
came, and Waldo Emerson thanked the kindly night that obscured
from the eyes of the girl the pitiable spectacle of his palsied
limbs and trembling lip.</p>

<p>Once again he was in a blue funk, with shattered nerves that
begged to cry aloud in the extremity of their terror.</p>

<p>It was not warm in the damp canyon, through which the wind
swept over the cold water, so that to Waldo's mental anguish was
added the physical discomfort of cold and wet. He was indeed a
miserable figure as he lay huddled upon the sward, praying for
the rising of the sun, yet dreading the daylight that might
reveal him to his enemies.</p>

<p>But at last dawn came, and after a fitful sleep Waldo awoke to
find himself in a snug and beautiful little paradise hemmed in by
the high cliffs that flanked the river, upon a sloping grassy
shore that was all but invisible except from a short stretch of
cliff-top upon the farther side of the stream.</p>

<p>A few feet from him lay the girl.</p>

<p>She was still asleep. Her head was pillowed upon one firm,
brown arm. Her soft black hair fell in disorder across one cheek
and over the other arm, to spread gracefully upon the green grass
about her.</p>

<p>As Waldo looked he saw that she was very comely. Never before
had he seen a girl just like her. His young women friends had
been rather prim and plain, with long, white faces and thin lips
that scarcely ever dared to smile and scorned to unbend in
plebeian laughter.</p>

<p>This girl's lips seemed to have been made for
laughing&mdash;and for something else, though at the time it is
only fair to Waldo to say that he did not realize the full
possibilities that they presented.</p>

<p>As his eyes wandered along the lines of her young body his
Puritanical training brought a hot flush of embarrassment to his
face, and he deliberately turned his back upon her.</p>

<p>It was indeed awful to Waldo Emerson to contemplate, to say
the least, the unconventional position into which fate had forced
him. The longer he pondered it the redder he became. It was
frightful&mdash;what would his mother say when she heard of it?
What would this girl's mother say? But, more to the point,
and&mdash;horrible thought&mdash;what would her father or her
brothers do to Waldo if they found them thus together&mdash;and
she with only a scanty garment of skin about her waist&mdash;a
garment which reached scarcely below her knees at any point, and
at others terminated far above?</p>

<p>Waldo was chagrined. He could not understand what the girl
could be thinking of, for in other respects she seemed quite
nice, and he was sure that the great eyes of her reflected only
goodness and innocence.</p>

<p>While he sat thus, thinking, the girl awoke and with a merry
laugh addressed him.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Waldo quite severely.</p>

<p>He wished that he could speak her language, so that he could
convey to her a suggestion of the disapprobation which he felt
for her attire.</p>

<p>He was on the point of attempting it by signs, when she rose,
lithe and graceful as a tigress, and walked to the river's brim.
With a deft movement of her fingers she loosed the thong that
held her single garment, and as it fell to the ground Waldo, with
a horrified gasp, turned upon his face, burying his tightly
closed eyes in his hands.</p>

<p>Then the girl dived into the cool waters for her matutinal
bath.</p>

<p>She called to him several times to join her, but Waldo could
not look at the spectacle presented; his soul was scandalized. It
was some time after she emerged from the river before he dared
risk a hesitating glance. With a sigh of relief he saw that she
had donned her single garment, and thereafter he could look at
her unashamed when she was thus clothed. He felt that by
comparison it constituted a most modest gown.</p>

<p>Together they strolled along the river's edge gathering such
fruits and roots as the girl knew to be edible. Waldo Emerson
gathered those she indicated&mdash;with all his learning he found
it necessary to depend upon the untutored mind of this little
primitive maiden for guidance.</p>

<p>Then she taught him how to catch fish with a bent twig and a
lightning-like movement of her brown hands&mdash;or, rather,
tried to teach him, for he was far too slow and awkward to
succeed.</p>

<p>Afterward they sat upon the soft grass beneath the shade of a
wild fig-tree to eat the fish she had caught. Waldo wondered how
in the world the girl could make fire without matches, for he was
quite sure that she had none; and even should she be able to make
fire it would be quite useless, since she had neither cooking
utensils nor stove.</p>

<p>He was not left long in wonderment.</p>

<p>She arranged the fish in a little pile between them, and with
a sweet smile motioned to the man to partake; then she selected
one for herself, and while Waldo Emerson looked on in horror,
sunk her firm, white teeth into the raw fish.</p>

<p>Waldo turned away in sickening disgust.</p>

<p>The girl seemed surprised and worried that he did not eat.
Time and again she tried to coax him by signs to join her; but he
could not even look at her. He had tried, after the first wave of
revolt had subsided, but when he discovered that she ate the
entire fish, without bothering to clean it or remove the scales,
he became too ill to think of food.</p>

<p>Several times during the following week they ventured from
their hiding-place, and at these times it was evident from the
girl's actions that she was endeavoring to elude their enemies
and reach a place of safety other than that in which they were
concealed. But at each venture her quick ears or sensitive
nostrils warned her of the proximity of danger, so that they had
been compelled to hurry back into their little Eden.</p>

<p>During this period she taught Waldo many words of her native
tongue, so that by means of signs to bridge the gaps between,
they were able to communicate with a fair degree of satisfaction.
Waldo's mastery of the language was rapid.</p>

<p>On the tenth day the girl was able to make him understand that
she wished to escape with him to her own people; that these men
among whom he had found her were enemies of her tribe, and that
she had been hiding from them when Waldo stumbled upon her
cave.</p>

<p>"I fled," she said. "My mother was killed. My father took
another mate, always cruel to me. But when I had wandered into
the land of these enemies I was afraid, and would have returned
to my father's cave. But I had gone too far.</p>

<p>"I would have to run very fast to escape them. Once I ran down
a narrow path to the ocean. It was dark.</p>

<p>"As I wandered through the woods I came suddenly out upon a
beach, and there I saw a strange figure on the sand. It was you.
I wanted to learn what manner of man you were. But I was very
much afraid, so that I dared only watch you from a distance.</p>

<p>"Five times I came down to look at you. You never saw me until
the last time, then you set out after me, roaring in a horrible
voice.</p>

<p>"I was very much afraid, for I knew that you must be very
brave to live all alone by the edge of the forest without any
shelter, or even a stone to hurl at Nagoola, should he come out
of the woods to devour you."</p>

<p>Waldo Emerson shuddered. "Who is Nagoola?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You do not know Nagoola!" the girl exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>"Not by that name," replied Waldo.</p>

<p>"He is as large," she began in description, "as two men, and
black, with glossy coat. He has two yellow eyes, which see as
well by night as by day. His great paws are armed with mighty
claws. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>A rustling from the bushes which fringed the opposite cliff-
top caused her to turn, instantly alert.</p>

<p>"Ah," she whispered, "there is Nagoola now."</p>

<p>Waldo looked in the direction of her gaze.</p>

<p>It was well that the girl did not see his pallid face and
popping eyes as he looked into the evil mask of the great black
panther that crouched watching them from the river's further
bank.</p>

<p>Into Waldo's breast came great panic. It was only because his
fear-prostrated muscles refused to respond to his will that he
did not scurry, screaming, from the sight of that ferocious
countenance.</p>

<p>Then, through the fog of his cowardly terror, he heard again
the girl's sweet voice: "I knew that you must be very brave to
live all alone by the edge of that wicked forest."</p>

<p>For the first time in his life a wave of shame swept over
Waldo Emerson.</p>

<p>The girl called in a taunting voice to the panther, and then
turned, smiling, toward Waldo.</p>

<p>"How brave I am now," she laughed. "I am no longer afraid of
Nagoola. You are with me."</p>

<p>"No," said Waldo Emerson, in a very weak voice, "you need not
fear while I am with you."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried. "Slay him. How proud I should be to return to
my people with one who vanquished Nagoola, and wore his hide
about his loins as proof of his prowess."</p>

<p>"Y-yes," acquiesced Waldo faintly.</p>

<p>"But," continued the girl, "you have slain many of Nagoola's
brothers and sisters. It is no longer sport to kill one of his
kind."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," cried Waldo. "Yes, that is it&mdash;panthers
bore me now."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The girl clasped her hands in ecstasy. "How many have
you slain?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;why, let me see," the young man blundered. "As a
matter of fact, I never kept any record of the panthers I
killed."</p>

<p>Waldo was becoming frantic. He had never lied before in all
his life. He hated a lie and loathed a liar. He wondered why he
had lied now.</p>

<p>Surely it were nothing to boast of to have butchered one of
God's creatures&mdash;and as for claiming to have killed so many
that he could not recall the number, it was little short of
horrible. Yet he became conscious of a poignant regret that he
had not killed a thousand panthers, and preserved all the pelts
as evidence of his valor.</p>

<p>The panther still regarded them from the safety of the farther
shore. The girl drew quite close to Waldo in the instinctive plea
for protection that belongs to her sex. She laid a timid hand
upon his skinny arm and raised her great, trusting eyes to his
face in reverent adoration.</p>

<p>"How do you kill them?" she whispered. "Tell me."</p>

<p>Then it was that Waldo determined to make a clean breast of
it, and admit that he never before had seen a live panther. But
as he opened his mouth to make the humiliating confession he
realized, quite suddenly, why it was that he had lied&mdash;he
wished to appear well in the eyes of this savage, half-clothed
girl. He, Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, craved the applause of a
barbarian, and to win it had simulated that physical prowess
which generations of Smith-Joneses had viewed from
afar&mdash;disgusted, disapproving.</p>

<p>The girl repeated her question.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Waldo, "it is really quite simple. After I catch
them I beat them severely with a stick."</p>

<p>The girl sighed.</p>

<p>"How wonderful!" she said.</p>

<p>Waldo became the victim of a number of unpleasant
emotions&mdash;mortification for this suddenly developed moral
turpitude; apprehension for the future, when the girl might
discover him in his true colors; fear, consuming, terrible fear,
that she might insist upon his going forth at once to slay
Nagoola. But she did nothing of the kind, and presently the
panther tired of watching them and turned back into the tangle of
bushes behind him.</p>

<p>It was with a sigh of relief that Waldo saw him depart.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="cha4" id="cha4">IV. &mdash; DEATH'S DOORWAY</a></h2>

<p class="first">Late in the afternoon the girl suggested that
they start that night upon the journey toward her village.</p>

<p>"The bad men will not be abroad after dark," she said. "With
you at my side, I shall not fear Nagoola."</p>

<p>"How far is it to your village?" asked Waldo.</p>

<p>"It will take us three nights," she replied. "By day we must
hide, for even you could not vanquish a great number of bad men
should they attack you at once."</p>

<p>"No," said Waldo; "I presume not."</p>

<p>"It was very wonderful to watch you, though," she went on,
"when you battled upon the cliff-side, beating them down as they
came upon you. How brave you were! How terrible! You trembled
from rage."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Waldo, "I was quite angry. I always tremble
like that when my ire is excited. Sometimes I get so bad that my
knees knock together. If you ever see them do that you will
realize how exceedingly angry I am."</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured the girl.</p>

<p>Presently Waldo saw that she was laughing quietly to
herself.</p>

<p>A great fear rose in his breast. Could it be that she was less
gullible than she had appeared? Did she, after all, penetrate the
bombast with which he had sought to cloak his cowardice?</p>

<p>He finally mustered sufficient courage to ask: "Why do you
laugh?"</p>

<p>"I think of the surprise that awaits old Flatfoot and Korth
and the others when I lead you to them."</p>

<p>"Why will they be surprised?" asked Waldo.</p>

<p>"At the way you will crack their heads."</p>

<p>Waldo shuddered.</p>

<p>"Why should I crack their heads?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why should you crack their heads!" It was apparently
incredible to the girl that he should not understand.</p>

<p>"How little you know," she said. "You cannot swim, you do not
know the language which men may understand, you would be lost in
the woods were I to leave you, and now you say that you do not
know that when you come to a strange tribe they will try to kill
you, and only take you as one of them when you have proven your
worth by killing at least one of their strongest men."</p>

<p>"At least one!" said Waldo, half to himself.</p>

<p>He was dazed by this information. He had expected to be
welcomed with open arms into the best society that the girl's
community afforded. He had thought of it in just this way, for he
had not even yet learned that there might be a whole people
living under entirely different conditions than those which
existed in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Her reference to his ignorance also came as a distinct shock
to him. He had always considered himself a man of considerable
learning. It had been his secret boast and his mother's open
pride. And now to be pitied for his ignorance by one who probably
thought the earth flat, if she ever thought about such matters at
all&mdash;by one who could neither read nor write. And the worst
of it all was that her indictment was correct&mdash;only she had
not gone far enough.</p>

<p>There was little of practical value that he did know. With the
realization of his limitations Waldo Emerson took, unknown to
himself, a great stride toward a broader wisdom than his narrow
soul had ever conceived.</p>

<p>That night, after the sun had set and the stars and moon had
come out, the two set forth from their retreat toward the
northwest, where the girl said that the village of her people
lay. They walked hand in hand through the dark wood, the girl
directing their steps, the young man grasping his long cudgel in
his right hand and searching into the shadows for the terrible
creatures conjured by his cowardly brain, but mostly for the two
awesome spots of fire which he had gathered from the girl's talk
would mark the presence of Nagoola.</p>

<p>Strange noises assailed his ears, and once the girl crouched
close to him as her quick ears caught the sound of the movement
of a great body through the underbrush at their left.</p>

<p>Waldo Emerson was almost paralyzed by terror; but at length
the creature, whatever it may have been, turned off into the
forest without molesting them. For several hours thereafter they
suffered no alarm, but the constant tension of apprehension on
the man's already over-wrought nerves had reduced him to a state
of such abject nervous terror that he was no longer master of
himself.</p>

<p>So it was that when the girl suddenly halted him with an
affrighted little gasp and, pointing straight ahead, whispered,
"Nagoola," he went momentarily mad with fear.</p>

<p>For a bare instant he paused in his tracks, and then breaking
away from her, he raised his club above his head, and with an
awful shriek dashed straight toward the panther.</p>

<p>In the minds of some there may be a doubt as to which of the
two&mdash;the sleek, silent, black cat or the grinning, screaming
Waldo&mdash;was the most awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it was quite evident that no doubt assailed
the mind of the cat, for with a single answering scream, he
turned and faded into the blackness of the black night.</p>

<p>But Waldo did not see him go. Still shrieking, he raced on
through the forest until he tripped over a creeper and fell
exhausted to the earth. There he lay panting, twitching, and
trembling until the girl found him, an hour after sunrise.</p>

<p>At the sound of her voice he would have struggled to his feet
and dashed on into the woods, for he felt that he could never
face her again after the spectacle of cowardice with which he had
treated her a few hours before.</p>

<p>But even as he gained his feet her first words reassured him,
and dissipated every vestige of his intention to elude her.</p>

<p>"Did you catch him?" she cried.</p>

<p>"No," panted Waldo Emerson quite truthfully. "He got
away."</p>

<p>They rested a little while, and then Waldo insisted that they
resume their journey by day instead of by night. He had
positively determined that he never should or could endure
another such a night of mental torture. He would much rather take
the chance of meeting with the bad men than suffer the constant
feeling that unseen enemies were peering out of the darkness at
him every moment.</p>

<p>In the day they would at least have the advantage of seeing
their foes before they were struck. He did not give these reasons
to the girl, however. Under the circumstances he felt that
another explanation would be better adapted to her ears.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "if it hadn't been so dark Nagoola might
not have escaped me. It is too bad&mdash;too bad."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the girl, "it is too bad. We shall travel by
day. It will be safe now. We have left the country of the bad
men, and there are few men living between us and my people."</p>

<p>That night they spent in a cave they found in the steep bank
of a small river.</p>

<p>It was damp and muddy and cold, but they were both very tired,
and so they fell asleep and slept as soundly as though the best
of mattresses lay beneath them. The girl probably slept better,
since she had never been accustomed to anything much superior to
this in all her life.</p>

<p>The journey required five days, instead of three, and during
all the time Waldo was learning more and more woodcraft from the
girl. At first his attitude had been such that he could profit
but little from her greater practical knowledge, for he had been
inclined to look down upon her as an untutored savage.</p>

<p>Now, however, he was a willing student, and when Waldo Emerson
elected to study there was nothing that he could not master and
retain in a remarkable manner. He had a well-trained
mind&mdash;the principal trouble with it being that it had been
crammed full of useless knowledge. His mother had always made the
error of confusing knowledge with wisdom.</p>

<p>Waldo was not the only one to learn new things upon this
journey. The girl learned something, too&mdash;something which
had been threatening for days to rise above the threshold of her
conscious mind, and now she realized that it had lain in her
heart almost ever since the first moment that she had been with
this strange young man.</p>

<p>Waldo Emerson had been endowed by nature with a chivalrous
heart, and his training had been such that he mechanically
accorded to all women the gallant little courtesies and
consideration which are of the fine things that go with breeding.
Nor was he one whit less punctilious in his relations with this
wild cave girl than he would have been with the daughter of the
finest family of his own aristocracy.</p>

<p>He had been kind and thoughtful and sympathetic always, and to
the girl, who had never been accustomed to such treatment from
men, nor had ever seen a man accord it to any woman, it seemed
little short of miraculous that such gentle tenderness could
belong to a nature so warlike and ferocious as that with which
she had endowed Waldo Emerson. But she was quite satisfied that
it should be so.</p>

<p>She would not have cared for him had he been gentle with her,
yet cowardly. Had she dreamed of the real truth&mdash;had she had
the slightest suspicion that Waldo Emerson was at heart the most
arrant poltroon upon whom the sun had ever shone, she would have
loathed and hated him, for in the primitive code of ethics which
governed the savage community which was her world there was no
place for the craven or the weakling&mdash;and Waldo Emerson was
both.</p>

<p>As the realization of her growing sentiment toward the man
awakened, it imparted to her ways with him a sudden coyness and
maidenly aloofness which had been entirely wanting before. Until
then their companionship, in so far as the girl was concerned,
had been rather that of one youth toward another; but now that
she found herself thrilling at his slightest careless touch, she
became aware of a paradoxical impulse to avoid him.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life, too, she realized her
nakedness, and was ashamed. Possibly this was due to the fact
that Waldo appeared so solicitous in endeavoring to coerce his
rags into the impossible feat of entirely covering his body.</p>

<p>As they neared their journey's end Waldo became more and more
perturbed. During the last night horrible visions of Flatfoot and
Korth haunted his dreams. He saw the great, hairy beasts rushing
upon him in all the ferocity of their primeval
savagery&mdash;tearing him limb from limb in their bestial
rage.</p>

<p>With a shriek he awoke. To the girl's startled inquiry he
replied that he had been but dreaming.</p>

<p>"Did you dream of Flatfoot and Korth?" she laughed. "Of the
things that you will do to them tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Waldo; "I dreamed of Flatfoot and Korth."</p>

<p>But the girl did not see how he trembled and hid his head in
the hollow of his arm.</p>

<p>The last day's march was the most agonizing experience of
Waldo Emerson's life. He was positive that he was going to his
death, but to him the horror of the thing lay more in the manner
of his coming death than in the thought of death itself. As a
matter of fact, he had again reached a point when he would have
welcomed death.</p>

<p>The future held for him nothing but a life of discomfort and
misery and constant mental anguish, superinduced by the condition
of awful fear under which he must drag out his existence in this
strange and terrible land.</p>

<p>Waldo had not the slightest conception as to whether he was
upon some mainland or an unknown island. That the tidal wave had
come upon them somewhere in the South Pacific was all that he
knew; but long since he had given up hope that succor would reach
him in time to prevent him perishing miserably far from his home
and his poor mother.</p>

<p>He could not dwell long upon this dismal theme, because it
always brought tears of self-pity to his eyes, and for some
unaccountable reason Waldo shrunk from the thought of exhibiting
this unmanly weakness before the girl. All day long he racked his
brain for some valid excuse whereby he might persuade his
companion to lead him elsewhere than to her village. A thousand
times better would be some secluded little garden such as that
which had harbored them for the ten days following their escape
from the cave men.</p>

<p>If they could but come upon such a place near the coast, where
Waldo could keep a constant watch for a passing vessel, he would
have been as happy as he ever expected it would be possible for
him in such a savage land.</p>

<p>He wanted the girl with him for companionship; he was more
afraid when he was alone. Of course, he realized that she was no
fit companion for a man of his mental attainments; but then she
was a human being, and her society much better than none at all.
While hope had still lingered that he might live to escape and
return to his beloved Boston, he had often wondered whether he
would dare tell his mother of his unconventional acquaintance
with this young woman.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be out of the question for him to go at
all into details. He would not, for example, dare to attempt a
description of her toilet to his prim parent.</p>

<p>The fact that they had been alone together, day and night, for
weeks was another item which troubled Waldo considerably. He knew
that the shock of such information might prostrate his mother,
and for a long time he debated the wisdom of omitting any mention
of the girl whatever.</p>

<p>At length he decided that a little, white lie would be
permissible, inasmuch as his mother's health and the girl's
reputation were both at stake. So he had decided to mention that
the girl's aunt had been with them in the capacity of chaperon;
that fixed it nicely, and on this point Waldo's mind was more at
ease.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon they wound down a narrow trail that led
from the plateau into a narrow, beautiful valley. A tree-bordered
river meandered through the center of the level plain that formed
the valley's floor, while beyond rose precipitous cliffs, which
trailed off in either direction as far as the eye could
reach.</p>

<p>"There live my people," said the girl, pointing toward the
distant barrier.</p>

<p>Waldo groaned inwardly.</p>

<p>"Let us rest here," he said, "until tomorrow, that we may come
to your home rested and refreshed."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," cried the girl; "we can reach the caves before dark.
I can scarcely wait until I shall have seen how you shall slay
Flatfoot, and maybe Korth also. Though I think that after one of
them has felt your might the others will be glad to take you into
the tribe at the price of your friendship."</p>

<p>"Is there not some way," ventured the distracted Waldo, "that
I may come into your village without fighting? I should dislike
to kill one of your friends," said Waldo solemnly.</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>"Neither Flatfoot nor Korth are friends of mine," she replied;
"I hate them both. They are terrible men. It would be better for
all the tribe were they killed. They are so strong and cruel that
we all hate them, since they use their strength to abuse those
who are weaker.</p>

<p>"They make us all work very hard for them. They take other
men's mates, and if the other men object they kill them. There is
scarcely a moon passes that does not see either Korth or Flatfoot
kill some one.</p>

<p>"Nor is it always men they kill. Often when they are angry
they kill women and little children just for the pleasure of
killing; but when you come among us there will be no more of
that, for you will kill them both if they be not good."</p>

<p>Waldo was too horrified by this description of his soon-to-be
antagonists to make any reply&mdash;his tongue clove to the roof
of his mouth&mdash;all his vocal organs seemed paralyzed.</p>

<p>But the girl did not notice. She went on joyously, ripping
Waldo's nervous system out of him and tearing it into shreds.</p>

<p>"You see," she continued, "Flatfoot and Korth are greater than
the other men of my tribe. They can do as they will. They are
frightful to look upon, and I have often thought that the hearts
of others dried up when they saw either of them coming for
them.</p>

<p>"And they are so strong! I have seen Korth crush the skull of
a full-grown man with a single blow from his open palm; while one
of Flatfoot's amusements is the breaking of men's arms and legs
with his bare hands."</p>

<p>They had entered the valley now, and in silence they continued
on toward the fringe of trees which grew beside the little
river.</p>

<p>Nadara led the way toward a ford, which they quickly crossed.
All the way across the valley Waldo had been searching for some
avenue of escape. He dared not enter that awful village and face
those terrible men, and he was almost equally averse to admitting
to the girl that he was afraid. He would gladly have died to have
escaped either alternative, but he preferred to choose the manner
of his death.</p>

<p>The thought of entering the village and meeting a horrible end
at the hands of the brutes who awaited him there and of being
compelled to demonstrate before the girl's eyes that he was
neither a mighty fighter nor a hero was more than he could
endure.</p>

<p>Occupied with these harrowing speculations, Waldo and Nadara
came to the farther side of the forest, whence they could see the
towering cliffs rising steeply from the valley's bed, three
hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Along their face and at their feet Waldo descried a host of
half-naked men, women, and children moving about in the
consummation of their various duties. Involuntarily he
halted.</p>

<p>The girl came to his side. Together they looked out upon the
scene, the like of which Waldo Emerson never before had seen. It
was as though he had been suddenly snatched back through
countless ages to a long-dead past and dropped into the midst of
the prehistoric life of his Paleolithic progenitors.</p>

<p>Upon the narrow ledges before their caves, women, with long,
flowing hair, ground food in rude stone mortars. Naked children
played about them, perilously close to the precipitous cliff
edge.</p>

<p>Hairy men squatted, gorilla-like, before pieces of flat stone,
upon which green hides were stretched, while they scraped,
scraped, scraped with the sharp edge of smaller bits of stone.
There was no laughter and no song.</p>

<p>Occasionally Waldo saw one of the fierce creatures address
another, and sometimes one would raise his thick lips in a nasty
snarl that exposed his fighting fangs; but they were too far away
for their words to reach the young man.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="cha5" id="cha5">V. &mdash; AWAKENING</a></h2>

<p class="first">"Come," said the girl, "let us make haste. I
cannot wait to be home again! How good it looks!"</p>

<p>Waldo gazed at her in horror. It did not seem credible that
this beautiful young creature could be of such clay as that he
looked upon. It was revolting to believe that she had sprung from
the loins of one of those half-brutes, or that a woman as fierce,
repulsive, such as those he saw before him, could have borne her.
It made him sick with disgust.</p>

<p>He turned from her. "Go to your people, Nadara," he said, for
an idea had come to him.</p>

<p>He had evolved a scheme for escaping a meeting with Flatfoot
and Korth, and the sudden disgust which he felt for the girl made
it easier for him to carry out his design.</p>

<p>"Are you not coming with me?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Not at once," replied Waldo, quite truthfully. "I wish you to
go first. Were we to go together they might harm you when they
rushed out to attack me."</p>

<p>The girl had no fear of this, but she felt that it was very
thoughtful of the man to consider her welfare so tenderly. To
humor him, she acceded to his request.</p>

<p>"As you wish, Thandar," she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>Thandar was a name of her own choosing, after Waldo had
informed her in answer to a request for his name, that she might
call him Mr. Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones. "I shall call you
Thandar," she had replied; "it is shorter, more easily
remembered, and describes you. It means the Brave One." And so
Thandar he had become.</p>

<p>The girl had scarcely emerged from the forest on her way
toward the cliffs when Thandar, the Brave One, turned and ran at
top speed in the opposite direction. When he came to the river he
gave immediate evidence of the strides he had taken in woodcraft
during the brief weeks that he had been under the girl's
tutelage, for he plunged immediately into the water, setting out
up-stream upon the gravelly bottom where he would leave no spoor
to be tracked down by the eagle eyes of these primitive men.</p>

<p>He supposed that the girl would search for him; but he felt no
compunction at having deserted her so scurvily. Of course, he had
no suspicion of her real sentiments toward him&mdash;it would
have shocked him to have imagined that a low-born person, such as
she, had become infatuated with him.</p>

<p>It would have been embarrassing and unfortunate, but, of
course, quite impossible&mdash;since Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones
could never form an alliance beneath him. As for the girl
herself, he might as readily have considered the possibility of
marrying a cow, so far from any such thoughts of her had he
been.</p>

<p>On and on he stumbled through the cold water. Sometimes it was
above his head, but Waldo had learned to swim&mdash;the girl had
made him, partly by pleas, but largely by the fear that she would
ridicule him.</p>

<p>As night came on he commenced to become afraid, but his fear
now was not such a horribly prostrating thing as it had been a
few weeks before. Without being aware of the fact, Waldo had
grown a trifle less timid, though he was still far from lion-
like.</p>

<p>That night he slept in the crotch of a tree. He selected a
small one, which, though less comfortable, was safer from the
approach of Nagoola than a larger tree would have been. This also
had he learned from Nadara.</p>

<p>Had he paused to consider, he would have discovered that all
he knew that was worthwhile he had had from the savage little
girl whom he, from the high pinnacle of his erudition, regarded
with such pity. But Waldo had not as yet learned enough to
realize how very little he knew.</p>

<p>In the morning he continued his flight, gathering his
breakfast from tree and shrub as he fled. Here again was he
wholly indebted to Nadara, for without her training he would have
been restricted to a couple of fruits, whereas now he had a great
variety of fruits, roots, berries, and nuts to choose from in
safety. The stream that he had been following had now become a
narrow, rushing, mountain torrent. It leaped suddenly over little
precipices in wild and picturesque waterfalls; it rioted in
foaming cascades; and ever it led Waldo farther into high and
rugged country.</p>

<p>The climbing was difficult and oftentimes dangerous. Waldo was
surprised at the steeps he negotiated&mdash;perilous ascents from
which he would have shrunk in palsied fear a few weeks earlier.
Waldo was coming on.</p>

<p>Another fact which struck him with amazement at the same time
that it filled him with rejoicing, was that he no longer coughed.
It was quite beyond belief, too, since never in his life had he
been so exposed to cold and wet and discomfort. At home, he
realized, he would long since have curled up and died had he been
subjected to one-tenth the exposure that he had undergone since
the great wave had lifted him bodily from the deck of the steamer
to land him unceremoniously in the midst of this new life of
hardships and terrors.</p>

<p>Toward noon Waldo began to travel with less haste. He had seen
or heard no evidence of pursuit. At times he stopped to look back
along the trail he had passed, but though he could see the little
valley below him for a considerable distance he discovered
nothing to arouse alarm.</p>

<p>Presently he realized that he was very lonely. A dozen times
in as many minutes he thought of observations he would have been
glad to make had there been some one with him to hear. There were
queries, too, relative to this new country that he should have
liked very much to propound, and it flashed upon him that in all
the world there was only one whom he knew who could give him
correct answers to these queries.</p>

<p>He wondered what the girl had thought when he did not follow
her into the village, and set upon Flatfoot and Korth. At the
thought he found himself flushing in a most unaccountable
manner.</p>

<p>What would the girl think! Would she guess the truth?</p>

<p>Well, what difference if she did? What was her opinion to a
cultured gentleman such as Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones? But yet he
found his mind constantly reverting to this unhappy speculation;
it was most annoying.</p>

<p>As he thought of her he discovered with what distinctness he
recalled every feature of her piquant little face, her olive skin
tinged beautifully by the ruddy glow of health; her fine,
straight nose and delicate nostrils, her perfect eyes, soft, yet
filled with the fire of courage and intelligence. Waldo wondered
why it was that he recalled these things now, and dwelt upon
them; he had been with her for weeks without realizing that he
had particularly noticed them.</p>

<p>But most vividly he conjured again the memory of her soft,
liquid speech, her ready retorts, her bright, interesting
observations on the little happenings of their daily life; her
thoughtful kindliness to him, a stranger within her gates,
and&mdash;again he flushed hotly&mdash;her sincere, though
remarkable, belief in his prowess.</p>

<p>It took Waldo a long time to admit to himself that he missed
the girl; it must have been weeks before he finally did so
unreservedly. Simultaneously he determined to return to her
village and find her. He had even gone so far as to start the
return journey when the memory of her description of Flatfoot and
Korth brought him to a sudden halt&mdash;a most humiliating
halt.</p>

<p>The blood surged to his face&mdash;he could feel it burning
there. And then Waldo did two things which he had never done
before: he looked at his soul and saw himself as he was,
and&mdash;he swore.</p>

<p>"Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones," he said aloud, "you're a darned
coward! Worse than that, you're an unthinkable cad. That girl was
kind to you. She treated you with the tender solicitude of a
mother. And how have you returned her kindness? By looking down
upon her with arrogant condescension. By pitying her.</p>

<p>"Pitying her! You&mdash;you miserable weakling&mdash;ingrate,
pitying that fine, intelligent, generous girl. You, with your
pitiful little store of secondhand knowledge, pitying that girl's
ignorance. Why, she's forgotten more real things than you ever
heard of, you&mdash;you&mdash;" Words utterly failed him.</p>

<p>Waldo's awakening was thorough&mdash;painfully thorough. It
left no tiny hidden recess of his contemptible little soul
unrevealed from his searching self-analysis. Looking back over
the twenty-one years of his uneventful life, he failed to
resurrect but a single act of which he might now be proud, and
that, strange to say, in the light of his past training, had to
do neither with culture, intellect, birth, breeding, nor
knowledge.</p>

<p>It was a purely gross, physical act. It was hideously,
violently, repulsively animal&mdash;it was no other than the
instant of heroism in which he had turned back upon the cliff's
face to battle with the horrible, hairy man who had threatened to
prevent Nadara's escape.</p>

<p>Even now Waldo could not realize that it had been he who
ventured so foolhardy an act; but none the less his breast
swelled with pride as he recalled it. It put into the heart of
the man a new hope and into his head a new purpose&mdash;a
purpose that would have caused his Back Bay mother to seek an
early grave could she have known of it.</p>

<p>Nor did Waldo Emerson lose any time in initiating the new
regime which was eventually to fit him for the consummation of
his splendid purpose. He thought of it as splendid now, though a
few weeks before the vulgar atrocity of it would have nauseated
him.</p>

<p>Far up in the hills, near the source of the little river,
Waldo had found a rocky cave. This he had chosen as his new home.
He cleaned it out with scrupulous care, littering the floor with
leaves and grasses.</p>

<p>Before the entrance he piled a dozen large boulders, so
arranged that three of them could be removed or replaced either
from within or without, thus forming a means of egress and
ingress which could be effectually closed against intruders.</p>

<p>From the top of a high promontory, a half mile beyond his
cave, Waldo could obtain a view of the ocean, some eight or ten
miles distant. It was always in his mind that some day a ship
would come, and Waldo longed to return to the haunts of
civilization, but he did not expect the ship before his plans had
properly matured and been put into execution. He argued that he
could not sail away from this shore forever without first seeing
Nadara, and restoring the confidence in him which he felt his
recent desertion had unquestionably shaken to its
foundations.</p>

<p>As a part of his new regime, Waldo required exercise, and to
this end he set about making a trip to the ocean at least once
each week. The way was rough and hazardous, and the first few
times Waldo found it almost beyond his strength to make even one
leg of the journey between sunrise and dark.</p>

<p>This necessitated sleeping out over night; but this, too,
accorded with the details of the task he had set himself, and so
he did it quite cheerfully and with a sense of martyrdom that he
found effectually stilled his most poignant fits of
cowardice.</p>

<p>As time went on he was able to cover the whole distance to the
ocean and return in a single day. He never coughed now, nor did
he glance fearfully from side to side as he strode through the
woods and open places of his wild domain.</p>

<p>His eyes were bright and clear, his head and shoulders were
thrown well back, and the mountain climbing had expanded his
chest to a degree that appalled him&mdash;the while it gave him
much secret satisfaction. It was a very different Waldo from the
miserable creature which had been vomited up by the ocean upon
the sand of that distant beach.</p>

<p>The days that Waldo did not make a trip to the ocean he spent
in rambling about the hills in the vicinity of his cave. He knew
every rock and tree within five miles of his lair. He knew where
Nagoola hid by day, and the path that he took down to the valley
by night. Nor did he longer tremble at sight of the great, black
cat.</p>

<p>True, Waldo avoided him, but it was through cool and
deliberate caution, which is quite another thing from the
senseless panic of fear. Waldo was biding his time. He would not
always avoid Nagoola. Nagoola was a part of Waldo's great plan,
but Waldo was not ready for him yet.</p>

<p>The young man still bore his cudgel, and in addition he had
practiced throwing rocks until he could almost have hit a near-by
bird upon the wing. Besides these weapons Waldo was working upon
a spear. It had occurred to him that a spear would be a mighty
handy weapon against either man or beast, and so he had set to
work to fashion one.</p>

<p>He found a very straight young sapling, a little over an inch
in diameter and ten feet long. By means of a piece of edged flint
he succeeded in tapering it to a sharp point. A rawhide thong,
plaited from many pieces of small bits of hide taken from the
little animals that had fallen before his missiles, served to
sling the crude weapon across his shoulders when he walked.</p>

<p>With his spear he practiced hour upon hour each day, until he
could transfix a fruit the size of an apple three times out of
five, at a distance of fifty feet, and at a hundred hit a target
the size of a man almost without a miss.</p>

<p>Six months had passed since he had fled from an encounter with
Flatfoot and Korth.</p>

<p>Then Waldo had been a skinny, cowardly weakling; now his great
frame had filled out with healthy flesh, while beneath his skin
hard muscles rolled as he bent to one of the many Herculean tasks
he had set for himself.</p>

<p>For six months he had worked with a single purpose in view,
but still he felt that the day was not yet come when he might
safely venture to put his newfound manhood to the test. Down, far
down, in the depth of his soul he feared that he was yet a coward
at heart&mdash;and he dared not take the risk. It was too much to
expect, he told himself, that a man should be entirely
metamorphosed in a brief half year. He would wait a little
longer.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Waldo first saw a human being
after his last sight of Nadara.</p>

<p>It was while he was on his way to the ocean, on one of the
trips that had by this time become thrice weekly affairs, that he
suddenly came face to face with a skulking, hairy brute. Waldo
halted to see what would happen.</p>

<p>The man eyed him with those small, cunning, red-rimmed eyes
that reminded Waldo of the eyes of a pig.</p>

<p>Finally Waldo spoke in the language of Nadara.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sag the Killer," replied the man. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Thandar," answered Waldo.</p>

<p>"I do not know you," said Sag; "but I can kill you."</p>

<p>He lowered his bull head and came for Waldo like a battering
ram.</p>

<p>The young man dropped the point of his ready spear, bracing
his feet. The point entered Sag's breast below the collar-bone,
stopping only after it had passed entirely through the savage
heart. Waldo had not moved; the momentum of the man's body had
been sufficient to impale him.</p>

<p>As the body rolled over, stiffening after a few convulsive
kicks, Waldo withdrew his spear from it. Blood smeared its point
for a distance of a foot, but Waldo showed no sign of loathing or
disgust.</p>

<p>Instead he smiled. It had been so much easier than he had
anticipated.</p>

<p>Leaving Sag where he had fallen he continued toward the ocean.
An hour later he heard unusual noises behind him.</p>

<p>He stopped to listen. He was being pursued. From the sounds he
estimated that there must be several in the party, and a moment
later, as he was crossing a clearing, he got his first view of
them as they emerged from the forest he had just quitted.</p>

<p>There were at least twenty powerfully muscled brutes. In skin
bags thrown across their shoulders each carried a supply of
stones, and these they began to hurl at Waldo as they raced
toward him. For a moment the man held his ground, but he quickly
realized the futility of pitting himself against such odds.</p>

<p>Turning, he ran toward the forest upon the other side of the
clearing while a shower of rocks whizzed about him. Once within
the shelter of the trees there was less likelihood of his being
hit by one of the missiles, but occasionally a well-aimed rock
would strike him a glancing blow. Waldo hoped that they would
tire of the chase before the beach was reached, for he knew that
there could be but one outcome of a battle in which one man faced
twenty.</p>

<p>As the pursued and the pursuers raced on through the forest
one of the latter, fleeter than his companions, commenced to
close up the gap which had existed between Waldo and the twenty.
On and on he came, until a backward glance showed Waldo that in
another moment this swift foeman would be upon him. He was
younger than his fellows and more active, and, having thrown all
his stones, was free from any burden of weight other than the
single garment about his hips.</p>

<p>Waldo still clung to his tattered ducks, which from lack of
support and more or less rapid disintegration were continually
slipping down from his hips, so that they tended to hinder his
movements and reduce his speed.</p>

<p>Had he been as naked as his pursuer he would doubtless have
distanced him; but he was not, and it was evident that because of
this fact he must take a chance in a hand-to-hand encounter that
might delay him sufficiently to permit the balance of the horde
to reach him&mdash;that would be the end of everything.</p>

<p>But Waldo Emerson neither screamed in terror nor trembled.
When he wheeled to meet the now close savage there was a smile
upon his lips, for Waldo Emerson had "killed his man," and there
was no longer the haunting fear within his soul that at heart he
was a coward.</p>

<p>As he turned with couched spear the cave man came to a sudden
stop.</p>

<p>This was not what Waldo had anticipated. The other savages
were running rapidly toward him, but the fellow who had first
overhauled him remained at a safe twenty feet from the point of
his weapon.</p>

<p>Waldo was being cleverly held until the remainder of the enemy
could arrive and overwhelm him. He knew that if he turned to run
the fellow who danced and yelled just beyond his reach would
plunge forward and be upon his back in an instant.</p>

<p>He tried rushing the man, but the other retreated nimbly,
drawing Waldo still closer to those who were coming on. There was
no time to be lost. A moment more and the entire twenty would be
upon him; but there were possibilities in a spear that the cave
man in his ignorance dreamed not of. There was a lightning-like
movement of Waldo's arm, and the aborigine saw the spear darting
swiftly through space toward his breast. He tried to dodge, but
was too late. Down he went, clutching madly at the slender thing
which protruded from his heart.</p>

<p>Although one of the dead man's companions was now quite close,
Waldo could not relinquish his weapon without an effort&mdash;it
had cost him considerable time to make, and twice today it had
saved his life. Forgetful that he had ever been a coward he
leaped toward the fallen man, reaching his side at the same
instant as his foremost pursuer.</p>

<p>The two came together like mad bulls&mdash;the savage reaching
for Waldo's throat, Waldo wielding his light cudgel. For a moment
they struggled backward and forward, turning and twisting, the
cave man in an effort to close upon Waldo's wind, Waldo to hold
the other at arm's length for the brief instant that would be
necessary for one sudden, effective blow from the cudgel.</p>

<p>The other savages were almost upon them when the young man
found his antagonist's throat. Throwing all his weight and
strength into the effort, Waldo forced the cave man back until
there was room between them for the play of the stick. A single
blow was sufficient.</p>

<p>As the limp body of his foeman slipped from his grasp, Waldo
snatched his precious spear from the heart of its victim, and
with the hands of the infuriated pack almost upon him, turned
once more into his flight toward the ocean.</p>

<p>The howling band was close upon his heels now, nor could he
greatly increase the distance that separated him from them. He
wondered what the outcome of the matter was to be; he did not
wish to die. His thoughts kept reverting to his boyhood home, to
his indulgent mother, to the friends that had been his. He felt
that at the last moment he was about to lose his
nerve&mdash;that, after all, his hard earned manliness was
counterfeit.</p>

<p>Then there came to him a vision of an oval, olive face framed
by a mass of soft, black hair; and before it the fear of death
dissolved into a grim smile. He did not pause to analyze the
reason for it&mdash;nor could he have done so then had he tried.
He only knew that with those eyes upon him he could not be aught
else than courageous.</p>

<p>A moment later he burst through the last fringe of underbrush
to emerge upon the clearing that faced the sea. There by a tiny
rivulet he saw a sight that filled him with thanksgiving, and
farther out upon the ocean that which he had been waiting and
hoping for for all these long, hard months&mdash;a ship.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="cha6" id="cha6">VI. &mdash; A CHOICE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Seamen upon the beach were filling water-casks.
There were a dozen of them, and as Waldo plunged from the forest
they looked with startled apprehension at the strange apparition.
A great, brown giant they saw, clad in a few ragged strings of
white duck, for Waldo had kept his apparel as immaculately clean
as hard rubbing in cold water would permit.</p>

<p>In one hand the strange creature carried a long, bloody spear,
in the other a light cudgel. Long, yellow hair streamed back over
his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>Several of the men&mdash;those who were armed&mdash;leveled
guns and revolvers at him; but when, as he drew closer, they saw
a broad grin upon his face, and heard in perfectly good English,
"Don't shoot; I'm a white man," they lowered their weapons and
awaited him.</p>

<p>He had scarcely reached them when they saw a swarm of naked
men dash from the forest in his wake. Waldo saw their eyes
directed past him and knew that his pursuers had come into
view.</p>

<p>"You'll have to shoot at them, I imagine," he said. "They're
not exactly domesticated. Try firing over their heads at first;
maybe you can scare them away without hurting any of them."</p>

<p>He disliked the idea of seeing the poor savages slaughtered.
It didn't seem just like fair play to mow them down with
bullets.</p>

<p>The sailors followed his suggestion. At the first reports the
cave men halted in surprise and consternation.</p>

<p>"Let's rush 'em," suggested one of the men, and this was all
that was needed to send them scurrying back into the woods.</p>

<p>Waldo found that the ship was English, and that all the men
spoke his mother tongue in more or less understandable fashion.
The second mate, who was in charge of the landing party, proved
to have originated in Boston. It was much like being at home
again.</p>

<p>Waldo was so excited and wanted to ask so many questions all
at once that he became almost unintelligible. It seemed scarcely
possible that a ship had really come.</p>

<p>He realized now that he had never actually entertained any
very definite belief that a ship ever would come to this out-of-
the-way corner of the world. He had hoped and dreamed, but down
in the bottom of his heart he must have felt that years might
elapse before he would be rescued.</p>

<p>Even now it was difficult to believe that these were really
civilized beings like himself. They were on their way to a
civilized world; they would soon be surrounded by their families
and friends, and he, Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, was going with
them! In a few months he would see his mother and his father and
all his friends&mdash;he would be among his books once more.</p>

<p>Even as the last thought flashed through his mind it was
succeeded by mild wonderment that this outlook failed to raise
his temperature as he might have expected that it would. His
books had been his real life in the past&mdash;could it be that
they had lost something of their glamour? Had his brief
experience with the realities of life dulled the edge of his
appetite for second-hand hopes, aspirations, deeds, and
emotions?</p>

<p>It had.</p>

<p>Waldo yet craved his books, but they alone would no longer
suffice. He wanted something bigger, something more real and
tangible&mdash;he wanted to read and study, but even more he
wanted to do. And back there in his own world there would be
plenty awaiting the doing.</p>

<p>His heart thrilled at the possibilities that lay before the
new Waldo Emerson&mdash;possibilities of which he never would
have dreamed but for the strange chance which had snatched him
bodily from one life to throw him into this new one, which had
forced upon him the development of attributes of self-reliance,
courage, initiative, and resourcefulness that would have lain
dormant within him always but for the necessity which had given
birth to them.</p>

<p>Yes, Waldo realized that he owed a great deal to this
experience&mdash;a great deal to&mdash;And then a sudden
realization of the truth rushed in upon him&mdash;he owed
everything to Nadara.</p>

<p>"I was never shipwrecked on a desert island," said the second
mate, breaking in upon Waldo's reveries, "but I can imagine just
about how good you feel at the thought that you are at last
rescued and that in an hour or so you will see the shoreline of
your prison growing smaller and smaller upon the southern
horizon."</p>

<p>"Yes," acquiesced Waldo in a far-away voice. "It's awfully
good of you, but I am not going with you."</p>

<p><br> Two hours later Waldo Emerson stood alone upon the beach,
watching the diminishing hull of a great ship as it dropped over
the rim of the world far to the north. A vague hint of tears
dimmed his vision; then he threw back his shoulders, swallowed
the thing that had risen into his throat, and with high-held head
turned back into the forest.</p>

<p>In one hand he carried a razor and a plug of tobacco&mdash;the
sole mementos of his recent brief contact with the world of
civilization. The kindly sailors had urged him to reconsider his
decision, but when he remained obdurate they had insisted that
they be permitted to leave some of the comforts of life with
him.</p>

<p>The only thing that he could think of that he wanted very
badly was a razor&mdash;firearms he would not accept, for he had
worked out a rather fine chivalry of his own here in this savage
world&mdash;a chivalry which would not permit him to take any
advantage over the primeval inhabitants he had found here other
than what his own hands and head might give him.</p>

<p>At the last moment one of the seamen, prompted by a generous
heart and a keen realization of what life must be without even
bare necessities, had thrust upon Waldo the plug of tobacco.</p>

<p>As he looked at it now the young man smiled.</p>

<p>"That would indeed be the last step, according to mother's
ideas," he soliloquized. "No lower could I sink."</p>

<p>The ship that bore away Waldo's chance of escape carried also
a long letter to Waldo's mother. In portions it was rather vague
and rambling. It mentioned, among other things, that he had an
obligation to fulfil before he could leave his present habitat;
but that the moment he was free he should "take the first steamer
for Boston."</p>

<p>The skipper of the ship which had just sailed away had told
Waldo that in so far as he knew there might never be another ship
touch his island, which was so far out of the beaten course that
only the shore-line of it had ever been explored, and scarce a
score of vessels had reported it since Captain Cook discovered it
in 1773.</p>

<p>Yet it was in the face of this that Waldo had refused to
leave. As he walked slowly through the wood on his way back
toward his cave he tried to convince himself that he had acted
purely from motives of gratitude and fairness&mdash;that as a
gentleman he could do no less than see Nadara and thank her for
the friendly services she had rendered him; but for some reason
this seemed a very futile and childish excuse for relinquishing
what might easily be his only opportunity to return to
civilization.</p>

<p>His final decision was that he had acted the part of a fool;
yet as he walked he hummed a joyous tune, and his heart was full
of happiness and pleasant expectations of what he could not have
told.</p>

<p>To one thing he had made up his mind, and that was that the
next sun would see him on his way to the village of Nadara. His
experience with the savages that day had convinced him that he
might with reasonable safety face Flatfoot and Korth. The more he
dwelt upon this idea the more lighthearted he became&mdash;he
could not understand it. He should be plunged into the blackest
despair, for had he not but just relinquished a chance to return
home, and was he not within a day or two to enter the village of
the ferocious Flatfoot and the mighty Korth? Even so, his heart
sang.</p>

<p>Waldo saw nothing of his enemies of the earlier part of the
day as he moved cautiously through the forest or crossed the
little plains and meadows which lay along the route between the
ocean and his lair; but his thoughts often reverted to them and
to his adventures of the morning, and the result was that he
became aware of a deficiency in his equipment&mdash;a deficiency
which his recent battle made glaringly apparent.</p>

<p>In fact, there were two points that might be easily remedied.
One was the lack of a shield. Had he had protection of this
nature he would have been in comparatively little danger from the
shower of missiles that the savages had flung at him. The other
was a sword. With a sword and shield he could have let his
enemies come to very close quarters with perfect impunity to
himself and then have run them through with infinite ease.</p>

<p>This new idea would necessitate a delay in his plans; he must
finish both shield and sword before he departed for the village
of Flatfoot. What with his meditation and his planning, Waldo had
made poor time on the return journey from the coast, so that it
was after sunset when he entered the last deep ravine beyond the
farther summit of which lay his rocky home. In the depths of the
ravine it was already quite dark, though a dim twilight still
hung upon the surrounding hill-tops.</p>

<p>He had about completed the arduous ascent of the last steep
trail, at the crest of which was his journey's end, when above
him, silhouetted against the darkening sky, loomed a great black,
crouching mass, from the center of which blazed two balls of
fire. It was Nagoola, and he occupied the center of the only
trail that led over the edge of the ridge from the ravine
below.</p>

<p>"I had almost forgotten you, Nagoola," murmured Waldo Emerson.
"I could never have gone upon my journey without first
interviewing you, but I could have wished a different time and
place than this. Let us postpone the matter for a day or so," he
concluded aloud; but the only response from Nagoola was an
ominous growl. Waldo felt rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He could not have come upon the great, black panther at a more
inopportune time or place. It was too dark for Waldo's human
eyes, and the cat was above him and Waldo upon a steep hillside
that under the best of conditions offered but a precarious
foothold. He tried to shoo the formidable beast away by shouts
and menacing gesticulations, but Nagoola would not shoo. Instead
he crept slowly forward, edging his sinuous body inch by inch
along the rocky trail until it hung poised above the waiting man
a dozen feet below him.</p>

<p>Six months before Waldo would long since have been shrieking
in meteor-like flight down the bed of the ravine behind him. That
a wonderful transformation had been wrought within him was
evident from the fact that no cry of fright escaped him, and
that, far from fleeing, he edged inch by inch upward toward the
menacing creature hanging there above him. He carried his spear
with the point leveled a trifle below those baleful eyes. He had
advanced but a foot or two, however, when, with an awful shriek,
the terrible beast launched itself full upon him. As the heavy
body struck him Waldo went over backward down the cliff, and with
him went Nagoola. Clawing, tearing, and scratching, the two
rolled and bounded down the rocky hillside until, near the
bottom, they came to a sudden stop against a large tree.</p>

<p>The growling and screeching ceased, the clawing paws and hands
were still. Presently the tropic moon rose over the hill-top to
look down upon a little tangled mound of man and beast that lay
very quiet against the bole of a great tree near the bottom of a
dark ravine.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="cha7" id="cha7">VII. &mdash; THANDAR, THE
SEEKER</a></h2>

<p class="first">For a long time there was no sign of life in
that strange pile of flesh and bone and brawn and glossy black
fur and long, yellow hair and blood. But toward dawn it moved a
little, down near the bottom of the heap, and a little later
there was a groan, and then all was still again for many
minutes.</p>

<p>Presently it moved again, this time more energetically, and
after several efforts a yellow head streaked and matted with
blood emerged from beneath. It required the better part of an
hour for the stunned and lacerated Waldo to extricate himself
from the entangling embrace of Nagoola.</p>

<p>When, finally, he staggered to his feet he saw that the great
cat lay dead before him, the broken shaft of the spear protruding
from the sleek, black breast.</p>

<p>It was quite evident that the beast had lived but the barest
fraction of an instant after it had launched itself upon the man;
but during that brief interval of time it had wrought sore havoc
with its mighty talons, though fortunately for Waldo the great
jaws had not found him.</p>

<p>From breast to knees ghastly wounds were furrowed in the man's
brown skin where the powerful hind feet of the beast had raked
him.</p>

<p>That he owed his life to the chance that had brought about the
encounter upon a steep hillside rather than on the level seemed
quite apparent, for during their tumble down the declivity
Nagoola had been unable to score with any degree of accuracy. As
Waldo looked down upon himself he was at first horrified by the
frightful appearance of his wounds; but when a closer examination
showed them to be superficial he realized that the only danger
lay in infection. Every bone and muscle in his body ached from
the man-handling and the fall, and the wounds themselves were
painful, almost excruciatingly so when a movement of his body
stretched or tore them; but notwithstanding his suffering he
found himself smiling as he contemplated the remnants of his
long-suffering ducks.</p>

<p>There remained of their once stylish glory not a
shred&mdash;the panther's sharp claws had finished what time and
brambles had so well commenced. And of their linen
partner&mdash;the white outing shirt&mdash;only the neckband
remained, with a single fragment as large as one's hand depending
behind.</p>

<p>"Nature is a wonderful leveler," thought Waldo. "It is evident
that she hates artificiality as she does a vacuum. I shall really
need you now," he concluded, looking at the beautiful, black coat
of Nagoola.</p>

<p>Despite his suffering, Waldo crawled to his lair, where he
selected a couple of sharp-edged stones from his collection and
returned to the side of Nagoola.</p>

<p>Leaving his tools there he went on down to the bottom of the
ravine, where in a little crystal stream he bathed his wounds.
Then he returned once more to his kill. After half a day of the
most arduous labor Waldo succeeded in removing the panther's
hide, which he dragged laboriously to his lair, where he fell
exhausted, unable even to crawl within. The next day Waldo worked
upon the inner surface of the hide, removing every particle of
flesh by scraping it with a sharp stone, so that there might be
no danger of decomposition.</p>

<p>He was still very weak and sore, but he could not bear the
thought of losing the pelt that had cost him so much to obtain.
When the last vestige of flesh had been scraped away he crawled
into his lair, where he remained for a week, only emerging for
food and water. At the end of that time his wounds were almost
healed, and he had entirely recovered from his lameness and the
shock of the adventure, so that it was with real pleasure and
exultation that he gloated over his beautiful trophy.</p>

<p>Always as he thought of the time that he should have it made
ready for girting about his loins he saw himself, not through his
own eyes, but as he imagined that another would see him, and that
other was Nadara.</p>

<p>For many days Waldo scraped and pounded the great skin as he
had seen the cave men scrape and pound in the brief instant he
had watched them with Nadara from the edge of the forest before
the village of Flatfoot. At last he was rewarded with a pelt
sufficiently pliable for the purpose of the rude apparel he
contemplated.</p>

<p>A strip an inch wide he trimmed off to form a supporting belt.
With this he tied the black skin about his waist, passed one arm
through a hole he had made for that purpose near the upper edge;
bringing the fore paws forward about his chest, he crossed and
fastened them to secure the garment from falling from the upper
part of his body.</p>

<p>It was a very proud Waldo that strutted forth in the finery of
his new apparel; but the pride was in the prowess that had won
the thing for him&mdash;vulgar, gross, brutal physical
prowess&mdash;the very attribute upon which he had looked with
supercilious contempt six months before.</p>

<p>Next Waldo turned his attention toward the fashioning of a
sword, a new spear, and a shield. The first two were
comparatively easy of accomplishment&mdash;he had them both
completed in half a day, and from a two-inch strip of panther
hide he made also a sword belt to pass over his right shoulder
and support his sword at his left side; but the shield almost
defied his small skill and newborn ingenuity.</p>

<p>With small twigs and grasses he succeeded, after nearly a week
of painstaking endeavor, in weaving a rude, oval buckler some
three feet long by two wide, which he covered with the skins of
several small animals that had fallen before his death-dealing
stones. A strip of hide fastened upon the back of the shield held
it to his left arm. With it Waldo felt more secure against the
swiftly thrown missiles of the savages he knew he should
encounter on his forthcoming expedition.</p>

<p>At last came the morning for departure. Rising with the sun,
Waldo took his morning "tub" in the cold spring that rose a few
yards from his cave, then he got out the razor that the sailor
had given him, and after scraping off his scanty, yellow beard,
hacked his tawny hair until it no longer fell about his shoulders
and in his eyes.</p>

<p>Then he gathered up his weapons, rolled the boulders before
the entrance to his cave, and turning his back upon his rough
home set off down the little stream toward the distant valley
where it wound through the forest along the face of the cliffs to
Flatfoot and Korth.</p>

<p>As he stepped lightly along the hazardous trail, leaping from
ledge to ledge in the descent of the many sheer drops over which
the stream fell, he might have been a reincarnation of some
primeval hunter from whose savage loins had sprung the warriors
and the strong men of a world.</p>

<p>The tall, well-muscled, brown body; the clear, bright eyes;
the high-held head; the sword, the spear, the shield were all a
far cry from the weak and futile thing that had lain groveling in
the sand upon the beach, sweating and shrieking in terror six
short months before. And yet it was the same.</p>

<p>What one good but mistaken woman had smothered another had
brought out, and the result of the influence of both was a much
finer specimen of manhood than either might have evolved
alone.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the third day Waldo came to the forest
opposite the cliffs where lay the home of Nadara. Cautiously he
stole from tree to tree until he could look out unseen upon the
honeycombed face of the lofty escarpment.</p>

<p>All was lifeless and deserted. The cave mouths looked out upon
the valley, sad and lonely. There was no sign of life in any
direction as far as Waldo could see.</p>

<p>Coming from the forest he crossed the clearing and approached
the cliffs. His eye, now become alert in woodcraft, detected the
young grass growing in what had once been well-beaten trails. He
needed no further evidence to assure him that the caves were
deserted, and had been for some time.</p>

<p>One by one he entered and explored several of the cliff
dwellings. All gave the same mute corroboration of what was
everywhere apparent&mdash;the village had been evacuated without
haste in an orderly manner. Everything of value had been
removed&mdash;only a few broken utensils remaining as indication
that it had ever constituted human habitation.</p>

<p>Waldo was utterly confounded. He had not the remotest idea in
which direction to search. During the balance of the afternoon he
wandered along the various ledges, entering first one cave and
then another.</p>

<p>He wondered which had been Nadara's. He tried to imagine her
life among these crude, primitive surroundings; among the
beastlike men and women who were her people. She did not seem to
harmonize with either. He was convinced that she was more out of
place here than Flatfoot would have been in a Back Bay drawing-
room.</p>

<p>The more his mind dwelt upon her the sadder he became. He
tried to convince himself that it was purely disappointment in
being thwarted in his desire to thank her for her kindness to
him, and demonstrate that her confidence in his prowess had not
been misplaced; but always he discovered that his thoughts
returned to Nadara rather than to the ostensible object of his
adventure.</p>

<p>In short he began to realize, rather vaguely it is true, that
he had come because he wanted to see the girl again; but why he
wanted to see her he did not know.</p>

<p>That night he slept in one of the deserted caves, and the next
morning set forth upon his quest for Nadara. For three days he
searched the little valley, but without results. There was no
sign of any other village within it.</p>

<p>Then he passed over into another valley to the north. For
weeks he wandered hither and thither without being rewarded by
even a sight of a human being.</p>

<p>Early one afternoon as he was topping a barrier in search of
other valleys he came suddenly face to face with a great, hairy
man. Both stopped&mdash;the hairy one glaring with his nasty
little eyes.</p>

<p>"I can kill you," growled the savage.</p>

<p>Waldo had no desire to fight&mdash;it was information he was
searching. But he almost smiled at the ready greeting of the man.
It was the same that Sag the Killer had accorded him that day he
had gone down to the sea for the last time.</p>

<p>It came as readily and as glibly from these primitive men as
"good morning" falls from the lips of the civilized races, yet
among the latter he realized that it had its counterpart in the
stony stares which Anglo Saxon strangers vouchsafe one
another.</p>

<p>"I have no quarrel with you," replied Waldo. "Let us be
friends."</p>

<p>"You are afraid," taunted the hairy one.</p>

<p>Waldo pointed to his sable garment.</p>

<p>"Ask Nagoola," he said.</p>

<p>The man looked at the trophy. There could be no mightier
argument for a man's valor than that. He came a step closer that
he might scrutinize it more carefully.</p>

<p>"Full-grown and in perfect health," he grunted to himself.
"This is no worn and mangy hide peeled from the rotting carcass
of one dead of sickness.</p>

<p>"How did you slay Nagoola?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Waldo indicated his spear, then he drew his garment aside and
pointed to the vivid, new-healed scars that striped his body.</p>

<p>"We met at dusk at a cliff-top. He was above, I below. When we
reached the bottom of the ravine Nagoola was dead. But it was
nothing for Thandar. I am Thandar."</p>

<p>Waldo rightly suspected that a little bravado would make a
good impression on the intellect primeval, nor was he
mistaken.</p>

<p>"What do you here in my country?" asked the man, but his tone
was less truculent than before.</p>

<p>"I am searching for Flatfoot and Korth&mdash;and Nadara," said
Waldo.</p>

<p>The other's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"What would you of them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nadara was good to me&mdash;I would repay her."</p>

<p>"But Flatfoot and Korth&mdash;what of them?" insisted the
man.</p>

<p>"My business is with them. When I see them I shall transact
it," Waldo parried, for he had seen the cunning look in the man's
eyes and he did not like it. "Can you lead me to them?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you where they are, but I am not bound thither,"
replied the man. "Three days toward the setting sun will bring
you to the village of Flatfoot. There you will find Korth
also&mdash;and Nadara," and without further parley the savage
turned and trotted toward the east.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="cha8" id="cha8">VIII. &mdash; NADARA AGAIN</a></h2>

<p class="first">Waldo watched him out of sight, half minded to
follow, for he was far from satisfied that the fellow had been
entirely honest with him. Why he should have been otherwise Waldo
could not imagine, but nevertheless there had been an indefinable
suggestion of duplicity in the man's behavior that had puzzled
him.</p>

<p>However, Waldo took up his search toward the west, passing
down from the hills into a deep valley, the bottom of which was
overgrown by a thick tangle of tropical jungle. He had forced his
way through this for nearly half a mile when he came to the bank
of a wide, slow-moving river. Its water was thick with
sediment&mdash;not clean, sparkling, and inviting, as were the
little mountain streams of the hills and valleys farther
south.</p>

<p>Waldo traveled along the edge of the river in a northwesterly
direction, searching for a ford. The steep, muddy banks offered
no foothold, so he dared not venture a crossing until he could be
sure of a safe landing upon the opposite shore. A couple of
hundred yards from the point at which he had come upon the stream
he found a broad trail leading down into the water, and on the
other side saw a similar track cutting up through the bank.</p>

<p>This, evidently, was the ford he sought, but as he started
toward the river he noticed the imprints of the feet of many
animals&mdash;human and brute.</p>

<p>Waldo stooped to examine them minutely. There were the broad
pads of Nagoola, the smaller imprints of countless rodents, but
back and forth among them all were old and new signs of man.
There were the great, flat-foot prints of huge adult males, the
smaller but equally flat-footed impresses of the women and
children; but one there was that caught his eye particularly.</p>

<p>It was the fine and dainty outline of a perfect foot, with the
arch well defined. It was new, as were many of the others, and,
like the other newer ones, it led down to the river and then back
again, as though she who made it had come for water and then
returned from whence she had come. Waldo knew that the tracks
leading away from the river were the newer, because where the two
trails overlapped those coming up from the ford were always over
those which led downward.</p>

<p>The multiplicity of signs indicated a considerable community,
and their newness the proximity of the makers. Waldo hesitated
but a moment before he reached a decision, and then he turned up
the trail away from the river, and at a rapid trot followed the
spoor along its winding course through the jungle to where it
emerged at the base of the foothills, to wind upward toward their
crest.</p>

<p>He found that the trail he was following crossed the hills but
a few yards from the spot at which he had met the cave man a
short time before. Evidently the man had been returning from the
river when he had espied Waldo.</p>

<p>The young man could see where the fellow's tracks had left the
main trail, and he followed them to the point where the man had
stood during his conversation with Waldo; from there they led
toward the east for a short distance, and then turned suddenly
north to reenter the main trail.</p>

<p>Waldo could see that as soon as the man had reached a point
from which he would be safe from the stranger's observation he
had broken into a rapid trot, and as he already had two hours'
start Waldo felt that he would have to hurry were he to overtake
him.</p>

<p>Just why he wished to do so he did not consider, but,
intuitively possibly, he felt that the surly brute could give him
much more and accurate information than he had. Nor could Waldo
eliminate the memory of those dainty feminine footprints. It was
foolish, of course, and he fully realized the fact; but his silly
mind would insist upon attributing them to the cave
girl&mdash;Nadara.</p>

<p>For two hours he trotted doggedly along the trail, which for
the most part was well defined. There were places, of course,
which taxed his trailing ability, but by circling widely from
these points he always was able to pick up the tracks again.</p>

<p>He had come down from the hills and entered an open forest,
where the trail was entirely lost in the mossy carpet that lay
beneath the trees, when he was startled by a scream&mdash;a
woman's scream&mdash;and the hoarse gutturals of two men, deep
and angry.</p>

<p>Hastening toward the sound, Waldo came upon the authors of the
commotion in a little glade half hidden by surrounding
bushes.</p>

<p>There were three actors in the hideous tragedy&mdash;a hairy
brute dragging a protesting girl by her long, black hair and an
old man, who followed, protesting futilely against the outrage
that threatened the young woman.</p>

<p>None of them saw Waldo as he ran toward them until he was
almost upon them, and then the beast who grasped the girl looked
up, and Waldo recognized him as the same who had sent him toward
the west earlier in the day.</p>

<p>At the same instant he saw the girl was Nadara. In the brief
interval that the recognition required there sloughed from the
heart and mind and soul of Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones every
particle of the civilization and culture and refinement that had
required countless ages in the building, stripping him naked, age
on age, down to the primordial beast that had begot his first
human progenitor.</p>

<p>He saw red through blood as he leaped for the throat of the
man-beast whose ruthless hands were upon Nadara. His lip curled
in the fighting snarl that exposed his long-unused canine
fangs.</p>

<p>He forgot sword and shield and spear.</p>

<p>He was no longer a man, but a terrible beast; and the hairy
brute that witnessed the metamorphosis blanched and shrank back
in fear. But he could not escape the fury of that mad charge or
the raging creature that sought his throat.</p>

<p>For a moment they struggled in a surging, swaying embrace, and
then toppled to the ground&mdash;the hairy one beneath. Rolling,
tearing, and biting, they battled&mdash;each seeking a death hold
upon the other.</p>

<p>Time and again the gleaming teeth of the once-fastidious
Bostonian sank into the breast and shoulder of his antagonist,
but it was the jugular his primal instinct sought.</p>

<p>The girl and the old man had drawn away where they could watch
the battle in safety. Nadara's eyes were wide in fascination.</p>

<p>Her slim, brown hands were tight pressed against her rapidly
rising and falling breasts as she leaned a little forward with
parted lips, drinking in every detail of the conflict between the
two beasts.</p>

<p>Ah, but was the yellow-haired giant really fighting for
possession of her, or merely in protection, because she was a
woman?</p>

<p>She could readily conceive from her knowledge of him that he
might be acting now solely from some peculiar sense of duty which
she realized that he might entertain, although she could not
herself understand it.</p>

<p>Yes, that was it, and when he had conquered his rival he would
run away again, as he had months before. At the thought Nadara
felt herself flush with mortification. No, he should never have
another opportunity to repeat that terrible affront.</p>

<p>As she allowed her mind to dwell on the humiliating moment
that had witnessed the discovery that Thandar had fled from her
at the very threshold of her home Nadara found herself hating him
again as fiercely as she had all these long months&mdash;a hatred
that had almost dissolved at sight of him as he rushed our of the
underbrush a moment before to wrest her from the clutches of her
hideous tormentor.</p>

<p>Waldo and his antagonist were still tearing futilely at one
another in mad efforts to maim or kill. The giant muscles of the
cave man gave him but little if any advantage over his agile,
though slightly less-powerful, adversary.</p>

<p>The hairy one used his teeth to better advantage, with the
result that Waldo was badly torn and bleeding from a dozen
wounds.</p>

<p>Both were weakening now, and it seemed to the girl who watched
that the younger man would be the first to succumb to the
terrific strain under which both had been. She took a step
forward and, stooping, picked up a stone.</p>

<p>Her small strength would be ample to turn the scales as she
might choose&mdash;a sharp blow upon the head of either would
give his adversary the trifling advantage that would spell death
for the one she struck.</p>

<p>The two men had struggled to their feet again as she
approached with raised weapon.</p>

<p>At the very moment that it left her hand they swung completely
round, so that Waldo faced her, and in the instant before the
missile struck his forehead he saw Nadara in the very act of
throwing&mdash;upon her face an expression of hatred and
loathing.</p>

<p>Then he lost consciousness and went down, dragging with him
the cave man, upon whose throat his fingers had just found their
hold.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="cha9" id="cha9">IX. &mdash; THE SEEKER</a></h2>

<p class="first">When the old man saw what had happened he ran
forward and grasped Nadara by the wrist.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he cried&mdash;"quick, my daughter! You have killed
him who would have saved you, and now nothing but flight may keep
Korth from having his way with you."</p>

<p>As in a trance the girl turned and departed with him. They had
scarcely disappeared within the underbrush when Waldo returned to
consciousness, so slight had been the effect of the blow upon his
head.</p>

<p>To his surprise he found the cave man lying very still beside
him, but an instant later he read the reason for it in the little
projecting ridge of rock upon which lay his foe's
forehead&mdash;in falling the savage man had struck thus and lost
consciousness.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the hairy one opened his eyes, but before
he could gather his scattered senses sinewy fingers found his
throat, and he lapsed once more into oblivion&mdash;from which
there was no awakening.</p>

<p>As Waldo staggered to his feet he saw that the girl had
vanished, and there swept back into his mind the memory of the
hate that had been in her face as she struck him down. It seemed
incredible that she should have turned against him so, and at the
very moment, too, when he had risked his life in her service; but
that she had there could be no doubt, for he had seen her cast
the stone&mdash;with his own eyes he had seen her, and, too, he
had seen the hatred and loathing in her face as she looked
straight into his. But what he had not seen was the look of
horror that followed as the missile struck him instead of Korth,
sending him crumpling to earth.</p>

<p>Slowly Waldo turned away from the scene of battle, and without
even a second look at his vanquished enemy limped painfully into
the brush. His heart was very heavy and he was weak from
exhaustion and loss of blood, but he staggered on, back toward
his mountain lair, as he thought, until unable to go further he
sank down upon a little grassy knoll and slept.</p>

<p>When Nadara recovered from the shock of the thing she had done
sufficiently to reason for herself she realized that after all
Thandar might not be dead, and though the old man protested long
and loudly against it, she insisted upon retracing her steps
toward the spot where they had left the yellow giant in the
clutches of Korth.</p>

<p>Very cautiously the girl threaded her way through the maze of
shrubbery and creepers that filled the intervening space between
the forest trees, until she came silently to the edge of the
clearing in which the two had fought.</p>

<p>As she peered anxiously through the last curtain of foliage
she saw a single body lying quiet and still upon the sward, and
an instant later recognized it as Korth's. For several minutes
she watched it before she became convinced that the man who had
so terrorized her whole childish life could never again offer her
harm. She looked about for Thandar, but he was nowhere to be
seen. Nadara could scarcely believe that her eyes were not
deceiving her.</p>

<p>It was incredible that the yellow one could have gone down to
unconsciousness before her unintentional blow and yet have
mastered the mighty Korth; but how else could Korth have met his
death and Thandar be gone?</p>

<p>She approached quite close to the dead man, turning the body
over with her foot until the throat was visible. There she saw
the finger-marks that had done the work, and with a little thrill
of pride she turned back into the forest, calling Thandar's name
aloud.</p>

<p>But Thandar did not hear. Half a mile away he lay weak and
unconscious from loss of blood.</p>

<p>Morning found Nadara sleeping in a sturdy tree upon the trail
along which Waldo had followed Korth. She had discovered the
footprints of the two men the evening before while she had been
searching unsuccessfully for the trail which Waldo had followed
after the battle. She hoped now that the spoor might lead her to
Thandar's cave, to which she felt it quite possible he might have
returned by another way.</p>

<p>When the girl awoke she again took up her journey, following
the tracks as unerringly as a hound up through the hilly country,
across the divide and down into the jungle to the very watering
place at which her tribe had drank a few days earlier.</p>

<p>Here she made a brief stay.</p>

<p>Then on again down the river, back through the jungle and onto
the divide once more. She was much mystified by the windings of
the trail, but for days she followed the fading spoor until,
becoming fainter and fainter as, it grew older, she lost it
entirely at last.</p>

<p>She was quite sure by now, however, that it led from her
tribe's former territory, and so she kept on, hoping against
hope, that soon she would come across the fresh track of Thandar
where he had passed her on his return journey to his home.</p>

<p>Nadara had eluded the old man when she started upon her search
for Thandar, so it was that the old fellow returned to the
dwellings of his people alone the following day.</p>

<p>Flatfoot was the first to greet him.</p>

<p>"Where is the girl?" he growled. "And where is Korth? Has he
taken her? Answer me the truth or I will break every bone in your
carcass."</p>

<p>"I do not know where the girl is," answered the old man
truthfully enough, "but Korth lies dead in the little glade
beyond the three great trees. A mighty man killed him as he was
dragging Nadara off into the thicket&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the man has taken the girl for himself?" yelled Flatfoot.
"You old thief you. This is some of your work. Always have you
tried to cheat me of this girl since first you knew that I
desired her. Whither went they? Quick! before I kill you."</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied the old man. "For hours I searched,
until darkness came, but neither of them could I find, and my old
eyes are no longer keen for trailing, so I was forced to abandon
my hunt and return here when morning came."</p>

<p>"By the three trees the trail starts, you say?" cried
Flatfoot. "That is enough&mdash;I shall find them. And when I
return with the girl it will be time enough to kill you; now it
would delay me too much," and with that the cave man hurried away
into the forest.</p>

<p>It took him half a day to find Nadara's trail, but at last his
search was rewarded, and as she had made no effort to hide it he
moved rapidly along in the wake of the unsuspecting girl; but he
was not as swift as she, and the chase bid fair to be a long
one.</p>

<p>When Waldo woke he found the sun beating down upon his face,
and though he was lame and sore he felt quite strong enough to
continue his journey; but whither he should go he did not
know.</p>

<p>Now that Nadara had turned against him the island held nothing
for him, and he was on the point of starting back toward his far
distant lair from where he might visit the ocean often to watch
for a passing ship, when the sudden decision came to him to see
the girl again, regardless of her evident hostility, and learn
from her own lips the exact reason of her hatred for him. He had
had no idea that the loss of her friendship would prove such a
blow to him, so that his pride suffered as well as his heart as
he contemplated his harrowed emotions.</p>

<p>Of course he was reasonably sure that Nadara's attitude was
due to his ungallant desertion, for which act he had long
suffered the most acute pangs of remorse and contrition. Yet he
felt that her apparent vindictiveness was not warranted by even
the grave offense against chivalry and gratitude of which he had
been guilty.</p>

<p>It presently occurred to him that by the traitorous attack
which he believed that she had made upon him while he was acting
in her defense she had forfeited every claim which her former
kindness might have given her upon him, but with this realization
came another&mdash;a humiliating thought&mdash;he still wished to
see her!</p>

<p>He, Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, had become so devoid of pride
that he would voluntarily search out one who had wronged and
outraged his friendship, with the avowed determination of seeking
a reconciliation. It was unthinkable, and yet, as he admitted the
impossibility of it, he set forth in search of her.</p>

<p>Waldo wondered not a little at the strange
emotion&mdash;inherent gregarious instinct, he thought
it&mdash;which drew him toward Nadara.</p>

<p>It did not occur to him that during all the past solitary
months he had scarcely missed the old companionship of his Back
Bay friends; that for once that they had been the subject of his
reveries the cave girl had held the center of that mental stage a
thousand times.</p>

<p>He failed to realize that it was not the companionship of the
many that he craved; that it was not the community instinct, or
that his strange longing could be satisfied by but a single
individual. No, Waldo Emerson did not know what was the matter
with him, nor was it likely that he ever would find out before it
was too late.</p>

<p>The young man attempted to retrace his steps to the battle-
ground of the previous day, but he had been so dazed after the
encounter that he had no clear recollection of the direction he
had taken after he quitted the glade.</p>

<p>So it was that he stumbled in precisely the opposite
direction, presently emerging from the underbrush almost at the
foot of a low cliff tunneled with many caves. All about were the
morose, unhappy community whose savage lives were spent in almost
continual wandering from one filthy, comfortless warren to
another equally foul and wretched.</p>

<p>At sight of them Waldo did not flee in dismay, as most
certainly would have been the case a few months earlier. Instead,
he walked confidently toward them.</p>

<p>As he approached they ceased whatever work they were engaged
upon and eyed him suspiciously. Then several burly males
approached him warily.</p>

<p>At a hundred yards they halted.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" they cried. "If you come to our village we
can kill you."</p>

<p>Before Waldo could reply an old man crawled from a cave near
the base of the cliff, and as his eyes fell upon the stranger he
hurried as rapidly as his ancient limbs would carry him to the
little knot of ruffians who composed the reception committee.</p>

<p>He spoke to them for a moment in a low tone and, as he was
talking, Waldo recognized him as the old man who had accompanied
Nadara on the previous day at the battle in the glade. When he
had finished speaking one of the cave men assented to whatever
proposal the decrepit one had made, and Waldo saw that each of
the others nodded his head in approval.</p>

<p>Then the old man advanced slowly toward Waldo. When he had
come quite close he spoke.</p>

<p>"I am an old man," he said. "Thandar would not kill an old
man?"</p>

<p>"Of course not; but how know you that my name is Thandar?"
replied Waldo.</p>

<p>"Nadara, she who is my daughter, has spoken of you often.
Yesterday we saw you as you battled with that son of
Nagoola&mdash;Nadara told me then that it was you. What would
Thandar among the people of Flatfoot?"</p>

<p>"I come as a friend," replied Waldo, "among the friends of
Nadara. For Flatfoot I care nothing. He is no friend of Nadara,
whose friends are Thandar's friends, and whose enemies are
Thandar's enemies. Where is Nadara&mdash;but first, where is
Flatfoot? I have come to kill him."</p>

<p>The words and the savage challenge slipped as easily from the
cultured tongue of Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones as though he had
been born and reared in the most rocky and barren cave of this
savage island, nor did they sound strange or unusual to him. It
seemed that he had said the most natural and proper thing under
the circumstances that there was to say.</p>

<p>"Flatfoot is not here," said the old man, "nor is Nadara.
She&mdash;" but here Waldo interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Korth, then," he demanded. "Where is Korth? I can kill him
first and Flatfoot when he returns."</p>

<p>The old man looked at the speaker in unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p>"Korth!" he exclaimed. "Korth is dead. Can it be that you do
not know that he, whom you killed yesterday, was Korth?"</p>

<p>Waldo's eyes opened as wide in surprise as had the old
man's.</p>

<p>Korth! He had killed the redoubtable Korth with his bare
hands&mdash;Korth, who could crush the skull of a full-grown man
with a single blow from his open palm.</p>

<p>Clearly he recollected the very words in which Nadara had
described this horrible brute that time she had harrowed his
poor, coward nerves, as they approached the village of Flatfoot.
And now he, Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, had met and killed the
creature from whom he had so fearfully fled a few months ago!</p>

<p>And, wonder of wonders, he had not even thought to use the
weapons upon which he had spent so many hours of handicraft and
months of practice in preparation for just this occasion. Of a
sudden he recalled the old man's statement that Nadara was not
there.</p>

<p>"Where is she&mdash;Nadara?" he cried, turning so suddenly
upon the ancient one that the old fellow drew back in alarm.</p>

<p>"I have done nothing to harm her," he cried. "I followed and
would have brought her back, but I am old and could not find her.
Once, when I was young, there was no better trailer or mighty
warrior among my people than I, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," exclaimed Waldo impatiently; "but Nadara! Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied the old man. "She has gone, and I
could not find her. Well do I remember how, years ago, when the
trail of an enemy was faint or the signs of game hard to find,
men would come to ask me to help them, but now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," interrupted Waldo; "but Nadara. Do you not even
know in what direction she has gone?"</p>

<p>"No; but since Flatfoot has set forth upon her trail it should
be easy to track the two of them."</p>

<p>"Flatfoot set out after Nadara!" cried Waldo. "Why?"</p>

<p>"For many moons he has craved her for his mate, as has Korth,"
explained Nadara's father; "but I think that each feared the
other, and because of that fact Nadara was saved from both; but
at last Korth came upon us alone and away from the village, and
then he grasped Nadara and would have taken her away, for
Flatfoot was not about to prevent.</p>

<p>"You came then, and the rest you know. If I had been younger
neither Flatfoot nor Korth would have dared menace Nadara, for
when I was a young man I was very terrible and the record of my
kills was a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How long since did Flatfoot set out after Nadara?" Waldo
broke in.</p>

<p>"But a few hours since," replied the old man. "It would be an
easy thing for me to overtake him by night had I the speed of my
youth, for I well remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From where did Flatfoot start upon the trail?" cried the
young man. "Lead me to the place."</p>

<p>"This way then, Thandar," said the other, starting off toward
the forest. "I will show you if you will save Nadara from
Flatfoot. I love her. She has been very kind and good to me. She
is unlike the rest of our people.</p>

<p>"I should die happy if I knew that you have saved her from
Flatfoot, but I am an old man and may not live until Nadara
returns. Ah, that reminds me; there is that in my cave which
belongs to Nadara, and were I to die there would be none to
protect it for her.</p>

<p>"Will you wait for the moment that it will take me to run and
fetch it, that you may carry it to her, for I am sure that you
will find her; though I am not as sure that you will overcome
Flatfoot if you meet him. He is a very terrible man."</p>

<p>Waldo hated to waste a minute of the precious time that was
allowing Flatfoot to win nearer and nearer Nadara; but if it were
in a service for the girl who had been so kind to him and for the
happiness of her old father he could not refuse, so he waited
impatiently while the old fellow tottered off toward the
caves.</p>

<p>Those who had come half-way to meet Waldo had hovered at a
safe distance while he had been speaking to Nadara's father, and
when the two turned toward the forest all had returned to their
work in evident relief; for the old man had told them that the
stranger was the mighty warrior who had killed the terrible Korth
with his bare hands, nor had the story lost anything in the
telling.</p>

<p>After what seemed hours to the waiting Waldo the old man
returned with a little package carefully wrapped in the skin of a
small rodent, the seams laboriously sewed in a manner of lacing
with pieces of gut.</p>

<p>"This is Nadara's," he said as they continued their way toward
the forest. "It contains many strange things of which I know not
the meaning or purpose. They all were taken from the body of her
mother when the woman died. You will give them to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Waldo. "I will give them to Nadara, or die in the
trying of it."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="cha10" id="cha10">X. &mdash; THE TRAIL'S
END</a></h2>

<p class="first">Soon they came upon the trail of Flatfoot in the
glade by the three great trees; they had not searched for it
sooner, for the old man knew that it would start from that point
upon its quest for the girl.</p>

<p>The tracks circled the glade a dozen times in widening laps
until at last, at the point where Flatfoot must have picked up
the spoor of Nadara, they broke suddenly away into the
underbrush.</p>

<p>Once the way was plain Waldo bid the old man be of good heart,
for he would surely bring his daughter back to him unharmed if
the thing lay in the power of man. Then he hurried off upon the
new-made trail that lay as plain and readable before him as had
the printed page of his former life; but never had he bent with
such keen interest to the reading of his favorite author as he
did to this absorbing drama written in the turned leaves, the
scattered twigs, and the soft mud of a primeval forest by the
feet of a savage man and a savage maid.</p>

<p>Toward mid-afternoon Waldo became aware that he was much
weaker from the effects of his battle with Korth than he had
supposed. He had lost much blood from his wounds, and the
exertion of following the trail at a swift pace had reopened some
of the worse ones, so that now, as he ran, he was leaving a
little trail of blood behind him.</p>

<p>The discovery made him almost frantic, for it seemed to
presage failure. His condition would handicap him in the race
after the two along whose track he pursued so that it would be a
miracle were he to reach Flatfoot before the brute overtook
Nadara.</p>

<p>And if he did overtake him in time&mdash;what then? Would he
be physically able to cope with the brawny monster? He feared
that he would not, but that he kept doggedly to the grueling
chase augured well for the new manhood that had been so recently
born within him.</p>

<p>On and on he stumbled, until at dusk he slipped and fell
exhausted to the earth. Twice he struggled to his feet in an
attempt to go on, but he was forced to give in, lying where he
was until morning.</p>

<p>Slightly refreshed, he ate of the roots and fruit which
abounded in the forest, taking up the chase again, but this time
more slowly.</p>

<p>He was now convinced that the way led back along the same
trail which he had followed into the country, and when he reached
the point at which he had first met Korth on the previous day he
cut across the little space which intervened between the cave
man's tracks and the point at which he had stood before he went
down over the divide into the jungle toward the river and the
ford.</p>

<p>A moment later he was rewarded by the sight of Nadara's dainty
footprints as well as those of Flatfoot leading away along his
old trail. The act had saved him several miles of needless
tracking. All that day he followed as rapidly as his weakened
condition would permit, but his best efforts seemed dismally
snail-like. Along the way he bowled over a couple of large
rodents, which he ate raw, for he had long since learned the
desirability of a meat diet for one undergoing severe physical
exertion, and had conquered his natural aversion for the uncooked
flesh. He even had come to relish it, though often as he dined
thus upon meat a broad grin illumined his countenance at the
thought of the horror with which his mother and his Boston
friends would view such a hideous performance.</p>

<p>As he continued trailing the two he was at first surprised to
discover the fidelity with which Nadara had clung to his old
trail, and because of this fact he often was able to save miles
at a time by taking cross-cuts where, on his way in, he had made
wide detours. But at last, on the third day, when he attempted
this at a place which would have saved him fully ten miles, he
was dismayed by the discovery that he could not again pick up
either Nadara's trail or that of the cave man. Even his own old
trail was entirely obliterated.</p>

<p>It was this fact which caused him the greatest concern, for it
meant that if Nadara really had been following it she must now be
wandering rather aimlessly, possibly in an attempt to again
locate it. In which event her speed would be materially reduced,
and the probability of her capture by Flatfoot much enhanced.</p>

<p>It was possible, too, that the beast already had overtaken
her&mdash;this, in fact, might be the true cause of the cessation
of the pursuit along the way which it had proceeded up to this
point. The thought sent Waldo back along his former route, which
he was able to follow by recollection, though the spoor was
seldom visible.</p>

<p>He came upon no sign of those he sought that day, but the next
morning he found the point at which Nadara had lost his old trail
upon a rocky ridge. The girl evidently assumed that it would lead
into the valley below where she might pick it up again in the
soft earth, and so her footprints led down a shelving bluff,
while plain above them showed the huge imprints of Flatfoot.</p>

<p>Up to this point at least he had not caught up with her. Waldo
breathed a sigh of relief at the discovery. The trail was at
least two days old, for Nadara and Flatfoot had traveled much
more rapidly than the wounded man who haunted their footsteps
like a grim shadow.</p>

<p>About noon Waldo came to a little stream at which both those
who preceded him had evidently stopped to drink&mdash;he could
see where they had knelt in the soft grass at the water's
edge.</p>

<p>As Waldo stopped to quench his own thirst his eyes rested for
an instant upon the farther bank, which at that point was little
more than ten feet from him. He saw that the opposite shore was
less grassy, and that it sloped down to the water, forming a
muddy beach partially submerged.</p>

<p>But what riveted his attention were several deep imprints in
the mud.</p>

<p>He could not be certain, of course, at that distance, but he
was sure enough that he had recognized them to cause him to leap
to his feet, forgetful of his thirst, and plunge through the
stream for a closer inspection.</p>

<p>As he bent to examine the spoor at close range he could
scarcely repress a cry of exultation&mdash;they had been made by
the hands and knees of Nadara as she had stooped to drink at the
very spot not twenty-four hours before.</p>

<p>She must have circled back toward the brook for some reason;
but by far the greatest cause for rejoicing was the fact that
Nadara's trail alone was there. Flatfoot had not yet come upon
her, and Waldo now was between them.</p>

<p>The knowledge that he might yet be in time, and that he was
gaining sufficiently in strength to make it reasonably certain
that he could overhaul the girl eventually, filled Waldo with
renewed vigor. He hastened along Nadara's trail now with
something of the energy that had been his directly before his
battle with Korth. His wounds had ceased bleeding, and for
several days he had eaten well, and by night slept soundly, for
he had reasoned that only by conserving his energy and fortifying
himself in every way possible could he succor the girl.</p>

<p>That night he slept in a little thicket which had evidently
harbored Nadara the night before.</p>

<p>The following day the way lay across a rolling country, cut by
numerous deep ravines and lofty divides. That the pace was
telling on the girl Waldo could read in the telltale spoor that
revealed her lagging footsteps. Upon each eminence the man halted
to strain his eyes ahead for a sight of her.</p>

<p>About noon he discerned far ahead a shimmering line which he
knew must be the sea. Surely his long pursuit must end there. As
he was about to plunge on again along Nadara's trail something
drew his eyes toward the rear, and there upon another hilltop a
mile or two behind he saw the stocky figure of a half-naked
man&mdash;it was Flatfoot.</p>

<p>The cave man must have seen Waldo at the same instant, for,
with a menacing wave of his huge fist, he increased his gait to a
run, an instant later disappearing into the ravine which lay at
the bottom of the hill upon which he had come into view. Waldo
was undecided whether to wait for the encounter where he was or
hasten on in an effort to overtake Nadara, that she might not
escape him entirely. He knew that he stood a good chance of being
killed in the conflict, and he also knew that were he victorious
it might easily be at such a terrible price that he would be
physically incapable of continuing his search for the girl for
many days.</p>

<p>As he meditated his eyes wandered back and forth across the
landscape before him searching for Nadara. To his right lay, at a
little distance, a level plain which stretched to the foot of
low-lying cliffs at the valley's southern rim, some three or four
miles distant. In this direction his view was almost
unobstructed, but it was not in the direction of the girl's
flight, so that it was but by accident that Waldo's eyes swept
casually across the peaceful scene which would, at another time,
have chained his attention with its quiet and alluring
beauty.</p>

<p>It was as he swept a backward glance in the direction of
Flatfoot that his eye was arrested by the hint of something far
out across the valley, a little behind his own position.</p>

<p>To the Waldo of a few months previous it would not have been
visible, but the new woodcraft of the man scented the abnormal in
the vague suggestion of movement out among the long-waving
grasses of the plain.</p>

<p>And now, with every sense alert and riveted upon the spot, he
was quick to perceive that it was an animal moving slowly toward
the cliffs at the upper end of the valley. Presently a little
rise of ground, less thickly grassed, brought the creature into
full view for an instant; but in that instant Waldo saw that the
thing he watched was a woman.</p>

<p>As he turned to hurry after her he saw Flatfoot top another
hill a half mile nearer than he had been before, and as the cave
man came into view he turned his eyes in the direction that Waldo
had been looking. A second later and he had abandoned the pursuit
of Waldo and was running rapidly toward the woman.</p>

<p>Nadara had apparently circled back once more, this time from
the sea, and coming up the valley had passed Waldo and come
opposite Flatfoot before either of them had discovered her.</p>

<p>The young man gave a little cry of alarm as he realized that
the cave man was nearer to the girl than he&mdash;by a good half
mile, he judged, and so he put every ounce of his speed into the
wild dash he made down the hill into a gully which led out upon
the valley.</p>

<p>On and on he raced unable to see either Flatfoot or Nadara;
hoping, ever hoping, that he would be the first to win to her
side; for Nadara had told him of the atrocities that such a
creature as Flatfoot might perpetrate upon a woman rather than
permit her to escape him or fall into the hands of another.</p>

<p>Nadara, being upwind, caught neither the scent nor noise of
the two who were racing madly toward her. The first knowledge she
had that she was not alone in the valley was the sight of
Flatfoot as he broke suddenly through a clump of tall grass not
fifty paces from her.</p>

<p>She gave a little scream and started to run; but she was very
tired from the days of unremitting flight which had so sorely
taxed her endurance, and thus it was no wonder that she slipped
and fell before she had taken a dozen steps.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she gained her feet when Flatfoot was upon her,
one hand grasping her by the arm.</p>

<p>"Come with me in peace or I will kill you!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Kill me, then," retorted the despairing girl, "for I shall
never come with you; first will I kill myself."</p>

<p>Flatfoot did not wish to kill her, nor did he wish her to
escape, as she would be very likely to do should he be
interrupted by the fellow who must even now be quite close to
them. Possibly if he could keep the girl quiet they might hide in
the grass until their pursuer had gone by, and so Flatfoot,
acting upon the idea, clapped a rough hand over Nadara's mouth
and dragged her back along the trail he had just made.</p>

<p>The girl struggled&mdash;striking and clawing at the hairy
brute that pulled her along at his side&mdash;but she was as
helpless in his clutches as if she had been a day-old babe.</p>

<p>She did not know that help was so close at hand, or she would
have found the means to free her mouth and cry out once at least.
As it was, she wondered that Flatfoot should attempt to silence
her in this way if there were none to hear her screams.</p>

<p>For days she had known that the cave man was on her trail, for
once in doubling back upon herself she had passed but a short
distance from a ridge she had traversed the preceding day, and
had seen the man's squat figure and recognized his awkward,
shuffling trot.</p>

<p>It was this knowledge that had turned her away from the old
village toward which she had been traveling since she lost
Thandar's trail, and sent her in search of a new country, in
which she might lose herself from Flatfoot.</p>

<p>As the man dragged her roughly on through the grass Nadara
racked her brain for some means of escape, or a way to end her
misery before the beast could have his way with her. But there
came no ray of hope to her poor, unhappy heart.</p>

<p>If Thandar were but there! He would save her, even if it were
but to desert her the next instant. But did she wish to be saved
again by him? Now that she pondered the idea she was quite sure
that she would rather die than see him again, for had he not
twice run away from her?</p>

<p>In her misery she put this interpretation upon the remarkable
disappearance of Thandar after his battle with Korth&mdash;he had
waited until she was out of sight and then he had risen and fled
for fear she might return and discover him. She wondered why he
should dislike her so much.</p>

<p>She was quite sure that she had been very good to him, and had
tried not to annoy him while they were together. Maybe he looked
down upon her, for surely he was of a superior race; of that she
was quite positive.</p>

<p>And so Nadara was very miserable and unhappy and hopeless as
the brutal Flatfoot dragged her far into the tall jungle-grass.
Presently she noticed that the cave man repeatedly cast glances
toward the rear.</p>

<p>What could he expect from that direction, or from any
direction whatever, so far as that was concerned? Were they not
days and days from their own people, in a land where there seemed
no men at all?</p>

<p>Flatfoot heard no sign of pursuit. He was growing more
confident. The stranger had lost their trail. The cave man moved
less rapidly, and as he went he looked now for a burrow into
which he might crawl with the maiden. Then there would be no
further danger whatever.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Flatfoot would come out and find the fellow and kill
him, but now he had pleasanter work in view, nor did he wish to
be disturbed.</p>

<p>And at that very moment he caught a stealthy movement in the
grasses a few yards to his right. Waldo had come upon the spot at
which Flatfoot had overtaken Nadara but a few moments after the
brute had dragged her away, and on the instant had sought a
higher piece of ground from which he could overlook the tall
grass. Nor had he been long in finding a spot that, coupled with
his six feet two, brought his eyes above the level of the
surrounding jungle. There he watched for a little until he
discerned a movement of the grasstops at a little distance from
him. After that it was but a matter of trailing.</p>

<p>When Flatfoot saw what he took to be his enemy he threw Nadara
across his shoulder and started on a run in the opposite
direction&mdash;at right angles to the way he had been going. The
ruse proved good, for when Waldo came to the point at which he
had figured his path would cross the cave man's he found no sign
of the latter, and in searching about to locate the trail lost
many minutes of valuable time. But at last he came upon that
which he sought, and with redoubled speed set out at a rapid run
through the tall grasses.</p>

<p>He had proceeded but a short distance when the trail broke
suddenly into the open, close by the base of the cliffs that he
had seen from the hill that had given him his fleeting glimpse of
Nadara.</p>

<p>Ahead of him he saw the two he sought&mdash;Nadara across the
burly shoulders of Flatfoot&mdash;and the cave man was making for
the caves that dotted the face of the cliff. Were he to reach
these he might defend one of them against a single antagonist
indefinitely.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="cha11" id="cha11">XI. &mdash; CAPTURE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Almost at the moment that Waldo emerged from the
jungle Nadara saw him, and with a lunge threw herself from
Flatfoot's shoulder.</p>

<p>The man turned with a fierce growl of rage, and his eyes fell
upon the giant rushing toward them.</p>

<p>The girl was now struggling madly to escape or delay her
captor. There could be but one outcome, as Flatfoot knew. He must
fight now, but the girl should never escape him.</p>

<p>Raising the huge fist that had killed many a full-grown man
with a single blow he aimed a wicked one at the side of Nadara's
head.</p>

<p>The first one she dodged, and as the arm went up to strike
again, Thandar threw his spear-arm far back and with a mighty
forward surge drove his light weapon across the hundred feet that
separated him from Flatfoot.</p>

<p>It was an awful risk&mdash;there was not a foot to spare
between the hairy breast that was his target and the beautiful
head of the fair captive. Should either move between the time the
spear left his hand and the instant that it found its mark it
might pierce the one it had been sped to save.</p>

<p>Flatfoot's fist was crashing down toward that lovely face at
the instant that the spear found him; but he had moved&mdash;just
enough to place his arm before his breast&mdash;so that it was
the falling arm that received the weapon instead of the heart
that it had been intended for.</p>

<p>But it served its purpose. With a howl of pain and rage,
Flatfoot, forgetful of the girl in the madness of his anger,
dropped her and sprang toward Waldo.</p>

<p>The latter had drawn his sword&mdash;naught but a sharpened
stick of hard wood&mdash;and stood waiting to receive his foe. It
was his first attempt to put either sword or shield into
practical use, and he was anxious to discover their value.</p>

<p>As Flatfoot came toward his antagonist he pulled the spear
from the muscles of his arm, and, stooping, gathered up one of
the many rocks that lay scattered about at the base of the
cliff.</p>

<p>The cave man was roaring like a mad bull; hate and murder shot
from his close-set eyes; his upper lip curled back, showing his
fighting fangs, and a light froth flecked his bristling
beard.</p>

<p>Waldo was sure there had never existed a more fearsome
creature, and he marveled that he was not afraid. The very
thought of what the effect of this terrible monster's mad charge
would have been upon him a short while ago brought a smile to his
lips.</p>

<p>At sight of that taunting smile Flatfoot hurled the rock full
at the maddening face. With a quick movement of his left arm
Waldo caught the missile on his buckler, from whence it dropped
harmlessly to the ground.</p>

<p>Flatfoot did not throw again, and an instant later he was upon
the Bostonian&mdash;the pride and hope of the cultured and
aristocratic Back Bay Smith-Joneses.</p>

<p>When he reached for the agile, blond giant he found a thin
sheet of hide-covered twigs in his way, and when he tried to tear
down this barrier the point of a sharpened stick was thrust into
his abdomen.</p>

<p>This was no way to fight!</p>

<p>Flatfoot was scandalized. He jumped back a few feet and glared
at Waldo. Then he lowered his head and came at him once more with
the very evident intention of rushing him off his feet by the
very weight and impetuosity of his charge.</p>

<p>This time the sharp stick slipped quickly over the top of the
hide-covered atrocity and pierced Flatfoot's neck just where it
joined his thick skull. Burying a foot of its point beneath the
muscles of the shoulder, it brought a scream of pain and rage
from the hairy beast.</p>

<p>Before Waldo could withdraw his weapon from the tough sinews,
Flatfoot had straightened up with a sudden jerk that snapped the
sword short, leaving but a short stub in his antagonist's
hand.</p>

<p>Nadara had been watching the battle breathlessly, ready to
flee should it turn against her champion, yet at the same time
searching for an opportunity to aid him.</p>

<p>Like Flatfoot, the girl had never before seen spear or sword
or shield in use, and while she marveled at the advantage which
they gave Thandar, she became dubious as to the result of the
encounter when she saw the sword broken, for the spear had been
snapped into kindling-wood by Flatfoot when he tore it from his
arm.</p>

<p>But Waldo still had his cudgel, fastened by a thong to his
sword-belt, and as the cave man rushed upon him again he swung a
mighty blow to the low, brutal forehead.</p>

<p>Momentarily stunned, the fellow reeled backward for a step,
and again Waldo wielded his new weapon.</p>

<p>Flatfoot trembled, his knees smote together, he staggered
drunkenly, and then, when Waldo looked to see him go down, the
brute power that was in him, responding to nature's first law,
sent him hurtling at the Bostonian's throat in the snarling,
blind rage of the death-smitten beast.</p>

<p>Catapulted by all the enormous strength of his mighty muscles,
the squat, bear-like animal bore Waldo to earth, and at the same
instant each found the other's throat with sinewy, viselike
fingers.</p>

<p>They lay very still now, choking with firm, relentless clutch.
Every ounce of muscle was needed, every grain of endurance. Waldo
was suffering agonies after a moment of that awful death-grip. He
could feel his gasping, pain-racked lungs struggling for air.</p>

<p>He tried to wriggle free from those horrible fingers, but not
once did he loosen his own hold upon the throat of Flatfoot;
instead he tried to close a little tighter each second that he
felt his own life ebbing. He became weaker and weaker. The pain
was unendurable now. A haze obscured his vision&mdash;everything
became black&mdash;his brain was whizzing about at frightful
velocity within the awful darkness of his skull.</p>

<p>The girl was bending close above them now, for both were
struggling less violently. She had been minded to come to
Thandar's rescue when suddenly she recalled his desertion of her,
and all the wild hatred of the primitive mind surged through
her.</p>

<p>Let him die, she thought. He had spurned her, cast her off; he
looked down upon her. Well, let him take care of himself, then,
and she turned deliberately away to leave the two men to decide
the outcome of their own battle, and started back upon the trail
in the direction of her tribe's village.</p>

<p>But she had taken scarce a score of steps when something
flamed up in her heart that withered the last remnant of her
malice toward Thandar. As she turned back again toward the
combatants she attempted to justify this new weakness by the
thought that it was only fair that she should give the yellow one
aid in return for the aid that he had rendered her; that done,
she could go on her way with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>She wished never to see him again, but she could not have his
blood upon her hands. At that thought she gave a little cry and
ran to where the men lay.</p>

<p>Both were almost quiet now; their struggles had nearly ceased.
Just as she reached them Flatfoot relaxed, his hands slipped from
Waldo's throat and he lay entirely motionless.</p>

<p>Then the fair giant struggled convulsively once or twice; he
gasped, his eyes rolled up and set, and with a sudden twitching
of his muscles he stiffened rigidly and was very still.</p>

<p>Nadara gave one horrified look at the ghastly face of her
champion, and fled into the jungle.</p>

<p>She stumbled on for a quarter of a mile as fast as her tired
limbs would carry her through the entangling grasses, and then
she came to that which she sought&mdash;a little stream, winding
slowly through the valley down toward the ocean.</p>

<p>Dropping to her knees beside it she filled her mouth with the
refreshing water. In an instant she was up again and off in the
direction from which she had just come.</p>

<p>Throwing herself at Waldo's side, she wet his face with the
water from her mouth. She chafed his hands, shook him, blew upon
his face when the water was exhausted, and then, tears streaming
from her eyes, she threw herself upon him, covering his face with
kisses, and moaning inarticulate words of love and endearment
that were half stifled by anguished sobs of grief.</p>

<p>Suddenly her lamentations ceased as quickly as they had begun.
She raised her head from where it had been buried beside the
man's and looked intently into his face. Then she placed her ear
upon his breast; with a delighted cry she resumed chafing his
hands, for she had heard the beating of his heart.</p>

<p>Presently Waldo gasped, and for a moment suffered the agonies
of returning respiration. When he opened his eyes in
consciousness he saw Nadara bending over him&mdash;a severely
disinterested expression upon her beautiful face. He turned his
head to one side; there lay Flatfoot quite dead.</p>

<p>It was several moments before he could speak. Then he rose,
very unsteadily, to his feet.</p>

<p>"Nadara," he said, "Korth lies dead beside the three great
trees in the glade that is near the village that was Flatfoot's.
Here is the dead body of Flatfoot, and about my loins hangs the
pelt of Nagoola, taken in fair fight.</p>

<p>"I have done all that you desired of me; I have tried to repay
you for your kindness to me when I was a stranger in your land. I
do not know why you should have tried to kill me while I battled
with Korth.</p>

<p>"No more do I know why you have allowed me to live today when
it would have been so easy to have despatched me as I lay
unconscious here beside Flatfoot.</p>

<p>"I read dislike upon your face, and I am sorry, for I would
have parted with you in friendship, so that when the time comes
that I return to my own land I should be able to carry away with
me only the pleasant memory of it. When we have rested and are
refreshed I shall take you back to your father."</p>

<p>All that had been surging to the girl's lips of love and
gratitude from a heart that was filled with both was congealed by
the cold tone which marked this dispassionate recital of the
discharge of a moral obligation.</p>

<p>Possibly Waldo's tone was colored by the vivid memory of the
look of hate that he had seen in the girl's eyes at the instant
that he went down before her missile as he battled with Korth,
for it was not even tinged with friendliness.</p>

<p>And so the girl's manner was equally distant when she replied;
in fact, it was even colder, for it was fraught with
bitterness.</p>

<p>"Thandar owed nothing to Nadara," she said, "and though it
matters not at all, it is only fair to say that the stone that
struck you as you battled in the glade was intended for
Korth."</p>

<p>Waldo's face brightened. A load that he had not realized lay
there was lifted from his heart.</p>

<p>"You did not want to hurt me, then?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Why should I want to hurt you?" returned the girl.</p>

<p>"I thought"&mdash;and here Waldo spoiled the fair start they
had made at a reconciliation&mdash;"I thought," he said, "that
you were angry because I ran away from you after we had come to
your village that time, months ago."</p>

<p>Nadara's head went high and she laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"I angry? I was surprised that you did not come to the
village, but after an hour I had forgotten the matter&mdash;it
was with difficulty that I recognized you when I next saw you, so
utterly had the occurrence departed from my thoughts."</p>

<p>Waldo wondered why he should feel such humiliation at this
frank avowal. Of what moment to him was this girl's estimation of
him? Why did he feel a flush suffuse his face at the knowledge
that he was of so little moment to her that she had entirely
forgotten him within a few months?</p>

<p>Waldo was mortified and angry. He changed the subject
brusquely; hereafter he should eschew personalities.</p>

<p>"Let us find a cave at a distance from the dead man," he said,
"and there we may rest until you are ready to attempt the return
journey."</p>

<p>"I am ready now," replied Nadara; "nor do I need or desire
your company. I can return alone, as I came."</p>

<p>"No," remonstrated Waldo doggedly; "I shall go with you
whether you wish it or not. I shall see you safely with your
father. I promised him."</p>

<p>Nadara had been delighted with the first clause of his reply,
but when it became evident that his only desire to return with
her was to fulfil a promise made her father she became furious,
though she was careful not to let him see it.</p>

<p>"Very well," she replied; "you may come if you wish, though it
is neither necessary nor as I would have it. I prefer being
alone."</p>

<p>"I shall not force my company upon you," said Waldo haughtily.
"I can follow a few paces behind you."</p>

<p>There was an injured air in his last words which did not
escape the girl. She wondered if he really deserved the harsh
attitude she had maintained.</p>

<p>They found a cave a half-mile down the valley, where they took
up their quarters against the time that Waldo should be rested,
for the girl insisted that she was fully able to commence the
return journey at once.</p>

<p>The man knew better, and so he let her have it that the delay
was on his account rather than hers, for he doubted her ability
to cope with the hardships of the long journey without an
interval for recuperation.</p>

<p>The next morning found them both rested and in better spirits,
so that there was no return to their acrimonious encounter of the
previous day.</p>

<p>As they walked out toward the forest that lay down the valley
in the direction of the ocean Waldo dropped a few paces behind
the girl in polite deference to her expressed wish of the day
before.</p>

<p>As he walked he watched the graceful movements of her lithe
figure and the lines of her clear-cut profile as she turned her
head this way and that in search of food.</p>

<p>How beautiful she was! It was incredible that this wild cave
girl should have greater beauty and a more regal carriage than
the queens and beauties of civilization, and yet Waldo was forced
to admit that he had never even dreamed, much less seen, such
absolute physical perfection.</p>

<p>He wished that he could say as much for her disposition; that
was atrocious. It was unbelievable that such a wondrous exterior
could harbor so much ingratitude and coldness.</p>

<p>Presently they came among the trees where the ripe fruit hung,
and as Waldo climbed nimbly among the branches and tossed the
most luscious down to her, the girl, in her turn, watched
him.</p>

<p>She noted more closely the marvelous change that a few months
had wrought. She had thought him wonderful before, but now he was
a very god. She did not think just this, for she knew nothing of
gods&mdash;other than the demons that were supposed to enter the
bodies of the sick; but she thought of him as some superior
creature, and then she ceased to feel aggrieved that he should
care so little for her.</p>

<p>He was not a man&mdash;he was something more than a man, and
she had been very wicked to have treated him so shamefully. She
would make amends. So she tried to be more kind thereafter,
though there still remained a trace of aloofness.</p>

<p>Together they sat upon the turf and ate their fruit, and as
they ate they talked a little, for it is difficult for two young
people to harbor animosity for a great time, especially when
there is none other for them to talk to.</p>

<p>"When you have returned with me to my father, Thandar," the
girl asked, "where shall you go then?"</p>

<p>"I shall return to the sea where I may watch for a ship to
take me back to my own land," he replied.</p>

<p>"I have seen but one ship in all my life," said Nadara, "and
that was years ago. It was when we lived close by the big water
that it stopped a long way from shore and sent many smaller boats
to land.</p>

<p>"There were many men in the boats, and when they landed, my
father and mother took me far into the forest away from the sea,
and there we stayed for many days until the strangers had sailed.
They wandered up and down the coast and came back into the
forests and the jungles for a few miles.</p>

<p>"My mother said that they were searching for me, and that if
they found me they would take me away. I was very much
frightened."</p>

<p>At the mention of her mother Waldo recalled the little parcel
that Nadara's father had given into his custody for the girl. He
unfastened it from the thong that circled his waist, where it had
hung beneath his panther-skin garment.</p>

<p>"Here is something your father asked me to bring you," he
said, handing the package to Nadara.</p>

<p>The girl took it and examined it as though it was entirely
unfamiliar.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Your father did not say, other than that it contained
articles that your mother wore when she died," he said tenderly,
for a great pity had welled up in his heart for this poor,
motherless girl.</p>

<p>"That my mother wore!" Nadara repeated, her brows contracted
in a puzzled frown. "When my mother died she wore nothing but a
single garment of many small skins&mdash;very old and
worn&mdash;and that was buried with her. I do not
understand."</p>

<p>She made no effort to open the package, but sat gazing far off
toward the ocean which was just visible through the trees,
entirely absorbed in the reverie which Waldo's words had
engendered.</p>

<p>"Could the thing that the old woman told me have been true?"
the girl mused half aloud. "Could it have been because it was
true that my mother fell upon her with tooth and nail until she
had nearly killed her? I wonder if&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here she stopped, her eyes riveted in sudden fear and
hopelessness upon a thing that she had just espied in the
distance. A great lump rose in her throat, tears came to her
eyes, and with them the full measure of realization of what that
thing beyond the forest meant to her.</p>

<p>She turned her eyes toward the man. He was sitting with bowed
head, playing idly with a large beetle that he had penned within
a tiny palisade of small twigs. At length he made an opening in
the barrier.</p>

<p>"Go your way, poor thing," he murmured. "Heaven knows I
realize too well the horrors of captivity to keep any other
creature from its fellows and its home."</p>

<p>A choking sigh that was almost a sob racked the girl. At the
sound Waldo looked up to see her pathetic, unhappy eyes upon him.
Of a sudden there enveloped him a great desire to take her in his
arms and comfort her. He knew not why she was unhappy, but her
sorrow cried aloud to him&mdash;as he thought simply to the
protective instinct that was merely an attribute of his sex.</p>

<p>Nadara raised her hand slowly and pointed through the trees.
It was as though she had torn her heart from her breast, so
harrowing she felt the consequences of her act would be, but it
was for his sake&mdash;for the sake of the man she loved.</p>

<p>As Waldo's eyes followed the direction of her pointing finger
he came suddenly to his feet with a wild cry of joy; through the
trees, out upon the shimmering surface of the placid sea, there
lay a graceful, white yacht.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" cried the man fervently, and sinking to his knees
he raised his hands aloft toward the author of joy and
sorrow.</p>

<p>A moment later he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Home! Nadara. Home!" he cried. "Can't you realize it? I am
going home. I am saved! Oh, Nadara, child, can't you realize what
it means to me? Home! Home! Home!"</p>

<p>He had been looking toward the yacht as he spoke, but now he
turned toward the girl. She was crouching upon the ground, her
face in her hands, her slender figure shaken by convulsive
tears.</p>

<p>He came toward her and, kneeling, laid his hand upon her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Nadara!" he said gently. "Why do you cry, child? What is the
matter?" But she only shook her head, moaning.</p>

<p>He raised her to her feet, and as he supported her his arm
circled her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Nadara, why you are unhappy?" he urged.</p>

<p>But still she could not speak for sobbing, and only buried her
face upon his breast.</p>

<p>He was holding her very close now, and with the pressure of
her body against his a fire that, unknown, had been smoldering in
his heart for months burst into sudden flame, and in the heat of
it there were consumed the mists that had been before the eyes of
his heart all that time.</p>

<p>"Nadara," he asked in a very low voice, "is it because I am
going that you cry?"</p>

<p>But at that she pulled away from him, and through her tears
her eyes blazed.</p>

<p>"No!" she cried. "I shall be glad when you have gone. I wish
that you had never come. I&mdash;I&mdash;hate you!" She turned
and fled back up the valley, forgetful of the little packet
Thandar had brought her, which lay forgotten upon the ground
where she had dropped it.</p>

<p>Without so much as a backward glance toward the yacht Waldo
was off in pursuit of her; but Nadara was as fleet as a hare, so
that it was a much-winded Waldo who finally overhauled her half-
way up the face of a cliff two miles from the ocean.</p>

<p>"Go away!" cried the girl. "Go back with your own kind, to
your own home!"</p>

<p>Waldo did not answer.</p>

<p>Waldo was no more.</p>

<p>It was Thandar, the cave man, who took Nadara in his strong
arms and crushed her to him.</p>

<p>"My girl!" he cried. "My girl! I love you! And because I am a
fool I did not learn until it was almost too late."</p>

<p>He did not ask if she loved him, for he was Thandar, the cave
man. Nor, a moment later, did he need to ask, since her strong,
brown arms crept up about his neck and drew his lips down to
hers.</p>

<p>It was quite half an hour later before either thought of the
yacht again. From where they stood upon the cliff's face they
could see the ocean and the beach.</p>

<p>Several boats were drawn up and a number of men were coming
toward the forest. Presently they would discover the two upon the
cliff.</p>

<p>"We shall go back together now," said Thandar.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," replied Nadara.</p>

<p>For a time the man stood gazing at the dainty yacht, and far
beyond it into the civilization which it represented, and he saw
there suave men and sneering women, and among them was a slender
brown beauty who shrank from the cruel glances of the
women&mdash;and Waldo writhed at this and at the greedy eyes of
the suave men as they appraised the girl&mdash;and he, too, was
afraid.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, taking Nadara by the hand, "let us hurry back
into the hills before they discover us."</p>

<p>Just as the men from the yacht, which Mr. John Alden Smith-
Jones had despatched to the South Seas in search of his missing
son, emerged from the forest into a view of the valley and the
cliffs a cave man and his mate clambered over the brow of the
latter and disappeared toward the hills beyond.</p>

<p>It was nearly dusk as the searchers from the yacht were
returning toward the beach. They had found no sign of human
habitation in the little valley, nor anywhere along the coast
that they had so carefully explored.</p>

<p>The commander of the expedition, Captain Cecil Burlinghame, a
retired naval officer, was in advance. They had penetrated the
woods nearly to the beach when his foot struck against a package
wrapped in the skin of a small rodent.</p>

<p>He stooped and picked it up.</p>

<p>"Here is the first evidence that another human being than
ourselves has ever set foot upon this island," he said as he cut
the gut lacing with his pocket knife. Within the first wrapping
he found a chamois-bag such as women sometimes use to carry
jewels about their persons. From this he emptied into his palm a
dozen priceless rings, a few old-fashioned brooches, bracelets,
and lockets. In one of the latter he discovered the ivory
miniature of a woman&mdash;a very beautiful woman.</p>

<p>In the other side of the locket was engraved: "To Eug&egrave;nie
Marie C&eacute;leste de la Valois, Countess of Crecy, from Henri, her
husband. 17th January, 18&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gad!" cried the old captain. "Now what do you make of
that?</p>

<p>"The Count and Countess of Crecy were returning to Paris from
their honeymoon trip round the world in the steam yacht Dolphin
nearly twenty years ago, and after they touched at Australia were
never heard of again.</p>

<p>"What tragedy, what mystery, what romance might not these
sparkling gems disclose had they but tongues!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="pt2" id="pt2">THE CAVE MAN</a></h2><br>

<h2><a name="chb1" id="chb1">I. &mdash; KING BIG FIST</a></h2>

<p class="first">Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, scion of the
aristocratic house of the John Alden Smith-Jones of Boston,
clambered up the rocky face of the precipitous cliff with the
agility of a monkey.</p>

<p>His right hand clasped the slim fingers of his half-naked
mate, assisting her over the more dangerous or difficult
stretches.</p>

<p>At the summit the two turned their faces back toward the sea.
Beyond the gently waving forest trees stretched the broad expanse
of the shimmering ocean. In the foreground, upon the bosom of a
tiny harbor, lay a graceful yacht&mdash;a beautiful toy it looked
from the distance of the cliff top.</p>

<p>For the first time the man obtained an unobstructed view of
the craft. Before, when they first had discovered it, the boles
of the trees had revealed it but in part.</p>

<p>Now he saw it fully from stem to stern with all its well-known
graceful lines standing out distinctly against the deep blue of
the water.</p>

<p>The shock of recognition brought an involuntary exclamation
from his lips. The girl looked quickly up into his face.</p>

<p>"What is it, Thandar?" she asked. "What do you see?"</p>

<p>"The yacht!" he whispered. "It is the
<i>Priscilla</i>&mdash;my father's. He is searching for me."</p>

<p>"And you wish to go?"</p>

<p>For some time he did not speak&mdash;stood there gazing at the
distant yacht. And the young girl at his side remained quite
motionless and silent, too, looking upon his face with a look of
dumb misery upon her own.</p>

<p>Quickly through the man's mind was running the gamut of his
past. He recalled his careful and tender upbringing&mdash;the
time, the money, the fond pride that had been expended upon his
education. He thought of the result&mdash;the narrow-minded
weakling egoist; the pusillanimous coward that had been washed
from the deck of a passing steamer upon the sandy beach of this
savage, forgotten shore.</p>

<p>And yet it had been love, solicitous and tender, that had
prompted his parents to their misguided efforts. He was their
only son. They were doubtless grieving for him. They were no
longer young, and in their declining years it appeared to him
pathetic, that they should be robbed of the happiness which he
might bring them by returning to the old life.</p>

<p>But could he ever return to the bookish existence that once
had seemed so pleasant?</p>

<p>Had not this brief year into which had been crowded so much of
wild, primitive life made impossible a return to the narrow,
self-centered existence? Had it not taught him that there was
infinitely more in life than ever had been written into the dry
and musty pages of books?</p>

<p>It had taught him to want life at first hand&mdash;not through
the proxy of the printed page. It and&mdash;Nadara. He glanced
toward the girl.</p>

<p>Could he give her up? No! A thousand times no!</p>

<p>He read in her face the fear that lurked in her heart. No, he
could not give her up. He owed to her all that he possessed of
which he was most proud&mdash;his mighty physique, his new-found
courage, his woodcraft, his ability to cope, primitively, with
the primitive world, her savage world which he had learned to
love.</p>

<p>No, he could not give her up; but&mdash;what? His gaze
lingered upon her sweet face. Slowly there sank into his
understanding something of the reason for his love of this wild,
half-savage cave girl other than the primitive passion of the
sexes.</p>

<p>He saw now not only the physical beauty of her face and
figure, but the sweet, pure innocence of her girlishness, and
most of all, all the wondrous tenderness of her love of him that
was mirrored in her eyes.</p>

<p>To remain and take her as his mate after manner and customs of
her own people would reflect no shame upon himself or her; but
was she not deserving of the highest honor that it lay within his
power to offer at the altar of her love?</p>

<p>She&mdash;his wonderful Nadara&mdash;must become his through
the most solemn and dignified ceremony that civilized man had
devised. What the young woman of his past life demanded was none
too good for her.</p>

<p>Again the girl voiced her question.</p>

<p>"You wish to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Nadara," he replied, "I must go back to my own
people&mdash;and you must go with me."</p>

<p>Her face lighted with pleasure and happiness as she heard his
last words; but the expression was quickly followed by one of
doubt and fear.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," she said; "but if you wish it I will go."</p>

<p>"You need not fear, Nadara. None will harm you by word or deed
while Thandar is with you. Come, let us return to the sea and the
yacht before she sails."</p>

<p>Hand in hand they retraced their steps down the steep cliff,
across the little valley toward the forest and the sea.</p>

<p>Nadara walked very close to Thandar, her hand snuggled in his
and her shoulder pressed tightly against his side, for she was
afraid of the new life among the strange creatures of
civilization.</p>

<p>At the far side of the valley, just before one enters the
forest, there grows a thick jungle of bamboo&mdash;really but a
narrow strip, not more than a hundred feet through at its
greatest width; but so dense as to quite shut out from any view
any creature even a few feet within its narrow, gloomy
avenues.</p>

<p>Into this the two plunged, Thandar in the lead, Nadara close
behind him, stepping exactly in his footprints&mdash;an
involuntary concession to training, for there was no need here
either of deceiving a pursuer, or taking advantage of easier
going. The trail was well-marked and smooth-beaten by many a
padded pad.</p>

<p>It wound erratically, following the line of least
resistance&mdash;it forked, and there were other trails which
entered it from time to time, or crossed it. The hundred feet it
traversed seemed so much more when measured by the trail.</p>

<p>The two had come almost to the forest side of the jungle when
a sharp turn in the path brought Thandar face to face with a huge
bear-like man.</p>

<p>The fellow wore a g-string of soft hide, and over one shoulder
dangled an old and filthy leopard skin&mdash;otherwise, he was
naked. His thick, coarse hair was matted low over his forehead.
The balance of his face was covered by a bushy red beard.</p>

<p>At sight of Thandar his close-set, little eyes burned with
sullen rage and cunning. From his thick lips burst a savage
yell&mdash;it was the preliminary challenge.</p>

<p>Ordinarily a certain amount of vituperation and coarse insults
must pass between strangers meeting upon this inhospitable isle
before they fly at one another's throat.</p>

<p>"I am Thurg," bellowed the brute. "I can kill you," and then
followed a volley of vulgar allusions to Thandar's possible
origin and the origin of his ancestors.</p>

<p>"The bad men," whispered Nadara.</p>

<p>With her words there swept into the man's memory the scene
upon the face of the cliff that night a year before when, even in
the throes of cowardly terror, he had turned to do battle with a
huge cave man that the fellow might not prevent the escape of
Nadara.</p>

<p>He glanced at the right forearm of the creature who faced him.
A smile touched Thandar's lips&mdash;the arm was crooked as from
the knitting of a broken bone, poorly set.</p>

<p>"You would kill Thandar&mdash;again?" he asked tauntingly,
pointing toward the deformed member.</p>

<p>Then came recognition to the red-rimmed eyes of Thurg, as,
with another ferocious bellow, he launched himself toward the
author of his old hurt.</p>

<p>Thandar met the charge with his short stick of pointed hard
wood&mdash;his "sword" he called it. It entered the fleshy part
of Thurg's breast, calling forth a howl of pain and a trickling
stream of crimson.</p>

<p>Thurg retreated. This was no way to fight. He was
scandalized.</p>

<p>For several minutes he stood glaring at his foe, screaming
hideous threats and insults at him. Then once more he
charged.</p>

<p>Again the painful point entered his body, but this time he
pressed in clutching madly at the goad and for a hold upon
Thandar's body.</p>

<p>The latter held Thurg at arm's length, prodding him with the
fire-hardened point of his wooden sword.</p>

<p>The cave man's little brain wondered at the skill and prowess
of this stranger who had struck him a single blow with a cudgel
many moons before and then run like a rabbit to escape his
wrath.</p>

<p>Why was it that he did not run now? What strange change had
taken place in him? He had expected an easy victim when he
finally had recognized his foe; but instead he had met with brawn
and ferocity equal to his own and with a strange weapon, the like
of which he had never before seen.</p>

<p>Thandar was puncturing him rapidly now, and Thurg was
screaming in rage and suffering. Presently he could endure it no
longer. With a sudden wrench he tore himself loose and ran,
bellowing, through the jungle.</p>

<p>Thandar did not pursue. It was enough that he had rid himself
of his enemy. He turned toward Nadara, smiling.</p>

<p>"It will seem very tame in Boston," he said; but though she
gave him an answering smile, she did not understand, for to her
Boston was but another land of primeval forests and dense
jungles, of hairy, battling men, and fierce beasts.</p>

<p>At the edge of the forest they came again upon Thurg, but this
time he was surrounded by a score of his burly tribesmen. Thandar
knew better than to pit himself against so many.</p>

<p>Thurg came rushing down upon them, his fellows at his heels.
In loud tones he screamed anew his challenge, and the beasts
behind him took it up until the forest echoed to their hideous
bellowing.</p>

<p>He had seen Nadara as he had battled with Thandar, and
recognized her as the girl he had desired a year before&mdash;the
girl whom this stranger had robbed him of.</p>

<p>Now he was determined to wreak vengeance on the man and at the
same time recapture the girl.</p>

<p>Thandar and Nadara turned back into the jungle where but a
single enemy could attack them at a time in the narrow trails.
Here they managed to elude pursuit for several hours, coming
again into the forest nearly a mile below the beach where the
<i>Priscilla</i> had lain at anchor.</p>

<p>Thurg and his fellows had apparently given up the
chase&mdash;they had neither seen nor heard aught of them for
some time. Now the two hastened back through the wood to reach a
point on the shore opposite the yacht.</p>

<p>At last they came in sight of the harbor. Thandar halted. A
look of horror and disappointment supplanted the expression of
pleasurable anticipation that had lighted his
countenance&mdash;the yacht was not there.</p>

<p>A mile out they discerned her, steaming rapidly north.</p>

<p>Thandar ran to the beach. He tore the black panther's hide
from his shoulders, waving it frantically above his head, the
while he shouted in futile endeavor to attract attention from the
dwindling craft.</p>

<p>Then, quite suddenly, he collapsed upon the beach, burying his
face in his hands.</p>

<p>Presently Nadara crept close to his side. Her soft arms
encircled his shoulders as she drew his cheek close to hers in an
attempt to comfort him.</p>

<p>"Is it so terrible," she asked, "to be left here alone with
your Nadara?"</p>

<p>"It is not that," he answered. "If you were mine I should not
care so much, but you cannot be mine until we have reached
civilization and you have been made mine in accordance with the
laws and customs of civilized men. And now who knows when another
ship may come&mdash;if ever another will come?"</p>

<p>"But I am yours, Thandar," insisted the girl. "You are my
man&mdash;you have told me that you love me, and I have replied
that I would be your mate&mdash;who can give us to each other
better than we can give ourselves?"</p>

<p>He tried, as best he could, to explain to her the marriage
customs and ceremonies of his own world, but she found it
difficult to understand how it might be that a stranger whom
neither might possibly ever have seen before could make it right
for her to love her Thandar, or that it would be wrong for her to
love him without the stranger's permission.</p>

<p>To Thandar the future looked most black and hopeless. With his
sudden determination to take Nadara back to his own people he had
been overwhelmed with a mad yearning for home.</p>

<p>He realized that his past apathy to the idea of returning to
Boston had been due solely to recollection of Boston as he had
known it&mdash;Boston without Nadara; but now that she was to
have gone back with him Boston seemed the most desirable spot in
the world.</p>

<p>As he sat pondering the unfortunate happenings that had so
delayed them that the yacht had sailed before they reached the
shore, he also cast about for some plan to mitigate their
disappointment.</p>

<p>To live forever on this savage island did not seem such an
appalling thing as it had a year before&mdash;but then he had not
realized his love for the wild young creature at his side. Ah, if
she could but be made his wife then his exile here would be a
happy rather than a doleful lot.</p>

<p>What if he had been born here too? With the thought came a new
idea that seemed to offer an avenue from his dilemma. Had he,
too, been native-born, how would he have wed Nadara?</p>

<p>Why, through the ceremony of their own people, of course. And
if men and women were thus wed here, living together in
faithfulness throughout their lives, what more sacred a union
could civilization offer?</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Come, Nadara!" he cried. "We shall return to your people, and
there you shall become my wife."</p>

<p>Nadara was puzzled, but she made no comment; content simply to
leave the future to her lord and master; to do whatever would
bring Thandar the greatest happiness.</p>

<p>The return to the dwellings of Nadara's people occupied three
never-to-be-forgotten days.</p>

<p>How different this journey by comparison with that of a year
since, when the cave girl had been leading the terror-stricken
Waldo Emerson in flight from the bad men toward, to him, an
equally horrible fate at the hands of Korth and Flatfoot!</p>

<p>Then the forest glades echoed to the pads of fierce beasts and
the stealthy passage of naked, human horrors. No twig snapped
that did not portend instant and terrifying death.</p>

<p>Now Korth and Flatfoot were dead at the hands of the
metamorphosed Waldo. The racking cough was gone. He had
encountered the bad men and others like them and come away with
honors. Even Nagoola, the sleek, black devil-cat of the hideous
nights, no longer sent the slightest tremor through the
rehabilitated nerves.</p>

<p>Did not Thandar wear Nagoola's pelt about his shoulder and
loins&mdash;a pelt that he had taken in hand to hand encounter
with the dread beast?</p>

<p>Slowly they walked beneath the shade of giant trees, beside
pleasant streams, or, again, across open valleys where the grass
grew knee high and countless, perfumed wildflowers opened a
pathway before their naked feet.</p>

<p>At night they slept where night found them&mdash;sometimes in
the deserted lair of a wild beast, or again perched among the
branches of a spreading tree where parallel branches permitted
the construction of rude platforms.</p>

<p>And Thandar was always most solicitous to see that Nadara's
couch was of the softest grasses and that his own lay at a little
distance from hers and in a position where he might best protect
her from prowling beasts.</p>

<p>Again was Nadara puzzled, but still she made no comment.</p>

<p>Finally they came to her village.</p>

<p>Several of the younger men came forth to meet them; but when
they saw that the man was he who had slain Korth they bridled
their truculence, all but one, Big Fist, who had assumed the role
of king since Flatfoot had left.</p>

<p>"I can kill you," he announced by way of greeting, "for I am
Big Fist, and until Flatfoot returns I am king&mdash;and maybe
afterward, for some day I shall kill Flatfoot."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to fight you," replied Thandar. "Already have I
killed Korth, and Flatfoot will return no more, for Flatfoot I
have killed also. And I can kill Big Fist, but what is the use?
Why should we fight? Let us be friends, for we must live
together, and if we do not kill one another there will be more of
us to meet the bad men, should they come, and kill them."</p>

<p>When Big Fist heard that Flatfoot was dead and by the hand of
this stranger he pined less to measure his strength with that of
the newcomer. He saw the knothole that the other offered, and
promptly he sought to crawl through it, but with honor.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "I shall not kill you&mdash;you need not
be afraid. But you must know that I am king, and do as I say that
you shall do."</p>

<p>"'Afraid,'" Thandar laughed. "You may be king," he said, "but
as for doing what you say&mdash;" and again he laughed.</p>

<p>It was a very different Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones from the
thing that the sea had spewed up twelve months before.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb2" id="chb2">II. &mdash; KING THANDAR</a></h2>

<p class="first">The first thing that Thandar did after he
entered the village was to seek out Nadara's father.</p>

<p>They found the old man in the poorest and least protected cave
in the cliff side, exposed to the attack of the first prowling
carnivore, or skulking foeman.</p>

<p>He was sick, and there was none to care for him; but he did
not complain. That was the way of his people. When a man became
too old to be of service to the community it were better that he
died, and so they did nothing to delay the inevitable. When one
became an absolute burden upon his fellows it was customary to
hasten the end&mdash;a carefully delivered blow with a heavy rock
was calculated quickly to relieve the burdens of the community
and the suffering of the invalid.</p>

<p>Thandar and Nadara came in and sat down beside him. The old
fellow seemed glad to see them.</p>

<p>"I am Thandar," said the young man. "I wish to take your
daughter as my mate."</p>

<p>The old man looked at him questioningly for a moment.</p>

<p>"You have killed Korth and Flatfoot&mdash;who is to prevent
you from taking Nadara?"</p>

<p>"I wish to be joined to her with your permission and in
accordance with the marriage ceremonies of your people," said
Thandar.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," he replied at last. "There are
several fine caves that are not occupied&mdash;if you wish a
better one you have but to slay the present occupants if they do
not get out when you tell them to&mdash;but I think they will get
out when the slayer of Korth and Flatfoot tells them to."</p>

<p>"I am not worried about a cave," said Thandar. "Tell me how
men take their wives among you."</p>

<p>"If they do not come with us willingly we take them by the
hair and drag them with us," replied Nadara's father. "My mate
would not come with me," he continued, "and even after I had
caught her and dragged her to my cave she broke away and fled
from me, but again I overhauled her, for when I was young none
could run more swiftly, and this time I did what I should have
done at first&mdash;I beat her upon the head until she went to
sleep. When she awoke she was in my own cave, and it was night,
and she did not try to run away any more."</p>

<p>For a long time Thandar sat in thought. Presently he spoke
addressing Nadara.</p>

<p>"In my country we do not take our wives in any such way, nor
shall I take you thus. We must be married properly, according to
the customs and laws of civilization."</p>

<p>Nadara made no reply. To her it seemed that Thandar must care
very little for her&mdash;that was about the only explanation she
could put upon his strange behavior. It made her sad. And then
the other women would laugh at her&mdash;of that she was quite
certain, and that, too, made her feel very badly&mdash;they would
see that Thandar did not want her.</p>

<p>The old man, lying upon his scant bed of matted, filthy
grasses, had heard the conversation. He was as much at sea as
Nadara. At last he spoke&mdash;very feebly now, for rapidly he
was nearing dissolution.</p>

<p>"I am a very old man," he said to Thandar. "I have not long to
live. Before I die I should like to know that Nadara has a mate
who will protect her. I love her, though&mdash;" He
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Though what?" asked Thandar.</p>

<p>"I have never told," whispered the old fellow. "My mate would
not let me, but now that I am about to die it can do no harm.
Nadara is not my daughter."</p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Not your daughter? Then who am I?"</p>

<p>"I do not know who you are, except that you are not even of my
people. All I know I will tell you now before I die. Come close,
for my voice is dying faster than my body."</p>

<p>The young man and the girl came nearer to his side and,
squatting there, leaned close that they might catch each faintly
articulated syllable.</p>

<p>"My mate and I," commenced the old man, "were childless,
though many moons had passed since I took her to my cave. She
wanted a little one, for thus only may women have aught upon
which to lavish their love.</p>

<p>"We had been hunting together for several days alone and far
from the village, for I was a great hunter when I was
young&mdash;no greater ever lived among our people.</p>

<p>"And one day we came down to the great water, and there, a
short distance from the shore we saw a strange thing that floated
upon the surface of the water, and when it was blown closer to us
we saw that it was hollow and that in it were two people&mdash;a
man and a woman. Both appeared to be dead.</p>

<p>"Finally I waded out to meet the thing, dragging it to shore,
and there sure enough was a man and a woman, and the man was
dead&mdash;quite dead. He must have been dead for a long time;
but the woman was not dead.</p>

<p>"She was very fair though her eyes and hair were black. We
carried her ashore, and that night a little girl was born to her,
but the woman died before morning.</p>

<p>"We put her back into the strange thing that had brought
her&mdash;she and the dead man who had come with her&mdash;and
shoved them off upon the great water, where the breeze, which
runs away from the land twice each day, carried them out of
sight, nor ever did we see them again.</p>

<p>"But before we sent them off, my mate took from the body of
the woman her strange coverings and a little bag of skin which
contained many sparkling stones of different colors and metals of
yellow and white made into things the purposes of which we could
not guess.</p>

<p>"It was evident that the woman had come from a strange land,
for she and all her belongings were unlike anything that either
of us had ever seen before. She herself was different as Nadara
is different&mdash;Nadara looks as her mother looked, for Nadara
is the little babe that was born that night.</p>

<p>"We brought her back to our people after another moon, saying
that she was born to my mate; but there was one woman who knew
better, for it seemed that she had seen us when we found the
boat, having been running away from a man who wanted her as his
mate.</p>

<p>"But my mate did not want anyone to say that Nadara was not
hers, for it is a great disgrace, as you well know, for a woman
to be barren, and so she several times nearly killed this woman,
who knew the truth, to keep her from telling it to the whole
village.</p>

<p>"But I love Nadara as well as though she had been my own, and
so I should like to see her well mated before I die."</p>

<p>Thandar had gone white during the narration of the story of
Nadara's birth. He could scarce restrain an impulse to go upon
his knees and thank his God that he had harked to the call of his
civilized training rather than have given in to the easier way,
the way these primitive, beast-like people offered. Providence,
he thought, must indeed have sent him here to rescue her.</p>

<p>The old man, turning upon his rough pallet, fastened his
sunken eyes questioningly upon Thandar. Nadara, too, with parted
lips waited for him to speak. The old man gasped for
breath&mdash;there was a strange rattling sound in his
throat.</p>

<p>Thandar leaned above him, raising his head and shoulders
slightly. The young man never had heard that sound before, but
now that he heard it he needed no interpreter.</p>

<p>The locust, rubbing his legs along his wings, startles the
uninitiated into the belief that a hidden rattler lurks in the
pathway; but when the great diamondback breaks forth in warning
none mistakes him for a locust.</p>

<p>And so it is with the death rattle in the human throat.</p>

<p>Thandar knew that it was the end. He saw the old man's might
effort to push back the grim reaper that he might speak once
more. In the dying eyes were a question and a plea. Thandar could
not misunderstand.</p>

<p>He reached forward and took Nadara's hand.</p>

<p>"In my own land we shall be mated," he said. "None other shall
wed with Nadara, and as proof that she is Thandar's she shall
wear this always," and from his finger he slipped a splendid
solitaire to the third finger of Nadara's left hand.</p>

<p>The old man saw. A look of relief and contentment that was
almost a smile settled upon his features, as, with a gasping
sigh, he sank limply into Thandar's arms, dead.</p>

<p>That afternoon several of the younger men carried the body of
Nadara's foster father to the top of the cliff, depositing it
about half a mile from the caves. There was no ceremony. In it,
though, Waldo Emerson saw what might have been the first human
funeral cortege&mdash;simple, sensible and utilitarian&mdash;from
which the human race has retrograded to the ostentatious,
ridiculous, pestilent burials of present-day civilization.</p>

<p>The young men, acting under Big Fist's orders, carried the
worthless husk to a safe distance from the caves, leaving it
there to the rapid disintegration provided by the beasts and
birds of prey.</p>

<p>Nadara wept, silently. An elderly lady with a single tooth,
espying her, moaned in sympathy. Presently other females,
attracted by the moaning, joined them, and, becoming affected by
the strange hysteria to which womankind is heir, mingled their
moans with those of the toothless one.</p>

<p>Excited by their own noise they soon were shrieking and
screaming in hideous chorus. Then came Big Fist and others of the
men. The din annoyed them. They set upon the mourners with their
fists and teeth scattering them in all directions. This ended the
festivities.</p>

<p>Or would have had not Big Fist made the fatal mistake of
launching a blow on Nadara. Thandar had been standing nearby
looking with wonder upon the strange scene.</p>

<p>He had noted the quiet grief of the young girl&mdash;real
grief; and he had witnessed the hysterical variety of the
"mourners"&mdash;no sham grief. Precisely, because they made no
pretense to grief&mdash;it was noise to which they aspired. And
as the fiendish din had set his own nerves on edge he wondered
not at all that Big Fist and the other men should take steps to
quell the tumult.</p>

<p>The female half-brutes were theirs and Waldo Emerson had
reverted sufficiently to the primitive to feel no incentive to
interfere. But Nadara was not theirs&mdash;she was not of them
and even had she not belonged to him the American would have felt
bound to stand between her and the savage creatures among whom
fate had cast her.</p>

<p>That she did belong to him, however, sent him hot with the
blood lust of the killer as he sprang to intercept the rush of
Big Fist toward her.</p>

<p>Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones had learned nothing of the manly art
of self-defense in that other life that had been so zealously
guarded from the rude and vulgar. This was unfortunate since it
would have given him a great advantage over the man-brute. A
single well-timed swing to that unguarded chin would have ended
hostilities at once; but of hooks and jabs and jolts, scientific,
Thandar knew nothing.</p>

<p>Except for his crude weapons he was a primeval in battle as
his original anthropoid progenitor, and quite as often as not he
forgot all about his sword, his knife, his bow and arrows and his
spear when, half stooped, he crouched to meet the charge of a
foeman.</p>

<p>Now he sprang for Big Fist's hairy throat. There was a sullen
thud as the two bodies met, and then, rolling, biting and
tearing, they struggled hither and thither upon the rocky ground
at the base of the cliff.</p>

<p>The other men desisted from their attack upon the women. The
women ceased their vocal mourning. In a little circle they formed
about the contestants&mdash;a circle which moved this way and
that as the fighters moved, keeping them always in the
center.</p>

<p>Nadara forced her way through them to the front. She wished to
be near Thandar. In her hand she carried a jagged bit of
granite&mdash;one could never tell.</p>

<p>Big Fist was burly&mdash;mountainous&mdash;but Thandar was
muscled like Nagoola, the black panther. His movements were all
grace and ease, but oh, so irresistible. A sudden and unexpected
blow upon the side of Big Fist's head bent that bullet-shaped
thing sideward with a jerk that almost dislocated the neck.</p>

<p>Big Fist shrieked with the pain of it. Thandar, delighted by
the result of the accidental blow, repeated it. Big Fist
bellowed&mdash;agonized. He made a last supreme effort to close
with his agile foeman, and succeeded. His teeth sought Thandar's
throat, but the act brought his own jugular close to Thandar's
jaws.</p>

<p>The strong white teeth of Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones closed
upon it as naturally as though no countless ages had rolled their
snail-like way between himself and the last of his progenitors to
bury bloody fangs in the soft flesh of an antagonist.</p>

<p>Wasted ages! Fleeing from the primitive and the brute toward
the neoteric and the human&mdash;in a brief instant your labors
are undone, the veneer of eons crumbles in the heat of some
pristine passion revealing again naked and unashamed the
primitive and the brute.</p>

<p>Big Fist, white now from terror at impending death, struggled
to be free. Thandar buried his teeth more deeply. There was a
sudden rush of spurting blood that choked him. Big Fist relaxed,
inert.</p>

<p>Thandar, drenched crimson, rose to his feet. The huge body on
the ground before him floundered spasmodically once or twice as
the life blood rushed from the severed jugular. The eyes rolled
up and set, there was a final twitch and Big Fist was dead.</p>

<p>Thandar turned toward the circle of interested spectators. He
singled out a burly quartet.</p>

<p>"Bear Big Fist to the cliff top," he commanded. "When you
return we shall choose a new king."</p>

<p>The men did as they were bid. They did not at all understand
what Thandar meant about choosing a king. Having slain Big Fist,
Thandar was king, unless some ambitious one desired to dispute
his right to reign. But all had seen him slay Big Fist, and all
knew that he had killed Korth and Flatfoot, so who was there
would dare question his kingship?</p>

<p>When they had come back to the village Thandar gathered them
beneath a great tree that grew close to the base of the cliff.
Here they squatted upon their haunches in a rough circle. Behind
them stood the women and children, wide-eyed and curious.</p>

<p>"Let us choose a king," said Thandar, when all had come.</p>

<p>There was a long silence, then one of the older men spoke.</p>

<p>"I am an old man. I have seen many kings. They come by
killing. They go by killing. Thandar has killed two kings. Now he
is king. Who wishes to kill Thandar and become king?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>The old man arose.</p>

<p>"It was foolish to come here to choose a king," he said, "when
a king we already have."</p>

<p>"Wait," commanded Thandar. "Let us choose a king properly.
Because I have killed Flatfoot and Big Fist does not prove that I
can make a good king. Was Flatfoot a good king?"</p>

<p>"He was a bad man," replied the ancient one.</p>

<p>"Has a good man ever been king?" asked Thandar.</p>

<p>The old fellow puckered his brow in thought.</p>

<p>"Not for a long time."</p>

<p>"That is because you always permit a bully and a brute to rule
you," said Thandar. "That is not the proper way to choose a king.
Rather you should come together as we are come, and among you
talk over the needs of the tribe and when you are decided as to
what measures are best for the welfare of the members of the
tribe then should you select the man best fitted to carry out
your plans. That is a better way to choose a king."</p>

<p>The old man laughed.</p>

<p>"And then," he said, "would come a Big Fist or a Flatfoot and
slay our king that he might be king in his place."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a man who could slay all the other men of
the tribe at the same time?"</p>

<p>The old man looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"That is my answer to your argument," said Thandar. "Those who
choose the king can protect him from his enemies. So long as he
is a good king they should do so, but when he comes a bad king
they can then select another, and if the bad king refuses to obey
the new it would be an easy matter for several men to kill him or
drive him away, no matter how mighty a fighter he might be."</p>

<p>Several of the men nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"We had not thought of that," they said. "Thandar is indeed
wise."</p>

<p>"So now," continued the American, "let us choose a king whom
the majority of us want, and then so long as he is a good king
the majority of us must fight for him and protect him. Let us
choose a man whom we know to be a good man regardless of his
ability to kill his fellows, for if he has the majority of the
tribe to fight for him what need will he have to fight for
himself? What we want is a wise man&mdash;one who can lead the
tribe to fertile lands and good hunting, and in the time of
battle direct the fighting intelligently. Flatfoot and Big Fist
had not brains enough between them to do aught but steal the
mates of other men. Such should not be the business of kings.
Your king should protect your mates from such as Flatfoot, and he
should punish those who would steal them."</p>

<p>"But how may he do these things?" asked a young man, "if he is
not the best fighter in the tribe?"</p>

<p>"Have I not shown you how?" asked Thandar. "We who make him
king shall be his fighters&mdash;he will not need to fight with
his own hands."</p>

<p>Again there was a long silence. Then the old man spoke
again.</p>

<p>"There is wisdom in the talk of Thandar. Let us choose a king
who will have to be good to us if he wishes to remain king. It is
very bad for us to have a king whom we fear."</p>

<p>"I, for one," said the young man who had previously spoken,
"do not care to be ruled by a king unless he is able to defeat me
in battle. If I can defeat him then I should be king."</p>

<p>And so they took sides, but at last they compromised by
selecting one whom they knew to be wise and a great fighter as
well. Thus they chose Thandar king.</p>

<p>"Once each week," said the new king, "we shall gather here and
talk among ourselves of the things which are for the best good of
the tribe, and what seems best to the majority shall be done. The
tribe will tell the king what to do&mdash;the king will carry out
the work. And all must fight when the king says fight and all
must work when the king says work, for we shall all be fighting
or working for the whole tribe, and I, Thandar, your king, shall
fight and work the hardest of you all."</p>

<p>It was a new idea to them and placed the kingship in a totally
different light from any by which they had previously viewed it.
That it would take a long time for them to really absorb the idea
Thandar knew, and he was glad that in the meantime they had a
king who could command their respect according to their former
standards.</p>

<p>And he smiled when he thought of the change that had taken
place in him since first he had sat trembling, weeping and
coughing upon the lonely shore before the terrifying forest.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="chb3" id="chb3">III. &mdash; THE GREAT
NAGOOLA</a></h2>

<p class="first">Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones had gladly embraced
the opportunity which chance had offered him to assume the
kingship of the little tribe of troglodytes. First, because his
position would assure Nadara greater safety, and, second, because
of the opening it would give him for the exercise of his new-
found initiative.</p>

<p>Where before he had shrunk from responsibility he now found
himself anxious to assume it. He longed to do, where formerly he
had been content to but read of the accomplishments of
others.</p>

<p>To his chagrin, however, he soon discovered that the classical
education to which his earlier life had been devoted under the
guidance of a fond and ultra-cultured mother was to prove a most
inadequate foundation upon which to build a practical scheme of
life for himself and his people.</p>

<p>He wished to teach his tribe to construct permanent and
comfortable houses, but he could not recollect any practical
hints on carpentry that he had obtained from Ovid.</p>

<p>His people lived by hunting small rodents, robbing birds'
nests, and gathering wild fruit and vegetables. Thandar desired
to institute a scheme of community farming, but the works of the
Cyclic Poets, with which he was quite familiar, seemed to offer
little of value along agricultural lines. He regretted that he
had not matriculated at an agricultural college west of the
Alleghenies rather than at Harvard.</p>

<p>However, he determined to do the best he could with the meager
knowledge he possessed of things practical&mdash;a knowledge so
meager that it consisted almost entirely of the bare definition
of the word agriculture.</p>

<p>It was a germ, however, for it presupposed a knowledge of the
results that might be obtained through agriculture.</p>

<p>So Thandar found himself a step ahead of the earliest of his
progenitors who had thought to plant purposely the seeds that
nature heretofore had distributed haphazard through the agencies
of wind and bird and beast&mdash;but only a step ahead.</p>

<p>He realized that he occupied a very remarkable position in the
march of ages. He had known and seen and benefitted by all the
accumulated knowledge of ages of progression from the stone age
to the twentieth century, and now, suddenly, fate had snatched
him back into the stone age, or possibly a few eons farther back,
only to show him that all that he had from a knowledge of other
men's knowledge was keen dissatisfaction with the stone age.</p>

<p>He had lived in houses of wood and brick and looked through
windows of glass. He had read in the light of gas and
electricity, and he even knew of candles; but he could not
fashion the tools to build a house, he could not have made a
brick to have saved his life, glass had suddenly become one of
the wonders of the world to him, and as for gas and electricity
and candles they had become one with the mystery of the
Sphinx.</p>

<p>He could write verse in excellent Greek, but he was no longer
proud of that fact. He would much rather that he had been able to
tan a hide, or make fire without matches. Waldo Emerson Smith-
Jones had a year ago been exceedingly proud of his intellect and
his learning, but for a year his ego had been shrinking until now
he felt himself the most pitiful ignoramus on earth. "Criminally
ignorant," he said to Nadara, "for I have thrown away the
opportunities of a lifetime devoted to the accumulation of
useless erudition when I might have been profiting by the
practical knowledge which has dragged the world from the black
pit of barbarism to the light of modern achievement&mdash;I might
not only have done this but, myself, added something to the glory
and welfare of mankind. I am no good, Nadara&mdash;worse than
useless."</p>

<p>The girl touched his strong brown hand caressingly, looking
proudly into his eyes.</p>

<p>"To me you are very wonderful, Thandar," she said. "With your
own hands you slew Nagoola, the most terrible beast in the world,
and Korth, and Flatfoot, and Big Fist lie dead beneath the
vultures because of your might&mdash;single-handed you killed
them all; three awesome men. No, my Thandar is greater than all
other men."</p>

<p>Nor could Waldo Emerson repress the swelling tide of pride
that surged through him as the girl he loved recounted his
exploits. No longer did he think of his achievements as "vulgar
physical prowess." The old Waldo Emerson, whose temperature had
risen regularly at three o'clock each afternoon, whose pitifully
skinny body had been racked by coughing continually, whose eyes
had been terror-filled by day and night at the rustling of dry
leaves, was dead.</p>

<p>In his place stood a great, full-blooded man, brown skinned
and steel thewed; fearless, self-reliant, almost brutal in his
pride of power&mdash;Thandar, the cave man.</p>

<p>The months that passed as Thandar led his people from one
honeycombed cliff to another as he sought a fitting place for a
permanent village were filled with happiness for Nadara and the
king.</p>

<p>The girl's happiness was slightly allayed by the fact that
Thandar failed to claim her as his own. She could not yet quite
understand the ethics which separated them. Thandar tried
repeatedly to explain to her that some day they were to return to
his own world, and that that world would not accept her unless
she had been joined to him according to the rites and ceremonies
which it had originated.</p>

<p>"Will this marriage ceremony of which you tell me make you
love me more?" asked Nadara.</p>

<p>Thandar laughed and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>"I could not love you more," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then of what good is it?"</p>

<p>Thandar shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to explain," he said, "especially to such a
lovable little pagan as my Nadara. You must be satisfied to
know&mdash;accept my word for it&mdash;that it is because I love
you that we must wait."</p>

<p>Now it was the girl's turn to shake her head.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand," she said. "My people take their mates
as they will and they are satisfied and everybody is satisfied
and all is well; but their king, who may mate as he chooses,
waits until a man whom he does not know and who lives across the
great water where we may never go, gives him permission to mate
with one who loves him&mdash;with one whom he SAYS he loves."</p>

<p>Thandar noticed the emphasis which Nadara put upon the word
"says."</p>

<p>"Some day," he said, "when we have reached my world you will
know that I was right, and you will thank me. Until then, Nadara,
you must trust me, and," he added half to himself, "God knows I
have earned your trust even if you do not know it."</p>

<p>And so Nadara made believe that she was satisfied but in her
heart of hearts she still feared that Thandar did not really love
her, nor did the half-veiled comments of the women add at all to
her peace of mind.</p>

<p>During all the time that Thandar was with her he had been
teaching her his language for he had set his heart upon taking
her home, and he wished her to be as well prepared for her
introduction to Boston and civilization as he could make her.</p>

<p>Thandar's plan was to find a suitable location within sight of
the sea that he might always be upon the lookout for a ship. At
last he found such a place&mdash;a level meadow land upon a low
plateau overlooking the ocean.</p>

<p>He had come upon it while he wandered alone several miles from
the temporary cliff dwellings the tribe was occupying. The soil,
when he dug into it, he found to be rich and black. There was
timber upon one side and upon the other overhanging cliffs of
soft limestone.</p>

<p>It was Thandar's plan to build a village partly of logs
against the face of the cliff, burrowing inward behind the
dwellings for such additional apartments as each family might
require.</p>

<p>The caves alone would have proved sufficient shelter, but the
man hoped by compelling his people to construct a portion of each
dwelling of logs to engender within each family a certain feeling
of ownership and pride in personal possession as would make it
less easy for them to give up their abodes than in the past, when
it had been necessary but to move to another cliff to find caves
equally as comfortable as those which they had so easily
abandoned.</p>

<p>In other words he hoped to give them a word which their
vocabulary had never held&mdash;home.</p>

<p>Whether or not he would have succeeded we may never know, for
fate stepped in at the last moment to alter with a single stroke
his every plan and aspiration.</p>

<p>As he returned to his people that afternoon filled with the
enthusiasm of his hopes a burly, hairy figure crept warily close
to him. As Thandar emerged from the brush which reached close to
the cliffs where the temporary encampment had been made, Nadara,
watching for him, ran forward to meet him.</p>

<p>The creature upon Thandar's trail halted at the edge of the
bush. As his close-set eyes fell upon the girl his flabby lips
vibrated to the quick intaking of his breath and his red lids
half-closed in cunning and desire.</p>

<p>For a few moments he watched the man and the maid as they
turned and walked slowly toward the cliffs, the arm of the former
about the brown shoulders of the latter. Then he too turned and
melted into the tangled branches behind him.</p>

<p>That evening Thandar gathered the members of the tribe about
him at the foot of the cliff. They sat around a great fire while
Thandar, their king, explained to them in minutest detail the
future that he had mapped out for them.</p>

<p>Some of the old men shook their heads, for here was an unheard
of thing&mdash;a change from the accustomed ordering of their
lives&mdash;and they were loath to change regardless of the
benefits which might accrue.</p>

<p>But for the most part the people welcomed the idea of
comfortable and permanent habitations, though their anticipatory
joy, Thandar reasoned, was due largely to a childish eagerness
for something new and different&mdash;whether their enthusiasm
would survive the additional labors which the new life was sure
to entail was another question.</p>

<p>So Thandar laid down the new laws that were to guide his
people thereafter. The men were to make all implements and
weapons, for he had already taught them to use arrows and spears.
The women were to keep all edged tools sharp. The men were to hew
the logs and build the houses&mdash;the women make garments, cook
and keep the houses in order.</p>

<p>The men were to turn up the soil, the women were to sow the
seeds, and cultivate the growing crops, which later, all hands
must turn to and harvest.</p>

<p>The hunting and fighting devolved upon the men, but the
fighting must be confined to enemies of the tribe. A man who
killed another member of the tribe except in defense of his home
or his own person was to suffer death.</p>

<p>Other laws he made&mdash;good laws&mdash;which even these
primitive people could see were good. It was quite late when the
last of them crawled into his comfortless cave to dream of large
airy rooms built of the trees of the forest; of good food in
plenty just before the rains as well as after; of security from
the periodic raids of the "bad men."</p>

<p>Thandar and Nadara were the last to go. Together they sat upon
a narrow ledge before Nadara's cave, the moonlight falling upon
their glistening, naked shoulders, while they talked and dreamed
together of the future.</p>

<p>Thandar had been talking of the wonderful plans which seemed
to fill his whole mind&mdash;of the future of the tribe&mdash;of
the great strides toward civilization they could make in a few
brief years if they could but be made to follow the simple plans
he had in mind.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "in ten years they should have bridged a gulf
that it must have required ages for our ancestors to span."</p>

<p>"And you are planning ten years ahead, Thandar," she asked,
"when only yesterday you were saying that once beside the sea you
hoped it would be but a short time before we might sight a
passing vessel that would bear us away to your civilization? Must
we wait ten years, Thandar?"</p>

<p>"I am planning for them," he replied. "We may not be here to
witness the changes; but I wish to start them upon the road and
when we go I shall see to it that a king is chosen in my place
who has the courage and the desire to carry out my plans.</p>

<p>"Yet," he added, musingly, "it would be splendid could we but
return to complete our work. Never, Nadara, have I performed a
single constructive act for the benefit of my fellow man, but now
I see an opportunity to do something, however small it may be,
to&mdash;what was that?"</p>

<p>A low rumbling muttered threateningly out of the west. Deep
and ominous it sounded, yet so low that it failed to awaken any
member of the sleeping tribe.</p>

<p>Before either could again speak there came a slight trembling
of the earth beneath them, scarcely sufficient to have been
noticeable had it not been preceded by the distant grumbling in
the earth's bowels.</p>

<p>The two upon the moonlit ledge came to their feet, and Nadara
drew close to Thandar, the man's arm encircling her shoulders
protectingly.</p>

<p>"The Great Nagoola," she whispered. "Again he seeks to
escape."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Thandar. "It is an
earthquake&mdash;distant and quite harmless to us."</p>

<p>"No, it is The Great Nagoola," insisted Nadara. "Long time
ago, when our fathers' fathers were yet unborn, The Great Nagoola
roamed the land devouring all that chanced to come in his
way&mdash;men, beasts, birds, everything.</p>

<p>"One day my people came upon him sleeping in a deep gorge
between two mountains. They were mighty men in those days, and
when they saw their great enemy asleep there in the gorge half of
them went upon one side and half upon the other, and they pushed
the two mountains over into the gorge upon the sleeping beast,
imprisoning him there.</p>

<p>"It is all true, for my mother had it from her mother, who in
turn was told it by her mother&mdash;thus has it been handed down
truthfully since it happened long time ago.</p>

<p>"And even in this day is occasionally heard the growling of
The Great Nagoola in his anger, and the earth shakes and trembles
as he strives, far, far beneath to shake the mountains from him
and escape. Did you not hear his voice and feel the ground
rock?"</p>

<p>Thandar laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, we're quite safe then," he cried, "for with two
mountains piled upon him he cannot escape."</p>

<p>"Who knows?" asked Nadara. "He is huge&mdash;huge, himself, as
a small mountain. Some day, they say, he will escape, and then
naught will pacify his rage until he has destroyed every living
creature upon the land."</p>

<p>"Do not worry, little one," said Thandar. "The Great Nagoola
will have to grumble louder and struggle more fiercely before
ever he may dislodge the two mountains. Even now he is quiet
again, so run to your cave, sweetheart, nor bother your pretty
head with useless worries&mdash;it is time that all good people
were asleep," and he stooped and kissed her as she turned to
go.</p>

<p>For a moment she clung to him.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Thandar," she whispered. "Why, I do not know. I
only know that I am afraid, with a great fear that will not be
quiet."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb4" id="chb4">IV. &mdash; THE BATTLE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Early the following morning while several of the
women and children were at the river drawing water the balance of
the tribe of Thandar was startled into wakefulness by piercing
shrieks from the direction the water carriers had taken.</p>

<p>Before the great, hairy men, led by the smooth-skinned
Thandar, had reached the foot of the cliff in their rush to the
rescue of the women several of the latter appeared at the edge of
the forest, running swiftly toward the caves.</p>

<p>Mingled with their screams of terror were cries of "The bad
men! The bad men!" But these were not needed to acquaint the
rescuers with the cause of the commotion, for at the heels of the
women came Thurg and a score of his vicious brutes. Little better
than anthropoid apes were they. Long armed, hairy, skulking
monsters, whose close-set eyes and retreating foreheads
proclaimed more intimate propinquity to the higher orders of
brutes than to civilized man.</p>

<p>Woe betide male or female who fell into their remorseless
clutches, since to the base passions, unrestrained, that mark the
primordial they were addicted to the foulest forms of
cannibalism.</p>

<p>In the past their raids upon their neighbors for meat and
women had met with but slight resistance&mdash;the terrified cave
dwellers scampering to the safety of their dizzy ledges from
which they might hurl stones and roll boulders down to the
confusion of any foe however ferocious.</p>

<p>Always the bad men caught a few unwary victims before the
safety of the ledges could be attained, but this time there was a
difference. Thurg was delighted. The men were rushing downward to
meet him&mdash;great indeed would be the feast which should
follow this day's fighting, for with the men disposed of there
would be but little difficulty in storming the cliff and carrying
off all the women and children, and as he thought upon these
things there floated in his little brain the image of the
beautiful girl he had watched come down the evening before from
the caves to meet the smooth-skinned warrior who trice now had
bested Thurg in battle.</p>

<p>That Thandar's men might turn the tables upon him never for a
moment occurred to Thurg. Nor was there little wonder, since,
mighty as were the muscles of the cave men, they were weaklings
by comparison with the half-brutes of Thurg&mdash;only the
smooth-skinned stranger troubled the muddy mind of the near-
man.</p>

<p>It puzzled him a little, though, to see the long slim sticks
that the enemy carried, and the little slivers in skin bags upon
their backs, and the strange curved branches whose ends were
connected by slender bits of gut. What were these things for?</p>

<p>Soon he was to know&mdash;this and other things.</p>

<p>Thandar's warriors did not rush upon Thurg and his brutes in a
close packed, yelling mob. Instead they trotted slowly forward in
a long thin line that stretched out parallel with the base of the
cliff. In the center, directly in front of the charging bad men,
was Thandar, calling directions to his people, first upon one
hand and then upon the other.</p>

<p>And in accordance with his commands the ends of the line began
to quicken the pace, so that quickly Thurg saw that there were
men before him, and men upon either hand, and now, at fifty feet,
while all were advancing cautiously, crouched for the final hand-
to-hand encounter, he saw the enemy slip each sliver into the gut
of the bent branches&mdash;there was a sudden chorus of twangs
and Thurg felt a sharp pain in his neck. Involuntarily he clapped
his hand to the spot to find one of the slivers sticking there,
scarce an inch from his jugular.</p>

<p>With a howl of rage he snatched the thing from him, and as he
leaped to charge to punish these audacious madmen he noted a
dozen of his henchmen plucking slivers from various portions of
their bodies, while two lay quite still upon the grass with just
the end of slivers protruding from their breasts.</p>

<p>The sight brought the beast-man to a momentary halt. He saw
his fellows charging in upon the foe&mdash;he saw another volley
of slivers speed from the bent branches. Down went another of his
fighters, and then the enemy cast aside their strange weapons at
a shouted command from the smooth-skinned one and grasping their
long, slim stick ran forward to meet Thurg's people.</p>

<p>Thurg smiled. It would soon be over now. He turned toward one
who was bearing down upon him&mdash;it was Thandar. Thurg
crouched to meet the charge. Rage, revenge, the lust for blood
fired his bestial brain. With his huge paws he would tear the
puny stick from this creature's grasp, and this time he would
gain his hold upon that smooth throat. He licked his lips. And
then out of the corner of his eyes he glanced to the right.</p>

<p>What strange sight was this! His people flying? It was
incredible! And yet it was true. Growling and raging in pain and
anger, they were running a gauntlet of fire-sharpened lances.
Three lay dead. The others were streaming blood as they fled
before the relentless prodding devils at their backs.</p>

<p>It was enough for Thurg. He did not wait to close with
Thandar. A single howl of dismay broke from his flabby lips, and
then he wheeled and dashed for the wood. He was the last to pass
through the rapidly converging ends of Thandar's primitive battle
line. He was running so fast that, afterward, Nadara who was
watching the battle from the cliff-side insisted that his feet
flew higher than his head at each frantic leap.</p>

<p>Thandar and his victorious army pursued the enemy through the
wood for a mile or more, then they returned laughing and
shouting, to receive the plaudits of the old men, the women and
the children.</p>

<p>It was a happy day. There was feasting. And Thandar, having in
mind things he had read of savage races, improvised a dance in
honor of the victory.</p>

<p>He knew little more of savage dances than his tribesmen did of
the two-step and the waltz; but he knew that dancing and song and
play marked in themselves a great step upward in the evolution of
man from the lower orders, and so he meant to teach these things
to his people.</p>

<p>A red flush spread to his temples as he thought of his
dignified father and his stately mother and with what horrified
emotions they would view him now could they but see
him&mdash;naked but for a g-string and a panther skin, moving
with leaps and bounds, and not stately waltz steps in a great
circle, clapping his hands in time to his movements, while behind
him strung a score of lusty, naked warriors, mimicking his every
antic with the fidelity of apes.</p>

<p>About them squatted the balance of the tribe more intensely
interested in this, the first ceremonial function of their lives,
than with any other occurrence that had ever befallen them. They,
too, now clapped their hands in time with the dancers.</p>

<p>Nadara stood with parted lips and wide eyes watching the
strange scene. Within her it seemed that something was struggling
for expression&mdash;something that she must have known long,
long ago&mdash;something that she had forgotten but that she
presently must recall. With it came an insistent urge&mdash;her
feet could scarce remain quietly upon the ground, and great waves
of melody and song welled into her heart and throat, though what
they were and what they meant she did not know.</p>

<p>She only knew that she was intensely excited and happy and
that her whole being seemed as light and airy as the soft wind
that blew across the swaying treetops of the forest.</p>

<p>Now the dance was done. Thandar had led the warriors back to
the feast. In the center of the circle where the naked bodies of
the men had leaped and swirled to the clapping of many hands was
an open space, deserted. Into it Nadara ran, drawn by some subtle
excitement of the soul which she could not have fathomed had she
tried&mdash;which she did not try to fathom.</p>

<p>Around her slim, graceful figure was draped the glossy black
pelt of Nagoola&mdash;another trophy of the prowess of her man.
It half-concealed but to accentuate the beauties of her form.</p>

<p>With eyes half-closed she took a half-dozen graceful,
tentative steps. Now the eyes of Thandar and several others were
upon her, but she did not see them. Suddenly, with outthrown
arms, she commenced to dance, bending her lithe body, swaying
from side to side as she fell, with graceful abandon, into steps
and poses that seemed as natural to her as repose.</p>

<p>About the little circle she wove her simple yet intricate way,
and now every eye was upon her as every savage heart leaped in
unison with her shapely feet, rising and falling in harmony with
her lithe, brown limbs.</p>

<p>And of all the hearts that leaped, fastest leaped the heart of
Thandar, for he saw in the poetry of motion of the untutored girl
the proof of her birthright&mdash;the truth of all that he had
guessed of her origin since her foster father had related the
story of her birth upon his death bed. None but a child of an
age-old culture could possess this inherent talent. Any moment he
expected her lips to break forth in song, nor was he to be
disappointed, for presently, as the circling cave folk commended
to clap their palms in time to her steps, Nadara lifted her voice
in clear and bird-like notes&mdash;a wordless paean of love and
life and happiness.</p>

<p>At last, exhausted, she paused, and as her eyes fell upon
Thandar they broke into a merry laugh.</p>

<p>"The king is not the only one who can leap and play upon his
feet," she cried.</p>

<p>Thandar came to the center of the circle and kneeling at her
feet took one of her hands in his and kissed it.</p>

<p>"The king is only mortal and a man," he said. "It is no
reproach that he cannot equal the divine grace of a goddess. You
are very wonderful, my Nadara," he continued, "from loving you I
am coming to worship you."</p>

<p>And within the deep and silent wood another was stirred with
mighty emotions by the sight of the half-naked, graceful girl. It
was Thurg, the bad man, who had sneaked back alone to the edge of
the forest that he might seek an opportunity to be revenged upon
Thandar and his people.</p>

<p>Half-formed in his evil brain had been a certain plan, which
the sight of Nadara, dancing in the firelight, had turned to
concrete resolution.</p>

<p>With the dancing and the feasting over, the tribe of Thandar
betook itself by ones and twos to the rocky caves that they
expected so soon to desert for the more comfortable village which
they were to build under the direction of their king, to the
east, beside the great water.</p>

<p>At last all was still&mdash;the village slept. No sentry
guarded their slumbers, for Thandar, steeped in book learning,
must needs add to his stock of practical knowledge by bitter
experience, and never yet had the cause arisen for a night guard
about his village.</p>

<p>Having defeated Thurg and his people he thought that they
would not return again, and certainly not by night for the people
of this wild island roamed seldom by night, having too much
respect for the teeth and talons of Nagoola to venture forth
after darkness had settled upon the grim forests and lonely
plains.</p>

<p>But a tempest of uncontrolled emotions surged through the
hairy breast of Thurg. He forgot Nagoola. He thought only of
revenge&mdash;revenge and the black haired beauty who had so many
times eluded him.</p>

<p>And as he saw her dancing in the circle of hand-clapping
tribesmen, in the light of the brush wood fire, his desire for
her became a veritable frenzy.</p>

<p>He could scarce restrain himself from rushing single-handed
among his foes and snatching the girl before their faces.
However, caution came to his rescue, and so he waited, albeit
impatiently, until the last of the cave folk had retired to his
cavern.</p>

<p>He had seen into which cave Nadara had withdrawn&mdash;one
that lay far up the face of the steep cliff and directly above
the cave occupied by Thandar. The moon was overcast, the fire at
the foot of the cliff had died to glowing embers, all was wrapped
in darkness and in shadow. Far in the depths of the wood Nagoola
coughed and cried. The weird sound raised the coarse hair at the
nape of Thurg's bull neck. He cast an apprehensive backward
glance, then, crouching low, he moved quickly and silently across
the clearing toward the base of the cliff.</p>

<p>Flattened against a protruding boulder, there he waited,
listening, for a moment. No sound broke the stillness of the
sleeping village. None had seen his approach&mdash;of that he was
convinced.</p>

<p>Carefully he began the ascent of the cliff face, made
difficult by the removal of the rough ladders that led from ledge
to ledge by day, but which were withdrawn with the retiring of
the community to their dark holes.</p>

<p>But Thurg had dragged with him from the forest a slim sapling.
This he leaned against the face of the cliff. Its up-tilted end
just topped the lowest ledge.</p>

<p>Thurg was almost as large and quite as clumsy in appearance as
a gorilla, yet he was not as far removed from his true arboreal
ancestors as is the great simian, and so he accomplished in
silence and with evident ease what his great bulk might have
seemed to have relegated to the impossible.</p>

<p>Like a huge cat he scrambled up the frail pole until his
fingers clutched the ledge edge above him. Ape-like he drew
himself to a squatting position there. Then he groped for the
ladder that the cave folk had drawn up from below.</p>

<p>This he erected to the next ledge above. Thereafter the way
was easy, for the balance of the ledges were connected by steeply
inclined trails cut into the cliff face. This had been an
innovation of Thandar's who considered the rickety ladders not
only a nuisance, but extremely dangerous to life and limb, for
scarce a day passed that some child or woman did not receive a
bad fall because of them.</p>

<p>So Thurg, with Thandar's unintentional aid, came easily to the
mouth of Nadara's cave.</p>

<p>Great had been the temptation as he passed the cave below to
enter and slay his enemy. Never had Thurg so hated any creature
as he hated this smooth-skinned interloper&mdash;with all the
venom of his mean soul he hated him.</p>

<p>Now he stooped, listening, just inside the entrance of the
cave. He could hear the regular breathing of the girl within. The
hot blood surged through his brute veins. His huge paws opened
and closed spasmodically. His breath sucked hot between his
flabby lips.</p>

<p>Just beneath him Thandar lay dreaming. He saw a wonderful
vision of a beautiful nymph dancing in the firelight. In a circle
about her sat the Smith-Joneses, the Percy Standishes, the
Livingston-Browns, the Quincy Adams-Cootses, and a hundred more
equally aristocratic families of Boston.</p>

<p>It did not seem strange to Thandar that there was not enough
clothing among the entire assemblage to have decently draped the
Laocoon. His father wore a becoming loin cloth, while the stately
Mrs. John Alden Smith-Jones, his mother, was tastefully arrayed
in a scant robe of the skins of small rodents sewn together with
bits of gut.</p>

<p>As the nymph danced the audience kept time to her steps with
loudly clapping palms, and when she was done they approached her
one by one, crawling upon their hands and knees, and kissed her
hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw that the nymph was Nadara, and as he sprang
forward to claim her a large man with a coarse matted beard, a
slanted forehead, and close-set eyes, leaped out from among the
others, seized Nadara and fled with her toward a waiting trolley
car.</p>

<p>He recognized the man as Thurg, and even in his dream it
seemed rather incongruous that he could be clothed in well-
fitting evening clothes.</p>

<p>Nadara screamed once, and the scream roused Thandar from his
dream. Raising upon one elbow he looked toward the entrance of
his cave. The recollection of the dream swept back into his
memory. With a little sigh of relief that it had been but a
dream, he settled back once more upon his bed of grasses, and
soon was wrapped in dreamless slumber.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb5" id="chb5">V. &mdash; THE ABDUCTION OF
NADARA</a></h2>

<p class="first">Cautiously Thurg crawled into the cave where
Nadara slept upon her couch of soft grasses, wrapped in the
glossy pelt of Nagoola, the black panther.</p>

<p>The hulking form of the beast-man blotted out the faint light
that filtered from the lesser darkness of the night without
through the jagged entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>All within was in Stygian gloom.</p>

<p>Groping with his hands Thurg came at last upon a corner of the
grassy pallet. Softly he wormed inch by inch closer to the
sleeper. Now his fingers felt the thick fur of the panther
skin.</p>

<p>Lightly, for so gross a thing, his touch followed the
recumbent figure of the girl until his giant paws felt the silky
luxuriance of her raven hair.</p>

<p>For an instant he paused. Then, quickly and silently, one
great palm clapped roughly over Nadara's mouth, while the other
arm encircled her waist, lifting her from her bed.</p>

<p>Awakened and terrified, Nadara struggled to free herself and
to scream; but the giant hand across her mouth effectually sealed
her lips, while the arm about her waist held her as firmly as
might iron bands.</p>

<p>Thurg spoke no word, but as Nadara's hands came in contact
with his hairy breast and matted beard as she fought for freedom
she guessed the identity of her abductor, and shuddered.</p>

<p>Waiting only to assure himself that his hold upon his prisoner
was secure and that no trailing end of her robe might trip him in
his flight down the cliff face, Thurg commenced the descent.</p>

<p>Opposite the entrance to Thandar's cave Nadara redoubled her
efforts to free her mouth that she might scream aloud but once.
Thurg, guessing her desire, pressed his palm the tighter, and in
a moment the two had passed unnoticed to the ledge below.</p>

<p>Down the winding trail of the upper ledges Thurg's task was
comparatively easy&mdash;thanks to Thandar, but at the second
ledge from the bottom of the cliff he was compelled to take to
the upper of the two ladders which completed the way to the
ground below.</p>

<p>And here it was necessary to remove his hand from Nadara's
mouth. In a low growl he warned her to silence with threats of
instant death, then he removed his hand from across her face,
grasped the top of the ladder and swung over the dangerous height
with his burden under his arm.</p>

<p>For an instant Nadara was too paralyzed with terror to take
advantage of her opportunity, but just as Thurg set foot upon the
ledge at the bottom of the ladder she screamed aloud once.</p>

<p>Instantly Thurg's hand fell roughly across her lips. Brutally
he shook her, squeezing her body in his mighty grip until she
gasped for breath, and each minute expected to feel her ribs snap
to the terrific strain.</p>

<p>For a moment Thurg stood silently upon the ledge, compressing
the tortured body of his victim and listening for signs of
pursuit from above.</p>

<p>Presently the agony of her suffering overcame Nadara&mdash;she
swooned. Thurg felt her form relax, and his flabby lips twisted
to a hideous grin.</p>

<p>The cliff was quiet&mdash;the girl's scream had not disturbed
the slumbers of her tribesmen. Thurg swung the ladder he had just
descended over the edge of the cliff below, and a moment later he
stood at the bottom with his burden.</p>

<p>Without noise he removed the ladder and the sapling that he
had used in his ascent, laying them upon the ground at the foot
of the cliff. This would halt, temporarily, any pursuit until the
cave men could bring other ladders from the higher levels, where
they doubtless had them hidden.</p>

<p>But no pursuit developed, and Thurg disappeared into the dark
forest with his prize.</p>

<p>For a long distance he carried her, his little pig eyes
searching and straining to right and left into the black night
for the first sign of savage beast. The half-atrophied muscles of
his little ears, still responding to an almost dead instinct,
strove to prick those misshapen members forward that they might
catch the first crackling of dead leaves beneath the padded paw
of the fanged night prowlers.</p>

<p>But the wood seemed dead. No living creature appeared to
thwart the beast-man's evil intent. Far behind him Thandar slept.
Thurg grinned.</p>

<p>The moon broke through the clouds, splotching the ground all
silver-green beneath the forest trees. Nadara awoke from her
swoon. They were in a little open glade. Instantly she recalled
the happenings that had immediately preceded her unconsciousness.
In the moonlight she recognized Thurg. He was smirking horribly
down into her upturned face.</p>

<p>Thandar had often talked with her of religion. He had taught
her of his God, and now the girl thanked Him that Thurg was still
too low in the scale of evolution to have learned to kiss. To
have had that matted beard, those flabby, pendulous lips pressed
to hers! It was too horrible&mdash;she closed her eyes in
disgust.</p>

<p>Thurg lowered her to her feet. With one hand he still clutched
her shoulder. She saw him standing there before her&mdash;his
greedy, blood-shot eyes devouring her. His awful lips shook and
trembled as his hot breath sucked quickly in and out in excited
gasps.</p>

<p>She knew that the end was coming. Frantically she cast about
her for some means of defense or escape. Thurg was drawing her
toward him.</p>

<p>Suddenly she drew back her clenched fist and struck him full
in the mouth, then, tearing herself from his grasp, she turned
and fled.</p>

<p>But in a moment he was upon her. Seizing her roughly by the
shoulders he shook her viciously, hurling her to the ground.</p>

<p>The blood from his wounded lips dropped upon her face and
throat.</p>

<p>From the distance came a deep toned, thunderous rumbling.
Thurg raised his head and listened. Again and again came that
awesome sound.</p>

<p>"The Great Nagoola is coming to punish you," whispered
Nadara.</p>

<p>Thurg still remained squatting beside her. She had ceased to
fight for now she felt that a greater power than hers was
intervening to save her.</p>

<p>The ground beneath them trembled, shook and then tossed
frightfully. The rumbling and the roaring became deafening.
Thurg, his passion frozen in the face of this new terror, rose to
his feet. For a moment there was a lull, then came another and
more terrific shock.</p>

<p>The earth rose and fell sickeningly. Fissures opened,
engulfing trees, and then closed like hungry mouths gulping food
long denied.</p>

<p>Thurg was thrown to the ground. Now he was terror stricken. He
screamed aloud in his fear.</p>

<p>Again there came a lull, and this time the beast-man leaped to
his feet and dashed away into the forest. Nadara was alone.</p>

<p>Presently the earth commenced to tremble again, and the voice
of The Great Nagoola rumbled across the world. Frightened animals
scampered past Nadara, fleeing in all directions. Little deer,
foxes, squirrels and other rodents in countless numbers scurried,
terrified, about.</p>

<p>A great black panther and his mate trotted shoulder to
shoulder into the glade where Nadara still stood, too bewildered
to know which way to fly.</p>

<p>They eyed her for a moment, as they paused in the moonlight,
then without a second glance they loped away into the brush.
Directly behind them came three deer.</p>

<p>Nadara realized that she had felt no fear of the panthers as
she would have under ordinary circumstances. Even the little deer
ran with their natural enemies. Every lesser fear was submerged
in the overwhelming terror of the earthquake.</p>

<p>Dawn was breaking in the east. The rumblings were diminishing.
The tremors were at greater intervals and of lessening
violence.</p>

<p>Nadara started to retrace her steps toward the village.
Momentarily she looked to see Thandar coming in search of her,
but she came to the edge of the forest and no sign of Thandar or
another of her tribesmen had come to cheer her.</p>

<p>At last she stepped into the open. Before her was the cliff. A
cry of anguish broke from her lips at the sight that met her
eyes. Torn, tortured and crumpled were the lofty crags that had
been her home&mdash;the home of the tribe of Thandar.</p>

<p>The overhanging cliff top had broken away and lay piled in a
jagged heap at the foot of the cliff. The caves had disappeared.
The ledges had crumbled before the titanic struggles of The Great
Nagoola. All was desolation and ruin.</p>

<p>She approached more closely. Here and there in the awful
jumble of shattered rock were wedged the crushed and mangled
forms of men, women and children.</p>

<p>Tears coursed down Nadara's cheeks. Sobs wracked her slender
figure. And Thandar! Where was he?</p>

<p>With utmost difficulty the girl picked her way aloft over the
tumbled debris. She could only guess at the former location of
Thandar's cave, but now no sign of cave remained&mdash;only the
same blank waste of silent stone.</p>

<p>Frantically she tugged and tore at massive heaps of sharp
edged rock. Her fingers were cut and bruised and bleeding. She
called aloud the name of her man, but there was no response.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon before, weak and exhausted, she
gave up her futile search. That night she slept in a crevice
between two broken boulders, and the next morning she set out in
search of a cave where she might live out the remainder of her
lonely life in what safety and meager comfort a lone girl could
wring from this savage world.</p>

<p>For a week she wandered hither and thither only to find most
of the caves she had known in the past demolished as had been
those of her people.</p>

<p>At last she stumbled upon the very cliff which Thandar had
chosen as the permanent home of his people. Here the wrath of the
earthquake seemed to have been less severe, and Nadara found,
high in the cliff's face, a safe and comfortable cavern.</p>

<p>The last span to it required the use of a slender sapling,
which she could draw up after her, effectually barring the
approach of Nagoola and his people. To further protect herself
against the chance of wandering men the girl carried a quantity
of small bits of rock to the ledge beside the entrance to her
cave.</p>

<p>Fruit and nuts and vegetables she took there too, and a great
gourd of water from the spring below. As she completed her last
trip, and sat resting upon the ledge, her eyes wandering over the
landscape and out across the distant ocean, she thought she saw
something move in the shadow of the trees across the open plain
beneath her.</p>

<p>Could it have been a man? Nadara drew her sapling ladder to
the ledge beside her.</p>

<p><br> Thurg, fleeing from the wrath of The Great Nagoola, had
come at daybreak to the spot where his people had been camped,
but there he found no sign of them, only the ragged edges of a
great fissure, half-closed, that might have swallowed his entire
tribe as he had seen the fissures in the forest swallow many,
many trees at a single bite.</p>

<p>For some time he sought for signs of his tribesmen, but
without success. Then, his fear of the earthquake allayed, he
started back into the forest to find the girl. For days he sought
her. He came to the ruins of the cliff that had housed her
people, and there he discovered signs that the girl had been
there since the demolition of the cliff.</p>

<p>He saw the print of her dainty foot in the soft earth at the
base of the rocks&mdash;he saw how she had searched the debris
for Thandar&mdash;he saw her bed of grasses in the crevice
between two boulders, and then, after diligent search, he found
her spoor leading away to the east.</p>

<p>For many days he followed her until, at last, close by the
sea, he came to a level plain at the edge of a forest. Across the
narrow plain rose lofty hills&mdash;and what was that clambering
aloft toward the dark mouth of a cave?</p>

<p>Could it be the woman? Thurg's eyes narrowed as he peered
intently toward the cliff. Yes, it was a woman&mdash;it was THE
woman&mdash;it was she he sought, and, she was alone.</p>

<p>With a whoop of exultation Thurg broke from the forest into
the plain, running swiftly toward the cliff where Nadara crouched
beside her little pile of jagged missiles, prepared to once more
battle with this hideous monster for more than life.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb6" id="chb6">VI. &mdash; THE SEARCH</a></h2>

<p class="first">A year had elapsed since Waldo Emerson Smith-
Jones had departed from the Back Bay home of his aristocratic
parents to seek in a long sea voyage a cure for the hacking cough
and hectic cheeks which had in themselves proclaimed the almost
incurable.</p>

<p>Two months later had come the first meager press notices of
the narrow escape of the steamer, upon which Waldo Emerson had
been touring the south seas, from utter destruction by a huge
tidal wave. The dispatch read:</p><br>

<p class="quote">The captain reports that the great wave
swept entirely over the steamer, momentarily submerging her. Two
members of the crew, the officer upon the bridge, and one
passenger were washed away.</p>

<p class="quote">The latter was an American traveling for his
health, Waldo E. Smith-Jones, son of John Alden Smith-Jones of
Boston.</p>

<p class="quote">The steamer came about, cruising back and
forth for some time, but as the wave had washed her perilously
close to a dangerous shore, it seemed unsafe to remain longer in
the vicinity, for fear of a recurrence of the tidal wave which
would have meant the utter annihilation of the vessel upon the
nearby beach.</p>

<p class="quote">No sign of any of the poor unfortunates was
seen.</p>

<p class="quote">Mrs. Smith-Jones is prostrated.</p>

<p><br>Immediately John Alden Smith-Jones had fitted out his
yacht, <i>Priscilla</i>, despatching her under Captain
Burlinghame, a retired naval officer, and an old friend of Mr.
Smith-Jones, to the far distant coast in search of the body of
his son, which the captain of the steamer was of the opinion
might very possibly have been washed upon the beach.</p>

<p>And now Burlinghame was back to report the failure of his
mission. The two men were sitting in the John Alden Smith-Jones
library. Mrs. Smith-Jones was with them.</p>

<p>"We searched the beach diligently at the point opposite which
the tidal wave struck the steamer," Captain Burlinghame was
saying. "For miles up and down the coast we patrolled every inch
of the sand."</p>

<p>"We found, at one spot upon the edge of the jungle and above
the beach, the body of one of the sailors. It was not and could
not have been Waldo's. The clothing was that of a seaman, the
frame was much shorter and stockier than your son's. There was no
sign of any other body along that entire coast.</p>

<p>"Thinking it possible one of the men might have been washed
ashore alive we sent parties into the interior. Here we found a
wild and savage country, and on two occasions met with fierce,
white savages, who hurled rocks at us and fled at the first
report of our firearms.</p>

<p>"We continued our search all around the island, which is of
considerable extent. Upon the east coast I found this," and here
the captain handed Mr. Smith-Jones the bag of jewels which Nadara
had forgotten as she fled from Thandar.</p>

<p>Briefly he narrated what he knew of the history of the poor
woman to whom it had belonged.</p>

<p>"I recall the incident quite well," said Mrs. Smith-Jones, "I
had the pleasure of entertaining the count and countess when they
stopped here upon their honeymoon. They were lovely people, and
to think that they met so tragic an end!"</p>

<p>The three lapsed into silence. Burlinghame did not know
whether he was glad or sorry that he had not found the bones of
Waldo Emerson&mdash;that would have meant the end of hope for his
parents. Perhaps much the same thoughts were running through the
minds of the others.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the nether regions of the great house an electric
bell sounded. Still the three sat on in silence. They heard the
houseman open the front door. They heard low voices, and
presently there came a deferential tap upon the door of the
library.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith-Jones looked up and nodded. It was the houseman. He
held a letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"What is it, Krutz?" asked the master in a tired voice. It
seemed that nothing ever again would interest him.</p>

<p>"A special delivery letter, sir," replied the servant. "The
boy says you must sign for it yourself, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," replied Mr. Smith-Jones as he reached for the
letter and the receipt blank.</p>

<p>He glanced at the post mark&mdash;San Francisco.</p>

<p>Idly he cut the envelope.</p>

<p>"Pardon me?" He glanced at first his wife and then at Captain
Burlinghame.</p>

<p>The two nodded.</p>

<p>Mr. John Alden Smith-Jones opened the letter. There was a
single written sheet and an enclosure in another envelope. He had
read but a couple of lines when he came suddenly upright in his
chair.</p>

<p>Captain Burlinghame and Mrs. Smith-Jones looked at him in
polite and surprised questioning.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Mr. Smith-Jones. "He is alive&mdash;Waldo
is alive!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith-Jones and Captain Burlinghame sprang from their
chairs and ran toward the speaker.</p>

<p>With trembling hands that made it difficult to read the words
that his trembling voice could scarce utter, John Alden Smith-
Jones read aloud:</p><br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">On board the Sally
Corwith,<br> San Francisco, California</span>.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Mr. John Alden Smith-
Jones,<br> Boston, Mass.</span></p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">Just reached port and hasten to forward letter
your son gave me for his mother. He wouldn't come with us. We
found him on <sup>_____</sup> Island, Lat 10 degrees&mdash;South,
Long. 150 degrees&mdash;West. He seemed in good health and able
to look out for himself. Didn't want anything, he said, except a
razor, so we gave him that and one of the men gave him a plug of
chewing tobacco. Urged him to come, but he wouldn't. The enclosed
letter will doubtless tell you all about him.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Henry Dobbs,
Master</span>.</p><br>

<p>"Ten south, a hundred and fifty west," mused Captain
Burlinghame. "That's the same island we searched. Where could he
have been!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith-Jones had opened the letter addressed to her, and
was reading it breathlessly.</p><br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">I feel rather selfish in remaining and possibly
causing you further anxiety, but I have certain duties to perform
to several of the inhabitants which I feel obligated to fulfill
before I depart.</p>

<p class="letter">My treatment here has been all that anyone
might desire&mdash;even more, I might say.</p>

<p class="letter">The climate is delightful. My cough has left
me, and I am entirely a well man&mdash;more robust than I ever
recall having been in the past.</p>

<p class="letter">At present I am sojourning in the mountains,
having but run down to the sea shore today, where, happily, I
chanced to find the "Sally Corwith" in the harbor, and am taking
advantage of Captain Dobbs's kindness to forward this letter to
you.</p>

<p class="letter">Do not worry, dearest mother; my obligations
will soon be fulfilled and then I shall hasten to take the first
steamer for Boston.</p>

<p class="letter">I have met a number of interesting people
here&mdash;the most interesting people I have ever met. They
quite overwhelm one with their attentions.</p>

<p class="letter">And now, as Captain Dobbs is anxious to be
away, I will close, with ever assurance of my deepest love for
you and father.</p>

<p class="letter">Ever affectionately your son,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Waldo</span>.</p><br>

<p>Mrs. Smith-Jones' eyes were dim with tears&mdash;tears of
thanksgiving and happiness.</p>

<p>"And to think," she exclaimed, "that after all he is alive and
well&mdash;quite well. His cough has left him&mdash;that is the
best part of it, and he is surrounded by interesting
people&mdash;just what Waldo needed. For some time I feared,
before he sailed, that he was devoting himself too closely to his
studies and to the little coterie of our own set which surrounded
him. This experience will be broadening. Of course these people
may be slightly provincial, but it is evident that they possess a
certain culture and refinement&mdash;otherwise my Waldo would
never have described them as 'interesting.' The coarse,
illiterate, or vulgar could never prove 'interesting' to a Smith-
Jones."</p>

<p>Captain Cecil Burlinghame nodded politely&mdash;he was
thinking of the naked, hairy man-brutes he had seen within the
interior of the island.</p>

<p>"It is evident, Burlinghame," said Mr. Smith-Jones, "that you
overlooked a portion of the island. It would seem, from Waldo's
letter, there must be a colony of civilized men and women upon
it. Of course it is possible that it may be further inland than
you penetrated."</p>

<p>Burlinghame shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am puzzled," he said. "We circled the entire coast, yet
nowhere did we see any evidence of a man-improved harbor, such as
one might have reason to expect, were there really a colony of
advanced humans in the interior. There would have been at least a
shack near the beach in one of the several natural harbors which
indent the coast line, were there even an occasional steamer
touching for purposes of commerce with the colonists.</p>

<p>"No, my friends," he continued, "as much as I should like to
believe it my judgment will not permit me to place any such
translation upon Waldo's letter.</p>

<p>"That he is safe and happy seems evident, and that is enough
for us to know. Now it should be a simple matter for us to find
him&mdash;if it is still your desire to send for him."</p>

<p>"He may already have left for Boston," said Mrs. Smith-Jones;
"his letter was written several months ago."</p>

<p>Again Burlinghame shook his head.</p>

<p>"Do not bank on that, my dear madam," he said kindly. "It may
be fifty years before another vessel touches that forgotten
shore&mdash;unless it be one which you yourselves send."</p>

<p>John Alden Smith-Jones sprang to his feet, and commenced
pacing up and down the library.</p>

<p>"How soon can the <i>Priscilla</i> be put in shape to make the
return voyage to the island?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It CAN be done in a week, if necessary," replied
Burlinghame.</p>

<p>"And you will accompany her, in command?"</p>

<p>"Gladly."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Mr. Smith-Jones. "And now, my friend, let us
lose no time in starting our preparations. I intend accompanying
you."</p>

<p>"And I shall go too," said Mrs. Smith-Jones.</p>

<p>The two men looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"But my dear!" cried her husband, "there is no telling what
hardships and dangers we may encounter&mdash;you could never
stand such a trip."</p>

<p>"I am going," said Mrs. Smith-Jones, firmly. "I know my Waldo.
I know his refined and sensitive nature. I know that I am fully
capable of enduring whatever he may have endured. He tells me
that he is among interesting people. Evidently there is nothing
to fear, then, from the inhabitants of the island, and
furthermore I wish personally to meet the people he has been
living with. I have always been careful to surround Waldo with
only the nicest people, and if any vulgarizing influences have
been brought to bear upon him since he has been beyond my mature
guidance I wish to know it, that I may determine how to combat
their results."</p>

<p>That was the end of it. If Mrs. Smith-Jones knew her son, Mr.
Smith-Jones certainly knew his wife.</p>

<p>A week later the <i>Priscilla</i> sailed from Boston harbor on
her long journey around the Horn to the south seas.</p>

<p>Most of the old crew had been retained. The first and second
officers were new men. The former, William Stark, had come to
Burlinghame well recommended. From the first he seemed an
intelligent and experienced officer. That he was inclined to
taciturnity but enhanced his value in the eyes of Burlinghame.
Stark was inclined to be something of a martinet, so that the
crew soon took to hating him cordially, but as his display of
this unpleasant trait was confined wholly to trivial acts the men
contented themselves with grumbling among themselves, which is
the prerogative and pleasure of every good sailorman. Their
loyalty to the splendid Burlinghame, however, was not to be
shaken by even a dozen Starks.</p>

<p>The monotonous and uneventful journey to the vicinity of ten
south and a hundred and fifty west was finally terminated. At
last land showed on the starboard bow. Excitement reigned supreme
throughout the trim, white <i>Priscilla</i>. Mrs. Smith-Jones
peered anxiously and almost constantly through her binoculars,
momentarily expecting to see the well-known thin and emaciated
figure of her Waldo Emerson standing upon the beach awaiting
them.</p>

<p>For two weeks they sailed along the coast, stopping here and
there for a day while parties tramped inland in search of signs
of civilized habitation. They lay two days in the harbor where
the <i>Sally Corwith</i> had lain. There they pressed farther
inland than at any other point, but all without avail. It was
Burlinghame's plan to first make a cursory survey of the entire
coast, with only short incursions toward the center of the
island. Should this fail to discover the missing Waldo the party
was then to go over the ground once more, for the remaining weeks
or months as might be required to thoroughly explore every foot
of the island.</p>

<p>It was during the pursuit of the initial portion of the
program that they dropped anchor in the self-same harbor upon
whose waters Waldo Emerson and Nadara had seen the
<i>Priscilla</i> lying, only to fly from her.</p>

<p>Burlinghame recalled it as the spot at which the bag of jewels
had been picked up. Next to the <i>Sally Corwith</i> harbor, as
they had come to call the other anchorage, this seemed most
fraught with possibilities of success. They christened it Eugenie
Bay, after that poor, unfortunate lady, Eug&egrave;nie Marie C&eacute;leste de
la Valois, Countess of Crecy, whose jewels had been recovered
upon its shore.</p>

<p>Burlinghame and Waldo's father with half a dozen officers and
men of the <i>Priscilla</i> had spent the day searching the
woods, the plain and the hills for some slight sign of human
habitation. Shortly after noon First Officer Stark stumbled upon
the whitened skeleton of a man. In answer to his shouts the other
members of the party hastened to his side. They found the grim
thing lying in a little barren spot among the tall grasses. About
it the liquids of decomposition had killed vegetation, leaving
the thing all alone in all its grisly repulsiveness as though
shocked Nature had withdrawn in terror.</p>

<p>Stark stood pointing toward it without a word as the others
came up. Burlinghame was the first to reach Stark's side. He bent
low over the bones examining the skull carefully. John Alden
Smith-Jones came panting up. Instantly he saw what Burlinghame
was examining he turned deathly white. Burlinghame looked up at
him.</p>

<p>"It's not," he said. "Look at that skull&mdash;either a
gorilla or some very low type of man."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith-Jones breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"What an awful creature it must have been," he said, when he
had fully taken in the immense breadth of the squat skeleton. "It
cannot be that Waldo has survived in a wilderness peopled by such
creatures as this. Imagine him confronted by such a beast. Timid
by nature and never robust he would have perished of fright at
the very sight of this thing charging down upon him."</p>

<p>Captain Cecil Burlinghame acquiesced with a nod. He knew Waldo
Emerson well and so he could not even imagine a meeting between
the frail and cowardly youth and such a beast as this bleaching
frame must once have supported. And at their feet the bones of
Flatfoot lay mute witness to the impossible.</p>

<p>Presently a shout from one of the sailors attracted their
attention toward the far side of the valley. The man was
gesticulating violently toward the lofty cliffs which rose sheer
from the rank jungle grasses. All eyes turned in the direction
indicated by the excited sailor. At first they saw nothing, but
presently a figure came in sight upon a little elevation. It was
the figure of a human being, and even at the distance they were
from it all were assured that it was the figure of a female. She
was running toward the cliffs with the speed of a deer. And now,
behind her, came another figure. Thickset and squat was the thing
that pursued the woman. It might have been the reanimated
skeleton they had just discovered.</p>

<p>Would the creature catch her before she reached the cliff?
Would she find sanctuary even there? Already Burlinghame and
Stark had started toward the cliff on a run. John Alden Smith-
Jones followed more slowly. The men raced after their
officers.</p>

<p>The girl had reached the rocks and was scampering up their
precipitous face like a squirrel. Close behind her came the man.
They saw the girl reach a ledge just below the mouth of a cave in
which she evidently expected to find safety. They saw her
clambering up the rickety sapling that answered for a ladder.
They breathed sighs of relief, for it seemed that she was now
quite safe&mdash;the man was still one ledge below her.</p>

<p>But in another moment the watchers were filled with horror.
The brute pursuing her had reached forth a giant hand and seized
the base of the sapling. He was dragging it over the edge of the
cliff. In another moment the girl would be precipitated either
into his arms or to a horrible death upon the jagged rocks
beneath her.</p>

<p>Burlinghame and Stark halted simultaneously. At once two
rifles leaped to their shoulders. There were two reports, so
close together they seemed as one.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb7" id="chb7">VII. &mdash; FIRST MATE
STARK</a></h2>

<p class="first">Upon the day that Thurg discovered Nadara he had
come racing to the foot of the cliff, roaring and bellowing like
a mad bull. Upward he clambered half the distance to the girl's
lofty perch. Then a bit of jagged rock, well aimed, had brought
him to a sudden halt, spitting blood and teeth from his injured
mouth. He looked up at Nadara and shrieked out his rage and his
threats of vengeance. Nadara launched another missile at him that
caught him full upon one eye, dropping him like a stone to the
narrow ledge upon which he had been standing. Quickly the girl
started to descend to his side to finish the work she had
commenced, for she knew that there could be no peace or safety
for her, now that Thurg had discovered her hiding place, while
the monster lived.</p>

<p>But she had scarce more than lowered her sapling to the ledge
beneath her when the giant form of the man moved and Thurg sat
up. Quickly Nadara clambered back to her ledge, again drawing her
sapling after her. She was about to hurl another missile at the
man when he spoke to her.</p>

<p>"We are all alone in the world," he said. "All your people and
all my people have been slain by the Great Nagoola. Come down.
Let us live together in peace. There is no other left in all the
world."</p>

<p>Nadara laughed at him.</p>

<p>"Come down to you!" she cried, mockingly. "Live with you! I
would rather live with the pigs that root in the forest. Go away,
or I will finish what I have commenced, and kill you. I would not
live with you though I knew that you were the last human being on
earth."</p>

<p>Thurg pleaded and threatened, but all to no avail. Again he
tried to clamber to her side, but again he was repulsed with
well-aimed missiles. At last he withdrew, growling and
threatening.</p>

<p>For weeks he haunted the vicinity of the cliff. Nadara's
meager food supply was soon exhausted. She was forced to descend
to replenish her larder and fill her gourd, or die of starvation
and thirst. She made her trips to the forest at night, though
black Nagoola prowled and the menace of Thurg loomed through the
darkness. At last the man discovered her in one of these
nocturnal expeditions and almost caught her before she reached
her ledge of safety.</p>

<p>For three days he kept her a close prisoner. Again her stock
of provisions was exhausted. She was desperate. Twice had Nagoola
nearly trapped her in the forest. She dared not again tempt fate
in the gloomy wood by night. There was nothing left but to risk
all in one last effort to elude Thurg by day and find another
asylum in some far distant corner of the island.</p>

<p>Carefully she watched her opportunity, and while the beast-man
was temporarily absent seeking food for himself the girl slid
swiftly to the base of the cliff and started through the tall
grasses for the opposite side of the valley.</p>

<p>Upon this day Thurg had fallen upon the spoor of deer as he
had searched the forest for certain berries that were in season
and which he particularly enjoyed. The trail led along the edge
of the wood to the opposite side of the valley, and over the
hills into the region beyond. All day Thurg followed the fleet
animals, until at last not having come up with them he was forced
to give up the pursuit and return to the cliffs, lest his more
valuable quarry should escape.</p>

<p>Halfway between the hills and the cliff he came suddenly face
to face with Nadara. Not twenty paces separated them. With a howl
of satisfaction Thurg leaped to seize her, but she turned and
fled before he could lay his hand upon her. If Thurg had found
his other quarry of that day swift, so, too, he now found Nadara,
for terror gave wings to her flying feet. Lumbering after her
came Thurg, and had the distance been less he would have been
left far behind, but it was a long distance from the spot, where
they had met, to Nadara's cliffs. The girl could out-run the man
for a short distance, but when victory depended upon endurance
the advantage was all on the side of the brute.</p>

<p>As they neared the goal Nadara realized that the lead she had
gained at first was rapidly being overcome by the horrid creature
panting so close behind her. She strained every nerve and muscle
in a last mad effort to outdistance the fate that was closing
upon her. She reached the cliff. Thurg was just behind her. Half
spent, she stumbled upward in, what seemed to her, pitiful
slowness. At last her hand grasped the sapling that led to the
mouth of her cave&mdash;in another instant she would be safe. But
her new-born hope went out as she felt the sapling slipping and
glanced downward to see Thurg dragging it from its position.</p>

<p>She shut her eyes that she might not see the depths below into
which she was about to be hurled, and then there smote upon her
ears the most terrific burst of sound that had ever assailed
them, other than the thunders that rolled down out of the heavens
when the rains came. But this sound did not come from
above&mdash;it came from the valley beneath.</p>

<p>The ladder ceased to slip. She opened her eyes and glanced
downward. Far below her lay the body of Thurg. She could see that
he was quite dead. He lay upon his face and from his back
trickled two tiny streams of blood from little holes.</p>

<p>Nadara clambered upward to her ledge, drawing her sapling
after her, and then she looked about for an explanation of the
strange noise and the sudden death of Thurg, for she could not
but connect the one with the other. Below, in the valley, she saw
a number of men strangely garbed. They were coming toward her
cliff. She gathered her missiles closely about her, ready to her
hand. Now they were below and calling up to her. Her eyes dilated
in wonder&mdash;they spoke the strange tongue that Thandar had
tried to teach her. She called down to them in her own tongue,
but they shook their heads, motioning her to descend. She was
afraid. All her life she had been afraid of men, and with
reason&mdash;of all except her old foster father and Thandar.
These, evidently, were men. She could only expect from them the
same treatment that Thurg would have accorded her.</p>

<p>One of them had started up the face of the cliff. It was
Stark. Nadara seized a bit of rock and hurled it down upon him.
He barely dodged the missile, but he desisted in his attempt to
ascend to her. Now Burlinghame advanced, raising his hand, palm
toward her in sign that she should not assault him. She recalled
some of the language that Thandar had taught her&mdash;maybe they
would understand it.</p>

<p>"Go-away!" she cried. "Go-away! Nadara kill bad-men."</p>

<p>A look of pleasure overspread Burlinghame's face&mdash;the
girl spoke English.</p>

<p>"We are not bad men," he called up to her. "We will not harm
you."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" Asked Nadara, still unconvinced by mere
words.</p>

<p>"We want to talk with you," replied Burlinghame. "We are
looking for a friend who was ship-wrecked upon this island. Come
down. We will not harm you. Have we not already proved our
friendship by killing this fellow who pursued you?"</p>

<p>This man spoke precisely the tongue of Thandar. Nadara could
understand every word, for Thandar had talked to her much in
English. She could understand it better than she could speak it.
If they talked the same tongue as Thandar they must be from the
same country. Maybe they were Thandar's friends. Anyway, they
were like him, and Thandar had never harmed women. She could
trust them. Slowly she lowered her sapling and began the descent.
Several times she hesitated as though minded to return to her
ledge, but Burlinghame's kindly voice and encouragement at last
prevailed, and presently Nadara stood before them.</p>

<p>The officers and men of the <i>Priscilla</i> crowded around
the girl. They were struck by her beauty, and the simple dignity
of her manner and her carriage. The great black panther skin that
fell from her left shoulder she wore with the majesty of a queen
and with a naturalness that cast no reflection upon her modesty,
though it revealed quite as much of her figure as it hid. William
Stark, first officer of the <i>Priscilla</i>, caught his
breath&mdash;never, he was positive, had God made a more lovely
creature.</p>

<p>From the top of the cliff a shaggy man peered down upon the
strange scene. He blinked his little eyes, scratched his matted
head, and once he picked up a large stone that lay near him; but
he did not hurl it upon those below, for he had heard the loud
report of the rifles, seen the smoke belch from the muzzles, and
witnessed the sudden and miraculous collapse of Thurg.</p>

<p>Burlinghame was speaking to Nadara.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Nadara," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>Nadara jerked her thumb over her shoulder toward the cliff at
her back. Burlinghame searched the rocky escarpment with his
eyes, but saw no sign of another living being there.</p>

<p>"Where are your people?"</p>

<p>"Dead."</p>

<p>"All of them?"</p>

<p>Nadara nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>"How long have they been dead and what killed them?" continued
Burlinghame.</p>

<p>"Almost a moon. The Great Nagoola killed them."</p>

<p>In answer to other questions Nadara related all that had
transpired since the night of the earthquake. Her description of
the catastrophe convinced the Americans that a violent quake had
recently occurred to shake the island to its foundations.</p>

<p>"Ask her about Waldo," whispered Mr. Smith-Jones, himself
dreading the question.</p>

<p>"We are looking for a young man," said Burlinghame, "who was
lost overboard from a steamer on the west coast of this island.
We know that he reached the shore alive, for we have heard from
him. Have you ever seen or heard of this stranger? His name is
Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones&mdash;this gentleman is his father,"
indicated Mr. Smith-Jones.</p>

<p>Nadara looked with wide eyes at John Alden Smith-Jones. So
this man was Thandar's father. She felt very sorry for him, for
she knew that he loved Thandar&mdash;Thandar had often told her
so. She did not know how to tell him&mdash;she shrank from
causing another the anguish and misery that she had endured.</p>

<p>"Did you know of him?" asked Burlinghame.</p>

<p>Nadara nodded her head.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" cried Waldo's father. "Where are the people
with whom he lived here?"</p>

<p>Nadara came close to John Alden Smith-Jones. There was no fear
in her innocent young heart for this man who was Thandar's
father&mdash;who loved Thandar&mdash;only a great compassion for
him in the sorrow that she was about to inflict. Gently she took
his hand in hers, raising her sad eyes to his.</p>

<p>"Where is he? Where is my boy?" whispered Mr. Smith-Jones.</p>

<p>"He is with his people, who were my people&mdash;the people of
whom I have just told you," replied Nadara softly&mdash;"He is
dead." And then she dropped her face upon the man's hand and
wept.</p>

<p>The shock staggered John Alden Smith-Jones. It seemed
incredible&mdash;impossible&mdash;that Waldo could have lived
through all that he must have lived through to perish at last but
a few short weeks before succor reached him. For a moment he
forgot the girl. It was her hot tears upon his hand that aroused
him to a consciousness of the present.</p>

<p>"Why do you weep?" he cried almost roughly.</p>

<p>"For you," she replied, "who loved him, too."</p>

<p>"You loved Waldo?" asked the boy's father.</p>

<p>Nadara nodded her tumbled mass of raven hair. John Alden
Smith-Jones looked down upon the bent head of the sobbing girl in
silence for several minutes. Many things were racing through his
patrician brain. He was by training, environment and heredity
narrow and Puritanical. He saw the meager apparel of the
girl&mdash;he saw her nut brown skin; but he did not see her
nakedness, for something in his heart told him that sweet virtue
clothed her more effectively than could silks and satins without
virtue. Gently he placed an arm about her, drawing her to
him.</p>

<p>"My daughter," he said, and pressed his lips to her
forehead.</p>

<p>It was a solemn and sorrow-ridden party that boarded the
<i>Priscilla</i> an hour later. Mrs. Smith-Jones had seen them
coming. Some intuitive sense may have warned her of the sorrow
that lay in store for her upon their return. At any rate, she did
not meet them at the rail as in the past, instead she returned to
her cabin to await her husband there. When he joined her he
brought with him a half-naked young woman. Mrs. Smith-Jones
looked upon the girl with ill-concealed horror.</p>

<p>Waldo's mother met the shock of her husband's news with much
greater fortitude than he had expected. As a matter of fact she
had been prepared for this from the first. She had never really
believed that Waldo could survive for any considerable time far
from the comforts and luxuries of his Boston home and the
watchful care of herself.</p>

<p>"And who is this&mdash;ah&mdash;person?" she asked coldly at
last, holding her pince-nez before her eyes as with elevated
brows she cast a look of disapproval upon Nadara.</p>

<p>The girl, reading more in the older woman's manner than her
words, drew herself up proudly. Mr. Smith-Jones coughed and
colored. He stepped to Nadara's side, placing her arm about her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"She loved Waldo," he said simply.</p>

<p>"The brazen hussy!" exclaimed Mrs. Smith-Jones. "To dare love
a Smith-Jones!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Louisa!" ejaculated her husband. "Remember that
she too is suffering&mdash;do not add to her sorrow. She loved
our boy, and he returned her love."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"She has told me," replied the man.</p>

<p>"It is not true," cried Mrs. Smith-Jones. "It is not true!
Waldo Emerson would never stoop to love one out of his own high
class. Who is she, and what proof have you that Waldo loved
her?"</p>

<p>"I am Nadara," said the girl proudly, answering for herself.
"And this is the proof that he loved me. He told me that this was
the pledge token between us until we could come to his land and
be mated according to the customs there." She held out her left
hand, upon the third finger of which sparkled a great
solitaire&mdash;a solitaire which Mrs. John Alden Smith-Jones
recognized instantly.</p>

<p>"He gave you that?" she asked.</p>

<p>Then she turned toward her husband.</p>

<p>"What do you intend doing with this girl?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I shall take her back home," replied he. "She should be as a
daughter to us, for Waldo would have made her such had he lived.
She cannot remain upon the island. All her people were killed by
the earthquake that destroyed Waldo. She is in constant danger of
attack by the wild beasts and wilder men. We cannot leave her
here, and even if we could I should not do so, for we owe a duty
to our dead boy to care for her as he would have cared for
her&mdash;and we owe a greater duty to her."</p>

<p>"I must be alone," was all that Mrs. Smith-Jones replied.
"Please take her away, John. Give her the cabin next to this, and
have Marie clothe her properly&mdash;Marie's clothes should about
fit her." There was more of tired anguish in her voice now than
of anger.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith-Jones led Nadara out and summoned Marie, but Nadara
upset his plans by announcing that she wished to return to the
shore.</p>

<p>"She does not like me," she said, nodding toward Mrs. Smith-
Jones's cabin, "and I will not stay."</p>

<p>It took John Alden Smith-Jones a long time to persuade the
girl to change her mind. He pointed out that his wife was greatly
overwrought by the shock of the news of Waldo's death. He assured
Nadara that at heart she was a kindly woman, and that eventually
she would regret her attitude toward the girl. And at last Nadara
consented to remain aboard the <i>Priscilla</i>. But when Marie
would have clothed her in the garments of civilization she
absolutely refused&mdash;scorning the hideous and uncomfortable
clothing.</p>

<p>It was two days before Mrs. Smith-Jones sent for her. When she
entered that lady's cabin the latter exclaimed at once against
her barbarous attire.</p>

<p>"I gave instructions that Marie should dress you properly,"
she said. "You are not decently clothed&mdash;that bear skin is
shocking."</p>

<p>Nadara tossed her head, and her eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>"I shall never wear your silly clothes," she cried. "This
Thandar gave me&mdash;he slew Nagoola, the black panther, with
his own hands, and gave the skin to me who was to be his
mate&mdash;do you think I would exchange it for such foolish
garments as these?" she waved a contemptuous gesture toward Mrs.
Smith-Jones expensive morning gown.</p>

<p>The elder woman forgot her outraged dignity in the suggestion
the girl had given her for an excuse to be rid of her at the
first opportunity. She had mentioned a party named Thandar. She
had brazenly boasted that this Thandar had killed the beast whose
pelt she wore and had given her the thing for a garment. She had
admitted that she was to become this person's "mate." Mrs. Smith-
Jones shuddered at the primitive word. At this moment Mr. Smith-
Jones entered the cabin. He smiled pleasantly at Nadara, and
then, seeing in the attitudes of the two women that he had
stepped within a theater of war, he looked questioningly at his
wife.</p>

<p>"Now what, Louisa?" he asked, somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>"Sufficient, John," exclaimed that lady, "to bear out my
original contention that it was a very unwise move to bring this
woman with us&mdash;she has just admitted that she was the
promised 'mate' of a person she calls Thandar. She is
brazen&mdash;I refuse to permit her to enter my home; nor shall
she remain upon the <i>Priscilla</i> longer than is necessary to
land her at the first civilized port."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith-Jones looked questioningly at Nadara. The girl had
guessed the erroneous reasoning that had caused Mrs. Smith-
Jones's excitement. She had forgotten that they did not know that
Waldo and Thandar were one. Now she could scarce repress a smile
of amusement nor resist the temptation to take advantage of Mrs.
Smith-Jones's ignorance to bait her further.</p>

<p>"You had another lover beside Waldo?" asked Mr. Smith-
Jones.</p>

<p>"I loved Thandar," she replied. "Thandar was king of my
people. He loved me. He slew Nagoola for me and gave me his skin.
He slew Korth and Flatfoot, also. They wanted me, but Thandar
slew them. And Big Fist he slew, and Sag the Killer&mdash;oh,
Thandar was a mighty fighter. Can you wonder that I loved
him?"</p>

<p>"He was a hideous murderer!" cried Mrs. Smith-Jones, "and to
think that my poor Waldo&mdash;poor, timid, gentle
Waldo&mdash;was condemned to live among such savage brutes. Oh,
it is too terrible!"</p>

<p>Nadara's eyes went wide. It was her turn to suffer a shock.
"Poor, timid, gentle Waldo!" Had she heard aright? Could it be
that they were describing the same man? There must be some
mistake.</p>

<p>"Did Waldo know that you loved Thandar?" asked Mr. Smith-
Jones.</p>

<p>"Thandar was Waldo," she replied. "Thandar is the name I gave
him&mdash;it means the Brave One. He was very brave," she cried.
"He was not 'timid,' and he was only 'gentle' with women and
children."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith-Jones hand never been so shocked in all her life.
She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Leave my cabin!" she cried. "I see through your shallow
deception. You thoughtlessly betrayed yourself and your vulgar
immoralities, and now you try to hide behind a base calumny that
pictures my dear, dead boy as one with your hideous, brutal
chief. You shall not deceive me longer. Leave my cabin,
please!"</p>

<p>Mr. Smith-Jones stood as one paralyzed. He could not believe
in the perfidy of the girl&mdash;it seemed impossible that she
could have so deceived him&mdash;nor yet could he question the
integrity of his own ears. It was, of course, too far beyond the
pale of reason to attempt to believe that Waldo Emerson and the
terrible Thandar were one and the same. The girl had gone too
far, and yet he could not believe that she was bad. There must be
some explanation.</p>

<p>In the meantime Nadara had left the room, her little chin high
in the air. Never again, she determined, would she subject
herself to the insults of Thandar's mother. She went on deck. She
craved the fresh air, and the excitement to be found above. The
officers had been very nice to her. Stark was much with her. The
man had fallen desperately in love with the half-savage girl. As
she reached the deck after leaving Mrs. Smith-Jones's cabin Stark
was the first she chanced to meet. She would have preferred being
alone with her sorrow and her anger, but the man joined her.
Together they stood by the rail watching the approach of heavy
clouds. A storm was about to break over them that had been
brewing for several days.</p>

<p>Stark knew nothing of what had taken place below, but he saw
that the girl was unhappy. He attempted to cheer her. At last he
took her hand and stroked it caressingly as he talked with her.
Before she could guess his intention he was pouring words of love
and passion into her ears. Nadara drew away. A puzzled expression
contracted her brows.</p>

<p>"Do not talk so to Nadara," she said. "She does not love you."
And then she moved away and went to her cabin.</p>

<p>Stark looked after her as she departed. He was thoroughly
aroused. Who was this savage girl, to repulse him? What would
have been her fate, but for his well-directed shot? Was not the
man who had been pursuing her but acting after the customs of her
wild people? He would have taken her by force. That was the only
way she would have been taken had she been left upon her own
island. That was the only kind of betrothal she knew. It was what
she expected. He had been a fool to approach her with the soft
words of civilization. They had made her despise him. She should
have understood force and loved him for it. Well, he would show
her that he could be as primitive as any of her savage
lovers.</p>

<p>The storm broke. The wind became a hurricane. The
<i>Priscilla</i> was forced to turn and flee before the anger of
the elements, so that she retraced her course of the past two
days and then was blown to the north.</p>

<p>Stark saw nothing of Nadara during this period. At the end of
thirty-six hours the wind had died and the sea was settling to
its normal quiet. It was the first evening after the storm. The
deck of the <i>Priscilla</i> was almost deserted. The yacht was
moving slowly along not far off the shore of one of the many
islands that dot that part of the south seas.</p>

<p>Nadara came on deck for a walk before retiring. Stark and two
other sailors were on watch. At sight of the girl the first
officer approached her. He spoke pleasantly as though nothing had
occurred to mar their friendly relations. He talked of the storm
and pointed out the black outlines of the nearby shore, and as he
talked he led her toward the stern, out of sight of the sailors
forward.</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned upon her and grasped her into his arms.
With brutal force he crushed her to him, covering her face with
kisses. She fought to free herself, but Stark was a strong man.
Slowly he forced her to the deck. She beat him in the face and
upon the breast, and at last, in the extreme of desperation, she
screamed for help. Instantly he struck her a heavy blow upon the
jaw. The slender form of the girl relaxed upon the deck in
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Now Stark came to a sudden realization of the gravity of the
thing he had done. He knew that when Nadara regained
consciousness his perfidy would come to the attention of Captain
Burlinghame, and he feared the quiet, ex-naval officer more than
he did the devil. He looked over the rail. It would be an easy
thing to dispose of the girl. He had only to drop her unconscious
body into the still waters below. He raised her in his arms and
bore her to the rail. The moon shone down upon her face. He
looked out over the water and saw the shore so close at hand.</p>

<p>There would be a thorough investigation and the sailors, who
had no love for him, as he well knew, would lose no time in
reporting that he had been the last to be seen with the girl.
Evidently he was in for it, one way or the other.</p>

<p>Again he looked down into Nadara's face. She was very
beautiful. He wanted her badly. Slowly his glance wandered to the
calm waters of the ocean and on to the quiet shore line. Then
back to the girl. For a moment he stood irresolute. Then he
stepped to the side of the cabin where hung a life preserver to
which was attached a long line.</p>

<p>He put the life preserver about Nadara. Then he lowered her
into the ocean. The moment he felt her weight transferred from
the lowering rope to the life preserver he vaulted over the
yacht's rail into the dark waters beneath her stern.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb8" id="chb8">VIII. &mdash; THE WILD MEN</a></h2>

<p class="first">Nadara did not regain consciousness until Stark
had reached shore and was dragging her out upon the beach above
the surf. For several minutes after she had opened her eyes she
had difficulty in recalling the events that had immediately
preceded Stark's attack upon her. She felt the life belt still
about her, and as Stark stooped above her to remove it she knew
that it was he though she could not distinguish his features.</p>

<p>What had happened? Slowly a realization of the man's bold act
forced itself upon her&mdash;he had leaped overboard from the
<i>Priscilla</i> and swam ashore with her rather than face the
consequences of his brutal conduct toward her.</p>

<p>To the girl reared within the protective influences of
civilization Nadara's position would have seemed hopeless; but
Nadara knew naught of other protection than that afforded by her
own quick wits and the agility of her swift young muscles. To her
it would have seemed infinitely more appalling to have been
confined within the narrow limits of the yacht with this man, for
there all was strange and new. She still had half-feared and
mistrusted all aboard the <i>Priscilla</i> except Thandar's
father and Captain Burlinghame; but would they have protected her
from Stark? She did not know. Among her own people only a father,
brother, or mate protected a woman from one who sought her
against her will, and of these she had not upon the little
vessel.</p>

<p>But now it was different. Intuitively she knew that upon a
savage shore, however strange and unfamiliar it might be, she
would have every advantage over the first officer of the
<i>Priscilla</i>. His life had been spent close to the haunts of
civilization; he knew nothing of the woodcraft that was second
nature to her; he might perish in a land of plenty through
ignorance of where to search for food, and of what was edible and
what was not. This much her early experience with Waldo Emerson
had taught her. When their paths first had crossed Waldo had been
as ignorant as a new-born babe in the craft of life
primeval&mdash;Nadara had had to teach him everything.</p>

<p>Behind them Nadara heard the gentle sloughing of
trees&mdash;the myriad noises of the teeming jungle
night&mdash;and she smiled. It was inky black about them. Stark
had removed the life belt and placed it beneath the girl's head.
He thought her still unconscious&mdash;perhaps dead. Now he was
wringing the water from his clothes, his back toward her.</p>

<p>Nadara rose to her feet&mdash;noiseless as Nagoola. Like a
shadow she melted into the blackness of the jungle that fringed
the shore. Careful and alert, she picked her way within the
tangled mass for a few yards. At the bole of a large tree she
halted, listening. Then she made a low, weird sound with her
lips, listening again for a moment after. This she repeated
thrice, and then, seemingly satisfied that no danger lurked
above, she swung herself into the low-hanging branches, quickly
ascending until she found a comfortable seat where she might rest
in ease.</p>

<p>Down upon the beach Stark, having wrung the surplus water from
his garments, turned to examine and revive the girl, if she still
lived. Even in the darkness her form had been plainly visible
against the yellow sand, but now she was not there. Stark was
dumbfounded. His eyes leaped quickly from one point to another,
yet nowhere could they discover the girl. There was the beach,
the sea and the jungle. Which had she chose for her flight? It
did not take Stark long to guess, and immediately he turned his
steps toward the shapeless, gloomy mass that marked the forest's
edge.</p>

<p>As he approached he went more slowly. The thought of entering
that forbidding wood sent cold shivers creeping through him.
Could a mere girl have dared its nameless horrors? She must have,
and with the decision came new resolution. What a girl had dared
certainly he might dare. Again he strode briskly toward the
jungle.</p>

<p>Just at its verge he heard a low, weird sound not a dozen
paces within the black, hideous tangle. It was Nadara voicing the
two notes which some ancient forebear of her tribe had discovered
would wring an answering growl from Nagoola, and an uneasy hiss
from that other arch-enemy of man&mdash;the great, slimy serpent
whose sinuous coils twined threateningly above them in the
branches of the trees. Only these Nadara feared&mdash;these and
man. So, before entering a tree at night it was her custom to
assure herself that neither Nagoola nor Coovra lurked in the
branches of the tree she had chose for sanctuary. Stark beat a
hasty retreat, nor did he again venture from the beach during the
balance of the long, dismal night.</p>

<p>When dawn broke it found Nadara much refreshed by the sleep
she had enjoyed within the comparative safety of the great tree,
and Stark haggard and exhausted by a sleepless night of terror
and regret. He cursed himself, the girl and his bestial passion,
and then as his thoughts conjured her lovely face and perfect
figure before his mind's eye, he leaped to his feet and swung
briskly toward the jungle. He would find her. All that he had
sacrificed should not be in vain. He would find her and keep her.
Together they would make a home upon this tropical shore. He
would get everything out of life that there was to get.</p>

<p>He had taken but a few steps before he discovered, plain in
the damp sand before him, the prints of Nadara's naked feet in a
well-defined trail leading toward the wood. With a smile of
satisfaction and victory the man followed it into the maze of
vegetation, dank and gloomy even beneath the warm light of the
morning sun.</p>

<p>By chance he stumbled directly upon Nadara. She had descended
from her tree to search for water. They saw each other
simultaneously. The girl turned and fled farther into the forest.
Close behind her came the man. For several hundred yards the
chase led through the thick jungle which terminated abruptly at
the edge of a narrow, rock-covered clearing beyond which loomed
sheer, precipitous cliffs, rasing their lofty heads three hundred
feet above the forest.</p>

<p>A half-smile touched Stark's lips as he saw the barrier that
nature had placed in the path of his quarry; but almost instantly
it froze into an expression of horror as a slight noise to his
right attracted his attention from the girl fleeing before him.
For an instant he stood bewildered, then a quick glance toward
the girl revealed her scaling the steep cliff with the agility of
a monkey, and with a cry to attract her attention he leaped after
her once more, but this time himself the quarry&mdash;the hunter
become the hunted, for after him raced a score of painted
savages, brandishing long, slim spears, or waving keen-edged
parangs.</p>

<p>Nadara had not needed Stark's warning cry to apprise her of
the proximity of the wild men. She had seen them the instant that
she cleared the jungle, and with the sight of them she knew that
she need no longer harbor fear of the white man. In them, though,
she saw a graver danger for herself, since they, doubtless, would
have little difficulty in overhauling her in their own haunts,
while she had not had much cause for worry as to her ability to
elude the white man indefinitely.</p>

<p>Part way up the cliffs she paused to look back. Stark had
reached the foot of the towering escarpment a short distance
ahead of his pursuers. He had chosen this route because of the
ease with which the girl had clambered up the rocky barrier, but
he had reckoned without taking into consideration the lifetime of
practice which lay back of Nadara's agility. From earliest
infancy she had lived upon the face and within the caves of steep
cliffs. Her first toddling, baby footsteps had been along the
edge of narrow shelving ledges.</p>

<p>When the man reached the cliff, however, he found confronting
him an apparently unscalable wall. He cast a frightened,
appealing glance at the girl far above him. Twice he essayed to
scramble out of reach of the advancing savages, whose tattooed
faces, pendulous slit ears, and sharp filed, blackened teeth lent
to them a more horrid aspect than even that imparted by their
murderous weapons or warlike whoops and actions. Each time he
slipped back, clutching frantically at rocky projects and such
hardy vegetation as had found foothold in the crevices of the
granite. His hands were torn and bleeding, his face scratched and
his clothing rent. And now the savages were upon him. They had
seen that he was unarmed. No need as yet for spear or
parang&mdash;they would take him alive.</p>

<p>And the girl. They had watched her in amazement as she
clambered swiftly up the steep ascent. With all their primitive
accomplishments this was beyond even them. They were a forest
people and a river people. They dwelt in thatched houses raised
high upon long piles. They knew little or nothing of the arts of
the cliff dwellers. To them the feat of this strange, white girl
was little short of miraculous.</p>

<p>Nadara saw them seize roughly upon the terror-stricken Stark.
She saw them bind his hands behind his back, and then she saw
them turn their attention once more toward herself.</p>

<p>Three of the warriors attempted to scale the cliff after her.
Slowly they ascended. She smiled at their manifest fear and their
awkwardness&mdash;she need have no fear of these, they never
could reach her. She permitted them to approach within a dozen
feet of her and then, loosening a bit of the crumbling granite,
she hurled it full at the head of the foremost. With a yell of
pain and terror he toppled backward upon those below him, the
three tumbling, screaming and pawing to the rocks at the base of
the cliff.</p>

<p>None of them was killed, through all were badly bruised, and
he who had received her missile bled profusely from a wound upon
his forehead. Their fellows laughed at them&mdash;it was scant
comfort they received for being bested by a girl. Then they
withdrew a short distance, and squatting in a circle they
commenced a lengthy palaver. Their repeated gestures in her
direction convinced Nadara that she was the subject of their
debate.</p>

<p>Presently one of their number arose and approached the foot of
the cliff. There he harangued the girl for several minutes. When
he was done he awaited, evidently for a reply from her; but as
Nadara had not been able to understand a word of the fellow's
language she could but shake her head.</p>

<p>The spokesman returned to his fellows and once again a length
council was held. During it Nadara climbed farther aloft, that
she might be out of range of the slender spears. Upon a narrow
ledge she halted, gathering about her such loose bits of rock as
she could dislodge from the face of the cliff&mdash;she would be
prepared for a sudden onslaught, nor for a moment did she doubt
the outcome of the battle. She felt that but for the lack of food
and water she could hold this cliff face forever against
innumerable savages&mdash;could they climb no better than
these.</p>

<p>But the wild men did not again attempt to storm her citadel.
Instead they leaped suddenly from their council, and without a
glance toward her disappeared in the forest, taking their
prisoner with them. Out of our sight of the girl, they stationed
two of their number just within the screening verdure to capture
the girl should she descend. The others hastened parallel with
the cliff until a sudden turn inland took them to a point from
which they could again emerge into the clearing out of the sight
of Nadara.</p>

<p>Here they took immediately to a well-worn path that led back
and forth upward across the face of the cliff. Stark was dragged
and prodded forward with them in their ascent. Sharp spears and
the points of keen parangs urged him to haste. By the time the
party reached the summit the white man was bleeding from a score
of superficial wounds.</p>

<p>Now the party turned back along the top of the bluff in the
direction from which they had come.</p>

<p>Nadara, unable to fathom their reason for having abandoned the
attempt to capture her, was, however, not lulled into any feeling
of false security. She knew the cliff was the safest place for
her, and yet the pangs of thirst and hunger warned her that she
must soon leave it to seek sustenance. She was about to descend
to the jungle below in search of food and water, when the
faintest of movements of earth sweeping creepers depending from a
giant buttress tree below her and just within the verge of the
forest arrested her acute attention. She knew that the movement
had been caused by some animal beneath the tree, and finally, as
she watched intently for a moment or two, she descried an Argus
pheasant with which the war caps of the savages had been
adorned.</p>

<p>Though she knew now that she was watched, she also knew that
she could reach the top of the cliff and possibly find both food
and drink, if it chanced to be near, before the savages could
overtake her. Then she must depend upon her wits and her speed to
regain the safety of the cliff ahead of them. That they would
attempt to scale the barrier at the same point at which she
climbed it she doubted, for she had seen that they were
comparatively unaccustomed to this sort of going, and so she
guessed that if they followed her upward at all it would be by
means of some beaten trail of which they had knowledge.</p>

<p>And so Nadara scaled the heights, passing over and around
obstacles that would have blanched the cheek of the hardiest
mountain climber, with the ease and speed of the chamois. At the
summit she found an open, park-like forest, and into this she
plunged, running forward in quest of food and drink. A few
familiar fruits and nuts assuaged the keenest pangs of hunger,
but nowhere could she find water or signs of water.</p>

<p>She had traveled for almost a mile, directly inland from the
coast, when she stumbled, purely by chance, upon a little spring
hidden in a leafy bower. The cool, clear water refreshed her,
imparting to her new life and energy. After drinking her fill she
sought some means of carrying a little supply of the priceless
liquid back to her cliffside refuge, but though she searched
diligently she could discover no growing thing that might be
transformed into a vessel.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it then, other than to return without
the water, trusting to her wits to find the means of eluding the
savages from time to time as it became necessary for her to
quench her thirst. Later, she was sure, she should discover some
form of gourd, or the bladder of an animal in which she could
hoard a few precious drops.</p>

<p>Her woodcraft, combined with her almost uncanny sense of
direction, led her directly back to the spot at which she had
topped the cliff. There was no sign of the savages. She breathed
a sigh of relief as she stepped to the edge of the forest, and
then, all about her, from behind trees and bushes, rose the main
body of the wild men. With shouts of savage glee they leaped upon
her. There was no chance for flight&mdash;in every direction
brutal faces and murderous weapons barred her way.</p>

<p>With greater consideration than she had looked forward to,
they signaled her to accompany them. Stark was with them. To him
slight humanity was shown. If he lagged, a spear point, already
red with his blood, urged him to greater speed; but to the girl
no cruelty nor indignity was shown.</p>

<p>In single file, the prisoners in the center of the column, the
party made its way inland. All day they marched, until Stark,
unused to this form of exertion, staggered and fell a dozen times
each mile.</p>

<p>Nadara could almost have found it in her heart to be sorry for
him, had it not been for the fact that she realized all too
keenly that but for his own bestial brutality neither of them
need have been there to be subjected to the present torture, and
to be tortured by anticipation of horrors to come.</p>

<p>To the girl it seemed that her fate must be a thousandfold
more terrible than the mere death the man was to suffer, for that
these degraded savages would let him live seemed beyond the pale
of reason. She prayed to the God of which her Thandar had taught
her for a quick and merciful death, yet while she prayed she well
knew that no such boon could be expected.</p>

<p>She compared her captors to Korth and Flatfoot, with Big Fist
and Thurg, nor did she look for greater compassion in them than
in the men she had known best.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon it became evident that Stark could
proceed no farther unless the savages carried him. That they had
any intention of so doing was soon disproved. The first officer
of the <i>Priscilla</i> had fallen for the twentieth time. A
dozen vicious spear thrusts failed to bring him staggering and
tottering, to his feet as in the past.</p>

<p>The chief of the party approached the fallen white, kicking
him in the sides and face, and at last pricking him with the
sharp point of his parang. Stark but lay an inert mass of
suffering flesh, and groaned. The chief grew angry. He grasped
the white man around the body and raised him to his feet, but the
moment that he released him Stark fell to the earth once
more.</p>

<p>At last the warrior could evidently control his rage no
further. With a savage whoop he swung his parang aloft, bringing
it down full upon the neck of the prostrate white. The head,
grinning horribly, rolled to Nadara's feet. She looked at it,
lying there staring up at her out of its black and sightless
eyes, without the slightest trace of emotion.</p>

<p>Nadara, the cave girl, was accustomed to death in all its most
horrible and sudden forms. She saw before her but the head of an
enemy. It was nothing to her&mdash;Stark had only himself to
thank.</p>

<p>The chief gathered the severed head into a bit of bark cloth,
and fastening it to the end of his spear, signaled his followers
to resume the journey.</p>

<p>On and on they went, farther into the interior, and with them
went Nadara, borne to what nameless fate she could but guess.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="chb9" id="chb9">IX. &mdash; BUILDING THE
BOAT</a></h2>

<p class="first">Two days after the earthquake that had saved
Nadara from Thurg and wiped out the people of the girl's tribe, a
man moved feebly beneath the tumbled debris from the rooftop of
his clogged cavern. It was Thandar. The tons of rock that had
toppled from above and buried the entrance to this cave had
passed him by unscathed, while the few pounds shaken from the
ceiling had stunned him into a long enduring insensibility.</p>

<p>Slowly he regained consciousness, but it was a long time
before he could marshal his faculties to even a slight
appreciation of the catastrophe that had overwhelmed him. Then
his first thought was of Nadara. He crawled to what had once been
the entrance of his cave. He had not as yet linked the darkness
to its real cause&mdash;he thought it was night. It had been
night when he closed his eyes. How could he guess that that had
been three nights before, or all the cruel blows that fate had
struck him since he slept?</p>

<p>At the opening from the cave he met his first surprise and
setback&mdash;the way was blocked! What was the meaning of it? He
tugged and pushed weakly upon the mass that barred him from
escape. Who had imprisoned him? He recalled the vivid dream in
which he had seen Nadara stolen away by Thurg. The recollection
sent him frantically at the pile of shattered rock and loose
debris which choked the doorway.</p>

<p>To his chagrin he found himself too weak to direct any long
sustained effort against the obstacle. It occurred to him that he
must have been injured. Whoever imprisoned him must first have
beaten him. He felt of his head. Yes, there was a great gash, but
his touch told him that it was not a new one. How long, then, had
he been imprisoned? As he sat pondering this thing he became
aware of the gnawing of hunger and the craving of thirst within
his slowly awakening body. The sensations were almost painful. So
much so that they forced him to a realization of the fact that he
must have been without food or water for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Again he assailed the mass that held him prisoner, and as he
burrowed slowly into it the truth dawned upon him. He recalled
the rumblings of the Great Nagoola that had frightened Nadara the
night of the council. A terrific quake had done this thing.
Thandar shuddered as he thought of Nadara. Was she, too,
imprisoned in her cave, or had the worst happened to her?
Frantically now, he tore at the close-packed rubble. But he soon
discovered that not in ill-directed haste lay his means of
escape. Slowly and carefully, piece by piece, he must remove the
broken rock until he had tunneled through to the outer world.</p>

<p>Reason told him that he was not deeply buried, for the fact
that he lived and could breathe was sufficient proof that fresh
air was finding its way through the debris, which it could not
have done did the stuff lie before the cave in any considerable
thickness.</p>

<p>Weak as he was he could work but slowly, so that it was
several hours later before he caught the first glimpse of
daylight beyond the obstacle. After that he progressed more
rapidly, and presently he crawled through a small opening to view
the wreckage of the shattered cliff.</p>

<p>A flock of vultures rose from their hideous feast as the sight
of Thandar disturbed them. The man shuddered as he looked down
upon the grisly things from which they had risen. Forgetting his
hunger and his thirst he scrambled up over the tortured cliff
face to where Nadara's cave had been. Its mouth was buried as his
had been. Again he set to work, but this time it was easier. When
at last he had opened a way within he hesitated for fear of the
blighting sorrow that awaited him.</p>

<p>At last, nerving himself to the ordeal, he crawled within the
cave that had been Nadara's. Groping about in the darkness,
expecting each moment to feel the body of his loved one cold in
death, he at last covered the entire floor&mdash;there was no
body within.</p>

<p>Hastily he made his way to the face of the cliff again, and
then commenced a horrible and pitiful search among the ghastly
remnants of men and women that lay scattered about among the
tumbled rocks. But even here his search was vain, for the
ghoulish scavengers had torn from their prey every shred of their
former likenesses.</p>

<p>Weak, exhausted, sorrow ridden and broken, Thandar dragged
himself painfully to the little river. Here he quenched his
thirst and bathed his body. After, he sought food, and then he
crawled to a hole he knew of in the river bank, and curling up
upon the dead grasses within, slept the sun around.</p>

<p>Refreshed and strengthened by his sleep and the food that he
had taken Thandar emerged from his dark warren with renewed hope.
Nadara could not be dead! It was impossible. She must have
escaped and be wandering about the island. He would search for
her until he found her. But as day followed day and still no sign
of Nadara or any other living human being, he became painfully
convinced that he alone of the inhabitants of the island had
survived the cataclysm.</p>

<p>The thought of living on through a long life without her cast
him into the blackest pit of despair. He reproached heaven for
not having taken him as well, for without Nadara life was not
worth living. With the passage of time his grief grew more rather
than less acute. As it increased so too increased the horror of
his loneliness. The island became a hated thing&mdash;life a
mockery. The chances that a vessel would touch the shore again
during his lifetime seemed remote indeed, unless his father sent
out a relief party, but in his despair he did not even hope for
such a contingency.</p>

<p>He would not take his own life, though the temptation was
great, but he courted death in every form that the savage island
owned. He slept out upon the ground at night. He sought Nagoola
in his lair, and armed only with his light lance he leaped to
close quarters with every one of the great cats he could
find.</p>

<p>The wild boars, often as formidable as Nagoola himself, were
hunted now as they never had been hunted before. Thandar lived
high those days, and many were the panther pelts that lined his
new-found cave in the cliff beside the sea&mdash;the same cliff
in which Nadara had found shelter, and from whence she had gone
away with the search party from the <i>Priscilla</i>.</p>

<p>One day as Thandar was returning from the beach where he often
went to scan the horizon for a sail, he saw something moving at
the foot of his cliff. Thandar dropped behind a bush, watching. A
moment later the thing moved again, and Thandar saw that it was a
man. Instantly he sprang to his feet and ran forward. The days
that he had been without human companionship had seemed to drag
themselves into as many weary months. Now he had reached the
pinnacle of loneliness from which he would gladly have embraced
the devil had he come in human guise.</p>

<p>Thandar ran noiselessly. He was almost upon the man, a great,
hairy brute, before the fellow was aware of his presence. At
first the fellow turned to run, but when he saw that Thandar was
alone he remained to fight.</p>

<p>"I am Roof," he cried, "and I can kill you!"</p>

<p>The familiar primitive greeting no longer raised Thandar's
temperature or filled him with the fire of battle. He wanted
companionship now, not a quarrel.</p>

<p>"I am Thandar," he replied.</p>

<p>The slow-witted hulking brute recognized him, and stepped back
a pace. He was not so keen to fight now that he had learned the
identity of the man who faced him. He had seen Thandar in battle.
He had witnessed Thurg's defeat at the hands of this smooth-
skinned stranger.</p>

<p>"Let us not fight," continued Thandar. "We are alone upon the
island. I have seen no other than you since the Great Nagoola
came forth and destroyed the people. Let us be friends, hunting
together in peace. Otherwise one of us must kill the other and
thereafter live always alone until death releases him from his
terrible solitude."</p>

<p>Roof peered over Thandar's shoulder toward the wood behind
him.</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, have I not told you that all were killed but you and
I?"</p>

<p>"All were not killed," replied Roof. "But I will be friends
with Thandar. We will hunt together and cave together. Roof and
Thandar are brothers."</p>

<p>He stooped, and gathering a handful of grass advanced toward
the American. Thandar did likewise and when each had taken the
peace offering of the other and rubbed it upon his forehead the
ceremony of friendship was complete&mdash;simple but none the
less effectual, for each knew that the other would rather die
than disregard the primitive pact.</p>

<p>"You said all were not killed, Roof," said Thandar, the
ceremony over. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"All were not killed by the Great Nagoola," replied the bad
man. "Thurg was not killed, nor was she who was Thandar's
mate&mdash;she whom Thurg would have stolen."</p>

<p>"What?" Thandar almost screamed the question. "Nadara is not
dead?"</p>

<p>"Look," said Roof, and he led the way to the foot of the
cliff. "See!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Thandar, "I had noticed that body, but what of
it?"</p>

<p>"It was Thurg," explained Roof. "He sought to reach your mate,
who had taken refuge in that cave far above us. Then came some
strange men who made a great noise with sticks and Thurg fell
dead&mdash;the loud noise had killed him from a great distance.
Then came the strange men and she whom you call Nadara went away
with them."</p>

<p>"In which direction?" cried Thandar. "Where did they take
her?"</p>

<p>"They took her to the strange cliff in which they
dwelt&mdash;the one in which they came. Never saw man such a
thing as this cliff. It floated upon the face of the water. About
its face were many tiny caves, but the people did not come out of
these they came from the top of the cliff, and clambering down
the sides floated ashore in hollow things of wood. On top of the
cliff were two trees without leaves, and only very short upright
branches. When the cliff went away black smoke came out of it
from a short black stump of a tree between the two trees. It was
a very wonderful thing to see; but the most wonderful of all were
the noise-sticks that killed Thurg and Nagoola a long way
off."</p>

<p>Not half of Roof's narrative did Thandar hear. Through his
brain roared and thundered a single mighty thought: Nadara lives!
Nadara lives! Life took on a new meaning to him now. He trembled
at the thought of the chances he had been taking. Now, indeed,
must he live. He leaped up and down, laughing and shouting. He
threw his arms about the astonished Roof, whirling the troglodyte
about in a mad waltz. Nadara lives! Nadara lives!</p>

<p>Once again the sun shone, the birds sang, nature was her old,
happy, carefree self. Nadara was alive and among civilized men.
But then came a doubt.</p>

<p>"Did Nadara go willingly with these strangers," he asked Roof,
"or did they take her by force?"</p>

<p>"They did not take her by force," replied Roof. "They talked
with her for a time, and then she took the hand of one of the men
in hers, stroking it, and he placed his arm about her. Afterward
they walked slowly to the edge of the great water where they got
into the strange things that had brought them to the land, and
returned to their floating cliff. Presently the smoke came out,
as I have told you, and the cliff went away toward the edge of
the world. But they are all dead now."</p>

<p>"What?" yelled Thandar.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw the cliff sink, very slowly when it was a long way
off, until only the smoke was coming out of the water."</p>

<p>Thandar breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Point," he said, "to the place where the cliff sank beneath
the water."</p>

<p>Roof pointed almost due north.</p>

<p>"There," he said.</p>

<p>For days Thandar puzzled over the possible identity of the
ship and the men with whom Nadara had gone so willingly.
Doubtless some kindly mariner, hearing her story, had taken her
home, away from the terrors and loneliness of this unhappy
island. And now the man chafed to be after her, that he might
search the world for his lost love.</p>

<p>To wait for a ship appeared quite impossible to the impatient
Thandar, for he knew that a ship might never come. There was but
one alternative, and had Waldo Emerson been a less impractical
man in the world to which he had been born he would have cast
aside that single alternative as entirely beyond the pale of
possibility. But Waldo was only practical and wise in the savage
ways of the primitive life to which circumstance had forced him
to revert. And so he decided upon as fool-hardy and hair-brained
a venture as the mind of man might conceive. It was no less a
thing than to build a boat and set out upon the broad Pacific in
search of a civilized port or a vessel that might bear him to
such.</p>

<p>To Waldo it seemed quite practical. He realized of course that
the venture would be fraught with peril, but would it not be
better to die in an attempt to find his Nadara than to live on
forever in the hopelessness of this forgotten land?</p>

<p>And so he set to work to build a boat. He had no tools but his
crude knife and the razor the sailor of the <i>Sally Corwith</i>
had given him, so it was quite impossible for him to construct a
dugout. The possibilities that lie in fire did not occur to him.
Finally he hit upon what seemed the only feasible form of
construction.</p>

<p>With his knife he cut long, pliant saplings, and lesser
branches. These he fashioned into a framework of a boat. Roof
helped him, keenly interested in this new work. The ribs were
fastened to the keel and gunwale by thongs of panther skin, and
when the framework was completed panther skins were stretched
over it. The edges of the skin were sewn together with threads of
gut, as tightly as Thandar and Roof could pull them.</p>

<p>A mast was rigged well forward, and another panther skin from
which the fur had been scraped was fitted as a sail, square
rigged. For rudder Thandar fashioned a long slender sapling,
looped at one end, and the loop covered with skin laced tightly
on. This, he figured, would serve as both rudder and paddle, as
necessity demanded.</p>

<p>At last all was done. Together Thandar and Roof carried the
light, crude skiff to the ocean. They waded out beyond the surf,
and upon the crest of a receding swell they launched the thing,
Thandar leaping in as it floated upon the water.</p>

<p>The sail was not taken along for this trial. Thandar merely
wished to know that this craft would float, and right side up.
For a moment it did so, until the sea rushing in at the loose
seams filled it with water.</p>

<p>Thandar and Roof had great difficulty in dragging it out again
upon the beach. Roof now would have given up, but not so Thandar.
It is true that he was slightly disheartened, for he had set
great store upon the success of his little vessel.</p>

<p>After they had carried the frail thing beyond high tide
Thandar sat down upon the ground and for an hour he did naught
but stare at the leaky craft. Then he arose and calling to Roof
led him into the forest. For a mile they walked, and then Thandar
halted before a tree from the side of which a thick and sticky
stream was slowly oozing. Thandar had brought along a gourd, and
now with a small branch he commenced transferring the mass from
the side of the tree to the gourd. Roof helped him. In an hour
the gourd was filled. Then they returned to the skiff.</p>

<p>Leaving the gourd there Thandar and Roof walked to a clump of
heavy jungle grasses not far from the cliff where their cave lay.
Here Thandar gathered a great armful of the yellow, ripened
grass, telling Roof to do likewise. This they took back to the
skiff, where, by rolling it assiduously between their hands and
pounding it with stones they reduced it to a mass of soft, tough
fiber.</p>

<p>Now Thandar showed Roof how to twist this fiber into a loose,
fluffy rope, and when he had him well started he daubed the rope
with the rubbery fluid he had filched from the tree, and with a
sharp stick tucked it into every seam and crevice of the
skiff.</p>

<p>It took the better part of two days to accomplish this, and
when it was done and the gourd empty, the two men returned to the
tree and refilled it. This time they built a fire upon their
return to the skiff, Roof spinning a hard wood splinter rapidly
between toes and fingers in a little mass of tinder that lay in a
hollowed piece of wood. Presently a thin spiral of smoke arose
from the tinder, growing denser for a moment until of a sudden it
broke into flame.</p>

<p>The men piled twigs and branches upon the blaze until the fire
was well started. Then Thandar taking a ball of the viscous
matter from the gourd heated it in the flames, immediately
daubing the melting mass upon the outside of the skiff. In this
way, slowly and with infinite patience, the two at last succeeded
in coating the entire outer surface of the canoe with a
waterproof substance that might defy the action of water almost
indefinitely.</p>

<p>For three days Thandar let the coating dry, and then the craft
was given another trial. The man's heart was in his throat as the
canoe floated upon the crest of a great wave and he leaped into
it.</p>

<p>But a moment later he shouted in relief and delight&mdash;the
thing floated like a cork, nor was there the slightest leak
discernible. For half an hour Thandar paddled about the harbor,
and then he returned for the sail. This too, though rather heavy
and awkward, worked admirably, and the balance of the day he
spent in sailing, even venturing out into the ocean.</p>

<p>Much of the time he paddled, for Waldo Emerson knew more of
the galleys of ancient Greece than he did of sails or sailing, so
that for the most part he sailed with the wind, paddling when he
wished to travel in another direction. But, withal, his attempt
filled him with delight, and he could scarce wait to be off
toward civilization and Nadara.</p>

<p>The next two days were spent in collecting food and water,
which Thandar packed in numerous gourds, sealing the mouths with
the rubbery substance such as he had used to waterproof his
craft. The flesh of the wild hog, and deer, and bird he cut in
narrow strips and dried over a slow fire; in this work Roof
assisted him, and at last all was in readiness for the
venture.</p>

<p>The day of his departure dawned bright and clear. A gentle
south wind gave promise of great speed toward the north. Thandar
was wild with hope and excitement. Roof was to accompany him, but
at the last moment the nerve of the troglodyte failed him, and he
ran away and hid in the forest.</p>

<p>It was just as well, thought Thandar, for now his provisions
would last twice as long. And so he set out upon his perilous
adventure, braving the mighty Pacific in a frail and unseaworthy
cockleshell with all the assurance and confidence that is ever
born in ignorance.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb10" id="chb10">X. &mdash; THE HEAD-
HUNTERS</a></h2>

<p class="first">Nature, so far, had been kind to Waldo Emerson
Smith-Jones. No high winds or heavy seas had assailed him, and he
had been upon the water for three days now. The wind had held
steadily out of the south, varying but a few points during this
time but even so Waldo Emerson was commencing to doubt and to
worry. His supply of water was running dangerously low, his food
supply would last but a few days longer; and as yet he had
sighted no sail, nor seen any land. Furthermore, he had not the
remotest conception of how he might retrace his way to the island
he had just quitted. He could only sail before the wind. Should
the wind veer around into the north he might, by chance, be blown
back to the island. Otherwise he never could reach it. And he was
beginning to wonder if he had not been a trifle too precipitate
in his abandonment of land.</p>

<p>In common with most other landsmen, Waldo Emerson had little
conception of the vastness of the broad reaches of unbroken water
wildernesses that roll in desolate immensity over three-quarters
of the globe. His recollection of maps pictured the calm and
level blue Pacific dotted, especially in the south seas, with
many islands. Their names, often, were quite reassuring. He
recollected, among others, such as the Society Islands, the
Friendly Islands, Christmas Island. He hoped that he would land
upon one of these. There were so many islands upon the maps, and
they seemed so close together that he was not a little mystified
that he had failed to sight several hundred before this.</p>

<p>And ships! It appeared incredible that he should have seen not
a single sail. He distinctly recalled the atlas he had examined
prior to embarking upon his health cruise. The Pacific had been
lined in all directions with routes of long established steamer
lanes, and in between, Waldo had felt, the ocean must be dotted
with innumerable tramps that come and go between the countless
ports that fringe the major sea.</p>

<p>And yet for three days nothing had broken the dull monotony of
the vast circle of which he was always the center and the sole
occupant. In three days, thought Waldo, he must have covered an
immense distance.</p>

<p>And three more days dragged their weary lengths. The wind had
died to the faintest of breezes. The canoe was just making
headway and that was all. The water was gone. The food nearly so.
Waldo was suffering from lack of the former. The pitiless sun
beating down upon him increased his agony. He stretched his
panther skin across the stern and hid beneath it from the torrid
rays. And there he lay until darkness brought relief.</p>

<p>During the night the wind sprang up again, but this time from
the west. It rose and with it rose the sea. The man, clinging to
his crude steering oar, struggled to keep the light craft
straight before the wind which was now howling fearfully while
great waves, hungry and wide-jawed, raced after him like a pack
of ravenous wolves.</p>

<p>Thandar knew that the unequal struggle against the mighty
forces of the elements could not endure for long. It seemed that
each fierce gust of brutal wind must tear his frail boat to
shreds, and yet it was the very lightness of the thing that saved
it, for it rode upon the crests of the waves, blown forward at
terrific velocity like a feather before the hurricane.</p>

<p>In Thandar's heart was no terror&mdash;only regret that he
might never again see his mother, his father, or his Nadara. Yet
the night wore on and still he fled before the storm. The sky was
overcast&mdash;the darkness was impenetrable. He imagined all
about him still the same wide, tenantless circle of water, only
now storm torn and perpendicular and black, instead of peacefully
horizontal, and soothingly blue-green. And then, even as he was
thinking about this there rose before him a thunderous booming
loud above the frenzied bedlam of the storm, his boat was lifted
high in the air to dive headforemost into what might be a
bottomless abyss for all Thandar knew. But it was not bottomless.
The canoe struck something and stopped suddenly, pitching Thandar
into a boiling maelstrom. A great wave picked him up, carrying
with race-horse velocity within its crest. He felt himself hurled
pitilessly upon smooth, hard sand. The water tried to drag him
back, but he fought with toes and fingers, clutching at the
surface of the stuff upon which he had been dropped. Then the
wave abandoned him and raced swiftly back into the sea.</p>

<p>Thandar was exhausted, but he knew that he must crawl up out
of the way of the surf, or be dragged back by the next roller.
What he had searched for in vain through six long days he had run
down in the midst of a Stygian night. He had found land! Or, to
be more explicit, land had got in front of him and he had run
into it. He had commenced to wonder if some terrible convulsions
of nature had not swallowed up all the land in the world, leaving
only a waste of desolate water. He forgot his hunger and his
thirst in the happiness of the knowledge that once more he was
upon land. He wondered a little what land it might be. He hoped
that dawn would reveal the chimneys and steeples of a near-by
city. And then, exhausted, he fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>It was the sun shining down into his upturned face that awoke
him. He was lying upon his back beside a clump of bushes a little
way above the beach. He was about to rise and survey the new
world into which fate and a hurricane had hurled him, when he
heard a familiar sound upon the opposite side of his bush. It was
the movement of an animal creeping through the long grass.</p>

<p>Thandar, the cave man, came noiselessly to his hands and
knees, peering cautiously through the intervening network of
branches. What he saw sent his hand groping for his wooden sword
with its fire-hardened point. There, not five paces from him, was
a man going cautiously upon all fours. It was the most horrible
appearing man that Thandar had ever seen&mdash;even Thurg
appeared lovely by comparison. The creature's ears were split and
heavy ornaments had dragged them down until the lobes rested upon
its shoulders. The face was terribly marked with cicatrices and
tattooing. The teeth were black and pointed. A head-dress of long
feathers waved and nodded above the hideous face. There was much
tattooing upon the arms and legs and abdomen; the breasts were
circled with it. In a belt about the waist lay a sword in its
scabbard. In the man's hand was a long spear.</p>

<p>The warrior was creeping stealthily upon something at
Thandar's left. The latter looked in the direction the other's
savage gaze was bent. Through the bushes he could barely discern
a figure moving toward them along the edge of the beach. The
warrior had passed him now and Thandar stood erect the better to
obtain a view of the fellow's quarry.</p>

<p>Now he saw it plainly&mdash;a man strangely garbed in many
colors. A yellow jacket, soiled and worn, covered the upper part
of his body. Strange designs, very elaborate, were embroidered
upon the garment which reached barely to the fellow's waist.
Beneath was a red sash in which were stuck a long pistol and a
wicked-looking knife. Baggy blue trousers reached to the bare
ankles and feet. A strip of crimson cloth wound around the head
completed the strange garmenture. The features of the man were
Mongolian.</p>

<p>Thandar could see the warrior pause as it became evident that
the other was approaching directly toward his place of
concealment, but at the last moment the unconscious quarry turned
sharply to his right down upon the beach. He had discovered the
wreck of Thandar's canoe and was going to investigate it.</p>

<p>The move placed Thandar almost between the two. Suddenly the
native rose to his feet&mdash;his victim's back was toward him.
Grasping his spear in his left hand he drew his wicked-looking
sword and emerged cautiously from the bushes. At the same moment
the man upon the beach wheeled quickly as though suddenly warned
of his danger. The native, discovered, leaped forward with raised
sword. The man snatched his pistol from his belt, leveled it at
the on-rushing warrior and pulled the trigger. There was a futile
click&mdash;that was all. The weapon had missed fire.</p>

<p>Instantly, a third element was projected into the fray.
Thandar, seeing a more direct link to civilization in the
strangely apparelled Mongol than in the naked savage, leaped to
the assistance of the former. With drawn sword he rushed out upon
the savage. The wild man turned at Thandar's cry, which he had
given to divert the fellow's attention from his now almost
helpless victim.</p>

<p>Thandar knew nothing of the finer points of sword play. He was
ignorant of the wickedness of a Malay parang&mdash;the keen,
curved sword of the head-hunter, so he rushed in upon the savage
as he would have upon one of Thurg's near-men.</p>

<p>The very impetuosity of his attack awed the native. For a
moment he stood his ground, and then, with a cry of terror turned
to flee; but he had failed to turn soon enough. Thandar was upon
him. The sharp point entered his back beneath the left shoulder-
blade, and behind it were the weight and sinews of the cave man.
With a shriek the savage lunged forward, clutching at the cruel
point that now protruded from his breast. When he touched the
earth he was dead.</p>

<p>Thandar drew his sword from the body of the head-hunter and
turned toward the man he had rescued. The latter was approaching,
taking excitedly. It was evident that he was thanking Thandar,
but no word of his strange tongue could the American understand.
Thandar shook his head to indicate that he was unfamiliar with
the other's language, and then the latter dropped into pidgin
English, which, while almost as unintelligible to the cultured
Bostonian, still contained the battered remnants of some few
words with which he was familiar.</p>

<p>Thandar depreciated his act by means of gestures, immediately
following these with signs to indicate he was hungry and thirty.
The stranger evidently understood him, for he motioned for him to
follow, leading the way back along the beach in the direction
from which he had come.</p>

<p>Before starting, however, he had pointed to the wreck of
Thandar's canoe and then toward Thandar, nodding his head
questioningly as to ask if the boat belonged to the cave man.</p>

<p>Around the end of the promontory they came upon a little cove
beside the beach of which Thandar saw a camp of nearly a score of
men similar in appearance to his guide. These were preparing
breakfast beside the partially completed hull of a rather large
boat they seemed to have been building.</p>

<p>At sight of Thandar they looked their astonishment, but after
hearing the story of their fellow they greeted the cave man
warmly, furnishing him with food and water in abundance.</p>

<p>For three days Thandar worked with these men upon their craft,
picking up their story slowly with a slow acquirement of a bowing
acquaintance with the bastard tongue they used when speaking with
him. He soon became aware of the fact that fate had thrown him
among a band of pirates. There were Chinese, Japanese and Malays
among them&mdash;the off-scourings of the south seas; men who had
become discredited even among the villainous pirates of their own
lands, and had been forced to join their lots in this remoter and
less lucrative field, under an unhung ruffian, Tsao Ming, the
Chinaman whose life Thandar had saved.</p>

<p>He also learned that the storm that had cast them upon this
shore nearly a month before had demolished their prahu, and what
with the building of another and numerous skirmishes with the
savages they had had a busy time of it.</p>

<p>Only yesterday while a party of them had been hunting a mile
or two inland they had been attacked by savages who had killed
two and captured one of their number.</p>

<p>They told Thandar that these savages were the most ferocious
of head-hunters, but like the majority of their kind preferred
ambushing an unwary victim to meeting him in fair fight in the
open. Thandar did not doubt but that the latter mode of warfare
would have been entirely to the liking of his piratical friends,
for never in his life had he dreamed, even, of so ferocious and
warlike a band as was comprised in this villainous and
bloodthirsty aggregation. But the constant nervous tension under
which they had worked, never knowing at what instant an arrow or
lance would leap from the shades of the jungle to pierce them in
the back, had reduced them to a state of fear that only a speedy
departure from the island could conquer.</p>

<p>Their boat was almost completed; two more days would see them
safely launched upon the ocean, and Tsao Ming had promised
Thandar that he would carry him to a civilized port from which he
could take a steamer on his return to America.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the third day since his arrival among
the pirates, the men were suddenly startled by the appearance of
an exhausted and blood-smeared apparition amongst them. From the
nearby jungle the man had staggered to fall halfway across the
clearing, spent.</p>

<p>It was Boloon&mdash;he who had been captured by the head-
hunters the day before Thandar had been cast upon the shore.
Revived with food and water the fellow told a most extraordinary
tale. Even from the meager scraps that were afterward translated
into pidgin English for Thandar, the Bostonian learned that
Boloon had been dragged far inland to a village of considerable
size.</p>

<p>Here he had been placed in a room of one of the long houses to
await the pleasure of the chief. It was hinted that he was to be
tortured before his head was removed to grace the rafters of the
chief's palace.</p>

<p>The remarkable portion of his tale related to a strange temple
to which he had been dragged and thrown at the feet of a white
goddess. Tsao Ming and the other pirates were much mystified by
this part of the story, for Boloon insisted that the goddess was
white with a mass of black hair, and that her body was covered in
the pelt of a magnificent black panther.</p>

<p>Though Tsao Ming pointed out that there were no panthers upon
this island Boloon could not be shaken. He had seen with his own
eyes, and he knew. Furthermore, he argued, there were no white
goddesses upon the island, and yet the woman he had seen was
white.</p>

<p>When this strange tale was retold to Thandar he could not but
recall that Nadara had worn a black panther skin, but of course
it could not be Nadara&mdash;that was impossible. But yet he
asked for a further description of the goddess&mdash;the color of
her eyes and hair&mdash;the proportions of her body&mdash;her
height.</p>

<p>To all these questions Boloon gave replies that but caused
Thandar's excitement to wax stronger. And then came the final
statement that set him in a frenzy of hope and apprehension.</p>

<p>"Upon her left hand was a great diamond," said Boloon.</p>

<p>Thandar turned toward Tsao Ming.</p>

<p>"I go inland to the temple," he said, "to see who this white
goddess may be. If you wait two days for me and I return you
shall have as much gold as you ask in payment. If you do not
wait, repair my canoe and hide it in the bushes where the man hid
who would have killed you but for Thandar."</p>

<p>"I shall wait three days," replied Tsao Ming. "Nor will I take
a single FUN in pay. You saved the life of Tsao Ming&mdash;that
is not soon to be forgotten. I would send men with you, but they
would not go. They are afraid of the head-hunters. Too, will I
repair your canoe against your coming after the third day; but,"
and he shrugged, "you will not come upon the third day, nor upon
the fourth, nor ever, Thandar. It is better that you forget the
foolish story of the frightened Boloon and come away from the
accursed land with Tsao Ming."</p>

<p>But Thandar would not relinquish his intention, and so he
parted with the pirates after receiving from Boloon explicit
directions for his journey toward the mysterious temple and the
white goddess who might be Nadara; and yet who could not be.</p>

<p>Straight into the tangled jungle he plunged, carrying the
spear and parang of the head-hunter he had killed, and in the
string about his loins one of the long pistols of a dead pirate.
This latter Tsao Ming had forced upon him with a supply of
ammunition.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb11" id="chb11">XI. &mdash; THE RESCUE</a></h2>

<p class="first">It was dusk of the second day when Thandar,
following the directions given him by Boloon, came to the edge of
the little clearing within which rose the dingy outlines of many
long houses raised upon piles. Before the village ran a river.
Many times had Thandar crossed and recrossed this stream, for he
had become lost twice upon the way and had to return part way
each time to pick up his trail.</p>

<p>In the center of the village the man could see the outlines of
a loftier structure rearing its head above those of the others.
As darkness fell Thandar crept closer toward his goal&mdash;the
large building which Boloon had described as the temple.</p>

<p>Beneath the high raised houses the cave man crept, disturbing
pigs and chickens as he went, but their noise was no uncommon
thing, and rather than being a menace to his safety it
safeguarded him, for it hid the noise of his own advance.</p>

<p>At last he came beneath a house nearest the temple. The moon
was full and high. Her brilliant light flooded the open spaces
between the buildings, casting into black darkness the shadows
beneath. In one of these Thandar lurked. He saw that the temple
was guarded. Before its only entrance squatted two warriors. How
was he to pass them?</p>

<p>He moved to the end of the shadow of the house beneath which
he spied as far from the guards as possible; but still discovery
seemed certain were he to attempt to rush across the intervening
space. He was at a loss as to what next to do. It seemed foolish
to risk all now upon a bold advance&mdash;the time for such a
risk would be when he had found the goddess and learned if she
were Nadara, or another; but how might he cross that strip of
moonlight and enter the temple past the two guards without
risk?</p>

<p>He moved silently to the far end of the building, in the
shadows of which he watched. For some time he stood looking
across at his goal, so near, and yet seemingly infinitely further
from attainment than the day he had left the coast in search of
it. He noted the long poles stuck into the ground at irregular
intervals about the structure. He wondered at the significance of
the rude carving upon them, of the barbaric capitals sometimes
topped by the headdress of a savage warrior, again by a dried and
grinning skull, or perhaps the rudely chiseled likeness of a
hideous human face.</p>

<p>Upon many of the poles were hung shields, weapons, clothing
and earthenware vessels. One especially was so weighted down by
its heterogeneous burden that it leaned drunkenly against the
eaves of the temple. Thandar's eye followed it upward to where it
touched the crudely shingled roof. The suggestion was
sufficient&mdash;where his eye had climbed he would climb. There
was only the moonlight to make the attempt perilous. If the
clouds would but come! But there was no indication of clouds in
the star shot sky.</p>

<p>He looked toward the guards. They lolled at the opposite end
of the temple, only one of them being visible. The other was
hidden by the angle of the building. The back of the fellow whom
Thandar could see was turned toward the cave man. If they
remained thus for a moment he could reach the roof unnoticed. But
then there was the danger of discovery from one of the other
buildings. An occasional whiff of tobacco smoke told him that
some of the men were still awake upon the verandas where most of
the youths and bachelors slept.</p>

<p>Thandar crawled to where he could see the only veranda which
directly faced the portion of the temple he had chose for his
attempted entrance. For an hour he watched the rising and falling
glow of the cigarettes of two of the native men, and listened to
the low hum of their conversation. The hour seemed to drag into
an eternity, but at last the glowing butt of first one cigarette
and then another was flicked over into the grass and silence
reigned upon the veranda.</p>

<p>For half an hour longer Thandar waited. The guards before the
temple still squatted as before. The one Thandar could see seemed
to have fallen asleep, for his head drooped forward upon his
breast.</p>

<p>The time had come. There was no need of further delay or
reconnaissance&mdash;if he was to be discovered that would be the
end of it, and it would not profit him one iota to know a second
or so in advance of the alarm that he had been detected. So he
did not waste time in stealthy advance, or in much looking this
way and that. Instead he moved swiftly, though silently, directly
across the open, moonlit space to the foot of the leaning pole.
He did not cast a glance behind nor to the right nor left. His
whole attention was riveted upon the thing in hand.</p>

<p>Thandar had scaled the rickety, toppling saplings of the cliff
dweller for so long that this pole offered no greater
difficulties to him than would an ordinary staircase to you or
me. First he tested it with eyes and hands to know that it rested
securely at the top and that beneath his weight it would not move
noisily out of its present position.</p>

<p>Assured that it seemed secure, Thandar ran up it with the
noiseless celerity of a cat. Gingerly he stepped upon the roof,
not knowing the manner of its construction, which might be weak
thatching that would give beneath him and precipitate him into
the interior beneath.</p>

<p>To his surprise and consternation he found that the roof was
of wood, and quite as solid as one could imagine. It had been his
plan to enter the temple from above, but now it seemed that he
was to be thwarted, for he could not hope to cut silently through
a wooden roof with his parang in the few hours that intervened
before dawn.</p>

<p>He stooped to examine the roof minutely with eyes and fingers.
The moonlight was brilliant. In it he could see quite well. He
pulled away the thin palm frond thatch. Beneath were shingles
hand hewn from billian. In each was a small square black hole
through which passed a strip of rattan that bound the shingle to
the frame of the roof.</p>

<p>Thandar lifted away the thatching over a little space some two
feet square. Then he inserted the point of his keen parang
beneath a rattan tie string, and an instant later had lifted
aside a shingle. Another and another followed the first until an
opening in the roof had been made large enough to easily admit
his body.</p>

<p>Thandar leaned over and peered into the darkness beneath. He
could see nothing. His own body was between the moon and the hole
in the roof, shutting out the rays of the satellite from the
interior.</p>

<p>The man lowered his legs cautiously over the edge of the hole.
Feeling about, his feet came in contact with a rafter. A moment
later his whole body had disappeared within the temple. Clinging
to the edge of the hole with one hand, Thandar squatted upon the
rafter above the temple floor.</p>

<p>Now that his body no longer closed the aperture in the roof
the moonlight poured through it throwing a brilliant flood upon a
portion of the floor at the opposite side of the interior. The
balance was feebly lighted by the diffused moonlight.</p>

<p>The temple seemed to consist of a single large room. In the
center was a raised platform, and also about the walls. From the
rafters hung baskets containing human skulls&mdash;one hung
directly in the moonlight beneath Thandar. He could see its
grisly contents plainly.</p>

<p>His eyes followed the moonlight toward the area which it
touched upon the far side of the room. It reminded Waldo Emerson
of a spot light thrown from the gallery of theater upon the
stage.</p>

<p>Directly in the center of the light a woman lay asleep upon
the platform. Thandar's heart stood still. About her figure was
wrapped the glossy hide of Nagoola. Over one bare, brown arm
spilled a wealth of thick, black hair, fine as silk, upon the
third finger of the left hand blazed a large solitaire. The
woman's face was turned toward the wall&mdash;but Thandar knew
that he could not be mistaken&mdash;it was Nadara.</p>

<p>From the rafter upon which he squatted to the floor below was
not over twelve or fifteen feet. Thandar swung downward, clinging
to the rafter with his hands, and dropped, cat-like, upon his
naked feet to the floor below.</p>

<p>The almost noiseless descent was sufficient, however, to
awaken the sleeper. With the quickness of a panther she swung
around and was upon her feet facing the man almost the instant he
alighted. The moonlight was now full upon her face. Thandar
rushed forward to take her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Nadara!" he whispered. "Thank God!"</p>

<p>The girl shrank back. She recognized the voice and the figure;
but&mdash;her Thandar was dead! How could it be that he had
returned from death? She was frightened.</p>

<p>The man saw the evident terror of her action, and paused.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Nadara?" he asked. "Don't you know me?
Don't you know Thandar?"</p>

<p>"Thandar is dead," she whispered.</p>

<p>The man laughed. In a few words he explained that he had been
stunned, but not killed, by the earthquake. Then he came to her
side and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Do I feel like a dead man?" he asked.</p>

<p>She put her arms about his neck and drew his face down to
hers. She was sobbing. Thandar's back was toward the doorway of
the temple. Nadara was facing it. As she raised her eyes to his
again her face when deadly white, and she dragged and pushed him
suddenly out of the brilliant patch of moonlight.</p>

<p>"The guard!" she whispered. "I just saw something move beyond
the door."</p>

<p>Thandar stepped behind one of the tree trunks that supported
the roof, looking toward the entrance. Yes, there was a man even
now coming into the temple. His eyes were wide with surprise as
he glanced upward to the hole in the roof. Then he looked in the
direction of the platform upon which Nadara had been sleeping.
When he saw that it was empty he ran back to the doorway and
called his companion.</p>

<p>As he did so Thandar grasped Nadara's hand and drew her around
the opposite side of the temple where the shadows were blackest,
toward the doorway. They had reached the end of the room when the
two warriors came running in, jabbering excitedly. One of them
had passed halfway across the temple, and Thandar and Nadara had
almost reached the door when the second savage caught sight of
them. With a cry of warning to his companion he turned upon them
with drawn parang.</p>

<p>As the fellow rushed forward Thandar drew the pistol the
pirates had given him and fired point blank at the fellow's
breast. With a howl the man staggered back and collapsed upon the
floor. Then his fellow rushed to the attack.</p>

<p>Thandar had no time to reload. He handed the weapon to
Nadara.</p>

<p>"In the pouch at my right side are cartridges," he said. "Get
out several of them, and when I can I will reload."</p>

<p>As he spoke they had been edging toward the doorway. From the
street beyond they could already hear excited voices raised in
questioning. The shot had aroused the village.</p>

<p>Now the fellow with the parang was upon them. Thandar was
clumsy with the unaccustomed weapon with which he tried to meet
the attack of the skilled savage. There could have been but one
outcome of the unequal struggle had not Nadara, always quick-
witted and resourceful, snatched a long spear from the temple
wall.</p>

<p>As she dragged it down there fell with it a clattering skull
that broke upon the floor between the fighters. A howl of dismay
and rage broke from the lips of the head-hunter. This was
sacrilege. The holy of the holies had been profaned. With renewed
ferocity he leaped to close quarters with Thandar, but at the
same instant Nadara lunged the sharp pointed spear into his side,
his guard dropped and Thandar's parang fell full upon his
skull.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried Nadara. "Make your escape the way you came.
There is no hope for you if you remain. I will tell them that the
two guards fought between themselves for me&mdash;that one killed
the other, and that I shot the victor to save myself. They will
believe me&mdash;I will tell them that I have always had the
pistol hidden beneath my robe. Good-bye, my Thandar. We cannot
both escape. If you will remain we may both die&mdash;you
certainly."</p>

<p>Thandar shook his head vehemently.</p>

<p>"We shall both go&mdash;or both die," he replied.</p>

<p>Nadara pressed his hand.</p>

<p>"I am glad," was all she said.</p>

<p>The savages were pouring from their long houses. The street
before the temple was filling with them. To attempt to escape in
that direction would have been but suicidal.</p>

<p>"Is there no other exit?" asked Thandar.</p>

<p>"There is a small window in the back of the temple," replied
Nadara, "in a little room that is sometimes used as a prison for
those who are to die, but it lets out into another street which
by this time is probably filled with natives."</p>

<p>"There is the floor," cried Thandar. "We will try the floor
there."</p>

<p>He ran to the main entrance to the temple and closed the
doors. Then he dragged the two corpses before them. And a long
wooden bench. There was no other movable thing in the temple that
had any considerable weight.</p>

<p>This done he took Nadara's hand and together the two ran for
the little room. Here again they barricaded the door, and Thandar
turned toward the floor. With his parang he pried up a
board&mdash;it was laid but roughly upon the light logs that were
the beams. Another was removed with equal ease, and then he
lowered Nadara to the ground beneath the temple.</p>

<p>Clinging to the piling, Thandar replaced the boards above his
head before he, too, dropped to the ground at Nadara's side. The
streets upon either side of the temple were filled with savages.
They could hear them congregating before the entrance to the
temple where all was now quiet and still within. They were
bolstering their courage by much shouting to the point that would
permit them to enter and investigate. They called the names of
the guards, but there was no response.</p>

<p>"Give me the pistol," said Thandar.</p>

<p>He loaded it, keeping several cartridges ready in his hand.
Then, with Nadara at his side, he crept to the back of the
temple. Pigs, routed form their slumbers, grunted and complained.
A dog growled at them. Thandar silenced it with a cut from his
parang. When they reached the edge of the shadow beneath the
temple they saw that there were only a few natives upon this side
of the structure, and they were hurrying rapidly toward the front
of the building. A hundred yards away was the jungle.</p>

<p>Now a sudden quiet fell upon the horde before the temple
doors. There was the sound of hammering, then a pushing, scraping
noise, and presently shouts of savage rage&mdash;the dead bodies
of the guardsmen had been discovered. Now, from above, came the
padding of naked feet running through the temple. The street
behind was momentarily deserted.</p>

<p>"Now!" whispered Thandar.</p>

<p>He seized Nadara's hand, and together the two raced from
beneath the temple out into the moonlight and across the
intervening space between the long houses toward the jungle.
Halfway across, a belated native, emerging from the veranda of a
nearby house, saw them. He set up a terrific yell and dashed
toward them.</p>

<p>Thandar's pistol roared, and the savage dropped; but the
signal had been given and before the two reached the jungle a
screaming horde of warriors was upon their heels.</p>

<p>Thandar was confused. He had lost his bearings since entering
the village and the temple. He turned toward Nadara.</p>

<p>"I do not know the way to the coast," he cried.</p>

<p>The girl took his hand.</p>

<p>"Follow me," she said, and to the memories of each leaped the
recollection of the night she had led him through the forest from
the cliffs of the bad men. Once again was Waldo Emerson Smith-
Jones, the learned, indebted to the greater wisdom of the
unlettered cave girl for his salvation.</p>

<p>Unerringly Nadara ran through the tangled jungle in the
direction of the coast. Though she had been but once over the way
she followed the direct line as unerringly as though each tree
was blazed and sign posts marked each turn.</p>

<p>Behind them came the noise of the pursuit, but always Nadara
and Thandar fled ahead of it, not once did it gain upon them
during the long hours of flight.</p>

<p>It was noon before they reached the coast. They came out at
the camp of the pirates, but to Thandar's dismay it was deserted.
Tsao Ming had awaited the allotted time and gone. If Thandar had
but known it, the picturesque cutthroat had overstayed the
promised period, and had but scarely left when the fugitives had
emerged from the jungle beside the beach. In fact his rude craft
was but out of sight beyond the northern promontory. A pistol
shot would have recalled him; but Thandar did not know it, and so
he turned dejectedly to search for his hidden canoe.</p>

<p>It lay behind the little clump of bushes that had hidden
Thandar the morning that he had saved Tsao Ming's life, several
hundred yards to the south.</p>

<p>All signs of pursuit had now ceased, and so the two walked
slowly in the direction of the craft. They found it just where
Tsao Ming had promised that it would be. It was well and
staunchly repaired, and in addition contained a goodly supply of
food and water. Thandar blessed Tsao Ming, the unhung
murderer.</p>

<p>Together they dragged the frail thing to the water's edge, and
were about to shove it out when, with a chorus of savage yells, a
score or more of the head-hunters leaped from the jungle and bore
down upon them. Thandar turned to meet them with drawn
pistol.</p>

<p>"Get the canoe into the water, Nadara," he called to the girl.
"I will hold them off until it is launched, then we may be able
to reach deep water before they can overtake us."</p>

<p>Nadara struggled with the unwieldy boat which the rollers
picked up and hurled back upon her each time she essayed to
launch it. From the corner of his eyes Thandar saw the
difficulties that the girl was having. Already the horde was
halfway across the beach, running rapidly toward them. The man
feared to fire except at close range since his unfamiliarity with
firearms rendered him an extremely poor shot. However, it was
evident that Nadara could not launch the thing alone, and so
Thandar turned his pistol upon the approaching savages, pulled
the trigger, and wheeled to assist the girl.</p>

<p>More by chance than skill the bullet lodged in the body of the
foremost head-hunter. The fellow rolled screaming to the sand,
and as one his companions came to a sudden halt. But seeing that
Thandar was busy with the boat and not appearing to intend to
follow up his shot they presently resumed the charge.</p>

<p>Thandar and Nadara were having all that they could attend to
with the canoe and so the savages came to the water's edge before
they realized their proximity. When he saw them, Thandar wheeled
and fired again, then picking the canoe up bodily above his head
he struggled out through the surf, Nadara walking by his side,
steadying him.</p>

<p>After them came the savages&mdash;perhaps half a dozen of the
bolder, when suddenly a great roller caught them all, pursuers
and pursued, sweeping them out into deep water. Thandar and
Nadara clung to the canoe, but the head-hunters were dragged down
by the undertow.</p>

<p>Upon the beach, yelling, threatening and gesticulating, danced
thirty or forty baffled savages; but now Thandar and Nadara had
crawled into the craft, which the outgoing tide was carrying
rapidly from shore, and with the aid of the paddle were soon
safely out upon the bosom of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Safely?</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb12" id="chb12">XII. &mdash; PIRATES</a></h2>

<p class="first">As the tide and wind carried the light craft out
to sea, and the shore line sank beneath the horizon behind them,
Waldo Emerson looked out upon the future as he did upon the
tumbling waste of desolate water encircling them, with utter
hopelessness.</p>

<p>Once before he had passed by a miracle through the many-sided
menaces of the sea; but that he should be so fortunate again he
could not hope. And now Nadara was with him. Before, only his
suffering and death had been possible; now he must face the
greater agony of witnessing Nadara's.</p>

<p>The wind, blowing a steady gale, was raising a considerable
sea. The vast billows rolled, one upon the heels of another, with
the regularity of infantry units doubling at review. The wind and
the sea seemed to have been made to order for the frail vessel
that bore Thandar and Nadara. It rode the long, ponderous waves
like a cork; its crude sail caught the wind and bellied bravely
to it, driving the boat swiftly over the water.</p>

<p>And scarce had the shore behind them sunk forever from their
sight than dead ahead another shore line showed. Thandar could
scarce believe his eyes. He rubbed them and looked again. Then he
asked Nadara to look.</p>

<p>"What is that ahead?" he asked.</p>

<p>The girl half rose with an exclamation of joy.</p>

<p>"Land!" she cried.</p>

<p>And land it was. The wind, driving them madly, carried them
toward the north end of what appeared to be a large island. Angry
breakers pounded a rocky coast line. To strike there would mean
instant death to them both. But would they strike? As they neared
the point of the island it became evident to Thandar that they
would be borne past it. Could he hope to stem the speed of the
little craft and turn it back into the sheltered water in the lee
of the land? The chances were more than even that the canoe would
capsize the instant he cut away the sail and attempted to paddle
across the wind; as would be necessary to come about the end of
the island.</p>

<p>But there seemed no other way. He handed his parang to Nadara,
telling her to be ready to cut the rawhide strips that supported
the sail the instant that he gave the word. With his paddle
clutched tightly in his hands he knelt in the stern, watching the
progress of the canoe past the rocky point.</p>

<p>At this extremity of the island a narrow tongue of land ran
far out into the sea. It was past the outer point of this tongue
that the canoe was racing. When they had passed Thandar realized
the rashness of attempting to turn the canoe into the trough of
the sea even for the little distance that would have been
necessary to make the shelter of the point, where, almost within
reach, he could see the peaceful bosom of unruffled water lying
safely behind the island.</p>

<p>And yet as he looked ahead upon the limitless waste of ocean
before them he knew that one risk was not greater than the other,
and then an alternative plan occurred to him. He would run a
short distance past the point and then turn almost directly back
and attempt to paddle the canoe into the calm water running
nearly into the face of the wind, thus avoiding the dangers of
the trough.</p>

<p>There was but a single drawback to this plan&mdash;the
question of his ability to drive the canoe against the gale. At
least it was worth trying. He gave Nadara the word to cut down
the sail, and at the same instant, the canoe being upon the crest
of a wave, he bent to the paddle. As the panther skin tumbled at
the foot of the rough mast the nose of the craft swung around in
reply to Thandar's vigorous strokes.</p>

<p>So intent were both upon the life and death struggle that they
were waging with the elements that neither saw the long, low-
lying craft that shot from the mouth of a small harbor behind
them as they came into view upon the lee side of the island.</p>

<p>For a moment the canoe hung broadside to the wind. Thandar
struggled frantically to carry it about. Down they dropped into
the trough of a great sea. Above them hung the overleaning tower
of the wave's crest ready to topple upon them its tons of water.
The canoe rose, still broadside, almost to the crest of the
wave&mdash;then the thing broke upon them.</p>

<p>When Thandar came to the surface his first thought was for
Nadara. He looked about as he shook the water from his eyes.
Almost at his side Nadara's head rose from the sea. As her eyes
met his a smile touched her lips.</p>

<p>"This is better," she shouted. "Now we can reach the shore,"
and turning she struck out for land.</p>

<p>Just behind her swam Thandar. He knew that Nadara was like a
fish in water, but he doubted her ability as he doubted his own
to reach the shore in the face of both wind and tide. A wave
carried them high in air, and from its crest both saw
simultaneously a long craft in the hollow beneath them, and noted
the fierce aspect of her crew.</p>

<p>Nadara, fearing all men but Thandar, would have attempted to
elude the craft, but the glimpse that the man had of those aboard
her convinced him that he had fallen by good fortune into the
company of Tsao Ming and his crew.</p>

<p>"They are friends," he screamed to Nadara, and so they let the
boat come alongside and pick them up; but no sooner had Thandar
obtained a good look at the occupants that he discovered that
never a face among them had he seen before.</p>

<p>They were men of the same type as Tsao Ming's motley horde,
nor did Waldo Emerson need inquire their vocation&mdash;thief and
murderer were writ upon every countenance. They jabbered
questions at Nadara and Thandar in an assortment of dialects
which neither could understand, and it was only after the craft
had been anchored into the little bay and the party had waded to
shore that Thandar tried speaking with them in pidgin English.
Several among them understood him, and he was not long in making
it plain to them that they would be paid well if they carried him
and Nadara to a civilized port.</p>

<p>The leader, who seemed to be a full blooded negro, laughed at
him, ridiculing the idea that an almost naked man could pay for
his liberty. At the same time the fellow cast such greedy glances
at Nadara that Thandar became convinced that the fellow, for
reasons of his own, preferred not to believe that they could pay
in money for their liberty.</p>

<p>It seemed that the party had been about to embark for another
portion of the western coast of the island where the main body of
the horde lay. They had but been waiting for three of their crew
who had gone inland hunting, when they had seen the canoe and put
out to capture its occupants. Now they returned to the little
harbor to pick up their fellows and continue toward the main
camp.</p>

<p>The black was for dispatching Thandar at once as their boat
was already overcrowded, but there were others who counseled him
against it, reminding him of the probable anger of their chief,
who saw in a dead prisoner the loss of a possible ransom.</p>

<p>At last the hunters returned and all embarked. Soon the boat
had passed out of the bay and was making its way south along the
west coast of the island. It was almost dark when her nose was
turned toward shore and the long sweeps brought into play as the
sail sagged to the foot of the mast.</p>

<p>Between two small, overlapping points that hid what lay
behind, they passed into a landlocked harbor. As the boat
breasted the end of the inner point, Thandar sprang to his feet
with a cry of joy and amazement. Now a hundred yards away, riding
quietly on the mirror-like surface of the water, lay the
<i>Priscilla</i>.</p>

<p>The pirates looked at their prisoner in astonishment. The
black rose with clenched fists as though prepared to strike
him.</p>

<p>"<i>Priscilla</i> ahoy!" shrieked Waldo Emerson. "Help!
Help!"</p>

<p>The negro grinned. There was no response from the white yacht.
Then the men told Thandar that they had captured the vessel
several weeks before, and were holding her crew prisoners upon
land awaiting the return of the chief who had been unaccountably
absent for a long time. When Waldo Emerson told them that the
yacht belonged to his father the black was glad that he had not
killed him, for he should bring a fat ransom.</p>

<p>It was dark when they landed, and Thandar and Nadara were
forced into the squalid huts that lay side by side with several
others just above the beach. For a long time the man could not
sleep. His mind was occupied with doubts as to the fate of his
father and mother. Nadara had told him that both had been aboard
the <i>Priscilla</i>. She had said nothing of the treatment
accorded her by Mrs. Smith-Jones, but Waldo had guessed near the
truth, and he had seen that the sight of the <i>Priscilla</i> had
awakened not enthusiasm or happiness in the girl.</p>

<p>After awhile he dozed only to be awakened by the sound of
movement outside his hut. There was something sinister in the
stealthiness of the sound. Silently Thandar rose and crept to the
door. The pirates had made no attempt to secure their
prisoners&mdash;there was no possibility of their escaping from
the island.</p>

<p>Thandar put his head out into the lesser darkness of the
night. He muttered a little growl of rage and fear, for what he
saw was the huge, dark bulk of a man crawling into Nadara's hut.
Instantly the American followed. At the door of the girl's
shelter he paused to listen. Within he heard a sudden exclamation
of fright and the sound of a scuffle. Then he was within the
darkness, and a moment later stumbled against a man. Thandar's
fingers sought the throat. He made no sound. The other wheeled
upon him with a knife. Thandar had expected it. His forearm
warded the first blow, and running down the forearm of the other
found the knife wrist. Then commenced the struggle within the
Stygian blackness of the interior of the hut. Back and forth
across the mud floor the two staggered and reeled&mdash;the one
attempting to wrench free the hand that held the knife&mdash;the
other seeking a hold upon the throat of his antagonist while he
strove to maintain his grip on the other's wrist. The heavy
breathing of the two rose and fell upon the silence of the
night&mdash;that and the scuffling of their feet were the only
sounds of combat. Nadara could not assist Thandar&mdash;she knew
that it was he who had come to her rescue though she could not
see him.</p>

<p>At last, with superhuman effort, the night prowler broke away
from Thandar. For a moment silence reigned in the hut. None of
the three could see the other. From beneath his panther skin
Thandar drew the long pistol that Tsao Ming had given him, but he
dared not fire for fear of hitting Nadara, nor dared he ask her
to speak that he might know her position, for then he would have
divulged his own to his antagonist.</p>

<p>For minutes that seemed like hours the three stood in utter
silence, endeavoring to stifle their breathing. Then Thandar
heard a cautious movement upon the opposite side of the room. Was
it his foe, or Nadara? He raised his pistol level with a man's
breast, and then very cautiously he too moved to one side. At the
sound of his movement there came a sudden flash and deafening
roar from across the hut&mdash;the enemy had fired, and in the
flash of his gun all within the interior was lighted for an
instant, and to the man's left stood Nadara, safe from a shot
from Thandar's pistol.</p>

<p>The black, not knowing that Thandar was armed, had not guessed
that his chance shot was to prove his own death messenger. The
instant that the flash of the other's gun revealed his
whereabouts Thandar's pistol gave an answering roar, and
simultaneously Thandar leaped to one side, running swiftly to
grapple with the black from the other side; but when he came to
him, instead of meeting with ferocious resistance as he had
expected, he stumbled over his dead body.</p>

<p>By now the whole camp was awake. The pirates were running
hither and thither shouting questions and orders in their many
tongues. Confusion reigned supreme, and in the midst of it
Thandar grasped Nadara's hand and ran from the hut. Back of the
other huts he ran until he had passed the end of the camp. Then
he turned down toward the water. It was his intention to reach a
boat and make his way to the <i>Priscilla</i>.</p>

<p>Behind them the confusion of the camp grew as the pirates
searched the huts for an explanation of the two shots&mdash;there
could have been no better opportunity for escape. Drawn up on the
beach was one of the <i>Priscilla</i>'s own boats. Together
Thandar and Nadara pushed it off, and a moment later were rowing
rapidly toward the yacht.</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of unbounded security and elation that
Waldo Emerson clambered over the side and drew Nadara after him;
but his elation was short lived for scarcely had he set foot upon
the deck than he was seized from behind by half a dozen brawny
villains who had been on guard on board the <i>Priscilla</i> and
had seen the two put off from shore, watched their flight toward
the yacht and lain in wait for them as they clambered over the
side.</p>

<p>The balance of the night they were kept prisoners upon the
<i>Priscilla</i>; but early the next morning they were taken
ashore. There they found all the pirates congregated outside one
of the huts. Within were the passengers and crew of the
<i>Priscilla</i>. As Thandar and Nadara approached they were
seized and hustled toward the doorway&mdash;with an accompaniment
of oriental oaths they were pushed into the interior.</p>

<p>Standing about in disconsolate and unhappy groups were the
crew of the <i>Priscilla</i>, Captain Burlinghame, and Mr. and
Mrs. Smith-Jones. As his eyes fell upon the last, Waldo Emerson
ran to her with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>With a horrified shriek Mrs. Smith-Jones dodged behind her
husband and the captain. Waldo came to a sudden halt. The two men
eyed him threateningly. He looked straight into his father's
face.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Father?" he asked.</p>

<p>John Alden Smith-Jones' jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"Waldo Emerson," he cried. "It cannot be possible!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith-Jones emerged from retreat.</p>

<p>"Waldo Emerson!" she echoed. "It cannot be!"</p>

<p>"But it is, Mother," cried the young man.</p>

<p>"What awful apparel!" said Mrs. Smith-Jones after she had
embraced her son. Then her eyes wandered to Nadara, who had been
standing in demure silence just within the doorway.</p>

<p>"You?" she gasped. "You are not dead?"</p>

<p>Nadara shook her head, and Waldo Emerson hastened to recount
her adventures since Stark's attack upon her on the deck of the
<i>Priscilla</i>. Mrs. Smith-Jones approached the girl. She
placed a hand upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I have been doing a great deal of thinking since last I saw
you," she said, "and the result of it is that I am going to do
something I have never done in my life&mdash;I am going to ask
your pardon; I treated you shamefully. I do not need to ask if my
son loves you&mdash;you have already told me that you love
him&mdash;and his eyes have told me where his heart lies.</p>

<p>"For long nights I lay awake thinking of the horror of it, and
almost praying that he might be dead rather than come back to
find you waiting for him in Boston&mdash;that was before you went
overboard. You had no birth or family, and that to me meant
everything; but since I thought you were both dead I discovered
that I recalled many things about you that were infinitely to be
preferred over birth and breeding.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you just what they are&mdash;only I cannot
blame my son for loving you. Only you must discard that horrible
garment for something presentable."</p>

<p>"Mother!" shouted Waldo Emerson, as he threw his arms about
her. "I knew that you would love her, too, if you ever knew
her."</p>

<p>Just then the door opened and one of the pirates entered.</p>

<p>"Come," he said.</p>

<p>They filed out past him. From those outside they learned that
it had been decided to kill them all and after looting the
<i>Priscilla</i>, sink her, as a man-of-war had been sighted
cruising off the coast early in the morning. In their terror they
had decided to wait no longer for the absent chief, and all
thoughts of ransom were forgotten in the mad desire to erase
every vestige of their piracy.</p>

<p>The victims looked at one another in horror. They were
entirely surrounded by the pirates, and one by one were securely
bound that there might be no chance of any escaping. The plan was
to lead them inland to the densest part of the jungle and there
to cut their throats and leave their corpses for the vultures.
The pirates seemed to derive much pleasure in recounting their
plan to the prisoners.</p>

<p>At last all were bound and the death march commenced. The last
of the long line of hope-forsaken prisoners and brutal, gibing
cutthroats had disappeared in the jungle when a rude craft made
its way into the harbor. At sight of the <i>Priscilla</i> it
hesitated and prepared to fly, but seeing no sign of life aboard
it, approached, and finding the decks deserted, mounted. In the
cabins the newcomers discovered two Malays asleep. These they
woke with much laughter and rude jests.</p>

<p>The two guards leaped to their feet, feeling for their
pistols; but when they saw who had surprised them they grinned
broadly and jabbered volubly. They addressed all their remarks to
a huge and villainous fellow whom they called chief. He it was
whom the pirates had awaited, and whose prolonged absence had
resulted in the determination to execute the prisoners of the
<i>Priscilla</i>.</p>

<p>When the chief learned of what was going on in the jungle he
cursed and bellowed in rage. He saw many thousand liang of sycee
evaporating before his eyes. Shouting orders to his fellows to
follow him he leaped into the craft that had brought them to the
<i>Priscilla</i>, and a moment later was pushing rapidly toward
the shore. Without waiting to draw the boat upon the beach the
chief plunged into the jungle, his men at his heels.</p>

<p>Far ahead of him trudged the weary and fear-stricken
prisoners, lashed onward by sticks and the flats of murderous
parangs. At last the pirates halted in a tangled mass of
vegetation.</p>

<p>"Here," said one; but another thought they should proceed a
little further. For a few minutes the two men argued, then the
first drew his parang and advanced upon Thandar.</p>

<p>"Here!" he insisted and swung the blade about his head.</p>

<p>A sudden crashing of the underbrush and loud and angry shouts
caused him to turn his eyes in the direction of the interruption.
The prisoners, too, looked. What they saw was not particularly
reassuring&mdash;only another very ferocious appearing and
exceedingly wrathful pirate followed by a half-dozen other
villains.</p>

<p>He rushed into the midst of the group, knocking men to right
and left. The wicked-looking fellows who had bullied and cowed
the frightened prisoners but a few moments before now looked the
picture of abject terror.</p>

<p>The chief came to a halt before the man with the bared parang.
His face was livid, and working spasmodically with rage and
excitement. He tried to speak, and then he turned his eyes upon
Thandar, standing there bound ready for decapitation. As his gaze
fell upon this prisoner his eyes went wide, and then he turned
upon the would-be executioner, and with a mighty blow felled
him.</p>

<p>That seemed to loose his tongue, and from his mouth flowed a
torrent of the most awful abuse the prisoners had ever heard. It
was directed toward the men who had dared contemplate this thing
without his sanction, and principally against the cowering
unfortunate who had not dared rise from where his chief's heavy
fist had sprawled him.</p>

<p>"And you would have killed Thandar," he shrieked. "Thandar,
who saved my life!"</p>

<p>And then he fell to kicking the prostrate man until Thandar
himself was forced to intercede in the wretch's behalf.</p>

<p>With the coming of Tsao Ming the troubles of the prisoners
evaporated in thin air, for when he found that the owner of the
<i>Priscilla</i> was Thandar's father he restored the yacht and
all the loot that his men had taken from it to their rightful
owners. Nor would he have stopped there had they permitted him to
have his way, which was no less than to behead half a dozen of
his unfortunate lieutenants who had been over-zealous in the
performance of their piratical duties.</p>

<p>Tsao Ming's picturesque villains replenished the water casks
of the <i>Priscilla</i> and carried aboard a plentiful table to
Honolulu, the port they had chosen as their first stop.</p>

<p>And when the preparations were completed a dozen piratical
prahus escorted the white yacht a hundred miles upon her
northward journey, firing a farewell salute with volley after
volley from the little brass six-pounders in their bows.</p>

<p>As the tiny fleet diminished to mere specks astern,
disappearing beneath the southern horizon, a white flanneled man
with close cropped blonde hair, and a slender, black haired girl
in simple shirt waist and duck suit watched them from the deck of
the <i>Priscilla</i>.</p>

<p>An involuntary sigh escaped the lips of each, and they turned
and looked into one another's eyes.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chb13" id="chb13">XIII. &mdash; HOMEWARD
BOUND</a></h2>

<p class="first">At Honolulu, Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones and
Nadara were married. Before the ceremony there had been some
discussions as to what name should be used in describing Nadara
in the formal contract.</p>

<p>"Nadara" alone seemed too brief and meaningless to the precise
Mrs. Smith-Jones; but Waldo Emerson and the girl insisted that it
was her name and all-sufficient. So, in lieu of another name, it
was finally decided by all that "Nadara" could not be legally
improved upon.</p>

<p>Prior to the ceremony, which took place on board the
<i>Priscilla</i>, Mr. and Mrs. John Alden Smith-Jones, Captain
Cecil Burlinghame, several invited guests from amongst officials
and friends in Honolulu, and the crew of the <i>Priscilla</i>
presented gifts to the bride.</p>

<p>Captain Burlinghame in presenting his proffered a few words in
explanation of it.</p>

<p>"To you, Nadara," he said, "these trinkets will hold a deeper
meaning and greater value than to another, for they come from
your own forgotten island where they lay for twenty years until,
by chance, I picked them up close by the sea. The poor lady to
whom they once belonged you never knew&mdash;it is quite possible
that she was never upon your savage coast&mdash;and how her
jewels came to be there must always remain a mystery. But two
things you hold in common with her, for she was a lady and she
was very beautiful."</p>

<p>He held toward Nadara in his open palm a little worn bag of
skins of small rodents, sewn together with bits of gut. At sight
of it both the girl and Waldo Emerson exclaimed in
astonishment.</p>

<p>Nadara took the bag wonderingly in her hands and dumped the
contents into her palm. Waldo pressed forward.</p>

<p>"Did you know to whom these belonged?" he asked
Burlinghame.</p>

<p>"To Eug&egrave;nie Marie C&eacute;leste de la Valois, Countess of Cercy,"
replied the captain.</p>

<p>"They belonged to Nadara's mother," returned Waldo. "Her
foster parents were present at her birth and took these jewels
from the poor woman's body after she had passed away. She was
washed ashore in a boat in which there was only a dead man beside
herself&mdash;Nadara was born that night."</p>

<p>And so, when the clergyman had performed the marriage ceremony
he entered upon the certificate in the space provided there for
the name of the woman: Nadara de la Valois.</p>

<p>And they are living in Boston now in a wonderful home that you
have seen if you ever have been to Boston and been driving about
in one of those great sight-seeing motor buses, for the place is
pointed out to all visitors because of the beauty of its
architecture and fame that attaches to the historic and
aristocratic name of its owner, which, as it happens, is not
Smith-Jones at all.</p>
