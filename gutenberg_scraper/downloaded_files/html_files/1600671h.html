<h2>1. [The Dehnings and the Herslands]</h2>

<p>Once an angry man dragged his father along the ground through
his own orchard. "Stop!" cried the groaning old man at last, "Stop!
I did not drag my father beyond this tree."</p>

<p>It is hard living down the tempers we are born with. We all
begin well, for in our youth there is nothing we are more
intolerant of than our own sins writ large in others and we fight
them fiercely in ourselves; but we grow old and we see that these
our sins are of all sins the really harmless ones to own, nay that
they give a charm to any character, and so our struggle with them
dies away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>It has always seemed to me a rare privilege, this, of being an
American, a real American, one whose tradition it has taken
scarcely sixty years to create. We need only realise our parents,
remember our grandparents and know ourselves and our history is
complete.</p>

<p>The old people in a new world, the new people made out of the
old, that is the story that I mean to tell, for that is what really
is and what I really know.</p>

<p>Some of the fathers we must realise so that we can tell our
story really, were little boys then, and they came across the water
with their parents, the grandparents we need only just remember.
Some of these our fathers and our mothers, were not even made then,
and the women, the young mothers, our grandmothers we perhaps just
have seen once, carried these our fathers and our mothers into the
new world inside them, those women of the old world strong to bear
them. Some looked very weak and little women, but even these so
weak and little, were strong always, to bear many children.</p>

<p>These certain men and women, our grandfathers and grandmothers,
with their children born and unborn with them, some whose children
were gone ahead to prepare a home to give them; all countries were
full of women who brought with them many children; but only certain
men and women and the children they had in them, to make many
generations for them, will fill up this history for us of a family
and its progress.</p>

<p>Many kinds of all these women were strong to bear many
children.</p>

<p>One was very strong to bear them and then always she was very
strong to lead them.</p>

<p>One was strong to bear them and then always she was strong to
suffer with them.</p>

<p>One, a little gentle weary woman was strong to bear many
children, and then always after she would sadly suffer for them,
weeping for the sadness of all sinning, wearying for the rest she
knew her death would bring them.</p>

<p>And then there was one sweet good woman, strong just to bear
many children, and then she died away and left them, for that was
all she knew then to do for them.</p>

<p>And these four women and the husbands they had with them and the
children born and unborn in them will make up the history for us of
a family and its progress.</p>

<p>Other kinds of men and women and the children they had with
them, came at different times to know them; some, poor things, who
never found how they could make a living, some who dreamed while
others fought a way to help them, some whose children went to
pieces with them, some who thought and thought and then their
children rose to greatness through them, and some of all these
kinds of men and women and the children they had in them will help
to make the history for us of this family and its progress.</p>

<p>These first four women, the grandmothers we need only just
remember, mostly never saw each other. It was their children and
grandchildren who, later, wandering over the new land, where they
were seeking first, just to make a living, and then later, either
to grow rich or to gain wisdom, met with one another and were
married, and so together they made a family whose progress we are
now soon to be watching.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>We, living now, are always to ourselves young men and women.
When we, living always in such feeling, think back to them who make
for us a beginning, it is always as grown and old men and women or
as little children that we feel them, these whose lives we have
just been thinking. We sometimes talk it long, but really, it is
only very little time we feel ourselves ever to have being as old
men and women or as children. Such parts of our living are little
ever really there to us as present in our feeling. Yes; we, who are
always all our lives, to ourselves grown young men and women, when
we think back to them who make for us a beginning, it is always as
grown old men and women or as little children that we feel them,
such as them whose lives we have just been thinking.</p>

<p>Yes it is easy to think ourselves and our friends, all our lives
as young grown men and women, indeed it is hard for us to feel even
when we talk it long, that we are old like old men and women or
little as a baby or as children. Such parts of our living are never
really there to us as present, to our feeling.</p>

<p>Yes we are very little children when we first begin to be to
ourselves grown men and women. We say then, yes we are children,
but we know then, way inside us, we are not to ourselves real as
children, we are grown to ourselves, as young grown men and women.
Nay we never know ourselves as other than young and grown men and
women. When we know we are no longer to ourselves as children. Very
little things we are then and very full of such feeling. No, to be
feeling ourselves to be as children is like the state between when
we are asleep and when we are just waking, it is never really there
to us as present to our feeling.</p>

<p>And so it is to be really old to ourselves in our feeling; we
are weary and are old, and we know it in our working and our
thinking, and we talk it long, and we can see it just by looking,
and yet we are a very little time really old to ourselves in our
feeling, old as old men and old women once were and still are to
our feeling. No, no one can be old like that to himself in his
feeling. No it must be always as grown and young men and women that
we know ourselves and our friends in our feeling. We know it is not
so, by our saying, but it must be so always to our feeling. To be
old to ourselves in our feeling is a losing of ourselves like just
dropping off into sleeping. To be awake, we must have it that we
are to ourselves young and grown men and women.</p>

<p>To be ourself like an old man or an old woman to our feeling
must be a horrid losing-self sense to be having. It must be a
horrid feeling, like the hard leaving of our sense when we are
forced into sleeping or the coming to it when we are just waking.
It must be a horrid feeling to have such a strong sense of losing,
such a feeling as being to ourselves like children or like grown
old men and women. Perhaps to some it is a gentle sense of losing
some who like themselves to be without a self sense feeling, but
certainly it must be always a sense of self losing in each one who
finds himself really having a very young or very old self
feeling.</p>

<p>Our mothers, fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers, in the
histories, and the stories, all the others, they all are always
little babies grown old men and women or as children for us. No,
old generations and past ages never have grown young men and women
in them. So long ago they were, why they must be old grown men and
women or as babies or as children. No, them we never can feel as
young grown men and women. Such only are ourselves and our friends
with whom we have been living.</p>

<p>And so since there is no other way to do with our kind of
thinking we will make our elders to be for us the grown old men and
women in our stories, or the babies or the children. We will be
always, in ourselves, the young grown men and women.</p>

<p>And so now we begin, and with such men and women as we have old
or as very little, in us, to our thinking.</p>

<p>One of these four women, the grandmothers old always to us the
generation of grandchildren, was a sweet good woman, strong just to
bear many children and then she died away and left them for that
was all she knew then to do for them.</p>

<p>Like all good older women she had all her life born many
children and she had made herself a faithful working woman to her
husband who was a good enough ordinary older man.</p>

<p>Her husband lived some years after his wife had died away and
left him.</p>

<p>He was just a decent well-meaning faithful good-enough ordinary
man. He was honest, and he left that very strongly to his children
and he worked hard, but he never came to very much with all his
faithful working.</p>

<p>He was just a decent honest good-enough man to do ordinary
working. He always was good to his wife and always liked her to be
with him, and to have good children, and to help him with her
working. He always liked all of his children and he always did all
that he could to help them, but they were all soon strong enough to
leave him, and now that his wife had died away and left him, he was
not really needed much by the world or by his children.</p>

<p>They were good daughters and sons to him, but his sayings and
his old ordinary ways of doing had not much importance for them.
They were strong, all of them, in their work and in their new way
of feeling and full always of their new ways of living. It was
alright, he always said it to them, and he thought it so really in
him, but it was all too new, it could never be any comfort to him.
He had been left out of all life while he was still living. It was
all too new for his feeling and his wife was no longer there to
stay beside him. He felt it always in him and he sighed and at last
he just slowly left off living. "Yes," he would say of his son
Henry who was the one who took most care and trouble for him, "Yes,
Henry, he is a good man and he knows how to make a living. Yes he
is a good boy to me always but he never does anything like I tell
him. It ain't wrong in him, never I don't say so like that ever for
him, only I don't need it any more just to go on like I was living.
My wife she did always like I told her, she never knew any way to
do it different, and now she is gone peace be with her, and it is
all now like it was all over, and I, I got no right now to say do
so to my children. I don't ever say it now ever no more to them.
What have I got to do with living? I've got no place to go on now
like I was really living. I got nobody now always by me to do
things like I tell them. I got nothing to say now anymore to my
children. I got all done with what I got to say to them. Well young
folks always knows things different, and they got it right not to
listen, I got nothing now really to do with their new kinds of ways
of living. Anyhow Henry, he knows good how to make a living. He
makes money such a way I got no right to say it different to him.
He makes money and I never can see how his way he can make it and
he is honest and a good man always, with all his making such a good
living. And he, has got right always to do like he wants it, and he
is good to me always, I can't ever say it any different. He always
is good to me, and the others, they come to see me always only now
it is all different. My wife she stayed right by me always and the
children they always got some new place where they got to go and do
it different." And then the old man sighed and then soon too he
died away and left them.</p>

<p>Henry Dehning was a grown man and for his day a rich one when
his father died away and left them. Truly he had made everything
for himself very different; but it is not as a young man making
himself rich that we are now to feel him, he is for us an old grown
man telling it all over to his children.</p>

<p>He is a middle aged man now when he talks about it all to his
children, middle aged as perhaps sometimes we ourselves are now to
our talking, but he, he is grown old man to our thinking. Yes truly
this Henry Dehning had made everything for himself to be very
different. His ways and his needs and how much money it took now to
live to be decent, and all the habits of his daily life, they were
all now for him very different.</p>

<p>And it is strange how all forget when they have once made things
for themselves to be very different. A man like Dehning never can
feel it real to himself, things as they were in his early manhood,
now that he has made his life and habits and his feelings all so
different. He says it often, as we all do childhood and old age and
pain and sleeping, but it can never anymore be really present to
his feeling.</p>

<p>Now the common needs in his life are very different. No, not he,
nor they all who have made it for themselves to be so different,
can remember meekness, nor poor ways, nor self attendance, nor no
comforts, all such things are to all of them as indifferent as if
they in their own life time themselves had not made it different.
It is not their not wanting to remember these things that were so
different. Nay they love to remember, and to tell it over, and most
often to their children, what they have been and what they have
done and how they themselves have made it all to be so different
and how well it is for these children that they have had a strong
father who knew how to do it so that youngsters could so have
it.</p>

<p>Yes, they say it long and often and yet it is never real to them
while they are thus talking. No it is not as really present to
their thinking as it is to the young ones who never really had the
feeling. These have it through their fear, which makes it for them
a really present feeling. The old ones have not such a fear and
they have it all only like a dim beginning, like the being as
babies or as children or as grown old men and women.</p>

<p>And this father Dehning was always very full of such talking. He
had made everything for himself and for his children. He was a good
and honest man was Henry Dehning. He was strong and rich and good
tempered and respected and he showed it in his look, that look that
makes young people think older ones are very aged, and he loved to
tell it over to his children, how he had made it all for them so
they could have it and not have to work to make it different.</p>

<p>"Yes," he would often say to his children, looking at them with
that sharp, side-long, shrewd glance that makes fathers so fearful
and so aged to their children. Not that he, Dehning, was ever very
dreadful to his children, but there is a burr in a man's voice that
always makes for terror in his children and there is a sharp,
narrow, outward, shut off glance from an old man that will always
fill with dread young grown men and women. No it is only by long
equal living that their wives know that there is no terror in them,
but the young never can be equal enough with them to really rid
themselves of such feeling. No, they only really can get rid of
such a feeling when they have found in an old man a complete
pathetic falling away into a hapless failing. But mostly for all
children and young grown men and women there is much terror in an
old man's looking.</p>

<p>Not, we repeat, that the Dehnings had much of such a feeling.
Their mother had learnt, by perhaps more than equal living that
there really was no terror in him and through her they had lost
much of such feeling. But always they had something of that dread
in them when he would begin talking to them of what had been and
what he had done for them. Then it was that he always became very
aged to them and he would strongly hold them with his sharp narrow
outward kind of looking that, closing him, went very straight into
them.</p>

<p>"Yes," he would often say to his children, "Yes I say to you
children, you have an easy time of it nowadays doing nothing. Well!
What! yes, you think you always have to have everything you can
ever think of wanting. Well I guess yes, you have to have your
horses and your teachers and your music and your tutors and all
kinds of modern improvements and you can't ever do things for
yourself, you always have to have somebody there to do it for you;
well, yes you children have an easy time of it nowadays doing
nothing. Yes I had it very differently when I was a boy like George
here who is just a lazy good for nothing. I didn't have all these
new fangled notions. I was already earning my own living and giving
myself my own education. Well! What! yes! well I say it to you, you
have no idea what an easy time you children all have nowadays just
doing nothing. And my poor mother, peace be with her, she never had
her own house and all kinds of servants to wait on her like your
mother. Yes, well, your mother has everything I can give her, not
that she don't deserve everything I can give her, Miss Jenny is the
best girl I know and she will always have it as easy as I can make
it for her, but you children, you never have done anything yet to
make it right that you should always be having everything so easy
to you. Yes, I say to you, I don't see with all these modern
improvements to always spoil you, you ever will be good to work
hard like your father. No all these modern kinds of improvements
never can do any good to anybody. Yes, what, well, tell me, you all
like to be always explaining to me, tell me exactly what you are
going to get from all these your expensive modern kinds of ways of
doing. Well I say, just tell me some kind of way so that I can
understand you. You know I like to get good value for my money, I
always had a name for being pretty good at trading, I say, you know
I like to know just what I am getting for my money and you children
do certainly cost a great deal of my money, now I say, tell me, I
am glad to listen to you, I say you tell me just what you are going
to do, to make it good all this money. Well what, what are all
these kinds of improvements going to do for you."</p>

<p>The children laughed, "You see you can't tell yet sir," they
answered, "it will be different but I guess we will be good for
something."</p>

<p>"No you children never will be good for something if I have any
right kind of a way to know it," Mr. Dehning answered, and he
looked very sharply at them. And this was a cheerful challenge to
them for he liked it and they liked it too with him, to light
strongly against him in the everlasting struggle of conscious
unproved power in the young against dogmatic pride in having done
it, of the old ones.</p>

<p>This father was proud of his children and yet, too, very
reproachful in his feeling toward them. His wife from perhaps more
than equal living with him never much regarded such a feeling in
him, but to the young ones it was new for them however often it
came to them, for it always meant a new fighting for the right to
their kind of power that they felt strongly inside them.</p>

<p>But always there was a little of the dread in them that comes to
even grown young men and women from an old man's sharp looking, for
deep down is the fear, perhaps he really knows, his look is so
outward from him, he certainly has used it all up the things inside
him at which young ones are still always looking. And then comes
the strong feeling, no he never has had it inside him the way that
gives it a real meaning, and so the young ones are firm to go on
with their fighting. And always they stay with their father and
listen to him.</p>

<p>His wife from her more than equal living, as it sometimes is in
women, has not such a dread of his really knowing when it comes to
their ways of living, and then it is really only talking with him
for now it is completely his own only way of living, and so she
never listens to him, is deaf to him or goes away when he begins
this kind of talking. But his children always stay and listen to
him. They are ready very strongly to explain their new ways to him.
But he does not listen to them, he goes on telling what he has done
and what he thinks of them.</p>

<p>"No I say I don't think you children ever will be good for
something. No you won't ever know how to make a living, not if all
the ways I have seen men make a success in working is any kind of
use to tell from. Well, what, what do you know with all your always
talking, what do you know about how good hard work is done now?
What is it you know now, when there is nothing you can any of you
ever do anyway I ever saw you trying? No there is too much
education business and literary effects in you all for you ever to
amount to something, and then you will be always wanting more and
so you never will do anything when you have nobody there to always
help you. I always tell your mother, she always spoils you wanting
you should have all kinds of things that you are never really
needing. Not that I have anything to say against your mother's ways
of doing. Miss Jenny is the best girl I know, she is too good to
you that's all, she spoils all you children the way it always is
with a woman giving you all what will never help to make you good
for something in any kind of a way to earn a living, what, alright,
I say to you, you children have an easy time of it now always doing
nothing. Well, what, you think you can do it better with all your
literary effects you are all so proud of. Well alright, in a few
years now we will see who knows best about you then, I say, you can
show me what these new fangled notions and all your modern kinds of
improvements and all your education business you and your mamma are
now all so fond of can do for you. Yes I say, it is only a few
years now and then we all can see how you can do it. No I never had
it easy like you children and I had to make it all myself so you
could have it different. Yes I am always saying it to you but you
think you know it all by yourselves and you never listen to me. Yes
it was very different once with me. Yes when I was younger than
George here and my brother Adolph was no bigger than my little
Hortense, we left home to come and make our way here. We did not
have much money so all the family could not come over on the same
ship together, and I remember how lonesome Adolph and I were when
we went away from home alone together. I remember too while we were
waiting in a big bare room for them to give us tickets, I remember
we heard some one say our father's name, some man in the same room
with us. We did not dare speak to the men near us and we did not
know which man it was that knew us, but it made us feel a little
better. Yes I say you youngsters have an easy time of it nowadays
doing nothing. And that was all years ago and now everything is all
very different with me. And my poor mother, peace be with her, she
never had a big house and servants to work for her like your
mother, and everything she ever wanted I could give her like your
mother has now that I can buy it for her. No, my poor mother, peace
be with her, it was very different for her. You are named after her
Julia but you don't any of you children look much like her. Yes she
was a good strong woman was my mother, peace be with her. No you
don't any of you ever look much like her and she could do more than
all her grandchildren ever can do now all put together. Yes she was
a wonderful woman your grandmother, peace be with her. She took
care of all us children, we were ten then, and she made our clothes
and did her own washing and in between she made peppermint candy
for the little ones to sell. She was a wonderful good woman your
grandmother, not like you children who never will be good for
anything. Yes! I say, I was only a little older than that lazy
George here when my poor mother, peace be with her, died away, and
we were left there, ten children, and we had to get along without
her, and my father, he was an honest and a good man but he never
knew much how to make a living, and so he never could help along
any of his children. And so what we wanted we had to go out and
find out how to get it. And now you children have it very
different, you have everything you can ever think you can be
needing, and you don't ever show that you can work hard to deserve
it. Well you got your literary effect and your new fangled notions
and all kinds of education and you all always explain to me how
well you know how to do it, I say it will be soon now when I can
see what all these new fangled notions and all your kinds of
improvements will do for you. See if it can teach you more than we
learned working hard and selling candy and anything else we could
do to get some money. What, well alright, I say I am good and ready
to sit still and watch you to see how you all do it. I am always
waiting and if you are any good I will know it. I say I am always
watching now to see," and then he went away and left them followed
by shouts from them, "Alright sir, you just wait and see."</p>

<p>The young Dehnings had all been born and brought up in the town
of Bridgepoint. Their mother too had been born in Bridgepoint. It
was there that they had first landed, her father, a harsh man, hard
to his wife and to his children but not very good with all his
fierceness at knowing how to make a living, and her mother a good
gentle wife who never left him, though surely he was not worthy to
have her so faithful to him, and she was a good woman who with all
her woe was strong to bear many children and always after she was
strong to do her best for them and always strong to suffer with
them.</p>

<p>And this harsh hard man and his good gentle little wife had many
children, and one daughter had long ago married Henry Dehning. It
was a happy marriage enough for both of them, their faults and the
good things they each had in them made of them a man and wife to
very well content all who had to do with them.</p>

<p>All the Dehnings were very fond of Bridgepoint. They had their
city and their country house like all the people who were well to
do in Bridgepoint.</p>

<p>The Dehnings in the country were simple pleasant people. It was
surprising how completely they could shed there the straining
luxury and uneasy importance of their city life. Their country
house was one of those large commodious wooden double affairs with
a wide porch all around and standing well back from the road. In
front and at the sides were pleasant lawns and trees and beyond
were green open marshes leading down to salt water. In back was a
cleared space that spread out into great meadows of stunted oaks no
higher than a man's waist, great levels glistening green in the
summer and brilliantly red in the autumn stretching away under vast
skies, and always here and there was a great tree waving in the
wind and wading knee deep in the rough radiant leafy tide.</p>

<p>Yes the Dehnings in the country were simple pleasant people.
There they were a contented joyous household. All day the young
ones played and bathed and rode and then the family altogether
would sail and fish. Yes the Dehnings in the country were simple
pleasant people. The Dehning country house was very pleasant too
for all young men and boys, the uncles and the cousins of the
Dehning family, who all delighted in the friendly freedom of this
country home, rare in those days among this kind of people, and so
the Dehning house was always full of youth and kindly ways and
sport and all altogether there they all always lead a pleasant
family life.</p>

<p>The Dehning family itself was made up of the parents and three
children. They made a group very satisfying to the eye, prosperous
and handsome.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning was a man successful, strong-featured, gentle
tempered, joyous and carrying always his fifty years of life with
the good-nature of a cheerful boy. He enjoyed the success that he
could boast that he had won, he loved the struggle in which he had
always been and always conquered, he was proud of his past and of
his present worth, he was proud in his three children and proud
that they could teach him things he did not know, he was proud of
his wife who was proud of such very different things. "Oh Miss
Jenny, she is the best girl I know," he always sang as he came to
find her, never content long out of sight of his family when not
engrossed by business or cards.</p>

<p>I said that Henry Dehning's wife was proud of such very
different things, but that was wrong, she was proud in very
different fashion but proud of the same things. She loved his
success and the worth with which he conquered and she was not
anxious to forget the way that he had come. No she was in her way
proud that he himself had done it. She liked his power, and when
she ever thought about it she liked the honest way she knew that he
had done it. And like him too she was very proud in their three
educated children but to her thinking there was very little they
could teach her. She knew it all always very well and much better
than they could ever know it. But she was very proud of these
educated children and she was very proud of her husband Henry
Dehning though she knew he always did little things so badly and
that he would still always play like a poor man with his fingers
and he never would learn not to do it. Yes she was very proud of
her husband though he always did little things so badly and she had
always to be telling him how a man in his position should know how
to do it. She came towards him now when he was through with his
talking, and she had one rebuke to him for his always calling her
his girl Miss Jenny, and another for the way he had of fidgeting
always with his fingers. "Don't do that Henry!" she said to him
loudly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dehning was the quintessence of loud-voiced good-looking
prosperity. She was a fair heavy woman, well-looking and firmly
compacted and hitting the ground as she walked with the same hard
jerk with which she rebuked her husband for his sins. Yes Mrs.
Dehning was a woman whose rasping insensibility to gentle courtesy
deserved the prejudice one cherished against her, but she was a
woman, to do her justice, generous and honest, one whom one might
like better the more one saw her less.</p>

<p>Yes it was now all very different for them. It was very pleasant
always for Henry Dehning then, to stand and to look about him, yes
truly it was now all very different with him. He had his family
there about him, a family certain to be a satisfaction to him. They
were a group to gratify the feeling of pride in him, they were so
prosperous vigorous good-looking, honest, and always respectful to
him, and surely they would have later, good hope of winning for
themselves all that he could ever wish to them.</p>

<p>Yes it certainly was very different now with him. Could one ever
have it real to him that in one life time a man could have it all
so different for him, that a man all alone in his single lifetime
could make it so that he could have it to be truly all so different
in him.</p>

<p>Nay for a man to have it in a single life time all so different
for him is more strange than being born and being then a baby and
then a child and then a young grown man and then old like a man
grown old and then dead and so no more of living, it is more
strange because it makes so many lives in this one living. Each one
of these lives that he forgets or remembers only as a dim beginning
is a whole life to us in our thinking, and so Henry Dehning has had
many lives in him to our feeling.</p>

<p>Could one believe it that he was a grown man and he was then
living like the man who comes into his place now to do a little
selling to the servants in the kitchen. And yet that was one whole
full life for him; and then there was the old world where there had
been for him such a very different kind of living. Yes as he stands
there talking to his children of the things that are never real now
any more to his feeling, a man comes up the walk and slinks back
when he sees them and goes sneaking to the kitchen and there he
sells little things to the women who buy them out of Irish fun or
just to be kind to him, for his things are really not good enough
for them, they are things for people poorer than any that work in a
kitchen; and so Mr. Dehning goes on talking to his children and it
is all more real to their feeling than it is now to his thinking,
for they have it in their fear which young ones always have inside
them, and he, he has it only as a dim beginning as being like a
baby or an old grown man or woman. Nay how can he ever have it in
him to feel it now as really present to him, such things as
meekness or poor ways or self attendance or no comforts, it is only
a fear that could make such things be now as present to him, and he
has no such a fear ever inside him, not for himself ever or even
for his children, for he is strong in a sense of always winning. It
is they, the children, who, though they too feel a strength inside
them and talk about it very often, yet way down deep in them they
know they have no way to be really certain; and always they are
brave, good-looking, honest, prosperous children and the father
feels strong pride as he looks around him.</p>

<p>The Dehning family was made of this father and mother and three
children. Mr. Dehning was very proud of his children and proud of
all the things he knew that they could teach him. There were two
daughters and a son of them.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning was named after her grandmother, but, as her
father often told her, she never looked the least bit like her and
yet there was a little in her that made the old world not all lost
to her, a little that made one always remember that her grandmother
and her father had had always a worn old world to remember.</p>

<p>Yes Julia looked much like her mother. That fair good-looking
prosperous woman had stamped her image on each one of her children,
and with her eldest, Julia, the stamp went deep, far deeper than
just for the fair good-looking exterior.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning was now just eighteen and she showed in all its
vigor, the self-satisfied crude domineering American girlhood that
was strong inside her. Perhaps she was born too near to the old
world to ever attain quite altogether that crude virginity that
makes the American girl safe in all her liberty. Yes the American
girl is a crude virgin and she is safe in her freedom.</p>

<p>And now, so thought her mother, and Julia was quite of the same
opinion, the time had come for Julia to have a husband and to begin
her real important living.</p>

<p>Under Julia's very American face, body, clothes and manner and
her vigor of the domineering and crude virgin, there were now and
then flashes of passion that lit up an older well hidden tradition.
Yes in Julia Dehning the prosperous, good-looking, domineering
woman was a very attractive being. Julia irradiated energy and
brilliant enjoying, she was vigorous, and like her mother, fair and
firmly compacted, and she was full of bright hopes, and strong in
the spirit of success that she felt always in her. Julia was much
given to hearty joyous laughing and to an ardent honest feeling,
and she hit the ground as she walked with the same hard jerking
with which her mother Mrs. Dehning always rebuked her husband's
sinning. Yes Julia Dehning was bright and full of vigor, and with
something always a little harsh in her, making underneath her young
bright vigorous ardent honest feeling a little of the sense of
rasping that was just now in her mother's talking.</p>

<p>And so those who read much in story books surely now can tell
what to expect of her, and yet, please reader, remember that this
is perhaps not the whole of our story either, neither her father
for her, nor the living down her mother who is in her, for I am not
ready yet to take away the character from our Julia, for truly she
may work out as the story books would have her or we may find all
different kinds of things for her, and so reader, please remember,
the future is not yet certain for her, and be you well warned
reader, from the vain-glory of being sudden in your judgment of
her.</p>

<p>After Julia came the boy George and he was not named after his
grandfather. And so it was right that in his name he should not
sound as if he were the son of his father, so at least his mother
decided for him, and the father, he laughed and let her do the way
she liked it. And so the boy was named George and the other was
there but hidden as an initial to be only used for signing.</p>

<p>The boy George bade fair to do credit to his christening. George
Dehning now about fourteen was strong in sport and washing. He was
not foreign in his washing. Oh, no, he was really an American.</p>

<p>It's a great question this question of washing. One never can
find any one who can be satisfied with anybody else's washing. I
knew a man once who never as far as any one could see ever did any
washing, and yet he described another with contempt, why he is a
dirty hog sir, he never does any washing. The French tell me it's
the Italians who never do any washing, the French and the Italians
both find the Spanish a little short in their washing, the English
find all the world lax in this business of washing, and the East
finds all the West a pig, which never is clean with just the little
cold water washing. And so it goes.</p>

<p>Yes it has been said that even a flea has other little fleas to
bite him, and so it is with this washing, everybody can find some
one to condemn for his lack of washing. Even the man who, when he
wants to take a little hut in the country to live in, and they said
to him, but there is no water to have there, and he said, what does
that matter, in this country one can always have wine for his
drinking, he too has others who for him don't think enough about
their washing; and then there is the man who takes the bath-tub out
of his house because he don't believe in promiscuous bathing; and
there is the plumber who says, yes I have always got to be fixing
bath-tubs for other people to get clean in, and I, I haven't got
time enough to wash my hands even; and then there are the French
bohemians, now one never would think of them as extravagantly
cleanly beings, and yet in a village in Spain they were an
astonishment to all the natives, why do you do so much washing,
they all demanded of them, when your skin is so white and clean
even when you first begin to clean them; and then there is the
dubious smelly negro woman who tells you about another woman who is
as dirty as a dog and as ragged as a spring chicken, and yet some
dogs certainly do sometimes do some washing and this woman had
certainly not much sign of ever having had such a thing happening;
and then there is the virtuous poor woman who brings her child to
the dispensary for a treatment and the doctor says to her, no I
won't touch her now anymore until you clean her, and the woman
cries out in her indignation, what you think I am poor like a
beggar, I got money enough to pay for a doctor, I show you I can
hire a real doctor, and she slams the door and rushes out with her
daughter. Yes it certainly is very queer in her. All this washing
business is certainly most peculiar. Surely it is true that even
little fleas have always littler ones to bite them.</p>

<p>And then when we are all through with the pleasant summer and
its gorgeous washing, then comes the dreadful question of the
winter washing. It's easy enough to wash often when the sun is hot
and they are sticky and perspiring and the water in a natural kind
of a way is always flowing, but when it comes to be nasty cold as
it always is in winter, then it is not any more a pleasure, it is a
harsh duty then and hard to follow.</p>

<p>Yes it certainly is all very funny, and so we come back to talk
some more about George Dehning, George who in this washing is
always strong to do all his duty.</p>

<p>George Dehning was a fair athletic chap, cheery as his father
and full of excellent intentions, and though these were almost all
lost in their way to their fulfillment, remember, George was only
fourteen just then, that time with a boy when he never can have
much sense in him, for it nearly always is then with boys that the
meekest of them are reckless dare-devil heedless unreflecting
fellows, and so reader do not make too much for him of any present
weakness in him.</p>

<p>Yes, George Dehning was not at all foreign in his washing but
for him, too, the old world was not altogether lost behind him.
Sometimes the boy had a way with him, and it would show clear in
spite of the fair cheery sporty nature he had in him, a way of
looking sleepy and reflecting, and his lids would never be really
ever very open, and he would be always only half showing his clear
grey eyes that, very often, were bright alive and laughing.</p>

<p>Later such a way of looking could be of great service to him. It
would not matter if he never really could have wisdom in him, this
look could help him always in his dealings with all men and be of
much service too to him with women. He will listen then, and with
his veiled eyes it will be as if he were full with thinking, and
with himself always well hidden, and so he will be wise; or for a
woman, it will be as if he were always in a dream of them. Wisdom
and dreaming, both good things when shown at the right time by a
young grown man, who wants to be succeeding, always, in every kind
of living.</p>

<p>And so for the moment we leave the sporty cheery well washed
George Dehning with his background and his future of wisdom and of
dreaming, both now pretty well hidden away in the depths of
him.</p>

<p>And then there was the littlest one whose name had been all
given without regard to the old world behind them. They called her
Hortense for that was both elegant and new then. The father let the
mother do as she liked with the naming, he laughed and a little he
did not like it in him and then a little he was proud of his Miss
Jenny and her way of doing.</p>

<p>And so the littlest was Hortense Dehning. She too had the stamp
of the fair prosperous woman who had set her seal so firmly on her
children, but little Hortense had perhaps a little more in her of
that sweet good woman who had born many children and then had died
away and left them for that was all she knew then to do for
them.</p>

<p>The little Hortense Dehning was not of much importance yet in
the family living. Hortense was ten now and full of adoration for
her big sister and yet most of all for her brother. She was not
very strong and she could not run after him in his playing, but
sometimes he would sit and talk to her about himself and his
resolutions and the elaborated purposes that he was always losing.
George was always very moral and too he was very hopeful. He always
began his to-morrow with himself full of a firm resolution to do
all things every minute and to do them all very complicatedly.
George felt always he must bring up this little sister for he
George was the only one who knew the right ways for her.</p>

<p>And so he preached a great deal to her, and little Hortense was
very devout and adored her instructor. There was always a dependent
loyal up-gazing sweetness in her.</p>

<p>Being the baby of the family she was much petted by her father
and always she was overawed by her brother, who was very careful to
be noble to her. She was not just then very much with her mother
for she was not at this time very important to her. The mother was
so busy with her Julia, to find an important and good husband for
her. And so little Hortense was left much to her brother and to the
governess they had for her.</p>

<p>For us now as well as for the mother the important matter in the
history of the Dehning family is the marrying of Julia. I have said
that a strong family likeness bound all the three children firmly
to their mother. That fair good-looking prosperous woman had
stamped her image on each one of her children, but with only the
eldest Julia was the stamp deep, deeper than for the fair
good-looking exterior.</p>

<p>All the family had always looked up to Julia. They delighted in
her daring and in a kind of heroical sweetness there was in her.
They respected in her, her educated ways and her knowing always
what was the right way she and all of them should be doing. It was
not for nothing she was a crude domineering virgin. And she was
strong in the success she knew always that she had inside her, and
the family always admired and followed after.</p>

<p>Her father loved her energy and vigor, he loved her happiness
and the ardent honest feeling in her. He was always very ready to
yield to her, he liked to hear her when she explained to him in her
quick decisive manner the new faith she had so strongly in her, the
new illusions and the theories and new movements that the spirit of
her generation had taught to her. And he laughed at her new fangled
notions and her educated literary business and all her modern kinds
of improvements as he called them, and he abused them and too the
way she had of believing that she knew more than her mother, but
always it amused the father to have his bright quick daughter
explain all these new ways to him. Mr. Dehning knew well the value
of what he had learned by living, but his was a nature generous in
its feeling and he was always ready to listen to his children when
they could fairly demonstrate their ideas to him.</p>

<p>But Herman Dehning's pride and pleasure in his Julia was all
exceeded by the loud voiced satisfaction of the mother to whom this
brilliant daughter always seemed as the product of the mother's own
exertions. In her it was the vanity and exultation of creation as
well as of possession and she never fairly learned how completely
it was the girl who governed all the family life and how very much
of this young life was hidden from her knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning had never concerned himself very much with the
management of the family's way of living and the social life of his
wife and children. These things were all always arranged by Mrs.
Dehning and he was well content to let her do it though he often
grumbled at the foolishness and the expense and at his children
always having everything they ever wanted and so being sure to be
always good for nothing.</p>

<p>But always he was very proud of his wife and of his children,
though, a little, he always felt it was not right, their new
fangled ways of doing, and yet, truly, he was very proud of them
always, and indeed they were a group to gratify the pride that he
had in him, they were so vigorous prosperous and good-looking, and
honest, and always respectful to him, and surely they had good hope
of later winning for themselves all the happiness and success he
could wish them.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning at eighteen had lived through much of the
experience that can prepare a girl for womanhood and marriage.</p>

<p>I have said, there were a number of young men and boys connected
with the Dehning family, uncles and cousins, generous decent
considerate fellows, frank and honest in their friendships, and
simple in the fashion of the elder Dehning. With this kindred Julia
had always lived as with the members of one family. These men did
not supply for her the training and experience that helps to clear
the way for an impetuous woman through a world of passions, they
only made a sane and moral back-ground on which she in her later
life could learn to lean.</p>

<p>With any member of this kindred there would be, in a young and
ardent mind, no thought of love or marriage; nor were the sober
business men, young, old, or middle-aged, who came a great deal to
the house, attractive to her temper, for Julia was ambitious for
passion and position and she needed, too, a strain of romance. No
such kind of a man had really come to her and Julia was all ripe
for real experience, for even with her well guarded life she had
found the sickened sense that comes with learning that some men do
wrong. Passionate tempers have greatly this advantage of the
unpassionate variety; you can never guard them with such care but
that they find themselves full up with real experience and with the
after-taste of disillusion, but vitally as they are always hit they
always rise and plunge once more, while their poorly passionate
fellows who receive a vital blow never rise to faith again.</p>

<p>Julia as a little girl had had the usual experiences of
governess guarded children. She was first the confidant, then the
advisor, and last the arranger of the love affairs of her
established guardians. Then at her finishing school she became
acquainted with that dubious character, the adventuress, the type
to be found always in all kinds of places, a character eternally
attractive in its mystery and daring, and always able to attach
unto itself the most intelligent and honest of its comrades and
introduce them to queer vices.</p>

<p>And so Julia Dehning, like all other young girls, learnt many
kinds of lessons, and she saw many of the kinds of ways that lead
to wisdom, and always her life was healthy vigorous and active. She
learnt very well all the things young girls of her class were
taught then and she learnt too, in all kinds of ways, all the
things girls always can learn, somehow, to be wise in. And so Julia
was well prepared now to be a woman. She had singing and
piano-playing and sport and all regular school learning, she had
good looks, honesty, and brilliant courage, and in her young way a
certain kind of wisdom.</p>

<p>Always Julia was a passionate young woman and she had too a
heroical kind of sweetness in her way of winning. She was a
passionate young woman in the sense that always she was all alive
and always all the emotions she had in her being were as intense
and present to her feeling as a sensation like a pain is to others
who are less alive in their living. And all this time too, Julia
Dehning was busily arranging and directing the life and aspirations
of her family, for she was strong always in her good right to lead
them.</p>

<p>And so Julia Dehning when she was seventeen came out upon the
world, and she was filled full with courage and experience and
wisdom, and she was well ready now with this energy and wisdom to
cope with and conquer all the world and all men and women.</p>

<p>There is nothing more joyous than being healthful young and
energetic, and loving movement sunshine and clean air. Combine all
this with owning of a horse and courage enough to ride him wildly,
and God is good to overflowing to his children. It is pleasant too
to have occasionally a sympathetic comrade on such rides. Jameson
was a pleasant man of thirty five or thereabouts, a good free rider
and an easy talker. Julia knew him first at home and met him
usually while riding to the station to meet her father and the city
train. They would then either gallop home together or go about
riding through the glowing meadows of low oaks, racing cheerily
along the country roads, and dipping here and there into a pleasant
wood that broke the open country into shadow. They met too,
occasionally, in riding parties that went in search of new country
to discover and explore. It was all very pleasant and unaggressive,
but Julia began to notice that Mrs. Jameson frowned on her in anger
now, whenever they all met together. Then too Jameson grew
gradually less comradely, more intimate, and gross. Julia
understood at last and did not ride with him again.</p>

<p>Such incidents as these are common in the lives of all young
women and only are important in those intenser natures that, by
their understanding, make each incident into a situation. Such
natures suck a full experience from every act, and live so much in
what, to others, means so little, for is it not all common and to
be expected.</p>

<p>In Julia Dehning all experience had gone to make her wise now in
a desire for a master in the art of life, and it came to pass that
in Alfred Hersland brought by a cousin to visit at the house she
found a man who embodied her ideal in a way to make her heart beat
with surprise.</p>

<p>To a bourgeois mind that has within it a little of the fervor
for diversity, there can be nothing more attractive than a strain
of singularity that yet keeps well within the limits of
conventional respectability a singularity that is, so to speak,
well dressed and well set up. This is the nearest approach the
middle class young woman can ever hope to make to the indifference
and distinction of the really noble. When singularity goes further
and so gets to be always stronger, there comes to be in it too much
real danger for any middle class young woman to follow it farther.
Then comes the danger of being mixed by it so that no one just
seeing you can know it, and they will take you for the lowest,
those who are simply poor or because they have no other way to do
it. Surely no young person with any kind of middle class tradition
will ever do so, will ever put themselves in the way of such
danger, of getting so that no one can tell by just looking that
they are not like them who by their nature are always in an
ordinary undistinguished degradation. No! such kind of a danger can
never have to a young one of any middle class tradition any kind of
an attraction.</p>

<p>Now singularity that is neither crazy, sporty, faddish, or a
fashion, or low class with distinction, such a singularity, I say,
we have not made enough of yet so that any other one can really
know it, it is as yet an unknown product with us. It takes time to
make queer people, and to have others who can know it, time and a
certainty of place and means. Custom, passion, and a feel for
mother earth are needed to breed vital singularity in any man, and
alas, how poor we are in all these three.</p>

<p>Brother Singulars, we are misplaced in a generation that knows
not Joseph. We flee before the disapproval of our cousins, the
courageous condescension of our friends who gallantly sometimes
agree to walk the streets with us, from all them who never any way
can understand why such ways and not the others are so dear to us,
we fly to the kindly comfort of an older world accustomed to take
all manner of strange forms into its bosom and we leave our noble
order to be known under such forms as Alfred Hersland, a poor
thing, and even hardly then our own.</p>

<p>The Herslands were a Western family. David Hersland, the father,
had gone out to a Western state to make his money. His wife had
been born and brought up in the town of Bridgepoint. Later Mr.
Hersland had sent his son Alfred back there to go to college and
then to stay on and to study to become a lawyer. Now it was some
years later and Alfred Hersland had come again to Bridgepoint, to
settle down there to practice law there, and to make for himself
his own money.</p>

<p>The Hersland family had not had their money any longer than the
others of this community, but they had taken to culture and to
ideas quicker.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland was well put together to impress a courageous
crude young woman, who had an ambition for both passion and
position and who needed too to have a strain of romance with
them.</p>

<p>Hersland was tall and well dressed and sufficiently
good-looking, and he carried himself always with a certain easy
dignity and grace. His blond hair, which he wore parted in the
middle, a way of doing which at that time showed both courage and
conviction, covered a well shaped head. His features were strongly
marked, regular and attractive, his expression was pleasing, his
talk was always interesting, and his manners were dignified and
friendly. His eyes and voice meant knowledge, feeling, and a
pleasant mystery.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning threw herself eagerly into this new acquaintance.
She no longer wanted that men should bring with them the feel of
out of doors, for out of doors with men now was soiled to her sense
by the grossness of the Jamesons. Alfred Hersland brought with him
the world of art and things, a world to her but vaguely known. He
knew that some things made by men are things of beauty, and he
spoke this knowledge with interest and conviction.</p>

<p>The time passed quickly by with all this joy of fresh experience
and new faith.</p>

<p>Not many months from this first meeting, Julia gave her answer.
"Yes, I do care for you," she said, "and you and I will live our
lives together, always learning things and doing things, good
things they will be for us whatever other people may think or
say."</p>

<p>It had been a wonderful time for Julia Dehning these few months
of knowing Hersland. She had had, always, stirring within her, a
longing for the knowledge of made things, of works of art, of all
the wonders that make, she knew, a world, for certain other people.
(Twenty years ago, you know, it was still the dark ages in America
and lectures on art did not grow on every tongue that had tasted
the salt air of the mid-Atlantic. It was a feat then to know about
hill towns in Italy, one might have heard of Titian and of
Rembrandt but Giorgone and Botticelli were still sacred to the few,
one did not then yet have to seek, to find for oneself new painters
and new places.) It was a very real desire, this longing for the
wisdom of all culture, this that had been always strong in Julia.
Of course, mostly, such longing in Julia, took the form of moral
idealism, the only form of culture the spare American imagination
takes natural refuge in.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning, like all of her kind of people, needed
everything, for anything could feed her. It was not strong meat
that Hersland offered to her, but her palate was eager, this had
the flavour of the dishes she longed to have eaten and to have
inside her. To her young crude virgin desire the food he offered to
her was plenty real enough to deeply content her.</p>

<p>Of the family about her, it was only Julia who found him worthy
to be so important to her. The cousins and the uncles, the men who
could make for her the sane and moral background that would give a
wholesome middle class condition always to her, they did not like
it much that Hersland was now so important for her. They said
nothing to her, but they did not like to have him always about with
her. He was not their kind and every minute they could know it, and
they did not need him, either out in the world in business or at
home where they were happy in the rich and solid family comfort
they always had had with the Dehnings; and these men could not find
Hersland's knowledge worth much for them, and they did not have it
in them that it had a meaning for them that he Hersland had in him,
knowledge and a certain kind of feeling that they never could have
inside them. What could a pleasant mystery in a man mean to them
except only that any man with any sense in him would not ever trust
anything real to him.</p>

<p>But they said nothing, any of them, they knew nothing real
against him, and, anyhow, it was not business for them to interfere
with other people's matters, for after all it was to the Dehnings
for them, and it did not in any way really concern any of the
others of them. As men they could not feel it in them the right to
interfere with a woman who did not as a child or a wife really
belong to them.</p>

<p>The boy George and the little sister were too young to think
very much about him. The young brother did not feel it in himself
much to like him, for young George you may remember was young and
heroic, out of doors was not yet in any way soiled for him and he
needed that kind of a thing in a man to attract him, but anyhow,
Julia liked him and it would be hard for George not to think Julia
could judge better about him than any of the other members of the
family could have it to know in them.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning as yet had said nothing One day he was out walking
and his daughter was with him. "Julia hadn't you better be a little
careful how much you encourage that young Hersland."</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning, always, in his working, began very far away from a
thing he meant later to be firmly attacking. And always in such a
far away beginning, he would be looking sharply, out from him, in a
sidelong, piercing, deprecating, challenging, fashion, the kind of
a way he had always of looking when his wife, who, by her more than
equal living, as it often is with a woman, had not in any kind of a
way any fear in her of him, could be going to rebuke him. And this
way he had of looking, always made him an old man to his children,
and mostly there was a fear then in them, only now Julia was
strong, other things were bright and glowing, and she could not now
feel it in him, the old grown man's sharp outward looking that,
closing him, went always so straight into them.</p>

<p>And so, now, filled full with her new warm imagining, Julia
Dehning had not any kind of a fear from him, the kind of a fear a
young grown woman has almost always from an old man's looking.</p>

<p>"Why papa!" she had eagerly quickly demanded of him.</p>

<p>"I say Julia I don't know anything against him. Yes, I say to
you Julia I don't know of anything there is against him. I have
looked up all the record there is yet of him and I haven't heard
anything against him but Julia, I say, somehow I don't quite like
him. His family are alright, I know a man who knows all Gossols,
and I asked him, he says yes the family are all successful and well
appearing, I say Julia I don't say anything against him only I
don't altogether trust him. I know all about his father, everybody
has heard of David Hersland, he is the richest man they ever had in
Gossols, I know too how he made his own money out there, and
everybody says he is alright and he made his own money by his own
work; I don't say anything against him, only Julia I think you
better be a little careful with him, somehow I don't altogether
like him."</p>

<p>"Isn't that papa because he plays the piano and parts his hair
that way in the middle." Julia was eager in her questioning.</p>

<p>The father laughed, "I guess there is some reason in your
question Julia, I don't like that kind of thing much in a man,
that's right. It's foolish in a man who wants to make a success
making a living, it's foolish to do things that make other men feel
they don't want to trust him. It's alright if he was just doing
nothing, only I never would want you to tie up with a man who
didn't know how to take care of himself to make a living, but
Hersland has got ambition, he wants to be a lawyer who makes a big
success with his living, I know him, and that don't seem to me the
kind of a way to make a good beginning, but may be I am wrong, you
young ones always think you know everything. Anyhow Julia I think
you better be a little careful with him."</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning paused, and they walked on a little while and she
said nothing.</p>

<p>Henry Dehning had had a long time to learn how to judge the
value in a man, the values in them that in their lives concerned
him. The more one looked into the quality of him the more one
learned respect for the power he had in him and the more wonder one
had in them at the gentleness that almost never left him.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning had a massive face made with a firm unagressive
chin, loose masses in the cheeks and a strong curved nose, his eyes
were blue and always clear, and set between loose pouches
underneath and coarse rough overhanging brows. His strong-skulled
rounded head was covered with thinning greyish hair. He was a man
of medium height, stocky build and sharply squared shoulders, a man
quick in his movements, slow in his judgments, and cheerful in his
temper; a man to understand and to make use of men, slow to anger
and tenacious, without heat or bitterness.</p>

<p>His children knew the value of his judgments and the generous
quality of his understanding, still he was of the old generation,
they of the new, with all his wisdom surely he must fail to see the
meanings in the unaccustomed.</p>

<p>"You know Julia," Mr. Dehning went on after a silent interval of
walking when they had each been pretty busy with their own
thinking, "you know Julia, your mother doesn't like him."</p>

<p>"Oh! mamma!" Julia broke out, "you know how mamma is, he talks
about love and beauty and mamma thinks it ought to be all wedding
dresses and a fine house when it isn't money and business. She
would be the same about anybody that I would want."</p>

<p>"Yes Julia, those are your literary notions but a lawyer has got
to be a business man now and you like success and money as well as
any one. You have always had everything you wanted and you don't
want to get along without it. Literary effects and modern
improvements are alright for women but with Hersland it ought to be
different, it ought to be that he has the kind of sense he needs in
his business. I don't say he hasn't got good sense in him to make a
success in him and you want to be careful I say Julia, how far you
go with him."</p>

<p>"I know papa just what you mean, and that's alright papa, I know
it, but you know yourself papa it isn't everything, now, is it. I
know papa how you feel about it, you think we young ones are all
wrong the way we look at it, but you say yourself papa how
different things are nowadays from the way they used to be when you
began with it, and surely papa it can't hurt a man to be
interesting even if he wants to make a success in his
business."</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning shook his head but he did not so carry much
conviction to his daughter and on this day they said no more about
the matter.</p>

<p>And so Julia began and surely she would win in the struggle. She
worked every day and very hard, and slowly she began to bring her
father to it. Mrs. Dehning would have to agree if he said she could
have it and no one else's opinion in the matter was important.</p>

<p>Time and again Julia would be sure she had succeeded, for her
father always listened to her "yes papa I know it, I know what you
mean and it's alright, only you know yourself everything nowadays
is very different, you know that yourself papa, you know you always
say it," and he liked to hear her say it, and he listened with
amusement, and he approved when she knew how to do it, when she
brought out with great fervor and with much repeating, great
arguments against all his objections. He always openly admired the
bright way she had then to make clear to him all her theories and
convictions, the new faith in her, the new ideas she had of life
and business.</p>

<p>And then Julia would be sure she had convinced him, for how
could a reasonable man ever resist it, she knew she had good
reasons in her.</p>

<p>And each day when their talk was ending and she was saying to
him, "you know papa you say yourself now that it's all different, I
know what you mean papa, always, I know how you want me to do it,
but papa, really, I am not talking without thinking hard about it,
you know I listen to you and want to understand it but you know
papa, now don't you, that it will be alright and that I am alright
just the way you like to have me do it," and then he would have
stopped listening to her and his mind would have sort of shut up
away from her, and she still held his arm for they had been walking
all this time up and down as was their custom every afternoon
together, and yet he then himself had quite slipped away from her,
and now he would be looking at her with that sharp completed look
that, always so full of his own understanding, could not leave it
open any way to her to reach inside to him to let in any other kind
of a meaning.</p>

<p>And then he would for that time altogether leave her and the
last thing he always would say to her, with the quick movement he
had when he felt no more time in him then for her. "Alright, yes,
well tomorrow is another day Julia I say to-morrow is another day
Julia and you think it all over and we will talk about it further,
perhaps to-morrow, I say to-morrow is another day Julia. There is
your mother there now Julia, you better go in now to her."</p>

<p>It was hard for Julia to have such a kind of resistance fighting
against her. It was hard for an impatient and eager temper to
endure the kind of a way her father always finished off his long
talks with her. It was hard for Julia to have to always begin over
every time she started to talk about it with her father. But he was
very proud of her, she knew very well his feeling for her, she knew
very well too how to win him to agree in the end with her. She
loved it in a way the struggle he made each day a new one for her.
They loved and admired and respected each other very much this
daughter and her father. They understood very well both of them how
to please while they were combating with each other. And so each
to-morrow they met, and Julia was sturdy and had strong faith in
her, and always, her father, a long time each day listened to
her.</p>

<p>Hersland could do nothing all this time but wait for Julia to
persuade her father. They were both agreed, Hersland and Julia,
that any effort on his part to change Mr. Dehning's opinion would
only make the fight for Julia so much harder. It was always there
that Mr. Dehning did not like young Hersland, and the noblest words
and the best acts, never, in any kind of a distrusted person, give
any evidence against his condemnation. It is never facts that tell,
they are the same when they mean very different things. It is never
facts that can make a man feel any thing to be made different to
him when he has any kind of a judgment in him. Facts can never tell
him anything truly about another man in his opinion. It was always
there, Mr. Dehning somehow did not trust this man. And so it was
only Julia, who by always repeating, perhaps could find a way to
change him.</p>

<p>So Julia struggled every day, to have him, arguing discoursing
explaining and appealing. She was always winning but it was slow
progress like that in very steep and slippery climbing. For every
forward movement of three feet she always slipped back two,
sometimes all three and often four and five and six and seven. It
was long eager steady fighting but the father was slowly
understanding that his daughter wanted this thing enough to stand
hard by it and with such a feeling and no real fact against the
man, such a father was bound to let her some time get married to
him.</p>

<p>"I tell you what Julia what I been thinking. When we all get
back to town you can tell better whether you do really want him. I
say we better leave off all this talking and just wait till we get
home now again. I don't say no Julia and I don't say yes to you.
When everybody gets back to town and you are busy and running
around with your girls and talking and meeting all the other people
and the other kinds of young men, you can tell much better then
whether all this business is not all just talking with you. I say
now Julia we will wait and just see how you feel about it later. I
say we will talk it all over when we get home and you are
altogether with all your friends there. I say Julia I don't say no
to you and I don't say yes yet to you. I say when we get home we
will talk it over again all together and then if nothing turns up
new against him, and you still want him, I say if then you still
want him enough to trust to him and to trust to your own judgment
about him, we will see what we can do about him."</p>

<p>"Alright papa," Julia said to him, "alright I won't even see
Alfy any more till we get back to town then, and papa I won't say
another word to you about it. I'll just go and ride around the
country and think hard the way you like to have me do it about what
we both have said about it."</p>

<p>It was a well meant intention this in Julia of riding by herself
around the country and thinking hard about what they had both said
about it, but not the certain way to end in a passionate young
woman her first intense emotion. The wide and glowing meadows of
low oaks, the clean clear tingling autumn air, the blaze of color
in the bits of woods, the freedom and the rush of rapid motion on
the open road, the joy of living in a vital world, the ecstasy of
loving and of love, the intensity of feeling in the ardent young,
it surely was not so that Julia Dehning could win the sober reason
that should judge of men.</p>

<p>And always every day it came and always every day when it was
ending it would be the same. "Yes I certainly do care for him and I
do know him. And he and I will live our lives together always
learning things and doing things, good things they will be for us
whatever other people may think or say."</p>

<p>And so at last, filled full with faith and hope and fine new joy
she went back to her busy city life, strong in the passion of her
eager young imagining.</p>

<p>The home the rich and self made merchant makes to hold his
family and himself is always like the city where his fortune has
been made. In London it is like that rich and endless dark and
gloomy place, in Paris it is filled with pleasant toys, cheery and
light and made of gilded decoration and white paint, and in
Bridgepoint it was neither gloomy nor yet joyous but like a large
and splendid canvas completely painted over but painted full of
empty space.</p>

<p>The Dehning city house was of this sort. A nervous restlessness
of luxury was through it all. Often the father would complain of
the unreasoning extravagance to which his family was addicted but
these upbraidings had not much result for the rebuke came from
conviction and not from any habit of his own.</p>

<p>It was good solid riches in the Dehning house, a parlor full of
ornate marbles placed on yellow onyx stands, chairs gold and white
of various size and shape, a delicate blue silk brocaded covering
on the walls and a ceiling painted pink with angels and cupids all
about, a dining room all dark and gold, a living room all rich and
gold and red with built-in-couches, glass-covered book-cases and
paintings of well washed peasants of the German school, and large
and dressed up bedrooms all light and blue and white. (All this was
twenty years ago in the dark age, you know, before the passion for
the simple line and the toned burlap on the wall and wooden
panelling all classic and severe.) Marbles and bronzes and crystal
chandeliers and gas logs finished out each room. And always
everywhere there were complicated ways to wash, and dressing tables
filled full of brushes, sponges, instruments, and ways to make one
clean, and to help out all the special doctors in their work.</p>

<p>It was good riches in this house and here it was that Julia
Dehning dreamed of other worlds and here each day she grew more
firm in her resolve for that free wide and cultured life to which
for her young Hersland had the key.</p>

<p>At last it was agreed that these two young people should become
engaged, but not be married for a year to come, and if nothing new
had then turned up, the father said he would then no longer
interfere. And so the marriage now was made for with these kind of
people an engagement always meant a marriage excepting only for the
gravest cause. And Alfred Hersland and Julia had this time to learn
each other's natures and prepare themselves for the event.</p>

<p>When the twelve months had passed away no grave cause had come
to make a reason why this marriage should not be. Julia was twelve
months older now, and wiser, and through this wisdom had in general
a little more distrusting in her, but never in any kind of a way
was she changing about the new world she needed now to content her
and she was firm always in her intention to marry Alfred Hersland.
She loved him then with all the strength of her eager young
imagining, though dimly, somewhere, in her head and heart now there
was sometimes a vague dread that comes of ignorance and a beginning
wisdom, a distrust she could not then yet seize and look on so that
she could really know it, but a distrust that often was there,
somewhere in the background, somehow sometimes mixed there to her
sense, in with her energy, her new faith, and her feeling.</p>

<p>For a girl like Julia Dehning, all men, excepting those of an
outside unknown world, these one read about in books and never
really could believe in, for it is a strange feeling one has in
one's later living, when one finds the story-books really have
truth in them, for one loved the story-books earlier, one loved to
read them but one never really believed there was truth in them,
and later when one by living has gained a new illusion and a kind
of wisdom, and one reads again in them, there it is, the things we
have learned since to believe in, there it is and we know then that
the man or the woman who wrote them had just the same kind of
wisdom in them we have been spending our lives winning, and this
shows to any one wise in learning that no young people can learn
wisdom from the talking of the older ones around them. If they
cannot believe the things they read in the story-books where it is
all made lifelike, real and interesting for them, how should they
ever learn things from older people's talking. Its foolish to
expect such things of them. No let them read the story-books we
write for them, they don't learn much, to be sure, but more than
they can from their fathers', mothers', aunts' and uncles' talking.
Yes from their fathers' and their mothers' living they can get some
wisdom, yes supply them with a tradition by your lives, you grown
men and women, and for the rest let them come to us for their
teaching.</p>

<p>But now to come back to Julia Dehning. As I was saying, to a
girl like Julia Dehning, all men, excepting those of an outside
unknown world, those one reads about in books and never really can
believe in, or men like Jameson to whom one never could belong and
whom one always knows, now after having once begun with one's
living, for what they are whenever one met with them, I say for a
girl like Julia Dehning, with the family with which she had all her
life been living, to her all men that could be counted as men by
her and could be thought of as belonging ever to her, they must be,
all, good strong gentle creatures, honest and honorable and
honoring. For her to doubt this of all men, of decent men, of men
whom she could ever know well or belong to, to doubt this would be
for her to recreate the world and make one all from her own head.
Surely, of course, she knew it, there were the men one could read
of in the books and hear of in the scandal of the daily news, but
never could such things be true of men of her own world. For her to
think it in herself as real any such a thing would be for her to
imagine a vain thing, to recreate the world and make a new one all
out of her own head.</p>

<p>No, this was a thought that could not come to her to really
think, and so for her the warnings of her father carried no real
truth. Of course Alfred Hersland was a good and honest man. All
decent men, all men who belonged to her own kind and to whom she
could by any chance belong, were good and straight. They had this
as they had all simple rights in a sane and simple world. Hersland
had besides that he was brilliant, that he knew that there were
things of beauty in the world, and that he was in his bearing and
appearance a distinguished man. And then over and above all this,
he was so freely passionate in his fervent love.</p>

<p>And so the marriage was really to be made. Mrs. Dehning now all
reconciled and eager, began the trousseau and the preparation of
the house that the young couple were to have as a wedding portion
from the elder Dehnings.</p>

<p>In dresses, hats and shoes and gloves and underwear, and jewel
ornaments, Julia was very ready to follow her mother in her choice
and to agree with her in all variety and richness of trimming in
material, but in the furnishing of her own house it must be as she
wished, taught as she now had been that there were things of beauty
in the world and that decoration should be strange and like old
fashions, not be in the new. To have the older things themselves
had not yet come to her to know, nor just how old was the best time
that they should be. It was queer in its results this mingling of
old taste and new desire.</p>

<p>The mother was all disgusted, half-impressed; she sneered at
these new notions to her daughter and bragged of it to all of her
acquaintance. She followed Julia about now from store to store,
struggling to put in a little her own way, but always she was
beaten back and overborne by the eagerness of knowing and the
hardness of unconsidering disregard with which her daughter met her
words.</p>

<p>The wedding day drew quickly near with all this sharp endeavor
of making her new home just what it should be for the life which
was to come. Julia thought more of her ideals these days than of
her man. Hersland had always, a little, meant more to her as an
ideal than as a creature to be known and loved. She had made him,
to herself, as she was now making her new house, an unharmonious
unreality, a bringing complicated natural tastes to the
simplicities of fitness and of decoration of a self-digested older
world.</p>

<p>I say again, this was all twenty years ago before the passion
for the simple line and toned green burlap on the wall and wooden
panelling all classic and severe. But the moral force was making
then, as now, in art, all for the simple line, though then it had
not come to be, as now alas it is, that natural sense for gilding
and all kinds of paint and complicated decoration in design all
must be suppressed and thrust away, and so take from us the last
small hope that something real might spring from crudity and luxury
in ornament. In those days there was still some freedom left to
love elaboration in good workmanship and ornate rococoness and
complication in design. And all the houses of one's friends and new
school rooms and settlements in slums and dining halls and city
clubs, had not yet taken on this modern sad resemblance to a
college woman's college room.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning's new house was in arrangement a small edition of
her mother's. In ways to wash, to help out all the special doctors
in their work, in sponges, brushes, running water everywhere, in
hygienic ways to air things and keep ones self and everything all
clean, this house that Julia was to make fit for her new life which
was to come, in this it was very like the old one she had lived in,
but always here there were more plunges, douches, showers, ways to
get cold water, luxury in freezing, in hardening, than her mother's
house had ever afforded to them. In her mother's house there were
many ways to get clean but they mostly suggested warm water and a
certain comfort, here in the new house was a sterner feeling, it
must be a cold world, that one could keep one's soul high and clean
in.</p>

<p>All through this new house there were no solid warm substantial
riches. There were no silks in curtains, no blue brocade here, no
glass chandeliers to make prisms and give tinklings. Here the
parlor was covered with modern sombre tapestry, the ceiling all in
tone the chairs as near to good colonial as modern imitation can
effect, and all about dark aesthetic ornaments from China and
Japan. Paintings there were none, only carbon photographs framed
close, in dull and wooden frames.</p>

<p>The dining room was without brilliancy, for there can be no
brilliance in a real aesthetic aspiration. The chairs were made
after some old french fashion, not very certain what, and covered
with dull tapestry, copied without life from old designs, the room
was all a discreet green with simple oaken wood-work underneath.
The living rooms were a prevailing red, that certain shade of red
like that certain shade of green, dull, without hope, the shade
that so completely bodies forth the ethically aesthetic aspiration
of the spare American emotion. Everywhere were carbon photographs
upon the walls sadly framed in painted wooden frames. Free couches,
open book-cases, and fire places with really burning logs, finished
out each room.</p>

<p>These were triumphant days for Julia. Every day she led her
family a new flight and they followed after agape with
wonderdisapproval and with pride. The mother almost lost all sense
of her creation of this original and brilliant daughter, she was
almost ready to admit the obedience and defeat she now had in her.
Sometimes she still had a little resistance to her but mostly she
was swelling inside and to all around her with her admiration and
her pride in this new wonderful kind of a daughter.</p>

<p>The father had always been convinced and proud even when he had
disapproved the opinions of his daughter. He now took a solid
satisfaction in the completeness of accomplishment she now had in
her. To her father, to know well what one wanted, and to win it, by
patient steady fighting for it, was the best act a man or woman
could accomplish, and well had his daughter done it. She had won
it, she knew very well what she wanted and she had it. He still
shook his head at her new fangled notions, her literary effects,
the artistic kind of new improvement, as he called it, that she put
into her new house to make it perfect. He did not understand it and
he always said it, but he was very proud to see her do it, and he
bragged to everybody and made them listen to it, of his daughter
and the wonderful new kind of a house she had, and the bright way
she knew how to do it.</p>

<p>The little Hortense had always worshipped this wonderful big
sister, and the boy George admired too, and followed after.</p>

<p>Altogether these last weeks were brilliant days for Julia.</p>

<p>But always, a little, through all this pride in domination and
in the admiration of her family, there was there, somewhere, in the
background, to her sense, a vague uncertain kind of feeling as to
her understanding and her right. Mostly she had a firm strong
feeling in her, but always, a little, there was there, a kind of a
doubting somewhere in her. She never in these days did any very
real thinking about Hersland as a man to be to her as a husband to
control her. But, somehow, a little, he was there in her as an
unknown power that might attack her, though she knew very well she
had in her a wisdom and experience of life that she could feel
strong now always inside her.</p>

<p>A few weeks before the day they were to be married and to begin
their new free life together, this vague distrust in Julia became a
little sharper. Alfy was talking to her one night about the good
life they were to have soon together, about their prospects and his
hopes for the future. "I've some good schemes Julia in my head," he
said to her, "and I mean to do big things, and with a safe man like
your father to back me through now I think I can." Julia somehow
was startled though this kind of saying in him was not new to her.
"Why what do you mean Alfy?" "Why," he went on, "I want to do some
things that have big money and big risks in them and a man as well
known as your father for wealth and reliability for a father-in-law
will do all that I need. Of course you know Julia," he added very
simply enough for her, "you must not talk to him about such things
now. You are my wife, my own darling, and you and I will live our
lives together always loving and believing in the same good
thing."</p>

<p>He said it simply enough to her and he was safe. Julia would not
speak of such things now to her father. No torment of doubt, no
certainty of misery could bring her to ask questions of her father,
now, about the new life she had before her. Hersland was safe,
though very simply now, he often made for her that sharp uncertain
feeling more dreadful and more clear before her. He was not
different in his ways or in his talk to her from the way he always
had been with her, but somehow now it had come to her, to see, as
dying men are said to see, clearly and freely things as they are
and not as she had wished them to be for her.</p>

<p>And then she would remember suddenly what she had really thought
he was, and she felt, she knew that all that former thought was
truer better judgment than this sudden sight, and so she dulled her
momentary clearing mind and hugged her old illusions to her
breast.</p>

<p>"Alfy didn't mean it like that," she said over to herself, "he
couldn't mean it like that. He only meant that papa would help him
along in his career and of course papa will. Oh I know he didn't
really mean it like that, he couldn't mean it like that. Anyhow I
will ask him what he really meant."</p>

<p>And she asked him and he freely made her understand just what it
was he meant. It sounded better then, a little better as he told it
to her more at length, but it left her a foreboding sense that
perhaps the world had meanings in it that could be hard for her to
understand and judge.</p>

<p>But now she had to think that it was all, as it had a little
sounded, good and best. She had to think it so else how could she
marry him, and how could she not marry him. She had to marry him,
and so she had to think it so, and she would think it so, and
did.</p>

<p>In a few days more the actual marrying was done and their lives
together always doing things and learning things was at last
begun.<br>

<h2>2. [The Hersland Parents]</h2>

<p>Bear it in your mind my reader, but truly I never feel it that
there ever can be for me any such a creature, no it is this
scribbled and dirty and lined paper that is really to be to me
always my receiver&mdash;but anyhow reader, bear it in your
mind&mdash;will there be for me ever any such a creature&mdash;what
I have said always before to you, that this that I write down a
little each day here on my scraps of paper for you is not just an
ordinary kind of novel with a plot and conversations to amuse you,
but a record of a decent family progress respectably lived by us
and our fathers and our mothers, and our grandfathers, and
grandmothers, and this is by me carefully a little each day to be
written down here; and so my reader arm yourself in every kind of a
way to be patient, and to be eager, for you must always have it now
before you to hear much more of these many kinds of decent ordinary
people, of old, grown, grand-fathers and grand-mothers, of growing
old fathers and growing old mothers, of ourselves who are always to
be young grown men and women for us, and then there are still to be
others and we must wait and see the younger fathers and young
mothers bear them for us, these younger fathers and young mothers
who always are ourselves inside us, who are to be always young
grown men and women to us. And so listen while I tell you all about
us, and wait while I hasten slowly forwards, and love, please, this
history of this decent family's progress.</p>

<p>Yes it is a misfortune we have inside us, some few of us, I
cannot deny it to you, all you others, it is true the simple
interest I take in my family's progress. I have it, this interest
in ordinary middle class existence, in simple firm ordinary middle
class traditions, in sordid material unaspiring visions, in a
repeating, common, decent enough kind of living, with no fine kind
of fancy ways inside us, no excitements to surprise us, no new ways
of being bad or good to win us.</p>

<p>You see, it is just an ordinary middle class tradition we must
use to understand this family's progress. There must be no aspiring
thoughts inside us, there must be a feeling always in us of being
in a kind of way in business always honest, there must be in a kind
of ordinary way always there inside us the sense of decent enough
ways of living for us. Yes I am strong to declare that I have it,
here in the heart of this high, aspiring, excitement loving people
who despise it,&mdash;I throw myself open to the public,&mdash;I
take a simple interest in the ordinary kind of families, histories,
I believe in simple middle class monotonous tradition, in a way in
honest enough business methods.</p>

<p>Middle-class, middle-class, I know no one of my friends who will
admit it, one can find no one among you all to belong to it, I know
that here we are to be democratic and aristocratic and not have it,
for middle class is sordid material unillusioned unaspiring and
always monotonous for it is always there and to be always repeated,
and yet I am strong, and I am right, and I know it, and I say it to
you and you are to listen to it, yes here in the heart of a people
who despise it, that a material middle class who know they are it,
with their straightened bond of family to control it, is the one
thing always human, vital, and worthy it&mdash;worthy that all
monotonously shall repeat it,&mdash;and from which has always
sprung, and all who really look can see it, the very best the world
can ever know, and everywhere we always need it.</p>

<p>The Herslands were a western family. David Hersland as a young
man had gone far into the new country to make his money. He had
succeeded very well there in making money. He had settled down in
Gossols and had lived there for twenty years and more now.</p>

<p>He had made a big fortune. David Hersland was in some ways a
splendid kind of person.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersland had brought his wife to Gossols with him. He had
married her in Bridgepoint when his fortune was just beginning. His
children had all been born in Gossols to him. They were really
western, all of them, all through them. There were three of them,
Martha, Alfred, David, there had been two others but they had died
as little children. Now Martha, after many changes, was home again
with him. Alfred who had never yet been any trouble to him was gone
to Bridgepoint to marry Julia Dehning and then there as a lawyer to
win for himself his own way of living. And the youngest David was
soon to follow Alfred to Bridgepoint, to go to college there and to
decide in him, as his way always had been and no one could ever
understand him, from day to day what life meant to him to make it
worth his living.</p>

<p>And so when Alfred Hersland first met Julia Dehning, his family
father mother Martha and David were still living there in Gossols.
The mother was already now a little ailing, the father had no
longer his old strength for living, Martha had come back out of her
trouble to them, Alfred had gone away and left them, David was very
soon to follow him. They had their old place in Gossols to live in
but it had not the beauty and the wonder now it had had all these
years for them. Joy was a little dim inside now for all of
them.</p>

<p>For many years it had been full of content, this home they had
always lived in. The Herslands had never had a city house to be
restless around them and to give restlessness inside to them. They
had all these years been in the place they now lived in.</p>

<p>This house they had always lived in was not in the part of
Gossols where the other rich people mostly were living. It was an
old place left over from the days when Gossols was just beginning.
It was grounds about ten acres large, fenced in with just ordinary
kind of rail fencing, it had a not very large wooden house standing
on the rising ground in the center with a winding avenue of
eucalyptus, blue gum, leading from it to the gateway. There was,
just around the house, a pleasant garden, in front were green lawns
not very carefully attended and with large trees in the center
whose roots always sucked up for themselves almost all the
moisture, water in this dry western country could not be used just
to keep things green and pretty and so, often, the grass was very
dry in summer, but it was very pleasant then lying there watching
the birds, black in the bright sunlight and sailing, and the firm
white summer clouds breaking away from the horizon and slowly
moving. It was very wonderful there in the summer with the dry
heat, and the sun burning, and the hot earth for sleeping; and then
in the winter with the rain, and the north wind blowing that would
bend the trees and often break them, and the owls in the walls
scaring you with their tumbling.</p>

<p>All the rest of the ten acres was for hay and a little vegetable
gardening and an orchard with all the kinds of fruit trees that
could be got there to do any growing.</p>

<p>In the summer it was good for generous sweating to help the men
make the hay into bails for its preserving and it was well for ones
growing to eat radishes pulled with the black earth sticking to
them and to chew the mustard and find roots with all kinds of funny
flavors in them, and to fill ones hat with fruit and sit on the dry
ploughed ground and eat and think and sleep and read and dream and
never hear them when they would all be calling; and then when the
quail came it was fun to go shooting, and then when the wind and
the rain and the ground were ready to help seeds in their growing,
it was good fun to help plant them, and the wind would be so strong
it would blow the leaves and branches of the trees down around them
and you could shout and work and get wet and be all soaking and run
out full into the strong wind and let it dry you, in between the
gusts of rain that left you soaking. It was fun all the things that
happened all the year there then.</p>

<p>And all around the whole fence that shut these joys in was a
hedge of roses, not wild, they had been planted, but now they were
very sweet and small and abundant and all the people from that part
of Gossols came to pick the leaves to make sweet scented jars and
pillows, and always all the Herslands were indignant and they would
let loose the dogs to bark and scare them but still the roses grew
and always all the people came and took them. And altogether the
Herslands always loved it there in their old home in Gossols.</p>

<p>David Hersland's mother was that good foreign woman who was
strong to bear many children and always after was very strong to
lead them. The old woman was a great mountain. Her back even in her
older age was straight, flat, and firmly supporting. She had it in
her to uphold around her, her man, her family, and everybody else
whom she saw needing directing. She was a powerful woman and strong
to bear many children and always after she would be strong to lead
them. She had a few weak ways in her toward some of them, mostly
toward one of them who had a bad way of eating too much and being
weak and loving, and his mother never could be strong to correct
him, no she could not be strong to let his brothers try and save
him, and so he died a glutton, but the old mother was dead too by
then and she did not have the sorrow of seeing what came to
him.</p>

<p>Always this strong foreign woman was great and good and
directing, She led her family out of the old world into the new one
and there they learned through her and by themselves, almost every
one of them, how to make for themselves each one a sufficient
fortune.</p>

<p>Yes it was she who lead them all out of the old world into the
new one. The father was not a man ever to do any such leading. He
was a butcher by trade. He was a very gentle creature in his
nature. He loved to sit and think and he loved to be important in
religion. He was a small man, well enough made, with a nice face,
blue eyes, and a little lightish colored beard. He loved his eating
and a quiet life, he loved his Martha and his children, and mostly
he liked all the world.</p>

<p>It would never come to him to think of a new world. He never
wanted to lose anything he ever had had around him. He did not want
to go to a new world. He would go,&mdash;yes to be sure it would be
very nice there, only it was very nice here and here he was
important in religion,&mdash;and he liked his village and his shop
and everything he had known all his life there, and the house they
had had ever since he married his good Martha and settled himself
to be comfortable together with her,&mdash;and now they had their
children. Yes, alright, perhaps, maybe she was right, there was no
reason, the neighbors had all gotten so rich going to America,
there was no reason they shouldn't go and get rich there, alright
he would go if his Martha talked about it so much to him, alright,
his Martha could fix it anyway she liked it, yes it would be nice
to have all of them get rich there. He would go, yes to be sure it
would be nice there, but it was very nice here and he had his
religion, and he liked his village and his shop and everything he
had known all his life here, and the house they had always lived in
since he had married his good Martha, and they had settled to be so
comfortable there and to stay there, and now they had all those
good children. But, yes, alright, perhaps, maybe she was right,
there was no reason, the neighbors had all gotten so rich going to
America, there was no reason they shouldn't all get rich too there,
yes it would be very nice then, to have them all go and get rich
there. Alright he would go, they would all go and get rich there,
Martha could fix it if she wanted so badly to have it, she would be
always talking to him about it. Martha could fix it anyway she
liked it, yes it would be nice to have all of them get rich there
like the neighbors who were writing all the time how rich they had
it, and it would be good for the children to have it, and to send
money to some of the old folks who would need it, the way the
neighbors always did. Yes the neighbors always were sending money
to their father when he needed to have it. Alright they would all
go, his Martha could fix it anyway she liked it. If she wanted he
would do it.</p>

<p>Martha began then and she soon sold their business and the
things on the little farm and in the shop and in their house, and
kept only the few things she knew they needed. Her man liked it
very well then this being so important and he could use it as he
liked to do religion. He liked it very well to see his wife do all
this selling. He liked the feeling he had in him when they were all
so busy buying and selling all around him, but when the people came
to take the things he had been so important about when his wife was
selling, then it was a very different feeling he had in him. It was
hard for him then the ending. He had liked it very well while they
were selling. He had liked the feeling of all the doing and the
moving and the being important to all of them and everybody always
talking.</p>

<p>It had been very pleasant to him. He never really had to do any
deciding, and he had all the emotion and the important feeling, it
was just like in religion.</p>

<p>But it was not so pleasant for him when the people came and took
the things it had been so pleasant selling. It hurt him to have the
things he loved go away from him, and he wanted to give back the
money to all of them so that he could keep them. But he knew that
that could not be done and he still keep his important feeling that
was so pleasant to him; and then too Martha would not let him. He
said nothing to the people when they came to take the things it had
been so pleasant selling to them, he was only very slow in giving
the things to them. He would lose them so that it was hard to find
them but the children and Martha always found them.</p>

<p>Almost everything was sold and the people came and took them. He
could not stop them. Now the things did not belong to him any more.
Nothing now belonged to him. There was another man in his shop and
he acted, in standing there and in selling, just as if it had all
always belonged to him. It made poor David Hersland very sad to see
him standing there, chopping, talking, selling, wiping his hands on
his apron, acting as if it had all always belonged to him, now when
there was no place anymore anywhere for Hersland, a place that
really belonged to him.</p>

<p>It was too late now, he had done as his Martha had made him. He
would have liked to buy back all that they had been selling. It was
very hard to keep him moving. It was hard to start him and it was
almost harder to keep him going. Now he wanted to settle down again
and keep on staying. Perhaps the man who had bought his shop would
sell it back to him if they would pay him. "No David," his wife
said to him. "We've got to go now, don't talk so foolishly about
buying when we just hardly have got through selling. No David,
don't you see how the children are all so excited about going. How
can you talk so when we have to be working every minute and in two
days now we've got to be moving."</p>

<p>Yes it was hard to start him but it was almost harder to keep
him going. His Martha worked hard with him to keep him moving. She
had to tell it to him very often that now there was no other way
for him to be doing. Now they were started they just had to keep
going.</p>

<p>Yes it was very hard to keep him moving. It was hard to start
him but it was even harder to keep him going. But now it was all
done and they were all of them ready to do the last beginning. They
were all already to leave the next morning. All the things they had
kept had been put in a wagon, the littlest children were to ride on
top of them, the rest were to walk beside them until they came to
the city by the water where they would find the ship that was to
take them to that new world where they were all to make a
fortune.</p>

<p>They started very well the next morning, with all the people to
say good-by to them and with all the things they needed piled in
the wagon, the littlest children set on top of them, the rest of
them to walk beside them. The mother was like a great mountain,
good and firm and directing, and as always able to uphold around
her, her man, her children, and everybody who needed directing, and
he was feeling it once more good inside him to be important as if
it were in religion, and all the talking and moving and everybody
so excited about him. It was very pleasant just then for him, and
then the wagon began moving, and some went a little way with them
and then they all left them and then it was only the family and the
driver of the wagon who were with him and all the pleasant feeling
left him.</p>

<p>They went on and on and then suddenly they missed him, the
father was not there any longer with them. The mother went back
patiently to find him. He was sitting at the first turning, looking
at the village below him, at all the things he was leaving, and he
simply could not endure it in him.</p>

<p>His wife called to him. He sighed and she came to him. "Don't
you want to be going David," she said to him. "If you don't really
want to be going you've just got to say David what you want to be
doing. I'll never be a woman to make you do anything you are not
really wanting. You just say David what it is you are really
wanting. I'll do it if you want me really badly to do it. You know
I never want you not to do everything just like you really need it.
The children, they are all waiting there just for you to say it.
David I say you just say it what you want and I do it." He sighed
and he looked a little sullen.</p>

<p>"Of course Martha you know I do what I got to do for you and the
children. You know I always do what is right for me to do for you
and the children. I don't ever think what I am needing, I only just
want to do the best I can for you and the children. Can't you see
Martha I just came back here to see it. That ain't got nothing to
do with what I made up my mind was the right way to do it. I just
came here to see I don't forget it. Yes I come now Martha. Sure I
always will do it what is right for me to do so you and the
children can have it. I never do any other way in it. I go on with
you now I got another look to see I don't forget it. I just stopped
here to see it. Its just I wanted to see what way it looked so I
would get it right not to forget it. Alright Martha I come, you go
on, I be with you in a minute. I just look to see I got it fixed
right so I don't forget it. Alright Martha I come now. I got it
fixed now I can't forget it. Alright we go on now I done what I
needed. I came back just to do it. Now we go on to the children and
we go on to do it like we said we would do it." And he sighed and
he got up and he looked back as he went away from it and she talked
about how much the children were going to like it and he began to
forget it.</p>

<p>All, the wagon and the driver and the horses and the children,
had waited for them to come up to it. Now they went on again,
slowly and creaking, as is the way always when a whole family do
it. Moving through a country is never done very quickly when a
whole family do it.</p>

<p>They had not gone very far yet. They had not been going many
hours. They were all having now just coming in them their first
tired, the first hot sense of being very tired. This is the hardest
time in a day's walking to press through and get over being tired
until it comes to the last tired, that last dead tired sense that
is so tired. Then you cannot press through to a new strength and to
get another tired, you just keep on, that is you keep on when you
have learned how you can do it, then you just get hardened to it
and know there is no pressing through it, there is no way to win
out beyond it, it is just a dreary dull dead tired, and you must
learn to know it, and it is always and you must learn to bear it,
the dull drag of being almost dead with being tired.</p>

<p>In between these first and last are many little times of tired,
many ways of being very tired, but never any like the first hot
tired when you begin to learn how to press through it and never any
like the last dead tired with no beyond ever to it.</p>

<p>It was this first hot tired they all had in them now just in its
beginning, and they were all in their various ways trying to press
themselves to go through it, and they were mostly very good about
it and not impatient or complaining. They were all now beginning
with the dull tired sense of hot trudging when every step has its
conscious meaning and all the movement is as if one were lifting
each muscle and every part of the skin as a separate action. All
the springiness had left them, it was a weary conscious moving the
way it always is before one presses through it to the time of
steady walking that comes when one does not any longer do it with a
conscious sense with each movement. It is not until one has settled
to it, the steady walk where one is not conscious of the movement,
that you have become really strong to do it, and the whole family
were now just coming to it, they were just pressing through their
first hot tired.</p>

<p>And now once more the father had done it. The father was no
longer with them, once more he had slipped back and they had lost
him.</p>

<p>The mother said to the children. "Well you go on, I go back to
get him." She felt no anger in her toward him. She just went
patiently back to find him.</p>

<p>She told the children to keep on slowly as they were going and
she would go back and find him. She walked back looking patiently
everywhere for him. She found him before she had gotten back to
where she had the last time found him. He had not gotten back yet
to where be could see all he was going to leave behind him. She had
walked faster than he and had caught him.</p>

<p>She had no impatient feeling in her against him. It was a way he
had, she knew it, it was right for him to have it, the kind of a
feeling he had about leaving. It was a way he had, she was not
impatient with him, he was right to have that kind of a feeling in
him. It was right for him to act that way to see about not
forgetting. It was only that she knew he would like it and it would
be so good for the children that made her want to urge him not to
give up now they had made their beginning.</p>

<p>But she was not in any way impatient to him, she had no
impatient feeling in her against him. It was just his way and now
she would coax him and he would come back with her to the wagon. It
was only a way he always had had whenever he had to do a new thing.
And so she walked a little with him and began to talk about the
children and how nice it would be when they would all get rich and
how the children would like it to work and help him, and they sat
down and after they had been resting, when they got up again she
did not do any discussing, she just started him back toward the
wagon, and always she was telling about how good he was to do what
was best for her and the children. Soon they came up with the wagon
which was still very slowly moving.</p>

<p>It was so hot doing so much walking, she said then to him, he
looked a little sick, she thought he ought not to do any more
walking, perhaps it would be better if he would get into the wagon
and ride a little with the little children. It would be awful if he
got sick and nobody to take care of them for he was the only one
that could do their talking. And so she coaxed him into the wagon
with the children.</p>

<p>They went on and soon it was too far, there was not now any more
going back for him. And then he was content, and he had the new
city and the ship, and then he was content with the new world
around him.</p>

<p>They had, for a little while, a hard time beginning, but on the
whole things went very well with them. The sons made money for
them, the daughters worked and then got married to men whom they
found making money around them. Some did very well then and some
not so well, and they all had their troubles as all people have
them, and some died, and some lived and were prosperous and had
children. One as I was saying died a glutton and spoiling him was
the one weak thing the strong mother did to harm any of them.</p>

<p>The old man never made much of a fortune but with the help his
children gave him he lived very well and when he died he left his
wife a nice little fortune. She lived long and was strong to the
last and firmly supporting and her back was straight and firm and
always she was like a great mountain, and always she was directing
and leading all whom she found needing directing.</p>

<p>She was then very old, and always well, and always working, and
then she had a stroke, and then another, and then she died and that
was the end of that generation.</p>

<p>There had been born to Martha and David Hersland many sons and
daughters. All who lived to be grown up had gotten married and
almost all of these were prosperous. One, the glutton, died and
left his wife and children to his brothers, he had not made enough
money to leave them provided, and his brothers each one in their
turn gave the money to support them.</p>

<p>Of the daughters two of them were well married. The third one
always lived with her husband but it was her brothers who kept her
dressed and gave her children education and then later in their
life started them out in their working.</p>

<p>On the whole it was a substantial progress the family had made
in wealth, in opportunity, in education, in following out the
mother's leading to come to the new world to find for themselves
each one a sufficient fortune.</p>

<p>In all of them the father and the mother were variously mixed to
make them, but mostly it was the mother who was strongest in them.
Some, like the glutton, had in certain ways the important feeling
in them that the father had had in religion. Some, like the
daughter who had not made much of a success in marrying, had his
way of not being very good at keeping on even after they had made
the beginning, but mostly all of them had the strength and solid
power in them that the mother had it in her to give to all of them.
Most of them began and kept on well after they had made a
beginning. And so they were mostly very successful in the business
of living.</p>

<p>In every one of them the father and mother were very variously
mixed up in them. The fourth son, David Hersland, one of the
fathers we must soon be realising so that we can understand our own
being, was the only one of all of them who had gone to the far west
to make his fortune. It is a little hard to see just how the
mixture of this father and this mother came to make him. He was in
some ways, as I was saying, a very splendid kind of person. He was
big and abundant and full of new ways of thinking, and this was all
his mother in him, but he had not her patient steadfast working. He
was irritable and impatient and uncertain and not always very
strong at keeping going, though always he was abundant and forceful
and joyous and determined and always powerful in starting. And then
too he was in his way important inside to him as his father had
been when he felt his religion in him. But all this will show more
and more in him as I tell you slowly the history of him.</p>

<p>He had gone as a young man to Gossols to make his fortune. This
was the new world in a new world and it took this newest part of
this new world to content him. He alone of all the brothers had
this restless feeling in him. All the others did very well where
the mother had brought them. He alone had needed to go farther to
find for himself his life and a sufficient fortune.</p>

<p>As I was saying he had brought his wife to Gossols with him. He
had married her in Bridgepoint where one of his sisters had settled
with her man who made there a very good living. At this time David
though he was quite a young man had already made enough money to
support him and a wife and children. This he had done before he had
thought to go to Gossols where he was to make his great fortune.
And so it was right for his sister at this time to be anxious to
arrange a marriage for him. Now the idea of going to the far west
was just beginning to work in him. Perhaps marrying might keep him
with them, anyway it would be good for him to have a good wife to
go to Gossols with him, and so he met little Fanny Hissen. It was
arranged by his sister that this young woman should be married to
him.</p>

<p>Fanny Hersland all her life was a sweet gentle little woman. Not
that she did not have a fierce little temper sometimes in her and
one that could be very stubborn, but mostly she was a sweet little
gentle mother woman and only would be hurt, not angry, when any bad
thing happened to them.</p>

<p>Her mother was one of those four good foreign women the
grandmothers, always old women or as little children to us the
generation of grandchildren. These four good foreign women, the
grandmothers we need only to be just remembering, had each one a
different kind of a foreign man to be a master to them. These four
foreign women, the one strong to bear many children and then always
after strong to lead them, the steady good one who was patient to
bear her many children and then always was patient to suffer with
them, the sweet pure one who died as soon as she had born all of
them for that was all she knew then to do for them, and the little
gentle weeping hopeless one who sorrowed in her having them and
always after sorrowed in them, all these four foreign women had
very many and very different kinds of children.</p>

<p>The gentle little hopeless one who wept out all the sorrow for
her children had many and very little children. She was the mother
of the pretty gentle little woman that David Hersland married in
Bridgepoint and took out to Gossols with him.</p>

<p>The little weary weeping mother of all these gentle cheery
little children had a foreign husband who was not very pleasant to
his children. He too was little like his wife and like all his
children but there was a great deal in him to cause terror to his
wife and children. He was like old David Hersland important in
religion. It was very deep inside him and with him it was much
harder on his children. His wife too had sorrow in religion, she
had sorrow from his being so important in religion and she had
sorrow too from her own self in her own religion. But then it was
all sorrow and sadness, and always a trickling kind of weeping that
she had every moment in her living, and it really was not much
worse in religion. It was just a way she had, this trickling
weeping, even as when it sometimes did happen she was laughing. She
never ever really stopped her sad trickling, to her joy was as it
has been said of laughing, it is madness, and of mirth who doeth
it, for even in laughter the heart is sorrowful and the end of that
mirth is heaviness. It was in her as it was said by the quaker
woman. I often think if I could be so fixed as never to laugh or to
smile I should be one step better, it fills me with sorrow when I
see people so full of laugh.</p>

<p>It was a hard father and a dreary mother that gave the world so
many and such pleasant little children. Mostly they were cheerful
little children. Perhaps it was that the mother had wept out all
the sorrow for them. There was no weeping that she had left over to
them. They were mostly all in their later living cheerful hopeful
gentle little men and women. They lived without ambition or
excitement but they were each in their little circle joyful in the
present. They lived and died in mildness and contentment.</p>

<p>It was one of these cheerful gentle little Hissen people that
David Hersland married there in Bridgepoint and then took to
Gossols with him. And now he with all the mixed up father and
strong mother in him and this little gentle cheerful pretty little
woman who yet had a fierce little temper that could be very
stubborn were to come together and make a life together and to mix
up well and then to have many different kinds of children through
her.</p>

<p>They had mixed up very well. They had made a good enough success
with their living.</p>

<p>They had had five children through her. Two of these had died as
little children. Three of them had grown up and were now grown
young men and women, and these three are of them who are to be
always in this history of us young grown men and women to us, for
it is only thus that we can ever feel them to be real inside in us,
them who are of the same generation with us.</p>

<p>The mother, little gentle Mrs. Hersland, was very loving in her
feeling to all of her children, but they had been always all three,
after they had stopped being very little children, too big for her
ever to control them. She could not lead them nor could she know
what they needed inside them. She could not help them, she could
only be hurt not angry when any bad thing happened to them.</p>

<p>She loved them and was very proud of all three of them. Often
she wondered as she looked at them, how could they be so perfect
and so wonderful and yet all three of them be so different from the
others of them that there was hardly anything alike in the three of
them.</p>

<p>They were big children and each one of them in his own way was
strong to do what they needed to find themselves free inside them.
They were big children and she was only a very little mother to
them. And they were not very loving children, they were too strong
at finding their own way to feel free and important each one to
himself inside him. They were to her very good children. She never
had any trouble with them. And now she was a little ailing and they
were good but then she never had been very important to them.</p>

<p>Now we begin to learn more about the Hersland family and their
way of living.</p>

<p>As I was saying the father David Hersland was in some ways a
very splendid kind of person but he had some very uncertain things
inside him. He too was very proud of his children but it was not
easy for them to be free of him. Sometimes he was very angry with
them. Sometimes it came to his doing very hard pounding on the
table at which they would be sitting and disputing, and ending with
the angry word that he was the father, they were his children, they
must obey him, he was master and he knew how to make them do as he
would have them. Such scenes were very hard on the little gentle
mother woman who was all lost in between the angry father and the
three big resentful children who knew very well what they needed to
have given to them so that they could be free inside them.</p>

<p>This is the way the three Hersland children grew up to be strong
each one to be free inside him. They were all big in themselves and
in their way of winning. Soon you will learn slowly the history of
each one of them, how each one was important to himself in him, and
how they won a kind of freedom for themselves each one inside
them.</p>

<p>The little mother was not very important to them. They were good
enough children in their daily living but they were never very
loving to her inside them. They had it too strongly in them to win
their own freedom.</p>

<p>They turned to their father, altogether, in their thinking. It
was against him inside, and strongly always around them, that they
had to do the fighting for their freedom. Now the mother was a
little ailing. She was all lost between the father and the three
big struggling children.</p>

<p>In their young days the father was proud of his children, proud
that they were important each one to himself inside him, proud that
they needed to win for themselves their own freedom. Always then he
encouraged their disputing, he wanted then that they should fight
and win out against him. As I was saying David Hersland the father
of these big resentful children was in some ways a splendid kind of
person. But now things were going less easily around him. Joy was a
little dim inside now for all of them. Now he would often be angry
and be given to pounding on the table and loudly declaring, he was
the father, they were the children, they must obey else he would
know how to make them. And the gentle little mother who every day
was giving signs of weakening would sit scared, and afterwards she
would be weeping, lost between the father and the three big
resentful children.</p>

<p>But this was all when they had become grown young men and women
and joy was a little dim inside for all of them.</p>

<p>Now listen to their lives as children, their early struggles
each one to find for themselves freedom, the abundant father in
them in those days full of joyous beginning, proud of himself and
of his children, glad to feel that they were strong all of them to
make for themselves their own beginning.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you more of the Hersland ways of living in the
old home with the wind and the sun and the rain beating, and the
dogs and chickens and the open life, and the hay, and the men
working, and the father's way of educating the three children so
that they could be strong to make for themselves their own
beginning, and the gentle little mother who was not very important
to them, who had sometimes a fierce little temper that could be
very stubborn but mostly she was only sad, not angry, when any bad
thing happened to them, and the three children with the mixed up
father and the little unimportant mother in them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mr. Hersland was big and abundant and always was
very full of new ways of thinking. Always he was abundant and
joyous and determined and always powerful in starting. Also
sometimes he would be irritable and impatient and uncertain. Also
he was in his way important inside to him, and all these things
came out in his educating of his children.</p>

<p>Truly he loved education. It was to him almost all there is of
living. He did not do it with steadfast steady working, things
always were a little uncertain with him. One never knew which way
it would break out from him the things he was very good at starting
and then other things would happen to him and to all the people
around who were dependent on him.</p>

<p>It was a very good kind of living the Hersland children had in
their beginning, and their freedom in the ten acres where all kinds
of things were growing, where they could have all anybody could
want of joyous sweating, of rain and wind, of hunting, of cows and
dogs and horses, of chopping wood, of making hay, of dreaming, of
lying in a hollow all warm with the sun shining while the wind was
howling, of knowing all queer poor kinds of people that lived in
this part of Gossols where the Herslands were living and where no
other rich people were living. And so they grew up with this kind
of living, such kind of queer poor, for them, people around them,
such uncertain ways of getting education that they had from the
father's passion for all kinds of educating, from his strong love
of starting and the uncertain things he had inside him.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a good way of living for them who had a
passion to be free inside them and this was true of all three of
the Hersland children but mostly with Martha the eldest and the
only daughter living, and the youngest David who was always
searching to decide in him and no one could ever understand him,
from day to day what life meant to him to make it worth his living.
It was less in Alfred, this love of freedom, in Alfred who was soon
now to be marrying Julia Dehning. He had some of it in him but not
so strongly inside him as Martha and David and his father had it in
them. Yes I say it again now to all of you, all you who have it a
little in them to be free inside them. I say it again to you, we
must leave them, we cannot stay where there are none to know it,
none who can tell us from the lowest from them who are simply poor
or bad because they have no other way to do it. No here there are
none who can know it, we must leave ourselves to a poor thing like
Alfred Hersland to show it, one who is a little different with it,
not with real singularity to be free in it, but it is better with
him than to have no one to do it, and so we leave it, and we leave
the Alfred Herslands to do it, poor things to represent it,
singularity to be free inside with it, poor things and hardly our
own in it, but all we can leave behind to show a little how some
can begin to do it.</p>

<p>Yes real singularity we have not made enough of yet so that any
other one can really know it. I say vital singularity is as yet an
unknown product with us, we who in our habits, dress-suit cases,
clothes and hats and ways of thinking, walking, making money,
talking, having simple lines in decorating, in ways of reforming,
all with a metallic clicking like the type-writing which is our
only way of thinking, our way of educating, our way of learning,
all always the same way of doing, all the way down as far as there
is any way down inside to us. We all are the same all through us,
we never have it to be free inside us. No brother singulars, it is
sad here for us, there is no place in an adolescent world for
anything eccentric like us, machine making does not turn out queer
things like us, they can never make a world to let us be free each
one inside us.</p>

<p>And yet a little I have made it too strong against us in saying
Alfred Hersland was the only one who could in this adolescent world
represent us. The father David Hersland we cannot count for us, it
was an old world that gave him the stamp to be different from the
adolescent world around us. But there is still some hope for us in
the younger David who is different from the people all around us,
in him who always was seeking to be free inside him, to know it in
him, and no one could ever understand him, what it was inside him
that made it right that he should go on with his living. He as you
shall hear in the history of him, does not really belong to the
adolescent metallic world around him, and yet there was not that
vital steadfast singularity inside him that custom passion and a
feel for mother earth can breed in men. He did not have it really
for him, custom, passion, certainty of place and means of living,
stability within himself and around him, a feeling to be really
free inside him and strong to be singular in his clothes and in his
ways of living.</p>

<p>But now to make again a beginning, to tell of the father David
Hersland and the ways he had in him to make himself strong and
important inside to him and to prove the right way to educate his
children and the singularities the old world had stamped on
him.</p>

<p>David Hersland believed in hardening his children. He believed
that everyone should make for himself his own beginning, that every
one should win for himself his own freedom. This was always strong
inside him with all the uncertain ways that he had in him, with all
the strong starts and sudden changes in his way of educating the
three children who had such different ways in them from the things
he meant to give them.</p>

<p>Mostly at first they the children felt this in him in the ways
they were ashamed of him in just the simple ways he had of doing in
the ordinary every day living.</p>

<p>It is hard on children when the father has queer ways in him.
Even when they love him they can never keep themselves from having
shame inside them when all the people are looking and wondering and
laughing and giving him a name for the queer ways of him.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersland as I have been often saying was in some ways a
splendid kind of person, and that was one way one could look at
him. In other ways he was an uncertain changeful angry irritable
kind of a person with a strong feeling of being important to
himself inside him and not always certain to make other men see why
he had so much important feeling in him. And then one could think
of him, as children when they were young girls and boys felt him,
queer in the ways he had of doing things that made them feel a
little ashamed to say he was a father to them when other children
spoke about him.</p>

<p>These are some of the queer ways he had in him, the ways that
made his children feel uncomfortable beside him. They were mostly
just simple things in their ordinary living that gave his children
this uncomfortable feeling for him.</p>

<p>David Hersland was a big man. He was big in the size of him and
in his way of thinking. His eyes were brown and little and sharp
and piercing and sometimes dancing with laughing and often angry
with irritation. His hands would be quiet a long time and then
impatient in their moving. His hair was grey now, his eyebrows long
and rough and they could give his eyes a very angry way of looking,
and yet one could love him, in a way one was not afraid of him. He
never would go so far as his irritation seemed to drive him, and
somehow one always knew that of him. He had not so much terror for
his children as fathers with more kindness and more steadfast ways
of doing. One always had a kind of feeling that what one needed to
protect one from him was to stand up strongly against him. He would
stop short of where he seemed to be going, anger was there but it
would not force him on to the final end of angry acting. All one
had to do was to say then to him "Alright but I've got a good right
to my opinion. You started us in this way of doing, you have no
right to change now and say that its no way for us to be acting."
And so each one of the three children, Martha, Alfred and David
would each in their own way resist him, and it made a household
where there was much fierce talking and much frowning, and then the
father would end with pounding on the table and threatening and
saying that he was the father they were the children, he was the
master, they must obey else he would know the way to make them. And
the little unimportant mother would be all lost then in between the
angry father and the three big resentful children. But all this was
when they were beginning to be grown young men and women. When they
were still children there was not any fierceness in the house among
them.</p>

<p>And now to come back to the queer ways of him. As I was saying
the father was a big man. He liked eating, he liked strange ways of
educating his children and he was always changing, and sometimes he
was very generous to them and then he would change toward them and
it would be hard for them to get even little things that they
needed in the position that was given to them by their father's
fortune and large way of living.</p>

<p>In the street in his walking, and it was then his children were
a little ashamed of him, he always had his hat back on his head so
that it always looked as if it were falling, and he would march on,
he was a big man and loved walking, with two or three of his
children following behind him or with one beside him, and he always
forgetting all about them, and everybody would stop short to look
at him, accustomed as they were to see him, for he had a way of
tossing his head to get freedom and a way of muttering to himself
in his thinking and he had always a movement of throwing his body
and his shoulders from side to side as he was arguing to himself
about things he wanted to be changing, and always he had the
important feeling to himself inside him.</p>

<p>And then as I was saying he was a big man and he was very fond
of eating, he had had a brother who had died a glutton, and he
liked to buy things that looked good to him, and it would always be
a very big one, he never liked to undertake anything that was not
large in its beginning. The only time in his life that he ever took
a little thing was when he chose his wife the little gentle Fanny
Hissen who as I have often been saying could only be sad not angry
when any bad thing happened to them, but yet she had a fierce
little temper in her that could be very stubborn when it was well
roused inside her and she sometimes had such a sharp angry feeling
at some of the ways her husband had of doing, mostly when it
concerned his not giving things she thought they needed to the
children. But mostly they lived very well together the father and
mother and three children, that is when they were young children,
later it was harder for them when the father would get his very
angry feeling and the mother was a little ailing and the fierce
little temper broke into weakness and helplessness inside her and
the three big struggling young grown men and women were seeking
each one his own freedom and his own beginning. But now as children
it was just the little uncomfortable feeling of being ashamed of
the queer ways he had of doing that his children had to endure with
him, then he was joyous and it was mostly pleasant enough living
with him, and the mother was gentle and pleasant then with them and
strong enough to support her little temper that could be very
stubborn whenever it arose against him.</p>

<p>But even when he was not doing really queer things there was
always a marked character about him. It came from inside him, from
the strong ways he had of beginning, from the important feeling he
had always inside him from his continual thinking and in a
different way from that in which all the other people around about
him were thinking, and this thinking somehow marked him even when
he was just simply walking and then stopping to talk with somebody
or just stopping to ask a question of some stranger or to talk
about the weather or other just ordinary enough talking, the kind
of thing anybody could be saying, and yet the power of being free
inside him made him a marked man even then, and nobody could take
him to be an ordinary person or ever forget him.</p>

<p>As he would be walking along with a child beside him or several
of them behind him, he would stop and sweep the prospect with his
cane and begin talking and somebody near him would come to listen.
It was just ordinary talking that he would be doing, about the
weather or the country or the fruit and it did not seem to have any
deep meaning but it was the power and completeness of the
identification of this big man with all creation that forced people
to think of him. This man was big as all the world in his
beginning, it was nothing in him even if he did not always keep
going, he had been as big as all the world once in his feeling and
that he never could lose with him.</p>

<p>And so he would stand talking and the unhappy uncomfortable
child beside him would keep saying, when he was not afraid to break
in on him, "Come on papa all those people are looking."</p>

<p>"What!" the father was not listening to him but would keep right
on with his talking. The child as much as he dared would twitch or
pull at him, "What!" but the father never really heard him and he
would go on with the queer ways in him. Slowly his children learned
endurance of him. Later in their life they were queer too like
him.</p>

<p>Often when he was walking with his children and passed a shop
and saw some fruit or cakes or something that pleased him he took
it and gave it to his children and they would be most uncomfortable
then and say something about not wanting it to him. "What!" and he
never listened to them. The children suffered so because they were
not sure that the man inside knew that their father would pay him.
The father of course always paid for them but there was something
in the manner of him that gave one a kind of feeling that he was as
big as all the world about him, one included the other in them, the
world and him, the earth the sky the people around him the fruit
the shops, it was all one and the same, all of it and him, and this
kind of a feeling he always gave to them who saw him walking
standing thinking talking, that the world was all him, there was no
difference in it in him, and the fruit inside or outside him there
were no separations of him or from him, and the whole world he
lived in always lived inside him.</p>

<p>It was all so simply to him as the world as all him, and it was
this that gave him a big freedom and this big important feeling and
the big way of beginning and so made a queer man of him, an
eccentric from the others around him, and all that stopped it from
making a god of him was his way of being impatient inside him and
not being very good at keeping going but always making for himself
a new beginning.</p>

<p>This large way of him when it made him take up fruit from shops
to eat and to give to his children made a very uncomfortable shamed
child beside him, and it would be protesting to him, and its father
would say, "What," but he never listened to him. The child never
did learn that the fruit man would not be worried with him, that
they all knew his father and the queer ways of him, and that the
father always paid them. The fruit men all knew him and liked the
abundant world embracing feeling of him and they liked to see him,
but his children never could lose, until they grew up to be queer
themselves each one inside him, the uncomfortable feeling that his
queer ways gave them.</p>

<p>To him, David Hersland, education was almost the whole of
living. In it was always the making of a new beginning, the having
ideas, and often changing. And then there were so many ways of
considering the question.</p>

<p>There were so many different ways of seeing the meaning of the
various parts that made education. There was the health, the mind,
the notion of right living, the learning cooking and all useful
things that he knew they should know now to be doing, and then
there was his system of hardening so that they would be ready to
make each one their own beginning; and all these needs for them and
the many ways to look at them led to many queer things that his
children had to endure from him.</p>

<p>Their education was a mixing of hardening, of forcing themselves
into a kind of living as if they were poor people and had no one to
do things for them, with a way of being very rich, that is having
everything the father ever could imagine would do any good to any
one of them.</p>

<p>This made a queer mixture in them. They found it a great trouble
to them, this past education, when they first began to be young
grown men and women. Later in their living they liked it that they
had had such a mixing of being rich and poor, together, in
them.</p>

<p>As children they all three had loved very well this kind of
living. As I was saying they had their ten acres, with a rose hedge
to fence their joys in, in that part of Gossols where no other rich
people were living. They had all around them, for them, poor people
to know in their daily living, and from them they learned their
ways which were queer ways for them who had from their father's
fortune a very different kind of position to be natural to
them.</p>

<p>In Gossols the Herslands could be freer inside them than if the
father had remained with his brothers where the mother had brought
them and this freedom he used in the education of his children.
They never knew any one of them nor the father who was directing it
for them just where their learning was coming from or how it would
touch them. Mr. Hersland had all kinds of ways of seeing education.
He was fondest of all of the idea of hardening but this was
difficult for him to keep steadfast in him with his great interest
in every kind of new invention, in wanting that his children should
always have anything that could do any good to any one of them.</p>

<p>There was joy in them all in their later living that it had been
Gossols where they had had their youthful feeling and later when
they learned to know other young grown men and women they loved the
freedom that they had inside them, that their father had in his
queer way won for them. As I was saying they had ten acres where
they had every kind of fruit tree that could be got there to do any
growing, and they had cows and dogs and horses and hay making, and
the sun in the summer dry and baking, and the wind in the autumn
and in the winter the rain beating and then in the spring time the
hedge of roses to fence all these joys in.</p>

<p>The mother had always been accustomed to a well to do middle
class living, to keeping a good table for her husband and the
children, to dressing herself and her children in simple expensive
clothing, to have the children get as presents whatever any one of
them wanted to have at that time to amuse them. She was a sweet
contented little woman who lived in her husband and her children,
who could only know well to do middle class living, who never knew
what it was her husband and her children were working out inside
them and around them. She had strongly inside her the sense of
being mistress of the household, the wife of a wealthy and good man
and the mother of nice children. When they were little children
they liked to cuddle to her when she took them out to visit the
rich people who lived in the other part of Gossols. They were all
bashful children, living as they did in the part of the town where
no rich people were living and so being used to poor queer kind of
people and only feeling really at home with them who were not
people in the position that their father's fortune and large way of
living would naturally make companions for them. And so as little
children when they went to visit with their mother in the part of
Gossols where other rich people were living, they clung to her or
on the sofa where she would be sitting and talking, they climbed
behind her, and then too she wore seal-skins and pleasant stuffs
for children to rub against and feel as rich things to touch and
have near them and so they liked to go with her, and this and the
habit of being children with a mother was mostly all of the feeling
that they had for her until later when she was ailing and the
little stubborn temper in her broke into weakness and helplessness
inside her and they had in a way to be good to her.</p>

<p>They always in a way were good to her that is as much as they
could remember to think about her, but it was not important inside
to any of them to remember about her neither when as children they
were near her or when later she was ailing and needed them to be
good to her.</p>

<p>She was a little unimportant mother always to them and it was
only as a part of the physical home around them that she belonged
to them, either when as little children she was mistress of her
house and attended to them or later when as weakening she needed to
be taken care of by them. This sweet gentle little mother woman who
had sometimes a fierce little temper in her that could be very
stubborn when it arose strongly inside her, never knew really in
her that she was not important to the children who had come into
the world through her. She had a kind of important feeling always
inside her. She had a little temper that could make her big husband
pay attention to her and she had a power in her in respect to
servants and governesses and seamstresses who worked for her. She
did not feel it to be important to her what other people felt for
her. The life in her family was all of living for her and her
children she never thought about in the way of making them feel
her. She had a little pride inside her to make her husband feel
her, she had a bigger pride inside her to make her dependents feel
her, she had no pride in her to make her children feel her, they
were so made of her by having come out into the world through her
that they really were apart from her. She did not feel them near
her even as little children when they were dependent on her. Later
they were so big around her, and she was lost away from them and
they never thought about her. But she never felt inside her any
anger that they had no deep loving feeling in them for her, all the
feeling of pride in her and all the feeling of being important to
herself inside her was to make her husband feel her and when she
had her little fierce stubborn temper rise inside her, to make him
yield to her, or later when the temper broke down into weakness and
helplessness inside her to have him then be good to her. All the
rest of her feeling herself important to herself inside her had to
do with her dependents and the struggles she had with them and they
had among themselves and so to feel her.</p>

<p>No she never felt it ever to be very important to her the
relation of other rich people of her kind toward her. She had left
Bridgepoint and friends and family feeling all behind her. Here in
Gossols it was only the house and the ten acre place and those
inside it that concerned her.</p>

<p>She knew the value of herself, and their well to do way of
living, of her husband, and her nice children, and the simple
expensive clothing they wore when they went out visiting to that
part of Gossols where the other rich people were living. She could
know the value of them and the way other people must feel toward
them but these things gave her no strong feeling of being important
to them, the other people, who did not come close to her in her
daily living. With them it was only a continuing of her well to do
living which was the only kind of living it was right to her for
anybody to be having. That was there. To have it gave her no
important feeling. It was right to have a well to do good husband
and nice children and all in simple and expensive clothing, but in
the ten acre place in that part of Gossols where no other rich
people were living she was cut off from a lively feeling of this
right kind of living. Here it was she herself who was important to
her feeling, here she was not only a right part of a right way of
living, as it had been for her in Bridgepoint in her family in the
way the Hissens had always done their living, but she had an
individual feeling, not with her children they were completely of
her and apart from her as was the right well to do middle class
living, it was always there so were her children but they were not
important to her feeling. The things that made her important to
herself in her feeling was the sometimes controlling her husband by
her little temper when it arose to be fierce inside her and the
stubborn way it sometimes gave her in acting, and in being mistress
and deciding and being above them and yet in their daily living and
so interfering with the seamstresses and governesses and servants
and all the people they ever had working for them. Being cut off
from the simple rich ordinary way of living never gave her any
feeling. It was not being cut off with any sense of losing, it was
always there existing, in her and for her, this kind of living and
it was not important to her feeling. It was as if one could ever be
thinking about the different kinds of air in different parts of the
world where one happened to be living, the atmosphere of well to do
living was to her as the air she was breathing, it was always there
she could not feel it important in her feeling or her thinking,
breathing was there, one did not know it as important to one's
feeling until one was in some way sick and it stopped or made hard
one's breathing, but so long as one was strong and living one went
on like everybody else with one's breathing. And so it was with
Mrs. Hersland and well to do living, she could not feel it to be
important in her feeling whether it was in the rich part of Gossols
that they were living, or in Bridgepoint, or in the part of Gossols
where no other rich people were living. Always she was of well to
do being, with a good rich husband and nice children and when she
wanted to have it simple and expensive clothing. The sense of
belonging to this kind of living could never give her any kind of
important feeling. Her husband David Hersland with the queer nature
of him might have an important feeling coming to him from just
breathing, that feeling could come to him from the singular nature
of him, from his being as big as all the world in his beginning,
but to an ordinary gentle little mother woman there could never
come such a feeling, this well to do living could only come to be
important to her in her feeling if she could ever come to it
through a losing, by their money going or by their losing position
by some wrong doing, and such a kind of losing it could never come
to Mrs. Hersland to ever think of as coming to them. And so
visiting and being, well to do living and her children, these never
gave her a strong feeling of being important inside her through
them, it was only through her husband and the governess and
seamstresses and servants and dependents that she could ever have
an individual kind of feeling. It was queer that her children were
to her like well to do living, not important to her feeling. As I
was saying David Hersland had made a decent fortune even before he
had left Bridgepoint. He had made enough money to give his wife and
children a good position. And so when they first came to Gossols
where he was to make for himself a great fortune they could afford
to live in as good a hotel as was then there existing.</p>

<p>Things began very well in their far western living. Martha and
Alfred were then very young children. David the youngest had not
yet been born to them. Here Mrs. Hersland had been at first a
little lonesome.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland had left friends and family feeling behind her.
Here in Gossols it would have been natural for her to find other
people to continue with her the well to do living which was the
only right way of being to her.</p>

<p>They lived for a year in that part of Gossols where all the rich
people were living. Here she had her first important feeling. Here
she met a Miss Sophie Shilling and her sister Pauline Shilling and
their mother old Mrs. Shilling.</p>

<p>Always Mrs. David Hersland had been a right part of a right kind
of living. Not that she had not often had strong feeling, not that
she did not have dignity in herself and in her family in her
feeling, sometimes she had an angry stubborn feeling, sometimes
with her sisters or her mother and later when they came together
sometimes with Mr. David Hersland who was to be married to her.
Sometimes it was a hurt feeling that made her sad not angry when
any bad thing happened to her, sometimes it was a hurt feeling that
made her a little bitter. All this had been important feeling to
her, sometimes it had made a power of her but it did not give to
her an important feeling to herself inside her. It was not apart in
her from the feeling of herself to her as of the right well to do
living that had made her and which was the only right way of being
for her.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Shilling and her daughter Sophie Shilling and her other
daughter Pauline Shilling, first gave to her the feeling of being
important to herself inside her, important, apart in her, from
right being, right acting, and the dignity of decent family living
with good eating being the mother of nice children the wife of a
good well to do man, and all in simple and expensive clothing. This
family of old Mrs. Shilling and the two daughters with her gave to
Mrs. Hersland and the gentle dignity she always had inside her as
part of the family she belonged to, gave to her a sense of a new
power that was apart in her from the dignity of right being that
she had always had around her. It was apart in her this sense of a
new kind of power that she had with Mrs. Shilling and the fat
daughter Sophie Shilling and the thin pretty dull queer always
getting into trouble Pauline Shilling, it was apart in her from the
dignity of right living that she had always had inside her. It was
the fat daughter Sophie Shilling who was the new kind of friend to
her, that gave her the sense of being important to herself inside
her. Sophie Shilling made a new kind of friendship for her and it
was a new sense that Mrs. Hersland had then inside her, different
from all that she had always had in her, different from the right
living that had made her.</p>

<p>All the Hissen people had it strongly inside them, the family
way of good living. They were all in their natural way of family
thinking gentle cheerful little men and women. They lived in their
natural way of being, without any strong ambition. It was enough
for them to hold to their tradition, the dignity and beauty of
right living and right thinking, they never needed to go out to
find ambition or excitement in their living, they had excitement
and dignity inside them from their family and the gentle pride that
made them; that, sometimes, came in sparkling, sometimes in angry
flashes from them but mostly they were hurt not angry when any bad
thing happened to them. They lived in their natural way of being
without any strong ambition or excitement, they were each in their
little circle joyful in the present, they lived and died in
mildness and contentment.</p>

<p>They had never any one of them an important feeling of
themselves inside, them to arise of itself from within them. Such a
kind of important feeling would not be in them in the way of living
it was natural to any one of them to be having. Mrs. Fanny Hersland
never would have had such a feeling if she had lived on in
Bridgepoint, going on always with the right kind of being, she
would often have had an angry feeling, sometimes with her family,
or her husband, or for them when things happened to them to worry
them, and sometimes it would be a hurt feeling that would lead to
bitter biting talking, sometimes it would be a hurt feeling that
would make her sad not angry when any bad thing happened to them
and always it would be she who had the feeling and the dignity and
the good well to do husband and the simple and expensive clothing,
and the nice children and she was the mother of them, but with all
this strong feeling, with this being proud or angry or sad or
stubborn or happy in her feeling, she would never have that kind of
important feeling that she learned to be having in Gossols, first
with Sophie Shilling as a beginning and then in Gossols later in
the ten acre place where they were always staying cut off from
being really a part of the right way of living. She would have been
a part, if she had gone on with her natural living, she would have
been a part of the right way of Hissen being; she could have been
in her feeling angry or sad or stubborn or happy, or biting in her
talking, or hurt when any bad thing happened to them, she could
have all this in her feeling and yet not have that kind of sense of
importance to herself inside her that comes with the individual
being.</p>

<p>The little religious father who had made them all, all his
children, he could not make others not living with him feel him,
the little religious father who had made all of his children feel
him had such an important feeling inside him, it was his religion
gave it to him, it did not arise of itself from within him. It was
only being as he felt himself, all there was of religion, could
give him such a feeling of being important to himself inside him.
He could make all his children feel him, he could in a way make
them fearful of him and the religion in him, and all the religion
was of him and he was in himself all there was of religion, and so
it was that he had the important feeling inside in him, but this
did not make any but his children feel him, it did not arise of
itself inside him and he could not make any one who did not live
with him feel it in him.</p>

<p>The little dreary mother with her trickling kind of weeping that
she had every moment in her living, even, as when it sometimes
happened, she was laughing, this dreary little trickling woman had
with her sadness in religion and in her trickling weeping that kept
on always wetting all the sorrow there could be in living, this
trickling dreary little Mrs. Hissen, who wept out all the sorrow
for her children, had in her an important kind of being that was
almost an important feeling, and this almost an important feeling
did not come to her as in her husband from religion, it arose up
inside in her with her trickling weeping.</p>

<p>Almost it was really an important feeling and it was the having
too, such an almost important feeling that made her daughter Mrs.
Hersland have really such a feeling when it came to her there in
Gossols to have a, for her, not natural way of living, and it first
came as a beginning with the old lady Mrs. Shilling and her fat
daughter Sophie Shilling and the other daughter Pauline Shilling.
With all the other Hissen men and women there mostly was not such
an important feeling inside in them, only with the oldest of them
who had religion as the father had inside him, and with her it was
as with him, the important feeling did not arise of itself inside
her, and only her children could feel it in her, the way of being
important that being all there was of religion gave their mother as
a power over them in her.</p>

<p>Mostly the Hissen men and women the children of the father and
religion and the trickling dreary mother who hardly knew how she
came to make them, in all these Hissen little men and women there
was never very much of such important feeling. It was only way off
there in Gossols, shut off from a lively feeling of well to do
living, shut off from her friends and family feeling, that Fanny
Hissen, Mrs. Hersland, could find in herself a really important
feeling.</p>

<p>All the little Hissen people had very strong family feeling. All
together they were important to themselves in their feeling. Not
that they did not each one alone have strong feeling and each one
of course had in them a different way from all the others of them
of being loving or having an angry feeling. They all of course had
in them their own individual way of thinking and of doing only they
never had inside them each one for himself the real important
feeling.</p>

<p>Some of them had often a very angry feeling, some had fierce
tempers and sometimes bitter biting ways of talking, some had very
stubborn ways inside them, and some had it mostly in them to be
only hurt not angry when any bad thing happened to them. Yes they
had each one of them their own way of feeling thinking and of doing
but they had not any of them inside in them an important feeling of
themselves inside them as the father had in religion and as the
dreary mother almost had with her continuous way of trickling
crying.</p>

<p>Some of the children, as I was saying, had it a little in them.
The oldest daughter from her dull stubborn religion that was for
her all there really was of living had it in herself and it gave
her power over her young children. One, a little younger, Fanny,
Mrs. Hersland, had from a, to her, not a natural way of living, and
from having had it strongest of them all from the beginning, the
almost important feeling that the mother had with her constant
trickling, from being cut off from a lively feeling of right being,
she had almost before ending a really important feeling. And one
next to the youngest of them had a little such a feeling from
almost an individual way of thinking, it never really came to a
fruition but as with the mother in the constant trickling this one
with constant and very nearly an individual kind of thinking had
almost a real important feeling.</p>

<p>The Hissen family altogether were, and very really, important to
themselves inside them in their feeling. Each one of them had
always for himself and all the others of them a dignity and a
gentle way of making himself important to the others of them and to
every one who ever came to know them. They were all of them, each
one in the gentle dignity they all had in them, important to every
one who ever came near to them. With some of them, their eyes
flashed often with a sharp angry almost fierce feeling, that things
happening could arouse within them, often with some of them they
would be hurt and then their mouths were drooping. In some of them
it was a very stubborn feeling that was the deepest thing inside
them after the family way that made all them, and these were the
hardest to live with and never to be forgiven when they had been
hurt or angry by something some one had done to them. But mostly
the Hissen men and women were gentle cheerful little men and women,
mostly they lived without ambition or excitement and mostly they
were each in their little circle cheerful in the present. Mostly
they lived and died in mildness and contentment.</p>

<p>Until they were all really grown men and women, until the women
each one found a husband to control them and the men went into a
business and were independent of him, until they were in this sense
grown men and women, until he died the father always wanted and
succeeded in shutting them all up to be always with him. This was
not in him from any small feeling inside him but from the important
feeling he had in him of being all there was for him of religion
and it was his sense of the right way for them to be as children
that made him shut them up so and keep them there close to him.
Later when the daughters were married and the sons working were
independent of him and had left him, he never in any way wished to
interfere with them, with their feeling, their religion, their way
of thinking or their doing. When they were with him, they belonged
there and he held them shut in with him, when they left him, grown
up men and women, it was no longer for him to act upon them, they
no longer were his necessary way of living. It was never his
children that gave him an important feeling, his power over them
when they were shut up with him never gave him any kind of an
important feeling. No it was his being all there was of religion
that gave him his important feeling, not his wife nor his children
nor any power he had from them nor the power he never had had with
any one who did not live shut up with him. Nothing in such a way
could give him an important feeling. They were his daily living,
the necessary right way of doing, they were not important to his
feeling, not in themselves nor in any power in him that came from
them either as they were or as he made them. Such things could
never come to him as an important feeling of himself inside him. It
was only being all there was of religion that gave him such an
important feeling.</p>

<p>It was queer unless you really could understand him, could
really see how the important feeling came to be in him, it was
certainly queer to just ordinary thinking to see a man who had been
so rigid with his children, keeping them shut up with him, making
them live every minute as he would have them, having no power with
anyone who did not live so with him, it was queer that when these
children came to be grown men and women, that is independent and
living away from him, that he never in any way wanted to keep his
hold on them. He had for them then as much affection as he ever had
had for them, he always went to see them and was open and friendly
with them but not in any way had he ever any kind of desire in him
to interfere with them or their way of living or their thinking or
their doing, no not even with their feeling in religion. They were
his children, yes, but not now a part of his necessary living, even
when, as he did some years before dying, even when he was living
with one of them who with her husband had very different ways of
living, of thinking, and of feeling, in religion than he had it in
him, even then he never interfered with them who were now
independent of him, grown men and women. The only thing that gave
him an important feeling was being all there was of religion. When
his children were shut in with him they were a part of him, they
had to do with his necessary way of being, they had to live in his
important feeling, with his being all there was of religion, but
when they had left him, when later he even lived with them, they
were then no longer a part of him, he was then, all alone, all
there was of religion. By that time his wife too had left him, had
died away and left him. Always in her living she had never been
quite of him, she had been cut off from him, by her having from her
constant trickling crying an almost important feeling. And so this
old man who was to himself all there was of religion, to whom
religion and himself was all there was of living, who had kept his
children close shut up with him every minute of their living until
they were for him grown up men and women this old man who never had
had any power in him for any one who was not shut up with him, this
old man had a queer way of being almost perfect in his toleration
of things that were all different from his way of thinking and
feeling and believing, even with religion, even with his children,
now when they were independent of him.</p>

<p>So strong was it in him, this tolerating spirit toward them when
they were grown men and women to him, that even when later in their
living they sometimes asked him to guide them he would refuse it to
them, for they were then apart from him, he was all there was of
religion, religion was all there was of being for him; that made
him important to himself inside him. It was not for him to guide
them they who were apart from him, they were, then as all the world
always had been, he had no power over anything not shut up with
him, and so he had a tolerant spirit for everything that was not
him, for his children now when they were grown up and independent
even when as it happened later he was living with some of them.</p>

<p>One of them who had come to be grown up for him was the Fanny
Hissen who had married David Hersland the man who was as big as all
the world in his beginning and strong to prove this, his feeling,
on all who met him, not only on them who were shut up with him,
everybody always felt this in him, once he was as big as all the
world around him, he was it, it was in him, there was no difference
with it inside him or outside for him; in his beginning with Fanny
Hissen when she first began her living with him she wanted to do as
he would have her do in all things. It came to them, in religion,
that his ways were not the ways that had been right for her to have
when she was living with her family, when they had been all living,
shut in with the father who was all there was of religion. It came
one day to a very great division between her husband's way of
thinking and feeling in religion and her father's ways as she had
learned to have them inside her when she with all her sisters and
her brothers were living shut up with him.</p>

<p>She wrote to him and asked him, she said her husband wanted her
to go with him and it was not as she had been taught by him her
father, she did not feel it wrong to do this thing but she could
not do it without asking her father, who had never let his children
do any such thing when they were shut in with him. What should she
do, she would not make for herself such a decision, she would ask
him, was it wrong for her to do this thing, to go with her husband
to such a meeting.</p>

<p>The old man replied. "My dear child. There was once a priest, a
good man. Once a member of his church came to him and said I have
been thinking can I do this thing, can I go to a barber's shop and
get shaved on a Sunday morning, is it wrong for me to do this
thing. The priest said, yes he must forbid it to him, he must not
go to a barber's shop on a Sunday morning and get a man to shave
him, it was wrong for him to do this thing, it would be a sin in
him. Two Sundays after the man met his priest coming out of a shop
shaved all fresh and clean. But how is this, the man said to him,
you told me that it was forbidden, you told me, when I asked you,
that I should not do this thing, that it would be for me a sin. Ah!
said the priest to him, that was right, I told you I must forbid
you to go Sunday morning to a shop and get some one to shave you,
that it would be a sin for you to do this thing, but don't you see,
I did not do any asking."</p>

<p>Later in the old man's living, when his wife had died away and
left him, he came to live with a daughter who had not any kind of
an important feeling to herself inside her, neither from a religion
to be all her nor from a constant rising up inside her as the
dreary mother had it in her to have an almost important feeling to
be inside her from the constant trickling of her, the father later
came to live with this daughter who had a gentle dignity and good
ways in her from the sweet nature of her not from any important
feeling in her, and she and the man who was married to her, both,
though they had respect in them for the father, and goodness and a
delicate feeling to consider all who ever had to do with them,
though they were glad to do for him everything he wanted them to be
doing yet they had together very different ways of thinking, of
feeling, and of living than he had known it to be right to have all
his life in his necessary living.</p>

<p>The old father, strong as he always had been in his nature, firm
in being for himself all there was of religion, knowing to his
dying that religion was all there was of living, yet never in any
way was he ever interfering in the living and the feeling and the
thinking of his daughter or her husband or any of their children or
any of his own children who were there in the same house with him.
Now, for him who was no longer leading in a house with others shut
up with him, with him who was all there was of religion, for him,
now, that they were apart from him being grown men and women to
him, even though they were all together every minute with him,
although he was up to the last moment of dying as strong as ever in
the faith of him, to be himself and to be all there was of
religion, yet now it was not for him to ever in any way interfere
with any one of them. He never found out anything that was
happening, anything that he would not wish to know that any one of
them was doing. What a man does not know can never be a worry to
him. This was his answer to his children whenever any one of them
wanted to explain anything to him or to get him to agree to any new
thing in their living. And so he went on to the last minute of his
living, never having had any power in him over any one who was not
shut up with him and a necessary part of his living, strong always
in his being to himself all that were was of religion, strong in
knowing that religion was all there was of being. And so he went on
with his living, now never interfering with anybody's living, now
that he was himself for himself all there was of living, all there
was of religion, and religion always was all there was of living.
And so he went on to his dying and through his being so all himself
all there was of living and of religion, he was in his old age full
of toleration, and slowly in his dying it was a great death that
met him. He was himself all there was of him, all there was of
religion, and religion was all there was of living for him, and so
the dying from old age that came slowly to him all came together to
be him. He was religion, death could not rob him, he could lose
nothing in his dying, he was all that there was of him, all there
was of religion, and religion was all there was of living, and so
he, dying of old age, without struggling, met himself by himself in
his dying, for religion was everlasting, and so for him there could
be no ending, he and religion and living and dying were all one and
everything and every one and it was for himself that he was all
one, living, dying, being, and religion.</p>

<p>Even his dead wife with her trickling crying that had been to
her almost an important feeling of herself inside her, even she had
been apart from him, and his children when they were no longer shut
up with him were apart from him. All and everything was apart from
him, and so he died, and with him died his important feeling, for
even in his dying he had no power in him for any one not shut up
with him. He was all of power for him for he was for himself all
there was of religion. And that was all and he never had had any
power in him for anything not shut up with him. And so he died away
and left them and his important feeling died inside him.</p>

<p>All of his children had each mixed up in them the father,
important to himself in his religion, and the mother, with her
almost important feeling, with her constant trickling crying that
made her have inside her her almost important feeling. She with the
way it came from within her this almost important feeling that she
had inside her, could have a power with all who knew her. She was
not like her husband with his important feeling giving power only
with them like his little children who were shut up with him.</p>

<p>The children had many ways of having the father and the mother
mixed up to make them. One of them, as I was saying, the eldest of
them, was stubborn and gloomy and hard in her religion and it gave
her a power with her children but it was not so perfect to give her
her own important feeling as religion had been to her father to
give him the important feeling that was all him. In her own being
she was not all there was of religion, she as a woman had hard ways
that gave her power, not from her religion but from her power as a
woman, as any one can have it by using the hard ways everybody has
inside them, and so she was less in religion, she had no
toleration, she was hard stubborn and gloomy in religion, and
always she made it stronger by her power as a woman, and so she had
not the greatness in her that her father had who made her, and she
had not the almost greatness in her that the mother had arising
inside her with the dreary trickling crying that was all her. And
so in each one the father and the mother were variously mixed up in
them. Some of them had it in them as an almost important feeling
like Fanny Hissen who with this way of having it as a beginning,
the almost important feeling that the mother had with her dreary
trickling had it brought to a real beginning of a really important
feeling, by the knowing old fat Mrs. Shilling and her daughter
Sophie Shilling and her other daughter Pauline Shilling, and then
in her later living cut off from a lively sense of being part of
being which was for her the natural way of living she got it more
and more then from her servants and governesses and seamstresses
and dependents and the for her poor queer kind of people that she
had around her in this later living in that part of Gossols where
no other rich people were living, she got it from her power with
them, being as she was with them of them, and from her position and
her dignity of Hissen living always above them. From those ways
that her later living in that part of Gossols away from where the
other rich people were living gave to her, in this later living
there came to her a kind of importance of herself inside her that
was nearly an individual kind of feeling and this was what gave to
her family later when she came to pay visits to them out of the far
west to them, gave them a sense as if she were almost a princess
for them, out of from them, belonging to them, having a different
feeling of herself inside her from any other ones of them. Not that
this was, in her, in any sense the complete thing of being
important to herself inside her, it was only more marked in her
than any other of them had found it from the natural way of living
it had come to all the rest of them to be leading.</p>

<p>It was not different in her from the rest of them in one
important thing. It was mixed up in her with the stubborn feeling
that the not having the complete important feeling that the father
had from being all there was of religion gave to all of them who
had a little of him in them.</p>

<p>All of them, as they had more or less of him in them, had it as
a stubborn feeling, for none of them had it as a complete thing as
he had had it inside him, and with the eldest of them, as I was
saying, she who had most of the religion, with her it was a hard
gloomy stubborn feeling and so this eldest one who had as much
important feeling as the Fanny who had lived away from them and
then had had in her come this for them important thing, this eldest
of them although she was a power to all the rest of them by reason
of the important feeling they knew inside her for them, was never a
princess to them, she had not the gentleness and generous dignity
that won them as their other sister had for them she who had had
made to her the important feeling of herself inside her by the
being away from all of them, away from the natural way of living
for them.</p>

<p>Then there were others of them who had all the sweetness in them
that had turned to dreary trickling in the mother who had born all
them, and one of those who had this sweetness in her dignity and
gentleness and generous ways and so was a power to them was the one
that the father lived with after his dreary wife had died away and
left them.</p>

<p>With these who had sweetness in them, with those who had changed
into sweetness the dreary trickling of the mother that had born
them, many of them, strongest in them after the sweetness and
gentle dignity that made them, had it as the strongest thing inside
them to be hurt not angry when any bad thing happened to them, they
would be hurt then and their mouths would be drooping. And always
all of these, the sweetest of them, had in them some of the
stubbornness that not being the complete thing as their father had
been was sure to put into them.</p>

<p>In some of them the mixing of the trickling and the stubbornness
inside them came to make an angry feeling that came in flashes from
them, in some of them it came to make a suspicious feeling inside
them that made it hard for them to trust in women or in men, and
always, as I was saying, the father and the dreary mother were very
variously mixed up in each one of them.</p>

<p>As I was saying, one of them who even more than Fanny Hissen had
the almost important feeling that the mother had inside her with
her constant trickling crying that was always rising in her, this
one came to have it even more in her, came to have it almost really
in her by an individual kind of thinking that arose of itself
inside her. She had the gentle tenderness in her that made constant
dreary trickling in her mother, and it came all from inside her,
and she had no stubborn ways in her, she was pure as the sweetest
ones of those around her those who had turned to sweetness the
dreariness of their mother, and she had not stubbornness inside
her, she had only from her father the thinking that had made him
for himself to be all there was of power. And this one of the
Hissen women came very near to winning, came very near to seeing,
came very nearly making of herself to herself a really individual
being. She was a little not strong enough in keeping going, and so
with her it came only to being a very nearly really important
feeling of herself to herself inside her. And she was the nearest
any of them ever came to winning.</p>

<p>There were very many of them and each one, of course, had his or
her own individual way of feeling, thinking, and of doing, and with
all of them the father and the mother were variously mixed up in
them, and with some of them it was more the father and it made
sometimes a stubborn feeling to be the most important thing inside
them after the family that made all them and sometimes this the
stubborn feeling met in them with the other things they had within
them and sometimes then it was a sharp bright angry feeling that
was strongest in them after the family way that had made all them,
and these then would have a stubborn or an angry feeling when
anything happened to any one of them. And then in some of them it
was the dreary mother that was strongest in them and they had a
sweetness in them and these then would have hurt feelings in them
and very often with them then, their mouths would be drooping and
these would then be hurt not angry when any bad thing happened to
them. And sometimes there was a mixing up of all these ways
together in them.</p>

<p>But mostly all of them were cheerful hopeful contented men and
women, mostly they lived without ambition or excitement but they
were each in their little circle joyful in the present. Mostly they
lived and died in mildness and contentment.</p>

<p>David Hersland married Fanny Hissen. He took her out to Gossols
with him. He married her in Bridgepoint where her family had always
been living. David Hersland had been there visiting a sister who
had settled there with her man who was making a very good living.
David Hersland was a young man then but already he had made by
himself enough money to support himself and a wife and children.
And now it had come to him to go west to Gossols where he was to
make a great fortune. And so it was right for his sister at this
time to arrange a marriage for him. The idea of going to Gossols
was just beginning in him. Perhaps marrying might keep him from
going, any way it would be good for him to have a good wife to go
to Gossols with him.</p>

<p>He met Fanny Hissen and she was pleasing to him. It was arranged
by his sister that this young woman was to be married to him. They
married soon after the first meeting and then they mixed up their
two natures in them and then through them there came the three
children, Martha, Alfred, and young David, and these three are of
them who are to be always in this history of us young grown men and
women to us. In the history of them we will be always ourselves and
our friends inside them for so we know them those who are for us
always young grown men and women to us even when they are of the
age of children or later grown old men and women. Always they are
us and we them and so always they are for us young grown men and
women.</p>

<p>So now then we begin again this history of us and always we must
keep in us the knowledge of the men and women who as parents and
grandparents came together and mixed up to make us and we must have
always in us a lively sense of these mothers and these fathers, of
how they lived and married and then they had us and we came to be
inside us in us. We must realise always in us, so that we can know
what is us, we must realise inside us their lives and marriages and
feelings and how they all slowly came to make us. All things in
them must be important to us. And so we must know slowly inside us
how they came to be married and so made us, and we must know, so
that we can know what we feel inside us, we must know the kind of
important feeling in them that made them what they were in their
living marrying and thinking, the things that were always inside
them, the things that gave each one of them their individual
feeling.</p>

<p>In the slow history of three of those who are to be always in
this history of us young grown men and women to us, in the slow
history of Martha Alfred and young David Hersland, of how they came
each one to have their kind of important individual feeling inside
them in them, in this slow history of them the thing that we have
as a beginning is the history of Fanny Hissen and David Hersland,
of their living marrying and their important feeling, and so now we
leave the rest of the Hissen living and begin with Fanny and David
Hersland and their marrying and then we go on with the important
feeling that was always in him and the important feeling and its
beginning in her with the new kind of living, and then in her later
living how she came to be so strong in this important feeling that
when she came back to Bridgepoint to visit the rest of them, the
Hissens who had led the for them natural way of living, she was
then a kind of princess to them. They did not know, any of them,
what it was that made her so different from them. It was only her
kind of feeling, rich ways and simple and expensive clothing and
far western living could never give them the sense of her being as
a princess to them, it was that she had in her, from her way of
living that was not the natural way of living for her, it was from
this living that had come to her and from the mother who had been
begun again inside her that she had come to have a small almost
important feeling of herself inside her. This made her different
from the others of them. Only the eldest of them had it as a power
in her, an important feeling of herself inside her, and they all
could not bear it from her for she had no sweetness toward them in
her. But all this history of her will come later. Now David
Hersland is to be married to her and she is to leave her family
feeling all behind her.</p>

<p>Later there will be more talking of the natural Hissen way of
living. Later when the Hersland children have grown to be ready to
begin their later living then we will know more of some of them, of
some of the Hissen family in the, for them, natural way of living,
of what it is in each one of them that makes him different from the
others of them, even though they have not ever inside in them a
really individual feeling. The mixture in them of the father who
was to himself all there was of living and the dreary mother who
had almost an important feeling was different in every one of them.
Later Alfred and young David came to know them the gentle cheerful
Hissen men and women. Alfred later lived with some of them. When he
came to college he stayed with them and later he was there near
them when he was married to Julia Dehning. And then young David
stayed with some of them and always he was puzzling himself and
them and no one of them could help him, but they all were kind and
listened to him, he was puzzling in him every day to find out what
it was that could make life worth his living. Martha Hersland never
came to see them, she had her trouble far from all of them and then
she went out of her trouble back to Gossols and so she never saw
them. In American teaching marrying is just loving but that is not
enough for marrying. Loving is alright as a beginning but then
there is marrying and that is very different. In many towns there
are many in each generation, decent well to do men, who keep on in
their daily living and never come to any marrying. They all do a
little loving. Everybody sometime does a little loving. It takes
more for marrying, sometimes it needs a sister of the man to make
his marrying, sometimes the mother of the girl who is to be married
to him. Mostly it is not the mother of the man nor any sister who
has not already then a husband and children who makes marriages for
them. Mostly for marrying it takes a sister of the man, one who has
already for herself a husband and children or a mother of the girl
who is to be married to him. This is not so when they are young,
the man and woman, and both are lively in the feeling of loving. It
is so when the man has come to be fixed in his way of living, when
he finds it pleasant to go on as he is doing. It is then that it is
not enough to feel a little loving, it takes then his sister, or
the girl herself if she is strong to do the work for winning, or a
mother of the girl, to get the man really ripe for marrying.</p>

<p>The American teaching is very well for young people or for poor
ones or for those who are strong in a sense of loving, who have a
lively sense of wanting, who have strongly the instinct for mating,
but for most of them, the well to do, comfortable men and women, it
takes more to make a marriage for them, it takes others who are
strong to help them, who have strongly inside them the need that
all the world keep on going, who have strongly inside them the
sense of the right way of living. Mostly those who have a strong
sense inside them of the right way of living, of having all the
world going on to marrying are the sisters of the men, they who
have already then for themselves a man and children, and the
mothers of the girls who are to be married to the men, and
sometimes it happens that the mother of the man has strongly inside
her this sense of right doing, those mothers who are not strong in
jealous feeling whose sons are not as lovers to them, and this is
the way it happens to almost all the comfortable well to do men and
women and the American tradition makes us lie about them and mostly
in our writing there are none of these ordinary, good enough,
comfortable, well to do men and women.</p>

<p>American teaching says it is all loving but all who know many
families of women, all who know comfortable well to do men with a
regular way of living know that it is all mostly lying that says it
is loving that is strong to make a beginning, they need a sister
who has already for herself her own man and children or a girl who
is strong to make for herself her own winning or the mother of the
girl who is to be married to him. It takes one and sometimes even
all three of them and with it a fair amount of loving to make the
marrying of well to do men and women. Loving is good but it has to
be a very lively sense inside him to make it enough for a well to
do man to get married to a woman. Loving is good, and the girl has
to be pleasing to him, but it needs coaxing, arranging, flattering
teasing, urging, a little good tempered irritated forcing, or else
the man will forget all about his loving. It is so easy to forget a
little loving. And then he must see her very often and when he is
drifting he must be brought back out of his forgetting. And it is
right that they should do this for him else how would there be the
right kind of marrying, how would there come to be existing the
decent, honest enough, comfortable men and women that never get in
the American tradition any recognition, but they are always in the
world existing these decent well to do men and women with the not
very lively sense in them of loving and their easy forgetting, and
there are the women, they are always existing, they who have inside
them strongly the right feeling of how the world was in its
beginning and how it must keep on going. And so there is the right
kind of marrying and decent well to do fathers and good mothers are
always existing who have a decent loyal feeling of the right kind
of loving and they have their children and so they keep on going
and we decent respectable well to do comfortable good people are
all of them. This business of marrying and loving is very different
with the very young, or poor or with quite old men. With all of
these loving is strong inside them, they are not so peaceable with
their forgetting, they are quicker with marrying than comfortable
well to do young men.</p>

<p>They are many families of women and the men find some in each
one of them pleasing, and then the men go drifting, doing a little
loving and then a little forgetting, and then restarting, until
they get so strongly the feeling of loving, if they have the right
kind of helping, that they come to have so strongly in them the
feeling of loving that then it is an effort for them to begin again
with their forgetting, and then they are ripe for marrying, and one
of the family of women has him and marrying contents them and they
have the right kind of living for them and everything keeps on as
it was in the beginning. It is the truth that I have been
telling.</p>

<p>David Hersland's sister Martha arranged his marriage for him.
She was right to arrange a marriage for him. David had made enough
money to support himself and a wife and children. Going to the far
west was just beginning to work in him. Perhaps marrying might keep
him from going, anyway it would be good for him to have a good wife
to go to Gossols with him.</p>

<p>Martha, David Hersland's sister who arranged his marriage for
him, had been married five years to a decent good man who had
settled in Bridgepoint where he was making for himself a very good
living. They had two children.</p>

<p>Martha was one of the two Hersland women who had done very well
in marrying. She had an important feeling and this was like the
father's feeling in religion, and she was like her mother in her
way of keeping on strongly when she had made a beginning, and she
always made a beginning whenever it was right for her to do so for
her feeling. She was the best one of all of them to arrange a
marriage for a brother who needed to have a good wife to go out to
Gossols with him. Martha was very like her father. She was a small
good enough looking woman with blue eyes and with a manner that was
not very unpleasing. She was like her father because she loved to
be important, but with her it was not in religion. She was
different from him because she loved to be doing. She loved to be
important by the doing of all the things that were right to do to
her feeling. One of these things was the marrying her brother so
that he would have a good wife to follow him and serve him. She
thought a great deal about it and she did a good deal of talking
and at last she decided to choose Fanny Hissen.</p>

<p>Martha, David Hersland's sister, who always did whatever it was
right for her to do, to her feeling, was not very unpleasing. In
some ways she was quite pleasing, she was so to her husband, to him
she was very pleasing. She was not really pleasing to her brother
David Hersland, to him she was not appealing nor domineering and it
took women of these two kinds to be pleasing to him, but he knew
she was a good woman who would always do what was right for her to
do to her feeling, and mostly he thought she was right in her
feeling and in her way of doing what was right to her feeling and
so he was willing that she should choose a wife to content him.</p>

<p>To her husband this Martha was almost always pleasing. He was a
big man with strong passion in him and a sentimental feeling and he
wanted a wife, not to be domineering, but to hold him with her
attraction, and always to be equal to him. He did not want a wife
to appeal to him, he would not have one to domineer over him. It
was his sentimental feeling that made him not want his wife to be
appealing, he wanted to make her an ideal to him. He was a man to
be master in his living and so he never would have a wife to
domineer over him.</p>

<p>Martha Hersland who was married to him was just right for him.
She was the woman to hold him and this one can see from the nature
of her as it will come out from her in the history of her as she
makes the marriage for her brother.</p>

<p>In some ways Martha was not very pleasing, she was a woman to
make a beginning and to keep on going when it was right to do so,
to her feeling. When she met with stronger women she would not stop
herself from winning, she would not know that she was then losing
she only dropped out of that working and made for herself a new
beginning. She was not a strong woman, as her mother had been, the
mother who was like a mountain, who had it in her to uphold around
her, her man, her family, and everybody whom she saw needing
directing. Martha was not in such a way a strong woman, she was not
in any such way pleasing. She was like her father in her important
feeling, but she was stronger than he ever had been, in keeping
going, she was fonder of making a beginning, she always liked to be
doing, and so she was not very pleasing, in some ways she was very
pleasing.</p>

<p>It is this that we must use as a beginning to understand this
kind of woman, to feel what she was doing in arranging a marriage
for her brother David to content him, to see what she had strongly
inside her of an important feeling, to know why she had the right
way of doing whatever was right to her feeling in the business of
living, to know how her husband could find her so satisfying, to
find out how she was pleasing.</p>

<p>Martha was a good woman in doing whatever it was right for her
to do, to her feeling. She was fond of doing, good at making a
beginning, and almost strong enough to keep on going. It was always
all right for her when there was not any strong person resisting,
for then she was always strong enough to keep on going and then,
though mostly, not altogether winning, she came then near enough to
winning to give to her her important feeling. She would not end in
any kind of winning if any other one kept up any resisting, then
Martha would not know she was losing, she would begin with some
other beginning and so she never could lose her important feeling.
Her husband listened to her talking, he knew what she did from her
telling, she was not strong to be domineering, she was strong
enough not to be appealing, she was always attractive to him, she
filled up his sentimental feeling, she was an ideal to him with no
power to disturb him, she was always pleasing to him. As I was
saying her brother did not find her pleasing but he knew she was a
good woman, he felt that she was mostly right in her feeling and in
her ways of doing, he was willing that she should choose a wife for
him to content him and he was right to let her choose for him.</p>

<p>Martha's husband had a cousin who had once worked for old Mr.
Hissen. This cousin and his wife came to know them enough to see
them very often. There were not many people who came to know them
enough to see them very often. The old man Hissen had his wife and
children shut up with him as much and as long as he could keep
them. One of them, the eldest girl among them, the one that had
most in her, of all of them, of religion, had already come to her
marrying. A cousin from another town came to see them and she
wanted him and he wanted her to take care of him, and then they
made the father consent to their marrying. Perhaps he liked it
better that they had no good prospects before them. Marrying should
be a sorrow to them, and the mother sorrowed in them, living was
all sadness and she knew that it would be so for them. Anyway they
were married and they were living happily enough when the wife did
not feel too strongly her importance in religion. Now that they
were married the old folks did not interfere with them.</p>

<p>This cousin of Martha's husband who had come to see a good deal
of them tried to arrange a marriage between his brother and another
of the Hissen sisters, one of the pleasantest of them. It was a
good chance for her for the brother of the cousin was a very well
to do man and he was a good enough man though a very stupid and a
dull one. It was a good chance for one of them and this one, one of
the pleasant ones of them was willing to meet him but seeing him
set her off laughing and every time she saw him again she went on
laughing and at last he grew angry and that was the end of her
marrying. She never came again to the point of having a man want
her to content him. There were a number of the Hissen women who
never came to marrying. Their way of living and with no one except
strangers to help them and the eldest daughter not doing very well
in her marrying and being gloomy and important in religion and
never very strong in pushing or doing things to help them, it came
to their being a family of women and three of them, and they were
of the pleasant ones among them never came to have a man who wanted
any one of them to content him. They lived with their father and
later with another one of them who had done very well in marrying
and they were all together then gentle cheerful little older women,
they were each in their circle cheerful in the present, they lived
and died in mildness and contentment.</p>

<p>But now there was a chance for the marrying of another one of
them, of Fanny Hissen and she was soon now to meet David Hersland
and to see whether she would be pleasing to him, to make a wife to
him to content him.</p>

<p>Martha had come to know them well enough to see them fairly
often. She was pleasing to the old man Hissen. She was a sensible
good woman and always neat in her dressing. She was not afraid of
him. She was a patient woman and would listen to the trickling
little woman who had always in her sorrowing, who told her often
what she thought of living. She was a friend of the eldest daughter
of them the one who was married to her cousin. Martha was sure that
it was right to do whatever was good in religion. For her it was
not religion, for her it was the right way to do in the business of
living that was important in her being, but she had a sentiment for
religion, she had a respect for the oldest daughter's important
feeling. It was alright for both of them for Martha had her
important feeling and it was not in religion, it was in the matter
of every day living, and so there was no quarrelling between these
two women and their kind of important feeling. They each had much
respect in them for the other one's way of feeling and right way of
doing.</p>

<p>Martha was a neat woman. She was a strong enough woman and
always active in doing. She had a kind of sentimental feeling and
that made her respect the Hissen religion, she had a hard way of
thinking and that made her like the gentleness of all the pleasant
Hissen women, she had a kind of a common feeling and that made her
respect the old Hissen woman who spent her life in sorrowing, in
weeping out the sadness of all living. And yet always Martha had
the important feeling, she knew what was the right way to do to
keep on living, to help people to marrying, to make the world keep
on as it was in the beginning.</p>

<p>Martha was always talking about the Hissen girls and their way
of living. She got almost to feel that she was a sister and a
mother to them. They did not have in them any such feeling but then
the Hissen women all had a pride in them that they did not have any
kind of a common feeling in them, even the eldest one who was so
unpleasant to the others of them never had any common feeling. Such
a thing could never be in any of the Hissen men or women.</p>

<p>To the Hissen women this Martha was always a little common. But
they were wrong in their feeling. This Martha was not really inside
her even a little common, it was her hard way of thinking that gave
the Hissens such a feeling. It was that she did not have in her any
fine feeling. All the Hissen men and women had fine feeling. This
Martha did not have any fine feeling but she was not common in her
feeling. In Martha it was a hard way of thinking that was
deceiving.</p>

<p>Any way the Hissen girls who were coming now to be women and who
began to feel in them the liking to have men choose them to content
them, were very willing to let this Martha do what they could not
do themselves with the finer kind of feeling they all had in them.
Not that Martha ever had a common match making feeling or ever
wanted to do anything except just what it was right for her to do
to her feeling. It was not a common or mean feeling that made
Martha do what she did for them. It was a strong sense of what was
right for her to do in the business of living to make the world go
on as it was in the beginning; it was too, that she had a feeling
for the gentle dignity that was the most important thing in all
Hissen men and women so that they could not help themselves to win
for themselves the things every one needs to have for his
living.</p>

<p>And so it came that she chose Fanny Hissen to be the one that
should be married to her brother David Hersland who needed now to
have a wife to content him, to go to Gossols with him, to help him
in his living, to have children for him so that the world could go
on as it had from the beginning. Martha was right to choose Fanny
Hissen to content him. As I was saying Martha was not very pleasing
to her brother David Hersland who needed a woman to be appealing or
a woman to have power, to make her attractive to him. One can see
by the feeling that this Martha had for all the Hissen men and
women that she was not appealing nor had strongly a power of
attracting, and yet she was a good woman, and not very unpleasing,
and David was right to let her choose a wife to content him. She
could never have any reason to do anything that was not right to
her feeling. She had enough of important feeling so that she would
not have any jealous feeling to interfere with her right judging,
and she had a hard feeling and that gave her a kind of common being
that made her have in her a feeling that always would respect the
fine being in the Hissen men and women, and yet she never could
feel that she was not right to manage for them, for they had the
weakness in them from being so fine in the gentle dignity and
feeling that made all them, that they could never do for themselves
what was necessary, for them to ever be winning what they needed
for their living. And so she arranged a marriage for them for
marrying David Hersland and Fanny Hissen.</p>

<p>It went very quickly from the beginning for Fanny Hissen was
very pleasing to him and David Hersland had nothing common in him
for them. He was too big in his feeling and in the way he made any
one who saw him feel him ever to give any one, even gentle Hissen
men and women any such feeling.</p>

<p>Martha was in a way common to them. David never gave any one of
them any such feeling. Martha was not low in her feeling. It was
her hard being that gave them such a feeling. She was always
considering them in her feeling, she had respect for them and felt
in them all the fine things they had inside them but to them she
was not sensitive in her feeling, she was always a little common to
them always a little low to them, they felt it always inside in
them. With her brother David Hersland they never had any such
feeling. David never gave any one of them any such feeling. And
yet, as I was saying, it was not because Martha was lower in her
being that they had always this feeling. The old man Hissen had not
such a feeling. Martha was more pleasing to him then than she was
to any of the others of them. To the others of them it was a
certain thing inside her that was not so much hard but not
sensitive or appealing that made them feel her to be a little
common, to their feeling. David Hersland never gave any of them
such a feeling.</p>

<p>It was not because Martha was low in her feeling. Martha was not
low in her feeling, she had no dirty ways inside her in her
feeling. Always she would do what it was right to do to her
feeling. But not having the delicate kind of feeling made her feel
things to be right that were right to the Hissen feeling but were
not pleasant to them to see anybody doing. As I was saying, the old
man Hissen had not any such feeling. No Martha was not low in her
feeling and she was strong to do what was right to her feeling and
only in little ways was she unpleasant to the Hissen men and women,
though she was never really pleasing to them. She had not in her
any power to impress them or anything appealing to win them.</p>

<p>No Martha was not low in her feeling. David had things in him
that would be very low to them if they knew they were inside him
but they never could come to know such things in him. He was so big
in his feeling he could always carry them along inside him, inside
him or outside him it was all one, he was in them they were in him
and they could never come to any judgment toward him and so they
never could come to know any low thing in him. It was very
different with the feeling they always had that Martha was below
them Martha had very little of any low or dirty feeling. She was
not delicate in her feeling. She was a good enough looking woman,
not unpleasing, always neat in her dressing and attractive enough
like most good enough looking women. It was mostly never a low
feeling she had in her and never toward any one of them but they
mostly all always had inside them a certain sense that she was
common to them. David Hersland never gave to any of them any such
feeling. He was as big as all the world in his beginning and low
and high and noisy and delicate it was all in him, he was it, they
were in him and low things were big in him so that no one could
ever feel them in him as low things inside him, no never not even
when he was an old man and things were falling down inside him and
around him in his being.</p>

<p>The only one who had a feeling that Martha was really pleasing
was her husband and she was just right for him. He only heard what
she said to him in anything that she had been concerned in and so
he never came to any feeling that she was not a strong woman to win
out in the things she always loved to be beginning. He never could
know that she was not strong in winning. She always did, to
herself, whatever it was right for her to do, to her feeling when
she met with the beginning of a losing she would not stop herself
from winning, she would not know that she was then losing, she only
dropped out of that working and made for herself a new beginning.
She was not a strong woman as her mother had been. Mostly she was
not pleasing for she was not strong in winning nor beginning and
she had nothing appealing to make her attractive to men or women
and so she was not very pleasing, but she was a good enough woman
to become a friend of the Hissen men and women, to be satisfying to
old Mr. Hissen and to have her brother David Hersland let her
choose a wife for him to content him. She was good in doing
whatever it was right for her to do, to her feeling. She was fond
of doing, good at making a beginning, almost strong enough to keep
on going. It was always all right for her when there was not any
strong person resisting, for then she was always strong enough to
keep on going, and then, though mostly not altogether winning, she
would come near enough to winning to keep in her her important
feeling. She would not end in any kind of winning if any one kept
up any resisting, then Martha would not know she was losing, she
would begin with some other beginning, and so she never would lose
any important feeling.</p>

<p>To her husband she was altogether pleasing. He had much very
soggy passion in him and he had always inside him sentimental
feeling so that he wanted a wife, not to be domineering but to hold
him so that his passion could have a solid thing to bring it
together in him, so that his wife should always be equal to him. He
did not want a wife to appeal to him. It was his sentimental
feeling that made him not want his wife to be appealing, he wanted
to make of her an ideal to him. He was a man to be master in his
living and so he never would have a wife to domineer over him, he
wanted a wife to be equal to him so that she could harden for him
the muddy passion in him, he wanted a wife to be an ideal to him to
satisfy his sentimental feeling.</p>

<p>Martha was to him always pleasing. Her husband listened to her
talking, he knew what she did from her telling, she was not strong
to be domineering, she was strong enough not to be appealing, she
was always attractive to him, she filled up his sentimental
feeling, she was an ideal to him, with no power to disturb him. She
was always pleasing to him.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how to the Hissen men and women Martha was
always a little common. Between the eldest of the Hissen women and
Martha there was more of an equal feeling. Martha always did what
was right to her feeling. Martha had in her a feeling that it was
right to do things in religion. Not that she had in her any feeling
in religion. Religion was in her a sentimental kind of feeling. In
her what was important to her feeling was the right way to do in
the business of living, what was the right way for her to be doing
so that she would do what was right to do to her feeling. She had a
strong respect for the eldest daughter's important feeling. She had
a strong respect for her important feeling in religion. It was
alright for both of them. Martha had her important feeling and it
was not in religion and each of these two women had much respect in
them for the other ones way of feeling and right way of doing.</p>

<p>To all the other Hissen men and women Martha was a good woman,
and she was a good friend to them but she was not really
pleasing.</p>

<p>To her brother she was not really pleasing but she was a good
enough woman for him to choose a wife for him to content him.</p>

<p>Soon now then Fanny Hissen was married to David Hersland and
went out to Gossols with him, and now together they were to begin
their living, to make children who perhaps would come to have in
them a really important feeling of themselves inside them.</p>

<p>David Hersland who was to be the father of them, of the three
children who were not yet come into the world through them, had
always in him an important feeling, not inside him for it was all
of him, everything was of him and he was it and there was not any
difference for him between himself and everything existing.</p>

<p>The mother who was to bear the three children, she perhaps would
come to an important feeling, she did not have it as a natural
thing to have really an important feeling. With her it must come
from a, to her, not natural way of living, and it first had its
beginning with her friendship with the Shilling women. Then it came
to be stronger with the living in Gossols in the ten acre place in
the part of Gossols where no other rich people were living, where
she was cut off from the rich living which was for her the natural
way of being.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fanny Hersland had always had in her the beginning of an
almost important feeling which she had from being like her mother
in her nature, the mother who had had, in her sad trickling arising
of itself inside her, an almost important feeling. This beginning
of an almost important feeling, had never in Fanny Hissen been very
real inside her while she was living in Bridgepoint, for then the
strongest thing in her was the family way of being and that always
would have been just so strong in her and it never would have come
to her to have any realler feeling of being important to herself
inside her if she had not gone to Gossols and left the family way
of being behind her. It was only when she left the family way of
living, when she went out to Gossols where she was to have none of
the being always a part of the well to do living, that it came to
her to begin to have this almost important feeling. It was not
marrying that gave her such a feeling. Marrying would never have
changed her from her family way of being, it was going to Gossols
and leaving the family being and having a for her unnatural way of
living that awoke in her a sense inside her of the almost important
feeling that was to come to be inside in her.</p>

<p>It had its beginning with her knowing, in the hotel where the
Herslands were living before they settled down in the ten acre
place, it had its beginning with her knowing old Mrs. Shilling and
her daughter Sophie Shilling and her other daughter Pauline
Shilling. With them there began inside her a sense of individual
being, not that it was different in her to her feeling, it was only
different in her being. Now she had no longer in her as the
strongest thing inside her the Hissen way of being that was then
all her and was the natural way of being to her. Later it grew
stronger in her, this being, that never was different to her in her
feeling that she knew inside her, but later it grew stronger in
her, a very little by her husband and the power over him she had in
her, but mostly with the living that came soon to be all the being
there was of her, the living with her servants and governesses and
dependents and the for her poor queer kind of people who lived near
her, and the way she had of being a power, of being of them, with
them, and always above them, and the feeling they had in them; and
all this gave to her the real being of an almost important
feeling.</p>

<p>When one just met with them, old heavy flabby Mrs. Shilling and
her daughter the fat Sophie Shilling and the other daughter the
thinner Pauline Shilling, they were at first meeting and even after
longer knowing like many other ordinary women. Yet always one had a
little uncertain feeling that perhaps each one of them had
something queer in her. One could never be very certain with them
whether this possible queerness of them was because of something
queer inside in all them or that they were queer because something
had been left out in each one of them in the making of them or that
they had lost something out of them that should have been inside in
them, that something had dropped out of each one of them and they
had been indolent of stupid or staring each one of them then and
they had not noticed such a dropping out of them. Each one of them
had perhaps a hole then somewhere inside in them and this may have
been that which gave to each one of them the queerness that it was
never certain was ever really there in any one of them. One never
was certain with them that there was anything queer about them.
Mostly they were just ordinary stupid enough women like millions of
them.</p>

<p>The mother was one of those fat heavy women who are all straight
down the whole front of them when they are sitting. When they are
walking they are always slowly waddling with heavy breathing. Many
such heavy fat flabby waddling women have something queer about
them. These have big doughy empty heads on top of them. These heads
on them give to one a kind of feeling such as a baby's head gives
to one in the first months of its being living, that the head is
not well fastened to them, that it will fall off them if one does
not hold it together on them. This kind of a head on them is what
gives these fat flabby women the queerness about them that makes
strange things of them. They have been living, working, cooking,
directing, they have been chosen by a man to content him, they have
had children come into the world through them, sometimes strong men
and women have been born from inside them, they have made marriages
for their children and managed people around them, they have lived
and suffered and some of them have had power in them, and they are
flabby now with big doughy heads that wobble on them.</p>

<p>It is a queer feeling that one has in them and perhaps it is,
that they have something queer in them something that gives to one
a strange uncertain feeling with them for their heads are on them
as puling babies heads are always on them and it gives to one a
queer uncertain feeling to see heads on big women that look loose
and wobbly on them.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Shilling was such a one. It was uncertain always even
after a long knowing of her whether the wobbly head on her was all
that made a strange thing of her or whether there was something
queer inside in her, different from the others of them, different
from all of them who always give to one a strange uncertain
feeling, all the many fat ones who are made just like her. Perhaps
that was all that was queer in her, that which is always queer in
all the many fat ones who are made just like her.</p>

<p>The fat daughter Sophie Shilling in the ways one mostly felt her
has many millions who are made just like her. The fat daughter
Sophie Shilling was a little like her mother but her head was not
yet wobbly on her. Sometimes there was something about her that
perhaps came from something queer inside her. Mostly she was just
an ordinary rather fat young woman and there are many millions made
just like her.</p>

<p>As one knew her with her mother and her sister she was an
amiable enough good sister and daughter. Mostly one felt that she
was a very good sister and a very good daughter. Not that it was a
family of women that as far as one could know them were very trying
to one another. They seemed to have enough money to live
comfortably in the hotel together. They had a poodle dog who was
company for the mother. They never quarreled with each other. They
did not have any troubles there at the hotel where they were
comfortably living together.</p>

<p>Sophie Shilling and Pauline Shilling were sisterly with one
another. Sophie Shilling like most fat sisters was afraid of the
thinner. Sometimes it is the thinner who is afraid of the fatter
when two daughters are sisterly together but most often it is the
fat sister who is afraid of the thinner. It is not so much being
older or younger that makes sisters afraid of one another, it is a
kind of power that always one has over the other, mostly it is the
fat one who is afraid of the other because it would hurt more if
pins were stuck into her, not that the thinner is always in any way
meaner, sometimes it is the fat one who is afraid who is the
meaner, but there is so much more of her, there is so much more
unprotected surface to her, somehow, it is that which makes her
afraid of the thinner even when the thin one is really never nasty
to her. This was true of the sisters Sophie Shilling and Pauline
Shilling, the fat one always had fear in her but the thin one never
in any way was ever mean or nasty to her. It is this fear that the
fat one has in her that often makes the people who know her and see
the mother and the sister with her feel that the thin one has mean
ways in her. Not that the fat one complains of her but there is a
fear in her, and often it is only a fear from there being so much
of her, but when others feel the fear in her they are sure it must
come from the mean things the thinner one does to her. So it was
with Sophie Shilling and they were very sisterly together.</p>

<p>It was a month or so after the Herslands had come to the hotel
that Mrs. Hersland began to know Sophie Shilling. She had met her
going about in the hotel and sometimes when she was out she met
with her and they came in together. They soon were a good deal
together. They soon began to call on each other. Mrs. Hersland
began to know the mother and the sister Pauline Shilling. Pauline
did not take much interest in her. Mostly she and Sophie did not
have friends together. The way in which Sophie was afraid of her
sister made any one who knew her have an awe of Pauline Shilling,
made them have a kind of feeling about her so that they could never
be easy with her. Always in them must be a suspicious feeling that
there was danger for them in her and they must not be too free when
being with her or talking to her. It was the fear in the fat sister
that gave to all who knew her a restraint when they were with
Pauline Shilling. Not that Sophie ever complained of her, not that
Sophie ever knew that she had such a fear in her. It was always
there though and affected all who knew her although from their own
knowing of her they could see that Pauline Shilling had no mean
ways in her. Of course there were people who first knew the thin
sister and they never had any such feeling about her. But all who
first knew Sophie Shilling never could come to be easy with her
sister. Mrs. Hersland first knew Sophie Shilling. It is easy to see
how the knowing Sophie Shilling and her mother and the sister
Pauline Shilling would awaken in her the always possible almost
important feeling that was quiet until then inside her.</p>

<p>Sophie Shilling never meant very much to her. They were very
much together and Fanny Hersland always felt for her. She had no
affection for her and after she moved away from the hotel she did
not very often see her.</p>

<p>The year that they both lived in the hotel they were a great
deal together but Sophie did not impress her, she never became
really important to her, Mrs. Hersland had not realty any affection
for her. Mrs. Hersland never came to feel any nearer to the mother,
and the sister Pauline Shilling. Knowing Sophie Shilling and her
mother and her sister was really very important to her. They were a
problem to her.</p>

<p>Always she had a feeling for Sophie Shilling. Sophie never
complained to her and the sister Pauline was always a puzzle to
her. She never came to really know inside her that the feeling she
had about Pauline Shilling was because of the fear that was always
in the fatter sister, a fear that she felt always to be inside
Sophie Shilling. Sophie never complained of her sister. She never
knew she had such a fear in her. At first Fanny Hersland always
felt for her, then slowly she felt that Pauline had no mean ways in
her. Pauline was always very pleasant to her, she was always very
decent to her mother and her sister Sophie. Perhaps later Mrs.
Hersland would have liked it better if she had not first known the
sister Sophie but that never really came to be a feeling inside
her, even to the end of her knowing her she always felt for her,
but, more and more it came to her that she was not sure of what she
felt about her or about the mother or the sister Pauline Shilling
and so it came to be that there commenced inside her, from the not
being certain of the judgment which was natural to her, there came
to be inside her a beginning of an almost individual feeling.</p>

<p>The thinner sister Pauline Shilling has not so many millions who
are made just like her. There have been always many millions made
just like the mother and the fatter sister Sophie Shilling but
there have never been so many millions made altogether like the
thinner sister Pauline Shilling. There have been always many
millions made just like the mother and the fatter sister Sophie
Shilling. That is, there have been always many millions made just
like them if they really have nothing queer inside them. Perhaps
they have something queer inside them that makes them different
from the many millions who have been made just like them.</p>

<p>There have been many millions made just like the mother and the
fatter sister Sophie Shilling. That is there are many millions who
have been made just like them all excepting the something queer
inside them which perhaps made them different inside them from the
many millions who have always been made just like them.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was nothing that was really queer inside them.
Perhaps it was only from the three of them living together and not
meaning much to one another and not meaning very much to any other
and so making all together a queer feeling when one felt them
together which lasted over to the knowing each one of them. And so
one had a feeling that there was something really queer inside
them. This was most likely all that they had of queerness in them.
They, did not have much meaning and the three of them being
together and not having much meaning for each other gave one a
sense of them that they had something queer inside them. Very
likely that was all there was of queerness in them.</p>

<p>The thinner sister Pauline Shilling seemed perhaps to have more
of individual being in her. Perhaps that was only because there are
not so many millions made just like her as there are many millions
made like her mother and her fatter sister. Perhaps that was all
the individual being that she had in her.</p>

<p>Perhaps really the queerness of them came from there not being
enough in each one of them to fill out the inside in them and so
they did not have much meaning or any power or any sense of
appealing.</p>

<p>The thinner one had not really any more meaning than the fatter
one or than the mother who had born them. She had a more individual
seeming because she was a thin one and she was one of them who have
not quite so many millions made just like them. But even as a thin
one she had not enough inside her to really fill her, to really
make her important, not inside her, but to any one who came to be
about her, she was not filled out enough inside her to give her any
power or make any appeal to any one who came near her. The
emptiness in her was different from the emptiness that was inside
her fatter sister or her mother.</p>

<p>Pauline Shilling had not any fear in her of any one such as her
sister had of her. The fatter sister had this fear in her because
she was not all filled up inside her and that gave to her all the
unprotected surface that she always had had on her and that made
her have a fear in her, not from anything that was ever done to
her, but from all the unprotected surface there was of her. She
never knew at any time that she had such a fear always inside her
and that made it the more deceiving in her, for one always felt it
with her but one never really knew it about her.</p>

<p>The thinner sister had not any such a fear in her as the fatter
sister had of her and always inside her. This is perhaps why one
has a feeling that they are not so many millions made just like
her. Perhaps there are as many millions made just like the thinner
sister as there are millions made like the fatter sister or the
mother.</p>

<p>The many millions made just like the fatter sister or the
mother, each one fills up so much more space than a thinner that
one gets the feeling that they are commoner, that there are many
more millions of them made fatter than there are millions made
thinner, and that these the fatter are made more just alike to one
another. It is the unprotected surface of these who are made like
the fatter sister, that make them seem more completely just like
one another than when they are thinner. It is the uncertain head on
the many millions made just like the mother that make them seem to
be exactly like each other, a great deal more like one another than
any of the thinner, alike as these may be to each other.</p>

<p>The vague fear the fatter one almost always has inside her gives
a more common quality to her than any other kind of fear she could
have in her. The vague fear that comes from all that unprotected
surface of her makes it easier to see in her that she is just like
all the other millions who have been made just like her all the
other millions who have the same kind of fear that she has in her.
This fear makes it easier to see a likeness to her than any other
kind of fear that she might have had inside her. The thinner sister
Pauline Shilling had a fear in her, she had a fear in her and all
the many millions who have been made just like her have the same
kind of fear as she has in her, but it is not from the unprotected
surface of her, one does not always feel it when one is with her,
it has not then the common feeling that can make it so apparent
that there are so many made just like her as the fear in her sister
makes it to every one that knows her.</p>

<p>The fear the thinner sister had always in her also came from
there being not enough inside to fill her, came not from the
unprotected surface of the outside of her but from her not being
filled out well inside her and so she had the fear in her that
always trying to fill up a hole in her without enough to fill it
from the being in her without making some other hole inside her,
was certain to give to her. This made her without any power, or
appeal to any one who was near her.</p>

<p>She was always busy inside in her filling up the hole in her
from the rest of her and so making another, for there was not
enough inside her ever to entirely fill her. Always she was filling
up a hole in her and always she was keeping anything from touching
her, everything from coming close to her lest it should push an
outside hole into her. She could never feel a power in any other,
she could not believe in any other, she could not concern herself
with any other, she could never let any other come close to her,
she was always there, not filled up inside her, and that was the
whole of her, that always gave a fear to her to be inside her, but
a kind of fear that did not make a common person of her, as the
fear inside her did with the fatter sister Sophie Shilling. It did
not make an individual of her because there was never there a whole
of her. She did not know that there was not a whole one of her.
This incompleteness of her only made a self-defensive instinct in
her, and that was all there was to her, comfort and keeping out of
danger was all there was of living to her, and so she had no power
in her for she had no power of attacking in her, for she was not
all together, and it gave her no appeal to any one who came near
her because they never could really come close to her, she could
not let them touch her lest they should push a hole into her. She
could not come near to any other, or believe in any other, and
always she must be concerned with herself and the defense of her
lest any one should touch her and make a hole into her.</p>

<p>That was all there was of queerness in her and there are many
millions who have been made just like her.</p>

<p>Always one was not certain in their judgement of her because she
was a good enough woman and always decent to her mother and her
sister and pleasant and good enough to every one who came near her.
Always there was in her that she would never let any one come very
close to her. It was a fear in her. It never came to any one to
know it about her for it was always self defensive in her. One felt
that they never came close to her and so she was a puzzle to all
who knew her, and sometimes they were suspicious of her and
sometimes sorry for her. So it was with Fanny Hersland and she
never came to know any more about her.</p>

<p>The mother of them was too empty to have any kind of a fear
inside her. Her head was like a baby's, wobbly on her. She never
could have an abiding fear inside her with such a head on top of
her. She was without any fear in her either such a one as her
fatter daughter had of another or as her thinner daughter Pauline
Shilling had it, lest anything might touch her, that something
might make her feel anything inside her.</p>

<p>This was very likely all of queerness that this family of women
had in them and it came to be about each one of them because they
were three together who had in each of them such an emptiness
inside them.</p>

<p>It made a queerness, there being three of them, that every body
felt who knew them. Always it was a puzzle to every one, for they
were pleasant enough women as one knew them together and each one
of them, they never quarreled with each other, they lived very
comfortably there in the hotel together. One never learnt anything
about them or against them, nobody gossiped about them, they were
plenty of people who knew them and came to see them. Each one of
them had their own friends and they always got along very nicely
with them, only somehow there was always there this emptiness they
had in them. It was a hole that each one had inside in her. It will
never be known about them whether they had been made so from the
beginning, whether something had been left out in each one of them
in the making of them or whether they had lost something out of
them that should have been inside in them, something that had
perhaps dropped out of each one of them and they had been indolent
or fearful or stupid or staring then, each one of them, and they
had not noticed such a dropping out of them. And so one could not
come to any certain judgment of them, one could never be sure about
them, that they had something queer inside them, or that they were
all three of them just like the many millions who have been made
just like them.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how this puzzling quality of them would awaken
in Mrs. Hersland who was almost always now with them, the always
possible almost important feeling that was quiet until then inside
her. She always had a feeling for Sophie Shilling but she had no
affection for her, Sophie was not in any way important to her, Mrs.
Hersland never came to feel any nearer to the mother and the sister
Pauline Shilling. She never came to feel certain about them inside
her and this not being certain of the kind of judgment which was
natural to her, made a beginning inside her of an almost individual
feeling, different in her, but not different to her, from the
family way of being which had always until then been all there was
of living to her.</p>

<p>The only important feeling Mrs. Hersland had in this time of
beginning her new living was with the Shillings as I have been
saying. After leaving the hotel she never saw much of them.
Occasionally she would call on them to show her children. All the
Shilling women were always good to them but they were never
important to them, there came to be soon very little visiting
between them and then very soon there was none. This was the end of
the beginning in Mrs. Hersland of the possible almost important
feeling.</p>

<p>Always now it kept on growing, a little from her husband and
making him do things through her compelling, but mostly from her
dependents, the governesses seamstresses servants and the others,
the for her poor queer people who soon came to be always around
her.</p>

<p>They had lived more than a year in the hotel. David Hersland who
was always strong in his beginning commenced then to find the way
to his great fortune. Soon he bought the place that was to be for a
long time a home to them, in that part of Gossols where no other
rich people were living. His children were then very little things
or just beginning, his wife had just begun to know some people of
the kind it was natural for her to have as friends in her daily
living.</p>

<p>Because of the living in the part of Gossols where no other rich
people were living she saw them soon only on occasional formal
visiting, the children did not then learn to be accustomed to rich
well to do kind of people and their living, the mother lost the
habit of going to visit with them, she never at all lost the sense
of well to do living, she just lost the habit of normal visiting,
of being with them the people who were the natural people to have
as friends in her daily living. She lived with her husband and her
children and her dependents and the for her queer poor people who
lived around them in that part of Gossols where no other rich
people were living.</p>

<p>Big as all the world in his beginning how could David Hersland
have a weak place in him then. The way he did the educating of his
three children will make the nature in him become clear to them,
will make it clear too to any one who will come to know the nature
of them and the education that he gave them.</p>

<p>There were three of them and they all three of them came to have
inside them their own kind of important feeling. That came through
their being of him and from the education he gave to them which
made them uneven in them, being of him and mixed up with the wife
who bore them, made them uneven as he was always before them,
uneven like the whole world together that he had in him and so it
came that he was uneven as the whole world inside him and around
him and so it was that there were weak places in him as there are
in the big world which was all him. He was all full up inside him
but it was not all the same all through him.</p>

<p>He was all full up inside in him and he was a big man and so
there was very much in him and of him. He was all full up inside
him, there was not much of any way that anything could enter into
him. There was in him the kind of loving that he had for the wife
he had chosen to content him and the children who awoke in him a
different kind of feeling for each one of them and who were to win
through him each one of the three of them a different kind of
important feeling each one of them to have inside in them to
content them.</p>

<p>The loving David Hersland had in him for his wife was that in
some ways she was a flower to him, in some ways just a woman to
him. He needed a woman to content him.</p>

<p>The power she had in her sometimes over him was not important to
him, that was only a joke to him, what was real in her to him was
that sometimes she was a flower to him and mostly she was just a
woman to content him.</p>

<p>Often she was not important to him and this will come out in
him, in her living there with him in the ten acre place away from
the living that was her natural way of being.</p>

<p>David Hersland had his way of needing a woman to content him.
Each man has in some ways his own need in a woman to content him,
there are many kinds of men and women and each one of them is
himself inside him. David Hersland had his way of needing a woman
to content him, Henry Dehning had his woman and she filled up his
need in him, and then they will come to be old men and it will be
easier to see in them then how they need a woman to content
them.</p>

<p>There are not so very many kinds of men nor so many kinds of
women to content them. One can see this clearer in them when the
men are young men, or very old ones, then it comes to be clearer in
them that they need a woman to content them a woman to be a certain
thing to them and that there are not so many different kinds of
them, neither of the men, nor of the women who content them. There
are though, all the same, a fair amount of different kinds of them
and here we begin with one kind of them, with David Hersland and
the kind of man he was inside him and the kind of woman he could
find to be contenting to him.</p>

<p>David Hersland and Herman Dehning and the man who was married to
David's sister Martha who made his marriage for him were all three
of them strong men and all three of them needed women to content
them and all three of them were very different each one of them
from the others of them. Now to begin again with David Hersland and
the nature he had in him. As I was saying David Hersland was a big
man and a man who was all full up inside him and who was very
uneven inside him uneven as the world that was all him. He was a
big man and there was very much in him and of him. He was all full
up inside him. There was not much of any way that anything could
enter into him. A woman had to be a part of the inside in him to
content him. She had to have a power in her, to give to him a
feeling, or she had to be appealing and so to be a part of the
feeling he had inside him. There was not much of any way that
anything outside him could enter into him.</p>

<p>A woman to content him could never be outside him, she could
never be an ideal to him, she could never have in her a real power
for him With men, outside him, there was for him a need in him to
fight with them. A woman could never be for him anything outside
him, unless as one who could in a practical way be useful to him as
his sister Martha had always been and now she had been useful to
him and made a marriage for him, had found a wife for him who was
pleasing to him, who had come out with him to Gossols to content
him. Such a woman as his sister was for him, was like any other
object in the world around him, a thing useful to him or not
existing for him, like a chair in his house to sit in or the engine
that drew the train the direction in which he needed just then to
be going. Such a woman as his sister Martha, as a woman could never
be interesting to him, nor any other woman who remained outside
him, either when she could be to him an ideal for him or a power in
any way over him, not that some women with power in them were not
attractive to him, but with such a kind of woman, and he met them
often in his living and they had power with him, such a woman
always did it for him by entering into him by brilliant seductive
managing and so she was a part of him, even though she was apart
from him, and so she had power with him. Such a one until he would
be an old man and the strength in him was weakening and the things
he had in him did not make inside him a completely tight filling
and so things outside him could a little more enter into him, until
he would come to be an old man and the need in him would come to be
more a senile feeling, an old man's need of something to complete
him, such a one could never come to be a wife to him, could never
be a woman to be his wife and content him. He needed such a woman
as his sister Martha had found for him, a woman who was to him,
inside him and appealing, whose power over him was never more than
a joke to him, who sometimes when a sense for beauty stirred in him
was a flower to him, whom he often could forget that she was
existing, who never in any big way was resisting, and so she never
needed fighting, was always to himself a part of him and inside in
him, and so in every kind of way she was contenting to him.</p>

<p>Men outside him awoke in him, a need almost always in him, to
fight with them. Women could never give him any such feeling to
have inside him. If they had a power in them, he would brush them
away from around him, sometimes with men outside him he would in
the same way brush them away from before him, but they often then
would be stubborn things around him, he could not brush them away
from him; but all women to him, if he needed to brush them away
from around him, he could so always rid himself of them. If a woman
held her power in him it was because of brilliant seductive
managing, and so there would not be aroused in him any desire of
fighting nor of brushing her away from him. His wife was different
to him, she was appealing there inside him like a tender feeling he
had in him. Often she was not important to him, often she was not
even existing to him. Sometimes, and this was the rarest thing in
him, she filled for him a need to have a sense of beauty in him,
then she was like a flower to him, but this did not happen so very
often in him more often she had a kind of power over him that was
only a joke to him, mostly in their daily living the power she had
in her with him did not to himself touch him, it was her managing
to have things for the children, to have her way in small things,
sometimes in a big one, but these things never were important to
him, and he never knew she felt a power in them, the only power he
knew she felt over him was only a joke to him, it could never have
any other meaning to him, and that was all there was of the effect
she had upon him. Mostly she was pleasing to him, she was a wife
who was suited to him, his sister Martha had been right to choose
her for him to be married to him, to bear children for him, to go
to Gossols with him, to be always, all the years she would be
living with him, to be a woman to content him. He did not need now
when he was still a vigorous man and strong in his living, he did
not need to have a woman to complete him, he needed a woman only to
be pleasing, he needed a woman only to content him. This perhaps
would come to be different in him when he would be an old man and
weakening, then perhaps a woman who had power in her for him, a
power to hold him by seductive managing, such a woman could then
fill up in him empty places made by old age and his weakening and
his shrinking away from the outside of him, and he would feel it
good to him then to be filled up once more inside him; to feel warm
with a full feeling; and so such a woman then could have power with
him, he would need such a one then to complete him. Now he was a
strong man and vigorous in his living and such a woman could arouse
him but he would not need to have her in him and he would, when she
was too much with him, for he met her often enough in his living,
he would brush her away from before him. His wife Fanny Hersland
was the woman for him, the wife who was almost always pleasing to
him, the one he wanted to content him, she was for him mostly like
a tender feeling in him, she was a good woman to him, and useful to
do the daily living with him, with the people around them, and with
their three children, she was a good woman in his daily living, the
little power she had in her for him was a pleasant joke always to
him, the power she had in managing to do things for the children he
never noticed as a power she had with him, mostly she was always
pleasing to him, sometimes, and this was the rarest thing in him,
she filled for him a need in him for pure beauty and then she would
be like a flower to him but this came to be more and more rare in
him as he grew older and was more filled up with his impatient
feeling, then she was hardly enough to content him, always she was
like a tender feeling in him but more and more as he was full of
impatient feeling, she would be lost to him, mostly she would not
then be existing for him, the power which was always a pleasant
joke to him then had no more existence for him, a little yet
sometimes then she might be a flower to him, always when he felt
her then she would be inside him like a tender feeling but mostly
then she had no existence for him, she was not enough then to
content him, and then she died away and left him, and then the
tender feeling was a pain in him, and then she was never any longer
an existing thing inside him. More and more he was getting older
then and weakening, and shrinking away from the outside of him and
more and more then he had not enough even of impatient feeling to
completely fill him, and so more and more then be needed to be
filled up inside him and she was not then enough to fill him, she
had, too, died away and left him, and soon she was not in him any
more, not any more as a tender feeling in him, she had soon then
not any more any existence in him, soon he needed much more than
she had ever been, to fill him up inside in him. All this will come
to be clear in him in his later living, and now there is the
beginning, the three children, the ten acre place where they were
living, this father and this mother of them and the dependents and
the people living there around them.</p>

<p>They were living, the father and the mother and the three
children, there had been two other children but they had died in
the beginning, they were living then the five of them and the
servants and governesses and dependents they had with them, in the
ten acre place in that part of Gossols where no other rich people
were living. Here they lived a life that was not the natural way of
being for them here they had around them only, for them, poor queer
kind of people and these came to be for them all the people they
had in their daily living. More and more there was no visiting for
them with the richer people who were the natural people for them to
have as friends around them. The father spent his days with rich
men for he had his business with them, he was making his great
fortune among them, but more and more his wife lived with the
poorer people who were living right around them, more and more his
wife in her daily living had all of her being in her relation to
the servants seamstresses governesses with whom she was living and
she was always of them and always was above them and in the same
way she was with them the poor, for her, queer people around them.
She was with them and with her husband and her children and these
were every day the whole of her daily being, sometimes as I have
said, she went visiting with her children dressed in her rich
simple clothing, but the children were awkward with the richer
living in houses and people different from their daily living and
more and more then there was not for any of them any visiting to
the part of Gossols where the richer people were living.</p>

<p>Living in this ten acre place in that part of Gossols where no
other rich people were living was very joyous for all five of them
in the beginning. There was much pleasure in this living by
themselves with all the freedom that ten acres could give them, all
the freedom that was natural with the living with only, for them,
poor queer kind of people around them. There was freedom in such a
living, there was an important feeling in it for the mother of
them, it was a life to develop in the three children anything of an
important feeling that it was possible they could ever come to have
inside in them. This with the father's way of educating all three
of them made for them, each one of them, an important feeling
inside in them that they never could lose in their later living.
This education that he gave them came from the feeling he had that
education was all there was of living for them, it came to be queer
for them because there was in him such a strong way of beginning,
because he had strong beliefs in him and often these were changing,
because he was like the world which was in his feeling all him he
was full up inside in him he was uneven inside in him, because he
was already then very full of impatient feeling and more and more
in his living he became more full of impatient feeling until when
troubles began with him before there was the weakening of old age
in him he was all full up with impatient feeling, then that was
nearly all that there was in him, that was the end of him before
old age began in him and this is the history of him.</p>

<p>It was very joyous for all of them the days of the beginning of
their living in the ten acre place which was for many years to be a
home to them in that part of Gossols where no other rich people
were living. The sun was always shining for them, for years after
to all three of the children, Sunday meant sunshine and pleasant
lying on the grass with a gentle wind blowing and the grass and
flowers smelling, it meant good eating, and pleasant walking, it
meant freedom and the joy of mere existing, it meant the pungent
smell of cooking, it meant the full satisfied sense of being
stuffed up with eating, it meant sunshine and joking, it meant
laughing and fooling, it meant warm evenings and running, and in
the winter that had its joys too of indoor living and outside the
wind would be blowing and the owls in the walls scaring you with
their tumbling.</p>

<p>There was freedom and pleasure in this living for all five of
them in the beginning, in the ten acre place in that part of
Gossols where no other rich people were living, where there were
around them only, for them, poor, queer kind of people for all of
them to have in their daily living. There were then the three
children, Martha, Alfred and David, there was the father of them
and they all three of them more and more had a fear in them of him
and all of them more and more mostly were in opposition to him.
There was the mother of them and she was never very important to
any one of them, she was not as important to any one of them as she
was to the father of them for the little power she had in her was
always a pleasant joke to him. Then there were the servants, the
governesses and the dependents and the people who lived near them,
who soon were all that the three of them had as people to be in
their daily living.</p>

<p>The occasional visiting to the part of Gossols where the richer
people were living had never much of reality to them. It was a kind
of a dream world to them between waking and sleeping as one often
has it in them when one is not certain whether something has really
happened then. Such an inbetween existing which is not waking or
sleeping was all that such richer living was for the three of them.
It never was such an unreal thing for the mother of them. To her
rich living was all that there was of real being, she never really
knew that she was no longer part of such living. She felt herself
always to be of well to do living which was all that there was of
being in her thinking. The important feeling of herself inside her
which came to her from the living which was not the kind of living
that was natural to her to be leading never was conscious to her as
being inside her, never was conscious in her as different from the
kind of living that had been natural to her. But it did make of her
a different creature and this she was inside her though she never
came to know it in her. Visiting with their mother came to be
harder for all three of them when they were beginning to be self
conscious and a little older. When they were very little ones six
years and younger there was a little pleasure in visiting with
their mother. Then it began to be harder, they would shrink behind
the mother, they got a little pleasure from the smell of fur and
silk that they got as they shrank closer to her, they got a little
pleasure from the smell of beaver that they had from the best hats
they wore when they went with her but that was all there was of
pleasure, more and more as they grew older they almost hated the
people who lived in that part of Gossols where people were richer,
where they were made by them, these children and the mothers of
them, where they were made by them to have discomfort by their not
knowing how to act when they came together. So more and more they
would not go with their mother. More and more the mother lost all
interest that she once had in her with the people who were the
natural people for her to have in her daily living in the well to
do living which was the natural way of being for her. It never came
to be in her that she knew it inside her that she was different
from the others who were the natural people for her to have around
her, she stopped going to visit them for they ceased to have any
interest for her but she never knew any of these things inside her.
Later when once she went back to Bridgepoint it was this that made
a kind of princess of her, gave her a kind of power with the
brothers and the sisters who had never left the life that was the
natural way of living for her.</p>

<p>The mother never knew it of them that her children were not
comfortable with well to do children and the mothers of them
because of the living that was not the natural way of living for
them. It never could come to be a real thing to her that she was
cut off from the right rich living. This was to her only that her
children were shy in meeting other children, her children were
never part of her important feeling, they were outside her in their
realler being, they were almost all there was of her in their daily
living.</p>

<p>Later they were further apart from her, she was a little one and
she was lost to herself and they were away from her inside her,
then she had a scared feeling in her, then they sometimes would be
good to her. Now when she was younger and the important feeling was
beginning to form in her they were of her as if they were still
inside her, they were apart from her for they were never any part
of the important feeling that was now beginning to come together
inside her.</p>

<p>In that part of Gossols where no other richer people were living
there was a straggling population, half as if it were in the
country that they were living, half with a kind of city feeling.
The Herslands had all of them inside them this half and half
feeling. With the father it was not a half and half feeling. His
country life was just a place to him for resting, sleeping, eating,
thinking. His wife had her half and half feeling. Here was all
there was to her of real every day living, here there was nothing
to her of the kind of living that was her natural way of being. It
never could come to her that she was not still part of the right
well to do city living. To the three children it was a half and
half being just as it was for all the people they knew, all those
who lived near them, they were all country people a little in their
actual living it was a small country town of them, they were city
people in their feeling. This mixture in all of them, in all the
people who lived around them, in the three children Martha, Alfred
and David, in a different way in the mother of them, in a kind of
way with her in the servants and the governess who were in the
house with them, in his own way in the father of them, made their
own life inside them to be different, the children and the people
who lived near them, from the mother and the servants and the
governesses who lived in the house with them, from the father who
all the day lived with the rich men who were the people to have
around him in his making his big fortune. It was then slowly coming
to be true of them that the children were more entirely of them,
the poorer people who lived around them, than they were of their
mother then, than their mother was of them then though they were
all that there was of their mother's daily living. Slowly in the
mother the important feeling that later when she went to
Bridgepoint where her family had gone on with their natural way of
living, made her a kind of princess to them, beautiful and rich to
them and apart from them, slowly this important feeling came to be
working inside her and in a way in her it was like the important
feeling that the governess and other servants had who were around
her, it was different from the feeling the children had from their
being part of the being that they had in common with the poorer
people with whom they were living, different from the father and
his beginning, his big fortune, then his impatient feeling and in
his old age his weakening and his needing things to fill him. The
children all three of them being a real part of the living of the
poorer people who were around them had the same kind of half and
half feeling that the people had around them, they had the living
that was a country town living, they had the feeling that was a
city feeling and only later in their living did they grow away from
being of the people who lived there around them. Each one of them
had his own way of such changing and this will come out in the
character of them as each one of them shows it in them.</p>

<p>As I was saying the mother's half and half feeling was different
from the half and half feeling that the children had in them which
was the same kind of half and half feeling that the people all had
who lived around them, it was different from the feeling her
husband had in him.</p>

<p>The being the people around them had in them, the half country
town feeling and half city ways they all had in them could never
come to be in common with them to the mother of the three children
who had the same feeling in them as the people around them had in
them. It could never come to the mother of the three of them to
feel it to be real inside them the being that was in them that they
had in common with the people around them. It would never come to
the mother of them to feel this in them, they were her children,
they were, to her feeling, inside in her as they had been when she
had born them, they were apart from her in their real being, they
were a real part of the living around them and they had in them a
half and half feeling like the people around them.</p>

<p>To the mother of them they were to the people around them as she
was to them, of them and above them in her right well to do city
being, it never could come to her to feel that the three children
who were to her feeling inside in her as they had been when she
bore them were in all their being all in common with the life they
were daily leading with all of them who were there around them.
Such a thing could never come to be real to her feeling; it never
can come to be real to a governess in her feeling to feel the
servant's feeling to be the same as her real feeling from the way
she lives in the house with them. The mother to the three children
of them could never have it to be real to her feeling what was
really in their being that they were like those they had around
them in the daily living that was all there was of being in them;
the governess to the servants being in the same house with them she
could never feel it to be real to them in their feeling that they
feel it to be together with them to them the governess and then
with the mistress of them; the governess to the servants, the
servants to the governess who lives in the same house with them,
all of them and the mistress of them to the people, the, for them,
poor queer kind of people who lived around them. They were for all
of them poor queer kind of people who lived in little houses near
them. They were many of them. They were different each one of them
from all the others of them, the three children knew these
differences in them for they were of them, they were together with
them, to the mother the governess the servants who lived in this
ten acre place with these people around them, the differences among
them were not to them differences as they were to the three
children who were of them, so one sees them and it is as the
children know them, as they were really inside them as they were to
the others of them among them. More and more it will come out in
them the differences in all of them with the three young ones who
are of them then, these as they find it to be true among them, in
them whom they needed to be friends for them of the people around
them, these who were different to them each one of them to them who
were of them, and then there is the mother of the three of them and
the governess and the servants and then the father of the three of
them and some ways in which he was of all of them, of the people
around them, and then in some ways he was not of them, but mostly
there was everything in some way in him, mostly all the world was
in him and it was all uneven in him as it is in all the world that
made him, and more and more now it came to be in him that mostly he
was filled up with impatient feeling, more and more then it came
that his children were in opposition to him, more and more then his
wife was not existent for him, then he needed things to fill him
but this was all the later living for him, now he was just
beginning with his impatient feeling, now he was as big as all the
world around him, he was it and there was not any difference in him
to the people around him. In his children there was already then a
little of such a beginning, they were already then a little not all
of him, a little outside from him, not to arouse fighting in him,
not to arouse him to brush them away from him, just to be there and
not be him and he would soon a little begin to know this in him.
More and more the three of them Martha Alfred and David were really
of them the poorer people they had in their daily living, the half
country town being they had in them the half completely city
feeling that there was in all of them. There were many kinds of
people there living in little houses near them, some of them living
well in a poor way there around them some living in a straggling
kind of way near them, all of them were in some way part of the
daily living of all of them the three children and the mother of
them, all of them were more or less part of the real being of the
children then, never really part of the real being of the mother of
them; always her real being which was not her important feeling,
always her real being as she felt herself existing was the daily
living with the three children as if they were still inside her and
not apart from her and the well to do city living which was all
there was of right being to her feeling. From her children she
never came to have real important feeling of herself inside her,
this could come to her from the Shilling family, a little from her
husband as she felt toward him a little power, mostly from the
servants and governesses who lived in the house with her, a little
from the poorer people who lived near her.</p>

<p>There were many kinds of people then living around them. More
and more the children came to know them, to be really a part of
them to have the same being with them to have inside them the same
half and half feeling, half country town feeling and half
altogether a city feeling. Some of them were sometimes working for
them, dress-making carpentering shoe-mending, odd jobs were done by
some of them. These and the children of them were for the three
Hersland children then nearly all there was of real being in them,
Some of these came very close inside to them. For each one of the
three of them Martha Alfred and David it was different ones among
those who were around them who came close to them, with all of them
there was changing and this will be a history of each one of
them.</p>

<p>The household the mother father the three children of them, the
governess and servants with them, they were all, all of them
together then. More and more then it was then slowly coming to be
true of them that the children were more entirety of them, the
poorer people who lived around them, than they were of their mother
then; they were neither of the mother or of the feeling she had in
herself then, nor of the way she felt herself then as being of the
living that was all there was of right being to her. They were all
three of them then more entirely of them, the poorer people who
lived around them then than they were of their mother then, than
their mother was of them, though they were all there was of their
mother's daily living then.</p>

<p>They were very many of them then the poorer people who were
living around them, there were very many of them then and they were
all of them in each one of them then different from all the others
of them and this all three of the children knew very well inside
them. They were a part of them, they were always together with
them. The servants and the governess were to them as the mother was
for them, the father gave a different feeling in them and this will
be clearer for them as slowly the character in each one of them
comes out from inside him.</p>

<p>There were many people living in small houses around them. Some
of them were families of women, some of them were made up of some
good ones and some who were not good to earn a living, there were
families where it was a little hard to understand how they were
living, nobody did any working, nobody had money that belonged to
them. In some of the families around them there was a father who
was really not very existing, no one was certain that he was a
husband of the woman and the father of the children who all earned
the living, such a one would just come and eat and sleep in the
house with them, with some there was no mother and one was not very
certain from anything the father showed in him or that the children
remembered about him that there had ever been one. In one family
there was a mother and she was a hard working woman, there were
children some at home, some away from them, some about whom nothing
was very certain, the father was not very certain, he was not dead
to them he was not very certain only not very certain in his
existence for them and in all of such families no one ever asked
about the things around them, and no one ever talked about the
queer ways anybody else had in him. All that was existing for any
of them were the things that happened to them.</p>

<p>In several of the families around them the father or a son had
mysterious things he was doing every day in his earning of his
living then. Mostly there was nothing bad in any of them, one of
them had an intelligence office where he was working, none of his
family ever liked to talk about him, it is often so with the work
men do to earn a living, there is nothing bad about them, there is
nothing in the work that is wrong that gives a reason why they
should not do it then to earn their living, they do it every day
and earn a living then but somehow it is a feeling the family have
about him that they never talk as if he were of them. Sometimes it
is from the work he is doing, sometimes from the ways he has in
him, mostly there is nothing wrong in him, there is nothing bad in
his earning of a living, somehow it is not natural to his family to
talk about him, to act as if he were a part of their daily living,
he eats with them, he sleeps there with them, that is all that
makes him then a part of them. Mostly in the little houses in the
part of the town where no rich people are living the families many
of them have such kind of mysteries in them. No one ever talks
about them. No one is ever certain with them how many children
there are of them, what some of them do to make a living, whether
there is a father to them, whether there is a mother to them, how
they all come to the money they have for their daily living.</p>

<p>The three Hersland children were of them, they were always of
the people with the people who lived in the small houses near them,
they were of them, they lived with them, they had the feeling of
never asking any questions of them, they had it in them to never
ask any questions about any of them, they had never any feeling to
know anything about any of them that was not shown then in the
daily living, no one of such people as they knew there around them
ever asked such questions of any other one of them. Each one in a
family then and every family of them together then always lived on
in their daily living, there was a husband or a father to them or
there was none, there was a mother or a wife to them or there was
none, there were more sons or less of them, there were more
daughters or less of them, no one ever asked any such question of
them, no one asked what they did for their daily living, sometimes
some of them would be gone a long time away from all of them,
sometimes he would be rich then, sometimes he would come home then
and be a hero to them, always there were uncertain things in any
one of them to all of them and no one thought about them, no one
knew them as uncertain things about any other one of them, no one
ever asked any other one any question about them, mostly every one
had it as right for him that each one of them should have a little
house where his family was living, each family of them had a little
house where any one of them and all of them did their eating and
sleeping and washing, each one of them had his own way of earning a
living, such uncertain things as each one of the families of them
had in them are always there in all of them who are living then in
the part of a city where no rich people are living, no one of them
ever thinks about them, there is nothing for any of them except the
things that happen every day to them, there is nothing for them
except their daily living which is all there is then of them.</p>

<p>All of them who lived near the ten acre place where the
Herslands were living in that part of Gossols where no rich people
were living all of them then were good enough people and regular
enough in their daily living and mostly all of the families of them
had lived a long enough time where they were living then. Mostly
all of them were honest enough men and women, mostly among them
there were not any bad men and women. Mostly they were honest
enough working men and women and their children went to school and
went on to be decent enough men and women to go on living as their
families always had been living. As I have just been saying there
were not very many of them that were not good enough men and women.
A few of them came to a bad end before they got through with their
living but mostly all of them were honest enough men and women and
they had good enough children and mostly they all made enough by
working to keep on and be honest enough in their daily living.</p>

<p>As I was saying they were very different each one of them from
the others of them, each family of them from all the other families
of them. A great many of them had a little of an uncertain side to
them, mostly in every family of them some of them had an uncertain
something in them but perhaps the rest understood it about them,
none of them ever spoke about them no one ever said it of them that
they had uncertain things in them, perhaps it was all a natural way
of being. Each one of them went on with his living and whatever
came to any one of them was the natural way of living. It is queer
in them in the families like them, the uncertain ways some of them
seem to have always inside them. Perhaps it is all simple in them,
mostly in all of these who lived around the Hersland family then,
there was nothing that was wrong about them. Mostly they were all
honest enough and good enough men and women with decent enough
children.</p>

<p>There were many families of them. There was one family of them
that was a family of women then, there was a father to them and he
was not dead then or living away from them but mostly then it was
as far as one could know them a family of women, a mother and there
were three daughters then Anna and Cora and Bertha. There was a
father of them, there was a husband to the mother of them, he was
regularly with them in his eating and sleeping then, one saw him
but somehow he was not really existing, he went every day to his
working but that never made him any more of a real being. He went
every day to his working, he came home to his eating and sleeping,
he was regular in his living, he was regular in his working, he was
not very real in existing. Many men and sometimes there is a woman
and sometimes there are children of them, have such a way in them,
they have such an uncertain feeling coming out from them, they are
not real in existing.</p>

<p>The man then, the father of the three of them the husband of the
woman then, was not existing for them, he used the little house
with them for eating sleeping and washing, he went every day to his
working. He was not existing for any of them, he was not existing
for the Hersland family who were living in the ten acre place then
near them neither for Mrs. Hersland and the three children then nor
for the governesses and servants of them. With the father David
Hersland, there was in him a little more of real existing, there
was in him then that he was a man to feel it in him when another
man spoke to him, when another man spoke as a master to him or as
just a man to know him; there was then in him a feeling of being a
male thing then when Mr. Hersland met him. There would be a
greeting between them when this one met with him, when Mr. Hersland
came home from his day in the part of Gossols where the richer
people were living, when he met him walking, when he met him coming
home carrying something he had just been buying, there was in the
man the being that made him speak to another man when he met him,
there was in him a being that made the meeting with another man
give to him almost a real existence in him, there was in him just
such a little being so that he could give to another man a
greeting, could so get into him a real being from the meeting he
had then with a man in giving him a greeting; there was in him, in
such a kind of man and there are very many of them and they need
men to give to them a feeling of existence in them, there was in
this man just enough of a kind of being in him that always could
make it certain that he was an object real in being, an object
called man not woman the world around him then, and there are many
of them and as far as any one can know such a one then that is all
then that there is of him, perhaps there is more to him to the
woman who is a wife to him or to his children who live in the house
where he is living, perhaps there is a real existing to him but to
all of those around him, to the Hersland family and the others who
lived with them there was never in him any real existing, there was
for all of them in the house where this man was living only a
family of women, a mother and three daughters of them. There was
nothing wrong about him, anybody could see in him that he was a man
and there are many of them made just like him, there is nothing
wrong inside them, there is nothing very strong of existence in
them, there is nothing wrong inside them, it is only that there is
not very much of existence in them, there is a little in them, they
are men when other men are with them, they are men when they are
alone then, only then it is not very strong inside them, they are
men then, they are alone then, existence is not very strong in them
then, there is just enough of such existence in them then that one
can know them that they are men then when one thinks of them, one
does not then when they are alone then ever think about them ever
feel any existence in them.</p>

<p>With other men around them, existence in them gets to be a
little stronger inside them, they come almost to feel themselves to
be inside in them, there gets to be almost enough inside them of
existence to make them then have other men feel that they really do
exist then, but mostly in them there is not enough of existence to
them to make women and children feel that they are really men
inside them, men and having real existence in them, it is only when
other men meet with them that the existence gets to be strong
enough in them so that any one can know them and they can feel it
in them that they are men and one with all the men around them,
when they are alone with women or with children they have never in
them anything of such a feeling, they have then nothing of real
being, they go every day to their working, they come home to their
eating and their sleeping, there is nothing wrong inside them,
there is only nothing in them of real existence to them, it takes
other men around them, it needs other men inside them, it takes
other men to greet them, it takes other men around them to make of
them a real being to be inside them and so it was with this one and
there are many made just like him, and so this family then, it was
to almost all who knew them a family of women then, the mother and
three daughters of them Anna and Cora and Bertha then.</p>

<p>The mother's face was old now and a little wooden. She did
dressmaking. She sometimes worked for the rich family near them,
for Mrs. Hersland and her children. She was getting old now and a
little wooden.</p>

<p>She was a foreign woman. No one knew it about him the husband
who lived in the house with them whether he was or was not a
foreign man. She was a foreign woman and she was a little old now
and her face was a little wooden. She was a hard-working woman, she
did dress-making, she earned a good enough living, they were doing
very well with their living all of them then. The mother was a
foreign woman, she had it in her to be really existing. She was
existing for all five of them the Hersland family who knew her
then, she was existing for her children, she was existing for all
of them who lived in the houses near them, for all the people who
ever came to know them, she was not important to them but she had
in her a character for them.</p>

<p>The mother had existence in her in this she was different from
the man who was a husband to her. She had existence in her, there
was real existence to her, more than just enough to know she was a
woman creature, she had existence in her, she had a character to
her but she had nothing that was important in her, she was not
important to any one around her she was not important to the three
daughters who were then with her, in a way she was not important to
the man who was a husband to her.</p>

<p>There was no past or present in her, there was existence in her,
there was a character to her but there was nothing important inside
her, there was nothing past or present or in the future that would
be connected to her, but she had existence enough to make of her a
really existent thing inside her, existence was strong in her in
every moment in her, strong enough to make it to be real inside
her, she did not need others around her to make existence inside
her.</p>

<p>There was nothing connected in her with a past or present or
future, there was existence in her, there was a character to her,
she had no importance then to any one around her, she had the
existence of the useful things around her, it was active in her
this existence inside her, it was active in her and this gave a
character to her, it was active in her and this was real existence
inside her, this made every one who knew her know there was real
existence to her, she had real existence in her but she had no
importance inside her, there was nothing in her to connect her to a
past a present or a future, there was real existence to her, she
did not need others around her to make for her the existence she
had inside her, they did not make it any stronger others who were
around her the existence she had inside her, that was real in her,
that was the character in her, that was all that there was of her,
there was not in her anything to connect her with the past or
present or future, there was real existence to her, that was the
whole of her, she had no importance in her to any one of all who
knew her.</p>

<p>As I was saying of her she was getting older now and her face
and the body of her gave a wooden look to her.</p>

<p>There was nothing in her to connect her with the past the
present or the future, there was not any history of her. They were
three daughters to her and they then lived altogether, the mother
the man who was a husband to her and the three girls Anna, Cora and
Bertha. The only thing that could ever give to any one who knew her
the mother of the three of them Anna, Cora and Bertha, the only
thing that could ever give to any one who knew her a history of her
was as they would see it in the history of each one of the three
girls who had been once inside her, not of her then, though they
were then inside her. The history of each one of them would never
make a history for her, the three of them and each one of them made
it that one could know about her the history of her. The history
they each one of them went through before her as they went through
their living and they were the daughters of her, was the history of
her who had once had them inside her, once she must have gone
through the changes that each one of them went through as they
lived longer, there was no history in her, they never made any
history for her, the history of them as they went on in their
changing around her, each girl repeating in her in the changes that
went on in each one inside in her was the repeating around her what
once had been changes in her, they were not for her the history of
her, they were not for her any past or present or future, there was
not in her anything of history inside her, there was not in her any
importance to her, there was not in her anything to hold her
together with the three girls around her who went through their
changes in front of her the three girls who once had been inside
her, there was not in her any history of her, there was not in her
any importance to her, there was in her real existence inside her,
there was in her a character of her and that was all that was then
her, that was all then that was ever in her, there was never any
history in her, there was a history of her and that the three girls
were living around her, they were having the changes she had had in
her and now she was getting older and her face and body was getting
to be wooden all through her and existence was always just the same
in her, it was all there was of her.</p>

<p>The three girls Anna and Cora and Bertha went through the
changes then and they were living then altogether, they went
through their changes, the changes she had had in her, first they
were in Anna then in Cora and then in Bertha and they were never to
the mother a history of her, they were never to her a history
inside her, there was never in her any connection inside her with a
past or present or a future, these changes in the girls with her
were like all the objects around her, like the making of dresses to
her, like the changing of the eating from the green stuff they
brought to her, through the cooking that was natural for her to the
eating that came after, this was all to her like the changes in
Anna and Cora and Bertha, they never made a history for her, they
were not to her a history of her, they were the changes around her,
and first it was in Anna then in Cora then in Bertha, each one of
them had been once inside her, that was not a history to her, they
were changing then around her, that, was not history of her in her,
she was getting older now and looking wooden, that did not change
in her the existence inside her, that was a change like all the
others in her, that was not any more of a history to her, existence
was always just the same inside her and it would always be so in
her until she died and that would be one more change of her, it
would not be a change to her and so it was now with the girls
around her, they went through their changes before her, they were
not a history to her they were not for her a history of her, they
were three daughters with her, they went through their changes one
after another, they lived there in the small house all together she
and the man who was a husband to her and the three girls who each
one once had been inside her, and that was not a history to her,
that was like all the other changes in her, that was like eating
and dressmaking for her and so she had existence in her and she
always worked hard and had a character in her and she never had
importance for any one around her. She had existence in her like
the useful things around her, she had character, she had had
changes in her and now she was getting older and there was a little
more wooden change inside her and so there would be changes in her
until she would be all through with all the changes she had in her
and always there would be real existence to her and always there
would be character to her always there would never be a past or
present or a future connected with her, always there would be
existence in her, there would be changes, there would never be any
history of her to her. The eldest daughter of them Anna had come
then to be a rather beautiful woman. No one thought it about them
that all three of them would have that as a change in them. No one
thought it about her the mother of them that she had had once a
change in her like this change in them before she had borne any one
of them. The eldest one had beauty then, now when she was grown to
be a woman, all three of them one after the other came to have in
them as one of the changes that went through them, beauty in them
when they were not any longer children. Not one of the three of
them had any signs in them of such a thing going to happen to them
until it had happened in them. The one of them, to any one who
began at any time to know them, the one of them who had come to be
a woman then and to have this change into beauty which happened to
each one of them, had it that this had already happened to her
then, to any one who came then to know them it was a fact then that
this one was a beautiful woman but this never made any connection
for them to the other or other ones who had not had the change in
them, the beauty in the one that had it then was like existence in
the mother of them, it was in them one after the other of them as
if it had always been in them, it had no connection in them with a
past or future in them, it had no connection in them to any other
changes that had been or could come to them, it had no connection
with the others of them who were then with or without beauty in
them, it had no connection with the mother of them, with the change
she once had which was like the change in each one of them but
nothing made any connection between any of them, to the mother of
them, nor to the father of them for he had not any real existence
in him to any one of them.</p>

<p>The change then came in each one of them and now it was Anna the
eldest of them that was a beautiful woman to everybody around them
then. The beauty in her then to any one who came to know all of
them was, as beauty came to be in each one of them, a thing that
when it was in any one of them then, was to any one who knew them
then, something that was always in them always to be in them,
always had been in them, in the others of them then there was not
any sign of any such a change ever to be in them, in the mother of
them there was nothing then that connected her with any such a
change in them, there was nothing in her then to connect her with
that one or with them, when there were more of them that had then
this change in them, there was nothing in her that made it true for
any one who knew her then that she had had in her any such change
to connect her with that one or with them who had it then, that she
had had it in her before she had borne them. How any one knew it
about them that the mother had had such a change in her before
them, how any one knew it about them that the others of them would
have such a change in them, that, no one who knew them could ever
answer in them. Perhaps it was the existence the mother had inside
her for all of them, perhaps it was this that gave to every one who
knew them no feeling of surprise in them that each one of them and
the mother before them had, were having and were to have such
changes in them, there was not anything to connect them together
then except the existence in the mother of them, existence that was
real in her for every one who came to know them, that never made
her important to them but that made her a real thing to them, and
this was what made it natural that all of them should go through,
each one of them, the changes in them that every one of them had in
them, this is what never made one think it about them that they
would have such changes in them, that is what never made it a
surprise to any one of them that they had such changes in them, it
was the existence in the mother of them, this is what made real the
changes in them to every one that knew them. The existence in the
mother of them is what made the change that was then in any one of
them a final thing in each one of them, and the mother of them, to
any one who knew them then. The existence in the mother of them, at
the time then when one knew them, made it, the change that was then
them, to every one who knew them then, a thing that was forever in
them, it was the existence that the mother of them had in her then
that made whatever was in them to any one who knew them as if it
were everlasting. The mother had existence in her, she had no
importance to her, there had been there would be changes in her but
this never made any history for her, there was nothing in her to
connect her with a past a present or a future, there was nothing in
her to connect her with the changes in the daughters around her, to
connect her with the man who was a husband to her, there was
existence in her, there was no importance to her, there was no
history in her for her, there was no history of her to her in the
changes in the daughters there around her. In the eldest daughter
Anna there, was more of importance inside her than there was in the
mother of her, than there was in the sisters who went through their
changes later, than there was in her father who lived in the house
with her.</p>

<p>In her there was not so much existence inside her as there was
in the mother but there was more of importance to herself inside
her, she was more important to every one who knew her, there was
more of her in the things that happened to her, she was more
important to the things that happened to her than her mother had
ever been in all the living she had had all her life in her. Anna
had inside her more importance in her, more than in her mother,
more like that in her father, but with her there was real existence
inside her, not so much existence as there was in the mother but
existence enough to make alive the feeling of importance to herself
inside her, enough to make others feel her, enough to make her
important to every one that knew her. Anna had in her real
existence to her, not so much as in her mother but enough to the
making her living inside in her, she was important to herself
inside from her own power in her, she was important to herself
inside her as her father was when he was with other men around him
to make him to be real inside him, when the father had men around
him then there was in him a feeling of importance in him as a man
among them and he was important to them then to his feeling, but
really, in him there was no existing, it took other men around him
to make him alive inside him, he had no existence in him. In the
mother of them there was always strong existing but there was never
anything of an important feeling, she was always existing, she was
not important in her being, she was not any more existing with
others who came near her in her living than she was when she was
alone with her being, she was always existing, she was never
important in her feeling, she was never important to any one who
knew them, she was like any article around them, she had strong
existence for them she was never in any way important for them, she
had not in any way in her any changes for them, she was not
important to any one of them.</p>

<p>There were three of them then Anna and Cora and Bertha. In Anna
had come the change that made a beauty of her, she had less
existence in her than the mother she had as much importance in her
as the father, she had enough existence in her to make real inside
her the important feeling she had in her. It came to her to have
things happen to her and in her, she had a career in her and later
they will come out in her the things that happened to her.</p>

<p>The second daughter Cora had in her less existence than the
mother and no important feeling in her, beauty came to her, things
happened to her, there was nothing in her that made anything
important to her. Cora went through her changes a little slower
than her sister Anna. They came in her slowly, they gave no
importance to her, there was existence in her not enough to make
her living, always, like the mother, there was not in her enough of
existence like the mother to make a solid thing of her, there was
in her a little uncertain feeling like that in the father but there
was nothing in her that gave to her a sense of being important
inside her from others being around her, others around her were as
they were to her mother they were around her and that was all the
meaning they had in her, they were around her, they did things to
her, for her, they never gave to her as they did to her father and
to her sister Anna a feeling of importance to herself inside her,
they were as they were to her mother, things around in her; in her,
existence was not strong in her as it was always in the mother and
so in her as in her father there was a little something uncertain
and not solid to her, and all this will come out in her in the
history of the Hersland family who came then more and more to know
her.</p>

<p>There were three of them Anna and Cora and Bertha; Bertha had in
her less of existence in her than any of them except the father.
Bertha had in her enough of existence in her to make her alive when
she was a little girl and there was not very much of her, she had
not in her enough of existence to her to make her alive inside her
when it came to her to be a young girl and later to have beauty in
her and to be a woman then. There was not enough to her of
existence in her to make her alive inside her when she had gone
through in her with the change of being a little girl, not very
much of her, even then she was not very living in her, she had not
very much existence in her. She had a little more existence in her
than her father, enough to make her living when there was so very
little of her, then was the only time she had enough existence in
her to make her alive inside her. No one who knew her could ever
feel that there would be changes, there was not enough existence in
her to any one who knew her to keep her alive through changes that
went through her, the changes went on in her, they went on in her
as they had done in her mother, in her sister Anna and then in her
sister Cora, they went on slowly in her, she came later to have
beauty in her, she never was very alive inside her, she never had
existence like her mother who had existence like the useful things
about her, she had not like her father importance from other people
around her, when she was a little girl she had a little of such
importance in her from the little existence that was then in her
the little existence always in her that then kept her alive for
there was then so little of her, more and more then as she grew
bigger there was not any such importance there was not in her
enough existence to make her alive inside her, and there was not
any very real living to her, she had never in her any importance
from other people around her, she was like her mother only she had
very little of existence in her, so that is the history of her, she
was alive inside her when there was very little of her when she was
a little girl and then she was alive inside her and had in her a
little of importance to herself inside her, she grew bigger and
there was never then in her any strong existence to her, there was
never in her enough importance to her to make it real in her, there
was not later an uncertain feeling to her, there was in her the
existence in her, the importance of it to her that had been in her
when she was a little girl and was alive inside her for then there
was so little of her. There was not in her later an uncertain
feeling to her as there was in her father as there was in her
sister Cora, there was in her always just the same being inside
her, when she was a woman, when she had beauty in her, there was
then inside her just the same existence in her just the same
importance inside her that there had been when she was a little
girl and there was not very much to her. She was like her mother,
the little existence she had was really there in her, she was like
her father, the little existence she had was important to her, she
was not like her mother, the little existence was never very strong
in her, she was not like her father, she could never get existence
in her she could never get importance to her from other people
around her, she had enough existence in her it was important enough
inside her to make her alive in her when she was a little girl and
there was not very much to her. There never came to be any more in
her neither of existence nor of importance in her and later when
she was bigger when she became a woman and had beauty, there was
not in her enough of existence and of importance in her to fill her
and so she was then later never very alive inside her, there was
then of her, too much, for the existence and importance inside her.
She was then, never, when she was bigger, when she was finished
with the change of being a little girl and not very much to her,
she was never after very alive inside her. And now Anna had this
change in her, she had beauty in her, Cora and Bertha were having
the changes she had already had in her, there was yet nothing in
Cora or in Bertha that could connect them with her, with the beauty
change that had come to her.</p>

<p>The three girls Anna and Cora and Bertha went through their
changes one after the other, now the beauty change had come in
Anna, now when there was no longer in her a young girl's growing
change in her beauty had come into her and to every one who knew
her it was as if it had always been in her, it had no connection in
her with her sisters Cora and Bertha nor with her mother. The
mother had strong existence in her, she was getting older and her
face and body was getting to be wooden all through her and
existence was always just the same in her, it was always all there
was of her. No one who knew them then the mother or Anna or Cora or
Bertha, ever thought about the father, and so to every one around
them then, this to every one that knew them was a family of women,
there was the mother who was getting old now and a little wooden
who was never important to any one who knew them who always had
existence in her and that was always strong inside her, that never
made any history in her, that never gave any importance to her she
was existing then and existence always had been in her as it was in
the useful things around her, there was no history in her, there
was nothing in her to connect her with the past the present or the
future, there was never any history in her there was a history of
her and that the three girls were living around her, they were
having the changes she had had in her, there was nothing then in
her to connect her with the changes in the three girls who lived in
the house with her, there was nothing in any of them that connected
themselves with the others of them, there was nothing in them to
connect them with the mother of them, there was nothing in the
changes in them that made any one who knew them ever feel in them
that she had had changes in her as the three girls had them then
the three girls who were around her then, there was nothing in any
of the three of them that made one feel in them that they would
have in them the changes that any one of the three of them had had
already in her, there was nothing to connect them with each other,
they did go through their changes one after the other, there was
never anything in any one of them to make any one who knew them
feel that there would be changes in any one of them, a little more
perhaps in Anna than in any of the others of them, in her, changes
might come, in the other two of them Cora and Bertha and in the
mother of them there was never any thing in them to make any one
who knew them think a change would come in them, the mother was
getting older now and her face and body was getting to be wooden
all through her and existence was always just the same in her, it
was always all that there was of her, Cora was a little wooden
then, girlhood was almost finished in her, beauty had not come yet
to be in her, Bertha was a little girl then, there was never in her
as much existence inside her as there was in the mother or Anna or
Cora, there was in her a little more existence than in the father,
Anna had then beauty in her and was important then to every one who
knew her, in her there was a feeling that there might come changes
in her. Nobody ever thought about the father. This family to every
one who knew them was a family of women.</p>

<p>There were many other families then living in the little houses
near the ten acre place where the Hersland family were living in
that part of Gossols where no other rich people were living, some
of them were neat and made a good living like this family of women,
some were not so well off in their living; some had a very
straggling way of living, each one of the families of them in the
small houses then had each its own way of living each its own
uncertain ways of being, and this is a history of them.</p>

<p>There were many kinds of families of them living in the little
houses near the Hersland family then. They were each one of them
different from all the others of them, they were different each one
of them from all the others of them in their way of living, in
their ways of earning a living, in the things that had been in
their lives in the earlier days of their living, in the things that
would now happen to them, they were different each one of them from
all the others of them then, they were different in all the ways
that they had in them, they were different in all the things that
made them important, in all the things that made them uncertain
inside them, they were different inside each one of them from all
the others of them in religion. Some of them then had religion in
them, some of them had not anything of such a thing in them, all of
them who had religion in them were different from all the others of
them who had religion in them too in them. One of these families
then was made up of a father and two children, a boy and a girl
Eddy and Lilly and the father of them, there were many uncertain
things about all three of them, about the living that they had had
before in them, about there not being to them a woman to be a wife
to him and a mother to the two children, about the way they had
money to live on when not any one of the three of them did any
working, about the kind of man the father was for it was very hard
to know anything about him, about the character of the two
children; one thing was certain about them, they had religion in
them, they were important in religion. The father was a tall thin
man, they said of him that he was a sick man, perhaps that was true
of him, no one knew how anybody knew that about him, his children
never said it of him, he was a tall thin blond man, he was always
smoking and that was said by every one who knew him to be because
it was good for him, he was important in religion.</p>

<p>There are many ways of being important in religion and this is a
history of some of them, there are many men and many women and some
children who have religion in them, there are many ways of having
that in them. They are some who are important in religion, they are
some who have religion and who are not important from the religion
in them, they are many men and many women and some children who
have religion in them and this is a history of some of them. There
are many of all these kinds of them, there were some of many kinds
of them in the families that the Hersland family came to know then,
more and more in their living then the Hersland children came to
know them came to know the many ways many men and many women and
some children have religion in them, the many ways some of them
have to have religion make them important inside them, the way some
of them who have religion never have any of such an important
feeling in them, more and more then they came to know in the
families that lived there around them the meaning the religion each
one of them who had religion in them meant to the one that had it
inside him, for there were many of them that had it in them many
men and many women and some of their children. This family the
father and the two children Eddy and Lilly, all three of them had
religion in them, there was no wife to him or mother to the
children then. Slowly the Hersland children came to know them. They
had it in them this man Mr. Richardson and his two children Eddy
and Lilly Richardson, they had it in them all three of them to be
important in religion, the father had always all his life had
religion in him, he always had been important in religion, this is
a history of the feeling in him, of the way his children too had it
in them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mr. Richardson was a tall thin blond man, he was
sick then, so everybody said who knew him though his children never
said it about him, he was sick then and he was always smoking and
everybody said who knew him that that was because it was good for
him, good for the sickness he had in him.</p>

<p>Any one who knew him would know that he had religion in him,
that he always had had religion in him. Always one knew it in the
two children that they had they always would have religion in them,
religion with all three of them was a part of them, it was to all
of them a part of their being, it was not a belief in them, it was
of them like eating and sleeping and washing, for all these things
and religion were part of their being, such was the nature of all
three of them. Not that all three of them had the same nature in
them, the three of them each one was very different from the other
two of them, each one had their own nature in them, but all three
had this in common that religion that eating sleeping and washing
were natural to them, other things too were natural in them and all
these things will come out more and more in the history of
them.</p>

<p>There are many men and many women and some of their children who
have at some time religion in them. There are some of all these, of
the many men and many women and some children who have religion in
them, there are many of these that have it in them as a natural
part of them, who have religion always inside them, who need
religion as they do eating and sleeping and loving and there are
very many who have religion in them so from the beginning of them,
in some of them this religion in them makes them important inside
to them, with some of them this religion in them makes them
important to every one who knows them, there are some who have
religion in them as a natural thing in them and have always had
such a thing in them and it does not give any importance to them.
There are some then who always have religion in them to whom it is
as natural as breathing, there are some who have it in them who
need it in them to complete them, there are some who have it like
eating and sleeping, some who have it like loving, some who have it
like washing, there are some who have it from a need in them to
have it fill them when they have lost something that was once a
piece in them; some get from religion an important feeling, some
have it and are important to every one who knows them, some never
have in it any kind of an important feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. Richardson and his two children had always had religion in
them, religion would always be in them like eating and sleeping and
washing, not like breathing and loving. Religion was always in
them, they had it always and it made all three of them important to
every one that knew them. To the father Mr. Richardson religion was
like eating and sleeping and washing, all these and religion made
him a continuous being, they were not outside him, they all were in
him and they made him always continue in his existing. Religion had
been in him always as a part of him, it was in him like sleeping,
it was in him like eating, it was of him like washing, it had
always been in him as a part of him, it had always made him
important to every one who knew him, it did not make him important
to himself inside him any more than eating and sleeping and washing
made him important to himself inside him, it was a part of his
continuous existing; it did always make him important to every one
who knew him.</p>

<p>To some who knew him, to some who had not any kind of religion
in them, to some this religion in him was to them like lying but
these did not understand him, there was in religion in him no more
of lying, with him, than there was in washing any more than there
was in eating or sleeping, this was very hard for some of them who
knew him, some of them who never had any religion in them, to
understand about him but always it was true of him, religion in him
was like eating and sleeping and washing, it did not make him to
himself important inside him, it made him important to everyone who
knew him, it was there and they knew it in him, it was in him and
whatever he should be ever found out in doing that would never make
it different in him that religion was real inside him, that it was
in him like his eating and sleeping and washing, that it never was,
in him, lying any more than eating and sleeping and washing were
lying. It was a part of him as they were a part of him, they were
needed every day to remake him, to keep him going on in existing,
so it was with religion and this in him made him important to every
one who knew him.</p>

<p>The religion inside him, as I was saying, kept him existing, it
was not that it filled a need in him, it was not that he used it in
his living, it kept him continuous and existing as did his eating
and sleeping. Religion was to him like eating and sleeping,
religion was to him also like washing and it was this in him, the
religion like washing that made him important to every one who knew
him. Religion was to him as eating and sleeping was in him,
religion was in him as washing was to him and this religion in him
made him important to every one who knew him.</p>

<p>Washing is very common, almost every one does some washing, with
some it is only for cleansing, with some it is a refreshing, with
some a ceremonial thing that makes them important to every one who
knows them. In those who have religion in them as washing is to
some of them who make it a distinction in them, in some who have
religion in them as washing is to some who do it as a necessary
part of their daily living, such have from it a distinction;
washing is not a natural thing to happen like eating or sleeping,
washing is not like eating or sleeping, it has in it a distinction
and to them who do it every day as a natural thing to them, they
have it in them to be important to every one who knows them, when
religion is in any one as this washing is in some who have it in
them, then such a one is important to every one who knows him.</p>

<p>Eating and sleeping are not like loving and breathing. Washing
is not like eating and sleeping. Believing is like breathing and
loving. Religion can be believing, it can be like breathing, it can
be like loving, it can be like eating or sleeping, it can be like
washing. It can be something to fill up a place when some one has
lost out of them a piece that it was natural for them to have in
them. To be continuous in existing by an every day eating and
sleeping is like what some have in religion, then it is not from a
need in them, it is from the natural way they have in them to be
continuous in their existing. Feeding and religion with such of
them is every day natural to them. Washing is different from eating
and sleeping. It is natural to some and it makes such ones
important to every one that knows them. Some have religion in them
as some have washing and they are always important to every one who
knows them. To have washing as natural to them is some distinction
to those who have it as natural in them, to have religion in them
to be in them as washing is to some, those to whom it is natural
from the beginning to have religion in them in such a way as some
have washing is to make of them who have religion in any such a way
natural to them important to every one who knows them.</p>

<p>Mr. Richardson had always had, from his beginning, religion in
him. It was always natural in him as was his eating and sleeping
and washing. He kept on this way in his existing, it was natural to
him to keep on existing, it was natural to him to have in him
religion and eating and sleeping and washing, he had had them all
always from his beginning. It did not make him important to himself
inside him, it made him important to everyone who knew him. There
were many things in him and these will come out in the history of
him. Always religion was in him, always he was important to every
one who knew him. There were some who did not understand it in him,
who thought it of him that religion was in him as a kind of lying
but these did not understand religion in him, it was in him and had
been in him from his beginning, it was in him as eating was in him,
as sleeping was in him, as washing was to him. It did not make him
important to himself inside him, it did make him important to every
one that knew him.</p>

<p>This father Mr. Richardson and his two children Eddy and Lilly
were different from any of the others who lived then in the small
houses near the ten acre place where the Hersland family were
living in that part of Gossols where no other rich people were
living. Slowly the Hersland children came to know the three of
them, they began to know then the character of the two children
Eddy and Lilly Richardson, they never came to have in them, the
Hersland family then, much more knowledge of the father of the two
children Mr. Richardson. The character of Eddy and Lilly Richardson
will come out then in the history of the Hersland children as they
come to know it in them. There were then many families living in
the small houses near the ten acre place where the Hersland family
were living then in that part of Gossols where no other rich people
were living. There were many families of, for them, poor queer
people living near them and each one of the families of them had in
them their own way of living, their own way of going on existing,
of having uncertain things in them, of earning their daily living.
More and more the Hersland family came to know them, more and more
the Hersland children came to be of them.</p>

<p>There were many families of them. Some of them had many
children. Almost all of them had things in them to interest the
Hersland children. Some of them were good companions to them in
their out door living, some in the school life they lead together
with them, some from the books and other things that they loaned to
them, all these children in the little houses near them were in
some way interesting to some one of the three of them either from
what they were in themselves then or from their lives or what they
had in their houses to lend to them, they were, all of these
children of the, for them, poor queer people around them, they were
all in some way interesting to some one of the three of them. They
were, all of them, more and more interesting to the three Hersland
children as these came always more and more to know them, as they
came to be more and more a part of them. The Hersland children came
to know them, they came to know others who knew these who lived
near them, some who lived in other parts of Gossols and some of
these others that the Hersland children came to know through the
families near them, some of these others came later to be very
important to the three of them, some came to be important to the
father of the Hersland children, some also to the mother of them,
all this will come out in the later history of them. This was the
beginning of living for the Hersland children, and more and more
then they came to know the, for them, poor queer people who lived
in the little houses near them in that part of Gossols where no
other rich people were living.</p>

<p>So then it was then slowly coming to be true of them that the
three children were more entirely of them, the poorer people who
lived around them, than they were of their mother then, than their
mother was of them then, though they were all there was of their
mother's daily living then. This was true of them then in the years
when they were only beginning to know themselves inside them. Later
then in their living with the same people around them, Alfred the
elder son of the two boys then was beginning to have inside him a
feeling in him as there always had been in the mother of them, he
was beginning then not to be any longer of them the poorer people
who lived around them, more and more then such a feeling went out
of him and he was beginning to have it fill up in him then inside
him to replace the feeling that was not then any longer in him, out
of the feeling that gave his mother her important being. In the
daughter there was more in her then when she was older of the kind
of feeling that their father had in him. In the younger son there
always remained in him all through his later living the feeling
that made him be one to him with the people that had been around
him. All this will come out in the detailed history of each one of
the three of them. Now in the beginning they were all three of them
of the people who lived in the small houses around them. To begin
again then when it was slowly coming to be true of them that the
three children were more entirely of them, the poorer people who
lived around them, than they were of their mother then, than their
mother was of them then, though they were all there was of their
mother's daily living then. They were all there was of their
mother's daily living then but they were nothing to her then of the
important being that was beginning to be strong inside her then.
They were to her in her then as they had been when she was bearing
them, they were part of her as her arms or heart were part of her
then, she felt them, she took care of them then as she took care of
her body out of which she had once made them and so she always felt
them. Later she was lost among them, she would be scared then and
they were no longer of her then, they were not any longer in her
then to her, she was for them then a gentle scared little-thing.
She was lost among them then, sometimes they would be good to her
then, oftener she would not be existing for them then, mostly she
was scared then and the important feeling was dead in her then, she
had lost them, they were not of her any more then and she lost her
body with them. Sometimes then they would be good to her, mostly
they forgot about her, slowly she died away among them and then
there was no more of living for her, she died away from all of
them. She had never been really important to any of them, she was
not important to her husband then for she was not enough to fill
him now that he was shrinking away from the outside of him, she was
not enough any more now to fill him, she was not in any way then
important to her children for now they did not need to have in them
the feeling that she had for them when they were for her as if she
was still carrying them inside her still using herself up to make
them from out of her, they were not in any way then any longer
necessary to her, they had never been in her a part of her in the
important being that was all that there was real to her of an
important feeling inside in her. She was not then any more
important to any of them when they were older, she was not
important to her husband then for she was not enough then any more
to fill him, not to her children, she never had been important to
them after they had come to their individual feeling, they had
never been in her a part of the important feeling to herself inside
her, now she had a scared feeling in her, now she was lost among
them and mostly they forgot about her, now she died away among them
and they never thought about her, sometimes they would be good to
her, mostly for them she had no existence in her and then she died
away and the gentle scared little woman was all that they ever
after remembered of her. Those who always after remembered about
her were the servants, the governesses, the dependents who had been
around her, they always were a real life to her, they were the
important feeling in her, they always remembered about her, they
had felt the real important being to herself inside her. This then
is the history of how they came together with her to be in her and
to give to her the important feeling inside her that was all there
ever was of real being in her.</p>

<p>Her children were then a part of her, they were never any part
of the important feeling of herself inside her that was beginning
then to stir in her. It was slowly coming to be true of them then,
the three Hersland children then, that they were more entirely of
them, the poorer people who lived around them, than they were of
their mother then, than their mother was of them then, though they
were all that there was of their mother's daily living then.</p>

<p>Their mother then was just beginning to have in her the
important feeling that had first become a little stirred up to be
made inside her by her knowing the Shilling mother and the daughter
Sophie Shilling and the other daughter Pauline Shilling. This
important feeling that had then been a little begun inside her was
now to be more stirred up in her, was to come to be almost a real
thing in her by her living in that part of Gossols where no other
rich people were living near her and in a kind of living that was
not a natural way of being for her. Here she had around her, for
her, poor queer kind of people in the little houses near her, in
the house with her she had servants and governesses and
seamstresses who made a life for her, her children who were then a
part of her to her, and her husband and the certain little power
with him she felt in herself to have in her, though mostly she had
not in her for her husband or her children a sense of being
important to herself inside her. This important feeling of herself
inside her that had begun a little to exist in her from the
Shilling family to her, was now stirred up to be more in her with
the governesses and seamstresses and servants who lived in the
house with her, and with the, for her, poor queer kind of people
who lived in the small houses near her.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of men. Some kinds of them have it in them
to feel themselves as big as all the world around them. Some have
such a sense in them only when a new thing begins in them, soon
they lose it out of them.</p>

<p>There are many ways of being a man, there are many millions of
each kind of them, more and more in ones living they are there
repeating themselves around one, every one of them in his own way
being the kind of man he has in him, and there are always many
millions made just like each one of them.</p>

<p>There are many ways of being a man and sometime one gets to know
almost all of them, some sometime get to know all of them, there
are many millions made of each kind of them, each one of them is
different from all the other millions made just like him, this
makes of him an individual, this in some of them makes in him an
individual feeling to have inside in him, in some of some kinds of
them there is almost nothing of such an individual being, perhaps
always in every one in some way there is something of such an
individual being, in all men, in women, and in the children of
them. There are many kinds of men, of every kind of them there are
many millions of them many millions always made to be like the
others of that kind of them, of some kinds of them there are more
millions made like the others of such a kind of them than there are
millions made alike of some other kinds of men. Perhaps this is not
really true about any kind of them, perhaps there are not less
millions of one kind of men than there are millions of other kinds
of them, perhaps one thinks such a thing about some kinds of men
only because in some kinds of men there is more in each one of such
a kind, more in the many millions of such a kind of them, of an
individual feeling in every one of such a kind of them. Perhaps in
some kinds of men there are many more, in the many millions of
their kind of them, there are many more of them that have in them a
strongly existing individual being than in some other kinds of men
other kinds of men of which there are not really any more millions
made alike than there are of those kinds of men. Perhaps it is this
strongly existing individual being in some of the kinds of men that
makes it seem that there are less millions of them in the world of
men than there are of other kinds of men other kinds of men who
have in most of them less in them of such individual existing.
Perhaps it is this in some of the kinds of men those kinds in which
many of the millions of them have much in them of individual being,
perhaps it is that which makes any one who knows any one of such
kinds of men think him more different from the other millions of
them made just like him the other millions of his kind of men,
makes those who know any of such a kind of men, feel them to be
more different one from the other of their kind of men than the
ones of some other kind of men are different from the other
millions of their kind of men to those who meet many of them.
Always there are many kinds of men and always there are many
millions made of each kind of them, there are many kinds of men and
many millions of each kind of them, there are many kinds of women
and there are many millions made of each kind of them, there are
many children of these many men and many women and the kinds are
often very much mixed up in them but more and more the kind that
really is in each one of them more and more as one knows them it
comes out to be clear in each one of them. Some kinds of men have,
in most of the millions made of such a kind of them, have in them
more of an individual being than most of the millions of some other
kind of men. Some kinds of them have much more of an individual
being as a nature in them than there is in other kinds of men. Each
kind of them has in the many millions of that kind of them more, in
some of them of individual feeling than there is in others of them.
All this will come out slowly as it is written down about them, it
comes out slowly in the living that every body is every day doing
with all the many kinds of them, the many kinds of men the many
kinds of women and the many kinds of children that have these many
men and many women mixed up in them.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of men, there are many kinds of women there
are many kinds of ways of mixing them in the children that come out
of them. There are many kinds of men and many millions made of each
kind of them. Some kinds of them have more in all of them of
individual being than there is in some of the other kinds of men.
In each kind of men, in the many millions of each kind of them
there are always among them some with much, some with less, and
some with little, and some with almost not any individual feeling
in them some of such of them need other men around them to give the
man an individual feeling in them, some men have in them so much
individual feeling in them that they make their way through
everything around them, some of them have it so much in them that
they feel themselves as big as all the world around them.</p>

<p>There are some men who have always such bigness in them, there
are some who have such a feeling in them when a new thing begins in
them and then soon these lose it out of them. There are some who
have such a feeling in them when they are first beginning their
individual being, some of such ones never lose it out of them for
they are always strong to be beginning and beginning is all of
living to them. In some of such ones of them it comes in their
later living to be only impatient feeling, they are then no longer
beginning they are then full up with impatient feeling. Later in
their living they have not enough in them any more of impatient
feeling to fill them, they are old then and shrinking away from the
outside of them so then it is in them the always beginning and
being then in their feeling as big as all the world around them,
then it comes to be in them only the being full up with impatient
feeling and then it comes to be when they are old and weakening it
comes to be a shrinking away of themselves from the outside of
them, they are old men then and they have not any success in them,
they are not any longer full up then not with big feeling or
beginning or even any more with impatient feeling, they are old
then and have not any success in them and it needs others then to
make them full again inside them and mostly in their old age this
does not happen in them, mostly in their old age such ones are
never full inside them.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of men. Some kinds of them have it in them
to feel themselves as big as all the world around them, some of
this kind have it in them to keep this always in them all through
their living. Some of this kind of men have such a sense in them
only when a new thing begins in them, soon they lose it out of
them. Some of this kind of men have such a sense in them only in
their own beginning, later they lose it out of them. Some have it
in them as their beginning and always they are beginning in their
living and this feeling comes again and again to be in them with
each beginning of their living and beginning in such of them is all
there is of living. Some, and David Hersland who had come to
Gossols to make his great fortune was one of them, some of such a
kind of men have it in them to be as big as all the world in their
beginning, they are strong in beginning and beginning things is all
of living in them, then each beginning comes to be in them an
impatient feeling. These never lose their big feeling they just
begin a new thing and they are strong in beginning, they are as big
then as all the world around them, they keep their big feeling for
each time the beginning in them turns into impatient feeling they
are then full up with impatient feeling, this makes them full
inside them, they never have it in them to lose this feeling of
being as big in them as all the world around them, they never can
lose this feeling then until they are old men and weakening and
then they shrink away from the outside of them and so they lose
this certain sense of being as big as all the world around them for
then they have this empty space in them where they have shrunk away
from the outside of them and they have to be filled up again, they
have not enough then of big feeling in them, they have not enough
strength to have in them then a beginning, they have not enough
then of impatient feeling to fill them, they need other people to
help them to fill them up inside them, they can never again have in
them of themselves then a feeling of being as big as all the world
around them. As I have been saying there are many kinds of men and
there are many millions made of each kind of them. David Hersland
who had come to Gossols to make for himself a great fortune was of
one kind of them. He was of the kind of them that feel themselves
to be as big as all the world around them. Every one who knew him
felt it in him. His children felt it less in him for they knew from
their daily living with him that this was only in him when he was
beginning, mostly he was filled up with impatient feeling. He had
this big feeling in him, they knew it about him but, for them, it
was his being full up with impatient feeling that was important to
them in their daily life with him. His children, in the way it
almost always is with men, his children always were outside him,
part of the world he was handling, sometimes using them sometimes
brushing them away from before him, often fighting with them and
always dropping or domineering them.</p>

<p>His children had it in them, in the way that almost all children
have it in them, his children had it in them for a long time to be
afraid of him. Almost all the time of their living together in the
house with him they had such a fear in them, but really they had it
less in them than many children for the fathers of them, they had
it less from him as they learnt more and more to know it of him
that he was mostly filled up inside him with impatient feeling, so
they had always less and less of fear in them, they knew it more
and more of him that he would not keep up anything against the wish
in them, soon he would be changing, he never would carry out into
action any anger he felt with them, it would soon be in him an
impatient feeling and then there was not any more, for them,
anything to fear from him. Always they more and more had this in
them about him and so more and more they did not fear him. Always
there remained a little fear in them for children never know all
that a father can have in him. He may have it in him to be worse
than they have ever known him, it is this uncertain danger to them
that may be in him that makes a father always fearful to his
children, it is in his voice, in his movements, in the sudden
outbursts from him, children never can know really what is going on
in the father of them as they know it in other children around them
or in the mother of them. However the Hersland children learned
more and more in their daily living that their father was mostly
filled up with impatient feeling, they knew he had a big feeling in
him, they felt this sometimes in him, sometimes it made them
ashamed when they went about with him, sometimes they liked the big
joyous feeling that it gave him but mostly for all three of them in
their younger living with him the important thing about him was
that he was filled up with impatient feeling.</p>

<p>Beginning was all of living with him, in a beginning he was
always as big in his feeling as all the world around him. Beginning
was almost all of living in him. Always he was beginning and always
he was strong in his beginning, always then he was as big as all
the world in his feeling. There are many ways of beginning, there
are some things in living that have in them always more of
beginning than other things in living, education is such a part of
living, eating and doctoring and making a great fortune in a place
where everybody is beginning in their living.</p>

<p>Ways of educating children, ways of eating and doctoring, all
have it in them to be always in a beginning.</p>

<p>In many people's living beginning is all there is of living, in
many people's living it is dying ending that is to them all they
have in them, some of these have always in them the fear in them of
dying of ending, and then ending is in their feeling in every
moment of their living. There are many ways for them of having such
a feeling always in them the feeling of ending always inside them,
some of them have it in a fear that is always in them, some have it
in a sad feeling always somewhere inside them in them, some have it
from a feeling that is not a sadness in them but a fullness of
ending to them and these always are talking of how everything is
always ending; ending is all of living to many men and very many
women, ending is all of living with them, and these have not a fear
in them, they have not sadness in them, all that there is for them
is ending and that gives to their living fullness and meaning. Such
ones are very full of ending full of ending as some other men and
some women have it in them to be very full with beginning, for such
ones then there is, too, very much of meaning in ways of educating
children, ways of eating and ways of doctoring. In all of these
things then there is much beginning there is much of ending.</p>

<p>In ways of educating children in ways of eating and ways of
doctoring there can be always to them who have in them beginning as
all there is of living, much to content them; for those who have in
them ending as the important feeling in them they too can find it
strongest in them for them in ways of educating children in ways of
eating and ways of doctoring. These then who have for them as the
whole of living either always beginning or always in an ending,
these then can have it in them in many ways and with many kinds of
feelings inside them, they can have it in a strong fear in them
they can have it without any such a fear in them, they can have it
with dying as always the strongest thing in them, they can have it
with living as the most conscious thing in them, there are many
ways that they can have it in them, with sadness or cheerful
feeling in them, with energy or weakness in them, but always they
have it together in all of them that ending or beginning is all of
living to them, and for them ways of eating, ways of doctoring,
ways of educating children are for them the strongest thing inside
them.</p>

<p>In David Hersland the father of the three children whose lives
we are now soon to be watching, to David Hersland beginning was all
of living to him. For him there was in his living ways of eating,
ways of doctoring, ways of educating his children, ways of making
his great fortune here in Gossols where he was to make his
important beginning.</p>

<p>There are many ways of eating, for some eating is living, for
some eating is dying, for some thinking about ways of eating gives
to them the feeling that they have it in them to be alive and to be
going on living, to some to think about eating makes them know that
death is always waiting that dying is in them, some of such of them
have then a fear in them and these then never want to be thinking
about ways of eating, they want their eating without any thinking,
they never want to have the fear in them that comes to them with
thinking about ways of eating, of ways of keeping health in them.
As I have been saying to some eating is a way of living, to some
eating is dying. To many, now, thinking about eating is all of
living to them, it is living, it is always beginning, it is like
doctoring or educating children. David Hersland the father of the
three children whose lives we will now soon be knowing was such a
one, beginning was all of living to him, he had it in him in his
beginning to be as big as all the world around him. He had it in
him to be always beginning, beginning was living to him and this
will come out in the history of him. He had it in him to be always
beginning. There are some things in living that have it in them to
have always more of beginning to them than other things in living,
eating is such a part of living, eating and doctoring and educating
children. Ways of eating, ways of doctoring, ways of educating
children, all have it in them to be always in a beginning. As I was
saying David Hersland was a big man and he liked different ways of
eating, he liked to think about what was good for him in eating, he
liked to think about what was good for every one around him in
their eating, and he was always changing, he was always beginning
and often he was full up with impatient feeling; this could be in
him about the way of eating as it was in him about everything in
his living. David Hersland was a big man, sometimes one felt about
him that he filled up the whole world he looked so large then to
every one who saw him, often he did not have such a bigness in him.
Not that he was really such a large man to look at him but when he
was full up with beginning he filled everything around him, he was
as big then as all the world which was then in him to everybody who
then saw him. As I was saying there are many kinds of men and there
are many millions of each kind of them. As I was saying there are
some kinds of them that have in them so much individual being in
them that one can never think it about them that there are many
millions made like them. Mr. David Hersland was of such a kind of
them, he had it in him to be so full up with beginning that he was
a big man filling up all the space around him, no one could come to
think it about him then that there are many millions made just like
him, but there are many millions made of each kind of men, there
are many millions made who have such a bigness in them, some of
them always have such a bigness in them every moment of their
being, some have it only in their beginning soon they lose it out
of them, some have it every time they are beginning and beginning
is all of living to them, some of such ones are big in all their
living, some have it in them only at moments in their living but
all of them have it in them sometimes to be as big as all the world
around them, all the world is in them and everybody can see it who
then sees them.</p>

<p>David Hersland was such a one when he was in each one of his
beginnings, soon then he would be filled up with impatient feeling
and then there would be in him less of such a big feeling to every
one who then looked at him, later in his life he was old and
weakening and he then was shrunk away from the outside of him, he
then did not have inside him enough to fill him, he was not then a
big man to every one who saw him.</p>

<p>As I was saying there are many millions of every kind of men and
there are many millions who have in them the kind of being David
Hersland had in him. They have it in them some of them, as I have
been saying, in all of their living, some have it in them in their
eating, some have it in them in their drinking, some have it in
them in business and their living, some have it in them in their
loving, some have it so much in them that they have Arabian nights
inside them; there are many millions of such a kind of them and
this is a history of one of that kind of them, of David Hersland
and the big ways he had in him.</p>

<p>As I was saying the father of the three of them whose lives we
are soon now to be watching, Mr. David Hersland, had come to
Gossols to make for himself his great fortune. There was for him,
as I was saying, beginning as the whole of living, there was for
him in living, eating and doctoring and educating his children and
making for himself a great fortune. There were other things in him
but they were not for him so important to him, they had not for him
so much of beginning. As I was saying ways of eating were always to
him living, they were to him always full of beginning and this is a
history of the way he tried many of them. As I was saying there are
many ways of eating, for some eating is living for some eating is
dying, for some thinking about ways of eating gives to them the
feeling that they have it in them to be alive and to be going on
living, to some to think about eating makes them know that death is
always waiting that dying is in them. Mr. Hersland always liked to
think about what was good for him in eating, he liked to think
about what was good for every one around him in their eating, he
liked to buy all kinds of eating, he liked all kinds of thinking
about eating, eating was living to him, eating was beginning to
him, beginning was all of living in him, always he was interested
in changing in having new ideas new ways of eating, eating was
living for him, ways of eating were ways of beginning for him,
eating was living to him and there are many millions always made
just like him, many millions who have always new ways of eating in
them, new ways of thinking about eating always inside them, for all
of such then eating is living, to them. There are many ways of
thinking about eating, some who are always thinking about eating
have not in them any love of eating, some who are always thinking
about eating love to have eating going on inside them. Some of each
of these kinds of men and women and children have it in them to
think about what is good for them in eating, some do not have any
such feeling in them eating is an end in itself for them, eating is
what they need to content them. This is true of some of them who
have not in them much love of the real eating going on in them,
this is true of some of them who love the eating always going on
inside them.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersland had many theories in him, eating was to him a
pleasure when it was going on inside him, but to him that was not
the important thing for him. The important thing to him in him were
ways of knowing what kind of eating was good for him, ways of
having in him new ways of beginning, this was important to himself
inside him. Eating was not, to himself, eating, for him, it was
living, it was theorising and believing, it was new ways of
beginning. He loved to have eating going on inside him and then
often, before finishing, he would be filled up, to complete him,
with impatient feeling and then he would push eating away from him,
then he would be changing, then he would find new things good for
him, he would find in eating a new beginning.</p>

<p>Many men and many women and some children are always thinking of
what is good for them in their eating. For some of these then
eating is living for some of these then eating is dying, some find
in ways of eating the continuing of living some find in ways of
eating putting off a little longer their ending but dying is always
inside them, some of these then, the many men and many women and
some children who have it in them to be always thinking about
eating about what is good in it for them, some of these then have
not in them any love of eating, some of them have it in them to be
loving the eating going on inside them, Mr. Hersland was such a one
but to himself it was never his loving the eating going on inside
him that was important to him, it was his theories of eating, his
changings, his beginning, new ways of finding ways of eating that
were good for him, these were important to him. In Mr. Hersland's
ways of eating his children felt it in him that he was often filled
up with impatient feeling. They more and more had it in them to
know it of him that he loved to have eating going on inside him and
more and more they came to know it of him that he, often then,
before ending with the eating, would be filled up with impatient
feeling and then he would push his eating away from him. It was in
Mr. David Hersland's ways of eating, his ways of doctoring, his
ways of educating them, his ways of changing, that all three of his
children, each one as they felt themselves inside them an
individual being apart from others around them, began to feel it in
them that the father of them was big in his beginning and soon then
he would be full up with impatient feeling. This, the character in
him, made a different impression on each one of the three of them
and this will come out in them in the slow history of each one of
them. The eldest Martha had it in her to be like him in never
finishing but she was not then filled up with impatient feeling,
she was not strong in a beginning she was not then as big as all
the world as her father had it to be inside him. She had it in her
in her later living to be often beginning, to be impatient but not
to be full up with such feeling, she had it in her to be like him
the father of them but she never had it in her to understand him,
she had it in her to irritate in him his impatient feeling she had
it in her always to be afraid of him but all this will come out
later in the history of her as she grew older as she went away from
all of them and then came back out of her trouble to him and always
she was like him and always she could not understand him, always
she could irritate the impatient feeling that he had always inside
him then, always she was in a way afraid of the irritation in him
that she always gave to him. The elder son Alfred had it in him not
to be like his father in always beginning, beginning was not strong
in him, there was more of his mother in him but he had it in him to
be always in his later living full up with impatient feeling, he
had no bigness in him as the father had in his beginnings, there
was never any such bigness in him and always then he was full up
with impatient feeling. He had it in him to see the bigness in his
father in his beginnings and he had in him a great admiration for
the big ways his father always had in him, he had never any such
bigness inside him, always he felt it in his father and wanted to
have it, too, inside him; more and more in his living he did not
have any such bigness in him and later it was enough for him to be
filled up with impatient feeling. This made a history for him. The
younger one David had a bigness in him it was not like that in the
father of them, it was not like the beginnings that the father
always had in him, it was always in young David that he needed to
have in him understanding of everything inside and around him, that
he needed to have in him understanding every minute inside him why
life was to him worth his living. His father never could understand
it in him: his father's being full up with impatient feeling was
always an irritation to him, his father's always beginning was
always, to him, failing, he knew his father had big things in him
but it was his being full up with impatient feeling that was
irritating to David and there was always a little in him of
contempt that his father was always beginning and then he would be
full up with impatient feeling and then he would be changing and
then he would push everything away from him.</p>

<p>The three of them came then more and more to know it about the
father of them that he had a great bigness in him, that he was
strong in beginning, that he would soon then be full up with
impatient feeling, that he would then push everything away from him
or go away and leave it there unfinished behind him, that he then
would be changing and soon then there would be in him a new
beginning and he would then be to every one who saw him as big as
all the world around him.</p>

<p>This nature in him came out in him every minute in his living.
He had many things in him. He had in him his wife, she was never
very important to him, she was sometimes there as a tender feeling
inside him, she was a woman for him when he needed to have one, she
had in her an important feeling but this as far as he knew it was
only a joke to him, he never brushed her away from before him, he
never pushed her away from him, she was never existing for him
except as a woman when he had need of one, sometimes as a tender
feeling in him, sometimes as a joke to him, she never had any
existence for him outside of him. When she was not to him inside
him she was never existing for him and so he never brushed her away
from before him. She would do things for the children, sometimes he
got angry with her then, mostly he never knew she did them those
things that he did not want that they should have done for them, he
never thought about it except when he was angry with her for them,
mostly she was not in any such way important to him. Then there was
for him in his living then the making of his great fortune, for
that he was always fighting and pushing men away from around him
and trying to brush them away from before him, in this he had it in
him, though here too he was always changing and beginning, here he
had it more in him than in any other thing in his living, to keep
on with his going, he was always changing and beginning but mostly
he kept on going much more than he ever had it in him to keep on
going to an ending in ways of eating in ways of doctoring in ways
of educating the children. In his home being he had around him the
many people who lived in the small houses near them, but they were
not important to him, they were like the governesses and
seamstresses and servants and dependents there in the house with
him, his being with all of these then was part of his wife's living
with them and this will soon now come out in the living his wife
did with them and with him. His children were for him, as it often
is with men, his children were for him always outside him part of
the world he was handling, sometimes playing with them, sometimes
angry with them, sometimes loving with them, sometimes using,
mostly fighting, and always dropping or domineering.</p>

<p>There were then living together Mr. David Hersland, his wife
Fanny Hersland, their three children Martha and Alfred and David
and in the house with them a governess a seamstress and the
servants, in a part of Gossols where no other rich people were
living. Near them were small houses with, for them, poor queer kind
of people in them. Soon all of them living in the house came to
know many of these, for them, poor queer people near them, some of
these came to be a little dependent upon them, some of them came to
be nearly all there was then of the three children's daily living
that was important then to them.</p>

<p>They were all living, this family then, in a pleasant house in a
ten acre place where living was very pleasant for them. They did
there a little fancy farming, they had a little grain and fruit
trees and vegetable gardening, they had many kinds of trees and
sometimes they chopped down one of them, they had dogs and chickens
and sometimes ducks and turkeys in the yard then, they had horses
and two cows and sometimes they had young ones from the horses and
the cows and that was very interesting to all of them, sometimes
they had rabbits and always they had dogs, often they had a number
of men working for them to get the hay in, sometimes they would
catch rats and mice in the barn and that was very exciting to the
children and sometimes to the father of them, and all around the
ten acre place to shut all these joys in was a hedge of roses and
in the summer many people came to pick them and then the family
would let the dogs loose to bark at them and scare them, sometimes
some one would come at night to steal fruit from them sometimes to
steal a chicken and then there would be excitement for all of them
and the dogs would be let loose to find the man but the dogs then
were mostly not very anxious to get into danger with a strange man,
they barked hard and that was all the danger there was for them or
for the man who was stealing. And so they went on with the living
all of them and mostly then their living was pleasant and
interesting.</p>

<p>They were then regular in their living, the father was already
then often full up with impatient feeling but in the beginning of
their living in Gossols on the ten acre place in that part of
Gossols where no other rich people were living, living was pleasant
enough for all of them. Living was pleasant enough then for every
one of them, living was often then more than pleasant enough for
them, it was often full of joy to each one of them then, almost
always it was pleasant enough there then to all of them.</p>

<p>Living was pleasant enough for all of them. The father had in
him then much of changing much of beginning, he had ways of eating
ways of doctoring ways of educating the children and he was always
changing in them and this changing and then being full up with
impatient feeling was already then a part of all of their daily
living. The mother had her life with her husband and her children
and her important feeling with the governess and servants and
seamstress and the dependents near them, she had in her also her
feeling of right rich living. The children, all three of them had
it in them to be, in their feeling, more, of them, the poor people
who lived around them, than they were of the family living then, at
least this other life was, to all three of them, more inside to
them then. They had their regular living, they had their school,
their father and their mother and the three of them had the
relation of each one of the others of them toward them, they had a
governess and servants and men working, around them, they had all
the joys of country living, and they had each one of them inside
beginning then their own individual feeling.</p>

<p>Their father was always to all three of them, as it mostly is
with men, their father was always to each one of them outside of
them to them, part of the world to fear or fight, now and always
for them. Sometimes they were very pleasant with him, sometimes
loving to him, sometimes resisting to him, fighting or deceiving,
always he was outside of them, always there was in him a danger to
them, always they were never certain how far his anger might drive
him, how far he would live his own life away from them. They never
could have in them any such feeling about a woman or with children,
it is only men who give to children this uncertain feeling, they
never can know it about one of them how far the anger in him may
drive him.</p>

<p>Life was pleasant there then for all of them. Always then in
some ways trouble came to be inside in each one of them. As I was
saying, in the early days of their living the father had it in him
to be changing, to be full up with impatient feeling but this only
made a reason to him for making a new beginning. This came out in
him every day in his daily living.</p>

<p>As I was saying, they were regular enough in their daily living.
The children had their schooling and that was mostly a regular
thing with them, then they had various other ways of getting
education and in these their father always had new ideas inside
him.</p>

<p>All of the three children were beginning to have in them their
own individual feeling. This began early in each one of them as it
mostly is with children who have freedom in them and a father full
up with beginning to commence them. Each one of them had already
then their own kind of trouble inside in them, each one of them had
soon a feeling about the ways of educating the way of getting new
ways for the education of them, about ways of eating, that their
father had then and always in him. All three of them then began to
have in them their own individual feeling, there was beginning soon
in each one of them the being alone inside, each one of them in
their own feeling. They were different each one of them from the
others of them in the troubles they had then inside them, in the
lonely feeling they had sometimes in them that they were alone each
one in them, in the scared feeling they could have in them, in the
hurt or angry feelings each one in their own way had inside them.
They were different each one of them from the others of them in the
troubles they had then inside them, in the lonely feeling they had
sometimes in them that each one was alone inside and this was
sometimes all they needed to content them. They were different each
one of them in the troubles they had then inside them, in the
feeling that they had each one of them toward the father of them,
toward the mother of them, toward the governess and other people in
the house with them, toward the people living in the small houses
near them. Each one of them was very different inside from the
others of them, in all their ways each one of them had different
feelings from the others of them different ways of being alone
inside in them, different ways of thinking feeling suffering and
playing. As I was saying, in a way life was regular enough for all
of them then in the ten acre place in that part of Gossols where no
other rich people were living cut off from all right rich being. As
I was saying life was regular enough for all of them for the three
children and the father and the mother of them. The children went
to public school for their education. Their father had ideas about
other things they should learn, other ways of doing besides the
ways of the other children around them and it was in such things
that he was always beginning.</p>

<p>Then there was their eating and their doctoring and the father
always had new ideas inside him, new ways of beginning in ways they
should have of eating and the doctoring that was good for
children.</p>

<p>They were regular enough then in their daily living. The
children were regular enough in their living, they were different
each one of them from the other two of them, different in every
thing in them for each one of them was of a different kind of being
from the other two of them. The father and the mother mixed up in
them made of each one of them a different kind of being from the
others of them, this will come out more and more in them if they go
on living as in old age they go on repeating what is inside them so
that any one can know them. In their early living when they are no
longer children this nature in them comes out less with repeating
and so any one who knows them can know what is inside them. In
children as it always is with young living there is much repeating
but it is not then so surely themselves they are expressing, in
their older living their repeating is then all that there is of
them, when they are children their repeating does not tell what is
really them, as young grown men and women it is much harder to know
what is real in them but always they are telling, slowly they begin
repeating, slowly we find it out about them what they have really
inside them. As I was saying they were regular enough in their
daily living, regular as living comes to be in later living,
regular in repeating but, as I was saying, in the regular repeating
in mostly all children there is less that is really from them more
that is just part of the regular living around them. The three
children had their regular school living.</p>

<p>There are many ways of taking teaching and each one of the
Hersland children had a different way of learning from the other
two of them, a different way of feeling about teachers and
teaching, a different way of having pride in them and this came out
very early in their living, in the regular public school training.
There are many ways of having pride inside in one and always in
receiving teaching the different kind of pride shows in each one.
Martha, Alfred and David each one had a kind of pride in them but
it was a very different pride in each one of them, it made a very
different relation for each one of them to the teachers in the
public school and to the governess at home and to the children
around them, to the father of them and sometimes, not very often,
to the mother of them. The three of them Martha, Alfred and David
had different ways of having pride in them in taking the teaching
they had in school with the other children around them, in taking
their father's ideas of things they should learn from the governess
and other teachers he had to teach them. All three of them had many
kinds of education because of him. Sometimes they all three would
be having just ordinary schooling. Sometimes all three would be
having extra teaching, sometimes one or the other stopped going to
school to try some other way of education that their father then
thought would be good then for that one of them. Mostly though, in
their younger living, they had all three of them fairly regular
public school training and they had then each one their own feeling
toward the life there with the teachers and the other children and
this will come out in the history of each one. This will come out
in the history of each one of them for I am thinking with each one
of the three of them soon now there must be a beginning, I am
thinking in each one of them soon there will be a beginning of a
history of them from their beginning, and so slowly we can know it
about them, each one of them, the real nature in them and the other
kinds of nature mixed up in each one of them with the fundamental
nature in them.</p>

<p>Mostly then in their young living they had regular public school
training. Sometimes their father would be strong in religion and
then this would make for the children complications in their daily
living.</p>

<p>As I was saying in their younger living there was mostly a
regular every day existence for them, in their younger living it
was important to them that their father was as big as all the world
around him, and it was then in him sometimes a little embarrassment
to them, as I was telling, but mostly they liked it well enough the
living with him and the things he was beginning and the ten acre
place which was full of much joy then for all of them and the
people in the small houses near them who were important then to all
three of them in their daily living.</p>

<p>In their younger living, it was not very hard on them, their
father's way of always beginning, they liked it too, the beginning,
and the ending too, that was not so bad then for them, the
impatient feeling in him was not then irritable inside him.</p>

<p>They had some troubles with him then in their early living,
sometimes in ways of doctoring, sometimes when he thought it was
good for all of them to have castor oil given to them, sometimes
when he thought a Chinese doctor would be good for them, sometimes
when he had a queer blind man to examine some one of them; but all
this, and the ways of eating, ways of cooking, he thought good for
them, will come out in the history of each one of the three of
them, for in each one of them it had a different effect on them in
their later living, these new beginnings in all their younger
living, beginnings and new ways in doctoring and in ways of
eating.</p>

<p>Sometimes in little things it would be annoying to them in their
early living, his way of beginning and then never knowing that he
was full up with impatient feeling and so had stopped and wanted
others to keep on going. Sometimes this would be annoying of an
evening. He would want to play cards and the three of them would
begin with him, to please him. The children felt it to be hard on
them when they would have begun playing cards just to oblige him
and after a few minutes with them he would have arise in him his
impatient feeling, and he would say, "here you just finish it up I
haven't time to go on playing," and he would call the governess to
take his hand from him and all three of the children would have
then to play together a game none of them would have thought of
beginning, and they had to keep on going for often he would stop in
his walking to find which one was winning, and it never came to him
to know that he had made the beginning and that the children were
playing just because they had to, for him. It was a small thing but
it happened very often to them and it was annoying for them.</p>

<p>In their younger living life was pleasant enough for all of them
in the ten acre place, though they had a governess and that was not
always pleasant to them, their father was not always pleasant for
them, their mother mostly was not very important to them. It was
true of all three of them then that they were more entirely of
them, the poorer people who lived around them, than they were of
their mother then, than their mother was of them then, though they
were all there was of their mother's daily living then.</p>

<p>Later in their living their father was angry when he saw it in
them that they were not comfortable with the people who were always
in a right rich living, when they came in contact with them. This
feeling the mother never had about them. To her she was always of
that right rich being, she never felt it in her that she was cut
off from the way of being that was the natural way of being for
her, she felt the sense of being important inside her, she never
knew that that was different in her than it had been when she was
of the old way of living that was natural to her. It never came to
her to know it inside her that she had in her a feeling of herself
in her that never had been in her and never would be in most of her
own family who had gone on with the natural way of living for them.
She did not know she had had an important feeling of herself inside
her arise in her from being cut off from the natural way of living
for her, from knowing the Shilling family and then from having
later around her only, for her, poor queer kind of people, and
governesses and servants and seamstresses and dependents there in
the house with her.</p>

<p>She never really knew it in her that she was not really
important to the man who was a husband to her. She never really
knew it in her that she was not important to the children who had
been once in her. In her later life when she was weak and breaking
down inside her she felt it a little dimly in her, now she did not
have any such feeling, she had a feeling of herself inside her, she
had around her a governess and servants and a seamstress and
dependents, she had her husband and her three children. She never
knew it in her husband that she was always less and less important
to him, she never knew it then that her children were then coming
to be more entirely of them, the poorer people who lived in the
small houses near them, than they were of their mother then, than
their mother was of them then, though to her feeling then they were
almost all there was then of her daily living. She never knew it
that to the feeling in her of herself inside her her husband and
her children were not important to her, they were of her as if they
were in her a part of her, they were not important to her in the
feeling of herself inside her that had come now to begin to be
really in her.</p>

<p>Real country living feeling all three of the Hersland children
in their younger living had inside them, a real country living
feeling. This they had in them in the ten acre place with the hired
men working and the chickens and ducks and fruit-trees and
haymaking and seed-sewing and cows and some vegetable gardening. It
was to them in their feeling real country living, it was to them
earning a living in the hard country way and it was so that they
then felt it inside them.</p>

<p>The three children had in many ways then in them the feeling of
real country living. Their mother never had this feeling, with her
it was always country house city living. In the children it was
sometimes a real country living feeling that they had in them, and
they were then very really a part of the life around them, of
country ways of making a living, of cows and chickens and
fruit-trees and hunting, and it was for them then in their younger
living not country house city living, it was for them then real
country living and country feeling and village life around them and
hard-working country ways of earning a living.</p>

<p>The people in the small houses near them had all of them a half
and half feeling, a half country and a half city feeling in
them.</p>

<p>The three Hersland children had in them a country house city
feeling only in their mother's feeling and with the governess and
servants and dependents living there in the house with them. As it
was true then of all three of them that they were more then of the
poorer people around them than they were of their mother's living
then, so it was true of the three of them that they had more in
them the country feeling of the people around them than they had of
the half city feeling that these people had in them. All of the
Hersland children had a little too of the half city feeling that
the people around them had in them. The country feeling and the
city feeling the Hersland children had in them in their being part
of the life around them was different than any feeling their mother
and the servants and governesses and dependents living in the house
with them ever had in any of them. Their father had a feeling more
like that in them then, with him it was from his being as big as
all the world around him, everything was in him, he had all of it
somehow someway a little in him, city feeling, country feeling, and
city country house feeling, inside him.</p>

<p>With the people living in the small houses near them Mr.
Hersland mostly had in him city country house living, he was
important to all of them, the only rich man in that part of Gossols
where they were living. He was important to them then, the rich
man, and they did not then know him any more than as his children
then knew him. He was a pleasant enough useful enough man for them
to have living in the big place near them. The queer ways in him
never made them think much about him. They knew then more of the
daily living of Mrs. Hersland and the children. The men in most of
the little houses near the ten acre place mostly, like Mr.
Hersland, only came to their houses for eating, for sleeping and
for Sunday resting. He did the same, only he was a rich man, a
pleasant man enough to them, a useful man enough when they would
have any need of him. They never thought much about the queer ways
he sometimes had in him, they never had then for him anything in
the way of a personal feeling.</p>

<p>He was then for them a city country house person. He had it in
him to feel other things inside him, sometimes to feel in him a
real country living feeling, sometimes he brushed it all away from
him, the country feeling, the city country house feeling living, he
was then inside him a city man with city schemes and troubles and
men around him, and then he walked up and down and his impatient
feeling was irritable inside him and he would be muttering and
talking to himself and jingling the money in his pockets then and
more and more it came to be true of him that he walked up and down
thinking, to himself inside him working, scheming, brushing men
away from around him, domineering over them, going another way not
knowing inside him that he was leaving them because they were then
too many for him.</p>

<p>More and more then in their later living in the ten acre place
in that part of Gossols where no other rich people were living
there was for him no reality to country living, to city country
house living. There was to him then in his later living more
reality in the people living then around him, but this will come
out in the history of him as each of his children get to know it
then about him. For the children it was in the beginning really
country living, for the mother it was always rich city country
house living. For the people around them in Mrs. Hersland then it
was rich city country house living, in Mr. Hersland city being, in
the three Hersland children each one a mixed thing in them of the
three ways of feeling, rich city country house being country being
and city being, and the mixtures of these three feelings in each
one of the three of them to the people in the small houses near
them is part of the history of each one of the three of them.</p>

<p>Each one of them had something in them then of real country
feeling. In some one of them it was the fruit-trees, in some one
the vegetable gardening, in some the cows, in some the chickens, in
some the selling things from the place, in some the men working, in
some ways in all three of them there was then something of real
country living feeling, something of country life earning of a
living. They all three had it in them to have something of such
country feeling. They got it in many ways, in hay-making, hay
cutting, helping the men working, eating bread and vegetables,
fruit as they were picking it, they got it from milking, and butter
and cheese making, they got it from the seasons and the things they
did to help things growing, they got it in every way around them,
they got it in helping ploughing, in helping cut grass, and make
the hay into bales for winter storing, they got it from playing
Indians and having the darkness come around them, they got it from
eating grass and leaves and having the taste in their mouths to
bring back such things to them in their later living, they got it
in every kind of a way then. They got it from the feeling of the
wind around them, when they shouted with it around them, when they
crouched down somewhere with it cut off from them, when they helped
the men sowing seed with it blowing around them, and when the trees
hit their own wood and made that queer sound that they got to have
inside them. One can only get the real feeling of wind blowing in
the country, in country living. Rain beating, and mud and snow and
other ways of feeling the world outside them they can have in city
country house living. Strong wind blowing needs real country living
to give it a right feeling and this they all three of them each in
their own way had then inside them. It was a very different way
that each one of them had it in them, a different way too that
their mother had it in her, that their father had it in him.</p>

<p>Real country living feeling all three of the Hersland children
in their younger living had inside them, a real country living
feeling. It was to them then in their feeling real country living,
it was to them then earning a living in the country way. It was so
that they then felt it inside them. In their later living it was
different in each one of them. In Martha this being part of the
country village living was not in her later living inside her to
her feeling but it was inside her in her being. In Alfred there was
in his later living nothing of this in him, not in his being not in
his feeling; he was of his mother then, the feeling she had had in
her was what was in him then, the being important to himself inside
her, the having in her the right rich being which was the natural
being in her. In the younger brother David this early living was
made by him into him as he made all his living in him, he made it a
part of him, was something in him to be made over inside him to be
a part of the whole of him. As I was saying Mrs. Hersland never had
inside her country living feeling nor city living feeling. She did
not have such a feeling in her any more than the governesses and
seamstresses and servants who lived in the house with her. She had
a feeling of being part of the rich right being that was natural to
her. She had always in her the feeling of rich city country house
living with servants and dependents in the house with her, with
near her, for her, poor queer kind of people who were employed by
her, who were to her different from her, who were with her to her
as they had need of her; she felt herself inside her important to
herself in her with such people always around her. Always more and
more she felt herself important inside her. This came to be in her
at its strongest inside her in her relation to a governess,
Madeleine Wyman. Later it came to be less and less inside her.
Later she was weakening inside her and her feeling of importance to
herself inside her went out in her. She broke down a little, later,
into weakness inside her. She more and more then had no strength in
her, she more and more then was not important to her husband who
was beginning then to have troubles in him that left him nothing of
the tender feeling she had once been for him, she was less and less
important to her children who were then so big inside them that she
was then always lost among them. More and more then in her
weakening she was not of them and superior to them the servants in
the house with them and the people in the small houses near them.
More and more she was weakening then, the feeling of herself inside
her died out of her then. Her husband never thought about her then,
she was lost then among her children who were then themselves
inside in each one of them and fighting it out with all the world
around them, she was not part of their world then, she was lost
among them. She was not any longer then important to the servants
in the house then. There was not any longer then a governess or a
seamstress in the house with them. The people in the small houses
near them were always less and less part of the daily living of
Martha, Alfred and young David then. Mr. Hersland was the only one
important to them then and so in every way the feeling of herself
inside her was no longer kept up in her. Soon it all died out of
the inside of her, she was weakening then and when all the troubles
came to all of them in their later living she died away and left
them and they all soon forgot that she had ever been important to
them as a wife, a mother, a mistress living among them. One never
forgot her in her later living and this was the governess Madeleine
Wyman. With her had come to Mrs. Hersland to have it strongest
inside her in all the living from the beginning to the ending of
her, it had come to her to have in her relation to Madeleine Wyman
and the family of Madeleine Wyman the strongest time in her of
having a feeling of herself inside, of being important to herself
in her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland's living in the ten acre place with a husband,
three children, always with a governess, a seamstress and servants
in the house with her, and with, for her, poor people around her,
was the important part of living to her, the part of living where
she was nearest in her to being important to herself inside her as
an individual power not only as part of the rich being which was
natural to her.</p>

<p>She never knew it in her that it was different inside her than
it would have been in her if she had lived in Bridgepoint with her
family around her and the natural way of being for her always in
her. Slowly the different kind of feeling of herself inside her
grew to be more and more in her. It was at its strongest in her in
her relation to the governess Madeleine Wyman and her struggles
with the family of the Wymans who wanted to interfere with her. It
was strong in her when she went a little later to visit at
Bridgepoint and had her family around her. She was then herself
inside her and that made a kind of a princess of her and they, her
family, never knew it about her, she never knew it in her, that it
was different inside her because of her having been cut off from
the way of living that was the natural way of living for her. This
was the end of the strongest time of being important to herself
inside her. Then began the weakening of this in her, then began the
weakening of the health in her, of herself inside her, of the whole
of her. More and more then she broke down into weakness inside her
and that was the beginning of her ending and she went on then
slowly weakening to the end of her. She died away then and they all
soon forgot her. The governess Madeleine Wyman was the only one to
keep it in her that Mrs. Hersland once had been strong to feel
herself inside her. Madeleine Wyman was married then and had a
successful enough life then but always Mrs. Hersland was the most
important thing, to her, that had ever been in her.</p>

<p>In their younger living all the three children Martha, Alfred
and David, all of them had it in them to be more or less afraid of
their father when he was angry or even playing with them. They
never knew then how the anger in him might drive him, they never
knew when they were playing with him when it might change in him to
an outburst and then they never knew how far this burst would carry
him and so like most women and all children, even when they would
stand up against him, the man near them, they had in their younger
living, all of them, more or less fear in them. This was not in all
of them then a conscious feeling. They had each one then more or
less of fear in them always when with him, when he would be
connected to them in their feeling, in their actual doing. They had
not then this about them in them as a conscious feeling then each
one of them, they did not have then in them while they were
connected to him a conscious feeling of more or less fear in them
until after each time with him, then they would have more or less
in them a conscious feeling in them of the fear that they had
always more or less then in them with him. This was more or less
true then of all three of them. Later in their living when it had
come to be with him that he was all full up with impatient feeling,
that then there was nothing in him that was not impatient feeling,
then they had not any longer much fear of him, they knew it then
about him that he was filled up with impatient feeling, they knew
then that the anger in him never would drive him to any last act
against them. More and more then as impatient feeling was all that
there was of him, less and less then did they have in them any fear
of him, more and more then they could stand up against him and he
would always give way before them. Martha had always a little left
in her even in his latest living of this fear of him, Alfred and
David then had no fear of him, they could stand up to him and win
out against him with not any fear inside them of where his anger
might drive him. This was true of them in his later living, when
his wife was no longer in him, when nothing was in him but
impatient feeling. Later it went further with him, he was shrunk
away then from the outside of him, he had impatient feeling in him
but it was then weakness in him he had not enough of that then to
fill him, he needed others then to fill him, he was then shrunk
away from the outside of him. He needed then a woman to fill him
and that was the last part of his living. Martha was then with him,
she had come back out of her trouble to him, she was then there
taking care of him, she had still a little fear in her of him, she
had not then any power in him, she could not fill him, other women
did it for him, and so he kept on to his ending.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of men and there are many millions made of
each kind of them. The many millions of each kind of them have in
them each one more or less of that which makes such a kind of them.
Of the kind that Mr. David Hersland was he had a great deal of it
in him, later it all turned into impatient feeling inside him,
later then it became only a weakness in him, he was shrunk away
from the outside of him, he needed others then inside him to fill
him.</p>

<p>Mr. David Hersland had it in his strongest living to be as big
as all the world around him, it was in him, he was all it in him,
it was to him all inside him, he was it and it was to him all
always in him. This was the big feeling in him and then he was
strong in beginning. This was the biggest time of his living, when
this was strong in him his big feeling his being strong in
beginning his keeping going even with impatient feeling in him,
before all of it in him turned into impatient feeling. This was the
big time in his living, and this was when his wife was still in him
as a tender feeling, when his children were first beginning to have
in them individual feeling. This was the time of such a big feeling
in him and then he was strong in beginning. The world around him,
all, every moment, in beginning, it was then and it was all in him,
and he was strong then and full up with beginning. There are many
millions of every kind of men, there are many millions of them and
they have each one of them more or less in them of the kind of man
they are and this makes a different being of each one of the many
millions of that kind of them, that, the quantity in them of their
kind of being, and the mixture in them of other kinds of being in
them. There are many millions of each kind of men and other kinds
of being are mixed up in each one of each kind of them but the
strongest thing in each one of them is the bottom in them the kind
of being in them that makes them. The bottom to every one then is
the kind of being that makes him, it makes for him the kind of
thinking, the way of eating, the way of drinking, the way of
loving, the way of beginning, and the way of ending, in him. Other
kinds of natures are in almost all men and almost all women mixed
up in them with the bottom nature of them, and this mixture in them
with the amount they have in them of their bottom kind of nature in
them makes in each one a different being from the many millions
always being made like him. There are many kinds of men then and
there are always many millions made of each kind of them. There is
a kind of them that have it in them to be as big as all the world
in their feeling, to be strong in beginning, and that is their kind
of men. For such a kind of men the world around them is all in a
beginning, for each of them beginning is the strongest thing in
them. There are many millions of such a kind of men and they have
it in all of them to be strong in beginning. In some of them, and
they are mostly weaker in all their living, weaker than some of the
other millions made of that kind of them, some of them keep on to
their last minute with beginning, they are always a little weaker
in their living, they are always to their last ending busy with
beginning, some of such a kind of them have a great kind of bigness
in them but they are weaker in their living than others of that
kind of men, some of such ones of that kind of men have a great
kind of feeling in them but it is in them only great in its
beginning, it goes out into little things later in them, they must
then have it in them to commence a new beginning to be big again
inside them, they go on to their last ending in beginning, they are
always a little weaker in living, they are always to their last
ending busy with beginning. Some of this part of that kind of men
have it in them to be big in their beginning, to have then a kind
of greatness in them in the feeling they have inside them with
beginning, and then it turns into an empty nothing in them,
sometimes it turns into a blown up feeling in them, sometimes into
a full emptiness that is then all there is of them then and keeps
on so inside them to their ending. They are some then who keep on
to their last minute with beginning, they are always a little
weaker in their living, they are always to their last ending busy
with beginning. There are some of the kind of men, the kind that
have beginning as the strongest thing inside them, there are many
of them many of the many millions of them, there are many of them
who so sometime keep on going keep on going a little time with some
one thing they have had in them as beginning; there are some who
sometime keep on going with something they sometime had as a
beginning, keep on going with it then to their ending. These are
some of the many millions of such a kind of men who have it in them
to be as big in their feeling as all the world around them. There
are some of such a kind of men who have it in them to push some one
thing through to an ending something they have sometime had as a
beginning, there are some of the many millions of this kind of men
who have it in them to push several things through to an ending
several things that they have had as a beginning in them. There are
some who have something strong inside them that pushes through to
an ending what they have in them as a beginning, some have such a
success in them. Some have some time almost a success in them, some
have something almost as a success inside them and then it breaks
down in them, some of such of them try then with a new beginning,
some of such of them break down inside them and there is then an
end to them. Some have the beginning feeling in them turn into
impatient feeling inside them as David Hersland had it in him. All
of all the many millions of such a kind of men have it in them some
time to be in them as big as all the world in their feeling, they
have it in them all of them to be strong in all beginning. David
Hersland had a mixture in him and this will come out clearly in the
history of him. As I was saying the biggest time in his living was
when he was in Gossols near the end of that beginning when he was
making his great fortune, when his wife was still in him as a
tender feeling, when the important feeling she had in her then was
a kind of joke to him, when she was not important to him but was
not yet a trouble to him with letting the children be too strong
for her to have them inside her to him, when his children were
first beginning to have a little in them of an individual being. At
the end of this beginning in him before he came to be full up with
impatient feeling there was beginning in him impatient feeling,
then his children were beginning not any longer to be part of their
mother to him, they were beginning to be part of the world around
him that he was domineering, fighting, brushing away from before
him, sometimes breaking away from and leaving though he never knew
this of himself in him, there was beginning then in him impatient
feeling and in a joking way with a little irritation in him he
brushed his wife away from before him, he was fighting then or
domineering the men around him in his business living or brushing
them away from around him or taking another way in a blustering
fashion so as not to be beaten by them. This was at the beginning
of the ending of his great beginning and this was when his wife had
strongest in her her own important feeling. In the beginning of his
great beginning he had a little of impatient feeling in him, always
ever since he had had finished in him the adolescent being he had
had a little impatient feeling in him but up to the beginning of
the ending of his big beginning it had not had very much irritation
in it for him or for others around him, he was hearty then and
everything was in him then in his feeling, he was strong then in
beginning, the world around him then to him was all every moment in
beginning and he was it and it was all in him, and he was strong
then and full up with beginning.</p>

<p>When a man is in the middle of his living it is very hard for
any one who knows him, hard for himself or for others around him,
for the men around him or his wife or other women or his children
or the children who play with them, hard for any one of them to
know him. Later in his living when it comes to be inside him that
it all settles down inside him and he begins repeating in him the
whole thing he is then it is then easy to begin to know him, any
one who stays with him then can learn to know the kind of man he is
then. When a man is in the middle of his living it is very hard to
know him. Mostly with women in the middle of their living it is not
so hard to know them, it is in them when they are young women that
they are like a man in the middle of his living. Anyhow it is very
hard to know of most men and to know it in many women in the middle
of their living what there is in them, what there is as a bottom to
them, what there is mixed up inside them. Slowly, more and more,
one gets to know them as repeating comes out in them. In the middle
of their living they are always repeating, everybody always is
repeating in all of their whole living but in the middle of the
living of most men and many women it is hard to be sure about them
just what it is they are repeating, they are in their living saying
many things then and it is hard to know it about them then what it
is in them they are repeating that later in their living will show
itself to be the whole of them to any one who wants to watch them.
Babies in repeating have not very many different kinds of ways of
doing it in them but growing old men and women in repeating show
the kind of men, the kind of women that is in them. They show it in
them then which they are of the many kinds of men and women.
Perhaps babies have it in them to be each one a little different
from all the other babies that are always being made but they have
not it in them to have so many different kinds of them as men and
women have it in them. Babies have not it in them to show much to
any one who sees them in their repeating the kind they are then.
There are not so many kinds of babies as there are kinds of men and
women. Growing old men and women have in them the kind they are of
men and women and that comes out to any one that stays with them in
the repeating that more and more then repeats the whole of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. David Hersland in his middle living was in Gossols making
his great fortune. He had many things then in him, his living with
men around him in his business living, his living with his wife,
his knowing other men and women, his living on the ten acre place
in that part of Gossols where no other rich people were living his
living on the ten acre place with his wife and children and
governess and servants there in the house with him and with poor
people in small houses near them. All these then came to know him,
there was not then in him yet the certain repeating that makes
older men and older women clear to every one that looks long at
them, there was in him then all that later would break down into
repeating. There was for him then his business living, there was
for him then his children beginning to have in them individual
being, there was for him then his wife and she was having in her
then her most important feeling. Every one who then saw him came a
little then to know him but it was not easy then for them and this
is a history of how each one of them then felt him. There was a
mixture in him of several ways in which his kind of men have it in
them to work out in them the beginning which is the strongest thing
in them and the feeling themselves as big as all the world around
them. This mixture in him had many ways of coming out in him, in
the middle of his living. It was not easy to know it certainly
about him then which mixture was most him, always it came out a
good deal in him to everybody who saw him or knew him then that he
was a man who was in feeling himself inside him as big as all the
world around him, that he was the kind of man who has it in him the
being strong in beginning. In his middle living it was hard to tell
which kind of a way this would work out in him, whether he had it
in him to push on to succeeding in some one thing, whether
something in him would push itself through to success through all
the beginnings in him, whether it would each time break down in
him, whether he would break down into weakness inside him, whether
several things would come to a finish that he had as beginnings in
him, whether all beginning in him would change off into another
beginning, whether he would become bland inside him, whether the
beginnings in him would break down into impatient feeling, whether
there would be several of these things in him. In his middle living
not any one could tell anything of this certainly about him. As I
have said once, to the people living in the small houses near them
he was then in the big middle of his living, he was, in the
beginning of their knowing him, to them, a queer man, with his big
ways in buying and his way of owning everything around him to his
feeling, they never then had trouble with him, he was then a good
neighbor for them to have near them, a rich man to buy from them,
they liked him but they had not then any personal feeling for him,
he had queer ways in him but they laughed pleasantly for him for he
was a rich man and they had a respect for him, he was a good
neighbor to any of them who asked him to do anything for them, he
was prompt in paying, he was large in buying, he was apart from
them, they knew then nothing more about him, his children were a
little of them then the people around him then, his wife lived
among them the people around him then but above them in her country
house feeling, Mr. Hersland was to them a city man and he had a
home near them in that part of Gossols where no other rich people
were living, to them then he was not living among them, he was a
city man to them. They were as I have said about them, these people
in the small houses near him, they were in their being half city
and half country people. He was to them in the first beginning of
their knowing him, a city man for their half country feeling.
Slowly they came to know more about him in his country living, they
first learned to know more about him as a man with a country house
feeling in him, then it came to be for them that they knew him as a
city man with a little country living in him, later in his later
living they came to know in him city being with their half city
feeling and this was for them the end of his living, the end of his
being among them. All men and all women, if they keep on in their
living come to the repeating that makes it clear to anyone who
listens to them then the real nature of them. In the middle living
of most men and many women it is very hard to know them, with some
of them it is much harder than with others of them. With women,
mostly, it is easier to know them then, for there is with them in
their middle living less complete mixing of the natures in them
than in most men. They, many women, have not in their middle living
so much in their way of being to make it all inside them mix into a
whole as most men have it in them in their middle living, they have
less in the conditions of their living to make the natures in them
mix together with the bottom nature of them to make a whole of them
than most men have it then in them. In their middle living there is
stronger in them the simple repeating that makes them clear to any
one who stays with them, with most of them any one who watches them
then can come to know them. With most men, though many millions of
the many kinds of them have this less in them, most kinds of men in
their middle living are mixed up then to be a whole thing then and
so it is harder then to be sure with them what is the bottom nature
in them, how far this bottom nature of them will drive them; and so
children can not tell it of them then how far anger in a father
will drive him, girls cannot tell it in a man then how far a
feeling in him will bring him, business men and men working with
him or under him, men he is directing, men who are fighting him,
they are like his children, they are never certain in his middle
living how far the power in him will carry him, then it begins a
little more to break down into repeating in him, then more and more
they see it in him just how far the nature in him will carry him,
and so more and more then it breaks down into repeating in him and
this goes on to the last end of him. His wife, a wife living with a
man, knows it earlier about him in her feeling what is the bottom
nature of him, knows it sooner about him than his children or the
men who are with him in his business living. In the relation a wife
has with a man, in loving, in eating, in drinking, in sleeping, in
doctoring, there is more simple repeating, and so the wife living
with him comes sooner to feel it in him in his middle living what
will come to be later his repeating than any one else who can then
know him. Mostly she knows it about him just at the beginning of
his middle living, mostly no one else comes to be sure about it in
him until toward the beginning of the ending of his middle living.
This in a wife, most often, is mostly not a conscious feeling but
she has it in her to know about him how far the feeling in him will
drive him.</p>

<p>One never can know certainly in any one the nature of him when
he is a boy or a young man for then there are many things to drive
him that are not the nature of him, in the middle living it is only
the nature in him that will drive him and this will come out then
always more and more in him as he begins then at the beginning of
the ending of his middle living to repeat more and more the whole
of him.</p>

<p>With Mr. David Hersland then in his middle living, the men who
were working with him, the men who were working under him, they all
knew it about him that he was as big as all out doors in his
feeling inside him, they knew it about him that he was strong in
beginning, they never knew it about him then so that they could be
certain then in them how far anything in him would go to an ending,
how far the nature in him might drive him, how far there would be
success in him, if there ever would come to him a breaking down
inside him, what it would be that would fill him in his later
living, what would be the repeating in his later living that would
show the nature in him. His children had it in them to know it
sooner about him than the men in his business living, they knew it
sooner about him how strong it was beginning to be in him in his
middle living that his beginning would break down into impatient
feeling. They knew this about him sooner than the men with him in
his business living, they knew it sooner about him how far his
nature would take him, they learnt it about him from the anger in
him but this to them too was in the beginning of the ending of his
middle living. They soon knew then that his beginning would break
down into impatient feeling, later they learned it about him that
the anger in him would never carry him to any last act against
them.</p>

<p>Some of the men who were in business living with Mr. Hersland
were always afraid of him, afraid of the big ways in him, afraid of
his way of strongly fighting, afraid of the big beginning in him,
all through their being with him in business living they were
afraid of him, they were afraid when with him when he would be
beginning things with them. Later they would think, if it ever came
that there was an ending in him in his success in making a great
fortune, they would perhaps think then that they had always known
this about him but in his middle living they could not know it of
him, no one could then know it about him which way the beginning in
him would work out through him. There was in him then for every one
who knew him in his business living the being great in beginning,
there was in him always then strong fighting, there was in him then
brushing people away from before him, there was a little in him
then a turning away from some of them in a blustering fashion as if
he were brushing them away from around him though really then he
was going away from them so that he could not know it in him that
he could not brush them away from before him, there was in him a
hearty way of laughing, a strong way of fighting, there was in him
his business living, then in the middle of his living very little
impatient feeling such as his children just about then were
beginning then to know in him. In his middle living in his business
working what was for his children impatient feeling in him in their
troubles with him was for the men around him strong beginning,
strong fighting, brushing people away from before him. All of them
knew it about him that he was as big as all the world in his
feeling, the men around him in his business living knew this in him
because of his big way of seeing, his children felt it in him in
the trouble they had in them when they were walking with him and
they were ashamed because of the queer ways he had of doing.</p>

<p>There were many different kinds of men that knew Mr. Hersland in
his business Jiving and they had many different ways of feeling
about the ways he had in him, about his strong beginnings, about
his fighting everybody who was not to his feeling in him, about
brushing people away from before him when he was going on with his
beginning and full up with big feeling. Some as I was saying felt
him to be a dangerous man for them, some of these went with him in
beginning and then they liked it better to do their own finishing,
for them even when he was carrying a beginning through perhaps to
an ending the carrying it on by him had for them too much in it of
beginning to ever be a comfort to them, some of these then did not
fight him they began with him and then they went on in their own
way to an ending. He would be then full up with beginning and with
fighting, he might be going on too from the same beginning that he
had begun together with them, he might be going on too to an ending
but with him going on had always in it something of beginning and
they left it to him to go on alone with his big feeling. They went
on to their own ending. He was strong in fighting but as I was
saying he had it in him to turn away in fighting into another
direction in a blustering fashion and he never knew it in him that
the nature in him would not carry him to the last fighting. He was
strong in fighting and he liked it for he felt his strength then in
him. He was strong in fighting he was not so strong in winning,
more and more then at the ending of his middle living fighting in
him turned into impatient feeling inside him, more and more then
fighting in him in his late living broke down into weakness inside
him. As I was saying he was strong in fighting, he was strong in
brushing people away from before him. He would have in him then
when he was fighting all the joy of being full up with beginning,
he would have then when he was brushing people away from around him
all the big feeling of being as big as all the world, inside him.
When he was fighting, when he was brushing people away from before
him, he was to himself then as if the whole world was in him, he
was it, it was in him, there was not any difference then for him of
him and all the world around him. It was a very joyous thing in him
this big feeling, everybody who saw him felt it in him, his
children it made uncomfortable when they were out with him. The big
feeling in him was not in him a big empty feeling, it was to him to
be always strong in fighting, not so strong in winning, sometimes
then in a blustering fashion he would go another way out of
fighting, to himself then always it was that he was brushing others
away from him, he never knew it in him that he went in this way out
of fighting till his children told him when in his later living his
impatient feeling made them angry with him.</p>

<p>It was a very joyous thing in him this big feeling in him,
everybody who saw him felt it in him. Everybody who had anything to
do with him had a very strong feeling in them about this big
feeling in him. As I was saying every one of the many millions of
this kind of men have it in them to have some time inside them a
big feeling, a feeling of themselves inside them as big as all the
world around them. In many of the millions of this kind of men such
a big feeling is in them only as beginning inside them it never
works out to a finish through them. Some of such a kind of men have
it in them to work it through to a finish to a complete thing the
big feeling that was in them. There have not been many millions of
the many millions of the kind of men the kind that have such a kind
of big feeling some time in them who work it out to an ending, in
some of them it remains in them as beginning and they never lose it
out of them and so it is a strong thing always in them, yes some
have it in them through all their living to keep a thing in them in
beginning it is always big inside them it is always as a beginning
in them it never breaks down into weakness in them it never breaks
down into new beginnings inside them it never breaks down into
impatient feeling in them, it never comes to be swelled out and
then empty in them it remains in them as big as the feeling in them
of being as big as all the world inside them to their feeling, it
remains in them always as a big beginning. Mr. David Hersland in
his being had a mixture in him. There was in him all through his
living a big beginning that was always in him to the last moment of
his living, more and more in his later living it did not fill him,
more and more toward the end of his middle living he was filled up
with impatient feeling and the big beginning that was always in him
to his ending was not important in him to those who then knew him,
more and more to everyone then around him there was to him only
impatient feeling but always in him to every one who knew him there
was even when he was full up with impatient feeling there was
always in him a big thing inside him there was in him a big
beginning inside him. And this was in him, a big beginning, until
the last of his living. Later in his living when he was shrunk away
from the outside of him, when he needed women inside him to fill
him, when his impatient feeling had broken down into weakness in
him there was still spread out inside him a big feeling and that
was the beginning always in him, the beginning that always was in
him all through his living. In his middle living then there were
many ways of feeling this mixture in him by every one who then knew
him. As I was saying there were many then who felt this big
beginning in him and they also felt the danger in him of his strong
fighting, fighting that did not carry the beginning in him to an
ending, fighting that to his children was impatient feeling, that
to some men who fought against him was a blustering turning away
from them, that to some other men near him meant a brushing of them
away from around him that to some men meant a living thing that
they admired in him for it gave to such men a feeling of living
inside them, that meant to some women a weakness in him so that
they felt it in them that they could manage him by ingratiating
diplomatic domineering&mdash;mostly in his middle living he brushed
these away from around him but they did not lose then the feeling
they had in them about him,&mdash;that meant to poor people near
him a hearty nature in him, that meant to his children in their
younger living a thing to make them ashamed when they were walking
with him sometimes made them afraid of him and then in his later
living made them angry with him and in his latest living made them
take care of him, made his wife feel her power with him and
sometimes feel she had no importance for him, made him to the
governesses and servants in the house with him a man who would not
interfere with them for they could not feel a power in him for the
feeling in him to them that in his business living made strong
fighting in him they saw it in him in the daily living in the house
with him they saw that it used itself up without touching the
people he was fighting, there was to them no contact in him and so
in the household living he did not count for them, it was Mrs.
Hersland who was important for them.</p>

<p>In his business living, among the men who knew him, some were
afraid of him, they were mostly not afraid to fight with him they
felt it in them that he was strong in fighting and that most of the
fighting would hit him, there were many then who were not afraid to
fight against him for mostly people felt in him in his middle
living that there was no danger in him for people he was fighting,
dimly they knew it in them almost every one who then knew him that
nothing in him would carry him to any last act against them there
was no danger for them then they mostly all of them felt it so then
inside them those with whom he was fighting, those whom he was
brushing away from around him; those who felt he was a dangerous
man to have with them were men who were with him in his big
beginnings and they felt in them even when he was going onward from
a beginning they felt it in them that his going on had in it too
much beginning to make them feel safe with him, so mostly they
would then after a big beginning with him go their own way to
ending, they would leave him with the big beginning always in him,
they would leave him to his strong fighting to his brushing of
people away from him to his going another way away from the man in
front of him in his blustering fashion that was to himself a
brushing away of the people around him.</p>

<p>He was strong then in beginning, he was strong in fighting, he
was always changing, he was very strong in fighting. In his
business living this came out in him, it came out in him in all his
living, it came out in him in his ways of eating, in his ways of
doctoring, in his ways of educating his children. In his business
living no one went with him to an ending, always they would
somewhere leave him and go on to their own finishing. To the end of
his business living he had in him a big beginning, this never broke
down into weakness inside him, this never broke down into impatient
feeling, he was full then in his later living with impatient
feeling and then later with weakness inside him but always in him
too was a big beginning and this was in him to his ending. Mostly
all the men in business with him went on to their own ending, some
later when he was no longer living brought to a finish his big
beginning but mostly all of them who were with him in his business
living were with him in beginning and then they left him to his
fighting, to his brushing people away from around him, to his going
away from them in a blustering fashion which was to himself
brushing them away from before him. In his younger living when he
was working with older men above him he would be brought through
them to finish out a beginning he had in him. He was always strong
in fighting but then his being strong in beginning with others to
bring it to an ending through him made him a big man to all then
around him. Later in his living every one mostly left him to his
fighting, to his brushing people away from around him to his going
another way when as it mostly happened in him the nature in him did
not carry him to the last end of fighting.</p>

<p>As I was saying men working with him in his business living
mostly went their own way to an ending of the things they began
with him. Mostly to all of them there was danger to them in his way
of going on to an ending. There was for them too much of beginning
in his way of ending. Those who followed with admiration in them
were mostly men who had not enough in them of themselves inside
them to begin a big thing with him, they were outside him they were
outside his business living, they were full of admiration for him,
they felt in them part of the big feeling of being as big as all
the world around them when they were with him. These men were to
him like the people in the small houses near him, in that part of
Gossols where no other rich people were living, except that they
came closer to him, they were not important to him they were not
inside him for him but they were a comfort to him, they liked to
know he had been fighting, they liked to know he had been brushing
people away from around him, they were always there for him, they
were not inside him to him, they were not important to him to his
feeling, but they made a kind of support around him when he was
resting up from fighting, they made a kind of cushion for him to
keep him from knowing when he was through with fighting that he had
not been winning. They were beginning to be important to him at the
beginning of the ending of his middle living, earlier in his living
they were all to him as the people in the small houses near him, in
his country house living, he was hearty for them, he was a good
neighbor to any one, he was good to do things for any one of them
who asked him to do things for them. Some of them in the beginning
of the ending of his middle living were more and more important to
him as padding, not to fill him but to keep him from knowing it in
himself that he was not strong in winning that the nature in him
would not carry him to the last end of fighting which is winning,
that when he turned away in a blustering fashion he was not
brushing people away from him. He never knew it inside him that he
was not brushing people away from around him when he went away from
them in another direction in a blustering fashion until his
children in his later living when they were angry with him for his
impatient feeling said it to him. These men then in the beginning
of the ending of his middle living were beginning to be important
to him, they were then a padding, to him not inside him but around
him. These men, some of them then, came to be in him a little like
a tender feeling then when his wife was no longer in him as a
tender feeling, they knew it always of him that he had a big
beginning in him&mdash;that this was in him even when he was full
up with impatient feeling&mdash;when later he was shrunk away from
the outside of him, they always knew him to be strong in fighting
and this in him made a strong living feeling always inside them to
know him. In the beginning of the ending of his middle living some
of such men were a little important to him. As I was saying his
children knew it sooner of him than the business men around him
that he was full up with impatient feeling that the fighting in him
would break down into impatient feeling, they knew it sooner about
him than the business men around him that the anger in him would
not carry him to any last act against them. His wife as I was
saying knew it in her feeling sooner than the business men around
him sooner than his children how far the nature in him would carry
him, knew it sooner in her feeling how she could manage him, knew
it in her feeling how in a way she was not important to him though
this last never came to be a conscious feeling till at the ending
of his middle living. The governess and servants in the house with
him, as I was saying, liked him then in his middle living for his
hearty laughing and the big ways he had of buying but they never
felt in contact with him, his wife and his children were more real
to all of them, this was true of all of them the servants and the
governesses as they lived in the house with them, there was less of
such a feeling in the governess Madeleine Wyman who was the
governess they had with them in the beginning of the ending of Mr.
Hersland's middle living, in the time when Mrs. Hersland had inside
her the most important feeling of herself to herself in her
feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. David Hersland then in his home living had always new ideas
about ways of eating, ways of doctoring, ways of educating
children, sometimes in a stubborn way he would go on a long time
with some one way of them but this was mostly well at the end of
his middle living, when his wife was not any longer strong in him,
when she was no longer a tender feeling in him, when she was not
any longer important to him. His wife had sooner in her than any
one that knew him a feeling of how far the nature in him would
carry him. She knew this in her from living with him as a wife to
him, from the simple repeating that a man has in him for the woman
who is a wife to him. He never felt it in him as a judgment of him
this feeling that made her know about him how far the nature in him
would carry him, she was to him never a thing outside him excepting
when she was a kind of joke to him, she was always to him inside
him, she never had for him any importance for him in her being
outside of him, in such a part of her being she was either a joke
to him or she was not important to him or he brushed her away from
around him. The men around him in his business living never made
him feel in him how far the nature in him would carry him, to
himself with them he was strong in fighting with them or against
them or he was brushing them away from around him or they were not
important to him. The governesses and servants and the for him poor
people near him were never important to him excepting perhaps in
his later living when he was shrunk away from the outside of him
and he needed a woman inside to fill him and this was beginning a
little in him in the beginning of the ending of his middle living,
or else when there were some of them in him a little in his later
living as a tender feeling as earlier his wife had been in him to
him, or as they were in the beginning of the ending of his middle
living important as a padding to him. So he never knew it in him
how far the nature in him could carry him, how he could not come to
the last end of fighting, he never knew it inside him that he was
not brushing people away from around him when he went away from
them in another direction in a blustering fashion until his
children in his later living when they were angry with him for his
impatient feeling said it to him. His children were for him not so
completely outside him as business men around him, they were not in
him as his wife was in him and as later some women and some men
were in him, they were not of no importance to him inside him as
some men and some women and the governesses and servants and people
living near him were to him, they were outside him, they could get
at him, in his later living when they were angry with him because
of his being full up then with impatient feeling they told him what
they thought of him, they made him feel it then inside him and this
was all in the ending of his middle living.<br>

<h2>3. [Mrs. Hersland and the Hersland Children]</h2>

<p>A man in his living has many things inside him, he has in him
his important feeling of himself to himself inside him, he has in
him the kind of important feeling of himself to himself that makes
his kind of man; this comes sometimes from a mixture in him of all
the kinds of natures in him, this comes sometimes from the bottom
nature in him, this comes sometimes from the natures in him that
are in him that are sometime in him mixed up with the bottom nature
in him, sometimes in some men this other nature or natures in him
are not mixed with the bottom nature in him at any time in his
living many of such men have the important feeling of themselves
inside them coming from the other nature or natures in them not
from the bottom nature of them.</p>

<p>Many men have sometime in their living the important feeling of
themselves to themselves inside them, some men have always this
feeling inside them, most men have such a feeling more or less in
them, perhaps all men and mostly all women have sometime in them a
feeling of themselves to themselves inside them; this comes
sometimes from a mixture in them of the kind of natures in them,
this comes sometimes from the bottom nature of them, this comes
sometimes from the natures in them that are mixed up with the
bottom natures of them, sometimes in some of them the other nature
or natures in them are not mixed with the bottom nature in them,
many of such of them have the important feeling of themselves
inside them coming from the other natures not from the bottom
nature of them.</p>

<p>Mostly all men in their living have many things inside them. As
I have just been saying the feeling of themselves inside them can
come in different ways from the inside of them, can come in
different ways in some of the many millions of one kind of men from
the other millions of that same kind of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>A man in his living has many things inside him. He has in him
his feeling himself important to himself inside him, he has in him
his way of beginning; this can come too from a mixture in him, from
the bottom nature of him, from the nature or natures in him more or
less mixed up with the bottom in him, in some, though mostly in all
of them the bottom nature in them makes for them their way of
beginning, in some of each kind of men the other nature or natures
in them makes for them their way of beginning.</p>

<p>Men in their living have many things inside them, they have in
them, each one of them has it in him, his own way of feeling
himself important inside in him, they have in them all of them
their own way of beginning, their own way of ending, their own way
of working, their own way of having loving inside them and loving
come out from them, their own way of having anger inside them and
letting their anger come out from inside them, their own way of
eating, their own way of drinking, their own way of sleeping, their
own way of doctoring. They have each one of them their own way of
fighting, they have in them all of them their own way of having
fear in them. They have all of them in them their own way of
believing, their own way of being important inside them, their own
way of showing to others around them the important feeling inside
in them.</p>

<p>In all of them in all the things that are in them in their daily
living, in all of them in all the things that are in them from
their beginning to their ending, some of the things always in them
are stronger in them than the other things too always in them. In
all of them then there are always all these things in them, ways of
being are in all of them, in some of the many millions of each kind
of them some of the things in them are stronger in them than others
of them in them.</p>

<p>In all of them then in all the things that are in them in their
daily living, in all of them in all the things that are in them
from their beginning to their ending,&mdash;in all of them then
there are always all these things in them,&mdash;in some of the
many millions of each kind of them some of the things are stronger
in them than others of them.</p>

<p>There are then many kinds of men and many millions of each kind
of them. In many men there is a mixture in them, there is in them
the bottom nature in them of their kind of men the nature that
makes their kind of thinking, their kind of eating, of drinking and
of loving, their kind of beginning and ending, there is then in
many men this bottom nature in them of their kind of men and there
is mixed up in them the nature of other kinds of men, natures that
are a bottom nature in other men and makes of such men that kind of
man.</p>

<p>In many men there is a mixture in them, there is in them the
bottom nature in them the nature of their kind of men and there is
mixed up in each one of them the nature or natures of other kind of
men, natures that are each one of them a bottom nature in some of
the many millions that there are of men and make of such men that
kind of man.</p>

<p>In all the things that are in all men in all of their living
from their beginning to their ending there can be as the impulse of
them the bottom nature in them, the mixture in them of other nature
or natures with the bottom nature, the nature or other natures in
them which in some men of the many millions of each kind of men
never really mix up with the bottom nature in them. Some of the
things all men have in them in their daily living have it to come,
in more men, only from the bottom nature in them than other things
in them. Nothing of all the things all men have in them in their
daily living comes in all men from the bottom nature of them.
Eating, drinking, loving, anger in them, beginning and ending in
them, come more from many men from the bottom nature of most of
them than other things in them but always there are some men of all
the millions of each kind of them who have it in them not to have
even eating and drinking and doctoring and loving and anger in them
and beginning and ending in them come from the bottom nature of
them.</p>

<p>David Hersland had a mixture in him. He had as I was saying a
big beginning in him a feeling of himself to himself of being as
big as all the world around him. As I was saying he had a big
beginning feeling in him all through his living to his ending. As I
was saying his wife knew it about him in her feeling. She did not
have it as a conscious thing in her in him but she felt it about
him even before his children felt it in him, how far the nature in
him would carry him.</p>

<p>As I was saying, in ways of eating, in ways of drinking, in ways
of loving, in ways of letting anger come out from them about little
things in their daily living, in ways of sleeping, in ways of
doctoring, there is more, in strong middle living, of simple
repeating than in other things in the middle living of vigorous
active men and women. At the beginning of the ending of the middle
living of vigorous active men and women, ways of thinking, ways of
working, ways of beginning, ways of ending, ways of believing come
to be in them as simple repeating.</p>

<p>In all men as I have been saying there are their own ways of
being, in them. In some men some of their ways of being that more
and more in their later living settle down into simple repeating
some of their ways of being come from the bottom nature of them.
There are some men of all the millions always being made of men
there are some men who have only in them a bottom nature to them.
From such men, and in all the millions of every kind of men some of
the millions of each kind of them are such a kind of men they have
in them only a bottom nature to them, all their ways of being come
in such men, some of the millions of each kind of men, come all
from the nature that makes their kind of men that makes the kind of
men that have all of them in them as bottom nature in them their
way of thinking, of eating, of drinking, of sleeping, of loving, of
having angry feeling in them, their way of beginning and of ending.
Every man has in him his own way of feeling about it inside him
about his ways of doing the things that make for him his daily
living; that is the individual feeling in him, that is the feeling
of being to himself inside him, that is in many the feeling of
being important to themselves inside them, that is in some men a
feeling of being important to every one around them, that is in
some men a feeling of being as big as all the world around
them.</p>

<p>David Hersland was of such a kind of men, men who have sometime
in them a feeling of being as big as all the world around them.
David Hersland had a mixture in him. He mostly came all together
from the bottom nature in him but there was in him too a mixture in
him, and this made him, in his later living, full up with impatient
feeling. There was in him a mixture in him but with him it made a
whole of him.</p>

<p>As I was saying some men have it in them to be made altogether
of the bottom nature that makes their kind of men. Some have it in
them to have other nature or natures in them, natures that are the
bottom nature to make other kinds of men, and this nature or
natures in them mixes up well with the bottom nature of them to
make a whole of them as when things are cooked to make a whole dish
that is together then. Some have other nature or natures only as a
flavor to them, the bottom nature is mostly the whole of them, some
have other nature or natures in them that never mix with the bottom
nature in them and in such ones the impulse in them comes from the
bottom nature or from the other natures separate from each other
and from the bottom nature in them, in some of them there is in
them so little of the bottom nature in them that mostly everything
that comes out from inside them comes out from the other nature or
natures in them not from the bottom nature in them. There are many
things in every man in his living from his beginning to his ending.
Some of the things in men have it in them to come more from the
bottom nature of them than the other things in them but there are
some men of the millions of every kind of men that have it in them
to have almost nothing coming from the bottom nature of them. Some
of the things in men have it to come from the bottom nature of men
but there are some men of the many millions of every kind of men
that have it in them to have nothing coming from the bottom nature
of them. Some of the things in men have it in them to come more
from the bottom nature of them, some of the things in men have it
in them to come in more men not from the bottom nature of them.
Some of the things in men have it in them to come more from the
bottom nature of them but there are some men of the many millions
of every kind of men that have it in them to have almost nothing
coming from the bottom nature of them. There is from this on every
kind of mixing in men. There is from that every kind of mixing and
every kind of keeping separate of the natures in men; in some of
the millions of every kind of men there is almost nothing in them
in their living of the bottom nature of them, from that there is
every kind of keeping separate and every kind of mixing of the
natures in men to those millions of every kind of men who have in
them only the bottom nature of their kind of men and have almost
nothing in them of other kind of nature or natures in them. There
is in men every kind of mixing and every kind of keeping separate
of the natures in them. There are men who have nothing in them in
their living of the bottom nature of them that makes their kind of
men, there are men who have in them nothing of any nature in them
excepting the bottom nature of them. There is from that every kind
of mixing and every kind of keeping separate of the natures in men,
from some men some of the millions of every kind of men with
nothing in them in their living of the bottom nature of them to
those millions of every kind of men who have in them only the
bottom nature of their kind of men and have almost nothing in them
of other kinds of nature or natures in them.</p>

<p>As I was saying men have in them their individual feeling in
their way of feeling it in them about themselves to themselves
inside them about the ways of being they have in them. Some have
almost nothing of such a feeling in them, some have it a little in
them, some have it in them always as a conscious feeling, some have
it as a feeling of themselves inside them, some have it as a
feeling of themselves inside them as important to them, some have
it as a feeling of being important to themselves inside them as
being always in them, some have it as being important to the others
around them, some have it as being inside them that there is
nothing existing except their kind of living, some have it that
they feel themselves inside them as big as all the world around
them, some have it that they are themselves the only important
existing in the world then and in some of them for forever in
them&mdash;these have in them the complete thing of being important
to themselves inside them. As I was saying in his middle living a
man is more simple in his repeating of it in him of his ways of
eating, ways of drinking, ways of doctoring, ways of loving, ways
of sleeping, ways of walking, ways of having anger inside him than
in his ways of having other things in him. A man in his middle
living has in him already then simple repeating. It comes then that
in his daily living often his wife has it earlier in her feeling
how far the nature in him will carry him than anybody around him,
not in her conscious feeling, not when she is talking about him,
but in her feeling in her living with him. David Hersland in his
daily living had many things in him. He had his own way of loving.
The way a man has of thinking, his way of beginning and his way of
ending in most of the millions of every kind of men comes more from
the bottom nature in him from the way of loving he has in him and
that makes his kind of man, other natures are mixed up in him, but
mostly his way of loving goes with his way of thinking goes with
the kind of practical nature he has in him, goes with his way of
working, comes from the bottom nature in him.</p>

<p>Some men have it in them in their loving to be attacking, some
have it in them to let things sink into them, some let themselves
wallow in their feeling and get strength in them from the wallowing
they have in loving, some in loving are melting&mdash;strength
passes out from them, some in their loving are worn out with the
nervous desire in them, some have it as a dissipation in them, some
have it as excitement in them, some have it as a clean attacking,
some have it in them as a daily living&mdash;some as they have
eating in them, some as they have drinking, some as they have
sleeping in them, some have it in them as believing, some have it
as a simple beginning feeling&mdash;some have it as the ending
always of them such of them are always old men in their loving.</p>

<p>Men and women have in them many ways of living,&mdash;their ways
of eating, their ways of drinking, their ways of thinking, their
ways of working, their way of sleeping, in most men and many women
go with the way of loving, come from the bottom nature in them.</p>

<p>Many as I was saying have not anything not their way of loving
not their way of thinking coming from the bottom nature in them but
coming from other nature or natures in them natures that are to
other men and women bottom nature in them and make of them that
kind of men and women. Many men and many women have their way of
loving and their way of thinking and their way of working come from
the mixture in them of other nature or natures with the bottom
nature in them. There are many kinds of men and there are many
kinds of women and some of the millions of each kind of them have
it to be made only of the bottom nature of their kind of them, some
have it in them to be made of more or less mixing inside them of
another nature or of other kinds of nature with the bottom nature
of them, some of them have it in them to have the loving feeling in
them with their ways of thinking coming from the other kind of
nature or other kind of natures in them not from the bottom nature
in them.</p>

<p>Mr. David Hersland had a mixture in him. His wife was in him in
his early middle living she was in him then as a tender feeling,
when she was outside of him to him she was a little a joke to him,
mostly she was not when outside him then important to him, later
she was a little important to him because of the children and her
resistance to him for them, then a little more and more then there
changed in him a feeling of her being a joke to him to his brushing
her away from around him, less and less then she was in him as a
tender feeling, less and less then was she important to him.</p>

<p>In his earlier living when she first was a wife to him she was a
little outside of him she could a little affect him she could a
little resist herself to him, she was then in him a beginning as a
tender feeling, she was then in him a little like a flower inside
him, she was a little then outside him to him, she was then a
little important to him as outside him, more and more then this
came to be a joke to him, later then she came to be brushed away
from around him.</p>

<p>David Hersland had a mixture in him. He was of the kind that
have loving in them always in beginning and a little in getting
strength from wallowing. In the beginning of his loving these two
were mixed up in him and his wife was to him more than beginning
more than a woman to him for his daily living she was a beautiful
thing to him, she was an amusement to him, she was a pleasure to
him to have resisting to him, she was a little in him as a tender
feeling. More and more in his living loving was to him beginning
until in his latest living he needed a woman to fill him, later
when he was shrunk away from the outside of him he needed a woman
with sympathetic diplomatic domineering to, entering into him, to
fill him, he was then shrunk away from the outside of him he was
not simple in attacking he was not really getting strength from
wallowing, loving was more and more to him as a beginning feeling.
Loving never came to be in him impatient feeling excepting when he
felt his wife as outside of him, inside him in her early living she
was a tender feeling in him, she was a gentle thing inside him, she
was full up with children for him, outside him in his early living
she was a pleasant resistance to him, she was a little a joke to
him, she could a little manage him by resisting to him, then it
came to be that a little more and more she was a tender feeling in
him, a little, more and more, she was outside him, she was then
more a joke to him when she was outside him for him, she was less
and less important to him in her little resistance to him, more and
more then she was no longer a tender feeling in him, more and more
then she was in him as eating and sleeping when she was inside him,
more and more then when she was outside him she was resisting for
the children more and more then he brushed her away from around him
for she was to him then only the children with no importance in her
for him and his children more and more were stronger to do their
own resisting were more and more important to be an irritation to
him in his daily living could less and less be brushed away from
before him by him. And so more and more it came to him that she was
in him like his eating and sleeping, she was less and less in him
as a tender feeling she was less and less important in him or to
him as outside him, she was less and less a joke to him, she was
less and less important to him as a resistance to him, she was less
and less part of his children to him, and she more and more died
away and left him and then she was not in any way important to him,
he needed more beginning in his loving feeling to fill him than
anything that she could give him, he mostly then forgot about her
and that was the end of her living. Loving was always then in the
ending of his middle living more and more in him a beginning
feeling, he did not then get strength in him from wallowing in
loving, he had not in him real attacking, he had in him in loving a
beginning feeling, more and more he needed a woman inside him to
fill him.</p>

<p>In his country house in his middle living he had in him in his
daily living eating and sleeping and drinking and loving and
impatient feeling and hearty laughing. He had his wife in the house
with him and his children and servants and a governess and near him
living in the small houses around the ten acre place where they
were living in that part of Gossols where no other rich people were
living he had, for him, poor people around him who all liked to
have him as a neighbor to them. In his home living he had to him in
him his feeling about ways of eating ways of doctoring ways of
educating his children, he had in him his wife who was sometimes
then in his middle living when his children were first beginning in
them their individual feeling resisting to him, she was then still
to him important for him, she was then still in him as a tender
feeling, she was then still to him when she was outside him a
pleasant joke to him, she could then still a little affect him by
resisting to him. She was then in her strongest feeling of being
important to herself inside her to her feeling, she was then in the
strongest living with a man to be a husband to her in the rich way
that was the natural way of being to her feeling, with her children
still inside her to her feeling, with servants and a governess and
a seamstress in the house with her in her daily living and she was
of their daily living but above them in her right feeling of rich
living, with around her the for her poor queer people near her,
with the occasional visiting from rich people who did not live near
her to disturb her from the life around her where she was cut off
from the right rich living that was the natural way of being for
her, and which made in her her feeling of being important to
herself inside her and so then in her middle living she had in her
the feeling stronger in her than any of her family who had gone on
living the life that was the natural way of living for her the
feeling of being important to herself inside her. As I was saying
men and women have many of them in them their individual
feeling&mdash;their way of feeling it in them about themselves to
themselves inside them about the ways of being they have in them.
Some have almost nothing of such a feeling in them, some have it a
little in them, some have it in them always as a conscious feeling,
some have it as a feeling of themselves inside them, some have it
as a feeling of themselves inside them as important to them, some
have it as a feeling of being important to themselves inside them
as being always in them, some have it as being important to the
others around them, some have it as being inside them that there is
nothing existing except their kind of living, some have it that
they feel themselves inside them as big as all the world around
them, some have it that they are themselves the only important
existing in the world then and in some of them for forever in
them&mdash;these have in them the complete thing of being important
to themselves inside them. Some have it as a feeling of being
important in them from things they are doing, from religion in
them, from the way of living they have in them, from the clothes
they have on them, from the way they have of eating, from the way
they have of drinking, from the way they have of sleeping, some
from the way loving comes out from them, some from the way anger
comes out of them, some have a feeling of importance in them from
the kind of living they have in them and the others around them
have in them, there are many ways of having a feeling of one's self
inside one, there are many ways of having an important feeling in
one, there are some who have in them a feeling of importance inside
but not a feeling of importance of themselves to themselves inside
them then, there are some who have inside them an important feeling
in them but not an individual feeling in them, there are many ways
for men and women to have themselves inside to them and this is a
history of some of them.</p>

<p>Mr. David Hersland had in him a feeling of being as big as all
the world around him, he had in him a strong feeling of beginning,
of fighting of brushing people away from around him, of hearty
laughing, in his middle living of pleasant every day living in his
country house living. He had an individual feeling in him but it
was the whole of him and the world around that was him to him, he
never had in him a splitting of himself to himself until his
children in his later living when they were angry with him for the
impatient feeling he had in him told him what they thought of him
told him how he never came to the right end of fighting which is
winning, told him how he went away from those in front of him when
to himself he was brushing people away from around him. David
Hersland had an individual feeling in him, it was being as big as
all the world around him, it was being big in beginning. In the
ending of his middle living his wife was not important to him, she
did not give to him anything in him of individual feeling. In the
ending of his middle living he got it more and more from his
children, a little from the governess and servants in the house
with him, a little from the people living near him. At the ending
of his middle living his wife was not any longer important to him
she no longer gave him to himself inside him individual
feeling.</p>

<p>Some men have it in them in their loving to be attacking, some
have it in them to let things sink into them, some let themselves
wallow in their feeling and get strength in them from the wallowing
they have in loving, some in love are melting&mdash;strength passes
out of them, some in their loving are worn out with the nervous
desire in them, some have it as a dissipation in them, some have it
as clean attacking, some have it as a beginning feeling&mdash;some
have such a feeling always in them, some have it as the ending
always of them, some always are children in their loving grimy
little dirt then fills them, some are boys in their loving all
their living&mdash;in their loving reckless attacking is strong in
them, some are always young men in their loving, some have it in
them like regular middle age living in them, some are old men in
loving and this is in them all through their living. There are many
kinds of loving in men, more and more this will be a history of
them, there are many ways for women to have loving in them this
will come out more and more in the history of women as it is here
to be written, there are many ways for men to have loving in them,
there are many ways that loving comes out from them, there are many
ways for women and for men to have loving in them, this is a
history of some of them, sometime there will be a history of all of
them. There are many kinds of men and many millions of each kind of
them, there are many ways of loving that men have in them and their
way of loving makes their kind of man, there are many ways of
loving in men and having loving come out from them and this comes
in many of them from the nature of them their bottom nature in them
that makes their kind of men, sometimes from the bottom nature in
them mixed with the other nature or natures in them natures that
are the bottom nature, the way of having loving in them, of other
kind of men. There are many ways of having loving in them in men,
there are many ways of having loving in them in women, more and
more there will be a history of them, sometime there will then be a
history of all of them.</p>

<p>David Hersland in his loving was of his kind of man having
loving as beginning in him having loving as getting strength from
wallowing, he was of his kind of man but loving was not very strong
in him. He was in his loving, of his kind of man, not very strong
in loving. Loving was in him always as a part of daily living but
was not so very strong in him, not so strong in him as in many
millions of h is kind of men, there was more in him of being strong
in beginning, of being to himself as big as all the world around
him.</p>

<p>In his beginning family living his wife was in him as a tender
feeling, she was a woman to him, she was a tender feeling inside
him, she was a little a resistance to him and a little a joke to
him, sometimes a leading for him for in her beginning with him she
had a little a power to control him but always this was less and
less in her for him.</p>

<p>David Hersland did not have it in him to be so strong in loving
as many men of his kind of men have it in them. Many men of his
kind of men have it in them to need the woman as a warm feeling
inside them and she has always then a power in her over him; all
men who have this nature in them the getting strength in wallowing
as the bottom nature of them and with a beginning feeling too
always then in them have it in them in their middle living to have
a woman in them in their feeling as a warm thing in them, in some
of them as a flower in them to their feeling; some have loving then
more and some less in their living. In his later living David
Hersland had more need of a woman in him but that was not to be as
his wife was in him a tender feeling a live thing in him it was to
fill him up where he had shrunk from the outside of him, it was
another kind of woman he needed then, not a beautiful thing inside
him to be in him as a tender feeling but a thing to be alive,
domineering, diplomatic, moving, entering under his skin by feeling
herself him managing him and important to him in her filling him
where he was shrunk away from the outside of him.</p>

<p>In the beginning of his living his wife was to him a certain
power for him, inside him a tender beautiful feeling in him,
outside him a joke to him and a resisting thing to him in little
things for the ways he had in him, always having children in her
for him.</p>

<p>There are many ways of family living, there are many ways of
being a man to a wife, to his children, and to the servants living
in the house with him, of being the wife to her husband in her
living, being to her children and to the servants and dependents of
her daily living, and then the children and then the servants to
all of them. Mr. Hersland had his way of feeling about Mrs.
Hersland and that is clear now in his feeling from the beginning to
the ending of his middle living and then she died away and left
him. In the beginning of his middle living she was a little a joke
to him in her resisting and she had a little power in him then for
the children, later she a little woman was with weakening inside in
her living was lost then among the father and the resisting
children, she was a little thing then to them and lost among them
and more and more then she was not important to them and then she
died away and left them. In her feeling for the servants and
governesses and seamstresses in her daily living she had more
feeling of herself to herself inside her in her feeling than in any
other part of her living. She was with them outside him to her
husband then, not very important to him, sometimes with her ways
with them then a little a joke to him but mostly she had her own
way then and then sometimes in a blustering fashion he let her do
her own way while to himself brushing her away from before him. In
her living with the servants and governess and seamstress in her
daily living she had a feeling of herself to herself inside her,
this was more of an individual being in her than ever had been in
her when she was leading with her own kind of people around her the
right rich living which was the natural way of being to her. She
never to herself was cut off from the living that was the natural
way of living to her but in her daily living that living did not
touch her, she had her daily living with only dependents around
her, she was of them and above them and that gave to her her
feeling of herself to herself inside her, cut off from the equal
living that was the natural way of living for her.</p>

<p>Her children in their younger living were to her still inside
her, later they never gave to her any feeling of being important to
herself inside her, more and more they were too large around her,
she could suffer but they were not important in her in her feeling
of herself inside her. Being important to one's self inside one.
Being lonesome inside one. Making the world small to one to lose
from one the lonesome feeling a big world feeling can make inside
any one who has not it in them to feel themselves as big as any
world can be around them. Being important inside one in religion
can help one loose from one the lonesome feeling a big world can
give to one. There are many ways of losing the lonesome feeling a
big world around can give to one. Many lose it before they know
they have one, many all their lives keep their world small and so
they never have in them such a lonesome feeling, some need religion
in them to keep them from being lost inside them from having too
much in them a lonesome feeling and a big world too big for them
around them, some have in them a superior sense that makes the big
world around them not strong enough to give then to them a lonesome
feeling inside them, some have just a busy feeling in them and that
keeps them from lonesome feeling in them, some never have it come
to them that there is a big world around them, there are many who
never have in them any such lonesome feeling inside them their
living fills them they and their family and the people around them,
but many in their living find it at some time in them that they
have a lonesome feeling in them; almost all men and almost all
women, and mostly all of them when they were children, have such a
kind of lonesome feeling at some moment in their living. The
important feeling of one's self to one inside one in one's living
is to have in one then not anything of such a lonesome feeling.
Sometimes in many women and some men it is not a lonesome feeling
it is a weakening in them and somebody then takes care of them, in
more women there is what might be a lonesome feeling as a weakening
in them and then some one takes care of them or they die away then
and so escape their lonesome feeling. Many women have it in them to
float off into weakening, to lose themselves in religion and so
escape from any lonesome feeling. Many women have it in them to
feel that it never can happen to them the last end of trouble for
them, they have in them the feeling that the world can never really
be too much for them, this in many of them is religion in them,
they are not important to themselves inside them, they are part of
the important thing and in that they can never have the last end of
evil coming to them, there are many women who have in them not an
important feeling of themselves to themselves inside them but they
have in them the sense that the last end of a bad thing cannot
destroy them, some one will take care of them, something will save
them, despair can never really fill them, they can never have in
them the complete sense of a lonesome feeling in them; it is like
the feeling Mrs. Hersland had in her in her feeling that she was
never really cut off from good rich right living which was the
natural way of being to her, the for her natural way of living.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland had in her different ways of having herself inside
her, of having important feeling in her. A feeling of herself
inside her would never have come to be in her if she had gone on
living in the way that was natural for her. Being important to
herself inside her first came to be a little in her from the
knowing Sophie Shilling and her sister Pauline Shilling and the
mother Mrs. Shilling, later it came to be stronger in her from the
living with the governesses and seamstresses and servants and
dependents and being with them but above them all the time every
moment of her living, not cut off to her feeling but really cut off
in her living from the rich living that was for her the natural way
of being.</p>

<p>Many women have in them the way of feeling that makes it for
them that the last end of a bad thing cannot come to them, the last
end of losing cannot come to them, the last end of trouble cannot
destroy them; many of such of them have not it in them to have an
important feeling of themselves to themselves inside them, they
have a feeling that they are a part of important being and the last
end of a bad thing cannot destroy them, despair never can fill
them, somehow something some one will then take care of them, the
last end of a bad thing can never to the feeling of such ones ever
come to really destroy them. Many of such ones have weakening in
them and some one then takes care of them or else they die away and
they never know it inside them that the last end of a bad thing has
destroyed them, to themselves then in dying despair does not fill
them, something to the last moment of their living something
someone to such of them then in the last moments of their living
will take care of them, but they are weakening and they are dead
then but they have not had the lonesome feeling, despair has not
ever been really inside them. Many have in them such a feeling,
many have it in them as a religion. Many women who have never in
them a really lonesome feeling have not it in them the thing that
keeps it out of them as weakening they have it in them as
resisting, they have it in them as superior feeling, they have it
in them as going on always in living, as managing everything that
can touch them, as being busy every moment with something, despair
can never fill such of them, they never have in them a really
lonesome feeling.</p>

<p>There are many ways then for many women not to have in them ever
in their living anything of a really lonesome feeling inside them.
There are then many ways of not having room in them for such a
lonesome feeling, there are many ways of losing it out of them when
it is a little in them, there are many ways of having such a
lonesome feeling, there are some ways of having such a lonesome
feeling always inside in one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland had in her then in her middle living a real
feeling of being important to herself inside her in her feeling. If
she had gone on in the living that was the natural way of being for
her this never would have come to be real inside her, this would
have been in her a real important feeling from the living that was
natural to her but never a really important feeling of herself to
herself inside her. She always would have had in her a feeling
inside her that in her mother came out in the dreary trickling that
was, almost all her later living, all that was of her. A little of
such a feeling there would have always been in the daughter if she
had gone on living the life that was the natural way of living for
her but such a feeling would never come to be in her as it never
came to be in her mother a feeling of herself to herself inside
her, a feeling of herself to herself as important inside her. Some
of her sisters and one brother had a little of the important
feeling of the father, he had had a being that in any kind of
living would have given a feeling of himself to himself as a
religion. Mrs. Hersland had not in her any such a thing inside her,
she had in her only the feeling that gave to her mother the dreary
trickling that made all her, this in the daughter never had in it
sadness and sorrow inside her it was in her a gentle pleasant timid
sometimes an angry sometimes hurt feeling in her, in the living
that was not the natural way of living for her it came to be inside
her a feeling of herself to herself as important in her.</p>

<p>She had then in her, in her middle living it was strongest
inside her, a feeling of herself to herself inside her. Once this
came to be in her almost a lonesome feeling inside her but it
really was not real enough in her, it did not come enough of itself
from inside her, it never came to be altogether really a lonesome
feeling in her.</p>

<p>There are very many ways for women to have loving in them, some
have loving in them for any one or anything that needs them, some
have loving in them from the need in them for some other one or for
something they see around them, some have a mixture in them. There
are some who have really not any loving in them. The kinds of
loving women have in them and the way it comes out from them makes
for them the bottom nature in them, makes them their kind of women
and there are always many millions made of each kind of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland like almost all women had different things in her
for loving. For her her children when they were little things
around her it was not to her that they had need of her they were to
her a part of her as if they were inside her, as they grew bigger
and had their individual living in the house with her as they did
not then need her to fight out their daily living with their father
they did not feel any importance in her, they were for her then no
longer a part of her, she had then weakening in her, she was a
little thing then and they were so large around her, they were then
struggling with themselves and with their living and with their
father, she was weakening then and more and more they were not a
part of her, she had not loved them because they had need of her,
they were a part of her, then they were all struggling around her,
she was a little thing then with weakening in her, more and more
then they forgot about her, they were all struggling then around
her, they were all of them having in them their individual living,
they were all big then and she was a little gentle thing and lost
among them and then she died away and left them. For her then with
her children she was not of them who love those who have need of
them nor of those who love any one near them because they have need
of them. Some women have it in them to have children as part of
them as if they were part of their own body all the time of their
living. Such never have in them an important feeling of themselves
inside them from the children that have come out of them, some of
such of them can have it in them an important feeling from their
children as it makes of them a larger thing being all one
themselves and their children. Mrs. Hersland was of such of them of
those who have in them not any important feeling of themselves
inside them from their children. She was of such of them, the
important feeling she had in her living came a little from her
husband and more from the governesses and servants and dependents
living in the house with them. She could not have in her a feeling
of herself inside her from the children around her, they were to
her like rich right living, they were a natural part of her, they
could never give to her a feeling of herself to herself as
important inside her. They were to her of her as her family living
in Bridgepoint had been of her, important to her because they were
her they were never cut off from her as she was never to her cut
off from her the way of living that was the natural way of living
for her.</p>

<p>Some women have it in them to love others because they need
them, many of such ones subdue the ones they need for loving, they
subdue them and they own them; some women have it in them to love
only those who need them; some women have it in them only to have
power when others love them, others loving them gives to them
strength in domination as their needing those who love them keeps
them from subduing others before those others love them. This will
come clearer when this kind of women comes into this history of
many kinds of men and women.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland was not of these two kinds then, she had a gentle
little bounty in her, she had a sense in her of superior strength
in her from the way of living that was the natural way of being to
her, she had a larger being from the children who were always to
her a part of her. She had in her a little power from the beauty
feeling she had for her husband in his living with her; she was for
him then a tender feeling in him, she was for him then a pleasant
little joke to him resisting to him, she was to him a woman for his
using as she was to herself part of her children, that was the
simple sense in her that never gave to her a sense of being
important to herself inside her.</p>

<p>As I said once about her she had it a very little in her to have
a very little sense of herself to herself inside her from a little
power she felt in her with her husband when he first married her.
She had then in her a little resistance of herself inside to him
then, she was not yet then a joke to him when she had this little
resistance in her, this little resistance of herself in herself in
their early living together. More and more then it came to be to
him a joke for him, more and more then her resistance to him was
not of herself in herself to him, it was for the children and that
was not a straight feeling of herself in herself inside her
resisting, that was not to herself a resisting, that was getting
something from him for the children, this never was in her an
important feeling, always up to the last end of her weakening there
was a little left over in her of her resisting to him the feeling
of herself inside her, that never had anything to do with the
children not when they were young and she was resisting so that
they could have what she felt they should have in their living not
when they were older and doing their own resisting and when they
were all big, then, and she was lost among them. She never for her
children had inside her any important feeling, she had when
managing for a servant or a seamstress or a governess an important
feeling, she had when a little resisting to her husband in their
early living an important feeling. This little resisting in her in
their early living together was the first faint beginning of
herself to herself inside her the first beginning in her of herself
inside her as an important feeling in her, this never went quite
out of her even when she was weakening and had such a feeling very
little in her, always it was there as a feeling left over, she
always to her dying had it a little in her. The kinds of feeling
women have in them and the ways it comes out from them makes for
them the bottom nature in them, gives to them their kind of
thinking, makes the character they have all their living in them,
makes them their kind of women and there are always many millions
made of each kind of them.</p>

<p>Some women have it in them to love others because they need
them, because these somehow are important to them because somehow
these they have for loving belong to them, many of such of them
subdue the ones they need for loving they subdue them and they own
them; some of them who have it to be of this kind of women have it
in them to be almost of no importance to those they have around
them in their living, to have the children belong to them as a part
of them inside them, these are of the kind of them who always own
their children who subdue those they need in living but these of
this kind of women have it to have this that is them very lightly
in them and Mrs. Hersland was of such a kind of them, these have it
in them to be it so gently in them that it never comes out in them,
with some it comes out a very little in them, with some it comes
out sometime in their living, these then have it to be so timidly
in them that their children are only a part of them it is with such
of them only in such a way that they can ever own them, some of
such a kind of them have it all so peaceably inside them that they
have not in them the feeling of being themselves inside them, it
takes some one around them to need them to be owned by them, to
make such a kind of one own them, to make them feel it inside them
that they are themselves inside them, to give to them anything of
an important feeling. There are then this kind of women and many of
them are very dependent all through their living but a little in
them is an independent feeling and this comes out in them when
there is any one around them who makes them own them, they have it
in them then a feeling of themselves inside them, they need to have
around them to have in them such a feeling of themselves inside
them, they need some who make them own them and to such a one they
are important any moment in their living. Mrs. Hersland had a very
little such a feeling with her husband when she was first married
to him, she had it in her when she was a little resisting to him;
she never would have had much more in her if she had gone on living
the life that was for her the natural way of being, she had it a
little more in her feeling with the Shilling family in her hotel
living, it came to be strongest in her living with a governess and
a seamstress and servants in the house with her and to her, poor
people around her, with always inside her country house feeling of
right rich living, with nothing in her daily living being of such a
living which was the natural way of living for her. She had it then
in her to feel herself inside her and it was then strongest in her
and came out in her with the governess Madeleine Wyman who was for
her the one who in all her living was the one whom she had power
over, not as part of her as her children were to her, but as
outside of her. She fought with the family of Madeleine Wyman for
her, she had a feeling then of herself inside her.</p>

<p>There are then two kinds of women, those who have dependent
independence in them, those who have in them independent dependence
inside them; the ones of the first of them always somehow own the
ones they need to love them, the second kind of them have it in
them to love only those who need them, such of them have it in them
to have power in them over others only when these others have begun
already a little to love them, others loving them give to such of
them strength in domination. There are then these two ways of
loving there are these two ways of being when women have loving in
them, as a bottom nature to them, there are then many kinds of
mixing, there are many kinds of each kind of them, some women have
it in them to have a bottom nature in them of one of these two
kinds of loving and then this is mixed up in them with the other
kind of loving as another nature in them but all this will come
clear in the history of all kinds of women and some kinds of men as
it will now be written of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland then was one of the one kind of them, of the first
kind of them. In the Hersland family living during the middle part
of the family living, when the children were beginning to have in
them their individual living, when Mrs. Hersland was beginning to
have strongest inside her her own important feeling, when Mr.
Hersland was strongest in beginning and making his great fortune,
during this middle portion of their family living they had three
governesses in the years of living before the children were grown
too big to have any need of such a person around them and each one
of them was of another kind of woman and this will be a history of
each one of them. There were many other women in their living, some
of one some of another kind, some with mixtures in them, some were
cooks and some were seamstresses around them, some were dependents
in the house with them, some lived in little houses near them in
that part of Gossols where no other rich people were living, and
some were of the family or friends of some of such ones of them and
this will be a history of all of them. There are many kinds of
women then and many kinds of men and this then will be a history of
some of the many kinds of them.</p>

<p>Many women have at some time resisting in them. Some have
resisting in them as a feeling of themselves inside them. In some
kinds of women resisting is not a feeling of themselves to
themselves inside them. In some kinds of women resisting can only
come from such a feeling. This makes two different kinds of women
and mostly all women can be divided so between them. Patient women
need to have in them such a feeling to be resisting, they need to
have in them a feeling of themselves inside them to be really
resisting to any one who owns them. Attacking women with weakness
as the bottom of them have not it in them to need such a feeling
for resisting, resisting is natural to them, it covers up in them
the weakness of them. Concentrated women with not any weakness at
the bottom in them do not need to have in them such a feeling,
these are made up of resisting, concentration with them makes the
whole of them makes for them the strength such a feeling as
themselves inside them gives to patient ones to make resisting
possible for them, attacking feeling gives it to others who really
have weakness in them as the bottom of them. Such concentrated
women have never in them any such resisting in them, yielding is
the whole of such ones of them. This needs very much explaining,
this makes a history of every kind of woman, this is a history of
only a few kinds of them.</p>

<p>Many women then have resisting in them, many women have
attacking in them, many women who have resisting and attacking in
them have weakness as the bottom of them, some have not any such
weakness at the bottom of them. These last mostly have much
concentration of themselves inside them. Some women have not any
attacking or resisting in them, some of such of them can have it in
them when they have come into them a feeling of themselves inside
them, some never have in them anything of such a feeling. Many
women then have resisting at some time in them. Many women have
religion in them, there are many kinds of women and each kind of
them has it in those of them that have religion in them to have it
of the character of them, mostly it is in them like the bottom
nature that makes their kind of them that makes their kind of
loving, their kind of resisting, if they have resisting in them,
their kind of religion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland never had her religion to be in her like his in
her father, a thing to give to her a feeling of herself inside her,
religion with her went with what would happen in her daily living
for her, was in her not anything of resistance inside her, was
simply a part of the gentle feeling in her like her children inside
her, like the rich right living that was the natural way of living
for her. As I was saying many women have it in them to feel it
inside them that the last end of a bad thing cannot come to them,
that the last evil thing will not destroy them; this is a common
feeling with women who have in them resisting or attacking as the
natural thing in them with a weakness at the bottom of them, these
women have not in them a superior feeling, they have it in them
that no last bad thing can overwhelm them that is to their
resisting and at the same time the weakness of them gives to them
the feeling that something some one will take care of them. This is
in many of them a religion in them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland was not such a one a last end of a bad thing could
win and she would be hurt not angry when it had happened to them,
she could be angry when she had a feeling of being herself inside
her and so could then have resisting in her but this could never be
in her in any real trouble or sorrow that came to her or to the
children who were a part of her, then there was no important
feeling of herself inside her, then there was no resisting in her,
then she had a resignation to the pain that killed her, that was
all the religion she had in her. Her mother had had always such a
trickling sadness in her, this was all of her, this was all
religion to her. Her father had had a feeling of himself inside him
to make religion for him, he was all to himself always inside him
he was the complete thing of such resisting, it was in him all
religion, all religion was him he had it so all inside him. Mrs.
Hersland had it then a little in her to have resisting in her, a
feeling of herself inside her, she could then have anger in her but
this could never be in her in any real trouble or sorrow that came
to her or to the children who were a part of her, then there was no
important feeling of herself inside her, then there was no
resisting in her, then she had a resignation to the pain that
killed her, that was all the religion she had in her.</p>

<p>As I was saying women who have resisting or attacking with
weakness as the bottom of them never believe that the last end of a
bad thing can come to them, that anything can really drown them,
they have aggressive optimism in them, some of them then have
aggressive optimism in them they have mostly all of them in some
way religion in them, some have almost not any bottom weakness in
them, some are all weakness inside them they have almost no
attacking in them, sometimes with such of them their weakness makes
them resisting, later this will be a history of several of all
these kinds of them.</p>

<p>Some women have it in them to subdue those they need in loving.
Madeleine Wyman the last governess was one of such of them and this
will be a history of her living, with the Hersland family, with the
mother, the father and the children.</p>

<p>The Herslands had a governess, a seamstress and servants living
in the house with them. Mostly the Hersland children in their
younger living were more entirely of them, the poorer people who
lived around them, than they were of their home living. This was
true of them, all through their younger living, all through the
time they had governesses around them, their mother and their
governesses never really knew it about them.</p>

<p>To begin then with beginning of the living of the Hersland
family in the ten acre place in that part of Gossols where no other
rich people were living.</p>

<p>There was then Mr. Hersland in the middle of his middle living,
Mrs. Hersland in the beginning of the strongest time of being to
herself inside her in her feeling, the three children in the first
beginning in them of individual feeling. There were then the
servants living in the house with them, a governess and near them
in the small houses around them poor, for them, queer people to
make for them their daily living.</p>

<p>They had foreign women as servants in the house with them when
they could get them. Sometimes they could not get them They had
three governesses in their whole living in Gossols before the
children grew too old to have one. One was a foreign born, two were
American. The seamstresses were always foreign American, sometimes
it was the family near them, sometimes it was one in the part of
Gossols where rich people mostly were living, and then there was
another one not near them but who would come sometimes and stay in
the house with them. Mrs. Hersland with all of them had her
important feeling, she had it in getting them, in keeping them, and
whenever she had to get rid of one of them. She had always in her
with them an important feeling, sometimes she had an angry feeling
with them, sometimes a resisting feeling, she never let any
interfering come between her and her acting toward them, she was
always of them and above them, she had all of her feeling of
herself to herself from them.</p>

<p>Many women have a feeling of themselves inside them from
servants around them. There are many ways of having such a feeling
in them. This is a long history of one of them. Many servants get
to have in them something that is almost a craziness in them, many
have a very lonesome feeling in them not a lonesome feeling of
themselves inside them just a lonesome feeling that makes queer,
sometimes a little crazy women of them. This is in many of them.
The Irishwoman and one of the Italian women had this a little in
them. This makes them good fun for children living in the house
with them. The children tease them, they are good to children
around them, they always have to be sent away all of a sudden. The
Irishwoman and one of the Italians was of this kind of women. The
other servants were always steady women, each with their own way of
being in them and this is now a history of all of them. This is a
history of them and the seamstresses and the governesses and any
troubles any one of them had with the others living in the house
with them. This is a history of all of them and of the kind of
important feeling Mrs. Hersland had in her from all of them and of
the feelings the children each one had for each one of them and the
relation each one had to Mr. Hersland.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland then was of the kind of women who have resisting
in them only with a feeling of themselves inside them, Mrs.
Hersland was of the kind of women who have dependent independence
in them, Mrs. Hersland was of the kind of women, though she had
this to be in her so timidly inside her so gently within her that
mostly nobody ever knew it to themselves about her, she had it in
her to be of the kind of women to own those they need for loving,
to subdue any one who needs them to be important to them. She was
then of them who have it in them not to have weakness as the last
bottom of them, not to have it in them that the last end of a bad
thing cannot come to them, she could have an ending, she could feel
this in her dying, she could feel it in her weakening, she could
feel it in her children when they were big and struggling and she a
gentle little woman was lost among them, she never had in her an
important feeling from her children, she had it in the living in
Gossols in that part where no other rich people were living.</p>

<p>There are then two kinds of women, there are those who have in
them resisting and attacking, and a bottom weakness in them, women
with independent dependence in them, women who are strong in
attacking, women who sometimes have not bottom weakness in them,
some who have in them bottom weakness in them and this inside is a
strength in them when they have children when they have strong
loving in them when it is in them in such of them a fine sensitive
weakness inside them, there are then such ones of them women who
need others around to love them before they have any power in them
from the weakness in them, in such of them attacking is a power in
them but not when they meet with real resisting, the bottom
weakness in them is only a power in them when those around them
love them, so only can these have any power in them; all these then
all these women have not it in them mostly to believe that it never
can come to them the last end of a bad thing to destroy them. All
these then make one kind of the two kinds there are of women, the
two kinds too there are then of men, and there are many kinds of
such of them many strengths in them of this strength and weakness
in them, many mixtures in them of the independence and dependence
in them, many mixings and sometimes a mixing in the top of them
with the other kind of nature of some men and women the dependent
independent kind in men and women but more or less it is in them in
all of this one kind of them it is in them to have independent
dependence in them, it is in them to have attacking in them, to
have aggressive optimism in them, to not believe the last end of a
bad thing can come to them and destroy them, and then to have
weakness as the bottom of them; and in many of them this weakness
is all there is to them, in some of them attacking is all there is
of them.</p>

<p>The other kind of women and there are many kinds of such of them
in the many millions always of women, this other kind of them need
to own the people around them when this nature is strong in them;
they have many of them, a dependent patient way of living, but with
the dependent nature in them they have never such of them, a
feeling of themselves inside them, this comes out in them only with
the bottom independence in them, when they feel themselves
resisting, when it comes to them to own themselves inside them,
when they own some one around them, some of such of them never have
such a moment in their living, some of such of them never feel
themselves inside them; there are then always many women living,
there are then these two kinds of them, this is now a history of
some of each kind of them, sometime there will be a history of all
of each kind of them and that will then be a history of all women
who are living, of all the many millions who ever were or will be
living and then there will begin a history of all the men and the
two kinds of them for there are in men the same two kinds of them
like with women and it works out differently a little in them for
they are men and have themselves mostly more inside them in their
living, there are then these two kinds in women and in men and
always every one is of one kind or the other kind of them.</p>

<p>In their middle living in that part of Gossols where no other
rich people were living the Hersland family had with them only
women in the house with them. As I was saying servants often have
it in them to be a little queer and children like to tease them,
they have this queerness from cooking, from cleaning and from their
lonesome living, from their sitting in the kitchen, from having a
mistress to direct them, and children to tease them; the Irishwoman
and one of the Italian women that were cooking once for the
Hersland family in their middle living had this queerness in them.
They had had then mostly in their living German women as servants
in the house with them, sometimes they could not get them, once
they had an Irishwoman, twice Italian women, once a Mexican. The
Irish woman and one of the Italian women had a little queerness in
them, the queerness that comes from being a servant and cooking and
sitting alone in a kitchen and having a mistress to direct them and
sometimes children to tease them, these had to be sent away all of
a sudden. Mostly the German women were very steady women, they did
not have anything of such a queerness in them, sometimes the German
girls they had with them were very young women and then Mrs.
Hersland had to train them, some of such of them had natures in
them that in their later living would come, from much kitchen
sitting, from much directing of the mistress of the house to them,
from much teasing from the children in the house with them, would
come to make of them a queerness inside them that would make it
come to them in their later living to be always sent away all of a
sudden. In the early living of such ones they would not be sent
away all of a sudden but the mistress of such ones would not then
be sorry to lose them.</p>

<p>There were then as I was saying, when Mrs. Hersland could get
them foreign servants in the house with them, there was always a
governess in the house with them, there was often a seamstress
staying in the house with them. There was always a man working in
the garden but he never lived in the house with them.</p>

<p>As I was saying in most of their living they had German
servants, but sometimes they could not get them, once they had an
Irish woman cooking for them, twice Italian women and once a
Mexican. The German servants who lived with them mostly stayed a
long time with them even those of them that were not altogether
satisfying because until Mrs. Hersland had an angry feeling about
some one she would never dismiss any one and angry feeling did not
come to be in her very often. So mostly the servants stayed a long
time with them, not those of them that had servant queerness in
them, Mrs. Hersland never liked such a one, she wanted her servants
so that she was of them and above them, she did not want them to
have the kind of queerness in them that made strange beings of
them, that always in a way made her afraid of them, servants were
to Mrs. Hersland part of every day living, she never wanted them to
have servant queerness in them, she was more then of them though
always she was above them and she could come to have with such of
them rightly an angry feeling. Sometimes she would have young
foreign girls or foreign American ones and she would train them,
some of such of them would in their later living have servant
queerness in them, mostly Mrs. Hersland did not keep such ones a
long time, mostly she liked to have older women she felt herself
more of them than with the young ones who needed to have her train
them. She liked it better to have women who only needed directing
and once in a while she would tell such a one how to cook something
and with such of them she could feel of them and above them, she
could with such ones have an injured feeling when they did
something that was not right to her feeling, she could have with
such a one rightly an angry feeling. She did not then like to have
any one with servant queerness in them, she did not know it in
herself that she did not like to have young girls to train but
always these would soon be leaving, once one stayed on and on and
Mrs. Hersland did not have with her rightly an angry feeling. She
stayed on a long time until at last some one told about her that
she was asking some one else to take her, that gave to Mrs.
Hersland the injury that made it right for her to have an angry
feeling in her and so at last she could dismiss her. This is the
history of her. She was a blond little woman and with no feeling of
cooking, or keeping anything clean in her, she always did what
anybody told her, she had no sense of responsibility inside her,
she had it in her to have lying in her that just came out of her
whenever any one asked her, she had little curls in her blond hair,
mostly every one thought her an ugly blond little servant, really
she had a kind of little servant girl beauty in her. This is a
history of her. She had not a servant nature in her but a servant
girl nature in her that is the little dirty little girl character
in her, the little dirty shrinking lying blond hair nature in her,
not a woman nature in her. This was strong in her, in all the
millions made just like her this is always stronger or weaker, this
is the servant girl nature and there are always many millions made
just like her.</p>

<p>Servant girl being is a kind of being that many millions of many
kinds of women always have in them. Servant girl being in such of
them is different from just servant being in other kinds of men and
women. Servant girl being that is something of dirty or clean
little girl being with the scared little lying always in such a one
when there is much in their living and there always is in such ones
of them for they need it to keep them going, to keep them cleaning,
to keep them washing and working, to keep them from lying, much
directing from the mistress living in the house with them, much
teasing from children living in the house with them, much trouble
with their loving so that nobody stops them when they go to their
loving, much sitting in the kitchen with their hands so grimy
nothing can clean them. Mostly such ones do not in their later
living have servant queerness in them, they just get married most
of them and just get old being that kind of them with many children
always coming out of them and so they go on to their ending. Women
who in all their living have this servant girl being in them are
like in all women and always it is in all men and in all women that
they have in them one of the two kinds of nature in them that is
independent dependent or dependent independent nature in them.
Servant girl nature in women then can be the independent dependent
kind then with mostly only the dependent weakness in them with a
scared dirty little girl crying and lying in them, mostly with
nothing in them but the dependent scared weakness in them and no
responsibility in them of being ever inside them and always a
little in them and it mostly comes out in little tricks they have
in them, little or much badness in them, a little of the attacking
independent dependents always have in them. This is mostly in their
living, in bad ones it can even come to stealing, mostly it is
lying and finding ways to win to a ribbon, to moments in loving.
Mostly when you catch hold of such a one by the arm to stop them
there is not yielding, there is scared shrinking, there is lying,
sometimes they do very good thinking, mostly in their later living
a good many children come out from them, mostly they keep on
working but always somebody is scolding them and this is a history
of most of them. As I was saying women with servant girl being
inside them, not servant being that is a different kind of being
that has not the grimy scared little girl lying as the bottom of
them, such then have it in them to be of one kind or the other kind
of them the independent dependent or the dependent independent kind
of them. There is one kind of them who have a little attacking in
them the independent dependent kind; in them that comes out in
little tricks and little dirty lying in them sometimes in stealing
and other badness in them, in moments of leaving by themselves all
of a sudden from where they were working when they are sure they
can do better then and then there is a little grimy defiance in
them, this is all the attacking there is in them, this makes of
them independent dependent creatures for them and there will be
written down here a history soon of one of such of them. There are
then many millions always made of such of them, with always a
servant girl nature in them and the independent dependent kind of
being in them, there are then always many millions of such ones of
them and always everywhere in every kind of living one can find
such of them. Mrs. Hersland had the training of such a one of them,
Mrs. Hersland had rightly an angry feeling when this one tried to
get another place with out telling any one she was leaving. Mrs.
Hersland had rightly an angry feeling then, she sent her away and
soon there will be told the history of this one. There are then in
the women who have servant girl nature always in them, with every
kind of way they can be living, with every kind of training that
can come to them, there are always the two kinds of them the
independent dependent kind of them and the dependent independent
kind of them. Many of the independent dependent kind of them are
pretty, scared young girls in their living, sacredness and lying,
and shrinking, and a little attacking, and a little winning and
prettiness and appealing are mixed up in many ways in them. Mostly
in all of them these are always somehow somewhere in them, when
they are working for their living, when they are young ladies in
their living always there is some one always directing them,
sometimes it is a mistress, a master, a mother or a father, a
husband, some woman, or an aunt, a sister, or a man who is
directing them. These things always are mixed up in them and more
we will come to know all the history of all of them.</p>

<p>The dependent independent kind of women who have always in them
the servant girl being in them have not in them anything of
attacking, they have more weakness than shrinking in them, they
have lying but it does not come out in little jerks out of them, it
is never active in such a one, it is meekness and concealing in
them; and there will be later a history of all of such kinds of
them. Some women have it in them to be in all their living
children, to have a childish nature in them all through their
living. Some men have such a thing always in them, mostly men have
it in them more than women to have in all their living a little
childish nature in them. There are always then many millions of men
and always some women who have always in them all through their
living from their beginning to their ending child nature always in
them. Some women have it in them all their living to have a grimy
little girl nature in them, some have it in them to have a little
girl sweet shrinking little lying nature always in them. All of
such kind of them and there are always many millions made of them
and they are in every place and in every kind of living, such have
in them the nature that is in certain kinds of living servant girl
nature and sometime there will be a history of every kind and every
one of such of them. Some women have it in their living to have in
them a being just before adolescent living, to have in them all
through their living the fear of coming adolescence about
beginning, in them, these always have it in them to be very lively
so as to keep adolescence from giving sorrow to them, they are
lively and they try all their living to keep up dancing so that
adolescence will be scared away from them, these have not in them
sentimental feeling, they have agressive liveliness in them. One
can never be certain of this about them from their kind of living,
they may be trying very exciting living, but in their walking they
make a dance step not because they have it in them a lightsome
feeling, they make it to keep in them a lively feeling, mostly they
do not know it inside them that they do not want to have inside
them the restlessness of adolescent living and so they keep up
inside them always a lively feeling; they make a dance step every
now and then in their walking. There are always many women who have
it all through their living to have such a just before beginning
adolescent being in them. There are some men who have in them all
through their living such a nature in them. There are then many
millions always being made of such ones of women, there are some
millions always being made of such ones of men. Some women have all
their living their school feeling in them, they never get through,
from their beginning to their ending, with such feeling, such
being, such living, it is in them and nothing can change them, they
are always school girls in their being, some of them always are as
school girls in their feeling, some of them always are as school
girls in their living, some women have some of this in them all
through their living from their beginning to their ending, some
have only this in them it is always then all there is of them,
there are many millions then who have in all their living more or
less in them of such being. Some women have it in them and there
are always many millions of them and they are to themselves like
men in their living there are many women who are always vigorous
young women energetic and getting information and busy every moment
in their living and sometime there will be a history of many of
such of them. Then there are many women, there are always many
millions always everywhere of every kind of them, there are many
women who have some kind of woman nature in them and always in the
millions of all the kinds of them there is always in them one
nature or the other nature in them, there is always some kind or
every kind of mixture in them, sometime there will be a history of
every one of every kind of them, sometime there will be a history
of everyone who ever was or is or will be living, there must always
sometime be a history of each one from their beginning to their
ending, of every one who ever was or is or will be living. Sometime
there will be a history of every woman, there will be sometime a
history of every kind of them, there will be sometime a history of
every part of the living of every woman from her beginning to her
ending. This is now a history of some of them.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of women and several of several kinds of
them were servants living in the house with the Hersland family and
mostly those were older women but sometimes Mrs. Hersland was
training a young one.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mrs. Hersland did not know she did not like to
train young ones and mostly they did not stay long but once there
was a little blond one who hung on. She never did any better in her
cleaning or cooking than in the beginning, she always every minute
needed directing, Mrs. Hersland never knew she did not like to do
this directing, she never knew that she did not like it that with
such a one she could not have rightly an injured or an angry
feeling. At last she did have rightly an injured and an angry
feeling and that was for all of them then the end of that one.</p>

<p>Soon there will be a history of every kind of men and every kind
of women and every way any one can think about them. Soon then
there will be a history of every man and every woman and every kind
of being they ever have or could have in them. Sometime there will
be a history of all of them, and now to begin again with the
servant girl being and the servant being and the history of all of
them who lived in the house with the Hersland family then when Mrs.
Hersland was beginning to have in her strongest inside the feeling
of being herself in her.</p>

<p>There were then many of them though mostly each one stayed a
long time with them but in these years of the Hersland family's
middle living with servants and seamstresses and governesses and
dependents living in the house with them, there were in all many
women that gave to Mrs. Hersland her important feeling.</p>

<p>There were then a few young girls who lived at some time in the
house with them, some with servant girl nature in them, some with
the one kind the independent dependent kind of nature in them, some
with the other kind the dependent independent kind of nature in
them. These as I was saying mostly did not stay long to get
training, Mrs. Hersland never knew she did not want them, she never
said she would not take them, after the one who stayed a long time
and then gave to Mrs. Hersland a really angry feeling Mrs. Hersland
never had one.</p>

<p>One of the foreign women, she was an older woman when she lived
with them, she was such a one; she had servant girl being, she had
the dependent independent servant girl being, she stayed sometime
with the Hersland family as the cook for them, she had in her the
servant girl being of the dependent independent kind all through
her living, there will be a history of this one.</p>

<p>Some young women who had servant girl nature in them came to
know the Hersland family in their middle living, not as servants to
them, some as dependents on them, some as living in the small
houses near them, one was in a way of them in their living she was
of the family of one of the governesses and they came later the
Hersland children all three of them to know many of such of
them.</p>

<p>Soon then there will be a history of every kind of men and women
and of all the mixtures in them, sometime there will be a history
of every man and every woman who ever were or are or will be living
and of the kind of nature in them and the way it comes out from
them from their beginning to their ending, sometime then there will
be a history of each one of them and of the many millions always
being made just like them, there will be sometime a history of all
of them, there will be a history of them and now there is here a
beginning.</p>

<p>There are then many millions always being made of women who have
in all their living always from their beginning to their ending
servant girl nature in them. Some of such of them are pretty little
girls and happy in their living, some of such of them have much
trouble in their living. There are then always many millions, in
all the ways of living women have made for them, there are always
many millions who have always in them all through their living from
their beginning to their ending this servant girl nature in them,
there will be now such a history of some of such of them, there
will be now a history of some of the kinds of them, there will be
now a description of the two kinds of them, the two kinds that
divide all the kinds of men and women and sometime there will be a
history of all of such of them, women who have such a servant girl
nature in them, all of such of them who ever were or are or will be
living.</p>

<p>Sometime then there will be a history of all women and all men,
of all the men and all the women, of every one of them, of the
mixtures in them of the bottom nature and other natures in them, of
themselves inside them, there will be then a history of all of them
of all their being and how it comes out from them from their
beginning to their ending. Sometime there will be then such a
history of every one who ever was or is or will be living, and this
is not for anybody's reading, this is to give to everybody in their
living the last end to being, it makes it so of them real being, it
makes for each one who ever is or was or can be living a real
continuing and always as one looks more and more at each one, as
one sees them walking, eating, sitting, sewing, working, sleeping,
being babies, children, young grown men and women, grown up men and
women, growing old men and women, old men and old women, as one
sees them every moment in their being there must be sometime a
history of them, there must be sometime a history of each one of
them and of the nature or natures in them, of themselves to
themselves in their living, of the nature or natures mixed up in
them and the coming out of this being in them from them from their
beginning to their ending. Sometime there will be a history of all
of the kinds of them and of each one of all the millions of each
kind of them. There are then always many millions being made of
women who have in them servant girl nature always in them, there
are always then there are always being made then many millions who
have a little attacking and mostly scared dependent weakness in
them, there are always being made then many millions of them who
have a scared timid submission in them with a resisting somewhere
sometime in them. There are always some then of the many millions
of this first kind of them the independent dependent kind of them
who never have it in them to have any such attacking in them, there
are more of them of the many millions of this first kind of them,
who have very little in them of the scared weakness in them, there
are some of them who have in them such a weakness as meekness in
them, some of them have this in them as gentle pretty young
innocence inside them, there are all kinds of mixtures in them then
in the many millions of this kind of them in the many kinds of
living they have in them. In the second kind of them the dependent
independent kind of them who have too all through their living
servant girl nature in them, in this kind of them there are many of
them who have a scared timid submission in them with a resisting
sometime somewhere in them, there are many of them who have this
submission as a patient meekness in them, they have not it in them
many of such of them to ever choose their own way in living, to
choose their own loving, to choose their own existing at any moment
in their living, sometimes sometime some of such ones of them have
resisting in them, sometimes this is in them a stubborn way they
have in them, sometimes it is from too much directing of them and
then they have resisting in them, sometimes from some one around
them dependent on them, sometimes from feeling sometime in their
living, feeling themselves inside them. There are many millions
then of women who have always in them all their living this servant
girl being inside them, always as it is in all men and women these
are all of the one kind or the other kind of them of the
independent dependent having attacking more or less sometime in
them, of dependent independent who can have sometime resisting in
them.</p>

<p>In all loving, in all the many millions always loving mostly
there is one of them one of the two of them who is of the kind of
them who have independent dependent nature in them, this one always
in the two of them in loving does attacking in loving, sometimes it
is in the man sometimes in the woman, and the other one then is of
them who have dependent independent nature in them and these can
have sometime more or less resisting in them, this makes the pair
of them and this is always true in loving. This is not always clear
in the beginning of a loving, sometimes it is the resisting that is
in appearance like attacking, sometimes the attacking that has
stubbornness or weakness in it like resisting but more and more in
loving more and more in their living this nature in them comes out
of them in the repeating that is in all real being. It is true then
that always every one is of one kind or the other kind of them the
independent dependent or the dependent independent kind of them. It
is hard to tell it about them, to describe it how each one is of
the kind of them that is in that one. It is hard to tell it about
them because the same words can describe all of them the one and
the other kind of them, they are very different the one from the
other kind of them, more and more perhaps it will come out clearly
about them. It is hard to describe it in them the kind of being
each one has in them, it is hard to describe it in them it is hard
to know it in them, it is only slowly the two kinds of them come to
be clear to every one who listens to the repeating that comes out
of them, who sees the repeating that is in them the repeating of
the bottom nature of them. Sometimes resisting comes like
attacking, sometimes attacking seems like resisting, slowly it
comes out from each one the kind of nature in them. So then this
makes always a pair of them and this is always true in successful
loving and this will soon then be a history of every kind of loving
and how it comes from every one the nature of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland had dependent independent being, she could
sometime in her have resisting. This is now a history of her and
the servants and governesses and dependents who had to do with her.
Mr. Hersland had attacking in him, mostly he was in his feeling as
big as all the world in all of his beginning and all of his living
was beginning, he never knew it inside him until his children told
it to him when they were angry with him when impatient feeling
filled him, he never knew that he did not go on to the last end of
fighting that he had in him such a weakness in him; this is now a
history of him and of how the servants and the governesses and the
dependents and his wife and children felt all these things in
him.</p>

<p>All kinds of men and women have impatient feeling and sometime
this will be a history of every kind of impatient feeling and of
every kind of men and women who have impatient feeling. Now this is
a history of servant living, of servants who have in them servant
girl being, of servants who have in them servant being, of servants
who have in them not any real servant being, of servants who have
in them a mixing of some or all of these kinds of nature in them,
of how it works out through them the two kinds of nature in all men
and women the independent dependent and the dependent independent
natures in all of them, this will be too a history of servant
queerness and how it works in such of them as have this in
them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mrs. Hersland had mostly in her middle living in
Gossols in that part where no other rich people were living older
foreign or foreign American women as servants in the house with
them. Sometimes she had a young one to train, Mrs. Hersland never
knew it in her that she never really liked to do such training.
They always then had German or German American older women as
servants in the house with them, but sometimes Mrs. Hersland could
not get any of them, once she had an Irish woman to do the cooking,
twice Italian women and once a Mexican, the Irish woman had servant
queerness in her and she left all of a sudden, one Italian woman
had servant queerness in her and she had to be sent away quickly
without any warning, Mrs. Hersland never liked to have queer people
near her she wanted her servants to be of the same kind of nature
that was natural to her in the living at Bridgepoint the good
living that was natural to her, she needed a servant around her
that she Mrs. Hersland in her feeling could be of her and above
her, she never wanted any servant to have servant queerness in
her.</p>

<p>Some time then there will be every kind of a history of every
one who ever can or is or was or will be living. Some time then
there wall be a history of every one from their beginning to their
ending. Sometime then there will be a history of all of them, of
every kind of them, of every one, of every bit of living they ever
have in them, of them when there is never more than a beginning to
them, of every kind of them, of every one when there is very little
beginning and then there is an ending, there will then sometime be
a history of every one there will be a history of everything that
ever was or is or will be them, of everything that was or is or
will be all of any one or all of all of them. Sometime then there
will be a history of every one, of everything or anything that is
all them or any part of them and sometime then there will be a
history of how anything or everything comes out from every one,
comes out from every one or any one from the beginning to the
ending of the being in them. Sometime then there must be a history
of every one who ever was or is or will be living. As one sees
every one in their living, in their loving, sitting, eating,
drinking, sleeping, walking, working, thinking, laughing, as any
one sees all of them from their beginning to their ending, sees
them when they are little babies or children or young grown men and
women or growing older men and women or old men and women then one
knows it in them that sometime there will be a history of all of
them, that sometime all of them will have the last touch of being,
a history of them can give to them, sometime then there will be a
history of each one, of all the Kinds of them, of all the ways any
one can know them, of all the ways each one is inside her or inside
him, of all the ways anything of them comes out from them. Sometime
then there will be a history of every one and so then every one
will have in them the last touch of being a history of any one can
give to them.</p>

<p>This is now a history of a number of men and women from their
beginning to their ending; these will have then the last touch of
being that a history of any one can give to them, sometime it will
be that any one who ever was or is or will be living, sometime then
it will be even if they have had only a very little of any living,
sometime then it will be that every one will have the last touch of
being, a history of them can give to them, sometime then in my
feeling there will be a history of every kind of men and women,
there will be a history of every one from the beginning to their
ending, every one will have sometime before the ending the last
touch of being a history of them can give to any one. So then we go
on to our beginning of giving a history of every one from their
beginning to their ending so that sometime there will be done a
history of every one and every kind of one and all the nature in
every one and all the ways it comes out of them. Every one then
will be full then of the being a history of every one can give to
them, every one of them will have that last touch of being a
history of them can give to any one.</p>

<p>And so to commence again with the history of many of them and
all the kinds there are of men and women.</p>

<p>Sometime then there will be a history of every one of every man
and every woman from their beginning to their ending. Sometime
there will be a history of every one and every kind of them and
more and more then every one will understand it, how every one is
connected with every one in the kind of being they have in them
which makes of each one one of their kind of them. More and more
then this will be a history of every kind and the way one kind is
connected with the other kind of them and the many ways one can
think of every kind of men and women as one more and more knows
them as their nature is in them and comes out of them in the
repeating that is more and more all of them.</p>

<p>There are then many kinds of them but all of them can be divided
into the two kinds of them the independent dependent kind of them,
the dependent independent kind of them, and more and more there
will be a history of all of them so that more and more any one can
see it in them. There are always then many kinds of men and women
in these two kinds of them and sometime there will be a history of
all of them.</p>

<p>To go on then now with the Hersland living in the ten acre place
in that part of Gossols where no other rich people were living.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mrs. Hersland had mostly in her middle living in
Gossols in that part where no other rich people were living, older
foreign or foreign American women as servants in the house with
them. Sometimes she had a young one to train, Mrs. Hersland never
knew it in her that she never really liked to do such training,
they always then had foreign or foreign American older women as
servants in the house with them, but sometimes Mrs. Hersland could
not get any of them, once she had an Irish woman to do the cooking,
twice Italian women, and once a Mexican; the Irish woman had
servant queerness in her and she left all of a sudden, one Italian
woman had servant queerness in her and she had to be sent away
quickly without any warning, Mrs. Hersland never liked to have
queer people near her she wanted her servants to be of the same
kind of being as that which was natural to her in the living at
Bridgepoint the good rich living that was natural to her, she
needed a servant to be around her so that Mrs. Hersland in her
feeling could be of her and above her, she never wanted any servant
to have servant queerness in her.</p>

<p>There were then not very many young women whom the Hersland
family had as servants in the house with them. Mrs. Hersland never
knew it in her that she did not like to do such training, no one of
them excepting a little blond one ever stayed a long time with
them. Mr. Hersland never knew that he had any feeling about such a
kind of them but they were a little an annoyance to him. The
Hersland family had many such young girls with servant girl nature
in them around them from the houses near them, from the families of
governesses or others living in the house with them, and so the
Hersland children knew in their early living enough of such of
them. As I was saying Mrs. Hersland never knew it that she did not
like to do such training, after the one who gave to her after a
long time a right reason for having in her rightly an injured and
an angry feeling, she never had any such a one as a servant in the
house with them.</p>

<p>As I was saying, more and more as one in passing looks at every
one more and more then there comes to one the certain feeling that
sometime there will be a history of every one, of all the kinds
there are every one of men and women. Always as one looks at them
as one lives on in the daily living that gives to one the feeling
that in all real being there is always on and on repeating that
comes out more and more and more in everybody's living, always then
more and more one has in them the certain feeling that sometime
there will be a history of every one, that sometime every one will
have in them the last touch of being a history gives to every one.
So then sometime there will be a history of every one and of every
kind of men and women and of every kind of nature in any one of
them and every kind of mixing there can ever be in any one and the
way the nature in each one comes out from them, there will then
sometime be a history of every one from their beginning to their
ending, there will then be a history of every one even such of them
that have only a little beginning and then an ending to them; to
every one then there will be a whole history of them, each one then
sometime will have written a whole history of her, of him, and this
will give to every one who ever was or is or will be living the
last part of real being a history of them can give to any one.</p>

<p>There were then living on a ten acre place in a pleasant kind of
living, Mr. Hersland and his wife and three children with servants
and a governess and sometimes a seamstress in the house with them
and near them poor people in small houses some of whom were more or
less dependent on them. They had then pleasant living in this ten
acre place, they had then their own kind of living and mostly it
was pleasant enough for all of them, they had country living in
them, they had city living in them, they had country house living
in them, and always then living was very pleasant for all of them.
The three children were more then of the for them poor people
around them than they were of their mother's or their governesses'
or their father's living. They had a relation to everybody around
them but mostly then inside them they were mostly of the living of
the poorer people who lived in the small houses near them.
Sometimes they were very much of the living of the servants in the
house with them, sometimes of the family of the governess then
living with them but mostly always then they were more of the
living of the people living in the small houses around them than
they were of the living of those in the house with them.</p>

<p>As I was saying some of the servants living in the house with
them were sometimes important to the children, sometimes the
children liked to tease them, sometimes to get what they wanted
from them, mostly the servants and governesses and seamstresses
were not as important to the children as the people living in the
small houses near them.</p>

<p>There are then always many millions of women who are servants
with servant nature in them, there are always many millions who
have servant girl nature in them the kind of nature that makes of
them a certain kind of being. These are then two kinds of them and
there are many mixtures in them, in each one of them. Some of them
the women who are living as servants to some one, there are many of
them with servant natures in them, there are many of them with
servant girl natures in them, there are many of them with servant
mistress natures in them, many with mistress servant natures in
them, there are then in the women living as servants to some one
every kind of nature in them, there is every kind of mixture in
them of one or more of all the kinds of being women have in them.
Sometime there will be a history of all the kinds of being women
ever have or had or can have or will have in them. Sometime and
that will be a great thing there will be a history of each one, of
the bottom nature of each one and the mixing of different being or
kinds of being with the bottom nature and the way it comes out in
her living, from the beginning, from her being a baby then and just
beginning, from the way it comes out more and more in her living as
she goes on repeating the way everybody always does in living, more
and more then in each one in their living the history of each one
comes out of them, more and more each one is repeating and each
part of their living has its own repeating and makes of that part a
history coming out from them, then in the whole living there comes
out more and more and more a repeating that was in them always
inside them, from the beginning to the ending; this then is a
history of them, this is a history of the bottom nature, how it
works inside them, how it is mixed or not mixed up in them with the
nature or other natures in them, sometime then there is a history
of each one, sometime then there will be a history of every kind of
women and of men, sometime there will be a history of each one.</p>

<p>There is then or will be then a history of each one who ever was
or is or can be living. It comes out from them in the repeating
which is sometime all of them. Many things come out of every one in
their living and this is now a history of all that comes out of
some of them.</p>

<p>Many things then come out in the repeating that make a history
of each one for any one who always listens to them. Many things
come out of each one and as one listens to them listens to all the
repeating in them, always this comes to be clear about them, the
history of them of the bottom nature in them, the nature or natures
mixed up in them to make the whole of them in anyway it mixes up in
them. Sometime then there will be a history of every one.</p>

<p>There are then many things every one has in them and this is a
history of all of them in some of them.</p>

<p>As I said once almost every one has in them some kind of an
impatient feeling, mostly every one has in them an anxious feeling
and this is the way these work out in some.</p>

<p>When you come to feel the whole of anyone from the beginning to
the ending, all the kind of repeating there is in them, the
different ways at different times repeating comes out of them, all
the kinds of things and mixtures in each one, anyone can see then
by looking hard at any one living near them that a history of every
one must be a long one. A history of any one must be a long one,
slowly it comes out from them from their beginning to their ending,
slowly you can see it in them the nature and the mixtures in them,
slowly everything comes out from each one in the kind of repeating
each one does in the different parts and kinds of living they have
in them, slowly then the history of them comes out from them,
slowly then any one who looks well at any one will have the history
of the whole of that one. Slowly the history of each one comes out
of each one. Sometime then there will be a history of every one.
Mostly every history will be a long one. Slowly it comes out of
each one, slowly any one who looks at them gets the history of each
part of the living of any one in the history of the whole of each
one that sometime there will be of every one.</p>

<p>There will then sometime be a history of every one who ever is
or was or will be living, mostly every history will be a long one,
some will have a very little one, slowly it comes out of each one.
Mostly then the history of any one as it slowly comes out of them
will be a long one, this is a long history now of many of them.</p>

<p>Every one then has in their living repeating, repeating of every
kind of thing in them, repeating of the kind of impatient feeling
they have in them, of the anxious feeling almost every one has more
or less always in them.</p>

<p>There is then a whole to living, mostly everybody has for this
an anxious feeling, some have not any such anxious feeling to the
whole of them, many have the anxious feeling in every minute of
their living, every minute is a whole to them with an anxious
feeling which each minute ends them. To many then in the history of
all the kinds of them all the kinds of men and women who ever were
or are or will be living, to some then and there are always many
millions of them to some then the important thing is to have the
history of all the kinds, the history of all the kinds that ever
can be of men and women. To many and there are always many millions
of such of them the important thing is to have written about every
one around them the history of each one, the history of that one,
of every man or woman who ever was or is or will be living for
them, the history of each one as in their living from their
beginning to their ending their history comes out from them. To
some the important thing in them is their own history, the history
of them and inside them, as in repeating it comes out of them.
There are many men and women always living and to them the
important thing in living is in the different parts of living the
being babies, children or young going to be men and women, or grown
young men and women, and growing older men and women and men and
women in their middle living, and growing old men and women, and
then the end of all of them; there are many millions then who
always think and feel about all men and women in the parts of
living and the kind of being every one has in them in those
different parts of their living. There are then many millions who
always feel this in them about others around them about themselves
inside them, the important thing to all of such of them are the
parts of living the being babies and children and young going to be
men and women and growing older men and women, and middle aged men
and women and growing old men and women and old men and old women
and then that is the end of them in their worldly living. There are
then many who feel this part living as the strongest thing in every
one around them and in themselves inside them. There are then many
millions, many many millions always living who want to know about
what each one does all through his or her living, there are many
who want to know about it in the history of every one what kind of
feeling they had in them and how these feelings then came out from
them in their living from their beginning to their ending. There
are then many kinds of feelings in each one, there are many
feelings in every one, there are many ways of having feelings
coming out of them, there are many who want to know it about every
one around them what feelings they have in them, how such feelings
come out of them, there are many millions then of women and of men
who always think about this about every one around them, they want
to know the feelings in each one of them and how it comes out from
them, what the feelings in each one make of the life of such a one.
There are many kinds of ways every one has in them of doing
everything in their daily living, there are many who want a history
of all such ways in each one. There are many who want their kind of
history of only a few of all the people ever living, there are some
who want a history coming out only from inside them, there are some
who want a history to come out only from those just around them,
there are some who want history coming out from some who were never
and will never be anywhere near them, there is every kind of
choosing, mostly every one wants a history of some one, mostly
every one wants some kind of a history of some. Some few are always
living who want about each one who ever was or is or will be living
a history of every bit of them, of every moment in their daily
living, of every kind of feeling they have in them, of every bit of
them that comes out in them in repeating, of all the feeling in
them and how it comes out from them in all of them in each one of
them from their beginning to their ending, of every kind of men and
women who ever were or are or will be living, of every part of
their being and how in each part of their living their being shows
itself in them, of the feeling in each kind of them and how it
shows in each one their kind of them, how it comes out in each one
in every part of their living from their beginning to their ending;
there are then some who want the whole history of every one, of the
kind they are in them, of everything that makes them and ever can
come out of them, of every bit of them in all their living; there
are then always some living who want of each one such a history of
them, there are some of such of them now living and sometime there
will be written by all of such of them a history of every one.</p>

<p>There are then many ways of having living inside one and having
it come out from one, always then some one looks at each one,
always the more one looks at every one the more one knows that
sometime there will be a history of every one.</p>

<p>There are then many ways of having impatient feeling in one,
there are then many ways of having an anxious feeling in one, this
is now the history of some of them and the servant queerness that
comes out of some servants who have in them impatient feeling and
anxious being and later in their living from much sitting alone in
a kitchen, from much eating without any one being then with them or
around them, from much cooking, from much directing from the
mistress in the house with them and from being with the children
living in the houses where they are working have such servant
queerness come to be in them; there are then many women and many
kinds of them who have sometimes servant queerness in them.</p>

<p>There are then every kind of women among the servants working in
every kind of kitchen. There are some who have in them servant girl
nature as the bottom of them.</p>

<p>The nature in every one is always coming out of them from their
beginning to their ending by the repeating always in them, by the
repeating always coming out from each one. Sometimes, often, one
looking at some one forgets about that one many things one knows in
that one, always soon then such a one brings it back to remember it
about that one the things one is not then thinking by the repeating
that is always in each one. Always then everybody is always
repeating the whole nature of them and to any one who looks always
at each one always the whole of that one one is then seeing keeps
coming out of such a one. So any one can know about any one the
nature of that one from the repeating that is the whole of each
one. The whole of every one is always coming out in repeating.
Always it is coming out of every one the whole nature of them in
their daily living in the repeating each one has all the time in
living. Every minute then in their living they are themselves
inside them and they are repeating always and all the repeating
together is the whole nature of every one coming out from them,
coming out from them in their daily living, coming out from them in
different ways in different moments of their living. Always then it
is coming out of each one the whole nature of that one in the daily
living of such a one in the repeating each one has all the time in
living. Each minute then in the living of each one there is inside
each one the being that makes that one and each one is repeating
always this being that makes each one that one inside to that one
and each one is repeating always and all the repeating together of
each one is coming out always from each one, coming out from each
one in the daily living each one is leading, coming out from each
one in different ways in different moments of the living of each
one.</p>

<p>Servant queerness in all of them who have servant queerness in
them comes out of such of them as the kind of nature in them; in
each one having servant queerness in them it comes out of them by
the nature of them, in the way they have always had in them
impatient feeling and anxious feeling. Impatient feeling and
anxious feeling has always been in each one of them in the way it
was natural to their kind of them to such a one of their kind of
them to have it in them and then it comes, the impatient feeling
and anxious feeling, it comes to be that these get stronger and
more mixed up in them then in such a one from their kind of living,
from the kind of eating alone and drinking, from cooking and their
kind of working, from sitting in a kitchen, it comes then that
there is in such a one servant queerness in her being and the
servant queerness is in her and comes out from her to make for her
that kind of servant queerness that comes out of the nature in
her.</p>

<p>The servants then living with the Hersland family, those who
stayed a long time with them were older foreign or foreign American
women. One of these had servant girl nature in her, she had
submission in her, she could have sometime resisting in her. This
never came to be in her in her living with the Hersland family,
with them she never had any resistance inside her. Mrs. Hersland
never had with her an angry feeling, she went away at last to take
care of a sick brother. There are then every kind of women among
the women who are sometimes servants for some one. There are then
every kind of women among foreign women among foreign American
women who are servants sometime in their living to some one. Many
of them have servant girl nature in them, many of them have servant
nature in them, many of them have a mistress nature in them, many
of them have a mixture in them; there are then all kinds of women
nature among them. About half of all of them have in them of their
kind of them independent dependent nature in them, they are the
independent dependents of their kind of them, the rest of them the
other more or less half of them the women living as servants
sometime in their living have dependent independent nature in them,
they are the dependent independents of their kind of them. The
nature in each one makes a long history of each of them and
sometime there will be a history of every one and the nature in
them and how in their servant living the nature in them comes out
from them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland got her important feeling of herself to herself
from all of them from all the servants she ever had working for her
or doing something for her in her living, Mrs. Hersland got her
important feeling of herself to herself from all of them, from
being of them and above them, from trying them, from directing
them, from having in her sometimes from some of them an injured and
an angry feeling, from having to arrange the relation of some of
them to the governess living in the house at the same time. Some of
them who had in them a certain mixture inside them never liked it
that the governess was not of them and Mrs. Hersland had strongly
then a feeling of herself to herself from making such a one
understand the position a governess had and how a servant should
behave toward such a one. Mrs. Hersland had then much important
living with the servants, she never liked any one of them to have
servant queerness in them, she never liked them to be so young that
she needed to train them, she liked them to be older foreign or
foreign American women, she liked to be of them and above them.
Mostly she had very little trouble with them, sometimes she had
troubles with the families of them, some of this will come out
later in the daily living of the Hersland children in the history
of each one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland had then sometimes troubles with the families of
them. Mrs. Hersland had her important feeling from servants who
were with her in her middle living. Mrs. Hersland had from some of
them an injured feeling, Mrs. Hersland had with some of them an
angry feeling, sometimes it was with one of them sometimes with
some one of the family of one of them. Mrs. Hersland had in her
nothing of impatient feeling, she could have in her an injured and
a bright angry feeling. Once one foreign girl had come to her from
some one in Bridgepoint who had sent her because she wanted to go
and this friend thought she would be a good servant for Mrs.
Hersland to have with her. The girl did not want to stay, she
wanted to go back to Bridgepoint, she said Mrs. Hersland should
help send her, Mrs. Hersland had then an angry feeling in her, she
said she did not have to help send her. The girl said she would
have to help a little to send her, Mrs. Hersland said she would
either not give her anything to help her or she would pay
everything for her, she never would help to send her away from her,
she would pay the whole thing for her, it was not right but she
would pay the whole thing for her, she would do it all or nothing
for her, she did not have to do anything for her, she would do the
whole thing for her. Mrs. Hersland had in her a bright angry
feeling inside her, it was wrong that a girl should behave so
toward her. Mrs. Hersland had then rightly an angry feeling in her.
She paid everything for her. This was Mrs. Hersland with an injured
feeling inside her and an angry feeling then in her. There was
nothing in her of impatient feeling in her, with servants she had
never anxious feeling in her, she had in her sometimes an injured
feeling and then an angry feeling and then she would send the one
that had given it to her away from her, then she would pay for some
one all expenses for her, when she had in her an angry feeling
inside her there was no half measure in her, often she only had an
injured feeling in her; this time she had more angry than injured
feeling in her. No one was then afraid of her, there was no terror
in her anger for any one around her. Mostly she would then pay
everything any one could in any kind of way ask of her to show them
the right angry feeling in her.</p>

<p>There was never in Mrs. Hersland a bitter feeling in the injured
or angry feeling in her with any servant in the house with her. She
did not have in her impatient feeling, she did not have with any of
them or the families of them an anxious feeling in her, she had
inside her sometimes with them or with the families of them an
injured sometimes an angry feeling in her, this never gave to her
never made bitterness for her, Mrs. Hersland never had really any
bitterness inside her, later she had a little dreary weakening
sadness in her, later she had a scared feeling in her from her
husband and her children grown big around her she never had in her
impatient feeling in her she never had any bitterness in her, she
had in her middle living for the servants and governesses and
seamstresses and dependents sometimes an injured feeling sometimes
a bright anger.</p>

<p>To have an injured or an angry feeling in one is very common in
ordinary living. Injured or angry feeling may be in one with
impatient feeling or with anxious feeling and it may be in one
without any such being then in that one. Mrs. Hersland had in her
living, mostly in the beginning and in the middle of her middle
living very much of such feeling, not much with her husband or her
children but with the servants and seamstresses and governesses and
dependents all those that gave to her the feeling of herself inside
her.</p>

<p>The independent dependent kind of men and women have in them,
most of them, mostly in their injured and their angry feeling a
sense of impatient feeling or anxious feeling with a sense of their
own virtue their own right inside them, they have not in them then
mostly a consciousness of angry or injured feeling in them, to them
then their angry feeling or their injured feeling flows from the
outraged virtue or goodness in them, to themselves then they have
not any angry or injured feeling as filling them but flowing from
them because it is natural to have such a thing in them when their
goodness or virtue is outraged by some one. Mrs. Hersland was not
such a one, she had in her dependent independent being in her, it
was to her rightly an injured or an angry feeling she had then in
her when some one around her did what it was not right for them to
do toward her, she had then to herself rightly an injured and an
angry feeling in her and to herself it was the injured or angry
feeling that filled her, it was not right for the girl to ask Mrs.
Hersland to help send her to Bridgepoint when the girl had no
reason to leave her, it was right then for Mrs. Hersland to have in
her an injured and then an angry feeling in her, it was then to
Mrs. Hersland inside her that she had in her, rightly an angry and
an injured feeling, then she would show it by doing nothing to help
the girl who had no right to ask it of her or she would pay all her
expenses for her. Mrs. Hersland had rightly in her toward her an
injured and an angry feeling, to herself then this was all that was
then in her, it was not to her her own virtue or her own goodness
that was then the important thing inside her it was the injured and
the angry feeling in her, to satisfy that she paid all the expenses
for her, she would do that or nothing for her, it was not to her
her own virtue or her own goodness that was to herself urging her
to do this for the girl who asked of her what she had no business
to ask of her, it was to herself in her the injured and the angry
feeling in her that needed to have this action to make it quiet
inside her, it was to satisfy this in her that she would do
anything or nothing for the girl who had asked her to help her when
she had no right to ask her, it was not then to herself in her a
sense of goodness and virtue in her; this makes of her her kind of
them the kind that has resisting and not attacking as the bottom
nature in them; she was of this kind of them then she had resisting
not attacking in her as the bottom nature of her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland was of this kind of them then, she had resisting
as her way of being. This is not always clear in the beginning
sometimes it is the resisting that is in appearance like attacking,
sometimes the attacking that has stubbornness or weakness in it
like resisting but more in their living this nature in them comes
out of them in the repeating that is in all being.</p>

<p>And so always whenever Mrs. Hersland had an injured or an angry
feeling in her she did such a thing to satisfy herself inside her.
This will come out more and more in her the kind of injured and
angry feeling it was natural to have in her and the way it was
natural for such feelings to come out of her. More this will be a
history of these feelings in her, more and more this will be a
history of the different ways the two kinds there are of men and
women and all the kinds of the two kinds of them have every kind of
feeling have every kind of way of having every feeling come out
from them. Sometime then there will be more telling of the way Mrs.
Hersland had injured and angry feeling. Sometime then there will be
a history of every kind of feeling Mrs. Hersland had in her in her
living and every way every feeling came out of her in her living.
There will be then in the daily living of each one of the Hersland
children there will be then in the history of the daily living of
each one of the three of them a history of all the feeling and the
way it came out of the mother of them the way it came out and so
any one could see by looking that she was her kind of them the
dependent independent kind of them the kind that have resisting as
the bottom of them, the kind that have in them to themselves
rightly in them an injured and an angry feeling and when they have
this in them have not in them strongest inside them the sense of
their own virtue or goodness then, they have then in them as the
strongest thing then to themselves inside them this injured or
angry feeling. Mrs. Hersland was of this kind of them then the
dependent independent kind of women. Sometime there will be a long
history of the two kinds of them and the feeling in them and the
way feeling comes out of them. There was then in the Hersland
middle living pleasant enough living for all of them on the ten
acre place with servants and seamstresses and governesses in the
house with them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mrs. Hersland had different seamstresses to do
different kinds of sewing for herself and her children. This is now
a history of all of them.</p>

<p>Sometime there is a history of each one, of every one who ever
has living in them and repeating in them and has their being coming
out from them in the repeating that is always in all being.
Sometime there is a history of every one. Sometime there will be a
history of every kind of men and women. Sometime there is a history
of each one. There must be such a history of each one for the
repeating in them makes a history of them. The repeating of the
kinds of them makes a history of the kinds of them, the repeating
of the different parts and ways of being makes a history in many
ways of every one. This is now a history of some. This will be
sometime a history of many kinds of them. Any one who looks at each
one will see coming out from them the bottom nature of them and the
mixing of other nature or natures with the bottom nature of
them.</p>

<p>Every one then has a history in them by the repeating that comes
out from them. There are some who will have sometime the whole
repeating of each one they have around them, they will have the
whole history of each one, there is repeating then always in every
one, there is repeating always of the kinds of all women and men.
There is repeating then always in every one; that makes a history
of each one always coming out of them. There is always repeating in
every one but such repeating always has in it a little changing;
the whole repeating then that is always coming, the whole repeating
that comes out from them every one who has living in them, the
whole repeating then in them and coming out from each one is a
whole history of each one.</p>

<p>Repeating then is always coming out of every one, always in the
repeating of every one and coming out of them there is a little
changing. There is always then repeating in all the millions of
each kind of men and women, there is repeating then in all of them
of each kind of them but in every one of each kind of them the
repeating is a little changing. Each one has in him his own history
inside him, it is in him in his own repeating, in his way of having
repeating come out from him, every one then has the history in him,
sometime then there will be a history of every one; each one has in
her her own history inside her, it is in her in her own repeating
in her way of having repeating come out from her, every one then
has the history in her, sometime then there will be a history of
every one. Sometime then there will be a history of every kind of
them every kind of men and women with every way there ever was or
is or will be repeating of each kind of them.</p>

<p>The history of each one then is a history of that one and a
piece of the history of their kind of men and women. Now there will
be a history of one and then there will be histories of many more
of them. Always then there will be long histories of each one.</p>

<p>There are then many things every one has in them that come out
of them in the repeating everything living have always in them,
repeating with a little changing just enough to make of each one an
individual being, to make of each repeating an individual thing
that gives to such a one a feeling of themselves inside them. I
said each repeating in each one has each time in it a little
changing, this sometimes comes nearly not to happening. Some keep
on copying their repeating in their talking in the moving of their
hands and shoulders and bodies in living, some keep on copying
others around them, some have almost nothing in them of themselves
inside them, every one has though always in them their own bottom
nature their own kind of being, that is always in them repeating,
that is always in them a real being.</p>

<p>Many go on all their life copying their own kind of repeating,
many go on all their life copying some one else or some other kind
of men or women's kind of repeating, some kind of being that they
have not in them. Every one mostly has in them their own repeating
sometime in their living, this is real being in them, many millions
are always all through their living copying their own repeating,
some have this in them because they are indolent in living, it is
easier for such of them just to go on with an automatic copying of
their own repeating rather than really live inside them their
repeating. This is now a history of such a one.</p>

<p>There are then always the two kinds in all who are or were or
ever will have in them human being, there are then always to my
thinking in all of them the two kinds of them the dependent
independent, the independent dependent; the first have resisting as
the fighting power in them, the second have attacking as their
natural way of fighting. As I was saying this is not always easy to
know about them, it is not always easy to know which kind of these
two kinds of being are in any one, it is hard to know it about
them, it is hard to describe what I mean by the names I give to
them. There are then these two kinds and always every one of all of
them who have human being in them are of one kind or the other kind
of them. Often, as I am saying, resisting is like attacking, the
attacking like resisting. Often the meekness of the patient
submission of the dependent side of the dependent independent kind
of them seems like the sensitive scared yielding of the dependent
side of the independent dependent kind of them. Each kind of them
has in them their own way of loving, their own way of eating and
drinking, their own way of sleeping, sitting resting and working,
their own way of learning and thinking, their own way of having
themselves come out from inside them; always there are these two
ways of being, mostly one who knows it well about them can tell
which kind each one is of them, mostly one knows about them by
always looking at them as the repeating in each one makes a history
of that one. Sometime then there will be a history of all of
them.</p>

<p>Sometime there will be a history of all of them. Sometime there
will be written a long book, a history of all of them of the two
kinds of them. Sometime it will be clear to some one the whole
history of every kind of men and women, the two kinds of them, the
kinds in each kind of them, the mixture of all of them. Sometime
then will be written a long book, a history of every kind of men
and women and all the kind of being in them.</p>

<p>Now this is a history of one of them. As I was saying Mrs.
Hersland had three seamstresses working for her when she was living
in Gossols in her middle living when she was strongest in her
feeling of being herself inside her in her living. One of these was
living in a part of Gossols between the part where the Herslands
were living where no other rich people were living and the part
where mostly all the rich people were living. She had this one to
do most of the making her child Martha's better clothing and her
own ordinary dresses for her ordinary daily living. Then she had
one who lived in a part nearer where the rich people were living,
she went to this one. Then there was the woman who lived in a small
house near them, the woman who had the three daughters who all of
them sometime had beauty in them.</p>

<p>The one who lived in between always worked twice a year in the
fall and in the spring to make dresses for Mrs. Hersland and Martha
and sometimes for the governess then living in the house with them.
She always came to work in the house with them, she always ate
there with them, and sometimes when she was in a hurry to finish
her work she remained altogether in the house sleeping and eating.
Her name was Lillian Rosenhagen. She was a large woman, she had
black hair and she was tall and she had long heavy fingers that
were tapering and heavy again just where the nails were commencing.
Lillian Rosenhagen was a stupid woman and never said anything but
the children could never forget having had her in the house with
them. She was of the kind of them and there are always many always
being made of them who have it in them to be stupid, to be heavy,
to be drifting, and yet one never forgets them when one has known
them, they do nothing but they have a physical something in them
that makes them.</p>

<p>Every kind of history about any one is important then, every
kind of way of thinking about any one is important to those who
need a whole history of every one.</p>

<p>There is then a whole to living, mostly everybody has for this
an anxious feeling, some have not any such anxious feeling to the
whole of them, many have the anxious feeling in every minute of
their living, every minute is a whole to them in an anxious feeling
which each minute ends them. As I was saying there are many ways of
having anxious feeling in them in men and women. Anxious feeling in
some is almost the whole living that they have in them, some have
the anxious feeling every minute of their living every minute is a
whole to them with an anxious feeling which each minute ends them.
Some have very much anxious feeling in them but not every minute in
their living, with some of such of them anxious feeling never makes
an end to them, it goes on repeating in them but it does not ever
to them make an end of them. Lillian Rosenhagen was such a one.
Anxious feeling was in her always inside her coming to be strong in
her whenever any little new thing was demanded of her, whenever she
had to finish arranging anything whenever in a way there was any
adjustment inside her to anything in her working or to any one
around her.</p>

<p>There are then many ways for men and for women to have anxious
feeling in them. Sometimes it is a wonder to any one who sees
anxious feeling in almost every one, in every one's making a
bargain, or selling, or buying, or hearing some one calling, or
going to sleep, or wakening, in cooking, in ordering, many times in
eating, in drinking, in coming and going. Mostly every one has in
them more or less an anxious feeling, mostly every one has in them
more or less impatient feeling, some have more anxious than
impatient feeling in them, some have almost the same amount in them
of anxious as impatient feeling in them, some have much more
impatient than anxious feeling in them, many have every minute
impatient feeling in them and every minute there is a beginning for
them, many have impatient feeling in them and this has nothing in
it of beginning for them, some have impatient feeling in them as
always an ending to them inside them, many have it in them just as
their own way of going on with their living. Anxious feeling can be
in some as always an ending to them, it can be in some as always a
beginning in them of living, there are some who have it in them as
their own way of living.</p>

<p>In many, anxious being is impatient feeling and sometime there
will be a history of many of such of them.</p>

<p>Lillian Rosenhagen had always repeating in her an anxious
feeling, she had very little in her of impatient feeling. As I was
saying Lillian Rosenhagen was very good at sewing, she was very
steady at working, she had always in her repeating an anxious
feeling when she had to do any ending or beginning.</p>

<p>Some have in them nervous feeling, this is different from an
impatient feeling, this is different from anxious being, many have
all of these mixed up in them. Lillian Rosenhagen had one kind of
an anxious feeling, she had very little impatient feeling in most
of her living, she had very little nervous being in her. This will
now be a long history of the kind of anxious being in her and how
it is different in her from in others who are made more or less
like her.</p>

<p>There is a servant queerness in some, a queerness that comes out
in them from the kind of anxious being, from the kind of impatient
feeling sometime in them which comes to be from the kind of living
servants have in them comes to be in such a one a servant queerness
and every one in the house knows it in that one. There is then a
servant queerness in many women and in some men who are working as
servants and have a servant living in them. They have many of them
a servant queerness in them and that comes out of them according to
the nature of them, according to the kind there is in them of a
bottom nature in them and the kind they have in them of mixtures
inside them which gives to them the kind that is in them of the
impatient being and anxious being in each one, the kind in them of
such being inside them that with the servant living makes inside
such a one servant queerness. There are many ways of having
queerness in many men and women. There are many who have not any
such queerness in them, many have things in them that others around
them sometime think queer in them but there are many who have not
such a kind of queerness in them that makes really a character in
them. There are many men and women who have queerness in them,
sometime there will be a history of all the kinds of them. Just now
there will not be a history of such a one. Some dressmakers have a
dress-making queerness in them, a queerness that comes from sitting
sewing and always lying and there own kind of anxious feeling and
their own kind of creating and own kind of nervous being, there are
many of such of them. Lillian Rosenhagen was not of such of them,
she had in her as I was saying anxious feeling, she had in her very
little of impatient being, there never came to be in her a
queerness inside her.</p>

<p>Lillian Rosenhagen never had any man who really wanted to marry
her. They all liked her. Mostly every one who knew her liked her.
She lived together with her mother and sometimes her sister.
Sometimes the sister sewed with her. Often this one did not live
with her mother and her sister. She had a very unpleasant
nature.</p>

<p>Everybody is always in their living repeating, some all through
their living have strong feeling in every moment of repeating in
each time their repeating comes out from them. Some have feeling
only in the beginning, repeating then goes on and on inside them;
some have feeling in them in the repeating coming out of them when
they are changing in repeating; many have very little feeling in
them in most of the repeating coming out of them in their living;
many have not enough feeling in them to make it real repeating, in
such of them it comes to be a copy of the repeating that once came
out of them in feeling; some copy others around them and make of
this a repeating in them, some make of such a copying a repeating
in feeling, some never have in such a copying a real repeating
feeling.</p>

<p>There are then many as I was saying who all their lives are
repeating and each repeating has in it as strong feeling as any
part of their being, there are many millions always being made such
of them, sometime there will be more understanding of the meaning
in this saying. There are always many millions who only sometime in
repeating have much feeling, in many of such of them repeating is
just going on because they are living and in living one always goes
on repeating, there are some who have not enough activity inside
them to go in this way in their repeating, these have to copy
themselves with a certain impulsion so as to go on repeating, they
copy themselves in their way of talking, sometimes in their loving,
often in their way of walking, of moving their hands and shoulders,
in their ways of smiling, there have been some and always will be
some who copy themselves so in all their living, in their eating
and drinking, in every moment of their daily living. I say some who
have not much activity inside them have a kind of indolent and
lethargic way of repeating, something in between just going on
repeating and copying themselves to start them to keep going;
Lillian Rosenhagen was one of such of them.</p>

<p>I say that anxious feeling comes out of each one according to
the nature of them, this has in almost every one every time it
comes in them out of them more in it of real feeling in repeating
than many things in many men and women. There are some men and
women always living who can have in them anxious feeling repeating
without much real being in such repeating. Lillian Rosenhagen was a
little such a one.</p>

<p>Sometimes then the sister Cecilia Rosenhagen would be living
with her mother and her older sister Lillian. Often she would leave
them and live away from them. The Rosenhagen sisters were both born
American. The father was not living. The mother was old then and
did nothing but a little cleaning and cooking, the daughter Lillian
did most of the supporting of the mother. Sometimes Cecilia would
be helping but she never got as much money for working as Lillian
and often she was not living with them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Lillian Rosenhagen did not have men want to
marry her. She was good looking, she was tall and dark, she was a
stupid woman. She had good dress-making instinct in her working.
She was steady in her working. She had in her anxious feeling as I
was saying, a little, every time she had to do something. Cecilia
had in her anxious feeling as excitement always in her. She had a
very disagreeable nature. She had always suspicion in her of every
one around her, anxious feeling was always an excitement to her,
she had a great deal of it in her.</p>

<p>Every one then has in their living repeating, repeating of every
kind of thing in them, repeating of the kind of anxious feeling
almost every one has more or less always in them, repeating of the
way each one has of being stupid in their living.</p>

<p>Almost every one, always each one has a way of having a kind of
stupidity inside them always repeating in their living. Every one
then has in them some kind of stupidity inside them. In each one it
is of the nature of that one, of the kind of stupid being that is
natural to their kind of them. With some their stupid being is
mixed up with anxious feeling, with some with their impatient
feeling, in some with other things in them, in some it is just
there in them it never mixes up inside them, it is just there,
always in them, it is so steady and stilly in them it does not come
out of them as repeating, it just lies there quiet, as the bottom
of them.</p>

<p>Lillian Rosenhagen was such a one. She was a stupid woman. She
had anxious feeling in her whenever any little new thing was
demanded of her, whenever she had to finish arranging anything,
whenever in any way there was any adjustment inside her to anything
in her working or to any one around her. This was the anxious
feeling in her, this had nothing to do in her with the stupid being
in her that made her.</p>

<p>In many, anxious being is impatient feeling in them, and
sometimes in many, it is a suspicious feeling always in them, in
many it is an excited feeling that keeps them always changing and
acting. In Cecilia Rosenhagen there was a little of all these three
ways of having as feeling her anxious being. Mostly it was the last
kind of them the excited way of being that was strongest in her in
her anxious feeling, she had it in her to have a good deal of
suspicious feeling, she had less in her her anxious being as
impatient feeling. In some anxious being is in them a nervous
condition.</p>

<p>As I was saying mostly every one has in them more or less
anxious being, with some it is part of their stupid being, this was
not so in the sister Lillian, it was true of the other one. Each
one of them had in her her own stupid being and now this is a
history of it in each of them.</p>

<p>Lillian Rosenhagen was four years older than her sister Cecilia.
Cecilia had a very unpleasant nature, she had nervousness in her,
she had suspicion in her, she had anxious being as excitement
always working in her. She was not a good worker, she was not a bad
worker, she could find people to employ her and they would always
be ready to keep her longer than her suspicious temper would let
her. As I was saying sometimes she would be living with her sister
and mother and then anxious being would be such an excitement
inside her that she would go away and live with any friend who
would let her. She always had a new friend who would take her, then
she would have her anxious being as a new excitement in her and she
would come back to her mother and sister. Lillian never began again
with her from any goodness inside her. She had no use for her
sister, they had no use for each other, they both had stupid being
in them and they put up with each other when they were together,
they did not quarrel with each other, they did not enough touch one
another to quarrel together.</p>

<p>They each one of them had in them their own kind of stupid
being. In Lillian stupid being was the vague bottom to her that was
always there when you looked at her. It made her, it had nothing to
do in her with the anxious feeling sometimes in her, not with any
trouble she had in her with her mother or her sister or a customer
or the daily living and everything then that happened to her. She
went on repeating because in living one goes on repeating, because
that is the way one does in living. Lillian Rosenhagen went on
living, sometimes she had a real feeling in her living, often she
had in her a kind of anxious feeling, this she had in her whenever
she had any adjusting of herself to her working, her work to a
fitting of herself to any one who had then something to do with
her. As I said she always then had a kind of anxious feeling in
her, this never came to be sorrow in her, this never came to be a
puzzled or a worried feeling in her, it was just such a kind of
anxious feeling in her that made a little feeling inside her that
was not just going on living in her, not a copying of herself in
repeating in her, not just a drifting in her, it was pretty nearly
a really anxious being in her. As I say she had a vague stupid
being as a bottom to her. Mostly she went on repeating because
repeating goes on always when any one is still living. She had a
vague stupid bottom being, this was hardly repeating, this was just
there lying in her as a bottom. She had a physical something that
made an impression, that was some attraction. Mostly men did not
want her for marrying, no man ever wanted her enough to have her
marry him. She just went on living and dress-making.</p>

<p>Every one has in them their own history inside them, in each one
the history comes out of them in the repeating that is always in
them that sometime when all the repeating in them has been done by
them and they are no longer living and so do no more repeating,
that sometime will be a whole history of each one of them.</p>

<p>Sometime then each one will be dead and they each one will do no
more repeating; there will then have been, there will then be a
whole history of each one. In some as I was saying repeating comes
almost without any changing any differing from the other repeating
in them, in some repeating always has some changing, in some
repeating has each time real feeling, in some it has so little real
feeling it is only copying their own repeating. There can be then
every kind of repeating with every degree of changing to some which
takes strong looking to be sure it is repeating. There can then be
repeating with every degree of changing, with every degree of
feeling. There can be strong feeling in each repeating and the
repeating have almost no changing. There is every kind of mixing,
there is excitement and nervous feeling in repeating that sometimes
makes it seem to be changing, there is nervous or excited or
anxious being around repeating that makes it sometimes seem like a
fresh feeling. Even in anxious being there can be repeating without
fresh feeling. There can be every kind of mixing, this is a history
of some of them.</p>

<p>Repeating then is always coming out of every one, almost always
in the repeating in every one and coming out of them there is a
little changing. All the repeating in each one makes a history of
each one always coming out of them. There is always repeating in
every one but such repeating has almost always in it a little
changing, the whole repeating then that is always coming the whole
repeating that comes out of them every one who has living in them
and coming out from each one is a whole history of each one.</p>

<p>Lillian and Cecilia Rosenhagen each in their own way of being
had both of them very little changing in their repeating, very
little fresh feeling in their repeating. Lillian Rosenhagen had as
I was saying always when she had to do finishing or beginning or a
little adjusting of anything or of herself to any one around her,
had always then a little anxious being that had always in it a
little feeling, that had always in it very little changing, it was
very much the same repeating. Mostly, in her ways of doing there
was very little in her of fresh feeling, mostly when she was with
others there was in her very little of fresh feeling, she was just
copying herself in her movements in repeating or else she had in
her a little drifting; she had in her as a bottom her indolent and
stupid being that was in her but hardly came out of her as
repeating. She had almost nothing in her ever of impatient feeling.
Cecilia Rosenhagen was very different from her sister Lillian. She
had in her anxious feeling as the bottom and the whole of her
being. No man wanted her to marry him. It was different with her
from her sister Lillian, it was for a different reason. Cecilia
Rosenhagen had in her anxious being as the bottom and the whole of
her being. In her, anxious being was always in her excited feeling,
any one who saw her knew this in her; in her, injured feeling was
always suspicious feeling, every one felt this strongly with her
after a very little of her; she always had a new woman friend to
pity her and to commence with her, she never had any man who wanted
to take care of her or marry her. It was different in her from her
sister Lillian, neither of them ever came to marrying.</p>

<p>Cecilia Rosenhagen was a true spinster. Lillian Rosenhagen was
not married because nobody had came to want her enough to take her.
These two were very different in nature.</p>

<p>There is every kind of being in women who have it in common to
have a spinster nature. Later there will be much discussing of this
spinster nature. Now it is enough to know that Cecilia Rosenhagen
had it in her.</p>

<p>So then they went on with their living to their ending Lillian
and Cecilia Rosenhagen. No man ever married either one of them.
They both went on in their own way living and dress-making to their
ending. Mrs. Hersland liked to have Miss Lillian Rosenhagen in the
house working. She was a good young woman for dress-making, she
never gave to Mrs. Hersland anything of an injured or angry
feeling.</p>

<p>It is very common to have in one injured or angry feeling inside
one. Injured or angry feeling it is common to have inside in every
one. Injured or angry feeling it is common to have sometime in
almost every one. Anxious feeling and impatient feeling are more or
less and sometime in almost every one. Every one has sometime
something of such feelings in them. It is very common to have the
injured or the angry feeling in one mixed in one with the impatient
feeling and the anxious feeling sometime in almost every one.
Anxious feeling, impatient feeling, injured feeling, angry feeling
are all sometime in each one in almost every one who ever was or is
or will be living. In many then impatient feeling and anxious being
are mixed up in them in the injured feeling and the angry feeling
almost every one has sometime in them. There are many then that
have this mixture in them. The way it comes out of them, the way
these feelings mix up in them, the way they mix up with other
things in them make of each man or woman their kind of man or
woman, make them one of the two kinds of men and women, make of
them one of the many kinds in each of the two kinds of them. There
are then many who have mixed up in them anxious being, impatient
feeling, injured and angry feeling. Almost every one has in them
their kind of stupid being, mostly every one who knows any one
knows this in them. There are some who have their stupid being
mixed up in them with their kind of anxious being, their kind of
impatient feeling, their kind of injured, their kind of angry
feeling.</p>

<p>Lillian Rosenhagen had very little of any of this mixing. She
did have a very little sometimes in her injured feeling in her,
there was never very much of such feeling in her but when there was
such feeling in her when there was a little an injured feeling
inside her it was never in her impatient feeling or anxious feeling
or even angry feeling; but she could have sometimes in her a very
little injured feeling inside her and this in her was connected
inside her with the vague stupid being that was a bottom to her.
That makes the being clear in her, there was almost nothing in her
ever of impatient feeling and very little in her ever of angry
feeling inside her. There was in her anxious being but that never
had anything to do with the vague stupid being that was the bottom
to her. There was in her not often but real in her sometimes an
injured feeling that was not in her ever connected with the anxious
feeling often in her with the anxious being of her, it was
connected when it was in her, this injured feeling which was very
real in her the times it came to be inside her it was connected in
her it was part in her of the vague stupid being that was the
bottom to her. This had very little in her ever to do with a love
matter, almost never, almost never with her sister, a little more
with her mother, almost never with a customer, it just sometimes
came to be in her. As I said of her she had a physical something
that went with the vague stupid bottom of her, that was pleasant in
her, it was vague in her, she had never impatient feeling, or in
living, anxious feeling, or in loving injured or angry feeling. No
man came to ever want to marry her, she went on to her ending
living and dress-making and now this is all the history of her.</p>

<p>With Cecilia Rosenhagen it was a different matter. Cecilia had a
very different nature from her sister. No man ever wanted to marry
her but it was a different matter from that in the case of her
sister. In Lillian's case it was that no man had ever come to want
her, no man ever wanted to have Cecilia; that was quite a different
matter. Everything in her came from her bottom nature, she always
had excitement in her, she always had repeating in her and all the
repeating in her was filled with the excitement always in her. She
had not much impatient feeling in her, she had very much anxious
feeling in her, she did not have very much real anger in her, she
had always very much injured being in her. In her, injured being,
anxious being, was a suspicious excited state inside her, these
were always in her, these filled her when she was living with her
sister, when she left her, when she came back to her sister and her
mother, when she was living with any friend who would have her,
when she was working for or leaving any one who employed her.
Anxious being was always in her, it was always in her as injured
feeling and an excited suspicious being, that made the whole of
her. This did not come to be active in her very much from her
sister, a little from her mother, more from any friend who let her
live with her, a little from any one who employed her, but mostly
she had it in her from everything around her, from every moment of
being in her. Excited suspicious living of anxious being and
injured feeling, that was the whole of her. She always had a new
friend who let her stay with her and then she went to another and
so on until she came back again to her mother and her sister and so
on to begin again with another. This was a history of her, she was
not a good workwoman but not a bad one either, she was good enough
so that she would always find some one to employ her, she would
always leave them while they were yet willing to keep her, she
would have anxious feeling then in her as excitement, as a
suspicious feeling, as an injured feeling in her and so then now
there is a whole history of her. Sometime perhaps there will be
another history of her. There were then in Gossols in Mrs.
Hersland's middle living three sets of women who did her
dress-making. There were Lillian Rosenhagen and her sister Cecilia
who worked for her in the house with her to make the ordinary
dresses for her and her little girl Martha and sometimes for the
governess then living with her, there was the woman who lived in a
small house near the Herslands then in that part of Gossols where
no other rich people were living, who did just working over and
ordinary sewing, and there was then another dress-maker who lived
in the richer quarter who made Mrs. Hersland's best dresses for
her. There will be now a history of her.</p>

<p>There is a certain kind of women who have in them independent
dependent nature in a certain kind of way in them. They have not
servant girl nature in them. They have their own way of having
independent dependent nature in them. This is now a history of one
of them.</p>

<p>Such of them have more or less fear in them, they have very
little in them of anxious being, they have some impatient feeling
in them, they have courage in them and they have fear in them and
they have a little impatient being and they have in them almost
nothing of anxious being. As I was saying they have not in them
servant girl nature in them.</p>

<p>They have not in them servant girl nature in them, they have in
them very little of anxious being, they have in them only a little
impatient being, they have not in them much injured being, they can
have in them angry feeling. There are many ways then for women and
for men to have anxious being in them. These then have very little
anxious being in them, they have independent dependent nature in
them and so they have attacking in them as their natural way of
fighting. There are many women who seem from the kind of movement
in them when they are doing anything in any way attacking anything
in their living, there are many women who have then always in them
something that seems anxious being in them. Such of them have
attacking in them as their way of fighting but they have weakness
in them or a sensitive being in them or a vague being in them or an
empty being in them as the bottom of them. These then have
attacking as their natural way of fighting, many of them have
attacking in them always only from some one else acting on them,
some one else giving them ideas for fighting, some one else using
them for living, some one else needing them for protecting or else
because they are at the last need in them for some other thing.
There are many many millions always being made of such of them,
they are wonderful instruments for other people's living, they
never know it in them that it is other people's lives they are
living. As I was saying these have in them always in attacking
something that is like anxious being in them, but this is mostly
not true of them, it is mostly not true of them that they have
anxious being in them for most of them and there are many men and
many women of them most of them have not it in them to have
consciously and most of them not to have any kind of fear in them.
One must have some kind of fear in one to have in one really
anxious being, servant girl women have always such fear in them,
dependent independent men and women have almost always fear in
them, these have bottom earth feeling in them, they feel their
pulses to see if they are living, any one with bottom earth feeling
in them can have at some time fear in them, but this is not what is
now being written.</p>

<p>Independent dependent men and women have attacking as a natural
way of fighting in them, all independent dependent men and women
have attacking as the natural way of fighting, the kind of
independent dependent men and women, these of that kind of them who
have very much in them of weakness or sensitive being or vague or
vacant being as the bottom of them such of them have in them when
it comes to them to have fighting in their living and most of them
have a great deal in them of fighting, some of them have it in them
then to conquer whatever it is in the bottom of them that does not
help them in fighting, some of them harden themselves harden the
weakness in them so that it does not stop them, some fill
themselves with angry feeling to concentrate in them the vague
being they have inside them as a bottom to them, some just go ahead
with the vacant being lying there in them they go ahead and it
gives to such of them a being like an anxious feeling but it is not
fear in such of them it is only the vacant being in them, some get
so strongly in them the fighting for some one around them that it
takes away from them in attacking the sensitive feeling that might
stop them. In all of such of them there is to one looking at them
anxious being in them but this is not really in them, it is only
the halting that comes to them in attacking from the kind of bottom
in them, from the weakness or sensitive being or vague or empty
being that makes the bottom of each one of such of them. These then
have in them halting in attacking, they have not in them really
anxious being, they have not in them really fear in them, they have
not in them servant girl nature in them, they have not in them
dependent independent nature in them, they have not really
resisting in them, they may help their attacking by a kind of
stubbornness in them but this is never in such of them real
resisting in them and sometime every one who lives near them learns
to know it in them. The halting in them then in their beginning an
attacking gives to such of them then an appearance to them not of
timidity in them but of anxious being in them, sometimes anxious
nervous being in them. They have not then really anxious being in
them. Some time there will be here a history of many of them. The
other seamstress who did sewing for Mrs. Hersland in her middle
living, the one who lived in that part of Gossols where richer
people were living, the one that made for Mrs. Hersland then all
her best dresses the ones she used for visiting, this woman then
was of a kind of woman as I was saying who have in them very little
of anxious being or impatient being, sometimes impatient being, a
little of angry feeling, sometimes some injured feeling. She was
not of them I have just been describing. She is near them but not
altogether of them. She has not much attacking in her living, she
has more gayety in being. She is of the kind very closely like the
kind I have been just describing but she is of a different kind of
women from them. She has not in her any servant girl being, she has
in her independent dependent being, she has in her attacking as her
way of fighting but she has not much fighting in her being, she has
gayety in her being, she does good dress-making, this is now a
history of her kind of women and there are men too who have this
kind of being. This is a history of a kind then of men and women.
This is a history of one woman of this kind of men and women.
Always then of each kind of being there are both men and women.
Sometimes there are more women of that kind of them mostly made
than men, sometimes there is a kind of being that comes oftener as
men than women. Almost always in every kind of being there are
millions always being made of men and women of that kind of them.
Men have in them and women have in them some of them dependent
independent nature in them, some of them independent dependent
nature in them. There are many kinds of each of these two kinds of
being men and women have in them. In all the kinds that are always
in the world existing of each kind of them there are always some
millions of men and some millions of women. This will come out
clearer always as the history of every one of every kind who ever
has or has had or will have human being in them comes to be
written. So then there was a woman Mary Maxworthing who did
dress-making in Gossols and lived in that part of Gossols where
richer people were living, there was this woman who had independent
dependent being and had in her a certain kind of being and there
are always being made many millions of women and there are always
being made millions of men who have in them the same kind of being
she had in her in her living.</p>

<p>She had attacking in her as her way of fighting but she did not
have much fighting in her living, she had in her very little
anxious being, she had in her a very little impatient being, she
had gayety in living, she could have prudish feeling, she was a
good work-woman.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing was clever not brilliant in dress-making, she
had gayety in her living, she had very little in her of attacking,
she had almost nothing in her of anxious being, she had very little
fear in living, she had a little in her of impatient being, she had
sometimes in her, injured feeling. She had not in her a stupid
bottom to her, she had very little stupid being in her. She was as
I said a very good dress-maker. She had as I was saying independent
dependent being, when there was fighting in her there was attacking
but there was very little fighting in her living, when there was
weakness in her of the bottom giving way in her that is always in
those who have the dependent side of independent dependence in
them, when that weakness came to be yielding in her it was a
sensitive yielding in her but there was very little of this in her,
there was very little weakness or sensitive yielding at the bottom
in her. She had almost no fear in her, very little bottom yielding
in her, she had almost no anxious feeling ever in her, she had
almost no stupid being at the bottom of her, she had a little
impatient being in her, she had sometimes a little injured being in
her; any stupid being in her was connected with the little
impatient being in her, with the injured feeling sometimes in her.
The difference between her and the other kind of women I have been
just describing, the kind who have much bottom in them of sensitive
being or weakness or vague being or empty being, with much in them
of attacking, with very little in them of anxious being for they
have not in them the kind of sense that gives fear inside them to
men and women, the women then who have halting in attacking halting
that looks like nervous anxious being in them not like timid being,
the difference between such ones and such a one as the dress-maker
Mary Maxworthing will come out later in the history of the Hersland
daughter Martha, in the history of Julia Dehning. Now there is a
history of Mary Maxworthing and her business of dress-making.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing then lived her own life, had her own way of
dressmaking, she was not of them who lived other people's lives in
living There are many of such of them many who have an instrument
nature in them, many who have attacking in them as their natural
way of fighting but have at the bottom of them sensitive being or
weakness as the bottom of them or vacant being as the bottom of
them or vague being as the bottom of them. Such of them have it in
them often to live other people's lives in their living, some have
it less some have it more in them, it depends in them on the
proportion in them of fighting power in them, in the relation in
them of the attacking instinct in them with the other bottom in
them, it depends in them on the way stubbornness is in them, in the
way stupid being is in them; the more there is in them of stupid
being or stubborn being in them the more there is in such of them
of resisting, of living their own lives in their living. There are
some of them who have sensitive being or vacant being or weakness
as a bottom to them or vague being in them to so completely fill
them that it makes a personality in them and then they live their
own lives in their living.</p>

<p>Sometime there will be some understanding of this nature in men
and in women, soon it will show in Martha Hersland and in Julia
Dehning, soon it will show a little in a sister of the first
governess the Herslands had ever living with them. Mr. Hersland had
a nature in him that has a connection with the kind of nature that
I have been just describing, a connection in one direction, Mary
Maxworthing had a connection in another direction. The relation who
worked with Mary Maxworthing a young woman Mabel Linker had a far
away connection with such of them. Lillian Rosenhagen was not at
all of this kind of them, she had a vague bottom but she had
dependent independent being. She was of a different nature.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing then in her later living was very successful in
her business of dress-making, I don't mean to say she ever made a
fortune, she never did make a fortune, she earned a very good
living. She was very successful in dress-making, she never earned
real distinction, she never in living did really very personal
creating but she lived her own life in her living and she had a
fairly successful life from her beginning to her ending. She had
men who wanted her to marry them, when she was thirty-five she did
marry and she married very well then, not well enough to give up
dressmaking but well enough to be very comfortable in living.</p>

<p>She had working with her Mabel Linker, she had other girls
working for her but Mabel Linker was a kind of a partner. She was
the daughter of a cousin of Mary's sister-in-law and was a very
good almost brilliant dress-maker. Sometimes the two had a hard
time keeping together, Mabel Linker was a little flighty sometimes
and sometimes Mary Maxworthing had an impatient temper, always she
had a little impatient being in her.</p>

<p>I like to tell it better in a woman the kind of nature a certain
kind of men and women have in living, I like to tell about it
better in a woman because it is clearer in her and I know it
better, a little, not very much better. One can see it in her
sooner, a little, not very much sooner, one can see it as simpler,
things show more nicely separated in her and it is therefore easier
to make it clear in a description of her. Such a nature as Mary
Maxworthing had in her is of the kind of nature that many men and
women have in them. It is clearer in her than in a man like her and
so I will describe it in her. Sometime it will be clearer just why
and how different her kind in a man is from her, this will all be
clearer later. Now this is a history of Mary Maxworthing, and her
dress-making and how Mabel Linker lived with her. It is very
interesting that every one has in them their kind of stupid being.
It is very important to know it in each one which part in them,
which kind of feeling in them is connected with stupid being in
them. Sometime there will be a history of every kind of stupid
being in every kind of human being in every part of the living of
each one from their beginning to their ending.</p>

<p>Always it is important to know it in each one the stupid being
in them and the way it is connected in them with the important
being in them that makes each one that one, sometime then there
will be a long history of every kind of way any one can have
stupidity inside them. It is very important then to know it in each
one and sometime every one looking at any one can learn to know it
in that one. Sometime every one looking at any one will learn to
know it in that one. Now there will be a description of it in every
one. Now there will be a description of it in Mary Maxworthing.
There will be a description of the kind of stupid being Mary
Maxworthing had in living, of the kind of stupid being the other
kind of women I was describing have in them, the stupid being Mabel
Linker had in her in her living.</p>

<p>Stupid being then is in every one, in some it is with the bottom
in them, in some with the other nature or natures in them, in some
with the feeling coming out of them. In some it is always
repeating, in some it is only rarely repeating, there is every kind
of accent in repeating stupid being, sometime there will be a
history of all of them.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one has stupid being in them. It is very
important to know it in each one the kind of stupid being in them.
Stupid being is not foolish being, it is not dull or senseless
being, it is sometimes foolish being, it is sometimes dull or
senseless being, it is not always any very certain kind of being,
it is always in each one and sometime it comes in some fashion out
of every one. Stupid being then will soon be certain in each one.
This is now a history of stupid being in some. Stupid being then is
somewhere in each one, in every one there is in them the stupid
being that is natural to them, that makes their kind of them. There
is then in every one their kind of stupid being and it comes out in
each one according to the nature of that one. In some, stupid being
is resisting. In many then who have independent dependent nature in
them resisting is the stupid being in them. In those who have in
them dependent independent nature, in them stubbornness is a
resisting that is natural in them with their kind of knowing,
resisting in such of them is not the stupid part of them. Each one
as I was saying has in them their kind of stupid being, the kind of
stupid being that is natural to their kind of them.</p>

<p>I say then in many who have independent dependent nature in them
who have attacking as the natural way of fighting in them, who have
weakness or vagueness or sensitiveness or emptiness as the natural
bottom of them, in all of such of them stubborn resisting is almost
always a part in them of the stupid nature in them, of the stupid
nature every one has in them.</p>

<p>This was not so in Mary Maxworthing. She almost never had in her
any stubborn resisting, the stupid being in her came with the
impatient being in her, with angry feeling sometimes in her, with
the injured feeling sometimes in her. She had really very little
stupid being in her, she had not any stupid kind of bottom to her.
She did not have really very much bottom in her, she had in her
gayety and sensitive being in her enough to give her a sympathetic
flavor, and a very little attacking in her but enough to make
successful living in her, and impatient being in her enough to make
it sometimes unpleasant to live with her, and impatient and angry
feeling in her enough to give a stupid being to her, and injured
feeling in her enough to keep her sense of responsibility to
herself alive inside her. This is a history of her.</p>

<p>This is now another history of her, this is now a history of
what happened to her. This is now a history of her and of Mabel
Linker who lived with her.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing was one of the children of an American man and
woman who had made a good enough living at farming.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing was one of the children of an American man and
woman who had made a good enough living at farming. They still had
a farm and some of their children lived with them. Their name was
changed some in their American living. Mary came to Gossols to work
for her living when she was about sixteen. She first earned her
living by taking care of children. She did not find this very
amusing. She liked children but she wanted freedom. She began to
think when she was about twenty-one of some other way of earning a
living. She thought over everything, a little dairy to sell butter
and eggs and milk and cream but she did not like that kind of work
and it takes a great deal of money to begin. She thought of
millinering but she was not a very good hand at hat trimming, she
was very good at sewing but she knew nothing about cutting and
fitting. She was then about twentyfive when she came to this
decision, when she decided to do dress-making. As I was saying she
knew then nothing about cutting and fitting, she was very good at
sewing, she had good ideas about dresses for women, she had a good
sense of fashion. So then she sent for her relation Mabel Linker
who lived down in the country to come and join her. She went on
working at being nursery governess to earn a living for the two of
them while Mabel was to learn cutting and fitting and dress-making
from the beginning. Mabel Linker was soon very clever at
dress-making. Soon they were ready to begin. Then they started an
establishment for dress-making in that part of Gossols where richer
people were living. They did not then have success with their
undertaking.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing had a certain gayety in being. She had not
liked farming, she did not like taking care of children. She did
not like farming for that is a dreary way of living, not that she
was a discontented person but she liked a certain gayety in living.
She had no wildness in her being, she was not really a thoughtless
person, she was not a very conscientious person but she was
conscientious enough for ordinary living, she was conscientious the
way most people are in living, there was nothing reckless in her
being. She had a kind of responsibility to others and to herself in
her living, she was not at all a wild or stupid being.</p>

<p>They were at first not successful in their business of
dress-making, they had troubles with each other and with not having
money enough to keep going until they had customers enough to pay
them. As I say Mary Maxworthing never liked the Maxworthing way of
living, she never liked farming, it was to her a dreary way of
living, she did not find it very pleasant taking care of children
because it left her no freedom for living. She preferred
dress-making and it was very disappointing when she was at first
not successful in this undertaking.</p>

<p>They had not enough customers to pay them to keep going, Mary
Maxworthing soon used up all the money she had saved up to begin
this undertaking, soon then the two of them began quarreling, soon
then they had for a while to give up dress-making; Mary had to go
back to her place and once more begin to earn a living by taking
care of children.</p>

<p>This was the way it came to an end for them the first effort for
freedom, for Mary from nursery governessing, for Mabel Linker from
sewing other people's cutting and fitting.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing had in her something of a despairing feeling
when her undertaking came to such a helpless ending, when she had
to go back to nursey governessing, when she had not any of the
money left that she had been saving for five years for this
undertaking. Mary Maxworthing always had a certain stylish elegance
in dressing, she had a good sense for fashion and a feeling for
gayety without any wildness in her living. There was nothing wild
in her being, nothing reckless ever in her feeling, she had pride
but not too much pride in her being, she had a reasonable amount of
good sense and conscientiousness in living, she had started her
undertaking with too much ambition for the money she had been
saving and the talent she and Mabel Linker had between them. That
is to say more money so that they could keep on longer waiting for
people to know them or more distinction in their working might have
kept them going; but with the money they had for waiting and the
talent there was in the two of them they were too ambitious in
their beginning. What they had between them was not enough for such
an ambitious beginning as they had made of their undertaking. Mary
Maxworthing liked distinction, she had a certain ambition, she had
not much attacking in her for winning but she had a certain kind of
certainty of successful doing; she had impatient being, she had a
certain gayety in her being. Mabel Linker had not any sense in her
to keep any one else with her from doing anything foolish, not that
she would of herself have made such a beginning but she had not the
energy in her for beginning, she had not the kind of sense in her
for judging, she could never have any judgment of any way of
beginning. Then they had trouble in their living. As I was saying
Mary Maxworthing had gayety in being, she had very little almost
not any anxious being; she had independent dependent being and
attacking was her natural way of fighting but there was very little
fighting in her being, she had in her as a bottom a little but not
very much sensitive being; she had in her as a bottom almost not
any stupid being. She had in her some impatient being, she could
have in her a little injured being, she could have in her angry
feeling, but mostly it was the impatient being that sometimes was
nervous impatient being that made her interfering, that made her
always sure of knowing, that was the stupid side to her being, that
made the trouble between her and Mabel Linker when they were then
working together. Mabel Linker had very little common sense, she
had little twittering flighty ways in her but she was a good sewer,
she was a good cutter and fitter, she was almost a brilliant
dress-maker, but she had very little stability in her character.
Mary Maxworthing began with almost an idolising of her and then
there came trouble when they began living together. Then the money
was all gone and they both had become a little bitter. Mary had
then almost a despairing feeling in her. Mabel took it all as a
thing that had happened to her and now there would be some other
thing to happen to her. She took it not so much lightly as as a
thing that was over and that was all there was about it to her.</p>

<p>This was only the beginning of trouble for her but she always
took it as it came to her, not lightly but simply and flightily as
it happened to her.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing had in her something of a despairing feeling at
the failure of her undertaking, at her return to nursery
governessing. At first she did not even get a position so she lived
on with Mabel Linker who did enough work to support her. Mary
Maxworthing had a miserable feeling then in her, she had not an
anxious feeling in her because a living for her was always around
her, she could always find people to employ her she had this always
in her, but she had for the first time in her living in her a
discouraged sense of failure.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing then had, for her, a very helpless dreary
feeling at the failure of her undertaking. As I was saying it was
not in her anxious being for she knew very well she never would
have any real trouble earning a living but there was then for her
no freedom in living, no distinction for her in the future. So she
had in her, for her, really a despairing feeling. It was not a
desperately despairing feeling but it was really, for her, a
despairing feeling. She and Mabel Linker still continued to live
together. Mabel Linker went to work right away for another
dress-maker, it was hard work for her but this did not make really
any very great difference to her. For a little while then Mary
depended on Mabel Linker to support her, after a little while some
one employed her to help out in a little store near her. She stayed
there all of that summer. Later she went to a friend of the last
person who had employed her as a nursery governess for her, and
every one who knew her thought that the future now was settled for
her.</p>

<p>Every one who knew her had a certain feeling about her. Every
one who knew her had a secure feeling about her. There are many
ways every one knowing any one feel in them the character of that
one. There are very many ways then for people to feel other people
around them. There are some who make almost every one who knows
them have the same kind of feeling about them. In a way Mary
Maxworthing was such a one. Mabel Linker was not the least bit such
a one, almost every one who knew her had a different feeling. With
Mary Maxworthing it was a different matter, some liked her and some
did not like her, but whether one liked her or did not like her
each one had about the same feeling about her, about the same
estimate of her. It is a queer thing though with women and with men
too like her, they can astonish every one and Mary Maxworthing had
this in her. There are always many millions of women and of men
being made like her. This is now a history of the feeling about
her, the estimate every one who knew her had of her, of the thing
in her that was a surprise to every one who knew her. The kind she
is will then always come to be clearer. Always one must remember
each one has their own way of feeling other people's nature.</p>

<p>There are then some kinds of men and women, some men and some
women of some kinds of nature who have it in them to have every one
who knows them have about the same idea of them. Some may like,
some may dislike them, some may be indifferent to such a one but
all of them every one who ever comes to know that one has about the
same estimate of such a one. This is now a history of such a
one.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing was then such a one. She had a certain gayety
in living but no wildness no recklessness in her being and no one
would think such a thing from the certain pleasant gayety she had
in living. She had attacking in fighting but really very little
attacking fighting in her living and no one ever expected not to
have it more strongly in her being than it really came to be seen
as it came out of her. She had no reserve of fighting in her, every
one who knew her knew just about how much strength she had in her.
She had a little impatient being, a little unpleasant temper in
her, a little insistence on interfering in her, a small amount of
pride in her, enough of sensitive response to make a reasonable
sweetness in her, a little tendency to angry and injured feeling in
her but not very much of this in her not more of this in her than
any one would expect from her. She had a reasonable sense of
responsibility in her, a reasonable efficiency in her, she was in
short what every one thought her. She could still then surprise
every one who knew her. She was still then really what every one
had thought her. It was what no one who knew her ever thought of
her that the quality of being in her could ever lead her to have a
certain thing happen, it did happen to her, this is a history of
her then and how she really was what every one thought her. She
really was what every one thought her, every one who knew her had
about the same estimate of her, every one who knew her was
surprised by something that happened to her. This is a history then
of what happened to her and then how later a reasonable success
came to her.</p>

<p>After she had to give up the dress-making, after she had used up
all the money she had saved for that undertaking she had in her
almost a despairing feeling, not anything of an anxious feeling, a
little impatient feeling, nothing then of an angry or injured
feeling. She had not then as I was saying anything of an anxious
feeling, she was always certain of being able to earn a living, she
had no fear in her in living, she had a despairing feeling for the
loss of freedom and possible success and distinction, she had an
impatient feeling, not altogether an irritable feeling, it was more
in the nature of a purely impatient feeling because she had to go
back to taking care of children. This altogether made in her
something very nearly a despairing feeling in her. She was then as
I was saying still living with Mabel Linker. She had not yet found
a position but this was not then worrying her, she knew she could
always earn a living, she had in her then her kind of despairing
feeling. Mabel Linker was earning then enough to support herself
and her. This is now what happened to both of them.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing as I was saying was really whatever any one who
knew her thought her and yet she now had something happen to her
that surprised every one who knew her.</p>

<p>She had as I was saying in her then a kind of a despairing a
little an impatient feeling, she had no really anxious or excited
or fearful being then in her, she knew she could always get a good
place for people always wanted her. She was then as I was saying
not a very young woman. For the rest of the summer she finally
began working in a store near her, then later she got a good
position as nursery governess and everything was satisfactory to
her. Mabel Linker was working then in the beginning of winter
around in houses sewing but she expected soon to begin again
working for herself, it was she now who had a chance in her of a
future. Mary Maxworthing said nothing then of working with her. One
day Mary Maxworthing took a day off to go to the hospital to see a
doctor. She went alone not even Mabel Linker was with her.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mary Maxworthing was what every one thought her.
Every one had about the same estimate of her. Something happened to
her that surprised every one who knew her, surprised them that it
should happen to her.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing had not any recklessness or wildness in her.
She had very little weakness in her. She had a certain ambition a
certain desire for freedom and distinction. She had no anxious
being or fear in her, she had not very strong desires in her, she
had a certain gayety in her, she had a reasonable sense of
responsibility inside her, she had a certain delicacy and good
sentiment in her, she was what every one who knew her thought her.
She had a little impatient feeling in her. She went in to the
doctor, the doctor asked her a few questions and then examined her,
"you know what's the matter with you," he said to her. She grew
red, she had a little impatient feeling in her, she had no fear in
her and no angry feeling in her. "I don't know what's the matter
with me Doctor," was her answer.</p>

<p>She had I was saying never any anxious feeling in her, she never
really had any fear in her. She did have a little impatient feeling
always in her. She had had after the failure of her undertaking a
little of a despairing feeling. Now she did not have this in her.
When the doctor said that to her she had no fear or anxious being
in her, she grew a little red, she had a little nervous impatience
then in her. "You know what's the matter with you!" said the
doctor. "I don't know what's the matter with me," was her answer.
The doctor was a young man, he grew angry and he told her. She grew
redder, she had more impatient feeling in her but she had very
little shame or anxious feeling in her, she had a little more
impatient feeling in her. "You'd better get him to marry you," said
the doctor who was angry with her. It is very interesting that
every one has in them their kind of stupid being. It is very
important to know it in each one which part in them; which kind of
feelings in them is connected with stupid being in them. Sometime
there will be a history of every kind of stupid being in every kind
of human being in every part of the history of each one from their
beginning to their ending.</p>

<p>There is then stupid being in every one. As I was saying Mary
Maxworthing had very little stupid being in the bottom in her
being, her stupid being was mostly mixed up with her impatient
being with her possible angry or injured feeling. The doctor was
angry at her saying that she did not know what was wrong with her,
he thought it was stupid bottom being in her or a way of deceiving
in her, it was the stupid being in her that went with the impatient
being in her. Sometime this will be clear in her. The doctor then
was angry with her, "you know what is the matter with you!" he said
to her. She did not then say anything farther, she was not
interested in what the doctor had further to say to her. It was of
no importance to her. She had then finished the stupid being in her
that went with the impatient being in her. She was through with
being stupid in that kind of way of not knowing whether it had
really happened to her. Later impatient feeling stupid being would
be again in her, this will show in the later history of her but now
she knew what was the matter with her; she went home and it got
told to Mabel Linker. It was told to Mabel Linker, Mary Maxworthing
told it very directly to her, "I don't care I want a baby, so much
the worse for me getting it in this way but I want it anyway." Mary
said this always after she had told her.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing then had a baby in her, it had happened to her
and it was a surprise to every one who knew her who learned it
about her. It was the very last thing any one would have expected
to happen to her. One would have thought surely Mary Maxworthing
would make a man marry her before such a thing would happen to her.
It was a surprise to every one who knew her. But she was always
then the same that every one thought her only, as she said, alright
there is nothing to say about it, it had happened to her. That was
the end of the fact for her, that was not the end of the trouble
for her, that was the end of the fact for her. As I was saying Mary
had stupid being in her connected in her with the impatient feeling
she had in her, with the injured feeling she could have sometime in
her. She had no stupid being as a bottom to her, by and by this
will be clearer. Mabel Linker had a hard time taking care of her.
Gradually the people who employed her knew what had happened to
her. They were surprised too that it could happen to her, she said
nothing to explain how it had happened, she said, alright it has
happened and she liked children and now she would have one. There
was no hardness in her, there was then no really anxious being in
her. It had happened and that was the end of that matter to her.
Soon every one who knew her had the same feeling about what had
happened to her. Every one continued to have the same opinion of
her whether they liked her or whether they did not like her as they
had had before this happened to her, then every one who knew her
had still the same estimate of her.</p>

<p>She was then without real anxious feeling, the people who
employed her were patient with the impatient being then in her.
Mabel Linker took good care of her and stood all the impatient
being then in her, the impatient being that was stupid being then
in her, the impatient being that was irritating then in her to
every one near her, the impatient being that made her very
interfering and rather nagging. This is now a history of what now
happened to her and how Mabel took care of her, and of Mabel Linker
and how they did and did not get along together, and what each one
of them felt about the other.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker were from the same part of the
country. They had always known each other. Mary was the elder.
Mabel was about five years younger. Mabel Linker's cousin had
married Mary Maxworthing's sister. Mary Maxworthing had always
known Mabel Linker and had always been very fond of her. When Mabel
came to Gossols to learn dress-making Mary almost idolised her.
They were then always together, Mabel then always did what Mary
told her. Mabel was then a stranger, Mary Maxworthing had already
been in Gossols many years then and she took care of her. They got
along very well together. As I was saying Mabel learned cutting and
fitting and soon became very clever almost brilliant in
dress-making, she had not the sense for fashion, she had not the
sense for managing, she had very little sense about anything, she
had to have some one to do directing and Mary Maxworthing did this
for her in the beginning completely to Mabel's satisfaction.
Satisfaction is not the right word for describing Mabel's feeling.
In Mabel satisfaction was the not being aroused to escaping or
resisting or in fact to any conscious feeling. Anyway they got on
then very well in living and dress-making. Mary then had very
little impatient being, her impatient being had then nothing
nervous in it, not that she ever came to be a nervous person, her
impatient being was not then too interfering and then too at that
time she had for Mabel almost an idolising feeling. She liked to
write down when she was sitting idling, "Mabel is an angel, angel
Mabel," and this showed her feeling. She wrote this down with a
pencil whenever she was sitting doing nothing, this was in the
beginning when Mabel was learning dress-making, when they were
first living together. It was much harder to know it about Mabel
Linker what feeling she had in her about any one around her. It was
always very hard to know this about her. Perhaps she did not mostly
have any very strong feeling in her. It was very hard to know it
about her. When she had a lover it was then certain that she was
crazy to have him marry her, she only lived in having him want her.
Mostly with every one else around her one never could tell what was
the feeling in her. They got along then very well as I was saying
when they first began living together.</p>

<p>Mabel then had become a good dress-maker, Mary had put together
money enough and they began then their working together. At first
things went pretty well and then they had some trouble living
together and they had not then enough money to go on waiting for a
future. They kept on however for some time living together.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing did not have in her really an unpleasant
nature, she did not really have in her a nagging temper. She had
very little in her of anxious being or attacking feeling that makes
unpleasant nature. She had in her very little nervous character,
she had in her a little impatient feeling, she had a pleasant
gayety in her. Her stupid being and her interfering never came from
anxious being in her, they were not really unpleasant nature in
her, they came from the little impatient being in her and the fact
that she had not a very large bottom in her to her, she had a
little sensitive bottom in her, a very little weakness as a bottom
to her, almost no stupid being as a bottom to her, she had enough
sensitiveness in her to make a pleasant sympathetic sweetness in
her, she had very little fighting or attacking in her; all the
unpleasant and stupid being in her was with the little impatient
feeling always in her, with the angry and injured feeling sometime
in her. This is a history of how she and Mabel Linker did and did
not get along together. Mabel had a very different nature.</p>

<p>There are many ways then that people have affection in them,
there are many ways of having feeling about people near one. Each
one then has their own way of having affectionate feeling in them.
Every one has their own kind of affectionate being. Mary
Maxworthing had her way of feeling about Mabel Linker, Mabel had
her own way of having loving feeling. In every one there is their
way of having in them affectionate feeling. In every one there is
changing. Mostly every one has changing in them in their feeling
about any one. Mostly every one never thinks about the changing the
other one may be having in them. This is another matter though and
now this is a history of the affectionate feeling and loving
feeling Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker had in them and how each
one affected the other one of them. As I was saying in the
beginning Mary had for Mabel almost an idolising feeling, no one
knew very much about Mabel Linker's feeling.</p>

<p>Mary had for Mabel then at first almost an idolising feeling.
Mabel had a quality of brilliant dressmaking, and sweetness in
enduring, and no certain expression of her feeling, and a certain
freedom in doing that looked like courage in her living but was
only that she never saw anything except the thing that then filled
her, she never had any reflection in her, she had a certain
shrinking fear sometimes in her but that was only when somebody
stopped her, she had a certain flighty freedom in her, she was
almost a brilliant dress-maker. She never had any ideas in her, she
had not much sense of fashion in her, she had not such sense in her
but that was not necessary for her, Mary Maxworthing would run her,
when she first lived with her Mary idolised her. As I was saying
the failure of the undertaking was to Mary Maxworthing a loss of
freedom, a loss of future distinction. Mabel had very little of
this feeling, she had not much more freedom working with Mary
Maxworthing than in any other kind of working, not that she did not
like it better, she liked it better but the failure did not make
all the difference to her. Later it went better because then she
had a husband to urge her. But this is all history that will be
written later. Always later although they stayed together it was
not as it had been earlier, it was not then an idolising of her by
Mary and a yielding by her because she had no way to resist her.
Freedom then in Mary Maxworthing was having her own choice in
living, having some distinction. Freedom for Mabel Linker was
loving one man and marrying him and working only under driving. She
was brilliant then in working but she needed urging, she needed
always some one else's starting. She had sensitive being in her to
the point of creation, she was not of the kind of women that have
instrument nature in them, she never did any one else's living, she
always did her own living, when she loved her own loving, when she
worked her own brilliant working, but always she needed other
people to keep her going, to start her, to arrange for her, to hold
her down when flightiness seized her; she always lived her own life
in living, she needed other people to start her, to give a
beginning idea to her, she needed other people to arrange for her,
to hold her when flightiness was in her. She had no fighting in
her, she had very little sense of escaping in her, she had some
stubborn being in her, when she seized a thing she needed in loving
or living nothing could pull it away from her. She needed very few
things so much that no one could take them from her, she had no
sense in her, generosity had no meaning to her she would give
anything to any one even when they did not ask her, she held on
only to the thing in living that was life to her, she had not any
strong feeling about anything except the man she needed for loving,
the man she married and who was everything to her, everything else
could slip away as it would from her. This made an ingrate of her,
she had no sense of any one ever doing anything for her for she had
no need in her, they did it she never felt anything about it in
her, that made trouble for her later, that made it later hard for
Mary Maxworthing to forgive her, this is a history of the trouble
it made for her. She had independent dependent nature in her but
the dependent side of it in her to the point of sometimes exquisite
creation was the whole of her. She had none of the independent side
of it in her, she had no attacking in her. Stupid being in her was
a negative thing in her, she had no sense for ordinary living in
her, she had no sense of anything that was happening to her, she
had not enough of anything in her beside the sensitive creation
that was her to make any sense in her, this was the stupid being in
her; that which was not in her was the stupid being of her, this
made in her a lack of understanding and of living, it made an
ingrate of her, it made very often a foolish person of her. Often
it not being there made her flightiness control her, those who were
not ever much interested really in her always said of her it was
foolishness, silliness always in her, those who took a real
interest in her said she had craziness in her. She had independent
dependent nature in her and the sensitive dependent side of it in
her to the point of exquisite creation was the whole of her. This
is now a history of her, of her loving, of her marrying, of her
dress-making, of her living with Mary Maxworthing.</p>

<p>When Mary came home from the doctor Mabel was told all that had
happened to her. Mabel did everything any one could have done for
her in all the trouble that then came to her. Mary Maxworthing had
not a despairing feeling with the baby in her as she had had at the
failure of her undertaking at dress-making. She had a little more
now of anxious being, she had none of despairing feeling, she had
very little anxious feeling, she had none of despairing feeling,
she had very little anxious feeling, mostly it was impatient
feeling that filled her and injured feeling that so much bad luck
should have come to her. A great deal of impatient feeling,
considerable injured feeling and a little anxious feeling was what
then mostly was in her. She had none of the despairing sense she
had had in her after her failure, this would not effect the future
for her, so much the worse for her that it had happened to her, she
liked children, so much the worse that it should have come so to
her, she still loved the man, he loved her, sometime perhaps he
would marry her. As it happened he did marry her, he married her
when she was thirty-five, when she was making her new beginning
with Mabel Linker at dress-making and was succeeding. He was a
decent enough man and always wanted to marry her, his family wanted
him to marry another girl who was richer, he had been away on
business travelling all the time she had the baby and later, when
he came back finally and could arrange it he married her. It was a
successful enough marriage for her. Living was always successful
enough for her.</p>

<p>But all this was much later now she is coming back from the
doctor with some impatient feeling, a little anxious feeling and
some injured feeling in her. Mabel Linker then did anything any one
could do for her, the people who employed her were much surprised
at such a thing happening to her, no one who knew ever would have
imagined such a thing would happen to her, but it did not change
their feeling for her, it did not change anybody's estimate of her.
It had happened to her. Everybody was good to her, everybody except
the doctor who had got angry with her. He was young then, he
thought she had deceit in her, this was not true of her, she was as
honest as most people are. I don't mean that she had any great
honesty in her. She did not but she had medium honesty in her. In
her interview with the doctor there was no deceit in her there was
only the stupidity of impatient being in her.</p>

<p>She was as honest as most people are in living, she was as
conscientious as most people are in beginning, to herself she was a
little more conscientious than she really was in being, she could
have in herself an injured being. She could feel that Mabel should
have in her toward her a grateful feeling, she could have in
herself an injured feeling, she was to herself more sacrificing,
more conscientious, a little perhaps, not much more honest to her
in her being than she really was in being or in living, she could
have then injured feeling. Mostly, in her, she had more impatient
being, more interfering, than she had angry or injured feeling. She
could have angry and injured feeling.</p>

<p>Mostly one has injured feeling when one is to one inside in
one's feeling more noble than one ever is in acting than one ever
is really in being, one has then inside one injured feeling. There
are many kinds of ways of having injured feeling in one. Sometime
there will be a history of all of the kinds of them.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is much sweetness inside one to one's feeling
and all the time nasty words are coming out from one, in many of
such of them there is much sweetness in them in their feeling, many
of such of them do not know that then mean or brutal things are
being said by them, so then they have rightly in them injured
feeling inside them when the others respond to the nasty things
said by them to them. This is a very common way of having injured
feeling in one, sometime there will be a history of all the kinds
of them. Mary Maxworthing then had impatient being, she never knew
that this really made her interfering, to herself it only made her
want to have every one do what they were doing. She had in her a
reasonably conscientious, honest being, to herself she had a little
more of them and of self-sacrificing being than she really had in
living. This could come to make in her injured and sometimes angry
feeling. Just the kind she had in her of conscientious and honest
being will come out more and more in the history of her as in her
living it comes out of her.</p>

<p>She came back then from the doctor and then Mabel Linker and
then her employer knew what had happened to her. Everybody then was
very good to her. No one then who knew her changed then in their
feeling about her, this had happened to her, she was always though
what every one always had thought her. The doctor had been angry
with her, but he was young and thought it deceit in her, it was
impatient being that was the stupid being in her.</p>

<p>Mabel Linker was working for her living, she had commenced again
having work to do in her room and in a small way had commenced
again a business of dress-making though often she had to go out
sewing. Mary Maxworthing, when she would have a bad feeling in her,
came to Mabel Linker to have her take care of her.</p>

<p>As I was saying too, no one knew it about her what kind of
feeling Mabel Linker had in her for Mary Maxworthing. Perhaps it
will come to be clearer later. Anyhow she then took care of her,
and it was not an easy matter. Mary had not even then anxious being
in her, she did have very much then impatient being in her, it was
very hard sometimes for any one to put up with her.</p>

<p>Every one has in them their own history inside them. In each one
the history comes out of them in the repeating that is always in
them. Mary Maxworthing had always in her some impatient being,
sometimes it had in her more and sometimes less importance in her
being, sometimes it had in her almost a different meaning from
other times in her living. Mostly it was in her her stupid being.
This came to be very strongly in her in the trouble she had in
having her baby. She did not have then in her really any anxious
being, she had then in her very much impatient being and feeling.
Finally she did not have a living baby, after six months it passed
out of her, it was her impatient being in her that made trouble for
her, this is a history of what happened to her.</p>

<p>Repeating then is always coming out of every one, from the kind
of being always in them. Almost always in the repeating in every
one and in its coming out of them there is a little changing. In
Mary Maxworthing it was always the same kind of impatient being,
sometimes it was in her, impatient feeling, sometimes it was,
interfering with every one around her and nagging and complaining,
mostly it was not complaining, sometimes it was impatient being and
stupid acting. Impatient being was almost always in her, stupid
acting, it was not always in her as impatient feeling. In her
trouble with having the baby come out of her this was mixed up in
her. Always there was then impatient being strongly in her, often
there was stupid acting in her from the impatient being always in
her, sometimes there was impatient feeling in her. This is now a
history of these things in her. As I was saying she always had in
her, impatient being. As I was saying impatient being was the
stupid being in her. It was not always active in her, it was at
this time often enough active in her. She did not have in her so
very much impatient feeling inside her. At this time with this
trouble in her, impatient being was more than usually active in
her, it came out in stupid ways of doing and not doing, she had
sometimes, for her, a good deal of impatient feeling inside her.
Mostly in her, impatient being was not impatient feeling in her.
This is now a history of what all this did in her. As I was saying
Mabel Linker took care of her. It was not an easy matter. Mary went
to Mabel every time she felt badly inside her. She never would go
to a doctor. This was the impatient being in her, this was the
impatient being in her that was the stupid being in her, this will
be clearer later. Mabel Linker took care of her and it was not an
easy matter. She would not go to see a doctor. Finally at six
months the baby passed out of her. She almost died when this
happened to her. Mabel Linker had sent then for a doctor. It came
very nearly being too late then to save her. This did not scare her
until it was all over. She did not really know what was happening
to her. She did not like it when she heard it later, she had no
desire for dying in her. All that happened to her was from the
impatient being in her. Impatient being was the stupid being in
her. Every one has in them their own kind of stupid being, every
one has in them a stupid part in them, this is a history of stupid
being in Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker. This is a history of
what happened to each of them, of every thing that was in them, of
the kind of stupid being in each one of them.</p>

<p>As I was saying, at the beginning of their living together, at
the beginning of their dress-making Mary had for Mabel almost an
idolising feeling. No one ever thought about the feeling Mabel
Linker had about Mary Maxworthing. That was not important to any
one. Later every one who knew them came to think about it but this
was in their later living; in the beginning of their living
together, in the beginning of their dress-making undertaking, the
feeling Mabel Linker had about Mary Maxworthing was not important
to any one, no one knew whether she had little or much feeling,
this was not important then to any one, not even to Mary
Maxworthing. This was because of the nature Mabel Linker had in
her. Feeling in Mabel Linker for any one was something no one ever
stopped to consider, it was enough that Mary Maxworthing liked
living with her, it was enough for any one who knew her to know
that when Mary needed her Mabel took good care of her. Later,
feeling in Mabel became more important to those that knew her.
Later there was a question in the mind of every one who knew her
what kind of feeling she had in her. Later every one came to feel
about her that mostly she had not any feeling in her. Mary
Maxworthing later felt this in her. Later every one who knew her
accepted this in her. Some were never very certain about her. She
was different then from Mary Maxworthing, she was a very different
nature. Every one had the same notion of Mary whether they liked or
whether they did not like her, she could surprise them by something
happening to her but every one had and always kept about the same
estimate of her. This is now more history of her. There are
millions always being made of every kind of men and women. Some
kinds of them have it in them to have a being that makes every one
who knows one of such of them think that one a singular one but
always there are many millions of such of them, as many millions of
such of them as of them who have it in them to have every one who
sees them think there are always many existing of their kind of
them. More and more in living one finds this to be true of people
around them. This is now a history of every kind of them of every
kind of men and every kind of women who ever were or are or will be
living, of every kind of beginning of them as they are babies and
children, and now this is a history of these two of them, Mabel
Linker and Mary Maxworthing.</p>

<p>There is always then repeating, always everything is repeating,
this is a history of every kind of repeating there is in living,
this is then a history of every kind of living. There is always
then in every one, repeating, there are always being made then
millions of every kind of being, there are always then living
millions of every kind of men and women, there are and were and
will be always existing millions of each kind of them, and the
kinds of them from the beginning, and in every nation, are always
the same and this is now a history of some of them. There are
always then the same kinds of them and millions of them, millions
of each kind there are of men and women always existing. Each one
of all of them have in them their individual existing, their own
history in them, their own living in them, and this is now a
writing of the history as it comes out of some of them. There is
then always repeating, there is then always individual existing.
There is then always repeating, there is then always repeating in
each one, in each kind of them, in pairs of them, in pairs of
women, in pairs of men, in pairs of men and women. Always more and
more in living it comes out how kinds of them in pairing are always
repeating, this is true in loving, in friendly being between men
and women. Sometimes in living one sees so many repeating, so many
who seem when one knows them to be so individual there can never be
any one anything like them, a pair of them with so individual a
relation made up of two who are so singular in their being that it
never seems that there can be others just like them. Always then
one sees another pair of them and sometimes it is almost dizzying,
it gives to each one of the pairs of them an unreal being, and then
it comes again that one understands then that repeating is the
whole of living. Repeating is the whole of living and by repeating
comes understanding, and understanding is to some the most
important part of living. Repeating is the whole of living, and it
makes of living a thing always more familiar to each one and so we
have old men's and women's wisdom, and repeating, simple repeating
is the whole of them.</p>

<p>As I was saying pairing of friends and pairing in loving is
always a repeating of the coming together of the kinds of them and
this is not just general repeating but very detailed repeating,
wonderfully alike the pairs are then in character and looks and
loving and living.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker were not
altogether successful friends in their living. Later they both were
married and then things went a little better for them, also they
were succeeding then in their business of dress-making. This was
when Mrs. Hersland knew them, when they were again living and
dress-making in that part of Gossols where rich people were living.
As I was saying Mary Maxworthing when she was having the baby
taken, did not know how near she was to dying. All of it came from
the impatient being which was her kind of stupid being. She did not
know when the baby was passing how near she was to dying,
afterwards she had about it almost an anxious feeling.</p>

<p>As I was saying it was hard on Mabel Linker then to take care of
her. Not when the baby was passing out of her for then she had a
doctor and was in a hospital with a nurse taking care of her, but
before, when she would not see a doctor. She would not let a doctor
see her, this was impatient being in her, she would not listen to
Mabel Linker or to any one else who tried to advise her, she was
full up with impatient feeling. Yes, of course sometimes she was
bleeding, but she did not want to pay any attention; she was full
up then with impatient feeling. Later after it was over and she
knew how near she had been to dying she had for a little while less
impatient feeling, she had then in her, some anxious feeling. This
was the end of that thing for her. She stayed then a year or two
longer with the same employer. During this time Mary Maxworthing
and Mabel Linker saw very little of each other. They had had
serious troubles with each other.</p>

<p>As I was saying when Mary Maxworthing first had Mabel Linker
live with her she had for her almost an idolising feeling. As I was
saying men and women, women and women, men and men do so much
repeating, it is almost startling as more and more one comes to
know it of them. The repeating is not only of the general kind of
combining as to their being men and women, as to their being big
and little, alike or contrasting, independent dependent and
dependent independent, it is likeness of the type of character
combining with another and these two are very individual in their
being and their relation and sometimes they have in them a kind of
being that makes every one who knows them think there can never
have been any one like one or the other of them, surely never any
two like the pair of them and then one goes on in one's living and
then there is repeating of the pair and then another repeating of
them and then another repeating of them and always one has about
each pair of them the strong feeling of their having each one of
them strongly individual being and sometimes it makes of everything
a strange world for living and sometimes it makes to one's feeling
the world a pleasant and familiar place for living. Strangeness has
no place then in living, to one's feeling, it is a familiar thing,
living, and to some, such a feeling is the pleasantest kind of
feeling they can have in their living.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing then is very clear now in her being. She is
very clear now to every one. There are many millions always living
with her kind of being. There are in every country in every kind of
living, they exist with every kind of training. Sometime there will
be a history of five of them, sometime there will be a history of
all of them. Now this is a history of one of them. Mary Maxworthing
was what every one who knew her, whether they liked her or did not
like her, thought her. She had not any recklessness or wildness in
her. She had very little weakness in her. She had independent
dependent nature in her but she had very little fighting in her,
what seemed like fighting was mostly impatient being in her, she
had very little attacking in her. She had a certain gayety in her,
she had not good nature really in her, she had no heartlessness in
her, she had enough sensitive being to make a pleasant sympathetic
sweetness in her, that with the little gayety in her gave to her
the charm she had in her. The very little attacking, the gayety in
her, the impatient being in her, the certain practical feeling for
fashion and for being a success, that was in her, gave to her her
desire for freedom and a little distinction in the future. She had
no sordidness in her, she had not much memory in her. More and more
she will be clearer, in the history of her relation to Mabel
Linker, in her relation to the man who later married her, in the
way she came to the undertaking again of the business of
dress-making.</p>

<p>As I was saying, during the trouble she had in her Mabel Linker
took care of her. Later they had serious trouble with each other.
Finally later when Mabel had a husband to urge her and Mary
Maxworthing had a little money left to her they began again to be
together, they more or less stuck together though they never really
got along together. They had a reasonable success together. This is
now a history of Mabel Linker and the nature in her.</p>

<p>Mabel Linker had a different nature. She had her own being in
her. Every one has their own being in them. Every one has their own
repeating in them. Every one is of a kind of men and women. Every
kind of men and women is a kind of a kind of them. All the kinds of
them are kinds of the two kinds of them. Sometime there will be a
history of all of them.</p>

<p>There are then the two kinds of them, independent dependent and
dependent independent. Mary Maxworthing was of the independent
dependent, Mabel Linker was of the same kind of them but as one
might say of extreme one end of that kind of them, while Mary
Maxworthing was of toward the other end of them. This difference
made an attraction between them, their being of the same kind of
them made it that in the end they did not succeed in continuing
friendly living. It is very interesting to know the range in one
kind of men and women. This is now a little about one kind of them
with Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker both of them of that one
kind of them but at the two ends of that kind of them.</p>

<p>Men have in them and women have in them, some of them,
independent dependent nature in them. Many millions of men and many
millions of women are always being made of this kind, always about
half of everybody living is of this kind of men and women. This is
now a description of one part of them which makes one kind of this
kind of men and women. This is a description of that part of them,
that kind of them as women; later there will be a description of
them as men. Always it is easier to know it in them, the details of
a kind of them, in women, later this will be clearer in them. Now
this is a history of the kind of them who have of them Mabel Linker
and Mary Maxworthing. As I was saying the two of them had
difficulties, later in their living, had difficulty in remaining
friends, in beginning again with dress-making. As I was saying they
had both in them the same kind of being, that is to say one was one
extreme kind of such being, the other was almost the other extreme
kind of such being and now there is a description of them in the
kind of being there is in them, later there is a history of their
living as it came out of them, always there is a description of
their character as in repeating it comes out of each one of them.
So then.</p>

<p>There are as I was saying the two kinds of being in women and in
men, independent dependent, dependent independent. The first of
these have attacking as their natural way of fighting, resisting in
such of them is sometimes impatient or dull or scared or stubborn
or pig-headed stupid or vacant being, is sometimes a continuing of
attacking; resisting to the dependent independent is the natural
way of fighting. Those then who have in them independent dependent
being as the bottom of them have attacking in them as their natural
way of fighting. Many of them have very little fighting in their
living. This was true of both of these two who had independent
dependent nature in them, Mabel Linker and Mary Maxworthing.</p>

<p>Those who have independent dependent nature in them may have
practical and sordid nature in them but mostly they have not much
earthy simple natural sense in them. This will be clearer as more
of them come to be seen in the history there will be of such of
them. As I was saying Mabel Linker and Mary Maxworthing had both of
them independent dependent nature in them.</p>

<p>Mabel Linker had not an instrument nature in her, the
sensitiveness in her made a kind of real creation in her, made her
live her own living, do her own loving. To many there may be a
confusion between the sensitive instrument nature that lives so
strongly the lives of others that they seem to be their own
creation and one like Mabel Linker. To any one that knows them
well, sooner or later this comes to be clearer.</p>

<p>As I was saying then the instrument nature is one having
sensitive being or power of idealising or power for seizing without
knowing it other people's suggestion. If the seizing is their own
volition that makes another being, that is not living other
people's lives in living. So then there is a kind of men and women
who have in them independent dependent nature in them and this is
now to be a description of many variations in them and Mary
Maxworthing and Mabel Linker, both of them, are of this part of the
general independent dependent kind of men and women.</p>

<p>Sooner or later there will be histories of many men and women
with independent dependent nature in them. As I was saying there is
to be Martha Hersland and Julia Dehning, there is to be a sister of
one governess, and one governess with such a nature. Now there are
Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker.</p>

<p>Perhaps, always it will become clearer, the independent
dependent nature and later every one will see it in each one who
have in them some form of such nature. Later dependent independent
nature will be clearer and every one who sees any one will know it
sooner or later in that one their kind of nature and the kind of
the kind of nature they have in them and that in repeating comes
out of them. Now then to begin again with independent dependent
being, now to begin with Mabel Linker and Mary Maxworthing.</p>

<p>To begin again then with the instrument nature, with attacking
being, with sensitive being, with weakness or vacant being, with
little, with much bottom being, with little or much attacking in
living, with unified or with separated natures inside each one, as
in living it comes out of each one. There are then many men and
many women, more or less half of all that ever were or are or will
be living, who have independent dependent nature in them. I will
tell about it now in women because it comes easier to tell about it
in them; more and more, then, I will tell about it in men. It is
the same in men as in women but it separates a little clearer in
women and so it will make a kind of diagram for a beginning. As I
was saying I like to tell in the beginning, I like better to tell
it about women the nature in them because it is clearer and I know
it better, a little not very much better. One can see it in her
sooner, a little, not very much sooner, but on the whole it is
clearer, things are more separate generally in her, perhaps it is a
little clearer in her, perhaps I know it a little better in her. As
I was saying then, every one has in them their own way of being and
this comes out of them in the repeating that is always in every
one, in some it does not come to be very clear in them until their
middle living, in some not until their later living, but sometime
in every one the nature in them comes to be clear to any one who
looks well at them, sometimes in their younger living, sometimes in
their middle living, sometimes in their later living. As I was
saying every one has in them their own way of eating, their own way
of drinking, their own way of sleeping, their own way of resting,
of loving, of talking, or keeping still, of waking, their own way
of working, of having stupid being in them and coming out of them,
their own way of having nasty feeling in them and coming out of
them, in short then, every one has in them their own being and in
repeating it is all through their living always coming out of
them.</p>

<p>As I was saying more or less half of all who ever were or are or
will be living have independent dependent nature in them, that is
to say attacking is their natural way of fighting, resisting is
stubbornness and in many of them the stupid being in them, many of
them have as a bottom to them sensitive or weak or stupid being,
some have attacking that is fighting as almost the whole of them.
As I was saying this is all clearer in the women, as they have less
in them a unification of these things in them, they have simpler
reaction in them. Everybody knows this now in women and now this is
a history of all of them.</p>

<p>As I was saying then there are a kind of men and women who have
in them independent dependent being and some of these have
instrument nature, others are of the kind of Mary Maxworthing,
others of the kind of Mabel Linker. There are many kinds of them
who have independent dependent nature in them and there are many
kinds connected with these kinds of them and their history will
come later; Martha Hersland and Julia Dehning and Mr. Hersland and
many others who came to know the Hersland children in some part of
their living were connected then were of such a kind of nature. It
is clear then, independent dependent being is being when the
natural way of fighting is attacking, dependent independent being
is when the natural way of fighting is resisting. There are some
who have independent dependent nature in them and have no
attacking, no fighting being in them, Mabel Linker was such a one;
there are some who have in them very little fighting in their
living but all fighting in them is attacking and this is true of
Mary Maxworthing.</p>

<p>There are then some who have in them sensitive being to the
point of creating even to the point of fighting, there are some who
have this in them; there are some who have in them sensitive being
and this makes them live other people's lives in living, these may
have fighting from attacking being in them, these may have fighting
in them from the sensitive being in them that makes them live other
people's lives all through their living. Later there will be
written the history of such a one. These have instrument nature in
them, they need other people's lives for life enhancing. Later
there will be more history of such of them. There are some who have
instrument nature in them without the sensitive bottom to them,
with stupid or vacant or weak or vague bottom to them and an
idealising sense in them and a stupid stubborn way of resisting to
everything except the one thing they have made their living and
this is always in such of them some one else's thinking, feeling or
being. There are many millions always of such of them, sometime
perhaps in Julia this will be interesting. So then there are many
ways of having instrument nature in one. The dependent independents
have it also in them, some of them, but with them, such of them as
have it in them, it shows in different fashion from the independent
dependent kind of them, such ones have earthy being, they have fear
in them, that makes their way of being in them; later in the living
of Mrs. Hersland and Madeleine Wyman and Alfred Hersland and young
David Hersland dependent independent being will come to be clearer.
Now then there is only independent dependent being we are
considering. Later there will be more written of instrument being
of this kind of them. Neither Mary Maxworthing nor Mabel Linker had
this nature in them. So then to go on with them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mary Maxworthing had gayety in living. She had
very little fighting in her living but fighting in her was as
attacking. She had very little fear in her. She had very little
bottom to her, she had a little sensitive bottom to her enough to
give a pleasant sweetness to her. She had a little weakness in her
enough to make her a little yielding to attacking. She had very
little stupid bottom in her, most of the stupid being in her was of
the impatient being always in her. This was the disagreeable part
in her, the little attacking in her was not enough in her to be an
unpleasant being in her, injured and angry feeling in her was part
of such attacking living as she had in her but these were not much
in her. They were sometimes in her; they were in her when she had
the baby, that such bad luck should come to her. They were in her
about Mabel Linker, when to her thinking Mabel was ungrateful
toward her. This is now a history of Mabel Linker, and of her and
Mary Maxworthing living together and their having trouble with one
another and of Mabel's loving and then their beginning again
dress-making together.</p>

<p>Mabel Linker had a very different nature from the other. She had
no impatient being in her, she had sensitive being in her to the
point of creation. She had in her independent dependent nature. She
had no attacking in her. This is now a history of her.</p>

<p>Every one has in them always their own repeating, always more
and more then repeating gives to every one who feels it in them a
more certain feeling about them, a more secure feeling in living.
Repeating is more and more in every one the whole of that one the
whole of every one, the wonder of each one is always more and more
complete in each one as the repeating in them makes them a sure
thing a thing certainly having being, makes for every one old men's
and old women's wisdom, old men's loving and old women's feeling.
Always more and more then repeating is the certain thing in every
one. Always more and more then there is contentment in the secure
feeling repeating in every one gives to every one. Always then
there is excitement for every one in the certainty of repeating in
every one. Always the wonder of each one as repeating in them makes
a certain whole of them, comes to be a contentment to any one who
sees them. Always then repeating is in every one and every one is a
whole then and there is a secure feeling in resting in this
realisation sometime one can have of every one. Repeating then is
always in every one, sometime then there will be a description of
all repeating and then there will be contentment in contemplation.
Anyhow repeating is always in every one. Anyhow repeating is always
in the pairing of two of them. This is now a history of two of
them. As I was saying Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker both of
them were of the kind of them having in them independent dependent
being. Mostly for successful living two living together, man and
woman or two women or two men, there should be in them the two
kinds of them, one independent dependent the other dependent
independent, one with attacking as the natural way of fighting, the
other resisting as the way of being; but in loving and in friendly
living this is mixed up in different ways to make a pair of friends
for reasonably successful living. For loving to marrying to
successful married living, there is always this combination, the
independent dependent in one and in the other the dependent
independent being. For loving then there is almost always this
combination, in long successful friendly living there may be
another mixing, a pairing of the same kinds of them. This will now
be a description of some ways this is true in men and women, with
every kind of nature in them.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker had then both of them
independent dependent nature in them. Slowly it came out in them.
Slowly they had trouble with each other. Later they began again
together but that was then a business matter. Mabel had then her
husband to urge her. Mabel's marrying made at first great trouble
between her and Mary Maxworthing.</p>

<p>As I was saying, until Mabel Linker was full up with loving for
the man who later married her no one ever had known what feeling
she had in her about any one near her, about anything that happened
to her. Perhaps nothing was important to her until loving filled
her. Anyway no one ever knew what she had as feeling in her. She
had as I was saying almost brilliant quality as a dress-maker. She
had not much sense of fashion in her. She needed some one to urge
her and start her. When a thing was suggested to her and she was
pushed to begin she was almost a brilliant dress-maker. As I was
saying no one knew very much what feeling she had in her. People
who knew her had very different opinions of her. When Mary
Maxworthing first knew her, first had her living with her, she
almost idolised her. This feeling lasted in Mary through the
beginning of their undertaking of dress-making. It died down in her
when she had her trouble in her, her impatient feeling when they
were not succeeding, her despairing feeling at the failure of her
undertaking, her impatient troubled nervous feeling when she had
her baby in her, her anxious feeling when she knew what had almost
happened to her that her baby was dead and that she had almost died
with her. And then Mabel Linker had her lover, Mary found
ingratitude then in her, things got so that they could no longer
live together. Then Mabel got married and much later when Mary had
a little money left to her from some relative down in the country
and Mabel had her husband to urge her, they began with their
undertaking in that part of Gossols where richer people were
living. Now they were more successful and things were different
between them. Mary had now mostly the business managing and the
excuses and the matching and the buying to do for the two of them
and Mabel did the dress-making and she had in her with her
husband's urging enough decision so Mary was stopped from doing too
much interfering. They always did a fair amount of quarrelling but
on the whole this time they succeeded fairly well with their
undertaking. Then Mary married the man as I was saying, he had
always wanted her to marry him and now his family would let him.
His mother had not any longer any objection. Mary Maxworthing was
succeeding well enough with dress-making, besides she saw that he
would do it and it was not any longer any use objecting and
resisting. This was about the time when Mrs. Hersland had them to
make for her all her best dresses, all those she used for
visiting.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mary Maxworthing when she had her baby in her
had not then in her any despairing feeling but she had in her a
troubled impatient nervous being. As I was saying, in their first
living together she had for Mabel Linker almost an idolising
feeling. She would write when she sat idling, "angel Mabel, Mabel
is an angel," and this showed her feeling. She never thought
anything about Mabel's feeling. Mabel was everything she wanted and
that was enough for her feeling, besides it was almost impossible
to know what Mabel had inside her. As I was saying Mary Maxworthing
had gayety but never any wildness or recklessness in living. She
had gayety in living, she had in her very little anxious being, she
had in her always impatient being, she had some sensitive bottom
enough to give with her gayety some attractive sweetness to her.
Her gayety and her impatient being and what there was in her of
attraction gave her some quality of domination, not so much as
there was in her impatient being and interfering. She was then a
pleasant enough person all through her living, she was a pleasant
enough person with some quality of attraction. She was reasonably
honest and conscientious in her living. In the beginning then she
had for Mabel Linker an idolising feeling. When she was sitting
idling she would often be writing, "Mabel is an angel, angel
Mabel." She had for her this feeling, all through the beginning of
their first undertaking. Then they had trouble living together,
Mary was very interfering, she had a sense for fashion and she had
given all the money they had for their beginning and Mabel never
had in her any impatient being and she could endure a good deal of
directing, but when they were not succeeding they began to have
trouble between them. Not that Mabel said much or did much to show
any changing in feeling but Mary felt that Mabel had not enough
grateful feeling. Mabel never did have grateful feeling, after all
she did the dress-making, after all she never thought much about
Mary and her feeling, after all she was always willing, after all
she never really heard very much of what Mary was always
saying.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing had a certain gayety in living, she had
ambition, she had impatient feeling. She had a certain power of
domination, but not as much as she had impatient feeling which made
her interfering and in a certain degree nagging. She had just
enough domination to keep her from being too irritating.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing never had in her any grateful feeling to Mabel
Linker for taking care of her, for doing all any one could do for
her, while she was having her trouble with a baby. Mary was not
like Mabel, she knew people should be grateful, she could have
injured feeling in her. It was a little queer that she never felt
that Mabel Linker had been good to her, that she should have any
grateful feeling toward her; perhaps it was because then she had so
much impatient being in her and impatient being was the stupid
being of her, perhaps it was because Mabel Linker had never any
feeling in her of doing anything for her. Mary told her to do
something and Mabel did it for her, there was no anxious feeling in
Mabel Linker ever; there was never any tenderness in her, Mary
Maxworthing then had never any grateful feeling to her in her.</p>

<p>The idolising feeling in Mary Maxworthing for Mabel Linker did
not change into something else in her. It just died out of her.
Later when Mabel had gone away from her and was married Mary wanted
to begin again with her but always again, when she got used to her,
she had no strong feeling about her, she never had for her at any
time, later, an idolising feeling, but she always wanted her more
than Mabel wanted her. But Mabel really only needed the man who
married her, Mabel never wanted anything else to come to her. Later
with her husband to urge her she got to have more feeling for a
future, she wanted then for him and for herself too then success in
dress-making. She and Mary came together then. Mary had some money
then and they began again in that part of Gossols where rich people
were living.</p>

<p>Mary Maxworthing had then, when she had the baby in her, nervous
impatient being, she had no feeling in her about Mabel Linker or
any other person near her, the idolising feeling she had had for
Mabel died out of her when freedom and distinction did not come to
her, not that she had liked Mabel because Mabel could possibly help
her to a future, not at all, but when Mabel was always with her,
when Mary was not stirred up with planning for the future, when
gayety was a little dead in her, when impatient feeling was in her,
she had not any stimulation to have idolising feeling for Mabel
Linker. Mary Maxworthing then had for Mabel, as for every one
around her then, no feeling, she was full up with impatient being.
Later then, when the baby was still-born and Mary knew she had been
very near to dying, she had in her then anxious impatient, a little
of nervous being, Mabel then had for her very little meaning, then
later when Mary began to be herself again inside her Mabel had
begun loving and Mary was disapproving. So there was never again a
beginning in Mary of idolising feeling. Mary Maxworthing and Mabel
Linker were not altogether successful friends in their living.
Later they both were married and then things went a little better
between them. Mabel Linker had a husband then to make her important
and to urge her inside her. Mary Maxworthing did not have a husband
until some time after Mabel had one, until after she had begun
again with Mabel the undertaking of dress-making.</p>

<p>Every one has then in them their own way of having injured
feeling, Mabel Linker had never in her much of this inside her.
Later with a husband to urge her to be inside her her important
being, she could have such a feeling. Luckily then Mary Maxworthing
had not yet her husband and so they got along together.</p>

<p>As I was saying when Mary Maxworthing was having her despairing
feeling she lost all feeling about Mabel Linker. Mary Maxworthing
had this in her, many women are like her, many men have this too in
them, they have in them negative egotism in them. Later there will
be histories of many of such of them.</p>

<p>Mary was not a complete one of such a kind of them. This is the
kind they are then. Mabel Linker was not at all such a kind of one.
This is now a description of them.</p>

<p>Many women then are always of them, many men have it in them,
mostly it is a kind of them that are made more as women perhaps
than as men. Every one then has their own way of having injured
feeling in them. As I was saying many have it in them when they
have more self-sacrificing, more noble being in them than ever
comes out of them in living, when they have a noble sweetness in
them to them and they are unpleasant or lazy even in living. Many
of them who have negative egotism in them have lazy being as the
bottom of them, lazy or vague or empty bottom to them. Some of them
are dependent independent, some are independent dependent, all of
them mostly have lazy or vague or empty or very little bottom to
them. Some have much bottom in them and never get it into motion.
Negative egotism then is when one has enough egotism never to
follow any other leading, never to live anybody else's life in
living, always to have the best reason why every condition in
living is the wrong place for them and not to have enough egotism
to live their own life, to do their own choosing, to really be
resisting. These then never have any real choice in them, they have
not resisting in them, they have very good reasons why there is no
place for them, why conditions are always wrong to them. Often it
takes years to know them, they are mostly nice women with tender
hearts and pleasant natures in them, they are many of them so
stirring in their living that it is hard to know it of them that
they have lazy being as a bottom to them, they worry so much inside
them that it is hard to believe it of them that they have not it in
them to be active in taking trouble enough to be really living,
they are very many then of all of such of them, they have such very
good reasons for not finding any place for living, it takes a long
time when one is living with any one of them not to be taken in by
the good reasons they have for not choosing. Even when one knows
them well their reasons are convincing, there is such good reason
always in them and they are mostly pleasant people with tender
hearts or active worrying in them and lazy being in them. Laziness
is in many of them not easy to know of them. Many of them seem
actively in motion many of such of them who have really lazy being
in them. There are then many many millions always being made of
women and of men who have negative egotism in them. Some then are
always existing who come nearer real egotism, these have not enough
egotism for choosing, for living, some by attacking some by
resisting make for themselves a protection, they do not do their
own living but they keep other people off of them or clog them.
There are many ways then of being in all these ways of egotism,
sometime then there will be a history of all of them, a history of
all of them, a history of every one, of every man and every woman
who ever were or are or will be living, who have ever in them
egotism, active, passive or negative.</p>

<p>Alright then, there is a negative egotism in many men and in
women, in very many of them. Sometime then there will be a history
of every kind of them.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one mostly has sometime in them some
injured feeling. Mabel Linker almost never had any of it in her.
Mary Maxworthing could have it sometimes in her. Mabel Linker had
not in her any of the thing we have been just describing. She had
in her individual being, she had in her sensitive being to the
point of creating. She lived her own life in living. Mostly she was
not doing much living, that is she needed urging to be working, she
had flightiness in being, in loving she had her complete being,
then she did real creating, she was alive then to her own feeling.
Mary Maxworthing was more nearly of them who have in them negative
egotism. She had a little gayety in living, she had a little
sensitive bottom, but when she had impatient being as filling she
had almost negative egotism. When she had impatient being then, she
had not in her any sense of living, then all feeling for any one
died out of her. Impatient being was not nervous being in her, it
was not a bottom to her, it was sometimes the whole of her, it was
stupid being in her. Mabel Linker had a very different nature.</p>

<p>As I was saying when Mary Maxworthing was looking to a future
with freedom and a dressmaking undertaking and a little
distinction, she had in her a sense of herself to herself inside
her, she had in her a sense of living in her, she had something of
individual being in her. She had then for Mabel Linker almost an
idolising feeling, this was important feeling in her. When she had
despairing being in her she had only stupid being in her, she had
not negative egotism then in her, she was just going on living
because life was in her. All that then was in her was the impatient
being that was in her stupid being and despairing feeling, not
really despairing feeling, but dull being in her. Later when she
had a very little anxious being in her and a good deal of impatient
being in her, when Mabel Linker was taking care of her, she was
nearer to negative egotism, she had excellent reasons for all
injured feeling in her, she had excellent reason why everyone
should take care of her, she had excellent reason for it to be
right to her that Mabel Linker should take care of her, all she had
done for her and all the trouble she herself now had in her, and so
it was right that she should have Mabel Linker take care of her,
and that was the end of that matter to her. Mabel Linker had no
injured feeling in her, Mabel never had in her any sense of any one
doing any thing for her, mostly Mabel did what came to her, she did
well anything she started to do because it came to her, she did
brilliant dressmaking, it came natural to her, in loving she had
her own living inside her. Later she had her husband to urge her,
that gave to her a little more, always in her, a sense of herself
to herself inside her. Mary Maxworthing then had good reason not to
have toward Mabel Linker any grateful feeling. Mabel took care of
her. She had come near dying, now she was through with that
trouble, slowly impatient being came to be more nearly a reasonably
small part of her, and this was now to her an end of that
matter.</p>

<p>This was then the end in her of anxious nervous being, she went
back then to her old work and was not hoping and she had then
negative egotism as the way of living, she had a kind of negative
optimism as a way of thinking. It was then that Mabel Linker began
loving, it was then that she and Mary Maxworthing almost came to
the end of friendly relation. This is now the history of the two of
them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mary Maxworthing then had for a little time no
hope for future freedom, she had just then no prospect for
marrying, she was commencing to have again a little gayety in
living, she had in her then still impatient being. Mabel Linker had
commenced to have work enough at home to keep going. Mary just then
had no hope of commencing dressmaking with her again. Mabel was
flighty then and had no sense in managing. Mary was not taking much
interest in what Mabel was doing, she had in her some impatient
feeling, she had in her then very little important being of herself
inside her to her feeling. She had in her then not much real
living, she had in her then negative egotism.</p>

<p>It was alright for Mary Maxworthing to have the feeling she had
in her about Mabel Linker. She had good reasons then for the
feeling in her. It was the end of interest for her, it was the end
of freedom for her, Mabel had no meaning for her when she had no
connection with her, this came to her when she had her baby in her
from the trouble in her that left her no feeling for any other
because she had no live being in her; later when Mabel was full up
with love for the man who later married her there was nothing of
her for Mary to feel in her, there had never been anything there
really, for her, but when there was nothing else in Mabel Linker it
had not made any difference to any one who knew her. Mary
Maxworthing had then good reason for the feeling she had in her
about Mabel Linker, Mary had had almost an idolising feeling about
Mabel when they first lived together when they began their
undertaking of dress-making together, when she would sit idling,
waiting, dreaming, she would be writing, "Mabel is an angel, angel
Mabel," this showed the feeling she had then in her about her. Then
came the time when she was no longer hoping for the future, then
there was some bitterness in her, then she felt Mabel should have
more grateful feeling in her than she showed toward her, then came
the despairing being in her and then the thing happened to her that
surprised every one who knew her when her weakness and desire were
more active in her because gayety and impatient being and ambition
were then dead in her. Then she had not feeling about any one
around her. Then there came to be in her, troubled impatient
feeling, and Mabel took care of her. Mary was then full up with
impatient being and Mabel took care of her like any other, neither
the one nor the other then felt anything about the other. Then when
that was over Mary knew how near she had come to be dying, then she
had a little anxious impatient irritable being in her and then she
and Mabel still lived together and then they quarreled more and
more with each other for Mabel was beginning then with her lover
and so she had then the beginning of wanting to escape, a little,
in her. Then Mary was beginning to have her former being, she had
begun again taking care of children. Mabel then was beginning to
succeed well enough with dress-making to work at home and keep
going. She was flighty then and uncertain in her working and Mary
was always scolding, not for her own sake for there was nothing in
it for her, but for Mabel's sake so Mabel could get along and not
have people leave her disgusted with her. Mabel was very flighty
then with no one to hold her, she was getting then fuller and
fuller of love for the man who later married her. Mary did not want
this marriage for her, he was a young fellow, Mabel's lover,
younger than she was and a poor money getter. Mary did not then
have for Mabel any idolising feeling, she did not take much
interest in her, she always scolded her, she had in her an injured
feeling because Mabel had no gratitude in her, no feeling for any
one around her. This was true enough about her, Mary always had
good reasons for the feelings in her, it was true enough Mabel was
flighty and had no gratitude in her and had no feeling for any one
ever excepting the man who later married her. And so they did not
get along at all together, Mabel always had more and more escaping
in her, she had not come yet to have any feeling of herself inside
her, this came to her later with a husband to urge her to make her
herself inside her, but she had more and more of escaping being in
her, she was always getting more and more full of loving and she
never had had in her any feeling for any one around her. Before, it
had not been important to any one the feeling in her for then there
was not in her, loving or escaping to make any one feel any lack in
her. Now it was different and Mary Maxworthing had good reason for
the feeling she had in her about her. Mabel was working then but
flightiness was strongly in her and people who employed her often
were disgusted with her. They did not leave her for as I was saying
Mabel was almost brilliant in dress-making. Mary had no patience
then with her, she had injured feeling in her for she was then not
of any importance to Mabel Linker. She had injured and sometimes
angry feeling in her then about her. It was alright for her to have
then such a feeling about Mabel Linker, Mabel had flightiness then
in her, Mabel had escaping then in her, Mabel was full up with love
for a man who was younger and would never earn a living for her.
Mabel Linker had then her own living in her. She was full up with
love for the man who later married her.</p>

<p>Things then were always getting more and more unpleasant between
them. Mary Maxworthing had injured feeling in her, she had
impatient being then in her, she was always scolding, she wanted
Mabel not to have such flightiness in her, she wanted to keep her
from marrying. Mabel then had escaping being in her and she would
then sometimes answer and it was then a continued biting chatter
whenever they were together and they were always together, they
could not keep away from one another. Finally things got so bitter
between them that Mary would have nothing further to do with her.
Mabel could marry and then when sickness and trouble would come to
her she would know better. Mary Maxworthing would have nothing more
to do with her or with her pauper lover. Mary had a hard feeling
then in her about her, she had then impatient being and injured
being and angry feeling that together were in her as a hard sense
of knowing that bad things would come to Mabel Linker to punish
her. Mabel did not pay much attention then to her, she was having a
little trouble then with the mother of her lover. The mother wanted
her to take another flat to live in and Mabel had no money to pay
for anything and she did not want to say it to her going to be
husband's family. Mary Maxworthing had then always more and more of
angry feeling in her about Mabel Linker. She told her then to get
another machine to sew on, that one was hers and she needed it now
for herself and Mabel could go to her lover's family and get them
to give one to her, she thought they were such nice people, let
them show her. Then Mabel's lover's mother made Mabel promise not
to invite Mary Maxworthing to their wedding and that was for some
time the end of any relation between them. Mabel Linker then was
married and she and her husband had a happy enough existence. The
husband's family had to help them and then his mother died and then
when Mabel met Mary they began to say "how do you do," again to one
another. Mabel with her husband, who was a nice bright man, to urge
her, got on a little better. More and more then she felt herself
inside her. She was beginning to have work enough to occupy her.
She had even a girl to help her. Later she and Mary got to be
friendly again together. Mary had a little money left to her and
with Mabel's husband to urge Mabel they began again a business of
dress-making in that part of Gossols where rich people were living.
Mary Maxworthing did the managing and the fashion and the excusing
and the matching and the arranging for fittings and the arranging
for paying and the changing, and Mabel the dress-making. They
always had some trouble between them but this time they were
successful enough with their undertaking. Later Mary Maxworthing
married the man, as I was saying. They all four of them were
successful enough in their living.</p>

<p>These then were the dress-makers Mrs. Hersland had in her middle
living. The woman with the daughters, to do plain sewing and making
over and putting on skirt braids and sometimes mending. Lillian
Rosenhagen to make ordinary dresses for Mrs. Hersland and dresses
for Martha and sometimes for the governess living in the house with
her, and Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker to make her best dresses
for her and once to make a dress for the last governess Miss
Madeleine Wyman and there is now soon to be a history of this dress
for her.</p>

<p>These then made Mrs. Hersland's clothes and clothes for her
daughter Martha, sometimes for the governess living with her.</p>

<p>There were, as I was saying, in the middle living of the
Hersland family, three governesses, a foreign woman, and a tall
blond foreign American who later married a baker, and then
Madeleine Wyman who was with them when Mrs. Hersland had in living,
her most important feeling. This is now a history of the three of
them and then there will be a little more history of Mrs. Hersland
and Mr. Hersland and of them with them, and then there will begin a
history of the three children, a long history of each one of
them.</p>

<p>The first governess then was a foreign woman. She was a good
musician.</p>

<p>It is very interesting that every one has in them their kind of
stupid being. It is very important to know it in each one which
part in them, which kind of feeling in them is connected with
stupid being in them. There is then stupid being in every one. It
was hard to know it in the foreign woman who was such a good
musician and the first governess the Hersland family had living
with them, it was hard to know the stupid being that was surely
somewhere in her. It was hard to know her enough to know where to
find it in her. She had a sister, in that way perhaps one could
find it in her. This is now a history of her, and the sister and
the Hersland family with her.</p>

<p>The sister was much younger. She was then in Gossols, then
studying to be a teacher. She was always a little afraid of her
sister. She always addressed her as sister Martha. It was very hard
to find the stupid being in the governess even when she was with
her sister. It was very hard to find stupid being in her then even
when her sister was with her. She was then a woman nearly forty.
She had been a governess ever since she was twenty. She had been,
the last ten years, in America. She had brought her young sister
with her, she wanted her to be educated to be a teacher, she wanted
her to live in America where life would be easier. She herself did
not like it in America, she wanted to go back to her old living
where people spoke french and German and where it was natural for
her to be a musician. It was not to her, natural to be musical in
Gossols. She did not stay very long with the Herslands, her sister
soon got a position as teacher and then the elder sister left her,
she wanted then to leave America, this did not come to her, she got
as far as Cincinnati and then somehow she never got farther. She
stayed there and she gave music lessons and she never got any
further and she stayed there always until she died there, and she
never had left America. As I was saying it was not easy to know it
in her the stupid being in her. As I was saying every one has in
them their kind of stupid being. In almost every one sometime to
every one it is clear in them which kind of feeling in them is
connected with stupid being in them. There is stupid being in every
one. It was not easy to know the stupid being in this first
governess of the Herslands As I was saying she was a good musician.
As I was saying she had been then almost twenty years in the
occupation of governessing. She had been ten years in America, she
had not much gayety in living, she had not in her anything of
dreary being. It is then very interesting always to know the stupid
being in each one. It was hard to see it in this one. It was hard
even to see it in her living with her sister and in this way it
often comes out in women. It was hard to know the stupid being in
her for no one came close to her not even her sister. No one came
close enough to her to know easily the stupid being in her. With
some, you have to come close to them to know the stupid being in
them. This first governess of the Hersland family was such a one.
She had come to have some queerness in her. Was it queerness of
herself inside her or was it governess queerness in her. It is hard
to tell it in one when no one comes close to that one whether it is
queerness in that one from the character, or from the life that one
is leading, from conditions or to earn a living. There are many
then who have queerness in them. This first governess of the
Herslands was such a one, no one, not even her sister Olga even
dimly inside her, ever was very certain what was stupid being in
her. She had queerness in her but not enough to make a strange
creature of her, just enough to keep herself together. No one was
ever very certain whether keeping herself together was the
queerness in her, whether it was governess queerness she had in
her, no one was ever very certain of this in her not even her
sister. To be sure her sister was a young girl when they were
together. Later Olga the sister stayed in Gossols and her sister
left her after having established her. There was almost twenty
years between them, Olga was afraid of her sister, and then she was
separated from her, and they never afterwards saw each other. And
so Olga never came to be sure about her sister as to what was the
stupid being in her. Perhaps it was the having to keep herself
together. Perhaps it was the queerness in her. Perhaps it was the
not having real queerness in her, just enough to keep herself
together.</p>

<p>The first governess, then, did not stay a long time with the
Herslands. It was not that any one of them wanted she should leave
them. She did not make much of any impression on any of them. It
made no difference to any of them her leaving or staying. She knew
some funny foreign songs and the children liked to hear them and
she was a good musician and that was all the meaning she had for
them. As I was saying she had a little queerness in her but not
enough to make her important to those near her. She had queerness
enough to keep her together. As I was saying her sister was always
a little afraid of her but she was twenty years younger and they
did not live a long time together, her sister never came to know
the meaning of queerness in her. She was to her, sister Martha, who
gave the money to make her a teacher, who had given money so she
had been kept at school after the father and mother had died and
left her with no one to support her. Later when she had gotten a
position and was earning her own living, she, sister Martha left
Gossols and went to Cincinnati. They never again came together.</p>

<p>As I was saying the first governess of the Herslands had
queerness in her, not enough to make any impression on any of the
Hersland family in the time they had her, enough to keep herself
together, enough to keep her sister from ever knowing any stupid
being in her, enough as I say to keep her together, to make her.
She had queerness in her. She had stupid being in her. Some have
more and some have less character. This is the amount she had in
her. Later there will be a history of her sister. There are then
many being made, many always existing of every kind of men and
women. There are always, there always have been, there always will
be everywhere in every kind of living millions of every kind of
them. There are then always many millions of every kind of men and
women. In all the millions of each kind of them there are all
degrees of successful living. Some kind have more successful living
in more of them than other kinds of them. But in all kinds of them
there are all degrees of success in living in the many millions
always existing of that kind of them. The first governess the
Herslands had with them was of a kind of men and women who most of
them are successful enough in living and many of them come pretty
close to complete failing but few of them completely fail in
living, not many of them are really successful in living. Mostly
they keep themselves from failing, this is mostly the successful
being in them. Successful being in many of them is keeping
themselves from failing. Some have more, some have less
concentration in them, some have very much concentration in them,
all of this kind of them have some concentration in them even if
like in this one it is only as queerness, enough queerness to hold
together the whole of them. This first governess of the Herslands,
who did not stay a long time with them, had in her, dependent
independent being. The two, dependent and independent being were so
balanced in her that resisting was almost attacking in her, that
dependence was almost independence in her. It never really came to
be a force in her, she had enough concentration of it all in her to
make it in a sense seem like successful being in her, it was just
enough in her, the concentration in her, to keep her from failure,
it was as queerness in her and that gave her for some who saw her,
more concentration than was in her. There was just enough queerness
in her to hold her together. There was just enough concentration in
her to keep her from failure. There was enough queerness in her to
make character for her. There was not enough concentration in her
to make success or failure, there was enough in her to keep her
from failure, to keep people from coming close to her, to make her
younger sister afraid of her, to give enough dignity to her to keep
her always from giving way or failure. There was not enough in her
to make any impression on any one around her, though when any one
thought about her they remembered her as one having character, more
character than they felt when they were with her. She had dependent
independent being in her. These were so balanced in her, that
dependent being was like independent being, independent like
dependent being in her. She was kept together. She had queerness
enough in her to keep her together, to keep her from failure. This
is a history of her. There are always many millions made like her,
some have more some have less concentration in them, some have more
some have less success in living. She always kept from failing to
her dying. She never really had any success in living.</p>

<p>As I was saying she was a good musician. They liked her well
enough, the Herslands, when she was governess to them but she made
no impression on any of them. She did not give to Mrs. Hersland any
important feeling of herself to herself inside her, to her feeling.
Mr. Hersland had a theory of her in the beginning, he wanted to
have a real foreign woman, a real governess with concentrated
being, with German and french and who was really a musician. She
was what he wanted then for his children and he employed her. When
he remembered about her, when he saw her, or his wife or children
mentioned her he knew she was what he felt they needed to have as
governess in the house for the children. Theoretically, she was
important to him, really she had no existence for him. What she was
was just what he wanted for his children, a foreign woman who knew
German and French well and was a good musician. Then he forgot
about her for she had never when with them any existence for him.
Then when she left them after a little while with them because her
sister had become a teacher and so she could leave her and she
wanted to leave America, when she left them Mr. Hersland thought it
was better that the children should have American training. They
were American, they did not need french and German, they did not
need to bother about music then, they could do that later, now they
needed strength and gymnastics and out of door living, and swimming
and shooting. And that was the end of the first governess for all
of them.</p>

<p>They sometimes saw the sister Olga who was a teacher in Gossols
but she never talked much about her sister Martha. The children
liked Olga, they liked her, they liked to tease her. Mr. Hersland
gave her good advice, when Mr. Hersland noticed her he was
attracted by her. Olga was very different from her sister
Martha.</p>

<p>She had as I was saying independent dependent being in her. She
had very much vague being as a bottom to her. She had all sorts of
attacking to make attraction in her. Later the children made fun of
her. Later the vague bottom in her was stupid being and nervous
being and sometimes silly being in her.</p>

<p>No one who knew her would think of her as a woman of a spinster
nature. She was round and pleasant and men liked her and she had
constant attacking ways in her to give to her more attraction and
men could be in love with her and she wanted to have attention from
them and she made them when they were anywhere near her give it to
her, made them sure of her from her actions toward them and she had
as a bottom a vague being and later this was in her as nervous
being in her, never as impatient being in her.</p>

<p>No one would ever think of her as a woman with a spinster nature
but this was true of her. She was as I was saying a pleasant
person, more, even an attractive person. She was round and kind and
pretty in a fashion. She had plenty of attraction and she was full
up with attacking to give to herself more attraction.</p>

<p>As I was saying no one would ever naturally think of her as a
spinster but this was true of her and more and more later it came
to be clear in her. Always she had attacking in all kinds of ways
to give to herself more attraction and always she had as a bottom a
vague being so that she was a ways being baffling, always making
for herself a stupid escaping, sometimes not an easy escaping,
sometimes she had to escape by accusation.</p>

<p>She had in her independent dependent nature. Attacking was to
her a natural way of fighting, she was full up with vague bottom
and all the rest with constant pleasing attacking, she had never in
her any real fighting. There was no connecting her attacking with
her large vague bottom, with the large vague bottom in her that
made her baffling, that later turned into nervous being in her. She
had a spinster nature. No one who knew her ever thought about it in
her. They never knew this in her. Every one just thought it was
stupid being in her. Later the Hersland boys made fun of her. Later
there will be more history of her as Alfred Hersland comes to make
fun of her, as Martha Hersland came to know her. Mrs. Hersland
always kept track of her and was good to her. Mr. Hersland knew her
in his later living when he had trouble. All this will be a history
of her. All this will be written later. Everybody called her Olga.
It was natural to be familiar to her.</p>

<p>There was then in the Hersland middle living this first
governess who did not stay long with them. As I was saying when Mr.
Hersland employed her, he was the one who interviewed her, she was
the ideal for him. He wanted a real governess, a foreign woman with
governess training, one who was a good musician, one who would talk
french and German with the children. After she was with them
whenever he noticed her he was certain that she was what he wanted
to have for the children. When she left he had already in him a new
beginning.</p>

<p>Now he wanted the children not to have their English spoiled by
french and German. Now he was certain that music was a thing no one
could learn when they were children. This was something every one
should have in their later living, children should have freedom,
should have an out of doors gymnasium, should have swimming and
public school living, should have a governess who would live with
them such a life and not teach them french or German, not teach
them anything, just be a healthy person with them. And so this next
governess was very different from the last one. She was a tall
blond woman. She had no queerness in her. Later she married a
baker. She was a healthy person. There was no trouble for any one
to know her stupid being. But it made no difference to any one that
she had stupid being, that that was almost her whole being, there
was nothing that any one wanted of her that made her stupid being a
trouble in her. Stupid being was the whole of her. It was alright
in her. It was not actively pleasant in her. It was just all of
her.</p>

<p>She was not a music teacher, she had no french or German in her,
she just knew the ordinary things and not very well either. The
children knew the stupid being in her. Every one could see it in
her, it was almost the whole of her. She had no evil in her, not
much of anything in her, there was a great deal of her, she was
tall and blond and stupid being filled her. She did not give it to
Mrs. Hersland to have in her much sense of important being in her.
They all, all the governesses and servants and seamstresses gave
some of it some time to her but it was to come more strongly to her
later through the third and last governess, Madeleine Wyman.</p>

<p>It is very interesting that every one has in them their kind of
stupid being. It is very interesting to know it in each one which
part in them, which kind of feelings in them is connected with
stupid being in them. It is interesting to know it in each one the
meaning of stupid being in them, it is interesting to know what
each one finds as stupid being in every other one.</p>

<p>Each one then has in them stupid being, every one has in them
their own way of eating, drinking, sleeping, resting, waking,
wanting things and getting or not getting them. Each one has in
them their own way of succeeding in living, or in failing. Each one
has in them their own way of being, their own being in them, and
sometime there will be a history of all of them.</p>

<p>Stupid being then is in every one. Stupid being then can be in
every one mixed in them with their way of eating, or their way of
drinking, or loving, or working, or waking, or resting, or doing
nothing, or having pleasant or angry feeling in them, or succeeding
or failing. Some can have stupid being mixed up with part of all of
them, with some or a few or all the things in them that come out in
them as repeating to make a history of them.</p>

<p>The second governess was a whole being, mostly to every one
there was passive stupid being in her in every moment of her
living. This is now a history of her.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of women and some kinds of men, there are
then some women and some men of some kinds of nature who have it in
them to have every one who knows them have about the same idea of
them have about the same feeling about them. Some have more, some
have less interest in such a one, some who know such a one may have
a liking, some who know such a one may not have any such a feeling,
some may have dislike in them toward such a one, some who know them
never think about them, but every one who knows such a one has the
same feeling about the being in such a one, the stupid being that
makes such a one. There is a kind of being then that is very
convincing. The second governess the Herslands had living with them
was such a one. She was a big blond woman. She had just had an
ordinary education.</p>

<p>There are many ways of being what every one who knows such a one
thinks them. There are many ways of being, there are many of many
different kinds of men and women who give to every one who knows
them the same feeling of them. There are many millions always being
made of men and women who give to different ones who know them a
different feeling of them. There are some, there are many of many
kinds of men and women who give to every one the same feeling about
them, Mary Maxworthing in her way was such a one. The second
governess the Herslands had was a very different kind of such a
one. Every one who knew her had the same estimate of her. The
children laughed at her, they neither liked or disliked her, Mrs.
Hersland had not any feeling about her. Later this one married a
baker. He was a big blond man, and they got on very well together.
She had children, she grew a little larger, her face was thinner,
she was a little dirtier then, not very much busier, she never
surprised any one who knew her. Her father and her mother had a
dairy farm and they managed to get along. She had a brother who was
to succeed the father. It did not make any difference to any one
who was her father or her mother or her brother. No one ever had
much interest about her, not even the baker, he liked her, they got
along very well together, he gave the Hersland children cream-puffs
while he talked to her. She married and sometimes later the
children or Mrs. Hersland or Mr. Hersland would see her, she was a
little grimier then, but nothing was changed in her, she was a
little larger, her face and neck were thinner, she and the baker
were satisfied with each other.</p>

<p>As I was saying men and women have many of them in them their
individual feeling in their way of feeling it in them about
themselves to themselves inside them about the ways of being they
have in them. Some have almost nothing of such a feeling in them,
some have it a little in them, some have it in them always as a
conscious feeling, some have it as a feeling of themselves inside
them, some have it as a feeling of themselves inside them as
important to them, some have it as a feeling of being important to
themselves inside them as being always in them, some have it as
being important to the others around them, some have it as being
inside them that there is nothing existing except their kind of
living, some have it that they feel themselves inside them as big
as all the world around them, some have it that they are themselves
the only important existing in the world then and in some of them
for forever in them, these have in them the complete thing of being
important to themselves inside them. Some have it as a feeling of
being important in them from things they are doing, from religion
in them, from the ways of living they have in them, from the
clothes they have on them, from the way they have of eating, from
the way they have of drinking, from the way they have of sleeping,
some have a feeling of importance in them from the kind of living
they have in them and the others around them have in them, there
are many ways of having a feeling of one's self inside one, there
are many ways of having an important feeling in one, there are some
who have in them a feeling of importance inside but not a feeling
of importance of themselves to themselves inside them, there are
some who have inside them an important feeling in them but not an
individual feeling in them, there are many ways for men and women
to have themselves inside to them and this is a history of some of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. David Hersland had in him a feeling of being as big as all
the world around him. He had his ideas of educating children. He
was always full up with beginning. He was as big as all the world
around him. He never thought about it in himself then, it was
natural to him. Each beginning was in him such a feeling.</p>

<p>He had first seen the first governess they had and he had had a
feeling in him that was the ideal governess for his children. She
was a good musician, it was necessary then to him that they should
have much music in their education. She was a good scholar in
french and German, he talked to her about the way he would insist
always that his children should talk french and German. She was an
ideal to him, she was beginning to him, he would see to it that the
children learned all this governess could teach them. He talked to
her in the beginning often about them and his rules and wishes for
them. Then she made no impression on him, she was not evident
enough in the family living to attract his attention. She soon died
out of him. Soon he forgot about the children and their education.
Then she left them. Then he was angry with the children that they
knew so little french and German. Then there was in him a new
beginning, he thought it better for their English that they should
forget all the french and German the first governess had taught
them. They should not spend time learning music when they needed
physical training, he would have a good healthy woman, not a too
well educated one, to help them with their lessons and to see that
they did gymnastics and swimming. This time he wanted a big healthy
woman. He did not want a small one that had no color in her face
and was careful in every motion. He wanted a strong healthy woman,
one who knew something about farming, one who did not spend her
time in reading or piano practicing. He had in him then a new
beginning. He wanted a big healthy woman who knew all about
farming. The second governess then was such a one. Her father and
mother had a dairy farm and she was a big blond woman and she had
red cheeks and she was not a musician and she did not know any
french and German and she had had only an ordinary education and
she knew nothing about spending her time in reading. There was no
question that she was the ideal Mr. Hersland had then in him for a
governess for his children. He never forgot about her altogether as
he did about the first one. She was always some one to him, he
liked big healthy women, she did not know much about farming but
she listened while he talked to her about farming and about the
children. Later he did not talk to her about the children, a little
still about farming, but when he noticed her she made a certain
impression on him. Later when she was married to the baker he would
drop in to see her and eat a cake while he talked to her. He did
not mind much that she was larger then and paler and a little
dirtier in her dressing a little sordider, grimier. She was not
important ever to the children but this will come out later in the
history of the children as it will be written of each one of the
three of them.</p>

<p>There are many ways for men to have loving in them and loving
come out from them. Some men have it in them in their loving to be
attacking, some have it in them to let things sink into them, some
let themselves wallow in their feeling and get strength in them
from the wallowing they have in loving, some in loving are melting
strength passes out from them, some in their loving are worn out
with the nervous desire in them, some have it as a dissipation in
them, some have it as they have eating and sleeping, some have it
as they have resting, some have it as a dissipation of them, some
have it as a clean attacking, some have it as a simple beginning
feeling in them, some have it as the ending always of them, some of
them are always old men in their loving.</p>

<p>Every one then every man and every woman have then their own
feeling in loving, their own way of feeling in religion, their own
way of laughing, of eating, of drinking, of going on living, of
taking what comes to them, of looking for things to irritate them
or content them, their own way of beginning and of ending.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersland then had his own way of being in him. The
governesses had each one their own way of being in them. Each one
had a certain effect on him.</p>

<p>It is very interesting that every one has in them their kind of
stupid being. It is very important to know it in each one which
part in them, which kind of feeling in them is connected with
stupid being in them. There is then stupid being in every one.
There is in every one their own way of living, of eating, of
drinking, of beginning and ending, remembering and forgetting, of
going on and stopping. There is then in every one their own way of
responding to things, to any one that touches them, to everything
in living. There is in every one repeating. There is in every one a
different way of repeating in their beginning and in their middle
living and in their ending. Sometime there will be a complete
history of every one and of all the repeating in them.</p>

<p>Eating and sleeping then and drinking and being loving and
working and waking and resting and doctoring and having religion
and beginning and ending. Mr. Hersland was now in the beginning of
his middle living. He was beginning then his habits of middle
living. He was beginning then his regular country house living and
governesses were then part of the regular living he had in him,
with his eating and sleeping and talking and beginning. Habits were
beginning in him. Repeating is always in every one, it settles in
them in the beginning of their middle living to be a steady
repetition with very little changing. There may be in them then
much beginning and much ending, but it is steady repeating in them
and the children with them have in them the pounding of the steady
march of repeating the parents of them have in them. Mr. Hersland
then was beginning to have in him his repeating of beginning middle
living. He had then in him eating and sleeping and hygiene and much
beginning and hearty laughing and impatient being and a kind of
interest in some people near him and some brushing away of his wife
from around him and his regular derangements in his stomach and in
his dieting. He had in him then the beginning of his middle
living.</p>

<p>Every one, then, as I was saying, have in them, always,
repeating. Every one who does not die before then has in them the
steady pound of repeating in the beginning of their middle living.
It becomes then more and more part of them, their way, their way of
drinking, their way of beginning and of ending, their way of
talking, of laughing, of having impatient being in them, their way
of being attracted by women and by men.</p>

<p>There was then the beginning of middle living now in Mr.
Hersland. It was in him then already in the beginning of their
living in Gossols and having the first governess for the children.
For Mrs. Hersland it was not yet in beginning. It came to her later
with the governess Madeleine Wyman. A part then of middle living in
Mr. Hersland was his way of educating his children; his daily
habits then in his country living with his wife and his children
and a governess to teach them. The ideas in him then about their
education were his habits of beginning middle living. The
attraction each governess had or had not for him, the impression
she made or did not make on him was all part of his middle living.
Later in the ending of his middle living it came to be a more
sodden repeating. Now repeating was in him a varied vigorous
pounding. This is now a description.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersland, as I said once when speaking of the kind of loving
he had in him, Mr. Hersland had then in the beginning of his middle
living, had his wife to content him. She was then a pleasant
feeling in him, she was then a little of a joke to him, she had
then still a little resisting for him, he then did not much brush
her away from around him, he did not then forget about her
existing, in his feeling, she was then still important to him. As I
was saying, then in their younger living, still in the beginning of
his middle living she gave him all the stimulation he needed to
attract him, for his loving; he was not then yet full up with
impatient feeling, he had then yet a pleasant feeling in living and
her resisting was important enough to him to hold him. Later he
needed more to fill him, in his latest living when he was shrunk
away from the outside of him, when he had not enough beginning
enough impatient feeling to fill him, he needed then another kind
of woman. This will come out later in the later history of him.</p>

<p>At this time then in this beginning of his middle living he had
in him a cheerful sense of being, he had enough contentment from
his wife, he did not then need much stimulation. He had in him then
some impatient feeling but this was not yet very strongly in him.
It came to be in him then when he was going to be very soon ready
for a new beginning. It was in him then when there was an end then
of something or it was continuing too long to suit him, whether it
was his own or some one else's talking, whether it was his own or
some one else's doing, that never made any difference to him, it
was the sense in him of a new beginning that gave to him impatient
feeling.</p>

<p>In the beginning of his middle living then some women were
attractive to him. It was not then much of a need in him. Mostly
then it was a joke to him. Later he had more need in him. This will
come out in the later history of him.</p>

<p>There are many ways then of having some feeling about people
near one. This is different in different parts of the living in
one. Now this is a history of the middle living of Mr. Hersland, of
the beginning and middle of his middle living. Later there will be
a history of the ending of his middle living and then of his later
living, in the written history of his children.</p>

<p>There are many ways then that one has feeling for people near
them. This is now a history of feeling in Mr. Hersland in the
beginning of his middle living.</p>

<p>As I was saying he selected the two first governesses for his
children, the first was his ideal of a governess for them then, a
woman with governess training, a good musician and having a
thorough understanding of french and German. She was his ideal
then. When he told her what his ideals were for his children, she
made an impression on him. Mostly, later, he never noticed her, she
made no impression on him, sometimes later when she listened while
he told her what he knew about education she made some impression
but it was always a reflection, it was only when she was listening
that she made an impression and that was only by virtue of her
training, the listening of somebody so welltrained in education
made an impression on him, it was her training it was never herself
that made an impression on him. When she left the Herslands he had
not any longer much interest in talking to her training, he was
already then full up then with a new beginning.</p>

<p>He had then a feeling that he wanted a big strong healthy woman
to be with his children. They could get enough education from
public schools and reading, he had had that kind of education, it
would be the best thing for them. He told the governess what he
wanted she should do for the children, what his ideas were about
them. She listened to him but her listening was not stimulating,
but she made an impression, he liked well enough to notice her then
and later when she was married to the baker, when she was larger
then and a little grimy he still liked to see her, he would stop by
at her shop where she was sitting attending to the custom and he
would eat a cake there and ask her how she was getting on and he
liked that much contact with her. Later there was a third governess
Madeleine Wyman.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersland then in the beginning of his middle living wanted
mildly a little attraction in women but mostly then it was not a
need in him, his wife then was existent to him, he liked well
enough a little looking at women who made on him then some
impression. So he liked a little to be with the second governess
when she was with them and later when she was married to the baker.
She was a big blond woman. She made a mild impression on him. He
liked to give her advice and talk about little things and later to
eat a cake while she sat there sewing. This was the beginning of
his middle living. There was then in Mr. Hersland in the beginning
of his middle living beginning to be very completely in him as
repeating his way of eating, of thinking, of laughing, of talking,
of beginning, of having impatient feeling, of being attracted by
women. There was then in him beginning accented repeating that
later would be louder and have less changing in repeating. Later
what was now an attraction to him would be then a need in him,
later there will be a history of him. Now there is enough history
of him. Now there will be a history of Mrs. Hersland and the
important feeling she had in her with the third governess Madeleine
Wyman. Mr. Hersland had then in him now the beginning of his middle
living repeating. This is clear now in him. Later there will be
more description of this being in him as his children and his
children's friends get to know it in him. The kind of loving women
and men have in them and the ways it comes out from them makes for
them the bottom nature in them, gives to them their kind of
thinking, makes the character they have all their living in them,
makes them then their kind of women and men and there are always
many millions made of each kind of them.</p>

<p>The kind of loving then women have in them and the ways it comes
out from them makes for them the bottom nature in them, gives to
them their kind of thinking, makes the character they have all
their living in them, makes them their kind of women and there are
always many millions made of each kind of them.</p>

<p>Some women have it in them to love others because they need
them, because these somehow are important to them, because somehow
these they have for loving belong to them, many of such of them
subdue the ones they need for loving, they subdue them and they own
them; some of them who have it to be of this kind of women have it
in them so lightly in them this being in them as to be almost of no
importance to those they have around them in their living, to have
their children belong to them only as a part of them inside them,
these are of the kind of them who always own their children who
subdue those they need in loving but these of this kind of women
have it to have this that is them very gently in them and Mrs.
Hersland was of such a kind of them, these have it in them to be it
so gently in them that it never comes out in them with some it
comes out a very little in them, these then have it to be so
timidly in them some so dimly in them, some so gently in them, some
so slightly in them that their children are only a part of them as
having been once in them, it is with such of them only in such a
way that they can ever own them; some of such a kind of them have
it all so peaceably inside them that they have not in them the
feeling of being themselves inside them, it takes some one around
them to need them to be owned by them to make such a kind of one
own them, to make such of them feel it inside them that they are
themselves inside them, to give to them anything of an important
feeling. There are then this kind of women many of them are very
dependent all through their living but a little in them is an
independent feeling and this comes out in them when there is any
one around them who makes them own them and with such a one they
are important inside them any moment in their living. These are of
the dependent independent kind of men and women. Mrs. Hersland had
a very little such a feeling with her husband when she was first
married to him, she had it in her when she was a little resisting
to him; she never would have had much more in her if she had gone
on living the life that was for her the natural way of being, she
had it a little more in her feeling with the Shilling family in her
hotel living, it came to be strongest in her in her living with a
governess and a seamstress and servants in the house with her and,
for her, poor people, around her, with always inside her country
house feeling of right rich living, with nothing in her daily being
of such a living, which was the natural way of living for her. She
had it then in her to feel herself inside her and it was then
strongest in her and came out in her with the governess Madeleine
Wyman who was for her the one who in all her living was the one
whom she had power over, not as part of her, as her children were
to her, but as outside of her. She fought with the family of
Madeleine Wyman for her, she had a feeling then of herself inside
her.</p>

<p>There are then two kinds of women, those who have dependent
independence in them, those who have in them independent dependence
inside them; the first ones of them always somehow own the ones
they need to love them, the second kind of them have it in them to
love only those who need them, such of them have it in them to have
power in them over others only when these others have begun already
a little to love them, others loving them gives to such of them
strength in domination. There are then these two ways of loving
there are these two ways of being when women have loving in them as
a bottom nature to them, there are then many kinds of mixing, there
are many kinds of each kind of them, some women have it in them to
have a bottom nature in them of one of these two kinds of loving
and then this is mixed up in them with the other kind of loving as
another nature in them but all this will come clear in the history
of all kinds of women and some kinds of men as it will now be
written of them.</p>

<p>In the Hersland family during the middle part of the family
living when the children were beginning to have in them their
individual living, when Mrs. Hersland was beginning to have
strongest inside her her own important feeling, when Mr. Hersland
was strongest in beginning and making his great fortune, during
this middle living they had as governess with them Madeleine Wyman
and this is now part of her history with them.</p>

<p>As I was saying some women have it in them to own those who love
them, to subdue such then, these are of them who have dependent
independent nature in them, they have resisting in them as their
way of fighting. Some who have independent dependent nature in them
and have attacking in them as their way of fighting, and have much
strength in attacking have this way of subduing those they need for
loving, this is another kind then of subduing from that in
Madeleine Wyman or in Mrs. Hersland. Later there will be a history
of all the kinds who have attacking subduing in them. Now there is
a history of Mrs. Hersland and the moment she had in her with
Madeleine Wyman as governess to her children and living with her,
the time in her of the strongest being of herself inside her to
her. This is now some of this history in her. This is now some of
the history of Madeleine Wyman. This is now a history of the Wyman
family and the struggle Mrs. Hersland made to keep Madeleine Wyman
as governess in the house with her. This is the history of the
nature in Mrs. Hersland and in Madeleine Wyman and in every member
of the Wyman family. This then is to be now a long history of
Madeleine Wyman. This is a history of the affection and the
knowledge and the stupid being in her and the loving and the later
living and the marrying of her and the death of her husband and her
later living and her power of owning and subduing what she needed
for loving and the nature in her and Mrs. Hersland's feeling for
her and Mrs. Hersland's feeling inside her from the being with her
and Mr. Hersland's feeling for her. Then later, in the history of
the Hersland children, there will be more history of her. Now this
is a fresh beginning. And now there will begin a long description
of her. Many women have sensitive being in them. Many have it as a
bottom to them. Some of such of them have attacking as their way of
fighting, some of such of them have resisting as their way of
winning. Some of such of them have yielding of them as their way of
subduing, some of such of them have resisting as their way of
subduing. Some have weakening in them from the sensitive being as
the bottom of them, some nervous being, some creating, some loving,
some suffering, some yielding, some resisting. Mrs. Hersland had
sensitive being as the bottom to her being, sometimes this was in
her as suffering, sometimes as loving, sometimes as resisting.</p>

<p>Some then who have sensitive being as the bottom of them, some
then of the many of them who have sensitive being as the bottom in
them and have dependent independent nature in them, have resisting
as their natural way of fighting, many then of this kind of them
who have sensitive being as the bottom of them have not in much of
their living much resisting. Many of such of them have not in their
living very much fighting. Some have only for a little bit of their
living real resisting in them, then they do not make any
concession, then they have real resisting in them. Then the
sensitive being in them turns into resisting being in them, this
may lead to stupid acting by them, it is not stupid being in them,
it is the way of fighting that should mean winning for them, when
they have not enough in them for winning it often makes stupid
acting, in them, it is not stupid being in them. Mrs. Hersland was
such a one and it will come out in her living when she is herself
inside her to her feeling. If came out a little in her in her
loving, when she was young and a little resisting to her husband
then to subdue him. It never showed in her with her children, not
even when she was resisting her husband for them, resisting in her
then was more nearly then attacking, it was defending them against
him, sometimes it was real, resisting against him, it never was in
her ever in her relation to any of them, they were always inside
her to her feeling or they were big around her, too big and she was
lost among them. She never had any feeling of herself to herself
inside her ever with any one of the three of them. In her relation
to servants and governesses and the families of them when any of
such ones tried to be interfering then she was to herself then
complete in resisting, then to herself she had not any concession
ever to make to any one of them. She could have sharp angry
indignation then, she could have strongly then inside her
resisting, she never then could have inside her any conceding. She
then often did very stupid acting, it was not in her, this
resisting, stupid being, it was that sensitive being was not in her
to the point of really creating resisting. It was that made her
resisting then stupid acting, it was not in her then stupid being.
This is clear now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland to herself was never cut off from rich right
living. She was to herself cut off from Bridgepoint living, from
eastern travelling, from southern feeling, she was not to herself
cut off from rich living, she was to herself part of this being, in
her Gossols living. She did not do much visiting but she was to
herself always part of such living. She was to herself cut off from
her family living, she was cut off from Bridgepoint living, she was
in the west and eastern living was natural to her being. She had
done travelling when she was younger, travelling with a cousin and
a sister, she was now to her feeling cut off from such living. She
was never to her dying, to herself, cut off from right rich being.
She did not do much visiting, she was part of right rich being.
This was herself in her feeling.</p>

<p>She was cut off from Bridgepoint living, from travelling, from
eastern living, she had this to herself in her feeling, later she
went to Bridgepoint and she was a princess to them, she was a rich
woman, Mr. Hersland had then just made his great fortune. She was a
princess to them, she was not of them, she never was to herself
ever after the beginning of her Gossols living, ever again part of
Bridgepoint living. She was always to herself cut off from eastern
living, from her family being. As I was saying when she went much
later on a visit to Bridgepoint she was a princess to them. Earlier
her early eastern living was a romance to her feeling. Always it
was a romance to her feeling. Always even after she had visited
them and been like a princess to them, for them, with them, eastern
living was a romance to her feeling. Always she was cut off from
eastern living, she never was to herself cut off from ordinary
right rich being.</p>

<p>Always then, eastern living, her early travelling, was a romance
to her feeling, it was later a little a romance to her children.
Later they had a sore feeling that their third governess shared it
with them, that she owned the romance of the early living more than
they owned it in them, more than it belonged to their mother in
their feeling, it belonged then to Madeleine Wyman to their
feeling, she owned the romance of their mother's early living, she
owned then, later to their feeling, their mother's living, they had
no freedom in their mother's living, later, in their feeling,
Madeleine Wyman had the romance of their mother's early living as
her possession. This was later a little a sore feeling in them,
later when their mother's romance was no longer interesting to
them, Madeleine Wyman had then come to own their mother and their
father, to them. This was always a sore feeling in them. Mrs.
Hersland had then all through her living her feeling of being
always a right part of right rich ordinary being. Her children then
were more of them the poor people living near them than they were
of their mother's living then, though they were all of their
mother's being then, all of her daily living then. Her husband was
beginning then to be more then of the daily living around him than
she was of him, of the men and women near them, not so much as the
children were then but more than she ever could be in her feeling.
He was then in the beginning of the middle part of his middle
living, soon then he would begin to be more full up with impatient
being. The children then as I was saying were more then of the
living of the, for her, poor queer people around them than they
were of their mother's living then. Her husband Mr. Hersland was
beginning to have in him more feeling of brushing people away from
around him, of being of them whoever it was that was at the moment
near him. It was then, Mrs. Hersland had in her, strongest inside
her, her feeling of herself to herself in her, she had then her
strongest feeling of important being in her of herself inside her
and she had this with Madeleine Wyman living in the house with
her.</p>

<p>There are many ways of being, there are many ways of loving.
Some subdue the ones they need for their loving. There are many
ways of subduing. There are many ways of owning other ones around
one This is a history of some of them. This is a history of two of
them.</p>

<p>The Hersland family, then, had three governesses living with
them. There was the first one, the good musician with a regular
governess training, there was the second one without too much
education, there was a third one and this is now a history of
her.</p>

<p>This is now a history of her with her family, with Mr. Hersland,
with Mrs. Hersland, with every one she ever knew in her living from
its beginning to its ending.</p>

<p>This is now a beginning of the history of her, Mrs. Hersland
talked a great deal to her. Madeleine always listened to her. This
is now a history of their talking to each other. This is now a
history of how they owned each other.</p>

<p>It is very interesting that every one has in them their kind of
stupid being. It is very important to know it in each one which
part in them which kind of feeling in them is connected with stupid
being in them. There is then stupid being in every one.</p>

<p>There is then stupid being in every one, there is some subduing,
some escaping in every one, there is some resisting and some
attacking in every one. It is interesting to know it in each one
what in them is stupid being for them, what kind of acting is
stupid being in them, what kind of stupid acting is or is not
stupid being in them. Sometime some one will know it of every one,
what is and what is not stupid being in each one. This is now a
history of two of them. This is now a history of more of them. This
is now a history of Mrs. Hersland and Madeleine Wyman and the
subduing power in each one of them and the escaping in each one of
them and the resisting and attacking in each one of them and the
stupid being in each one of them and the important being in each
one of them. There is then now to be a history of the two of them,
there is then now to be a history of the two of them and of all of
the others near them, of the servants living in the house with
them, of Mr. Hersland and later of the three Hersland children, of
the Wyman family, the father and the mother and the two sisters and
the brother of Madeleine Wyman. There is now then to be a history
of all of these then, of Mrs. Hersland and Madeleine Wyman and of
every one near them or connected with them. There was then as I was
saying in Mrs. Hersland when Madeleine Wyman was living as
governess with them, the time in her living when she had in her her
completest feeling of being herself inside her in her feeling. This
is now then a description of her being.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mrs. Hersland was never to her feeling, cut off
from rich right living. She was to her feeling cut off from her
family and from eastern living and eastern travelling. She was to
herself cut off from it to her feeling even when later she went to
Bridgepoint to visit her early living. She was always to herself
then cut off from her early being. Later Madeleine Wyman owned this
early being. The three children later in their living had the
feeling that Madeleine Wyman owned their mother's early Bridgepoint
being, it gave to them a sore feeling. This is now a history of how
the third governess Madeleine Wyman came to own Mrs. Hersland's
early being and how Mrs. Hersland with Madeleine Wyman as governess
in the house with them came to have in her her most important being
of herself inside her and what feeling and being Mr. Hersland had
in him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland was never important to her children excepting to
begin them. She never had a feeling of herself to herself from
them. She was of them until they were so big that she was lost
among them, she was lost then between them and the father of
them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland was never important to her children excepting to
begin them. She was never, even to them, important to their being,
they had later a sore feeling in them because Madeleine Wyman owned
their mother and a little their father, entirely their mother later
to them, they had a sore feeling in them, not because their mother
was ever important to them, but she had made them, she so belonged
to them, she was so part of the personal being of each one of them.
Madeleine Wyman owning their mother, was to them, not an owning of
them, but a cutting off a piece from each one of them. Their mother
then was of them, they were not of her then excepting, as she was
making them, Mrs. Hersland was never important to her children
excepting to begin them.</p>

<p>Later there will be more history of the little sore feeling the
children had in them because of Madeleine Wyman, who was married
then, and their mother was no longer living, of Madeleine Wyman
owning the mother of them. Later then in the history of each one of
them there will be a description of the sore feeling they each one
had in them at Madeleine Wyman's owning the mother of them and a
little the father of them. Not that Madeleine Wyman had any
influence over any of them, over the mother or the father or any
one of the children. It was nothing of such a thing that happened
to them. It was that she owned the mother of them by living in her
feeling their mother's early living, by being the reason of their
mother having in her then when Madeleine Wyman was with them the
being herself to herself more inside her in her being than at any
other time in all her living. So Madeleine Wyman owned Mrs.
Hersland, to her children. She a little owned Mr. Hersland for them
but that was mostly in so much as he belonged to the mother of
them. Madeleine Wyman to them, to the children, never owned them,
it was only the parents of them that she held in her possession. It
was not a sore feeling ever in any one of the three of them that
owning their mother and a little their father that she ever the
least bit owned any one of the three of them. It was that in owning
their mother's early living, in her feeling, owning their mother's
moment of being most herself to herself in her feeling, owning
their father's early living and their mother's feeling for their
father then in her important being and their father's feeling for
their mother then, it was by such owning that they felt something
cut off from them. A part that should have been them Madeleine
Wyman held in possession. It was not of them then, it was cut off
from them. It should have been then as a piece of the whole of each
one of the three of them. Madeleine Wyman held it in possession. In
their very later living they each one had it again in them. They
came again to own their mother and their father in them. In their
early living they had about Madeleine Wyman a very sore feeling.
They hated to hear her talking. Their mother and a little their
father were really more important to Madeleine Wyman than they were
to any of the three of them except as to having made them, to them,
in their early living. They could not deny this to Madeleine Wyman.
She had by her feeling of the importance of their mother in the
world of beings, she had then by this a right to her owning, to her
possession, they could not deny this any one of the three of them,
it was not the importance of their mother as a being that counted
for any of the three of them, it was that she was part of them,
having made them. They were not any, any one of the three of them
ever very much of her in their feeling. She was of them to their
feeling. Not a lively feeling in them, it was important to them
only when this possession was cut off from them by Madeleine
Wyman's owning of her and her early living and her important being.
She was then, Mrs. Hersland, important to her children, only to
being them. She belonged to them then not by her important being in
her feeling; Madeleine Wyman then had a right to her possession.
The children all three of them by her possession of the mother of
them and a little of the father of them had cut off from them in
their later younger living a part of them and they had then a right
to their sore feeling at her possession of their mother and a
little of the father of them. There will be now more history of
Madeleine Wyman in this possession.</p>

<p>There is stupid being in every one. There is stupid being in
every one in their living. Stupid being in one is often not stupid
thinking or stupid acting. It very often is hard to know it in
knowing any one. Sometimes one has to know of some one the whole
history of them, the whole history of their living to know the
stupid being of them. Every one then, mostly every one, has in them
stupid being. It is hard to know stupid being in such a one as Mrs.
Hersland or even in such a one as Madeleine Wyman. Stupid being in
Mrs. Hersland was in her when she was acting. It was not in her
when she was resisting but then she had very little resisting in
her being. She had very little real fighting in her being, real
fighting in her would be as resisting. She had very little of this
in her in her living. She had a little of it in her with her
husband in the beginning and always a little all through her
living. She had a little of it in her with her children when they
were first beginning, and then she was of them but soon they were
not of her then and she had no winning fighting being for them or
with them. Sometimes about a servant she had attacking being, later
about Madeleine Wyman and that was in her stupid being. Madeleine
Wyman had in her stupid being in wanting to be subduing. Not with
Mr. or Mrs. Hersland, there she was yielding to be subduing and
that was not in her stupid being, yielding was never in her stupid
being, attacking was in her stupid being. With Mrs. Hersland and
with Mr. Hersland too she had in her yielding and so she came to
own them. She yielded herself to them and so she came to live in
them and in their early living and then she came to own them. This
was not in her stupid being. Stupid being with her was in her
failing, in her attacking, in her sometimes when resisting. Mostly
in her as attacking for subduing and this was in her stupid being.
This was true of her with the Hersland children, this was true of
her in her later living. This will sometime be clear in her as
there comes to be completely a history of her, a history of all the
living in her from her beginning to her ending.</p>

<p>There is then stupid being in every one. In many, one has to
have a whole history of all their living from their beginning to
their ending to know it in them. Mrs. Hersland was such a one. Mrs.
Hersland as I was saying was never important for her children
excepting to begin them. She never had a feeling of herself to
herself from them. She was of them until they were so big that she
was lost among them, she was lost then between them and the father
of them.</p>

<p>So then to begin again with the Hersland family's living with
the third governess Madeleine Wyman with them and with a history of
her and every one who came to know her and of the Hersland family
with her. To begin again then with Mr. Hersland and his ideas about
education. To begin again with Mr. Hersland and his choosing of the
governess for the education of his children. To begin again with
Mr. Hersland and his theories of education.</p>

<p>As I said the first governess was a real governess and knew
french and German and was a good musician. She was theoretically
satisfying to him in the beginning but personally after she began
living in the house with them she made no impression on him. Then
his theories changed in him and he wanted a woman who was strong
and used to farming and he got one and she was pleasanter for him
for she had a physical meaning for him and then she married the
baker and they all sometimes saw her after but that was the end of
her governessing and for some time then they had no one. Then they
heard of Madeleine Wyman who was everything. They needed a
governess then so the father thought because the children had
forgotten all their french and German and the daughter Martha that
year had missed annual promotion. Besides in their half country
living they needed some one to keep the family living apart from
the living around them. Anyway in Madeleine Wyman they had
everything, she knew french and German, she was an American, she
had had good American schooling, she was a fair musician, she was
intelligent and could talk as well as listen to Mr. Hersland about
education, she wanted to listen always to Mrs. Hersland's
Bridgepoint living, she felt always the gentle fine being in Mrs.
Hersland's country house living, she was good looking, she liked
walking and wanted to learn swimming. She had everything, every one
was content then, her parents were glad to have her in such a good
situation, every one was suited then and then there was a
beginning. Madeleine Wyman was the third governess the Herslands
had living with them.</p>

<p>Madeleine Wyman's father and mother were both living. There were
in all, four children. Madeleine was the oldest of them, then
Louise, then Frank, and then Helen. The Hersland children later
knew all of them. Later there will be a history of them in the
history of the three children. There will then also be a history of
Mr. and Mrs. Wyman and the later living of Madeleine. Now there is
a history of her, when she was a governess, and the feeling about
her all through her living with them in Mr. and Mrs. Hersland.
First then to begin again with Mr. Hersland and his feelings about
education. Some men then and some women have cowardly but not
fearful being in them. This is true then of many of them who have
cowardly being in them and are of independent dependent kind of men
and women. The dependent independent way of having cowardly being
in them, many of them, is to have always fearful being in them.
These are given to supposing, they always see death and danger
around them in their living. Mr. Hersland was not of them, he had
independent dependent being, attacking was his natural way of
fighting, resisting was weakness in him, he had not any fearful
being in him, he could be a coward in his living, he could brush
people away from around him, when he could not keep them brushed
down from in front of him he went another way and he never knew in
him that he was a coward then in living, he had no fearful being in
him. Later his children told it to him when they were angry with
him and the impatient feeling that then filled him. Mr. Hersland
always had it in him to be strong in beginning, he always had it in
him to feel himself inside him to be as big as all the world around
him, later he was full up with impatient being. Always he had
beginning in him, always he had theories of education, always he
talked to every one around him, always he was advising every one,
always he was talking about education, about eating, about
drinking, about washing, about healthy living, about doctoring,
about what men and women needed to make them successful in living.
Always he was talking about eating and education and marrying, and
drinking, and sleeping, and doctoring. Now there will be more
description of the talking in him.</p>

<p>There are many ways then for women to like men, there are many
ways for men to like women. Some like the other one for the health
in them, for the life in them, some for other things in them, some
need many kinds of things to content them in those they want to
have near them, some need very little in them. For some health in
another one, for some youth in another one is enough to content
them. Some women want a man to be florid and have a reddish beard
when he has one, some want him brown with a black one, some then
want health, some want youth in those near them, for some one thing
for some other things mean health in those near them. There are
many men and many women who want to see people having lots of
health, near them. For some men one kind for some men quite a
different kind is to them a fine figure of a woman. Many men and
many women want those near them to have strongly in them the
feeling and appearance of healthy being, many men say it of women
and of trees and other things near them, that's a healthy looking
one, that is in such of them the highest kind of commendation. Mr.
Hersland was such a one. Not in the woman he needed for a wife for
him, she was pretty and dark, and healthy enough looking but that
was not in her a striking thing. Mr. Hersland wanted his children
to be healthy looking, in choosing the second governess he chose
her for this being in her. In his middle living he needed this kind
of fine healthiness in women to content him, later he needed a more
active being in them, they had then to be energetic enough around
him to fill him in where he had been shrunk away then from the
outside of him. In his middle living then he wanted a woman to have
a good figure and to be healthy looking. The second governess had
been such a one and Mr. Hersland always had a certain pleasure in
having her in the house with them. Later when she had married the
baker he sometimes on his way home would stop to eat a cake and
talk to her, tell her about what was the best way to give milk to
the baby, to keep strong and not to need a doctor, what kind of a
doctor she should have to take care of her, what was the right way
for her to do to content her husband and save money and never have
any trouble to come to her. He always gave advice to her; he ate a
cake, he told her whether she was getting fatter or thinner, how to
get thinner when she was getting fatter and later after she had had
another baby and was always looking dragged and getting thinner, he
would tell her what she should do to get fatter. He always gave
advice to her, later always about her doctor and that she had a
good man to be a husband to her a good baker and later when she was
getting thinner what she should do to get fatter. He always gave
advice to her. When she was beginning to be a governess to them he
had talked to her about education and his children, later he mostly
talked to her about eating and marrying, and gave advice to her
about how to keep in condition.</p>

<p>With Madeleine Wyman it was a different matter. She was not a
healthy woman to give pleasure simply by having health in her, and
a fine figure. She was healthy but not the kind to make one feel it
in her. She had a trim figure, she was not pretty, nor ugly either,
she was pleasant and bright and had some energy. With her Mr.
Hersland could always talk about education in a different way from
that in which he talked with the second governess who had married
the baker. Madeleine Wyman was young and had understanding in her,
she was young and ready to try to carry out his theories in the way
he wanted from her. She wanted to educate the three children in
music, french and German, gymnastics, swimming, and with at the
same time good American public school training. With the first
governess it had been different. She always had listened to Mr.
Hersland but she had a real governess being in her and she did what
this governess being in her demanded from her. She was polite and
intelligent but she had real governess being in her. After Mr.
Hersland had gotten through telling her all the advantages of
European education over American and she had politely agreed with
him, there was nothing for him to say to her. He became indifferent
later about telling this to her and so she had no existence for him
although whenever he was conscious of her he had respect for the
genuine governess being in her, for her being a thorough musician,
for her really knowing french and German.</p>

<p>Madeleine Wyman then was a good person to listen to him. Better
than the other two to him. Personally she was pleasant to him, she
was not so large as an impression personally on him of agreeable
healthy feeling as the second governess had been. She was more
satisfying as a listener to him. Not so satisfying for advising,
really she was more important to Mrs. Hersland than she was to him.
She really had more advice from Mrs. Hersland than from him. He
liked to talk to her but it was not a personal feeling. She had
understanding in her, she was young and ready to carry out his
feeling about education but really she was not very personal for
him, she was very personal for Mrs. Hersland, she was to Mrs.
Hersland a part of Mrs. Hersland's most important living. They had
then for each other these two women very important being. This is
now a history of them.</p>

<p>With Madeleine Wyman living in the same house with them, Mrs.
Hersland had in her her feeling of being to herself inside her
strongest in her whole living, stronger than later when she went to
Bridgepoint to visit her family and was like a princess to them, a
very rich woman from the far country and in her feeling for them a
part of them but to them and really to herself then not a part of
rich right living; more important than earlier when she met Mr.
Hersland and her marrying was then her important being. She had
never then at any time in her living so completely to herself then
a realization, a feeling of herself to herself, a being in herself
to her own feeling important in her being, not from doing, not from
feeling, not from being, not from having, not from anything in her
living or her being but from being to herself in herself then an
important person as she had then in her middle living with the
third governess in the house with them. Some one needed her, not
for their living or their feeling, but needed her for their
self-creation. And so, it was in her middle living with Madeleine
Wyman in the house with them that she had in her really individual
being. As I was saying the children later had a sore feeling that
Madeleine Wyman owned their mother's early living. They had a sore
feeling because they were so, cut off from part of their own being.
Madeleine Wyman made Mrs. Hersland really an attacking being and
this was the most stupid being she had in her in her living. Mrs.
Hersland then, was important to Madeleine Wyman to give to her
individual being, with her feeling and living in her being to make
for herself a being. Mrs. Hersland then had from Madeleine Wyman
individual being, from Madeleine Wyman's living her early being.
This is now again a history of them.</p>

<p>The Wyman family was foreign American. The mother was always
pretty foreign. No one of their children excepting perhaps the
second one Louise ever knew very much what their father had in him.
Their children did not really know much about what was in either of
them, the father or the mother in the house with them. The old
people were too foreign to them for them ever to really know
anything about them. The second one Louise, Madeleine was the
eldest of the children, the second one Louise was not foreign in
her being but she was in some way nearer in understanding to the
old folks who were very foreign perhaps not understanding to her
feeling, but understanding to anyone to every one who saw her with
them. There seemed more connection between her and her father and
her mother, there was not any connection to anybody's feeling
between the foreign old woman and the old man, and anything in
their living, there was not much connection to anybody's feeling
between the old man and the old woman, perhaps they were not so
very old then, they lived a long time after and so they could not
have been so very old then, there was then to everybody who saw
them not much connection between the foreign woman and the foreign
man who was a little vague to every one, there was only the
connection between that neither of them seemed to be connected with
any other one. Later when one knew the children better and still
later when no one any longer saw any of them and only remembered
them, one then could reconstruct the foreign father and mother out
of the children and so could come to an understanding of them, a
realisation that they had been alive then and human. Later then
there will be a reconstruction of them, not from any impression
from them but from what their children had in them as nature in
them and so the parents will come to be made soon to us out of the
memory of the children as later one remembered them, the children
when one no longer saw them. The mother and the father then were to
every one then disconnected from every one, a little less from the
second daughter Louise, she had some connection with them then to
every one who knew them. Later there will be more description of
this connection of hers with them. The Herslands had never then
very much impression of them, not indeed then or even later in
their living, of any of the Wyman family except Madeleine, although
they later, especially the three children and Mr. Hersland some too
then, Mrs. Hersland was weakening then and less then in everybody's
living, came to know the others of them the two sisters Louise and
Helen and the brother Frank very well in their later living. They
never however any one of them, the three Hersland children came to
any realisation of them until later they remembered them and
reconstructed them and realised them and then reconstructed and
realised the foreign parents from a reconstruction from their
reconstructed children. Every one had then when they knew them an
impression that the daughter Louise knew then what kind of woman
her mother the old foreign woman was and what a kind of a man she
had as a husband but no one ever knew how they came to have this
feeling that this Louise had such a knowledge of them, that she had
such understanding. This is now a history of the Wyman family and
the living and the being in all of the six of them, the mother and
the father and the four children, Madeleine, Louise, Frank, and
Helen. Now there will be a history of Mrs. Hersland to them. Later
there will be new history of them in the history of each one of the
three Hersland children. Now then for the six of them, the mother
and the father and the four children Madeleine and Louise and Frank
and Helen, and Mrs. Hersland and a little Mr. Hersland to them.
First there will be the impression every one had of them then and
the history of their living and then there will be a reconstruction
of the four of them from the memory of the impression of them and
then a reconstruction of the father and the mother out of the
reconstructed four children. This is now then a history of them and
of Mrs. Hersland and a little of Mr. Hersland to them. Later there
will be a history of the three Hersland children with them.</p>

<p>Madeleine Wyman stayed with the Herslands about three years and
then there was a struggle for her by her family who wanted her to
marry John Summer who wanted to marry her but was not very anxious
to have her, and she had not about it any very strong feeling but
she liked it with the Herslands as she was then living and she did
not care very much about marrying. Later she married him and he was
later then a more or less sick man with his own ways in him of
eating and doctoring. He was a rich man and her family wanted she
should marry him. She had no objection then, only she liked it so
very well being with the Herslands then, she did not want any
changing. There was no way to really convince her family that she
was very well content to stay with the Herslands then, Mrs.
Hersland tried to convince them. Once to convince them she paid
double wages to Madeleine Wyman and had Madeleine a dress made then
by Mary Maxworthing and Mabel Linker who made Mrs. Hersland's
dresses for visiting, to convince the Wyman family that Madeleine
was best off with the Herslands then and should stay with them.
There was then about three months of sharp struggle between the
Wymans and Mrs. Hersland and Madeleine and a little Mr. Hersland
with them. Then Madeleine had to leave them, the parents, that is
the whole family of them, the Wyman family, would not listen to
reason or to higher wages even or to a dress in the most
fashionable way of dressmaking. John Summer was content to have
Madeleine stay where she was then. Sometime he wanted to marry her
but there was no hurry about it for him. He had plenty of life
before him to be married in. Later Madeleine went home and later
then she married him and later then they adopted a little girl,
they could not have any children, and later then they gave up this
one, and later then he took to ways of eating and ways of doctoring
and then he was no longer working and they were rich enough then to
try every kind of way of eating and travelling and doctoring and
she was faithful to him and he died then and this was many years
after and Mrs. Hersland and Mr. Hersland had long been dead then,
but Mrs. Wyman was still living, and now there is a history of all
the Wyman family, of the six of them of the father and mother and
Madeleine and Louise and Frank and Helen and of Mrs. Hersland to
them and a little of Mr. Hersland to them. This is now the
beginning of the knowing of the Herslands and the Wymans, this is
now the beginning of Madeleine Wyman and her governessing. This is
now as remembering the Wyman family and reconstructing the children
from remembered parts of them and reconstructing the parents from
the reconstructed children, this is what the Wyman family was then.
This is now a history of them. They were, none of them, people to
make a strong impression. To every one then the second daughter was
more of the father and mother who were very foreign than the other
three children. No one knew quite why this was true of her and of
them. Every one who knew them felt it in them. This is now a
history of all six of them, of Mr. Wyman and Mrs. Wyman and
Madeleine, Louise and Frank and Helen Wyman, of the nature in each
one of them, of the living that came to each one of them.</p>

<p>The mother and the father, Mr. and Mrs. Wyman were not so old
then as they seemed to be to every one who knew them then. They
were very foreign, that made them then with grown up children a
very old man and a very old woman. They were not so very old then
for they lived a long time after, longer than Mr. and Mrs. Hersland
who were young then to them. Mr. and Mrs. Wyman were old then to
every one and mostly no one knew much about them. They were foreign
now in one's later living by remembering their children one can
reconstruct them and know what they were then. Mr. Wyman then had a
nature in him a dependent independent earthy instrument nature in
him and all being was vague in him, Mrs. Wyman had independent
dependent being and it was concentrated being but not very
efficient being, it was enough to make some attacking in her being,
it was enough to make such attacking pretty persistent and
sometimes insinuating, rarely winning but very often annoying. She
was not efficient in her being but she was fairly insistent in
attacking, sometimes insinuating almost hypocritical in her kind of
attacking but on the whole not very efficient in her living, on the
whole not very often winning. She could be persistent, insinuating,
and annoying. She had some winning in persisting with Mrs.
Hersland, her daughter for six months had double wages given to her
and a new dress made by Mabel Linker and Mary Maxworthing and then
after all she got her daughter to leave the Herslands so that later
she would marry John Summer. But all this was not really winning,
for Madeleine always intended to marry John Summer and Summer
always intended to marry her, so really all that Mrs. Wyman had as
winning in her was to be annoying to Mrs. Hersland and to give to
her a sense of struggling, and to have had her daughter Madeleine
get for six months more money then she was earning and a dress made
by Mabel Linker and Mary Maxworthing. As I was saying Mr. Wyman had
earthy dependent independent instrument nature. He was very vague
in his nature. His son Frank was like him. Madeleine in efficiency
was like her mother, in her kind of nature like her father. Louise
was like her mother altogether excepting that there was less to her
nature, less insinuating attacking in her being. Later there will
be a history of her. She had some connection, to those who knew
her, with her father and her mother. The son Frank was vague like
his father and like him in his nature, only he was younger and had
more beginning in him and more chance of later keeping going than
his father had had who was foreign. Helen was even more spread and
vague than her father ever had been, with her mother's nature in
her. Later in her living queer things happened to her. There is
always then repeating, there is always then in every one beginning
and ending, there is always then in every one stupid being, there
is always then sometime some one to every one who ever was or is or
will be living who knows the being in that one. There was then once
a whole family of them the Wyman family, the six of them, Mrs.
Wyman and Mr. Wyman and Madeleine and Louise and Frank and Helen
Wyman. There is always then sometime some one who has it in them to
envisage the whole life and being of every one. This is now then
one who remembering can reconstruct the being in Madeleine and
Louise and Frank and Helen and from them can reconstruct the being
in Mrs. Wyman and Mr. Wyman and so now there is a history of them.
There is always then as I was saying some one to know the being in
every one. Mostly every one knows the being in some one, some in
many others around them, some not in any one. There are then many
ways of knowing being in other people and this reconstruction is
one of them. There will be now then a history of the Wyman family,
of all six of them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mrs. Hersland never had any real connection with
them, any real feeling about any one of them excepting Madeleine.
Mr. Hersland had less understanding, less connection with her
being, the Hersland children had their connection with her mostly
from remembering, from their sore feeling that their parent's early
living had been cut away from them, not that any one of the three
of them had a tender feeling for their parent's early living, it
was only that it was part of their existing and not something for a
stranger to be owning. Mrs. Hersland then of all the Hersland
family had the most personal relation to Madeleine Wyman, Mr.
Hersland as I was saying liked to talk to her liked her
intelligence and her trim neat figure, liked the way she listened
when he talked, and the way she was ready to carry out ideas he
explained to her, to the three children then she was mostly then a
governess to be in the house with them. Each of them had a
different feeling about her then and that will be clearer in the
history of each one of them. They were all three then as I was
saying more of them then the poorer people living in small houses
near them than they were of their mother's or their father's living
then, than they were of rich country house living with a governess
in the house with them. What each one of them felt in their being
then about this governess living with them will come out later in
the history of each one of them. In their later early living they
came to know more of the three others Louise and Frank and Helen.
Madeleine had been married then to John Summer, the three Hersland
children never knew very certainly what then to call him or her.
They then called Louise and Frank and Helen by their first names
but they never were at ease then about what they should call John
Summer or Madeleine. They never to the end felt very certain what
was the right thing to call them. But this is all later history,
the being in Louise and Frank and Helen is all later history, no
one then in the Hersland family knew them, later the three Hersland
children knew them, Mr. and Mrs. Hersland never knew much of the
brother and sisters of Madeleine Wyman. They knew a little more of
her father and mother. Not very much though, to Mrs. Hersland and
Mr. Hersland Madeleine was apart from her family, to them her
family had really no part in her, no right to interfere with them
and with her, her marrying John Summer was to Mrs. Hersland and Mr.
Hersland more their affair than the affair of Mrs. or Mr. Wyman.
This is now a history of the trouble they all had together. Mrs.
Wyman and Mr. Wyman then to almost every one who saw them then,
hardly any one knew them then, to almost every one then they were
very foreign, they were not part of any living, they were not part
of their children's living, the children were another generation
and American. To every one there was some connection between Louise
and them, not that she was foreign but she was so clearly connected
in kind with her mother's being that being young and of another
generation and a part of American and not foreign being and a part
of her sister's and her brother's living was not enough to cut her
off from being part of the being her mother and her father too had
in them. This was always true in her being and every one who knew
them the Wyman family at any time felt this in them, though always
to every one Louise was part of the younger American generation.
Madeleine Wyman was the last one of the three governesses the
Herslands had had in the house with them in their middle living in
that part of Gossols where no other rich people were living. When
Madeleine Wyman was with them, then in the middle living of Mr.
Hersland and Mrs. Hersland, Mrs. Hersland had in her her most
important being, she had in her then her completest feeling of
being herself inside her to her being. She had this in her from her
relation to Madeleine Wyman. Madeleine was twenty-four then. She
stayed with the Herslands two years, two years after, she married
John Summer. Then she went away to another town with him and she
came to Gossols sometimes and then she would see Mrs. Hersland.
Later then she went travelling to live again the early being of Mr.
and Mrs. Hersland which was her possession. Travelling, eastern
living had for her this meaning, she was then again living the
early life of Mrs. Hersland and Mr. Hersland then. Later Mrs.
Hersland was weakening and later she died and then when Madeleine
Summer met the young Hersland people she told them what their
mother had been, she told them what travelling and eastern living
had meant to her, Madeleine, it had meant the re-living of their
mother's early living, of their mother's and their father's early
being. Then later John Summer had queer notions of eating and much
later he died and Madeleine went to live with her sisters and her
brother, and mother who was not dead yet then. Sometime there will
be a complete history of Madeleine Wyman's married living, it will
be very interesting. Sometime there will be then a complete history
of her being and her living and the living and being of all six of
them, the Wyman family. This will be such a history in the long
histories of each one of the three Hersland children. Now there is
to be only a little suggesting of the being in each one. Now
Madeleine has just come to be a governess to the Hersland family to
live with them in that part of Gossols where no rich people were
living.</p>

<p>Madeleine Wyman had had a pretty good education. She knew french
and German, not as the first governess the Herslands had had knew
them, but well enough to teach them. She was not a musician but she
knew enough music to oversee the Hersland children's practising,
she knew enough music to teach music when there were music lessons
to be given. She had a good enough English education, she had a
good enough American governess training. She and her younger sister
Helen were the only ones of her family who had had much education.
Helen was more modern than Madeleine in her feeling. She was more
modern in using her education in her living and in her feeling,
later when Helen Wyman came to know the Hersland young people she
was more of them than any of her family had been for she was more
modern, not more American perhaps but really more modern, anyway
more of them, the Hersland children then at the ending of their
first beginning living, than Madeleine or Louise or Frank even ever
were of their generation. They had not many friends then the Wyman
family. Frank and Helen Wyman were the first of their family to
have friends of people around them. The others of the Wyman family
had never been of any generation and so they had not friends of any
of them who were of their generation.</p>

<p>There were then in the Wyman family, six of them; the mother and
father and Madeleine and Louise and Frank and Helen. The mother
Mrs. Wyman had her nature in her. The second daughter Louise and
the youngest daughter Helen were of her. The father Mr. Wyman had
his nature, the son Frank and the eldest daughter Madeleine were of
this nature.</p>

<p>The youngest daughter Helen was all spread and all vague in her
nature. She had a good education for she was interested in
studying, she was almost interested in writing. She was not so much
interested in teaching but teaching was to be her occupation. As a
matter of fact she never did much teaching. She did a little
teaching but somehow the Wyman family always managed to have enough
money to go on living, the father with his book-keeping, the
daughter Madeleine first with governessing and then with marrying a
rich man always could help them, later, much later, after trying
many things Frank Wyman became a nurseryman and with Louise to help
him and much later with Madeleine to help him he always kept going,
he even took to marrying and having children and with plenty of
help around him he always managed to keep going. So as I was saying
Helen really never did much teaching although this was intended to
be her occupation. There was no opening then for a girl like Helen
except teaching, as I was saying she was almost interested in
writing but this was never active enough inside her to start her
going, just active enough inside her to make her more modern than
her sister Madeleine who was the other one in the family who had
had education. So then Helen was all spread and all vague in her
independent dependent nature, but people who knew her had a
friendly feeling for her. She was more of them the people who came
to know them the Wyman family, than any other one of them. The son
Frank was in that respect a little like her. The two youngest then
Frank and Helen were more of their generation than Louise and
Madeleine ever had been of the generation around them. So then
Helen had vagueness in her like her father, she was spread out more
inside her than any other of the Wyman family, she had independent
dependent being in her, it was mostly as dependent being in her, it
was all spread and all vague in her this being in her. As I was
saying she never did much teaching though this was to be the end of
her education. As I was saying she came almost to the point of
being interested in writing but it remained as vague and spread out
as her being, it never came to any thing. Later there was marrying
in her living and that was a very strange proceeding. Later in the
history of the Hersland children there will be a history of the
marrying of Helen which as I was saying was a very strange
proceeding.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyman then had her nature in her. The second daughter
Louise and the youngest daughter Helen were of her. The father Mr.
Wyman had his nature, the son Frank and the eldest daughter
Madeleine were of this nature.</p>

<p>The youngest daughter Helen was all spread and all vague in her
nature.</p>

<p>The second daughter Louise was almost as concentrated as her
mother but there was less to her nature. There was about as much
efficient living in her but there was not any insinuating
attacking, her attacking was more a steady pushing. It came to
about the same thing as efficient being, it made her less
interesting, less menacing, more agreeable to be knowing. It came
to about the same amount of efficiency in her nature as her mother
had in her and more than that in any of the rest of the Wyman
family.</p>

<p>The important things in her living were the marrying, first of
Madeleine, later the strange marrying of Helen and then the taking
charge of her, later the helping her brother in his business of
nurseryman; the keeping everything going in the later Wyman living
when old Mrs. Wyman's methods had no more efficiency for their
living. And so she succeeded to her mother's living, she never was
married, she never bore children, as I was saying she was of her
mother's being but there was less to her nature, there was less
variety in her when she was younger, when she was in her middle
living, when she was older. There was less variety to her, there
was no insinuating attacking to her, there was steady shoving in
her that made up in her for any less active attacking there was in
her than there was in her mother. She was a drier person than her
mother. There was very little change in her, she always had much
the same being in her. Her being part of the mother and father's
being, that which every one who knew her felt in her was never
important to her. To herself inside her she was not more part of
her mother and father than were her sisters and her brother. To
herself she was part of the livings of her sisters and her brother,
that was important being in her, being part of the being of her
mother and father was not important being to her. She did not know
it in her that she was nearer them than were her sisters and her
brother. If she had known it she would not have liked it inside
her. Important being in her to herself inside her was being part of
the living and the being of her sisters and her brother. It was the
marrying of her sisters and the business of her brother that were
important to her not the being and the living in her father and her
mother. She was to herself then strongly of the being of her
sisters and her brother. Her father and her mother were not to her
very important inside her. Later then in the histories of her
sisters and her brother, in the description of her mother and her
father there will be more history of her.</p>

<p>The son Frank was almost as vague in his nature as his
father.</p>

<p>He was tall then and had a long head and thick hair and at that
time he had mild humor in him. He could make jokes at children,
give him time he could make jokes at girls and at women. He was not
slow but he was not very decided inside him. He was vague inside
him as his father was inside him but he was younger then and
pleasanter, he was blonder, and milder in manner than his father,
but his father was much older and had dried down and he was not
really quicker it was only that there was a tender youthful being
in the son that threw over him a glamor of being slower and
pleasanter than his father. The father was darker and drier and
seemed to be quicker. Really they had about the same nature, the
two of them, neither of them had an efficient nature. The son had
an easier life because he had his sisters, and his wife, later.
When he married her she was not stronger in her nature than he was
in his nature, but he had the start of her by having his sisters
around her. He always all through his living was tall and slow and
pleasant and mildly joking and not lazy and not active either and
there was always the appearance as if his women, Louise and
Madeleine and his wife and Helen were holding him up so that he
would keep on standing. His mother had never done this for him.
While she was directing the family he had been drifting. He had
tried one way of earning a living and then another way and then
nothing. It was not till later that he became a nurseryman with
women around him to support him. So Frank had a pleasant enough
life all his living and successful enough life in his living. He
and his father, as I was saying, were both of them alike in this
nature. They both had resistance enough to keep going, the father
in his book-keeping, with a wife and family around him that he felt
only enough to awaken in him some resisting; the son with enough
resistance in him to have his women keep on holding him up while he
pleasantly and vaguely kept on living. This then is a history of
the two of them. Sometime perhaps there will be more understanding
of the nature in the two of them.</p>

<p>The mother Mrs. Wyman had her nature in her. The second daughter
Louise and the youngest daughter Helen were of her. The father Mr.
Wyman had his nature. The son Frank and the eldest daughter
Madeleine were of this nature. In the eldest daughter the nature of
the father was more concentrated to make her. It did not make her
really an efficient nature. She really had resistance in her.</p>

<p>Madeleine Wyman had had a pretty good education. She knew french
and German well enough to teach them. She knew enough music to
teach music when there were music lessons to be given. She had had
a good enough education. She had intelligence to listen with
understanding to Mr. Hersland's talking. She had a kind of interest
in his theories of education. She tried to put them into execution.
This is now a little description of them.</p>

<p>She was then different from the first governess who was a real
European governess and a musician, she was different from the
second governess who had known nothing. She came to the Herslands
in answer to an advertisement and Mr. Hersland had been pleased
with her. The three Hersland children then were having their
regular public school living, they had then all the feeling of
country children. They had too then every kind of fancy education
anything that their father could think would be good for them.</p>

<p>The third governess was really then only to keep them up in
music practising and a little in french and German, mostly then
just to be in the house with them. Mr. Hersland was just then
deciding that what the children needed was to be kept going and
Madeleine Wyman had enough education in every direction to keep
them going. Then too, they all of them had the feeling of needing a
governess in the house with them. Mrs. Hersland liked her, Mr.
Hersland took less interest in engaging her than he had with the
first or second one. She came then to be a governess to them
because they still had a feeling that the children ought to have
some one and Mrs. Hersland liked her and Mr. Hersland had not much
interest just then in education. Soon though he began to talk to
her about what he wanted her to do for each one of the three of
them and what he thought was the right kind of education for
children and the difference between European and American
education.</p>

<p>As I was saying Madeleine was like her father in her nature but
this was much more concentrated in her than it was in her father or
her brother, it was almost as concentrated as their kind of nature
was in her mother and her sister Louise. It did not make her a
really efficient nature but it gave real resistance inside her and
it gave her a certain power with those whose ideas she tried to
realise for them. This was the case with Mr. Hersland. It gave her
power when she was part of some one's living as with Mrs. Hersland.
It did not give her power in teaching because in educating she
tried attacking and with this, for her, there was no succeeding so
she had never any real power with any one of the three
children.</p>

<p>Later she was married to John Summer. Later they had for a
little while an adopted daughter. Madeleine had not wanted her, it
was Summer who very much wanted children and did not seem to be
able to have any of his own who insisted upon choosing and adopting
one. They did not keep her long for soon they took to travelling
and Madeleine had not wanted to have her and so they sent her back
to the home from where they had gotten her. Madeleine as I was
saying had not really an efficient nature, she had not much
influence on any one near her. She had none on the adopted child
although she nagged her as her mother had done when she had brought
up her children, but it was as attacking in Madeleine for she had
not wanted the child with her. And so what strength was in her was
in living in other people's lives, not in attacking or even really
in resisting. With her husband she had no influence, for she had
not a feeling of living in him as she had with Mrs. Hersland and
with Mr. David Hersland, and Mrs. Hersland's early living, with her
husband she was a good enough woman, a wife to travel with him, to
induce him to give up business and to take to travelling, but she
had no influence with him in the things that were his living, his
ideas of eating, of doctoring, of wearing warm clothing. He was a
man who had these things in him as a sad religion. Later he died
for them. Later there will be much history of him, and his
doctoring, and later his dying, and always his strong feeling for
ways of eating, for ways of doctoring, for ways of digesting.
Madeleine then could keep him travelling, she could induce him to
quit business living, she could make it that the adopted child no
longer lived with them, she had really had no power in him, she had
really no efficient being. She had it in her later to give a sore
feeling to the Hersland children by to them owning the father and
the mother. Earlier when she was a governess to them Martha
sometimes had had a little feeling against her when Madeleine tried
to carry out Mr. Hersland's theories of education. The Hersland
children were not accustomed to having any one really try to be
systematic in such realisation, they were accustomed to have only
the pleasant new beginnings of new ways of learning and of out of
door living. As I say Martha and sometimes a little David did not
like her way of interfering with them, Alfred had not any such
reason for a feeling for he was older than David, and a boy, not a
girl like Martha, and so Madeleine had nothing really to do with
him, Martha then, and a little David then, did not like her way of
interfering with them, then they had no feeling about her being
with their father and their mother, they really never cared very
much then about anything going on in the house with them. They were
then all three of them, the Hersland children, more of them, the
poorer people who lived in the small houses near them than they
were of their father's or their mother's living then. Mr.
Hersland's living just then was the beginning of the middle living
in his great fortune, the beginning of a struggling to resist a
beginning of an ending to his fortune. The beginning of resisting
was just then dimly beginning in him, he had not just then such a
keen feeling about education. He talked to Madeleine Wyman then
about his theories of education but they were not then so live in
him as they had been. She tried to realise them for him, that to
the children was interfering, that, to him, was not really
interesting. He took less and less interest in the children just
then excepting when they came up against him. That was then their
only existing, for him. Madeleine was conscientious in trying to
realise the ideas she knew he had in him. This as I was saying was
to Martha and a little to young David, interfering. Later Madeleine
had her own trouble in her and the children then went on with their
living as was natural to them, having their regular public school
living, having all the feeling of country children, having various
kinds of fancy education and outdoor living, being of them the poor
people near them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland then had in her her time of being most herself to
herself in her feeling. Her important being was then existing from
Madeleine Wyman's living in her being, being in her early living,
later needing protection against her parents' nagging, needing to
be held against them by extra wages which Mrs. Hersland induced Mr.
Hersland to give her and a dress made by Mary Maxworthing and Mabel
Linker.</p>

<p>Later then there will be more description of Mr. Hersland and
his ideas on education, later then in the history of each one of
the Hersland children there will be a description of Madeleine
Wyman's effort to realise Mr. Hersland's ideas of education. Now
there is to be a description of Madeleine Wyman and Mrs. Hersland
and the important feeling in her, and the trying of Mr. and Mrs.
Wyman to make Madeleine leave her, and then the leaving of
Madeleine and her later marrying John Summer. The mother Mrs. Wyman
had independent dependent nature in her. The second daughter Louise
and the youngest daughter Helen were of her. The father Mr. Wyman
had dependent independent earthy instrument nature, the son Frank
and the eldest daughter Madeleine were of this nature. The youngest
daughter Helen was all spread and all vague in her independent
dependent nature, more spread and vague in her nature, more spread
and more vague in her nature than her father was in his nature. The
second daughter Louise was almost as concentrated as he mother but
there was less to her nature. The son Frank was almost a vague in
his nature as his father. Dependent independent instrument nature
was concentrated to make the eldest daughter, Madeleine Wyman, but
it did not make of her really an efficient nature. She had about
the same concentration in her as her mother and her sister Louise
had in their nature. There was real resisting in her, there was
some power in her, there was not very much efficiency in her, there
was about the same in her as there was in her sister Louise and in
her mother. In her it was as dependent independent instrument
being, in them as independent dependent being.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland had as her being dependent independent gentle
nature with some real resisting in her. Stupid being in her was
attacking. Having the children as part of her, having a little
resisting to her husband inside her, in her was her winning nature.
Resisting winning was in her, in her relation to Mr. Hersland, to
attract him, and so to come to be a little a real thing, inside
him. Being part of them was her being with her children. She was of
them as if they were still a physical part of her. Later they were
big around her and she was lost among them and she had weakening
inside her. Now they were really not of her, they were more of them
the poor people around them than they were of their mother's living
then, though they were to her all there ever was of being in her.
Now her living was Madeleine Wyman's living in her and later, she
and Madeleine resisting to the old Wyman's, Mr. and Mrs. Wyman's
trying, by attacking. As I was saying attacking was in Mrs.
Hersland stupid being. As I was saying this was in her in her
resisting Mr. and Mrs. Wyman. This was in her sometimes with
servant girls and their leaving, as I was saying earlier. It was in
her most in her defending Madeleine Wyman against Mr. and Mrs.
Wyman's trying to make Madeleine leave her.</p>

<p>Madeleine Wyman then as I was saying had come to be governess to
the Herslands because a governess in the house with them had come
to be a habit in the family living. They had had two of them, the
first had left them to leave America, the second had married, and
now it was natural to have a third one. This third one was the
first one who was really important to Mrs. Hersland. Mr. Hersland
found some important being in all three of them, they were like
everything around him, part of him, part of the world around him,
part of the beginning always in him. The second one had made more
impression on him, she was a healthy woman, he liked to have a
feeling of having her in the house with them. The first one had
been mostly an ideal to him. The last one Madeleine, was pleasant
to have listening to him, she had a neat figure, she was
intelligent in listening, he had less active impression from her
than he had from the one before her. None of them then, the first
or second or third governess were really important then to the
three Hersland children, they had existence for them, sometimes
they interfered with them, sometimes they were pleasant to have in
the house with them, but mostly they were not then any one of the
three of them very important to the three children. Later this will
come clearer, later in the long histories of each one of the three
Hersland children which will now soon be commencing. First there
will be a long history of Martha, then of Alfred, and then of young
David, and of all of them together and of every one who ever came
to know them. Before then there must be some more history of Mrs.
Hersland and the important feeling in her that came to her from
having Madeleine Wyman as governess in the house with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland as I was saying had in her then completely in her
being the feeling of rich country house living, with servants and a
governess and a seamstress in the house with them and not cut off
from right rich living, although really doing very little visiting.
To herself then, she and her husband and her children were part of
right rich being, not doing much visiting, not needing to see much
of richer people but always of them. To herself she was cut off
from her family being and from accustomed living, to herself the
other rich people in Gossols who were living there rich right
living were too cut off from their family living, from their
accustomed being. She was to herself leading rich country house
living, it was a natural living to her being, it was all of her
middle living, it was all her important living and her children's
being, it was the natural living to her, to herself then she was
leading rich right living, to herself then she was cut off from her
family living, from eastern travelling. Madeleine Wyman then lived
in Mrs. Hersland's feeling.</p>

<p>In Mr. Hersland, his early living was not, then in his middle
living, in him, in his feeling. It was in him as part of him, it
came out of him sometimes in talking, it was not in him then in his
middle living nor in his later living, it was not in him then in
his feeling. It was not important to him excepting as so much
talking coming out of him. That was all the meaning his early
living had in him to him and to every one who knew him. Even to
Madeleine Wyman who lived in the early living of Mr. and Mrs.
Hersland it was not as Mr. Hersland's early living that it was
important to her being, it was as Mr. and Mrs. Hersland's early
living that it made its impression. As I was saying it was a
different matter to Mrs. Hersland who was to herself cut off from
her family living. To Mr. Hersland eastern living was a past part
of him, it was in him as being little as a baby or a child was in
him, it was not something still existing cut off from him, it was
part of him and not in his feeling. He had in him in his feeling,
his beginning, his having it in him to be as big as all the world
around him. In Mrs. Hersland then it was a different thing, her
early living was a continuous living that was going on then and she
was cutoff from it, to her feeling. When she later went to visit
them her family who were still living in Bridgepoint in their
natural way of living, she was still then cut off from them, she
was of them but a princess to them, she was of them but a stranger
to them with a husband and children who had not in any way any
connection with them, she was of them but cut off from them by her
Gossols living which was a different way of being though it was not
a living that to herself was cut off from rich right being.</p>

<p>Madeleine Wyman then had in her the feeling of the early living
of Mr. and Mrs. Hersland and this all her later life was an
important part of her being and her feeling. She had this in her
always as a possession, she had it in her more than Mr. or Mrs.
Hersland had it in them, she had it in her as much as Mrs. Hersland
had it in her talking, she had it in her more than Mrs. Hersland
had it as a feeling, her having it in her gave to Mrs. Hersland her
important feeling of herself inside her. Mrs. Hersland could never
have had this in her from her own feeling, from her own talking of
her early living, she would only have it in her from Madeleine
Wyman having this as a possession.</p>

<p>It is clear then, Mr. Hersland had not in him any feeling of his
early living, it was part of him because it had happened to him, it
came out of him sometimes as bragging, sometimes as illustration,
sometimes as moralising, but it was not really ever then in him in
his middle or in his later living as feeling. It was in him only as
having happened to him.</p>

<p>It is clear then that Mrs. Hersland had in her early living in
her as something that was in her, in her middle living, as part of
her feeling. Really, her being was her children and her husband and
her country house living. To herself in her feeling she was never
cut off from right rich living, really she was then not at all of
such living, later when she met any of such of them she was cut off
from them, to herself then it was not that she was cut off from
right rich living, to herself then it was a little then that she
was cut off from her family living and eastern travelling and
visiting. This was stronger in her from Madeleine Wyman. It always
had been all through her Gossols living, a little in her. It had
not, before Madeleine Wyman was in the habit of listening to her,
it had not been in her, a conscious feeling. Later then it was more
consciously in her, it was really then not an important part of her
being, it was really then an important part of her feeling herself
inside her in her being. Her feeling herself inside her in her
feeling was not an important part of her being, her feeling herself
inside her to herself from her family being, from her children, a
little from her husband, was the important being in her. Feeling
herself to herself inside her was not really ever very important
being in her. Feeling herself to herself inside her from her
talking to Madeleine Wyman, from her defending her against her
nagging father and mother was not really important being in her,
feeling herself to herself inside her from having in her as part of
her her family living, her husband and her children, her country
house living, was important being in her.</p>

<p>As I was saying his early living sometimes came out of Mr.
Hersland as talking. Mrs. Hersland's early living and her early
living with her husband sometimes came out of her as talking, very
often, to Madeleine Wyman in the house with her. It was very
different in the two of them, in Mr. and in Mrs. Hersland.</p>

<p>As I was saying it came out of him, sometimes as bragging,
sometimes as illustration, sometimes as moralising, sometimes as
just talking, but it was not in him as feeling, it was not to him
really then in his middle living an important part of his being. It
was as I was saying early living to him, it had no more meaning
than that in him.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Hersland it was in her as feeling, not really as very
important feeling, but it had really meaning in her as feeling. It
came out of her in talking, it had then to her real meaning, more
even than it had to her feeling.</p>

<p>She had always talked some about her early living, when she was
living at the hotel sometimes with Sophie Shilling, sometimes when
she was visiting she would speak of eastern living to other ones in
right rich living who had back of them too early eastern living,
sometimes she told stories of it to her children, it was in her a
little then as feeling, in the beginning in the hotel living it was
in her fairly strongly as a feeling, not really a lonesome feeling,
her children, her husband, Sophie Shilling, and Sophie's sister,
Sophie's mother were then all the feeling really in her but she had
then still a little in her a feeling of her early living and
eastern travelling. As I was saying she would speak then of it but
it did not then make her even a little important to herself inside
her. This came to her later, this came to her when she told it over
and over to Madeleine Wyman who was living then the complete being
of Mr. and Mrs. Hersland in their early living. It came then to be
in Mrs. Hersland her feeling of herself to herself in her feeling.
This was not in her resisting or yielding, it was not like her
being with her husband or her having anger in her or being a part
of the children around her, it was in her like her being with the
servants and seamstresses and poor people near her, being of them
and above them, it was being herself inside her to her. It was the
important being of herself to herself inside her it was not really
the important being in her, important being in her really was
herself as part of her family, as resisting to her husband or
yielding in him, as being part of her children, as being part of
rich right living.</p>

<p>As I was saying those having in them dependent independent being
have in them resisting as their way of winning fighting. Resisting
though is not their only way of fighting they can have yielding
winning in them. Resisting and yielding then are not in them stupid
being. Mrs. Hersland had in her dependent independent being.
Madeleine Wyman had in her dependent independent being. Mrs.
Hersland then had in her resisting and yielding to give her
winning. Madeleine Wyman then had in her resisting and yielding to
give her winning. Resisting and yielding then in both of them was
not stupid being in them. Attacking then for both of them was
stupid being. This is now a description of the different ways these
things came out in them.</p>

<p>There is as I was saying two kinds of being, independent
dependent, dependent independent. Resisting is to the dependent
independent the natural way of fighting. Those then who have in
them dependent independent being as the bottom of them have
resisting in them as their natural way of fighting. Many of them
have very little fighting in their living. This was true of both of
them, Mrs. Hersland and Madeleine who both had dependent
independent nature in them.</p>

<p>Resisting fighting is for these then who have dependent
independent being in them not their only way of winning. They can
have yielding and sensitive being and instrument being in them,
sometimes for winning just to keep going, sometimes for winning to
subdue some one near them. Mrs. Hersland and Madeleine Wyman were
then for a while then closely in each others living, Madeleine
always then all the rest of her living was in her being in Mrs.
Hersland's living. In Mrs. Hersland later there was weakening, she
had never had Madeleine Wyman in her as real being. In Mrs.
Hersland, real being was rich right living, her Bridgepoint family
living and her marrying, and her country house living and her
children. Later in her living she was weakening inside her, she was
scared then, her children were big around her and outside her,
trouble was coming then, the country house living was ending and
often then Mr. Hersland forgot her as being and later then she died
away from among them and they soon, all of them then, lost
remembering her among them. So then this was real being in her this
was really being herself inside her. This was a real history in
her. Her early living, later when she talked so much about it to
Madeleine Wyman it was real in her but it was important to her then
more than it really was as being in her. It was sentimental feeling
and romantic feeling in her, it was not real being in her. To
Madeleine Wyman, this early living of Mrs. Hersland was being, it
was real being inside her, inside in Madeleine Wyman, it was not
sentimental and romantic in her, it was real being in her. It was a
little too then real being in Mrs. Hersland but in talking it came
to be to her feeling more important than it was then in her being.
This was the difference then between them. Mrs. Hersland then had a
real being from her early living but it was not, later then, so
important to her being or her feeling as in her talking of it to
Madeleine Wyman she made it come to be in her Mrs. Hersland's
feeling. Later more and more when she was weakening, it was all
fainter and fainter in her. In Madeleine Wyman, Mrs. Hersland and
Mrs. Hersland's early living was real being. It came to be always
stronger in Madeleine Wyman always more and more a part of her
being, Mrs. Hersland and Mr. Hersland and their early living. Later
the Hersland children had a sore feeling at her having such
possession.</p>

<p>To begin again then with dependent independent nature, with
resisting being, with sensitive being. To begin again then with
dependent independent nature, with earthy instrument being, with
little or much resisting, with little or much yielding, with little
or much winning.</p>

<p>To begin again then with dependent independent nature, with
resisting being, with sensitive being. To begin again then with
dependent independent nature, with earthy instrument being, with
little or much resisting, with little or much yielding, with little
or much winning.</p>

<p>Neither Madeleine Wyman nor Mrs. Hersland had in them really
efficient being. They both had in them some resisting fighting,
some yielding winning. It showed in the two of them in very
different fashion. Madeleine had in her really more instrument
being than Mrs. Hersland had in her. Mrs. Hersland had in her more
sensitive earthy being than Madeleine Wyman. Neither the one nor
the other had really an efficient nature. They were very different
from each other. Madeleine was drier and had more energy in her,
not enough to carry her, to make for herself a living in her, but
enough to make her want to listen and answer, and to carry into
action Mr. Hersland's talking about education, enough to make her
have later Mr. and Mrs. Hersland as a possession, enough to make
her then have Mr. and Mrs. Hersland's early living a part then of
her being. Mrs. Hersland had enough energy in her to be a mother,
to be a little resisting to her husband in their beginning, to have
the dignity in her of country house living and Bridgepoint Hissen
family being, she had her own being in her, her children were a
part of her, she had a sensitive and later a scared weakening being
in her, she could have anger in her and a sharp indignant injured
feeling, she had not instrument being in her. Later this will be
clearer. More and more then it will be clearer the difference
between the being in Madeleine Wyman and in her. They both had in
them dependent independent being, it was in them in different
fashion, Madeleine had in her instrument being, Mrs. Hersland had
not in her such being, she had yielding in her but that was to
loving in marrying, yielding in her to the being that was part of
her as in her children and her sisters and her brothers and her
mother and her father. She had not instrument nature, she had not
any living in any being that was not in her a part of her. She was
different then from Madeleine Wyman.</p>

<p>Neither the one nor the other of them had in them really
efficient being. This came out more and more in them in their later
living. This came out in them in their resisting to the trying of
the Wyman family when these wanted Madeleine to marry John
Summer.</p>

<p>As I was saying attacking in Mrs. Hersland was stupid being. It
was in her when she had inside her her feeling of herself to
herself in her, when she was resisting the Wyman family about
Madeleine. In Madeleine, attacking was stupid being but she was
then not showing such being, she had no attacking with which to
resist her family's trying. Stupid being then was in her as
attacking but it showed then only in her handling of children.
Later she showed it with her husband, later when she had really no
power over John Summer. She could sometimes stop him in business or
in adopting a daughter, she could never really have any effect
inside him. Now, then, stupid being as I was saying was in Mrs.
Hersland's attacking to stop the Wyman trying, the giving Madeleine
double wages and a dress made by Mabel Linker and Mary Maxworthing.
Then Madeleine was not attacking, was not having stupid being
excepting with the children in trying to carry out Mr. Hersland's
ideas for them. Mostly then she had strongly in her instrument
being. She was living in Mrs. Hersland's and in Mr. Hersland's
being. The Wyman family then the mother and the father with their
children as a background to make a more solid seeming, won out then
with trying, Madeleine went back to them and later married John
Summer. She really had no objection to marrying John Summer, she
did not want to leave the Hersland family, she was willing to marry
John Summer later.</p>

<p>In all of them who have dependent independent nature in them,
there is resisting and yielding and stupid being as attacking.
Sometime there will have been written a history of many of them as
by repeating it comes out of them. Sometime some one will know the
amount of resisting, yielding and stupid acting there is in every
one who ever has or has had or will have dependent independent
being in them. Some have less, some have more of one or the other
of these things in them, in some it changes in them in the
different parts of their living, in the way they have in them
excitement or nervous or quiet or melancholy or happy or contented
or diseased or healthful or hungry or thirsty or tired or satisfied
being in them. Mrs. Hersland then had stupid attacking being mostly
in her when she was having important feeling of herself inside her
with a servant or a governess or a seamstress or, for her, poor
people to arouse it in her and to give to her indignant and injured
feeling inside her. This then was strongest in her when Madeleine
Wyman was with her, when she was making to herself a being by
always telling of her early living, when she was resisting for
Madeleine the Wyman family's trying, when she was making Mr.
Hersland pay money for her attacking fighting. This then now is
always getting clearer.</p>

<p>To begin again then with the dependent independent being in Mrs.
Hersland.</p>

<p>It is interesting in each one, the success and failure, that one
has in living. Every one has their own nature in them. This comes
out of them as repeating. This comes out of them as making success
or failure in their living. Mrs. Hersland and Madeleine Wyman had
not in them either of them very efficient being, they had not
success or failure in living, they went on well enough both of them
from their beginning to their ending. This is now to be a history
of each one of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland then had in her dependent independent being. She
did not have in her much stupid being. That was in her only as
attacking and that was in her sometimes when a servant or a
seamstress or a governess or some one, living in a small house near
them, did something that was to her not right for them to be doing,
when such a one was ungrateful or unpleasant to her. Then she could
have a sharp angry feeling in her, then she could have a hurt or
injured, or hurt and injured feeling in her, then she would do
something for such a one to show such a one that if they demanded
something from her that it was not right that they should demand
from her she would give them more than they had asked of her. This
was angry and injured feeling in her. As I was saying this could be
in her from a servant or governess or seamstress or people living
in small houses near her. In her earlier living this could be in
her from people she knew as friends to her or of her family, she
could then in her early living sometimes have it in her from a
sister or a brother, but in her later living in that part of
Gossols where no other rich people were living this feeling in her
came to her only from servants or governesses or seamstresses or
store-keepers or dependents in the small houses near her. She could
have then a feeling of herself inside her. This was in her as a
gentle dignity in her, as having as a part of her her early living,
her country house being, her husband and her children. She could
have then a feeling of herself inside her from angry or injured
feeling in her, she could have a feeling of herself inside her from
Madeleine Wyman's having her Mrs. Hersland's being as part of her.
So then Mrs. Hersland had in her in living a sense of herself
inside her. This was most active in her when Madeleine Wyman was
living in the house with her.</p>

<p>Slowly there is building up a solid structure of the two
different kinds of nature. Later any one who looks at any one will
see the nature in them. Sometime then there will be a history of
every one. As I was saying Mrs. Hersland and Madeleine Wyman had
neither of them a very efficient nature. They went on well enough
both of them from their beginning to their ending. It must be clear
soon the nature in the two of them and the difference between them.
They had both of them dependent independent nature in them.
Madeleine had an instrument nature and stupid being as attacking in
her. This is now a history of her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyman the mother of Madeleine was a foreign American and
always remained very foreign, not to herself but to every one who
came to know them the Wyman family in their American living, Mrs.
Wyman had independent dependent nature in her. She had in her not
very efficient being, about as efficient being as Madeleine, enough
to bring Madeleine away from Mrs. Hersland by her trying, enough to
have Madeleine later married to John Summer, enough to keep her
family going, but none of these were very hard things to be doing,
she had not in her a very efficient nature. She had in her about
the same efficiency as Madeleine had in her and that will later
come to be clearer. She had in her about the same efficiency that
her second daughter Louise had in her, Mrs. Wyman had more variety
to her nature than her daughter Louise, she had about as much
variety in her nature, Mrs. Wyman, as her daughter Madeleine had in
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyman then had in her independent dependent nature. The
second daughter Louise and the youngest daughter Helen were of her
as to nature, they had in them both, independent dependent nature.
The daughter Louise had about as much efficiency in her as her
mother, she had less variety to her nature, she had no liveliness
of cringing in her as had her mother, independence and dependence
in the daughter were solid substances inside her, in the mother
were more lively and more cringing and more attacking and more
lively in their changing. In the youngest daughter Helen there was
independent dependent nature but this nature was in her as his
nature was in her father, vague and uncertain and wide, and without
ever any accentuation. Mrs. Wyman then had independent dependent
nature in her. The second daughter Louise and the youngest daughter
Helen were of her in their nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyman was a foreign American like Mrs. Wyman but nobody felt
it very much about him whether he was always foreign, he was
foreign, it was not very important to any one excepting his wife
and children. He had a dryness of being in him like that in the
second Wyman daughter Louise, he had a vagueness in him like that
in the youngest daughter Helen, Mr. Wyman then had in him dependent
independent nature, the son Frank and the eldest daughter Madeleine
were of this nature. The son Frank was like his father only he was
always all his life fresher and younger. He had it in him always to
have fresher and younger being in him than his father had had in
living. He had it in him, the son Frank, with his fresher, younger
being to have people like to take care of him, his sister Louise
and his sister Madeleine and later his wife and later all three of
them with the youngest sister Helen hanging on the outside of them,
did this for him. There was in him all through his living fresher
and younger being than his father had ever had in him. The eldest
daughter Madeleine had in her nature like her father. It was not so
earthy in her as it was in her father and her brother. It was not
as vague in her as it was in her father, it was never in her so
young and so fresh as it was in her brother, it was about as
various and as efficient in her as her mother's nature was in her,
it was not as solid in her as the nature in her was in her sister
Louise, it had in her a little of the dryness that his nature had
in her father, the variety and the efficiency that her nature had
in her mother. This makes her clearer and now for a history of
her.</p>

<p>All four of the Wyman children were born and brought up
American. Madeleine had had a governess training. It was really a
little more foreign than the training of the other three children.
Louise in her training was between Madeleine, and Frank and Helen,
these last two being entirely American, being entirely of their
American generation in education and feeling. Madeleine was still a
little foreign, Louise was between them but education was not
really important in her being. She was to be all through her living
important in running the family living, in helping and protecting
Frank, and then Helen, then Madeleine in her marrying, then Frank
in his business of being a nurseryman, then Helen after she came
back out of her strange marriage experience back to them, and then
Madeleine when she too came back to them with John Summer after
their travelling when John Summer was dying of queer ways in
eating. Always then she was of the living her brother and sisters
had in them. She was not an instrument nature for she was an
under-pinning always to them but all her living was her brother's
and sisters' living and being.</p>

<p>Madeleine then had lingering in her a little, being foreign. She
was American, her brother and sisters were American and her father
and mother, in their feeling. They were all of them American, the
mother and father were very foreign to every one that came to know
them, Madeleine had lingering in her, a little, being foreign,
Louise was very American in her feeling, Frank and Helen were
simply American. Madeleine and Helen had most of the education,
Helen was almost literary in her feeling, Madeleine had had a
pretty good education for American governessing. She knew french
and German, not as the first governess the Herslands had had knew
them but well enough to teach them and talk french and German with
the children when parents insisted that there should be talking of
french or German. She knew then enough french to teach it to
children, enough German to teach it and talk it and to listen with
intelligence to Mr. Hersland's explanation of the fine qualities in
foreign education. She was not a musician, she knew enough music to
oversee the Hersland children's practising, for they had then, that
was their father's theory for them, real musicians to teach them,
she knew enough music to teach music when there were music lessons
to be given, when parents had notions not so completed about
education as the Herslands had then. She had a good enough English
education, she was not like her sister Helen literary in her
feeling, she had in short a good enough American governess
training.</p>

<p>Madeleine Wyman came to be a governess to the Herslands, for the
Herslands had not come yet to the understanding that for their then
family living a governess was not any particular use to them. The
children were having then their regular public school living, they
had then all the feeling of country children, they had freedom in
coming and going, they were then as I was saying more of them the
people around them than they were of the family living then though
they were then the large part of the family being. They had then
their regular public school living, they had then too every kind of
fancy education that their father could think would be good for
them, they had out of door living and swimming and shooting and
horse back riding and perfect freedom, they had not any need then
in living for a governess in the house with them. More and more
then this last governess became important in their mother's living,
more and more then in the children's living she had no meaning,
sometimes she would be interfering but mostly she had not even so
much importance for them, this will be clearer in the long
histories of each one of them.</p>

<p>More and more then this last governess was really then only in
Mrs. Hersland's living. She was pleasant enough at moments in Mr.
Hersland's living, but she was prominent only in Mrs. Hersland's
living. Mrs. Hersland and Mr. Hersland never thought about her not
being important in their children's living, she kept on being in
the house with them and then came her people's nagging and then the
arousing in Mrs. Hersland of attacking resisting and Mr. Hersland
had not then about it any very strong feeling. He went, in her
action, along with Mrs. Hersland but it was not then important to
him. The children then had completely drifted away from governess
training, they had then perfect freedom in living, the governess
then was not existing for them. This was the last governess the
Hersland children had living with them.</p>

<p>John Summer's father had come from the same part of the country
as Mr. Wyman. They had known each other in Europe. The old Mr.
Summer was dead then and his wife John Summer's mother did not like
Mr. and Mrs. Wyman and never came to see them. She did not want to
know that they were still living in Gossols in the same town with
her. John Summer was not a young man now when he wanted to marry
Madeleine Wyman, he was much older than she was, about fifteen
years older. This match was not the work of Mrs. Wyman, it was only
that Summer was used to Madeleine Wyman and he came to want to
marry her. Madeleine was willing enough to marry John Summer, he
was pretty rich and could go out of business after marrying and go
travelling or any thing that would please her. Mr. Hersland thought
it a good match for her, Mr. Hersland always wanted girls to use
their sense in marrying and Madeleine Wyman certainly ought to
marry John Summer. Mr. Hersland always believed girls should have
common sense in them, he always gave them advice about saving money
and marrying and cooking. He always gave advice to the second
governess who was married to the baker, how she should act so that
her husband would be contented with her. In his later living he was
strong in sensible advice to women in their living. Now he said it
would be the best thing Madeleine could be doing, marrying John
Summer. Mr. Hersland always gave advice to the second governess who
had married the baker, he would stop there and eat a cake and look
at her and give her a lecture. He liked the feeling of women and he
wanted them to have sense in them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hersland always wanted Madeleine some time to marry Summer
but she wanted it to be put off a little longer so that their
feeling would be tenderer, so that there should not be any forcing
from Mrs. Wyman. Then too she wanted Madeleine to stay in the house
with her for the important feeling in her through her, though she
did not know this in her. Now her children were drifting away from
being a part in her. Now Mr. Hersland was beginning to have more
and more in him impatient feeling and brushing her away from around
him. Mrs. Hersland did not know it inside her but she wanted
Madeleine in the house with her, she wanted to have from her
important being of herself to herself inside her. Now Mrs. Hersland
had less and less in her the feeling of her children being in her
as inside her, they were getting big then around her and were
coming more and more then to be apart from her. She was beginning
then more to have her husband forget her, country house living then
was an old story to her, they never had visitors any more then and
though to herself then she still always had inside her the feeling
of rich right country house living, still then it was not lively to
her feeling, there was nothing to make it strong then inside her,
in her feeling. She had then her early living, her Bridgepoint
family being, she had the talking of this to make for her of it to
her then a stronger thing in her feeling than it really was in her
being. This was then in those years in the middle of her middle
living her important being in her talking, and her important
feeling; her early living, her marrying and her eastern travelling,
Madeleine Wyman was then the important part of her important
feeling. Her children were then not living by her being, her
husband was then not living by her being, Madeleine Wyman was
living by her being, from Madeleine Mrs. Hersland had then all her
active important being and this is interesting.</p>

<p>Now it is clear, the kind of being Mrs. Hersland had in her and
that which Madeleine Wyman had in her. More and more it is surer
that this kind of describing leads to complete understanding of men
and women. Sometime then there will be a complete history of every
one who ever was or is or will be living.</p>

<p>To some beginning is always in their living, to some ending is
always in them to their feeling, in them and in every one, to them.
To some, it is different in their beginning, their middle living
and their ending, the sense of beginning or of ending always being
in them. In many there is always all through their living either
beginning or ending always in their feeling, in themselves, in
everything that happens to them, in everything that happens to
every one.</p>

<p>Sometimes then to one all the world is full of beginning to
them, to some then sometimes, all the world is filled up full with
ending. To some then sometimes all the world is filled up full with
beginning, to some then sometimes all the world is filled up full
with ending, to some then sometimes all the world is filled up full
with continuing. To some the world always is filled up full with
beginning, to some everything and every one is always filled up
full with continuing, to some always all their living every one
they ever see around them, everything, is ending. There are then
many kinds of ways of feeling. Every one has sometime some kind of
feeling in them of every one and everything, as always beginning,
always continuing or always ending, many have a mixture in them.
Repeating then is in every one, in every one their being and their
feeling and their way of realising everything and every one comes
out of them in repeating. More and more then every one comes to be
clear to some one.</p>

<p>Slowly every one in continuous repeating, to their minutest
variation, comes to be clearer to some one. Every one who ever was
or is or will be living sometimes will be clearly realised by some
one. Sometime there will be an ordered history of every one. Slowly
every kind of one comes into ordered recognition. More and more
then it is wonderful in living the subtle variations coming clear
into ordered recognition, coming to make every one a part of some
kind of them, some kind of men and women. Repeating then is in
every one, every one then comes sometime to be clearer to some one,
sometime there will be then an orderly history of every one who
ever was or is or will be living. Repeating then is in every one,
repeating then makes a complete history in every one for some one
sometime to realise in that one. Repeating is in them of the most
delicate shades in them of being and of feeling and so it comes to
be clear in each one the complete nature in each one, it comes to
be clear in each one the connection between that one and others to
make a kind of them, a kind of men and women. Repeating is a
wonderful thing in being, everything, every one is repeating then
always the whole of them and so sometime there surely will be an
ordered history of every one. More and more then this is a clear
thing. Everyone has their own being in them, every one has
repeating always in them always of the whole of them, always the
kinds of them come to be clearer and the division again into kinds
of them. Sometime then there will be an orderly history of every
kind of men and women and that will be very interesting.</p>

<p>There is now then coming to be an ending of the beginning of the
history of the Hersland family. There are then now living in the
ten acre place in that part of Gossols where no other rich people
were living. Mr. and Mrs. Hersland and the three Hersland children.
There will now come to be a history of each one of the three
children and in the history of each one of them more history of Mr.
and Mrs. Hersland and more history of the governesses and the
seamstresses and servants in the house with them and more history
of the families in the small houses near them, and histories of
every one they ever came to know in their living, al three of the
Hersland children. There is then to be a history of each une of the
children, there is then to be a history of the later living of Mr.
and Mrs. Hersland, there is then to be more and more a history of
everyone who ever was or is or will be living. Sometime there will
be written a long book that is a real history of every one who ever
were or are or will be living, from their beginning to their
ending, now there is a history of the Hersland and the Dehning
families and every one who ever came to know them.</p>

<p>This is now a history of the Hersland family being and of the
being of the people they came to know in their living. There has
now been some description of the Hersland family and their living
in the beginning and middle living of Mr. David Hersland and his
wife Fanny Hersland. There has been already a little description of
them. There will be later more description of them. There is now to
be a beginning of the description of the being and the living in
each of the three Hersland children. There is now to be a beginning
of description of the being of the oldest of them, there is now to
be a beginning of a description of the being of Martha Hersland and
a beginning of a description of the being in every one she ever
came to know in her living. Later there will be a description of
the being in all three of the Hersland children and a description
of every one they ever came to know in their living. Now there is a
beginning of description of the being in the oldest of the three
children, now there is a commencing a beginning of a description of
the being and the living in Martha Hersland the oldest of the
children and of every one she ever knew in her living. To begin
then.<br>

<h2>4. MARTHA HERSLAND</h2>

<p>I am writing for myself and strangers. This is the only way that
I can do it. Everybody is a real one to me, everybody is like some
one else too to me. No one of them that I know can want to know it
and so I write for myself and strangers.</p>

<p>Every one is always busy with it, no one of them then ever want
to know it that every one looks like some one else and they see it.
Mostly every one dislikes to hear it. It is very important to me to
always know it, to always see it which one looks like others and to
tell it. I write for myself and strangers. I do this for my own
sake and for the sake of those who know I know it that they look
like other ones, that they are separate and yet always repeated.
There are some who like it that I know they are like many others
and repeat it, there are many who never can really like it.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and they know it. They are all of
them repeating and I hear it. I love it and I tell it, I love it
and now I will write it. This is now the history of the way some of
them are it.</p>

<p>I write for myself and strangers. No one who knows me can like
it. At least they mostly do not like it that every one is of a kind
of men and women and I see it. I love it and I write it.</p>

<p>I want readers so strangers must do it. Mostly no one knowing me
can like it that I love it that every one is of a kind of men and
women, that always I am looking and comparing and classifying of
them, always I am seeing their repeating. Always more and more I
love repeating, it may be irritating to hear from them but always
more and more I love it of them. More and more I love it of them,
the being in them, the mixing in them, the repeating in them, the
deciding the kind of them every one is who has human being.</p>

<p>This is now a little of what I love and how I write it. Later
there will be much more of it.</p>

<p>There are many ways of making kinds of men and women. Now there
will be descriptions of every kind of way every one can be a kind
of men and women.</p>

<p>This is now a history of Martha Hersland. This is now a history
of Martha and of every one who came to be of her living.</p>

<p>There will then be soon much description of every way one can
think of men and women, in their beginning, in their middle living,
and their ending.</p>

<p>Every one then is an individual being. Every one then is like
many others always living, there are many ways of thinking of every
one, this is now a description of all of them. There must then be a
whole history of each one of them. There must then now be a
description of all repeating. Now I will tell all the meaning to me
in repeating, the loving there is in me for repeating.</p>

<p>Every one is one inside them, every one reminds some one of some
other one who is or was or will be living. Every one has it to say
of each one he is like such a one I see it in him, every one has it
to say of each one she is like some one else I can tell by
remembering. So it goes on always in living, every one is always
remembering some one who is resembling to the one at whom they are
then looking. So they go on repeating, every one is themselves
inside them and every one is resembling to others, and that is
always interesting. There are many ways of making kinds of men and
women. In each way of making kinds of them there is a different
system of finding them resembling. Sometime there will be here
every way there can be of seeing kinds of men and women. Sometime
there will be then a complete history of each one. Every one always
is repeating the whole of them and so sometime some one who sees
them will have a complete history of every one. Sometime some one
will know all the ways there are for people to be resembling, some
one sometime then will have a completed history of every one.</p>

<p>Soon now there will be a history of the way repeating comes out
of them comes out of men and women when they are young, when they
are children, they have then their own system of being resembling;
this will soon be a description of the men and women in beginning,
the being young in them, the being children.</p>

<p>There is then now and here the loving repetition, this is then,
now and here, a description of the loving of repetition and then
there will be a description of all the kinds of ways there can be
seen to be kinds of men and women. Then there will be realised the
complete history of every one, the fundamental character of every
one, the bottom nature in them, the mixtures in them, the strength
and weakness of everything they have inside them, the flavor of
them, the meaning in them, the being in them, and then you have a
whole history then of each one. Everything then they do in living
is clear to the completed understanding, their living, loving,
eating, pleasing, smoking, thinking, scolding, drinking, working,
dancing, walking, talking, laughing, sleeping, everything in them.
There are whole beings then, they are themselves inside them,
repeating coming out of them makes a history of each one of
them.</p>

<p>Always from the beginning there was to me all living as
repeating. This is now a description of my feeling. As I was saying
listening to repeating is often irritating, always repeating is all
of living, everything in a being is always repeating, more and more
listening to repeating gives to me completed understanding. Each
one slowly comes to be a whole one to me. Each one slowly comes to
be a whole one in me. Soon then it commences to sound through my
ears and eyes and feelings the repeating that is always coming out
from each one, that is them, that makes then slowly of each one of
them a whole one. Repeating then comes slowly then to be to one who
has it to have loving repeating as natural being comes to be a full
sound telling all the being in each one such a one is ever knowing.
Sometimes it takes many years of knowing some one before the
repeating that is that one gets to be a steady sounding to the
hearing of one who has it as a natural being to love repeating that
slowly comes out from every one. Sometimes it takes many years of
knowing some one before the repeating in that one comes to be a
clear history of such a one. Natures sometimes are so mixed up in
some one that steady repeating in them is mixed up with changing.
Soon then there will be a completed history of each one. Sometimes
it is difficult to know it in some, for what these are saying is
repeating in them is not the real repeating of them, is not the
complete repeating for them. Sometimes many years of knowing some
one pass before repeating of all being in them comes out clearly
from them. As I was saying it is often irritating to listen to the
repeating they are doing, always then that one that has it as being
to love repeating that is the whole history of each one, such a one
has it then that this irritation passes over into patient completed
understanding. Loving repeating is one way of being. This is now a
description of such feeling.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and they know it. They are all of
them repeating and I hear it. I love it and I tell it. I love it
and now I will write it. This is now a history of my love of it. I
hear it and I love it and I write it. They repeat it. They live it
and I see it and I hear it. They live it and I hear it and I see it
and I love it and now and always I will write it. There are many
kinds of men and women and I know it. They repeat it and I hear it
and I love it. This is now a history of the way they do it. This is
now a history of the way I love it.</p>

<p>Now I will tell of the meaning to me in repeating, of the loving
there is in me for repeating.</p>

<p>Sometime every one becomes a whole one to me. Sometime every one
has a completed history for me. Slowly each one is a whole one to
me, with some, all their living is passing before they are a whole
one to me. There is a completed history of them to me then when
there is of them a completed understanding of the bottom nature in
them of the nature or natures mixed-up in them with the bottom
nature of them or separated in them. There is then a history of the
things they say and do and feel, and happen to them. There is then
a history of the living in them. Repeating is always in all of
them. Repeating in them comes out of them, slowly making clear to
any one that looks closely at them the nature and the natures mixed
up in them. This sometime comes to be clear in every one.</p>

<p>Often as I was saying repeating is very irritating to listen to
from them and then slowly it settles into a completed history of
them. Repeating is a wonderful thing in living being. Sometime then
the nature of every one comes to be clear to some one listening to
the repeating coming out of each one.</p>

<p>This is then now to be a little description of the loving
feeling for understanding of the completed history of each one that
comes to one who listens always steadily to all repeating. This is
the history then of the loving feeling in me of repeating, the
loving feeling in me for completed understanding of the completed
history of every one as it slowly comes out in every one as
patiently and steadily I hear it and see it as repeating in them.
This is now a little a description of this loving feeling. This is
now a little a history of it from the beginning.</p>

<p>Always then I listen and come back again and again to listen to
every one. Always then I am thinking and feeling the repeating in
every one. Sometime then there will be for me a completed history
of every one. Every one is separate then and a kind of men and
women.</p>

<p>Sometime it takes many years of knowing some one before the
repeating in that one comes to be a clear history of such a one.
Sometimes many years of knowing some one pass before repeating of
all being in such a one comes out clearly from them, makes a
completed understanding of them by some one listening, watching,
hearing all the repeating coming out from such a one.</p>

<p>As I was saying loving listening, hearing always all repeating,
coming to completed understanding of each one is to some a natural
way of being. This is now more description of the feeling such a
one has in them, this is now more description of the way listening
to repeating comes to make completed understanding. This is now
more description of the way repeating slowly comes to make in each
one a completed history of them.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and always more and more I know it.
They are all of them repeating and I hear it. More and more I
understand it. Always more and more I hear it, always more and more
it has completed history in it.</p>

<p>Every one has their own being in them. Every one is of a kind of
men and women. Many have mixed up in them some kind of many kinds
of men and women. Slowly this comes clearly out from them in the
repeating that is always in all living. Slowly it comes out from
them to the most delicate gradation, to the gentlest flavor of
them. Always it comes out as repeating from them. Always it comes
out as repeating, out of them. Then to the complete understanding
they keep on repeating this, the whole of them and any one seeing
them then can understand them. This is a joy to any one loving
repeating when in any one repeating steadily tells over and over
again the history of the complete being in them. This is a solid
happy satisfaction to any one who has it in them to love repeating
and completed understanding.</p>

<p>As I was saying often for many years some one is baffling. The
repeated hearing of them does not make the completed being they
have in them to any one. Sometimes many years pass in listening to
repeating in such a one and the being of them is not a completed
history to any one then listening to them. Sometimes then it comes
out of them a louder repeating that before was not clear to
anybody's hearing and then it is a completed being to some one
listening to the repeating coming out of such a one.</p>

<p>This is then now a description of loving repeating being in
some. This is then now a description of loving repeating being in
one.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and they know it. They are all of
them repeating and I hear it. More and more I understand it. I love
it and I tell it. I love it and always I will tell it. They live it
and I see it and I hear it. They repeat it and I hear it and I see
it, sometime then always I understand it, sometime then always
there is a completed history of each one by it, sometime then I
will tell the completed history of each one as by repeating I come
to know it.</p>

<p>Every one always is repeating the whole of them. Every one is
repeating the whole of them, such repeating is then always in them
and so sometime some one who sees them will have a complete
understanding of the whole of each one of them, will have a
completed history of every man and every woman they ever come to
know in their living, every man and every woman who were or are or
will be living whom such a one can come to know in living.</p>

<p>This then is a history of many men and women, sometime there
will be a history of every one.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one always is repeating the whole of them.
As I was saying sometimes it takes many years of hearing the
repeating in one before the whole being is clear to the
understanding of one who has it as a being to love repeating, to
know that always every one is repeating the whole of them.</p>

<p>This is then the way such a one, one who has it as a being to
love repeating, to know that always every one is repeating the
whole of them comes to a completed understanding of any one. This
is now a description of such a way of hearing repeating.</p>

<p>Every one always is repeating the whole of them. Many always
listen to all repeating that comes to them in their living. Some
have it as being to love the repeating that is always in every one
coming out from them as a whole of them. This is now a description
of such a one and the completed understanding of each one who is
repeating in such a one's living.</p>

<p>Every one always is repeating the whole of them. Always, one
having loving repeating to getting completed understanding must
have in them an open feeling, a sense for all the slightest
variations in repeating, must never lose themselves so in the solid
steadiness of all repeating that they do not hear the slightest
variation. If they get deadened by the steady pounding of repeating
they will not learn from each one even though each one always is
repeating the whole of them they will not learn the completed
history of them, they will not know the being really in them.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one always is repeating the whole of them.
As I was saying sometimes it takes many years of listening, seeing,
living, feeling, loving the repeating there is in some before one
comes to a completed understanding. This is now a description, of
such a way of hearing, seeing, feeling living, loving,
repetition.</p>

<p>Mostly every one loves some one's repeating. Mostly every one
then, comes to know then the being of some one by loving the
repeating in them, the repeating coming out of them. There are some
who love everybody's repeating, this is now a description of such
loving in one.</p>

<p>Mostly every one loves some one's repeating. Every one always is
repeating the whole of them. This is now a history of getting
completed understanding by loving repeating in every one the
repeating that always is coining out of them as a complete history
of them. This is now a description of learning to listen to all
repeating that every one always is making of the whole of them.</p>

<p>Now I will tell of the meaning to me in repeating, of the loving
there is in me for repeating.</p>

<p>Always from the beginning there was to me all living as
repeating. This is now a description of loving repeating as a
being. This is now a history of learning to listen to repeating to
come to a completed understanding.</p>

<p>To go on now giving all of the description of how repeating
comes to have meaning, how it forms itself, how one must
distinguish the different meanings in repeating. Sometimes it is
very hard to understand the meaning of repeating. Sometime there
will be a complete history of some one having loving repeating as
being, to a completed understanding Now there will be a little
description of such a one.</p>

<p>Sometime then there will be a complete history of all repeating
to completed understanding. Sometime then there will be a complete
history of every one who ever was or is or will be living.</p>

<p>Sometime there will be a complete history of some one having
loving repeating to a completed understanding as being. Sometime
then there will be a complete history of many women and many
men.</p>

<p>Now there is to be some description of some one having loving
repeating to a completed understanding as being. Then there will be
a complete history of some.</p>

<p>More and more then there will be a history of many men and many
women from their beginning to their ending, as being babies and
children and growing young men and growing young women and young
grown men and young grown women and men and women in their middle
living and growing old men and growing old women and old men and
old women.</p>

<p>More and more then there will be histories of all the kinds
there are of men and women.</p>

<p>This is now a little description of having loving repeating as
being. This is now a little description of one having loving
repeating as being.</p>

<p>Loving repeating is one way of being. This is now a description
of such being. Loving repeating is always in children. Loving
repeating is in a way earth feeling. Some children have loving
repeating for little things and story-telling, some have it as a
more bottom being. Slowly this comes out in them in all their
children being, in their eating, playing, crying, and laughing.
Loving repeating is then in a way earth feeling. This is very
strong in some. This is very strong in many, in children and in old
age being. This is very strong in many in all ways of humorous
being, this is very strong in some from their beginning to their
ending. This is now some description of such being in one.</p>

<p>As I was saying loving repeating being is in a way earthy being.
In some it is repeating that gives to them always a solid feeling
of being. In some children there is more feeling in repeating
eating and playing, in some in story-telling and their feeling.
More and more in living as growing young men and women and grown
young men and women and men and women in their middle living, more
and more there comes to be in them differences in loving repeating
in different kinds of men and women, there comes to be in some more
and in some less loving repeating. Loving repeating in some is a
going on always in them of earthy being, in some it is the way to
completed understanding. Loving repeating then in some is their
natural way of complete being. This is now some description of
one.</p>

<p>There is then always repeating in all living. There is then in
each one always repeating their whole being, the whole nature in
them. Much loving repeating has to be in a being so that that one
can listen to all the repeating in every one. Almost every one
loves all repeating in some one. This is now some description of
loving repeating, all repeating, in every one.</p>

<p>To begin again with the children. To begin again with the
repeating being in them. To begin again with the loving repeating
being in them. As I was saying, some children have it in them to
love repeating in them of eating, of angry feeling in them, many of
them have loving repeating for storytelling in them, many of them
have loving repeating being in them for any kind of being funny, in
making jokes or teasing, many of them have loving repeating being
in them in all kinds of playing. Mostly every one when they are
children, mostly every one has then loving repeating being strongly
in them, some have it more some have it less in them and this comes
out more and more in them as they come to be young adolescents in
their being and then grown young men and grown young women.</p>

<p>To begin again then with children in their having loving
repeating being. Mostly all children have loving repeating as being
in them but some have it much more and some have it much less in
them. Loving repeating being is more of that kind of being that has
resisting as its natural way of fighting than of that kind of being
that has attacking as its natural way of winning. But this is a
very complicated question. I know very much about these ways of
being in men and women. I know it and can say it, it is a very
complex question and I do not know yet the whole of it, so I can
not yet say all I know of it.</p>

<p>As I was saying all little children have in them mostly very
much loving repeating being. As they grow into bigger children some
have it more some have it less in them. Some have it in them more
and more as a conscious feeling. Many of them do not have it in
them more and more as a conscious feeling. Mostly when they are
growing to be young men and women they have not it in them to have
loving repeating being in them as a conscious feeling.</p>

<p>Mostly every one has not it in them as a conscious feeling as a
young grown man or young grown woman. Some have it in them, loving
repeating feeling as steadily developing, this is now a history of
one.</p>

<p>Many men and many women never have it in them the conscious
feeling of loving repeating. Many men and many women never have it
in them until old age weakening is in them, a consciousness of
repeating. Many have it in them all their living as a conscious
feeling as a humorous way of being in them. Some have it in them,
the consciousness of always repeating the whole of them as a
serious obligation. There are many many ways then of having
repeating as conscious feeling, of having loving repeating as a
bottom being, of having loving repeating being as a conscious
feeling.</p>

<p>As I was saying mostly all children have in them loving
repeating being as important in them to them and to every one
around them. Mostly growing young men and growing young women have
to themselves very little loving repeating being, they do not have
it to each other then most of them, they have it to older ones then
as older ones have it to them loving repeating being, not loving
repeating being but repeating as the way of being in them,
repeating of the whole of them as coming every minute from
them.</p>

<p>In the middle living of men and women there are very different
ways of feeling to repeating, some have more and more in them
loving repeating as a conscious feeling, some have less and less
liking in them for the repeating in, to them, of mostly every one.
Mostly every one has a loving feeling for repeating in some one.
Some have not any such loving even in the repeating going on inside
themselves then, not even for any one they are loving.</p>

<p>Some then have always growing in them more and more loving
feeling for the repeating in every one. Many have not any loving
for repeating in many of those around them.</p>

<p>There are then many ways of feeling in one about repeating.
There are many ways of knowing repeating when one sees and hears
and feels it in every one.</p>

<p>Loving repeating then is important being in some. This is now
some description of the importance of loving repeating being in
one.</p>

<p>Some find it interesting to find inside them repeating in them
of some one they have known or some relation to them coming out in
them, some never have any such feeling in them, some have not any
liking for such being in them. Some like to see such being in
others around them but not in themselves inside them. There are
many ways of feeling in one about all these kinds of repeating.
Sometime there will be written the history of all of them.</p>

<p>To begin again then with some description of the meaning of
loving repeating being when it is strongly in a man or in a woman,
when it is in them their way of understanding everything in living
and there are very many always living of such being. This is now
again a beginning of a little description of it in one.</p>

<p>Repeating of the whole of them is then always in every one.
There are different stages in being, there is being babies and
children and then growing young men or women and grown young men or
women and men or women in middle living and in growing old and in
ending. There are many kinds of men and women and soon now there
will be a beginning of a history of all of them who ever were or
are or will be living. There will be then here written a history of
some of them. To begin again then with loving repeating being as a
bottom nature in some. To begin again with the developing of it in
one.</p>

<p>As I was saying children have it in them to have strongly loving
repeating being as a conscious feeling in so far as they can be
said to have such a thing in them. It gives to them a solid feeling
of knowing they are safe in living. With growing it comes to be
more in some, it comes to be less in others of them. Mostly there
is very little conscious loving repeating feeling in growing young
men and women.</p>

<p>In the beginning then, in remembering, repeating was strongly in
the feeling of one, in the feeling of many, in the feeling of most
of them who have it to have strongly in them their earthy feeling
of being part of the solid dirt around them. This is one kind of
being. This is mostly of one kind of being, of slow-minded
resisting fighting being. This is now a little a description of
one.</p>

<p>Slowly then some go on living, they may be fairly quick in
learning, some of such of them seem very quick and impetuous in
learning and in acting but such learning has for such of them very
little meaning, it is the slow repeating resisting inside them that
has meaning for them. Now there will be a little a description of
loving repeating being in one of such of them.</p>

<p>The kinds and ways of repeating, of attacking and resisting in
different kinds of men and women, the practical, the emotional, the
sensitive, the every kind of being in every one who ever was or is
or will be living, I know so much about all of them, many of them
are very clear in kinds of men and women, in individual men and
women, I know them so well inside them, repeating in them has so
much meaning to knowing, more and more I know all there is of all
being, more and more I know it in all the ways it is in them and
comes out of them, sometime there will be a history of every one,
sometime all history of all men and women will be inside some
one.</p>

<p>Now there will be a little description of the coming to be
history of all men and women, in some one. This is then to be a
little history of such a one. This is then now to be a little
description of loving repeating being in one.</p>

<p>Almost every one has it in them in their beginning to have
loving repeating being strongly in them. Some of them have
attacking being as the bottom nature in them, some of them have
resisting being as the bottom nature in them. Some of both these
kinds of them have more or less in all their living loving
repeating being in them, it works differently in them to come out
of them in these two kinds of them. Later there will be much
description of the way it comes out from them and is in them in the
different kinds of them. Now there is to be a little description of
it in one having resisting as the way of winning fighting. This is
now some description of such a one having loving repeating being
developing into completed understanding. Now to slowly begin.</p>

<p>The relation of learning to being, of thinking to feeling, of
realisation to emotion, all these and many others are very
complicated questions. Sometimes there will be much description of
them with the kinds of men and women with being in them, with
mixtures in them, that complicates them. There will sometime be a
history of every one. This is a sure thing.</p>

<p>Now again to begin. The relation of learning and thinking to
being, of feeling to realising is a complicated question. There
will now be very little talking of such way of being. As I was
saying some have it in them to have slowly resisting as their
natural way of being can have learning and thinking come quickly
enough in them. This is then not bottom being in them. It is bottom
being in some of such of them. This is very clear now in my
knowing. Now to begin again with it as telling.</p>

<p>Some then who are of that kind of being who have slow resisting
being as their way to wisdom have it in them to be quick in
learning and in thinking and in acting. As I was saying in some
this is not of the bottom nature in them, in some it is bottom
nature in them for the slow resisting winning bottom to them was
not put in in the making of them, in some it is in them but dull
and not mixing in their living, in some it is not sensitive to
action in their living, it is there in them going on inside them
not connecting on with the rest of them. This is not just talking,
this all has real meaning. These are all then of a kind of men and
women who have resisting being as the real wisdom in them. In some
of such of them they seem to be winning by acting by attacking they
live so very successfully in living but nevertheless they are of
the kind of them that have resisting winning as their real way of
fighting although never in their living does this act in them.
Careful listening to the whole of them always repeating shows this
in them, what kind they are of men and women.</p>

<p>To begin again. This is now some description of one having
loving repeating as a way to wisdom, having slowly resisting
winning as the bottom being. As I was saying learning in such a one
and thinking about everything can be quick enough in the
beginning.</p>

<p>The important thing then in knowing the bottom nature in any one
is the way their real being slowly comes to be them, the whole of
them comes to be repeating in them.</p>

<p>As I was saying some can have quick learning and nervous
attacking or one or the other in them with slow resisting being in
them as their natural way of winning. There is every kind of
mixing. There is every degree of intensification. There is every
degree of hastening the resisting into more rapid realisation.
There is every degree of hurrying. In short there are all degrees
of intensification and rapidity in motion and mixing and disguising
and yet the kind he is each one, the kind she is each one, comes to
be clear in the repeating that more and more steadily makes them
clear to any one looking hard at them. These kinds then are
existing, the independent dependent, the dependent independent, the
one with attacking as the way of winning, the other with resisting
as the way of wisdom for them. I know then this is true of every
one that each one is of one or the other kind of these two kinds of
them. I know it is in them, I know many more thing about these two
kinds of them. Slowly they come to be clearer in every one,
sometime perhaps it will be clear to every one. Sometime perhaps
some one will have completely in them the history of every one of
everything in every one and the degree and kind and way of being of
everything in each one in them from their beginning to their ending
and coming out of them.</p>

<p>This is then a beginning of the way of knowing everything in
every one, of knowing the complete history of each one who ever is
or was or will be living. This is then a little description of the
winning of so much wisdom.</p>

<p>As I was saying the important thing is having loving repeating
being, that is the beginning of learning the complete history of
every one. That being must always be in such a one, one who has it
in them sometime to have in them the completed history of every one
they ever can hear of as having being.</p>

<p>There are so many ways of beginning this description, and now
once more to make a beginning.</p>

<p>Always repeating is all of living, everything that is being is
always repeating, more and more listening to repeating gives to me
completed understanding. Each one then slowly comes to be a whole
one to me, each one slowly comes to be a whole one in me, slowly it
sounds louder and louder and louder inside me through my ears and
eyes and feelings and the talking there is always in me the
repeating that is the whole of each one I come to know around, and
each one of them then comes to be a whole one to me, comes to be a
whole one in me. Loving repeating is one way of being. This is now
a description of such being.</p>

<p>Always from the beginning there was to me all living as
repeating. This was not in me then a conscious being. Always more
and more this is in me developing to a completed being. This is now
again a beginning of a little description of such being.</p>

<p>In their beginning as children every one has in them loving
repeating being. This is for them then their natural being. Later
in conscious being some have much in them of loving repeating
being, some have in them almost nothing of such feeling. There are
then these two kinds of them. This is then one way of thinking of
them.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of men and women, those who have in them
resisting as their way of winning those who have in them attacking
as their way of winning fighting, there are many kinds, many very
many kinds of each of these two kinds of men and women, sometime
there will be written a description of all the kinds of them. Now
this division is accepted by me and I will now give a little more
description of loving repeating being and then go on to describing
how it comes to slowly give to me completed understanding, loving
repeating being always in me acting, of this one and that one, and
then there will be some description of resembling coming to be
clear by looking at the repeating in men and women and then there
will be more history of Martha Hersland and the being coming out of
her all her living and the being in every one she came to know in
living.</p>

<p>Always then from the beginning there was in me always increasing
as a conscious feeling loving repeating being, learning to know
repeating in every one, hearing the whole being of any one always
repeating in that one every minute of their living. There was then
always in me as a bottom nature to me an earthy, resisting slow
understanding, loving repeating being. As I was saying this has
nothing to do with ordinary learning, in a way with ordinary
living. This will be clearer later in this description.</p>

<p>Many have loving repeating being in them, many never come to
know it of them, many never have it as a conscious feeling, many
have in it a restful satisfaction. Some have in it always more and
more under standing, many have in it very little enlarging
understanding. There is every kind of way of having loving
repeating being as a bottom. It is very clear to me and to my
feeling, it is very slow in developing, it is very important to
make it clear how in writing, it must be done now with a slow
description. To begin again then with it in my feeling, to begin
again then to tell of the meaning to me in all repeating, of the
loving there is in me for repeating.</p>

<p>Sometime every one becomes a whole one to me. For many years
this was just forming in me. Now sometimes it takes many years for
some one to be a whole one to me. For many years loving repeating
was a bottom to me, I was never thinking then of the meaning of it
in me, it had nothing then much to do with the learning, the
talking, the thinking, nor the living then in me. There was for
many years a learning and talking and questioning in me and not
listening to repeating in every one around me. Then slowly loving
repeating being came to be a conscious feeling in me. Slowly then
every one sometime became a whole one to me.</p>

<p>Now I will tell of the meaning in me of repeating, of the loving
repeating being there is now always in me.</p>

<p>In loving repeating being then to completed understanding there
must always be a feeling for all changing, a feeling for living
being that is always in repeating. This is now again a beginning of
a description of my feeling.</p>

<p>Always then I am thinking and feeling the repeating in each one
as I know them. Always then slowly each one comes to be a whole one
to me. As I was saying loving repeating in every one, hearing
always all repeating, coming to completed understanding of each one
is to me a natural way of being.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and always more and more I know it.
They are all of them repeating and I hear it. They are all of them
living and I know it. More and more I understand it, always more
and more it has completed history in it.</p>

<p>Every one has their own being in them. Every one is of a kind of
men and women. Always more and more I know the whole history of
each one. This is now a little a description of such knowing in me.
This is now a little a description of beginning of hearing
repeating all around me.</p>

<p>As I was saying learning, thinking, living in the beginning of
being men and women often has in it very little of real being. Real
being, the bottom nature, often does not then in the beginning do
very loud repeating. Learning, thinking, talking, living, often
then is not of the real bottom being. Some are this way all their
living. Some slowly come to be repeating louder and more clearly
the bottom being that makes them. Listening to repeating, knowing
being in every one who ever was or is or will be living slowly came
to be in me a louder and louder pounding. Now I have it to my
feeling to feel all living, to be always listening to the slightest
changing, to have each one come to be a whole one to me from the
repeating in each one that sometime I come to be understanding.
Listening to repeating is often irritating, listening to repeating
can be dulling, always repeating is all of living, everything in a
being is always repeating, always more and more listening to
repeating gives to me completed understanding. Each one slowly
comes to be a whole one to me. Each one slowly comes to be a whole
one in me.</p>

<p>In the beginning then learning and thinking and talking and
feeling and loving and working in me mostly was not bottom being in
me. Slowly it came out in me the feeling for living in repeating
that now by listening and watching and feeling everything coming
out of each one and always repeating the whole one gives to me
completed understanding.</p>

<p>There was a time when I was questioning, always asking, when I
was talking, wondering, there was a time when I was feeling,
thinking and all the time then I did not know repeating, I did not
see or hear or feel repeating. There was a long time then when
there was nothing in me using the bottom loving repeating being
that now leads me to knowing. Then I was attacking, questioning,
wondering, thinking, always at the bottom was loving repeating
being, that was not then there to my conscious being. Sometime
there will be written a long history of such a beginning.</p>

<p>Always then there was there a recognition of the thing always
repeating, the being in each one, and always then thinking,
feeling, talking, living, was not of this real being. Slowly I came
to hear repeating. More and more then I came to listen, now always
and always I listen and always now each one comes to be a whole one
to me.</p>

<p>This will be clearer now in a description of how several men and
several women came to be a whole one to me. Later then there will
be more description of the knowing of the kinds there are of men
and women, of the resembling that makes kinds of them around one.
Now there will be a little description of the slow way repeating
makes a whole one to me. Later there will be again a continuing of
the description of the living of the Hersland family, the father
and the mother and the three children.</p>

<p>Now this is the way I hear repeating. This is the way slowly
some men and some women, each one, comes to be a whole one to
me.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and always more and more I know it.
They are all of them repeating and I hear it. More and more I
understand it. Always more and more I know it, always more and more
it has completed history in it.</p>

<p>Every one then has their own being in them. Every one is of a
kind of men and women. Always then I listen and come back again and
again to listen to every one. Always then I am thinking and feeling
the repeating in every one. Sometime then there will be for me a
completed history of every one. Every one is separate then. Every
one is always repeating the whole of them.</p>

<p>Sometimes it takes many years of knowing some one before the
repeating in that one comes to be a clear history of such a one.
Sometimes many years of knowing some one pass before repeating of
all being in such a one comes out clearly from them, makes a
completed understanding of them by some one listening, watching,
hearing all the repeating coming out from such a one.</p>

<p>As I was saying always then I listen and feel and say and come
back again and again to the repeating in every one. Sometime then
each one comes to be to me a completed being. This is now the
slowly completed history of some.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and I know it. They are many that I
know and they know it. They are all of them themselves and they
repeat it and I hear it. Always I listen to it. Slowly I come to
understand it. Many years I listened and did not know it. I heard
it, I understood it some, I did not know I heard it. They repeat
themselves now and I listen to it. Every way that they do it now I
hear it. Now each time very slowly I come to understand it. Always
it comes very slowly the completed understanding of it, the
repeating each one does to tell it the whole history of the being
in each one, always now I hear it. Always now slowly I understand
it.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and always more and more I know it.
They are always all of them always repeating themselves and I hear
it. Always I stop myself from being too quickly sure that I have
heard all of it. Always I begin again to listen to it. Always I
remember all the times I thought I had heard all of it all the
repeating in some one and then there was much more to it. Always I
remember every way one can hear only a part of it, the repeating
that is the whole history of any one and so always I begin again as
if I had never heard it.</p>

<p>Always I love it, sometimes I get a little tired of it, mostly I
am always ready to do it, always I love it, listening up to
completed understanding of the repeating that sometime is a
completed history of each one is all my life and always I live it.
I love it and I live it. Sometimes I am tired in it, mostly I am
always ready for it.</p>

<p>Mostly in the beginning as I was saying I heard repeating, I was
learning, thinking, talking, living not really anything I was
really knowing. Slowly I came to be living, loving thinking,
feeling, hearing every one repeating, beginning again and again so
as to feel all changing, remembering all the ways one always can
come to be mistaken. Sometime there will be more history of it the
way some young people live it the beginning and then slowly the
bottom in them comes to be all them. Sometime there will be a
history of all young living, feeling, talking, thinking, being.
Some have their real being in young living, some do not have it
then in them. Later there will be a history of all of them, of
every one.</p>

<p>To begin then again with a little description of my coming to
completed understanding of some now that I am always hearing,
seeing, feeling all being in each one repeating. Later there will
be a description of earlier learning. Now there will be some
description of realising some, now when hearing repeating is my
natural way of learning. To begin then.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and always slowly I understand more,
and more of it, the way I know it, the way I come to know it. There
are many that I know. Always slowly I understand more and more of
it. Slowly each one that I know comes to be a real one to me.</p>

<p>Every one has their own being in them. Slowly in listening,
seeing, feeling all the repeating in each one of them slowly each
one of them comes to be a whole one to any one that so hears and
feels and sees them. This is now a little description of some, this
is now a little description of how hearing, feeling, seeing
repeating in some makes of such of them to such a one completed
beings. This is now a little such a description to lead up to kinds
of men and women. To begin then.</p>

<p>Every one I am ever knowing slowly comes to be a whole one to
me. Each one slowly comes to be a whole one in me. Sometimes for
many years some one is baffling. I hear them and I see them and I
feel them in all the repeating I can see and hear and feel from
them and seeing, hearing, feeling does not give to me completed
understanding of the completed being in them.</p>

<p>Sometimes some one for many years is baffling. The repeated
hearing, seeing, feeling of repeating in them does not give to me
then a history of the complete being in them. Slowly then sometime
it comes to be clearer of them, I begin again with listening, I
feel new shades in repeating, parts of repeating that I was
neglecting hearing, seeing, feeling come to have a louder beating.
Slowly it comes to a fuller sounding, sometimes many years pass in
such a baffling listening, feeling, seeing all the repeating in
some one. Then slowly such a one comes to have real meaning. Many
times I begin and then begin again. Always I must not begin a
deadened following, always their repeating must be a fresh feeling
in my hearing, seeing, feeling. Always I must admit all changing.
Always I must have a sensitive and open being, always I must have a
loving repeating being. Often listening to them is irritating,
often it is dulling, always then there must be in me new beginning,
always there must be in me steadily alive inside me my loving
repeating being. Then sometime every one is a completed being to
me, sometime every one has a completed history to me. Always then
it comes out of them their whole repeating, sometime then I can
feel and hear and see it all and it has meaning. Sometime then each
one I am ever knowing comes to be to me a completed being, and then
always they are always repeating always the whole of them.</p>

<p>There are many that I know then. They are all of them repeating
and I hear it, see it, feel it. More and more I understand it. I
love it, I tell it. I love it, I live it and I tell it. Always I
will tell it. They live it and I see it and I hear it and I feel
it. They live it and I see it and I hear it and I feel it and I
love it, sometime then I understand it, sometime then there is a
completed history of each one by it, sometime then I will tell the
completed history of every one as by hearing, feeling, seeing all
repeating I come to know it. Now I will just tell a few short
histories to explain it, to explain hearing, feeling, seeing
repeating and understanding being by it. Now I will tell a few
short histories in it to show loving repeating being in me and how
I use it.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one I am ever knowing slowly comes to be a
whole one to me. Each one slowly comes to be a whole one to me.
Some come to have for me complete meaning quicker then others of
them. Mostly all of them come pretty slowly to be a whole one to
me. This is now a little description of some who have come to be
inside me as a whole one to me, some very slowly, some quicker to
me. Always I am hearing, feeling, seeing all repeating in them,
always I have as a bottom loving repeating being.</p>

<p>Everybody is a real one to me, everybody is like some one else
too to me. This is always there in me this and loving repeating
being, always, in me.</p>

<p>Everybody is a real one to me, everybody is like some one else
too to me. Every one always is repeating the whole of them. Each
one slowly comes to be a whole one to me. Each one slowly comes to
be a whole one in me.</p>

<p>Some one coming to be a whole one in me is now what I am
describing. Every one is like some one else too to me, that will
have more meaning later when I am talking of the kinds there are of
men and women. Always every one is repeating the whole of them,
that is always there to bring to me completed understanding. That
is always there in every one to some one. That is always there in
every one to be a complete history always coming out of them.</p>

<p>To begin then again with a few of them who slowly come to be
each one of them a whole one to me.</p>

<p>Each one slowly comes to be a whole one to me. Each one slowly
comes to be a whole one in me. Every one always is repeating. As I
was saying sometimes it is very irritating hearing, feeling, seeing
repeating in some one, in every one. More and more then when such a
one is a whole one to me, more and more then as loving repeating is
all my being, more and more then I am happy in my loving repeating
being. Now then.</p>

<p>Each one slowly comes to be a whole one to me. Each one slowly
comes to be a whole one in me. This is now a description of
learning one.</p>

<p>There are then many ways of learning, there are then many ways
of having men and women come to be a whole one to me, come to be a
whole one in me. To begin now with one.</p>

<p>This one very slowly came to be a whole one to me. This one very
slowly came to be a whole one in me. Always now this one is a
complete one to me. Always now all the repeating I am hearing
coming from this one has real meaning. This is now a description of
this learning.</p>

<p>Each one slowly comes to be a whole one to me. Each one slowly
comes to be a whole one in me. This one very slowly came to be a
whole one in me. This then is now a description of one way of
learning to listen, feel and see all the repeating in some. Then
there will be descriptions of other ways of learning. Now to begin
again with this one.</p>

<p>Each one slowly comes to be a whole one to me. Each one slowly
comes to be a whole one in me. With some, right understanding of
the repeating always coming out from them takes many years of
loving repeating being in me to bring me to such understanding.</p>

<p>Each one slowly comes to be a whole one to me. Sometimes
listening, feeling, seeing, repeating in such a one is very
irritating. Slowly it comes clear and the one comes to be a whole
one to me.</p>

<p>There are many ways then of learning the complete being in any
one, this is now a description of one. There are many that I know
and I know it. Sometimes it takes many years to learn it. Sometime
each one is a whole one to me. Sometime each one is a whole one in
me. Sometimes alter I have them so I lose them and then I must
begin again to learn them. Mostly when I know them they keep on
being a whole one in me. Some are easier to keep as a whole one to
one than others around one. Some are easier to hold as a whole one
when one is thinking of them, some are easier to keep as a whole
one when one is hearing them coming out from them. There are all
kinds of ways then of knowing, there are all kinds of ways then of
remembering, there are all kinds of ways then of losing a thing
after it is knowledge in one. Each one then sometime is a whole one
to me. Each one then sometime is a whole one in me. This is now a
description of one. This is now a description of one who very
slowly came to be a whole one in me. This is now a very short
description of learning this one.</p>

<p>Sometimes it takes many years of listening, seeing, living,
feeling, loving the repeating there is in some one before one comes
to a completed understanding of such a one. Sometimes it is very
irritating to do such hearing, seeing, feeling living. Always there
is loving repetition being in one doing such listening, seeing,
feeling, often it is then very irritating, always then loving
feeling for repetition can make one go on living, hearing, seeing,
feeling all the repetitions coming out of such a one. As I was
saying almost every one has some one who sometimes has listened to
all the repeating in that one. This is from the loving feeling some
one, sometime has had for that one. Every one mostly, sometimes has
listened to all repeating in some one, has heard and felt and seen
all the repeating in some one. Mostly every one has sometime had
some one hear and see and feel all the repeating coming out of
them. Some have it to love every one. Some have it to love many men
and many women or many men or many women, some have it to love the
repeating in them, some have it to love every one and the repeating
in every one, some have it to love some and to love repeating in
every one. This is now some description of learning of complete
understanding in such a one.</p>

<p>Every one then sometime comes to be a whole one to me. Each one
sometime comes to be a whole one in me. Always loving repeating is
my way of being. This is now some description of my studying.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and always more and more I know it.
They are all of them repeating and I hear it. More and more I
understand it. Always more and more I see it, hear it, feel it,
always more and more it has to me completed history in it.</p>

<p>Every one has their own being in them. Everybody is a real one
to me. Each one sometimes is a whole one to me. Each one is
sometimes a whole one in me. Some come very slowly to be a complete
being to me.</p>

<p>This is now a description of learning to listen to all repeating
that every one always is making of the whole of them. This is now
some description of learning to hear, see and feel all repeating
that each one always is making of the whole of them. Each one as I
was saying some time comes to be a whole one in me, each one
sometime comes to be a complete being to me. Sometimes after they
are this to me I keep on knowing it inside me, sometimes I lose it,
sometimes I doubt it, it is too clear or too vague or too confused
inside me. Sometime then I have it all to do again. Always I keep
on hearing, feeling, seeing all repeating in each one for always it
has more and more being to my feeling.</p>

<p>This is now then some description of my learning. Then there
will be a beginning again of Martha Hersland and her being and her
living. This is now then first a little studying and then later
Martha Hersland will begin living. Now then to do this little
studying.</p>

<p>As I was saying each one sometime is a whole one to me.
Sometimes some one very very slowly comes to be a whole one to me.
Every one is a real one to me. Every one always is repeating the
whole of them.</p>

<p>Every one is sometime a puzzle to me. Every one is sometime a
whole being to me. Some one sometimes is many years a puzzle to me.
Sometime every one, each one is a whole being to me.</p>

<p>Some one sometimes for many years is a puzzle to me. Some slowly
come to be a whole one in me. Some all of a sudden come to be a
whole one to me. Mostly every one is sometime a puzzle to me.
Mostly every one is for some years a puzzle to me. This is now a
little a description of how one was a puzzle to me and then came to
be clear inside me, came to be a whole one to me. More and more
then as they are a whole one to me they are friendly to me there
inside me. Always they come to be more and more in me. Always they
come to have more and more meaning to me in the repeating which
then they are doing clearly to me, of the whole of them.</p>

<p>Many of them then are many years a puzzle to me.</p>

<p>Slowly then each one comes to be to me a whole one, always they
are repeating the whole of them then.</p>

<p>Every one is puzzling to me, some for some reason others for
other reasons, always every one is puzzling, sometime every one
becomes a whole one to me, mostly then they go on repeating clearly
to me the whole of them, sometimes they commence again to be a
puzzle to me, sometimes I lose the way of hearing clearly the
repeating of the whole of them that always every one is always
doing.</p>

<p>This one then was puzzling for many years to me and then slowly
this one came to be a whole one to me, many others then came to be
clear to me. Always then this one has been a whole one to me,
always then the whole of this one always is repeating to me. Often,
as I was saying, it is very irritating to be listening, irritating
when it is puzzling, irritating just to be hearing repeating. More
and more as each one is a whole one to me repeating from them is
not irritating to me, it is friendly there inside me, they are then
each one a whole one in me.</p>

<p>This one then for many years was puzzling to me. Slowly then
this one came to repeat clearly to me the whole being and then this
one came to be a whole one to me.</p>

<p>Slowly then this one came to be a whole one to me.</p>

<p>Always then I was listening, feeling, looking, always then I was
hearing, feeling, seeing the repeating always coming out of this
one and always it was puzzling, and mostly it was irritating
listening, and always this one was not then a whole one to me.</p>

<p>There is a certain feeling one has in one when some one is not a
whole one to one even though one seems to know all the nature of
that one. Such a one then is very puzzling and when sometime such a
one is a whole one to one all the repeating coming out of them has
meaning as part of a whole one. When some one is not a clear one to
one, repeating coming out of them has not this clear relation. Then
such a one is puzzling until they come to be a whole one. Then
repeating coming out of them has clear meaning.</p>

<p>Always then I am hearing, feeling, seeing the repeating always
coming out of every one. Loving repeating being is in me always
every moment in my living. Sometimes as I was saying hearing
repeating is very irritating. Always sometime it comes to be to me
a completed history of each one I am ever knowing.</p>

<p>As I was saying, then always I was seeing, feeling, hearing all
repeating coming out of this one. As I was saying often it was
irritating. As I was saying it was not for many years a clear
repeating of a whole being. Slowly then this one came to be a whole
one to me. This is now some description.</p>

<p>Sometime each one comes to be a whole one to me. Sometime the
bottom nature in each one, the other nature or natures in each one,
the mixing or not mixing in them of the natures in them comes to be
clear in each one, each one then is a complete one, each one then
keeps repeating the whole history of them.</p>

<p>Some then are puzzling a long time, almost every one is
puzzling, mostly every one is puzzling to me, sometime mostly every
one comes to be a whole one to me.</p>

<p>As I was saying there is a bottom nature in every one, the other
nature or natures in them may be of their kind of men and women, if
they are at bottom resisting the other nature or natures in them
may be of a kind of resisting, they may be of a kind of attacking
being. All this is very confusing. All this is very puzzling.
Always more and more I know it of each one the being in them the
mixtures in them, always more I come to have a completed
understanding of each one.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one sometime is a whole one to me. Every
one sometime is a complete being in me. Sometimes for many years
some one is puzzling, slowly then they come to be clearly a whole
one, then all the repeating coming out of them always tells and
keeps on telling to me the whole of them. Always then this
repeating of the whole of them has more and more completeness to
me, more and more of beauty for me, more and more a friendly
feeling in me.</p>

<p>In learning one I have been describing there was very long
listening, often listening was very irritating, there were many
years of puzzled being, there were many years then of believing in
the heard, seen, felt repeating which was every one's hearing,
feeling, seeing, without puzzling, slowly then there came to be in
me a puzzled feeling, slowly then I knew I was not hearing all the
repeating this one was doing, I was not feeling, hearing, seeing
the repeating that was a complete history of this one, always then
I was puzzling, slowly then the repeating coming out of this one
was a complete history of this one. Always I am listening to,
feeling, seeing what every one thinks about any one. Always I am
ready to feel some one will hear some repeating coming out of one
that I have not begun yet to see or hear or feel in that one.
Always then I am seeing, feeling, hearing what every one else sees
or feels or hears as repeating in each one. So then always sometime
there will come to be in me a complete seeing, hearing, feeling of
the repeating coming out of each one making a complete history of
each one.</p>

<p>One then I have been describing was to me a very slow long
learning. Always in the beginning the repeating I was hearing,
feeling, seeing coming always out of this one was to me a complete
history of the being of this one, the being I was first describing
that every one who knew this one felt was the being of this one.
More and more then hearing this repeating was irritating, more and
more then there was in me always a beginning again of listening to,
of seeing, feeling the repeating coming out of this one. Slowly
then there came to be in me puzzled feeling. Slowly there came to
be in me a feeling that it was not a complete repeating I was
hearing, not a complete history of her being. Then always I had in
me a puzzled feeling, slowly then there came to me to see in this
one other repeating that always was repeating but that slowly came
to have meaning. Always I was hearing, feeling, seeing every one
else feeling, listening to, seeing this one. Slowly then this one
came to be a complete one to me. Slowly then all the repeating came
to be a complete history of the being of this one always coming out
of this one always repeating the whole of the being this one had
all of her living. Slowly then every one, everything always
helping, slowly then, I always listening, looking, feeling, always
then I slowly, always hearing, seeing, feeling came to have this
one to be a whole one to me, came to have this one to be a whole
one inside me. Always then more and more I heard and saw and felt
all the repeating always telling the whole being in her, more and
more then I had in me a completed friendly feeling of the whole
being that was this one.</p>

<p>Each one comes to be a whole one to me. Each comes to be a whole
one in me. Some come very slowly to be a whole one to me. Some come
fairly quickly to be a whole one in me. Some come fairly quickly to
be a whole one in me, and then this whole one which was just
outlines comes to be more and more filled up for me. Some come to
be very slowly a whole one to me. There are every kind of way to
have men and women, in their beginning, in their middle being, in
their ending be a whole one inside any one to that one. Sometime
there will be a description of every kind of way any one can know
anything, any one can know any one.</p>

<p>Some one sometime comes to be a whole one to me, there are many
ways of learning in me, there are many ways of loving learning in
me, there are many ways of keeping everything that learning has
given to me, inside me. There are many ways then of having some
time to have it come that some one is a whole one in me. This is
now some description of another one coming to be a whole one to
me.</p>

<p>Sometimes I know and hear and feel and see all the repeating in
some one, all the repeating that is the whole of some one but it
always comes as pieces to me, it is never there to make a whole one
to me. Some people have it in them to be in pieces in repeating the
whole of them, such of them almost come never to be a whole one to
me, some come almost all their living in repeating to be succession
not a whole one inside me. Sometimes sometime such a one has a way
of loving which makes a whole one of such a one long enough to hear
the whole repeating in such a one as a complete one by some one.
Such a one comes then sometime to be a whole one and then one loses
the whole one repeating of them and they are pieces then of
repeating and always it is changing back to pieces of repeating
from the little time of loving that a little time makes of them a
whole one. There are very many of them and this is now a little a
description of the nature in this kind of them, this is now a
little a description of learning to know them to make of them a
complete one.</p>

<p>Every one then sometime is a whole one to me, every one then
sometimes is a whole one in me, some of these do not for long times
make a whole one to me inside me. Some of them are a whole one in
me and then they go to pieces again inside me, repeating comes out
of them as pieces to me, pieces of a whole one that only sometimes
is a whole one in me.</p>

<p>There are then a kind of them, a kind of men and women, there
are very many of them always living who have it in them to be
inside them to be mostly to every one, to be always to mostly every
one pieces coming out of them, pieces that never make of them a
whole one, not because of complication in them, not because of
difficulty of envisaging them but because really such of them are
in pieces inside them, always in their living. This kind then of
men and women have it to have it to be true of them that nothing in
them dominates them, not mind, nor bottom nature in them, nor other
nature or natures in them, nor emotion, nor sensitiveness, nor
suggestibility, nor practicalness, nor weakness, nor selfishness,
nor nervousness, nor egotism, nor desire, nor whimsicalness, nor
cleverness, nor ideals, nor stimulation, nor vices, nor
indifference, nor beauty, nor eating, nor drinking, nor laziness,
nor energy, nor emulation, nor envy, nor malice, nor pleasure, nor
skepticism. It is not as it is in some that there is contradictory
being in them, there is not in such of these of them domination of
anything in them to make contradiction, to make changing of one
thing to another in them. Always they are in pieces then but pieces
are not disconcerting to them or any one, hardly not puzzling. Some
of such of them sometimes then make melodrama of themselves to
themselves to hold themselves together to them. Some of such of
them make of themselves to themselves and sometimes to other ones
that know them a melodrama of themselves to make to themselves each
one of themselves a whole one to themselves and sometimes to make
of themselves a whole one to others around them. This is a very
interesting thing, this is sometimes the explanation of melodrama
in some one.</p>

<p>Some then some men and some women are not whole ones inside me
for long times together. Sometime one of such a one was a whole one
in me and then it was clear to me why such a kind of one was not
for long times continually a whole one in me.</p>

<p>In first beginning to know such a one if they make of themselves
melodrama to make to themselves a whole one of themselves to
themselves then such melodrama is very confusing, it is not natural
melodrama to them, melodrama in such of them is mostly not a
natural way of being, mostly such of them have pride to hide
themselves to themselves from knowing that there is not a whole to
them, pride to hide this from themselves and from every one. So
then melodrama in such a one is confusing. When melodrama is taken
from such a one then they remain confusing, there is nothing then
to guide any one to know them as a whole then such a one.</p>

<p>Such a one, now with no melodrama, just there as many pieces to
some one, remains confusing, not because they are not acting, not
because they are not repeating, they may be acting, every one
always is repeating, it is that nothing in them is dominating, they
are in pieces to themselves then and to everyone. They have not
weakness, nor laziness, nor dullness to make them confusing. They
are in pieces, there is not in them anything dominating, not the
bottom nature in them, not other nature or natures in them, not
confusion in them, not struggle or contradiction, or weakness or
indifference in them. So then such a one is puzzling.</p>

<p>Sometime then as I was saying each one comes to be a whole one
to me, sometime then each one comes to be clear inside me,
sometimes as I was saying it is slow growing this coming to
completed understanding inside me, sometimes it is a quick
illumination, sometimes it is a mixture of these two ways of
learning knowing, sometimes it is other ways of learning knowing in
me. As I was saying every one is surely sometime puzzling to
me.</p>

<p>As I was saying such a one, one being in pieces was a long time
puzzling to me. Always this one was in pieces though always loving
being was a louder piece than other pieces in that one.</p>

<p>So then such a one by not going on being a whole one after being
illuminated by seeming a whole one by that one's way of loving was
not any longer puzzling. This gave to me then an understanding of
the being in such ones, such a one then was not together for long
times as a whole one to me but to my understanding then from that
time on always was a whole one to me.</p>

<p>Every one then sometime is a whole one to me, every one then
always sometime comes to be clear to me, comes to be really a whole
one inside me.</p>

<p>This is clear then that there are many ways of hearing, feeling,
seeing repeating come out of every one. Always then I am seeing,
hearing, feeling all repeating coming out of every one. Always then
sometime every one I am ever knowing comes to be a whole one to me.
This is now a little a description of another way of learning
one.</p>

<p>Sometime then every one I know comes to be a whole one to me.
Mostly every one comes very slowly to be a whole one inside me.
Mostly every one is sometime and sometimes for a very long time a
puzzle to me, sometime some one only very slowly comes to be a
puzzle to me. Sometimes some one is never really a puzzle to me,
sometimes some one suddenly comes to be a whole one to me. Often
now when I know as much as I know now of kinds of men and women,
some men some women come to be quickly a whole one to me, mostly
still yet they come very slowly to be whole ones to me, mostly yet
each one is a long time a puzzle to me, earlier every one mostly
came very slowly to be a whole one to me, sometimes then some one
came suddenly and soon to be a whole one in me, sometimes then some
one was never really a puzzle to me. This then is another way of
learning in me. This is now then a little a description of such a
learning of one, one who was not really more than for the time of
intensely looking for one time of seeing a puzzle to me.</p>

<p>This is now a little description of learning quickly, one.</p>

<p>There was one, I knew some things about this one, I knew a
number of things about this one, I had heard descriptions of this
one, I was interested but not more than I am in every one. I was
not then very much interested in this one. As I was saying I had
heard descriptions of this one, they were ordinary descriptions,
they were not very interesting, they had not very much meaning.
Then I saw this one, then I looked intensely at this one, then this
one was a whole one to me. Then the whole being of this one was
inside me, it was then as possession of me. I could not get it out
from inside me, it gave new meanings to many things, it made a
meaning to me of damnation. I had then to tell it to this one, that
was the only way to loosen myself from this one who was a whole one
in me. I had then to tell this one of the meaning in damnation that
this one being a whole one inside me had made clear to me. Always
then later this one was a whole one to me, it was then a gentler
possession of me inside me than when this one first was a whole one
inside me, a damned one to me. It was still true to me later inside
me the whole of this one hut it did not then possess me. This is
then one way of learning a whole one, by seeing them completely by
one long looking at them. This is now a little more description of
this one and being possessed by this one as a whole one inside me.
To begin again then. There are many that I know and they know it.
Very often I tell it, mostly I must tell it, sometimes I tell it
because I like to hear it, sometimes I have to tell it to loose
myself from it. This one was one that I knew then and I made this
one know it. I told it then to loose myself from it. Mostly very
slowly each one I know comes to be a whole one to me, mostly I tell
it then because I like to hear it, sometimes I write it, sometimes
I tell some one else, not then, about it. Mostly I tell it and I
write it, mostly I tell it or I write it, there are many that I
know and they know it. Mostly in some way I tell it.</p>

<p>This one then very soon knew it, very soon then I had had to
tell it. This is now some more description of it.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and they know it, they are all of
them repeating and I hear it, sometimes I tell it, mostly I tell
it, there are many that I know, they are all of them repeating and
I hear it, sometimes I see a whole being in it, sometime, always, I
see the whole being in it. There are many that I know and they know
it, sometimes they soon know it, sometimes I soon tell it,
sometimes I wait a long time to tell it, sometimes I slowly tell
it. There are many that I know and mostly always sometime they know
it.</p>

<p>There are many that I know, they are all of them repeating and I
see it, feel it, hear it. Always I listen to it and look at it and
feel it, sometime always I understand it. There are many that I
know and they know it, sometime each one is a whole one to me,
mostly then I tell it, sometimes it is a long time before I tell
it, sometimes I tell it as soon as I know it, sometimes I begin to
tell it before I really know it, sometimes I tell it puzzling at
it, sometimes I slowly tell it. There are many ways then of
learning the whole one each one is from the repeating always coming
out of each one. There are many ways of telling it to each one what
is the whole of them, there are many ways of telling it about them
what is the whole being in each one. Sometime, then, each one is a
whole one to me, I was just now beginning telling about one. As I
was saying this one was not one I ever thought about or felt before
I knew this one as a whole one. This is interesting then as one way
of learning. This was interesting then as a way of telling for then
this one possessed me by my feeling the whole being that made all
this one's repeating and I had to tell this one the whole being
that was the whole of this one, the whole meaning of the repeating
that was the being of this one so as to free myself from the
possession this one's whole being being inside me then had of me.
This now is to be a little more description of the being in this
one and the feeling in me in learning the whole being of this one
and the meaning of the repeating of this one and the telling of my
knowing it and what I knew, to this one.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and they know it. This time I knew it
and suffered in it and was possessed by it, the knowledge of it,
and I told it to this one to free myself from it. This is a little
more description of my knowing it and of my telling it, and some
description of what I knew and what I told of the whole being in
this one always coming out as repeating from this one.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and they know it. This one I knew
quickly and then I told it and then this one knew it and this is
now a little history of all of it.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of men and women and I know it, each one is
a real one to me, each one sometimes is a whole one to me, they
repeat it and I hear it and I see it and I feel it, each one
sometime is a whole one to me, sometime, always, I tell it.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of men and women and I know it, always I
know some of it, always more and more I know more of it. There are
many that I know and they know it. There are many that I know and
sometime I tell it, somehow, somewhere, all of it.</p>

<p>There are many then now that I know, there are many then now
that know I know it. Every one always is repeating the whole of
them. Every one sometimes is a whole one to me.</p>

<p>Always then I have known some, more and more I know more of
them, more of men and women, more and more then always I know of
the kinds there are of them.</p>

<p>Every one has their own being in them, every one always is
repeating the whole of them, they repeat it and I hear it and
sometimes I get a whole one inside me from listening, looking
feeling it. Sometimes I quickly understand it, sometimes I quickly
tell it. This is now a history of the way some one did it, this is
now a history of the way I understood it, this is now a history of
the way I told this one the whole of it, the whole repeating always
coming out of this one and the meaning of it, the being in it.</p>

<p>Sometimes then I know many things of some one, always I am
knowing more and more of such a one, this one is not ever then
puzzling to me, everything is interesting, all is some history of
some one but sometimes there is no interest in me to see a whole to
some one, I go on knowing things of them, I talk and hear and
remember all about such a one, there is no puzzling in me about
such a one then for I am not then interested in understanding,
there is a whole to such a one yes, there is sometime to me a whole
to every one, I am seeing, hearing, feeling things and remembering
things of such a one, there is no problem, no puzzled feeling about
such a one then to me. This one then that I am now beginning a
little to describe farther was such a one to me. I knew many things
about this one, I remembered, I heard many things that were
interesting, that were amusing, I remembered them, there was in me
then no puzzling, there was nothing of a whole being in all of them
to me, but I was not thinking of the whole being in them, they were
interesting things to know about some one, everything is
interesting to know about any one, everything is important to know
about every one, but I was never puzzling about this one. All the
things I knew were interesting I was not feeling any need of a
whole being in this one, and then once I looked hard at this one
and then there was a whole being always afterwards repeating to
every one from this one after my telling all the being in this one,
the whole being in this one, and this is very interesting.</p>

<p>Always then I listen and come back again and again to listen to
every one. Always then I am thinking and feeling the repeating in
every one. Sometimes it happens that I have a complete history of
some one, of the meaning of all the repeating in them the first
time I look hard at them, mostly this is in me a slow thing,
learning understanding, mostly I come back again and again to
listen to the repeating in every one before they are a whole one,
before there is to me a whole history of the being in them. Always
I come back again and again, it has happened that sometimes I have
had the whole history of some one the first time I looked long at
them, mostly this is a slow thing, always even when understanding
happens like with this one the first time of hard looking, always,
then I go back again and again to listen, to fill in, to be
certain. This then was what happened to this one in my learning,
this is now a little a description.</p>

<p>The nature in this one was not like any of those I have been
just describing. Everybody who knew this one knew everything, there
was no deceiving of any one by this one, everything in this one
always was repeating to every one who ever listened to this one,
and this one was not made up of pieces and none of the pieces
dominating, this one had a very real bottom, a very real domination
inside that one of that one's own being, the thing with this one
was to understand the meaning of the repeating all the repeating
this one was always doing. What was important was to have applied
to this one completed understanding. This one was not puzzling
really to any one, this one had nothing of the nature of the being
that was always coming out as repeating hidden, it was all there,
all always repeating, all always being dominated by the bottom
being and all that then was needed was to understand the meaning,
that was very interesting, that was what I did by one hard looking.
This is now a little more description of this one.</p>

<p>This one then as I was saying had it to have as being really the
nature as dominating and every one that looked at or listened to or
felt this one knew all of the repeating always telling over and
over again all of the history of this one. This time then it was a
question of understanding the meaning of the being in one.</p>

<p>This now is very interesting in relation to the being in this
one, whose learning, in me, I am soon now to be describing.</p>

<p>There was then in the first one I was describing, all of the
being always repeating but all the repeating any one knowing this
one ever was hearing, feeling, seeing could be understood as
meaning that this one was always giving all her loving to every one
and always there was no place for her in living, always there was
no place for her in living. Always every one felt this in her and
always every one was explaining there being no place for such a one
in living by specific good reasoning, always dimly every one had a
little a puzzled feeling, always every one, really every one who
ever knew this one was really sympathising, really believing
because all of it was really there always repeating.</p>

<p>Slowly then this one came to be a whole one in me. As I have
said in writing, often, for many years some one is baffling, the
repeated hearing of them does not make the completed being they
have in them to any one. Sometimes many years pass in listening to
repeating in such a one and the being of them is not a completed
history to any one then listening to them, sometime then it comes
out of them a louder repeating of that which before was not clear
to anybody's hearing and then such a one is a completed being to
some one listening to the repeating coming out of such a one, there
is then to some one a complete history of such a one, this mostly
comes slowly to the one who is learning the being of such a one,
this was the history of learning the first one that I have been
describing.</p>

<p>The third one then of whose learning I am beginning now a
description, this third one then I have been a little describing
was very different from this first one, every one who ever knew or
saw or heard of this one always knew all the repeating always
coming out of this one, all the complete history of this one. No
one ever knowing this one did not know all the repeating in this
one but always there was in no one a complete understanding of the
meaning of the being in this one, and this is now to be some
description, description of the being in this one, description of
the learning of the meaning of the being in this one, description
of the telling of the knowing of the meaning in this one.</p>

<p>As I was saying the first one I was describing always had then
to every one the very best reason for there being no place for this
one ever for living, no place ever for this one in living. This
last one, the one I am now describing has with this first one some
connection, always then this last one always had the best reasons
for not realising the living being in living and every one always
was always helping and no one ever was understanding for every one
always was convinced of the good reasons this one had for not being
able to realise real being in living and always this one was trying
and always every one who saw this one was helping and this now is
very interesting.</p>

<p>As I was saying always every one knew the whole repeating of
this last one, every one who ever knew this one really knew all the
repeating coming out of this one, always then it was a question of
meaning to make of this one a whole one inside one.</p>

<p>Every one always is repeating the whole of them, some to every
one who knows any one of such of them, some one repeating the whole
of them so that every one who knows them hears the whole repeating
in them. The important thing then with such a one for every one as
I was saying knows with such a one that they are hearing all the
repeating coming out of such a one, the important thing then with
such a one so as to get such a one to be a whole one to any one
seeing, feeding, hearing such a one, the important thing then is
hearing, feeling, seeing all the repeating coming out from such a
one is to realise the meaning of the being, it is not enough to
realise all the repeating in such a one.</p>

<p>This one that I have commenced describing had in being going at
the same time asking and refusing, infinite tenacity in holding on
to anything that was there to this one's seizing, always not really
wanting what was being held so grimly by this one. Always then
there was denying in this one, mostly one thinks of fundamental
denying as skepticism, as evil acting, this was not so of this one,
denying and trying holding with tenacious gripping was always there
in this one. Always then every one who ever knew this one knew this
as always repeating, tenacity in holding, desiring believing in
religion, always every one who ever knew this one saw these always
coming out as repeating, no one seeing it come out of this one as
repeating had any realisation that always it led to denying, always
to negation, that grasping and asking, opening and closing could
not be the same movement in action without ending in denying
everything, and both being completed expression of this being and
always together there repeating and so neither coming to be really
existing there was not in this one consciousness of struggling,
always it was in this one then as denying always then there was in
this one no reality of experiencing, never any stopping gripping to
be asking, never stopping asking to be steadily gripping, always
asking and gripping in the same repeating, always so ending in
denying. The spirit of denying that comes to be the whole of such a
one, there can be in such a one no real experiencing, a hand cannot
be closed and open, it ends in such a one denying that a hand is
really existing.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one always is repeating the whole of them.
Every one is repeating the whole of them, such repeating is then
always in them and so sometime some one who sees them will have a
complete understanding of the whole of each one of them, will have
a completed history of every man and every woman they ever came to
know in their living, every man and every woman who were or are or
will be living, every man and every woman in each one's beginning,
middle and ending, every man and every woman then who were or are
or will be living whom such a one can come to know in living.</p>

<p>Every one always is repeating the whole of them. This one that I
am now describing always was repeating the whole being as every one
always is doing. This one was not like the first one I was
describing then, every one who knew this one heard, felt and saw
all the being in this one always repeating, nothing of important
being in this one was not loudly repeating.</p>

<p>As I was saying I knew all the repeating in this one mostly from
other people's telling, no one ever was understanding the meaning
in the repeating, no one then was understanding the reason of this
one never really realising being, never winning anything this one
ever was really wanting. Every one, as I was saying was hearing,
feeling and seeing clearly all the repeating there ever was to be
ever coming out of this one to any one. There was never then in
this one any repeating that every one who was ever hearing,
feeling, seeing this one did not feel and see and hear in this one
always all through their knowing this one. This one then mostly did
not give to any one a puzzling feeling, everything was clear in
this one to every one, everything in this one was clearly repeating
to every one who ever was really listening, to every one who was
hearing, seeing, feeling the repeating coming out of this one, the
important thing then was understanding the meaning in the being of
this one, always every one was hearing, feeling, seeing all the
repeating there ever was in this one, it was seeing the meaning of
all the being in this one that was interesting and this came to me
then in one very hard looking at this one.</p>

<p>Always then sometime each one comes to be a whole one in me,
always then sometimes every one is a whole one to me. Everybody
always then sometime is a real one to me. Every one then has always
sometime their own being in them to me. Sometime then every one is
a whole one to me, sometime then every one has a complete history
for me. Always then sometime each one is a whole one to me.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one who ever came to know this one really
knew all the repeating in this one, no repeating in this one was
not sounding loudly to every one whoever came to know this one. As
I was saying I knew then all the repeating in this one a little
from every one's telling, mostly it was not puzzling, every one
evidently had been hearing all the repeating there ever was coming
out of this one. As I was saying it was interesting but not
overwhelmingly interesting for it was not puzzling, every one knew
all the repeating in this one, the wanting in this one of
believing, the desire of having believing, the tenacity in gripping
everything this one ever was having, the feeling in this one for
wanting everything with goodness in it, the not realising anything,
every one then who ever knew this one knew the eagerness of
desiring, the lack of succeeding, the tenacity in holding on to all
possessing, every one then knew all these always repeating in this
one, always it was in every one describing this one a describing of
all these things in this one, there was then never any realising of
how these things came to be this one, every one always was helping
this one for always to every one there were such good reasons why
this one should have much helping, some always were trying to loose
the hold on possession, others always were trying to strengthen to
desiring faith and goodness, always every one was helping, always
no one was understanding that a little even very much strengthening
of wanting believing or a little even very much weakening of
holding possession of gripping could never in such a one have any
real meaning, for always at the bottom this one was gripping and
asking, always this one was opening and shutting the hands at the
same instant of being and that always would make denying the only
real thing in such a one's being, nothing else could ever really
happen, never could there come the miracle of simultaneous opening
and gripping. It is clear then now to every one.</p>

<p>It is clear then now to every one that every one who ever was
knowing this one always was hearing, seeing, feeling all the
repeating in this one, always then the important thing was
understanding the being always repeating, realising denying as the
real being in this one.</p>

<p>As I was saying then I knew all the repeating in this one, a
little from my own listening to this one, mostly from other
people's descriptions of this one. I knew then all the repeating in
this one, it was interesting to know the repeating in this one, all
repeating of any one is interesting to any one having loving
repeating being, having loving repeating being to completed
understanding as being. Always then as I was saying repeating is
interesting to me, always then I was interested in all the
repeating of this one, it was interesting but it was not then a
problem to me, this one then was interesting, not so very
interesting to me, and then as I was saying I met this one and then
I began and then all the repeating in this one had meaning. This
one then was to me at the end of looking the complete thing to me
that every one sometime is to me. This one was then a complete one
to me, this one was then a solemn load inside me. This is now then
a little more description of my knowing this one as a complete one
and then of my telling of my knowing to this one.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one always is repeating the whole of them.
As I was saying sometimes it takes many years of hearing the
repeating in one before the whole being is clear to the
understanding of one who has it as being to love repeating, to know
that always every one is repeating the whole of them, to have it
that sometime each one is a whole one to that one. These then the
ways I have been describing are some of the ways then that such a
one, one who has it as being to love repeating, to know that always
every one is repeating the whole of them, comes to a completed
understanding of every one.</p>

<p>Sometimes then as I was saying it takes many years of hearing
and seeing and feeling the repeating in some one before the whole
being of that one is clear to my understanding. This then was not
the way of my learning this last one as a whole being. As I was
saying I knew all the repeating in this one, every one who knew
this one knew all the repeating in this one. I had never felt it a
puzzle in this one, I had not had that kind of interest in this one
and then it happened that I saw this one and then it happened that
I looked hard at this one and then this one was a whole one to me,
this one was a depressing solemn load inside me, then I had this
one inside me and this one was to me inside me a being having
damnation as the way of being and this then was a new thing in me,
damnation had not had before any meaning for me, this one was not
an evil one, a wicked one, but a damned one to me, this one was
then a whole one inside me. This is now to be a little more
description of this one in me and of my telling it to this one.</p>

<p>This one was then a whole one to me, this one was then a solemn
saddening load inside me, not from evil or conviction or from
willing or from reasoning but from asking and gripping in the same
breath of being and both being complete expression of a being and
so neither really having meaning to such a being not making really
in side such a one any struggling.</p>

<p>This one then after this one hard looking was a whole one to me,
was a whole solemn load inside me. This one then always was
repeating to me the whole being in that one, the resulting to such
a one of suffering damning. This one was then a whole one to me.
This one was then a whole one inside me, was as a solemn load
inside me.</p>

<p>Each one is then sometime a whole one to me, this one was then a
whole one in me was a solemn saddening load inside me, gave to me
the first meaning there ever was to me of the meaning of damning in
all human religion, was a very serious solemn load inside me, and a
ways it was there inside me this one as a whole one in me and
always this one was repeating to me the whole being, the whole
history of this one and a ways it had meaning and always then it
was to me the compelling of me to understand the reason there is in
damning, this denying and never having any realisation of anything
really existing was to me a state of really suffering damning. This
one then was as I was saying a whole one then inside me, a whole
one to me after the ending of that looking, a serious solemn
saddening whole one in me, and always more and more I was seeing,
hearing, feeling this one repeating the whole being there was in
this one and always then it was to my completed understanding the
completed spirit of suffering damning, that was then the whole of
this one.</p>

<p>Always then this one was a whole one to me. As I was saying each
one sometimes is a whole one to me, sometime one always is a whole
one to me, I am never losing the feeling of such a one being a
whole one inside me. This one always was a whole one to me, always
then I was seeing, feeling, hearing all the repeating coming out of
this one, always then this one was a solemn load inside me.</p>

<p>As I was saying there are many that I know and I know it, there
are many that I know and they know it, they are many that I know
and I tell it. There are many that I know and I know it, there are
many that I know and they know it, there are many that I know and I
tell it, I know it and I tell it, they repeat it and I see it, and
I hear it and I feel it and I tell it. Always then there are many
that I know and to some of them I tell it. This one was then a
whole one to me, this one then was a whole one inside me, I know it
and I tell it, I knew it and I told it and this is now some
description of my then telling of it.</p>

<p>This one was then a whole one inside me. Always sometime each
one is a whole one to me, always sometime I tell it to some one the
whole one each one sometime is to me. Always then sometime each one
is a whole one to me, each one then sometime is a complete one to
me, a complete one there inside me, always sometime then I have
each one as a whole one always sometime then I tell it to some one,
very often I tell it to that one the one that is a whole one then
in me.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and always more and more I know it.
They are all of them sometime a whole one to me. More and more I
understand it. They are all of them repeating and I hear it, they
are all of them always repeating the whole of them and always more
and more I know them. There are many that I know and they know it.
They are all of them always repeating the whole of them and I
understand it. They are, each one of them sometime a whole one to
me, they are all of them, always then, repeating the whole of them
and I know it and I understand it. I know it and I tell it. Always
sometime I tell it. Mostly always when it is complete in me I tell
it.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and I know it. They are repeating
always the whole of them and I understand it. They are, each one
then, sometime a whole one to me. I know it and I tell it. Mostly,
when it is complete in me, I tell it.</p>

<p>Mostly, then when it is entirely, completely in me, the whole of
them, and I know it, then I tell it. Mostly always I tell it,
mostly I tell it to that one who is a whole one then inside me,
sometimes I just tell it to any one who will listen to it. Mostly
then when any one is entirely completely in me, mostly always then
I tell it.</p>

<p>This is now then a little a description of my telling of it. As
I was saying mostly always when some one is entirely and completely
a whole one to me, I know it and I tell it, sometimes I tell it to
that one that is then entirely and completely a whole one inside me
to me, sometimes I tell it to any one who will listen to it.</p>

<p>Always then I tell it, always then when any one is completely a
whole one to me, mostly always then I tell it. This is now some
description of one time of telling it, telling it to that one who
just was then a whole one to me.</p>

<p>As I was saying each one is sometime a whole one to me, is a
whole one inside me, each one then sometimes gives to me a sense of
being filled up inside me with that one, then a whole one inside
me. Each one then is sometime a whole one in me, I know it and I
tell it, I am filled up then with that whole one inside me and I
tell it and then it settles down inside me to always hearing it
repeating in such a one, filling in and changing and being a
completer and completer history of that one and always then it is
quietly there in me and I like it. Sometimes it is disturbed in me
and again completely fills me and then again it settles down in me.
Then again it is quietly there in me and I always like it. Always I
am then learning more and more the history of that one, always more
and more there is then meaning in all the repeating coming out of
that one but there is then not so much need in me to tell it, it is
then steady pleasant, sometimes exciting, learning in me and always
I enjoy it but then it is quieter inside me and I am then not all
filled up with it and so then though always often I tell it, all of
it, pieces of it to any one who will listen to it, I am not then
all filled up with it and I can then really be without really
needing to tell it, I can then get along without really then ever
telling it.</p>

<p>As I was saying each one sometime is a whole one to me. As I was
saying mostly when it is complete to me and I first really know it,
really and completely and filled up with it then I tell it. Mostly
then I have to tell it. Mostly then I am filled up with it and it
comes out of me then as telling it, sometimes to the one that is
then a whole one to me, sometimes then to any one who will then
listen to me.</p>

<p>There are many then that I know and sometime each one comes to
be a whole one in me, sometime then each one then a whole one
inside me fills me, sometime then I know that one and sometime then
I tell it the whole one that I then know that I know as a whole one
as a whole being then. Always then more and more I know that one,
always then more and more I hear and feel and see all the repeating
coming out of them, always I am telling everything, more and more I
tell everything, always I tell it when I come completely to know it
the being in one, when I come completely to understand, when they
are a whole one inside me and I am filled up with it.</p>

<p>Mostly always when it is once complete in me I tell it, always
often, more and more I know it, always often, I very often tell it,
always when it is once complete in me I have to tell it, I am
filled up then with it, telling it is then always in me, always
then I tell it. This is then a little a description of one telling
of it.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and always sometime I tell it.
Sometimes I slowly tell it, sometimes I tell it and then more and
more I tell it, sometimes I tell it and then slowly I keep on with
telling of it. There are many ways of telling it. Sometimes I tell
it when I am still puzzling with it. Mostly always when it is
complete in me I tell it. Mostly then I learn more and more the
meaning in it, often then slowly I tell more and more of it. Mostly
when it is complete in me once and I am all filled up with that one
then I have to tell it. Sometimes then I tell it to any one who
will listen to it. Sometimes then I tell it to the one who is then
a whole one inside me, I am filled with that one then as a whole
one and to that one then I tell it.</p>

<p>As I was saying this one that I have been just describing was a
whole one to me, a serious solemn filling inside me. This one was
then complete in me, this one was then a serious solemn filling in
me, always then this one was in me suffering damning from the being
in this one and this was a new realisation in me and so then this
was complete then inside me, this one then being a whole one inside
me, this one then completely filling rue inside me, I knew it then
and I told it then, I told it then to this one.</p>

<p>As I was saying then each one sometime is a whole one to me,
each one sometime is a whole one inside me. Mostly then I tell it
to some one. This one then came after one hard looking to be a
whole one inside me. I was then all filled up with this one. I told
it then to this one the whole meaning of all the being in this
one.</p>

<p>As I was saying I know many women and many men. I know many of
them as babies, as children as growing men and growing women as
grown men and grown women as growing old men and growing old women,
as grown old men and grown old women, and every kind of being they
ever have in them. I know many then of them very many of them and
sometime each one is a whole one to me, each one is a whole one
inside me, each one then has real meaning for me. Sometime then
each one is a whole one to me, sometime then each one of them has a
whole history of each one for me. Everything then they do in living
is clear then to me, their living, loving, eating, pleasing,
smoking, scolding, drinking, dancing, thinking, working, walking,
talking, laughing, sleeping, suffering, joking, everything in them.
There are whole beings then, they are themselves inside them to me.
They are then, each one, a whole one inside me. Repeating of the
whole of them always coming out of each one of them makes a history
always of each one of them always to me.</p>

<p>There are many then that I know, and I know it, I know it and
mostly always sometime I tell it. Each one sometimes is a whole one
to me, always sometime I know it, mostly always sometime I tell it.
Mostly when I am full up with it I tell it, I know it, I am full up
with it and I tell it.</p>

<p>This one then the one I have been just describing was a whole
one inside me when the meaning of the being in this one was a clear
meaning to me, I was full up then with this one inside me, I was
full up then with this one, I would tell it then to almost any one
who would listen, I would tell it then to this one the one that was
a whole one then inside me, the one then filling me all up inside
me. I knew then the meaning in this one, the meaning in this one
was a complete thing and then I told it to this one.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and I know it, there are many that I
know and there are some of them to whom I tell it that I know it.
This then was one of them then. I knew it and I told. This one was
then a whole one to me and I told it then to this one.</p>

<p>Mostly always then each one I am ever knowing sometime,
sometimes is a whole one to me, mostly always then when I know it,
the whole being of some one, I tell it and sometimes I tell it to
that one. Mostly then when I am filled up with it, the whole
meaning of the whole being of some one, I tell it. I know it and I
tell it. I am filled full then with it and I tell it. Mostly always
then I tell it when I am filled up full with the whole meaning of
the whole being of some one, I know it and I have to tell it, often
I tell it to any one who will listen to it, sometimes I have to
tell it to that one whose whole being then having meaning as a
whole one to me is then filling me full up with it.</p>

<p>I know then sometime the whole being of every one I am ever
knowing and always sometime, often sometimes I tell it. Mostly
always when I am filled up full with it I tell it, sometimes I have
to tell it, sometimes I like to tell it, sometimes I keep on with
telling it.</p>

<p>I know it and I tell it, this is now some description of the
ways of telling it, of the need of telling it, of telling it to any
one who will listen to it, of telling it to the one whose being I
am then understanding.</p>

<p>Always sometime every one I am ever knowing is a whole one
inside me. Always then sometime I know the meaning of the whole
being of every one I am ever knowing. Sometime, then I know it,
sometime then I tell it. There are many ways of knowing, as I have
been telling, there are many ways of telling. Always then when I
come to know the whole meaning of any one, that one is then there
inside me. I am more or less filled up then with that one,
sometimes I am filled up so full with that one that I must tell it
then to every one, sometimes I am filled up so full with that one
that I must then certainly tell it to that one. There are many
different ways then of feeling knowing inside one. Mostly always
sometime I must tell it of each one to some one, sometimes I must
tell it of some one to every one, sometimes to many and not then to
that one filling me then, sometimes I must tell it to many and to
that one, sometimes I must tell it mostly to that one. It is all a
very complicated condition having knowing any one inside in one.
Mostly always I sometime tell it to some one. Mostly when I am
filled up with some one I tell it then to that one and to others
then, sometimes I never tell it to that one, mostly sometime I do
tell it to that one. Mostly then sometime each one I am ever
knowing is a whole one in me, mostly sometime I tell it to that
one, sometimes I tell it very little, sometimes very slowly to that
one, sometimes very gently, sometimes very completely, sometimes
very quickly, sometimes very greatly, sometimes just in little
pieces to some, sometimes all but a little of it to some one.
Always then sometime each one is a whole one in me, mostly always I
tell it sometime to that one. Sometimes then I have to tell it when
I am all filled up with it, sometimes then I tell it to rid myself
a little of it, sometimes because I am so full of it it keeps
pouring out of me all the time when I am first having it. This was
then the way I was filled full of it after looking at and so
understanding the last one I have been describing. I was filled
full up with it, I knew it and I told it, I told it to this one,
the one whose being as meaning made me then all full of that one
then inside me, I was knowing it then, I was then all full up with
it, I was then full up to the telling of it. This is now the
history of that.</p>

<p>Being filled up with some one who then is a whole one inside one
is to some a natural way of being. Knowing and telling is to some
their natural way of complete being. This is now some description
of one of such of them.</p>

<p>Knowing and telling then is to some their natural way of
complete being. This has been some description of one of such of
them.</p>

<p>Always then sometime each one is a whole one to me, always then
I am listening to, looking at, feeling the whole being always then
repeating in each one, always then I am knowing the meaning of the
nature or natures in each one, always then I am telling the meaning
of the being in each one.</p>

<p>Hearing, feeling, seeing all repeating coming out of any one I
am ever knowing, knowing sometime the meaning of the being in every
one I am ever knowing that is having sometime each one I am ever
knowing a whole one to me, hearing, seeing, feeling then always all
the repeating coming out of every one I am ever knowing,
understanding sometime the meaning of the being in every one, being
sometime filled up full with the whole being in each one I am ever
knowing, being sometime then full up with the complete being of
each one I am ever knowing, being full up with it with the
completed knowing of it, being fuller and fuller with it, being
sometime all filled up with it, filled up completely with it,
filled up full with it sometimes to the quick telling of it,
sometimes to the slow telling of it, sometimes slowly filling up
with it, sometimes more sometimes less quickly being filled full up
with it is all always sometimes in me. Always then sometime each
one is a whole one to me, always then sometime each one I am ever
knowing is a whole one inside me, always then sometime I am filled
full with each one then a complete one every one I am ever knowing,
always then sometime I am filled full with each one I am ever
knowing as a whole one then inside me, always then I am filled full
with some one filled full of the meaning of one then filling me
full up with that one then, full up to the point of telling the
meaning of that one sometimes to every one sometimes only to some,
sometimes to that, one the one that is then the complete filling of
me, and always then sometime then there is a complete understanding
of each one I am ever knowing, and always sometime there is coming
out of me some telling of all the knowing being in me, sometimes it
comes out of me I am filled full of knowing and it bursts out from
me, sometimes it comes very slowly from me, sometimes it comes
sharply from me, sometimes it comes out of me to amuse me,
sometimes it comes out of me as a way of doing a duty for me,
sometimes it comes brilliantly out of me, sometimes it comes as a
way of playing by me, sometimes it comes very slowly, sometimes it
comes very repeatingly, sometimes very willingly out of me,
sometimes not very willingly, always then it comes out of me. I
know many men and women, know them in many stages of their being.
Always more and more I know them, I know them and mostly I tell
them, always then more and more I know them, I know them and mostly
I tell them. There are many then that I know and they know it. I
know them, I know the repeating of themselves always coming out of
them, I know them and mostly I tell them, always more and more I
know I know them, always more and more they know I know it, I know
it and I tell it, this is now some history of it. To begin again
then with knowing it the being in some one and telling it, telling
it to that one. To begin again with the knowing of that one, the
last one I was describing and the telling it to that one.</p>

<p>Always then I am telling to some one all the being in some.
There are many that I know and I know it, always then I am telling
some one it. Always then I am telling some one all the being in
some, sometime then I am telling to all of them all the being in
every one. Always then I am telling to some one all the being in
some one. Always then sometime I am telling all the being in every
one to every one. All the time then I am telling all the being in
each one I am ever knowing to some one, all the time then I am
knowing some one, all the time then I am telling that to some one,
sometimes to that one, mostly always sometime to some one.</p>

<p>Mostly always then I am learning to know some one, mostly always
then I am telling some one the being in some one. Mostly then I am
learning some one, mostly then I am knowing some one, mostly then I
am telling some one. So then this is in me living being, learning,
knowing and telling and mostly then all three of them are always in
me mostly always. This then is living being in some, learning,
knowing, telling, this then as I was saying is living being in many
of them always living, this is now a little a description of it in
one.</p>

<p>So then to begin again with learning, knowing and telling.
Mostly then there is mostly always keeping going learning, knowing,
telling in my being. Always then as I was saying loving repeating
is always there in me as being, always then as I was saying
sometime each one I am ever knowing is a whole one to me, always
then, as I was saying, knowing all the being in some one is always
coming to be in me keeping going there inside me, always then as I
was saying knowing some one is filling me all up inside me, always
then I am telling some one all the knowing there is then in me.</p>

<p>This then a way of being, learning, knowing, telling, this is
then the being in me. There has been much writing of listening to
repeating, of hearing, feeling, seeing, knowing all repeating, of
feeling knowing each one sometime as a whole one, now then there is
a little waiting of the telling of the knowing always in me.</p>

<p>So then always every one is repeating the whole of them, always
then sometime each one I am ever knowing is a whole one to me,
mostly always then I am telling my complete knowing of each one to
some one, often I am telling it to that one, the one whose complete
being is then completely filling me then there inside me. This is
now a little description of such telling to one.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one who ever knew this last one knew all
the repeating ever in this one, ever coming out of this one, always
then this one was really not giving to any one any really puzzling
feeling, always then I knew all the repeating every one knew in
this one and always coming out of this one, always then I never had
any puzzling feeling about this one. Every one really then knew all
the repeating ever coming out of this one, every one then who ever
was knowing this one knew all the being in this one, mostly then no
one could have about this one any puzzling feeling, no one felt any
puzzling feeling then about this one, every one who ever knew this
one knew all the being that ever came out of this one as repeating,
no one then had about this one a puzzling feeling, every one only
knew that this one found no meaning in the living of this one's
being. There are always many such men and women. Mostly then no one
found this one puzzling, this one was greedily seizing and humbly
asking, this one was tenaciously gripping and never getting
holding, this one was always close-fisting and always opening the
hand in imploring begging. Many then are of such a kind of them but
mostly asking and seizing in most of them are really in being in
them, in this one they made up a complete denying, nothing then in
this one was really being.</p>

<p>As I was saying every one who was ever knowing this one knew
always all the repeating always coming out of this one, all the
frenzied seizing all the pitiful asking, mostly then every one who
ever was knowing this one thought about it in this one as these
being in this one in contradiction, in many these ways of being are
making a contradiction, in many all these ways of being are really
vital being in them, in this one it was a different thing from the
others having contradictory being in them, in this one it was a
negation of real being, it was the real spirit of denying in this
one. Every one then as I was saying every one who ever came to know
this one always knew all the repeating that ever was coming out of
this one, every one then knew the being in this one, no one then
had any puzzling feeling about this one, no one then knew the
meaning of the being in this one. This one then at the end of
looking came to be a whole one to me, there was not really ever any
puzzling feeling in me about this one, I came then sometime to look
at this one, this one became then completely to me a whole one,
this one then was a whole one to me, this one then was a whole one
inside me, I knew it and the knowing of it filled me, I knew it
then the meaning in this one, I was filled full then more and more
with the being in this one, more and more then I knew it inside me,
more and more then it filled me, I knew it then and more and more
then it filled me and then it came to possess me, it was then a
complete filling of me there inside me the being in this one, I
knew it then and soon I told it to this one, I knew it then and I
told it to myself and then more and more I knew it and more and
more I told it and then more and more I knew it and then I told it
to that one, more and more then I told it to that one, always more
and more then I told it to that one.</p>

<p>Always then sometime each one is a whole one to me, always then
sometime each one is more or less filling me up inside me, always
then sometime I tell it all more or less to some one, very often I
tell it all more or less to that one. This one then was a whole one
to me, this one was then completely a filling up inside me, more
and more then the knowing of the meaning in this being was in me
there completely as a filling to me there inside me, more and more
then I knew the meaning in all the repeating always coming out of
this one, soon then I told it to this one, always then more and
more I told it to this one.</p>

<p>Kinds and ways of being, kinds and ways of having being coming
out in repeating, many of them are very clear in kinds of men and
women, in individual men and women. Realising kinds and ways in
being, learning in being, thinking to feeling, realising meaning in
being, realising way and kinds of sensitiveness and emotion,
meaning of stupidness in being, ways of knowing, ways of telling,
ways of being resembling, all these always are in me filling me
with seeing, feeling, learning understanding, filling me sometime
to telling.</p>

<p>It came then that I heard the meaning of the being in that one,
that was to me then a real thing, the meaning of the being that was
all the being in this one. I heard it then, more and more I knew it
in all the ways it was in this one in all the ways it did and had
and would come out of this one, the being in this one. Sometime
then all history of this one will be complete to some one. Always
then the repeating in this one was forming in me as a complete
history of this one.</p>

<p>There was then this one, there will then be sometime a complete
history of this one, perhaps there will be a complete history of
this one in some one, perhaps never really inside any one. Each one
sometime is a whole one to me, then I am hearing or feeling or
seeing some repeating coming out of that one that makes a completer
one of that one, always then there may be sometimes more history of
that one, there may then be never a whole history of any one inside
any one. Mostly then that is a melancholy feeling in some that
there is not a complete history of every one in some one. Slowly
then that feeling is discouraging to one loving having a whole
history of every one inside in one. Perhaps slowly then there is
really in such a one more and more knowing of the meaning in each
one that one is ever knowing. Always then for such a one there must
be many new beginnings. Always then for such a one there must be a
feeling that that one such a one is then knowing is a whole one,
always each one is a whole one, always each one has a whole history
of them always coining out of them, sometime some one will have in
them a whole history of each one. Always then more and more each
one sometime is a whole one and then sometime it is hard to hold
this one as a whole one inside one and then the one having knowing
each one that one is ever knowing as a whole one as the way of
having living being in that one, such a one having the whole one
that that one is having inside then of some one come to pieces in
them, have new repeating in them, have new meaning in them, always
then sometime the one having knowing each one they are ever knowing
as a whole one as the living being in that one, such a one then
sometimes is having all a wrong meaning to the being of some one
then seeming to be a real right whole one then inside that one and
always then there is sorrowing feeling in such a one and always
then there is new beginning in such a one and always then there is
struggling in such a one to make that one then inside them as a
whole one give up in them the wrong whole meaning and to keep in
them all the repeating that really was in that one this one then
was thinking knowing as a whole one. Sometime then each one is a
whole one to me, sometimes then there is a real complete one there
inside me, sometime then I know something, mostly then I begin
again, always then I am feeling, seeing, hearing all the repeating
coming out of any one I am ever knowing, sometimes I am telling the
whole feeling I have in the whole being of some one I am then
knowing and having then as completely filling all my being, and
then I am beginning again with more knowing and more and more then
that one I am then knowing has for me then meaning.</p>

<p>This one then that I was last describing and then describing the
meaning in the being in that one and then describing the telling of
the meaning of the being in that one to that one, that one then
knew then the meaning of the being in that one; that one always
like every one that ever knew that one always knew, had always
known all the repeating always coming out of the being in the
living of that one, now that one knew the meaning of the being that
made that one and it was a very serious feeling knowing that that
was the meaning of the being, that denying was the meaning of the
being in that one, that always there was in that one no way of ever
realising real feeling, real being, that always it made up into
denying. This one then knew the meaning of that being, I had told
it to this one as I was saying, this was then in this one the first
moment in the being of this one that was not denying. This is clear
then, it was clear then to that one, it was to that one giving up
asking, it was to that one then loosening gripping. This one had
then a revelation, this one then had a new beginning.</p>

<p>This then happened to this one, this one then had a real
realisation of the being in this one and that was the beginning in
this one of realising living, that was the beginning in this one of
a being that was not in its meaning denying. This then came as a
religion, this then came as a revelation, this one was then not
asking and had the feeling of having been given living, this one
was not asking and was receiving, this one had loosened gripping
and so a little the hand was open to receiving, this was then the
first being in this one that was not denying. By and by there was
more changing. There will be now then more description.</p>

<p>Slowly then there was in this one increasing realisation of real
being. As I was saying this one not asking had the moment of
receiving, loosening gripping had a little the power of accepting,
slowly then this came to be the new meaning of the being always
there in this one.</p>

<p>This one had then a new beginning, always then from then on this
one was changing, always then this one was repeating, always then
knowing this one seeing, feeling, hearing the repeating coming out
of this one, always then I was knowing more and more all the
meaning there ever was or could or would be in this one in the
being that was all the being in this one, always then this one was
a whole one there inside me, always then I was knowing the complete
meaning in the being in this one, always then this one was
repeating all the being in this one, always then there was changing
in this one and always there was in this one the being that every
one who ever knew this one always knew as coming out of this one
and always repeating.</p>

<p>As I was saying this one then knew the meaning of the being in
this one making a denying in this one of everything, I knew it from
looking at this one, I knew it then and I was filled up then with
this one, I knew it and then I was telling it to this one and
always more and more I was telling it to this one and then this one
was knowing the meaning of the being always repeating in this one
and then there was in this one a beginning, there was then in this
one real despairing, there was then in this one a stopping asking,
a little loosening of gripping, there was then in this one some
receiving, a being able to take what is given in the hand a little
loosened in gripping, this then was in this one religion, this then
was in this one a new meaning in being, a real realising of living,
a beginning believing something. Then it went on and on in this
one.</p>

<p>As I was saying this one was a little loosening gripping and a
little this one received in this loosening, seizing believing and
then this one was gripping this believing, this was then the new
meaning in the being in this one, this and receiving, really
receiving something. Not denying, receiving something, tenaciously
gripping that this one had and always sometimes again would be a
little receiving in moments when remembering, this one would a
little moment be stopping asking, always then a little loosening
gripping would give to this one a little at such moments power of
receiving, then this one would be tenaciously holding this this one
had then been receiving, always then this was the new meaning in
the being of this one.</p>

<p>Sometime perhaps it will be clear to every one the whole being
of some one. Sometime perhaps it will be clear to some one the
being in any one. This is then a beginning.</p>

<p>This is then a beginning, always then there is some winning
knowing. Sometime perhaps it will be clear in some one the being in
any one, always then there is some winning knowing, always then
there is some one keeping going learning, sometime perhaps it will
be clear to some one the whole being of some one. This is then
again a beginning.</p>

<p>Mostly every one is resembling some how to some one, every one
is one inside them, every one reminds some one of some other one.
Each one has it to say of each one he is like such a one I see it
in him, every one has it to say of each one she is like some one
else I can tell by remembering. Every one is always remembering
some one who is resembling to some one. Every one is themselves
inside them and every one is resembling to others.</p>

<p>This is then a beginning, always then there is some winning of
knowing. Sometime perhaps it will be clear in some one the being in
any one. Always then there is some winning knowing, always then
there are some keeping going in learning. Sometime perhaps it will
be clear to some one the whole being of some one. This is then
again a beginning. This now is learning understanding of resembling
to realising kinds in men and women. Every one has their own being
in them. Every one is of a kind in men and women. Every one is
resembling somehow to some one.</p>

<p>Everybody is a real one to me, everybody is like some one else
too to me.</p>

<p>Everybody has their own being in them. Every one is a kind of
men and women.</p>

<p>Everybody is a real one to me, everybody is like some one else
too to me. Every one is one inside them, every one reminds some one
of some other one, every one, mostly every one, has it to say of
mostly each one that one ever is knowing, that one ever is seeing,
that one is like such a one I see it in that one. So it goes on,
every one mostly sees in each one something that is like something
in some other one. Everybody is a real one to me, everybody is like
some one else too to me, everybody has their own being in them to
me, every one is of a kind of men and women to me. There are many
ways of making kinds of men and women. In each way of making kinds
of them there is a different way of feeling them as resembling.
These are now some of the ways I know it in them which ones are
like which other ones of them. Everybody then has to me their own
being, that is them, every one then is like some others in some
ways and that makes each one of them of a certain kind of men, of a
certain kind of women, of a certain kind of men and women.
Everybody is a real one to me, everybody is like some one else too
to me. Resembling, in each one to other men, to other women, to
other men and women, makes sometime a way of complete understanding
of each one, everything then they do in living is clear to one who
knows resemblances and differences and kinds in men and women,
their way then of living, loving, eating, pleasing, smoking,
scolding, drinking, dancing, walking, talking, beginning, ending,
sleeping, laughing, working, everything in them is clear then.
Everybody has their own being in them, every one is of a kind of
men and women.</p>

<p>Every one has their own being in them. Every one is of a kind of
men and women. There are many very many kinds of men and women,
there are many very many kinds of men, there are many very many
kinds of women. There are many ways of making kinds of them, this
is now a description of all the kinds of ways there are of making
kinds of them, all the kinds of ways there are of making kinds of
women, all the kinds of ways there are of making kinds of men, all
the kinds of ways there are of making kinds in men and women, all
the kinds of ways there are of making kinds of them in all the
stages of each of them in them all from their beginning to their
complete ending, all the kinds of ways there is in them of being
and having being coming out from them, all their kinds of ways of
being themselves inside them all of them and all the kinds of ways
the being in them comes out from them, all the kinds of ways they
ever effect any others any other one ever in any kind of way ever
connected with them. To know all the kinds of ways then to make
kinds of men and women one must know all the ways some are like
others of them, are different from others of them, so then there
come to be kinds of them. So then to some one each one must be a
real one and each one must be like other ones in some ways and like
other ones in other ways and some must know all the ways some one
is resembling to or different from some other one and other ones
and so sometime there will be a completed system of kinds of men
and women, of kinds of men and kinds of women.</p>

<p>To begin now a little such a grouping; each one must be a whole
one, each one must be to some one like some one else, like some
other one.</p>

<p>Everybody is a real one to me, everybody is like some one else
too to me. Almost every one in looking at any one mostly feels that
that one they are then seeing, is like some one else they have
known in their living, sometimes they know it in remembering,
sometimes it is puzzling to them, sometimes they tell it and no
other one then sees it with them, always there are different ways
of feeling resemblances between people any one is knowing, always
then there is remembering and disagreeing about resemblances
between every one, always then mostly every one sees some one
resembling the one they are then remembering, mostly every one
feels resemblances in men and women. It is important then to make
kinds of them, kinds of men and women, it is important then to know
all the ways there are of being resembling, always then every one
is a real one always then every one is resembling in different
kinds of ways to different ones, always then all through the living
of any one they are being resembling to different ones, always then
there are many kinds of being, always then there are many ways of
feeling, knowing kinds in being, always then each one is a kind of
man, a kind of woman, a kind in their beginning, a kind in their
going on, a kind in their ending, every one is of a kind of men, a
kind of women, a kind of men and women, a kind in beginning, a kind
in going on and in ending. Always then for understanding, each one
must see the meaning in all the ways of being kinds of men and
women, some have a feeling for some things in being others for
other things in being, each one has their own way of feeling kinds
in men and in women, in babies, in children, in growing young men
in growing young women, in men and women. There are then all these
many ways of knowing, feeling kinds in men and women, always then
there are many ways of knowing, feeling, thinking, talking, using
kinds in men and women. Always then each one is a whole one and in
many ways of a kind of men or of a kind of women.</p>

<p>Mostly this is all always confusing every one in talking,
feeling, thinking, using, seeing any one, always each one has their
own way of feeling kinds in them, always each kind of them has
their kind of way of knowing men and women. Making each one a kind
of men and women in enough kinds of ways to have everything
included in the kinds of them, everything that is in the being of
that one, that is understanding that one. That one is then a
completed whole one then to that one, the one having that
understanding of that one. That is very exciting, that is very
interesting, that completed understanding is to some all the
meaning in their living.</p>

<p>Always then each one one is ever hearing talking, knowing
feeling, thinking, seeing, each one has their way of seeing each
one they are ever knowing, each one has their way of feeling kinds
in men and women. Always then that one that has it to want to have
understanding of any one, that one always must have a feeling
always of the ways all the ways, the many ways of knowing, feeling
kinds in men and women. This then as I was saying is very exciting.
This then is now some description of one way of learning to know
kinds in men and women. Always I am telling of learning kinds in
men and in women. Always then everybody is a real one to me,
everybody is like some one else too to me. Always then sometime
each one comes to be a whole one in me.</p>

<p>Always I am learning, more and more then I am knowing many kinds
in men and women, many ways of making kinds in men and women,
always I am learning, always it is interesting, often it is
exciting, always I am learning, sometimes I am really learning all
the being in some one, always more and more each one is to me a
kind of one, always then I am learning more and more of bottom ways
of being resembling, always I am learning more and more of the
kinds of mixing that are confusing to any one looking, always then
more and more there are steadily grouping kinds of men and women to
me, more and more I know where each one I am ever seeing belongs in
the grouping, more and more then it all grows confusing, I am
always knowing more and more and then it gets all mixed up to me
all mixed up in each one all mixed up in each one I am learning,
each time there is in me a clear understanding of any one and I go
on to another one or back to one I was earlier understanding that
one is all a confusion from the last learning, each time then when
there is a clear understanding of any one it is confusing with the
next one, knowing more makes more grouping necessary in men and
women and then all of a sudden this new grouping is a clear thing
to my understanding and then sometimes all of a sudden I lose the
meaning out of all of them I lose all of them and then each one I
am then seeing looks like every one I have ever known in all my
looking and there is no meaning in any of my grouping and then
there is in me again a beginning and always sometime there will be
clearly existing kinds of men and women, grouping of them by the
bottom nature in them, by the mixing of other nature or natures
with, the bottom nature of them and so then sometime there will be
a complete history of each one who ever is or was or will be
living. It is very interesting, often very exciting, mostly very
confusing, always steadily increasing in meaning.</p>

<p>There is now a little a description of my learning. There will
be now then a little indication of what I have been learning, what
I am now knowing, then there will be again a beginning of Martha
Hersland in her beginning.</p>

<p>Everybody then is a real one to me. Sometime every one is a real
one to me, everybody too is like somebody else always then to me.
Slowly then there comes to be to me kinds in men and women. Slowly
then they are grouping inside me into kinds of them, kinds of men
and women. Every one then has their own being in them, every one is
then to me of a kind of men and women. This will be clearer now in
a description of how several men and several women came to be each
one of them the beginning of a group for me. That made them for me
each one of them a kind of them, a kind of women and men. Later
then there will be more description of the learning of the kinds
there are of men and women, of the resembling between them that
makes kinds of them around one.</p>

<p>Now then there will be a little description of the learning of
men and women as kinds of them, of the resemblances that are there
in the nature in them, in the bottom nature in them that makes one
kind of a way of making kinds of them.</p>

<p>Now this is the way resemblances among men and women have
meaning to me to make kinds of them. Now this is the way I am
learning men and women, knowing kinds in them.</p>

<p>Every one has some feeling of knowing kinds in men and in women,
some have some feeling of knowing kinds in men and women. This is
now then to be some description of my knowing kinds in men and
women. This will soon be clearer in little descriptions of some of
them as kinds in women and men.</p>

<p>This is now a little a description of my learning kinds in men
and women. Mostly every one as I was saying has some feeling of
knowing kinds in men, mostly every one as I was saying has some
feeling of knowing kinds in women as I was saying some have some
feeling of knowing kinds in men and women. Mostly every one sees
resemblances between some men, between some women, some between
some men and women, and men and men, and women and women. There are
then as I was saying many ways of making kinds in men and
women.</p>

<p>There will be now more description of the learning of knowing of
the kinds there are of men and women, of the resembling that makes
kinds of them around one. As I was saying always each one is
sometime a whole one to me, each one always is like some one or
many other ones to me.</p>

<p>This is then the way I do my learning, slowly knowing each one,
more and more seeing each one as a whole one and at the same time
as a kind of men and women, slowly more and more having everybody
in me as a real one, slowly more and more knowing resemblances all
the resemblances existing, slowly more and more having confusion
and then slowly again and again beginning and getting clearer the
kinds of them and then losing them in more complicated differences
and resemblings and so always more and more I am understanding and
always more and more I am changing and always more and more I am
beginning and always more and more I am having uncertainty in my
feeling and always more and more I am certain and always more and
more there are distinct kinds of them kinds of men and women, and
then sometimes there are so many ways of seeing each one that I
must stop looking.</p>

<p>This will be always then a longer and longer description always
longer with my living and my knowing.</p>

<p>Always then I am seeing the resemblances that make kinds of them
kinds of men and women and always I come back again and again to
see it in them. Always then I am thinking and feeling and learning
resemblances in men and women, always then I am making kinds in
them.</p>

<p>Every one then has their own being in them. Every one is of a
kind of men and women. Always then I see resemblances in each one
to another one to other ones and always I come back again and again
to looking at that one and always I am seeing something, and always
I am having a confusion inside me about that one and always I am
beginning again and again and again and then sometime that one is a
whole one to me, that one is of a kind of men and women from the
bottom nature in that one and always then sometime it is clear
about that one to me the nature or natures in that one with the
bottom nature in that one and then sometime I know of that one all
the kinds of being in that one, all the kinds of ways that one is
of kinds of men and women.</p>

<p>Always then I am thinking and feeling and seeing all the ways
the one I am then knowing has of being resembling to any one. Every
one as I was saying mostly every one feels and tells about
resemblances in men and women, mostly every one has a feeling of
kinds in men, of kinds in women, of kinds in men and women. There
are then as I was saying many ways of feeling kinds in men and
women.</p>

<p>Mostly then as I was saying every one has some feeling of people
resembling each other, some have it more some have it less in them
the feeling that people are resembling, some are always looking for
resemblances, some are then with that very annoying, some are
always saying this one is like some one I can tell it by
remembering, some are always thinking that every one is resembling
a few they have known in living and these then often are annoying,
always then mostly each one feels something of interest in seeing
resemblances between some one and some other one or ones sometime,
some feel this very often, some feel this all the time, mostly then
there is a good deal of discussing mostly then there is a good deal
of irritation, mostly then there is a good deal of difference of
opinion about the ways people are resembling, about resemblances
between someone and some other one some one then is seeing and some
one else is then not feeling. Always then there is in living much
finding of resemblances between men, between women, between men and
women, between children, and mostly always then when any one tells
it to any one there is much discussing often very much irritation.
This is then very interesting. There are then often some who find
every one they are ever knowing resembling a few men and women whom
these sometime have had come to be in them a certain kind of men
and women, these then make many of those they are seeing of these
few kinds of them. Mostly then every one has some feeling for
resemblances and for kinds in men and in women and in men and
women.</p>

<p>Now then to begin again understanding, to begin again learning
men and women, to begin again seeing them as whole ones each one
and each one as kinds in men and women. As I was saying each one I
am ever knowing some time is a real one to me, as I was saying each
one I am ever knowing sometime is like some one else too to me.
Always then I am learning always then I am remembering, I am
puzzling, I am in a confusion, always then I am coming back again
and again and seeing, feeling, thinking all the ways any one can
see that one, all the ways that one is resembling to any one,
slowly then each one I am ever knowing is a whole one to me, slowly
then I can learn other ones from having that one a whole one inside
me, more and more then I am understanding kinds in men and women,
more and more then I am learning different values in resemblances
existing always between each one and others of them, sometime then
each one comes to be to me a completed being. This is then now a
slow description of my way of learning, this is then now a little
description of some whom I am knowing.</p>

<p>Every one is themselves inside them, mostly every one reminds
some one of some other one of some other ones, every one has it to
say of some one some of many, he is like such a one I see it in
him, she is like some one else I can tell it by remembering. Mostly
every one is sometimes thinking that some one is resembling the one
at whom they are then looking. So, many always go on thinking that
every one is resembling to others, and often some one is
disagreeing some one to whom such a one is pointing out
resemblances does not agree with that one. This is very common.
There are many ways of feeling kinds in men and women. People
disagreeing about ways of being resembling, people seeing different
ways of making kinds in them often makes such irritation, sometimes
exciting, sometimes confusing, sometimes to some one puzzling.</p>

<p>There are many ways of making kinds in men and women. Each way
of making kinds of them comes from a different way of feeling
knowing them as resembling. There are many ways then of feeling
knowing kinds in men and women. Sometime some one will know all the
ways there are for people to be resembling, some one some time then
will have a completed history of every one, every one who ever is
or was or will be living. There are many ways then of knowing kinds
in men and women, there are many ways then, there is a way of
feeling them as kinds of them by ways of doing that come from
education and tradition, kinds of them that come from the ways that
make a nation, there are ways of seeing kinds of them by the kind
of learning in them, tastes, beliefs, fondness for walking,
working, doing nothing, there are ways of feeling kinds in them in
color resemblances and gentlenesses in them, and courage, and ways
of showing angry feeling, there are ways of knowing resemblances in
them from occupation giving certain habits to them, there are ways
of seeing kinds in them from their being always young, always old
in them, bright all of some of them, dull all of some of them,
moral all of some of them, immoral all of some of them, lazy all of
some of them, very energetic always some of them, then there are
samenesses in the looks of many of them that makes kinds of them to
some and sometime some one will know all the ways there are for
people to be resembling, some one sometime then will have a
completed history of all of them.</p>

<p>There are all these ways then and many more of them of feeling
knowing people to be resembling and then there is the way that I am
always seeing, the resembling that makes the two kinds of them,
independent dependent kind of them who have attacking as their
natural way of winning fighting and the dependent independent kind
of them who have resisting in them as their natural way of winning
and then there are so many complicated kinds of these two kinds of
them so many ways of mixing, disguising, complicated using of their
natures in many of them, so complicated that mostly it is confusing
to me who know it of them that there are these kinds of them and
always more and more I know it of them and always it is confusing
for sometimes a resisting one spends most of living in attacking,
an attacking one spends most of the living in resisting, sometimes
some one is mostly all attacking and just at the bottom there is a
contradiction of the whole nature of them, there are so many
complications then in all this that I am knowing, it is all a very
difficult thing to be really understanding. I know very much about
these ways of being in men and women, I know it and I can say it, I
know it and I can write it, it is a very complex mixing the being
in all men and in all women, I do not know yet the whole of it, I
do know now very much of it, I cannot yet say all I know of it.</p>

<p>Mostly everybody now is like some one else to me, like many
others to me, in some ways like some in other ways like others and
now more and more there are to me some of each kind of them that
are mostly only of that kind of them, and so more and more there
come to be to me clearly a certain number of kinds of men and
women.</p>

<p>Kinds in men and women then are to many always in men and women
and in many different ways of feeling and thinking. Mostly to every
one there are kinds in men, kinds in women, kinds in men and
women.</p>

<p>There are then as I was saying many ways of feeling kinds in men
and women, every way of feeling kinds in men and women must be in
such a one that sometime has in that one all the history of all
men, of all women.</p>

<p>Kinds in men and women then are existing to mostly every one. To
many feeling kinds in men and women is a part of learning men and
women, to some kinds in men and women are parts of learning men and
women, to some feeling kinds in men and women is to have sometime
each one such a one is ever knowing a completed whole one to that
one. To such a one always there is continually more variation and
more resembling and sometimes it is so confusing that such a one
must stop looking. Then when some one is a whole one and a complete
one of a kind of one or the kinds in one are complete to one
knowing that one, then it is very satisfying.</p>

<p>Everybody then is mostly a real one to me, everybody is now like
some one and like some other one and then again like some other one
and each one sometimes is a whole one to me.</p>

<p>This being resembling, this seeing resemblances between those
one is knowing is interesting, defining, confusing, uncertain and
certain. You see one, the way of looking at any one in that one
that is like some one, the way of listening, a sudden expression, a
way of walking, a sound in laughing, a number of expressions that
are passing over the face of that one, it is confusing, too many
people have pieces in them like pieces in this one, it began as a
clear resemblance to some one, it goes on to be a confusing number
of resemblances to many then, some resemblance that is very clear
one is not remembering then it is baffling, more and more
resemblances come out in that one, perhaps that one is not
independent dependent and yet that was so clear in the beginning,
more and more then with knowing resemblances are multiplying and
being baffling and confusing and always each one of all these
resemblances one who sometime wants to have this one as a whole
one, wants to really know kinds in men and women must completely
feel, admit, remember and consider and realise as having meaning.
This is then a beginning of learning to make kinds of men and
women. Slowly then all the resemblances between one and all the
others that have something, different things in common with that
one, all these fall into an ordered system sometime then that one
is a whole one, sometimes that one is very different to what was in
the beginning the important resemblance in that one but always
everything, all resemblances in that one must be counted in,
nothing must ever be thrown out, everything in each one must be
included to know that one and then sometime that one is to some one
a whole one and that is then very satisfying.</p>

<p>Sometimes as I was just saying everything in any one, all the
resemblances in that one point to that one being one kind of men
and women and then, say an independent dependent kind of one, and
then when one looks more and more closely at that one the bottom
nature in that one is a contradiction to all the rest in that one,
is so to say dependent independent being and everything one ever
was knowing of that one has to be always still remembered but now
it all has a new direction. Knowing completely then any one gives a
solid basis for seeing the meaning of any being that has in it
resemblances to that one. Always then it is important with each one
that sometime that one is to the one learning kinds in men and
women a whole one, a complete one so that there can then be a solid
basis of comparison of understanding the meaning of the being in
some one who is resembling in any way to that one who is to the one
learning, then a whole one. Sometime as I was saying there are so
many ways of seeing, feeling resemblances in some one, some one
resembles so many men and women that it is confusing, baffling,
then the one learning kinds in men and women is despairing, nothing
then to that one has any meaning, it is then to that one all of it
only an arbitrary choosing and then that one must stop looking,
that one then must begin again then and always never forgetting
anything that one ever has seen as a resemblance in the one that
one is then learning. Sometime really each one will then be a
complete one to that one. Sometime really each one will be a
completed, understood person, understood in kinds of men and women.
This is a real way of learning, sometime then there will be a
complete history of every one, everything then they do in living,
each one, will be clear then to the one that has really learned all
the kinds there are of men and women, all will be understood then
in them, their living, loving, eating, working, resting, pleasing,
smoking, scolding, drinking, dancing, walking, talking, sleeping,
beginning, ending, attacking, resisting, winning, losing,
everything. There are whole beings always, they are themselves
inside them, they will be whole ones then to the others who have
learned to know them, they will be each understood by being known
as their kind of them.</p>

<p>I do know very much of the being in men and women. I do know
very many of them. I do know the resemblances in them and the kinds
of them, the divisions into kinds of them that is important for the
understanding of them. I do know many of them, I know them, I
understand, I explain them, they are themselves then to me, they
are whole ones to me, I know it and I tell it, I know it more and
more and more and more I tell it. Always I am thinking about it,
always I feel the being the whole being sometime in each one, I
know it sometime and I tell it sometime. I learn it as I see it and
feel it and hear it as they repeat it, I understand it and then I
understand in another one that is like the one that has then become
a whole one to me, I learn new variations in it then from this now
one and then sometime this one is a whole one to me and I begin
again then with this one to know kinds in men and women and so on
and always there is more to learn about it, there is more to know
about it, there is more to tell about it.</p>

<p>This will be clearer now in a description of how several men and
women each one came to be a whole one to me, a kind of men and
women to me and then by resemblances between them and others of
them there came to be more understanding of each kind in men and
women in me and then other kinds in them to me. Later there will be
more description of the knowing of all the kinds there are of men
and women, of the resembling that makes kinds of them around one.
Now there will be a little description of some, of the kinds they
are, of learning by resemblances between men and women the being in
them.</p>

<p>The way I think of every one is like this. This is the way they
come to be in groups to me, in groups that have in them to be that
those in them are resembling each one to the other one. The way I
know them as resembling, that I have been just explaining, in every
way that any one can see any one of them. The way I think of each
one is like this that I will now begin describing.</p>

<p>In recognizing them as being of one group or of another group of
them, that is one kind or another kind of men and women, everything
in them, anything in them, their looks, their feelings, their
expressions, their way of doing anything, their way of doing
everything, everything, anything in them is to be noticed in its
resemblance to something in another one. So then there come to be
groups of kinds of men and women. So then as I was saying I come to
know them, sometime all of them I am ever knowing, as kinds in men
and women. Sometimes it is very confusing, sometimes very simple,
sometimes very certain, sometimes very uncertain, sometimes for a
long time baffling. There are then kinds in men and women. Sometime
there will he a description of all the kinds of them.</p>

<p>The way I think of each one is like this. I think of them as
having a bottom nature in them, as having sometimes mixed up in
them other nature or natures with the bottom nature in them. This
is now to be a little description of the way I always think of each
one of them to lead later to a description of some of the kinds of
men and women.</p>

<p>I think of each one I am ever knowing. Each one sometime is a
whole one to me. Each one has a bottom nature in them of one kind
of men and women. Each one may have in them other nature or natures
in them mixed with each other or separate together in them. This is
the way I think of men and women.</p>

<p>This is now a description of the way I feel and think the
natures in them.</p>

<p>As I was saying each one has a bottom nature in them. Each one
is one of a kind of men and women.</p>

<p>Each one has a bottom nature in them, each one has or has not
another nature or other natures in them besides the bottom nature
in them. These may be of the same kind as the bottom nature, they
may not. This is now then a description of the way I feel and think
the nature and natures in men and women.</p>

<p>This is then the way I feel the nature, the bottom nature, the
other nature or natures, in men and women, this is then the way I
feel each nature in each one of them. Each nature then is of a kind
in men and women.</p>

<p>This is then the way I feel each nature in men and women, this
is the way I feel the nature and make groupings of them, groupings
of kinds of them.</p>

<p>The way I feel natures in men and women is this way then. To
begin then with one general kind of them, this is a resisting
earthy slow kind of them, anything entering into them as a
sensation must emerge again from through the slow resisting bottom
of them to be an emotion in them. This is a kind of them. This
bottom in them then in some can be solid, in some frozen, in some
dried and cracked, in some muddy and engulfing, in some thicker, in
some thinner, slimier, drier, very dry and not so dry and in some a
stimulation entering into the surface of the mass that is them to
make an emotion does not get into it, the mass then that is them,
to be swallowed up in it to be emerging, in some it is swallowed up
and never then is emerging. Now all these kinds of ways of being
are existing and sometime there will be examples of all these ways
of being, now all these ways of being have it in common that there
is not in them a quick and poignant reaction, it must be an
entering and then an emerging mostly taking some time in the doing,
the quickest of these then are such of them where the mud is dry
and almost wooden, where the mud has become dry and almost wooden,
or metallic in them and it is a surface denting a stimulation gives
to them or else there is a surface that is not dry and the rest is
dry and it is only the surface of the whole mass that is that one
of which there has been any penetrating, and in some in whom the
whole mass of the being is taking part in the reaction in some of
such of them habit, mind strongly acting can make it go quicker and
quicker the deep sinking and emerging. This is then a kind of them,
the resisting kind of them, and there are many kinds of that kind
of them. This is a very sure way of grouping kinds in men and
women. I know it and I see men and women by it. Mostly to any one
now it means nothing. I will begin again then this explaining. This
group I have been describing are those that have resisting winning
as their natural way of being. I will begin again explaining. There
are a kind of men and women who have resisting as their way of
winning fighting. There are another kind of men and women that have
attacking as their way of winning fighting, these have poignant and
quick reaction, emotion in such of them has the quickness and
intensity of a sensation, that is one kind of men and women. Later
I will tell more of them. Now I must begin again with the
resisting, the dependent independent the kind I have been beginning
describing in a way that may mean nothing to any other one, in the
way I feel bottom being in men and women, in the way I make kinds
in them, in the way each one comes to be a whole one to me seeing
that one.</p>

<p>Resisting being is one way of being. This is now a description.
As I was saying there are kinds of them kinds in men and women and
there are kinds of kinds of them kinds in kinds in men and women.
First then there are large groupings of them, the grouping into two
kinds of them those having resisting, those having attacking as
their natural way of winning fighting, dependent independent,
independent dependent, these two kinds of them. Each group then has
in a way the same way of handwriting, the same way of succeeding,
the same way of beginning, the same way of loving. Many of them are
very baffling, many in each group of them, for there are in many of
them other nature or natures in them, sometimes then they are very
baffling, sometime to some one the bottom nature in them is
certain, the kind the bottom nature in them is, and then, though it
may take a long time to know the complete being in them, they are
not any longer baffling. Soon a few short histories will be given
of learning the bottom being in some and so clearing up the problem
of them which for a long time was confusing, which always is
confusing to any one not knowing the bottom being in that one.</p>

<p>This is clear then, bottom being is the natural way of winning,
loving, fighting, working, thinking, writing in each one. This is
not anything about, good or bad in them, in each one, about more or
less brains in them but the kind of brains, the kind of good, the
kind of bad, the kind of loving, the kind of fighting, the way of
working, being in them at the bottom of them.</p>

<p>This is a very certain way of knowing, grouping men and women,
understanding, seeing the kind of natures in them, making certain
of the resemblances between them. This is then a universal
grouping, always everywhere with every education there are these
same kinds of them, some are a complete thing of one kind of them,
some are very little just at the bottom one kind of them and all
the rest of them are other kinds of them, there are in them every
degree of mixing, every degree of emphasising, some are the whole
of their kind of them, some are only part of their kind of them; to
commence again then with my way of seeing them and then the way of
knowing the resemblances between them and so the making groups of
them. To begin again then with my feeling of bottom nature in each
one.</p>

<p>There are then the two general kinds of them, the attacking kind
the independent dependent kind of them, the resisting kind the
dependent independent kind of them. There are all extremes of these
two kinds of them, resisting kind that is almost always feverishly
attacking, attacking kind that is almost always stubbornly
resisting, the independent dependents that are almost all
independent, almost all dependent, the dependent independent that
are almost all dependent, that are almost all independent, it is
often very confusing but the distinction has meaning, mostly to
every one reading there is not any understanding, that is very
certain, sometime to some one it can have meaning, always then
there is going on explaining of the meaning of this dividing of men
and women into these kinds of them.</p>

<p>There must now then be more description of the way each one is
made of a substance common to their kind of them, thicker, thinner,
harder, softer, all of one consistency, all of one lump, or little
lumps stuck together to make a whole one cemented together
sometimes by the same kind of being sometimes by other kind of
being in them, some with a lump hard at the centre liquid at the
surface, some with the lump vegetablish or wooden or metallic in
them. Always then the kind of substance, the kind of way when it is
a mediumly fluid solid fructifying reacting substance, the way it
acts then makes one kind of them the resisting kind of them, the
way another substance acts makes another kind of them the attacking
kind of them. It and the state it is in each kind of them, the
mixing of it with the other way of being that makes many kinds of
these two kinds of them, sometime all this will have meaning. Now
there will be a little more description given of these two kinds of
substances and their way of acting and the kinds in each kind of
them and then there will be given short histories showing learning
kinds, learning individual ones by knowing this way of seeing,
feeling bottom nature in men and women.</p>

<p>I know it and I want to tell it. I see it the bottom nature in
each one I am ever knowing, sometimes, in each one. I see it, I see
it and know it, its likeness and unlikeness to bottom nature in
another one, I know and I want to tell it. I know it and I want to
tell it and sometime some one else too will know it. I know it and
I want to tell it and sometimes some one, some will know it. This
is then the way I see it.</p>

<p>As I was saying there are two general kinds of them, the
resisting, the attacking kind of them. There are two general kinds
of them, there are many very many kinds of these two kinds of them,
there are many very very many mixings in every one of some of all
the kinds of them, in some of some of both the general kinds of
them I know this now and now I will describe more of it. I will now
describe natures in all men and women. In each one, some nature is
the bottom nature of them. All natures are kinds, they are like
natures in other men and women. This is now a little a beginning of
the grouping of them.</p>

<p>First then to consider the general resisting group of men and
women, considering them now only the bottom nature, which is
resisting, in this group of them, leaving out now any considering
of mixing in them of other nature or natures in them, of other
forms of resisting nature in them besides the kind of resisting
being that is bottom nature in each one, of any attacking nature or
natures in them that are mixed up in them. It is clear then that it
is now the general group of resisting beings that are to have now a
describing, there will be a little explaining of the attacking
being in resisting being. There is now to be here a short
description.</p>

<p>As I was saying this is one way of seeing being, bottom nature
as a substance that has a way of acting that makes one general kind
of being, that makes all of that kind of them have it in common to
have a certain way of fighting, thinking, loving, succeeding,
beginning and ending, this is of course in each one affected by the
quantity of bottom being in each one of their kind of being and of
the other nature or natures in each one and so often it is all very
confusing. Often in very much of any one's living it is very hard
to know which nature in them is bottom nature in them, sometime
this comes to be clear in each one, it is always there and
repeating in each one, sometimes it is loudly sounding and after
any one has heard it clearly in some one it is always there to that
one, always repeating. The bottom nature then is clear in that one.
In some it is clearer when they are very young, in some when they
are young, in some when they are not so young, in some when they
are old ones. Always in each one it is there repeating, sometime
some one knows it in each one, sometime some one will know it in
every one that one is ever knowing.</p>

<p>To begin then. The resisting kind of them. Many are of this kind
of them and I know it in them. They are it, they live it and I know
it. Sometime then I understand it, they are it, they live it and
they repeat it, sometime then I know it when I see it, hear it,
feel it in them, sometime then when they are of this kind of them I
know it of them, sometimes for a long time it is baffling in some
one for it is not clear in them, sometime it is clear in each one
the bottom nature in them, when it is resisting being in them it
makes certain kinds of ways of being, loving, thinking, fighting in
such of them. They are it, they live it and sometime I know it.
They are it, they live it, sometime they show it, sometime I
understand it and now I will tell it the way I see it. I will tell
the way I see and feel and hear and know resisting being in those
that have it, then I will tell the way I see and feel and hear and
know attacking being in those that have it, I will tell of the
kinds there are in it and how by resemblances between those of that
kind of it I know it, I will give then more examples of knowing
it.</p>

<p>The resisting kind in men and women and how I feel it. They are
it, they live it, sometimes I know it. Always sometime in each one
sometime. I know it. I understand and I can tell it. I will wait a
little longer before I tell very much about it. Now there will be
only a little description of it. Slowly there will be a complete
description of it, coming out of me, and sometime there will be
written all any one knows of it. I know it and now I will tell a
little of it.</p>

<p>The resisting kind of being in men and women and how I feel it,
how I know it in them. They are it, they live it, they repeat it,
sometime I know it in them, this is now some description of the way
I realise it.</p>

<p>The bottom nature in many then is of the dependent independent
kind of being there can be in men and women, these have resisting
fighting as their natural way of winning. In such of them reaction
is not quick and poignant in them, in such of them emotion has not
the poignancy of a sensation. I know it in them, always sometime I
know it in them, often it is hard to know it in them from the
mixing of the other kinds of nature in them. Perhaps now I will
give just a little description of it, later I will give more
description of it. I understand it and I can tell it. I will wait a
little longer before I tell very much about it. Now there will be
only a little description of it. Slowly there will be a complete
description of it coming out of me and sometime there will be
written all any one knows of it. I know it and now I will tell a
little of it.</p>

<p>Resisting being in men and women. This is now then a little a
description of my realising resisting being in men and women. This
is then now a little description of my realising resisting being in
some. There are many that have resisting being in them as a bottom
nature to them, sometimes I know it in them. There are many then
that have it, I know it and sometime I tell it, they are all of
them showing it in the repeating they are all of them doing all
their living, sometime I know it in each one of them, sometime I
know it and sometime I tell it. There are many that have it, that
makes all of them one kind of men and women. I know it in them in
each one of them of men and women I am ever knowing who have it and
sometimes I understand it, I know it and understand the action of
it in each one of them that have it, in each one of them that I
come to know of that kind of men and women. There are many then
that have it, about half of all men and women are of the kind of
men and women having resisting being as a bottom nature in them,
the rest of them mostly have attacking being in them. This is a
general division. I understand a good deal of it, I can tell more
and less than I understand of it. I am now going to tell less and
more than I understand of resisting being as a bottom nature in
many men and women who have it.</p>

<p>Resisting being then as I was saying is to me a kind of being,
one kind of men and women have it as being that emotion is not as
poignant in them as sensation. This is my meaning, this is
resisting being. Generally speaking then resisting being is a kind
of being where, taking bottom nature to be a substance like earth
to some one's feeling, this needs time for penetrating to get
reaction. Those having attacking being their substance is more
vibrant in them, these can have reaction as emotion as quick and
poignant and complete as a sensation. Generally speaking, those
having resisting being in them have a slow way of responding, they
may be nervous and quick and all that but it is in them,
nervousness is in them as the effect of slow-moving going too fast
and so having nervous being, nervous being in them is not the
natural means of expression to such of them, some have quick
response in them by the steadily training of themselves to quicker
and quicker reaction and some of them in the end come to seem to
have quick reaction as their natural way of being, mostly in such
of them this is a late development in them and that is natural from
the kind of being in them. Attacking being often has nervousness as
energy as a natural way of active being in them, often these then
lose the power of attacking with the loss of nervousness in them.
There are so very many ways of knowing these two kinds in men and
women. I know so very many of them, I will not now tell of very
many of them. Mostly the resisting being when they have
conservative being in them have it from not having the activity of
changing, the attacking kind of being have conservative sense in
them from convictions, traditions, they are attackingly defending.
Mostly those having in them resisting being have more feeling of
objects as real things to them, objects have to them more earthy
meaning than to those who have attacking as their natural way of
being. Mostly then objects to those having attacking being as their
natural way of being have for them meaning as emotion, as
practically to be using, as beauty, as symbolism, that is to many
of them their natural way of seeing anything they are knowing, to
those who have resisting being as their natural way of being an
object is it itself to them, the meaning, the use, the emotion
about it, the beauty, the symbolising of it is to such of them a
secondary reaction, not altogether at once as in those having in
them attacking as their natural way of being. So then those having
resisting being have also in them passive adaptability strongly in
them when they are not really resisting while those who have
attacking being are generally more active in adapting, they may
have yielding in them or stubbornness or sensitive responsiveness
in them when not attacking they have not generally speaking passive
adaptability in them. They are very different then the attacking
and the resisting kind in men and women. This division has real
meaning. Sometime when I am all through all my writing, when all my
meaning, all my understanding, all my knowing, all my learning has
been written, sometime then some will understand the being in all
men and women.</p>

<p>I am all unhappy in this writing. I know very much of the
meaning of the being in men and women. I know it and feel it and I
am always learning more of it and now I am telling it and I am
nervous and driving and unhappy in it. Sometimes I will be all
happy in it.</p>

<p>I know it and now I begin again with telling it, the way I feel
resisting being in men and women. It is like a substance and in
some it is as I was saying solid and sensitive all through it to
stimulation, in some almost wooden, in some muddy and engulfing, in
some thin almost like gruel, in some solid in some parts and in
other parts all liquid, in some with holes like air-holes in it, in
some a thin layer of it, in some hardened and cracked all through
it, in some double layers of it with no connections between the
layers of it. This and many many other ways there are of feeling it
as the bottom being in different ones of them; different men and
women have resisting being as their natural way of being, always I
am looking hard at each one, feeling, seeing, hearing the repeating
coming out of each one and so slowly I know of each one the way the
bottom in them is existing and so then that is the foundation of
the history of each one of them and always it is coming out of each
one of them.</p>

<p>This then this bottom nature in them, the way it is made in them
makes the bottom history of them, makes their way of being stupid,
wise, active, lazy, continuous, disjointed, is always there in
them, in some their kind of them is more, is less, is the same all
through their living, is more or less affected by the other nature
or natures in them if they have other nature or natures in them,
can be stimulated or hurried or slowed hut never really changed in
them, can come very nearly to be changed in them, can never really
be changed in them, really not ever to my knowing, really not ever
really changed in them. This then is very certain and now to speak
again of attacking being. Attacking being as I was saying has it to
be that emotion can be as quick, as poignant, as profound in
meaning as a sensation. This is my meaning. I am thinking of
attacking being not as an earthy kind of substance but as a pulpy
not dust not dirt but a more mixed up substance, it can be slimy,
gelatinous, gluey, white opaquy kind of thing and it can be white
and vibrant, and clear and heated and this is all not very clear to
me and I will now tell more about it.</p>

<p>This is the way I am thinking of it. In the one in which I first
learned to know it it was like this to me. It was like this to me
in the first one I came to know it, the substance attacking being
is, in its various shaping. In this one it was so dull, so thick,
so gluey that it was so slow in action one almost could think of it
as resisting but it was not resisting earthy dependent independent
being, it was attacking, stupid, slow-moving, it was independent
dependent being, it was a different substance in its way of acting,
reacting, of being penetrated, of feeling, of thinking than any
slow resisting dependent independent being and now there is to be
here a very little explaining of how I know this as a kind of
being.</p>

<p>In this one then, as I was saying it was attacking being but
very slowly getting into motion but not because it the stimulation
was lost into it and had to be remade out of it but because it
being shaken it was a slow mass getting into action. I know this
distinction, it has real meaning, I am saying it again and again
and now I begin again with a description.</p>

<p>This then the attacking being was first clear to me in one
having it as a slow, stupid, gelatinous being that when it got
moving went on repeating action, never could get going any faster,
had a nervous anaemic feeling that was part of its getting moving
and keeping going. The resisting medium has a different kind of
action as I was explaining. Now this attacking being when it is
vibrant can be nervous and poignant and quicker than
chain-lightning, there can be to it a profound complete reaction
having the intensity of a sensation. Its sensitiveness is different
in kind from that of the resisting kind of being, its sensitiveness
is quivering into action not a sensitiveness just existing, but
this is all too much to be now explaining, wait and I can tell it,
clearer, always it has to be told as it has been learned by me very
slowly, each one only slowly can know it, each one must wait for
little pieces of it, always there will be coming more and more of
it, always there will he a telling of every way the two kinds of
being are different in everything and always it is hard to say it
the differences between them, always more and more I know it,
always more and more I know it, always more I come back to begin
again the knowing of it, always I will tell it as I learned it,
sometime I will have told all of it, always I am telling pieces of
it, more and more I will know it, more and more I will tell it,
sometime it will be clear to some one and I will be then glad of
it.</p>

<p>This then is attacking being to me, this then was the way it
came first to be clear in me, in one in whom it was slow moving,
and in others then I knew it when it was quick and poignant and
complete and I saw it, and I knew it as the same substance as this
slow moving mass and in all its forms of acting more and more then
I knew it. In some as I was saying it is as emotion, in some it is
as passion, in some it is as sensitive responding; it has a way of
thinking, loving, acting, different in kind from that of resisting
being and some time, and it is a very long time too I know it now I
am beginning telling all I know all I am always learning, sometime
there will have been a complete description of these two kinds of
being.</p>

<p>In some then this quick and poignant and profound reaction has
to break through a resisting being lying on it and then it is very
interesting in the changing in the action it takes to get through
the covering, sometimes it is in some more quivering vibrant at the
bottom than through the rest of it and then it is lighted and set
in motion the rest that of itself never has more activity than
quivering by the more vibrant part at the bottom, sometimes all of
it is not more active ever than quivering, this is true in some, in
some it is all vibrant and completely poignantly passionately
acting, in some its nervousness its most vigorous action, in some
it is a big mass always slowly moving but would like to stop acting
and a resolute will, a mind, a conviction, education in such a one
keeps it moving, sometimes it stops moving, there are so many ways,
there are such a various kind of mixing that can be in any one,
sometime there will be a history of each one, sometime there will
be a description of all the ways resisting being can be in any one,
all the ways attacking being can be in any one.</p>

<p>This then is then one way I have been seeing kinds in men and
women, the way I see the bottom natures and other natures in them.
Always I see them as kinds, always as kinds of substance and ways
of that substance being in them as bottom nature. Sometime all this
will be clearer. This is then the way I see kinds in men and women.
This then makes every one sometime a clear one, a whole one to me,
this is now soon to be more description of such learning by me, of
such understanding of the being in men and women.</p>

<p>As I was saying often for many years some one is baffling; the
repeated seeing, hearing, feeling of the being in them does not
make clear the nature of the bottom being in them. Sometimes for
many years some one is baffling and then it is clear in that one
and then by resemblances between that one and other ones many are
clear then. This is now some description of such learning. This
will be now little short descriptions of learning six of them and
how knowing others before helped with these and how knowing these
helped with others later. This is now then a little more of
preliminary studying.</p>

<p>There are many that I know and always more and more I know it,
they are all of them repeating, they are all of them in some way
resembling one to others of them, more and more I understand it,
sometimes in each one I know the bottom nature in them, sometimes
in each one I know all the natures in them, sometimes each one is a
whole one to me, sometime of each one there is a complete history
to me.</p>

<p>There was one then, this one was not baffling for such a long
time, this one was of the resisting kind of them.</p>

<p>Sometime each one comes to be a whole one to me. Sometime the
bottom nature in each one, the other nature or natures in each one,
the mixing or not mixing in them of the natures in them comes to be
clear in each one, each one then is a complete one, each one then
keeps repeating the whole history of them.</p>

<p>Some are puzzling a long time, every one is more or less
puzzling sometime, mostly every one is puzzling to me sometime,
sometime mostly every one comes to be a whole one to me.</p>

<p>As I have been saying there is a bottom nature in every one, the
other nature or natures in them may be of their kind of them the
same kind as the bottom nature in them, if they are resisting, the
other nature or natures in them may be of a kind of resisting, they
may be of a kind of attacking being. All this makes some one
sometimes for a long time very baffling. All this makes each one
always sometime puzzling. Always more and more I know it of each
one the being in them the mixtures in them, always more and more I
will come to have a complete understanding of every one I am ever
knowing. This is now a description of my understanding of one.</p>

<p>This one then was not baffling for such a very long time, this
one had times of being puzzling to me, mostly after a real
beginning of understanding it comes to me very steadily, not
quickly not slowly, this one was of a resisting kind of them with
the attacking kind of resisting being almost to the point of
succeeding as part of the being in this one.</p>

<p>This is now to be some description of this one. The first one of
those that further back I was describing as showing my way of
learning to have each one come to be a whole one in me, that first
one was to every one as the natural way of being was one having
every one always wanting to have her be with them every one who
knew her then, and always every one was flattering her to make it
up to her that there was not ever any place for her in living, for
always to herself and to every one there was always a good reason
why not any condition was the right condition for her living, for
always to herself and to every one there was always a good reason
why not any condition was the right condition for her living. But
always a little somewhere there was a feeling that this was not all
the meaning in the being in this one, slowly then some felt in this
one the muggy resisting bottom that kept her from ever giving
herself to any one unless some one needing her engulfed her by a
need of her, they engulfed her then some when they had to have some
one. Slowly then some came to know in this one the resisting bottom
in this one, slowly then some came to see it in this one that she
was of them needing to be owning those they need for loving, this
is part of this kind of resisting being as I was saying about Mrs.
Hersland but in this one it never came to any realisation for this
one never really owned any one, resisting to keep from yielding to
the need of having other people's having loving feeling, resisting
accepting just an ordinary quantity of loving feeling from any one,
this kept this one from yielding herself enough to any one so as to
own any one, wanting giving loving and having resisting being kept
this one from being engulfed by other ones excepting when some one
drowned this one, kept this one mostly from ever yielding enough to
own any one. As I was saying sometimes some one engulfed this one,
always this wore out this one, it was never freely yielding herself
to engulfing then, it was wanting to keep ahead of being engulfed
by giving and this was very wearing to this one.</p>

<p>Some then knew this being in this one, slowly then hearing,
feeling, seeing all the repeating in this one, slowly then hearing,
feeling, seeing every one who knew this one's feeling about this
one made it clear to me the whole being in this one, I came then to
hear repeating the muggy resisting bottom that kept her ever from
giving herself to any one unless one engulfed her by completely
using her, by a need of her to comfort them in some sorrow when
they had to have some one, by using her and giving nothing to her.
This one then had this resisting being that with all the need in
her of having loving given to her kept her from ever giving herself
to any one even for a little loving of such a one, kept her from
ever having a place for really living.</p>

<p>But this is not all the meaning in this one, she had in her to
be muggily resisting except when some one was engulfing her, but
also if she could have given herself to some one it would be to own
them. She was of the kind of women that have to own the ones they
need for loving. This one then never owned any one, and this was
that she could not give herself enough to any one to own them,
sometimes some one owned this one but this one then was so drowned
by this one's owning that she could not loose herself enough to own
them, she could only cling to wanting to give to them just enough
to keep herself from being completely drowned by that one's owning
of her If she could once be drowned by some one completely to not
wanting to give to such a one she might have owned some one for
loving but this never could come to be in her, she was too busy
being drowned when she was drowning, she had not then any strength
for owning. So then this one never owned any one, sometimes she was
almost drowned by engulfing by some one needing her then. This is
interesting and now this one I am now to be describing is of the
same family as this one but it is in this one a very different
thing this one can engulf those this one needs for living. This
will be very interesting.</p>

<p>This is a little of the way I feel the resisting being in this
one and this is the way it acts in this one. Later then, and I have
already been beginning, I will then compare it with the resisting
being in one. These two then are of the same kind of them but this
being in them is very different in its action. To begin then.</p>

<p>The first one the one when it is lightish brown and gritty a
little and sometimes very fluid and thin and sometimes almost dried
hard and not really smooth then, in this one then it has a very
different action this bottom nature from that in the one where it
is dark and smooth and murkier and always about the same state of
being a thickish fluid state there in her. These then are two kinds
of a kind of men and women. This is now some description of the
differences in being and acting, resisting and attacking, loving,
owning, yielding, having vanity and stupid being in them, practical
and ideal being in them.</p>

<p>The first one then as I was saying has as bottom nature in her
being, resisting, this was then the action of this bottom nature in
her that she never really gave herself to any one to own them,
though always she wanted to be giving herself to some one, always
she wanted to be owning every one, sometimes some one would be
engulfing this one, but she was resisting then, and once when she
was not resisting some one engulfed her so completely that what she
is, the bottom being in her, was watered so thin that it was not of
strength enough to cling to any one as dirt to hold them, to stick
on them as it would if it were thick enough to own to inclose them
by encasing them. This is true then that this one had it to be that
the resisting substance was sometimes very thin and never thick but
sometimes almost dried up into a grey brown, it looked browner
thin, a little more grey when it was not wet, very thin, stuff in
her. This being in her then made it that this one never gave
herself to any one and never owned any one, sometimes was drowned
by some one, always was a little gritty to the feeling of every
one. Another one then one I am now beginning to describe as
knowing, this one then was darker, smoother, thicker always a thick
fluid in the being in her, in the bottom nature of her. There are
many men and many women of both these two kinds of the one kind of
them, the resisting engulfing kind of them, of men and women.</p>

<p>This second one then had as I was saying a thicker darker
smoother, always as a thick fluid, the bottom nature in her. This
one then had a power of engulfing some she needed for living, this
one then could own some but mostly this one did not need any one,
this being in her was enough to give to her a sense of superiority
inside her, she had in her the sense of completely engulfing
anything she needed for living and so she had in her a complete
vanity a complete sense of superiority to every one. The other one
had a sense of being aggrieved at never really owning any one. This
one in her thicker, dark, murkier smoother bottom being had not any
such feeling, mostly this one was not engulfing any one but the
sensation of the feeling of potential engulfing gave to this one a
complete sense of superior being to every one, there was no need
then in this one for action. The other one, the first one, from her
never owning any one and having the feeling of not engulfing any
one needed that every one should be flattering to keep this one
from feeling too much the fact I hat there was no place for living
for this one, the other one did not need such consolation, there
was not any place for living for the other one but this was not a
need to her, the vanity in her from the bottom substance of her
made her completely then impervious to the need of any place for
living, this one then when she was not engulfing any one and mostly
this one was not engulfing any one this one was then engulfing her
own self in the bottom nature in her and this gave to her a
complete vanity of being in her, always there was there in her
herself to be completely engulfed in the bottom nature of her and
this gave to herself a sense of power and this was complete vanity
in her and there was then no need in her of a place for living for
her.</p>

<p>Sometimes the being in her led to reckless outbreaks from her.
As I was saying resisting being as its way of attacking, attacking
mostly in such men and women has not in it the strength for winning
fighting, mostly it is weaker than the personal quality of
resisting in such of them. In some who have resisting being,
attacking is their way of living and mostly such of them are not
very strong in winning in living or in fighting although they are,
some of such a kind of them, fairly successful in practical living.
Winning in loving or in fighting is the test in such of them. Some
time this will be clear in them, the men and women having resisting
being, sometime there will be very much description of the way of
attacking in these men and women having resisting being as their
natural way of being, as their way of loving, as their way of
winning fighting.</p>

<p>The first one, the one I was before describing, this one had
attacking in living but mostly it was in her as the finding of
their being no place to her for living, this was mostly all there
was of attacking being in her, always knowing, always finding the
good reason why not any place was a place for living to her. The
other one had it as making her sometimes have reckless being in
her, attacking being at moments was in her, she was then not to
herself engulfing any one but the sense of superiority always in
her the vanity that was completely inside her there could let her
be reckless in attacking and mostly she was then not succeeding,
but this did not then lead to any thing for always there was in her
complete the vanity and superiority inside her that the power of
completely engulfing herself always made in her. These two are
different then, the differences are interesting. They are then two
kinds of one kind of a general kind of being in men and women, they
have each of them then as a bottom nature in them one kind of one
kind of a general resisting kind of being.</p>

<p>There is another thing in the two of them, efficiency in doing
anything. Always in the first one there is a desire to run things
and this one does not do these things very well nor very badly
either but to herself efficiency is strong in her and this is part
of the wanting to own other ones for her living and mostly they do
not really have her own them and this always is part to her of
there not being any place for living for her. Owning others is a
right to her, doing it is not ever very successful in her, always
then this one has this desire and always then this one does not
ever give herself to do it for any one for really this one must own
another one to really contentedly to herself to do the thing for
that other one. Sometimes as I was saying some one engulfs this one
and then this one can do things for the other one, it is the
nearest to owning any one this one ever comes to do in living.
Always then not owning any one is the tragedy in this one, always
every one flatters this one to make this one feel a little moment
that this one owns them or some other one. The second one,
engulfing herself giving power to this one, superiority in herself
to every one, and complete vanity then being in her, this one does
not need doing anything for any one to give to her a sense of
owning them. This one is efficient enough in acting. Mostly to this
one this is not interesting. These then have in them two kinds of
engulfing resisting being as bottom natures in them.</p>

<p>Every one has their own being in them. Every one is of a kind in
men and women. Each one has a bottom nature in them, this nature is
of a kind of nature that makes a kind in men and women.</p>

<p>Everybody is a real one to me, everybody is like some one else
too to me. There will be now more descriptions of kinds in men and
women, of the likenesses and unlikenesses between them, of seeing
kinds in men and women in the bottom natures of them. Every one has
some feeling of knowing kinds in men and women. This will now be
more description of some ways of feeling kinds in men and
women.</p>

<p>More and more then there will be histories of all the kinds
there are of men and women.</p>

<p>Each one is of a kind of men and women from the bottom nature in
them. This is then one way of making kinds in men and women.</p>

<p>Sometime each one comes to be clear to me, the kind they are
then from the bottom nature of them comes to be clear to me, makes
of them then to me this kind of men and women. This then sometime
comes to be clear to me in each one the bottom natures in them
making kinds for me in men and women.</p>

<p>Sometime then the bottom nature in each one is a certain thing
to some one knowing that one. Sometime then the bottom nature in
each one is a clear thing to some one. There is then a kind of
understanding of that one. Sometime each one comes to be a whole
one to some one, the bottom nature in that one, the other nature or
natures in that one, the whole being, living, way of doing
everything, the whole history of that one comes sometime to be
clear to some one. Sometime each one so comes to be a whole one to
some one. Mostly sometime mostly every one I am ever knowing comes
so to be a whole one to me and now I am telling of the learning of
this in some, the learning having them as a whole one to me.</p>

<p>Sometime then mostly each one comes to be a whole one to me.
Sometime the bottom nature in each one, the other nature or natures
in each one, the mixing or not mixing of the natures in them comes
to be clear to me in mostly every one I am ever knowing, each one
then is a complete one to me, each one then keeps repeating the
whole history of them, this is now some description of my learning
to hear, see and feel the whole repeating coming out of some.</p>

<p>As I was saying there is a bottom nature in every one, the other
nature or natures in them may be of this kind of men and women that
is of the same kind as the bottom nature of them, they may not be
of the same kind of them. If the bottom nature of them is resisting
the other nature or natures in them may be all resisting, some
kinds of resisting and some attacking, all of the other natures in
them may be of kinds of attacking, if the bottom nature in them is
a kind of attacking being the other nature or natures in them may
be of kinds of resisting, of kinds of attacking, some of kinds of
resisting, some of kinds of attacking, some may have only a bottom
nature to them, some may have almost, nothing of bottom nature to
them, there is every kind of mixing, mostly in each one it is very
confusing, often each one one is ever knowing is for a long time
baffling.</p>

<p>Some are puzzling a long time, almost every one is more or less
puzzling to every one, mostly every one is puzzling to me, sometime
mostly every one comes to be a whole one to me.</p>

<p>Always then I am learning some one. Mostly every one comes very
slowly to be a whole one to me. Mostly everyone is sometimes and
mostly for a very long time a puzzle to me, sometimes some one only
after a long time of learning that one comes to be a conscious
puzzle to me.</p>

<p>Some can have a bottom with other nature or natures in them not
mixed up with the bottom nature in them. Such of them are very
puzzling and when sometimes such a one is a whole to one such ones
always are in parts to one but all the parts are there in that one
to one and all always repeating in that one and all repeating
coming out of such a one has meaning as parts in one. When some one
is not a whole one to one repeating coming out of them has not this
clear relation. Such a one as I am now describing is not in pieces,
is a whole one. All of such a one is almost completely one and then
the bottom of that one is of a different kind from the rest of the
whole one and that makes this one not confusing but baffling and
sometimes a clear whole one, and then at last a completer whole
one. When some one is not a whole one to one repeating coming out
of them has not clear relation but sometimes repeating coming out
of one has the clear relation of a whole one and it is not the
whole of that one that the one feeling the clear relation in all
the repeating is really knowing, there is a bottom nature that is
different from all the rest of that one. Sooner or later some one
knowing this will know it of this one, in the beginning of not
being certain that the whole one one is knowing is the whole of
that one is a strange feeling, not doubting, not puzzling, not
baffling, just incompletion. Then such a one is a little puzzling
until that one comes to be a whole whole one. Then the repeating
coming out of such a one has clear meaning.</p>

<p>This was one, that I am now describing, was to this one and to
every one, of the resisting kind of them, slow, earthy, dependent
independent kind of them and as such a one was to this one and to
every one that knew this one a whole one. The bottom being in this
one was not resisting being, it was attacking being, reaction in
this one was poignant and quick in this one but it was to this one
and to every one who knew this one slow in this one because it
passed through the whole rest of this one that was resisting, slow,
earthy kind of being and so this one was not slow-minded but
long-winded, this one had complete quick poignant decision and
reaction and then passing through the rest of being in this one it
made it to be to this one that it was slow-deciding, germinating in
this one and it was no such thing. This was interesting to know for
this one had been a whole one to the other way of feeling this one,
but it was not the whole of this one, and this understanding of
this one gave a completely new meaning to the being, to the history
of this one.</p>

<p>To explain again. This one was mostly smooth, resisting
self-sustaining, dependent independent being, this was the being in
this one to this one and mostly to every one, only the history of
the living of this one was not completely what the history of such
being is in those having such being as the whole of them. Mostly
this was not puzzling as it might be some other thing in this one,
some incompletion of condition in this one, and this one was as
this being so completely a whole one. Then it came to be clear in
this one that this was not the whole of this one. The bottom
nature, and the bottom nature in this one always was acting but
never to this one in the talking this one did of the being in this
one to any one was it existing, nor to any one not paying much
attention to the history of the living in this one but just to the
ways of doing things in this one was it existing, the bottom being
in this one as I was saying always was there acting and sometime it
was clear to some one that this one was not at the bottom slow,
resisting, self-sustained, dependent independent being, at the
bottom this one was quick feeling, attacking, sensitive,
independent dependent being and that gave to the history of this
one a new meaning.</p>

<p>There is one thing very interesting. Those who have this kind of
mixing, all of them one thing except just the bottom and that not
mixing with the rest of them but always acting, are always romantic
in their notion of themselves in living. This is a natural thing,
everything in them is one thing, resisting or attacking being as it
may happen, everything they or any one can see in them is this
thing then a complete one and yet the bottom of them always acting
is another thing. This is bound to make them, such of them, have a
complete creation of their own being a completed conception of
their own being and always it is not the whole being in them,
indeed it is never the true meaning of their being and so they have
many of them a very romantic feeling in being. This is very
interesting. There are many ways of having romantic feeling of
one's own being, this is one of them, sometime there will be
descriptions of many of them. It is very interesting to know all
the ways of having romantic feeling of one's self in living. These
then that I have been just describing are not romantic in living,
the bottom being in them is too actually acting in them and that
determines the history of them, they are romantic in the
contemplation of their personality, not knowing the determining
thing in them the bottom being and so they romantically conceive
themselves as a whole of what is all them but the bottom being in
them that really determines the being, way of doing, the history of
them.</p>

<p>Now there will be a description of another kind of contradiction
between bottom nature and the other natures in men and women. To
begin again then.</p>

<p>This one then too is of the kind of them that have it to be a
romantic temperament, a feeling of themselves as being guided by a
destiny always from the beginning and unchanging. All of these
then, this last one and this one, have it to be to themselves that
they are as they are and nothing can change them, not from firmness
of will in them, not from intention or resolution in them, but from
the destiny of them always in them from the beginning. These are
then this kind of men and women, all of this kind of romantic
temperaments with to them a fixed destiny in them, all of these
then are an almost complete one thing with another bottom, this
keeps them such of them from being a complete unification of being,
the bottom of them that is the opposite kind of being, if they are
all resisting then the bottom always active in them is attacking
being with all the quality of that kind of attacking being, if all
the rest of them is attacking being the bottom being in such of
them and always active in them is resisting being with all the
quality of that kind of resisting being, this makes in such of them
romantic feeling of themselves as being unchanging. They, this kind
of men and women only know in themselves all except the bottom
being in them and that makes them to themselves unchanging, having
a destiny from the beginning, these then do not know in themselves
the bottom being that interferes and acts and sometimes to them
spoils their history for them, these then only know in themselves
all the rest of themselves except the bottom being in them. This is
very interesting. Perhaps Napoleon was one of this kind of men and
women.</p>

<p>This one that I am now describing had it to be all of the being
excepting the bottom being overwhelmingly powerful attacking being,
and as a bottom being there was in this one the earthy type that is
of the kind of resisting being that is earthy, indolent, slowly
engulfing. This one then had it to have as a bottom being indolent
earthy being, practical and easy and slowly engulfing in its
natural way of winning, with not much energy in acting, with almost
not anything of attacking being of the resisting being and this was
just there as a bottom, all the rest of the being in this one which
was destiny and living to this one was keen and synthetic and
poignant and complete attacking being.</p>

<p>All through the early living of this one the bottom being was
just there alive in this one and always acting but so to speak not
interfering to domination, to being the real being in this one as
controlling being. More and more as this one grew older and the
fire of youth and the energy in this one did not hold the whole of
this one together, the nature in this one separated into the top
and bottom both active but not acting together. This made this one
then stupidly obstinate with the attacking top in this one,
lethargic with the resisting indolent bottom in this one,
vain-glorious with the sense of destiny and success of the top
being in this one and nervously irritable with the disturbed bottom
being in this one. This is then one kind of being in men and women,
these then have been two examples of this kind of being, sometime
every one will understand all being in men and women.</p>

<p>These then are one kind of way of being one with the bottom
attacking, one with the bottom the resisting kind of them, these,
two I have been just describing. Then these are one kind of way of
being these two that I have been just describing where there is the
contradiction I have been just explaining. Now this is to be a
description of a kind of being where all the nature is of one kind
of being and yet where there is a contradiction in the being. To
begin then.</p>

<p>Mostly every one is sometime and sometimes for a very long time
puzzling. This one I am now going to be describing was for a long
time a puzzle to me. This one as I was saying was, the whole of
this one, of one kind of being, of attacking being, but this one
was contradictory and confusing and for a long time a very long
time puzzling. This is the history of my learning this one, this is
a description of the being in this one.</p>

<p>Thinking one's self good is very important to understand in each
one. Goodness and stupid being in each one it is very important to
understand in each one. Each kind of them then, each kind of men
and women have their own kind of stupid being, their own kind of
goodness or badness in them, each kind in men and women have their
own way of feeling themselves as good inside them. Some have very
much of this in them, some have very little of this in them. Some
have very much stupid being of their kind of them in them, some
have very little of their kind of stupid being in them. Some have
very much of the goodness of their kind of being in them, some have
very little of it in them. Some have very much of the badness of
their kind of being in them, some have very little of it in
them.</p>

<p>Each kind of them each kind of men and women have the kind of
stupid being, the kind of goodness, the kind of badness of their
kind of being in them, each one of them have the feeling of their
goodness inside them in the kind of way their kind of being always
has such feeling.</p>

<p>This is now some description of the way each kind of men and
women have their own kind of way of having stupid being in them,
their own kind of stupid being in them, their own kind of way of
having goodness in them, their own kind of goodness in them, their
own kind of way of having badness in them, of having their own kind
of badness in them.</p>

<p>Each kind of men and women has a certain kind of stupid being, a
certain kind of goodness and a certain kind of badness that is
their kind of them, that is in common to all men and women of their
kind of them, part of them like their kind of way of loving,
fighting, working, thinking, eating, drinking, enjoying, disliking,
having impatient and angry feeling.</p>

<p>Now there will be some description of the way each kind in men
and women has their own way of having stupid being, goodness,
badness, knowing their own goodness, knowing their own badness in
them. I tell all this now, now when I am still a little puzzling at
it. Sometime I will understand it, then I will tell more of it. Now
I tell it when now I am still puzzling at it.</p>

<p>Each one then is of a kind of men and women. Each one then has a
bottom nature of a kind of men and women in them, many have other
nature or natures in them.</p>

<p>Two that I am now going to describe a little are each one of
them of one kind of being completely. Each one of them was
puzzling, one, the first one was a very long time to me baffling,
this was a very curious thing and I will now begin to tell about
it, to explain it, the being in this one, the learning in me of the
being in this one. I tell it now when now it is still a little
puzzling. I know it a little and I begin now to tell all I know yet
of it.</p>

<p>Every one has their own being in them. Every one is of a kind of
men and women. Each one is a separate one and yet always
repeated.</p>

<p>There are then many kinds in men and women. There are two kinds
of them, there are many kinds of these kinds of them, there are
many kinds in each one of the many kinds of each kind of them.</p>

<p>Supposing there is one kind of them, that some one knows say ten
of that kind of them among those that one has come to know in
living. Now in these ten of that kind of them some have this kind
of being that makes this kind of them as bottom being, some have
other kinds of being mixed up in them with this bottom being in
them. Some of these ten of them have not this kind of being as
bottom being in them, they have some other kind of being in them
and have this kind of being, that of the ten of them, mixed with
the bottom being in them. There are some of these ten of them that
have in them only this being in them, the being that makes alike
these ten of them in their way of being, doing everything, feeling,
loving.</p>

<p>As I was saying each kind of them has its own way of being
stupid, being loving, being good, being bad, winning fighting,
believing in themselves as being good, believing in themselves as
being bad.</p>

<p>Each one has in him, has in her their own kind of being, each
one has in him, has in her that kind of being stronger in some
parts than in other parts of them, some have it in them drier,
wetter, stronger, weaker, the kind of being that is their kind of
being in them.</p>

<p>More and more I would like to make it clear to some one how I
see men and women, how I see kinds in men and women. I know a good
deal of it now though always I am puzzling, beginning again and
again and again, feeling it all is fabrication and always I am
knowing that really I see a very certain thing in my way of seeing
kinds in men and women, that I am really understanding the meaning
of the being in them. I know a great deal then and I tell it now
when I am still puzzling.</p>

<p>This is a hard thing I am now beginning explaining, it is a
fairly clear thing now to me, it is not all clear yet to me, I tell
it now when now I am still having a good deal of puzzling thinking
in my learning understanding.</p>

<p>There was one then and he was very puzzling. This one was to me
a very long time very baffling. This one seemed all of one kind of
being, this one seemed a whole being to me always and always I was
not understanding. This one had been and was really something in
living, this one had done important working, this one was a whole
one and yet this one was not a whole one and yet surely there was
in this one only one kind of being, it was very puzzling.</p>

<p>Say these ten then, they each one have in them some way,
somehow, in some part of them a being common to all of them. Each
one of them has his or her own being, each one of them is separate
and resembling. Each one of them have a kind of being in them, some
of them have several kinds of being mixed up in them, all of them
have one certain kind of being in them, some of them have only that
one kind of being in them. The one I am now thinking of describing
was one of such of them, this one then had one kind of being and
this was clear and yet this one was a contradiction inside him,
this one was for a long time very baffling. This one is now fairly
clear to my understanding, I am describing this one now when I am
still a little puzzling over this one.</p>

<p>I know for fairly certain now something of the meaning of the
being in this one and I am now beginning the telling of the meaning
of the being in this one though now still I am a little puzzling
over understanding this one.</p>

<p>As I was saying, take one kind of being, say ten men and women
have this kind of being, some of these ten have other kinds of
being mixed up in them but that is not what I am now
discussing.</p>

<p>As I was saying, take ten men and women having in them a kind of
being in them, not a general kind of resemblance between them but a
pretty close resemblance between them, this is now a pretty small
subdivision of men and women, of course there are many millions
always living of this kind of them but say I have in all my living
known ten of them, that is now a subdivision, a particular kind of
them that have each one of them a kind of being in them that is
very definite in its character in each one of them giving to each
one of them a very definite way of learning, loving, fighting,
escaping, having stupid being in them, having moral or unmoral or
immoral meanings in them.</p>

<p>This then now is clear, this is a definite kind of being, this
being in some way in all of these ten men and women. This kind of
them is one subdivision of attacking being. This kind of them have
it in them to mostly succeed fairly well in living, some of course
are failing, some of every kind of being are succeeding and some
are failing but some of kinds of men and women have it to have more
of them succeeding than failing, some kinds of them have more of
them failing than succeeding, some kinds of them have it to be
divided about even in succeeding and failing in living.</p>

<p>This kind of being then that all these ten have in them is a
kind of attacking being. In these attacking is mostly not very
active in them, loving in them is attacking being and most of them
have it to have loving strongly in them but in most of them loving
being in them is overflowing into nervous being in them, this
nervous being in them is not energy in them as it is in some where
loving is nervous being, in these of them nervous being is an
excess in them, they have much passion in them, it is active in
them, it is nervous being in them, nervous being in them is not
active loving or attacking being in them. This is very clear in
them to any one knowing them, every one mostly who knows a fair
number of men and women knows certainly some of them, sometime some
one perhaps will know the kind of men and women I am now trying
describing. It is very discouraging, I begin again.</p>

<p>This kind of them then has not attacking as very active in them,
mostly they have in them much loving but there is in it so much
nervous being draining them, not entering into the active being in
them that many of them are not really active in loving. This kind
of them, the kind of being these ten have in common is very clear
to me from knowing these ten of them, I will now begin again to try
to describe them.</p>

<p>These then as I was saying, those having this being in them are
of the attacking kind in men and women, they most of them succeed
very well in living, most of them have very considerable loving
being in them, most of them have much nervous being in them. The
nervous being not being energy in them gives to many of them the
appearance of there being much repression in them, this is not as
true of them as it seems from the nervous being always showing. The
repression is an interpretation others have of them for this kind
of nervous being that these have in them that is not energy in them
is something like the nervous being that is generated in some men
and women whose nervous being is energy in them, from
repression.</p>

<p>All of them have this same kind of nervous being in them then,
all of them of whom I have been speaking, these ten of them. Some
have it more, some have it less in them, all of them have it in
them and it is not energy in them, it is not from repression in
them, it is part of their kind of being, those who have attacking
being but not much attacking action in them, a considerable
capacity for succeeding, a considerable capacity for loving. It is
very important to know then that in this kind of them nervous being
is not energy of action, not a result of suppressing themselves in
their loving or their living.</p>

<p>Mostly this kind of men and women have it in them to have more
loving, nervous being, intelligence, success in living, than
activity in attacking, emotion and feeling and enthusiasm. These
then have mostly much common sense but these have not much
practical sense in living. All this is very interesting and so now
I must begin again.</p>

<p>These ten of them have in them the same kind of being. There
will be now some more description of the being in them. This last
that I have been saying about the practical sense in them is not
very well expressed yet and so now I will try again.</p>

<p>This kind of being is as I was saying an attacking being with
not very much attacking fighting in them, these have in them mostly
the quality of succeeding well enough in living, they are
opportunists in living and they have moral conviction. Let me begin
again then, I will begin again to explain the being in them.</p>

<p>As I was saying earlier those having attacking being have it in
them to have in them a strong sense of the meaning, the emotion,
the use of the facts every one knows in living. Those having in
them resisting being have stronger in them a realisation of the
thing itself that makes the fact rather than the sense of the
meaning of the thing, the use of it. The resisting kind can love
money and living not for the use, emotion, meaning, but for the
thing itself as a thing existing. Sometime I will make this clearer
but this must do now as a beginning.</p>

<p>This kind then that I am now describing have as I was saying
attacking being but not much activity in attacking, they have sense
for facts as attacking being have them but they have not much
instinctive emotion about them or sense of the use of them, they
have in short no dramatic sense for facts in living but being of
the attacking kind of being these have a sense for the meaning of
facts in being and so it comes that this kind of them are
opportunistic, highly rationalising, unimaginative, having no
instinct for meaning in anything but regarding only the meaning and
the use in things, having no instinct for quality in people but
wanting completely to understand and use them.</p>

<p>I will take for more understanding of them the moral sense in
them. Say one of such of them being as is true of most of them
strongly wanting success in living, such a one knows then that
honesty is the best policy for him. This one then will completely
realise the meaning in this saying, to him it is wisdom, as the way
necessary for him to be acting to be succeeding. So far it is
opportunism in him, the embracing of this conviction that honesty
is the test policy for him. This then is the meaning to him in
honest living, and then such a one embraces this as a moral
principle, such a one then holds to this if it means ruin to him,
such a one has rationally and opportunistically embraced this way
of being, this one then makes of this an absolute conviction, a
complete moral principle for living, this one then has no sense for
opportunistically adapting himself in detail in living, such a one
has no practical dramatic sense for living, such a one has
attacking being but no activity in attacking, such a one has
embraced a creed from the sense of succeeding, of rational
opportunism, it is then a moral conviction in this one, this one
then has no imagination for facts or people but this one can build
a complete system for living and if such a one has a good head on
him, such a one is mostly successful enough in living. Herbert
Spencer was such a kind of one.</p>

<p>These then, these ten of them have it to have in common a kind
of being that is of the attacking kind of being but these have not
much activity of attacking in them, many of these are successful
enough in living, mostly these have pretty strongly loving being in
them, these have mostly strongly nervousness in them and this
nervousness is not part of energy in them, it is not energy in them
and that is the reason there is very little attacking being in
them, it is something like that kind of nervousness that comes from
repression in some men and women but mostly repression is not in
this kind of them, mostly these are opportunists at the bottom of
them though they all of them mostly at some time make of some
principle a rationally constructed system and then make of that
system a moral conviction, and so these of them are a curious
spectacle of opportunism, rationalising passion, moral conviction,
nervousness, much love, emotion.</p>

<p>Mind then in all of this land in men and women is highly
rationalising, mostly these have not much instinct for being in
things and in men and women. What these realise as being in things
and in men and women is mostly true and alright for a beginning for
living but these then do not react to it in living, these
rationalise it and from that they come to a principle in living
that from then on all their life guides them. These have not then a
capacity for growing from experiencing for they have made their
conviction from their early realising and then it is in them a
principle of living, mostly in all of them this original
realisation in them is a fairly intelligent rationalised
opportunism. Perhaps this is clear now to some one. It is certainly
a clear thing for some one to be understanding, this is certainly a
clear thing in this kind of men and women.</p>

<p>These have then mostly quick clear minds but the results of
their thinking are not quick in coming as they are all of them
complicatedly rationalising, some of them think they have slow
minds but this is not true of them, they have the quick minds and
quick impressions of the attacking kind of being, but their minds
being so rationalising it takes them some time to complete the
whole thing, their mind begins with each thing and they think they
are slow in taking impressions because mostly they are closed to
impressions from anything as their mind when it is formulating is
occupying the whole of them and until their mind opens them again
they are closed to impressions and so as I was saying these mostly
have little power of experiencing.</p>

<p>Now all this leads to very complicated things in each one having
in them such a being, those having good minds, better minds than
capacity for experiencing, such can have some principle of growth
in them, for their minds can keep them open to all impressions they
are capable of receiving and can make the most use of those
impressions that they have received inside them. Those having mind
only about as strong as the power of receiving impressions in them,
such of them just keep going, they are fairly successful in living
some of them, there is not much growth in them. There are some of
them who have finer power of receiving impressions than quality of
mind to direct them and these then more and more are stultified in
their living by running themselves by their minds as all of those
having this kind of being always do run themselves. This is now a
description of learning the last kind of one as a whole one. This
then is now a description of one of them, one of these ten of
them.</p>

<p>This one for many years was baffling to me. It was evident that
all the being in this one always was repeating to every one's
hearing, it was evident that in this one there was not a mixture of
many kinds of being and yet this one was baffling, this one had
strange contradictions in him. This one said of himself that he had
a slow-working mind, this one had to himself and to every one a
moral passion for goodness in him, this one was to every one
generous and disinterested in thinking and in being, this one was
an opportunist in living, this one had very fine sensibilities to
beauty and to luxury in living, this one very often was not open to
any such impression, this one had a passion for being loving, this
one had not any really passionate loving in him, this one had a
fixed scheme of living for grace and beauty and had no grace in him
and no power of creating beauty in the conditions of living around
him, this one had much ambition and was very successful in living,
this one then was baffling and for a long long time I was puzzling
and puzzling and now this one is a clear one to me. Each one, as I
was saying, having a kind of being in them has that being in them
in different intensities, proportions, they have in them too most
of them different kinds of beings mixed up in them but that is not
what I am now considering. Each one then of these ten of them of
this kind of them that I have been describing, all of these ten of
them then that I have known in living has it in them to have this
nature in them the kind of nature that is common to all these ten,
in different proportions, different intensities, different relation
of one part to the other part of the nature and so each one of them
had their own being in them, each one was separate, each one was
resembling to the others of them. Some of them have other natures
too in them that make the things I have been describing, acting
differently in them, some of them had this being that I have been
describing as a bottom nature to them, others have it as a nature
mixed up with another kind of nature in them, one of them had it as
the whole being in him, and this one I am now beginning to describe
my learning as a whole one. Each one sometime is a whole one to me,
each one sometime is a whole one in me, this one for a long time
was baffling, this one now is a whole one to me, this one now I am
again beginning describing learning.</p>

<p>Each one having the kind of being in them that I have been just
describing has in her or in him more or less of all the things, all
the things in him or in her, I have been describing. Each one of
these then has more or less opportunism in their feeling about
living, each one of them has loving being that is of the attacking
kind but not active in attacking, often very desiring, sometimes
appearing engulfing, sometimes never coming into the relation of
loving. Each one of this kind of them have a mind that is slow only
because it takes much time in going through many logical processes
to a conclusion, not slow in actual action, not slow in developing,
mostly all of this kind of men and women are quite the same in ways
of thinking, learning, understanding, quite from their beginning,
there is then in the minds of this kind of men not much developing.
Each one of them or this kind in men and women has more or less in
them the way of making of whatever was the beginning of their
living and the conclusions from this beginning a principle that in
some is like a firm moral resolution. In all of this kind of them
this acting of the mind in them cuts them off from experiencing,
they are of the attacking kind in men and women, things are
important to them as use, emotion, passion gives them meaning but
these have not any of them activity in attacking being and so they
have not imagination or dramatic sense of meaning in them, they
have not a spontaneous relation to things in living, in some way in
each one of them it, the experience, must go through their more or
less rationalising mind before reaction acting to the fact is in
them and so then they are not often getting into trouble but most
of their living they are not experiencing. This is strange in them
when they have strongly in them a love of beauty and luxury in them
and this will be soon the history of one of such of them. In all of
them then all these ten who have it to have this being in common in
them, in all of them there is more or less actively in them all
these things I have been describing, mostly in each one there is
enough more of one part than another part of this being in them to
make the meaning of their being a fairly clear thing in them, to
make their living and their being have a fairly clear meaning, in
some of these ten there are other natures in them, in some other
nature as bottom being in them but that we are not just now
considering. As I was saying many having a being in them have the
balance of that being in them so kept that one kind of living, one
kind of existing is natural to them and has meaning, this was true
then of most of these ten of whom I have been talking, it was not
true of all of them.</p>

<p>In one the one I am now beginning describing, the one who was a
long time baffling to me, all these things I have been describing
as the being of this one kind of being were equally strongly in
him, all these things then, all of them were equally strongly
repeating in him all through his living and so this one was
baffling, for mostly in every one all the qualities in a kind of
being are not equally active in them. This made this one baffling.
This made this one puzzling for this one had profound impression by
beauty and this was complete and poignant and quick in him and he
had the rationalising mind acting on each piece of impression and
shutting him off from getting deep and poignant and complete
impressions from things before him and so he was puzzling, he had
opportunism so strongly in him that each time he was open to a new
relation with anything in life or a man or a woman he acted in this
way toward them and also he had created for himself a whole
rationalised scheme of living of beauty and goodness and fairness
to every one because that was the way to make the living that would
be successful and beautiful, to him. Always to himself he was
always open to feeling beauty and goodness and nobility in living,
always to himself he had made a scheme of complete living in luxury
and success and winning admiration, always to himself he could
completely understand everything with his mind which was to himself
a great thing in him, never was he ever knowing that his running
himself by his mind which was making always for him his theory of
beauty and goodness and luxury was closing him to impressions of
beauty and luxury and learning. This he never knew in him. He did
not know his kind of a mind had never any relation to experience
excepting as a beginning, when his mind was working he was shut off
from experiencing, such being the way a mind works in this kind of
being, and so this one was baffling, no one would ever expect one
person, one man or one woman, would have in the completest form all
the parts of a kind of being and so this one was baffling, there
was complete contradiction in him and yet he was all of one kind of
being, this one then was baffling and for a long time this one was
not a whole one to me and then I understood the meaning in him, he
had it in him all the qualities of this kind of being that was in
any of these ten that I have said all had in them this kind of
being.</p>

<p>This is very clear to me now. Now I am not any longer puzzling
about this one. This is not very clear yet in my telling. This will
be clearer when I have told of the loving being in this one. There
are many ways of having loving feeling, this one that I am now
describing had loving feeling in every kind of way any one having
the kind of being common to these ten could have it in her or in
him.</p>

<p>Each kind of being has then its own way of loving, of having
loving feeling, of having it and having it to themselves as
themselves acting in it. This one, the one I am now describing had
it in every way this one's kind of being can have it.</p>

<p>Those having this kind of being have as I was saying much
nervous being that is not energy in them as attacking being, as
loving, though it is very much like repressed active being or
repressed loving being, but it is not that in them. This so far is
clear to me. I am telling all this now, now when it is still a
little a puzzle to me.</p>

<p>So then this one had all the ways of having loving being this
kind of them can have it in them. Mostly this kind in men and women
have a good deal of loving being in them, though in many of them it
does not in them come to loving any man or any woman for as I was
saying attacking being is not active in them, and in many of them
loving being is just there in them, being there in them as nervous
being is in them which is not attacking energy in them. Generally
then in this kind of them although there is much loving being in
them it does not express itself in loving any particular one until
some particular one having very strongly being in them enormously
stimulating these makes the loving being in them active to loving
that one. It is not, and this is very important to know in them and
to remember of them to understand this kind of them, it is not that
loving being is not awakened in them, it is very lively in most of
this kind of them in every moment of the living of this kind of
them, there is not restraint in this kind of them, it is that this
kind of them are of the attacking kind in men and women and
attacking activity is not active in them. This is now clear in them
in the loving in them, in the thinking in them, in the practical
living in them. It is clear to me now of them. I am not now any
longer in a puzzle about them. Perhaps sometime it will be clear to
some other one from the description I have been giving of them.</p>

<p>So then that is loving women in them, loving men in them, but
this is not the only loving feeling in them. These have in them
another kind of loving feeling in them, affection for goodness and
beauty and nobility in everything and in men and in women and an
affection for the feeling of being able to feel inside them loving
for luxury and extravagance and sinning. I am now describing this
in them now when it is still a little a puzzle to me. Perhaps it
will be clearer to me. Now I will tell it as clearly as I know it.
I will tell it, a little confusing it as I tell it, for it is so
that I now know it. Sometime I will know more of it. Then I will
certainly tell more of it.</p>

<p>They have then this kind of them, they have much affectionate
being in them, not emotional affection in them but affection like
the kind of thinking being there is in them, to making of something
they were experiencing as important to them a principle in them to
be always in them. Sometimes this is affection for some one, some
kind of thing, for goodness, nobility and virtue and beauty and
luxury and sinning and succeeding in living by doing anything. In
such a one then one of this kind of them affection that is like a
moral principle in them can be for any or some or all of these
things that I have been naming, and then it is with these then as
in their living as I have described it in them, affection for any
of these things is a constant thing in them as constant as the
ruling principle they embrace with their minds for living after
having rationalised it from some experiencing. So then these ten of
this kind of them all have in them the kind of loving being this
kind of them have as their natural way of being. They have, most of
them, very much loving being, but they have not attacking as active
in them though they are of the attacking kind of being and so all
of them to get it as attacking in them the loving being in them
have to have strongly stimulation. Mostly all of them have much
loving being always in them and mostly always every one who ever
knows any one of them knows this in them but mostly always as I was
saying they need very strong stimulation in the being in the other
one to make it an attacking thing in them. It is not repressed in
them, it is not dormant in them, it is there as evident in them to
every one who knows any one of them as is the nervous being in them
that is not attacking energy in them. They have then all of them,
some more some less in them, but mostly all of this kind of them a
good deal of such kind of loving being in them. They have in them
much affection in them mostly all of them and this is in them like
the thinking being in them like the rationalising some experience
they have chosen and then made into a conviction like a moral
principle. These then do this with a feeling for any one, with a
feeling for anything, any feeling that has convinced them, they
make this then, this kind of them into a conviction and they are
not often getting for this new experiencing, just as they are not
in working and thinking in relation to experience, as a continuous
thing in living. This is clear then to some one, it is clear now to
me and now I tell it, knowing it now to clearly understand it.</p>

<p>The one of the ten of them that I have been describing had all
these kinds of ways of having loving feeling strongly in him in his
living and so this one was perplexing.</p>

<p>Now I will finish up this one. Now I will tell of my learning
this one of this one coming to be a whole one to me.</p>

<p>This one was for a long time baffling to me. I was telling every
one of this one when this one was still a very baffling one to me.
Now this one is mostly all clear to me inside me. This one is now a
whole one to me. This is the way I learned this one so that this
one was a whole one to me. As I was saying every one always is
repeating the whole of them. As I was saying sometimes it takes
many years of hearing the repeating in one before the whole being
is clear to the understanding of one who has it as being to love
repeating, to know that always every one is repeating the whole of
them, to have it that sometime each one is a whole one to that one.
This then the way I am now describing learning this one, this then
is one of the ways then that such a one, one who has it as being to
love repeating, to know that always every one is repeating the
whole of them, comes to a completed understanding of every one.</p>

<p>This then is now a little a description of the way I learned
this one so that this one is a whole one to me.</p>

<p>Now I will finish up this one. Now I will tell of my learning
this one, of this one coming to be a whole one inside me.</p>

<p>This one was a long time perplexing to me because this one was
very evidently made up of only one kind of being and yet always
there were absolute contradictions in his being. There is a kind of
being say in ten men, each one of these ten have the kind of being
that is common to all the ten of them in him as being more
emphasized in one direction than in the other direction. For
instance in this kind of being that I have been just describing one
of these ten will have the being in him so that there is in him
much more strongly affection for succeeding in living than for
other things in him, another will have the being in him so that the
loving women is most strongly in him, some one will have the being
in him so that rationalising, logical thinking will be the
strongest thing in him, some of them will have the being in them so
that in each one of them the having the thing they have made a
moral conviction as moral conviction to perhaps almost fanaticism
as the strongest thing in her or in him, this may be in one of
these as a conviction of denying, of skepticism, of opportunism, of
socialism, of monarchism, of irreligion, of anything. There are
some then of this kind of them that have the power of experiencing
strong affection for beauty or luxury or truth as strongest in
them. In each one of these all the other things in this kind of
being are in them but mostly in all of them there is one part of
this kind of being that is strongest in them. This one that I have
been just describing was different in this from these others that I
have been just mentioning. This one had mostly everything of this
kind of being as equal in strength in him.</p>

<p>This one said of himself that he had a slow mind, this one had a
good mind and ran himself with this mind. This one had a capacity
for profound, poignant, affectionate, intuitive experiencing of
beauty, in him. This one was running himself by his mind and so,
often, was shutting himself off from experiencing, his mind not
letting him feel beauty in anything that his mind was not already
rationally admitting as a thing to be so experiencing. This one
then had the affection for truth and nobility and loyalty and made
of them a moral conviction, this one had the affection for luxury
and succeeding in living and being a superior being and this one
made of these things a moral conviction. This one had wanting
loving women in him and this one had protecting them as a moral
conviction, this with loving luxury and succeeding in living and
truth and loyalty and courage, and having in him the quality of not
having attacking being as active in him, not having loving as
attacking in him, all this made this one very confusing.</p>

<p>This one then was perplexing, slowly it came to me to know it to
be true of him that he had not, as this one thought he had, a slow
developing mind in him, the mind in him was slow only because it
went on logically working when all the actual learning had been
done by this one as experiencing and it seemed slow because this
one believing that his mind was developing things for him let this
mind run him and keep him from poignant experiencing and so this
one was to himself a person slowly developing himself and
everything in him and this was not true of him, he was slow-minded
to himself then not because he had any slow-minded resisting being
in him but because his mind was just doing with rationalising what
this one had already done with experiencing. This then led to bad
things in this one in developing for this one more and more
believing in his mind as slowly developing in himself and slowly
developing learning, let himself be run by it himself and his mind
was not as fine an instrument as his experiencing and so running
himself by his mind was not for this one a true way of developing.
For some of this kind of them it is the true way of developing, for
this one of them it was not the true way of developing.</p>

<p>It is now a little clear perhaps to some one how this one was
perplexing to me to make of this one a whole one, always this one
was then a puzzle to me, two things then made this one clear to me,
the knowing that his mind was not a slow steadily developing thing,
the recognition that although there was only one kind of being in
this one it was not a unified thing in him. It was not unified in
him as I found out by more thinking about this one because this one
had all the parts of the kind of being that was his kind of being
equally strongly in him and that then could not be a unified one
for there was nothing making a bottom and so then this one was
clear to me, this one was then a whole one to me, this one then was
such a one as I have been describing.</p>

<p>Now to give a little description of one who was of the resisting
kind of being and had a different kind of complication from that in
this one I have just been describing but one who also had only one
kind of being in him.</p>

<p>This one was one of one of the kinds in men and women that have
resisting being in them. As I was saying when I was describing
resisting being, these, those having resisting being in them, can
have this being in them in various ways depending on the conditions
so to be speaking of the substance in them, the substance that is
them.</p>

<p>This one that I am now beginning a little to tell about to make
the fifth one of the six that I am now describing in this
explaining of the way natures are and are mixed up in men and
women, this one had in him resisting being and one kind of
resisting being only in him and not any other kind of nature in
him. This one was perplexing too to every one but this one was
perplexing mostly to everyone for a different reason from that in
the case of any of the others that I have been describing. This one
was perplexing to every one by reason of his failing to succeed in
living and this in this one was perplexing to every one that ever
came to know this one. This is now a little a history a little an
explanation of this one, a little a description of learning to
understand the being in this one. This one was then of the
resisting kind in men and women but as I was saying, sometimes it
is not easy to know it in one whether the being in that one is of
the resisting kind in them or of the attacking kind in them. This
is now perhaps to some one a little clearer in the way I know it in
men and women from the description I have just been giving of a
kind of them that have attacking being more or less as static in
them.</p>

<p>It is not then always easy even after much knowing of some one
to know whether the being in that one is attacking or resisting, in
them.</p>

<p>As I was saying, resisting being in some is in such a thin layer
in them that reaction in them is as quick in them as in those
having attacking being in them. In some, as I was saying, those
have resisting being in them have this in them as a mass dry in the
centre and only actively penetrable for reaction by them of the
surface of the being in them. In these then resisting being may be
very quick being, in some of such of them it may be almost
brilliantly quick being in them but mostly in those of them that
are brilliantly quick the central portion of them is not dead dry
in them it is living enough in them to give meaning to the clever
quick surface reaction in them. This is very clear to my feeling,
this is very clear in my knowing of this kind in men and women,
this must then sometimes be clearly made into a description. I am
now beginning again to make a description of this kind of being in
men and women.</p>

<p>There are then many millions always living having resisting
being in whom the resisting solid mass of being in each one of them
is not acting and so such of them never in their living are slow in
their thinking or their working. In such of them the part in them
that is active in them is the surface of this being and this gives
to such of them clever thinking and being. There are all varieties
in this kind of them as there are in all the kinds of them in all
the resisting kinds of them in all the attacking kinds of them. I
am always feeling each kind of them as a substance darker, lighter,
thinner, thicker, muddier, clearer, smoother, lumpier, granularer,
mixeder, simpler like every kind there is of earth or of anything
and always I am feeling in each one of them their kind of stuff as
much in them, as little in them, as all of a piece in them, as
lumps in them held together sometimes by parts of the same
sometimes by other kinds of stuff in them and always sooner or
later for each one I am feeling the stuff in them acting in them
and so sometime each one I am ever knowing comes to be made of
something really existing that is them and each one of them
sometime then is to me a kind of stuff that all of a certain kind
of men and a certain kind of women have in them as the material in
them that is bottom nature in them, that is other nature or natures
in them. Each one then sometime comes to be to me made out of a
real something that always is there acting and that is that one and
sometime then I really know that one, I really understand the
meaning of the being in that one.</p>

<p>The one I am now beginning to describe a little for there will
not be here now much description of this one, this one was of the
resisting kind of them and there was in this one clever being for
this one was of the kind of them I have been just describing, the
central mass in this one the slower fairly clear brown not
completely dry mass in him was not so active in him as the surface
of the mass in him that was quickly cleverly reacting. But in this
one this caused trouble in him that the central mass was not quite
dry in him, in some places the central mass was profoundly active
and this made a complication in this one that made it that this one
was not successful in living and this is very very interesting and
this is now a little a description of this one in which description
there will be a mingling of the history of this one, of the
description of the being in this one, of the learning by some to
understand the meaning of the being in this one.</p>

<p>This one as I was saying never really succeeded in living and
that was surprising to every one for this one was very clever and
quick and energetic, this one had really a quality of bottom
thinking, this one was strong in keeping going at working and
always this one was not succeeding in living, was not really
succeeding in anything. Always this one, though always this one was
working steadily and sometimes very cleverly, this one never really
finished anything. Always this one was capable of real thinking and
always this one was never understanding anything in himself or in
any one. And always this one knew it in him that he was failing.
Always this one had an exalted nature in him and always this one
was not in any way petty in his being and always this one was
always failing in being decently good to any one. Always then this
one was failing in living and this was perplexing him and
perplexing to every one that ever came to know this one, that ever
came to think about this problem. This was the history of him.</p>

<p>The being in him was as I was saying resisting being and this
one had in him only the one kind of being, that was the bottom
nature in him, there was not in him any other nature or natures of
any other kind of being in him and in this this one was like the
last one I was describing. This one was very different though from
the last one I was describing for this one had not all the being in
him possible to the kind of being that was his kind of being. This
one had however certain parts of the kind of being in him that were
natural parts of his kind of being, that without other parts of
that being being in him made a fundamental contradiction in his
being and this was the meaning of the being in this one. To begin
again then with thinking of a mass of being of the resisting
substance very active at the surface and active inside toward the
center only here and there, this was the being in this one and this
caused the trouble in this one.</p>

<p>Always then this one had in him active in him isolated spots in
the central resisting mass in him, these were in him as the
conceptions that were the starting in him of various schemes of
working, mostly the actual working in him was done by the quick
clever surface of him, always then these central live spots in the
whole mass of him would be reacting to all the mass of work the
surface of him had been doing and there was not enough
self-consciousness in him to know that it was a poorer kind of work
than he had wanted that he had been doing and it was to him only
that that time he had not succeeded in doing the work he had been
planning, and he must just begin again. So it went on with him and
so he never was finishing anything and the two kinds of activity of
the being in him being that they were of the same kind of being in
him never came to struggle together in him they just went on in him
and so he never was succeeding in his living, he never was
succeeding in anything, he never could finish anything with all his
steady energetic patient working.</p>

<p>So then when some one has in her or in him separate pieces
active of the one kind of being in them and not adjusted so that
one is dominating or when as in the last one I was describing some
one has all the pieces possible of one kind of being equally active
in him such a one can never really come to a completely
self-conscious being, such a one may be successful in living but
such a one never has in him a unified being, mostly such a one has
not in him any struggling of the pieces with each other in him. Of
this last I am not yet absolutely certain.</p>

<p>The meaning of the being in this last one came to some who had
often at moments thought about this one. Mostly no one puzzled
about this one, failing in living in this one, though succeeding in
living could have come to this one to every one, had something
about it curiously inevitably to any one who ever came to know this
one, and so as I was saying mostly no one really puzzled about this
one. One day some were thinking about the queer history of this one
and they began to think about a specific case in which this one had
not finished something and then it came to be clear to them for
they realised then that this one always was planning and
criticising his complete work with the chunks of slow solid central
intelligence and feeling in this one and always this one was
working with the surface of this one and this one was not
self-conscious ever to criticise his way of working, only to
criticise the specific result he had been achieving and so this one
always had to be beginning again and this was then the history of
this one. Sometime perhaps there will be written a complete history
of this one, sometime perhaps there will be written a complete
history of every one.</p>

<p>Now to give one little additional example. There will be very
little telling about this one. This one was different from the two
last ones I have been describing, this one had a mixing of natures
in him and very little in him of each of the kind of natures in
him. There was as a bottom being in him a kind of resisting being.
This one had as bottom being rather turgid resisting being. This
one had not much bottom being in him, not much of this rather
turgid resisting being in him. This one had such a kind of bottom
being in him, enough of it in him to be always evident in him to
any one really looking at him. This one had other natures mixed up
in him with this bottom nature of him in him. There was then not so
very much bottom nature in him, all that there was of it was of
this quite turgid between sodden resisting and engulfing resisting
being. There was enough of this in him as a bottom nature to him so
that every one really looking hard at him knew this in him. It was
in this way, by looking at him and so understanding, that one
knowing this one knew the bottom nature there in this one. There
were then other natures in this one. There was in this one mixed up
with the bottom nature in this one two other kinds of natures in
this one, one a kind of resisting being, one a kind of attacking
being. The kind of resisting being that was in him was of the kind
that I was describing in the first of these six that I am now
finishing. It was a kind of smooth dark very thick engulfing being
that has with it as a way of being, much complete vanity and
separation from contact with any one and much needing of indolence
and elegance and luxury to make life a pleasant thing for such a
one, elegance in luxury is a need for such a one. The kind of
attacking being there was in this one was of the kind that I have
been just describing in the one before the last one I have been
describing. This being gave to this one I am now describing an
affection for all beauty in living and in being, it gave to this
one that in the beginning of his conscious living this one had
embraced as a conviction the need of steady, unexalted, slightly
ambitious working.</p>

<p>This one having the rationalising mind of the kind of attacking
being that was one of the natures in him this one then knew very
early in his living that loving a beautiful life and needing
elegant luxury for pleasant living and yielding to these things in
him would soon lead him to be dominated by the bottom being of him,
the sodden resisting mixed with engulfing resisting bottom being in
him and this would lead him so that sooner or later the beautiful
life would be turned by him into an ugly one. This one dimly then
knew this in him, this one as I was saying had mixed up in him the
kind of attacking being that has it to be rationally minded and
ambitious of succeeding in living and having a power of it making
itself into a life-long resolution and a carrying of it out
completely during a whole living as if it were the natural way of
being in him, an instinctive being in him, the kind of living best
suited to the purposes rationally embraced by such a one. This one
then that I am describing knew that steady unexalted working which
was not to this one the whole natural way of being was the only way
of living for this one to keep this one from making ugly, beautiful
elegant luxurious being that was in him and that in this working
this one must not wait for the stimulation of experiencing, working
must go on in him always and experiencing and needing elegant
luxury and the bottom being in him must just be there acting while
always this one was working, always this one was succeeding fairly
well in living. Perhaps later this one would not succeed so well in
living, perhaps this one would be more and more worn out with his
working. Perhaps this is what would happen to such a one. This is a
description of one, one who had it in him to not be able to have a
beautiful elegant luxurious life in living because then later the
bottom being in this one would make the beautiful life an ugly one.
This one then lived by energised conviction in the attacking kind
of being there was in him mixed with the other being in him. This
one then was one that one could know the bottom being of him by
looking at him, mostly in his living he was working by energised
conviction, sometimes he would be worn out and then he would be not
succeeding very well in living but the balance of natures in him
would be in him as it had been always in his living. There was not
then in this one any active struggle of the natures in him, but
keeping them so balanced in him although it was not an effort in
him for energised vocation of working was as naturally active as
all the other kinds of being that were in him, that being the
peculiarity of the type of attacking being that this one had in
him, the keeping them so balanced in him was wearing, not to him,
for it was not an effort in him, but was wearing to his whole
being, his whole being would wear itself out by excessive
spontaneous equilibration and so this one more and more then would
be not successful in living but always up to the ending of the
acting living in this one the equilibration of natures in him would
be what I have been describing. Here ends then the describing of
the learning of the natures in the being of six kinds in men and
women.</p>

<p>Now then to begin again the history of Martha Hersland and of
every one she ever knew in living. Always there will be here
writing a description of all the kinds of ways there can be seen to
be kinds of men and women. There will be here then written the
complete history of every one Martha Hersland ever came to know in
her living, the fundamental character of every one, the bottom
natures in them, the other natures in them, the mixtures in them,
the strength and weakness of everything they have inside them.</p>

<p>Now then to begin again with a few men and women and now to
begin those of them as beginning. Now to begin again the history of
Martha Hersland, to give a history of her as beginning. Then to go
on with the history of Martha Hersland and of every one she ever
came to know in her living. Now to begin with the beginning of the
living of Martha Hersland. Now to begin the description of the
being in Martha Hersland in her beginning.</p>

<p>Sometime there will be a complete telling of all young living,
feeling, talking, thinking, being. Some have their real being to
themselves in young living, some do not have it then to themselves
in them. Later there will be a description of all the kinds of ways
there are of feeling themselves in young being.</p>

<p>This is now some description of being, of men and women in their
beginning, when they are children, they have then ways of being
resembling to each other that some of them lose in their later
living, there will be now some description of Martha Hersland in
her beginning.</p>

<p>Soon now there will be much description of the being in men and
women when they are young, when they are children, when they are
babies, when they are growing into young men and young women, there
will be then soon much description of the being coming out of them
then as repeating, then when they are beginning, when they are
babies and children and then growing into men and women.</p>

<p>This will soon be a description of many men and women in
beginning, the being young in them, the being children.</p>

<p>This is now a beginning of a description of the being in Martha
Hersland as beginning. In some the nature in them is clearer when
they are very young, in some when they are young, in some when they
are not so young, in some when they are old ones. Always in each
one it is there repeating, sometime some one knows it in each one,
sometime some one will know it in every one that one is ever
knowing.</p>

<p>Sometime there will be a history of all young living, feeling,
talking, thinking, being. Some have their real being in young
living, some do not have it then in them. Later there will be a
history of all of them.</p>

<p>One little boy does something to another little boy who does not
like it, he shows no sign of reacting to it the little boy who does
not like it. He seems not to know and then not to remember to be
angry with it, his reaction is so slow to it. Then he hits out and
often the first little boy is surprised at it. This often happens
when one little boy does something to another little boy who does
not like it. This is the way many little boys do it and they are of
many kinds the little boys who do this when some other little boy,
some little girl, some one does something and they do not like it.
This is then the way many little boys do it, this is the way that
some little girls do it. One little girl, one little boy, some one,
many do something to a little girl who does not like it, she shows
just then no sign of reacting to it, the little girl who does not
like it. She is not angry, she seems not to remember then to be
angry, her reaction is not there then to it. Then she does
something violent to show it and often then the one that did
something to that little girl is surprised at it, that one then has
forgotten all about it. This very often happens when a little girl,
when a little boy, when some one does something to a little girl
who does not like it.</p>

<p>This is then the way many little boys and little girls do
something when some one does something and they do not like it.
They are of many kinds the little boys and little girls who do
something in this way when some one has done something and they
have not liked it. Some women and some men do this way in their
later living, many little boys and many little girls do this way
when they are very little ones and then later they change, it
changes in them the way to do it, the way to act to any one who
does something and they do not like it. Some have their real being
in young living, some do not have it then in them. Now there will
be a description of some who have and some who have not their real
being in young living.</p>

<p>There are many then little boys and little girls who have the
way of acting I have been just describing when some one does
something to them and these then do not like this thing that one
has been doing, has done to them.</p>

<p>As I was saying some one does something to some little one who
does not like it, the little one then shows no sign of reacting to
this thing, the little one that does not like it. The little one
shows then no feeling, the little one then is not remembering, the
little one then does some violent thing to the one that has done
the thing the little one was not liking. The other one then has
forgotten and is surprised at the violent action of the little one.
This often happens when one little one, when some one, does
something to a little one and that little one does not like that
thing.</p>

<p>As I was saying this is often happening. As I was saying there
are many little ones who have this way of acting when any one has
done something they have not been liking.</p>

<p>As I was saying there are many kinds of little ones who have
this kind of way of acting when some one had done something they
were not then liking. This is then a very common way of acting.
There are then many little ones who have this way of acting when
some one has done something they were not liking.</p>

<p>So then there are many kinds who can have this way of acting
when they are little ones, many kinds of men and women.</p>

<p>As I was saying some have their real being in young living, some
do not have it then in them. As I was saying in some the nature in
them is clearer when they are very young, in some when they are
young, in some when they are not so young, in some when they are
older or ending. Always in each one it is there and repeating.</p>

<p>As I was saying this way of acting that I have been just
describing can be in various kinds of men and women when they are
little ones, when they are in beginning. There are very many little
ones that have such a way of acting when some one has been doing
something they have not been liking. In some it is from the being
in them, in some it is from being being in beginning then in them.
Some have their real being showing in young living, some do not
have it showing very clearly in them then. Always in each one it is
then there repeating. Always in every one sometime it is clear to
some one.</p>

<p>There are then many kinds of men and women who have the kind of
way of acting I have been just describing, when they are little
ones. Some of such of them have attacking being in them as bottom
being in them, some of such of them have resisting being in them as
their natural way of fighting. This is not very clear then from the
action in them when some one has done something they have not been
liking. There must be always a description of every way some one
can think of men and women, in their beginning, in their middle
living, in their ending. There must be always an expression of
every way some one can feel kinds in men and women in their
beginning, in their middle living, in their ending. Every one has
their own way of seeing every one they come to know in their
living. Always then all this makes a completed history of every
one.</p>

<p>Every one then has their own way of seeing every one, every one
has some that are more complicated to them than other ones. To some
every one is or is not a man or woman, in their beginning, in their
middle living, in their ending, like every other one. Some say of
some one they are seeing, he is like every other one, some have a
very different feeling seeing this one, every one has some way of
making kinds in men and women, every one finds some one some time
confusing, not easy to be certain of the kind that one is then,
mostly every one sometime comes to a decision about each one, some
come very nearly to never deciding about some one, some find it
harder to decide about children what kind of being they have in
them, some about men, some about women, some about many, some about
almost every one, some about almost no one.</p>

<p>There are then many ways of feeling, of thinking men and women
in their beginning, in their middle living, in their ending. Some
are very confusing to some, others very confusing to others, some
because of their being, some because of their training, some
because of their ambition, some because of the activity some
because of the quietness in them, some because of the nature in
them being in beginning, some because of the nature in them being
complete in them, some because of the nature in them being coming
to an ending.</p>

<p>Each one sometime is a whole one, in them. Each one sometime is
a whole one, to some one, to themselves inside them, to some one
knowing them, sometime in their living. This coming together of
them to be one inside them, in some comes to be in them in the
beginning of their living, in some in the middle of their living,
in some at the ending of their living, they come together inside
them to be a whole one in them, sometime, mostly every one. Some
come together to be one in them in different kinds of ways in
different times in living, some seem to come together and are not
really together then, some really come together as one and come
together really sometime as another whole one inside them, mostly
when some one has come together to some one it makes that one more
or less interesting than that one was before to the one knowing
that one. To some then the one that has come together to be a whole
by reason of having come together is then no longer interesting,
the mystery of that one is then ended to the one knowing that one
as a whole one, this is not very uncommon.</p>

<p>Some are so uncertain in their kind of them, the kind that have
the being that is them not very strongly in them, or else very
thinly spread out in them, or rather vacant in them, or very mixed
up in them, there are many that almost never really are a whole one
inside them or are a whole one that is almost without form and
substance in them and these then when one knows this of them, these
who then never come really to be a whole one to any one, to
themselves inside them, these then have not any interest to any
one, as not being a whole one in them. Mostly those having it as
possible to be really a whole one are interesting until they come
together inside them to themselves or to some one, mostly after
that they are to many that know them less interesting; many after
that coming together are more interesting to those that knew them,
mostly all of them those becoming then more, those becoming then
less interesting, in short mostly all men and women coming to be a
whole one inside them and to those that know them are more simply
repeating themselves to every one. Some as I was saying are more
whole ones in them when they are little ones some when they are
young ones, when they are beginning their living, than they are any
other time in their living. Some and many men and women are of this
kind of them are more entirely whole ones in them and to every one
in their middle living. Some in the ending of their being are
really whole ones to themselves and to others for the first time in
their living.<br>

<h2>5.</h2>

<p>This coming together in them to be a whole one is a strange
thing in men and women. Sometimes some one is very interesting to
some one, very, very interesting to some one and then that one
comes together to be a whole one and then that one is not any more,
at all, interesting to the one knowing that one, that one then is
shrunken by being a whole one, some have not that happen to them by
being a whole one, some are richer then, all are solider then to
those knowing them when they come together inside them. It is very
strange this coming together to be a whole one. As I was saying
some come together as different whole ones in different times in
their living, some seem to come together inside them but this is
not real in them, some by their thinking, by their living come to
come together as a richer whole one than could have been expected
from them, often there is some little thing in some one those
knowing that one are hardly noticing and that keeps that one from
coming together until that one in his being has come to be richer
than any one knowing that one, than that one ever expected to be in
his being, sometimes some one has something in them that seems not
important being in them and that keeps them open to growing and
that one comes together then later as a richer whole one than any
one knowing that one thought ever to find that one, and then there
are very many of them that lose rich being with losing their
younger living, there are many that lose it with losing a certain
kind of stimulation, there are many that have a covering of
passion, of emotion, of quick or slow reaction to everything, that
covers them, and sometime to some one they come together to be a
whole one without that covering, sometimes sometime to every one,
inside them they come together to be a whole one without any one
then feeling the covering on them which is not lively then in its
active being and such a one may then be very disappointing, such a
one is a dry whole one when every one knowing that one felt that
one a rich whole until that one came together as a dry whole one.
And so on and so on, the ways of coming together are many and
interesting, more and more to every one, every one sometimes is a
whole mostly every one sometime comes together in them as a whole
one. Some as I was saying almost never come together in them as a
whole one, some of such a kind of them are then not any longer
interesting when it is almost certain of them that they will not
come together in them ever to be a whole one inside them, some of
such of them keep on being tantalising because they come so nearly
again and again to be whole ones inside them.</p>

<p>This then of coming to be whole ones sometimes in them which is
sometime in mostly all men and women, this is very interesting.
Some as I was saying never come really to be a whole one inside
them not at any time in their living not in their beginning, not in
their middle living, not in their ending. These are of many kinds,
some have it that they never come to be a whole one in them because
they are made of little lumps of one kind of being held together or
separated from each other, as one comes to feel it in them, the
lumps in them from each other by other kind of being in them,
sometimes by other kind of being in them that is almost the
complete opposite of the lumps in them, some because, the lumps are
melting always into the surrounding being that keeps the lumps from
touching, in some because the kind of being in them is spread out
so thin in them, that everything they have learned, that they like
to be in living, all reaction to everything interesting, in them,
has really nothing to do in them with the thin spread being in
them. There are other ones who have many kinds of being in them and
none ever really dominating, and there are many kinds of ways of
being so that at no time really such a one is a whole one in them
but really mostly every one sometime comes together in them to be a
whole one, in some part of their living, sometimes earlier in their
living in loving or in working and then later in their living in
natural development of themselves settling in them. There are many
ways of disguising the whole being in each one, some have a
stronger disguise in their beginning than in their middle living or
in their ending. Soon now there will be some discussing of the
disguising of whole being in young living.</p>

<p>Some as I was saying never come to be whole ones inside them.
Some are always whole ones though the being in them is all a mushy
mass with a skin to hold them in and so make one. Such a one is a
whole one and of such a one I am now beginning a description.</p>

<p>These others I have been describing that have it in them to be
made some of lumps of one kind of being held together by other kind
of being in them, some where all the kinds of being are mingling in
them, some where there are little lumps of being and none of them
connected with the other lumps that are part of them, and all the
other kinds of them that never have it in them to be a whole one
inside them not at any time in their living, though they may be
active enough in living, these then all of them are very different
from the one I am now beginning describing.</p>

<p>This one, the one I am now beginning describing was of the
independent dependent kind of them, this one was of that kind of
them, the independent dependent kind of them, the mass that in the
different kinds of them was worked into different concentrations to
make them. This one then that I am now describing, and always there
are many existing like this one, this one then was a whole one; and
all those having independent dependent being have the kind of
material being that is the whole of this one.</p>

<p>Sometime there will be a description of a complete
undifferentiated one that is of the dependent independent kind of
them. Now there will be a little description of this one a
completely undifferentiated independent dependent one, and then
there will be a description of how Martha Hersland was made like
this one only more concentrated in her being and then there will be
the history of the beginning of being in Martha Hersland.</p>

<p>This one then, this one that is a whole one, a mushy mass of
independent dependent being with a skin holding it together from
flowing away from this one, holding it together to make of this a
whole one, this one then is a real one, and always there are many
living just like this one in their being, though each one of them
is a whole one, separate and yet very resembling the one to the
other one, and each one is an individual one to themselves and each
one is a whole one.</p>

<p>This one then is a whole one, is all of one kind of one and all
of it in this one, the being in this one is of the same consistency
and concentration. This one is of the independent dependent kind of
being. This one always is and was and will be a whole one, always
in this one's beginning, in this one's middle living, in this one's
ending, always this one was a whole one, the same kind of whole one
from the being a baby to the being a dying and dead one. Always
this one is a whole one and this is now some description of this
one.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see the substance that is independent
dependent beings in so many ways in so many kinds of men and women,
it is interesting to see this substance that has so many kinds of
ways of being in many kinds in men and women, it is interesting to
see it completely fluid in this one, to see all its activities in
this one, sometimes it is an uncomfortable feeling to know it so
well from this one when one is knowing some kinds of men and women
having in them independent dependent being, sometimes it makes one
turn away from seeing the being in some so that one will not know
it too clearly in them that they have in them independent dependent
being and that is the being in the one I am now beginning to be
describing. Independent dependent being is the being in the one I
am now beginning describing. There will not be here now much
description of this one, there will be here now a little
description of this one and how this one was a whole always in all
the living of this one, in the beginning, in the middle living, in
the ending of this one. There will be a very little description now
of this one and then a real beginning of Martha Hersland who is of
the independent dependent kind of them.</p>

<p>This one then was as I was saying always a whole one. This one
was a whole one always, a whole one because there was only one kind
of being in this one always in the same lax condition and with a
skin to separate it from the world around this one. This made of
this one a whole one. This one is very existing to my feeling. This
one is of the independent dependent kind of them. This one was
always a whole one, this one all her living was repeating the whole
being there was in this one and it was all always completely there
to every one, the whole being in this one, to every one who ever
knew this one, always there to every one when this one was a baby
or a little one, or a young girl or a young woman, or a woman in
her middle living, or in her ending. There are always very very
many women, very many men like this one, always existing. This one
was and is and will be always a real one to every one that ever
knew or knows or will come to know this one. This one is a real one
in herself and to every one. This one is of the independent
dependent kind of them. This one all her living was always a
complete one and every one always knew the whole being of this one.
This is now some description of this one.</p>

<p>This one is then of the independent dependent kind of them, this
one is all independent dependent being in solution. Of this one now
I will give a very little description.</p>

<p>This one is all independent dependent being in solution, this is
now a little description of this one, one of the independent
dependent kind of them, one always all her living always a whole
one, one being independent dependent being in solution, one being
all her living always of the same concentration of being, the same
whole one, when this one was a baby, a young one, an older one and
then an old one and then dying and then no longer one and always
then there are others like this one. Always there are many many
millions of every kind of men and women and this makes many stories
very much realler, there being so many always of the same kind of
them. It makes it realler then when in a story there are twelve
women, all alike, and one hundred men, all alike, and a man and a
woman completely resembling the one to the other one of them and
always then it makes circuses, more interesting for always then
each one doing something in a circus is a kind of men or women and
each one is completed, concentrated at the moment each one has the
music stopped and does the hard thing one has been preparing all
his life and that makes a living for that one, makes the living of
that one; this is then very interesting and always circuses more
and more are interesting to any one interested in kinds in men and
women and now to begin again with this one the one that was of the
independent dependent kind of them, that was all independent
dependent being in a flabby state of being, that was always a whole
one for this one had a skin that held this one from flowing over
everything and that made this one a whole one, that made this one
an individual one as every one is who ever is a man or woman and so
then this one is a real one and now there will be of this one here
now a very little description.</p>

<p>This one was then once a very little one, a baby and then a
little one and then a young girl and then a woman and then older
and then later there was an ending to her and that was the history
of this one. This one always was the same one to herself and to
every one when she was a very little one, a baby, and then a little
one and then a bigger one and then a very considerably bigger one
and then a sick one and then no longer one.</p>

<p>This one was always the same whole one to herself and to every
one when she was a very little one, then when she was a little one,
when she was then a bigger, when she was a very considerably bigger
one and then when she was just continuing and then when she was
ending and dying. This one always then was the same one, sometimes
she was bigger than at other times, sometimes she was fatter,
sometimes she was sicker, sometimes she had children around her,
always she was held together to be one, to be a whole one by the
skin of her, always she was of the independent dependent kind of
them, always this was all the history of her.</p>

<p>In some the nature in them is clearer when they are very young,
in some when they are young, in some when they are not so young, in
some when they are getting older, in some when they are old ones.
This one was always to every one the same one. This one always was
the same one. When this one was a little one, a very little one, an
older one, a very old one, always this one was the same one, always
this one was all independent dependent being in solution. Knowing
this one completely is then a very important thing, knowing this
one completely will make it easier to know all of the men and women
having in them independent dependent being, all the kinds there are
of independent dependent kinds in men and women.</p>

<p>This one then was in the beginning a little baby and then a
little girl and then a woman and always every one knew all the
being in this one, the being that was never changing in
concentration or in action. This one was a flabby mass of
independent dependent being held together by the skin surrounding
for so this one had individual being. This one then was one that
had this meaning, the being all independent dependent being in
possibility of formation. This one then was a very important one,
there are always many millions of them living and each one of them
is held together as a whole one by the skin of each one. This one
then is independent being in solution.</p>

<p>As I was saying those having independent dependent being have
attacking as their way of fighting, loving, winning. Resisting in
such of them as I was saying is mostly in them stupid being. This
is the natural being in them. This one was so slow always in her
attacking that it mostly was resisting in her as it mostly, the
attacking being in this one, just was barely in motion.</p>

<p>This one was of the independent dependent kind of them,
attacking being was so slow in action that it made of this one a
mass that was resisting, that was mostly all stupid being. This one
was as I was saying of the independent dependent kind of them. This
one started somewhere into action, it all would be slowly wobbling
and so make what was attacking being but any one coming against
this one would only be feeling it as a mass to stick in and so
think it as a mass resisting, really this one was of the
independent dependent kind of them, really this one had attacking
as a way of fighting, as a way of loving. This one was a whole one
because this one was held together by a skin, as I was saying. This
one always was a whole one, when this one was a young one, a very
young one, an older one, a very old one. This one was like many
other men and women, this one was like many many other men and
women as having independent dependent being. This one then was like
very many other babies when this one was a baby too, this one was
like many other children when this one was a child, this one was
like many other young men and young women when this one was a young
woman, this one was like many other men and women when this one was
a woman, this one was like many other old men and old women when
this one was an old woman, this one was different from all the
others of them for this one had her own skin and so was separated
from all the others of them that have or had or will have the same
kind of being to make them, they each one of them are different
from all the others of them like them for each one, every one, has
their own skin that cuts them off from all the other ones and so
each one, even of this kind of them, are individual ones, whole
ones to themselves and to everyone; this one was like many very
many men and women, this one was like all of them that have in them
independent dependent being, that have in them anything of
independent dependent being. This one then is interesting, knowing
this one is then an important thing. I know this one very
completely in the whole being of this one. This one is then the
simplest form of independent dependent being. Every one having in
them anything of independent dependent being is connected with this
one then by the being in that one and by the being in this one.
This is then now the beginning of really knowing independent
dependent being in every one ever having in them any of such being.
More and more there will be much description of independent
dependent being. More and more I will know more of independent
dependent being. More and more there will be more understanding in
every one of independent dependent being.</p>

<p>Some have their real being in them in young living, some do not
have it then in them. Now there will be some description of young
living in some.</p>

<p>Some have their real being in them in very young living, some do
not have it then in them. Now there will be a little description of
very young living in one.</p>

<p>This one, and the one I am now beginning describing is Martha
Hersland and this is a little story of the acting in her of her
being in her very young living, this one was a very little one then
and she was running and she was in the street and it was a muddy
one and she had an umbrella that she was dragging and she was
crying. "I will throw the umbrella in the mud," she was saying, she
was very little then, she was just beginning her schooling, "I will
throw the umbrella in the mud," she said and no one was near her
and she was dragging the umbrella and bitterness possessed her, "I
will throw the umbrella in the mud," she was saying and nobody
heard her, the others had run ahead to get home and they had left
her, "I will throw the umbrella in the mud," and there was
desperate anger in her; "I have throwed the umbrella in the mud,"
burst from her, she had thrown the umbrella in the mud and that was
the end of it all in her. She had thrown the umbrella in the mud
and no one heard her as it burst from her, "I have throwed the
umbrella in the mud," it was the end of all that to her.</p>

<p>It is very hard telling from any incident, in any one's living
what kind of being they have in them. Kinds in being is a subject
that is very puzzling. Martha Hersland had independent dependent
being but this that I have just been telling might have been in the
living of a little one having independent dependent being, might
have been in the living of a little one having dependent
independent being, might have been in the living of a little one
having a mixture in its being. This then was in the living of
Martha Hersland when she was a little one but as I was saying it is
very hard to know from anything in any one's living the kind of
being in them. Slowly some one comes to know the being in some one.
Slowly then now every one reading will know all the being in Martha
Hersland. This is then a beginning.</p>

<p>Some have the real being in their living in their young living,
some do not have it then in them. Now there will be some
description of young living in some.</p>

<p>Sometime there will be a history of all young living, feeling,
talking, thinking, being. Some have their real being mostly in
their young living, some do not have it then at all in them. Later
there will be a history of all these, of every one.</p>

<p>There are many ways of making kinds in men and women when they
are in their beginning when they are children. They are then each
one of them like some others, like some other children, they are
each one of them something of themselves then, always somehow a
little, some much very much, themselves inside them, each one, and
each one are like many other ones, many other children. There are
many ways of making kinds in men and women in their beginning,
there are many ways of making kinds in children. In each way of
making kinds of them there is a different system, a different way
of feeling, a different way of thinking them as being resembling
one to others of them. Martha Hersland as I was saying was of the
independent dependent kind of them. Martha knew in her early living
a certain number of children, some I have already been describing,
now there will be more history of some, more history of others of
them. As I was saying Martha was throwing the umbrella in the mud
with angry feeling as she was telling and nobody was hearing. As I
was saying no one knowing this as having been Martha's way of
acting then when she a little one was filled full of angry feeling,
with despairing feeling, with responsible feeling, with frightened
feeling, no one then could be very certain of the kind of being
Martha had in her. Not any one could know then whether Martha was
of the kind of them having attacking as their natural being, the
kind of them having resisting as their natural being. Some have
their real being in young living, some do not have it then in them.
In those having it then strongly in them sometime some one watching
them can know it in them. Mostly it is harder to know it in them
then in their beginning than in their later young living. Always it
is a difficult thing, in some it is almost impossible in their
beginning living to know the being in them, in some it is easy
then. Now there will be a little description of young living in
some. Knowing a map and then seeing the place and knowing then that
the roads actually existing are like the map, to some is always
astonishing and always then very gratifying. To some there is the
same thing in living and to such a one seeing each one they are
knowing as young ones and older ones and very old ones, and seeing
them then as having in them the kind of being that hearing others
talking, and reading what others have written, makes every one know
is the nature of human being knowing this then in every one at each
period in them is to some as I was saying astonishing and then
gratifying, is to some as I was saying knowing a place after
knowing a map of such a place is to some to their feeling an
astonishment and then a gratification. This is then always there
all their living in some, that is to say these ones come to know in
those of them that are of their own generation, not children being,
though in some even that is known to them by hearing and reading,
in other children around them, they being then children, in some of
such of them then there is a self-consciousness then enough to make
them know then even when they are children children being, it comes
to be more strongly in them then when they are young men and women,
it comes to be to them then almost overwhelming as astonishment and
gratification in their middle living to find themselves and those
of their own age around them looking like men and women in their
middle living, acting, living like men and women in their middle
living, this is then to them very astonishing, to some it is
gratifying, to some of such of them it is terrifying, they are
then, they themselves and others around them as they remember their
fathers and their mothers when they themselves were children, this
is then as I say to many of such of them who have this in them very
astonishing, to some very gratifying, to some even terrifying, and
there are then all kinds of feeling in between about this
thing.</p>

<p>This then, this realising is strongest in men and women of those
around them of their own age in living when they themselves are
having in them then that living that is to them the thing they have
known like a map of living and then they know it in those around
them of their own time of living and in themselves then and to many
very many it is then astonishing, to some then gratifying, to some
then almost terrifying, to some it is overwhelming then to know it
really then inside really completely then inside them, that all
living is always repeating, that they are like every one else who
has or ever has had or ever will have in them middle living, like
them in the way they are then in their looks, in their troubles
with their health or happiness or working or children. It is to
many then overwhelming that they know then that everything they
have been hearing or reading about living is true of them, that
they are in their middle living, that all those they are knowing of
about the same age as they are themselves then are then also in
that middle living that they have known always from reading, from
seeing, from hearing and that is to many very astonishing, to some
who have it in them to love repeating in living very gratifying, to
some who are beginning to be a little weary then very satisfying,
to many then almost or completely terrifying. This is then there,
the understanding of being in middle living in such a one, and then
there is in such a one an understanding of men and women they are
remembering who were when they knew them in middle living, there is
then in such of them a new realisation of every one, for every one
must have sometime in them middle living. There are then many who
have sometime in them the feeling I have been describing with a map
and seeing the place and knowing then the roads are really existing
like the maps of them. This is to very many always each time
astonishing.</p>

<p>They are some who have then a feeling of knowing other children,
knowing themselves, they themselves being then children, as being
like the children they know from reading from hearing people
talking about being in children. Mostly every one does not know it
in this way, the being in children, many know it only from
remembering themselves and others who were around them then, from
knowing children, from knowing sometime every one, from having
children of their own or from other ones around them having them,
from knowing some in their later living whom they remembered as
children but did not realise then the being in them. Mostly every
one a little sometime in their living realise themselves and others
as being like children, like men, like women they have come to know
in reading or from hearing about them.</p>

<p>There is then the knowing kinds in men and women from the
character in them, the nature in them, the mind, the passion, the
way of winning, working, loving, dying, having religion in them,
the way of giving and the way of receiving, and the way of taking,
and the way of accepting, and the way of escaping in them; there
are many ways of knowing kinds in men and women from habits of
training, of grammar, of playing and washing and working in them,
and doing nothing; there are then many very many ways of knowing
kinds in men and women, from prettyness and ugliness in them, from
ways of dressing, from all the ways they have of being and then
there are ways of knowing men and women as being in their
beginning, as babies and children, and then being young grown men
and women, and then men and women in their middle living, and then
men and women in their ending. Some find it harder to decide about
children what kind of being they have in them, than about men and
women as young men and women, than men and women as men and women
in their middle living, as men and women in their ending. Some find
it harder to know what kind of being they have in them, the women
than the men, some find it harder to know what kind of being they
have in them the men than the women. Some find it harder to know
the being men and women have in them when they are young men and
women than at any other time in their living, some find it harder
with men and women in their middle living then when the disposition
in them is changing to middle living disposition, in many to
impatient irritation, some find it harder to know real being in men
and women in their ending then when loving, feeling, religion, have
queer ways of showing in them, always then some are very confusing
sometime to some, mostly every one has some way of making kinds in
men and women, mostly every one finds some one sometimes confusing,
mostly every one sometime finds some one very confusing not easy
then to be certain of the kind of being one has in her or in him,
mostly every one comes to a decision sometime about the kind of
being in each one, some come very nearly to never deciding about
some one, some as I was saying find it harder about children what
being they have in them, about men and women when they are
beginning than at any other time in their living.</p>

<p>Some have their real being in them in young living, some do not
have it then in them. Now there will be some description of young
living in some.</p>

<p>Now there will be some description of young living, feeling,
talking, thinking being. Some have their real being in young
living, some do not have it then in them. All have their real being
in their young living to some, not any one has their real being in
young living to some. To begin then with a little description of
many ways of feeling being in young living, of feeling, thinking,
the being, understanding the being of men and women when they are
in their beginning, when they are babies, when they are children,
when they are growing into being young men and young women. To
begin then again with a little description of feeling, thinking
kinds in babies and in children, in understanding the being and
kinds in being in men and women when they are in their beginning,
when they are babies, when they are children.</p>

<p>Some then are understanding kinds in children always. Some then
have more feeling for kinds in children for being in children than
for being in men and women in grown up men and women. Some find
being in children more confusing for to them the being in children
is the being in men and women in beginning and so to them children
are confusing as being natures in beginning. Children are confusing
and deceiving to many. These then are to some very difficult to
knowing, the being in children is to some a very difficult thing to
be understanding. The being in children is very confusing to any
one wanting to understand being in men and women. The being in
children is then often very confusing, this is because being in
beginning the nature in them is then almost hidden, or disguised,
or uncertain, or changing, or too loudly in them. Children are then
often very confusing for they are often all of them doing the same
thing and the nature in them does not affect them, they have many
of them then not their own way of eating, drinking, playing,
laughing, crying, having angry feeling, kicking, screaming, loving,
deceiving, some have then their own individual way of doing but
mostly in children it is a general kind of action a general kind of
way of acting when any one does anything to them and they are not
liking this thing some one has been doing to them. Always it is
hard to know the real being in any one from knowing things any one
has been doing, with children it is even more confusing, the same
kind of acting is done by children that have every different kind
of nature in them when they are happy, when they are playing, when
they are cheating, when they have angry or injured feeling. Mostly
then the being in children, the individual being in each one is
very difficult for any one even living with them to be knowing, it
is often almost hidden, or disguised, or uncertain, or changing, or
too loudly in them, and so they have not then really in them
individual being. Slowly then they come to have in them more and
more their individual being. Slowly more and more individual being
comes out of them as more and more they are themselves inside them.
It is very hard to know of any one the being in them from one or
two things they have been doing that some one is telling about
them, from many things even that they have been doing and that one
knows of them. Knowing real being in men and women is a very slow
proceeding and always more and more this is very certain.</p>

<p>As I was saying it is almost harder to know it in children and
young men and women the being in them than in older men and women.
Not every one thinks that this is certain. As I was saying many
many kinds of little boys that in their later living have very
different ways of reacting when some one has done something and
they do not like the thing some one has been doing, many many men
who have very different ways of acting when some one has done
something they are not liking, very different natures in them, when
they were little boys and some little boy, some one did something
they were not liking, they showed no signs of reacting to it then
and then later they hit out and often the little boy the some one
who had done the thing to them they were not liking had forgotten,
so long was the little boy who was not liking the thing the other
one did to him in responding. This is true also of women, many
kinds of women with very different kinds of natures in them, when
they were little girls and some one did something to them they were
not liking showed at first no reaction and then they showed angry
feeling when every one had forgotten the thing the little girl had
not been liking. In some men, in some women, this shows real nature
in them, in some it is just that nature is in them in beginning,
and so children are very confusing to the understanding.</p>

<p>In some the nature in them is clearer when they are very young,
in some when they are young, in some when they are not so young, in
some when they are old ones. Always in each one it is there and
repeating, sometime some one knows it in each one.</p>

<p>As I was saying some have more feeling for kinds in men and
women when men and women are in beginning, some have more feeling
for kinds in men and women when men and women are babies than in
any other time in their living, some have more feeling for kinds in
men and women when men and women are children than at any other
time in their existing. As I was saying, to some, being in children
is very confusing because the nature in them is in its
beginning.</p>

<p>As I was saying it is very hard telling from knowing something
some one did sometime, the nature in them. As I was saying it is
very difficult to know the nature in a man or in a woman from
knowing even quite a number of things they are doing; it is even
harder to know the nature in children from the action in them as I
have been just saying, that is true of many children, not of all of
them by any means and that must never be forgotten.</p>

<p>As I was saying Martha Hersland when she was a little one a very
little one and the others were running ahead and she had the
umbrella for one of them and she was struggling to catch up with
the rest of them and they were disappearing and she was being
filled fuller always with angry feeling and resentment and
desperation and she was crying out, "I will throw the umbrella in
the mud," and nobody was hearing and she was repeating again and
again and then in a moment of triumphing she did throw the umbrella
in the mud and then she went on crying and saying, "I did throw the
umbrella in the mud," this is a description of an action that many
very different kinds of children could have been doing when they
were left behind struggling, Martha Hersland did this and she was a
little girl then and slowly now there will come to be a complete
description of the nature in her that this I have been just
describing does not now help very much to be understanding.</p>

<p>Now there will be some description of Martha Hersland in her
young living and the children she knew when she was beginning
living.</p>

<p>I was telling of the living of the Hersland family in Gossols on
a ten acre place and of people living in small houses near them and
it was then that Martha Hersland was a child and was knowing
children. She knew some children at the public school near them
where she and her brothers had their American education, some
children that were living then in the small houses near the ten
acre place where the Hersland family were living then as I was
telling and some other children who knew these children. She knew
some children at the public school. Some children were living near
them in the small houses as I was telling and she knew them and
knew some other children who knew these children. And then she knew
some children who sometimes came to see them, the Hersland
children, who were the kind of children she naturally should have
been knowing, from the kind of people Mr. and Mrs. Hersland should
naturally be knowing, but these children were never important in
her living. Mostly then she was knowing children living near her,
and children knowing these children. Mostly then, Martha, and as I
was saying this was mostly true of all three of them of all three
of the Hersland children, Martha when she was in the beginning of
her living was more of them, the children, the people living in the
small houses near them and the friends of these people, of these
children, than she was of her family living, of her mother's and
father's country house living. She was then not at all of the
living that would naturally have been her kind of living, of
well-to-do living. She was then, as a child, as a young girl,
almost until she was a young woman of the being of those living in
small houses near them.</p>

<p>Much description of the being in the children living in the
small houses near the ten acre place where the Herslands were
living and of children living in other parts of Gossols and knowing
these children will be in the description of the beginning being of
the youngest of the three Hersland children, in the history of
David Hersland. Now in the history of the beginning of the being of
Martha the oldest of the three Hersland children there will be more
a description of how other children felt the being in her, how
every one felt the being in her and so there will be a description
of her as every one who knew her felt her, now, in her beginning,
and then, later in her living.</p>

<p>There will then be much description of the being in the children
living in the small houses near them and of many other children in
the history of the beginning of the youngest of the Hersland
children who was really more of them, these children, than his
brother or his sister ever had been. Now this is a description of
the beginning of the being in the eldest of the Hersland children,
in Martha Hersland and there will be now much description of how
every one ever knowing Martha felt the being in her, other children
knowing her, her governesses and the servants and her brothers and
her teachers and her mother and her father and later other girls
and boys and later her lover and later her husband and then very
many who then knew her and then again her brothers and her father,
and again then everybody who then and on from then to her ending
knew her.</p>

<p>All three of the Hersland children as I was saying were when
they were children very much of the living of the people living in
small houses near them. The youngest of the three Hersland children
David Hersland was so entirely of them when he was in his
beginning, of them, of the children at school with him, of children
knowing these children and the children living in the small houses
near the Hersland family then, was so entirely of the being of all
these children that in the description of the being in him there
will be very much description of the being in many of them. In the
child being of the second Hersland child the elder son, Alfred
Hersland there was also a little of this that he was very much of
the living of the people around him but it was not in him so
completely inside him as it was in the being of the younger son
David Hersland, the youngest of the three Hersland children. Then
Alfred Hersland was very much sooner through with having it in him
the living of the people around him as part of the being in him
than either his younger brother or his older sister. He was then
really less of them the poor people around him than either of the
other two Hersland children but nevertheless in his young living in
his playing and in his being interested then, he too was very much
of them the poor people near them, though it was never really very
deep in him and it was very soon all ended for him. He was then,
Alfred Hersland in a sense in his being less really of the being of
the people living in small houses near him, more of the people it
was natural for him to know in his living though he was not of them
at all in his beginning than his brother or his sister and this
will come out very clearly in the history of him that will be
written after the history of Martha has reached its completion. It
will be interesting then to know it in each one of the Hersland
children just how they were of the living of the, for them, poor
people near them.</p>

<p>As I was saying David, the youngest of them was of the living of
the people living in the small houses near them, of their living,
of their children's living, David had really inside him the living
and the being of the people living in the small houses and of the
people that knew these people and the children that knew these
children and so they, all of them the being in them the natures of
many of them will come to have much description of them being given
in the very long history of David Hersland that will be written
after there has been written some descriptions of Martha Hersland
and then of Alfred Hersland. So then sometime there will be much
description of the nature of many of the men, women and children,
of the families the Herslands knew in their living in the ten acre
place in a part of Gossols where no rich people were living, where
there were not living any who would naturally have been friends
then of the Hersland children if the Hersland family had been
living the well to do living that was really natural for them.
There will then in the history of young David Hersland which will
be a very long one there will be much description of many people
who lived near them the Hersland family then. As I was saying
Alfred Hersland was very much less of them the people then living
around him than his younger brother David than in a sense the
daughter of the Hersland family, the eldest of them of the
children, Martha. Alfred was of them in playing in quarrelling, in
taking excursions for hunting and other things and in bicycling and
in many ways, then, and when he was beginning to be somewhere near
being a young man. This will all be told in the history of him
which will be begun after there has been written a little
description of the whole being and all the living of his elder
sister Martha which is now what is here in beginning. So then in
the history of David Hersland there will be much description of the
being and the nature of the people near the Hersland family when
Martha, Alfred and David were children and until they were young
men and women, in the history of Alfred Hersland there will be
descriptions of his being with them of Alfred's being with the
people around the Hersland family then and what he did with them in
the way of playing, quarrelling and living. Martha Hersland was
more of the living and the being of the people around them then
than Alfred ever was really inside him but not so much of them as
David was of them and now in the history of Martha Hersland there
will be a description of them only in the sense of what way they,
the people knowing the Hersland family then, knew her and felt her.
This is now clear then, by and by there will be much description of
the being and the character in many of these people, families, men,
women and children that the Hersland children knew when they were
children and on from them until they were almost young men and
women, in the long history of David Hersland that will be written
after there has been written some of the history of Martha Hersland
and of Alfred Hersland the two elder Hersland children. There will
then be written also the meaning of these men and women to Mr. and
Mrs. David Hersland the father and the mother of the three Hersland
children. So then all that will happen, all that will be written
after there is written some description of living and the being of
the two elder Hersland children. First then now there will be
written some description of Martha Hersland in her beginning. After
there has been written something of the history of her living some
description of her being, there will be written a history of her
brother Alfred up to the time of his marrying Julia Dehning. After
that will be written the whole long history of the youngest of the
three children David Hersland and all through there will be written
some history of the father and mother and of all the governesses
and servants living in the house with the Hersland family. So then
to begin again. In the history of young David Hersland there will
be written much description of the character and living of every
one the Hersland family ever came to know in all the time they were
living in the ten acre place in that part of Gossols where no other
rich people were living. In the history of Alfred Hersland there
will be much description of the things Alfred did with and to them,
all of them whom the Hersland family came to know then. Now in the
history of Martha Hersland there will be much description of how
every one knowing the Hersland family then came to feel and know
her and them, what every one knowing them felt in her and in the
Hersland living, what every one knowing them and knowing her felt
about her, knew about her, felt about them, knew about them.</p>

<p>There are many ways of disguising the whole being that is each
one, some have a stronger disguising of them in their beginning
living, stronger then than in their middle living, or in their
ending. In many this is now true of them. Soon now there will be
some discussing of the disguising of whole being in young living.
Now there will be some description of how every one who knew Martha
Hersland knew and felt the being and the living she had in her, how
her father felt her, how her mother felt her, how the servants felt
her, each one of them, how each one of the governesses knew and
felt her, in short how every one who knew her then, men women and
children who knew her then, knew her then, felt her then. To begin
then.</p>

<p>As I was saying it is very hard to know the being in some one
from some few things they have been doing, it is hard knowing any
one but sometime each one knowing any one has some feeling of that
one.</p>

<p>There are many ways of disguising the whole being, in each one.
Some have a stronger disguise in their beginning than in their
middle living or in their ending. Some have a stronger disguise in
their middle living than in their beginning living or when they are
ending living. Some have a stronger disguise when they are ending
living than at any other time in their living. Some do not have at
any time in their living more disguising of the real being in them
than at any other time in their living. Martha Hersland was one of
such of them. This is now the way every one knowing Martha Hersland
felt the being in her.</p>

<p>Martha Hersland was of the independent dependent kind in men and
women. The one I was describing as being independent dependent
being as in fluid condition and held together to be one by the skin
surrounding that one was of the same kind of being then as that in
Martha Hersland, in Martha the being was in a little more
concentrated condition but the proportion of attacking and
obstinate resisting and quickness and hesitation and ways of being
always in every part of living a whole one was the same in Martha
Hersland as in the one I was describing as being independent
dependent being in completely fluid condition and being a whole one
only, and always being one, by having a skin to hold it in and to
separate it so from every one and make it so an individual one.
Martha then was of the independent dependent kind in men and women,
Martha had this being then in more concentration in a more solid
condition than the one I was earlier describing. It is a little
true now to me of Martha and a little true to me of many men and
women having independent dependent being in them that the being in
them being like the one I was describing, the one having all
independent dependent being in solution in a fluid condition, and
my knowing independent dependent being so well in that one and that
one being such a fluid whole one, gives to me seeing them an
uncomfortable feeling to know it so well from this one I was
describing, the being in them, the activities in them, in some
having independent dependent being; sometimes it makes me a little
turn away from seeing the being in some having in them independent
dependent being so that I will not know it too clearly in them the
being that they have in them, all the meaning of the being in them
and that is a little now the way I am feeling in looking at the
being in Martha Hersland and now all the same I am beginning
completely to realise all the meaning there is in the being there
is in her and always now I will look straight on at her. I will
know all the being in her. Martha was of the independent dependent
kind of them as I was saying, she was as I was saying like the one
I was describing that was independent dependent being in completely
fluid condition and always was a whole one in the beginning of the
being there was in that one in the middle of the living of that
one, in the ending of the living of that one. Martha then was like
that one in the relation of things in her being, she was more
concentrated more solid than that one, it was not only the skin
that kept her apart from other ones, there was actual individual
being always in Martha but Martha was a whole one, in her
beginning, in her middle living, in her ending, she was all through
her of the same concentration, of the same nature, always it was
the same being in her, that in her in her beginning, in her being a
baby, a little one, a little bigger one, and so on. Always Martha
like the other one I was describing was a whole one. This is now
some description of what each one who knew her felt in her, this is
now some descriptions of the nature in her, of the living that was
in her. When she was a very little one sometimes she wanted not to
be existing. This is a very common thing in every one in the
beginning of their living. This is a very common thing in mostly
every one in the beginning of their living. Many want then not any
longer to be existing, mostly then when they are very little ones
they are never thinking I wish I had never come into existing, they
have not then any such a feeling, they often say then I wish I had
died when I was a little baby and had not any feeling, I would not
then have to be always suffering, I would not then now have to
think of being frightened by dying, I wish I had been dead when I
was a very little one and was not knowing anything. It is very
interesting the way anybody feels about dying, about not existing,
about everything, about every one. Always more and more this is
very interesting.</p>

<p>There are ways then that those having in them independent
dependent being feel about living, feel about dying, feel about
never having been, if they have any of such a kind of feeling in
them, that is common to all of them as being different from the way
those having in them dependent independent being have of
feeling.</p>

<p>More and more there will be understanding of these different
ways of feeling their own being, feeling anybody else's being,
feeling the ending of themselves and the ending of any one, feel
their not existing, that makes one kind in men and women, makes
that kind different from other kinds of them. There will then be a
very little always being made that slowly will make a great deal of
description of the feelings in each kind in men and women about
everything.</p>

<p>As I was saying Martha was of the independent dependent kind of
them. As I was saying it is hard to know the kind of being in any
one from just a description of some thoughts, some feelings, some
actions in them for it is in their feeling of themselves inside
them that the kind of being in them shows in them and that comes
out of them slowly in their living, that comes out of them always
as repeating, this is very very difficult to make any one
understand from a description of them. This is now what I am always
trying. I know much of all this and sometime sometimes I can make
some one else know it by my explaining, I am never very certain but
always there is again and again for me a beginning of this
trying.</p>

<p>As I was saying many little ones have a feeling about not
wanting any more to be living, some want to have been dead when
they were little babies and not knowing anything, some want to be
dead then so that every one will miss them, some want to prove
themselves all noble by dying, some are just tired of struggling
when they are little ones, there are such ones, and some of such of
them have independent dependent being that does not succeed then in
winning fighting by attacking. Martha was a little such a one, and
more and more this will show in all her living. Always there was in
her much attacking, mostly there was in her nervous feeling, mostly
there was in her not much winning, early then she had at moments
tired feeling. Never did she know that really she was failing in
attacking, always she had in her nervous feeling showing that she
had been failing to every one, it was not excitement or weakness or
yielding or escaping or blustering as it is in some, some who have
independent dependent being and are failing in attacking, in some
who have dependent independent being and yet always are attacking
though attacking is not for them the way of winning fighting, but
in Martha Hersland all of her being was independent dependent
being, attacking was her way of winning fighting, mostly she was
never winning mostly she did not really know this in her, she had
nervous feeling in her that showed the failure in the fighting she
was doing, all this will be clearer when there will have been
completely given the feeling every one who ever came to know her at
any time in her living had about her.</p>

<p>Always Martha was a whole one, she had only this one kind of
being. She always was a whole one, all her living she was repeating
the whole being, the kind of being that was the whole being of her,
mostly all her living she was a whole one, to herself, to every
one. There was in her always one kind of independent dependent
being as I was saying and it was mostly all always completely there
to every one, the whole being in her to every one who ever knew
her, always there then to every one, when she was a baby or a
little one, or a young girl or a young woman, or a woman in her
middle living, or in her ending. Mostly then always she really was
a whole one. Mostly then always every one who knew her had about
her such a feeling. This will come clearer in the history of
her.</p>

<p>She was as I was saying of one kind of independent dependent
being and all her living there was about the same concentration to
her, the same relation of attacking and succeeding and failing and
nervous feeling and stupid being and understanding and tired
feeling in her. Martha was then once a very little one, a baby, and
then a little one and then a young girl and then a woman and then
she was older and then later there was an ending to her and always
all through this living in her she was the same whole one inside
her and to every one who knew her.</p>

<p>In some the nature in them is clearer when they are very young,
in some when they are young, in some when they are not so young, in
some when they are getting older, in some when they are old ones.
Martha was mostly always to every one who knew her the same whole
one, when she was a little one, a very little one, an older one, a
very old one, mostly always then she was to every one about the
same kind of a whole one. She was of one kind of that kind of them
and mostly all her living there was the same concentration of the
being that was her, the same proportion of one thing to the other
things active in her.</p>

<p>As I was saying those having in them independent dependent being
have in them attacking as their natural way of winning fighting, as
their natural way of winning in loving. As I was saying those
having in them dependent independent being have in them resisting
as their natural way of winning fighting, have resisting as their
natural way of winning in loving. This then is the being in those
having in them independent dependent being, this then is the being
in those having in them dependent independent being. These then are
the two different ways of being in men and women and always this,
one way or the other way of being, always then one way or the other
way of being, independent dependent being or dependent independent
being is in each one, every one who ever was or is or will be
living.</p>

<p>Often it is very confusing for as I was saying sometimes, very
often, one having in her or in him independent dependent being,
that is having attacking as their real way of winning fighting,
winning in loving, such a one seems really to be always resisting.
This then the kind of being in some one is sometimes, is one might
say truly very often, very confusing, for one, having in them
really as being attacking as the way of winning fighting, as the
way of winning loving, always sometimes every minute in their
living to themselves and to every one knowing them seems to be
resisting, seems to be so fighting and winning, so loving and
winning. This is then very confusing to every one knowing that one.
Slowly then the real fighting being, the real loving being in that
one comes to be understood by some one, sometimes not really by any
one, mostly in every one, sometime by some one. This is true then
of very many having in them independent dependent being, that is
those having in them attacking as their real way of winning
fighting, attacking as their real way of winning loving, it is true
in many of them that to themselves mostly, and mostly to every one
ever knowing them, they have in them resisting as their way of
winning fighting, resisting as their way of winning in loving. In
those having in them dependent independent being that is those
having in them resisting as their real way of winning fighting,
resisting as their real way of winning in loving, there are very
many of them who seem to themselves sometimes and mostly always to
every one ever knowing them seem to be always and incessantly
attacking, seem to be always winning by attacking in fighting and
in loving. Sometime it comes out of them that they are not really
winning, more and more perhaps it comes out of them that always
attacking they are never really winning, sometimes sometime some
one will know it of them that attacking is not in such of them the
way of winning fighting, winning loving, in some sometime every one
who knows them knows it sometime of them, that attacking is not in
them the way of winning fighting, the way of winning loving. It is
very confusing for every one realising this description must be
really understanding that failing does not prove it to be true of
some one that attacking is not the real way of winning fighting for
one doing their fighting by attacking. Many having in them
attacking as their natural way of winning fighting fail to succeed
to winning by attacking, fail to succeed in loving by attacking.
They may fail then those having in them such being, they may even
succeed by resisting those having in them attacking as their way of
winning and yet these then are of the kind of them having attacking
as their natural way of winning fighting, as their natural way of
winning loving, are in short of the independent dependent kind of
them. Of those having in them resisting as their natural way of
winning fighting they are often for a long time to every one, to
themselves then and they are bragging of it and they have it in
them to themselves and to every one that they are always succeeding
by attacking, and sometimes they are really never failing, to
themselves and to others who know them and yet always to some one
knowing the whole sum of them the whole completeness of their
living some one can know it in them that attacking is not in them
their real way of winning fighting, of succeeding in being loved
and in loving. So then as I was saying it is very confusing and
sometimes one only knows really the kind of being in some by the
kind of yielding in them, the kind of sensitiveness in them for
there is in each kind of being, in independent dependent being, in
dependent independent being a kind of way of yielding, a kind of
way of being dependent, a kind of way of having sensitiveness in
them that makes that kind of them. There is then in independent
dependent being a kind of way of yielding, of having sensitive
being that is different from the kind of way of yielding of having
sensitive being in dependent independent kinds in men and women.
There is a kind of way of yielding, of being dependent, of having
sensitive being in those having in them dependent independent being
that is different from the kind of way of yielding, of having
dependent being, of having sensitive being in those having in them
any of the kinds of independent dependent being. In short there is
one way of having dependent being, of yielding, of sensitiveness,
of having stupid being, of having feeling about objects, about
practical living that goes with having attacking as the natural way
of winning fighting of winning loving, of winning anything and
there is another whole system of being that is very different from
this, a way of yielding, a way of having sensitiveness in being, a
way of seeing and feeling everything in living, a way of choosing a
way of reacting to everything that goes with having it as being,
the winning fighting by resisting as the real way of being, the
winning anything in living, loving and everything by resisting. So
then sometimes there will be much very much description of the way
of yielding in each one having in them one or the other of these
two kinds of being, independent dependent, dependent independent,
that is of everyone, of all men, of all women.</p>

<p>As I was saying the one I was describing that had all
independent dependent being in solution, this one had as all of
those having independent dependent being in them have it as being,
this one had attacking as the natural way of winning anything. This
one as I was saying had all the being in a flabby kind of state
that made this one when this one was attacking made all the being
in this one then when the being in this one was in motion made it
that the being in this one, all the being of this one, was then
when attacking just in a state of motion and so to any one feeling
this one this one would seem to have resisting being as the natural
way of acting for the movement of the whole being in this one, this
one being then in a state of attacking really was then to every one
knowing this one in this state of action, for it was so slow the
moving of the whole being that made this one, that any one coming
in contact with this one then or any such a one, sticking so to
speak in the mass of this when meeting this one would think of this
one as resisting but this was not true of this one then or of any
of such of them that have independent dependent being in solution
in them, it is stupid being in them that wobbling in them that is
their moving that is so slow and uncertain that to any one knowing
them, feeling them, seeing them it is not in them as attacking
moving activity in them but attacking that is the being in this one
and in the others like this one having in them each one independent
dependent being. And so then often this kind of a one is from the
spreading of the being in that one always then slower and slower in
moving in the attacking activity of such a one, and very very often
with such a one the attacking never coming to real action as a
using of the energy generated in the attacking feeling in
independent dependent being of such a kind of one, makes such a
kind of one a nervous kind of being and this is then the way
independent dependent being can in some be very confusing for
attacking does not seem to be the way of active being of them and
so it takes much knowing of the being in men and women to realise
the action in them. This one then the one I was describing had then
independent dependent being but attacking never came to really be
ever an action and so this one was to many very resisting, stubborn
in resisting and this was only because attacking being in this one
never came to be anything more than the whole mass of being that
was this one being just moving. As I was saying before, this one
that I was describing was the least possible concentration, the
most diffuse possible kind of existing of independent dependent
being. As I was saying this one a little more concentrated was what
made the being of Martha Hersland, Martha who is now soon to be a
complete one to every one reading this description. As I was saying
the one I have been just describing had with this attacking always
much nervous being. As I was saying this one I was describing being
made a little into something having a little more concentration
would be the being I am now beginning describing. As I was saying
the one I was describing was of the independent dependent kind of
them, this was the being too that Martha Hersland had in her. The
one I was describing had independent dependent being in its weakest
concentration, Martha Hersland had independent dependent being in a
state of a little more concentration. As I was saying all her
living the first one I was describing was a whole one, always a
complete one to herself and to every one, this then as I was
saying, being always a whole one to herself and every one all
through her living was a thing every one will know soon in Martha
Hersland. The first one then I was describing was of the
independent dependent kind of them that is one having attacking as
the natural way of winning fighting, this is the being, the
independent dependent being, is the being that is in Martha
Hersland, the one I am now again beginning describing, the oldest
of the three of them, the three Hersland children.</p>

<p>As I was saying there is a kind of way of yielding, a kind of
way of having sensitive being that every one having independent
dependent being have in them as their way of being. There will be
just now very little description of this in any one. Later there
will be very much description of this in every one having in them
independent dependent being. Now there will be mostly a beginning
of understanding of attacking and resisting and stupid being, and
nervous being, and a little of the yielding and the sensitive being
in some having in them independent dependent being and now there
will be a beginning of all these in one and this one is Martha
Hersland the oldest of the three Hersland children.</p>

<p>As I was saying when Martha was a very little one, the Herslands
were living in a ten acre place and they were poor people in small
houses living near them and the Herslands had a governess and
servants then living in the house with them.</p>

<p>Later when Martha was a little bigger, she went to a school near
them where the children living in the small houses near them went
too to get their instruction and Martha was of them then of all of
them the poor people near them; the Hersland children always had
then a governess in the house with them. This made two different
kinds of living for them, this was more troublesome to Martha than
to the two other children who were boys and so not really in actual
relation to the family living and the governess in the house with
them. To begin now a description of what every one knowing Martha
Hersland when she was a little one felt or knew or thought of the
being that now every one reading is commencing feeling,
knowing.</p>

<p>As I was saying, when Martha was a very little one and just
beginning to go out with other children the governess was never
then with the Hersland children, any of them, when they were very
little ones and went out with other children. The children were of
the living of the people about them, they had that kind of living
feeling in them, the kind of living feeling natural in the people
living in the small houses near them. The Hersland family then, the
Hersland children all three of them had the living feeling in them
of the people about them. Mr. Hersland had not the living feeling
of the people about them completely in him for he went every day
into a very different kind of living but he had a good deal of it
in him for his past living was not strongly ever in him. Mrs.
Hersland had no other daily living than her household and her
children and the living feeling of the people in the small houses
near them but in Mrs. Hersland there was always in her as her real
living feeling for her, the past living, the right rich American
living that was the natural way of living in her. The three
children as I was saying had each one of them more in them then of
the living feeling natural to the people then around them than they
had the living feeling belonging to the kind of living natural to
the children of the father and the mother of them. Each one of the
three of them Martha, Alfred and David Hersland had in them the
living feeling natural to the poorer people around them differently
in them. This will come out in the long histories of each one of
them. This is now a long history of the oldest of them, Martha
Hersland and this is now a beginning of description of the way she
had in her to be of them the people living near the Herslands in
small houses near the ten acre place where the Herslands were
living then in that part of Gossols where no other rich people were
living.</p>

<p>As I was saying when Martha was a little one, when she first
went to school and this was very soon after the Herslands began
living in the ten acre place in that part of Gossols where no other
rich people were living for Martha had been born when the Herslands
had just come to Gossols and were living in the hotel as I was
saying, in the hotel where Mrs. Hersland knew Sophie Shilling and
Pauline Shilling and Mrs. Shilling; and so as I was saying when
they came, the Hersland family, to live on the ten acre place where
they went on living to after the time when Martha a grown woman
came back out of her trouble to live again with them, Martha the
oldest of the three Hersland children was old enough to begin her
schooling, was old enough to begin having living feeling forming in
her, to be of them the people living near them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mr. Hersland believed in independence for his
children, in democratic schooling for them, in having a governess
in the house with them for their education, in healthy out of door
living.</p>

<p>Martha Hersland then when she was a very little one, when she
was a little one, when she was a bigger one, when she was running
her own living, when she was a lost one, when she was shrunken when
she was older, and always all of her living every minute in her
living was the same one, the same whole one, to herself and to
every one ever knowing her being. She was as I was saying a little
more concentrated version of the one I was just describing. Like
that one she was always all her living a whole one, like that one
always all her living being a whole one had not really much
meaning. This is now again a beginning of the being Martha had in
her all her living.</p>

<p>Some have their real being in young living, some do not have it
then in them, all have their real being in young living to some,
not any one has their real being in young living to some. Martha
Hersland had in her independent dependent being as I was saying.
Martha in her young living was a whole one, always all her living
Martha was a whole one. Sometime she was older, sometimes she was
happier, sometimes she was nervouser, sometimes she was farther
from and sometimes nearer failure, always she had the same being in
her, always she was of the independent dependent kind of them,
always she was like the other one I was describing excepting that
Martha had independent dependent being in a little more
concentrated form in her and so she would keep together even
without the skin of her to hold her, one part would stick to the
other part of her, she would not be flowing everywhere if there was
not a skin to hold her, so then she was a little in more ways a
whole one than the one I was describing that had independent
dependent being in solution. Always then, as I was saying, Martha
was a whole one. When Martha was a little one, as I was saying she
was of them the poorer children living near the Hersland family
then and she went to school with them. When she was a little one as
I was saying the Hersland family always had a governess living in
the house with them to educate the Hersland children in music,
french and German and any other kind of education Mr. Hersland at
any other time thought it would be good for them to be having. The
Hersland family then had a governess living in the house with them
when Martha was a little one and then on to when Martha was quite
old enough not to like them ever to be interfering with anything
she wanted to be doing, with any kind of reading or knowing any one
or any way she was learning anything. Then later than that they the
Herslands still had one and then more and more the governess living
in the house with them had really nothing to do with the Hersland
children, but always as long as a governess was in the house with
them the governess would be a little sometime troublesome to Martha
Hersland and her living then.</p>

<p>To those knowing Martha Hersland then when she was a young one
when she was beginning her individual being, she was then a whole
one, to no one quite entirely pleasing, but most of those knowing
her then liked her well enough whenever they thought about her and
sometimes then they did not like her.</p>

<p>As I was saying she went to school with the children near them,
the for the Hersland children, poorer children near them. As I was
saying when the Hersland family moved to the ten acre place Martha
was already old enough to begin her schooling. As I was saying then
when she was a very little one and she was coming home with them,
they went faster than she could then, they left her then and she
was running with the umbrella one of them had left with her after
saying she would carry it for her and she was saying I will throw
the umbrella in the mud and then she was crying, I have thrown the
umbrella in the mud, and then later she got home and the umbrella
was not with her but one of the other ones one of those who had
left her went back that day later and got it for her. Then she was
a very little one and just beginning knowing the children near her.
When she was a little bigger she was in her living almost entirely
of them the people near her. As I was saying they mostly all liked
her well enough when they thought about her, they did not think
very much about her, sometimes when they thought about her they did
not like her. She was for them mostly then as if she had been one
of them in her natural way of living, there was nothing in her to
make her a different kind of child from the others of them, she was
of them and yet a little sometimes it was troublesome to her and
for them in her that she was not of them in the living that would
have been natural for her. It was more important in her for them
when a little they were beginning all of them to have loving in
them, for she not being of them a little must not get into a kind
of trouble that would be alright for them in the kind of living
that was the natural way of living for them. Neither they nor she
really knew this inside them ever in their living but it was a
little troublesome there to her and for them, troublesome as the
governess was in her living, not really ever interfering, sometimes
a little attempting to be interfering, always there as being a
thing that had no meaning really in her living but could not ever
have been there ever if the living that was then for her real
living had been for her her natural way of living. Slowly this came
to be in her as something stronger, something slowly making a
difference in her as she grew older. Slowly then things happened to
these children she knew then as they grew older that would not
happen to her as she grew older. She was living very much their
life when she was not at all any more of them; this is now a little
more description of the being in her and how they felt her every
one who then knew her.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersland as I was saying, in his middle living had in him
much impatient being. Mr. Hersland as I was saying had in him
independent dependent being as a bottom nature to him, as most of
him. Martha Hersland as I was saying had independent dependent
being as all the being in her. Always more and more I am
understanding independent dependent being and all the kinds of ways
it has of being, making different kinds in men and women. Always
more and more I am understanding dependent independent being and
all the ways it has of being in the kinds of men and women having
such being in them. Always more and more then I am understanding
being in all the kinds there are ever existing of men and women. To
commence again now with Martha Hersland and how her father Mr.
David Hersland felt her.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mr. Hersland had a strong feeling about
educating his children. Mostly always it was strongly in him the
feeling of the need of educating them, always it was changing in
him, the feelings he had in him about what kind of education was
the right kind of education for them but always that is mostly
always there was one thing constant in him the wanting them to be
individual and independent. Sometimes when they were too much of
one kind of living he had a new theory of independence for them
that took the form of restrictions on the liberty they were
enjoying and sometimes he wanted that they should be as they would
have been if they had had the living that would have been natural
for them and this came to him a few times in the living of his
daughter Martha and he tried to make her over but mostly he wanted
them to have an education making them to be strong and independent.
About their living the life, of the poor people near them, he never
really thought about this in them. Mostly as I was saying when he
was in the country it was to him as if he were of their living, he
had then no sense of social distinction, they were poor men and he
was a rich one, he never wanted then his children to have any
position. His feeling about his daughter Martha then in the
beginning was that she was of them, later that she could learn from
them what they all knew in living, later when she sometimes met
people it would have been natural she should be knowing he was
impatient at the way she was looking and he was full up then with
impatient feeling. Mostly she was never important to him, very much
later in her living she filled him very full of impatient feeling.
As I was saying they were both of them of the independent dependent
kind of them. There was a great difference in the way they had in
them each one of them independent dependent being. Mr. Hersland to
his children when they were old enough to realise him was very full
of impatient feeling. They were then afraid of him though they knew
it of him that he never would go as far as his anger could drive
him. They knew this of him more and more until almost they were not
afraid of him.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersland had in him independent dependent being, his
daughter Martha had in her independent dependent being. This being
was very different in Mr. Hersland than in Martha Hersland as I was
saying. This is now some description of the differences between
them. This is now some description of the feeling in Mr. Hersland
in different parts of her living about his daughter Martha and what
he thought and said about her. To begin then now with a little
description of the different way their being was in the two of
them.</p>

<p>When Martha was a little one she was a whole one, always she was
a whole one. When Martha was a young one she was a whole one. She
was not very interesting to her father or to any one who knew her,
then in her young living. She was not very interesting ever to her
father or ever very interesting really to any one who ever knew
her.</p>

<p>Sometimes she was a little interesting to some one. She was
never very interesting to her father or to any one knowing her in
her young living. She was never really interesting to her father in
her living. Later in his living she was always with him. In her
young living as I was saying she was really not very interesting to
any one. Always as I was saying she was the same whole one. When
she was first a young woman she was a little interesting to some.
She was never really very interesting to any one. Always, as I was
saying, all her living, she was the same whole one.</p>

<p>She was as I was saying of the independent dependent kind of
them. More and more it is interesting, more and more I am
understanding the being in men and in women. More and more I am
realising that each kind of men and women each kind of the two
kinds of them have completely in them in whatever kind or condition
of being any one will find them, with more or less intelligence,
with more or less strength, with more or less weakness in them,
with more or less originality or energy or interest or success or
failure in them, each kind of them, all the men and women of each
of the two kinds of them of each kind of the two kinds of them have
the same way of eating, drinking, loving, hating, succeeding,
failing, fighting, escaping, have the same kind of being in them as
all the others of the same kind of them and that makes grouping of
men and women always to me more interesting. Sometime in my
explaining it will be interesting to every one, it will be
interesting in explaining men and women for every one interested in
understanding men and women. Mr. Hersland as I was saying had in
him independent dependent being. As I was saying more and more in
his living he was full up with impatient being. As I was saying he
had it in him to always be strong in beginning, to be very strong
in attacking and then he would go another way to another beginning
never knowing that he had not finished to really winning, never
knowing this in him, not really even when in his later living his
children when they were angry at the impatient being then in him
and not then being any longer afraid of him knowing then that he
never would be carried through to the end of the anger in him told
it to him. He never really knew it in him but this was the being in
him as I was saying. He never knew the being in his daughter Martha
until she in his old age living managed for him, until she came
back out of her troubles to them and then he was beginning already
to be shrunk from the outside of him and she was then not
interesting to him. She never really was interesting to him. He
never knew it in her that she had independent dependent being in
her, because for him she was not thorough in anything, she was
always beginning and never really beginning anything. This was in
her for him when she was a little one and then when she was
beginning her education it was annoying to him for always he was
really beginning and always she was almost beginning and then when
he was changing she was then really beginning and then it was to
him in her stupid being, that she was nervous then and not
finishing anything, not thorough in anything. His feeling was very
different with his two sons who each in their way were annoying to
him but Martha was annoying to him being as she was of the same
kind of being as the being that was in him. Martha as I was saying
always was a whole one, as I was saying when she was a young one
she was of the living of the people living in small houses near the
Hersland family then. She was completely of their living then, the
governess the Hersland family had living with them was sometimes
troublesome to Martha in her living but only one of them the last
one Madeleine Wyman was ever really troublesome and that was when
she was trying as I was saying to carry out in the children and
mostly on Martha who was a girl and older the ideas of education
Mr. Hersland had then in him. It was then that Mr. Hersland came to
a realisation that Martha was not really thorough in anything.
Martha was hard-working and did well enough in her schooling but
when he wanted her to have disciplining, to make strong beginnings
in french and German and music and swimming and exercising and
dancing, as I was saying she was always a little mixed up in
beginning and then had a nervous confusion from the changing and
Madeleine Wyman was thorough and annoying to her and then Martha
was completely of them the poorer people near them. As I was saying
Martha was interesting enough then to every one but not really very
interesting to any one knowing her then. As I was saying she was
more completely of them the poorer people near them when the
governess Madeleine Wyman was living with the Hersland family in
the house with them and for some years longer than she was of any
other living, was more of them in her feeling, in her living, in
her understanding of all living but always then all of them the
poorer people living in small houses near them were having things
happen to them, the young boys the young girls whom she knew then
which was not of her future living to have happen to her then and
always neither she nor they knew this in them but always it was
there between them and Martha was then there in living neither bird
or beast or good red herring and she did not know it nor did any
one else know it of her then.</p>

<p>So then Martha's young living was very confusing to her then but
she did not know it in her then. She had in her as I was saying
independent dependent being, she had attacking as her natural way
of fighting but as I was saying she was only a little more
concentrated in her being than that other one I was describing and
so when she was in motion except in jerks there was not really very
much action, there was very much nervous being and confusion and
this was in her stupid being and always all her living she was the
same one the same whole one I have been just describing.</p>

<p>This then was the young living in her. It was well enough but
rather confused inside her. Confusion always was strong in her. All
of her when it was in motion just was sort of knocking together,
and that was mostly all the active being in her and that was to
many who knew her obstinacy and resisting in her and to her father
it was that she was never thorough. Sometimes there was stronger
reaction for a moment in her, anger, or a deep commotion for
something that was a disgrace to some one or to her and then she
was a little more than the whole one that she mostly just was and
was mostly to every one.</p>

<p>This was then the being in her. Always then she was not very
interesting to any one knowing her. Her mother had never a very
lively realisation of her. Her mother more and more was external to
her when she Martha was to her mother no longer inside her. Not
that Mrs. Hersland ever knew this in her, always she had a feeling
of having had and having her as a child as part of her and always
she had her dresses and her hats and all as important to her but as
I was saying Martha was then when she was growing completely as
completely as there was really living being in her of them the poor
people living in the small houses near the Hersland family then. As
I was saying later there was a difference, that they were having
living that could not be in one going to be having a different
future from that that any of them would have as natural to them.
Earlier when she was a young one, yes there was a little difference
between them for she had a father and a mother to them and these
other children could be conscious of the father and the mother of
her and she had a governess living in the house with her and
servants and all that that made her in ways of living, but mostly
to them then the poorer people living in the small houses those
that knew her then they did not feel the difference to be a
difference that in any way cut her off from the living natural to
them only they could sometimes be conscious of the mother or the
father or the governess or the servants when they were with her,
when they were not with her, not from anything in her but from
their being really existing the father and the mother and the
governess and the servants of the Hersland family. So then in her
younger living she was not cut off from them by her future for the
children she was then knowing were young then and not having any
such feeling. Almost not at all then was she in any way cut off
from them. Sometimes they as I was saying, from hearing other
people or their parents talking, from seeing them or from something
that Martha said in talking could be conscious of Martha's mother
or father or governess or servants living in the house with her and
so they might be just by a shade cut off from her but mostly then
she was completely of them the children and the poor people living
near them. As I was saying she was really then, Martha, not very
interesting to any one knowing her then. She was completely of them
then the people living in small houses near the Hersland family
then. She had no feeling in her of a different kind of living in
her. All the active living there was in her was of the living of
the poorer people near her.</p>

<p>As I was saying when she was quite a young one there was not any
feeling in any of them, not in the parents of these children then
any feeling that she was in her feeling cut off from them by not
being able to have some things happen to her that could not happen
to any one having the kind of future that was the natural kind of
future living for her. As I was saying a little such a feeling came
when she was somewhat older, when she was older with them, but in
her younger living there was not in herself not in any one of them,
a little perhaps in her mother and the governesses and servants
then living in the house with her, not any in her father then not
anything of such a feeling. And so she was completely of them then
to them to all of them the children and the other people living in
the small houses near the Hersland family ten acre living place
then, she was completely then of their living then always even when
the children or the others were conscious of the existing of Mr. or
Mrs. Hersland or the governess or the servants living with
them.</p>

<p>At this time Martha was completely of the living of these people
near her, of the children and the parents of them, then in her
younger living. Later as I was saying there was the developing of
feeling the natural future for her in her in them and in her father
and a very little in her and always a little more and more in all
of them. And then it came that she went away to another kind of
living. This is now a little history of how they felt her when she
was young, when she was a little older, every one who then came to
know her. There will be then a little description of the transition
to another kind of living that then came to her.</p>

<p>When she was quite a young one, as I was saying, she was then
quite completely of the living of the children and the people
living near the Hersland family then when the Hersland family were
living in that part of Gossols where no other rich people were
living then.</p>

<p>She was completely of their living then. She could have happen
to her then what could happen to any of them in their living, in
their schooling, in their playing, in their quarrelling, in their
liking, in their disliking, in their being interesting one to the
other of them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Martha Hersland was not then very interesting to
any of them, she was good enough at doing anything, they were
friendly enough with her most of them, they did not most of them
think vary well of the way she did quarrelling whenever she did any
of that with any of them. One little boy wanted her to do loving
the little boy who with his sister lived with the father who smoked
to help his asthma but this was not very much of a success for
Martha then had a nervous feeling and was not very daring and was
not very understanding and had a confusion that was a little like
wanting, a little like obstinate hesitation, a little like being
afraid of everything, a little like a very stupid way of being, and
the little boy then forgot about her being existing for really
Martha was not then to any one very interesting. Martha was alright
then but she was not interesting enough to be successful in
quarrelling or in loving then, they all of them forgot her a little
when she wanted to be quarrelling or they were quarrelling or they
wanted to be loving or she wanted to be loving. Perhaps a very
little it was that she was not quite entirely completely,
altogether of them, perhaps it was that she was not then really
interesting to any one. She was of them then so that she was living
their living entirely then with them and they did begin with her
then in loving or in quarrelling as they did with each other in
their living then but as I was saying she was not interesting then,
the being in her as I was saying when it was active was just
knocking together in her and that made in her a little confusion
and she was not stupid in ordinary living and she was not
interesting and that was her younger living. When she was a little
older she was still always with them the people near the Hersland
family then in that part of Gossols where no rich people were
living then. She was with them then living their kind of being,
hearing them talking and knowing everything happening to them but
not any of them then included her with them in quarrelling or
loving, not even as making a beginning. The natural future for her
was then separating them. She was still very much with them, with
the girls she would help the mothers cooking or setting the table,
she knew their daily living, she helped them in wiping the dishes
when they were washing them, and was with them and always then she
was not of them even as she had been to them when she was a younger
one and she never knew it then and they never knew it then. She was
not any more interesting then. Something happened to her then that
made her now for a little time more than the whole one she was all
her living to herself and perhaps a little to some who then and
later knew her, it was really just a little accentuation of being
put in motion and of that I will now give a very little
description.</p>

<p>No one knew very much what Martha was feeling about anything
when she was in her young living. She was not ever telling very
much of her feeling then to any one, and never to any one in the
family living. Not any or the Hersland family ever were telling
each other very much about what feeling they had in them. Martha
was really not telling any one very much in her young living the
feeling she had in her about anything and then in a way too it was
not in her ready for telling. It had not form in her yet, feeling
in her, there was really then no way for her to tell any one
anything about her feeling.</p>

<p>Now there will be a little more telling of the kind of a whole
one she was, of the kind of nature there was in her. There will
then be a little more telling of the moment in her when the
movement of the being in her was a little faster, came to be almost
violent emotion in her. There will then be a little telling of her
living, what she was knowing, what she was feeling in her young
living. There will be a little telling of how much she had heard
about living and how much she had seen, how little and how much she
knew then and what then happened in her when she saw something that
really made all her being move together and faster than it had ever
had motion before in her. There will be then a little telling of
how much she had heard about anything in living, how much she had
heard, and how little she knew and what she saw then and what she
felt then when she saw something that I will now soon be telling.
This is now a little description of how much she had heard and how
little she knew and what she saw in her young living. There will
then be a description of her seeing a man hitting a woman with an
umbrella in another part of town from that in which the Herslands
were living and of her consequent deciding to go to college and get
that kind of education. To begin then. Martha as I was saying was
of the independent dependent kind in men and women. Martha as I was
saying had it in her to be of the kind of them that have attacking
as their natural way of winning fighting. Martha as I was saying
was of this kind of them. Martha as I was saying was mostly never
really attacking. Martha as I was saying when her being was all of
it in motion, and mostly when any of it was in motion it was all of
it in motion and then it was mostly as pieces knocking together in
confusion and in nervous being and not then into really attacking,
sometimes it could happen but this was not very often, yes in a
sense a very little of it was in her very often, but enough of it
to really make an action was not in her very often, sometimes it
could happen that there was a strong impulse and then there was a
strong movement of her being of all the being that was Martha
Hersland and always then it never really even then came to be
really attacking, it just went off into very strong knocking
together of pieces of the being in her, a livelier confusion inside
her than just the ordinary confusion in her and that was all there
was of attacking in her in the most active being ever in her. This
was the being in her it was independent dependent being the being
that has attacking as the natural way of winning in fighting or in
loving but as I was saying the being in her never got into motion
to carry on to anything as object in attacking, it just remained
inside her as knocking together in her to be a confusion and a
nervous being in her. She had in her as I was saying, independent
dependent being, that was all the being there was in her. As I was
saying attacking being was the natural way of winning fighting in
her but attacking never came to be really an action carrying on to
anything outside her.</p>

<p>She was as I was saying in her young living not very interesting
to any one who then knew her. She did not then, as I was saying
tell very much to any one any feeling she had in her, really then
nothing came to be in her clear inside her to tell any one if any
one was there to listen to her. This was true of her mostly all her
young living as I was saying.</p>

<p>She was then as I was saying all her young living completely of
them the people living near the Hersland family then, she was then
not of the living of her father and her mother. As I was saying
later in her young living she was very annoying to her father, she
was not ready enough to be beginning and then there was confusion
in her when he was changing to a new beginning and this was often
like stubborn resistance and often then her father would begin to
have in him very much impatient feeling and some anger. And always
then Martha a little was beginning to be beginning and a little so
then she had in her her own feeling and a good deal then she was
afraid to hear him when he was beginning with her though always she
felt it a little in her that it was really all impatient being in
him and that he never would carry it through against her as anger
the annoyed impatient angry feeling he had then toward her. As I
was saying all this was mostly a trouble to her when the governess
Madeleine Wyman was beginning to take charge of her. This was too
annoying to be only confusing in her, what right had Miss Wyman to
be forcing her, Martha, and resistance was then in Martha a thing
having in her a clearer meaning than any time before in her living.
Really Martha was afraid of Madeleine Wyman more in a way than she
was of her father, Madeleine Wyman was a compacted power that kept
going and always was there and there was not really any way of
getting away from her when one was in the house with her. This was
then the beginning of more concentrated consciousness of feeling in
Martha this experience with Madeleine Wyman. This did not last a
long time as I was saying earlier. Madeleine Wyman came soon to be
only of the living of Mr. and Mrs. Hersland, not at all of the
three Hersland children. Always she was sometimes troublesome to
them but more and more as I was saying she was only of the living
of Mr. and Mrs. Hersland and not at all of the three Hersland
children. Always as I was saying she was troublesome to them then
and later in their living and there will be later more history
written of the feeling about her in each one of the three of them.
Now there is to be a little description of Martha Hersland and what
she knew and saw and heard in her younger living.</p>

<p>As I was saying in her younger living she was not really ever
very interesting to any one knowing her then. As I was saying all
the living there was really in her then was of the living of the
children and the sisters and the brothers and the fathers and the
mothers of the children that she was knowing then. The Hersland
family living was not really important then as living for her being
then. As I was saying all the active living really in her, in her
younger living, was the living of the people living in small
houses, the people who-were as I was saying half poor city people
half poor country people in their living and their feeling.</p>

<p>These were then the ones that gave to her living in her younger
living all the meaning living had in her then.</p>

<p>As I was saying these children, these people, had in them all of
them the feeling of city living and the feeling of country living.
Martha Hersland in her younger living was completely of them as I
was saying. Martha Hersland had then in her young living the kind
of feeling about living that they had in them. There was as I was
saying always the difference of her having a different kind of
father and mother and way of living from any of them but that was
not there in her feeling and was not there in their thinking, it
did however make a difference in her understanding of things that
happened among them. As I was saying in her very young living and
then a little later in her young living she was completely of them
the people living in the small houses there then there where there
were no rich people living excepting the Hersland family as I was
saying. She was completely of them, of their living, of their way
of feeling living in her later younger living and yet already as I
was saying there could be in her a little less really being of them
even than there had been because already then future living was
important in the present living of all of them and her future
living was a different thing from their future living. As I was
saying she had not been so very interesting to any one in her
younger living, to any one of them. As I was saying there would be
in them a little beginning with her too in quarrelling one little
boy as I was saying tried a little in loving, in things they should
not be doing and really she was not resisting but it could not come
to anything for there was not in her anything really active inside
her then, she was really not even so important to them then any of
them than when she had been a very little one but really as I have
been saying she never really was interesting to any one in her
younger living.</p>

<p>As I was saying in her later younger living she was completely
with them and yet then she was the most cut off from them for then
future living was beginning to count in the being and feeling and
doing of all of them and always her future living more and more
certainly was a different thing from that of those she was knowing
then. She was then not really then very interesting really to any
of them then.</p>

<p>She was completely with them then in her daily living then, then
in her later younger living. She was always with them then, then in
her later younger living, she would be with them whatever they were
doing when she was not at home studying in some one of the ways her
father then was thinking was important for her to be doing.</p>

<p>She was with them then, in the day-time, in the evening, all the
time she was with them, the people living in small houses near
them. Some of the girls and some of the boys had already commenced
to be working. I was saying that there was one family living in a
small house near the Hersland family then of a mother a foreign
woman who was father wooden, and a father who was not important to
any one, and three daughters who each one sometime came to have
real beauty in them. It was the second one of them whom Martha knew
very well in the later part of her young living. She had not come
yet to have beauty in her this one, she was just beginning to work
out to learn dress-making. The older one who was working in the
city somewhere had come to have her beauty and there were queer
things one heard then about her of her marrying a rich man, a man
whose family made much money making chocolate and every one had
heard of them from eating the chocolate they were making and the
name sounded very Italian and somehow every one knew though no one
of them had ever seen him that he was a handsome fierce looking
black-moustached man and a very rich one. None of the family of
this girl ever said anything, Martha Hersland did not know really
where she heard all about the oldest girl for when she thought it
over she knew no one had told her. It came to be in her then like
something she had dreamed about some one and so it had all of it no
real meaning for her. She knew dimly that all of them the three
Banks boys one of whom was learning telegraphing, one of whom was
learning shoemaking, the other learning nothing and perhaps
sometimes stealing something, she knew they knew the three girls
and said things to them that Martha was never really hearing but as
I was saying Martha was not really interesting then to any one and
inside, her feeling was not active to be to herself or to any one a
thing possibly having then any expression. The young Rodman boy was
to her a little more an active awakening because he said things to
make her be understanding. There were two of them, the eldest a big
lumbering fellow and this young one who made fun of her whenever he
saw her and he just annoyed her and that was not really very active
then in her. She was, as I was saying, of them, she was always with
them, all of them, she heard them talking, she knew what they were
doing, she would listen to the mothers and the fathers of them
talking, she had no other notion of living than that she saw and
heard and felt and had when she was with them and always her future
would be a different one and so she was not then understanding what
all of them were living for to her her future living was unknown
and so she had no present living, with all of them then it was a
different thing, their present living was their future living and
so she was not really ever then of them. As I was saying Martha was
not then really interesting to any one. As I was saying feeling was
then in her not very clear to herself or to any one. As I was
saying she was annoying then to her father by her not making very
good beginnings and not being as he put it really thorough in
anything. No one of his children ever were to him in their younger
living really thorough in anything. The other two were interested
in resisting beginning or in beginning, he had not any such a
satisfaction, as I was saying, with his daughter and she was then
in her later younger living annoying to him. He wanted her to learn
housekeeping then and to him it was a good thing for her to be with
them the poorer people living near them so she could do what all
those other girls she knew could do as to cooking and dress-making
and of course Martha could not really do them and sometimes then he
asked her to do some such thing and then of course she could not do
it for him and then he would be full up with impatient feeling that
she could not do that thing, that always she was not as he put it
ever thorough in anything. And always all this time she was
studying in one way or another, with tutors or a teacher from the
school near her and sometimes by herself and then there came to be
a change in her and for her. Always her mother was not very close
to her. The mother was there always for all of her children but
this was for Martha only when she was a little sick or for dressing
or for an occasional visiting. This was the time when Mrs. Hersland
was having in her her most important feeling of herself inside her
as I was saying. So Martha was not then really very interesting to
any one. Martha always was a whole one as I was saying. Martha was
not then really very interesting to any one.</p>

<p>There will be much description of the feeling her brothers had
about their sister in the long histories that will be written later
of the two of them. There will be very much written of the feeling
the father Mr. Hersland had about her in the history to be written
later of the ending of the being in him. There will never be very
much written of the feeling that the mother had about her. Always
then, as I was saying, to each one she was a whole one. There has
been now a little written of how those who knew her when she was a
young one, felt her. As I was saying mostly she was not really very
interesting to any one. As I was saying she was then not very
interesting to any one who then knew her. The servants and the
governesses excepting perhaps a little Madeleine Wyman when she was
trying to carry out on her the theories of education Mr. Hersland
always was explaining then to her had not very individual feeling
about her. She was one of the Hersland family to them. Some of her
teachers at the school where Martha got her American education had
a little more feeling about her. Some of them almost were nearly
interested in her. She could have a kind of earnestness in her, it
never came really to be there in her in her young living and to
some of her teachers then it was that she had a stupid way of being
resisting, of being obstinate in her, but as I was saying sometimes
a little one of them almost would be interested in her particularly
after a governess or her father had been there to talk about her,
to explain about her, to arrange about, her. So then as I was
saying Martha Hersland in her younger living was not really very
interesting to any one who then knew her. Martha Hersland as I was
saying was always a whole one. Martha as I was saying was of the
independent dependent kind of them. The being in Martha as I was
saying was mostly always just in a state of being in confusion.
There was as I was saying in Martha very much nervous being
accompanying the confusion in her being whenever the being in her
was in motion. Mostly always the being in her was in this kind of a
confusion. As I was saying Martha was of the independent dependent
kind of them. This is now again a little a description of the being
in her.</p>

<p>Martha was as I was saying of the independent dependent kind of
men and women. Martha was one of this kind of them and had it as
being to have this kind of being all of it that was in her of the
same degree of concentration, that is to say that there was no part
of the being in her more accented, more effective in her than
another part of the being in her. That is to say it was like this
in her. The one that I was describing and that was a whole one only
ever by the skin of her holding her together there might be one who
might be like her and so then this one though still of the
independent dependent kind of them would have this being with
different accents different meanings in different parts of the
being that was this one. Some have all kinds of combinations of
kinds in them and some as I was saying have even another kind of
substance mixed up with them, the dependent independent kind of
being as we were saying. Now Martha Hersland as I said in the
beginning of this description of the being in her was like the one
that I was describing that was all independent dependent being in
solution and in so fluid a condition that this being is only made
an individual one by the skin separating it from flowing over
everything near it to lose itself in everything and not have
individual existing, Martha Hersland then as I was saying was like
this one only Martha was a little more solid and there was a little
more solidity to her but as I was saying there was not much more
really effective movement to her. The other one the first one I was
describing when substance that was all of her was set in motion
mostly it just sort of bobbled up and down in her it was not active
enough to give any onward attacking motion to the whole of her that
was made by the skin of her holding her together and so there never
came to be real attacking in her indeed as I was saying it was to
most every one seeing her, this one, as if she had resisting being
in her for the substance of her was a heavy slightly sticky one as
I was saying and though attacking being was the way of active being
in her it came to it that she was really resisting because she
never got to anything more than a little bobbing motion and this
one was so an obstruction; always of course there was a slight
attacking action to her for that was the nature of the being in her
but to every one feeling her it was resisting, stupid being,
obstinacy of a dull kind in her, and that was the being in her. Now
Martha Hersland as I was saying was like this one only a little
more solid and so when there was a strong emotion to give motion to
her there could be more real attacking being in her than there ever
could be in the one I was just describing. As I was saying Martha
had as being a substance solid enough so that Martha's skin so to
speak was part of the substance of her, she was a whole one then
more than just by being held together by a skin as was the case in
the other. Martha then had a little more real attacking movement in
her than the other one I was describing who in mixture of being was
just like her. Martha had not really very much forward attacking
motion in her. Mostly in her too it was a confused interaction and
made a confused being in her that was to many knowing her stupid
being in her. This was in her to many knowing her like resisting
being in her but as I was saying she had not really in her
resisting being as a way of winning, as a way of fighting, as a way
of loving, as I was saying confused being that was resisting being
in her to many knowing her was stupid being in her, was failure in
her.</p>

<p>As I was saying Martha when she was a young one was not really
very interesting to any one who knew her then. She was until she
was nearly, almost, a young woman of the feeling and the living of
poorer people as I was saying, more than she was then of any other
living. She was in her daily living of their living and their
feeling as I was saying. This is now a little description of the
feeling and the living she then had in her. She was always then as
I was saying of the living and the feeling of the people, and the
other people that knew them, of people in very small houses living
near the Hersland family then. She was of their daily living then
as I was saying. This is now a little description of what she knew
with them and what she did not know with them then.</p>

<p>As I was saying Martha Hersland was all through her younger
living of the feeling and the living of, for her natural family
living, poor people. She was of the daily feeling and the daily
living of them more than she was of the daily feeling and the daily
living of her family living and feeling. She was then as I was
saying of the daily living and the daily feeling of the people near
her who had in them as I said of them half city feeling and half
country feeling. She was as I was saying as much as there was in
her then of feeling and living of their feeling and their living.
She was with them often in the evening, she was with them more or
less in the day time, she was of their daily living and their daily
feeling more than she was then of any other feeling or living. As I
was just saying she was with them often in the evening when she was
not any longer a very young one, she was with them then very much
of the day-time, she was as I was saying of their daily living and
their daily feeling almost all the daily living and the daily
feeling there was in her then.</p>

<p>She was with them as I was just saying often in the evening now
that she was no longer a very little one and very much of the
day-time. Some of them, the younger ones whom she knew then were
beginning now to go out working and she saw them when they came
back from their working and she was with them then and she was with
them then again in the evening. As I have said almost all there was
of daily living and daily feeling then in her was of the daily
living and the daily feeling of these young people and their
friends and relations and this was not very important to any one
then that this was the daily living and the daily feeling of Martha
Hersland then. Sometimes Mr. Hersland suddenly remembered that
Martha should not go out in the evening, mostly he did not pay much
attention to the daily feeling and the daily living in her then.
Sometimes as I was saying he would suddenly remember she should not
go out in the evening alone with these young people near them and
then he would forbid her going and he would tell her that she
should stay in the house and be with her mother and then he would
lecture her brother that he did not take better care of his
sister.</p>

<p>"You have to take care of her sometime and you might as well
begin, the sooner the better. You will have to do it sooner or
later, I tell you."</p>

<p>"I'll take mine later," said the brother but he was careful that
his father did not hear and he went out that evening as he did many
evenings as I will be telling later in the long history of the
living of him, but on that evening Martha Hersland could not go out
to be with the others.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersland's remembering that she should not go out in the
evening did not happen very often. Mostly she went out in the
evening and the day-time. Sometimes her father coming home from the
city and seeing Martha standing in the yard of some of the small
houses talking would get very angry that she was not at home
studying. He could often get very angry and be full up with
impatient feeling as I was saying whenever he remembered that
Martha was his daughter and was not just what he would have her. At
this time they had not any governess living in the house with them.
Madeleine Wyman had left them and they had no governess after this
one. Mrs. Hersland then did not have much meaning in the family
living. She was weakening a little inside her then as I said when I
was describing the living in her, she was lost then between her big
children and the father of them as I was then saying then when I
was describing the being in Mrs. Hersland. So then as I was just
saying Martha was in her daily living and her daily feeling more of
them the people in small houses near the Hersland family then than
she was of any other daily living or daily feeling then. As I was
saying she was with them often in the evening, as I was saying she
was not then very interesting to any of them then. As I was saying
the future which would be different for her in kind than the future
of them made a separation between them in the things she was
knowing with them and the things they were knowing among them, in
the things she was feeling with them and the things they were
feeling among them, in the things she was doing with them and the
things they were doing among them, in the way she was interesting
to them and the way they were interesting to each other among
themselves then. As I was saying all there was of daily living and
daily feeling in her then was of the daily feeling and daily living
they had among them. As I was saying in a way she was separated
from them, though all the living and feeling she had in her then
was the living and feeling she had from them, by the future living
that would be different in her living from the future living any of
them would naturally be having.</p>

<p>As I was saying she was then not really very interesting to any
one. She might have been a little interesting a couple of evenings
to Harry Brenner but she never really was interesting to him. As I
was saying she was then of their daily living and their daily
feeling, the poorer people near them, and she was with them a good
deal in the day-time and she was with them very often in the
evening. As I was saying sometimes her father remembered that she
should not be out with them in the evening and he would forbid her
going out that evening and he would lecture her brother Alfred
because he did not take care of his sister who should not go out in
the evenings in the way she was doing and the father was full up
then as I was saying with impatient feeling and then that would be
the end of his interfering with Martha's daily living and daily
feeling and Martha's going out in the evening. The mother Mrs.
Hersland was then as I was saying in the history of her living lost
then among her children and the father of them. Always then in her
young living Martha was of them the people near them and this was
of her until she was almost a young woman.</p>

<p>As I was saying she was of them the poorer people in her daily
living and in her daily feeling, as I was saying she was not so
interesting to any of them as they were to each other then and this
was mostly because of the future living there was for her in her
and a little perhaps from the way being was in her but mostly it
was from the future living of her that was naturally to be
different from that of those she was then knowing. As I was saying
she was not so interesting to any of them as they were to each
other then and she was not feeling and living and understanding
anything really in the way they were doing then. As I was saying
she almost might have been interesting to them from her almost
being interesting a couple of evenings to Harry Brenner who was one
of them but she did not come to be really interesting to him.
Perhaps it was the future living in her that made her not come to
be really interesting to Harry Brenner then although there was
almost a beginning of being interested in him. That was the end of
it though then, she never as I was saying was really interesting to
any of them then.</p>

<p>So then this was the being, the living, the feeling, the
understanding in Martha Hersland up to her almost being a young
woman this that I have been describing. Her father as I was saying
had many ideas about her education and then he had impatient
feeling in him that she was not the kind of daughter he had wanted
to have as a daughter to him. The mother as I was saying then had
only a dim feeling then of the being, and the living, and the
feeling there was then in her children. Things were a little dim in
her then but to herself then she and they and the father of them
were still then of the living that was the natural living for them.
To herself inside her they were never at any time neither she nor
her husband nor her children nor their family ever really cut off
from the living that was the natural living to them. Really she was
then lost among them, that was the real being in her then, really
the being in herself and in her husband and her children was really
then a very dim thing to her then but always there was in her the
feeling as I was saying of being in herself and in her husband and
her children part of the well to do living which was the natural
being for her, the only being she ever had had, to her feeling, in
her.</p>

<p>So then as I was saying Martha Hersland in her daily feeling, in
her daily living was of the daily living and the daily feeling of
the people living in small houses near the Hersland family then
living in the part of Gossols where no other rich people were
living. Her father as I was saying was of their daily living and
their daily feeling too somewhat then and on Sundays when he walked
and stopped to talk to them and sat down in the houses with the
women when they were cooking and ate something there in the kitchen
with them and felt inside him a feeling that they were women there
in a room with him. Then it was to him a good thing, then when he
had this kind of feeling of them the women in him, then he thought
and said it was a good thing Martha should learn how to do things,
cooking and sewing and living and feeling like the women he was
seeing then having as women in him to him, then when he was sitting
with them in the kitchen or sometimes in their little gardens. Then
he said Martha should learn the living they had in them, and he
said it to them and then he said it to Martha when he saw her. This
was one way he had of feeling about her being of the daily living
and the daily feeling of these people living near them. Then
sometimes of an evening as I was saying he would see Martha leaving
the house and he would suddenly remember then she should not go out
of an evening, that was no way a daughter of his in his position
should he acting and then he would tell her he would see to it that
she should stay home and he would employ some one to look after her
and make of her the kind of educated person that it was right he
should have for a daughter. And so as I was saying Martha Hersland
until she was almost a young woman was in her daily living and in
her daily feeling of them the people living in the small houses
near the ten acre place where the Hersland family were living then
and she was with them and in the houses of them a good deal in the
daytime and she was a good deal with all of them in the evenings in
the later part of her young living and as I was saying she was not
really then interesting to any of them and as I was saying she was
not then really feeling and really living and really understanding
the living and the feeling that they had together then amongst
them. This was the daily living and the daily feeling in Martha
Hersland and the being in Martha Hersland this that I have been
just describing when it came that she had an awakening into realler
feeling and then she came to have a real attacking moment and it
lasted to her beginning her university education. This is now a
little description of this in her.</p>

<p>As I was saying she had a being in her that was mostly in a
condition always all her living of being in a state of confusion
inside her. This gave to her always very much nervous being in her,
this made her to every one often very stupid in resisting and very
slow in beginning and very foolish in not remembering anything that
she should have been learning in her living. This will come out
very clearly in the description of her living with her husband and
then later with her father after she had come back to live with him
after all the trouble she had in her living. It will come out very
clearly then the being in her, the confusion always in her that
made her to every one knowing her mostly always very stupid in
resisting and really very slow and yet very jerky and unexpected in
beginning and very foolish in not remembering what having been
experiencing something any one would have supposed she would have
been really learning.</p>

<p>Now there will be a little more description of her daily living,
of the living and the feeling of the living and the feeling of the
people in the little houses near the Hersland family then in her
young living and the ending in her of this living and this
feeling.</p>

<p>The kind of being she had in her I have already a little been
describing, the kind of a whole one that she was and the nature and
the kind of way her being was active in her. There has been too a
little description of how much she had heard and how little she
knew in living. As I was saying she was not then really very
interesting to any one. No one knew anything very much then of what
she was feeling about anything then and she did not know what she
felt then about anything in living and nobody knew what she felt
then about living and really she did not clearly then feel
anything.</p>

<p>This was the way she was then when one day when she was alone in
another part of the town where she had gone to take a lesson in
singing she saw a man hit a woman with an umbrella, and the woman
had a red face partly in anger and partly in asking and the man
wanted the woman to know then that he wanted her to leave him alone
then in a public street where people were passing and Martha saw
this and this man was for her the ending of the living I have been
describing that she had been living. She would go to college, she
knew it then and understand everything and know the meaning of the
living and the feeling in men and in women. She would go to college
and she told it then to her father and her mother and they had no
objection, no one was paying very much attention and she began her
preparation and she came to know some other young girls and young
boys, not rich ones like those it was natural she should then be
knowing but more of her natural kind than any she had known before
in her living. One of them John Davidson she knew very well then
and he and she played music and sang together and then she was
ready and then she went to college for more education. This is to
be now more history of, in her, the ending of her older young
living and her subsequent going to college and of the man she met
there and who there married her.</p>

<p>As I was saying Martha then was once a very little one a baby,
and then a little one and then a young girl and then a woman and
then she was older and then later there was an ending to her and
always all through this living in her she was the same whole one
inside her and to every one who knew her.</p>

<p>In the description of her that I have been writing so far Martha
has been a very little one, a baby, and then a little one and then
a young girl and then about to become a young woman and always then
in a way to herself inside her and to every one knowing her she had
been the same whole one. This was then as I was saying in a way
always true she was always the same whole one inside her and to
every one ever knowing her.</p>

<p>In some the nature in them is clearer when they are very young,
in some when they are young, in some when they are not so young, in
some when they are getting older, in some when they are old ones.
Martha was mostly always to every one who knew her the same whole
one, when she was a very little one, a little one, an older one, a
very old one, mostly always she was to every one about the same
kind of a whole one.</p>

<p>And this in a way always was true of her, all her living she was
the same whole one, there was very little change in her, mostly all
her living the whole of her was repeating completely, when she was
learning, when she was loving, when in her later living she was
still struggling. She was then all her living the same whole one,
there was the same concentration of being in her, the same the
proportion of one thing to the other things active in her.</p>

<p>As I was saying this was in the main true of her, she was of the
kind of men and women and there are always many many millions of
them and they are of every kind in a way of men and women, that is
of independent dependent or dependent independent kind of them who
are all their living the same whole one who always are repeating
the complete whole thing they always are in themselves and to every
one, who have the same concentration of the being in them always
all their living when they are babies, when they are young ones,
when they are older ones, when they are old ones, who have the same
proportion of one thing to the other things active in them every
minute in their living. As I was saying Martha Hersland was of this
kind of them though there were moments in her living when it seemed
a little different in her for sometimes she really got into motion
and mostly as I was saying motion was just confusion in her, it
never came to movement in her it just was mixing up of being inside
her.</p>

<p>As I was saying she was of the independent dependent kind of
being those having in them attacking as their natural way of
winning fighting, as their natural way of winning in loving, and as
I was saying mostly in her, commotion in her did not make an actual
attack by her for her and this was not there really to herself
inside her, to herself there was real movement in her, but to every
one then there was only stupid resisting and nervous being in her
and this was mostly the whole history of her. As I was saying this
was not quite the whole history of her, it did come to happen in
her, sometimes in the living, in the history of her, that the shock
of commotion in her was so strong as to give a forward movement to
her. As I was saying that happened once to her when she was a very
little one when she threw down the umbrella, it happened every now
and then in her, it happened, as I was saying, when she saw the man
hitting the woman in the street with his umbrella to rid himself
then of her and of the asking in her. When she saw this it was not
a horror she had in her, really she had not any very certain
feeling in her, mostly in her living, as I was saying, she had not
any very certain feeling, mostly as I was saying it was confusion,
excitement and nervousness she had in her when there was movement
inside her, then as I was saying, when she saw the man hit the
woman with an umbrella and she was just then passing, she had not
then as I was saying any distinct feeling then in her about what
she had been seeing, not then and not then later, but it gave a
motion to her, it gave her direction to getting for herself a
university education.</p>

<p>This then that I have been describing is the being in Martha and
now there will be more history of her.</p>

<p>As I was just saying that which I have been describing is the
being in Martha Hersland. I have been describing the living and the
feeling she had in her until now she was almost a young woman and a
new life was to begin for her.</p>

<p>As I was saying she started then her preparation to get for
herself a college education. As I was saying no one was objecting.
Her father Mr. Hersland was not very much interested just then in
his children. She had teachers and she could be taught enough by
them to pass her entrance examination. She began a little then to
know other kinds of young girls and boys than those that she had
until then been knowing. She played duets in the evening and sang
with John Davidson who was preparing to go away to get an eastern
education. She was less and less and then almost not at all with
them the people living near the Hersland family then, and then as I
was saying she went to get her college education. This is now to be
more history of her and how she came to have a lover and how he
came to marry her and how he came then to leave her and what
happened then to him and what happened then to her. In short this
is now to be a history of all the living there ever was in her, all
the being in her. As I was saying there was not then very much
change in the being in her, she was always then the same whole one,
at first there was a little more movement in her, she learned a
little at first how to have definite feeling in her, she learned
that in the college life around her but it was not really the being
in her and all this will come out in the history of her. This is
now then more history of her. Now then there will begin to be a
little history of another, of one of those who came to know her,
who came to the same college where she was learning to do the
things I have just been describing. This is now the beginning of
the history of him as I am saying. This is now a little description
of the living there had been in Phillip Redfern.</p>

<p>There was then in the living of Martha Hersland the being born
in the hotel where the Hersland family was living when Mr. David
Hersland came to Gossols to make for himself a great fortune and
brought with him his wife little Fanny Hissen who was to know there
the Shilling family who where to make in her the beginning of the
feeling of herself inside her. There was then in the living of
Martha Hersland that her father Mr. David Hersland and her mother
Fanny Hersland came together to make her and she was born in the
hotel where Mr. and Mrs. Hersland were living when they first came
to Gossols where Mr. Hersland was to make for himself a great
fortune and where Mrs. Hersland was to have mostly a living that
was not the way of living that it would have been natural for her
to be having. Martha was born then in the hotel and Mr. Hersland
was just beginning then to succeed in winning fighting and Mrs.
Hersland was beginning then through knowing the Shilling family,
Sophie Shilling, Pauline Shilling and the mother of them to have a
little in her to herself inside the feeling of herself to herself
in her that it was not really natural for her to have ever really
in her. Then in the living of Martha Hersland she was a little one
in the ten acre place where the Hersland family lived a little
later and there it was that Mr. Hersland was winning fighting and
then having impatient feeling in him and then being full up with
impatient feeling and then having in him beginning failing in
winning and then having in him only beginning and there Mrs.
Hersland had always more and more in her from the for her queer
poor people near her and the servants and governesses in the house
with her the feeling of importance of herself to herself inside her
and then she had there in her the beginning of the weakening in her
the being lost among her children and her husband living in the
house with her. In the living of Martha Hersland she was a little
one in the ten acre place and she was then living there the
half-city half-country living of the people around her and she went
to school then and she was healthy enough then and happy enough
then and she was always then getting older and getting bigger and
she had some troubles then and always she was of them the people in
the small houses near the ten acre place where she was living then
and she had always the living in her and the being in her I was
describing and sometimes she got a little fatter and sometimes a
little thinner and sometimes she was happy enough and often she was
not so happy and mostly always she was healthy and sometimes she
had uneasy feelings in her and often her father was a trouble to
her and often the governess was troublesome to her and mostly her
mother was not very important for her and she went on and the
family living of the Hersland family was changing some as I was
saying and a little Martha was changing in her as the family living
was changing around her and when it came to her to want her own
education no one was paying much attention to her, each one of the
Hersland family had then themselves inside them to themselves each
one, the father as I was saying and the mother as I was saying and
Alfred Hersland and his brother David as I will be saying in the
history of the two of them. Always a little then Martha had trouble
with each one of them, the family living in the house together, her
father and her mother and her brother Alfred and David the younger
brother but mostly then they none of them were really important to
her, she was all taken up then with the being in her, mostly each
one of them then the family living together were taken up then by
themselves then each one by the being in them and that was the
history of the Hersland family, then when Martha went to college
for more education. This was then the living of the Hersland family
when Martha was having it in her that she was a young woman, this
was the history of all of them then, that they were each one of
them taken up with the being inside of them then, the father Mr.
Hersland with much impatient feeling then in him, the mother with
important being in her from the governess Madeleine Wyman who came
often to see her and from having weakening commencing then in her,
Martha from the having seen the man hit the woman with the umbrella
and so then having in her the need of a college education for her,
the brother Alfred who was then beginning to do things that were
full of interesting feeling for him, the younger brother David who
was beginning then and always from then it went on in him to find
the meaning for him of something in each day of living that would
make living have meaning for him, each one of them then the
Hersland family then were each one of them all taken up with
themselves inside them and this was the history of them as I was
saying when Martha went away from them to get a college education.
Each one of the Hersland family was then each one of them too much
taken up with the being inside themselves then to pay much
attention to another one. Martha went away to college then, as I
was saying, and there she was learning to be like them the young
men and women of her generation and there as I was saying she came
to know Phillip Redfern.</p>

<p>Phillip Redfern was born in a small city and in the south
western part of this country. He was the son of a consciously
ill-assorted pair of parents and his earliest intellectual concept
so in his later living he was always saying as I will soon be
telling, was the realisation of the quality of these two decisive
and unharmonised elements in his child life. He remembered too very
well his first definite realisation of the quality of women when
the inherent contradictions in the claims made for that sex awoke
in him much confused thought. He often said that he had often
puzzled over the fact that he must give up his chair to and be
careful of little girls while at the same time he was taught that
the little girl was quite as strong as he and quite as able to use
liberty and to perfect action. In his later living he said that
when he was a very little one this had been so much a puzzle to
him, little girls then, to him, had everything, he wished then when
he was a little one and this was a puzzle to him, he wished he had
been a little girl so and so have everything.</p>

<p>His mother was his dear dear friend then and from her he
received then all the thoughts and convictions that were definite
and conscious then and for a long time after in him. She was an
eager, impetuous, sensitive creature, full of ideal enthusiasms in
her being, with moments of clear purpose and vigorous thinking but
for the most part was excitably prejudiced and inconsequent in
sensitive enthusiasm and given to accepting and giving and living
sensations and impressions under the conviction that she had them
as carefully thought out theories and principles that were complete
from reasoning. Her constant rebellion against the pressure of her
husband's steady domination found effective expression in the
inspiring training of her son to be the champion of women. It would
be a sublime proof of the justice of all the poetry of living so
she was always thinking for the son of James Redfern to devote the
strength of the father that was soon to be in the son of him to the
winning of liberty, equality, opportunity, beauty, feeling, for all
women.</p>

<p>James Redfern was a man determined to be master always in his
house. He was a man courteous and deferential to all women, he
never came into any vivid relation with any human being. He was
cold and reserved and had a strong calm attacking will in him, and
he was always perfectly right in doing everything. This was always
true of him. He never knew it in him that his wife had a set
purpose in her to make their son any particular thing in living.
Such a thing could never be a real thing to him, such a thing no
woman he could have living in the house with him could have in her,
to him. It could have no meaning such a fantastic notion and then
too she never said it to him. It would not have any meaning
excepting as words if she had ever said it to him. The things that
have no meaning as existing are to every one very many, and that is
always more and more important in understanding the being in men
and women. Often it is very astonishing, it is like seeing
something and some one who always has been walking with you and you
always have been feeling that one was seeing everything with you
and you feel then that they are seeing that thing the way you are
seeing it then and you go sometime with that one to a doctor to
have that one have their eyes examined and then you find that
things you are seeing they cannot see and never have been seeing
and it is very astonishing and everything is different and you know
then that you are seeing, you are writing completely only for one
and that is yourself then and to every other one it is a different
thing and then you remember every one has said that sometime and
you know it then and it is astonishing. You know it then yes but
you do not really know it as a continuous knowing in you for then
in living always you are feeling that some one else is
understanding, feeling seeing something the way you are feeling,
seeing, understanding that thing, and always it is a shock to you
sometime with every one you are ever knowing and many never really
know it of any one that they are feeling, seeing, understanding a
different way from them and this is very very common. As I was
saying it never would come to Mr. James Redfern to be realising
that Mrs. Redfern had a destiny for their son such as being a
champion of women. Such a thing would be a fantastic dream that
could come from sickness in some one and nothing more to him and as
I was saying she never said it to him. Mr. Redfern was very willing
that Mrs. Redfern should be the tender dear friend of their son, he
was too simply certain of the being in himself and in his son to
pay much attention to the emotional influences that Mrs. Redfern
brought to bear on him then when he was a young one. He was simply
certain, that was the being in him, that his son would be a
rational man. Emotional women and romantic children had pleasant
fantastic dreams that were alright for them. He demanded from his
son then obedience and in his presence selfrestraint and for the
rest when Phillip was a man being his father's son would make him
the man all the Redferns had been.</p>

<p>Phillip Redfern when he was a man was to most every one who ever
came to know him a person having in him a strange and incalculable
nature. The strong enthusiasm of emotion of his mother's nature
early awoke in him with the stimulation she was always then giving
to him very much interest to him for the emotional life he could
have in him. The interest for knowledge and domination were in him
equally strong and from the beginning he devoted himself to
meditation and analysis of the emotions he had in him. The constant
spectacle of an armed neutrality between his parents early filled
him with an interest in the nature of marriage and the meaning of
women.</p>

<p>Many children who are always in the society of older men and
women have their elder's feelings in them and these older men and
women in their talking and their feeling if they have very decided
quality in them to give to them the children always with them a
knowledge of life quite out of relation to the reality of the
children's experiencing and sometimes such a one one of such
children while knowing and accepting many facts that his elders
would have listened to in astonished horror from him often will be
really ignorant of the meaning of the simplest things that happen
to every one living which other children have in them as natural
things for them to be knowing then. Phillip Redfern then had in him
then when he was a young one and was living with his mother and his
father as the only people then for him in him, his own living where
there was much knowledge from reading and thinking, wonderful
dreams, keen analysis, much real emotion of sympathising and very
little experiencing of beginning living.</p>

<p>From his father then and from his mother too then, then when he
was a little one Phillip Redfern learned careful and scrupulous
courtesy to women and to himself and to every one he was ever
seeing or feeling or meeting in books or in living or in his
hearing talking or in his dreaming, and from his father then power
of reserve and these were in him without the determined standards
that governed the elder Redfern. Phillip learned his principles
from his mother and these were in her longings and aspirations
rather than reasoned settled purposes and experiencing and they
were real in him though really then he did not believe in them
though then and longer he lived by them.</p>

<p>When Phillip was beginning to be a young man he went to college
as I was saying in my describing the living of Martha Hersland. He
had never been to a school, his learning had been gathered from his
father and largely by himself in reading. Now for the first time in
his living he with his brilliant personality for he had that then
to himself and to every one, keen intellect, ardent desires, moral
aspirations and principles that he knew he could know by analysing
them were not well reasoned principles for him to have in him but
were to him as his mother's being was in him as a dear dear friend
inside him, was to be thrown into familiar relations with young men
and women. The college of which Redfern became a member was the
typical coeducational college of the west, a completely democratic
institution. Mostly no one there was conscious of a grand-father
unless as remembering one as an old man living in the house with
them or as living in another place and being written to sometimes
by them and then having died and that was the end of grand-fathers
to them. No one among them was held responsible for the father they
had unless by some particular notoriety that had come to the father
of some one. It was then a democratic western institution, this
college where Redfern went to have his college education. This
democracy was too simple and genuine to be discussed by any one
then. No one was really interested how any man or woman of them
came by the money that was educating them, whether it came through
several generations of gentlemen to them, whether it came through
two generations or one, whether one of them earned it for herself
or for himself by working, or teaching, or working on a farm or at
book-selling or at anything else that would bring money to them in
the summer or whether they earned a little by being a janitor to a
school building in the winter or had it given them by some one
interested in them. This democracy was then almost complete among
them and was the same between the men and women as between the men,
as between the women. This democracy was really almost complete
among all of them and included very simple comradeship among them
all, all of the men and women there together then. The men mostly
were simple, direct and earnest in their relations with the women
there being educated with them, the men, most of them treating them
with generosity and kindliness enough and never really doubting
even for a moment their right to any learning or occupation the
women, any of them were able to acquire then. The students were
many of them earnest experienced men and women who had already
struggled solidly with poverty and education. Many of them were
interested in the sciences and the practical application of them
but also there was among them a kind of feeling and yearning for
beauty and this then often showed itself in them in much out of
door wandering, and was beginning a little with some of them to
realise itself in attempting making pictures and sculpture. It was
of such a sober minded, earnest, moral, democratic community that
Redfern was now become a part. His moral aspirations found full
satisfaction in the serious life of the place and his interest in
emotional enthusiasm found a new and delightful exercise in the
problem of woman that presented itself so strangely here. At this
time the return to honest nature to him, was complete delight in
him for elaboration was then not so necessary in his conviction but
that vigor and force unadorned then made him forgetful of subtlety
and refinement. The free simple comradeship of the men and women at
first filled him with astonishment and then with delight. He could
not feel himself a part of it, he could not love the sense of
danger in the presence and companionship of women, his instincts
bade him be on guard but his ideal he felt to be here realised.</p>

<p>Among the many vigorous young women in the place there was
Martha Hersland. She was a blond good-looking young woman full of
moral purpose and educational desires. She had an eager earnest
intelligence, fixed convictions and principles by then, and
restless energy. She and Redfern were students in the same studies
in the same class and soon singled themselves out from the crowd,
it was all new, strange and dangerous for the south-western man and
all perfectly simple and matter of course for the western girl.
They had long talks on the meanings of things, he discoursing of
his life and aims, she listening, understanding and sympathising.
This intercourse steadily grew more constant and familiar.
Redfern's instincts were dangerous was always there as a conviction
in him, his ideals simple and pure was almost always real inside
him, slowly he realised in this constant companion the existence of
instincts as simple and pure as his ideals.</p>

<p>They were going through the country one wintry day, plunging
vigorously through the snow and liking the cold air and rapid
walking and excited with their own health and their youth and the
freedom. "You are a comrade and a woman," he cried out in his
pleasure, "It is the new world."</p>

<p>"Surely, there is no difference our being together only it is
pleasanter and we go faster," was her eager answer.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Redfern, "I know it, it is the new world."</p>

<p>This comradeship continued through the three years. They spent
much time in explaining to each other what neither quite
understood. He never quite felt the reality of her simple
convictions, she never quite realised what it was he did not
understand.</p>

<p>One spring day a boy friend came to see her a younger brother of
John Davidson who used to play duets with her and all three went
out in the country. It was a soft warm day, the ground was warm and
wet and they were healthy and they did not mind that. They found a
fairly dry hill-side and sat down all three too indolent to wander
further. The young fellow, a boy of eighteen, threw himself on the
ground and rested his head on Martha Hersland's lap. Redfern did
not stop a start of surprise and Martha Hersland smiled. The next
day Redfern frankly came to her with his perplexity.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," he said. "Was it alright for Davidson to
do so yesterday. I almost believed it was my duty to knock him
off."</p>

<p>"Yes I saw you were surprised," she said and she looked uneasy
and then she resolutely tried to make him see. "Do you know that to
me a western woman it seems very strange that any one should see
any wrong in his action. Yes I will say it, I have never understood
before why you always seemed on guard."</p>

<p>She ended pretty steadily, he flushed and looked uneasy. He
looked at her earnestly, whatever was there, he certainly could not
doubt her honesty. It could not be a new form of deliberate
enticement even though it made a new danger.</p>

<p>After two years of marriage Redfern's realisation of her was
almost complete. Martha was all that she had promised him to be,
all that he had thought her, but that all proved sufficiently
inadequate to his needs. She was moral, strenuous and pure and
sought earnestly after higher things in life and art but her mind
was narrow and in its way insistent, her intelligence quick but
without grace and harsh and Redfern loved a gentle intelligence.
Redfern was a hard man to hold, he had no tender fibre to make him
gentle to discordant suffering and when once he was certain that
this woman had no message for him there was no way in which she
could make to him an appeal. Her narrow eager mind was
helpless.</p>

<p>It was part of his elaborate chivalry and she though harsh and
crude should never cease to receive from him this respect. He knew
she must suffer but what could he do. They were man and wife, their
minds and natures were separated by great gulfs, it must be again
an armed neutrality but this time it was not as with his parents an
armed neutrality between equals but with an inferior who could not
learn the rules of the game. It was just so much the more
unhappy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Redfern never understood what had happened to her. In a
dazed blind way she tried all ways of breaking through the walls
that confined her. She threw herself against them with impatient
energy and again she tried to destroy them piece by piece. She was
always thrown back bruised and dazed and never quite certain whence
came the blow, how it was dealt or why. It was a long agony, she
never became wiser or more indifferent, she struggled on always in
the same dazed eager way. Such was the relation between Redfern and
his wife when Redfern having made some reputation for himself in
philosophy was called to Farnham college to fill the chair of
philosophy there. There was then a dean presiding over the college
of Farnham who in common with many of her generation believed
wholly in the essential sameness of sex and who had devoted her
life to the development of this doctrine. The Dean of Farnham had
had great influence in the lives of many women. She was possessed
of a strong purpose and vast energy. She had an extraordinary
instinct for the qualities of men and rarely failed to choose the
best of the young teachers as they came from the universities. She
rarely kept them many years for either they attained such
distinction that the great universities claimed them or they were
dismissed as not being able enough to be called away. Phillip
Redfern had taken his doctor's degree in philosophy, had married
and presently then he came to hold the chair of philosophy at
Farnham college. Two very interesting personalities in the place
were the dean Miss Charles and her friend Miss Dounor.</p>

<p>Redfern had previously had no experience of women's colleges, he
knew some thing of the character of the dean but had heard nothing
of any other member of the institution and went to make his bow to
his fellow instructors in some wonder of anticipation and
excitement of mind. The new professor of philosophy was invited by
the dean to meet the assembled faculty at a tea at her house two
days after his arrival in the place. He entered alone and was met
by the dean who was then just about beginning the ending of her
middle living. She was a dignified figure with a noble head and a
preoccupied abrupt manner. She was a member of a family which was
proud of having had in three successive generations three
remarkable women.</p>

<p>The first of these three was not known beyond her own community
among whom she had great influence by reason of her strength of
will, her powerful intellect, her strong common sense and her deep
religious feeling. She carried to its utmost the then woman's life
with its keen worldly sense, its power of emotion and prayer and
its devout practical morality.</p>

<p>The daughter of this vigorous woman was known to a wider circle
and sought for truth in all varieties of ecstatic experience. She
mingled with her genuine mystic exaltation a basal common sense and
though spending the greater part of her life in examining and
actively taking part in all the exaggerated religious enthusiasms
of her time she never lost her sense of criticism and judgement and
though convinced again and again of the folly and hypocrisy of
successive saints never doubted the validity of mystic religious
experience.</p>

<p>In the third generation the niece of this woman, the dean Hannah
Charles, found her expression in still wider experience. She did
not expect her regeneration from religious experience and found her
exaltation in resisting.</p>

<p>Through her influence she was enabled to keep the college in a
flourishing state and to keep the control of all things entirely in
her own hands but she was anxious that in the teaching staff there
should be some one who would be permanent, who would have great
parts and a scholarly mind and would have no influence to trouble
hers and before many years she found Miss Dounor who ideally
fulfilled these conditions.</p>

<p>Miss Douner was a graduate of an eastern college and had made
some reputation. She was utterly unattached, being an only child
whose parents died just before she entered college and was equally
detached by her nature from all affairs of the world and was always
quite content to remain where she was so long as some took from her
all management of practical affairs and left her in peace with her
work and her dreams. She was possessed of a sort of transfigured
innocence which made a deep impression on the vigorous practical
mind of Miss Charles who while keeping her completely under her
control was nevertheless in awe of her blindness of worldly things
and of the intellectual power of her clear sensitive mind.</p>

<p>Though Miss Dounor was detached by the quality of her nature
from worldly affairs it was not because she loved best dreams and
abstract thought, for her deepest interest was in the varieties of
human experience and her constant desire was to partake of all
human relations but by some quality of her nature she never
succeeded in really touching any human creature she knew. Her
transfigured innocence, too, was not an ignorance of the facts of
life nor a puritan's instinct indeed her desire was to experience
the extreme forms of sensuous life and to make even immoral
experiences her own. Her detachment was due to an abstracted spirit
that could not do what it would and which was evident in her
reserved body, her shy eyes and gentle face.</p>

<p>As I was saying Phillip Redfern had been invited by the dean to
meet the assembled faculty at a tea at her house. He entered in
some wonder of anticipation and excitement of mind and was met by
the dean Miss Charles.</p>

<p>"You must meet Miss Dounor," she said to him breaking abruptly
through the politeness of the new instructor who was as I said
south-western.</p>

<p>Redfern looked with interest at this new presentment of
gentleness and intelligence who greeted him with awkward shyness.
Her talk was serious pleasant and intense, her point of view clear,
her arguments just, and her opinions sensitive. Her
self-consciousness disappeared during this eager discussion but her
manner did not lose its awkward restraint, her voice its gentleness
or her eyes their shyness.</p>

<p>While the two were still in the height of the discussion there
came up to them a blond, eager, goodlooking young woman whom
Redfern observing presented as his wife to his new acquaintance.
Miss Dounor checked in her talk was thrown into even more than her
original shy awkwardness and looking with distress at this new
arrival after several efforts to bring her mind to understand said;
"Mrs. Redfern yes yes, of course, your wife I had forgotten." She
made another attempt to begin to speak and then suddenly giving it
up gazed at them quite helpless.</p>

<p>"Pray go on as I am very anxious to hear what you think," said
Mrs. Redfern nervously and Redfern bowing to his wife turned again
to Miss Dounor and went on with the talk. An observer would have
found it difficult to tell from the mere appearance of these three
what their relation toward each other was. Miss Dounor was absorbed
in her talk and thought and oblivious of everything except the
discussion, her shy eyes fixed on Redfern's face and her tall
constrained body filled with eagerness, Redfern was listening and
answering showing the same degree of courteous deference to both
his companions, turned first toward one and then toward the other
one with impartial attention and Mrs. Redfern her blond
good-looking face filled with eager anxiety to understand listened
to one and then the other with the same anxious care.</p>

<p>Later Redfern wandered to a window where Miss Hannah Charles,
Miss Dounor and Mrs. Redfern were standing looking out at a fine
prospect of sunset and a long line of elms defining a road that led
back through the town of Farnham to the wooded hills behind.
Redfern stood with them looking out at the scene. Mrs. Redfern was
listening intently to each one's thinking. "Ah of course you know
Greek," she said with eager admiration to Miss Dounor who made no
reply.</p>

<p>It happens often about the twenty-ninth year of a life that all
the forces that have been engaged through the years of childhood,
adolescence and youth in confused and sometimes angry combat range
themselves in ordered ranks, one is uncertain of one's aims,
meaning and power during these years of tumultuous growth when
aspiration has no relation to fulfillment and one plunges here and
there with energy and misdirection during the strain and stress of
the making of a personality until at last we reach the twenty-ninth
year, the straight and narrow gateway of maturity and life which
was all uproar and confusion narrows down to form and purpose and
we exchange a dim possibility for a big or small reality.</p>

<p>Also in our American life where there is no coercion in custom
and it is our right to change our vocation as often as we have
desire and opportunity, it is a common experience that our youth
extends through the whole first twenty-nine years of our life and
it is not till we reach thirty that we find at last that vocation
for which we feel ourselves fit and to which we willingly devote
continued labor. It must be owned that while much labor is lost to
the world in these efforts to secure one's true vocation,
nevertheless it makes more completeness in individual life and
perhaps in the end will prove as useful to the world, and if we
believe that there is more meaning in the choice of love than plain
propinquity so we may well believe that there is more meaning in
vocations than that it is the thing we can first learn about and
win an income with.</p>

<p>Redfern had now come to this fateful twenty-ninth year. He had
been a public preacher for women's rights, he had been a
mathematician, a psychologist and a philosopher, he had married and
earned a living and yet the world was to him without worth or
meaning and he longed for a more vital human life than to be an
instructor of youth, his theme was humanity, his desire was to be
in the great world and of it, he wished for active life among his
equals not to pass his days as a guide to the immature and he
preferred the criticism of life in fiction to the analysis of the
mind in philosophy and now the time was come in this his
twenty-ninth year for the decisive influence in his career. Cora
Dounor had on her side too her ideals which in this world she had
not found complete. She too longed for the real world while wrapped
away from it by the perverse reserve of her mind and the awkward
shyness of her body. Such friendship as she had yet realised she
felt for the dean Miss Hannah Charles but it was not a nearness of
affection, it was a recognition of the power of doing and working,
and a deference to the representative of effective action and the
habitual dependence of years of protection. What ever Miss Charles
advised or undertook seemed always to Miss Dounor the best that
could be done or affected. She sustained her end of the relation in
being a learned mind, a brilliant teacher and a docile subject. She
pursued her way expounding philosophy, imbibing beauty, desiring
life, never questioning the things nearest her, interested only in
abstract ideas and concrete desire and all her life was arranged to
leave her untouched and unattached but in this shy abstracted,
learned creature there was a desire for sordid life and the common
lot.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see the slow growth of interest to
admiration and then to love in this awkward reserved woman,
unconscious of her meanings and the world's attention and who made
no attempt to disguise or conceal the strength of her feeling.</p>

<p>Redfern's life experience had been to learn that where there was
woman there was for him danger not through his own affections but
by the demand that this sex made upon him. By this extreme chivalry
he was always bound to more than fulfill the expectations he gave
rise to in the mind of his companion. Indeed this man loved the
problem of woman so much that he willingly endured all pain to seek
and find the ideal that filled him with such deep unrest and he
never tired of meeting and knowing and devoting himself to any
woman who promised to fulfill for him his desire and here in Cora
Dounor he had found a spirit so delicate so free so gentle and
intelligent that no severity of suffering could deter him from
seeking the exquisite knowledge that this companionship could give
him. And he knew that she too would willingly pay high for the
fresh vision that he brought her. It is the French habit in
thinking to consider that in the grouping of two and an extra it is
the two that get something from it all who are of importance and
whose claim should be considered; the American mind accustomed to
waste happiness and be reckless of joy finds morality more
important than ecstasy and the lonely extra of more value than the
happy two. To our new world feeling the sadness of pain has more
dignity than the beauty of joy. It takes time to learn the value of
happiness. Truly a single moment snatched out of a distracted
existence is hardly worth the trouble it takes to seize it and to
obtain such it is wasteful to inflict pain, it is only the
cultivators of leisure who have time to feel the gentle approach
the slow rise, the deep ecstasy and the full flow of joy and for
these pain is of little value, a thing not to be remembered, and it
is only the lack of joy that counts. Martha Redfern eager, anxious
and moral had little understanding of the sanctity of joy and
hardly a realisation of the misery of pain. She understood little
now what it was that had come upon her and she tried to arrange and
explain it by her western morality and her new world humanity. She
could not escape the knowledge that something stronger than
community of interest bound her husband and Miss Dounor together.
She tried resolutely to interpret it all in terms of comradeship
and great equality of intellectual interests never admitting to
herself for a moment the conception of a possible marital
disloyalty. But in spite of these standards and convictions she was
filled with a vague uneasiness that had a different meaning than
the habitual struggle against the hard wall of courtesy that
Redfern had erected before her.</p>

<p>This struggle in her mind showed itself clearly when she was in
the company of her husband and Miss Dounor. She would sit
conscientiously bending her mind to her self-imposed task of
understanding and development, when in the immediate circle of
talkers that included her husband and Miss Dounor she gave anxious
and impartial attention to the words of one and the other
occasionally joining in the talk by an earnest inquiry and
receiving always from Redfern the courteous deference that he
extended to every one, to everything, to all women. She listened
with admiring attention particularly to Miss Dounor who genuinely
unconscious of all this nervous misery paid her in return scant
attention. When she was not in the immediate group of talkers with
these two she kept her attention on the person with whom she was
talking and showed the burden of her feeling only in the anxious
care with which she listened and talked.</p>

<p>She was not to be left much longer to work out her own
conclusions. One afternoon in the late fall in the second year of
their life at Farnham, Miss Charles came to the room where she was
sitting alone and in her abrupt way spoke directly of the object of
her visit. "Mrs. Redfern," she began "you probably know something
of the gossip that is at present going on, I want you to keep Mr.
Redfern in order, I cannot allow him to make Miss Dounor the
subject of scandalous talk." She stopped and looked steadily at the
uneasy woman who was dazed by this sudden statement of her own
suspicion, "I, I don't understand," she stammered. "I think you
understand quite well. I depend upon you to speak to him about it,"
and with this the dean departed.</p>

<p>This action on Miss Charles part showed her wisdom. She knew
very well the small power that Mrs. Redfern had over her husband
and she took this method of attack only because it was the only one
open to her. Mrs. Redfern could not accomplish anything by any
action but she was a woman and jealous and there was little doubt,
so the dean thought, that before long she would effect some change.
Martha Redfern's mind was now in a confusion. Miss Charles had
added nothing to her facts nevertheless her statement had made a
certainty of what Mrs. Redfern had resolutely regarded as an
impossibility. She sat there long and long thinking over again and
again the same weary round of thoughts and terrors. She knew she
was powerless to change him, she could only try to get the evidence
to condemn him. Did she want it, if she had it she must act on it,
she dreaded to obtain it and could not longer exist without it. She
must watch him and find it all out without questioning, must learn
it by seeing and hearing and she felt dimly a terror of the things
she might be caught doing to obtain it, she dreaded the
condemnation of Redfern's chivalrous honor. She did not doubt his
disloyalty she was convinced of that and she still feared to lose
his respect for her sense of honor. "He is dishonorable, all his
action is deceit," she said to herself again and again but she
found no comfort in this thought, she knew there was a difference
and that she respected his standard more than her own
justification.</p>

<p>In the long weary days that followed she was torn by these
desires, she must watch him always and secretly, she must gain the
knowledge she dreaded to possess and she must be deeply ashamed of
the ways she must pursue. She was no longer able to listen to
others when her husband and Miss Dounor were in her presence, she
dared not keep an open watch but her observation was unceasing.
Redfern was not wholly unconscious of this change in his wife's
manner perhaps more in the relief that she ceased her eager efforts
to please him than in the annoyance of her suspicious watching.
Redfern was a man too much on guard to fear surprise and with all
his experience too ignorant of women's ways to see danger where
danger really lay.</p>

<p>It was the end of May and one late afternoon Mrs. Redfern filled
with her sad past and sadder future, sat in her room watching the
young leaves shining brilliantly in the warm sunshine on the long
row of elms that stretched away through the village toward the
green hills that rose beyond. Mrs. Redfern knew very well the feel
of that earth warm with young life and wet with spring rains, knew
it as part of her dreary life that seemed to have lasted always. As
she sat there in sadness, the restless eagerness of her blond
good-looking face was gone and her hands lay clasped quietly
without straining, time and sadness had become stronger in her than
desire.</p>

<p>Redfern came into the house and passed into his own study. He
remained there a short while and then was called away. As soon as
he was out of sight Mrs. Redfern arose and went into his room. She
walked up to his desk and opening his portfolio saw a letter in his
writing. She scarcely hesitated so eager was she to read it. She
read it to the end, she had her evidence.</p>

<p>Categories that once to some one had real meaning can later to
that same one be all empty. It is queer that words that meant
something in our thinking and our feeling can later come to have in
them in us not at all any meaning. This is happening always to
every one really feeling meaning in words they are saying. This is
happening very often to almost every one having any realisation in
them in their feeling, in their thinking, in their imagining of the
words they are always using. This is common then to many having in
them any real realisation of the meaning of the words they are
using. As I was saying categories that once to some one had real
meaning come later to that same one not to have any meaning at all
then for that one. Sometimes one reads a letter that they have been
keeping with other letters, and one is not very old then and so it
is not that they are old then and forgetting, they are not very old
then and they come in cleaning something to reading this letter and
it is all full of hot feeling and the one, reading the letter then,
has not in them any memory of the person who once wrote that letter
to them. This is different, very different from the changing of the
feeling and the thinking in many who have in them real realisation
of the meaning of words when they are using them but there is in
each case so complete a changing of experiencing in feeling and
thinking, or in time or in something, that something, some one once
alive to some one is then completely a stranger to that one, the
meaning in a word to that one the meaning in a way of feeling and
thinking that is a category to some one, some one whom some one was
knowing, these then come to be all lost to that one sometime later
in the living of that one.</p>

<p>This is very true then, this is very true then of the feeling
and the thinking that makes the meaning in the words one is using,
this is very true then that to many of them having in them strongly
a sense of realising the meaning of the words they are using that
some words they once were using, later have not any meaning and
some then have a little shame in them when they are copying an old
piece of writing where they were using words that sometime had real
meaning for them and now have not any real meaning in them to the
feeling and the thinking and the imagining of such a one. Often
this is in me in my feeling, often then I have to lose words I have
once been using, now I commence again with words that have meaning,
a little perhaps I had forgotten when it came to copying the
meaning in some of the words I have just been writing. Now to begin
again with what I know of the being in Phillip Redfern, now to
begin again a description of Phillip Redfern and always now I will
be using words having in my feeling, thinking, imagining very real
meaning. As I was saying Phillip Redfern was to very many who knew
him a queer one, he was to very many who knew him a bad one, he was
to some who knew him so good a one that he was almost a real saint
for them. This was true of him then and now I will begin a little
more description of the kind of being in him, of the kind of being
he had in living, of the many millions men and women always being
like him.</p>

<p>He was of the kind of men and women who, in the end, to every
one, have been as if they had been a failure. They are many of
them, many of this kind of them, many of the kind of which Redfern
was one, that have had very much reputation, have been well known
for their living, for the being in them, in their living very many
of this kind of them. These see themselves, always have, do and
will see themselves all their living as virtuous, as heroic, as
noble, as successful, as beautiful, as whatever is the best way of
being to them, see themselves so through the weakness as well as
through the strong things in them. Many men and many women see
themselves as virtuous always in their living, this is a little now
very interesting.</p>

<p>Many then have it in them that their weakness is a virtue in
them. There are very many of this kind of them then. Johnson when
he forgets his emotion, the emotion he had when he was friendly or
loving or fighting, Johnson when he forgets his emotion and
declares it to have been all the other one's doing attributes his
having yielded to this indulging in loving, fighting, friendly
action, to the weakness in him of always yielding. This weakness of
his is uppermost in him and to himself, having forgotten that he
had been himself wanting the thing he had once, later in
describing, feeling of thinking the action over he says it was
because he has the weakness of never being able to resist any one
who wants anything. Perhaps Johnson began but later he forgets his
having been wanting the thing, he remembers only that always he
does anything anybody wants him to be doing, that is the weakness
in him that is to him the whole principle of the being in him.
Frank Hackart attributes his doing anything to the philanthropy in
him, she was lonesome and threw herself on him, took possession and
what did he do but take care of her. This later in telling, in
remembering, in feeling is always the history of any woman and him.
Mary Helbing always puts it down to, that they wanted it and she
gave it but she had no responsibility, it was because she was so
game that she did it, that is always the reason she does it, she is
so game she never refuses anything that is a challenge, there is
never anything that she is ever wanting in her living that she is
ever getting. Sarah Sands puts her yielding down to
unsuspiciousness, that is the reason she yields, she is so easy,
that is the secret of it. Phillip Redfern was of this kind of them,
he was to himself completely chivalrous, completely a gentleman,
women, every one should always have complete courtesy always from
him. And they are right all of them, all these things, each thing
in each one, are characteristics in each one but they all think
that one characteristic is the whole of them, they all of them
forget the other things in them that are active in them, they all
have it in common that in remembering anything they forget all the
emotion they had then in them and so it must have been the other
person's fault it happened, anything. All of them in remembering
have not had any emotion except the one and so they had none then
and so it must have been the other person. This is a little now
very interesting.</p>

<p>As I was saying Phillip Redfern was of this kind in men and
women.</p>

<p>There will be now more description of virtuous being, virtuous
feeling in men and women. There will be now some description of
religious feeling in some men and women, of virtuous and religious
feeling in them, of the being in them, of the sensitiveness in
them, of the worldly feeling in them, of succeeding and failing in
them. First then there will be more description of the kind of
being in some men, men like Phillip Redfern, of religious, virtuous
feeling in some men.</p>

<p>As I was saying some of the things all men have in them in their
daily living have it to come in more men, only from the bottom
nature in them than other things in them. Nothing of all the things
all men have in them in their daily living comes in all men from
the bottom nature of them. Eating, drinking, loving, anger in them,
beginning and ending in them come more from many men from the
bottom nature of most of them than other things in them but always
there are many men of all the millions of each kind of them who
have it in them not to have even eating and drinking and doctoring
and living and anger in them and beginning and ending in them come
from the bottom nature of them. Men in their living have many
things inside them, they have in them, each one of them has it in
him, his own way of feeling himself important inside in him, they
have in them all of them their own way of beginning, their own way
of ending, their own way of working, their own way of having loving
inside them and loving coming out from them, their own way of
having anger inside them and letting their anger come out from
inside them, their own way of eating their own way of drinking,
their own way of sleeping, their own way of doctoring. They have
each one of them their own way of fighting they have in them all of
them their own way of having fear in them. They have all of them in
them their own way of believing, their own way of being important
inside them their own way of showing to others around them the
important feeling inside in them.</p>

<p>Mostly every one has some kind of way of conceiving of
themselves as a strong one, as a weak one, as a good one, as a bad
one, as a virtuous, as an honorable one, as a religious, as an
irreligious, as an unreligious one.</p>

<p>Mostly every one has some kind of way of conceiving of
themselves, as a strong one, as a weak one, as a good one, as a bad
one, as a virtuous one, as an honorable one, as a religious one, as
an irreligious one, as an unreligious one.</p>

<p>Some as I am saying have honor in them and religion from the
nature of them when this is strong enough in them to make it their
own inside them. Some can make their own honor, some their own
living, some their own religion, some are weak and can do one
thing, make one thing their own, some are strong enough and all of
it, loving, honor, and religion in them, all of it is some one
else's, of some one else's making, some can just resist and not
make their own anything, there are many of them. Some out of their
own virtue make a god who sometimes later is a terror to them. Out
of their own virtue they make a god who sometimes later is a terror
to them. Some make some things like laws out of the nature of them,
out of the nature of some other one. Some are controlled by other
people's virtue, and then it scares them. Listen to each one
telling about their own virtue and that grows to make a god for
them, grows to be a law for them and often afterwards scares them,
some afterwards like it, some forget it, some are it. Some honor
what is right to them for them to be doing. Some separate honor
from the doing of the thing, have it as a feeling.</p>

<p>Some love themselves enough to not want to lose themselves,
immortality can to them mean nothing but this thing. Some love
themselves negatively, then impersonal future life is for them
alright, a good enough thing. Some love themselves and others so
hard that they are sure that they will exist even when they won't,
they do to themselves exist even when they don't, these have a
future life feeling, an individual thing, some love themselves and
they are it and that is all there is of it in them and they do not
have future life in them to be an important thing. Men and women
have being in them all of them when they are living. Many men and
women have in them a feeling of future life in them, very many of
them, some for this life, some for another life, some for both
lives, this and another one, some have a stronger, some have a
weaker feeling of themselves inside them, some have more, some have
less loving in them for themselves than other ones have in them,
some have more some have less loving in them for other ones than
others have in them, some have more some have less feeling for some
thing than other ones have in them and all these things in each one
are part in them of the virtuous feeling, of the religious feeling
they have in them each one, each man and woman, each one having man
or woman being in them, each man or woman has some being in her or
in him.</p>

<p>There are some who have not any feeling of virtue in them. There
are not very many of them. There are perhaps some millions of them.
Mostly every one as I am saying has in her or in him some kind of
feeling of being of virtue in living. Some from the things they
feel as weakness in them, some from the things they feel as
strength in them. Phillip Redfern had it in him to make a virtue
for him of a thing he felt as a weakness in him. There are very
many of this kind of them, many, very many men, many women.</p>

<p>Mostly all of this kind of men and women have some kind of
religion in them. This is now a little a discussion of the being in
some of them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Phillip Redfern was of the kind of men and
women, and there are always many men of this kind of them and some
women of this kind of them, who have in their living a good deal of
reputation from the living and the being in them and then they are
not successful in living successful in the whole of their living
and to many knowing them they are romantic in their living, or
beautiful, or dramatic in their living and to some, saints in
living, and Redfern was such a one and to most every one he was a
man always failing in his living, and to Miss Dounor he was a saint
among men and to Mrs. Redfern he was wonderful in the honorable
courtesy in him and mostly every one sometime thought he was a bad
man and mostly to every one he was a man given to lying. He said
once of some one, "Lathrop tells a lie as if it were the truth and
I tell the truth as if it were a lie." He was to himself a man
simple, sensuous and passionate and that was to himself the whole
of him. As I was saying his weakness was to himself the strength in
him and so always all his living to every one who ever came to
know, excepting to some to whom he was a saint in suffering, to
every one mostly he was failing from the weaknesses there were in
him. To himself as I was saying he was a simple, sensuous,
passionate being from whom chivalry demanded he should be always
yielding when he himself was not active in feeling. He was a man
always on guard, with every one always able to pierce him. That was
the living he had in him.</p>

<p>For the rest of his days he was a literary man and sometimes a
politician. He plunged deeply into the political life of his time
and failed everywhere, in this life as in all of his human
relations his instincts gave the lie to his ideals and his ideals
to his instincts. It was interesting to many to witness the life of
this man, to see him go up again and again, against the yielding
spirit in him, go up with unwearied courage only to meet with
certain defeat. He was himself the only one of all the lookers on
who dreamed of victory. The others whether watching with
indifference, with deep sympathy or stern condemnation, with
malicious or righteous triumph knew that he would fail, but he
always struggled on filled to the very end with hope and courage,
always defeated and always ready to make the fresh assault.</p>

<p>As I was saying there was a Johnson who had made some reputation
in his living, by the living that was romantic to every one
knowing, by the being in him and always he was certain in telling,
feeling, and thinking that everything that had happened to him when
as was the way in him, he was finished with that thing, that it was
because he was weak and open to any suggesting and that made, it
happen that he was in a relation and he had the right to get out in
any way he wanted for that was the right he had to defend himself
when every one had him where they wanted to have him because he was
so weak to every one's suggesting. He would brag of things he had
done when he was filled up with them and always he was filled up
with them and he would know he had a right to run away or do
anything to defend himself for every one could hold him by
suggesting to him by the sensitive suggestibility in him and this
was his great weakness in him and he made of it the principle of
his living to himself in his talking, thinking, feeling, and he was
of the kind of them and perhaps Lord Byron and Oscar Wilde were of
this kind of them, he was of them who become romantic, heroic,
beautiful, saintly by the weakness in them that is there always
acting, that is true of them, but always these are doing things and
boasting of them in their active living. There are very many of
such of them. Redfern was such a one. A Johnson I was describing
was such a one. Some have only this a little in them enough to make
them very sentimental in their living, some have it a little more
in them than those having it just as sentimental being in them and
some of such of them are men's men and some of such of them are
women's men. And Hackart that I was just describing was one of such
of them. Some have it just a little more in them than the
sentimental ones and they are dramatic in their living and there
are very many women and there are very many men who have this being
in them and a Sarah Sands was such a one as I was just saying.
There are some who have this way of being only in spots in them.
There are many such of them, many women and many men of such of
them.</p>

<p>As I was saying such a one as the Johnson I have been just
describing, when he forgets his emotion that made him do a thing,
always declares it to have been all the other one's doing,
attributes his having yielded to his own weakness of being very
susceptible to suggesting that being the thing in him uppermost in
him to make a principle continuous in him of living. This is all
different from selfrighteousness which is a way of being that
everything in one is right and should be so considered by every
one, self-righteousness is believing that the one acting is so
right that if every one acted like them everything would be right
in living and every one would be a good one. This is a very
different thing from the feeling that I am describing. These that I
am describing make a principle to free them, from the weakness in
them. It is a weakness, they are always saying it of them, one that
he is too susceptible to suggesting, another that when a woman
needs protecting of course he must give her that because she is a
weak thing and he is always weak in yielding protection to a weak
woman, another because she is so unobserving that she has no
realisation of what anybody is doing though maybe it is her vanity
that keeps her from really seeing. All these things are true as
characteristics in each one of them that make a principle of them,
these things are in each one of them, that is quite true of them
but they all think that characteristic is the whole of them and so
they have not to themselves the responsibility of the condition.
Some are noble in it, some are not, but all of them are sure of it,
for that is the principle of their being, to each one of them In
short, they all, each one of this kind of them forget their emotion
they had in the thing they were doing, and so to themselves after,
it must have been the other person's fault that it happened, this
thing, and these then after have no emotion of this thing, unless
they are living it again in imagining and then they are the same as
when they had it really in them, always else they have not the
emotion, it is the other person's fault the thing happened between
them, these have no emotion that they are remembering except the
kind of weakness they know always to be in them each one and so
they had no emotion then, they knew that well in them, and so it
must have been their weakness and the other person's willing them
that made them have this thing in them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Phillip Redfern was such a one. As I was saying
all this is very interesting in the meaning of virtue and religion
that such a one has in them. This kind of being can be in them
having independent dependent or dependent independent being in
them, having any kind of being in them. Johnson when he forgets his
emotion and declares it to have been all the other one's doing,
attributes his having yielded to his own weakness, that being the
thing in him to him uppermost in him. Frank Hackart attributes his
to philanthropy, she was lonesome and threw herself on him, took
possession, and what did he do but take care of her. Melanctha put
it down to that they wanted it and she gave it but she had no
responsibility, it was because she was so game that she did it.
Sarah Sands puts her yielding down to unsuspiciousness, that is the
reason she yields, she is so easy and that's it. All these things
are true as characteristics in each one but they all think that
characteristic is the whole of them. It isn't. They all forget
their emotion and so it must have been the other person's fault it
happened and they have now no emotion and so they had none and so
it must have been the other person's.</p>

<p>Phillip Redfern as I was saying was of this kind in men and
women. He was always on his guard and always a woman could reach
him inside his guard and he must do then what it was right for a
man always on guard to do when he was touched inside the guard. He
must give them their revenge and always again they would touch him.
He must always be elaborately on guard and always he must give them
what they asked of him when they touched him in spite of his
guarding himself from them. This was the way his being worked in
him.</p>

<p>As I was saying many men and some women, many women and some men
of this kind of them make a good deal of reputation in their living
from the living and the being in them. Mostly all of them, at least
very many of them, any way it is not uncommon among them that they
make a failure of the whole of their living, mostly they want to
succeed in winning recognition, mostly they get some from their
living, very many of them are failing in the whole of their living,
often some one thinks one of such of them a saint, a hero, a very
noble person, often very many think such a one to be a very bad
one. Phillip Redfern as I was saying was such a one. There were
very many different ways of feeling the being in him as I am
saying. This has been now a very little description of the being in
him. As I was saying, to the ending of his living he had the same
living in him and as a whole living, his living was failing.</p>

<p>Phillip Redfern then had to himself a feeling of the being in
him that was to him in a way a simple thing. Phillip Redfern was to
Miss Dounor a man of saintly strength and courage and chivalrous
feeling and self-sacrificing. Phillip Redfern was to Mrs. Redfern a
man before whom she wanted to be intelligent, and honorable in
acting and in feeling and delicate, and to be pleasing by knowing
Greek and naive realism. Phillip Redfern was to very many a man who
was always lying. Phillip Redfern was to very many a very brilliant
man gone altogether wrong. Phillip Redfern was to very many a man
always wronging every one. Phillip Redfern was to many a very
brilliant man and a very weak one. Phillip Redfern was to some the
kind of man I have been just describing. This has been now a little
history of him.</p>

<p>Virtue and virtuous feeling in men and women is a very peculiar
thing. More and more there will be a description in this writing of
all the kinds of ways any one can have virtue in them. Now there
will be a very little description of virtue in men and women and
then there will be a little more description of their sensitive
being.</p>

<p>Every one has then their own way of being important inside them
from the things in them each one that are virtues in them to them,
or vices in them to them, or strong things in them, to them, or
weaknesses in them to them. Mostly every one has some kind of way
of having some distinction inside them to themselves to their
feeling and their thinking and their talking. Mostly every one has
some kind of way of feeling some distinction in them, some from the
tastes in them, some from the not having tastes or any way of doing
anything in them, some as I was saying from the strong things in
them, some as I was saying from the weak things in them. Mostly
every one has some way of finding themselves inside them more or
less distinguished, they have this feeling mostly every one, more
or less inside them always in their living. Mostly every one is in
some way a distinguished man or a distinguished woman inside
themselves to themselves from something, from doing, being
something, from not doing or being something, from doing things
like some one, from doing things like every one, from doing things
better or worse than some one, from doing things not so well or
better than almost any one, from doing something and not doing some
other thing, from doing some things and never doing some other
things, there is every kind of thing that can give distinction and
mostly every one has some kind of distinguished feeling in
themselves to themselves inside them. Being virtuous, being
sentimental, being dramatic, being religious, being anything is
interesting in each one having in them that thing that they have in
them. Being distinguished each one inside them by something, to
themselves in their feeling, is very interesting.</p>

<p>Sometime I want to understand every kind of way any one can have
the feeling of being distinguished by the virtue they have in them.
Sometime I want to understand every kind of way any one can have
the feeling of being distinguished in them and every kind of thing
that can give any one a feeling of such distinction in themselves
inside them. Sometime I want to understand the complete being in
each one and all the details of their coming to have in them their
kind of feeling, imagination, thinking, knowing, certainty inside
them, virtuous feeling in them, anything in them that gives to them
inside them the feeling of being distinguished to themselves inside
them. I want to know sometime all about sentimental feeling. I want
to know sometime all the different kinds of ways people have it in
them to be certain of anything. These and virtuous feelings in each
one, of themselves to themselves having virtue inside them, is to
me very interesting. Always more and more I want to know it of each
one what certainty means to them, how they came to be certain of
anything, what certainty means to them and how contradiction does
not worry them and how it does worry them and how much they have in
them of remembering and how much they have in them of forgetting,
and how different any one is from any other one and what any one
and every one means by anything they are saying. All these things
are to me very interesting.</p>

<p>As I was saying virtuous feeling and being certain of anything
is to me very interesting. Having virtuous feeling and any certain
feeling, that is being certain of anything is to me very
interesting in every one. Having certainty in them is in each one,
of the kind of way that their kind of men and women have it of
having it in them. Having certainty in them is a thing very
interesting in each one having a certainty of anything in her or in
him. Certainty and virtuous feeling and religion, these are to me
all three just now very interesting. Shortly I will try to tell a
little of the way some come to have their certainty in them. Some
build certainty up with little and little sure things and make a
pile of them, some are summary and all embracing in the certain
feeling they have always in them, some are certain of almost
anything, some are hardly certain of anything, some have to have a
complete system for each certain feeling in them, some have a sense
of dramatic arrangement to complete the scene of the certain
conviction, the certain emotion they have in them and the complete
scene changes for them with each new certainty they have in them.
Certainty worries some and some never have certainty to be a worry
to them. Some have certainty by comparison, by comparing the thing
they have then with what any other one they are knowing is having,
some never compare anything with any one, certainty is a real thing
in them, in some of such of them as a little pile they are
gradually increasing, in some in something that they keep there
inside them always of the same dimension. Some need company to keep
their certainty from freezing or melting or evaporating or in some
way disappearing. Some need company to keep any certainty in them,
some like company around them while they have their own certainty
inside them, some need to have the certainty in the presence of the
company that they need to have with them. Certainty is certainly
very interesting. I wish I knew all the kinds of certainty all the
kinds of men and women ever existing have in them. Certainty and
virtuous feeling and important feeling in men and in women is to me
just now very very interesting.</p>

<p>As I was saying the kind of certainty, the kind of virtuous
feeling, the kind of important feeling any one has in them comes
from the nature of them, from the kind they are of men and women.
Some men and some women are strong enough to make their own kind of
certain feeling in them, some are weak and can do one thing their
own in the way of a certainty in them, some are strong enough in
living and all of it all the certain feeling in them is some one
else's, some can just resist and not get any one else's certain
feeling and never make any of their own certain feeling to be
inside them, some have everybody's certain feeling in them, some
have a sentimental sense of the beauty and the loveliness and the
truth of certain feeling and it is so lovely and so noble and
everybody is so good and so beautiful and everybody has some
certain feeling and in some such a feeling of certain feeling is a
real thing. There are many ways of being sentimental, sometime
there will be some description of some kinds of ways of being
sentimental. Out of their own certain feeling some make a god who
sometimes later is a terror to them. That is a kind of feeling that
some have about laws of nature as they call them. Many make of
their certain feeling a god which later terrifies them. Some are
controlled by other's certain feeling. To some it is a comfort such
a certain feeling. Some have it that some one else's certain
feeling scares them. Listen to each one telling of the certain
feeling in them. It is very interesting. Some like their own
certain feeling, some later forget it, some later are scared by it,
some later are it. Some love their certain feeling enough never to
want to lose it, some have it when they are not any longer
believing in it, some can completely lose it, some get mixed up
with theirs and other ones and they have very much trouble with all
of it, all the certain feeling they ever come to know in living.
Some love their certain feeling and they never lose it, some love
it and they sometime lose it, some always are looking for it, some
are immortal in themselves by it, some neither have it nor haven't
it, some are to themselves only a part of it. Some love it so hard
that other people have it. Some have it, some never really have it,
some never really own it. Many need company for it, this is very
common. Some need drama to support it, some need lying to help it,
some love it, some hate it, some never are very certain they really
have it. Certain feeling in men and women is very interesting. What
was Phillip Redfern's way with certainty and virtue and distinction
in himself to himself inside him. He was to himself as I was saying
simple, sensuous and passionate. This was not really a description
of him to any other one. This was all he ever said to any one of
the being in him. This was the feeling he had in him of the being
he had in him. He never said it any differently of himself to any
one. He was to himself of the good kind in men and women, he was on
guard because women and other things were dangerous things, he
always felt he would be winning and always he was failing and this
was always happening to him. Always to mostly every one he was
lying. Always he was telling all that it was right for him to tell
to any one. That was the way any man would act, of that he was very
certain. No man would tell more than he should tell if he was the
kind of a man Redfern would speak of as a good one. This was very
certain knowledge in him, in Phillip Redfern. He was certain always
that he was telling all that it was right for him, for any man to
tell to any one. To mostly every one he was a man who was mostly
always lying about himself and about every other one who had any
relation to him. This was true in his living, he was telling all
that it was right he should be telling to any one, every one was
always feeling, always saying that he was mostly always always
lying. To himself it was not a virtue in him that he was never
telling anything more about anything about himself about any one
than it was right that he should be telling, it was to himself
then, this in him, not a virtuous feeling in him, it was a thing it
was natural for him to be doing, never to tell anything, it was not
right that he should say really to any one. He had not then from
this any feeling of virtue in him. He had a feeling of virtue
although it was as he felt it in him a weakness in him that he
always kept himself on guard so that temptation should never come
close to him. This was to him in a way a virtue in him, that he
always was on guard so that no woman, nothing he did not want
should touch him, should come close to him. This was to him a
virtue in him, though it was from the weakness of him that he
needed to be always guarding but it was a weakness of what can any
man do when a demand is made upon him, kind of weakness in him,
that was a weakness that any man who was a man must have in living,
and so he Redfern always being on guard had from that to himself a
virtuous feeling in him, and this then as I am saying is very
common. One man Johnson as I was saying had it that he always ran
away and left the other one to manage any trouble they had made
together and this was a weakness in him, yes, but it was a
consistent thing in him and he needed it for living, and it really
was wisdom in him, this thing and so in a way it was a virtuous
thing in him Some have this kind of virtuous feeling in resisting
always all experiencing. There are many ways as I was saying of
having this kind of virtuous feeling.</p>

<p>As I was saying people having in them any of the kinds of being
I have been describing very often have very much reputation in
their living sometime from the living and the being they have in
them. Very many of them in their living are to some one believing
in them, saints or heroes or beautiful creatures or wonderfully
romantic creatures in their living and are to very many people
knowing them, liars and cowards and bad men and bad women and to
themselves they are men and women having in them a weakness yes and
a virtuous feeling yes and a certain feeling of the real
distinction of the consistent action their weakness entails on
them.</p>

<p>Johnson as I was saying always attributes his having yielded to
be in any situation to his own weakness that being the uppermost
thing in him to him and always then that being the true reason he
is in the situation he is in, to himself then, he has it as the
only right thing for him always to be doing then is escaping and he
always then does run away and leave the other one with the trouble
or the blame of the situation they both were in. Hackart attributes
his troubles, when he has any, and he often has them to the
philanthropy in him, she was lonesome and took possession of him
and what did he do but take care of her and so after all when some
one else needs him, he must leave her for of course he must help
the one that needs him most, that's easy for any one to see and
that is what Hackart is always doing, being a man's man and a
woman's man and philanthropic in his feeling. Another one puts her
yielding to her grit and she has given everything, herself and
everything and then the other one wants more and that is a
ridiculous thing and of course she will not pay any attention to
the clamoring of that other one who has been given everything and
by one who never wants anything from any one. Another put her
yielding down to guilelessness and always believing anything
anybody wants to make her believe and then she gets sick and must
defend herself by attacking and she ought really to learn to attack
the other one before she has suffered by them but this can never
come to her because of the nature in her to be always believing in
every one. Redfern always was on guard, that was his contribution
to defending himself and then some one came close to him and then
he gave that one always all her living everything she ever wanted
from him. He always gave to every one who ever was in any relation
with him completely everything they could ask of him every minute
in his living and to the ending of their or his living. This was a
certain thing in his feeling, he gave every one unceasingly
everything they could possibly demand of him. That was his being
and his living to himself all his living. That was his being and
his living to one or two and these made a great person or a saint
of him to them and to very many he was one who was in a complete
sense a man never trustworthy in anything, never realising his
obligation to any one. This then has been some description of the
being in Phillip Redfern. To the last hour of his living he was
faithful to the certainty of having been faithful to every one who
ever had come to have any claim upon him. To the last hour of his
living he was to himself completely giving himself to any one that
had come to touch him. Always he was guarding himself, always to
the last moment of his living to himself, always to himself to the
last moment of his living he was faithful to everything he owed to
every one and any one.</p>

<p>This is now then a little more description of the being in three
women who had each one their own feeling about him, Miss Dounor,
Miss Charles and his wife Mrs. Redfern. This is now a little more
description of the being each one of the three of them had in them
the being and the completed living of each one of them.</p>

<p>To begin then with Miss Dounor, her feeling and her living and
her feeling Phillip Redfern in her living.</p>

<p>To very many, to, sometimes any one would think, mostly every
one some one's way of loving, some other one's way of loving, some
other one's way of living, some other one's way of keeping
somethings and not other things, of throwing away some things and
not other things, some one's way of buying some things and not
buying other things is a foolish one. Mostly every one finds that
things other ones are wanting are very foolish things for any one
to be wanting, for that one to be wanting, to be buying, to be
keeping. Each one has in him a very certain feeling of things any
one having any sense in them should be wanting to have in living.
It is very hard for mostly every one to understand why another one
has that way of loving, that way of being angry in them that they
have in them. Some try to understand the other one's way of doing
these things but mostly every one finds it very puzzling. What can
any one want with buying, keeping, wanting any such thing each one
says of something some one has been wanting, buying, keeping. This
is very common. Very many could forgive some one anything excepting
the way that one has angry feeling or injured feeling in them. Some
could let anything pass excepting the kind of way some one has of
loving. That gives them an angry feeling, that is all there is
about it to them. It is very very common that some one could
forgive anybody anything excepting the way they have of having
angry or injured feeling in them. This is very very common. Some
can never understand the queer ways in another one. Mr. Hersland
always was saying to his three children that the ways they had in
them were only habits, there was no need they should have these
ways in them. He had ways in him, they were him to him, the ways
his children had in them were habits and it was not at all
necessary that they should have any such habits in them. Many think
that some one, some others could do the work they are doing in some
other way from the way these are doing their working. As I am
saying it is very, very common that some one could forgive some one
anything excepting the way they have angry feeling, or injured
feeling or loving feeling in them. Now then to begin a little
description of the being in some women and the feeling they each
had about the other one and the feeling they each one had about
Redfern. Perhaps no one ever will know the complete history of
every one. This is a sad thing. Perhaps no one will ever have as a
complete thing the history of any one. This is a very sad thing.
Sometime each one will have made a complete history of them in the
repeating always coming out of them. Sometime perhaps some one will
really know it of some one, that will be a very contenting thing to
some. Some seeing a mistake in their copying, say then, oh how can
I ever be certain, perhaps I have made many mistakes I have not
been noticing. This is a sad thing. Some every time they see a
mistake they have been making say, if I almost did not see this one
in reading it again, very likely there are very many I did not see
for I would not have seen this one if I had not been noticing very
carefully when I was seeing this one, and this is a very sad thing.
Some say then, I noticed this one and so always I am noticing all
the mistakes I am ever making and that is very pleasant if any one
can believe what they are hearing from some one, and then some one
says with a mistake they have been noticing, this is certainly the
first mistake I have ever made in copying and that is comforting
too only one can hardly at all believe that one and then some one
says of a copying, I never make any mistake in copying and that is
almost irritating to be hearing for always every one is making
mistakes and that is a very sad thing.</p>

<p>Perhaps no one ever will know the complete history of every one.
This is a sad thing. Perhaps no one will ever have as a complete
thing the history of any one. This is a very sad thing. Surely some
one sometime will have a complete history of some one. All this
gives to some a very despairing feeling. Some one is hearing
something, and they think then, it is only by an accident that I
have heard that thing, I have known that thing, always there are
many things that I am not knowing, that is very certain, every one
always is repeating, that there is not any denying, certainly
sometime some one always paying all attention must know sometime
the history of some one. Perhaps no one ever gets a complete
history of any one. This is very discouraging thinking. I am very
sad now in this feeling. Always, hearing something, gives to some a
sad feeling of realising everything they have not been hearing and
that they are not knowing and perhaps they can never have really in
them the complete history of any one, no one ever can have in them
the complete history of any one and that is then a very melancholy
feeling in them. There is a little comfort to some of such of them
that always every one is repeating the whole of them, that always
every one always is repeating all the being in them and then that
is a little a comfort to such a one and then such a one knows
always how important each repeating in each one is to make a
completer realisation of that one and how each repeating is more
and more a completion of the history of the being of each one and
then such a one knowing how many repeatings out of each one that
one is not hearing has in that one a very dreary feeling. Sadness
is then in that one, sadness and gentle melancholy despairing.
Repeating is in each one, yes, always coming out of them, yes that
is a little a comforting, each repeating is important to be knowing
and that is interesting and that is a sad thing to one wanting to
have in them complete histories of men and women.</p>

<p>Sometimes in listening to a conversation which is very important
to two men, to two women, to two men and women, sometime then it is
a wonderful thing to see how each one always is repeating
everything they are saying and each time in repeating, what each
one is saying has more meaning to each one of them and so they go
on and on and on and on repeating and always to some one listening,
repeating is a very wonderful thing. There are many of them who do
not live in each repeating each repeating coming out of them but
always repeating is interesting. Repeating is what I am loving.
Sometimes there is in me a sad feeling for all the repeating no one
loving repeating is hearing, it is like any beauty that no one is
seeing, it is a lovely thing, always some one should be knowing the
meaning in the repeating always coming out of women and of men, the
repeating of the being in them. So then.</p>

<p>Every one is a brute in her way or his way to some one, every
one has some kind of sensitiveness in them.</p>

<p>Some feel some kinds of things others feel other kinds of
things. Mostly every one feels some kinds of things. The way some
things touch some and do not touch other ones and kinds in men and
women then I will now begin to think a little bit about describing.
To begin then.</p>

<p>I am thinking it is very interesting the relation of the kind of
things that touch men and women with the kind of bottom nature in
them, the kind of being they have in them in every way in them, the
way they react to things which may be different from the way they
feel them.</p>

<p>I am thinking very much of feeling things in men and women. As I
was saying every one is a brute in her way or his way to some one,
every one has some kind of sensitiveness in them. Mostly every one
has some inner way of feeling in them, almost every one has some
way of reacting to stimulus in them. This is not always the same
thing. These things have many complications in them. I am beginning
now a little a description of three women, Miss Dounor, Miss
Charles and Mrs. Redfern. I am beginning now a little a realisation
of the way each one of them is in her way a brute to some one, each
one has in her way a kind of sensitiveness in being. This is now
some description of each one of the three of them Miss Dounor, Miss
Charles and Mrs. Redfern.</p>

<p>In listening to a conversation, as I was saying, repeating of
each one and the gradual rising and falling and rising again of
realisation is very interesting. This is now some description of
the three women and as I was saying of the sensitiveness in each
one of them to somethings and the insensitiveness to other things
and the bottom nature in them and the kinds of repeating in them
and the bottom nature and the other natures mixed with the bottom
nature in each one of them. Sensitiveness to something,
understanding anything, feeling anything, that is very interesting
to understand in each one How much, when and where and how and when
not and where not and how not they are feeling, thinking,
understanding. To begin again then with feeling anything. Mostly
every one is a brute in her way or his way to some one, mostly
every one has some kind of sensitiveness in them.</p>

<p>Mostly every one can have some kind of feeling in them, very
many men and very many women can have some understanding in them of
some kind of thing by the kind of being sensitive to some kind of
impression that they have in them.</p>

<p>Some kinds of men and women have a way of having sensation from
some things and other men and women have it in them to be able to
be impressionable to other kinds of things. Some men and some women
have very much of sensitive being in them for the kind of thing
they can be feeling, they can then be very loving, or very trembly
from the abundant delicate fear in them, or very attacking from the
intensity of the feeling in them, or very mystic in their
absorption of feeling which is then all of them. There are some men
and women having in them very much weakness as the bottom in them
and watery anxious feeling, and sometimes nervous anxious feeling
then in them and sometimes stubborn feeling then in them. There are
some who have vague or vacant being as the bottom in them and it is
very hard to know with such ones of them what feeling they have
ever in them and there are some with almost intermittent being in
them and it is very hard to tell with such of them what kind of
thing gives to them a feeling, what kind of feeling they ever have
really in them. As I was saying mostly every one sometimes feels
something, some one, is understanding something, some one, has some
kind of sensitiveness in them to something, to some one, mostly
every one.</p>

<p>As I was saying some men and some women have very much of
sensitive being in them for something that can give to them real
feeling. They can then, some of these of them, when they are filled
full then of such feeling, they can then be completely loving,
completely believing, they can then have a trembling awed being in
them, they can have then abundant trembly feeling in them, they can
then be so full up then with the feeling in them that they are a
full thing and action has no place then in them, they are
completely then a feeling, there are then men and women, there are
then women and men who have then this finely sensitive completed
feeling that is sometime all them and perhaps Cora Dounor was one
of such of them. Perhaps she was one of them and was such a one in
loving Phillip Redfern. Perhaps that was the whole being she had in
her then.</p>

<p>Each one as I am saying has it in them to feel more or less,
sometime, something, almost certainly each one sometime has some
capacity for more or less feeling something. Some have in them
always and very little feeling, some have some feeling and much
nervous being always in them, some have as a bottom to them very
much weakness and eagerness together then and they have then such
of them some sensitiveness in them to things coming to them but
often after they are then full up with nervous vibrations and then
nothing can really touch them and then they can have in them
nervous vibratory movement in them, anxious feeling in them and
sometimes stubborn feeling then in them and then nothing can touch
them and they are all this being then this nervous
vibratory-quivering and perhaps Mrs. Redfern was such a one Mrs.
Redfern who had been Martha Hersland and was married now to Phillip
Redfern and had come to Farnham and had there seen Phillip Redfern
come to know Miss Dounor and had been then warned to take care of
him by the dean of Farnham Miss Charles. She never knew then, Mrs.
Redfern never knew then that she would not ever again have him,
have Redfern again. This never could come to be real knowledge in
her. She was always then and later always working at something to
have him again and that was there always in her to the end of him
and of her. There will be a little more description of her written
in the history of the ending of the living in her father, in the
history of the later living of her brother Alfred Hersland who now
just when her trouble was commencing was just then marrying Julia
Dehning, in the history of her brother David Hersland her younger
brother. More description of her will be part of the history of the
ending of the existing of the Hersland family. There will be very
much history of this ending of all of them of the Hersland
family&mdash;written later.</p>

<p>The dean Miss Charles was very different from either Miss Douner
or Mrs. Redfern. She had it in her to have her own way of feeling
things touching her, mostly there was in her less reactive than
self-directive action in her than there was in the two women who
were just then concerning her, Miss Dounor and Mrs. Redfern.</p>

<p>It is hard to know it of any one whether they are enjoying
anything, whether they are knowing they arc giving pain to some
one, whether they were planning that thing. It is hard to know such
things in any one when they are telling when they are not telling
to any one what they know inside them. It is hard telling it of any
one whether they are enjoying a thing, whether they know that they
are hurting some one, whether they have been planning the acting
they have been doing. It is hard telling it of any one whether they
are enjoying anything, whether they know that they are hurting any
one, whether they have been planning the acting they are doing. It
is very hard then to know anything of the being in any one, it is
hard then to know the being in many men and in many women, it is
hard then to know the being and the feeling in any man or in any
woman. It is hard to know it if they tell you all they know of it.
It is hard to know it if they do not tell you what they know of it
in it. Miss Cora Dounor then could do some planning, could do some
hurting with it, that is certain. This is perhaps surprising to
some, reading. To begin then with her feeling and her being and her
acting.</p>

<p>As I am saying she had it in her to be compounded of beautiful
sensitive being, of being able to be in a state of being completely
possessed by a wonderful feeling of loving and that was then the
whole of the being that was being then in her and then it came to
be in her that she could be hurting first Miss Charles and then
Mrs. Redfern, then Miss Charles and Mrs. Redfern by planning. This
is then the being in her this that I am now with very much
complication slowly realising, not yet completely realising, not
yet completely ready to be completely describing, beginning now to
be describing. The dean Miss Charles was a very different person,
she was of the dependent independent kind of them. To understand
the being in her there must be now a little realisation of the way
beginning is in very many persons having in them a nature that is
self growing and a nature that is reacting to stimulation and that
have it in them to have these two natures acting in not very great
harmony inside them. Mrs. Redfern as I was saying in a long
description that has been already written was a very different kind
of person from Miss Dounor and Miss Charles. These are then the
three of them that were struggling and each of them had in them
their own ways of being brutal, hurting some one, had each of them
their own way of being sensitive to things and people near
them.</p>

<p>Sometimes I am almost despairing. Yes it is very hard, almost
impossible I am feeling now in my despairing feeling to have
completely a realising of the being in any one, when they are
telling it when they are not telling it, it is so very very hard to
know it completely in one the being in one. I know the being in
Miss Dounor that I am beginning describing, I know the being in
Miss Charles that I am soon going to be beginning describing, I
know the being in Mrs. Redfern, I have been describing the being in
that one. I know the being in each one of these three of them and I
am almost despairing for I am doubting if I am knowing it
poignantly enough to be really knowing it, to be really knowing the
being in any one of the three of them. Always now I am despairing.
It is a very melancholy feeling I have in me now I am despairing
about really knowing the complete being of any one of each one of
these three of them Miss Dounor and Miss Charles and Mrs.
Redfern.</p>

<p>Miss Dounor as I was saying was to Redfern the most complete
thing of gentleness and intelligence he could think of ever seeing
in anybody who was living, Miss Dounor had it to have in her the
complete thing of gentleness, of beauty in sensitiveness, in
completeness of intelligent sensitiveness in completely loving. She
was the complete thing then of gentleness and sensitiveness and
intelligence and she had it as a complete thing gentleness and
sensitiveness and intelligence in completely loving. It was in her
complete in loving, complete in creative loving, it was then
completed being, it was then completely in her completely loving
Phillip Redfern. And always to the ending of his living in all the
other loving and other troubling and the other enjoying of men and
women in him he was faithful to the thing she had been, was and
would be to him the completed incarnation of gentleness and
sensitiveness and intelligence, gentle intelligence and intelligent
sensitiveness and all to the point of completely creative loving
that was to him the supreme thing in all living. Miss Dounor was
then completely what Redfern found her to him, she was of them of
the independent dependent kind or them who have sensitive being to
the point of creative being, of attacking, of creative loving,
creative feeling, of sometimes creative thinking and writing. She
was then such a one and completely then this one and she had in her
completely sensitive being to the point of attacking. She could
have in her a planning of attacking and this came to be in her from
the completeness of sensitive creative loving that she had then in
her then when she was knowing Phillip Redfern.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was not of this kind of them. Perhaps she was at the
bottom, of the resisting kind of them. I think she was of the
resisting kind of them and so she needed to own the one she needed
for loving, so she could do resisting to planning making an
attacking. I am almost despairing, yes a little I am realising the
being in Miss Dounor and in Miss Charles and Mrs. Redfern, but I am
really almost despairing, I have really in me a very very
melancholy feeling, a very melancholy being, I am really then
despairing.</p>

<p>Miss Charles was of the kind of men and women that I speak of
and have spoken of as the dependent independent kind of them. I
will now tell a little about what I mean by self growing activity
in such of them and reactive activity in such of them. As I was
saying a long time back when I was describing the dependent
independent kind of them, reaction is not poignant in them unless
it enters into them the stimulation is lost in them and so sets it,
the mass, in motion, it is not as in the other kind of them who
have it to have a reactive emotion to be as poignant as a sensation
as is the case in the independent dependent kind of them. Miss
Charles then as I was saying was of the kind of them where reaction
to have meaning must be a slow thing, but she had quick reactions
as mostly all of them of this kind of them have them and those were
in her mostly attacking being as is very common in those having in
them dependent independent being.</p>

<p>It is so very confusing that I am beginning to have in me
despairing melancholy feeling. Mrs. Redfern as I was saying was of
the independent dependent kind of them and being in her was never
really attacking, it was mostly never active into forward movement
it was incessantly in action as being in a state of most continual
nervous agitation. They were then very different in their being the
three of them Miss Dounor and Miss Charles and Mrs. Redfern and
they had each one of them their own way of hurting the other ones
in their then living, of having in them sensitiveness to something.
It is hard to know it of any one whether they are enjoying
anything, whether they are feeling something, whether they are
knowing they are giving pain to some one, whether they were
planning that thing. It is a very difficult thing to know such
things in any one any one is knowing, very difficult even when they
are telling that one all the feeling they have in them, a very
difficult thing when they are not telling anything. It is a very
difficult thing to tell it of any one whether they are enjoying a
thing, whether they know that they are hurting some one, whether
they have been planning the acting they have been doing. It is a
very difficult thing to know anything of the being in any one, it
is a very difficult thing to know the being in any one if they tell
you all that they themselves know of it as they live it, if they
themselves tell you nothing at all about it. It is a very difficult
thing to know the being in any one. It is a very difficult thing to
know whether any one is feeling a thing, enjoying a thing, knowing
that they are hurting some one, planning that thing, planning
anything they are doing in their living. It is a difficult thing to
know the being in any one if that one tells to any one completely
all that that one has in them of telling, it is a very difficult
thing to know the being in any one if they are not telling any one
anything that they can have as telling in them. It is a very
difficult thing to know it of any one the being in them, it is a
very difficult thing to tell it of any one what they are feeling,
whether they are enjoying, whether they are knowing that they are
hurting some one, whether they had been planning doing that thing.
It is a very difficult thing to know these things in anyone, it is
a difficult thing if that one is telling everything they can be
telling, if that one is telling nothing. It is certainly a
difficult thing to know it of any one whether they have in them a
kind of feeling, whether they have in them at some time any
realisation that they are hurting some one, whether they had
planned doing that thing.</p>

<p>Miss Dounor had come to live with Miss Charles, they had come to
know each other in the way that it was natural for each one of them
to know the other one of them. The two of them then had come to
know Mrs. Redfern. They both had come then each in their way to
know her and to feel her and to have an opinion of her.</p>

<p>Miss Dounor had this being in her. She could have some planning
in her, this came from the completeness of pride in her. This now
comes to be clearer, that she had as completely pride in her as
sensitiveness and intelligent gentleness inside her. She had in her
pride as sensitive, as intelligent, as complete as the loving being
in her when she was loving Redfern. She had in her pride as
sensitive, as intelligent, as complete as the being ever in her.
She had always had in her a pride as complete, as intelligent, as
sensitive as the complete being of her. She had in her a pride as
intelligent, as sensitive as complete as the being in her. This
made it that she had planning in her, this made attacking sometimes
in her. This never made any action in her toward a lover, this gave
to her a power of planning and this was in her and she could be
wonderfully punishing some around her. This could be turned into
melodrama if the intelligence in her had not been so gentle and so
fine in her, this in many who are like her is a melodrama. In her
it made her able to do some planning against some to punish them
not for interfering but for existing and so claiming something that
entirely belonged to her. What was in Redfern to him himself a
weakness in him was to her a heroic thing to be defending. Pride
was in her then as delicate, as gentle, as intelligent as sensitive
as complete as the being in her. This is now more description of
her. This is now some description of the way she could be hurting
another, how she could be feeling another, how she could have
planning in her, how she did have planning in her. This is now more
description of her and the being in her. I am now a little
understanding the whole of her, I have in me still now a little
melancholy feeling.</p>

<p>Miss Charles was of the dependent independent kind of them as I
was saying.</p>

<p>Everybody is perfectly right. Everybody has their own being in
them. Some say it of themselves in their living, I am as I am and I
know I will never be changing. Mostly every one is perfectly right
in living. That is a very pleasant feeling to be having about every
one in the living of every one. Mostly not very many have that
pleasant feeling that everybody is as they are and they will not be
very much changing in them and everybody is right in their living.
It is a very pleasant feeling, knowing every one is as they are and
everybody is right in their living. Miss Dounor was as she was and
she was not ever changing, Miss Charles was as she was and was not
ever changing. Mrs. Redfern was as she was and always she wanted to
be changing and always she was trying.</p>

<p>Miss Dounor as I was saying was as she was all her living and
was not really ever changing and she was very right in her living
and she was very complete in her being and her pride was as
complete in her as her being and so she could be planning her
conviction of how far Mrs. Redfern should not go in presumption,
how far Miss Charles should not go in her interfering, how
completely Phillip Redfern was a saint in living and in her
devotion and she could carry out all this in its completion. Mrs.
Redfern had no understanding in desiring. Phillip Redfern always
should give her always would give her always would give to every
one anything she, anything they were ever asking. This was the
being in him. Asking was not presumption in Mrs. Redfern, desiring
was presumption and Miss Dounor could then have in her a planning
of perfect attacking. Always Mrs. Redfern should have anything she
could ever ask of anyone, that was a very certain thing. Always
Mrs. Redfern should have, would have from Mr. Redfern anything she
was ever asking of him. Always then to them to Mr. Redfern and to
Miss Dounor then, always then Mrs. Redfern had everything from
Redfern that she ever could ask of him. This was then a very
certain thing. Always then Mrs. Redfern had the right to ask
anything and always she would have anything she should ever be
asking of Phillip Redfern. She had in her, Mrs. Redfern, no
intelligence, no understanding, in desiring, Miss Dounor had in her
then a perfect power of planning the attacking that should keep
Mrs. Redfern in her place of condemnation for Mrs. Redfern had not
in her any intelligence in desiring, she had a right to anything
she ever could be asking and she would have it given to her then
whenever she asked for anything. Mrs. Redfern was never changing in
her being, always she was trying, always she was without
understanding in her desiring, always Miss Dounor could completely
plan an attacking when the time came for such action to restrain
Mrs. Redfern in her unintelligent desiring.</p>

<p>Miss Dounor was then perfectly right in her being. She was never
changing, she was completely loving, she was completely
understanding desiring, she was complete in the pride of attacking
in her complete sensitive, completely intelligent, completely
gentle being, completely understood desiring. Mrs. Redfern had no
understanding in desiring. Mrs. Redfern always was trying to change
the being she had in her to find some way of having intelligent
desiring in her, always she would have from Redfern anything she
could anything she should anything she would ever ask him to be
giving to her. That was the being in her.</p>

<p>There were three of them then, Miss Charles, Miss Dounor and
Mrs. Redfern.</p>

<p>Miss Charles was then not permitted by Miss Dounor to interfere
with the being inside her, ever at any time in their living. Miss
Charles was never asking anything of any one. Miss Charles was then
one of the dependent independent kind of them. Miss Charles was
then one having general moral and special moral aspirations and
general unmoral desires and ambitious and special unmoral ways of
carrying them into realisation and there was never inside her any
contradiction and this is very common in very many kinds of them of
men and women and later in the living of Alfred Hersland there will
be so very much discussion of this matter and now there will be a
little explanation of the way it acts in the kind of men and women
of which Miss Charles was one.</p>

<p>Some have it in them some having in them a being like Miss
Charles some of such of them have it in them to have it in the
beginning very strongly in them that they have generalised moral
aspirations, strongly detailed moral struggles in them, and then
slowly in them comes out in them that they are vigorous egotistic
sensual natures, loving being, living, writing, reading, eating,
drinking, loving, bullying, teasing, finding out everything, and
slowly they get courage in them to feel the being in them they have
in them, slowly they get courage in them to live the being they
have in them. Some like Miss Charles keep on having tranquilly
inside them equally strongly in them moral aspiration general and
detailed in them, egotistic expedient domineering as a general
aspiration and as detailed living in them. Some are always
struggling, some of this kind of them, some get to have in them
that the moral fervor in them in the general and specific
expression of them get to be the whole of them, some get to have it
all fairly mixed up in them. This is now a little description of
how one of them when she was a young one one of the first kind of
them who slowly came to have the courage of feeling and then living
the real being came to have the struggle as a beginning. Later then
came the courage to be more certain of the real being. This is now
a little piece of such a description of such beginning
experiencing.</p>

<p>As I was saying in many of such ones there is the slow reacting,
slow expressing being that comes more and more in their living to
determine them. There are in many of such ones aspirations and
convictions due to quick reactions to others around them, to books
they are reading, to the family tradition, to the lack of
articulation of the meaning of the being in them that makes them
need then to be filled full with other reactions in them so that
they will then have something. Some then spend all their living
struggling to adjust the being that slowly comes to active stirring
in them to the aspirations they had in them, some want to create
their aspirations from the being in them and they have not the
courage in them. It is a wonderful thing how much courage it takes
even to buy a clock you are very much liking when it is a kind of
one every one thinks only a servant should be owning. It is very
wonderful how much courage it takes to buy bright colored
handkerchiefs when every one having good taste uses white ones or
pale colored ones, when a bright colored one gives you so much
pleasure you suffer always at not having them. It is very hard to
have the courage of your being in you, in clocks, in handkerchiefs,
in aspirations, in liking things that are low, in anything. It is a
very difficult thing to get the courage to buy the kind of clock or
handkerchiefs you are loving when every one thinks it is a silly
thing. It takes very much courage to do anything connected with
your being unless it is a very serious thing. In some, expressing
their being needs courage, for, foolish ways to every one else, in
them. It is a very difficult thing to have courage to buy clocks
and handkerchiefs you are liking, you are seriously liking and
everybody thinks then you are joking. It is a very difficult thing
to have courage for something no one is thinking is a serious
thing.</p>

<p>As I was saying Miss Charles had in her what I am calling
dependent independent being, that is being that is not in its
quicker reacting poignant in its feeling, not having emotion then
have the keenness of sensation as those having independent
dependent being have it in them. Miss Charles was then such a
one.</p>

<p>This is then a very common thing as I am saying. Miss Charles
had in her this being. As I am saying there are two ways then of
acting in a being like those I have been just describing. The
acting from the personality slowly developing, the acting from the
organised reaction to contemporary ideals, tradition, education and
need of having, before the developing of their own being, completed
aspiration. Often these keep on as they did in Miss Charles and no
one is knowing which is the stronger way of being in such a one.
Sometimes there is as I was saying in the beginning very much
struggling and then slowly the personality comes to action and that
one drops away the early filling, sometimes the early filling comes
to be the later filling and in such a one then there is not any
changing. This is quite interesting and will be always more and
more dwelt upon. This then was the being in Miss Charles and this
was the meaning of her action with Miss Dounor and Mrs. Redfern and
Mr. Redfern that I have been describing.</p>

<p>There will be now a very little more description of the being in
them, of the virtuous feeling in them, of the religious feeling in
them, of the sensitiveness in them, of the worldly feeling in them,
of the succeeding and failing in them, in each one of the three of
them, Miss Dounor, Miss Charles and Mrs. Redfern.</p>

<p>Every one has their own being in them. Every one is right in
their own living. This is a pleasant feeling to have in one about
every one. This makes every one very interesting to one having such
a feeling in them. Every one is right in their living. Each one has
her or his own being in her or in him. Each one is right in the
living in her or in him. Each one of these three of them were right
in their living. This is now a little more description of the being
in each one of them.</p>

<p>It is a very difficult thing to know it of any one whether they
are enjoying anything, whether they are knowing they are giving
pain to some one, whether they were planning that thing. It is a
very difficult thing to know it of any one what is the kind of
thing they are sensitive to in living, what is the bottom nature in
them, whether they will in living be mostly succeeding or mostly
failing. It is hard to know such things in any one when they are
telling everything they have in them, when they are not telling to
any one anything of what they know inside them. It is a very
difficult thing the telling it of any one whether they are enjoying
a thing, whether they know that they are hurting some one, whether
they have been planning the acting they are doing. It is a very
difficult thing then to know anything of the being in any one, it
is hard then to know the being in many men and in many women, it is
a very difficult thing then to know the being and the feeling in
any man or in any woman. It is hard to know it if they tell you all
they know of it. It is hard to know it if they do not tell you what
they know of it in it. Nevertheless now almost I am understanding
the being in the three of them Miss Charles, Miss Dounor and Mrs.
Redfern. There will be now a very little more description of the
being in them, of the virtuous feeling in them of the religious
feeling in them, of the sensitiveness in them, of the worldly
feeling in them, of the succeeding and failure in them, in each one
of the three of them Miss Charles, Miss Dounor and Mrs.
Redfern.</p>

<p>Miss Cora Dounor could do some planning, could do some attacking
with it, that is certain. This is perhaps surprising to some
reading. To begin then with her feeling and her being and her
doing, and her succeeding and her failing.</p>

<p>She was then complete in her loving, she had complete
understanding in desiring in all her relation with Phillip Redfern,
she had completely then the realisation later in her that Phillip
Redfern was saintly and she had then in her the complete possession
of her adoration, the complete understanding and possession of her
adoration of the saintly being in him, and this was then in her a
complete succeeding in being and in living. This was not exactly
virtuous or religious being in her this was complete understanding
desiring and complete intelligent being in her and this was in her
succeeding in her being and in her living. This is very certain.
This was in her succeeding in her being and in her living. She had
then in her complete understanding in desiring, she had then
completely in her completed intelligence in adoration and this was
complete being in her and it was a complete possession of her and
by her and this was then completely succeeding in living. This is
now very certain.</p>

<p>She had then complete succeeding in her living as I was saying,
she had in her complete pride in her and this could be in her
strong sensitive attacking but this was not completely a succeeding
in her living. As I was saying Mrs. Redfern had in her no
intelligence whatever in desiring, this was in her then presumption
in her to Miss Dounor, not the things for which Mrs. Redfern was
asking, Mrs. Redfern had the right to ask for anything or
everything, it was desiring in her that was a thing Miss Dounor
could rightly condemn in her and later she made it very certain to
every one that Mrs. Redfern had no intelligence no understanding in
desiring and then at last Mrs. Redfern reproached her and so then
in a sense Miss Dounor was then failing in her being completely
proud inside her. Mrs. Redfern attempting to attack her, attacking
her even though failing in attacking was a failing of the complete
intelligent pride in the understanding sensitive planning attacking
pride in Miss Dounor and so Miss Dounor in her living was not then
completely succeeding. This is certain. There was then complete
succeeding in Miss Dounor in her loving in her completely
understanding desiring, in her complete intelligence of adoration,
in the completion of the being then in her, there was in her then
some failing that Mrs. Redfern could attack her with going on
attempting desiring. This is all very certain.</p>

<p>Miss Dounor held Miss Charles from really touching her real
being, she did not hold her from really touching Redfern's being.
She never recognised this failing in herself inside her but it was
a failing of the completeness of pride in her and later much later
when Redfern was no longer existing in living it made them separate
from one another, later it in spots made Miss Dounor bitter. Miss
Charles then was not succeeding in keeping Miss Dounor with her,
she was winning by not then having any remembrance in her of the
trouble she had had with her. Miss Dounor then was succeeding and
failing in some ways as I have been saying. There was real
succeeding in her as I have been saying, there was real failing in
her as I have been saying. This is all very certain. This has been
some description of the being in Miss Dounor and of her failing and
of her succeeding.</p>

<p>Miss Charles was of the kind of them the kind of men and women I
know very well in living. I know very well all the varieties of
this kind of them. In each kind of them they are nice ones they are
those that are not such nice ones, they are pleasant ones and they
are unpleasant ones, they are those having that kind of being in
them so lightly it hardly then makes them that kind of them, there
are then some of them having that being in them that kind of being
in them so concentratedly it is a wonderful thing to see them, to
see a kind of being so complete in one man or in one woman. Miss
Charles was of a kind of being I know very well in living, very
well indeed in living, I know very well all the varieties of the
kind of being that Miss Charles was in living in all the very many
millions ever living having had or having that kind of being in
them. Some then of a kind of being are nice ones, some of that kind
of them are not very nice ones, some of that kind of them are not
at all nice ones. Some of a kind of them are nice ones of that kind
of them and then they have a mixture in them of other kinds of
being in them and then that one is not a nice one though that one
has a nice kind of one kind of being in that one. That often makes
one a very puzzling one to every one. There are then all kinds of
ways of being one kind of them in men and women. Some are a nice
kind of a kind of them, and some are not a nice kind of that same
kind of them. Sometimes being in one who is a nice one of a kind of
them and then has other things mixed up in them is very perplexing
and sometimes no one in such a one ever comes to an understanding
of that one. Well then that is true then that of each kind of them
there are nice ones and nice enough ones and not very nice ones,
and not at all nice ones and very horrid ones. This can he in them
with any strength or weakness of their kind of being in them, it is
from the mixing and the accenting and the relation of parts of
their kind of nature in them. There is one thing very certain of
each kind of them of each kind there is of men and women there are
nice ones and then there are not at all nice ones of them. And
about some mostly every one is agreeing and about some there is
very much disagreeing and there are very many ways of feeling every
one and every one has their own being in them. Yes every one has
their own being in them and yes every one is right in living their
own being in them and this is a very difficult thing to be
realising and it is a very pleasant thing to have inside one when
it comes to be really in one.</p>

<p>Miss Charles was of a kind of men and women I know very well in
all the kind of ways of being they have in them. Miss Charles was
one of the independent dependent kind of them. Miss Charles was one
who was herself a very strong one in her being and it slowly came
to be more and more filling inside her. Miss Charles was one who
had it in her to have reaction in her to influences around her when
she was younger, to desires in her, to tradition and mob action and
to very many things then and they made moral aspiration in her they
made a reformer of her, they made an aggressive attacking person of
her and when she was a young one all this then almost completely
filled her. She was as I was saying of the dependent independent
kind in men and women and resisting, slow realisation was the
bottom way of feeling and of fighting and of understanding in her.
This came then slowly to be stronger in her, this made then of her
one that could be feeling and understanding brilliant men and
brilliant women, brilliant and sensitive men and brilliant and
sensitive women, made her feel them then and choose them then, then
when her resisting sensitive understanding had come to be more
completely the whole filling in her, then when slow steady detailed
domination came to be then really filling then inside her, then
when reforming attacking was changed in her to the personal being
that then was mostly all the filling in her. It was never all the
filling in her always she had in her a little of the special
reforming attacking which was reaction in her, quick reaction to
things and conditions around her and always she had very much in
her of the generalised moral attacking conviction that came from
the generalisation of her attacking and that made a righteous moral
person of her and this is a very common thing and later there will
be endless discussing of the meaning of this kind of moral being in
all kinds of men and women, the generalised conviction and the
relation of it to the concrete living, feeling, being in them, but
this will come later in the beginning of the understanding of
Alfred Hersland that will pretty soon now commence to be
written.</p>

<p>Miss Charles was of the dependent independent kind of them.
These have it in them then to have when they have quick reaction in
them that is not a stirring from the depths of them these have it
very often that this in them is a violent attacking, often
continuous bragging, often moral reforming conviction, often
nervous action in them, often incessant talking, incessant action,
incessant attacking in them and this is in those of them that are
the pure thing of dependent independent being and attacking is not
their way at all of winning fighting. There are some who have in
them resisting being and they have in them attacking being as
another nature in them but that is a different thing from this
thing that I am now describing, from the being in Miss Charles.
Miss Charles was completely dependent independent being, attacking
was not her way of winning fighting, it was resisting as I was
saying in telling what she did to win her fighting for Miss Dounor
with Redfern. That was then when she was a young one when she was
no longer a young one, when her own being was almost completely
then her filling, when there was in her the generalised moral
emotion that came from the reaction that filled her a good deal in
her young living, reaction that made attacking being then in her,
in her who had in her to have resisting as her way of winning
fighting, that was then what gave to her then attempting dominating
every one by attacking and this is a very common thing in those
having in them dependent independent being, this is a very common
thing in them in their young living when their real way of winning
fighting has not come yet to be in them. I am not saying that those
having in them dependent independent being cannot have in them
religion and moral or reforming passion as the expression of the
being in them, there are very many of them who have it in them as I
was saying, the old man Hissen had it in him and there are very
many of them of this kind of them and there are very many of many
various kinds of them of the dependent independent kind of them
that have religious or virtuous or moral or reforming passion in
them as the whole expression of the being in them but these express
this then by resisting fighting which is their way of winning
fighting. As I was saying there are many having in them dependent
independent being, and there are some of them who have it in them
only when they are younger ones and some have it in them very
strongly in them up to their ending, there are very many of them
who have much attacking of quick reacting, much attacking in
bragging, in being quickly certain of everything, of being very
quick in judging everything and these then some of them are mostly
all filled up with this kind of reacting attacking in them which is
not in them their real way of winning fighting. This is a very
important thing to know in men and women, a very important thing to
know in them in knowing them, in judging of the power in them of
succeeding or of failing in their living. The independent dependent
kind in men and women can have quick reaction that is completely
poignant, that is attacking, in them, that is their real way of
winning fighting. Those having in them dependent independent nature
in them have not real power in quick resisting, in attacking
fighting, many of them have this filling them all their living,
many of them have this filling them in their young living when
their own way of winning fighting is not yet developed in them
enough to fill them, some have almost nothing of this kind of
acting in them some of the dependent independent kind of them. All
this is very important, very very important, sometime there will be
very very much description of every kind of being in every kind of
men and women. Miss Charles was of the kind of them the kind of men
and women I know very well in living. I know very well all the
varieties of this kind of them. Some of each kind there is of men
and women are very nice ones of their kind of them, some of each
kind there is of men and women are not nice ones at all of their
kind of them. Miss Charles was not a very nice one, she was not a
not nice one at all of her kind of them. Being nice or not a nice
kind of one, a pleasant or unpleasant kind of one was not in her an
important thing. This is a very certain thing. She was as I was
saying in her younger living aggressive in her detailed and
generalised conviction of morality and reformation and
equalisation. Later in her living she went on in the direction she
had been going but her methods then were from the being in her and
that then mostly entirely filled her. That made her control
everything, every one near her by steady resisting pressure and
that was then the way of winning in her. Everything near her, every
one near her, every detail of everything was then more or less
completely owned by her. She was of the kind of them who own the
thing they need for loving. Later as I was saying Miss Dounor left
her, Miss Charles had a little owned Redfern almost and Miss Dounor
many years later left her and Miss Charles went on always to her
ending completely owning the college of Farnham.</p>

<p>There has been now enough description of Miss Charles. There has
been enough description of Miss Dounor. There has been enough
description of Miss Dounor and of Miss Charles. There will be now a
very little more description of Mrs. Redfern.</p>

<p>At the time of the ending of the living of the Redfern's at
Farnham, Alfred Hersland was just coming to his marrying of Julia
Dehning. The Redferns after the ending of their living at the
college of Farnham never lived anywhere together again. Mrs.
Redfern never understood this thing. Always she was expecting it to
begin again their living together until after the complete ending
of being in Redfern. That made her certain then that they would
never live together again.</p>

<p>After the ending of their Farnham living the Redferns never
lived anywhere together again. Mrs. Redfern never understood this
thing. She never knew that she would not ever again have him. This
never could come to be real knowledge in her and she was always
working at something to have him again and that was there always in
her to the end of him and of her. First she was travelling and
studying and then she was working to make some women understand
something and many laughed at her and always she was full of
desiring and always she was never understanding in desiring. W hen
there was the end of her living with Redfern her brother Alfred was
just coming to his marrying Julia Dehning. Martha was then
travelling and studying and then she came back to be with her
father and her mother was weakening then and later she was dead and
Mr. Hersland lost his great fortune and Martha then took care of
him. There will be now a little more description of her and then of
her with him. There will be a little more description of her
written in the history of the ending of the living in her father,
in the history of the later living of her brother Alfred Hersland,
in the history of her brother David Hersland. More description of
her will be part of the history of the ending of the existing of
the Hersland family. There will be very much history of this ending
of all of them of the Hersland family written later.</p>

<p>There will be now a little more description written of her and
of her living with her father when she came back to the family
living back out of her trouble after the ending of the living in
Phillip Redfern.</p>

<p>After the ending of the Redfern's living at Farnham the two of
them, Mr. and Mrs. Redfern never lived anywhere together again.
Mrs. Redfern never understood this thing. Always she was expecting
it to begin again, their living together and always she was
studying and preparing herself to be a companion to him in
intellectual living. Always then she was studying and striving and
travelling and working. And then he was dead and then she knew they
would not live together again. Then she was certain of this
thing.</p>

<p>That was her living then until he was dead and she went back to
the ten acre place where then her father and mother were living and
her mother was weakening then and a little while later then she
died there and Martha finished her living staying with her father
who had then lost his great fortune. No one knowing Mr. Hersland in
his middle living could have really been completely certain that he
would never bring through to a completed beginning anything in his
living. I was saying that he had in his middle living, the need in
him, of having people around him, who were not in him in his
feeling, who were there around him getting from his beginning the
realisation of their being, he was to them life enhancing. This
would have been in him, this need in him in the middle of his
middle living what ever would have been the power of completion in
him, for it is a need in all of them who have in them the being big
in a beginning. As I was saying no one knowing him could really be
completely certain then in him before the complete ending of his
middle living about the completeness of beginning in him, the
carrying power in him of a beginning and going on in action. No one
knowing Mr. Hersland before the complete ending of his middle
living could have been completely certain that he would never bring
through to a completed beginning anything in his living. No one
knowing Mr. Hersland in his middle living could have really been
completely certain that he would never bring through to a completed
beginning anything in his living. Later in the ending of his middle
living he was beginning to lose his great fortune. His wife was
dying and dead then and Martha was living with him and his sons
Alfred and David were in Bridgepoint then. Martha was living with
him at the ending of his middle living and from then on. As I was
saying no one knowing Mr. Hersland in his middle living could have
really been completely certain that he would never bring through to
a completed beginning anything in his living. Later in his middle
living he was beginning to lose his great fortune, at the ending of
his middle living he had pretty completely no great beginning in
him and Martha his daughter was then living with him.</p>

<p>Martha had never in her, as I have been saying understanding in
desiring. After the ending of her living with Redfern she went
about travelling, studying, working, and some laughed at her then
and she went on and always she could never understand this
thing.</p>

<p>Martha had not in her any understanding in desiring. She went on
as I was saying not hoping but intending to get ready to live again
with Phillip Redfern and be intellectually a companion to him. She
went about travelling and studying and working and intending to be
completely the thing Redfern wished a wife who lived with him to be
and she went on intending to be completely this thing, and very
many laughed about her then and she never saw Redfern again. She
never understood this thing. She had no understanding in desiring.
Redfern died young. When he was dead Martha came home to Gossols
and it was then the beginning of the ending of her father's middle
living. He was beginning then to lose his great fortune. He was
full up then pretty nearly with impatient feeling. Martha had no
understanding in desiring, she would always after a meal offer him
sugar to put in his coffee and he never took sugar in black coffee
and she never learned this thing and he was then completely filled
up with impatient feeling. He never liked to be helped in putting
on anything and always Martha helped him on with his coat and
always he would be completely then filled up with impatient
feeling. Martha Redfern then lived at home all the time her father
was losing his great fortune and then he was needing attacking
women to fill him where he was shrunk away from the outside of him
but he did not want to be filled so with Martha then, not then or
later in his living, she was never inside him to him, she offered
him sugar and he never took sugar in black coffee, never and she
tried to help him on with his over coat when he was leaving and he
never had wanted such a kind of attention and Martha always
commenced again and again for Martha was always full up with
desiring beginning, and he then he was full up then with impatient
feeling only he was not really completely full up then with
anything, he was then shrunk away from the outside of him, at least
this was then beginning in him. As I was saying no one knowing Mr.
Hersland in his middle living could have really been completely
certain that he would never bring through to a completed beginning
anything in his living. In the ending of his middle living he was
beginning to lose his great fortune. He had then still beginning in
him, mostly then he was full up with impatient feeling, later he
was shrunk away from the outside of him.</p>

<p>No one knowing Mr. Hersland in his middle living could have
really been completely certain that he would never bring through to
a completed beginning anything in his living. I was saying that he
had in his middle living the need in him, of having people around
him, who were not in him in his feeling, who were there around him
getting from his being strong in beginning, big as all the world in
his feeling, getting so a realisation of their own being, getting
from him the enhancing of being in them. This would have been in
him, this need of having men around him who received then from him
the enhancing of the being in them, this would have been in him
then in his middle living, whatever would have been the power of
completion of him, whatever strength he could have in him much or
little in him of carrying a beginning through to a complete
winning, for it is a need in very many men and very many women in
their middle living, it is a need in all of them who have in them
the being big in a beginning. As I was saying no one knowing him
could really be completely certain then about the power in him to
be completely succeeding to be completely failing, to be succeeding
or failing in his living no one who knew him before the ending of
the middle living in him, not those men who were around him and got
in them from hearing, feeling, seeing, hearing about the big
beginning always in him got in them the enhancing of the being in
them, not these then in his middle living could know it in them of
him whether he would have succeeding as the complete being in him,
failing as the complete being in him. These could not know it then
of him. Those men who began beginning with him and then left him to
do their own ending, being afraid of the way of going on with a
beginning in him, wanting to be doing their own ending, these could
not be certain in his middle living whether he would be ending his
beginning in success or in failing. These then up to the ending of
his middle living could not be certain of it about him. Those men
who were fighting against him, those whom he was brushing away from
around him, those whom when he was not succeeding in brushing them
away from before him, he went another way then and he was full up
with beginning action and he did not then really know it in him,
these could not know it certainly in them of him, later they might
think they had been certain about him, they were not then certain
about him not any of them completely certain then, this is a
certain thing, none of them of any of them he was brushing away
from before him, he was not succeeding in brushing away from before
him, those he was fighting against or those who were fighting
around him, none of them had in them to be certain then in them
whether he would be succeeding or failing in his completed living.
It is a most difficult thing to tell about very many men whether
they will be succeeding or failing, it is a most difficult thing to
know it about them. No one can be certain of them, of very many of
them before the complete ending of their middle living whether they
will be succeeding or failing in their living. In many men and in
many women, the character in them comes completely to be repeating
and one can know it completely in them as in repeating it comes out
of them, one can come to know of them the complete limits of the
variation of all repeating in them and yet one, no one can yet be
completely certain of them whether they will be succeeding or
failing in the whole living of them. And this is always and always
a certain thing and always and always it is more exciting the
knowing in one completely the character of them, the whole
repeating in them, the whole range of being in them and yet not
then being completely certain of them whether they will be
succeeding or failing in living.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of men and women as I have often been
saying and some of one kind of them have more succeeding in them
than others of that kind of them, some of that kind of them have
more failing in them than others of that kind of them and some are
very uncertain about whether there is succeeding or failing in
them, it is an uncertain thing always about them to their ending.
No one knowing Mr. Hersland up to the ending of his middle living,
not any men knowing him then, not any of them could be certain
whether he would be succeeding or failing in his completed living.
Not any women knowing him then whether they were feeling power with
him or in him or not feeling anything much about him, not his wife,
not any governess or servant living in the house with him, not any
woman managing him or not succeeding in managing him not any woman
could be really certain about him before the ending of his middle
living whether the beginning in him whether the being in him would
be a completion of winning in him, or succeeding or failing in him.
Not his children when they were angry with him for the impatient
feeling that filled him and they knew then that he went away from
men and from them and from women when he could not brush them away
from around him, not his children when they were angry with him and
told him how they knew the being in him, not his children then were
completely certain in them, could be really certain whether he
would be completing his living in succeeding or in failing. It is a
very difficult thing, an exceedingly difficult thing to know it of
very many men even when one is certain of all the being all the
possible variations of repeating ever coming out of them, to be
certain whether they will be succeeding or failing in living. It is
an exceedingly difficult thing in very many men and very many women
to know it of very many men and very many women, it is an
exceedingly difficult thing to know it of them whether they will be
succeeding or tailing in their living. One can know the complete
being in them, all the repeating coming out from them and it is
then still very often not before the ending of their middle living
that one can be really certain whether they will be succeeding or
failing in living. No one knowing Mr. Hersland in his middle living
could have really been completely certain that he would never bring
through to a completed beginning anything in his living. No one
then not any one from any way of knowing not any man not any woman
not any children could be really certain about him, not from any
way of knowing him, not from knowing all the being in him, all the
repeating ever coming out of him could have been really certain
before the ending of his middle living that he would not be
succeeding in living. At the ending of his middle living he was
beginning not succeeding in living, he was beginning losing his
great fortune.</p>

<p>It is so very exceedingly a difficult thing to know about the
going to be succeeding, the going to be failing in living in a very
great many men and women, it is an exceedingly difficult thing
although one can know of them all the being they have in them, all
the variations of repeating of the being in them ever coming out of
them. No one knowing Mr. Hersland up to the ending of his middle
living, not any of the men knowing him, feeling him, seeing him,
hearing him, hearing about him, working with him, working against,
working with him some and against him some, not any man or any
woman or any one of his children could really be certain about him
before the ending of his middle living, from any way of knowing,
from knowing anything about him or in him could really be certain
that he would not be succeeding in living. At the ending of his
middle living he was beginning not succeeding in living, he was
beginning losing his great fortune.</p>

<p>More it is certain that each one has his or her own being in her
or in him and always in repeating in all their living it comes out
of them and more and more of each one one comes to know of them all
the possible variations in each one of the repeatings always coming
out of them and each one then steadies down to be a whole one to
some one watching and understanding. This is very certain, always
each one has their own being in them and always each one is
repeating the whole being in them and always then more and more
some one can be certain about them the being in them the complete
gamut of variation in the repeating of them. And always about very
many of them even then it is an exceedingly difficult thing to know
it of such a one, one is so then knowing, whether they will be
failing or succeeding in living. I have been repeating again and
again that no one knowing Mr. Hersland in his middle living,
knowing Mr. Hersland before the ending of his middle living could
really have been completely certain that he would, that he would
not bring through to a completed beginning anything in his living,
that he would be succeeding or failing in living. No one could be
really certain about him about succeeding or failing in living
until the end of his middle living. He was then beginning
definitely not succeeding in living, he was beginning then really
losing his great fortune. There will be more description of Mr.
David Hersland, always more description of him, always in this
history of many men and many women. There will be a little more and
a little more description of him always in this history of many men
and many women.</p>

<p>It is an exceedingly difficult thing in very many women and in
very many men to know it of them whether they will be succeeding or
failing in living. I have been saying it very often about Mr. David
Hersland, it is true about very many women and very many men of all
the kinds there are of men and women. It was as I have been
repeating what no one could tell for certain about Mr. David
Hersland. No one could tell it about him before the ending of his
middle living for certain, not any one, whether he would be
succeeding or failing in living. At the ending of his middle living
he was beginning not succeeding in living, he was beginning losing
his great fortune.</p>

<p>It is an exceedingly difficult thing to know it of any one
whether they will be succeeding or failing in living. It is an
exceedingly difficult thing to know it of any one. It is a very
difficult thing to know the complete being in any one but always
more and more it comes to be certain in each one one is knowing the
complete being in them, sometime too it almost comes to be certain
about them whether they will be succeeding or failing in living. In
some it comes to be certain to some, to some one the complete being
in them and still it is not a certain thing whether they will be
succeeding or failing in living, Mr. Hersland as I have been saying
again and again was one of such of them. There are always many of
such of them in all the kinds there are of men and women. Mr.
Hersland then was very completely such a one, Martha, his daughter,
Mrs. Redfern was less completely such a one, it came very nearly
being certain that she would not be succeeding in living but she
might have been succeeding in living. It was not a certain thing,
not completely a certain thing and it was not a certain thing that
she was not succeeding in living not succeeding in living before
the ending of her living. There will then be more description of
Mr. David Hersland and always more description of him always in
this history of many men and many women, there will be a little
more and a little more description of him always being written,
always in this history of a good many men and a good many
women.</p>

<p>There will be more description of Martha Hersland, Mrs. Redfern,
written in the history of the ending of the living of Mr. David
Hersland, her father, in the history of the living and the later
living of her brother Alfred Hersland, in the history of her
brother David Hersland and in the history of the ending of his
living There will be always more history of her and it will later
come to be part of the history of the ending of the existing of the
Hersland family. There will be very much history written of the
ending of all of them of the Hersland family written later.<br>

<h2>6. ALFRED HERSLAND AND JULIA DEHNING</h2>

<p>I have been giving the history of a very great many men and
women. Sometime I will give a history of every kind of men and
women, every kind there is of men and women. Already I have given a
history of many men and women. Sometime I will be giving a history
of all the rest of them. This is now pretty nearly certain. I have
been already giving the history of a very great many men and women,
I will be now giving the history of a number of more of them and
then of a number more still of them and then still of some more of
them and then this will be the end of this history of very many men
and women. Sometime then I will give a history of all of them and
that will be a long book and when I am finished with this one then
I will begin that one. I have already begun that one but now I am
still writing on this one and now I am beginning this portion of
this one which is the complete history of Alfred Hersland and of
every one he ever came to know in living and of many other ones I
will be describing now in this beginning.</p>

<p>Sometime I want to understand every kind of way any one can have
the feeling of being distinguished by the virtue they have in them.
Sometime I want to understand every kind of way any one can have
the feeling of being distinguished in them and every kind of thing
that can give any one a feeling of such distinction of such virtue
in themselves inside them.</p>

<p>Being distinguished each one inside them by something, to
themselves in their feeling, is very interesting. Being virtuous
each one inside them by something, to themselves in their feeling
is very interesting. Being right each one inside them by something
to themselves in their feeling is very interesting.</p>

<p>Many have a very certain feeling a sure feeling, about something
inside them. Many have a certain feeling about something inside
them. Many need company for it, this is very very common. Many need
a measure for it, this will need explaining. Some need drama to
support it, some need lying to help it, some love it, some hate it,
some never are very certain they really have it. Certain feeling in
men and women is very common.</p>

<p>Some as I am saying have sure feeling in them, have honor in
them and religion from the nature of them when this is strong
enough in them to make it their own inside them. Some can make
their own honor, some their own loving, some their own religion,
some are weak and can do one thing, make one thing their own, some
are strong enough and all of it, loving, honor, certainty and
religion in them, all of it is some one else's, of some one else's
making, some can just resist and not make their own anything, there
are many of them. Some out of their own virtue make a god who
sometimes later is a terror to them. Out of their own virtue they
make a god who sometimes later is a terror to them. Some make some
things like laws out of the nature of them, out of the nature of
some other one. Some are controlled by other people's virtue, and
then it scares them. Listen to each one telling about their own
virtue and that grows to make a god for them, grows to be a law for
them and often afterwards scares them, some afterwards like it,
some forget it, some are it. Some honor what is right to them for
them to be doing. Some separate honor from the doing of the thing,
have it as a feeling. Some love themselves enough to not want to
lose themselves, immortality can to them mean nothing but this
thing. Some love themselves negatively, then impersonal future life
is for them alright, a good enough thing. Some love themselves and
others so hard that they are sure that they will exist even when
they won't, they do to themselves exist even when they don't, these
have a future life feeling an individual thing, some love
themselves and they are it and that is all there is of it in them
and they do not have future life in them to be an important thing.
Men and women have being in them all of them when they are living.
Many men and women have in them a feeling of future life in them,
very many of them, some for this life, some for another life, some
for both lives, this and another one, some have a stronger, some
have a weaker feeling of themselves inside them, some have more,
some have less loving in them for themselves than other ones have
in them, some have more some have less loving in them for other
ones than others have in them, some have more some have less
feeling for some thing than other ones have in them and all these
things in each one are part in them of the virtuous feeling, of the
religious feeling they have in them each one, each man and woman,
each one having man or woman being in them, each man or woman has
some being in her or in him.</p>

<p>I want to know sometime all about sentimental feeling. I want to
know sometime all the different kinds of ways people have it in
them to be certain of anything. These and virtuous feelings in each
one, of themselves to themselves having virtue inside them, is to
me very interesting. Always more and more I want to know it of each
one what certainty means to them, how they come to be certain of
anything, what certainty means to them and how contradiction does
not worry them and how it does worry them and how much they have in
them of remembering and how much they have in them of forgetting,
and how different any one is from any other one and what any one
and every one means by anything they are saying. All these things
are to me very interesting.</p>

<p>As I was saying virtuous feeling and being certain of anything
is to me very interesting. Having virtuous feeling and any certain
feeling, that is being certain of anything is to me very
interesting in every one. Having certainty in them is in each one
of the kind of way that their kind of men and women have it of
having it in them. Having certainty in them is a thing very
interesting in each one having a certainty of anything in her or in
him. Certainty and virtuous feeling and religion these are to me
all three just now very interesting. Shortly I will try to tell a
little of the way some come to have their certainty in them. Some
build certainty up with little and little sure things and make a
pile of them, some are summary and all embracing in the certain
feeling they have always in them, some are certain of almost
anything, some are hardly certain of anything, some have to have a
complete system for each certain feeling in them, some have
certainty in them and they do not know it then in them, some have
to have it come out of them as action and then they are not
certain, some are certain only after there is not any more action
in them from that certain thing in them, some have some action in
them and then slowly they know they have certainty in them, some
have to understand a thing to accept it and then afterwards they
have certainty in them, some have hardly any certainty at all ever
really in them, very many have very many certainties always in
them, some have a sense of dramatic arrangement to complete the
scene of the certain conviction the certain emotion they have in
them and the complete scene changes for them with each new
certainty they have in them. Certainty worries some and some never
have certainty as a worry to them. Some have certainty by
comparison, by comparing the thing they have then with what any
other one they are knowing, hearing, seeing is having, some never
compare anything with anything in any one, certainty is a real
thing in some, in some of such of them as a little pile they are
gradually increasing, in some as something that they keep there
inside them always of the same dimension, in some as something they
have because they are defending that thing, in some as something
they have because they are attacking some one for that thing, in
some as something that gives to them for that thing a stubborn
feeling in them. Some need company to keep their certainty from
freezing or melting or evaporating or in some way disappearing.
Some do not know they have certainty in them, do not ever concern
themselves with such a thing. Some have it, some do not have it in
them. Some have it sometimes, some have it sometime in them. Some
have it and do not know it. Some have it and do not know it until
it is acting. Some are not certain then when it is acting that they
have it in them. Some have it and lose it while they are speaking.
Quite a number have it and lose it while they are speaking or
acting. Some almost always almost have it and they do not have it
just at the last moment before they are certain. Some are very
energetic to express it but always they do not have it in them.
Some are energetic to express it and they always almost have it in
them. In some it passes very easily out of them. Very many lose it
every second in their living. Some are always thinking they are
losing this thing. Some need company to keep any certainty in them,
some like company around them while they have their own certainty
inside them, some need to have the certainty in the presence of the
company that they need to have with them always in their living.
Certainty and virtuous feeling and important feeling in men and
women is very interesting. I wish I could know everything of any
such thing I would then be a very wise one to every one.</p>

<p>Some feel some kinds of things others feel other kinds of
things. Mostly every one feels some kinds of things. The way some
things touch some and do not touch other ones, and kinds in men and
women then, I will now begin to think some about describing.</p>

<p>It makes me a little unhappy that everything is a little funny.
It makes me a little unhappy that many things are funny and
peculiar and strange to me. It makes me a little unhappy that
everything and every one is sometime a little queer to me. It makes
me a little unhappy that every one seems sometime almost a little
crazy. It does make me a little unhappy that every one sometime is
a queer one to me. It does make me sometime a little uncertain, it
does sometimes make me very uncertain about everything and always
then it is perplexing what is certain what is not certain, who is a
queer one, what is a funny thing for some one to be wanting or not
wanting or doing or not doing or thinking or not thinking or
believing or not believing.</p>

<p>It does certainly make me a little unhappy that every one
sometime is a queer one to me. It does certainly make me a little
unhappy quite often that every one is really inside them or in
thinking, in doing or in feeling or in believing a queer one. It
certainly does make me an uncomfortable one and sometimes a little
an unhappy, a gently almost melancholy sulky one that every one
sometime is a queer one.</p>

<p>More and more in living each one is certain that other ones have
believing something in them that is almost an impossible thing for
each one to believe that any other one can really be believing, any
other one who is not a crazy one. Always more and more in living
each one, every one is learning that other ones are believing
something thinking something, that one thinks another one is doing
something that one only would be doing if he is a crazy one and the
other one is not a crazy one and the other one is believing a thing
that to some one is not possible that any one not a crazy one could
really be believing. This is a very common thing. This is a very
common thing and very many more and more in their living come to a
realising that other ones are believing things and it is more and
more interesting and sometimes very depressing to any one of such
of them that wants to be understanding the being in men and women.
This then is as I am saying a very common thing that others are
believing things that it seems absolutely impossible those ones
should be believing and often it is altogether puzzling and more
and more in living if any one is listening to other one's thinking
and believing, more and more this is borne in on that one. Always
it is very interesting, sometimes it is surprising, sometimes
puzzling, sometimes depressing, sometimes a very funny thing and in
every kind of a way always to one listening to other's repeating
always more and more it is borne in on such a one.</p>

<p>As I have been saying each one has their own being in them, each
one has their own sensitiveness to things in them, each one is of a
kind of them. Of each kind of them some are more completely
themselves than others of their kind of them and this is now a very
long discussion of the way being is in some and in others of one
kind of them and then of being in some and in others of all the
kinds of them all the kinds there are of men and women.</p>

<p>Disillusionment in living is finding that no one can really ever
be agreeing with you completely in anything. Disillusionment then
in living that gives to very many then melancholy feeling, some
despairing feeling, some resignation, some fairly cheerful
beginning and some a forgetting and continuing and some a dreary
trickling weeping some violent attacking and some a letting
themselves do anything, disillusion then is really finding, really
realising, really being certain that no one really can completely
agree with you in anything, that, as is very certain, not, those
fighting beside you or living completely with you or anybody,
really, can really be believing anything completely that you are
believing. Really realising this thing, completely realising this
thing is the disillusionment in living is the beginning of being an
old man or an old woman is being no longer a young one no longer a
young man or a young woman no longer a growing older young man or
growing older young woman. This is then what every one always has
been meaning by living bringing disillusion. This is the real thing
of disillusion that no one, not any one really is believing,
seeing, understanding, thinking anything as you are thinking,
believing, seeing, understanding such a thing. This is then what
disillusion is from living and slowly then after failing again and
again in changing some one, after finding that some one that has
been fighting for something, that every one that has been fighting
something beside you for a long time that each one of them splits
off from you somewhere and you must join on with new ones or go on
all alone then or be a disillusioned one who is not any longer then
a young one. This is then disillusionment in living and sometime in
the history of David Hersland the younger son in the Hersland
family living then in a part of Gossols where they alone of rich
people were living there will be completely a history of the
disillusionment of such a realising and the dying then of that one,
of young David Hersland then.</p>

<p>This is then complete disillusionment in living, the complete
realisation that no one can believe as you do about anything, so
not really any single one and to some as I am saying this is a sad
thing, to mostly every one it is sometime a shocking thing,
sometimes a shocking thing, sometime a real shock to them, to
mostly every one a thing that only very slowly with constant
repetition is really a complete certain thing inside to give to
them the being that is no longer in them really young being. This
is then the real meaning of not being any longer a young one in
living, the complete realising that not any one realty can believe
what any other one is believing and some there are, enough of them,
who never have completely such a realisation, they are always
hoping to find her or him, they are always changing her or him to
fit them, they are always looking, they are always forgetting
failing or explaining it by something, they are always going on and
on in trying. There are a very great many of them who are this way
to their ending. There are a very great many who are this way
almost to their very ending, there are a great many men and women
who have sometime in them in their living complete disillusion.</p>

<p>There is then as I am saying complete disillusion in living, the
realising, completely realising that not any one, not one fighting
for the same thinking and believing as the other, not any one has
the same believing in her or in him that any other one has in them
and it comes then sometime to most every one to be realising with
feeling this thing and then they often stop having friendly feeling
and then often they begin again but it is then a different thing
between them, they are old then and not young then in their
feeling.</p>

<p>Young ones sometimes think they have it in them, this thing,
some young ones kill themselves then, stop living then, this is
often happening, young ones sometimes, very often even, think they
have in them this thing but they do not have it in them, mostly not
any young one, as a complete realisation, this thing, they have it
in them and it is sometimes, very often then an agony to them, some
of them kill themselves or are killed then, but really mostly not
any of them have really realised the thing, they may be dead from
this thing, they have not realised the thing, it has been an awful
agony in them, they have not really grasped the thing as having
general human meaning, it has been a shock to them, it may perhaps
even have killed completely very completely some of them, mostly
then a young one has not really such a thing in them, this is
pretty nearly certain, later there will be much description of
disillusionment in the being of David Hersland who was always in
his living as I was saying trying to be certain from day to day in
his living what there was in living that could make it for him a
completely necessary thing.</p>

<p>This is then a very little description of feeling
disillusionment in living. There is this thing then there is the
moment and a very complete moment to those that have had it when
something they have bought or made or loved or are is a thing that
they are afraid, almost certain, very tearful that no one will
think it a nice thing and then some one likes that thing and this
then is a very wonderful feeling to know that some one really
appreciates the thing. This is a very wonderful thing, this is a
thing which I will now be illustrating.</p>

<p>Disillusionment in living is the finding out nobody agrees with
you not those that are and were fighting with you. Disillusionment
in living is the finding out nobody agrees with you not those that
are fighting for you. Complete disillusionment is when you realise
that no one can for they can't change. The amount they agree is
important to you until the amount they do not agree with you is
completely realised by you. Then you say you will write for
yourself and strangers, you will be for yourself and strangers and
this then makes an old man or an old woman of you.</p>

<p>This is then one thing, another thing is the perfect joy of
finding some one, any one really liking something you are liking,
making, doing, being. This is another thing and a very pleasant
thing, sometimes not a pleasant thing at all. That depends on many
things, on some thing.</p>

<p>It is a very strange feeling when one is loving a clock that is
to every one of your class of living an ugly and a foolish one and
one really likes such a thing and likes it very much and liking it
is a serious thing, or one likes a colored handkerchief that is
very gay and every one of your kind of living thinks it a very ugly
or a foolish thing and thinks you like it because it is a funny
thing to like it and you like it with a serious feeling, or you
like eating something and liking it is a childish thing to every
one or you like something that is a dirty thing and no one can
really like that thing or you write a hook and while you write it
you are ashamed for every one must think you are a silly or a crazy
one and yet you write it and you are ashamed, you know you will be
laughed at or pitied by every one and you have a queer feeling and
you are not very certain and you go on writing. Then some one says
yes to it, to something you are liking, or doing or making and then
never again can you have completely such a feeling of being afraid
and ashamed that you had then when you were writing or liking the
thing and not any one had said yes about the thing. In a way it is
a very difficult thing to like anything, to do anything. You can
never have again either about something you have done or about
something any one else has done the same complete feeling if some
one else besides the first one sees it, some other one if you have
made it, yourself if you have understood something, you can never
again have the complete feeling of recognition that you have then.
You can have very many kinds of feelings you can only alone and
with the first one have the perfect feeling of not being almost
completely filled with being ashamed and afraid to show something
to like something with a really serious feeling.</p>

<p>I have not been very clear in this telling, it will be clearer
in the description of master and schools in living and in working,
and in painting and in writing and in everything.</p>

<p>It is a very queer thing this not agreeing with any one. It
would seem that where we are each of us always telling and
repeating and explaining and doing it again and again that some one
would really understand what the other one is always repeating. But
in loving, in working, in everything it is always the same thing.
In loving some one is jealous, really jealous and it would seem an
impossible thing to the one not understanding that the other one
could have about such a thing a jealous feeling and they have it
and they suffer and they weep and sorrow in it and the other one
cannot believe it, they cannot believe the other one can really
mean it and sometime the other one perhaps comes to realise it that
the other one can really suffer in it and then later that one tries
to reassure the other one the one that is then suffering about that
thing and the other one the one that is receiving such reassuring
says then, did you think I ever could believe this thing, no I have
no fear of such a thing, and it is all puzzling, to have one kind
of feeling, a jealous feeling, and not have a fear in them that the
other one does not want them, it is a very mixing thing and over
and over again when you are certain it is a whole one some one, one
must begin again and again and the only thing that is a help to one
is that there is really so little fundamental changing in any one
and always every one is repeating big pieces of them and so
sometime perhaps some one will know something and I certainly would
like very much to be that one and so now to begin.</p>

<p>All this leads again to kinds in men and women. This then will
be soon now a description of difference in men and women morally
and intellectually in them between concrete acting, thinking and
feeling in them and generalised acting, thinking and feeling in
them.</p>

<p>Many women and men have a completely sure feeling in them. Many
men and women have certain feeling with something inside them.</p>

<p>Many have a very certain feeling about something inside them.
Many need company for it, this is very common, many need a measure
for it, this will need explaining, some need drama to support it,
some need lying to help it, some are not letting their right hand
know what their left hand is doing with it, some love it, some hate
it, some never are very certain they really have it, some only
think they love it, some like the feeling of loving it they would
have if they could have it. Some have a feeling they would have it
if they had their life to live over again and they sigh about it.
Certain feeling in men and women is very interesting.</p>

<p>As I was saying in many there is the slow reacting, slow
expressing being that comes more and more in their living to
determine them. There are in many of such ones aspirations and
convictions due to quick reactions to others around them, to books
they are reading, to the family tradition, to the spirit of the age
in educating, in believing, to the lack of power of articulating
the being in them that makes them need then to be filled full with
other reactions in them so that they will then have something. Some
of such of them spend all their living in adjusting the being that
comes to active condition inside them in their living to the being
they have come to be in living from all being that has been
affecting them in all their living, some of such of them want a
little in them to create their living from the being inside them
and they have not the power in them for this thing, they go on then
living the being of even one that has been making them. It is a
wonderful thing how very much it has to be in one, how it needs to
be so strongly in one anything, how much it needs to be in one
anything so that thing is a thing that comes then to be done, it is
a wonderful thing how very much it needs to be in one anything, any
little any big thing so that that thing will be done by that one.
It is a wonderful thing as I was saying and I am now repeating, it
is a wonderful thing how much a thing needs to be in one as a
desire in them how much courage any one must have in them to be
doing anything if they are a first one, if it is something no one
is thinking is a serious thing, if it is the buying of a clock one
is very much liking and everybody is thinking it an ugly or a
foolish one and the one wanting it has for it a serious feeling and
no one can think that one is buying it for anything but as doing a
funny thing. It is a hard thing to be loving something with a
serious feeling and every one is thinking that only a servant girl
could be loving such a thing, it is a hard thing then to buy that
thing. It is a very wonderful thing how much courage it takes to
buy and use them and like them bright colored handkerchiefs when
every one having good taste is using white ones or pale colored
ones when a bright colored one gives to the one buying them so much
pleasure that that one suffers always at not having them when that
one has not bought one of such of them. It is a very difficult
thing to have your being in you so that you will be doing
something, anything you are wanting, having something anything you
are wanting when you have plenty of money for the buying, in clocks
in handkerchiefs, so that you will be thinking, feeling anything
that you are needing feeling, thinking, so that you will be having
aspirations that are really of a thing filling you with meaning, so
that you will be having really in you in liking a real feeling of
satisfaction. It is very hard to know what you are liking, whether
you are not really liking something that is a low thing to yourself
then, it is a very difficult thing to get the courage to buy the
kind of clock or handkerchiefs you are loving when every one thinks
it is a silly thing, when every one thinks you are doing it for the
joke of the thing. It is hard then to know whether you are really
loving that thing. It takes very much courage to do anything
connected with your being that is not a serious thing. It takes
courage to be doing a serious thing that is connected with one's
being that is certain. In some, expressing their being needs
courage, in foolish ways, ways that are foolish ones to every one
else, in them. It is a very difficult thing to have courage to buy
clocks and handkerchiefs you are loving, you are seriously
appreciating, with which you have very seriously pleasure with
enjoying and everybody is thinking then that you are joking. It is
a very difficult thing to have courage for that which no one is
thinking is a serious thing.</p>

<p>Some have a measure in living and some do not have any measure
to determine them. Many in their living are determined by the
measure of some one, they are to themselves to be like some one or
very near to what that one is for them, they are like some one or
are something like some one, they have then a measure by which they
can determine what they are to be, to do in living. Such then are
always followers in living, many of such of them have their own
being in them, all of such of them have some being in them, all of
such of them have a measure that determines them, they are
themselves inside them, they need only come very near doing, being
some certain thing which is established already as a standard for
them by some one who did not have any standard to make her or him
some one and that one is a master and the others having themselves
inside them and such a one as a measure for them are schoolmen, and
now there will be very little description of these things in men
and women for it is something that is important in the being in
David Hersland the second son. The important thing now to be
discussing is concrete and abstract aspiration, concrete and
generalised action in many men and women of very many kinds of them
and now there will be a beginning of discussing the feeling in each
one of being a bad one, of being a good one, the relation of
aspiration and action, of generalised and concrete aspiration and
action.</p>

<p>It happens very often that a man has it in him, that a man does
something, that he does it very often, that he does many things,
when he is a young one and an older one and an old one. It happens
very often that a man does something, that a man has something in
him and he does a thing again and again in his living. There was a
man who was always writing to his daughter that she should not do
things that were wrong that would disgrace him, she should not do
such things and in every letter that he wrote to her he told her
she should not do such things, that he was her father and was
giving good moral advice to her and always he wrote to her in every
letter that she should not do things that she should not do
anything that would disgrace him. He wrote this in every letter he
wrote to her, he wrote very nicely to her, he wrote often enough to
her and in every letter he wrote to her that she should not do
anything that was a disgraceful thing for her to be doing and then
once she wrote back to him that he had not any right to write moral
things in letters to her, that he had taught her that he had shown
her that he had commenced in her the doing the things things that
would disgrace her and he had said then when he had begun with her
he had said he did it so that when she was older she could take
care of herself with those who wished to make her do things that
were wicked things and he would teach her and she would be stronger
than such girls who had not any way of knowing better, and she
wrote this letter and her father got the letter and he was a
paralytic always after, it was a shock to him getting such a
letter, he kept saying over and over again that his daughter was
trying to kill him and now she had done it and at the time he got
the letter he was sitting by the fire and he threw the letter in
the fire and his wife asked him what was the matter and he said it
is Edith she is killing me, what, is she disgracing us said the
mother, no said the father, she is killing me and that was all he
said then of the matter and he never wrote another letter.</p>

<p>It happens very often that a man has it in him, that a man does
something, that he does it very often that he does many things,
when he is a young man when he is an old man, when he is an older
man. Some kind of young men do things because they are so good then
they want every one to be wise enough to take care of themselves
and so they do some things to them. This is very common and these
then are very often good enough kind of young men who are very good
men in their living. There will soon be a little description of one
of them. There are then very many men and there is then from the
generalised virtue and concrete action that is from the nature of
them that might make one think they were hypocrites in living but
they are not although certainly there are in living some men
wanting to deceive other men but this is not true of this kind of
them. One of such of these kind of them had a little boy and this
one, the little son wanted to make a collection of butterflies and
beetles and it was all exciting to him and it was all arranged then
and then the father said to the son you are certain this is not a
cruel thing that you are wanting to be doing, killing things to
make collections of them, and the son was very disturbed then and
they talked about it together the two of them and more and more
they talked about it then and then at last the boy was convinced it
was a cruel thing and he said he would not do it and his father
said the little boy was a noble boy to give up pleasure when it was
a cruel one. The boy went to bed then and then the father when he
got up in the early morning saw a wonderfully beautiful moth in the
room and he caught him and he killed him and he pinned hint and he
woke up his son then and showed it to him and he said to him "see
what a good father I am to have caught and killed this one," the
boy was all mixed up inside him and then he said he would go on
with his collecting and that was all there was then of discussing
and this is a little description of something that happened once
and it is very interesting.</p>

<p>It happens very often that a man has it in him, that he does
things, that he does something, that he does many things when he is
a young man and an older man and an old man, that he feels always
in a way about everything, that he is a good enough man in living,
that he is a very good man.</p>

<p>Some kinds of young men do things with a feeling that they are
teaching people to be strong and good ones and to take care of
themselves and they are doing something and almost every one would
say it was a very wicked thing this thing they are doing and in
some it makes of them a very unpleasant person and some of such of
them are not the least bit unpleasant ones because they have no
mixing between the generalised conception and the concrete action.
Many old men do things to keep themselves warm then, when they are
old ones and they are needing to be warm then. Some of them are
cold then and they need to be warm then and need to be warmed up
then, and some are shrunk away from the outside of them then when
they are old men and need some one to Oil them and they do concrete
actions then and their generalised sensation is keeping warm then,
their generalised intention is of keeping warm then and this is all
very interesting and always if Alfred Hersland and Mr. Herman
Dehning and George Dehning come to be clear ones in this describing
always then sometime many will be completely understanding this
being I am now understanding, now completely understanding.</p>

<p>There are very many kinds of men. In each kind of them there are
some of them who have it in them to have the being in them so that
the concrete things they are doing are very different from the
generalised feeling in them of what it is right and decent and good
and bad to be doing. There are very many kinds of men, quite a
number of kinds of them and of each kind of them there are always
very great many millions of them always living and very many
millions of them always have the being in them, very many millions
of each kind of them that the being in them is so in them that the
concrete actions, feelings in them are very different in them from
the generalised feelings strongly in them and this is true of many
of all the kinds there are of men and these then may be sentimental
from this thing, and it may be very simply in them, they may be
very unpleasant then from this thing and they may not be unpleasant
unpleasant to hardly any one from this thing and this is something
that in all the living of every one of them is interesting in them,
in all the living of a great many men is interesting to them.</p>

<p>There are so many of them, each kind of them does it differently
from the other kinds of them, each one of a kind of them does it
differently from the others of that kind of them and in some it is
more in the thinking than the feeling, in some more in acting than
in thinking and in feeling, it is a very complete thing to be
understanding, each one has in him his own being, each one of them
has in him his own way of repeating this thing in him, each one has
in him the way of having this in him that his kind of men have it
in them. Women have it in them, that will come later in
writing.</p>

<p>It happens then very often that a man has it in him that he does
something and that thing is a concrete acting and no one would ever
think that man had done that thing and that man is a good man, and
he does it very often.</p>

<p>It happens very often that a man does something and he does it
very often and it is an awful shock to him if sometime some one
tells it to him and as I was saying one of such of them was a
paralytic from being told it by one of his children in his later
living and always such a man does a thing and it is a concrete
thing and as a man he has many concrete actions in him and these he
does very often and in his living, in his feeling a complete
generalised sincere feeling always completely him, not a
sentimental thing, a real thing in him by which he very often is
completely living and he does a concrete thing and does it very
often does many of them that have no place in his generalised
sincere feeling and sometimes it is told to him and he can be
killed then and almost by hearing this thing said of him so
strongly is it in him that he is not doing that concrete thing,
that he has never done that thing. These then this kind of them are
not self-righteous men who think the way they do things should be
the way of all men, they are not men like those I was describing
who make an ideal out of the weakness in them, they are the men
they very ordinary men who have it in them to believe that that
they have inside them in their living in their feeling in their
thinking what all good decent men have in them in their thinking,
in their living, in their feeling and this is a generalised
conviction of themselves to themselves always in them, all their
living, and they see themselves in their living, and their being
and their thinking, in their feeling as good enough men, good
enough fathers, good enough husbands, good enough citizens, and
always they are seeing themselves as each of them and so they see
all of their concrete actions and sometimes and very often they are
doing something, that thing they do very often and that thing is a
thing not any man who is a good enough man would be doing and
mostly a very great many of them of these who are to themselves
completely good enough men are very very often doing such a thing
and it is to them when they are young ones and a little older ones
that they are doing it to be instructing to others so that other
ones will know something and when they are older ones they do it
then because in their realler feeling they know things are not so
important as they once were thinking they were to them and every
one, and then when they are old ones they need any way there is
that can warm them and always to themselves they are the
generalised good enough men and always then they are doing very
often a thing somethings that are not included in such a
generalisation and then sometimes it is told to them, it comes to
them, very many never have it brought in to them a very great many
of them, some of them have it brought in to them and some of such
of them have their lives broken are made sick men then and all this
is very common, this is the being in very many millions of every
kind of men and this is interesting and this is soon to be a
history of Alfred Hersland and his connection with the family of
Mr. Henry Dehning.</p>

<p>It is very perplexing the generalised conception which is of
virtue in many men and many women and the concrete feeling that is
not of virtue in them. This is perplexing, one comes then to
understand this thing as a complete thing and then always it is a
shock to that one as in living cases of this always are being
thrust upon that one. Some one builds up convictions from some
other one, some know then that they do not believe that thing and
some do it then because it is a pleasant thing, some do it to
please some one, some begin to believe it and then they lose it and
they don't say anything, some begin not to believe and then they
come when they are older ones to believe what they began with as
not believing but saying it to please some one, very many then in
very many ways have other ones convictions come to be the
determining frame for them, some believing it then, some who are
not believing it then, very many who do not know then whether they
do or do not believe that thing. This is a common thing, very many
men do it, very many men do it because they are in it, very many
men do it, for very many women, for some women, very many men do it
for men and for women, and for other women, and for children, very
many do it for very many, very many do it for some, very many do it
for some one, very many do it for themselves in their living. There
are very many women there are very many men who are always saying
if they had their life to live again they would live a different
one, they would learn very many things, they would do serious
reading. There are very many who always are going to be doing more
serious reading, more staying at home of an evening.</p>

<p>It is certain that many men and many women, very many of them
have a generalised conception of being which is them and concrete
feeling and acting in them that is very often, sometimes always in
them that is a very different thing to others from them in them to
them.</p>

<p>Sensitiveness, measure, kinds in men and women, cowardice and
courage, kinds of sensitiveness in them, originality and
personality in them, generalised and concrete feelings and
thinkings and activities in them this is all really very enormously
interesting.</p>

<p>Every one, every kind of one, they are there living, each one
having in him, each one having in her, each one having their own
being, every one, every kind of one. I am realising the whole of
human being. They are all each one of them themselves inside them,
each one is of a kind in men and women. Each one is a whole one,
each one has all there is of their own being sometime in them, each
one always is repeating the being of them, always, and all of them
are each one of them themselves each one, their own selves in them
and always each one is of a kind of them and always more and more
in every kind of living, in every kind of country, climate,
civilization, always always there are the kinds of them the same
kinds of them and some of each kind of them are very strong ones,
and some are very weak ones, and some of each kind of them are in
some kinds of ways leaders and some of each kind of them are mostly
always following, and always each one of them have their own being
in them and some of each kind of them are very good ones, some good
enough ones, some pretty good ones, some pretty bad ones, some of
each kind of them are very bad ones and always each kind of them
have their own way of thinking, feeling, loving, talking, laughing,
eating, drinking, fighting, pleasing, disliking, beginning and
ending. Often there are very much mixings of kinds of them in very
many of them but always there are very many of each kind of them
pretty completely only their kind of them and some kinds of them I
know very well in living, some I don't know so quite completely in
them the being in them, some I am only beginning knowing, very many
kinds of them are to me now then very puzzling, and always always
always, there are the same kinds of them having in them their way
of eating, drinking, sleeping, loving, hating, wakening,
understanding, sensitiveness in realising anything, realising
something, dullness, stupid being in them, quickness and slowness
in them, suffering, enduring, quarrelling, agreeing, everything, in
them everything, there are then these certain kinds in men in women
and always then they are existing and there are very very very many
men and very very very very many women always existing, each one
having their own being in them and there are then a number of kinds
of them but not such a great many kinds of them and sometime there
will surely then be written a complete description of all the kinds
there are of men and women.</p>

<p>There are then kinds in men and women. Some of each of the kinds
of being there are existing have it in them that they have very
greatly sensitiveness in realising, of their kind of being. Some of
each kind of them have almost nothing in them of the kind of
sensitiveness in realising of their kind of them and some of such
of them, not having in them any sensitive realising of their kind
of them can have it in them very excellent thinking, very solid
fighting of their kind of them and many of such of them of such a
kind of them are to very many greater men than those having
sensitive realising of their kind of them, they are then many of
such of them to very many of them that know them geniuses without
weakness in them, these then are the very strongest thing that
there can be of schoolmen, of followers who to very many are real
leaders in living, in thinking, in feeling. George Dehning was such
a kind of one and in the history of David Hersland there will be so
very much description of every kind of a way men can have their
kind of being in them.</p>

<p>The thing that is the important thing now in this part of the
long history of a family's being is the kind of being in Alfred
Hersland and in Mr. Henry Dehning. The thing that is the important
thing to be understanding is being good in being and in living. To
begin then now about being a good one, about all the kinds of ways
of being a good one men and women have in them, all the kinds of
ways I can think about them now in writing and the funny ways it
can come out of many of them.</p>

<p>Being good in living is something, it is in some way mostly in
every one, it is a very peculiar thing sometimes, and sometimes not
a very peculiar thing. Being good in living is certainly a very
important thing, it is in some way mostly in every one, in some way
in very many women and in very many men it makes them what they are
in living, it makes very many what they are to every one and to
themselves in all their living. Being in some ways a good one is
very common, it is a very common thing, it is in some way in very
many men and in very many women.</p>

<p>Being good then is a thing about which there will now be very
much writing. I have been already describing quite a number of ways
men and women have it in them to be good ones in their feeling and
their thinking and their being, in themselves to themselves, in
themselves to other ones, to many other ones, to a few other ones,
to every one that knows them, to hardly any one, to almost not any
one, to one, to more than one. Being good then is a thing that is
very interesting. Being good is a thing that is very often puzzling
to very many having it in them, to very many men and women, being
good is very often to very many not at all puzzling, there has been
some description of some kinds of ways of having goodness in them
in some men and women already given. Now there will be a new
beginning of understanding this very interesting thing.</p>

<p>Kinds of being in women and in men is a peculiar thing. Kinds of
being in men and women is peculiar, that there are always the same
kinds of them existing is a peculiar thing. It is extraordinary the
kind of things people are thinking, believing and feeling, always
very often each one is thinking feeling believing something,
sometimes they can afterwards be changing in that thinking,
feeling, believing, knowing, but always very often no one, not
anyone, not anything can change that thinking feeling believing
knowing in them and the thing they are thinking believing, feeling
or knowing is a thing that very many men and women like them are
certain no one could possibly be ever thin king feeling believing
knowing, and this is the peculiar thing that makes living the thing
we are all doing, this understanding this realisation that other
ones really have such kinds of thinking believing feeling knowing
as completely them this makes very many men and very many women
when they cannot change any one makes them then disillusioned in
their living some of them, some when they are young ones and that
is one kind of thing, some when they are older ones that is another
kind of thing. Kinds then in women and in men in men and women is a
peculiar thing. Yes certainly it is a peculiar thing, that and some
other things that are now beginning being written.</p>

<p>There are many ways of thinking, feeling, knowing, believing in
many men and women in all there ever are or were or will be of men
and women. There are very many of them, each one has her or his own
being in them, each one is of a kind or of several kinds in men and
women each one has their own nature in them, mostly every one,
always each one has many things in them are sometime are mostly
always believing knowing feeling many things in them that if the
others knowing really could really believe that these had in them
would make them think those others were really crazy ones. Mostly
very many all their living think other ones are not really feeling
thinking believing knowing doing the things those are really are
feeling believing thinking knowing doing, if they believed it of
them that they really are believing thinking feeling doing knowing
believing the things they really are believing knowing feeling
doing thinking they would think them to be really crazy ones and
they would be afraid of them.</p>

<p>There are many then believing thinking knowing feeling doing
things, mostly every one is feeling knowing thinking doing
something, doing feeling believing knowing thinking a very great
many things that if any one really knew it about them any one
knowing them would be thinking that one a crazy one, would be
afraid of such a one, and no one knowing that one is thinking such
a one really a seriously crazy one and that is because mostly every
one does not really believe any other one really believes thinks
knows feels does the thing, the many things that one really does
do, think, feel, believe, know in living. Sometimes it is a funny
thing to know it about some one the things they really can know and
feel and believe and do and think in them, sometimes it is a very
puzzling sometimes it is a very frightening thing, sometimes it is
an impossible thing and mostly every one is contenting themselves
with feeling that that other one is not really feeling thinking
doing knowing believing the thing the things they are doing knowing
believing or thinking that they never did have such things in them
that they are just talking that it is really all different in them.
One once who was a very intelligent active bright well-read fairly
well experienced woman thought that what happens every month to all
women, she thought it only happened to Plymouth Brethren, women
having that religion. She was a child of Plymouth Brethren and had
only known very intimately Plymouth Brethren women. She had known
other women but it had not happened to her to have known about this
thing. She was a child of Plymouth Brethren and she thought that
what happens to all women every month only happened to Plymouth
Brethren women, women having that religion, she was twenty eight
years old when she learned that it happened to every kind of women.
This is not an astonishing thing that she should have believed this
thing. Every one mostly always is thinking feeling believing
knowing something that is to every one else when they know it about
them a thing no one that was not a crazy one would be thinking
feeling believing or knowing. Mostly every one can be content with
being certain that the other one never did believe that thing.</p>

<p>There are a very great many men and women and they are very well
educated intelligent ones who are very certain that a river can not
flow north because water can never be going up hill in a natural
way of flowing. They are very certain of this thing and when one
understands it about them, some of them, it is astonishing that
they can really be thinking such a thing and sometimes it takes
almost a quarrelling to make them realise that a river can How
north and that north is not going up hill. They are knowing then
that north is not going up hill when they think of it as
travelling, they think of north as up hill when they think of it as
water flowing and this is very common. Such things then are very
common, every kind of way there ever can be of thinking feeling
believing knowing doing is common and the way mostly every one has
it in them the way one has it in them of knowing feeling, believing
thinking doing is a thing that every one knowing that one if they
really thought that one was really believing feeling thinking
knowing doing as that one really is, was and will be thinking
feeling doing believing knowing would be thinking that one a crazy
one, that one a fool, that one a liar and a bad one, would be
afraid or haling or despising or pitying that one or completely
puzzled by that one. Mostly then no one really is ever believing
any other one really can be believing feeling thinking doing
knowing, the things the other one really is feeling believing
thinking doing knowing.</p>

<p>Kinds of being in women and in men is a peculiar thing, that
there are always the same kinds of them existing is a peculiar
thing. That there are so very many always existing of each kind of
them is a peculiar thing. That there are so very many always
existing of every kind of them is a peculiar thing. When one sees a
very great many of any thing, if it is jewels, or exotic fruits or
old furniture or any precious thing in any place then always one is
thinking they must be cheap there, they have so many of them it
must be that they are selling them cheap they have so many of them
and one mostly always has this feeling and this is the kind of
feeling very many men and women have about men and women, there are
so many they must be cheap things and one can use them any way one
can be wanting them without any thinking about them and this is a
very natural thing and then when it is a store and one wants to buy
the rare thing or something where they have so many of them and
then one finds out one has to pay them the same as in the stores
where there are only a few of these things that they have for
selling and that is always astonishing, that is to some always a
certain shock to them and this is now beginning to be very true of
men and women everywhere where men and women are living, they come
just as high where there are a great many of them as where there
are a few of them. But this is another thing, always to my feeling
there are a very great many men and women always existing, always
to my feeling there are a very great many of each kind of them
always existing, always to my feeling each one of them is an
expensive thing to be learning to be understanding and now I begin
again.</p>

<p>I will now begin a little the writing about goodness and
religion and sensitiveness and feeling and loving, and realising
and under standing and thinking and doing and knowing in every one,
in every kind there is in men and women.</p>

<p>One builds up other people's convictions, other people's
intuitions other people's loving and virtue and religion, this is a
very common thing. Some build up other ones convictions, other
one's intuitions, other ones loving and virtue and religion, this
is a very common thing. Very many men do it for very many women,
very many women do it for men, and for other women, and for
children, very many men do it for very many children, very many men
do it for very many men, very many do it for themselves in their
living, very many women, very many men do it for themselves in
their living do the creating of their intuitions, their
convictions, their loving, their virtue, their religion.</p>

<p>It is very interesting the way it happens sometimes. Some one
one is loving tells one to do something to do it very often and
then the one loving that one knows it then will know where the one
told to do it does that thing, the other one who is to be doing
that thing is not in the beginning certain that the one loving that
one knows it when that one does that thing, the thing the other one
loving that one tells that one to do very often for the one loving
and that one then not with that one doing that thing will know that
that one is doing that thing. It happens then very often that in
the beginning the one doing the thing the one loving them is asking
of them so that the other one not being with her or him then will
know that he or she is then doing that thing it happens very often
that the other one that is asked to be doing a thing is not then
certain that the other one the one that has the believing that the
other one doing that thing that one will be knowing then when that
one is not with that other one who is doing a thing, it happens
very often that in the beginning the one of whom the doing has been
asked by the other one the one certain that he or she will be
knowing it when he or she is not with that one it happens very
often that in the beginning the one not certain that the other will
know it does it with a different feeling, does it with a very
careful feeling then and later then when that one is certain that
the other one is not certain when that one has been doing that
thing because of tests such a one has been making it happens
sometimes such a one goes on carefully doing that thing religiously
doing that thing would be a way of stating it then for it would
then be a ritualistic thing and there are others who would not let
themselves ever test such a thing but go on always doubting but
always more or less doing the thing, not from the loving in them
but from the belief in them built up so in them that the other one
really has intuition and that is the way it goes very often with
having intuition, always then some one gives to some one conviction
of intuition, some give it to themselves in living, very often
others give it to them, there are then very many men and women and
some of them have more some less sensitiveness in them and always
it is hard to tell it of them of men and women what is
sensitiveness in them what is made inside them by themselves by
every one they are knowing in their living.</p>

<p>Dead is dead. To be dead is to be really dead said one man and
there are very many men who really feel this in them, to be dead is
to be really dead and that is the end of them. To be dead is to be
really dead and yet perhaps that is not really the end of them,
some men feel this in them. Dead is dead yes dead is really dead
yes to be dead is to be really dead yes, to be dead is to be really
dead and that is the real ending of them yes, but still, yes to be
dead is to be dead, to be really dead yes, and yet always there is
religion always existing and it is better to have everything, to be
dead is to be dead some men are feeling knowing thinking believing
in them, very many men are feeling thinking knowing believing it in
them and some of them some of such of them have it in them that
they know that religion is always existing, dead is dead, that they
know pretty entirely completely really in them yes dead is dead
they really know that in them, religion always is existing, dead is
dead yes that is true then, and then they go on in living always
doing their religion. Dead is dead yes that is certain and they go
on having their religion and they are not believing and their
religion is believing that dead is not dead, to be dead is to be
not really dead, dead is dead of that they are really certain some
of these then and they go on then having their religion doing
everything in their religion and to their religion to be dead is
not to be really dead of that their religion is almost certain and
they are almost certain in them always that to be dead is to be
really dead, yes dead is dead they know that in them, they know
that in them, they do everything any one can do in their religion
and their religion is very certain that to be dead is not to be
really dead and these men are very certain that to be dead is to be
dead, that dead is dead. This then is very common. There are these
then and there are then those that have it in them in living that
dead is dead only partly in them and in them is the very constant
realisation that every one, they themselves, are believing that
religion is a right thing to be having and religion is always
saying though you are dead you are living and these then could know
it as an active living in them that dead is dead, that is in
instinctive living in them but always in their talking, very many
of them always in their feeling, some of them always in their
doing, some of them in their thinking, some of them always in their
believing have it in them that every one has religion in living,
they have religion in them, dead is not dead then everybody is of
this then very certain and always dead is dead is the simply
instinctive living in these men then and very many of these then
have it in them that they are those having concrete action that is
very often very different from what these are certain all decent
men and they themselves are always doing, these then can as I was
saying kill the butterfly in the morning because they are so good
to their son when in the evening just before they completely
persuaded him the son that killing butterflies is a cruel action no
good man should be doing, and some of such of them as I was saying
can have it in them that they have done something very often and
later in their living a daughter can write to them that what that
daughter is doing that is a disgrace to the family then came to be
a way of doing from the things the father was often showing to her
when she was a young one and such a one then can have a paralytic
stroke from the shock of realisation, of dead is dead and that by
religion to his saying that dead is not dead and of the difference
in him of general and concrete conviction.</p>

<p>There are a very great many then that have as a concrete
realisation always in them that dead is dead, that things are as
they see them, that they are doing things when they are doing them
and these then can have it in them that they realise as a
generalisation that to be dead is not to be so very really dead,
that things are not perhaps what they are to them, that they are
living with other men around them who have it in them to have
religion in them which is certain that to be dead is not to be a
really dead one and these then have it in them to equilibrate
themselves to this opinion, the opinion the conviction of being not
dead when they are dead of having virtue in them when they are not
doing any good thing of never doing anything any good man cannot be
doing when really they are doing that thing very often and this is
a generalised sense in them all through their living and always
then they are really living the dead is dead living as a concrete
living. To some having this equilibrating, this generalised
conception is only sentimental in them, in some it is a way of
being important to themselves inside them to make it strongly in
them this generalised equilibration in them, to very many it is a
very simple thing of being like every one for every one to mostly
any one is like this in their living is being of a conviction that
dead is not really dead, that good is progressing, that every one
is a good one in some way of endeavoring. This is a very common
thing then and always and always it will in its simple in its
complicated forms will be interesting, will be illuminating in the
being and the living of Alfred Hersland and Mr. Herman Dehning and
his son George Dehning.</p>

<p>Explaining ones vices by ones virtues is one way of feeling,
thinking, believing, knowing, thinking believing, feeling, knowing
oneself inside one in living. This is a very different thing from
that which I have been just describing as sometimes perplexing, as
very common, the generalised conception which is of virtue in many
men and many women and the concrete feeling and acting that is not
of virtue in them. Explaining ones vices by ones virtues then is
one way of feeling thinking knowing believing the being inside in
one different from that I have been just describing, different from
the being in Redfern which I was once describing which was as I was
then saying was an explaining ones virtues by the vices in them.
There is then explaining ones virtues by ones vices and others then
explain their vices by the virtues in them. There are certainly a
very great many ways of having virtuous feeling in them in men and
women and yet after all there are not such a very great many ways
of them, there are a good many ways though and this is now some
more description of virtuous feeling, being, thinking, knowing
believing, in men and in women. Later then there will be very much
discussion of different kinds of sensibility and way of having it
in them in men and women.</p>

<p>A man having it in him to have the generalised conviction of
good being as completely him and the concrete acting of being a
mean spirited and tyrannical man in living and always taking
everything he can that it is not dangerous for him to be taking and
never giving anything that is not taken from him, one of such a
kind of them can have it in him to be always speaking and very
often in his talking it comes out again and again that he is a good
man, and a noble man, and a very angry one whenever any one ever is
doing anything that he knows of them that is not a fine action a
good generous way of doing, thinking, believing, feeling and
sometime perhaps some one might say to him a sister-in-law or a
brother-in-law of him, of such a one, why did you do that mean
thing to that man, and he would then say to such a one, because he
was such a mean man he deserved all I could give him to get the
best of him, and then the brother-in-law or the sister-in-law might
say then to him, but you say you are such an awfully good man how
could such a good man as you are do such a mean thing to any one,
and then such a one would be answering, a good man could do such a
thing to another mean man, didn't I do that thing to that mean kind
of a man and don't you know don't every one always know it in him
that I am a good man, you know that, and then there would be no
answer that could touch him. Such men are very common, they are
very often not full up with religion these are good men that is the
conviction that is the feeling of themselves inside them to
themselves in them, that is the complete being in them to
themselves completely in all the believing, feeling, doing,
thinking ever in them. These then are not being good in the name of
god or in the conviction of religion, they never do a bad thing in
secret as some do who are good men in the name of religion or
virtue or of god can do it and then not be letting their right hand
know what their left hand is doing, no, such a one as I have been
describing has it as a completed generalised conviction his own
virtue as him and is himself completely constantly himself to
himself in his being, has the complete thing of being important in
all living from the completed realisation that he is completely a
good noble generous human being and such a one never has any need
of any secret action, such a one tells every one everything he does
in living, any mean thing, any bad thing, anything, for always it
is there completely in him that he did this thing and a good man
could, would, does do that thing, he did that thing, he a good man
who never does anything he should not be doing did this thing does
something and so it is right for him to do that thing and he can
tell it as a thing he was proud to do in living, everything he ever
does in living is a thing he is proud to be telling to every one,
he is completely a good man, he has no need of secret living,
everything he is ever doing is a thing he can be boasting he was
doing for he is completely a good man, he is not a good man in the
name of religion of god or of his country or of his profession, he
is a good man completely a good one to himself inside him, that is
important being in him, that is his being to himself inside him,
that is all being in him, he is the complete thing of a generalised
conviction of virtuous being.</p>

<p>All these kinds of ways then of having virtuous being, feeling,
thinking, believing, doing, knowing inside in one are very
interesting to be describing, studying, realising, understanding.
It makes then one way of realising kinds in men and women the
realising of the different ways different ones have virtuous
feeling in them. I have already been describing some of them, I
will now be describing others of them.</p>

<p>Many have virtuous feeling from something inside them. Many need
company to have it, this is very common. Many need a leader for it,
this is in very many women and very many men. Some need drama to
support it, some need lying to help it, some always need to leave
out something in their telling anything to have it, some need
always to leave out something in their feeling, in their doing, in
their knowing, in their realising, in their believing, and they
have it mostly in them, some need always to leave out pieces of
everything they have in them to make for themselves the complete
creation of virtuous being of themselves to themselves inside them.
Many have virtuous feeling about something inside them. Some need
drama to support it, some need lying to help it, some need company
to feel it, some love it when they have it, some do not then love
it, some hate it, some are it, some are burdened with it, some
enjoy it, some never are very certain they really ever have it.
Virtuous feeling in men and women is what I am now a little
describing.</p>

<p>Some then and these are now another kind of them from any I have
been describing, some then have an ideal in them and always they
poetically, romantically, dramatically, idealistically,
sentimentally conceive themselves as doing that thing and they are
not good at inventing and they are always doing everything and they
leave out mostly everything in telling anything and they are always
then very fond of telling this thing and so they have it in them to
be idealistically, romantically, sentimentally, dramatically one
thing and that is always in them an ideal thing. These then are
such ones as would have it in them to be to themselves supposing it
is a chaste one or a forgiving one that kind of one completely in
them. Being with them, knowing them, some of them, it is climbing
mountains for always when you are thinking you have heard the whole
thing about the ideal they are to themselves in themselves to every
one a new peak comes up behind and you begin again climbing, they
are not really chaste then such a one yes that is certain they will
sometime tell that thing but the claim then comes from a new kind
of relation in them that is a real one of a completely chaste
thing, they violate that one and then a new one is to them the
complete thing of idealistic romantic chastity for them and always
in their telling they leave out everything that can destroy the
truth of the latest idealistic chastity in them, and then every one
knows of that new violation and they are then creating a new
idealism and again they are telling everything with leaving out in
their telling, feeling, thinking, believing anything that shows
another violation they have been making of their idealistic
conception, and these then go on and they go on and everybody
laughs about them that such a one should have idealistic romantic
conceptions of chaste being and always this one has a new one and
always this one then in telling is leaving out everything that
tells the last violation of the latest idealistic romantic dramatic
conception of chaste being and these then are lying but not by
invention but by idealistic romantic dramatic sentimental omission
and that is then very amusing and I know just now several of such a
kind of them and everybody can laugh at them sometime.</p>

<p>This happens very often with very many in loving, they are
explaining that with that last one they were not real in loving,
this they are now doing is really loving, always before they have
not been really loving that is certain, this is very common in
loving, it is very common very often in women, it is very common it
is very often in men in their real feeling, in their real thinking,
it is very common in men and women it is very common in loving in
women and in men it is very common in loving often in men and
women.</p>

<p>Another form of having virtuous feeling is thinking what any one
is doing is only a habit in them, and this is pretty common in men,
quite common in men and in women.</p>

<p>This way of feeling then is that not any one is really a bad one
that is hardly any one, mostly every one does a thing because it is
a habit and all that they need then is to change their habit to
some other thing, some other way of doing that thing doing
something and that one will be a good one. This is fairly common in
men and women this way of having a feeling about virtue in other
ones and in themselves then, in some it is stronger in beginning,
when they are young, but in very many having this kind of
conception it is in them all through their living. They are not
actually ever changing the habits they have in them neither is any
other one they are knowing but that does not affect their
conviction that doing bad things is only a habit in themselves and
in every one, and this is indeed quite common in men and in
women.</p>

<p>Another very common way of having virtuous feeling about oneself
inside one is from having always the sense of being oneself inside
one and so one oneself doing something does it, a wrong thing, with
a different feeling from any other one and so it is not really then
a wrong thing. This is very common even with many women many men
who have not much personality in them, who do such very bad things
as a regular way of living that no one not knowing would ever think
it of them that they know it in them that they themselves inside
them with the feeling of themselves inside them made it that the
wrong things they were doing were not so bad as when other ones did
that wrong thing. They are themselves inside them, they feel
themselves inside them, each one of them and so then the things
they are doing are personal things, not mercenary, vulgar things
like those the other ones doing the same things are doing. This is
very common in women, this is very common in men, each man mostly
each woman mostly has a feeling of their own being, of being
themselves inside them in them and that in itself makes each one
doing something less bad in doing that thing than any other one
doing that thing. A man painting, a painter exhibiting has such
feeling. A painter was saying that exhibitions are so disgusting
because just looking one sees that all the pictures are bad and
that is disgusting, one's own pictures are hanging there and one
looking at them and realising that they are bad things knows by
remembering how each one of them happened to come to be not a good
one and that then makes it alright for there are reasons that one's
own pictures are not good ones while with all the others they are
bad ones and that's all there is to them, there are not reasons to
explain them to the feeling of any one looking at them and this is
a very common way of having a conviction of virtue in them in a
wonderfully large number of men and women.</p>

<p>There are others who build it up in pieces the virtuous being
the virtuous feeling in them, slowly they build it up in living,
slowly carefully and always they are adding, piece alter piece is
being added by them to make sometime pretty completely a whole
thing and some of these are very good ones indeed in living and
some are not such very good ones, but very many of them are very
good ones in living. Some of such of them may have many other
things in them that are not such good things in them but these do
not affect the good thing of them, the good part of them, the
virtuous being in them that these are steadily building up in them
by steady adding, sometimes quickly sometimes slowly but always,
mostly always, very often safely, completely safely in them. There
are so many of them then men and women that have virtuous feeling
in them, important being in them from virtuous feeling in them that
it is a large undertaking to understand it and realise it and
describe it and I am now not any longer beginning the doing this
thing.</p>

<p>There are some who have very much virtuous feeling virtuous
being in them, some who have not so much virtuous being virtuous
feeling in them, some who have very little, some who have hardly
any and some who have not any interest in any such a thing.</p>

<p>Some have virtuous feeling in them from having in them concrete
and generalised virtue always really in them. Some have virtuous
feeling in them from having in them concrete and generalised virtue
almost always really in them. Some have virtuous feeling in them
from having in them concrete and generalised virtue very often
really in them. Some have virtuous feeling in them from having in
them concrete and generalised virtue sometimes really in them. Some
have virtuous feeling in them from having in them concrete and
generalised virtue sometime really in them.</p>

<p>There are lots more ways of having virtuous feeling in one than
these that I have been describing. I am keeping them back now from
crowding on me, slowly they will come to me and out from me, this
has been a description of a few of them and there are lots of them
but I have been already describing a good many of them and always I
am understanding women and men more and more by listening to them
as in repeating it comes out of them the telling by them of how
goodness is in them even in those who never are really talking
about any such a thing. Always sometime it comes out of every one
the way they have virtuous feeling in them and always more and more
to me it is interesting.</p>

<p>It is very perplexing the generalised conception which is of
virtue in many men and many women and the concrete feeling and
acting that is not of virtue in them. This is perplexing, this is
sometimes not at all perplexing, mostly it is perplexing always to
the families of them, those knowing always the kind of them, this
kind in men and women. Alfred Hersland will soon then be
interesting. There will soon be a description of him begun.</p>

<p>There are many ways of being and of loving and of winning and of
losing, and having honor in them, and horror of something, and
religion in them and virtuous feeling being believing and thinking
in them from the nature of them when this is strong enough in them
to make their own in men and women. Sometimes some one to every one
is strong enough to make his own or her own living thinking feeling
being loving, horror, working and religion and virtuous feeling and
this is not then true of that one, this one is one having
anticipating suggestion and then being like a resounding board to
the suggestion they were anticipating and so giving it forth then
so that to themselves then and mostly to every one they are strong
to do their own living, to make their own opinion and virtue and
working and thinking and loving and religion and this will soon now
be some description of such a one. Some then can make their own
honor, and virtue and work and thinking and loving and religion.
Some can make their own horror, some their own loving, some their
own religion, some are weak and can do one thing their own, some
are strong enough and all of it is some one else's thinking,
feeling, doing, religion, virtue in them, they are strong enough
men and women. There are some can just resist and not make their
own anything. Some out of their own virtue make a god who sometimes
later is a nuisance to them, a terror perhaps to them, a difficult
thing to be forgetting. Some are controlled by other's virtue and
religion and that scares them, it is a superstition to them and
always after it is a scared part of them. Some like religion, some
forget it, some are it, some have a prejudice against it. There are
many who love themselves enough to not want to lose themselves from
living, to not want other people, existence to lose them, to very
many women, to very many men this comes to be as a religion in
them, this makes religion a real thing to them. Some love
themselves so much immortality can have no meaning for them, the
younger David Hersland was such a one, there will be a long history
of him sometime written. Some love themselves negatively and they
like thinking about immortal living. Some love themselves or other
ones so forcibly in them that death can have no meaning as an
ending, these are then certain of existing, these then are made to
have religion, that is certain, some do not have it then in them,
really they are certain that every one is continuing, they may not
know it as religion, they mostly all of them sometime know it in
them. Some love themselves so completely or some other one that
they think they exist when they don't, will exist when they won't,
are in communication with them when they certainly are not, some of
these do not make it as a religion, they have it as a conviction as
a certainty in them, these have a future life feeling in their
present living. This is pretty common. Some have fervent loving in
them for themselves or some one with very much fear in them and
some of such of them have religion in them and very many of such of
them have none.</p>

<p>This is now to be a little a very little description of some
having in her or in him the feeling of original creation from
anticipated suggestion and the way virtue then is in them, in such
of them. Then there will be a beginning of the being in Alfred
Hersland after this little description which has not much to do
with anything but is to me interesting has been made, as I was just
saying.</p>

<p>Some have very much sensitive being in them, very many have
sensitive being as creative activity in them, very many have it as
an instrument nature in them, some of them have it so that they can
be almost creative by resonating, resoundingly anticipating another
one's suggestion before that suggestion comes as a completion and
such then are often for the very longest kind of time really
puzzling as having in them sensitiveness to the creation of real
personality in them as original activity in them and these very
often have it in them that they are intelligent and so can reflect
and then reflect about the thing they are creating from
anticipation of the suggesting of other one's to them, they are
quicker, these then, quicker really than chain lightning and
sometimes for a very long time these are confusing. Sometimes these
then can be understood by one when one realises of them that they
are as greatly one thing as any other thing if the proper influence
has come into the circle of their living and that never to
themselves when they are beginning a new thing did the other thing
the last thing they were creating, the last kind of thing they were
doing completely express the personality of them to their thinking,
such of them are never failing in anything, they are always
succeeding, later they are always certain they have not completely
expressed the personality in them in the last thing they were
doing, they are now completely expressing the personality in them
and then later in remembering they know they have not completely
expressed the personality in them and always in each kind of thing
they are doing they are succeeding, they are never stopping doing
the last thing because they are tired of doing that thing, they are
beginning a new thing without really leaving the last thing; in
their generalised living, slowly every one can come to know it of
them they are not really original in inspiration, it comes then
that it is change but not an evolution of them everything, there is
no generalised conception that forms itself from them in them, they
may be fairly successful in living they may not be successful in
living, always then they are quicker than chain lightning really in
their sensitive being.</p>

<p>The weakness of the being in them may come to be clear from the
virtue feeling in them, from religion in them, from the way they
need for that always to have company around them, this is
generalised being in them and they need close company around them
to support them, they cannot for this do concrete working that
gives to every one the illusion that inspiration is inside them.
This is pretty clear to my thinking, not completely clear yet and I
am now telling it here to a little rid myself of it and to begin
again to think and feel about it. Sometime I will have to do much
more realising, understanding the sensitive being in men and women,
it is a completely necessary thing and I am always working and
thinking and feeling and I will not now say any more about this
thing, this is enough now and I have been relieving myself enough
now of my wisdom.</p>

<p>Perhaps this description that I have been just making has a
little after all to do with something in this writing. This then
and other things that have been written have something to do with
preparing the understanding of myself then and some others perhaps
then for the being in Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>There must be much alternating all through in this writing of
preparing to be describing Alfred Hersland and the living in him
and Julia Dehning who came later to be marrying him. These two then
will be mostly all of them in this part of this writing and always
I am alternating between them and always a little preparing
understanding one and a little preparing understanding the other
one and so sometime perhaps everything will come to be showing
something and that will be then a happy ending of all this
beginning.</p>

<p>Sensitive being is completely interesting. It will sometime be a
long book that one when everything is written about sensitive being
and kinds of it and the meaning of it in every man and every woman.
Sometime it must be done for so only can there be written a history
of every one.</p>

<p>All this describing then of virtuous being, feeling, knowing,
thinking, in men and in women makes it right now to begin the
complete understanding and description of the living and the being
in Alfred Hersland and every one important in his living.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland, the kind he is of human beings is to me very
clear just now very clear inside me as grown up men and women, I
have very many of the kind that are his kind of them now in me, I
am mostly now completely filled up with that kind of them, that
kind in men and women, with many individual ones of them, with many
women of that kind of them with many men of that kind of them, I am
just now very completely full up with the kind Alfred Hersland is
in being, with men and women very many of them of that kind of
them, with many of them, one just like him, that is all of him in
my imagining, with some a little more one kind a little more
another kind, with many who are of the same kind as he is among men
and women but very different from him, I am full up very full up
now with a whole large group who are all more or less connected in
kind with him, with Alfred Hersland as he is completely now inside
him, a complete one, I have then so many men and women in me now
who are of his kind in men and women and they are in me now, I am
completely full up with them now, completely filled up with them
filled up with them as men and women, all full up with that kind of
men and women and I must now begin again and slowly live it in them
the beginning of them, I am filled up quite entirely filled up
quite full up with the kind of them with all the varieties of them
of this kind of them as men and women as women and men, I am all
completely quite completely full up with this kind of them in men
and women and all the kinds of them connected with this kind of
them, I am completely now pretty nearly entirely now full up with
many men and many women and all of this kind of them the kind of
which Alfred Hersland is one, completely filled up with them but
only as completely men and women, I must a little now be filled up
full with them with these then as beginning as children, I must be
completely full with them and I must be full up with them too as
children and I am now beginning a little to fill up with them as
children, I am filled up full with them as young men, young women,
as very young men and very young women, as older men and older
women, as growing old men and growing old women, as old men and old
women as dying and dead ones, I am then pretty completely entirely
filled up full with this kind of them with very many men and women
with complete men and complete women with this kind in men and
women the kind of which Alfred Hersland is one and of kinds closely
connected in character with his kind of them, I am very full then
of his kind in men and women, I am very fairly full of a kind of
them he will have one of as marrying him, the kind there is in
Julia Dehning which is a very different kind from his kind of them,
I am fairly full of the Julia Dehning kind of them as children, as
completely men and women, I am very completely full then, I am
quite completely full of the kind there is of men and women of
which Alfred Hersland is one and now I am waiting to be a fuller
one, I am waiting to be a completely full one, I am waiting to be
full up with that kind of them all there are of that kind of them
as children and I am now as I am saying waiting.</p>

<p>To begin again with Mr. Hissen the grandfather of Alfred
Hersland. This one was as I was saying a man having it in him that
he was really all that there was of religion, he was a man as I was
saying a man completely being that thing to himself inside him, a
man living that thing completely every moment in his living, a man
holding them as part of him his wife and children to be a part of
him when they were in the house with him, and he was all there was
of religion, when they had left him for their own living they were
then not any longer in him part of him, he was then again all there
was of religion, he was a man then having a connection with such as
those I was describing who have it to be completely to themselves
that they are completely a good one only those that I have been
describing have it in them to have concrete living in them and
generalised conviction of themselves besides in them and seeing
themselves in the light of the generalisation and the
generalisation comes from the conviction of being that is not in
concrete existing really in them, in Mr. Hissen then it was a
different thing, his generalisation was a complete generalisation
from the complete feeling acting being thinking in him, he was
completely then all that there was of religion, he was living
knowing being thinking feeling believing that he was himself all
that there was of religion and he was concretely living every
minute in this being and concrete and generalised being was the
same being in him and he did not think that when lie would be dead
he would be living, dead was dead to him and religion was living to
him but not living when he was no longer a live one, he was in
himself all that there was of religion, dead is dead, he was very
certain, religion was not in him a contradiction of this thing,
religion was him, he was all that there was of religion, religion
was all that there was of religion, he was it so completely in him
that he was not ever judging any one, not himself, not any one, he
was himself to himself inside him, he was all there was of
religion, he was alive when he was living and was then all there
was of religion, he held his children there when they were living
in the house with him, when they had left him they were no longer
in him of him, he was not then ever judging any of them, when he
was alive he was to himself completely living completely religion,
when he would be dead he would be a dead one he could not have any
fear in him, he was a completely whole one then, there was not in
him any contradiction between being a dead one a really dead one
and religion, he was in himself all that there was of religion, he
lived completely the living of being completely himself all there
was of religion, he was so, not ever judging any one not himself
not any one not his children, they were him when they were part of
him, they were not him when they were not a part of him and that
made him a complete thing always in living, generalised and
concrete living, feeling, being, knowing, thinking, believing, had
in him no complication, he was then the complete thing of being all
there was of religion, of being certain that to be a dead one was
to be really then a dead one, to have this in him as religion, to
be himself completely all there was of religion, to be living
concretely every moment every day his religion living concretely
and as a generalisation. This then is the being in Mr. Hissen who
was the grandfather of Alfred Hersland and this then is one of the
kind of them that one must be understanding to understand the being
in Alfred Hersland which I am hoping very soon now to be beginning
describing. This is one then, I will now describe others of this
family of kinds in men and women, for soon now I will describe
Alfred Hersland for I am completely always nearer understanding
that one and yet there are some difficulties that I am still
feeling and I am very full up now with this kind of them the Alfred
Hersland kind of them and still I am feeling some difficulties in
the completion, they are not yet to me all of them entirely
completely yet whole ones inside me, I am waiting and I am not yet
certain, I am not yet impatient yet in waiting, I am waiting, I am
not now again beginning, I do not feel that I need to be again
beginning, I am in the right direction, I am only now just needing
to be going, I am now only just waiting, I am going I think very
soon to be keeping on going, I have been describing Mr. Hissen
again the grandfather of Alfred Hersland, I will now tell a little
more of religious desiring in some of this kind of them, some who
have fear and idealisation in them, Mr. Hissen had not this in him,
dead was dead to him, religion was completely all him in him, he
was not judging any one, he had not any fear in him, he died of old
age when he came to be a dead one, to be dead was to be dead of
that he was very certain, he had not then any fear in him, he had
not in him ecstasy or idealisation, he had completion in him, he
had all that there was of religion for him in him, when he would be
a dead one he would be dead of that he was completely certain, he
was then a complete one, concrete and generalised conviction was
the same in him, he was the grandfather of Alfred Hersland, he was
one of one kind in men and women, I am now pretty settled in my
direction, I am still now waiting, I am still now not going on, I
am still now waiting and that is what I am now doing.</p>

<p>This then the being in Mr. Hissen the grandfather of the three
Hersland children is one way of having religion, feeling of virtue,
in one, it is an important thing to have it completely inside me
the feeling of religion in Mr. Hissen. It is pretty completely
inside me now and still a little I am waiting, I will now soon be
describing one who had another way of having religion, the complete
other extreme and still of the same kind of them as Mr. Hissen and
then I will be describing the in between kinds of them and so then
I will come again to Alfred Hersland. And all of these then are of
the resisting kind of them the dependent independent kind of them
and now then again a little I am beginning to be waiting. I will be
waiting quite a little now before I begin again.</p>

<p>There are some who naturally are knowing dead is dead but these
are not then certain that to be dead is to be a dead one. There are
many who are saying to be dead is to be a dead one but these then
are not very certain that to be dead is to be really a dead one.
There are some who are practically speaking completely certain that
to be dead is to be a really dead one but always these then are
afraid in living and always these then are a little afraid of being
a dead one, some then are very completely afraid of becoming a
really dead one some of these then are thinking feeling when they
are being completely afraid of being a completely dead one when
they will be dead ones that perhaps then to be dead is not to be
really a dead one, they knew it in them that to be dead is to be
completely entirely a dead one, these are certain then of this
thing and they are afraid then every moment in their living that it
will come to be in them that they will come to be a really dead one
and then many of these then have it in them as a fear in them that
to be a dead one is to be really a dead one and they know that is
really in them that to be dead is to be really a dead one and so
then they have it in them that they think they have it in them that
they are believing then that to be a dead one is not to be really a
dead one and then they do not know it in them whether that is
really a comforting thing to them, they do not know it in them
whether they are ever really thinking that to be a dead one is not
to be really dead then and these are not certain whether it is a
comfort to them any such a feeling and there they are then these
then full up then with fear inside them every kind of fear they can
possibly have then for they have it in them that to be dead is to
be a dead one and they have it in them to never to be wanting to be
such a kind of a really dead one and then they have it in them from
this fear in them coming out of this fear in them that they will
soon come to be a really dead one, that perhaps a dead one is not
really a dead one and then they have the fear in them of a dead one
not being then a really dead one and fear then is complicated in
them and there are a very considerable number of such of them
always existing and fear then makes of them that they have a
generalised conception that they have religion in them and virtuous
being in them and this is of the feeling in them that comes from
the reaction in them from the fear in them of being a really dead
one that perhaps being a dead one is not really being a really dead
one and always then these have in them as a continuous concrete
realisation and this is always being in them that to be dead is to
be completely really a dead one.</p>

<p>Some have it as a complete feeling in them that to be dead is to
be dead and this then a world without ending is in them for to be
dead is to be a dead one and so then not any thing to them has ever
any ending. Everything then to such of them is going on forever and
forever to them and always then to be a dead one is to be a dead
one and always then there is a continuing for ever and ever to such
of them of everything and so then to these of them there is no
ending of anything and living and being a dead one is to these then
the very same thing and to be a dead one is to be a dead one and to
be a living one a living one and to very many of these dead and
living are all one and these then have in them religion as being of
everything that is never ending and some of these then come to have
it in them this I am describing to be certain that to be dead is to
be a dead one and to be living is to be a living one and that
always everything is never ending, come then to have it in them as
loving being in them and these then can come to have it in them
that they are of them that have it to be of the kind of them that
own the thing they need for loving and so then these then having it
as loving in them that nothing is ever ending and to be dead is to
be a dead one and to be living is to be a living one and that
nothing is ever ending and have this in them as loving being and
own the thing they need for loving are very interesting in
religion.</p>

<p>All these then that I have been describing all these then all
these kinds of them that I have been describing I am thinking as of
the resisting kind in men and women, the dependent independent kind
of them.</p>

<p>These then some men and women always there are a good many of
these living who have it in them to have resisting being and some
way of feeling that to be a dead one is to be a dead one and have
in them religion from this thing mixed up with this thing in them,
these then that I have been describing are of the resisting kind in
men and women, they are of that kind of them that have loving in
them as resisting and owning those they need in loving not from
stubborn feeling not for attacking but from the dependent
independent right way of winning fighting. There are very many
kinds of this kind in men and women, some of each kind of all these
kinds of them have religion in them. Later after very much waiting
and very much history of Alfred Hersland has been written there
will be very much description of the way sensitiveness and religion
is in the attacking kind in men and women and this will be written
in the description of Julia Dehning who came to be marrying Alfred
Hersland as I have already very long ago been telling. There will
then be very much description of virtuous feeling and religion in
the description of Julia Dehning, of virtuous feeling and religion
in the attacking in the independent dependent kind in men and
women. There will be very much description of virtuous feeling
acting thinking being in the description of Mr. Henry Dehning and
of old men having it in them virtuous feeling being thinking There
will be a description of a kind of way of having virtuous feeling
in the description of Mr. Dehning. There will be a description of
George Dehning and the little one Hortense Dehning in the history
of the younger Hersland brother David Hersland. Now I am still
waiting to be beginning really beginning the history of Alfred
Hersland from the beginning of his living.</p>

<p>There have been then now, been in this description, the three
generations of men and women. There was then Mr. and Mrs. Hissen
and the old Mr. and Mrs. Hersland, there was then Mr. and Mrs.
David Hersland and these then had three children Martha and Alfred
and David and the history of Martha has been now already mostly
written, not completely altogether written but a good deal written
and now there will be beginning to be written the history of Alfred
Hersland and every one he ever came to know in his early living, in
his marrying and in his later living.</p>

<p>There was then Mr. Hissen and Mrs. Hissen and Alfred Hersland
had it in him to have a good deal in him Mr. Hissen being but it
was a very different thing in him this being in him than it was in
Mr. Hissen. Alfred never had in him at any time in him religion, he
was a mixture then of old Mr. Hissen and old Mr. Hersland who was a
butcher when he was a young man working and who was a man who had
important feeling in him from having been a little important then
in religion. Alfred Hersland then, to be certain of the being in
him, was of the resisting kind of them in men and women and now
then I will wait again and soon then I will be full up with him, I
am now then not completely full up with him. Now I am again
beginning waiting to be full up completely full up with him. I am
very considerably full up now with the kind of being in him, I will
be waiting and then I will be full up with all the being in him,
that is certain, and so then now a little again once more then I am
waiting waiting to be filled up full completely with him with all
the being ever in him.</p>

<p>There are then some living who are saying that to be a dead one
is to be really a dead one and these then are not very certain that
to be a dead one is to be really a dead one. They are then some who
have it in them that dead is dead and these then are not very
certain that to be dead is to be a dead one. There are then very
many who in living have it in them that dead is dead and these then
are not certain that to be a dead one is to be a really entirely
completely certainly altogether dead one. There are very many then
of these always living, perhaps Alfred Hersland was one of this
kind of them. Perhaps he is of this kind of men. Perhaps he is not
this kind of a one, not one of this kind of them of women and men.
Anyway this much is certain, he was of the resisting kind of them,
he is of the resisting kind of men, of the dependent independent
kind of them. He is certainly of the engulfing resisting kind in
men and women.</p>

<p>Of these Alfred Hersland was not really one, Julia Dehning was
of this kind of them. They can be either attacking or resisting
kind of them. There are some, indeed there are a very great many of
them, I know some of them always in living, there are many of them
some very successful in living some very brilliant in living, some
not successful in living, some of every kind of them as to
succeeding and failing, there are a very great number of them
always living women and men who have it that the being the root of
being in them is intensity of emotion and these then are doing,
feeling believing many things in living, some many things very
different from those other ones of that kind of them are feeling,
thinking and believing, many of them very different things from
what they have been and will be believing feeling thinking doing
knowing and always each thing any of these are feeling thinking
believing knowing doing is for them completely bathed and floated
by the intensity of emotion that is all being in them and these
have it that to themselves inside them they are deeply profoundly
moved by the thing and really then they are really profoundly moved
by the emotional intensity in them, not any thing in them, in those
of them that are completely this kind of them not anything they
ever are feeling thinking knowing believing doing in living has any
other value than any other thing they are ever feeling knowing
doing thinking believing for always all of the being in them is
intensity in emotion and very many of such of them have sometime
very strongly religion in them and mostly always virtuous feeling
in them, that is natural for them to be having in them as any one
understanding anything of human being certainly will be more or
less realising. These then and there are a very considerable number
always existing of them as I am saying are often succeeding very
well in living and are brilliant ones in living and some of them
are weak and stupid ones in living and there are all degrees in
between but always it is certain that these have in them emotional
intensity as being in them and often for a very long time they are
puzzling, they are often for long years puzzling to some one for it
is a very difficult thing to know it of them that not anything they
are ever feeling knowing thinking believing understanding is
profoundly in them when they are so completely moved and enveloped
by and enveloping that thing, it is a very puzzling thing very
often with these for they come so nearly to be original in living
feeling thinking being knowing believing and they are really not
then original ones and it is disconcerting for often one is a very
long time convinced by them by such of them who are so completely
themselves living by that thing in them then which is not them but
is sustained by the intensity of emotion which is the really truly
them. It is very certain that these then are very strong ones for
following in religion for being certain of virtue in them, these
must be that for otherwise they would know that they had not
originality in them, this will be all so very interesting when I am
going to be describing Julia Dehning, this is a completely
interesting thing but now there must be a beginning to the real
realisation in me of Alfred Hersland and his living, I have been
doing a very great deal of waiting, waiting is to me very
interesting for always something is coming or else nothing is
coming and there is eating, sleeping, laughing, living, talking and
a little tickling in the body and the mind then that is very
pleasant to any one liking waiting and then there is always the
drowsiness of going to be lively waking and all this is in me in
waiting and I like very well doing waiting and now perhaps a little
more I will be waiting but always I am a little near to beginning
and now once more again I am waiting and now I am contenting myself
again with waiting and that is a very pleasant feeling a pleasant
thing for any one content inside them with it in them.</p>

<p>I am always now feeling the temper stirring in Alfred Hersland
the kind of temper he had in him when he was a boy and when he was
a man and he had a temper in him that is a common thing with those
having in them resisting being tending to the engulfing kind of
that kind of them and Alfred Hersland had this kind of angry action
in him although he was not an angry or a sullen person mostly in
him.</p>

<p>I am very nearly full up with him with Alfred Hersland and his
kind in men and women. It is all filling in me now to over flowing.
Alfred Hersland was a very little one and then a child and then a
boy then. He learned to understand talking and answering and it was
surprising when he began this thing as it is with every one. Once
one sees a little one and he is not understanding anything any one
says to him and he is not trying to do anything and then in a very
little while a couple of months of living and he is understanding
and answering and is trying to have things, that he can have a
liking for then and that is a very certain thing and Alfred
Hersland had this in him and later then he was a boy in his living
and then he was coming to be a very young man and he had it then in
him to be wanting to be helping his sister to have freedom so then
he was very certain and he wanted to be helping and to be
instructing and to be a good deal an example to his brother who was
a younger one and he was then beginning resisting for every one to
his father then, and his mother then had about him a strong feeling
of worrying when he was a little late for dinner in the evening and
later to be missing him when he had left them to go to Bridgepoint
for his college education and he was then certain he was a man
devoted to everything and every one and he always wrote to every
one then to be good ones and he was a man then and then very much
later he was marrying Julia Dehning and all this then was in him as
much later living and in the beginning he was a little baby and
then beginning understanding and talking and then a boy then and
then a boy coming to be going to be a very young man and then he
was full up with public feeling for every one living in the house
with him, his sister, his brother, his father, his mother, every
one, in the beginning then he was a very little one, this is now
then the beginning of the complete history of the being and the
living of him.</p>

<p>It is a nice thing, it is mostly pleasant for every one when the
eldest son is the eldest of the children, in family living. This
was not the case with Alfred Hersland, he was the eldest son, he
was not the oldest of the three Hersland children, Martha was the
oldest of them, it is very certain that mostly in family living it
is a pleasanter thing when the oldest one of the children is the
oldest son, this most generally is pleasanter for every one, for
that one who is the oldest one, it is not such a pleasant thing for
that one when a woman a girl a sister is the older one when he is
the oldest son, this mostly then makes it a little a difficult
thing when he is a son and not the oldest one of the children, in
family living. Very often in family living when one is not the
oldest of the three children but is the oldest son, very often then
he is such a one as I am soon going to be describing as Alfred
Hersland. Very often in family living when one is not the oldest of
the children but is the oldest son, very often then that one is
such a one as Alfred Hersland was in his living. I know now three
of such of them who have it in them to be of the kind of them that
Alfred Hersland is and who have it in their living that they were
the oldest son and that they had a sister who was a few years older
and that put them in a position that I will now soon be describing
in the early living, in the beginning of being a young man in the
living of Alfred Hersland.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland then is now to every one a young one, this is
now a history of him. He was a good enough looking one, many said
he was a very good looking one.</p>

<p>Sometimes in reading, sometimes in thinking, sometimes in
realising, sometimes in a kind of a way in feeling, knowing
repeating knowing always everything is repeating, knowing that
there will be going on living is saddening. Sometime then in
reading, in realising anything, a little sometimes in feeling
something it is saddening to be thinking, feeling, realising that
always everything, is repeating, that sometime some one is a young
one and that now some one is in their middle living and that now
some one is an old one and sometimes it is a queer feeling in one
this and then not anything, not waiting, reading, dying, being a
dead one, living, being a young one, being one is a real thing
inside in one then and always then it is certain that always every
one is living and every one has their being in them and every one
is feeling thinking knowing something and always then it is certain
that every one is like some other one and everything is existing
and it is saddening then and existing is not a real thing then to
some one feeling then every one as existing and being themselves
inside them and some one being like some one and each one being
either a young one or a middle aged one or an old one and sometimes
then this is a little a dreary thing and sometimes then it is a
very queer thing and mostly then it is all then something and
mostly then it is certain that everything is existing and mostly
then it is inside in some one that not anything is a real thing,
that it is dreary to be writing.</p>

<p>I am feeling always that I am not certain that I am ever really
full up with any one in being as a young one, it is such a
difficult thing to be a young one inside one, an older one inside
one, to be any age inside in one, I am feeling that it is a very
queer thing to be knowing some one who is a young one, to be
knowing any one, I am not then having any one inside me now in my
realising, not myself inside me in my feeling, I am living that is
certain, I am now beginning a little again feeling that I am not
yet full up with the being in Alfred Hersland. I am now again
beginning waiting.</p>

<p>I have not any more any one in me to my feeling. Always then
there is Alfred Hersland and I know very well what kind of being
there is in him. I have not any one in me to my feeling. Not Alfred
Hersland then and and so again now I am beginning waiting.</p>

<p>How can any one know it in them that they are a young one, that
they are a middle aged one, that they are an old one. Mostly there
is not any way to know it inside in one that one is a young one
that one is an older one that one is an old one, there is not any
way of knowing such a thing inside in one, mostly then each one
must be told it by some one and mostly then that one does not then
really know it in them. Mostly then there is not any way any one by
themselves can know it in them that they are a young one a very
young one, a young one not such a very young one, an older one, a
good deal older one, an old one, a very old one. There is not then
any way any one can know it inside them the difference in them of
being a young one or an older one when some one is not somehow
telling it to them, some other one, this can be a telling by that
other one this can be a telling by the other one because the other
one is existing at another stage in living. I have been seeing a
young man and have been talking very much with him and he is quite
a young man and he is very much like one I was seeing very much
when I was quite a young one. Now this one that I am now seeing is
quite a young one that is to me very certain and there is in me a
feeling that to any one to himself now there is not very much
meaning in many things he is now always saying and yet I know it by
remembering that that one that I was knowing very well when I was
quite a young one and who is so very like this one, I know that
that one was not then to himself or to me then a young one, I must
date it to myself to be really certain that that other one who is
in being just like this one was then such a young one, young as
this one is now in his being, it is certain that that other one was
such a young one, he is not now to my remembering of that time a
young one, he was at that time to my feeling as now I am
remembering he was at that time to my feeling then not at all a
very young one, he really was then as old as I am now in my
feeling, for it is certain not any one is any age inside them to
their feeling, every one is inside them living, that is about all
there can ever be in them really of feeling of themselves inside
them, that they are living inside in them, they cannot be inside in
them any age inside them not any one and that makes it a very hard
thing to be really realising a young one or an old one or any one,
or one's own self inside one, and now I am not going to be doing
this thing with Alfred Hersland I am now outgoing to be telling the
being in him and the living in him and what he did in living with
any other one. Not any one in them is to themselves any age inside
them. They know in them by looks and looking at other ones and
talking and knowing things they are thinking, have been thinking,
by things they were and will be doing, by realising by an effort in
them or simply in them things happening in them by remembering but
really then not any one is to themselves anything but only just
living inside them, that is all feeling of themselves inside them
that they can have in them with not anything to help them by
telling them or by their seeing others then to help them.</p>

<p>Always then Alfred Hersland had a being in him that now I am
beginning describing. Always Alfred Hersland was living to his
ending. This is the being then that is in every one, they are
existing until there is an end of them. Each one has their own
being in them, each one is of a kind in men and women. Alfred
Hersland was of a kind of men and women as I was saying, he was the
eldest son but not the eldest child as I was saying and that had
some effect on him as I was saying it does have on those that are
eldest sons but not the eldest child in family living, and Alfred
Hersland was all through his early living living with poor people
near him and in a way he was of them, he did things with them as I
will now be telling and then he left home to go to Bridgepoint for
his college training and before that he was at the stage of being
very instructive and very desirous to be the head of his family and
a good citizen and after he left he was a tender feeling in his
mother's living and then he had some kinds of loving in him and
then as I was saying he came to be married to Julia Dehning and
later then his father was losing his great fortune and then too
Martha was beginning having trouble in living and later then his
brother David was influencing him and later then Alfred Hersland
was having very much trouble in his married living and many people
came then to be important to him and then there was more and more
living in him and this is now to be a complete history of him. I am
now almost all through with waiting. I am now beginning to be free
with the being of him inside me in my feeling. I am now completely
certain that not any one is to himself inside him in his or her
feeling any age inside them.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland was the eldest son and the second child of the
Hersland family and the Hersland family then were living on a ten
acre place in a part of Gossols where no other rich people were
living and the Herslands were then rich people, Mr. Hersland was
then a very rich one, Mrs. Hersland had it then and always that she
was naturally a natural part of rich living, but being rich ones
was then not inside them as a feeling important in the Hersland
children living, they were then all three of the living of the poor
people in small houses and a half country half-city living feeling.
Alfred Hersland was then such a one in his living, and living was
then the important thing in him and slowly then family living came
to be important to him, but now in the beginning when he was a very
young one, family living was not important in him. This is now to
be a complete history of the living in him all his living. When he
was quite a very young one family living his family position was
not of any importance in him, then it came to be more important,
then very important in him, then after his marrying Julia Dehning
very much less important in him. Always all the time he was living
in Gossols even when family living was important to him he was
living with the poor people near him. Later after he married Julia
Dehning he in a way came back to such a living although they were
then different ones he was then knowing.</p>

<p>Mostly it is very hard realising about another one that that one
is not thinking, is not thinking when it would seem that thing is a
thing they would naturally be doing. It is very hard for any one
who is ever doing writing to be really realising that very many are
not doing thinking, remembering, it is a very hard thing to be
realising about other ones and then it is a very hard thing to be
realising that some who would naturally be thinking the kind of way
one writing is thinking are not ever thinking that kind of a way
about anything, about something. It is a very hard thing then
knowing what any one ever is seeing, feeling, thinking, I am all
alone now and I have then an unreal lonesome feeling, it is like a
little boy who was howling and they all rushed out to help him, I
am all alone, he said, and all of a sudden it had scared him. It is
not frightening to some but it is hard work for them then for such
a one may then perhaps be almost in need of beginning again.</p>

<p>Every one was a whole one in me and now a little every one is in
fragments inside me. There are a very great many not now in me,
mostly every one now in me is in pieces inside me. Mostly not any
one now is a whole one inside me. Alfred Hersland is in fragments
inside me, I will now begin again and it will be a describing of
pieces then, pieces of perhaps a whole one. Perhaps not any one
really is a whole one inside them to themselves or to any one.
Perhaps every one is in pieces inside them and perhaps every one
has not completely in them their own being inside in them. Perhaps
each one is in pieces and repeating is coming out of them that is
certain but as repeating of pieces in them. Repeating is always
coining out of each one that is certain, in all moments of
despairing that is certain, that every one always is repeating.
That every one always is repeating is a certain thing.</p>

<p>I am very certain of that thing that every one always is
repeating the being in them, sometimes it is to me as pieces that
do not make any meaning as a whole one. Mostly always sometime each
one is a whole one to me, very often each one is in pieces to me.
Always every one is repeating, repeating and repeating the being in
them and always repeating is coming out of each one, always all
through all the living they are doing, always all their living and
sometimes it is exciting to know it in them, sometimes a very
dreary thing, sometimes a very discouraging feeling for living,
sometimes a friendly one and sometimes then it makes of some one
not such an important one as one had thought them, sometimes then
it makes of some one a more important one than one had thought
them, sometimes it is a habit in one to expect it of them the
repeating from some one.</p>

<p>Now then, mostly every one is a good deal in pieces to my
feeling, Alfred Hersland then now is such a one to my feeling, a
good deal in pieces to my feeling. Always all his being is always
repeating in all his living. He is a good deal in pieces to my
feeling.</p>

<p>He was not then the oldest of the Hersland children, he was
younger than Martha and that always makes a difference in a boy's
living, not that Martha was very important to him in his early
living but there came to be for him when it came to be in him when
he was a going to be young man and was coming to feel like a good
citizen and having strong family feeling, it came to him then to be
directing and he was not then the eldest of the Hersland children.
He did help Martha some then, he did help her a little to be able
to go to college as she was wanting to do then but they were not
very interesting ever to each other Martha and Alfred Hersland, a
little then when she was to go to college Martha was a little
interesting to Alfred then and very much later in her living when
Alfred was having trouble long after he had been married to Julia
Dehning he was a little then a little interesting to Martha who was
then taking care of her father in Gossols after he had lost their
great fortune. Alfred then was a little really interested in Martha
when she was leaving home for a college education, later he and his
brother David were a little interesting one to the other one when
they were living in Bridgepoint together after Alfred was married
and then later, and the mother Mrs. Hersland had a tender feeling
in her for the clothes Alfred had left with her and the room he had
slept in, when he left the family living to go to Bridgepoint to do
his studying, and Mr. Hersland he never had in him a very certain
important feeling about Alfred excepting a little when he might
have been needing him or when a little Alfred might be opposing him
but really then the three Hersland children not any of them were
really important ever to Mr. David Hersland to his feeling. He had
sometimes a kind of feeling about one or the other of them because
of something, some specific thing, but mostly Mr. Hersland was as
big as all the world in his feeling.</p>

<p>Every one to me just now is in pieces to me. That is to say
every one is to me just now as pieces to me. That is to say that
each complete one is only as a piece to me, that all there is of
each one at anytime in them gives to me a feeling of pieces not of
a whole thing, that is to say I am having just now with each one I
am knowing or remembering a feeling an emotion from them as if they
were each one not a whole thing. I have this perhaps not altogether
with every one but I have it just now with a good many of them a
good many that I am knowing, knowing now or remembering now and
most of the time now I have such a feeling. A little it comes to me
I am certain from my realisation that many of them are not
completely thinking or feeling the way a complete one of their kind
of them would be thinking or feeling. They are thinking and feeling
in pieces then now to me to my feeling just now in my emotion and
that makes of them to me pieces of being, makes all there is of
them of each one, not whole ones, this is very strongly in me just
now in my feeling, very very strongly in me, men and women very
many of them those I am knowing those I am remembering, not all of
them, I do not say that it is true of all of them even just now in
my feeling but very many a great many of them are to me just now in
pieces to me. There are pieces then and that is whole being, there
is a piece then and that is the whole being of some one, they may
be, such a one may be completely of one kind of being, but it is
only a piece of such a kind of being as that one is in being. It is
not such a very joyous feeling, having the emotion of having every
one as a piece to one, it does make of everything a thing without
ending and all the time then there is not any use of anything
keeping on going. Why should anything any one keep on going if not
ever at any time anything any one will be a whole one, what is the
use of anything or everything keeping on going if not at any time I
will not be having a sensation that any one anything will be a
whole one, once every one sometime was a whole one, now mostly
every one is a piece of a one, not all the being as a complete one
and yet every one has their own being in them and putting all of
each kind of them together to make a whole one can not be to me a
satisfaction, cannot give to me any real satisfaction can not be a
satisfactory way in my feeling of having completion of having
anything or any one a whole one cannot give to me any reason why
the world should keep on being, there is not any reason if in
repeating nothing is giving to me a sensation of a completed one, I
have then this in me now and mostly every one I am knowing or
remembering is to me just now a piece of a kind of being and every
one is themselves inside them, that is always to my feeling certain
and so then feeling each one is a piece of a kind of being and
always then feeling each one is entirely existing so that each one
is not a part of any whole thing I cannot to myself have any very
real satisfaction from getting together all the ones there are of a
kind of them, to make a whole one, that is, not to my feeling, that
cannot give to me an emotion of satisfaction, that is not to my
feeling satisfying and so then I am not feeling each one is
sometime to me a whole one, no then no, I am now feeling that
mostly all of them every one I am knowing every one I am
remembering is to me a piece of being and so then there is not any
use in the world going on existing so that every one can keep on
with repeating a piece of being, not any use at all then to me to
my feeling, not any use then really to any one and this is now then
the real state of feeling I am now having.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland is to me a piece of being, he is not in me a
whole one, this is certain, mostly every one is to me a piece of
being, every one has their own being in them, Alfred Hersland has
his own being in him, alright, I know it of every one, I know it
that every one has their own being in them, I know it and always I
feel it, I always feel it and I always know it, every one has their
own being in them yes every one, every kind of a one, every one
that ever was or is or will be living, yes, alright, I know it of
every one that every one has their own being in them, Alfred
Hersland had his own being in him, yes every one has their own
being in them, yes that is alright, I know that of them, I know
that very well of them, I know every one has their own being in
them, I feel it of them, I know that always in every one, always in
each one, always of every one, yes I know that each one has their
own being in them and I am saying that mostly every one is a piece
of being, not a whole one in them and so then there is not any use
of the world going on for any one, and there is not any way of
making a complete one of any being by putting together all of some
kinds of them all of any kind of them for each one has their own
being in them and so after all there is not any way of making a
whole one. Every one to me just now is as a piece to me, that is to
say each one mostly is not a complete one of anything to my
feeling, each one just now to my feeling is a piece of something
and that is to me very certain by my very strongly realising in
every one the way they are not thinking, feeling a complete thing
of their kind in feeling and thinking. Now then Alfred Hersland is
a piece of being to me and now I will tell of it the way I feel it
in me, the way I feel him and every one just now in me.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland had a kind of being in him that in some who have
it in them makes of them very good ones, some not such very good
ones. This is in a way true of every kind there is of being. Of the
kind of one that Alfred Hersland was in his being they range from
very good ones through to pretty bad ones but this is true of every
kind there is of men and women. Alfred had it in him to have his
being in him so that it was a little passionate in him, not very
affectionate in him, not so as to be very good in him, not really
ever very bad in him, sometimes as aspiration in him, more or less
as ambitious in him, sometimes as virtuous and didactic in him. The
kind of being he had in him was of a kind of being that in some
having it in them makes of them devout in religion, makes of them
mystic in religion, so as to let themselves be absorbed, all
existing, some of them having this kind of being in them have
religion in them but then it is like that in the grandfather of
Alfred Hersland, Mr. Hissen. Some having this kind of being in them
are meek enough in living and yet a little dominating in family
living and are just enough in thinking and impersonal in feeling,
and some of such of them need to have as a wife to them some one
very vibratingly existing to give to them enough stimulation to
make them keep really alive inside them. All these then are of the
resisting, the dependent independent kind of them. Some of them
have the being in them very murkily passionate inside and some of
these then are trying to engulf every one near them to be lost
inside them, to be swallowed by them and some of them are not
interested in very many persons near them but some of them they
need to have engulfed by them and so then Alfred Hersland was of
the kind of them the resisting dependent independent kind of them,
the kind that own those they need for loving. Many of such of them
do not really in their living need any one for loving, in a way Mr.
Hissen the old man important in religion, being inside him all
there was of religion was such a one of this kind of them. Alfred
Hersland then to my feeling has being in him as pieces only of
being, he is himself inside him, he has being in him, he has really
living in him, every one has real being to me in them but as I am
saying very many to me now are pieces of being and yet they are
themselves inside them, I know that of them, I know that in them, I
know that in myself with them, and so then to me then just now then
in my feeling, very much mostly every one is as pieces of living,
pieces of being, to me then now to my feeling, pieces everywhere of
something are existing and repeating, repeating of pieces of
something and yet whole ones are inside them are repeating all
around me as living, feeling, being, thinking, existing and in a
way then not whole ones and not a part of anything because they are
one each one all there is of them and so then just now to my
feeling it is a little fragmentary all there is of living and
keeping going is only in everything because it is not ended yet and
that is then my feeling just now inside me and Alfred Hersland is
to me a real being but not having completion in the sense of a
whole meaning, everything then every one, that is mostly every one
mostly everything is just now to my feeling as pieces of being,
pieces alive completely inside them and so always repeating as a
whole one but having not meaning as a whole one. Alfred Hersland
then was a kind of them he had a kind of being in him that was in
him as more or less engulfing, somewhat passionate, not very bad,
certainly not very good, engulfing resisting dependent independent
being, needing to own those he would need for loving, very often
needing some one poignantly alive to influence him.</p>

<p>Of the kind of one that Alfred Hersland was in his being they
range from very good ones through to pretty bad ones, from very
tyrannical ones to very just ones, from very good ones through to
pretty bad ones, from very religious ones to completely skeptical
ones, from very dominant ones to very meek ones, from very
passionate ones to completely indifferent ones and all of these in
their living are of the resisting kind of them the dependent
independent kind of them, those of them should have then needing to
own those they need for loving. Alfred Hersland then had in him to
be a little passionate and engulfing, a little meek and a little
tyrannical in living, a little didactic and superior in aspiring,
and certainly not really a very good one and in religion mostly not
believing and yet not being really completely certain that to be
dead was to be really completely a dead one, he had it a little in
him to be a little going to be saving himself by a little religion
in himself or in somebody very near to him whom in a way then he
was owning.</p>

<p>Of the kind of one that Alfred Hersland was in his being, the
kind of them men and women having in them such kind of being range
from very good ones through to pretty bad ones, have all kinds of
mixtures in them, have every kind of way of living are many of them
pretty successful in living, some very successful and some pretty
miserably failing, some pretty steady with the being in them, some
pretty intermittent and some meek and some very weak in being and
all this is true of every kind there is of men and women.</p>

<p>I am thinking now of six of them that have such a kind of nature
in them like that in Alfred Hersland and these have it very
differently in them than he had it in him and then there was his
grandfather Mr. Hissen of whom I have written. There was one and he
was not very successful not very not successful in living, he was
successful enough in living and he had it in him to be impersonal
and just and kindly enough with mostly every one, and he had not
any engulfing passionate nature in him, not at all any such a kind
of this kind of being in him, and he was almost altogether certain
that to be dead was to be really a dead one and he did not
altogether completely like it such a feeling and he could be a
little not certain of it inside him though mostly altogether he was
certain that to be dead is to be really truly a dead one and he
liked it very well that his wife who could be making lively living
feeling was very certain that to be dead was not at all to be a
dead one and he liked it then that she was such a kind of one and
mostly then this one was successful enough in living, and kindly
and not meek and not given to aggression and master in his own
house by patient overseeing and successful enough in living by
patient persisting and this then is all there is now to be written
of the living this one had in him. This one then was of the
resisting kind of them that have it in them not to be engulfing,
not to be aggressive nor meek in their resisting winning, to be
needing to be owning those they need for loving but to be only
loving one human being, to be kindly but impersonal really with
every other one. That is all then of the being of one of the six of
them.</p>

<p>Another of the six of them was one having it in him to have a
good deal in him of the engulfing passionate being of his kind of
them but the being in him was not really ever in action, it never
amounted to any more in him than to be a little wiggling in him and
that was all then, he wanted it to be in action, he wanted to be
passionate, and succeeding, and aspiring, and despairing, he tried
it always all his living, he was always a little scaring and
filling with hope his family for the despair and the possible
activity in succeeding in living in him and mostly then nothing
ever happened and he came as near in his living as a man can come
to failing who is not completely failing in living. He loved a very
pale anaemic woman but he never came to marrying, he was always a
man considered as perhaps promising successful living and so it
went on and on and he was an older one and still he himself and a
little some other ones had still a hopeful feeling that this one
would sometime be really succeeding, would really be doing
something. This then has been a very little description of another
one of the six of them.</p>

<p>Another one of them had the passionate murky engulfing being in
him in a completely concentrated form that made him active,
sensitive, amusing and successful, quite successful in living. He
was always loving but it never was a trouble to him, he was so
active he never was knowing that he was engulfing the other one,
that he owned those he needed for loving. He was a very active,
sensitive, amusing, successful enough person and the murky
engulfing passionate resisting being that made him was so
concentrated in him that he was a compactly existing being and in a
way not interested in anything or any one he was not just then
really needing. He was a very nice, a nice, amusing, sensitive,
successful enough one of this kind of them, the passionate
engulfing resisting kind of them, in this one this being was quite
a concentrated pleasant thing. This is then all there will now be
written of this one.</p>

<p>Another one had it in him to be completely certain in all his
acting and his feeling and his living that to be dead is to be a
dead one and so this one must keep on being a live one and must
have everything he can be seizing to keep by him and always this
one in his talking and his thinking and his feeling was very
certain that he was very certain that to be dead was not to be a
dead one and if it were, what then, a really noble man would not
let it effect him and he was most certainly such a one. This one
then had this being, the resisting being I have been describing as
not really in him as engulfing as not really in him not engulfing,
as not really in him as passion and yet as just enough in him as
passion to give him a little something that made it that mostly one
would not trust him and yet that for very many he had some real
attraction. This one had some aggression of resisting being in him,
this one was quite successful enough in living.</p>

<p>This one that I am now beginning describing had murky passionate
resisting being but its action in him was very intermittent and it
was at different times in very different conditions in him.
Sometimes it was in him in a fairly concentrated condition and it
made of him some one very quick and sensitive and charming and a
musician, sometimes it was very quiet in him and then sometimes it
burst out as uncontrollable temper in him. Twice in his life it
lead to loving and both times then it made trouble for him for he
was not strong enough in persisting to be able to keep on owning
the ones he needed for loving. This one was not very successful in
living.</p>

<p>This one was very successful in living, this one that I am now
beginning describing. This one had this being not at all as murky
not at all as engulfing, he had it in him as efficient emotion, as
active practical reasonably aggressive resistant action, as
steadily and not too sensitively in him, as warmly affectionate and
rationally self-understanding. He was a little sentimental and this
was all the weakness there was in him. The being in him was
perfectly adjusted to steadily succeeding in living. Sometime
perhaps there will be a very long history written of him and four
others very like him, perhaps in the history of David Hersland and
George Dehning.</p>

<p>This then has been, a little, descriptions of six kinds of being
that are kinds of the kinds of them that Alfred Hersland was in
living. As I was saying of the kind of being there is in Alfred
Hersland there is every kind of variation. There has been now made
very short descriptions of six of them. This is now time then for
the really beginning describing the living in Alfred Hersland from
his beginning.</p>

<p>As I was saying he was not the oldest of the three Hersland
children. Every one knows this now of him. He was the oldest son
but not the oldest one of the children in the family living. Being
the oldest son and not the oldest of the children has always a
certain effect on one having such a position in a family living.
That is pretty nearly certain. Alfred Hersland then as I was saying
was the oldest son but not the oldest of the children. Martha
Hersland was the oldest of the three children. There has been
already written a complete history of her living and her being, a
pretty nearly completed history of her. She was the oldest of the
three Hersland children, Alfred Hersland was three years younger.
This is now the beginning of a complete history of his living, the
beginning of the regular description of the being he had in him. To
begin again then, to begin now with him, to begin now again trying
to describe him as a quite young one, as beginning in his living.
To begin then.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland, Alfy as every one then called him was as a
young one of the living of poor people living in small houses in a
part of Gossols where the Herslands were the only rich people
living. Alfy was of the living of poor people in his daily living
then as was his older sister Martha then and his brother who was
then quite a little one. All three of the Hersland children were of
this living for a good many years in their beginning. It was
different in Alfred than it was in Martha, than it was in David
Hersland, that I have already been saying. In Alfred it was his
daily living then, it was nearly all the living then in him. It was
half country half city living. Alfy knew very many poor people then
in his young living. In a way then he was then completely of them,
completely of their living then. He Was different in his living
with them in a way than Martha and David were. He was completely
then as a young one of the living of poor people, a half city half
country poor people living. He was always then with these kind of
men and women and children.</p>

<p>All three of the Hersland children Martha and Alfred and David
were in their young living more of the living of the poor people
living near them than they were of their own family living then.
Each one of them was in his or her way almost completely in their
young living of the living of poor people in a part of Gossols
where the Herslands were the only people who were rich of all those
living there. All three of them Martha, Alfred and David were then
in their young living of the half country half city living of poor
people living in that part of Gossols where the Herslands then were
living.</p>

<p>Each one of the three Hersland children had each one her or his
own being in her or in him. Each one was very different from the
other two of them, Martha had one kind of being, and Alfred had one
kind of being and David had a kind of being and the being in each
one was different from that in each of the other two of them.</p>

<p>Each one of the three of them the Hersland children were then in
their young living each in their own way with their own being in
them of the living of people living in small houses and being in
feeling half city half country men and women and children. All
three of them of the Hersland children had this living inside them
and around them then when they were beginning living, for a number
of years each one of them, and in each one it was a living that was
in them in each one different in feeling from each of the other two
of them. Each one then of the three of them were freely living when
they were each one of them young ones with people living near them.
Martha was of the people near her as I was saying and in her as I
was saying then she was in a way completely of them and completely
not of them, she was of them completely in her daily living and in
her feeling, she was completely not of them because of the future
living that would be a different one from anything that any of them
would naturally be having. Martha was in a way completely in her
daily living completely in her feeling all through her young living
of the being of the people living in small houses near them, of the
women and the men and the children and then later she was more and
more completely not of them because of the living that would be her
natural future living. She was of them in her feeling, she was
completely cut off from them from the future living that would be
natural to her in their feeling. She had not then in her feeling in
her younger living any feeling of living that was different from
their living in them only she had in her her future living and so
then she was to them completely cut off from them. She had not in
her in her younger living very much almost not any feeling of the
living, the rich right American living that would have been a
natural living for her to be having. She was to her feeling like
those with whom she was mostly then entirely in her young living
living. She was pretty nearly altogether like them then in her
feeling, she had more money and she did not have to work to earn
any and that was a natural thing in her living and then in her
feeling she was completely of them and this was in her all of her
young living. In Alfred Hersland it was a little different, he
really did more things with them than Martha ever did with them. He
did everything with them all through his young living but always
somehow he had it in him that his mother never was cut off in her
feeling from being part of rich right American living. This was not
in him as thinking, his mother was not then important to his
feeling, she was not then really in any way very important to him,
his father was a rich man, every one who knew him knew this about
him, Alfred Hersland was completely living the living half city
half country of people around him, somehow always he had it in him
that his mother was part of rich right American living, this was in
him as a kind of realisation of rich surfaces in aesthetic feeling,
this was in him and his father was a rich man and always he was
completely doing everything with those boys and girls and men and
women who were living in that part of Gossols where he was living.
He did everything with them, he was completely living with them, he
did everything they were doing, he did everything with them and
they with him, he was completely then living with them.</p>

<p>He was doing all his daily living with the children and the
women and the men living in small houses in that part of Gossols
where the Herslands were the only rich people living. The Herslands
were rich people of rich American living as the natural way of
living. In a way Alfred had never had any real experiencing of this
kind of way of living, he really did not know very much of any one
who was living this kind of living, sometimes some with their
children came to see the Herslands and then the Hersland children
had to play and talk with these then these children living the rich
American living, and the Hersland children mostly were not
interested in them, Alfred had not any liking for them, he liked to
have all the fruit picked even before it was quite ripe before it
was really ready for picking so that those children who were coming
to visit them should not be using their trees to pick fruit and
enjoy it. Alfred never liked it that these children should be at
home in his orchard, picking fruit and eating it and taking it home
with them, he liked very well picking fruit and climbing trees, his
own trees with those children that were in his daily living, he
never did like it that children coming with their parents on a
Sunday visit well to do American families should come and pick
fruit in his orchard and enjoy such things then when they came
occasionally to visit the Herslands in a part of Gossols where not
any other rich people excepting the Herslands were living. Once
when some of them were coming, Alfred with David and Martha to help
picked all the fruit although most of it was green then, it was
mostly cherries just then, picked it all every bit of it and put it
in the barn to ripen and he did this so that the children coming to
visit them should not be climbing the trees and helping themselves
as if it were in an orchard of their own. He made David and Martha
have such a feeling too in them, it was a mixed feeling in Alfy
then, he was then just beginning to feel in him responsibility for
family living, he was just beginning then to feel in him that he
was an American citizen, he was just beginning to feel in him then
his daily living and liking that realisation that he was then
beginning to have in him. He was beginning then a little dimly to
have a realisation of the fact that his mother never in her feeling
had been really cut off from rich right American living. He was
just then completely living with the people living near him, he was
doing all his living with them, living was interesting to him then,
he was more and more then beginning to be really living his living
with their living. He had in him not any disliking for the rich
American living but he did not want the children of that living to
make themselves too much at home in his garden in his orchard with
the flowers and the fruit that was part of his daily living
then.</p>

<p>Each one of the three Hersland children had each their own way
of living and feeling their early living. This is now to be a
description of the way Alfred lived and felt his early living. As a
boy Alfred Hersland, Alfy as they called him was doing everything
he was doing with these boys, those children living near him. He
did everything he did with them, mostly he did everything they did
in living, he did everything he did then in his daily living with
them. He was then completely of them in doing everything he did in
his daily living with them. As I was saying he did mostly
everything they did in their living. He certainly did everything he
did in his daily living with them. He was of them then. He was of
them, Martha Hersland, David Hersland, all three of the Hersland
children were of them the people in small houses near them in their
early living. Each one of them, of the three Hersland children was
of them in the way it was natural for that one to be of people
around her around him. Each one of the three of them certainly was
of the children and women and men who were their neighbors then in
all the young living each one of them had then. Each one of them
certainly then was of the daily living of these then, the people
near them more than any one of the three of them were then of their
own proper family living. Martha Hersland was pretty completely of
the living of the people living near her when she was a young one,
more than she was then of her mother's or her father's or her
brother's living then. Alfred Hersland, Alfy as these then all
called him did everything he did in his younger living with them
with these people near him. David Hersland also was of them the
people near him but then he was of every one in a way and mostly
always of himself inside him and soon now there will be a beginning
to him. Each one then of them certainly did have their young living
in company with the people living near them then and certainly each
one of them had their living inside in them in the way it was
natural for such a kind of them as each one of them was inside them
to have it in them. Martha then had it in her in her kind of way of
having it in her. She was of them these people in her younger
living. Alfred, Alfy as they called him, had it in him then when he
was a boy and also then when he was a little older as it was
natural for him to have it in him. He certainly then when he was a
boy lived all his daily living with them, mostly then he did what
they did in living, certainly he did everything he did with them,
this was true of him when he was a boy, it was pretty nearly true,
of him when he was a little older, it was more or less true of him
all the time he lived there near them.</p>

<p>The grandfather of the Hersland children Mr. Hissen had it in
him to be completely certain that when he would be a dead one he
would be dead completely dead, of that he was completely certain,
he was so a complete one, concrete and generalised conviction was
the same in him, he was in himself then to himself always in him
always all there was of religion, he was the grandfather of the
Hersland children, he was the grandfather of Alfred and David
Hersland, he was the grandfather of Martha Hersland but she was not
related to him in being, he was the grandfather of Alfred and David
Hersland, they were related to him by their being, he was the
grandfather of Alfred Hersland, that is certain, this is now
beginning to be a description of Alfred Hersland and the being in
him and the living that came out of and to him.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland was a boy and living then with for him poor
people, children, men and women. He did everything that he was then
doing in his living with them, he was then completely of them, he
was then completely with them when he was a boy and among them.
Later when he was still doing everything he was doing with them,
when he was still doing mostly everything they were doing with
them, it was then a little different in him, he was pretty
completely then doing with them everything that they were doing, he
was doing it pretty completely entirely then his life with them, he
was pretty completely then almost entirely then doing with them
everything that they, older girls and boys, and men and women in
the small houses near the Hersland ten acre place were then doing,
he was then completely doing and doing pretty nearly entirely
everything they were doing and doing it with, them and it was a
little a different thing in him than when he was a younger one,
already he had then a feeling like a feeling for quality of
richness and finish in anything, he had already a little beginning
of feeling in him that his family was not really then never had
been cut off from the rich American living, the natural living for
them. He did not know it then and the little he knew then was not
pleasant to him, he did then mostly entirely everything those
living in small houses near him were doing and he did it with them,
he did not know then really anything of this rich right American
living that was the natural Hersland way of living, he knew nothing
of this then, he did not really think of such a thing, a little he
had in him then a little family feeling about managing his sister
and being a good citizen, his mother was not then important to him,
his father was a rich man he knew it then but he did not then
really feel this in him, he had not any realisation of this then in
him, and always then he was doing everything and with them, very
completely indeed then what these people were doing who lived near
him and always then he did not know then and the little he knew of
them who had it in them, right rich American living was not
pleasant to him and yet in him beginning was a little feeling that
some way somehow he was inside him a being never really cut off
from rich right American living. When he was a younger one this was
entirely completely not in him, a little later when he was
completely doing everything the ones near him were doing and very
much with them and with the feeling of them and himself as of them
in him still somewhere in him there was in him what his mother had
in her as always there inside her that he was of a being that had
it as a natural thing that nothing in him was cut off from rich
right American living, and always then he was completely living
with them the people near him living their living having their
feeling being completely then of their living in his acting, in his
living, in his thinking, in his feeling. Each one of the Hersland
children had their own being in them each one of them had a
different way from the two other ones of having the living with the
people near them in them. Martha had her being, had her feeling in
their living, had her way of being completely of them the people
near her, in her younger living. Alfred had his being in him, he
had his way of feeling the living he was doing in his young living.
He certainly was doing everything these near him were doing and
doing it with them and feeling it as they were feeling in it then
and this is now then some history of his living then, of his daily
living then.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland was with them in his daily living with the
people living near him, with the boys around him in his daily
living and he did then everything he did with them and he did then
everything they did in their daily living and he had not in him
then anything at all of family living. When he was a boy, when he
was beginning his living he lived his daily life then doing
everything he did then with the boys the women and men living near
him. He did his roller skating, a little shooting, some camping, a
good deal of fishing, some going about the country selling fruit he
had been picking with them in the orchard in the ten acre place
where the Herslands were living and any other fruit belonging to
any of them that they could use for selling, he did everything in
his daily living with them, he was with them when they were with
girls then and he did with the gills everything a boy does when he
is with them. He had then public school living. He did his daily
living completely with them, he did everything they were doing
then, this was the history of the living he had in him when he was
a young one: he did everything then with these then living near
him, he had then his being in him and his daily living and this is
now then to be a description of the living then in him with the
being in him.</p>

<p>There were then the Banks boys who lived near him, there were
three of them, it was the oldest one who was mostly with him, the
second one George who had lost two fingers from a sickness he had
that no one ever mentioned to him was the one with whom David
Hersland later did his living. The oldest Banks brother Albert, who
later in his living did shoemaking, George later was a clerk and
pretty successful in living, the third brother then a very red
faced freckled one who could crow very well and always was on
fences doing this thing and his later living came when the
Herslands did not any longer any of them any more know what
happened to any one in that part of Gossols and so there is not to
be any telling of his future living, Albert was a good deal in
these days with Alfred Hersland and then he began shoemaking and he
was not very good at learning at school and once he had a furious
anger in him there and he scared every one in the school by drawing
a pistol although it was an empty one and he was told not to come
any more and he then began learning shoemaking but he was a good
fellow to be with for any one and pleasant enough and he and Alfred
did everything together then until the shoemaking began and then he
went with men and Alfred was not so completely with him then. These
Banks boys had in them all three of them half city half country
living, Alfred had in him completely half city half country living,
when he began shoemaking city living came to be more strongly in
him, Albert then went on with his half city half country living, he
went on then living with those then near him who kept on in them
being half city half country in their feeling. There were some of
them who kept on having halt city half country feeling some of
those living near the Herslands then and after Albert Banks began
learning shoemaking Alfred Hersland was mostly with them. The one
who might have been interested in Martha if she had been more
interesting to him was one of such of them. Alfred when he was not
any longer a boy in his living was for a little while a good deal
with this one. He did then, Alfred did then pretty nearly entirely
everything that this one, that this crowd of them were doing then
in their daily living. Alfred was beginning to have a little in him
beginning then the feeling of family being but it was not in him
then yet as in any way determining and he was then completely
entirely doing in his daily living what these having in them hall
country half city living were doing.</p>

<p>There were a number of little houses in this part of Gossols and
Alfred knew a good many of the people living in them. In a good
many of them the same people kept on living all the time the
Herslands were living in a ten acre place there, in some of the
houses there was much moving, people would be very often coming and
going. Once there was a family that stayed one year there and there
were two children an older boy and a very young one, the older one
Louis Champion was very much with Alfred then, the little brother
was a nuisance to them, Alfred did a good deal of roller skating,
some camping out and more or less fishing with Louis Champion.
Louis was a pleasant fellow and good-looking.</p>

<p>Alfy was often out in the evening, in the summer he was out a
long time almost always every evening. Sometimes he went out with
some of them living in small houses near him, sometimes some of
them would be playing hide and go seek around the Hersland house
with him. Albert Banks was often playing, going about with him of
an evening. They were together very often in the evening. Alfy was
very often out in the evening with some of them living near him. In
the summer he was out a long time almost always every evening. Very
often he would be going off somewhere to do something or he would
be standing around with them or they would be all of them hanging
around together in a vacant lot that was near to where all of them
were living. Sometimes they would be chasing all around all of
them, sometimes some of them would be hiding and running on the
Hersland place as I was just saying. Albert Banks was often then
with Alfy in the evening, less at first after he began learning
shoemaking, earlier when he was still going to school he was almost
always together with Alfy on a summer evening. All the year Alfy
was very often out in the evening when he was a little older boy
and in the summer he was out a long time almost always every
evening. Sometimes he was out with some of them he was doing
everything with in his daily living, sometimes they would be
together playing hide and seek in his orchard and in his garden.
Albert Banks as I was saying would be then almost always with him
in the evening, he would often be playing hide and seek in the
Hersland orchard and garden with them, this was before he was
thinking of beginning learning shoemaking. Frank and Will Roddy
often were with them all in the evening. Frank and Will Roddy often
were there in the evening at the Hersland place playing with Albert
Banks and Alfred Hersland and David. They were often playing hide
and go seek in the summer in the evening. Sometimes some girls
would be with them, sometimes Martha Hersland would be with them.
Every now and then there would be some girls playing along with
them. Albert Banks and Frank and Will Roddy for some time were
almost always together with Alfy in the evening. Albert Banks as I
was saying later began learning shoemaking, he was then not so very
much with Alfy and the Roddy boys who were still then a good deal
together in the evening. Frank Roddy later in his living went into
the country to earn his living. Will Roddy later went into a cigar
stand, clerking, and then his father died and he had a little money
and he came to be a partner and then he and the other one failed
and they were not fair then they very much favored one creditor,
they had some trouble, later very many years later some of the
Herslands happened to hear from some one that Will Roddy was in
jail because of something he had been doing. He was supposed not to
have been very honest and afterwards he was in jail. He was a
little fellow and very quick.</p>

<p>So then Alfy and Albert Banks and the Roddy boys were often
playing hide and go seek in the summer in the evening. They were a
good deal together mostly every evening as I was saying. They were
very often together in a vacant lot playing or hanging around
together somewhere and often enough they would be chasing around in
the Hersland orchard and garden. Sometimes there some girls would
be with them. Sometimes then Martha Hersland would be with them.
Alfred and David very often were playing hide and go seek with
Albert Banks and the Roddy boys and sometimes some others, in the
Hersland orchard and garden. Sometimes some girls would be with
them, sometimes then Martha Hersland would be with them. Sometimes
then they stayed a long time in the orchard, later then Alfred said
to Martha he would tell her father, she had no business to be
playing. Sometimes he would be angry and later he would threaten
her if she would not do something he wanted her to be doing he
would tell her father she was playing hide and go seek in the
evening. Sometimes later there would be quarrelling and Alfy would
be saying Martha should not be playing that evening. Sometimes Alfy
would make Martha go in. He would say if she did not go in he would
tell her father she was playing hide and go seek in the evening.
Don't you know any better than to come along, he would say to her.
He was then a little beginning to have in him the feeling that he
was a good citizen, that he was the oldest son, he did not know
then yet very specifically why she should go in, she did not know
then very specifically why she should go in, they neither of them
knew very specifically why she should not be playing hide and go
seek in the evening but Alfy was beginning then to have such a
feeling about himself in him that he should send her in and later
then if she did not do something he wanted she should be doing he
always said he would then tell his father she had been playing hide
and go seek in the evening and then she always had a sullen fear
inside her. Neither of them then as I was saying knew very
specifically what they were meaning. Martha, Alfred and David
Hersland all three were out a good deal in the evening. Alfred was
often out in the evening, in the summer he was out a long time
almost always every evening. He was then doing everything with the
children and women and men living near him, he was then doing
everything mostly that they were doing, he was doing everything he
did with them. He was then mostly always out with them in the
evening. He was then and when he was older he was then with them,
some of them sometimes with a good many of them in the evening. He
was always then doing everything he was doing then with them.
Alfred all his younger living was out very often in the evening,
then and later in his Gossols living he was often out in the
evening, in the summer he was out a long time almost always in the
evening. Mostly he stayed entirely in that part of Gossols where he
was living. Mostly he never went away from the crowd living near
him. Mostly he in the evening when he was a young one when he was
an older one stayed in that part of Gossols where the Herslands
were living, was with them the people living in small houses near
him.</p>

<p>There were some whom he knew who were living in another part of
Gossols and he sometimes saw them, sometimes he saw them very
often. This is now to be a description of them, of all of them.
There were two families of them that the Hersland children came to
know and each of them lived in a different part of Gossols. They
had no connection with each other. The Fishers one of these
families then were friends of the woman who lived near the
Herslands and did dress-making sometimes for Mrs. Hersland.
Sometimes Mary Fisher came to see the second daughter Cora who was
not yet come to be a really pretty one. Sometimes Mary Fisher's
brother Henry came with her and so the Herslands all of them came
to know them and they each one in their way all excepting Mrs.
Hersland came to know the Fishers very well. Mr. Hersland came to
know them very well later, Martha and Alfred and David Hersland
came to know them earlier. They were six of them of the Fisher
family, four children and a father and mother. Mr. Fisher had
something to do with horses, that was the way he made a living. The
Hersland children never came to know him. They sometimes saw him
and spoke to him. Henry the second son they came to know very well
all of them. Henry went bicycling very often with David Hersland.
Mary was the only daughter and all the Hersland family came to know
her. Later Mrs. Hersland came to know her a good deal and Martha
Hersland always liked her. Mrs. Hersland liked her well enough but
never came really to know her. Alfred used to stay in her kitchen
talking to her. Jim was the oldest son and brother. The Herslands
did not, any of them, ever come to know him. The Fishers were all
proud of him, he was a commercial traveler and was apart from them.
Slowly it came out about him that he was going to ruin from a taste
for liquor. Later he took a cure and was better, none of the
Herslands ever saw him, not any of them ever came to know him. Mrs.
Fisher was a tall kindly faced kind of woman. She was always good
and mostly always in the kitchen. All the Herslands came to know
her, Mrs. Hersland never really came to know her. Henry Fisher was
a very reliable person, he was very pleasant always to Martha
Hersland, he and David Hersland did a great deal of bicycling
together. Alfred Hersland was at the Fishers sometimes for an
evening. They were not really ever very important in his
living.</p>

<p>Another family with whom the Herslands Martha and Alfred and
David, never Mr. and Mrs. Hersland, spent an evening were the
Henrys and these were not really important to them. They came to
know them quite by accident having sat next to them at a theatre
one afternoon and then they went to see them. They went there quite
often in the evening one or two or all three of the Herslands then.
Mr. and Mrs. Hersland never came to know any of them of the Henry
family. There were four children, James Henry a tall thin one who
played the violin while the other ones danced in the evening. Henry
a pleasant enough sensible enough fellow to be knowing, Rose Henry
a little dark one and Carrie Henry who was just one of them. The
Herslands would go there and eat dinner with them, Mrs. Henry
browned potatoes, pealed, when she roasted her meat the way french
people do them, the Herslands always ate very many of them, the
forks and knives the Henrys used for eating were worn dawn very
thin, later then James Henry played and all of them danced pretty
solemnly in a quadrille. This happened quite often in the evening.
The Henrys were really not important in the living of any of the
Hersland children. Later then they did not see any of them, Mr.
Henry later killed himself and every one wondered if he had been
crazy when he did this thing. They were not any of them ever
important in the living of Martha, Alfred or David Hersland.</p>

<p>Alfred as I was saying was in Gossols when he was a very young
one and when he was a little an older one. Sometimes then later he
saw a little sometimes of Olga the sister of the first governess
the Herslands had had in their Gossols living staying with them.
Sometimes the Wyman family made up to him. This is the way he had
all these in him this that I am now beginning describing. This is
now beginning to be a history of him, a history of Alfred Hersland
of all the being and all the living in him.</p>

<p>Alfred played the violin some, he played it very well. He had
some musical feeling, he had quite a bit of musical understanding,
later in his very early Bridgepoint Jiving he was very much
interested in playing and in understanding. He made for himself
some reputation as an intelligent amateur musician. He came to know
then in Bridgepoint in his early living in Bridgepoint a young man
who was making music a profession and did some rather nice
composing. Later this one gave it up and went into a clothing
manufacturing business in which his brother and father needed him,
but this is all later history of Alfred Hersland, this all was in
his Bridgepoint living, this is now a history of him and a
description of the being in him in his Gossols living. He had then
in him in his younger living a good deal of musical feeling. All
the three of them Martha, Alfred and David in their younger living
took lessons to learn to play on something. Alfred was the only one
of the three of them who had any really musical feeling. Martha
took a little interest once in playing and she did a good deal of
practicing just before she left Gossols for her college education.
David was interested in understanding but he never did any
practicing, he was interested again later and always everything was
interesting to him sometime and later there will be a very long
history of everything and of him written.</p>

<p>Alfred had really some musical feeling in him. Once in his later
Gossols living he had a really interesting teacher. This was a man
named Arragon. He was a very interesting man, he interested Alfred
very much then when he was teaching him. Alfred never wanted to be
a musician as a way of living never really at any time in him but
music and understanding musical feeling was for a little while all
the feeling in him, while Arragon was near him. Later there will be
some little history written of this man, not very much but a little
and that will come in the later Gossols living in Alfred
Hersland.</p>

<p>This has been now a little description of the living in Alfred
Hersland and now there will be more description of him, of the
being in him and the living in him.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland was neither popular nor very unpopular with
those that knew him. He was not pleasant nor unpleasant to any one,
he did everything he did with those he was knowing then, he really
did with them mostly everything they were doing. He was not at any
time left out by them. He always all his Gossols living did
everything he was doing with those he was near then in living, and
he always then did with them everything that they were doing. He
was never then left out by them. To them his future living was not
important in him to cut him off at all from them. He did everything
he was doing then with them, he did mostly everything they were
doing with them. He was himself inside him, later as I was saying
he had some feeling in him that he never had been cut off from rich
American living, later then this came to be in him, he still then
did everything he did with those he was knowing in Gossols where he
was living, not altogether though then, he was beginning knowing
some other women and some men, he saw something then of Ida Heard
the school teacher and so did his music teacher Arragon this is all
to be written later.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland then was himself inside him, he was perhaps not
a very complete one, as I was saying some, a good many just now are
pieces to me, they are themselves inside them. Alfred Hersland is
one of such of them. He was certainly himself inside him, perhaps
he was not such a very complete one, this is a little my feeling of
him just now and I have mentioned it again. He was himself inside
him, he was of the engulfing resisting kind of them in men and
women, he was perhaps not a very complete one, he was to mostly
every one not very pleasant not very unpleasant, he was not popular
or unpopular with men or with women. This is now to be some
description of the being in him.</p>

<p>He was some one to himself inside him that is certain, this is
now to be a long description of the being in him. There will then
be more description of his Gossols living.</p>

<p>Now there will be description of the being in him and then more
history of his Gossols living.</p>

<p>Some know more or less of men and women what the being in them
are going to be making them do from minute to minute in their
living, some have not at all any such knowledge in them of men and
women. Some have a little such knowledge in them about some one
when they have known that one completely entirely from the top to
the bottom all through them for a good deal of the living in them.
Some even then are very apt to be believing that any minute that
one will go much farther in doing something than that one really
ever will be doing, much less far in doing something than that one
is really ever going. This is quite common. There are a very great
many who are very certain that some one will be doing something and
these then have it in them to be easily quickly very completely
forgetting all the times they are mistaken. But then it certainly
is certain that some have more feeling for what others are going to
be doing from minute to minute in their living than others have it
in them. Some have an exaggerated notion of the way they do not
have it in them. But some and I mention it for I am one of such of
them have practiced very often in thinking to be planning the
action of some one they are knowing very well in living and always
then though often they know the general direction mostly always
they think something is going to be happening much sooner than it
does really happen or much later than it does really happen or much
more strongly than that one is going to do that thing or much more
weakly than that one is going to be doing that thing and very often
then too such a one is wrong about the kind of action that some one
they are knowing very well is going to be doing. I am very busy
mentioning this thing because I have always been very interested in
seeing how very wrong I can be when I am telling about any one how
they are going to be living from day to day in their living. And
yet more and more in my living I come to be more understanding of
the complete meaning of the being in each one I am knowing, I get
to be more able more and more to know of them what will be the
quality of living of working in them what on the whole will be the
quality of succeeding and failing in them and always then I want to
be mistaken I want to make mistakes so that I can see something in
them which makes of that one a more complete one, always then I
want to be more certain of all the variations that makes some one
so very much like some one really different from that one. Always
then more and more I want to be feeling completely feeling the
complete being, all the being in each one I am ever knowing and
feeling in them the kind and quality and quantity of work and
living and loving in them. I can never have really much feeling of
what specifically they will be doing from moment to moment in their
living I have not any dramatic imagination for action in them, I
only can know about action in them from knowing action they have
been doing any of them, I mention this so that every one can be
certain I do not know this about any one any men or women, I tell
about the living in them from the living they have had in them I
cannot ever construct action for them to be doing, I have certainly
constructive imagination for being in them, sometimes with very
little watching I have pretty complete realisation of pretty nearly
all the being in them. I just felt like mentioning this thing and
so I have just mentioned it here so that every one can be certain
that I have not any dramatic constructive imagination. I am always
more and more and that is certain realising under standing
constructing with complete imagination the complete being each one
of men and women. The actual things each one are doing I only know
from knowing the actual detail in the actual living of each actual
one I am ever knowing. I certainly more and more am always more and
more realising the being in each one I am seeing. I am always more
and more realising kinds in men and women, the being in each one of
each kind of them. I have mentioned this because I have been
feeling for some time like mentioning this thing, sometime I will
make more of this and will illustrate it then. This will come to be
done very much later in my living. Of that I am almost certain.</p>

<p>Now there will be some description of the being in Alfred
Hersland and then after that has been a little written there will
be written more history of his Gossols living and more description
of those with whom lie was then in his daily living. There will
then be written a description of him in his Bridgepoint living and
of his later marrying Julia Dehning and of every one whom he knew
just then and then there will be more history written and there
will be more and on and on then until somewhere nearly to the end
of him. And then sometime later there will be written the ending of
him and of his generation in the Hersland living.</p>

<p>This then is now to be a little description of the being that
was him, as I was saying being is interesting to me and I have some
understanding of being in men and women. As I was saying the being
in Alfred Hersland is more or less like a piece of a whole one but
always he had his own being in him, in a way he was himself inside
him and this is now a little description of my feeling about being
in him, about being in a good many men and women. Almost every one
sometime is a piece of one not a whole one, almost every one
sometime is a whole one. This is true of many men and women to me
of mostly every one. I will now try to understand my meaning in
this feeling.</p>

<p>To be using a new word in my writing is to me a very difficult
thing. Every word I am ever using in writing has for me very
existing being. Using a word I have not yet been using in my
writing is to me very difficult and a peculiar feeling. Sometimes I
am using a new one, sometimes I feel new meanings in an old one,
sometimes I like one I am very fond of that one one that has many
meanings many ways of being used to make different meanings to
every one. Sometimes I like it, almost always I like it when I am
feeling many ways of using one word in writing. Sometimes I like it
that different ways of emphasising can make very different meanings
in a phrase or sentence I have made and am rereading. Always in
writing it, it is in me only one thing, a little I like it
sometimes that there can be very different ways of reading the
thing I have been writing with only one feeling of a meaning. This
is a pleasant thing, sometimes I am very well pleased with this
thing, very often then I am liking a word that can have many ways
of feeling in it, it is really a very difficult thing to me to be
using a word I have not yet been using in writing. I may know very
well the meaning of a word and yet it has not for me completely
weight and form and really existing being. There are only a few
words and with these mostly always I am writing that have for me
completely entirely existing being, in talking I use many more of
them of words I am not living but talking is another thing, in
talking one can be saying mostly anything, often then I am using
many words I never could be using in writing. In writing a word
must be for me really an existing thing, it has a place for me as
living, this is the way I feel about me writing. I have been
mentioning this thing for I am just now feeling a learning in me
for some words I have just been beginning using in my writing. Now
I am going on with a description of being, of being in pieces and
as whole ones to my feeling, of being in Alfred Hersland as I was
saying.</p>

<p>I will not go on about pieces and whole ones in everybody's
being. Each one mostly sometimes is a whole one to me. Very often
later then they are pieces to me some that have been sometimes
completely whole ones to me. That happens then to me quite often,
that happens to me again and again. Sometimes some one I have been
feeling as a completely whole one from the loving being in that one
comes then to me all of a sudden to be loving loving more than
loving some one something and that one then is a piece of one to
me, not any longer the whole one I was feeling. Then I begin again
very often and make of this one a new whole one beginning again
with this piece and remembering everything I ever knew of this one.
One then has been to me a whole one having complete loving being,
such a one then comes to have to me loving loving more than loving
anything and that realisation of that one makes that one to me then
not a whole one. This may come to me of some one, of any one, of
all who are whole ones to me, I may have in me then some
realisation of them and that realisation makes them not a whole
one. Every one is not a whole one, now I am waiting a little for an
inspiration about this thing to explain completely my feeling. I
will now soon be telling my feeling about men and women, about
whole being in them, about them as a piece of living each one about
them always all each one having their own being in them, always
then each one of them each one who ever was or is or will be
living. Then there will be a complete description of being in
Alfred Hersland for my realisation.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland was of a kind in men and women as I was saying.
He was the eldest son but not the eldest child as I was saying, and
that had some effect on him as I was saying. I am writing
everything as I am learning anything. I am writing everything as I
am learning anything, as I am feeling anything in any one as being,
as lam having a realisation of any one, I am saying everything then
as I am full up then with a thing, with anything of any one. I am
certain that some are sometime whole ones to me, that some are
sometimes a piece of their kind of them in me, always I am certain
each one is existing, they are themselves inside them, sometime
mostly every one is a whole one to my feeling, very often before
then very often after then that one is not a whole one in my
feeling; that one is a piece of the kind of being that is the being
they are of in being. This comes then very often to be in my
feeling and just now I am quite a little far from certain that each
one is a whole one and always I am certain somehow always each one
is existing inside them and that in a way sometimes gives to me a
very unsatisfactory way of feeling being for not any one then is
completely a whole one to my feeling mostly not any one and yet
they are not each one parts of a being to my feeling each one then
is existing inside in them and I am then not very well satisfied
with my feeling all being. I am having that kind of feeling a good
deal when several of them that have been completely whole ones to
my feeling are not any longer such completely whole ones, as I was
saying this can happen in them from realising that they are not
original but anticipatorily suggestible some one that was to me as
one completely self-suggested in living, or it can come from some
one having been a completely loving being and then this one is not
really loving the one they were completely loving and loving is not
the complete being in them. Some come to be pieces of themselves as
a whole one from there being anger in them, failure, stupid being
that makes a dead piece in them, uncertain being, weakness in them
sometimes makes of them a piece sometimes of their whole one and
some and a little in a way Alfred Hersland was such a one never
come to be a whole one to me, he always has been a piece of himself
as a whole being and now I begin again.</p>

<p>I have not been very interesting in explaining being in men and
women in my feeling as I am just now having it a good deal in me.
That is quite certain, sometime later I will do it again. Now I
will begin with the being in Alfred Hersland. I am not yet quite
full up with the being in him. Again I am beginning waiting. Again
I am beginning a little to feel him. I am still hoping to be more
certain in my feeling. I am waiting and waiting, I have not in me
now any impatient feeling. Pieces in being, whole ones in being,
words saying what I am wanting, words having existence in them to
my feeling, Alfred Hersland and the being in him and the kind he
was of men and women all these things will come soon to be more
completely in me, that is certain.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland was of a kind of men and women. This is now some
description of that kind of them.</p>

<p>Some one seems to be talking in such a very different kind of
way to mostly every one than I am ever hearing from that one and
sometimes then I do not think of any one really telling me what
that other one has been saying, at least it is a very difficult
thing to realise that one can have such a free talking in him when
always I have not heard it coming out of him. For many years I was
slowly learning that very often some one is not talking in my
hearing the way he is talking when some one else is listening. For
very many it is a very difficult thing to be realising the effect
they have on men and women. I have often been listening again and
again to some one, have been very much with them and always then
they have, that one a certain kind of way of talking that seems
then to be the completely natural way of talking in them, I have
seen such of them talking from suffering, from excited feeling,
from happy feeling in them, from gayety and from being very serious
inside them and then some one tells me about them about such a one
that that one says such and such a thing in talking is always
saying such and such a kind of thing always in talking and that is
then to me astonishing, very astonishing, and then sometime I
realise it of them slowly that such a one, that one, can be saying
that thing, always having such a kind of talking coming out of them
that it is a natural thing in them and slowly then always then I am
always learning how each one is talking to every one, and more and
more then slowly then I am listening.</p>

<p>A little again now to me each one is a whole one sometime. A
good deal to me now yet each one is a piece of living and always
inside them is their own being. Always to me there are kinds in men
and women that is certain and now then to begin again describing
the kind of one Alfred Hersland is in living, all the kinds there
are of that kind of them, all the kinds of ways there are in me of
learning them of feeling them.</p>

<p>There is a kind of a kind of them and Alfred Hersland was one of
this kind of a one, one of the kind of them that are one kind of
the engulfing resisting kind of them that have it mostly all of
them to have it that mostly every one knowing them feels it of them
knows it in them that they are a piece of being and always they
have it in them very many of them to be very alive inside them, to
be to themselves a being very much living and aspiring, very much
really existing. There is a kind of every kind there is of being
that have it in them to be a piece of being very much to every one
and those then those of that kind of them are active inside them in
being, are active and aspiring, are very completely live ones in
their existing and these then are a good deal to a good many
knowing them completely a piece of being and as I am saying there
are some kinds of every general kind there is in men and women of
all the kinds of them there are some kinds of each kind of them
that have this in them the being to mostly every one knowing them
as pieces of a being and as I am saying some of these kinds of them
are very active and aspiring in their being and their living and
Alfred Hersland was one of such of them and now I am beginning
inquiring into the being of such of them into the being of all of
such of them who have it in them to be to very many knowing them
pieces of being and having active and completely aspiring being in
them completely and continuously aspiring being in them. Alfred
Hersland then was such a one. As I was saying he was of the
engulfing resisting being, as I was saying he had active and
aspiring being in him, as I was saying he was mostly to every one
ever knowing him a piece of being and this is now to be a history
of the living in him, a description of the being in him, an
inquiring into the connection in being between him and all those
other ones that like him are pieces of being to mostly every one
knowing them. There are a very great many men and women that are
such of them. Alfred Hersland was of these then was such a one this
is now then again the continuing of realising the kind of them that
have it in them to be a piece of being to mostly every one knowing
them. Alfred Hersland as I am saying all his living was such a one,
was one of this kind of them.</p>

<p>Some one has milk brought to the house by the milkman and it is
wasted and yet always that one is continuing having that amount of
milk brought in because that one is thinking that sometime that one
will be a sick one and then if the milkman has not the habit of
bringing milk every day to that one then when that one is a sick
one that one will not have milk brought every day by a milkman. It
will be too late then to be beginning then when that one is so sick
that one cannot go out to order anything. One having in that one a
feeling that nothing should be wasted by any one living can have
such a way of doing with a milkman bringing milk for that one. Such
a one can have it that that one never throws away anything, never
wastes anything in living and always there is more milk there than
that one can be using in the daily living, in a kind of a way this
is very common, not about milk left, but about a way of feeling in
living and a way of acting. This is in a way common. Mostly then I
have just now a feeling mostly such a one is part of a being.
Mostly just now I have a good deal of such feeling that every one
is not a whole one that each one is not ever a complete one. One
quite young one was loving another one and that one was saying to
the one that one was loving, I only love them like you with dark
hair and brown eyes for I am a blond one and I could only be loving
a dark one. Then this one saw a picture of another one, I could
love that one said this one. But that one is a blond one, the one
this one was thinking of loving told this one and you just said you
could only love a dark one, yes that is true but I think I could
love that one, and this is very common, and always there are very
many having it always in them that they are a piece of being and
always each one is a whole one in the sense that each one is being
really in them is existing and sometimes then very often there is
to me not any kind of a whole one really in any one and anything
and now I am not really caring any more anyway about this thing,
about being being a whole one in any one in any way.</p>

<p>Always there are very many of every kind there is in men and
women who are to mostly every one knowing them pieces of living,
they are themselves too inside them. Perhaps Alfred Hersland was
one of these, I am now beginning a description of the kind of being
the kind he is of men and women have in them.</p>

<p>These then all of them have it in them that they are resisting
and some of them are engulfing in resisting and some of them are
slowly resisting and many of them are superficially attacking and
all of them have it in them to some way own those they need for
loving.</p>

<p>Mostly then these the resisting kind in men and women have it in
them to feel very strongly the completely existing of everything,
they have it in them to be certain that everything in a way is made
out of real earth the way it was done to make Adam that is to say
the resisting kind of them in their feeling have it to be certain
that a thing is existing more than that a thing has a use and can
give to them an emotion. These have it in them then mostly that
emotion is not as poignant in them as sensation, that is then their
way of being although as I have been saying some of such of them
can be engulfing, some vacant in them, some certain that to be them
is to be attacking to be quick and poignant in emotion and to be
that to mostly every one seeing them doing their living. In a way
though always it is true of all of them all of those having in them
this being I am now describing, that they have a slow sure feeling
that everything is made out of earth and has that kind of very
certain existing. Sometime I am hoping to make it completely clear
inside me and in my expressing the two kinds there are in men and
women and all the kinds there are of these two kinds of them. To
begin again with the kind Alfred Hersland was in living, the kind
he was and some of the kids more or less connected in kind with his
kind of them. I am going on now with a history of him, a complete
history of him.</p>

<p>Some always are lying when any one is asking anything and then
they come to be saying I don't know that thing and then they come
to telling the true story about that thing. That is the way they do
about everything about anything and this is quite common.</p>

<p>It is very hard to know it of any one whether they are lying
that is to say it is very hard to know it in any one whether they
are knowing the relation between what they are saying and what had
happened what is happening to them. It is a very difficult thing to
know it of any one whether they, to themselves, are saying what is
not what they are thinking. Lying, stupid being in men and women,
religion, aspiration, sensitiveness to any one to anything in men
and women, appreciation and enthusiasm, emotion and being afraid in
them of something of anything of everything of any one, of almost
every one, all these then are very interesting in men and women and
very often, very very often it is a necessary thing to know all the
being every bit of the being in any one to know it of them what
they have in them of these things inside them of lying and
aspiration and stupid being and virtuous feeling and important
feeling and religion and fear and realisation of material existing.
It is necessary then to know of some all the being in them to be
certain of them whether they are lying, whether they are feeling,
whether they are believing, whether they are understanding, whether
they are afraid, whether they are good, whether they are bad,
whether they are important inside in them to themselves inside
them. It is a very difficult thing then to know the being really in
mostly every one. Very often when some one is knowing the complete
being of some one that one is still only a piece of a being, there
is not in the being of that one a quality of completion, there is
no reason why that one from the being in that one should keep on
existing, should have kept on existing and when that one is a dead
one it is an accidental kind of thing that that one should be an
ended one, it is not a completed or a cut off thing the ended one,
and that is a very common thing to be feeling about many men and
many women. This is a kind of feeling almost every one knowing him
had about Alfred Hersland as I have been saying again and
again.</p>

<p>I will now give some description of a considerable number of men
and women of kinds connected in kind with the kind of men and women
of which Alfred Hersland was one. There will be now some
description of each one of a considerable number of men and women
each of a kind of men and women of one kind of the kinds of them
that are connected in kind with the kind of them of which Alfred
Hersland was one. In the description of these there will be an
explanation with the description of each one of them of the way
each one is a complete one sometimes to some one or not a complete
one.</p>

<p>There will then now be a description of a considerable number of
men and women, there will be then now some further expression of
the feeling some one every one has about some one about every one.
There will be now perhaps more understanding of the way each one is
or is not sometime a complete one. There will now perhaps be some
understanding of lying, aspiration, religion, feeling, being,
thinking, in a considerable number of men and women, in a number of
kinds of the resisting kind of being in men and women. To really
again begin then. Later there will be a complete history of Alfred
Hersland, later there will be a complete history of Julia
Dehning.</p>

<p>To begin now then just now with little descriptions of a
considerable number of men and women who all of them are some kind
of the resisting kind in men and women. To begin this then. Some as
I have said already somewhere earlier in my writing, some of the
resisting kind of them have it in them to have generalised feeling
that is of ideal aspiration and concrete feeling that is in
continual action and of very material seizing and holding. Some as
I have been saying already in my description have it in them to be
completely certain that to be dead is to be really truly a dead one
and always then perhaps to be a dead one is not to be really truly
a dead one and it is a good thing then to be married to one who is
certain that to be dead is not to be really a truly dead one. This
is true of some this is true of the first one that I am now
describing. This one was not meek not aggressive not arrogant not
egotistical in living, this one could have resisting in him, this
one like very many having such a kind of being was fairly slow in
action and in feeling, if he was not slow in feeling and in acting
and in listening such a one would not be certain that he himself
was doing that acting, listening, feeling, such a one would be
thinking that something was happening, it would be over and that
one would not be realising that he himself was listening, feeling,
acting, and this is very common with many having in them dependent
independent resisting being. This first one then that I am now
beginning describing had resisting being as fairly sensitive being
as slowly reacting being as not at all engulfing being, as a
complete being only this one was not quite entirely certain that to
be dead was to be a really dead one and he liked it that the wife
that he had always with him was certain that to be dead was not to
be at all a dead one. This one that I am describing, this first one
had resisting being as completely sensitive, fairly slowly
reacting, this one was not meek not aggressive in living, this one
was persistently and patiently and in detail dominating in family
living, this one was very just in thinking and in judging, this one
had not very much imagination and was impersonal in feeling, this
one had pleasant affection, this one had completely honest action,
this one had a good deal of fear a good deal of affection in him,
this one was quite a good man in living, this one was pretty
certain that everything is existing, this one had loving and such
things reasonably in him, this one could have it in him to have it
that he found himself even a better one than he really was in
living but really he was a very good one in living and though a
little he had the abstract conception of himself as a more ideal
one than he was in concrete feeling, mostly he was realising pretty
completely all that he was really experiencing, only a little he
was not realising that having a little fear in him that to be dead
was not to be really a dead one did not make in him an experiencing
that he was a better one than actual living in him made him. He was
as I was saying glad to be having a wife who was completely certain
that knowing that to be dead was not to be at all a really dead one
made every one a very much better one than each one really was in
living. This is then a complete history of the being in this one.
This one then was a sensitive, slowly reacting, fairly
affectionate, quite good, reasonably just and a little fearful and
quite impersonal and somewhat loving quite very good resisting
independent dependent one. This one was pretty completely a whole
one to himself and to mostly every one, this one then is different
from the one I am next going to be describing in being a completely
slowly reacting completely sensitive one.</p>

<p>This one that I am now describing was of a kind of one that are
very many of them quite successful in living. This is now a
description of several of them. This is a kind of resisting
dependent independent men and women.</p>

<p>These have it in them mostly to make every one feel it about
them that they are very strong ones in living, they have solidity
in them, they are like wood or iron and have a solid being in them
and every one knowing them is certain that they are good ones and
they are independent and intelligent and loyal and not timeserving
and yet always they are succeeding in living succeeding in loving,
a little arrogant but not unpleasant to mostly every one knowing
them, very successfully knowing successful people in their living
though not seeking to know such ones, it just comes to them. Some
of such ones are not completely successful in living, some of such
ones have a pride that is a little more sensitive than the being
really in them, some have a romantic imagination that is too active
for the being in them but mostly this kind of them are very
successful in living and this is to be now a little more
description of this kind of them.</p>

<p>Resisting being in them is as it were solid and firm and hard
but never aggressive being in them. It is not profoundly sensitive
in them, it is as it is with wood when in a tree it is living and
then when it is completely useful as a piece of wood to be used for
working into a shape for using and it is a solid thing then, an
honest thing then, a thing to be adapted for good using, a solid
reliable thing then, a completely existing thing then, a thing
sensitive in the sense that it repays good handling but not a thing
sensitive in the sense that a tree living having living growing
being is a sensitive thing. These then this kind of resisting men
and women who I am now describing have this in them and they have
it in them some of them so completely this being in them that they
are to many knowing them completely strong men, completely geniuses
in living without any of the weaknesses in them that geniuses most
generally have in them, that men successful in living most
generally have in them. These men are very interesting, I know now
five of such of them and only one of these five of them is not
really a successful one and that one has a pride in him and a
romantic imagination in him that is too sensitive for the solid
dead wood being in him. This kind of them of men are very
interesting to me in the being in them, they are very pleasant
companions mostly always all of them loyal, reliable, delicate in
their feeling, honest, earnest, never toadying, decently prudent
and decently courageous in living, always giving to every one a
conviction that they are a very strong one and they are mostly
always succeeding very well in anything that is a life work to them
and though they are laborious in their working they are really
pretty quick and graceful in their working generally although
strength is the quality in them that seems strongest in them but
really strength in them is the solidity of block wood, bar iron in
them really then these in their living can be completely adapted to
their living, these then can be completely succeeding in living,
these then can have sentimental feeling, and pride in them and
romantic imagination but really this cannot at the bottom of them
disturb them they are completely solid they can be completely
adapted to living. I will come back again and again to describe
this kind in men and women. I will come back again and again to
every kind there is of men and women. These then that I have been
describing have a lack in them, they are complete enough in living,
they are each one completely different from every other one, they
are themselves inside them but in a true sense they have not in
them individual being, they are the very cream of schoolmen the
very best thing there can be of any one following a master and
working with him. They are individual to him, they are themselves
completely inside them to themselves in them. These then are very
good men mostly, loyal and earnest and efficient and successful in
living. They are solidly learning and solidly resisting to be
winning. Their working in its resulting is very often a quick and
graceful and a little a dull thing. They are sensitive and strong
and active to mostly every one having to do with them. They
interest me very much, mostly unless I am a very sad one every one
is to me very interesting. Sometime certainly I will tell more and
then again some other time I will know more and then sometime I
will tell more and so on and so on of this kind in men and women. I
am altogether a discouraged one. I am just now altogether a
discouraged one. I am going on describing men and women.</p>

<p>I know one, he is of the resisting kind in men and women and he
is completely an instrument being he is so completely that in a
sense he has no volition though to very many knowing him he is
almost a crazy one in living out ideas he has in him. I know this
one, he has it in him to have vibratingly sensitive resisting
being, that is all him and always when he wishes to do any working
he must put himself quiescently ready so that something will play
on him, some influence something and then it vibrates through him
and he makes something does some work and not even really making
himself a quiescent being is volition in him, it is simply a
shutting off from himself by an almost senseless feeling of
resisting any other thing, it is not choice in him of something and
volition certainly is the act of choosing. This one as I am saying
and I know very many who know him this one as I am saying is to
very many an obstinate exaggerated self directing completely
self-directing one and this one is completely an instrument nature,
this one is like a violin a completely vibrating thing to anything
that really can effect him. This one, I know this one very well in
his living, this one in his loving is not loving as mostly men and
women are doing who love the attacking kind of them if they are
resisting kind in them, the resisting if they are of the attacking
kind of them this one as I am saying in his loving is completely
loving a resisting one, one like himself and this is very
interesting. Mostly when one needs heightening of the being in them
they get it from those very like them, for loving they need those
different from them, for courage and emulation and influencing
those like them and sometimes some love those like them and these
are mostly then instrument natures or natures needing pretty
complete influencing throughout their being but this is a very
complicated question an excessively complicated question and
sometime I am going to write a book and it will be a very long one
and it will be all full up, completely filled up with pairs of them
twos of them, sometimes threes and fours and fives but mostly with
twos of them, twos of men, of women, of women and men, of men and
women. Now to say just a little more of this one this instrument
one that I am knowing pretty well now in the living in him. This
one was not really succeeding very well in living, this one would
not be succeeding very well when he was not any longer a young man,
when he was an older one and had not any longer youthful beauty
feeling and vibration in him and then too he would come to have
fixed ideas in him, that would be a natural thing for him, and then
perhaps later he would come to be a crazy one or just one that was
failing in living. Some like him not so completely vibrating having
some volition in them might be successful in living, some like him
having a dulled vibration in them and fairly stupid feeling in them
and much desire for good eating and drinking and sleeping can be
successful enough in living. I know some of such of them, sometime
oh sometime, really truly sometime there will be a description a
complete description of every one.</p>

<p>Now I will be describing four men, I know them all pretty well,
two of them the first and the last are fairly whole ones inside
them to mostly every one, the two others are mostly pieces of
living to mostly every one knowing them.</p>

<p>I know these four pretty well then, they are all in a way of the
engulfing kind of the resisting kind in men and women, the four of
them have that in common in every other way they are very different
each one of them from the three others of them.</p>

<p>The first one has engulfing being so brightly, so gaily, so
concentratedly in him that it is a very fresh and gay and juicy
thing in him the being in him. He is quite successful in living
this one, quite successful in loving and always all his living he
has had very much loving in him. He has not much real independence
of action this one, he needs some one to start him to do everything
excepting dancing and loving, this comes to him from the mere
existing of women in the world around him. In mostly everything
else some one starts him and he is very gay then in keeping going.
When he is a sad one he does not want to see any one, that happens
sometimes to him, he cannot start himself then, no one is starting
him then, he is a sad one then and not succeeding in living. Really
he is a very lively one in living and on the whole not unsuccessful
in living. He is completely sensitive and not at all a bad one not
a bit a bad one but not really a very actively good one he has no
initiative for taking any responsibility on himself for himself or
for any one. Always though he is responsible for himself, living
gives him that initiative and he goes on living, sometimes he is a
little fussy and then he remembers his father was so before him, he
would like to be a different person not be like his father in any
way and there he is he finds himself being just like his father
after all the different kind of living that he has been having.
This one has a genuinely sensitive being, this one is not a selfish
one, self-seeking, this one is not apparently engulfing and yet
really this one is completely of the engulfing resisting kind of
them, this one has this being in him that is certain. It is gay and
sparkling in him it is well concentrated in him, it is an engulfing
resisting being that is certain. The second one, I know this one
from the history of him from letters he has written, this one has
engulfing murky being as hopeful and yet as a weak thing in him. He
needs so much stimulating that after he was not any longer a very
young one he could not get enough of it to keep going, he never
engulfed anything really in his living not himself, not any one not
any woman not any man, but he was always hopeful that sometime he
would do this thing, hope was always there in him, when he was a
very young one he was vigorous in aspiring, later he was not
vigorous in anything but always hopeful and always of the engulfing
resisting kind of them though never really engulfing or resisting
anything. This was the being in him, he was not an unattractive
one, sometime there will be more history of him written of his
loving and of his not supporting himself by working and of his
despairing and of his always hoping. This is enough of him just
now, alright then. This one the third of these four of them I know
very well indeed now and it took me a very long time to know him
but that is not what I am now telling. This one was of the
engulfing murkily resisting kind of them but he mostly was too
ambitious and had too much vanity in him and was too
self-sacrificing for any one to know it of him. He was really truly
such a one, that is certain. He had very much vanity and
self-sacrificing and affection and ambition in him and only slowly
it came out of him that he was a rather dry engulfing murky
resisting being. There will be here very little description of him,
he is a very important one to be well known because he has the
being in him so contused in him that it teaches one a great deal to
completely learn him. I like him and I know him I will now tell a
little more about him.</p>

<p>Every one is sometime a little a lovely one to me. Some are
sometimes quite very lovely ones to me, some are more some are less
lovely to me. Sometime for a little almost every one is a lovely
one to me. Every one I have been describing I will be describing I
am describing, every one I am I can ever be knowing is sometime a
little, more, a very lovely one to me. This is a very nice feeling
in me inside me when some one is really a lovely one to me. Mostly
every one pretty nearly every one certainly every one is sometime a
little a lovely one to me. Some one is very much a lovely one to
me. Each one certainly is sometime sometimes a lovely one to me.
All these I am describing have it in them to have been sometime to
be sometimes a lovely one to me. Every one, each one is certainly
sometime a little a lovely one to me. This one I am now describing
was for sometime really a quite lovely one to me. This one as I was
saying was of the dependent independent resisting murkily engulfing
kind of them but as I have been saying this was rather gently and a
little dryly in him and mostly not any one knew it of him that he
was of the engulfing murky kind of them. This one was a very gentle
one, a very affectionate one, a really very self-devoted one, a
really very ambitious one, a really very vain one, a really very
appealing one and always also a fairly aspiring one, and always
there was murky engulfing in this one but it was a little dry a
little very pretty in this one. This one was to very many quite a
lovely one. This one's living and being is quite interesting,
sometime there will be written a very complete history of this one.
This one mostly to every one who really came to know this one very
well was a piece of being not a very completely whole one. Sometime
there will be a complete history of this one.</p>

<p>The fourth one of these four of them that all have it in them to
have murky engulfing resisting being was very little to me a lovely
one. He was very really a lovely one to his wife and she was older
than he was and he really was not a bad one not a good one not a
bad one, he was not a very lovely one to most of those he came to
know in living. Every one is to me sometime a little a lovely one,
that is pretty nearly certain.</p>

<p>This one was of the engulfing murky resisting kind of them but
engulfing was in him the swallowing of very little things, he never
had it in him to do any large swallowing, he never was really
engulfing a woman he was engulfing, she needed to thrust herself
inside him and so he a little was doing swallowing and often he had
it in him to be wanting to do to be be doing engulfing but he never
really knew it in him, he was of the murky resisting engulfing kind
of them but he had it in him only really as nibbling. To himself he
was a very noble one, to himself he was almost a heroic one, to
himself he was completely a good man, completely entirely a good
one with not any mean ways in him and this really was a very
natural thing seeing that murky resisting engulfing being was a
nibbling swallowing thing in him, this could not be himself to
himself inside him, that is certain, and so to himself inside him
he was a completely good one almost a heroic one. If any one if his
sister-inlaw said to him but you nibbled and swallowed that thing
that was not a noble thing to be doing, he would be saying, I am a
good one my wife knows that every one knows that and if I did that
thing it was the right thing for me to be doing. He was not a bad
man this one, he was to himself completely almost heroically a good
one, to his wife who was never quite completely engulfed by him she
wanting to be completely engulfed by him felt him to be completely
entirely a very lovely one, to his wife he was completely entirely
a good one as he was to himself completely inside him. This is
enough now of this one, he was to mostly every one a complete
enough one, this will be now some descriptions of some other men
and women.</p>

<p>One having in him very thickly in him murky resisting engulfing
being often threatened he would kill himself and he sometimes made
a poem before he was ready to kill himself because he could not
have in living what he needed to completely content him. This is
now a very little description of this one. This one is quite an
interesting one, this one is rather strong in his living in his
being this one is fairly successful in living. This one as a very
young one was not a very adroit one, was rather reckless and given
to having things happen to him, had courage in him, was a pretty
hard one to manage, was quite a funny one. He was when he was a
young one a reckless one, quite in almost a foolish way a daring
one and in a way very many liked him very well then and not any one
then could in any kind of a way manage him. When he was a little
older then he was quite affectionate with his brother and his
father, his mother was less interesting to him, his brother was
very fond of him, his brother was older, his father liked to hear
him say funny things then, and then when he was a little older
again this one not yet any more than quite a young man he was quite
a stingy one, a very prudent one, a very openly suspicious one,
quite popular with men, not very interesting to women, quite
devoted to his brother, quite cold in his relations to any one
having any need of him, completely without enthusiasm, quite openly
suspicious as I was saying, very prudent in his business living and
quite a good business man, and as I was saying completely certain
that he should take care of himself completely that not any one
would do this thing for him. This was the being in him and as I am
saying it was interesting. When he was quite a young man he decided
on marrying and then when his mother tried to interfere with him he
told the people that his mother was a bad one and he told her that
be had written a poem and now he would kill himself and she
believed him. This one as I am saying was openly a suspicious one,
openly a man thinking only of his own well being, he was quite a
funny one, he was very popular with men, he was not very
interesting to women but they mostly did not at all dislike him, he
had been when he was a young one quite reckless and quite daring,
he always had all his living very affectionate ways in him, he
always was certain that he would be master in any house which was
his own house completely master of it and always he was a pleasant
and quite a funny fellow and he could be openly flattering and
openly suspicious and he was both all of his living and always he
was very funny to every one, very amusing, as I was saying he was
always pretty popular with men and not at all unpopular with women.
He had his passionate resisting engulfing being in him quite alive
and completely in between aggression and resisting, he was not
attacking with it, he was not resisting with it, it never was doing
one thing or the other thing neither aggressive in it or resisting
in it, he had all the qualities of it of his kind of being, they
were all complete alive and living in him, they were so to speak
not in motion, this as I am understanding is the being in him, he
had almost not any really stupid being in him, he was completely
his own being and this was completely alive, completely not moving
in him. This is the way I am now understanding this one, it is very
certain that I must sometime completely be understanding this one
for I am constantly now feeling thinking about knowing certain ones
in a way connected with this one and it is important to me that I
sometime understand them, it is important to me very important
indeed to me that I sometime understand every one, I am always
keeping on wanting to do this thing mostly all the time, certainly
pretty nearly all the time, yes always somewhere in me that is
certain, always somewhere in me, mostly all through me I am hoping
that sometime I will be understanding every one every kind there
are of men and women knowing, feeling, completely realising them,
each one, every one, and sometime I certainly am hoping to be
completely understanding several I am knowing that are a kind of
them connected in kind with the kind of which I have just been a
little describing one. I am then certainly going on with my hoping.
I will now go on with my description of a considerable number of
men and women, some men, some women, all of the resisting kind in
men and women. This one of whom I am now going to be giving a very
little description is not completely of the engulfing kind of the
resisting kind of them, he is a murky passionate resisting one but
not a really engulfing one, he is as near to being an engulfing one
as one can be without being one. He is as near an engulfing kind as
one can be who is not it at all but is completely disturbed in
loving so that it is really in him that in a way he is not an
engulfing kind of a one. This one then in a way is connected with
Mr. Hissen the grandfather of the Hersland children in his kind of
being, this one has in him religion, very completely in him but he
is not a complete one, he is not complete inside him completely all
that there is of religion in him, he is lost in loving, lost in
religion, not completely a lost one but sometimes quite completely
a lost one, has to be afraid inside him to be rescued by some one
from the quite completely lost condition of him. This one is not
then a very complete one inside him, that is natural from the being
in him. This one like some others like him loses himself from
inside him by loving feeling by religion in him, this one then does
not do this completely in him, he is a little all himself inside
him and so then this one all his living is a very incomplete one,
always then he is not succeeding very well in living, mostly then
some one masters him enough so that he does not completely fail in
living completely lose himself out from him and he too a little
helps with this being with the being in him that is in him that
makes him a little the complete thing in religion in himself inside
him. This one then in a way in loving, in religion, loses the
feeling after the emotion, must then begin again and this is a
natural thing from the nature of him, he is not at all engulfing,
he is as near to it as any one can be who completely entirely is
not it. I am finding this description very interesting. I am
understanding more and more now the being in him. This is all that
I will now be writing of him. He was quite an elegant one quite a
graceful one in his expression, in his daily living, when he was a
young one he was quite completely an idealist then, always he had
religion and loving in him. This is all I am now going to be saying
about him.</p>

<p>I have known several of a kind of them of the resisting
engulfing kind of them men and women of this kind, I have known
completely some of them this kind of them, I have known absolutely
entirely completely one of such of them, I have known pretty
entirely completely another of this kind of them, I have known men
I have known women of this kind of them of one kind of the
engulfing resisting kind in men and women, and these have it that
vanity is complete in them, pride is not in them, vanity is
complete in them, seizing anything they are thinking they are
needing in living is complete in them, elegance is very completely
in them, desiring completely successful feeling is completely in
them in such of them, feeling what they are needing to give to
themselves or any one distinction is very completely in them,
feeling about anything itself is not very much in then, realising
the complete meaning, feeling the complete elegance of distinction
feeling it completely in them, seizing everything anything they are
needing for such complete realising of distinction in themselves
and in every one is completely in them, vanity as I am saying is
completely in them, simplicity in realising that they are
completely elegant and completely needing distinction is very
important in realising any one of such a kind of them. It is a very
important thing to know it of these then that they have complete
vanity in them, that they have complete feeling for the thing for
anything any one is needing to really give to them real
distinction. These then are as I was saying one kind of the
engulfing resisting kind of them, they are completely then
engulfing resisting some of such of them and the thing they are
completely engulfingly resistingly winning is anything everything
that can give to them distinction. They have vanity completely in
them so completely in them that they have in them perfectly
simplicity in seizing anything they are needing. They have vanity
and elegance so completely in them that they have not any pride in
them they do not need to have pride in them to protect them to
themselves inside them from anything. They have vanity completely
in them, some of them have some engulfing passion in them some have
very little engulfing passion in them, such of them have not any
affection really in them, such of them mostly are not thinking
about feeling in them anything of itself in them, they have
elegance of being, they have complete vanity inside them, they have
completely in them the realisation of every one who is a
distinguished one, of themselves as having distinction in them.
Some of such of them are judging every one by the intelligence in
them, all of such of them, are always judging every one, they must
always be judging every one such a one, all the being in them is
the learning by them the distinction they must by the being in them
be seizing. They have not in them such of them the feeling for a
thing itself, they have not loving for anything itself, they have
in them the needing of seizing distinction, they have in them a
complete need of judging for they must always be judging every one
as to whether that one has distinction in her or in him, by judging
they can decide then about this thing about every one, they cannot
have the feeling for the thing that any one by loving that thing
has come to have distinction in her or in him, they have in them
only the need in them of judging whether some one has come to have
distinction and always such a one has complete vanity in being,
they have not any need of any pride inside them to protect
themselves inside them and so then, such a one, as I am saying such
a one is complete seizing judging every one for distinction. They
have then such ones the instinct for realising distinction, for
judging people and things that merit distinction, they have not
these then most completely not the emotion of the things that gives
to people distinction. Consequently for them, learning is to teach
themselves or have some one teach them to recognise and realise the
things that those people realise who have achieved distinction and
that can only be done by such of them by their learning to realise
detail in thinking and feeling, so that these judging some one as a
distinguished one can enter into that one's distinction by
realising what that one judged to be distinguished by them is
thinking and feeling. These have then to learn carefully what it is
they have seized and are seizing, these can then go on successfully
living, always these are judging, mostly these are completely
seizing what they are needing. I am hoping always hoping to be
making a complete history of all men and women completely,
completely and more completely of them, these then that I have been
just describing are connected quite closely connected all of them
with the kind that Alfred Hersland is of men and women. These I
have been describing are very clearly in me, pretty nearly
completely clearly in me and I am pretty nearly completely
understanding them and some of them certainly are of such a kind of
them I will be describing again and again. I still am going to be
describing a considerable number of kinds of men and women and some
now are not very engulfing of the resisting kind in men and women.
Of some of these that I am now going to be describing I am going to
be describing inquisitiveness in them. Inquisitiveness in men and
women is very interesting. Some have very much of this in them,
some of these I am going to be describing have it almost as
complete being in them the amount of inquisitiveness in them, and
the meaning of inquisitiveness in them. I am now going to be
describing a considerable number of men and inquisitiveness and
loving and affection in them and slowness and succeeding and
failing in their living is very important in them in the
understanding of them. There will be then now a very considerable
number more of men and women with resisting being in them that I
will be liking to be describing. To begin again now with
diminishing this considerable number. I am beginning now again.</p>

<p>Curiosity and suspicion these two things are often very
interesting, this one that I am now beginning describing had these
very completely in him, and always then this one had these more
simply in him than any one knowing him was realising, he had
inquisitiveness in him for the mere satisfaction of asking and
knowing, he had suspicion in him because suspicious feeling was a
pleasant feeling in him, he used inquisitiveness and suspicion in
living, that is certain, no one knowing him could deny that of him,
but often he was not using such things, he was just inquiring, he
was just asking because his attention was caught and he liked to
know everything and he liked asking and often suspicion was in him
because suspicion was an easy way to be feeling for him about
everything and a very pleasant feeling to have inside him. This one
was of the resisting slightly engulfing kind in men and women,
resisting and engulfing was equally in him. In many I have been
describing engulfing is stronger than resisting, in this one
resisting and engulfing was pretty nearly equally divided in him,
he was thick but not too thick not too dry in his being, he could
take complete impression from everything he was learning, he was
always asking, he was continually suspecting, he was quite
successful in living. This is now to be a little a description of
the questions he was always asking, of the suspicion always in
him.</p>

<p>Some men and women are inquisitive about everything, they are
always asking, if they see any one with anything they ask what is
that thing, what is it you are carrying, what are you going to be
doing with that thing, why have you that, thing, where did you get
that thing, how long will you have that thing, there are very many
men and women who want to know about anything about everything, I
am such a one, I certainly am such a one. A very great many like to
know a good many things, a great many are always asking questions
of every one, a great many are to very many doing this with
intention, a great many have intention in their asking, a great
many just have their attention caught by anything and then they ask
the question. Some when they are hearing any one talking are
immediately listening, many would like to know what is in letters
others are writing and receiving, a great many quite honest ones
are always wanting to know everything, a great many men and women
have a good deal suspicion in them about others and this has in
them not any very precise meaning. A great many are liking to know
things but do not do much asking, a great many have not any such a
feeling. A great many have a very great deal of suspiciousness in
them, a great many have almost not any of this being in them. This
one that I am now describing was one who was always asking and
mostly always every one was wondering what was this one meaning by
the questions he was asking and often later this one would perhaps
be using information he had had from asking questions but asking
questions in him was not a thing in him that came from wanting to
be using some time information he was gathering, very often asking
questions in him was simply from a catelling of his attention by
something. Once this one asked some one he was visiting, just
suddenly,&mdash;and this door here does that lead into the hall or
directly out into the garden,&mdash;and that was all he said then
about this thing and afterwards every one was thinking he would be
using this against them but really then this one was wondering did
the door lead to the hall or directly to a garden. If such a one,
one having this kind of a way is of the resisting engulfing type
and fairly successful in living and slow and sudden and quite
suspicious of every one, almost certainly then every one will think
it to be true of such a one that this one always is asking
questions for purposes of winning, perhaps of cheating, certainly
for some distant manoeuvering. This is very common. There are very
many having in them rather engulfing rather resisting being who are
slow and sudden, who are a little absent when any one is asking
them anything, who are suspicious and quite trusting, who are often
asking questions for in their being being in slow action and always
more or less moving they have it that their attention is always a
little wandering waiting for something inside them to do something
and so then these of them are very busy having their attention
caught by anything and asking questions about everything and very
often every one knowing such of them are very suspicious of them
and mostly these then too have constant suspicion in them as
constant as the questioning in them. This is very common then with
this kind of being. I am not yet through with my description of
this kind of resisting engulfing men and women. A great many men
and women have very much suspicion in them of everything of every
one. A great many men a great many women have steadily suspicion in
them of everything of every one. A great many have this in them
from the beginning of living in them. A great many very many of the
resisting, dependent independent very earthy men and women have
complete suspicion, little steady suspicion of everything of every
one always in them. They do not have it from experiencing in them
they have it in them as a natural thing, they have it in them like
a child walking and certain that every step they are going to be
tumbling. This is very common, very many men very many women very
many having resisting being in them have it in them to be
suspicious always of every one of everything. This is in them very
often when they are quite kindly quite trusting, very many then
having resisting being have it to have very naturally in them
always in them always steadily in them from their beginning that
they are suspicious of every one of everything, always suspicious
always steadily suspicious inside them, this one then that I am
describing has suspicion always in him, there will be now a
description of several of this kind in men and women. I am now
going on with my description of one, who was naturally a completely
suspicious one.</p>

<p>Many having resisting being have it in them all their living
when they are beginning and then on to their ending have it to have
suspicion always naturally in them and this is a natural thing for
them to have in them because they having resisting being have it in
them to be knowing that always some one is doing attacking.
Resisting being in them is in meaning that always some one some
where is attacking, resisting being is in them in some of them, in
very many men in very many women as having in them completely
naturally always very much suspicion. Very many men and women have
in them completely all their living very complete suspicious
feeling very many men and women with resisting being. Very many men
and women with attacking being have suspicion in them completely in
them, sometime I will be telling very much of them. Very many men
and women have hardly any kind of suspicious feeling ever in them.
There are very many ways of having suspicious feeling many kinds of
ways many degrees of such feeling, now I am giving a not very long
description of one having in him very complete suspicious feeling,
very much suspicious feeling about men, very much very complete
suspicious feeling about women and this one was quite a successful
one in living and this one had very much inquisitive feeling in him
and this one was pretty completely resisting in his being pretty
completely engulfing in his being and always very many felt it
about him that every bit of asking in him and every bit of
suspicion in him was really deep wisdom in him and always then he
had completely resisting being in him completely engulfing being in
him, complete suspicion in him, complete inquisitiveness inside
him, and always then he had enthusiasm and very much feeling about
something and always he was asking about everything and always he
was having suspicious feeling in him and altogether he was
sufficiently a wise one, and very often he was just asking because
he saw something and very often he was just suspecting because he
had resisting being in him. This is one then that is to me a
completely interesting one. Every one is to me a completely
interesting one, this one is to me very completely an interesting
one. I like feeling the being in this one, sometime yes certainly
sometime I will be telling all the feeling I have in the complete
being in this one. As I am saying suspicious feeling is very
interesting, very very interesting. Sometime later I will tell very
much about one kind of them of the resisting kind of them that have
it in them to have suspicious feeling as a completely interesting
thing in them. I hope I will not be beginning now to tell about
this kind of them. Perhaps I will tell a little about such of them
in among this considerable number of men and women of the resisting
kind of them I am just now describing. I really do not want to
begin now about them. I will not begin now about them that is
certain. I will completely understand them later and will be
telling then about them. I certainly will not write anything now
about them. That is now certain. I have been writing now about a
considerable number of the considerable number I am now describing
of the resisting kind of them. I will now begin a pretty short
description of another one of them. That is to be a little
description of one having rich resisting being and being a little
too quick perhaps quite a little too quick in ripening. This one
had in him quite, some inquisitiveness in him, not any suspicion in
him. This is to be now quite a short description of him.</p>

<p>This one then as I am saying was of the resisting kind of them,
that is to say resisting was the way of winning in him, that is to
say this one was in a way slow in reacting, that is to say this one
in a way was needing to own those this one needed for loving, this
was all true and this was all not true of this one and this one was
completely of resisting being, this one was all made completely all
of only resisting being. This one then really was very early a
completely highly developed one, this one was very flowing in the
completely creating power this one had inside him, this one was a
quite inquisitive one, this one had hardly any suspiciousness in
natural ordinary daily living in him, this one was really not
owning the one this one needed for his loving. This one as I was
saying was of the resisting kind of them, not of the engulfing kind
of them, of completely sensitively resisting being and the
resisting being and sensitive being was pretty nearly equal in this
one, it was pretty nearly as sensitive as resisting but not quite
completely so in this one it was a little more sensitive than
resisting and so this one was quick in developing, early in
flowering and this one was always trying to be a slower one and
this one really never was in living a really slow one. This one was
as I was saying not a suspicious one, resisting being was not
strongly enough in him as protecting to give to him a suspicious
feeling toward everything and every one. This one was not really
owning the one this one needed for his loving. This one could only
own one this one needed for loving by getting rid of the one this
one needed for loving and then this one would not be having the one
this one needed for loving and then where was this one, he was
where he needed the one he needed for loving and taking her back
again made him then lose the power of owning this one, the only way
he could own this one was by getting rid of this one or by secretly
letting some other one love him, in this way then this one to
himself inside him could own the one he needed for loving. He
really could own the one he needed for loving by sending her away
from him, he then did not have near him the one he needed for
loving, to himself inside him then he could own that one by
letting, by making some other one love him and mostly then he
dreamed of this thing, he did this thing. This is now a clear
complete description of one having resisting being.</p>

<p>This is now to be a description of another one having resisting
being, not engulfing resisting being, just resisting being, this
one was a very nice one, a very pleasant gentle, sensitive, fairly
resisting, sometimes angrily resisting one, this one had some
suspicion in her in living, this one could have very often an
injured feeling, this one had quite a good deal of inquisitive
feeling in her, this one needed to own to a considerable degree
those this one needed for loving, this one had children and
children were to this one a piece of her cut off from her that were
as it were equal to her and she was as they were, the same in
living, thinking, feeling and being. This one as I was saying was a
gentle, often injured, fairly angrily resisting one, quite
inquisitive, with enough suspicious feeling to be defending other
ones when it was not at all her business to be interfering and so
this one a very nice a completely in a way honest one could do
something that was not a pretty thing for this one to be doing.
This is what this one did once in her living.</p>

<p>This one that I have been describing had not real suspicious
feeling, this one was of the resisting kind of them but this one
had very much more sensitiveness than resisting being and resisting
being was in this one not a kind of thing to make of this one
really a suspicious one. This being in this one resisting being in
this one was in this one a sense of really being gently minute by
minute in living and so this one when this one was adding up
anything would always be adding it by one and one and one. This one
had it to be very careful in living and always this one would be
counting everything by one and one and one. Counting everything
this one was spending by one and one and one and one and one and
one was in this one resisting being was in this one recognition of
real existing of everything. This one could have very much injured
feeling, this one could have injured feeling very often could have
it for herself for other ones for any one and this one sometimes
was very mixed up in doing anything by injured feeling for one and
not for another one and for that other one then and for this one
herself this one inside this one then and this one then was
sufficiently complicated by injured feeling inside this one and
injured feeling was the only complicated thing in the being and in
the living of this one. This one was as I was saying a very gentle
a very sensitive one, this one was a resisting one, this one was
not at all an engulfing one, this one from the mixing of a little
softly resisting being and very much gentle and sensitive being had
in this one suspicion only as injured feeling. Some having this
kind of being and having sensitiveness not delicately and
sensitively in them and resisting slightly engulfing in them are
completely suspicious and completely injured always in their living
and these very often have it in them to having being persecuted as
a mania in them. There are very many having such being in them,
later I will be telling a few little things that sometimes are
happening in living in the living of this kind of men this kind of
women. As I was saying this one I am now just a little describing
was not at all not even a little bit an engulfing one, this one was
a softly resisting one a really earthy one really feeling always in
living that existing anything existing is really there in being and
always this one was doing all the counting this one ever was doing
by counting one and then one and then one and then one. This one as
I was saying had not really suspicious being, this one as I was
saying had much and quite often very warmly really injured feeling,
for herself in herself, for some other one, for any other one and
this injured feeling was in the being of this one the only
complication. Once some one, a young cousin, this one I am
describing was then coming to the beginning of the middle living in
this one, once a young cousin told this one, the cousin was very
fond of this one, that the cousin never wanted to be eating dinner
at the house of another one another cousin of this one, that he
liked very much indeed being with his cousin but he did not like it
at all for a place to be dining, this was then all that was said
just then. Later then the first cousin the one that said this to
the one I have been describing, asked this cousin who had just come
to be engaged to be married then to come and take dinner with him.
This one then the cousin asked to dine by the other cousin of the
one I am describing happened to mention to the one I am describing
that he was going to be dining next week with this cousin. This one
I am now describing had then completely inside this one an injured
feeling for this one that was going to be dining with the other one
that this one should be going to be dining with the other one when
the other one would not dine with that one because it was not a
pleasant thing and so this one I am describing told the one going
to be dining with the other one what that one had said about dining
with him. Then of course this one would not dine with the other
one. And all this came from there being in this one I am describing
a soft resisting, a gentle sensitive being with not any
suspiciousness in being and not any engulfing and not any egotism
so that this one had to have in this one that everything that could
be aggression or suspicion or worldliness in living or individual
feeling was in this one injured feeling, a very little angry and a
very much hurt feeling and so this one had injured feeling quite
often and very much for this one, for some other one, for any other
one.</p>

<p>I will describe now very little a very different kind of one
from that one I have been just describing. There will not be then
very many more of them of the considerable number left then. There
will perhaps then still be left about six of them, six kinds of
them and perhaps there will be added a few more to make another
generalisation but really there have been already done a
considerable part of the considerable number of the resisting kind
of them that I am now describing. This one then is quite a
different kind of a one from the last one I was describing. This
one as a whole one is like a cannon-ball lying on a bag of cotton,
the cannon-ball lying on a cotton bag as a complete thing was the
whole of this one. This is in a way a description of this one,
there will be now a very little more description of this one.</p>

<p>Children are always thinking are very often thinking that their
mothers are very lovely looking and that is very often because
mostly the child is always close up to the mother close to her when
the child is looking and mostly being close like that as a habitual
thing is to find that one a lovely thing a lovely looking one.</p>

<p>This one that I was saying was a whole one which was like a
cannon-ball resting on a bag of cotton was the cotton part finding
the cannon-ball lovely looking being always so close to that thing
and the cannon-ball was finding the cotton lovely looking that
being so closely always to that thing. To explain then. This one
then was one having solid enough dull not very lively, not lively
at all fairly dry resisting bottom, a bottom that might have been
engulfing if it had been a lively dark wet thing, but this was not
true of it then at all that it was engulfing, it was entirely not
engulfing. As I was saying many having engulfing being and not
having resisting being enough in them are very aspiring and this
one then had aspiration like what might have been engulfing in the
bottom being the bottom being which was not at all engulfing. Some
of this kind of them have it as a bottom being something that is
more nearly engulfing and these then have more active aspiration as
ambition, these have then more nearly some power of very nearly
engulfing something but this one was as little engulfing as such a
kind of them can be in living, just as amiable and ideal in
aspiration and aspiration in this one as I was saying was like the
cannon-ball resting on the bag of cotton, it was completely
beautiful always to all that cotton and this one was always living
near light and beauty near to the aspiration, the cannon-ball and
this one was then as I was saying amiable in intention and clear
and large worded and hesitating in expression. This one is an
interesting enough one. I am knowing quite well three of these of
them, one is more nearly engulfing, one has of him the very largest
size in bags of cotton, one and this is the one I am realising in
now describing was a little skimped in the cotton foundation. This
is not a funny description, I was not certain I should say anything
of the cannon-ball and the cotton, I was almost certain I would not
say anything in this description about the cannon-ball and the
cotton, it was not in me a natural way of conceiving any one, some
one conceived this one as a cannon-ball resting on a bag of cotton,
I used that in my description, this is not to me a natural way of
talking, I have been using it here as I am saying. Now I will begin
describing another one and that will be leaving only a few more to
be describing of the considerable number of them that I have been
describing of the resisting kind of them. This one that I am now
beginning describing is of the resisting and sensitive and
suspicious kind of them and now I will be telling a few stories
about such of them. It is very hard with some to be realising what
kind they are this kind of them when they are quite old ones. It is
a very difficult thing to be realising of some kinds of them one
has been knowing before the beginning of their middle living what
they are as old ones, these in living. When one is oneself a fairly
old one, one will be knowing a little more perhaps of this thing,
one is knowing a little of something of this thing from old
relations one is knowing and one knowing all the family of these
then is perhaps a little knowing what these are as younger ones in
living. These that I am now describing are a kind of them that when
they are old ones no one is paying much attention to them. They
have then as old ones the same being in them I am now describing,
they are mostly not any too successfully living all their living,
they have when they are old ones the same being in them, mostly
then not very many then are paying much attention to them then,
these when they are old ones in living, these that I am now
describing.</p>

<p>These then that I am now describing are a kind of them that have
sensitiveness that is complete suspicion in them, these are of the
kind of them that are themselves completely important to themselves
inside them, they have resistance in them much less than
sensitiveness as suspicion in them. Suspicion in these of them
comes out of the sensitiveness of them before the sensitiveness in
them gives to them inside them really an emotion and so in these in
living suspicion is as it were the whole of them, the complete
emotion always in them. This sensitiveness in them that is in them
a suspicion before it is an emotion in them from anything is always
every moment in such of them. That these have it in them that
sensitiveness makes for them suspicion before they have from
anything a complete emotion is the reason that these mostly are not
very successful in living, they are a little successful many of
them and when they are older ones or old ones, no one, not any one
is paying much attention to them. These then in a way are not
really earthy, not really resisting, not at all engulfing, these
then in a way are not certain that dead is dead, that things really
are existing, these can have superstition and religion and prudence
and fear and almost a crazy kind of thinking in them. This is now
some stories about some of them.</p>

<p>I feel it and I brood over it and it comes then very simply from
me, do you see how simply it comes out of me, you see, I feel it
and I think about it and then I know it and I know then it is a
simple thing, why are you always saying then it is a complicated
one when really it is a very simple one this thing, do you see now
it is a very simple thing this thing, do you see that this is a
simple thing like everything why then should you make of it a
complicated thing when it is a simple thing, do you see now that it
is a simple thing this thing, why do you make everything a
complicated thing, do you see, this is a simple thing, everything
is a simple thing, you make everything a complicated thing when
everything is a simple thing, do you see, it is a simple thing, you
say it is a complicated thing, do you see, everything is a simple
thing that is certain, do you see, that is certain. Very many are
always saying this thing, it is very common, to be certain, to be
really certain that some one is really feeling thinking seeing that
that one is really feeling thinking seeing what that one really is
seeing feeling thinking is certainly a quite rare thing. Mostly
then it is a difficult thing, a patient solemn thing to be really
certain that any one is really feeling seeing thinking believing
what that one in the way that one really is feeling thinking seeing
believing is feeling thinking seeing believing anything. These then
I am now describing who are completely for themselves suspicious
ones, who have it in them to have emotion in them become suspicion
before it is a real emotion of anything for anything about anything
in them, these have it completely to be certain that every one is
doing feeling seeing the thing that one is feeling doing seeing
believing when such a one is not agreeing with them, when such a
one is feeling thinking believing doing anything that such a one is
doing that thing for a mean or wicked or jealous or stupid or
obstinate or cursed or religious reason, it is not a real feeling
believing seeing realising, that this one having suspicion in him
is certain. One of such a kind of one once liked very well some one
and then that one forgot to give this one five cents that this one
had paid for that one and then this one hated that one, had no
trust in that one for this one was certain that that one knowing
that this one was too sensitive to be asking did not think it
necessary to pay that one, he never could believe that any one
forgot such a thing. This is an extreme thing of a way of feeling
that is common to all of these of them. Another one once was always
certain that some one who one time told him that he would sometime
later be successful in teaching meant it that he would not be
successful in painting and that this was because that one was
jealous of this one although that one had just met this one. This
one was certain that every one sometime would do a mean thing to
him and always each one to him sometime did this thing. Once one
said to him I hope you will be successful in the city where you are
going to earn your living. That means that you think my way of
working rotten, you know very well no one making a living there is
doing good work to your thinking, it would be a better thing to say
what you are thinking straight out, said this one. One of such a
kind of them was always asking and always getting and always he was
certain that every one was doing the thing they were doing because
they wanted to make of him a poor thing and some of such of them
are always having difficulty with partners and others and any one
and then as I am saying when they are older ones not any one pays
very much attention to them. These are some and more, or less like
them are very many a very great many always living who have it in
them that anything to them makes an emotion that is suspicion
before it is real emotion in them.</p>

<p>In some connected with them, sensitiveness that in these I have
been just describing turns into suspicion before it is sensation or
emotion about a person, a thing done, or anything, in these turns
into cleverness in them or self-protection in the sense of doing
nothing and breaking all engagements and giving up all obligation.
In some it turns before it is really a sensation into a sensual
passion. This is all very interesting surely to any one really
believing really being certain completely certain that different
ones are different in kind from other kinds of them are really
different in experiencing. This is in a way a very difficult thing
to really truly believe in one, that some one really has a
completely different kind of a way of feeling a thing from another
one. Mostly every one in practical living needs only to be
completely realising their own experiencing and then need only to
be realising other ones experiencing enough to be using them, the
ones experiencing. It is a very difficult thing to really believe
it of another one what the other one is really feeling, it is such
a very long learning anybody must be having to be really to be
actually believing this thing. I do this thing. I am a rare one, I
know this always more in living, I know always more in living that
other ones are really believing what they are believing, feeling,
what they are feeling, thinking, what they are thinking, always
more and more in living I know I am a rare one. There are not very
many having this very completely really in them.</p>

<p>To go on now then describing a little more some of these I have
been last mentioning. Some of these are having their sensitiveness
making of them clever, or self-protecting, or sexually wanting
anything, without having really emotion from the thing from the
sensitiveness in them. These are of the resisting kind of them and
might to some seem to be engulfing but they are not really
resisting or engulfing. Sensitiveness turns into suspicion,
cleverness, self-protection, sexual action before it comes as an
emotion and these mostly then never have sensitiveness in them
leading to emotion by reaction to a person or thing or action.
These then are interesting. To be telling then now a little more of
some of them.</p>

<p>These then all of them have it in them that everything turns
inside them to suspicion, to cleverness, to self-protection, to
sexual emotion, to sensibility of a kind that is a thing that is
called sentimental, before it comes to produce emotion from the
thing about the thing in relation to the thing itself inside them.
There is one, I knew this one quite very well once and last week
again I was seeing this one and now I am quite a good deal
understanding this one, this is one and in this one everything was
in this one sensibility of a sentimental kind, this was in this one
not very much as suspicion as I was saying it is in some, and in
this one everything, nothing had any meaning excepting as arousing
a feeling of sentimental sensibility that was the same thing
whatever was the thing that came to this one as touching this one.
This one was pretty completely to every one completely socially one
and this is quite a common thing. Sometime a history of her and her
two mothers and her sister will be written and I have been telling
that it will be written to several of them. She was as I was saying
completely such a one and as a younger one was sharp and
interesting and then she was a married one and then she was large
and dull. This was after she succeeded fairly at the beginning of
her middle living in coming to be a married one. She had not then
any reaction at all in living for she was then in her married
living living with bottom being reacting and there was no bottom
being in her, living, at all in her then and every one said it was
such a surprising thing that she should be then so completely a
submissive and indifferent and inefficient and a little a timid one
then when she had been before her being a married one so altogether
an emotional and dark, expressive and clever one but it was just
this thing that I am saying that I am now pretty well understanding
that makes it a completely a natural thing, she had not ever had
anything that did not turn to sensibility before it reached her in
her and when she was a tired one and married and fatter then there
was not this then. She is an interesting one, really she is a very
interesting one, she is quite a pretty ugly one now but not in any
way now an active one as now I am completely realising. It is an
interesting history the history of all of this kind of them. It is
a very interesting thing the history of this one. The complete
family living of this one is a thing I could make a remarkably
interesting thing to any one, that is certain. I have been telling
that to this one. This one did not like very much to hear me say
that thing, it is a certain thing that it is an interesting thing
to me and I could tell it so to every one, I have been telling it
to this one that I can make it a completely interesting thing. This
one was not liking it very well then. Sometime I will be feeling
completely the telling of it and then I will be telling it, I have
told this one that I will tell it then. This one will not know then
it is this one. That is the very nice thing in this writing.
Sometime I will tell everything, everything. Mostly I do tell
anything.</p>

<p>One of this kind of them I have been describing has it that
everything is in her as cleverness, or self-protection from any
stimulation, never an emotion about a thing. This one would, if she
could, have real emotion but it never is even a little bit in her
of herself, inside her. Sometimes it is, a moment, a real feeling
in her, something from something, when it is made to be in her by
some one by force holding her from having it turn into cleverness,
suspicion, sentimental believing, selfprotection and so giving it a
chance to sink into her so that she has a reaction to it really in
her. This has a few times happened to her. This one is always
feeling that some one should do this for her. Holding her from
being her way in her so that emotion can be in her has been done
for her. She never can do this for herself, ever. She is in her
feeling certain that every one in this way should be doing for her.
She is all her living needing that some one do this thing. She has
it in her as a feeling that the world owes it to her to do this for
her. She has not ever any really grateful feeling, she has only the
emotion that some one wins in her for her. It is an interesting
game to play in her and very many do it for her. Then they lose the
power and she has to have another. She does not know that she is
certain that the world owes this to her.</p>

<p>This one then would have it in her to be certain that to be dead
was not to be at all really a dead one, this was what this one
wanted to have in her as realisation, as emotion, this conviction
is what this one was very certain the world owed her. This is what
this one wanted that she should have in her, have as emotion inside
her, this emotion in her is what every one knowing should do for
her inside her. Very many coming to know her tried to give it to
her, always she was wanting to have this inside her, the
conviction, the emotion that to be dead was not to be really a dead
one. This was the history of the living in her. She had in her as I
was saying to have it that nothing gave to her really an emotion
about that thing. Every thing touching her aroused in her
suspicion, cleverness and self-protection. She wanted to have
conviction and emotion that to be dead is not to be really truly a
dead one. She wanted this in her, this realisation and emotion, in
her, and then too she would be certain, she knew then she would
then be really certain completely certain that every one was a very
much better one than each one really was in living. She was
certain, pretty nearly certain that if she were really completely
certain that she was really knowing that to be dead was not to be
at all a really dead one she would then be knowing that every one
living was really a very much better one than each one really is
living and this would be a very pleasant feeling for her to be
having. Always then she was needing to be completely certain that
she was really knowing that to be dead was not to be really at all
a dead one and always she was unconsciously feeling that the world
owed her owed it to her to give her this realisation. This was a
history of her. Perhaps she never came really to have it in her,
perhaps she came to have it a little in her, always some one was
working in her for her, this is a history of her. This is an
amusing thing, this history of this one. Sometime a very detailed
history of this one will be an amusing thing to be writing, to be
reading. Now I will not tell any more detail of this one. Some as I
was saying have it in them to have this kind of reaction I have
been describing as sexual emotion and one such a one that I am
knowing is quite an interesting one, quite an extraordinary one and
sometime I will tell some of the exciting things in her living but
not now, now I am going on describing three more kinds of resisting
being. These I have been describing are resisting being in the
sense that they would be resisting if they had any real emotion in
them about anything but really they have not that in them and
resisting being in them is a thing in them one is knowing in them
from resemblances between them and those really resisting in
living. Enough of this kind of them then now as I am saying, I will
begin again some time with them, that is almost certain.</p>

<p>I am now going to give very little description of three other
kinds in resisting being and then perhaps a few more will be adding
themselves in but I am hoping that not very many will be adding
themselves then because I will be wanting to be going on writing
the history of Alfred Hersland which will certainly be more
interesting now that every one knows so very much more of
resisting, of resisting engulfing being in men and women.</p>

<p>This one I am beginning describing is a little connected on with
these I have been just describing and is a little connected on with
the next one I will be describing which is to be the kind of
resisting being who are continually attacking. This one then is not
an easy one to be describing, I will begin a little slowly now to
be thinking and then I will do a little a very little writing. To
commence now with my thinking. I am thinking now of this one.</p>

<p>This one is of the resisting kind in men and women, might have
been of the engulfing kind of them, was not at all of the engulfing
kind of them was only a resisting one, had a feeling of being an
engulfing kind of them which made this one have very much emotion
of dominating with stern action. This one was of the resisting kind
in men and women, this one had a little, had quite a good deal, had
very often, had in a way always the emotion of dominating by
engulfing, this made this one in her inside her in her feeling and
often in her talking melodramatic in description, really this one
was resisting, quite nicely, quite successfully a resisting one,
not at all really an engulfing one, quite a good deal an engulfing
one to herself inside her in her feeling. Feeling herself to be
being an engulfing one gave to this one melodramatic sensation of
being an important one, this one was quite a bit an important one
in living by the resisting being that was really winning being in
her. A little with an animal or with her children she was a little
to herself then and a little to them an engulfing one, really she
was not at all an engulfing one, she was certainly completely a
resisting one. As I am saying being to herself inside her an
engulfing one gave to her melodrama of herself to herself inside
her, melodrama in herself to herself inside her in her living with
other ones, really there was not melodrama in her living mostly in
her, a little with a little child or an animal around her, really
not at all in living in her. She had from this melodrama, in her
later, a history inside her of the past living in her and this was
of her as a completely dominatingly engulfing being in her living.
This one then certainly was in living simply a resisting sensitive
fairly of the resisting sensitive being, dependent as dependent
independent ones have it to be dependent in them, not at all in
bottom being an engulfing one. This one then is connected With the
group I have been describing by this conception she had of her own
being but she was different from these I have been describing for
she had not the being in her of being something from sensitiveness
in her as these have it really in them. In her it was melodrama.
She was really steadily winning resisting sensitive bottom
dependent independent being. This one is connected with the one I
will now be describing because this one made out of this being she
had in her a little to herself and to very little ones near her a
kind of attacking being, of dominating by stern attacking and this
was from the, to herself, engulfing being in her. Really this one
was not really at all an engulfing one. Really this one I have been
just describing is not so completely clearly in my feeling as I
would have them I am describing. It is there, but not so absolutely
there as a realisation, that I can be content with owning what I am
knowing. I will not then say now any more about this one. I will
now say a little about another one, one who was of the resisting
kind of them, not at all of the engulfing kind of them, one who was
to herself and to every one always an attacking one. This one was
attacking the way a boy is when he is thrown into water and is
scared then and every kind of way is hitting the water so as to
keep the water from drowning him. Such a boy makes very much
splashing. This is the kind of attacking this one had in her
living, this one was so scared she was always hitting out in every
direction, this one had little moments of knowing she was a timid
one, mostly she was certain she was a very attacking successfully
attacking one.</p>

<p>This resisting one was very often, and mostly always, bragging,
was very often certain that to be the one that one was in living
was to be one quick and poignant in emotion and quick in vigorous
attacking. This one was this to a considerable number seeing this
one doing living, knowing this one all her living. This one was
this, was an attacking one to mostly every one seeing this one
doing all the living in this one. In a way as I was saying it was
true of this one. A boy thinking he is drowning is hitting the
water every kind of way to keep it from drowning him and as I am
saying he is making very much splashing. Resisting then was the
being in this one, hitting in every direction was the living in
this one, bragging always that this one was doing more hitting than
any other one was always in this one, engulfing was not at all in
this one. This one knew sometimes that she was really a timid one.
This one was not winning by resisting, not by sensitive dependent
being, because this one was always hitting away making a whirlwind
around this one so that not anything could come near this one to
attack this one. This one was not really a successful one in inner
living, not in loving, not in winning permanently any one, not in
winning permanently with working, resisting was the way of winning
for this one and this one was not ever in living really resisting
to anything, this one was always hitting in every direction, this
one was really a slow one, this one was to herself a very quick
one, this one was hitting in a quick enough fashion but she was not
hitting anything she was attacking, hitting in every direction one
must sometimes hit something, this one sometimes hit something, to
this one she was always hitting something, to a good many knowing
this one she was always hitting something. This one was very
certain in a foolish way of being timid and always hitting out at
anything that she had really intuition, that she was really certain
that to be dead was not to be at all, why not a bit, a dead one.
This one was telling this very often. This one was telling this in
a way once to several listening. This one is a very common type of
resisting being and I know very many of this kind of them and all
of them are certain of themselves to be certainly knowing whether
to be dead is to be or not to be a really dead one. That is
complete attacking, by them. This one was telling of the way this
one was certain. This one was telling that she was certain some one
was a bad one. She knew it she was certain, she knew it by
intuition, she knew it by her feeling, she knew it because she knew
that to be dead is not to be at all, not the least bit a really
dead one. This one as I am saying was completely a resisting one
but this one never was really resisting, this one was, even she
herself knew that a little, a timid one, she knew she was afraid
always with a man. This one was a very typical one of the resisting
kind who are always attacking and attacking is not at all the way
to winning for them. These then are incessant in attacking, they
are never at all resting from attacking, mostly they know that they
are not winning in loving, mostly they think they can be certain
that to be dead is to be or is not to be a dead one, they are
mostly always not really winning in loving. This one that I am
describing was not ever winning in loving, this one was certain
that this one had a feeling that was certain about being a dead one
was to be not a dead one. This one was certain of the intuition
this one had of every one. This was really in this one from the
dependent being in this one and the stupid attacking in this one.
This is the way this one told of one complete intuition.</p>

<p>There is a whole series of this kind of them that I know in
living. I saw yesterday afternoon two of them together and one of
these two of them did not do very much attacking and she was
successful in loving and she was very dependent and very
independent in the way dependent independent kind of them have it
in them to be winning. I knew once very well another one of this
kind of them who was always doing considerable attacking and always
doing very much bragging and always wanting to be thinking inside
in this one and telling it to every one when this one heard
mentioned anything done that this one was doing everything quicker
and stronger and farther and shorter and slower and happier and
sadder and weaker and completer and every other kind of more or
lesser that any one can conceive of anything, than any one. But
always this one was really solidly winningly resistingly
dependently independently living. This one had it as a simple
conviction that this one could do everything, this one did mostly
everything, this one was certain that to be dead was to be a dead
one, attacking was almost in this one not a stupid thing but it was
in this one stupid being because after all this one was completely
a resisting one and dependent independent was the being in this
one. This one had dependent and independent being so well balanced
in her living that almost attacking and bragging was not stupid
being in this one but really it was stupid being in this one in the
final meaning of the being in this one because this one really was
winning in loving and living and working by resisting being and all
the attacking being in this one was hitting to keep away attacking
from coming and was not really the natural way of winning fighting
as an attacking and so then this one was of this kind of them I am
describing but this one was completely and entirely an efficient
one. The other one that I have begun describing the one that was
the first one of this kind of them that I mentioned in my writing,
was always splashing always hitting in every direction, was in a
way quite a competent one but really was a timid one, was one not
successful in loving, was one that as a poor one would not have
been successful as a whole in living, was not successful as this
one thought this one inside this one to be a successful one but was
to very many knowing this one a very, a strikingly successful one.
Really this one was not a successful one in loving and that is
interesting. This one had two kinds of ways of having stupid being,
one was as timid being, one was as attacking being. Of the
attacking being I have been giving a description. Of the timid
being I have given only a very little description. As I was saying
this one had it to think that this one was certain that to be dead
was not to be at all a dead one. This was a comfort to all the
stupid being in this one to all the dependent being in this one.
This was a comfort to the stupid being in this one, to the timidity
and to the attacking feeling and acting always in this one.
Intuition, feeling this one had intuition was stupid being in this
one. This one was not at all in many ways a stupid one. This one
was a stupid one when between timidity and universal attacking this
one had intuition. "Yes I can always tell what any one is, what a
man is, what a woman is, what a child is, what a very little child
is," said this one. "I am very certain in my feeling, just listen.
Once I met a man, I knew this man was just the kind of a man I knew
he was, I was certain when I saw him, every time I saw him I was
certain, once he came into this house and I shook hands with him, I
was more than ever certain that this man was the kind of a man I
had thought him. I don't see him very often, I would never meet him
if I could avoid him, I never make a mistake about a person about a
man or a woman or about children when I have an intuition." This
one as I am saying had stupid being from a timid feeling,
completely a timid feeling, from being quite the dependent kind of
the dependent independent kind of them and from the attacking
acting, attacking living that was always to this one and to every
one all the living in this one. This one liked the feeling of being
certain that to be dead was not to be at all a dead one, this was
very satisfying to the timid feeling and the attacking being in
this one, this was stupid being in this one, this one was not wise
in loving or in religion, this one was quite efficient in every day
living, this one to very many was quite a successful one, to very
many a brilliantly successful one. This is all I will be writing
now about this one, this is not enough really about this one, I
ought to be writing very much more about this kind of them, all I
think about this kind of them is inside me quite sure, quite
certain, I do not yet think all that can be thought or felt about
this kind of them, I do think and feel more about this kind of them
than I have just written. I have not just now a very patient
feeling about writing about this kind of them. I want to be having
soon a completely patient feeling in writing the description of all
resisting being, of all resisting engulfing being, in writing the
history of Alfred Hersland. I will now write one more description
and will so be ending just now the considerable number of resisting
ones I have been describing. I will then go on to a little
generalising and then to patiently feeling in me the history of
Alfred Hersland and all resisting engulfing being.</p>

<p>When I have not been right there must be something wrong. Every
one says to me I am always certain I am right about everything and
I must be certain of that thing because otherwise there is
something wrong and that is a wearying, wearing thing and then I
must be beginning learning everything.</p>

<p>I have been very glad to have been wrong. It is sometimes a very
hard thing to win myself to having been wrong about something. I do
a great deal of suffering.</p>

<p>I have been glad to have been wrong and I have felt certain that
this was making me a really joyous wise one. I have been very sad
to have to bring myself to be certain that I have been wrong about
something. This is now a little more history of me and the kind of
suffering I can have in me. This is a little a description of the
suffering I do have in me.</p>

<p>When I have not been right there must be something wrong. That
is what I say to myself inside me. That is what some one sometimes
says to me. This has been said to me. This I do say to myself
inside me. When I have not been right there must be something
wrong.</p>

<p>This is in a way the meaning of all living in me. This is the
way I have suffering in me. When I have not been right there must
be something wrong. I have been very glad to have been wrong. It is
sometimes a very wearing thing to have been wrong about
something.</p>

<p>I have it in me in being that I am resisting in being, I am
fairly slow in action and in feeling, if I am not slow in acting
and in feeling and in listening I am not certain that I myself am
doing that acting listening feeling, I would be thinking something
was happening, it would be over and I would not be realising that I
myself was listening, feeling, acting. When I am very slow in
listening feeling thinking realising then I can still need to have
it that I am still to be slower in doing anything. When I have not
been right there must be something wrong. I may then perhaps be
quicker in listening feeling realising, I must then be slower in
concluding. I have very much wisdom. I want sometime to be
completely understanding every one so that sometime I will be right
about every one. And now I am not knowing anything at all really of
the feeling any one has in them when they are between fourteen and
eighteen. I certainly will be needing to know this thing. I know
now I do not know at all the feeling in such of them, those being
at that time of living, I cannot then really be right about every
one yet, that is certain. When I have not been right there must be
something wrong. I know that very well in me. Some one says I feel
that in me. I certainly do feel that in me. I am hoping sometime to
be right about every one, about everything. I do. I certainly do
hope this thing. That is to say I want to realise every one, I want
to write a history of every one. Sometime I want to be right about
every one. Perhaps I am right now about some. Perhaps I am right
now about a good many men and women who are and were and will be
living. Perhaps I am right about almost all of them. Certainly when
I am not right something is wrong and I must know it in me, in them
then. I want to write a history of every one. Sometime I want to be
right about every one. Perhaps I am right now about some. Certainly
I am right now about a very great many men and women about the
being in them. Certainly I am right now in my realising of a very
considerable number of them, of men and women who were and are and
will be living, of a very considerable number of kinds in men and
women. Sometime I want to be right about every one, I want to
realise every one. Sometime I want to write the history of every
one. Always when I am not right something is wrong. Certainly I am
right about a very great many, that is certain. Sometime I want to
be right about every one. I want to be completely realising every
one sometime. This is what I am wanting. Sometimes I am very glad
to have been wrong. Sometimes it is a very wearing thing bringing
my feeling to the realisation that I have been wrong about
something. Sometimes it is such a tempting thing to let it go that
I have, been right about something. I want sometime to be right
about every one. I want sometime to write a history of every one,
of every kind there is in men and women. It would be such a
satisfaction always to be right about every one, such a certain,
active feeling in me. I want sometime to be sure when I know
something that I am completely right in my certain feeling.
Sometime I want to be completely certain. I am one that in this way
am wanting to be completely certain, am wanting to be right in
being completely certain and in this way only in me can it come to
be in me that to be dead is not to be a dead one. Really to be just
dead is to be to me a really dead one. To be completely right,
completely certain is to be in me universal in my feeling, to be
like the earth complete and fructifying. This is doing talking. I
will now begin again. I really am wanting to be sometime right
about every one. I am wanting sometime to tell about secrecy in
those having in them resisting being, Sometime later in the history
of Alfred Hersland I will be discussing this thing.</p>

<p>I have now described the considerable number of kinds of the
resisting kind of them that I was going to be describing and I have
now finished doing this thing. I will now be adding a very few not
only of the resisting kind of them but of both resisting and
attacking ones to make another generalisation but really there have
been already done the considerable number of the resisting kinds of
them in men and women that I was going to be describing. These few
little additions are now just for finishing and to be a little
commencing explaining relation between kinds that are resisting and
kinds that are attacking and kinds that are kinds in men and
women.</p>

<p>Lena, Maria and Hetty and others that I am not now naming adapt
their loving to any one who is interesting. They then want, not to
own them, not to influence them, but to feel power in themselves
through them, to know inside them that they are knowing by knowing
them the things the one who is interesting is knowing. These end up
very often by marrying a man very popular with men who only like
them out of all women, who can only be owned by them, of all women.
Some are possessed by a passionate desire for the thing the
interesting person is realising and such ones are a little
different from these others. Some want distinction for themselves
and so they are different. Some, Hortense and Martha are such of
them, care enough about the man they are loving being interesting
to need to love one having genius, these two have more real
personal passion, more founded courage in them than Lena or Maria
or Hetty. Some want to do the thing itself as if they themselves
could do the thing that makes the distinguished one a distinguished
one even if they know they cannot do this thing to make of
themselves in it a distinguished one. Some of such of them do not
know that they began to do that thing from loving a distinguished
one and some of such of them are so stubborn in doing that thing
that they cannot learn about that thing from the one they are
adapting themselves to, the distinguished one.</p>

<p>I am thinking. I am not yet certain. Every kind I have been
describing of the resisting kind of men and women can be found with
a different action in the attacking kind in men and women. I am
thinking. I have now described a kind of them and I know some of
them and some of them I have known in loving, known very well in
loving and some are of the attacking and some of the resisting kind
of them and I have been describing them together so that any one
can see why I am thinking that there are attacking kinds
correlative to the resisting kinds I have been describing.</p>

<p>Lena and Maria are of the resisting and Hetty and Hortense and
Martha are of the attacking kind of them and all of these have a
way of loving that in a way is common to all of them, a way of
adapting their loving to any one who is interesting to feel power
in themselves through them. But all of this is one thing and now
being in Alfred Hersland is something. I have been describing a
considerable number of men and women having resisting being in
them. Alfred Hersland had resisting engulfing being in him. Having
been understanding so many having resisting being in them makes it
more certain that I am understanding the being in Alfred
Hersland.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland had resisting being somewhat engulfing resisting
being in him. He had not anything at all of the attacking kind of
being in him. He was all of engulfing resisting being. Alfred had
it in him to have his being in him so that it was a little
passionate in him, not very affectionate in him, not so as to be
very good in him, not really ever very bad in him, sometimes as
aspiration in him, more or less as ambition in him, sometimes as
virtuous and didactic in him. The kind of being he had in him was
of a kind of being that in some having it in them makes of them
being devout in religion, quite aspiring in their living, quite
ambitious for succeeding, makes of them mystic in religion so as to
let themselves be absorbed all existing, some of them having this
kind of being in them have religion in them. Some having this kind
of being in them are meek enough in living and yet a little
dominating in family living and some of such of them need to have
as a wife to them some one very vibratingly existing to give to
them enough stimulation to make them keep really alive inside them.
All these then are of the resisting the dependent independent kind
of them. Some of them have the being in them inside and some of
these then are trying to engulf every one near them to be lost
inside them, to be swallowed by them and some of them are not
interested in very many persons near them but some of them they
need to have engulfed by them and so then Alfred Hersland was of
the kind of them the resisting dependent independent kind of them,
the kind that own those they need for loving. Many of such of them
do not really in their living need any one for loving. Alfred
Hersland to my feeling has being in him as pieces only of being.
This is now to be more history of him. He was of the resisting
engulfing kind of them, his being was a little passionate, not very
affectionate, not so very good, not really so very bad in him,
somewhat as aspiration in him, a good deal as ambition in him,
possibly as religion in him, certainly as weakness in him, not
altogether as successful in him. He had his being in him and to
very many being was not complete in him. He was not a very strong
one, he was not altogether a weak one. This is now to be completely
a history of him and the living he had all together in him.</p>

<p>Very many never learn anything from the experience with
themselves they have in living. Very many are never at all learning
anything with the experience they are having of themselves in their
living. Very many are always expecting out of themselves what they
could have certainly been learning that they would not ever be
succeeding in doing. Very many are not all their living learning
anything from the experience they have with themselves in their
living. This is very common. Alfred Hersland in a way was such a
one. All the Hersland men in a way were such ones in their being,
Mr. David Hersland in his living, Alfred and David Hersland in
their living. Alfred Hersland was in a way such a one. This is now
to be a complete history of him.</p>

<p>There is always, perhaps there is always something in what every
one says about any one. In some way anything, everything any one,
every one says about any one is a true thing. Each one says
something about some one and that one says something says a number
of things sometime about herself or himself and everything any one,
anything any one says about that one anything that one says about
that one everything that one says about that one is in a way a true
thing. Always then sometime there is a complete history of some
one, sometime there will be a complete history of Julia Dehning.
Sometime there will be very many descriptions of some one, there
will sometime be very many descriptions of Julia Dehning. Now there
is to be more description of the being Alfred Hersland had in him
always in all his living. Very soon now there is to be very much
description of the living in Alfred Hersland and of the people
Alfred Hersland came to know in living, and now I am feeling a
complete realisation of the difference between affection and
passion and soon there will be a description of Alfred Hersland
knowing the man who was a musician and of Alfred Hersland knowing
the woman who was the sister of the first governess the Herslands
had had living with them in the ten acre place in Gossols. These
two were a little important to him in his early living as I have
already been saying. I am very interested just now in the
difference between passion and affection and I will now tell about
a man and then I will describe the musician Alfred Hersland came to
know in his early living a Mr. Arragon who was really foreign.</p>

<p>I am always more and more realising that some are pieces of
being always in living and some are not such pieces of being in
their whole living. Later then I will be describing being in Alfred
Hersland and all the living he had in him. Just now as I am saying
I find it that I am writing about a man who had inspired affection
in him for beautiful things in living and this one was a puzzle to
me and then I knew it of him that it was inspired affection not
passion he had in him. Arragon had passion that was not poignant in
him but it was passion, this one that is now strongly in my feeling
is one having inspired affection and not at all any passion in him.
This one in his young living to the beginning of his middle living
was to very many knowing him, to himself always inside him one
having really passion about beauty in living. This one had then
inspired affection not passion in him but inspired affection was so
freshly poignantly in him and his intellect could use it so well
for him that to himself then and to every one then he had real
creation of passionately understanding beautiful things in living.
More and more then this one in his middle living was not any longer
creating his realisation of beauty in living, this one was then
living on the approximation others made for him of everything this
one wished to have beautiful around him and for living. This one
then never could make for himself the beautiful luxury he was
needing. Inspired affection for beauty in him awoke in others the
need of creating as nearly as these could do what this one needed
as beauty in living. This one could not create his own taste in
luxury in living, he could not create his own taste for a woman. A
woman, everything in his living created itself to approximate, to
the taste this one would have created if this one could have
created the thing this one wanted to have to arouse in him inspired
affection. This one then after beginning his middle living never
created anything, never in his living did this one create loving
not for beautiful things not for a woman, this one had inspired
affection in him and to himself and to every one it was passion, it
never was passion in him and more it came out in him as more and
more in living this one needed that other ones by their creating
approximated to what his taste would have been if he had had
passion instead of affection for luxury and beauty in living and so
this one more and more was declining because this one came more and
more to have affection for things others created to be what this
one would have wanted to have in living if this one could have
created what this one was needing to have to arouse him to inspired
affection and this is a history of this one. Now this one as I am
saying had not passion in him, not for beauty not for a woman not
for anything, but this one had inspired affection and it is an
interesting thing that this one had as a woman who chose herself
for him one who was as this one was of the attacking type in men
and women, this is an interesting thing. I am very happy in
realising this thing. I am hoping that this is really the complete
history of this one.</p>

<p>Arragon who was a tittle important in the living of Alfred
Hersland was different from this one I have been just describing.
Arragon had passion in him but it was not poignant in him but
brilliant and emotional and sentimental. I will now begin a
description of his being and of what Alfred Hersland lived through
with him. Later then I will be describing Ida the school-teacher
and the kind she was in men and women. Now to begin again with the
musician.</p>

<p>I find it very interesting to know the difference between
affection and passion, I will now just a little describe a kind of
them having passion of which Arragon the musician who came to know
Alfred Hersland when Alfred was just beginning being a man inside
him was one. I know three very well of this kind of them and very
many more or less connected with this kind of them. All these I am
now describing, the one I have just been describing are of the
attacking kind in men, the independent dependent kind of them.
These then that I am now describing all have really passion in them
passion that makes them creating or feeling in themselves creating
feeling of something of very much in living. To begin then. Alfred
Hersland was of the resisting engulfing kind of them, these I am
now describing are of the passionate creating seizing attacking
kind in men and women. There are many kinds of ways of being of the
attacking kind in men and women that is certain. I am already
realising a considerable number of them. I am realising pretty
completely realising a very considerable number of ways of having
resisting being in them and I have been already describing, very
well describing some of those I am always now realising. I am
realising now some of the attacking kinds of them. There are many
kinds of them and I am realising some of the kinds of them. I have
been realising Mr. Henry Dehning and Martha Hersland and Redfern
and I was saying that Cora Dounor was of this kind of them but I am
thinking in that I was mistaken I am thinking Cora Dounor was
certainly of the resisting kind of them. There are almost border
cases that is certain I am realising some of that kind of them and
I will be describing that in describing the sister of the first
governess the Herslands had had living with them. Now I am
describing a musician Arragon who was a man having in him as I was
saying passion but this was not poignant in him although to himself
and to mostly every one it was poignant in him because he had so
much weakness and sensitiveness and romance in him. This one then
was of the attacking kind of them as I was saying. I am remembering
that I mean by attacking being those having it in them that emotion
is poignant like sensation, that use and purpose and organisation
and synthesising and imagining and everything in relation is as
true in them in beginning as the thing being existing. The
resisting kind of them have it in them that a thing being existing
is more real to them than use or purpose or meaning in anything,
the attacking kind of them have it in them that emotion is as
poignant as sensation and use and purpose and meaning and relation
as primary as existing. Mr. Hersland was of the attacking kind in
men and women, so was Redfern as I was saying so was Martha
Redfern, so is the one I have been just describing as affectionate
and never passionate in living and now I am describing this being
in another one in Mr. Arragon a musician and I will tell quite a
little now about him and Alfred Hersland liked him very much when
Alfred was coming to be a young man as I have several times been
saying. Arragon had attacking passion in him but as I was saying it
was not very poignant in him. In Redfern it was poignant but not
rich enough to sustain him, in Mr. Hersland it was poignant and
rich but not steady in him, in the one I have been just describing
it was as affection and not passion and in Arragon and it made him
a pretty good musician, it was rich but not poignant in him and he
made up for it in him by weakness and sensibility and feeling
himself to be a really great one and by having moments of really
inspired feeling when almost he made it in himself by loving by
weakness by talking to be poignant inside him.</p>

<p>This kind then of which Arragon was one is quite common. Every
kind of being is quite common. That is certain. There are very many
always existing of each one of all the kinds there are in being.
That is certain. Anyway it would be certain but it is certain to me
because I am more and more realising I know a considerable number
of each kind I am ever knowing. More and more in living I come to
know enough of each kind of them to make groups of them. Sometime I
will be able to make a diagram. I have already made several
diagrams. I will sometime make a complete diagram and that will be
a very long book that will tell all about each kind there is of men
and women. But just now I am thinking of this one kind of them, the
kind of which Arragon was one.</p>

<p>This kind of them as I have been saying are those having in them
attacking passion. As I was saying I know just now pretty well
three of them. I know too this one that I am now describing, that
makes then four of them. In a way as I am saying Redfern was one of
such of them. There are some connected with this kind of them that
have this being in them passionate attacking as highly suggestible
emotion in them. That is one kind of them, sometime there will be
much description of such of them. Some are connected with this kind
of them that have it in them to be so stupidly in them that it
really makes of them that all their life they are obstinately
resisting everything, these are connected with Mrs. Redfern, these
are connected with Julia Dehning, these can sometimes sometime in
their living get an impression but mostly all of their living they
are obstinately resisting losing their attacking passion. There
will sometime necessarily be very much description of them. Then
there are some who have attacking passion so sensitively so
delicately in them that mostly they are delicately vibrating and
only sometime is the thing going fast enough in them to make such
of them really attacking. Some of such of them are very lovely ones
in all their feeling living, sometime there will be a long
description of a lovely one. These then will be leading to a whole
group having in them flavor realising as complete existing and
sometime I will tell so very much about such a kind of them. And
then there is the group that do not have it at all as passion but
as affection as I was saying. And then there are some that are
steadily pressing in attacking, some who perhaps in their living
are always really winning. Then there are some in whom passion is
emotion before it can be acting as passion and all these groups are
of course extremely interesting. Now I am describing one group of
this group of them who have it in them to have attacking passion in
them and some have it in them poignantly and they are weak in
living, and some have it poignantly and their natures are not
abundant in them and some have it in them poignantly and they are
rich in beginning and they are always all their living in beginning
and some have it poignantly in them and are rich in being and are
rich in developing in being and in living and some have it
poignantly in them and nothing is good enough to hold them and some
have it poignantly in them and they are not strong enough to keep
anything and some are practical with it and some are not at all
practical not even sensible with it and some do not have it
poignantly in them and this musician Alfred Hersland knew in his
younger living was one of such of them.</p>

<p>I like thinking about kinds of them in men and women. I like
feeling men and women each one as of one kind of them and that I
can that sometime I will know others like them. It makes it to me a
very pleasant world for living. It makes it simple to be certain
that each one every one has their own being in them that each one
every one is of a kind in men and women and that always there are
existing very many of each of these kinds of them. This is a
pleasant thing for me to have as certain in me. I know then there
can be a history of each one and of all kinds all the kinds in men
and women. This is a pleasant feeling, this is comforting to me
just now when I am thinking of every one always growing older and
then dying, now when I am thinking about each one being sometime a
sick one each one being sometime a dead one. This gives to me then
a pleasant feeling knowing kinds in men and women now when I am
thinking that sometime each one will be an old one and then each
one will be a dead one. I can understand that knowing there are
kinds in men and women would not be a comfort to every one. I can
understand this thing. I have it in me as a very pleasant feeling
that always there are kinds in men and women and always there are
very many existing of each kind of them. I have it in me then as I
am saying this thing as a very pleasant feeling as a pleasant
complete feeling, as a completely contenting feeling and I am
knowing sometime each one will be a dead one and I am knowing each
one has their own being in them and I am knowing each one is one of
a kind in men and women and as I am saying I am having a pleasant
completely completed feeling and always then it is a comfortable
and calming thing this being certain that each one is one of a kind
of them in men and women and that there are always very many of
each kind existing, that each one has their own being in them is
then completely interesting, that each one sometime is to be a dead
one is then not discouraging, and so then I am having a completely
pleasant and completed feeling, I who am completely certain that
each one is of a kind in men and women, I who am always almost
always knowing several of each kind of them I come to know in
living, I who am expecting sometime perhaps to be knowing all there
ever can be, were or are or will be of kinds in men and women. I
have then even with sombre certain feeling that each one is always
an older one and sometime a dead one I have then knowing each one
is of one kind in men and women I have then a pleasant feeling, a
contented a completed feeling as I have been saying. I have a quiet
sombre feeling I have not so much an afraid feeling in being living
now when I am certain, and I am knowing them, that there are a
number of kinds in men and women, not such a great number of them,
quite a number of them. Each one is themselves inside them, each
one every one is of a kind in men and women. This is to me a
completely satisfying thing. I am beginning again now to describe
one kind of them, one of one kind in men and women.</p>

<p>This musician, whom as I was saying Alfred Hersland knew in his
younger living was of the sensitive passionate attacking kind in
men and women but passion was not really poignant in him,
sensitiveness was very spread out in him, to himself and to mostly
every one passion was poignant in him and he could be ruining
himself by loving but passion was not poignant in him and in a way
this made him a very good musician, sensitiveness was in him and
not concentration and this is a kind of them that to very many
knowing them are those who are not successful because of passion
and of weakness in them. Mostly those of this kind of them who have
passion as poignant in them they have a different way of not
succeeding, they do not come so nearly to succeeding, they do not
appear again when they have gone down with the sensitive passionate
weakness in them, they have less power of recuperation. Some of
these succeed very well in living, there certainly are some of
every kind there is in men and women who succeed very well in
living, very many of this kind of them come very nearly to
completely succeeding, very many of them have very much weakness, I
am getting a little diffused about them, I have several in me all
at once and they are crowding and they are coming out as a facile
mixing and I am beginning again now with each one of them.</p>

<p>Very many of this kind as I have been saying have not passion
poignantly in them, very many of this kind of them have passion
very poignantly in them, all of this kind of them are very
sensitive in being, they are all of the sensitive passionate
attacking kind in men and women. Two of those who were and are
crowded in me just now are of the kind of them not having the
passion poignantly in them. Three of those that were crowding each
other in me of this kind of them are of the poignant kind in
passion of this kind of them. I will go on a little with these
poignant kind of them and then I will go on with Arragon the
musician who had not passion as poignant in him.</p>

<p>To begin then again. To begin with those having passion
poignantly in them of the sensitive passionate attacking kind in
men and women, the sensitive passionate attacking independent
dependent kind in men and women.</p>

<p>This one that I am now thinking about describing had passion
poignantly in him that is certain. He had the conviction of being
always completely creating everything in his living. He had passion
poignantly in him that is certain, he was creating some part of his
living, he certainly was not in any way completely creating all the
living he had in him. Very often he was certain that he would be
creating everything in his living if there were not so many things
to make him nervous to disturb him. Mostly to himself he certainly
could be creating everything in his living. He certainly did create
something of his living, he certainly had passion poignantly in
him. As I was saying to himself he was completely creating all his
living, not that to himself he really was creating all his living
for always and that he was always feeling he had very much to make
a nervous restless person of him, but certainly he was to himself a
being that could be creating everything in all his living. Passion
was poignantly in him that is certain, he did create something in
his living that is certain, more and more in his living he was
having nervousness in him and not creating everything in his living
in the way that to himself it was certain he could be creating
everything in all his living. Always more and more then it was
right for him to be seizing creating everything he could be seizing
creating in his living. More and more then he had this in him,
always all his living he certainly was creating something of his
living, always lie was certain he could be creating everything in
all of his living, always he had nervousness in him and this was to
him that things were interfering to keep him back from creating
everything in his living and so more and more he would be seizing
creating anything and so more and more to every one he was such a
one and more and to himself, always to himself he was one who
should be creating everything in all his living. This is then a
complete history of him. Passion was certainly poignantly in him,
he certainly was not ever creating everything in his living, he was
to himself one who certainly could be creating everything in all
his living, he was then one who always more and more in his living
would be seizing creating anything. This then is a complete history
of one, a very complete history of one and I am understanding this
complete history of this one. Every one has their own being in
them, every one is of a kind in men and women. Only a very little
sometimes this is not an important thing inside me to me. Sometimes
it is not an important thing inside me, sometimes it is a little a
dreary thing, making of everything that there is not anything
inspiriting to be a live one. Sometimes it is a little this way in
me but mostly always it is an important thing inside me that every
one is their own self inside them, that every one is of a kind of
men and women. Always to me, to be a dead one is a sombre thing, to
be certain that it is existing, always there has been in me the
being very much afraid of this thing, always it is to me a sombre
thing in living, sometime later in the history of David Hersland
there will be very much description of this sombre feeling in some.
Mostly as I am repeating it is an important thing inside me that
each one is themselves inside them that each one is of a kind in
men and women. Mostly and I am saying it again and again it is an
important thing, always an important thing, mostly always an
important thing. Each one is themselves inside them, each one is
one of a kind in men and women, this is an important thing always
in my living, it is sometimes a very pleasant feeling, it is very
often a very pleasant feeling in me, mostly always it is completely
an important thing inside me. I am living, I am certain, I am
important in me in my realising that each is themselves inside them
that each one is of a kind in men and women, I have very often a
very pleasant feeling, I have sometimes a very sombre feeling. I
have just now a good deal a quite sombre feeling. I am beginning
now again telling, feeling, being certain of the kind of being
there is in one kind in men and women. Always each one is to me
completely their own selves inside them, I have never a sombre
feeling that that is not a certain thing. Always each one is
themselves inside them, always each one is of a kind in men and
women Always kinds are connected with other kinds in men and women.
Sometimes I want to be describing lots and lots of kinds in men and
women, I want to be going on and on and describe one and then
another one and then connections between them and then perhaps I am
mistaken and I am hurrying and crowding and then I am not certain
and then I am wondering perhaps it is not completely an important
thing, perhaps not anything is inspiriting in living, but always in
me really I am certain that it is an important thing in me and I am
telling that each one has always their own being in them that every
one is one of a kind in men and women, mostly then this in me is
important feeling, mostly this is in me pleasant and exciting,
sometimes there is in every sombre feeling, always there is in me
that it is interesting that each one is themself inside them that
each one is of a kind in men and women. Mostly always I am
important with this thing.</p>

<p>I am important with this thing. There is a kind of them then of
the attacking kind of them that I have been describing. These have
sensitive passion in them. In some it is a very poignant thing in
them, in some it is not such a poignant thing. I have described one
in whom it was a poignant thing. In some in whom it is a poignant
thing it is religion in them, in some it is denying in them, in
some it is aspiration and these are disappointed idealists in
living but this is not what I am telling, I am describing now a
musician, one having a very good concentrating intelligence in him,
a spread out vibrating sensitiveness in him, an aspiration to be
religious and exalted in all feeling, a wanting to be always
loving, a succeeding in being very often very complicated in much
loving, a success in living and then a good deal of failing and
then a very great deal of failing and then not altogether failing.
As I was saying passionate being was not poignant in him, he had a
very great deal of it in him, he was a good musician, he was a
foreign one, he was in Gossols and then he was not altogether
failing not altogether succeeding, there he was living, he was to
very many knowing him an adventurer in living, really he was one
not having passion as very poignant in him but having in him a good
deal of it in him of this non-poignant passion, a very great deal
of sensitiveness and aspiration in doing much loving and perhaps
having religion, not so very much aspiration for succeeding or
failing. Alfred Hersland as I said in beginning about his knowing
this man came to know him when Alfred was coming to the beginning
of the ending of his young living. This one was then a little
important to him, not very important to him, not any one was very
important to him then, he was slowly growing up then and he had his
being in him and he had it as being that at that time in his living
not any one was very important to him, this friend and teacher was
as important as any one was then to Alfred, he was a little
important to him, I am remembering very well now the being in
Alfred Hersland. Alfred Hersland had it in him that he was then
living the living of people near him, he was doing then everything
those near him were doing in living, he was then living the living
of Mr. Arragon and doing everything he did that he could do with
him. Alfred was as I was saying of the resisting engulfing kind of
them having in him very much aspiring in living, having in him a
fair amount of passion in living, having in him a very considerable
feeling for distinction and elegance and beauty and richness in
living having in him very considerably at times violent feeling in
him of wanting to be doing with every one he was knowing what they
were doing that he wanted to be doing with them. He had then very
much pleasing feeling in doing with him what Arragon was doing in
living, as I was saying Alfred Hersland really had musical feeling
and musical understanding in him, he never had it at all in him
that he wanted to be a musician. As I was saying Mr. Arragon was a
little but was not very important to Alfred Hersland inside him,
not any one could be then really important to Alfred Hersland
inside him then, Alfred had his being inside him then, Alfred was
of a kind in men and women, that was all the history of Alfred
Hersland then and he was living the living of those near him and he
was doing everything he was doing in his living with those he was
then knowing and he was then doing everything they were then doing
in their living. He was as I said before in a way then of the
feeling of his natural rich American living but really always he
was living the living and doing everything that they were doing of
those near him. He was as I was saying of the engulfing resisting
kind in men and women and he had in him a fair amount of passion in
living and always then he was living, he was doing everything those
near him were doing in living. Mr. Arragon was at one time very
much with him. He was a little important as important as any one to
Alfred Hersland then. Not any one was or could be really important
to Alfred Hersland then. Alfred was of the engulfing resisting kind
in men and women, not very strongly really resisting, not very
strongly really engulfing, quite very strongly aspiring, quite
strongly feeling distinction and elegance and beauty in living and
richness as I was saying, quite often angry in resolving and very
angry in beginning doing what every one near him was doing in
living. He had his own being then, he was of a kind in men and
women.</p>

<p>He was very pleasant to himself in being with Arragon and he
liked it very well and it was a rich feeling in him that Mr.
Arragon was having him with him in doing his living. Not anything
was completely important to Alfred Hersland then.</p>

<p>I am not content, I have not had it come out without pressing
the description of Mr. Arragon the musician. It should come out of
me without pressing without any straining in me to be pressing, I
can be doing thinking to be helping, I should not be doing any
pressing and any straining, I have been doing a little it has not
come to be a complete thing simply coming, it is to be then to
rebegin to come out from me. Always each thing must come out
completely from me leaving me inside me just then gently empty, so
pleasantly and weakly gently empty, that is a happy way to have it
come out of me each one that is making itself in me, that is the
only way it can come to be content for me in me, it can come out
fairly quickly very slowly with a burst or gently, any way it feels
a need of coming out of me, but being out of me I must be very
pleasantly most gently, often weakly empty, this one then Mr.
Arragon is not so happily then out of me, he is then still there
inside me, I will let him come again when he is more completely
ready, of the kind he is in living that has come out very
pleasantly from inside me, his own being in me has not come out to
be out of me so satisfactorily. Sometime then he may be better
done, to begin again then the being and the living Alfred Hersland
had in him. Some are a very long time puzzles to me, this one the
musician Mr. Arragon is not a puzzle to me, he is quite completely
in me, and all of it is understood inside me, pretty well
understood by me inside me, it is the coming out of me that has not
been satisfactory. It has come out of me as little pieces never
making a complete one, I will be a little slow and then it will
come better done, I hope I am certain of this thing. I am not
waiting, I am forgetting so that this one can come when this one
can come as a satisfactory one without my disturbing this one by
any impatience about this one. I have been describing very many men
and very many women many of the resisting, some of the attacking
kind of them, as I have often been saying there are many kinds of
mixing a bottom attacking breaking through resisting nature in the
same one, pressing through resisting nature in the same one, acting
separately with resisting being in the same one and resisting being
in the bottom doing all kinds of twisted complications with
attacking being in the same one. There are very many kinds of
mixing, I have described some of them, and then there are some and
these are certainly very difficult ones in whom the character of
the being is completely oppositely acting and there are border line
cases where the one is almost the other kind of a one. And
sometimes then I think it is all foolishness this I am writing and
thinking and feeling and having as important being and then I give
in to not thinking or feeling or being an important one and then I
see it again and I am simply certain and I am naturally thinking,
feeling each one as a kind of a one in the way I have been telling
and I am then again a completely important one. Alfred Hersland in
his living knew a number of kinds in men and women. I am beginning
now very regularly again the history of the living and the being in
him. Alfred Hersland as I have certainly been realising is of the
resisting more or less engulfing kind in men and women. As I was
saying those having in them resisting being are those having in
them realisation of things as existing as more in them than as
things having relation. Those having in them resisting being have
not emotion in them having really poignancy in them like sensation.
This is then a thing to be now completely believing. Those having
in them resisting as their complete way of being in living are
those having In them as I was saying earthy being in the way of
really being certain that everything that each thing is really an
existing thing, these have it in them that completely in them
existing is the thing they know inside them that everything each
thing really is really existing. As I have, said often there are
many variations in this thing and there are those having this being
who come from the way of having this being in them to be certain
that not anything is really existing and all that is complication
and I have been telling I will never be ending my telling of all
these kinds of ways of being but again and again I am certain that
the resisting kind in men and women have it in them to be certain
as a bottom being that really each thing is existing. Now some as I
am saying of the resisting kind of them are of an engulfing kind
and these too are certain that each thing they are engulfing is
really a thing really existing. These then too have it that
sensation is in them more poignant than emotion, that a thing
existing is nearer knowledge in them than things being in relation.
The attacking kind in men and women are just the other way as I
have said and I will be saying. The resisting kind in men and women
are such then, they have complete realisation naturally in them
that things that each thing is really existing. Now see what is
true in them. They have this in them, they have curiosity and
imagination based in them on the real realisation in them that each
thing is existing. Yes. In a kind of them of which Alfred Hersland
is one this is not solid in them although the being in them is this
kind of being in them. This realisation of things being existing is
in such of them but these being comparatively intermittently
resisting and engulfing their curiosity and imagination is
sometimes quite often disconnected with the realisation that things
that each thing is really existing. These can have it in them to be
aspiring without being then founded in them on a realisation that
each thing is existing, these then can have engulfing passion in
them that does not really seize the thing they could be realising
as really existing. These then come to be quite considerably in
their living that they are a part of a being. Curiosity can in such
of them turn into cleverness in living for it is not then based in
them on the realisation that each thing is really existing.</p>

<p>This is being in Alfred Hersland. He liked being with Arragon,
he had really musical realisation in him then and always he could
have it in him. He liked being with Arragon, liked realising music
with him, he had also very much then in him a pleased feeling of
being doing everything in living with Arragon that Arragon was
doing then in his living. Mostly Alfred Hersland did what he did in
his living, did with them what others did in their living as being
something he was then doing but there was in him with Arragon a
little more important and pleasant feeling of himself to himself
inside him by doing with him with Arragon what Arragon was doing
then in living. Alfred was beginning then a little too to pass this
on to his brother and his sister, this was the beginning of being a
little aspiring and also a little being a head of family living in
his being. He had really then some realisation of musical meaning,
he did then everything he was then doing with Arragon and he was
doing then pretty nearly everything Arragon was then doing in
living. This then is the beginning the little beginning of middle
living in Alfred Hersland. As I was saying Arragon was not then
very important in Alfred Hersland, he himself inside him not really
yet in being was really the only important thing inside him in
Alfred Hersland could be the only important thing really inside
him. In a way Alfred was not one really to be deeply influenced by
anything and that is a natural thing in him. In his middle middle
living he was really more effected by some, all his early middle
living, all his young living he certainly had none to be really
important to him in him or for him, he was different inside him at
different times in this living, sometimes more sometimes less to
himself inside him in him, but always then he had his being in him
and always then in a way the whole of him was part of being, and
always then he was doing everything he was doing with those living
near him and mostly he was doing everything they were doing in
living, and sometimes he was quite sometimes not so much important
to himself inside him, and always in a way he was never in being in
living cut off really from rich American living. He knew at this
time as I was saying Olga who was Ida the sister of the first
governess the Herslands had had living with them, Ida was then a
school-teacher, Alfred laughed at her, he liked her, Arragon liked
her, there was not much history of this liking for her. Sometimes
Alfred saw a good deal of her, once he wrote her a real love
letter. She was in a way angry then and told him he was not a good
man and should not come to see her. Arragon thought there would be
some history of a feeling in himself for her, he found out for
himself and from what Alfred told him about himself and her that
there was not being really a history in either one of them knowing
her. She was in a way a queer one to mostly every one knowing her
that there was not a history in any one's knowing her. I will try
now to describe her.</p>

<p>I am having a glimmering of understanding two, one a man and one
a woman and they are very different from each other and with them
are very many and a considerable number of them have been silly
ones almost without any meaning in being almost not being
themselves inside them to my feeling, being such very silly ones as
to me almost not to be existing, being like funny things in
dreaming and now they are to me connected with some who I am really
understanding then having flavor of something as being a complete
thing to them. How can there be existing a flavor when there is
nothing to have the flavor, that is foolishness in talking, there
are many who are often all their living thinking they are being
this thing. These are a kind of them, I will tell about them. Now I
am thinking of some who are not to themselves existing in a flavor
they are not to themselves existing in a way as something they are
realising, they have been to me very often so disconcerting, they
were silly ones to my feeling, they are not silly ones to most
every one knowing them, I am seeing a little now perhaps that they
are existing.</p>

<p>These then I am describing, I will keep only those just now in
my feeling those having in them one kind of being not a mixture in
them. I was describing the being in Alfred Hersland that made of
him to me to very many knowing him a part of a being. He has in him
only one kind of being but as I was telling pieces of it get
separated off from other pieces of it by not being completely
acting, flavors, reactions, by-products get disconnected and
keeping on going in him and things get all disarranged in him so
that this one is a part of a one in living, the bottom in him
resisting and engulfing is not rich or thick or solid or ample or
active enough in acting to make a complete being in my feeling in
him, and always then that is there as being in him. These that to
me in their living were silly ones not having any existing not from
doing silly things but from there not being any connection between
what they were seeing and doing and feeling and saying and always
it all went on at once and kept on being all the being in them;
these then are like this to me now, they are in a way of the flavor
group which group as I was saying have it in them to be believing
that flavor is existing without anything to be making a flavor
without anything being a flavored thing. These then that I am now
describing who were vague and silly ones often to my feeling
pleasant ones often to my feeling, astonishing often to my feeling,
disconcerting often to my feeling, these then live but they do not
make themselves important to themselves in it. Those ones I have
been understanding were to themselves important in the flavor
living they were feeling in them and these then I came to
understand by realising the bottom being in each one of them and
sometime I will be giving a very interesting description of many
kinds of these kinds of them who are to themselves living a flavor
life in living, are to themselves only a flavor in their being, I
have an interesting collection of these kinds of them and the being
in them and passion and affection in them and the kind of flavor
they are to themselves in themselves and the kind of flavor they
are to every one to some one knowing them but all that very
interesting collection I know in my living I will not be just now
describing, very likely I will not describe them for some time yet
as I am liking to think of describing them. These then these others
I have commenced now describing are in a way connected with these
these I have commenced now describing who are so vague and
disconnected and puzzling and are saying and feeling and doing and
seeing all at once and there is not any connection any one can be
seeing and it is not in them as it is in some that bottom being in
them is so slow in acting that other things in them are making
confusion and bottom being never arrives in them to be doing
anything, no these are different from these, everything in these is
going at the same rate in them only the action is so vaguely in
them that things in them do not keep in connection and these then
are not to themselves inside them in the way of making themselves
to themselves inside them to be themselves in them. These then live
in a life but they do not make themselves important to themselves
in it. One is at bottom a fairly dull not too stupid, fairly
solemn, unthinking, believing, lethargic, not completely
non-poignant resisting person, and this one is actively living
doing all little things stubbornly because it is pleasant tasting
and lively doing pleasant living in a vigorous interesting fairly
delicately sensitive constant state of appreciation. The other one
the woman is a practical, anarchistic, attacking, servant girl
person not feeling any difference between being a dirty one or a
clean one having ugly things or nice ones in anything near this
one, having a need for seizing everything to use in a servant girl
fashion and always this one is living a life of independently
loving beauty in living having justness in appreciation and needing
a delicate flavor in loving and not keep anything that does not
want to be kept by this one. These two then to themselves are not
really important inside them from either being in them, they are
really actively living what I am calling the flavor living and
passively living the other living. Olga who was Ida whom Alfred
Hersland and Arragon knew once as I was saying is in a way like
these only living in her is a very much more exciting occupation to
herself and to a good many a little knowing her in her living. She
was a stupid resisting, stagnant, dull fairly sensible one in
bottom being and this being was so stagnant in her it is very hard
ever to be really certain whether she was of the resisting or
attacking kind of them but really she was of the resisting kind of
them. This being as I am saying was stagnant being in her and as
vapor there was in her a nervous almost crazy kind of asking every
one to be a lover to her and this was in her and she was a
substantially pretty good-hearted honest round one and so not any
one can understand that there is never any history in any man ever
knowing her when she is always so constantly asking every one to
them to be a lover and to keep on making love to her and she was
always then going on with them. This was living in her, this was
being in her. To herself she was not living really in either way of
her living, she was really living both of them and to herself
inside her she was never certain that she was living in either one
of them, in the two of them. The one she is actively living the
nervous sexual asking to be object of all loving, the other one she
is passively living. This then is the being and the living in Ida
and so then there was not any history in the knowing of her in Mr.
Arragon, in Alfred Hersland. A good many who were young laughed a
good deal about her, many did not believe that any one could ever
think they could want to have her and really there was never any
history in any one's knowing her really, and she was a little
confusing to herself sometimes then and very much a puzzle to very
many others then. This is all I know now about her.</p>

<p>This then is certain that not any one really was very important
in the living of Alfred Hersland in his young living. As I was
saying he knew a good many then, he was doing with them what he was
doing then in his living, he knew a good many then and he was doing
in his living with them what they were doing in their living then.
I have described some of them. As I was saying the family of
Madeleine Wyman were sometimes trying to be pleasant with him. The
mother Mrs. Wyman could flatter him but she did not really flatter
him and that was not an unpleasant thing to his feeling but he did
not for that want to see her again. Sometimes he was quite a little
with Madeleine Wyman's brother and her younger sister but not
enough to be different really in him from knowing any other one in
his living. The older Wyman daughter could be pleasant to him by
taking an interest in him but that was only in him as making a
little less flattering what her mother had left on him. Really
there is not any use now remembering more about them for him. This
was all young living in Alfred Hersland this I have been
describing. There was more young living, of course there was a good
deal more young living in him. There was young living in him, there
was his being inside him, he lived the living of those he was then
knowing and soon then he went to Bridgepoint to begin his middle
living. He went there and then he came to making a living and to
marrying Julia Dehning and to knowing a fair number of men and
women.</p>

<p>The Hissen relatives were glad to see him, it was very pleasant
for them to see one of their sister's children, and to know really
that the Gossols living was existing, really existing. They were
pleasant cheerful quickly curious and always a little doubting and
it was pleasant for them to see Alfred and to feel him and to ask
him how his mother was and to hear him and to see that though he
was a fairly tall one he looked a little like them and was very
pleasant in liking them. The Hersland relatives too saw him and for
a while he lived with his aunt and she was interested in him but it
was not such a pleasant thing in her and at first he was very much
with the Hissen men and women and he was a little tender with them.
He liked being in Bridgepoint and he began studying and he played
the violin a good deal then and he was with his relatives a good
deal then and he began to know then some who knew them and others
then and he was very nice then and he had a pleasant feeling of
living in him then. It was very pleasant being in this Bridgepoint
living, it was very pleasant to him to be seeing, as it is to
Gossols' children, many relatives who knew him and had seen him
when he was a baby and were thinking then in seeing him of his
father and his mother and he was in them the only one, and it was
very pleasant for him as it is for Gossols' children to hear the
thunder cracking and the lightning shooting and the leaves piling
up and then snow coming looking white and then dirty when he was
looking up to see it falling and then it was pleasant for him to
see skating and then to see a green spring beginning, it was a
pleasant thing like it is to some to hear a cuckoo sounding and to
be slowly convinced by some one that it is not a clock but a live
bird calling. It is a pleasant thing to come somewhere and be
having such a thing happen a very pleasant thing. Alfred had a
pleasant feeling and with the Hissen men and women quite a pleasant
tender feeling in him in his living and to them all then he was a
pleasant one quite a very pleasant one and to himself inside him
then he was pleasantly being with every one. He had in him then the
feeling Hissen people naturally have in them and he was to them too
then a tall one and coming from Gossols and being of them and it
was pleasant and they were curious and they stayed around him and
were touching him then to really feel him and he was of them and he
was pleasant inside him and he was a little tall for them and he
and they liked him and he was living with a Hersland aunt then and
this was the beginning of Bridgepoint living in him. This was
pleasant feeling in living that Alfred had then. This can come to
those living in Gossols and knowing some and being happy enough in
living and enjoying doing things and then such a one coming to many
with a pleasant feeling of every one knowing every one and every
one knowing that one and every one a little curious and remembering
and touching that one to be interested in remembering and at the
same time feeling that that one is a tall one, this is very
pleasant to some who have been all their living living in Gossols,
not at all pleasant to some who have not been living in Gossols,
not at all pleasant to some who have been living all their living
in Gossols, it was very pleasant feeling in Alfred as I have been
saying.</p>

<p>This is a comforting thing in being a great author inside one
that always even with much lonely feeling and much sighing in one
and even with not pleasantness inside any one just then when it is
a very sombre burden then that one is beginning having coming
saying that pleasant living is a pleasant thing and to be
explaining how some are liking pleasant living. Not every one is
liking pleasant living. Alfred as I was saying when he first came
to Bridgepoint living was liking it very much that he was then in
pleasant living and then he was a little being in love and that was
then almost still pleasant living even though the Hersland aunt
with whom he was living was trying to be interfering and was just a
little breaking into for him the pleasantness of pleasant living he
was having then. The Hissens were a little interfering then, were
sometimes having hurt or angry feeling, but that was for him then
not a part of not pleasant living. Certainly for quite some time
Bridgepoint living was for him pleasant living. He had some loving
in him then, he had some tender feeling in him then, he was liking
music very well then, he had pleasant living in him then, he had
aspiring in him then but it was not yet then come to be in him as
something that was to be an active thing in him to make living for
him in him. It was quite sometime later then that he met. Julia
Dehning.</p>

<p>Alfred of course in his feeling loving was feeling it
differently in him at Bridgepoint than he had felt loving when he
was in Gossols. Mostly until he met Julia Dehning he was not very
seriously feeling loving, that was really true though of him, in
Bridgepoint before he met Julia Dehning, the second year that he
was living in Bridgepoint and studying he was really feeling loving
in him, he wanted then to quit studying and earn a living in a
business so that he could then soon be marrying and this was very
troublesome then to his Hersland aunt with whom he was then staying
who was not willing that he should be loving then to marrying and
then Alfred's mother came to see him and she was supposed to stop
him from marrying but really she was ready to let him and was ready
to give presents to all of them and then it was over in him because
the girl then was gone to another city and was writing then to him.
One of the Hissens aunts, one who was married to a gentle Hissen
man made fun of the girl then to Alfred and did it very often and
did it very well then and did it with letters he showed her that
the girl wrote to him and then his mother who had been a princess
to the rest of the Hissen men and women, so she must be to them
being herself to herself inside her then and having been living in
Gossols to them, went home then and all the Hissens then helped
Alfred to not want then to be marrying although then he was not
being so much with them, he was not any longer then feeling full up
in him with the pleasant living they had in them, he had not then
any longer in him tender feeling pleasantly in him. He always liked
them well enough all his living but they were not then at all
filling him full up with pleasant feeling. He went on studying
then, he came then to know more and more men and more and more
women and three years later and then already perhaps his father was
beginning the losing his great fortune and his mother was beginning
completely weakening and Martha was beginning to have her trouble
seriously in living and David his brother was coming to Bridgepoint
too to do more studying, these things in the living in Gossols
were, not then really important in Alfred Hersland when he was
coming then to know Julia Dehning, Gossols living was inside him
then pretty completely not any more in him, Hissen living was not
then any more in him, he always had his own being in him he had now
pretty completely his own living in him in a way now a little he
was not quite doing in his living what every one near him was
doing, he was not doing then in his living, whatever he was doing
with them. This then is really completely then beginning of middle
living in Alfred Hersland and this is to be now more regular
history of him. There will soon be ever so much description of
being in Julia Dehning and in every Dehning and now a little I will
be telling a little more of beginning middle living in Alfred
Hersland in his first beginning Bridgepoint living.</p>

<p>He knew a number then in these days of his early Bridgepoint
living but mostly not any of them were later in his living, those
who were later in his living were some that I will be later
describing. In the beginning living he was interesting to some as
realising musical meaning, and mostly then he was pleasantly young
and quite tall and always giving romantically scientifically
restrained superior information and playing the violin not very
well but always able then to be directing the one playing with him.
There were then women and men who liked him, not enough to make it
very different in him from those he had been loving in his early
living, but he was a little older now and soon he was quite a good
deal older and he had been really loving then and he had been
assisted in not loving by his aunt Hilda Hissen who did this very
nicely for him to herself then and to him and he was ready then
soon to be one who was one to be impressive to Julia Dehning as I
was very long ago saying. This then was the beginning of middle
living in Alfred Hersland. David Hersland his brother came to
Bridgepoint then, he found some letters that Alfred had forgotten
that the girl had written to him and David made fun of Alfred then
and soon then Alfred was loving Julia Dehning and this was to David
as to Alfred too a serious thing this living and then this marrying
by Alfred of Julia Dehning. This was then the complete beginning of
middle living in Alfred Hersland.</p>

<p>I wish every one knew every one and liked having me telling them
about the being that each one has in them about the kind of one
each one is of men and women. It would be a very complete thing in
my feeling to be having complete lists of every body ever living
and to be realising each one and to be making diagrams of them and
lists of them and explaining the being in each one and the relation
of that being to other beings in other men and other women and to
go on then explaining and realising and knowing the complete being
in each one and all the kinds there are in men and women. Not many
find it interesting this way I am realising every one, not any I am
just now hearing, and it is so completely an important thing, it is
a complete thing in understanding, I am going on writing, I am
going on now with a description of all whom Alfred Hersland came to
know in his living. Mostly no one will be wanting to listen. I am
certain. I am important inside me and not any one really is
listening to me. I am wishing every one knew every one and wanted
to have me make diagrams of all the kinds there are of men and
women and the place in this diagram of each one. It would be very
contenting to me and I am now not beginning again but going on with
my explaining and describing and realising and knowing and being
certain.</p>

<p>I see so many who I am very certain will not be at all
interested in my being certain that each one is himself inside him,
that each one is of a kind in men and women, that I can make a
diagram now including a very considerable number of kinds in men
and women and that sometime I will be able to explain the being in
each one and make a scheme of relations in kinds of being with each
one having in them the way of eating, thinking, feeling, working,
drinking, loving, beginning and ending, feeling things as being
existing of their kind of being, with sensitivenesses and
suddenesses and impatient and patient and dependent and independent
being of their kind of them and succeeding and failing of their
kind of them and I will be able to make groups of them and it will
be such an interesting and such an important thing in my feeling,
in my being, and I will be making groups of them of each kind of
them with some of each kind of them succeeding some failing some in
between succeeding and failing, some having more of something of
their kind of them in them than other things of their kind of them
and each one then I am ever knowing comes sometime then to be such
a clear one to my feeling and I could want to have every one know
every one so that each one could see the meaning of my explanation
and always I am certain that so very many I am always knowing are
not wanting to completely listen to me in my explaining and many
are not understanding that they must be hearing me completely and
they are not doing this thing and here I am and I am certain, at
least I am mostly always certain and yet always I am of the
dependent independent kind of them and always in me there is quite
a good deal always of dependent despairing and always I am knowing
and always I will be knowing always now I am certain that mostly
those I am knowing do not want, cannot be completely listening and
it is such a complete being in me and I am important that is
certain and here I am full up now with knowing that mostly those to
whom I am explaining are not completely hearing. Alfred Hersland
was in Bridgepoint doing in the beginning very pleasant living. He
was not remembering then very much of his Gossols living, and then
he was not remembering very much his pleasant tender feeling in the
pleasant living he had in him with the Hissen men and women and
young men and women and the young men and women that knew the young
Hissen men and women. He always had a little remembering in him of
wanting to be marrying the one he did not marry then and always he
remembered his aunt the aunt who had married a Hissen man, who had
slowly shown him that this one whom he wanted then to be marrying
was not one to have him. He remembered this very well, he did not
remember much about the Hersland aunt who interfered with him.
Alfred Hersland was a little not very good at remembering but he
remembered more or less about wanting to have married one then
although he never later wanted that, he had married this one. He
did want for quite some time very completely certainly to marry
this one and this one certainly then wanted to be married to him
but he did not marry this one.</p>

<p>When Alfred Hersland came first to know Julia Dehning he was not
remembering any longer very much in him any of the early
Bridgepoint living that he had had in him. He was remembering as I
was saying sometimes then that he had really wanted to marry one
and he remembered then that he had been living in Gossols when he
had been a very young one. This was mostly all his remembering
then. He was then not really knowing any he had been knowing when
he was beginning Bridgepoint living. His Hersland aunt was then
connected with him. She knew Mrs. Dehning. The Hissens were not
then connected in him with him, not that he had ever had any
quarrel with them but always in living in mostly every one there is
a keeping going that keeps making different ones come to be
connected in them with them and now then as I was saying Alfred
Hersland was coming to know Julia Dehning. As I was saying there
was not then in him really any family Gossols living, really not
any Hissen Bridgepoint living. The loving that I said he had in him
when he wanted to be marrying and earning a living in some business
so he could be married without waiting that lasted about two years
before it was completely ended in him and then there was about a
year and a half in him and then he came to know Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>There are then resisting and attacking kinds in men and women.
Alfred Hersland is of the resisting kind of them, Julia Dehning of
the attacking kind of them. The resisting kind as I have been
saying and having not been yet complete in telling, the resisting
kind of them are naturally and ultimately completely certain that
things have really ordinarily materially existing being, they are
existing, they are in relation, they have quality as beauty and
smells and use and perhaps purpose and perhaps many other kinds of
meaning but always then for the resisting kind of them they are
really existing, having existing like any dirt in any field or in
any road or any place or any garden. These then are of the
resisting kind of them and these then have the ways of thinking and
feeling eating, drinking and loving and curiosity and obstinacy and
beginning and ending and being dead and being living and working
and resting and hoping and not hoping for anything in a way
characteristic of this resisting kind of them. Now this is
certainly true of them and at the same time what with engulfing
being in them and misplaced parts in them and attenuation in them
and delicacy in them in being so that they are reversing and
dependent timid being in them and aspiring being in them, the being
in them gets so complicated in them sometimes too when they have
dramatic being in them and aggressive selfdefensive being in them,
all this can so confuse kind of being in them that even when they
have not any attacking being in them as a good many have it in them
it is very perplexing even to me when I have been looking such a
very long time at one of them. For instance there are a kind of
them that are really completely certain that to be dead is not to
be really a dead one, that nothing is really existing, these are
certain that nothing is existing except everything, they are
completely certain that everything is existing, they are of the
resisting kind of them they must be certain that things are
existing, and they make everything existing and so lose out of
existing anything. They lose themselves and everything in being
certain that everything is really existing completely simply
existing, that is resisting being haying mysticism, this is quite
common. This is a very complete religious kind of being and these
are of the resisting kind of them. I am just mentioning this thing
to show that resisting being can be very confusing to be
understanding.</p>

<p>Those having in them attacking being the attacking kind of them
can have mysticism in them that is very certain. Sometime I will
tell all I ever can know about these things. Those having attacking
being as mysticism lose themselves in attacking complete emotion,
anybody can see how different this is from the way resisting kind
of them have mysticism in them. The attacking kind in men and women
feel and need and see and use relations between things as coming to
them as ultimately realisation more completely even than things
being existing. These then can have as I am fond of saying but am
now a little tired of repeating emotion having poignancy like a
sensation. This is the characteristic then of attacking being, that
being in relation is more completely to them of things than things
being existing. This makes them attacking as anybody can see by
understanding. This is attacking being then. Julia Dehning was of
the attacking kind in men and women. This is now to be a history of
Julia Dehning and those Julia knew in living and of her marrying
Alfred Hersland and of every thing.<br>

<h2>7.</h2>

<p>Some have very pleasant living when they are very young men and
women, some have anything but pleasant living in them then. Very
many have quite pleasant living in them then and when they are
writing it then in diaries and letters to themselves and others
there is not very much pleasant living in them then. It is a pretty
difficult thing to be remembering, in a way ever to be certain
about whether one is having, has been having pleasant living. It is
quite a difficult thing to know it in them to know it of them quite
young men and quite young women whether they are whether they were
having pleasant living A very considerable number of very young men
and women are not having very pleasant living in them. It is very
difficult to know it inside in one in remembering or in living
whether one is having then pleasant living. Pleasant living is a
very difficult thing about which to be certain. A great many are
thinking that mostly every one is having pleasant enough living, a
great many are thinking that not any one is really having pleasant
living, a great many are thinking that some are having pleasant
living. A good many are thinking every one should have pleasant
living in them. A certain number are thinking every one could have
pleasant living in them, I find it quite puzzling to be certain
about any one whether they are having pleasant living in them. As I
was saying Alfred Hersland in his early Bridgepoint living had
quite completely pleasant living. I am almost certain. Later then
living was exciting and interesting and gay and varied and
absorbing and perplexing and sometimes disconcerting and sometimes
uneasy in him but it was never again I am thinking quite so
pleasant in him. Perhaps it was pleasant in him in his later
living, it is very hard to be certain about any one about pleasant
living in them, a very difficult thing indeed to be certain about
this in any one at any time in the living any one has in them.
Certainly his early Bridgepoint living was pleasant in him. This is
quite reasonably certain. Later he was not remembering this early
pleasant Bridgepoint living. It was not important in him. Really
nothing was important in him until his first loving. He had always
had his own being in him, that in a way was important inside him,
not anything was really important to him until he wanted to stop
studying to be marrying. It was his wanting to stop studying to be
marrying and his then slowly not wanting that this one should have
him that was important to him. He soon was forgetting his loving
this one, he never was really forgetting having been wanting
stopping studying and beginning working at anything so that he
could be married then. He never really forgot stopping wanting to
be married to this one. Not that that was really very exciting but
it was important to him, more important than anything that he ever
had had in his living. Later then he was older and was beginning to
know Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>He always had his own being in him, he was always himself inside
him. This always was in him. Sometimes he was himself to himself
inside him, sometimes he was not so much himself to himself inside
him. Mostly everything any one says about any one, that one says
about that one in a way is a true thing.</p>

<p>He always was himself inside him. He was not ever really knowing
what could and what could not come out of him. Very many are not
ever really knowing what will and what will not come out of them.
Each one is himself inside him, is herself inside her that is
certain. Very many are not knowing what is in them to really come
out of them. Very many are not ever coming to know of them what is
in them to come out of them, many who in a way do know something of
the being that is them. This is a peculiar thing. Watching
carefully repeating in each one, one can come then to know of each
one what is in them each one to come out of them, many men can be
certain of themselves that something else will not then come out of
them, some one else can be certain about them that not any really
different thing, different way of doing anything will come out of
them, these can not ever come to be really realising of themselves
inside them that something more completely so that it is different
will not be coming out of them. This is very common.</p>

<p>He was himself inside him, of course he was, all his living.
Always he was not realising that not any really different thing
could come out from him. You see one has to be very careful about
being certain what is being in any one. A great many are certain
about what is being in some one and although they may not be
altogether wrong about that one they mostly always are not
realising all the being coming out of each one. You have certainly
to be very fond of waiting, very fond of realising each repeating,
very fond of understanding each one is always really repeating,
very fond of waiting to be hearing, seeing, feeling a great deal of
repeating out of each one to be at all ready to be realising the
complete being in each one, to be realising what will not be coming
out of some one. Mostly each one is repeating but mostly each one
is not realising their own thing as repeating in them. It is a
queer thing to me who am really entirely loving repeating that
mostly not any one is seeing feeling hearing themselves as doing
repeating. Perhaps it would not be pleasant to most of them, indeed
very many of them are quite certain they do not at all love
repeating. So then a very great many never can come to be realising
what can and what really cannot come out of them. As I am saying
one must be very fond indeed of waiting, of hearing, seeing,
feeling repeating to be really certain about any one what can and
what can really not come out of them. Sometimes one can be fairly
quickly certain about some one and sometimes it takes quite a
considerable time to be really certain but always it is quite well
to be waiting a considerable time to be really certain from
realising the repeating coming out of some one, what can and what
cannot come out of that one. As I am saying very many a very great
many are always beginning having a completely new thing coming out
of them to themselves inside them or waiting to have something
coming so completely out of them that it is really in that quality
of being a complete thing to be a new thing to be coming out of
them, and this is very common. It is really extraordinary that all
the repeating coming out of them all their living is not
discouraging but then mostly not any one is really loving being
repeating and so each one can never be really certain about what
can and what really cannot come out of them. Each one has their own
being in them, each one is of a kind in men and women. Alfred
Hersland as I am saying had his own being in him, he was not to
himself all his living repeating, that is not quite true of him, he
was to himself a good deal repeating all his living, mostly every
one are to themselves a good deal repeating all their living but
not really completely repeating, not repeating so that they can
sometime quite soon even be considerably certain what can and what
cannot really come out of them. Some are quite certain, quite a
number are quite certain, a very great number are never really
inside them certain. And mostly not any of them are to themselves
all their living always repeating, some are of course to themselves
all their living repeating, but mostly not very many are to
themselves loving repeating of themselves all their living. So then
very many are living, very many are aspiring, very many are
arranging, very many are telling the being to be coming out of them
in their living that can never be coming out of them and I am not
now telling about young ones or about those who are failing in
living, I am telling now about a great many who are living. Being
always repeating the whole being all of one's living is such a
lovely thing to my feeling. Mostly every one is saying they do not
love repeating. I am realising the being in very many men and
women, I am realising what can and what cannot come out of them
each one and always I am loving all repeating, repeating all the
being in each one over and over again is such a lovely thing for me
to be realising. And yet mostly every one is telling that they do
not love repeating, they do not think it at all a lovely thing,
they are not repeating their whole being always all the time in
living, something will soon be coming out of them to show every one
what more being there is in them. And here I am almost all alone in
really completely loving repeating, loving it that each one all his
living is repeating all his being. I am now completely realising
all the being Alfred had in him, I will now tell how in repeating
it all came out of him. And always too now I will be beginning
describing Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>Every one is always knowing the reason why they themselves are
failing in succeeding. Each one is knowing certainly each time why
he is not succeeding in living. Each one is always knowing why she
is succeeding in failing. Mostly not any one has much of such a
feeling about other ones why they are failing to be succeeding.
Always each one is repeating in telling each time the reason for
not then succeeding. Mostly as one gets used to hearing it from any
one they get a little tired of that one. Each one then has their
own steady complete reason for each time of not succeeding. Very
many as I was saying are not learning about themselves in living.
They are not learning about themselves from themselves in their
living. The reason for not succeeding comes out each time freshly
from them; to very many then that one is always going on repeating;
that one then is always making a bright finding a discovering of
the reason that one is not that time succeeding, that one is always
fresh in discovering what is to every other one then an inevitable
repeating not having really any meaning. It is a thing a great many
are not doing, learning about themselves from themselves in their
living. It is very satisfying to very many who are living who were
living who will be living that there are reasons always then
explaining each failing in succeeding. As I was saying Mr.
Hersland's children told it to him later when they were a little
tired of the impatient being always in him and when they were then
not any longer at all afraid of his doing anything to scare them.
He did not then really hear them, he was always fresh then as he
always had been in discovering a reason for each failing of
succeeding. Mostly of every one each one finds it of them that they
are repeating discovering a reason for each failing. To themselves
each one it is a specific thing each reason each time of failing to
be succeeding, to mostly every other one sometime the reason each
one is giving for each time of failing is repeating a completely
feeble one. As I was saying there are quite a number always living,
quite a majority in men and women who are not learning themselves
in failing, from themselves in their living. I am now realising
Alfred Hersland to himself inside him. Alfred Hersland in a way was
not failing in his living in a way was not succeeding in his
living. Alfred Hersland was not really learning anything from his
being in his living but then really that was not an important
matter in him, Alfred Hersland was not really a learning kind in
living. He learned something that is certain, mostly he was
aspiring in living, mostly he was not succeeding, mostly he was not
failing in living. Repeating and repeating and repeating and
beginning and ending and being a young one and then an older one
and then an old one and then not any longer one one; I am sometimes
inside and sometimes including this realising. The relation of
content and reflection, the relation of being and living, the
relation of learning and stupid being, this is in me in my feeling,
certainly in me now and I will be now doing expecting.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland married Julia Dehning. They were not successful
together in their married living, this is to be now a complete
history of them and of every one connected with either of them.
Very many have it in them that they are throwing always off from
them the little too much they are always having of everything. Some
are not having really too much of anything, of everything, some are
forgetting whether they have been having too much or not enough of
everything in getting another thing, some are responding with
complete excitement to each thing, some have enough excitement in
them to be responding to that thing and being in a state of having
excitement in another thing, some have it that they are always
aspiring to be completely full up with a thing. Alfred Hersland had
one way of being in him, Julia Dehning had her way of being. Alfred
Hersland had aspiring in him to be completely full up with
something. Julia Dehning had very much excitement in being
interested in each thing and continuing and being interested in
some more thing. Julia Dehning had very much excitement in being an
interested one. They both of them were not failing in a way in the
whole of their living each one, they not either of them were really
succeeding in their being either of them. This is now to be a
history of each of them and of every one.</p>

<p>Loving is a thing a great many are doing. Marrying is a thing a
great many are doing. There are very many degrees of having loving
in men and women. Loving is a thing each one is sometime doing in a
way natural to them to be doing. Just at first I am thinking about
six or seven who are doing loving. Alfred Hersland and Julia
Dehning were doing loving and were marrying. I could give
descriptions of lists of men and women who are sometime doing
loving. I have just been explaining to one how one I am knowing
just now is doing loving. I am feeling very much just now how two I
am knowing are feeling in being loving. I am letting myself go into
Alfred Hersland and Julia Dehning and the loving being they had in
them when they came to be thinking of marrying. I will tell now a
little about loving.</p>

<p>It is a simple thing for very many men and women for some of
their living, for very many men and women for a good part of their
living, for a good many men and women for all their living to be
believing, to be certain that each one is really a quite nice one,
every one is a nice one. This is really very very common. In a way
it is a natural way of feeling for after all for very many women
and for very many men it is not a reasonable thing that any one
they can come to be knowing could be not a nice one. It is such a
very simple thing really to be certain that each one in a way is a
nice one, perhaps one can be certain of a way of loving that one
has that is not a nice way of having loving and yet really one can
not be really believing it in the way of knowing that that one is
not a nice one. Yes it is true the way of loving in that one is not
a nice one but then that one is a nice one and any one having that
way of loving is not a nice one and very many are then completely
content in them that all this is a true thing, that that way of
loving is one making that one not a nice one, that that one is a
nice one, that that one has the way of loving that not any nice one
can have in them and very many find it inside them completely
satisfying to be completely certain of these three things being all
true of some one they are knowing. This is quite simply common. I
have been hearing some one saying this again and again and I have
been explaining the kind of loving being the one had in her that
made that one not a nice one and it all is completely satisfying.
And it is quite an easy natural way of feeling in very many women
in very many men this way of feeling about men and women. Some men
and Some women have very much suspicion in them about mostly every
one and these can have in them do have in them these simple ways of
being certain of niceness and not niceness and not possibly
niceness and quite niceness all in one. There are some who are
really completely certain that each one is a nice one, sometimes
such a one is really certain that some are really not at all nice
ones and some then have confusion in them for they can never come
to be really understanding how any one can come to be really not a
nice one. Thinking every one really quite a nice one is really
quite common. This is a very important thing in a way in having
loving feeling and now I will be describing a little some loving
feeling some I have been just knowing have in them. I will be
describing just now some loving so as to be realising the relation
of feeling each one, some one, a nice one to feeling loving for
each one, for some one. This will bring me on then to describing
Alfred Hersland Julia Dehning loving and marrying.</p>

<p>There is one that is certainly a nice one. This one is certainly
a very nice one. I am knowing this one. I have been explaining this
one to some one who was and is and will be certain that this one is
a nice one and is certain that this one has a way of loving that is
not a way a nice one could have loving in them. This one then is
really seriously a nice one. This one is certainly a nice one. This
one has a way of loving that not any nice one could have in them.
This one is certainly a very completely nice one.</p>

<p>Mostly those who are complete ones in living have it in them
that content is at least as full as thinking, realising,
questioning, loving, dreaming, talking, aspiration, beginning,
ending, quite completely as full in them and very many have it that
this is not true of them and those these then are sentimental or
virtuous or finicky or enthusiastic or aspiring and reflective or
temperamental or eager or sudden or intelligent or a number of
these things in living. This is very common as every one knows of
very many women and men. Alfred Hersland was aspiring in living.
The thing in one that may come and may not come to be loving
feeling in that one is sometimes concentrated, sometimes very
diffused in them, sometimes in lumps in them and sometimes in
different ways in them. Sometime I will be describing pretty
completely ways of loving, ways of liking oneself and other ones,
ways of eating, ways of drinking, the liking some kinds of eating
and not other kinds of eating, liking or not liking drinking, being
wearied or not wearied with liking anything in all the kinds I can
come to know of men and women. Always ways of eating, and things to
eat different ones are liking are to me quite concentratedly
exciting. Now then I am describing a little and pretty feebly in a
good deal of confusion a little about ways of having loving
feeling. As I was saying the one I am now describing had not had
loving to come out of this one as really feeling wanting to be
loving. This one as I was saying was a nice one. I know now a fair
amount about feeling loving, quite a good deal now, of that some
are now quite certain. I will tell now a little more about one.
This one as I was saying was quite well known for being a very nice
one, a very nice one in dressing, in getting ready every day for
living, in being an engaged one who was not yet a married one. This
one then was quite known by being a very nice one, a quite
delicately nice one. This one as I was saying was seeing everything
not nice ones were doing when she was walking or travelling. She
was a little vacant in a way, this one. She had as I was saying
being that was made up by adding little pellets together which were
never mingling. Each little pellet had part of seeing everything
not nice ones were doing. Being made up of little pellets made this
one a delicately nice one, an engaged one who was not a married
one. When this one made jokes about loving, about not being a nice
one and this one did this quite often, it was done with that part
of each pellet that was always seeing whenever this one was
travelling or walking what not nice ones were doing. This one as I
was saying was really quite certainty a recognised delicately nice
one. This one was certainly convincingly a quite completely
delicately nice one.</p>

<p>Loving being, I am filled just now quite full of loving being in
myself and in a number of men and women. Loving is to me just now
an interesting, a delightful a quite completely realised thing. I
have loving being in me more than I knew I could have in me. It was
a surprising thing to find it so completely in me. I am realising
loving being in quite a number now of men and women, completely
realising for them, completely realising in them loving being. I am
loving just now beautiful loving, I am loving nice loving, I am
loving just now every kind of loving. I am realising just now very
much and quite some kinds of loving. I am thinking now that it is a
difficult thing to be knowing without very careful waiting and then
a little more waiting besides the waiting that was pretty nearly
enough waiting how much any one is, what kind there is in any one
of loving. A very great many have very many prejudices concerning
loving, more perhaps even than about drinking and eating. This is
very common. Not very many are very well pleased with other
people's ways in having loving in them. Some are very much pleased
with some ways of having loving and not with other ways of having
loving. Some are wanting people to be very nice in having loving
being in them. Some are pretty well ready to let most people do the
kind of loving they have naturally in them but are not ready to let
all people do the loving the way loving naturally comes to be in
them. A very considerable number of men and women have different
ways of having loving in them. I have different ways of having
loving feeling in me I am certain; I am loving just now very much
all loving. I am realising just now with lightness and delight and
conviction and acquiescing and curious feeling all the ways anybody
can be having loving feeling. I have always all along been telling
a little about ways of loving in different kinds in men and women.
I will tell now a little more about specific loving in some
specific men and women.</p>

<p>Some are never really knowing how much or how little they can be
loving. Some are never really knowing how much they are loving.
They are looking at some one they are loving and they are thinking
they are not really completely loving they could very easily be
forgetting the one they are loving, and then they are completely
full up then with loving, and they never at any time can be
realising that really they are loving more or may be less than they
are thinking they are loving. I can understand this thing, I cannot
really ever be really realising that I can really be having really
loving feeling. This is perhaps more common in the resisting than
in the attacking kind in men, at least it would be a very natural
thing if it were a common thing with those having resisting being
as their way of having loving feeling. There are then kinds in men
and women and each kind has a way of loving that in a way is common
to each one of that kind of them. As I was saying, now as I am
saying some know very well the complete feeling of being a loving
one inside them. It is a very wonderful thing when one is not
certain with loving to be seeing some one completely certain in
having completely quivering, complete loving feeling, to be all
loving and certain that they are really all loving. There are then
attacking and resisting kind in men and women. There are sensitive
attacking, and trembling attacking, and quivering attacking, and
obstinate attacking, and rushing attacking, and piercing attacking,
and cowardly attacking, and withdrawing attacking, and steady
attacking, and enthusiastic attacking, and mystic attacking that is
attacking to lose itself in complete emotion, and narrow attacking
that is destroying everything that is not to be there as an object
to be attacked to exaltation, and ambitious attacking, and sullen
attacking, and quick attacking, and planned attacking, and
necessary attacking, and sudden and intermittent attacking, and
confused attacking, and dutiful attacking, and troubled attacking,
and slow attacking, and stupid attacking, and wobbling attacking
and then there are engulfing resisting and simple resisting and
vacant resisting and surface resisting and yielding resisting and
stubborn resisting and solemn resisting and earnest resisting and
seductive resisting and fiery resisting and intermittent resisting
and attacking resisting, and confused resisting and dulled
resisting, and emphatic resisting and sympathetic resisting, and
fearful resisting, and very timid resisting and trickly resisting
and suspicious resisting, and embracing resisting and in short
there are very many kinds of ways of having loving feeling in men
and in women. As I was saying some are not ever really certain they
are really loving and they are looking at one they are loving and
they are thinking they could easily be forgetting that one any one
they are loving, that not any one is really loved by them, that
they are really not having loving feeling that is real ever in them
and such then are wondering, and adoring one really having certain
loving feeling. It is a very wonderful thing to such a one, one not
being certain that some one can have complete energy complete
certainty in loving, that some one can have emotion to have
poignancy like a sensation. Such a one, one never really believing
that the feeling in them is really loving feeling can perhaps come
to believe it of themselves by experiencing that always they are
spontaneously acting as if they were completely loving, and
repeating in them of such action sometimes does convince such a
one. They know they are loving because they are doing what some one
who is loving would naturally be doing and this gradually brings
conviction to them. Some turn it then into a sentimental feeling so
as not to lose it out of them, a few keep it as really needing to
be constantly repeating to keep them in their conviction. This then
has been a description of some loving.</p>

<p>As I was saying a great many have prejudices about people being
loving. Some say alright all but one way of loving, another says
alright all but another way of loving, some say not very many kinds
of loving are right loving, some say all ways of loving are really
ways of having loving feeling. I like loving. I like mostly all the
ways any one can have of having loving feeling in them. Slowly it
has come to be in me that any way of being a loving one is
interesting and not unpleasant to me. That came very slowly to be
in me. I like loving then as I am saying. I will tell now then a
little more about loving in women and in men.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is very puzzling that so many are certain that they
are really loving some one. Sometimes I am wondering about how they
can be so very certain. And then they have so many ways of thinking
out the loving in them. And then they have ways of beginning loving
and ways of ending loving very many men and very many women and
ways of marrying and not marrying that certainly are puzzling and
believing that they can and cannot bear to be loving and not
living, they can and cannot be learning loving, and ways of being
brave and being cowardly with loving and with those that they are
loving that are very complicating. Sometimes some one who is always
ready to be fighting and ready to kill and be killed by any one
when he thinks it right for him to be an angry one sometimes then
such a one being really wanting to be completely dominating in
loving, being an attacking one gets frightened and has a feeling of
loathing when one who is not any longer loving him though he is
still loving that one threatens to really injure him. How should
that one knowing that the other one is not any longer loving be so
afraid when the other one threatens to really injure him. Is it
that until then he could never, he being an attacking one, could
never really realise that the other one was not loving him. Why
should a courageous one be afraid when one who has once loved him
threatens to hurt him when he would not be afraid earlier or later
of that one. Is it vanity or the bitter feeling of being really an
abandoned one lonely and suffering because some one is really
positively not loving that one. I think it is in mostly every one,
in certainly a good many women and men a kind of the last one left
on earth all alone feeling when they are realising even when they
are not any longer loving that one that some one really truly
completely actually does not any longer love them. But all this is
just something that is happening. Now I am telling a little more
about loving. Alfred Hersland and Julia Dehning came to have some
loving feeling and then they came to marrying. I am beginning again
a history of them.</p>

<p>I was seeing one to-day who reminded me very much of another one
I have seen doing very much loving and both of these certainly are
in a way in living that is a natural way to feel about the being,
the acting and the living in them. These were in a way quite
different ones these two in their complete living I am certain but
they both being of the resisting kind in men and women were and are
and will be so completely on fire always every minute in existing
that they are not really ever resisting anything and being of the
resisting not of the attacking kind of men and women the fire of it
is burning any one besides being just burning is burning that one
by accident of conflagration, are burning themselves by accident of
being themselves in a fire that is burning. I know just now two of
such of them, one of such of them I know quite well in all loving,
the other one I am just seeing sitting, standing, running, looking,
a little in talking, breathing and I will not be seeing any more in
living, I have not been seeing any more in living. The loving in
such of them is naturally from the being of them what any one
understanding now the being in such can be realising. All the ones
in between these and engulfing ones, between these and completely
resisting ones are existing. I have seen quite a number of them. I
am seeing these days very many kinds of men and women. Sometimes
now I am tired out and irritated and not at all amiable about them
because they are not some of them like any other one I have been
knowing. Sometimes then now I have a very irritable feeling in
looking and sometimes some one these days and I am looking steadily
at them are very completely illuminating a kind in men and women. I
am these days seeing men and women. I am these days looking and
looking and looking at them and then I am all worn out and
irritated by being wearied with seeing and not seeing being in
them. I see a very considerable number just now of men and women. I
am wearied and not weary with my learning always more and more and
then not being really ever certain. I am a happy one, that is quite
reasonably certain. I am quite a very happy person. I am quite
completely a very happy person seeing very many men and women.</p>

<p>I am listening just now to many women loving one, a resisting
one who is not burning. This one certainly is not burning, not
burning himself or any one by conflagration. This is one of the
resisting kind of them I have been describing not having any
weakness in him and all the romantic strength of intelligent and
active genius to very many knowing him. This gives in him some
appearance of burning to some. One having as I was saying being
like wood cut and excellent and hard and sometimes made into shapes
very fanciful and delicate and perhaps symbolic but always being
solid wood cut and not sensitive to being a weak thing by being a
thing having sap flowing. This one then as I am saying is always
being one having many loving him, insisting upon loving him,
clinging adoring, following, needing him. He is having very many
kinds of women always loving him. He is a very nice man really in
his loving. He is sentimental a little and solid and firm and
gentle and complete in loving and not any longer loving.</p>

<p>Sometime I will describe very many who are loving in their
living. I have now described some, and I am feeling very many
loving everywhere in living. I am feeling a very great many men and
women, I am feeling a very great many men and women doing loving.
More and more I will be satisfied with every kind there is in men
and women of being, doing loving. Now I am really beginning again
about being in Alfred Hersland and in Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland as almost any one can tell now by remembering
was of the resisting engulfing kind in men and women, not a very
complete one in being, fairly aspiring in being and in living, not
really failing not really succeeding in the whole of the living in
him, not completely certain that to be dead was to be really a dead
one, not quite completely entirely utterly certain that to be dead
was not to be really a dead one. Julia Dehning I am just beginning
describing. Julia Dehning was of the attacking kind in men and
women. Julia Dehning was of the kind of attacking kind who mostly
are spending their living resisting being at bottom changing in
their way of doing any attacking. They are attacking with some
excitement everything to mostly every one seeing them, really they
are resisting all their living any changing in their feeling of
attacking. In a way then at bottom they are mostly all their living
not having any stimulation. Mostly to every one they are excitedly
every minute being stimulated by something. I am going to tell a
good deal now about attacking being. I am beginning preparing
myself now to be courageous to do this thing. I am feeling a little
weak now in courageous feeling as is quite common in my living. I
am remembering and remembering attacking being. I am a little
realising this thing. I am beginning again now remembering
realising attacking being in men and women, in Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>Hopefulness is to me very interesting. Any one expecting
anything to be coming out of them, being fairly certain in being a
hopeful one is to me fairly interesting. There have been in me
feeling very nearly to being a completely miserable one in having
another one fairly certain of having something coming from them, of
being fairly completely a hopeful one. There are very hopeful ones
having resisting being or engulfing resisting being in them, there
are hopeful ones having attacking being. I will now soon be
describing hopeful being in men and women having attacking being in
them. I have been pretty miserable sometimes seeing them, hearing
them, feeling them. I have been quite very miserable hearing,
feeling and seeing some, some are having complete hopefulness of
enthusiastic or excited or passionate attacking being. I have not
had a miserable feeling from seeing or hearing or feeling attacking
hopeful ones who are completely fighting ones or pushing ones or
winning ones in living. I have not been miserable about them, not
at all, I have not been miserable for them the excited or
enthusiastic or passionate ones, not at all, I have been a
miserable one because I have been always a little pretty nearly
certain that I would be ending failing and every one enthusiastic
or passionate or sensitive or excited in attacking would then make
me a jealous one, a miserable one having a sad and sombre feeling,
being certain that to be dead was to be really a dead one and that
I pretty nearly certainly would be always being nearer and more
nearly a completely dead one. I had very much such being in me and
I was a sad resisting depressed jealous one then and now I am
telling this thing.</p>

<p>Attacking being and resisting being have each their way of
having hopeful feeling. Some have very much hopeful feeling, some
have less, some have none, some have pretty nearly none, some not
any at all really hopeful feeling. Each one has their own way of
having in them certain feeling, hopeful feeling. I am loving to
know every one having or not having hopeful feeling in them,
certain feeling in them. I am wanting to know every one who ever
was or is or will be living, all the being in each one of them, all
the kinds there are of men and women, all the ways each one has
anything ever in them everything they ever have in them in
them.</p>

<p>It is certainly a very queer thing to be certain sometime about
some one that they have been all their living that kind of one in
their being. It is certainly a most queer feeling of dreaming that
one has in one when one is certain about some one of the being in
them and then is remembering the being in that one that was in that
one when one was not really knowing that one very well but still
quite well. It is a very queer feeling of dreaming that one has
then. It comes then sharply to one then to be deciding whether one
is really then ever certain about anything, any one. And yet I
certainly am certain that sometime I am really completely knowing
some one and very often I have in me a queer feeling like dreaming.
It is then a curious thing in feeling to be coming to learn to know
very completely any one. I have come to know very completely now,
pretty nearly completely now Julia Dehning and I am now beginning
to tell all the being in Julia Dehning as I have been learning to
be realising the being in Julia Dehning. Julia Dehning was of the
attacking kind in men and women. I have mentioned this thing. Julia
Dehning was of one kind of the attacking kind in men and women. I
have told a little about this kind of the attacking kind in men and
women. I will slowly quite slowly I am hoping be telling the
complete history of Julia Dehning, I will slowly certainly fairly
slowly be describing all the being of Julia Dehning, I will be
always telling a very good deal about attacking being in men and
women. I will be telling a good deal about hoping and loving and
liking to be a cold or a hot one in the attacking kind in men and
women. I will be always somehow managing to be remembering learning
being in Julia Dehning. I am writing the history of Alfred Hersland
and Julia Dehning and of every one pretty nearly every one they
came to know in their living, of pretty nearly every one who came
to know them or to know about them. I am remembering always that
each one is repeating always all their being, I am remembering that
very often I am very much not knowing what they are saying to other
ones, what they are feeling, how they are not feeling and doing
what I am thinking and hearing they are saying and doing, I am
remembering that very often they are having being in them and I am
supplying in them in my feeling what they certainly have not been
having in them. In short I am remembering and I am a little
melancholy with it in me now I am quite certain. I would so be
content with knowing everything. I am giving now a history of
Alfred Hersland and Julia Dehning. It is puzzling that each one has
had being in them and have been repeating the whole being of them
and I have not been hearing seeing feeling all the being in them.
Yes it is certainly true of them of very many men and very many
women I have not been hearing more than a part of the repeating
coming out of them. They are each one always repeating all the
being in them. I am certain. I am hearing always very much
repeating coming out of each one I am ever knowing. I am not
hearing anywhere nearly all the repeating coming out of them each
one I am ever knowing. I am always hearing, seeing, feeling
repeating coming out of each one I am ever knowing. I am knowing
kinds in men and women. I am not hearing a wonderful amount of
repeating always coming, I am now quite certain. I could be so
happy knowing everything. I could be enjoying so much having
curious feeling about every one if always more and more I could
certainly be hearing, feeling seeing all every bit of repeating
coming in any way out of every one. I am enjoying having curious
feeling about every one, I like every bit of repeating I am
hearing, I get an awful sinking feeling when I find out by an
accidental hearing, feeling, seeing repeating from some one what I
have not been hearing, feeling, seeing as repeating in this one and
then I am saying if it had not been for this little accidental
thing I would not have known this repeating in this one and it is
so easy not to have such an accidental happening. Alas, I say then,
alas, I will perhaps not really ever be knowing all the repeating
coming out of each one. I know some of the repeating coming out of
Alfred Hersland and Julia Dehning and some others whom they knew
and some others who knew them and I will now be describing what I
am desolately feeling is all being in them. I am desolate because I
am not certainly hearing all repeating, I am almost sulking. I am
beginning now to go on with my history of the Dehning family and of
Julia Dehning and of her marrying and of the Hersland family and of
Alfred Hersland and of every one they any of them came to know in
their living. To begin again then from pretty nearly the beginning.
I am remembering everything I have been telling. I am always loving
all repeating. I am realising kinds in men and women. I am
realising Alfred Hersland and Julia Dehning. That is I am certainly
somewhere near to a fairly complete realisation of them and of some
whom they knew each one and who came to know them either of them. I
am a little tired now with all this beginning again. I am hoping
that I am going on again.</p>

<p>The Hersland family living was different from the Dehning family
living. The Dehning family living was that of right very rich
American being. It was the living of the Dehning family being and
the living of the Dehning family living, very rich American living.
The Dehning family was different from the Hersland family. There
was Mr. Henry Dehning and Mrs. Dehning and Julia Dehning and George
Dehning and Hortense Dehning. They were each one themselves inside
them, they made together then a family living, they were living
then right very rich American living. Mr. Henry Dehning had his
being in him, Mrs. Dehning had her being in her, Julia Dehning had
her being in her, George Dehning had his being in him, Hortense
Dehning had her being in her, this is to be now the history of all
the living in each one of them, of the family living they had in
living, of the living they had each one with each one of the others
of them and with themselves inside them, this is to be the history
of every one almost every one, they ever came to know, any one of
them in living, the history of every one who came to know of them
to know of any one of them, of any one ever connected in anyway
with them, in any way with any one of them. There are a great many
men and women always living. This is to be now some history of some
of them.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Dehning was a foreign American, he was living then the
living of a very rich American, he was a very different kind of a
person from Mr. David Hersland. They never met in their living.
This will have been and will be a history of both of them. Mr.
David Hersland as I have said was full up with beginning and later
full up with impatient feeling. Mr. Henry Dehning was not at all
the same kind in living as Mr. David Hersland. Mr. Henry Dehning
was married to one who was of the attacking kind in men and women,
Mr. Henry Dehning was a resisting kind of them that was so diffused
in smoothly and compactly resisting that be seemed to be always
steadily to be attacking. He would very often not be hearing what
any one was saying to him. He was a very nice man, he was quite
entirely almost a good man. He was pretty nearly completely a quite
successful man. He was loving to his wife and to his children, he
was ready to listen and to understand any one's wanting to be doing
something. He and his wife lived together like very many good men
and women, his wife was not too good a woman but she was a good
woman, not a bad one. She was pretty harsh in any attacking, he was
not gentle but he was smoother in resisting. They were really very
nice and good and pleasant and successful and happy and content in
married living. They both came to be a little worried with being
old ones and having to take care of their own and each other's
older troubles as older people come to have them with the body
wearing they have then in them. She made him do what she wanted him
to do, he made her do what he wanted her to do, they made each
other do what they wanted each other to do, very much less were
they doing this thing with their children. They were very rich
American man and woman living very well the right very rich
American living. I have been telling very much of Hersland family
living. I will now be telling something of Dehning family living. I
will be giving some history of each one of them. Mr. and Mrs.
Dehning were really very nice very rich good kind quite completely
successful a little troubled American man and woman. I am now
beginning repeating with fuller repeating the living in them, the
living they had in their living.</p>

<p>The Dehning family each one and as family living was different
enough from the Hersland family each one and Hersland family
living. The Dehnings as I am saying were really always all their
family living living the living as right very rich Americans. Mr.
Dehning as I was saying in the beginning of writing after he was
born came to America quite a poor person with brothers and sisters
and a mother and a father all quite poor like him and he was quite
a nice one then and he came to be quite a very rich one. Mr.
Hersland came to the making of a large fortune out in Gossols as I
was saying but as I was saying he was not in his family living
living right rich American living. The Dehnings were all their
family living living the right very rich American living. They were
really very nice ones in this living, they were very different from
the Herslands when the young Dehnings came to be knowing the young
Herslands. The Dehnings were living completely nicely as family
living very rich right American living. Each one of them of the
Dehning family had their own being in them, all together they had a
family living in them.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning was quite a good man, a good business man, a good
enough citizen, a good husband to his wife and a good enough father
to his children. He was quite a careful and generous and kindly man
and always could be fairly made by his wife to do what she would
have him, he was also fairly ready to listen to his children when
they wanted anything in their living. He was as I am saying quite a
good man, a quite good man in business living, a quite good man
quite entirely a good man in his family, in his daily living. He
came to be an old man and was then a little shrunk then from
outside him. His wife was sick then, a good deal in taking care of
him, keeping him from eating what was not good for him, keeping him
then from smoking which was then bad for him, keeping him then from
any excitement of business living which was then a thing the doctor
had quite forbidden to him. Later then she was a sick one and while
he was shrinking some away from the outside of him, she died from
too much coming to be inside her for her living. She left him then
wishing he had been the one to be the dead one for the sake of the
children. She knew he certainly would be needing something to fill
him, something to warm him now he would be shrunk away a little
from the outside of him. Not any man certainly not the man she had
known all her living could not be managed to be married by a woman
and then there would be trouble with money and her children and it
would have been better that he had been the first one to be the
dead one and then she would have been handing the money over very
entirely to the children. She was the first one to be a dead one as
I am saying and he did not as a matter of fact marry any one but it
was it is surely certain a little struggle for his children with a
sister-in-law and some one else to help him to keep him from
marrying. All this will be told later in the history of George
Dehning and Hortense Dehning and Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>As I was saying the Dehning family living was very different
from the Hersland family living. Mr. and Mrs. Dehning and Julia and
George and Hortense Dehning all were living all their family living
completely and pretty nicely and quite pleasantly and fairly freely
right very rich American living. They lived it very well then. It
was quite a pleasant thing in them. It was not quite entirely a
pleasant thing in them but it was quite a good deal a pleasant
thing in them. There were five of them Mrs. Dehning and Mr. Dehning
and Julia and George and Hortense Dehning, this is to be now some
description of them again and some description again of family
living in them and some description of some people knowing them.
Then there will be more description of the marrying and married
living of Julia Dehning and Alfred Hersland.</p>

<p>One is telling and I am hearing that there is not a need in
every one to be a courageous one to do ordinary living. Some are
doing ordinary living without any need in them to have courage in
them to do that thing. Very many are needing very much courage in
them to do that thing, to be every day completely living ordinary
living. For some it takes courage to be killing anything, like a
buzzing thing or a fly, to buy anything, to sell anything, to eat
anything, to drink anything, to remember anything, to want
anything, to forget anything, to decide anything, to like anything.
Some and some one is telling this to me and I am listening do not
need courage for any such thing. The attacking and resisting kind
in men and women, those having attacking naturally do not need much
courage for just daily living. Mrs. Dehning did not need much
courage for daily living, Julia Dehning had so little that she
needed as courage for daily living that it went over to her being
too energetic not to be nervous in her daily living. The
nervousness of attacking and resisting being is interesting. I am
now beginning to be ready to completely feel being in Mrs. Dehning.
I am a little not ready yet to feel being in Mr. Dehning. I am
almost ready to feel all being there is or was or will be in Julia
Dehning. It is a very difficult thing to believe that any one has
seen everything in anything and that one has just glanced at that
thing and you have had to be looking very long at that thing. Some
one has just glanced at a book and you have read that book and the
other one knows everything in that book, in short the other one is
a quick one and you are a slow one, it is a very difficult thing to
really find it convincing that that one has really been reading
that book in such a quick glancing. That one is telling all the
things in the book that is certain, to mostly every one any one
being a slower one or a quicker one in detail of daily living is an
astonishing thing, a thing very difficult to be realising a thing
to be believing because of its being a thing every little minute is
proving, a thing that always is a little not a real thing like
seeing any slight of hand performing. It is a very difficult thing
being really certain of anything any one is doing in any kind of a
way any one is naturally acting. I am beginning now to be
describing Mrs. Dehning. Mr. Dehning is not completely in me yet, I
am certain. Mrs. Dehning is quite in me, I am certain. Mrs. Dehning
is an attacking, a harsh continuous, not too quickly, fairly good,
attacking one. She was to herself and to every one a good enough
one in all her living. This is to be now a description of her being
and a little description of all her living. She was an attacking
one, she could be a very gay and cheery one, she was a pretty
stupid one, she was fairly quick and not a very quick one. She was
an important one. She was important to herself to every one. She
was a little a lonesome one in dying, she was knowing that her
husband who was a very good man and a very devoted one would be
needing a woman to fill him, she knew his children should not want
for their sake that he should marry some one. She was a little a
lonesome one in dying.</p>

<p>When he was sick, Mr. Dehning, she could make him do what she
wanted him to be doing by doing quite excited attacking. He could
make her do what he wanted her to be doing. They were to mostly
every one not very sweet in their living together then, really then
they were quite sweet in their living together then. They could
each one make the other one do what they wanted the other one to be
doing. Mrs. Dehning could be a cherry and quite gay one, she was
quite an ambitious one, she was a crudely attacking one, she was
not a very quick one, she was quite completely in her being feeling
a stupid one, she was to herself important to every one, she was
quite really an important one, she had a good deal of sense for
living, she was mostly then a quite good enough one.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning was quite entirely a mostly good enough one. He had
quite a great deal of sense for living. He was not in feeling a
very stupid one, he was quite in feeling not a stupid one, he was
not a gentle one but he was quite a complete one, he was then for
very many a gentle one, he was not really a gentle one, he was
quite a complete one, he was quite a good one to be listening to
any one who wanted to be doing anything, he was quite a completely
successful one in living, when he was an older one he was a little
a worried one from being an old one, from not being really a
complete one in his children who were not in him complete ones, who
were struggling; his wife always had been in him to be him a
complete one although she was a crudely harsh one because she
really had some sense for living because really she could and
always did make him do what she wanted him to be doing because he
always could and did make her do what he wanted her to be doing.
They were pretty even then altogether in their living, in their
being, in their being quicker and slower, attacking and resisting,
having courage and patience and sense in living, having ambition
and success, and failing a little in coming to be old ones and
dying.</p>

<p>This is to be now more history of both of them, not so very much
more description of the two of them.</p>

<p>There was then the Dehning family living, the right very rich
American family living. There was then the Dehning very rich good
enough family living. Mr. and Mrs. Dehning were very completely
living very rich American right family living. They had country
house living and city living. They had both of them sense for
living, this is now to be a considerable amount more of description
of them.</p>

<p>There are many who like it in their living to have more ready
than they can be using. Mr. Dehning was in a way such a one. Mrs.
Dehning was not in a way not such a one. Mr. Dehning was such a
one, was believing in being such a one. Mr. Dehning was quite
certainly such a one. Mr. Dehning was a very successful one quite
entirely a successful one, Mr. Dehning had always in living more
ready than he needed to be using, than he could be using, than he
was using. Mrs. Dehning was not such a one. Mrs. Dehning was not
such a one by her own being in her but she was one having it in her
to be realising always completely inside her that they had it in
them as family living, all their family living to have more ready
than they were using. They were quite reasonably pleasant in this
thing. Mr. Dehning was entirely justly pleasant in this thing. He
had this being in him he had always certainly more ready than he
was using. This made him what he was to every one this with the
rest of being in him. This is to be now a little more description
of him. Certainly he had it in him, certainly all his living to his
dying, that he had more ready than he was needing to be using.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dehning was not an old woman when she came to be a dead one
and she looked a younger one than she was then. He was not an old
man a very old man when he came to be a dead one. They were both of
them living and dying and dead ones of the right very rich American
living. This will be now more history of the Dehning family living.
This is to be now more description of Mrs. Dehning and Mr. Dehning.
Mr. Dehning was always believing in having a good deal more ready
than he was using. Mr. Dehning was always ready to be listening to
any one wanting to be doing anything. Mr. Dehning was quite a
pleasant one to have as a father to any one. He was to himself an
important one to be giving advice and to be listening to any one
who really wanted to be doing anything. He was a little an
important one inside him from believing that every one should have
more ready than they were needing. He was to himself an important
one from always certainly having more than he was needing. This was
important being in him. Being ready to listen to any one who was
wanting to do anything was important being in him. Being an
attacking one was important being in Mrs. Dehning. Being a very
rich one was important being in Mrs. Dehning. Being the mother of
children with whom she was showing was important being in Mrs.
Dehning. Making Mr. Dehning do what she would have was gay and
satisfactory important being in Mrs. Dehning. Mr. Dehning and Mrs.
Dehning each of them had important being of themselves to
themselves inside them, each one of them was an important one in
living. This is to be now more description of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dehning had nervous being, that is to say she had attacking
being and very often that was exciting to her being and made her
have in her nervous being, later in her living when Julia was
leading Dehning family living Mrs. Dehning had nervous being from
being one a little following feeling being one leading in
attacking. Later she had nervous being with lonesomeness and
walking in a restless fashion and wanting to be having something
like a dog she had once only she was afraid then that when she
would lose him she would be afraid that another one would not be a
nice one. She had nervous feeling then of being very certain that
she had been all her living a good woman, a good enough woman and
an important one, an important enough one and now she was telling
this thing again and again and Julia was not happy then nor
succeeding then in married living. She was then, Mrs. Dehning,
taking very good care of Mr. Dehning, she was sometimes then very
attacking in making him do something that was good for him. They
were living then being important in each other making each other do
something then good for each other one to be then doing. Mrs.
Dehning was not such an old one when she came to dying. As I was
saying she was certain if Mr. Dehning had not been left by her
being a dead one he would not make it harder for every one by
wanting to be marrying again as any man being left certainly would
want to be doing. Mrs. Dehning certainly was very worried about
this thing as she was certain that he would be living when she was
not any longer living with him. Mrs. Dehning as I was saying was
one having attacking being. This is to be now some more description
of her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dehning was not an unpleasant one. No certainly not, Mrs.
Dehning was not an unpleasant one. She was not a pleasant one. This
is to be now some more description. Mrs. Dehning was an important
one. She was an important enough one. Mrs. Dehning lived very well
the Dehning very rich American living. She was in a way a gay one,
she was very often quite a gay one, she certainly was very often
very unpleasant to very many having a pleasant time when she was
among them. She was very often not a pleasant one. She was in a way
a stupid one, she was by way of stupid being that was being in her
crude in attacking, in being an important one, she could be as I
was saying and certainly was a nervous one. She had sense for
living, that is certain. Now I will tell more of Dehning family
living.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dehning was a whole being. It is very difficult remembering
the whole being in any one. It is very difficult remembering the
whole of them of any one. Realising the being in them as attacking
or resisting is very good for remembering the whole being in any
one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dehning was an attacking one. She had sense for living, she
was not then a really stupid one. She was not as strong as her
attacking, she was then not such an important one as she was in
living, she was a stupid one in being unmeaning in being a harsh
one, she was a nervous one in being one following because her
daughter Julia was leading, she was a gay one in being one having
life in her being, she was a good one in making her husband do
everything that was good for him when he was a sick one, she was
not a bad one in living in not having any need to oppress any one
to her being. She was one then who was living the very right rich
American living all her living. She was one not having this living
as an unpleasant thing, she was one having stupid being in harsh
attacking for not any winning, she was in this thing quite
completely a stupid one. She was not an old woman when she was a
dead one, she was a completely stupid one in attacking for not any
winning. She was attacking for not any winning very much in every
day of living. She was in such attacking a stupid coarse and not a
gay one. She was a gay one in having her being alive in her all her
living. She had sense for living in having been making her husband
do what she needed for her living he should be doing, in having
been doing all her living what he needed she should be doing. This
was being then in Mrs. Dehning. This is remembering all the being
in Mrs. Dehning. All this I have been telling is remembering all
the being in Mrs. Dehning.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning was a whole one in living. He lived after Mrs.
Dehning was a dead one. He had then luke-warm being needing to be
warmer to be really living. He was a dead one without coming to be
again a really warm one. This is very common. This is very common
when a man is an old man needing to be careful of eating, drinking,
smoking and everything and his wife is a dead one and he has grown
children and he is a rich one and he likes to be again a quite warm
one. Mr. Dehning was really a quite good enough man for all living,
for any kind of living he ever could have in him from his beginning
to his ending.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning could listen to any one wanting to do anything. Mr.
Dehning could listen to his children to any one of them wanting to
do anything. Mr. Dehning was not really listening to Mrs. Dehning
when she wanted that he should be doing something. As I said of
them he did what she needed he should be doing for her living in
her being, she did what he needed she should be doing for his
living in his being. He was of the resisting kind in men and women
but really he was not to any one resisting, he was always listening
to any one who wanted to be doing anything. He had really sense for
living. He lived very well very rich right American living. He had
lived all of his living. He liked very well all of his living. He
would have been liking it better if his children had been more
actively succeeding. He was very well doing all of his living. He
liked it very well that he liked hearing what any one could tell
him that they wanted to be doing. He liked it very well with every
one, with any of his brothers or his sisters or their children. He
liked this completely well in him in his living. Mr. Dehning lived
very well, quite completely well very rich right American living.
There will be now some more description of him.</p>

<p>When he was a young one he was most likely quite a good one, not
a very exciting one, quite a pleasant one, entirely an efficient
one, quite a pleasant one. He was then very likely a reasonably
social one, a little a quiet firm good one, a little a one wanting
a woman to own him by attacking loving. He was one then probably a
little then sometime telling a little to some one what a good one
should be doing in being one doing living.</p>

<p>I am thinking, I am knowing, when I am reading, when I am
hearing, when I am seeing, when I am writing, when lam talking,
that very many are not feeling thinking believing what some one
thinks every one is naturally believing feeling thinking. Mr.
Dehning as I am saying often was a man more and more in living
always listening to any one wanting to be doing anything. Really
then he was listening to any one wanting to be doing anything,
really he always had sense for living, really sense for living,
really though he was believing that each one in a way was believing
feeling being something that some certainly are really never
believing feeling thinking.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning very likely when he was a young man and then when he
was beginning middle living was one who sometimes was telling what
a man living the life a reasonably good man should be living should
be doing. He was a man who all his living really was not ever
really failing. He was a very rich American. He was married to Mrs.
Dehning. He had three children Julia, George and Hortense Dehning.
He had playfulness in him in living, he needed his wife to be
owning him by attacking, he needed to be a wise man in pleasant
advising, he needed to be an important man by being always ready to
be listening to any one wanting to be doing anything. There will be
written now some history of him.</p>

<p>He was a man who came to be by living living very completely the
living of a very rich American. He was a man in his later living
quite reasonably often telling the history of the living he had
been all his living doing. He was a man many were likingly admiring
without ever thinking much about what he was in all his living.
Certainly when he was a young man and a man beginning middle living
he was one having very much sense indeed for living. When he was
quite a young man certainly he sometimes then was telling some one
what a man living a reasonably good kind of living should be doing
all his living. Surely all his living he was quite reasonably a
fair man to be living with men, with women, with children. He
always more and more was ready to be listening to any one who
really wanted to be doing anything. This was all being in him, all
that I have been describing. He came to be an old man a little
luke-warm inside him and wanting then to be a warmer one. This is
certain. I think I have been telling for just now enough history of
him.</p>

<p>This then has been now a little description of Mrs. Dehning and
Mr. Dehning, there will be now written a little more description of
the Dehning family living, there will be then be written a
description of Julia Dehning. The history of George Dehning and
Hortense Dehning will be written in the long history to be written
of David Hersland and that will be written after the complete
writing of the loving and the marrying and the being and the living
in Alfred Hersland and Julia Dehning and ever one they knew and who
came to know them or to know about them. I am going on then now
telling about Dehning family living, about Alfred Hersland and
Julia Dehning loving and marrying and living.</p>

<p>I like very well to know it of each one what kind of living they
have been, they are doing, they will be doing in living. I like
knowing the living in each one. I like to listen to any one, I like
to hear the living they have in them, I like to know the kind of
feeling, thinking, doing each one has in her, has in him. I like to
hear everything. I like to know all living. I like to know the
living in any one. I like very much to be realising every kind of
living. I like very much to be realising in each one the living
they had, they have, they can have in them. I like so very much to
be really feeling every kind of way there is of having living
feeling. I am always more and more realising that not any living
any one ever is or was describing is not existing. There are so
very many kinds of ways of living, of feeling living always
existing. I like always to be listening to stories of feeling
living. More and more and more there are to me many kinds of ways
of feeling living. I am remembering my beginning feeling kinds in
feeling living. I am certain I cannot ever be realising any more
kinds of living, of feeling living than I will have been hearing
from some describing. I certainly never will be knowing all the
kinds of ways there are of feeling living. Of that I am really
certain, lam always feeling I can perhaps not certainly but still
possibly come to be realising pretty nearly all the kinds there are
in men and women. Perhaps I cannot but I certainly have a very good
deal such a feeling. I certainly am knowing I certainly will not be
realising very many kinds of ways of feeling living. I have just
been a little beginning this thing, realising kinds of ways of
feeling ways in living. I am realising fairly well the Dehning
family way of living. I have a pretty helpless feeling with feeling
all the kinds of ways there are of living, of feeling ways of
living, of having ways in living. I feel like one a little
beginning and certainly not going to be making very much of
progressing. I am remembering I always was very halting in
realising ways of living, ways of feeling ways of living. I am
learning but not really grasping these things in me, that is
certain. I am loving to be knowing all the kinds there are in men
and women, all the being each one has in him all his living. I am
being then a very happy one in knowing kinds in men and women, in
being certain that sometime there will be written a complete
history a complete description of all the kinds there are in men
and women. I am completely then living in being certain of kinds in
men and women, in each one having their own being in them, in being
certain that sometime some one will be knowing certainly all the
being each one has in living, all the kinds there are in men and
women. This is then complete being in me, complete living in me,
the kinds there are in men and women, the kind of way each one has
in that one to he naturally loving, working, feeling, anything,
everything. I have in me completely halting learning in realising
ways of living in men and women. I have learnt some. I am learning
now some more, a fair number more from some one. I am haltingly
learning, beginning learning this thing, I am remembering how each
kind of way of living was a thing not real and having been needing
that I should be convincing myself that it really was really an
existing way of really living. I have not with ways of living that
slow openness of steady realisation, that joy in always being
certain that it is repeating, I know ways of living are repeating,
I am not realising them as repeating, I know it of them, I do not
really truly feel it in them. I do not know whether I am clearly
expressing now a feeling. I will sometime begin again telling how I
am not really realising ways of living.</p>

<p>I am realising each one always sometime. And just now I am
seeing each one having something, some kind of thing in them that
is interesting that I was not naturally seeing they were, having.
That is making for me a new way of feeling living. I do not know
whether I am liking this thing. I am of the resisting kind in men
and women. I am not very certain I am liking it that I am beginning
a realising a quite new way to me of feeling living. As I was
saying it is not a natural thing to me to be realising ways of
feeling living. It is a natural thing to me to be realising in each
one some being, a good deal of being, sometimes all the being they
have or can have or did have in them. To me ways of feeling living
is different in some having in them almost quite completely the
same way of being. As I was saying the Dehnings had in them very
rich right American living. That is then one way of feeling living.
As I am saying I have all my life not naturally been learning
realising ways of feeling living. I am now being taught by some one
that some have a way of feeling living that I have not ever been
realising. I like it although it is to me upsetting learning
anything I am not naturally learning. I have been learning all my
living very much that to me was upsetting as being not to me a
natural thing to be learning. If it is to me completely a not
natural thing to be learning I certainly am ending with not having
been learning that thing, I will be knowing sometime whether it is
not a completely not natural thing for me to be learning to be
realising, ways of feeling living with different kinds of living.
The Dehnings then were then living, very pleasantly, quite entirely
decently, not very aggressively, pretty freely, quite contentedly,
fairly advancedly, thoroughly generously, quite gaily, pretty
entirely cheerfully, right very rich American living.</p>

<p>As I am saying I am learning just now to be seeing in each one
things that are interesting in them that it is not certainly easily
natural for me to be observing, realising of them. This is leading
to being more open to realising ways of feeling living that are
different to different kinds of ways of living. I like seeing
things in each one that are interesting, I even in a way like
learning seeing a new way of seeing new, to me, things in them. I
like it in a way I say, I find it hard to let myself not resist at
all to this thing. I am resisting, I am too doing this thing.
Sometime I will know what I am now doing. That is just now to me a
little a comforting thing. I am beginning again going on telling
the history of the Dehning family living, of Julia Dehning, of her
marrying and loving and living and learning or not learning.</p>

<p>The Dehnings liked living. They all did that thing very well,
quite well as people go, in doing this thing. They all of them all
of the Dehnings liked very well being in living. They all had in a
way some sense for living. This is to be now some history of all of
them and of the living in them. They all quite entirely liked
living, all five of them. They all went on living up to the end of
their living. This is to be now the history of each one of the five
of them, of all of them. This is to be now a history of Dehning
family living, of Mrs. Dehning and Mr. Dehning and Julia and George
and Hortense Dehning. I am beginning now this history of all of
them. I am beginning now with Julia Dehning, in her family living,
in her married living, in all of her living. There will be all the
time then now a description of the living of all of them of the
Dehning family living then. I am beginning now again.</p>

<p>Some have all their living nervous being, nervous feeling. Julia
Dehning had quite a great deal of nervous being the bigger part of
her living. Some have nervousness from sensitive being in them,
some do not have nervousness from sensitive being in them. Some
have nervousness from ambition in them. Some have nervousness in
them pretty nearly all of their living. Some do not have
nervousness in them in their living and then it comes to be in them
and then they come to be dead ones or perhaps really crazy ones and
it is a very difficult thing to know it of some one whether
nervousness is just nervousness or will be something stronger in
them. Very many have very much nervousness in them all of their
living. Some have nervousness from sensitiveness in them, some from
ambition in them, some do not have nervousness in them most of
their living. Julia Dehning was not such a one. Julia Dehning had
nervousness a good deal in her in her living, it was not in her
from sensitiveness, it was not in her from ambition, it did not
come to be more strongly in her, it was always all her living a
good deal in her, it was not excitement in her, it was attacking
being in her being resisting to any changing of her way of having
attacking being. This was in her all her living. This is now to be
some history of her.</p>

<p>Living having meaning to any one doing living, being living,
this is a thing very many are feeling, being certain in, denying.
As I was saying Mr. Dehning and Mrs. Dehning had each one of them
in their own way sense for living, in some way living had in them
for them really meaning. Mrs. Dehning was saying when trouble came
to them she could not really understand it that any one having been
so reasonably charitable to every one should have it that things
should happen to their children but always then she would go on
being a good woman because she was always certain to do this thing,
so she was saying. And later then when her children were not
thinking about her being in her in living she did not then see any
reason why she should go on thinking about what it was, all that
she could do for them and with their father for them but certainly
she would be going on doing everything for certainly she always was
a little certain she would go on doing everything. She had then as
I was saying sense for living. She was of the attacking kind in men
and women, she was nervous with being one attacking without
needing, without feeling winning, she was nervous with being not
following not leading in her children's later living, she was not
nervous with winning attacking in living her living with Mr.
Dehning, with many men and many women, she was nervous with very
much attacking and this she had always in being with harsh
attacking for not any winning, she was not nervous in being a gay
one in living, she was nervous with not following and not leading
in her children's later living. Mr. Dehning was not a very nervous
one, he was a nervous one in dying, in being a sick one for dying,
he was a nervous one in sudden action in being one not warm enough
for living in his later living. Mostly in his living, in his broad
careful even resisting, in his listening to any one who wanted to
do anything, in his feeling that sometime each one should do a
right thing, he was not nervous in living. Julia Dehning was a good
deal of her living a nervous one. This is to be now some history of
such a one, of some of such of them.</p>

<p>The Dehning family living was then a fairly free very rich very
decent right American living. As I was saying in the beginning of
telling Dehning family living, the Dehnings liked country house
living, they liked very well fairly free, perfectly decent, quite
generous very rich right American living. They certainly did live
this thing.</p>

<p>Julia was then the oldest of the Dehning children, George was
considerably younger and Hortense was a good deal younger than
George Dehning, Julia was then the beginning of Dehning completely
American living. This is a description of her being and of her
living, of her loving and of her marrying, and of all of her
living. Julia then was an American. Julia had her own being in her,
she was of a kind in men and women. This is to be now a description
of being in her and of living in her. Each one is inside them being
that one. Mostly every one has some way of feeling living in them.
Each one has ways in them that are in other ones living with
them.</p>

<p>Mostly every one has living having some kind of meaning to them.
Very many like it that they are doing something, living, working,
loving, dressing, dreaming, waking, cleaning something, being a
kind of a one, looking like some one, going to be doing something,
being a nice one, being a not nice one, helping something, helping
some one, winning, conquering, losing, forgetting, being an
influence in being a living one being a dead one, having courage to
be going on living, having a troubled living, being a worried one,
cleaning themselves all their living, learning something, beginning
something, forgetting something, ending something, liking old
things, leaving something, liking everything, liking pretty nearly
nothing, being disgusted with everything, liking new things,
leaving pretty nearly nothing, liking changing, liking being a
quiet one, liking fighting, being one making a peace between all
men and all women, and all women, and all men, lighting things out
to finishing, being honest in living, being failing for a reason,
being just failing, being just succeeding, being lucky, being an
unlucky one, being a really completely successful one, being one
submitting to everything, being loved by every one, being one
submitting to almost nothing, being one certain that one should be
one submitting to being a good one, being hated by a good many who
come to know them, being certain of spending money, of being
saving, being one loving god, being one loving living, being one
loved by god always in being living, being one loving god and
living, being one needing religion, being one not needing anything
for living, being one not needing any one, being one not needing
any religion to support them, being one afraid in living, being one
always shivering with living, being one not having any realisation
of shivering in living, being one liking eating, being one liking
thinking, being one liking waking, being one certainly not afraid
to be dying, being one liking starving, being one liking to do
anything, being one liking to be resting, being one liking working,
being one certainly not afraid of doing anything, being one liking
to be in pain for themselves or some one, being one liking cold
days in out door living, being one liking rainy days around them,
being one liking hot sunshine on them, being one certainly not
afraid of anything, being one getting sick with cold or hot or
raining weather on them, being one not liking any fresh air on
them, being one not able to be breathing without much fresh air on
them, being a funny one, being one not liking funny ones, one not
liking queer ones in living, being one liking swimming, being one
tired of ocean bathing before they have really been in more than
twice in a season, being one excited with learning anything, being
one needing everything because anything was food to living for that
one, being one being excited at leaving anything, being one
learning always a little something, being one not thinking very
much about anything, of any one. There are all these ways then of
having living having meaning and there are innumerable other ones,
do not crowd so on me all the other ones, I know very well there
are very many other ones, I know very well I am not knowing all the
ways men and women are feeling living, I know very well I am not
knowing all the ways any one can have living have meaning. I know
very well I do not know all these things. I know very well I could
be very happy knowing everything. I know I am quite a happy one
knowing something of being. Now I am always hearing of ways some
have of feeling living and they come crowding and I am resisting so
that I can be slowly realising and always I am knowing I can never
really be knowing all the ways there are of feeling living, all the
ways there are of having living having meaning. I am knowing
something of kinds of being in men and women, I could know
sometime, if I could know completely all I could be knowing, all
the kinds there are of men and women. I am comforting now my
feeling by saying this thing in my complete feeling again and
again. I am beginning now a history of living, of feeling living,
of living having meaning in Julia Dehning and Alfred Hersland. I
have been telling something of the kind of being each one of them
had in them. I will tell very much more about the being each one of
them had in them.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning was all her life resisting any changing in
attacking. She was always resisting not attacking and so she was an
obstinate one not hearing what any one was saying. She was always
listening to every one who had a way of doing anything, and had
nervousness in doing it then, she was always all the time then
resisting being any kind of an attacking one that she had not
always been in all her living, she was harshly doing everything
that she knew about from hearing any one who was doing anything and
she was all her life resisting any changing in her attacking. She
was then the daughter of Mrs. Dehning and Mr. Dehning as I am
saying.</p>

<p>I know so well the kinds there are in men and women. I know so
well the kinds that are connected and the way they are connected
with other kinds in men and women. Julia Dehning was one having
attacking being and she was completely a stubborn one to not
hearing anything that was something to be a changing in any way
anything in her attacking. As I was saying Mrs. Dehning had sense
for living. As I was saying Mr. Dehning had sense for living. Julia
Dehning was not one really failing in living, Julia Dehning was one
not having really sense for living. Julia was one having really to
every one courage for living, Julia Dehning was of the independent
dependent kind in men and women, she was of that kind of them and
having power over those who were already loving with her, who were
already overwhelmed by attacking being in her, she was one who was
in a way certain that always some one would be there to hold her
when the last end of failing came so that it would not touch her,
to herself and to every one she was one not having any such
dependence in her, she was one always fighting whether to winning
or to losing, always courageous to be fighting, and in a way this
was true of her and always there was there in her that some one
would be there holding her when the last end of fighting was in
her, though to herself and to every other one this was not in her
as a thing she was needing for living, really though she could be
not knowing she was not fighting by the strength of herself in her
when the last end of fighting was in her and to herself then she
was keeping going on fighting by courage in her in every one near
her; really as I am saying of her she had not sense really for
living in her, really she had not really feeling in her whether she
was fighting for winning or for losing, realty she had not faith in
her that she was fighting for winning, really she did not have any
feeling that was independent dependent one in living, really she
had not really sense in her for living, really it was a very
difficult thing to know this in her, to know she was not having any
one do what she needed of them, that she was not ever doing
anything any one needed that she should be doing, for really she
was not failing in living, really she had much support and loving
in living, really she was some a loving one in living, really she
was all her living fighting and winning a good deal in fighting,
always she was learning everything, always she was really living to
herself and to every one. And yet she was completely not hearing,
feeling, seeing anything that was in any way changing any attacking
being she had all her living in her. She married Alfred Hersland
whom I have been already a good deal describing, this is to be a
history of the living and the being in her and of the slow learning
her that was in very many knowing her. I will be telling now of how
a good many different ones felt about her.</p>

<p>She was to mostly every one a completely honest one. She was to
mostly every one an earnest, an excited and an ambitious one, she
was to mostly every one one fighting to be successfully a winning
one by steady fighting all her living, by courage in resisting
being worn out by any one else's attacking, she was to every one
one being one leading in all fighting she was doing all her living,
she was one having complete conviction that thinking and working
and being an interested one in everything was something giving
meaning to her being in all of her living. This is to be now some
description of the way some were realising being in Julia
Dehning.</p>

<p>Many women like their children, some like children being as
babies, some like children being young ones, some like children
being older ones, some like their children being young men and
young women, some like their children being young men, some like
their children being young women. Julia Dehning liked her children
as little babies which was surprising to very many who knew Julia
Dehning quite well in her living, knew quite well her being. She
liked children all their living, she used all energy to learn
everything, she liked them completely as being little babies and
this in a way was surprising, not really surprising perhaps but all
the same somewhat surprising. Some women then are of the attacking
kind in living, some are of the resisting kind in living. Julia
Dehning was of the attacking kind in living. I have said sometime
that it is the resisting kind that need to own those they need for
loving. Now many of the attacking kind of them need to own those
they need for loving but they need to own them by attacking them to
hold them, attacking them to seize them and they can be doing this
completely with a little baby being with them. Some resisting ones
are completely loving children when they are little babies because
then they are completely owning them by possession, by the baby
being of them to them some of them. Some of the attacking kind of
them being of the dependent kind of them like the little babies as
then they are together dependent ones being together completely a
dependent being. Julia Dehning was of the independent dependent
kind in men and women. Sometime much later I will tell something of
women and children with them. Now I will only tell about Julia
Dehning loving and marrying and what some knowing her thought of
her as she was then being.</p>

<p>It is a very difficult thing to really let one's self be certain
that they are not sorry when every one is thinking they should be
sorry, that they are not glad when every one is thinking that they
are going to be a glad one, that they are not liking to be doing
something for some one they are loving when that one is thinking
they are glad to do that thing, that they are not pleased to see
some one when it is a natural thing for them in their living to be
glad to see such a one, that they are not moved by some one being
suffering when they being reasonably tender-hearted should be moved
then, that they are not remembering their own little needs when it
is not a decent time for them to be mentioning them. It is a very
difficult thing, some from superstition, fearing something bad will
happen if they let themselves know that they are what not any one
not having bad things going to be happening to them would be in
feeling, some from natural conviction that they are feeling always
what is right for them to be feeling, some from the sentimental
feeling that it is such a nice feeling feeling the right way in
living, some from not being really certain that to be a dead one is
to be really entirely a dead one, some from being quite certain
that to be a dead one is to be not at all a dead one, some from
having a fear in them that then something will happen badly to some
one, some from generous loving, some from enthusiasm, some from
being really that kind of a one one having some such feeling, it is
a very difficult thing to very many in living to let themselves be
saying feeling thinking what they are thinking feeling saying when
something happens to them happens to some one. I am saying this
long thing because I am feeling that this is a necessary thing to
be realising in learning knowing any one and yet it does very much
happen that one is having very really much more feeling the way any
one naturally is supposing they are having about anything about
everything than they themselves are thinking they are having. I
have been learning in my living all the being in many men and many
women, in Julia Dehning. I am always wanting to be realising the
whole being in each one of them, by feeling, by thinking, by
knowing by talking, by remembering. I am going to be telling very
soon now what very many felt in knowing Julia Dehning, what Julia
Dehning felt in living, what being what kind of being Julia Dehning
was inside her.</p>

<p>As I was saying she was of the attacking, the independent
dependent kind in men and women. As I was saying she was all
through her living resisting having any changing in her being one
doing one way of attacking. As I am saying she had in a way not
really a lack of successful living, really though she had not
really sense for living. That is what any one now certainly can be
realising. Each one is certainly like some one, having something in
them of the father and the mother of them. Mrs. Dehning was a
stupid one in being one attacking harshly and not for any winning,
and not for any winning of anything, not for winning excitement or
sensation or feeling or power or religion or good or bad anything
or anything. Julia had stupid being in being completely one
completely resisting any changing in her attacking. Mrs. Dehning
was a nervous one as I have been explaining. Julia was a nervous
one as I have been saying. Mrs. Dehning had really sense for
living. Julia had not really sense for living. Julia then was a
young woman. This is now to be a description of Julia Dehning, of
what others were feeling in Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>Some are knowing in living by their feeling that they are liking
something. Some are not knowing by their feeling what thing they
are liking. Some have so very much feeling that the feeling covers
anything to liking, some have so much excitement in living that
that thing covers everything. Some can need everything for anything
can be food to them. Very many, quite a number are living and not
telling by their feeling what they are liking. A good many are
living and are telling by their feeling what they are liking. As I
was saying Julia Dehning came to the marrying of Alfred Hersland.
This is the way they came to be loving, the way I have told once,
the way I am now telling. Some liked very much the being and the
living in Julia Dehning, some did not like at all the being and the
living in Julia Dehning; to some it was, the living and the being
in Julia Dehning, not a pleasant not an unpleasant thing. Julia
Dehning was not a harsh one in attacking without winning as her
mother was in her feeling. Julia was a stupid one in resisting any
changing in her being as attacking. Julia was a crude one then and
in such a way a stupid one but not really a harsh one. She was one
to herself and to every one having complete courage for living.
Really as I was saying she had not really sense for living and so
really then she had not really courage for living, she had
completely courage for resisting any changing in her being in her
way attacking, not really complete courage for this thing, she was
of the independent dependent kind of them.</p>

<p>I am feeling attacking kinds a little harshly just now in me, I
am now beginning again to have in me complete feeling of attacking
being in men and women.</p>

<p>Attacking kind are often very sweet ones to very many,
poignantly sweet ones and generous ones in living. Attacking kind
often have it in them to be as bad, as harsh, as crude as they feel
in them to any one because they know in living they are generous
ones needing to be attacking some one to have them love them. I
know this as certain. This gives to them the right to be harsh or
crude or eager as they have it in them that they have it in them
for living that they are generous in emotion, as they certainly
are, in poignant feeling, the need of attacking to win what they
are needing for living. Those having resisting being have it in
them very often to be afraid if they are too completely resisting
not any one will attack them enough to win them and they are uneasy
then in them. This is certainly not true of all attacking and all
resisting, these things I have been saying of attacking kind in men
and women of resisting kind in men and women, it is true of quite a
number of them. So then many of the attacking kind in men and women
feel it in them as a completely natural thing to be as harsh as
crude as active as eager in attacking as they feel it to have it in
them. Many of the resisting kind in men and women have it to be
very dubious about the doing all the resisting they have in them to
be doing. Many have attacking being have sweetness and courage in
attacking, and harshness and crudeness and eagerness in attacking.
I am now thinking about men and women having it in them to be
certain they are right in living.</p>

<p>As I am saying some knowing Julia Dehning like completely the
being and the living she had all her living, some did not like it
at all, some liked it well enough as I was saying. Some liked it
and then liked it well enough and then did not like it. Some liked
it very much and then liked it well enough. Some as I was saying
did not like it.</p>

<p>To mostly every one Julia had complete courage for living.
Slowly some came to understanding that really she had not sense for
living, that she had almost complete courage for not changing any
kind of attacking being she had in living. She had real courage in
her, that is certain. She had sweetness in her that is certain. She
had stupid being in her that is certain.</p>

<p>I will tell now more about attacking being, about enthusiasm,
about being certain in living, about what other ones are feeling,
thinking, saying.</p>

<p>I know Julia Dehning. Certainly I know Julia Dehning. Yes of
course I know Julia Dehning. Have I not certainly come to know
Julia Dehning. I certainly have come to know Julia Dehning, I know
Julia Dehning, I have known Julia Dehning, I am thinking I will
know Julia Dehning. How do I know Julia Dehning, I know Julia
Dehning as one at the end of her beginning living, at the beginning
of her middle living, at the middle of her middle living. I know
Julia Dehning as one having in her living marrying Alfred Hersland.
I know Julia Dehning in the Dehning family living, I know Julia
Dehning some as Mrs. Dehning, some as Mr. Dehning, some as George
Dehning, some as Hortense Dehning, as each one of them, as each one
of them then knew her in their living, in her living. I certainly
do know Julia Dehning. How do I know Julia Dehning '? I know Julia
Dehning as a kind of a one, as one of a kind in men and women. I
know Julia Dehning having her being in her in her living. I know
Julia Dehning being certain that she was a really living one. I
know Julia Dehning being certain in being living. Yes I do know
Julia Dehning. I certainly can say I do know Julia Dehning. Julia
Dehning was one having being in her all her living and being quite
an important one in living. Julia Dehning came to marry Alfred
Hersland, that is certain. Julia Dehning was one always being one
having completely courage for living in being one having completely
living being in resisting being one having changing from
sensitiveness in ways of attacking, in having changing from
hearing, seeing, feeling anything in the attacking being in
her.</p>

<p>I am remembering, really I never do forget one having being in
her, attacking being in her and always to every one this one was
one not having attacking in her but resisting being in her because
this one had this being in her as being so like, soft not set jelly
in her that this one was one by her skin cutting her off from any
other one and this one had attacking being that never did more than
just wobble in her and any one moving at her was sticking in this
being in her and so she was to every one a resisting one but really
this one was of the attacking kind in men and women. Now I was
telling how Martha Hersland had attacking being that was in her
indeterminate nervous excitement inside her. Now I am telling of
Julia Dehning that she was one having complete resisting to any
changing in her attacking, as stubbornness then to mostly every one
realising this in her in her living, and was one not having really
sense for living, one having really courage always in living, being
one that needed everything for anything can feed her and now I
certainly understand the relation in being between her and these
two I have been just rehearsing as being and I am certainly certain
I am certainly knowing being in Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>I wish every one was feeling being the way I am telling it now
in my writing and that not any one could understand it without
hearing me tell it as I am now doing. I could like that very well I
think now when I am not remembering listening, when I am not
remembering loving everything, loving being and repeating in even
one. I think it would be so very nice if every one knew how
completely it is a necessary thing to realise being the way I am
realising being, and then I am explaining this thing, and then I am
being one really explaining everything. I really do like being in
every one and so I am very happy even with not every one really
realising the important thing that I can explain being in every
one, with hardly any one realising this thing. I am telling now the
history of the living in Julia Dehning, a description of the being
in Julia Dehning, and what I know of her being, what many know of
being in her in her living.</p>

<p>I am thinking about how any one feels anything, learns anything.
I am thinking about Julia Dehning. I am thinking about dependent
and independent being, dependent independent, independent dependent
being.</p>

<p>I am thinking about attacking being. I am thinking about how the
attacking kind in men and women react to anything, I am thinking
about the way they have sensitiveness in them. I am thinking about
how I am going to be telling about the being in them, the attacking
kind in men and women. I have been describing some of the attacking
kind in men and women. I must now I am thinking tell about being in
some more of them.</p>

<p>I am knowing very well, I am knowing very many men and women
having attacking being in them, independent dependent being. I am
feeling some of them. I am realising many of them. Now I have it as
something I am doing, describing being in the independent dependent
kind, the attacking kind in men and women.</p>

<p>Sensitiveness to anything, to something in any kind or the
attacking kind in men and women, the independent dependent kind in
men and women is something I am now beginning describing. I know
certainly in daily living sensitiveness in the attacking kind in
men and women in independent dependent kind in men and women. I can
certainly know what I am meaning by sensitiveness in them, I am now
beginning giving what is in me as realising sensitiveness in being
and independent dependent kind in men and women.</p>

<p>Sensitiveness is in men and women of the independent dependent
kind in men and women, in those having it that they can have it in
them that reaction is complete and poignant and quick in them so
that they can have emotion as poignant in them as a sensation. This
is in a way the foundation of my explanation. I am beginning again
telling everything.</p>

<p>How has any one sensitiveness in living? They have it in them as
their way of being. Now let me see, I who am realising now
sensitive being in the attacking kind of them, let me see if I can
say this thing now in the time I am living. Each one I have been
knowing having attacking being, having their kind of sensitiveness
in them is remaining in my feeling, they are crowding now in my
feeling, they all have it in them to have sensitive being of the
attacking kind of being of the independent dependent kind of being
in them. They have then sensitive being some of them of independent
kind of independent dependent being, they have sensitive being in
them some of them of dependent kind of the independent dependent
kind of being. Some have sensitiveness in them that makes of them
that they are to themselves and to every one possessed by each one
ever coming near to them. Some have with this kind of sensitiveness
in them emotion, some passion, some practical desiring, some fear,
some depression, some exaltation, these then are such having it in
them that they are completely and always responding to any one
coming near to them in the way of sensitiveness of complete
reaction of realisation of the being of some one being near them.
Some as I am saying have this with passion, some with emotion, some
with intention, some with desperation, some with much lying, some
with conviction, some with religion, many with feeling of knowing
everything coming to be happening, some have it thickly in them,
some thinly in them, some with much independent attacking, some
with almost not any attacking, some with gladness in them, some
with the desire of being an important one in living. These then
have it in them that sensitiveness is complete and always in them
to everything coming near them, it may be thick or thin, or stupid
or dull or timid or aggressive in them, or fairly intelligent in
them. These are then many of them very full of wanting always
having new things in religion. These are very often having it in
them to be very interesting to quite a number knowing them, Some
are very sweet with this thing, some are very gentle with this
thing, some are wanting to make money, or position or win something
for some one with this thing. Mostly these then are not really
succeeding in living. Some have with this thing sense for living in
them, mostly they have not in them most of such of them very much
sense for living in them. These then are not those having
sensitiveness in them to mystic religion as being really in them.
Those wanting to have mystic religion in them those of the
attacking kind of them are those having it in them to be attacking
complete emotion to be in that thing. Such have it in them to have
complete sensitiveness in them to something they are realising as a
complete thing to be attacking by a complete effort of being in
that thing by the attacking by them of that thing. Such as these
have it in them mostly not to have poignant passion in them but
complete attacking in them and very many of them have not attacking
in them only for religion, they have it for pure reason, for pure
affection, for much succeeding in living, and mostly these then too
very many of them though being very successful indeed in living
have not really in them much sense for living. I know a whole lot
of these in living. I hope I will be seeing that I am rightly
realising the being in them and that it is as I have been
describing and as I will be going on sometime describing.</p>

<p>Now there are some having attacking being in them having
sensitiveness in them as passion in them and these can have it in
them to be successful, to be failing in living, to be wise or
foolish in living, to have sense for living, to have not too much
sense for living, to have much, to have little sensitiveness in
them, to have it thinly, thickly, intermittently in them, to be
using it in every way in living, to have it very delicately in
them, to have it fairly coarsely in them, but mostly these having
it in them although they may be succeeding although they may be
failing, are not really without some sense for living in them. They
can be anything, some practical, some religious, some earnest, some
careless, some ambitious, some critical, some very weak in living,
some very intermittent in doing anything, all having passion in
them as sensitive being.</p>

<p>Then there are some having attacking being as sensitive being as
emotion in them, these can be quite melancholy often in living,
these can be quite aggressive in living and to every one can be
content and energetic in living, and self-satisfying and these can
have it in them that they have trouble in having it as being that
sensitiveness is in them as emotion, they can have it that they
have not in them any power of resisting when they have it not in
them to be practical in living. I know now some of such of them. I
will certainly sometime tell more of such of them. Two of such of
them are just now in my feeling every minute in my living.</p>

<p>Then there are some having attacking being that have
sensitiveness in them as being really excitement inside but mostly
these then do not have it in them to have sensitiveness really in
them. Perhaps they have spots of sensitiveness in them, times for
sensitiveness in them.</p>

<p>Now I will begin telling a little about how some come to learn
or not learn in living. Always I am telling of the attacking kind
in men and women. Always now I will be keeping on telling of the
attacking kind in men and women until I have given a good
description a really good description of Julia Dehning and what
every one who knew Julia in living thought about the being she had
in her all her living.</p>

<p>Surely every one has a way of learning something. This is now to
be very little description of how some connected in being with
Julia Dehning learn what they do learn in living, this then is
connected with sensitiveness in them as is of course a natural
thing as any one ever thinking about learning can certainly be
understanding.</p>

<p>I am now understanding all the ways the attacking kind in men
and women have sensitiveness in them. I am feeling some having
attacking being in them having sensitiveness in them and I am not
understanding what way sensitiveness is in them.</p>

<p>I have been seeing some, I have been knowing some some, I have
been hearing about some having attacking being in them and I am not
realising of them the way sensitiveness is in them. I have not been
loving any of this kind in men and women, I would like to be loving
some one some, of this kind in men and women, I would like to be
knowing certainly the way sensitiveness is in them in this kind of
the attacking kind in women and men. I am feeling some one of this
kind in men and women. I know some thing of the character in them,
something of the way they do some things in living, but they are a
kind of them that are really different from these kinds I have been
describing. I will not now be telling my troubles to every one. It
is enough that I have been saying that I am not understanding all
the ways sensitiveness is in the attacking kind in men and
women.</p>

<p>I am realising some sensitiveness in some who have attacking
being in them. Soon I will tell complete histories of each one
having sensitive being in them. That will certainly be helping to
make a long book interesting. I could tell it very completely now
of some. I will not just now be beginning this thing. I am
certainly now writing a history of being in Julia Dehning being
living. As I was saying some having attacking being in them, having
independent dependent being in them have it in them to have
sensitiveness in them as passion in them. I was telling about one
having attacking being and having it as wobbling, having it as
being in this one as a soft jelly mass making of this one an
individual one by the skin of this one separating this one from any
other one. I have been telling about attacking being in Martha
Hersland, in Mr. David Hersland in Redfern. I have been telling
something of attacking being in some others because I was telling
then about such other ones. I am remembering pretty completely
everything I have been telling. I am always thinking I am not
remembering what I am going to be telling what I have been telling
but really I am remembering pretty well what I have been telling,
what I am telling, what I am going to be telling. Now I am telling
about some ways of having sensitiveness and learning in some having
attacking being, independent dependent being in them.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning as I have been saying was always resisting
changing the attacking way she had had, was having, would be having
all her living. As I was saying she had not really then sense for
living. As I was saying she was not really an unsuccessful one in
living. As I was saying Mrs. Dehning was stupid in attacking when
she was attacking and not for any winning. This was in her always
in her daily living. As I was saying Mrs. Dehning had some sense
for living. As I was saying she was an important enough one in
daily living.</p>

<p>There are very many who are wanting to be learning in their
living. Some as I have been saying of Julia Dehning are wanting
anything because they are feeling that anything can feed them. Some
something like Julia Dehning can feel having teaching, some
something like Julia Dehning can feel a little the thing some one
has been teaching them, some something like Julia Dehning can be
feeling giving teaching, some something like Julia Dehning are
every minute feeling teaching to them feeling teaching from them,
either feeling teaching being given to them or being given by them,
always then feeling teaching, always then feeling teaching being
given, this is very common with many having in them not really any
sensitiveness to the teaching itself that has been given, that they
are giving. To begin again. There are many having sensitiveness in
them to some one teaching, to there being one teaching some one, to
their teaching some one and have in them the very least possible
sensitiveness to the teaching that is being taught then. This is
very common. Some have not any in them sensitiveness to the thing
taught by any one and these have it in them to have really
sensitiveness to there being teaching done to them, by them, to
some one, by some one. Now this is certainly quite common and this
is bringing this writing always nearer to Julia Dehning. As I was
saying Julia needed anything because in her feeling in her being
everything could be feeding her in living. Now as I was saying
Julia had being that was one resisting, being stupid in resisting
anything that could be touching her in relation to her always being
in her way persisting in attacking. Really then Julia had not in
her any way of learning anything. Really she had it in her that she
was being an excited one in seizing everything, seizing anything to
learn that thing and always then she had it in her being that she
was a stupid one in not being able to not be a resisting one in a
stubborn way to anything teaching her in any way to be an attacking
one. This then is being in her and as any one can see it would make
of her one not having really sense for living, one having not
necessarily failing in living, one being one interesting to some,
one being one certainly in a way having courage in living. As I was
saying she was of the attacking, of the independent dependent kind
in women and men. She had dependent being in her of the independent
dependent kind of being but this really was in her only when rarely
it did happen to her some one did tell her she had not really any
way of learning in her. Then she had it in her as the dependent
independent dependent attacking kind in women and men have it in
them, she had it in her to be certain that not the last end of a
bad thing could happen to her and then surely some one did have it
to be certain that she certainly could learn something and so then
she had it in her this not as a religion but she had in her then
the certain feeling of right conviction. And see then every one
reading this thing that this one Julia Dehning had conviction in
her that she was one to be an attacking one resisting any one
changing any attacking in her being and she was one seizing being
one learning and always then really she could not be learning
anything. It is a clear thing then that she had not in her anything
of religion. It is certainly a clear thing this thing that she did
not have in her with dependent independent dependent being in her
anything in her of religion, she could and did and would have and
mostly must have conviction, she must be having the sensation of
certain feeling to be going on attacking, having courage really in
all of her living. She was completely then a stupid one in being a
resisting one resisting any changing in her being in a way an
attacking one having courage in living. She had then certainly not
sense for living. She was then certainly in living not one failing
in living. She was one seizing being one learning anything,
learning everything, she was one feeling being one needing
anything, needing everything because not anything was teaching
anything in her being. She was one seizing anything that was
teaching because she was one having it in her feeling that
everything was feeding her in living. She had courage in living,
she had not sense for living, she had dependent being in her being
of the independent dependent kind as I have been saying, she was
not really failing not really succeeding in living. She was one
quite interesting to some, quite unpleasant to some, quite
irritating to some, quite stimulating to some, quite stupid to
some, quite unusually bright to some, quite loving and pathetic to
some, quite cold and self-seeking to some, entirely generous and
courageous to some, quite failing in really attacking to some,
quite entirely honest to some, quite failing in being honest in
knowing that sometimes she was lying to some, quite earnest and
sensitive to teaching to some, quite impenetrable to anything to
some, quite really nice to quite a number knowing her in living,
quite open-minded to some, quite completely obstinate to some,
quite nervous and fairly excited to every one. This is to be now a
history of living in her, of being in her, of what each one knowing
her felt in her, what those living with her felt about her, how one
can know her, how one can come to know any one, of being in every
one.</p>

<p>This then is certain, feeling that there is and was and will be
teaching being given always every day to some one by some, to every
one by every one is very much in very many moral feeling,
completely moral feeling, completely moral conviction. This is very
often in very many not having any feeling in them for anything any
one is learning any one is or can he teaching. There being teaching
always being given makes of living a moral operation to very many
living. Julia Dehning as I was saying was completely needing
feeling that always in all daily living teaching was being given by
some one by a good many of mostly everything. She was needing
learning learning everything for anything could be a food to her
that she could have as learning. She had then certainly from this
thing completely a moral conviction. She did this needing learning
from being one needing to be going on living. This is in very many
women in very many men, in pretty nearly ever so many women and
men. Teaching then being existing is being existing as being in
moral being in very many pretty nearly a very great many men and
women.</p>

<p>Some are feeling each thing they are liking and are not learning
anything in living. Some of these have religion in them, some of
these have themselves inside them to them as all being in them,
some of such of them are completely loving some one. Many are
feeling everything in living are not learning anything in living, I
know very well one of these in my living and this one has complete
feeling of each thing and this one is delicately vibrating and
completely loving something and not having any religion, not any
moral feeling, not any interest, in any opinion. I know by reading
and by hearing of two having it in them that they are completely
feeling everything, each thing and are not learning anything in
living. These have religion in them, these are certain that the
having so much feeling in them with each thing is meaning that they
are realising that a god is loving them. I know one and that one is
in a way like Julia Dehning and this one is feeling each thing in
living and not learning anything and always having a conviction
that it is a necessary thing that this one is learning everything
so that this one can be having meaning in living and this one has
moral conviction. This one needs it that every one is learning
everything. I know one who is in living living in her being and
completely living with her being and this one is feeling everything
and not learning anything in living and this one is needing feeling
everything in living and not learning anything in living to make it
for herself a complete thing that she is living with her being.
Some who are feeling everything feeling anything in living have a
little a very little power of realising each thing they are
feeling, these could learn something in living if each thing was
not succeeding another thing. Some of these can come to learn
something in living. Some can learn something in their living,
Julia Dehning in a way was not such a one. These I have just been
describing are some with attacking being in them who are not
learning, not succeeding, not necessarily tailing in living, some
of such of them are quite important to a number knowing them in
living. They are not really important in living. They have not
really sense for living. I am going now again to commence my
regular description of being in Julia Dehning, of Dehning family
living, of Julia's meeting and marrying and loving and not
learning, and not enduring Alfred Hersland, and of her complete
living. I am beginning again, not from the beginning this time that
is certain.</p>

<p>The Dehning family as I was saying were living quite completely
pleasantly very rich right American living. They were living this
in a free way, in a quite generous way, in a completely pleasant
way in a fairly energetic way, in a quite successful way, in a
fairly gay way, in a quite spirited way, in a fairly peaceful way,
in not an ambitious way, in a quite fairly simple way, in a quite
thoroughly completely easily pleasant fairly happy reasonably
contenting and contented way. Family living is a thing a family in
a way is realising. Sometimes a family is not at all realising that
thing. Mostly a family is in a way knowing the kind of family
living they have in them. Sometimes it is a queer thing to have
them telling family living. Sometimes it is a very funny thing when
some are explaining a family living, sometimes it is a foolish
thing, sometimes an irritating thing, very often a quite tedious
thing. Family living is a peculiar thing because not any one,
mostly, is deciding family living and always each one is himself or
herself inside her or him and family living is in a way a
combination that in a way is not coming from any one. Sometimes it
is coming from some one, sometimes it is a combination thing,
sometimes it just happens to be existing. As I am saying the
Dehnings had family living in them that was not really expressing
Mr. Dehning or Mrs. Dehning or in a way the two together nor in a
way the three children. Really one knowing each one of them would
be thinking family living would have been a different thing in them
from what it really was in them. Really I suppose certainly it was
a combination of being in Mr. Dehning and Mrs. Dehning and the
three children.</p>

<p>Family living is a pleasant thing when each one likes to be
hearing some telling about what each one likes to be doing in
living. Family living when not any one is liking to be listening to
what another one is liking in living is not at all a pleasant
thing. It is a very difficult thing, for very many, to keep on
being one liking to be hearing about what another one in the family
is liking in living. So then family living comes to be not any
longer existing and sometimes then it is a very troublesome thing.
In the Dehning family living they kept on all of them for a really
very longtime of living being ready to be listening to what each
one liked in living, needed in living, had in living. Dehning
family living as I was saying was quite completely a long time a
quite pleasant thing. Julia was not really perhaps listening enough
to Mrs. Dehning having living to make it later a completely
pleasant living but Julia was listening to all the other ones and
all the other ones could listen to all the other ones telling about
living in them and so really Dehning family living was really
pretty nearly a completely pleasant thing.</p>

<p>It certainly is quite entirely a difficult thing to keep on a
long time with several living in a house together, a family to go
on really listening to what each one is telling, to what each one
is needing, having for living. Each one can find it a more or a
less difficult thing. Mostly each one sometime commences to be
doing less of this thing in family living as they come to be in
middle living. As I was saying Mr. Dehning liked it in him to be
listening to any one wanting to be doing anything. He was a
completely good man in family living, in doing all living he had in
him. Each one of the Dehning family was quite good for Dehning
family living.</p>

<p>As I was saying Mr. Dehning liked it inside him that he was
ready to be listening to any one wanting to do something. This was
in a way pleasant being of important feeling in him. Mrs. Dehning
was not listening when Julia was marrying Alfred Hersland. In a way
though she was listening. Later George and Hortense Dehning were
feeling very much listening inside them. Julia Dehning was not then
making Dehning family living, she was a little then leading to her
mother's feeling who was one having it in her feeling that she was
one leading in attacking. Not that really in a way either Mrs.
Dehning or Julia Dehning were making family living, or really
leading Dehning family living, they really each one, Mrs. Dehning
earlier, Julia Dehning later, were giving their own feeling of
being one needing succeeding in having something in living as a
stamp on Dehning family living. They were neither of them ones
having a needing of attacking for winning, they neither of them had
really much ambition in them, they really had it in them to be
needing to be succeeding in having something that would be for them
a stamping by them of Dehning family living. Each one of them had
in them their own being of which I have been already giving some
description. Mrs. Dehning had some sense for living, Julia Dehning
had not really sense for living. Each one of them was quite
important as living. Mrs. Dehning was one quite succeeding in
living. Julia was one succeeding in living, failing too in living.
Mrs. Dehning was one not really failing in living. The Dehning
family living is then something I am describing. Julia Dehning and
Alfred Hersland came to be married ones, I am describing this
thing.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning was one learning in living. Really he was not one
coming to have more and more sense for living. He had certainly in
his early and middle living very much sense for living, he always
all his living had sense for living.</p>

<p>He was in Dehning family living. Mr. Dehning, Mrs. Dehning,
Julia, George and Hortense Dehning were in Dehning family living.
Julia came to marrying in the beginning of the ending of middle,
living in Mr. and Mrs. Dehning. Mrs. Dehning had sense for living,
neither more nor less all of her living, Mrs. Dehning could be
learning in living. Mr. Dehning was a little coming to be in him an
important one from being one listening to any one wanting to be
doing anything. Julia began her living by attacking to be marrying
Alfred Hersland attacking in family living. As I was saying Julia
was one not really winning, she was really doing what she was
feeling she was needing to be going on being one living. She was
really then keeping on being in family living although she was
attacking to be living in marrying Alfred Hersland. That is history
of living in her, that will be always what I am telling of being in
her being living.</p>

<p>Julia had not the emotion of ambition, she had not ambition in
her as emotion, she had it in her, ambition, as attacking and not
for winning, she had some intention of ambition, not very much but
some, she had ambition in being one resisting any changing in
attacking being in her. Alfred Hersland had ambition in emotion, he
had ambition in intention, he had not so much ambition in being one
having resisting engulfing being. It is a thing that is very
interesting that those having in them that ambition is not as
emotion in them have it that to very many knowing them they are
very sweet in living, very careless in living, very unworldly in
living, very unselfish in living. Some of such of them have
ambition in them as Julia Dehning had as I am saying. It is in a
way a nice thing to be one not having ambition as emotion for these
then knowing this thing of them can be doing what they are needing
in living and always they do not need to be holding back or ashamed
in them because they are not really self-seeking to any one,
knowing it in them that ambition is not an emotion in them. Alfred
Hersland had ambition as emotion in him, he had ambition as
intention in him, he had not ambition as acting as resisting
engulfing being in him and so then he was in a way failing in
living. He was not completely failing in living. Julia Dehning and
Alfred Hersland came to know each other and came to be married and
to living together and this is to be now a history of the living in
them. Julia was all her living in a way of Dehning family living.
As I was saying Mrs. Dehning, Julia Dehning was of Dehning family
living. They were not really making Dehning family living any more
than any one in the Dehning family living. They were in a way
always putting on themselves a stamp that was in a way from their
own being in being a part of Dehning family living. In a way they
were a little more exciting in being stamping in themselves for
themselves a way of being part of Dehning family living, a little
more exciting than Mr. Dehning or George or Hortense Dehning.
Really as I was saying of them they were not actually very
exciting, really then, as Mrs. Dehning was not really exciting in
harsh attacking as she had not then feeling of being winning she
was not then winning anything, she was one in any feeling and Julia
Dehning who as I was saying had not really sense for living was not
winning in being one resisting any changing in her being in one way
in attacking living, in not learning anything in living. So then
really not any one of the Dehning family were really exciting, they
were each one of them reasonably important in living, they were
really not at all exciting. The Dehning family each one were
certain as being much more exciting. The Dehning family were living
very well very rich American living. This is to be now more history
of each one of them.</p>

<p>The Dehning family living was successful living for all of them,
all five of them, the Dehning family living was a successful,
generous, pleasant, reasonably important very rich American living.
Quite generous, quite pleasant, quite reasonably a successful very
rich right American living, almost a completely American living,
always fairly excited, sometimes fairly profoundly agitated, mostly
always fairly pleasant fairly generous, very completely each one
having anything they could be needing, quite simple in emotion,
country house and city living.</p>

<p>It was a reasonably important living, the Dehning family living,
each one of them were reasonably important each one of them in
their living. As I am saving they were mostly all of them fairly
excited with living, all of them certainly living in living, as I
was just saying not really so very exciting in being. There is to
be more description of them.</p>

<p>It is very hard for any one to tell in any other one how much
that one is loving another one. It is very difficult to tell it
about any one how much loving they can have they do have in them.
It is difficult to know of any one what kind of loving they have in
them, certainly it is difficult to know that in any one, it
certainly is very difficult to tell it of any one at any time how
much of their loving they have in them, they can have in them, how
much loving there is in them of their kind of loving for any
one.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland and Julia Dehning came together, they certainly
came to marrying. It was very difficult to tell in either of them
how much of their kind of loving they had then in them for the
other of the two of them.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning as I have been saying was of the attacking kind in
men and women. Alfred Hersland as I have been saying again and
again was of the engulfing resisting kind in men and women. Julia
Dehning certainly could have some loving in her for some one, Julia
was in Dehning family living, she was certainly one to have some
loving in her for some in living, she certainly was having loving
in her then for Alfred Hersland. Alfred Hersland as I was saying
had not really any living that was important to him until he came
to loving one and wanting to stop studying so that he could
immediately marry that one and then a little later he did not want
to be loving. That was the first thing important to him in living
as I was saying. He had aspiring being in him as I was saying of
him. He came to loving and marrying Julia Dehning. He had loving in
him for her then, in a way he always had some loving in him for
some one. They both then Julia Dehning and Alfred Hersland had it
in them to have some loving for some one, for the other one, for
some, in them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dehning as I was saying had some sense for living. Julia
was important enough in living, was not really failing in living,
was really quite important as living, was really one very
courageously completely living her living, was fairly attacking,
was one not having really sense for living. Did Alfred Hersland
have sense for living, any sense for living, I am not quite
certain, I think he had a little sense for living, not so much as
he was one being stupid in aspiration, in ambition, as he was an
engulfing resisting one not really resisting, not really engulfing,
but perhaps he had a very little bit of sense for living, else he
probably would have been completely failing in living, a little
sense for living came to be in a way in him and then he was again a
loving one and then he was failing but not really completely
failing in living. He was then even almost succeeding in
living.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning and Alfred Hersland then when they were marrying
each other did certainly have loving in them each one of them for
the other one. I have already told about their coming to be needing
to have each other for living and loving. They did certainly come
to marrying. They did certainly succeed in not succeeding in their
married living. This is to be now some description of loving being
in each one of the two of them and of their marrying and of their
married living. The description of the loving being in Julia
Dehning and then in Alfred Hersland and the relation in Julia of
her being loving to family living, the loving being in Julia and
the stupid being in her and the family living to her, and then more
loving being in her.</p>

<p>It is very difficult in quarrelling to be certain in either one
what the other one is remembering. It is very often astonishing to
each one quarrelling to find out what the other one was remembering
for quarrelling. Mostly in quarreling not any one is finding out
what the other one is remembering for quarrelling, what the other
one is remembering from quarrelling.</p>

<p>I have been telling something about living in men and women
having resisting being in them, having engulfing resisting being in
them. Some of such of them have quite a good deal of loving in
them, some of such of them have more loving in them than they can
feel in them some have less loving in them than they are believing
they have in them, not having it in them to have emotion poignant
like a sensation as those having attacking being have it in them.
Some having resisting being having attacking in them to keep
themselves from having to be resisting being very dependent of the
dependent independent kind of them say they are having very much
loving, they may have very much loving in them, say they have very
little loving in them, they may have very little loving in them.
Those having engulfing being may have very much, a little or quite
some loving in them. These sometimes have very much more loving
feeling in them than at other times in their living, some of them.
These may tell that they have very much loving feeling in them with
conviction, they may tell that they have little loving feeling in
them with conviction.</p>

<p>Those having attacking have it as I am saying to have emotion
having in them the poignancy of a sensation. Some having attacking
being can certainly have this very dully in them. Many can have it
in them that they are telling about having it very much in them,
some of such of them have it very much in them and some of such of
them just have it some in them. Some of the attacking kind of them
can be very excited about telling it about themselves, sometimes
very often, and some of such of them certainly have it very lively
in them, some have it quite deadened in them. Some can have very
much emotion in telling about it to themselves and every one and
they have quite a great deal of it really in them, some have it
very much in them in telling of it and it is in them that they have
it really in them, yes they certainly have it really in them only
it does not make them do what they think it will, it does, it did
make them do in living. Some have a great deal of it in them but it
is not active in them but I will not tell all the ways I can think
of that those having attacking being have emotion in them. Some as
I am saying of the attacking kind in men and women are very much
excited always in being, in living in any living, in being one
being living. Some of such of them have very much emotion in them,
some not so much, some quite a bit, some really very little in
them. Some of such of them have it in them that they are not having
emotion with the excitement of being in living in them, they have
emotion in them. Some are all their living, some of such as these I
am describing, some are all their living having been having really
one fairly large emotion and are resisting any changing in them of
this emotion in them and are very excited in living from being
excited ones and stubborn ones in living. Some of such of them have
sense for living, some of such of them have not sense for living.
Some of such are very stupid ones in being, some of such of them
are quite sensitive in being. Julia Dehning was of the kind having
one emotion all her living and not being ever changing, and being
stubborn in resisting and excited in being living, and not
sensitive in being and not having sense for living. This is to be
now more description of loving and marrying and quarrelling and
family living. When some one having been feeling all their living
one way of feeling living comes to be feeling in them another way
of feeling living, that is disturbing to them. Sometimes then one
is from that time on a more or less sick one. Sometimes some one
likes this in them. Sometimes they do not like it in them.
Sometimes some one has all their living been doing something and
having for doing that thing excited feeling in them and then some
one does that thing for them with not any excitement in that one
and then the other one is left with not any excited feeling and
that is sometimes a pleasant thing and sometimes a completely
distressing thing. Some never can lose excitement out of them not
with any one's showing them. Julia Dehning always had an excited
way of being needing anything and as I was saying she had really
loving being all her living and as I was saying that was not
exciting in her really, not very exciting and always she was
stubbornly resisting being any different in attacking by her
being.</p>

<p>Julia and Alfred and Dehning family living and loving and
learning and quarrelling. Some know of themselves in their
dressing, in their daily living in everything what they are and
what they are wanting from every one, from any one. Some know what
they are wanting but they do not have it in them in their daily
living, in their dressing to show it to any one. Some can show it
while they are with some who have the same being in them and then
later when they are left alone cannot really be remembering what it
is they wanted to be to show to any one, to every one. Some know
what they want to be and can build it up by little pieces and do
again and again. Some know what they are and see it as a complete
thing and make that thing in daily living. Some know what they are
and are always cutting and fitting and fitting and cutting and
painting and sometime they come to be that thing in dressing and
daily living and then they can lose that thing. Some cannot see the
thing they are in daily living and in dressing nor what they want
to be in daily living and in dressing. Some see what they want to
be in daily living and in dressing and then they are a little less
than that thing so that they will not be queer to any one. Some
have really the feeling of inventing themselves in daily living and
in dressing, some are really doing this thing, some are feeling
themselves doing this thing. I will tell more about this thing.
Julia Dehning as I was saying was all her living after she was
herself to herself in living wanting to be creating living in
learning everything in daily living, furnishing, dress-making,
decoration, cleaning herself and everything, resting, reading,
being a good one, being a useful one. She was doing this then and
she came to loving Alfred Hersland. She was doing this thing, she
was as I was saying one not having really any way of feeling in
learning. She came to loving and marrying Alfred Hersland. She had
loving being in her, she had Dehning family living in her
feeling.</p>

<p>One knows what effect that one wants to produce to that one, to
any one, in that one existing, in the daily living that one has for
living. That one does not feel that one as a finished thing, that
one works from something that one is knowing pretty quickly to
something that one has been not really knowing and then that comes
to be to that one a known thing and then that one sticks there in
that thing. That one does not want to be conspicuous in living but
does want to be intelligent and elegant. This then is a personal
ideal, that that that one has for daily living and so this one has
feeling of being always creating all the daily living, the being in
that one, really that one is going from something that one has been
knowing to something that one has not quite been certainly knowing
and sticks there in that thing.</p>

<p>Another one needs to be for living what that one is certain any
one like that one is in being and in living. That one can be that
in living when there are others realising what that one being that
kind of a one is in living, when others being that kind in living
are with that one in daily living. This one needs these then for
being what this one is certain any one being like this one is in
daily living. This one when this one is not being kept in living
being by others being what this one is certain this one is being in
living, by others being certain that this one is in living what
this one is certain any one like this one is in living, loses the
grasp really on what is what this one is certain any one like this
one is in daily living. Another one never loses realising what it
is that this one is certain is being in this one and always this
one is building it up by little pieces. This one never comes to be
a completer one. Very often this one is a vague and stupid one and
not really being in living and so then always this one keeps a
little pile by always adding to make this one what this one is
certain from what this one and every one expects of this one this
one is in daily living. Some see themselves as a whole one and they
cut and add boldly to make themselves the whole one. Some slowly
possess it, some never know what it is and never possess it, some
only know what is not it when they see themselves not it in daily
living. Julia Dehning was one having certainly a needing of being
learning everything. Julia was in a way not feeling in learning
anything. Julia had loving being in her that is certain. She was
certain of having honesty for living as every one having Dehning
family living have in them. She was certain of having courage for
living. This thing she had in her in daily living, this she could
not ever have in her as developing. It was in her that was certain,
she had attacking being in her that was this thing in her, she had
attacking being in her that was being needing learning anything.
She had it in her to be completely stubbornly actively passively
resisting any changing of the attacking being in her, she had then
not really sense for living, as any one can know now by a little
feeling being in her. She was not really failing in living, she was
not really succeeding in living, she was lighting very well always
for her being one living, being honestly a courageous one, being
one needing to be learning everything. She had very much active
nervous being in her. She had excitement in being one doing her
daily living in living. She had really passion in her but not
enough to make it right that she should have so much stubbornness
in her of not changing her attacking, not enough to make it right
that she should be such a nervous one in daily living, should be
one so excited in learning anything. I will begin again now with a
description of Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning came to be married to Alfred. They were not very
successful one with the other in married living. It is certain that
each one in quarrelling is remembering a different thing for
quarrelling. This is to be now more description of daily living in
Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>Julia and Alfred each one in daily living, aspiration, ambition,
taste, feeling, moral being, quarrelling, family living.</p>

<p>I am describing what is to me a beautiful thing, learning being
in women and in men. Every little bit, every single bit of learning
being in women and men is to me a beautiful thing. I am telling
always about what is to me a beautiful thing, that is learning
being in women and in men. A very little bit I am ever learning is
to me a beautiful thing. Learning being in women and in men is to
me really a completely beautiful thing. Every bit of repeating I am
doing while I am learning being in women and in men is to me a
completely really beautiful thing. Being one learning being in
women and in men ought then to be always making me a very happy
one. I am always learning being in women and in men. I am sometimes
quite a melancholy one.</p>

<p>I have learnt pretty completely being in Julia Dehning. I am
remembering now being in Julia Dehning. I am realising now being in
Julia Dehning. I am feeling now more realisation of being in Julia
Dehning by always more realising the connection between being in
her and being in women and in men who have the same kind of being
more or less in them. Julia Dehning was quite an important person
in being a person being living.</p>

<p>Really she was not failing in living, really she was not
succeeding in living, really she had much support and loving in
living, really she was quite an important one in being living,
really she had courage in being one being living, really she had
loving being in her, really she had a need in her that there would
be some there certain to be supporting, really she always had
support and loving in her living, really she was quite an important
one in living. Really she had much support and loving for living,
really she had courage in being one always being one living, really
she was one having courage to be going on being in living, really
she was one resisting and being one not feeling hearing seeing
anything that could be changing anything of attacking being she had
in living, she was one needing learning everything, needing
learning anything so that she would be using all her being living,
as she was not learning anything, for living attacking being which
was the being in her. So then she was not really defeated in being
living, she was not succeeding, not failing in living, she was
quite an important one in living, she had loving and support in her
living, she had not sense for living.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning was quite a sweet one to some, poignantly sweet
one and generous in living and having careless domination in living
and having thoughtlessness in being one needing everything and
having complete courage always in being one always being living, in
being one winning learning to be living. This was the feeling some
had all her living in Julia Dehning. Some had different feeling in
her living in her. Mostly every one had a feeling of courage for
being one needing living in her all of her living. Mostly every one
was feeling in her that she was needing to be feeling learning
everything because anything could feed her. Some had a certain
feeling that she was not ever learning anything in living. Some
were certain that she had really sense for living, some were
certain that she did not have in her at all sense for living, some
were never really certain about this thing about her. She was one
certainly having generous emotion in the sense that she was knowing
she was attacking in living to be winning what was not for herself
as a thing to be enjoying but what was needed so that she could be
one having honest living, having earnest learning living, having
Dehning family living. She was one that to herself and mostly every
one was completely living for honest living, for learning living,
for Dehning family living. Really she was not learning anything in
living, really she could never have the last courage of knowing
that sometime she was not honest in living, really she was needing
loving and support in Dehning family living. Really then it could
only come to any one as a slow thing to be realising that she had
not complete courage in being one living, that she had not sense
for living. So then she could have it really in her that it was
sweet and generous and aspiring for her to be as harsh as crude as
active as eager in attacking as she could have strength for it in
her being. And this was right for her to herself and to mostly any
one feeling loving being in her. This is true of very many having
attacking being in them and poignant and generous loving being in
them as complete being for them. This then was not stupid being in
her, stupid being in her was resisting having any changing in the
attacking being of her, having not any sensitiveness of being in
her from more living in her. This made of her one not learning
anything in living, having real then not sense for living. I will
tell more gradually about this thing.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland had ambition in him, Julia Dehning had ambition.
Not either one or the other of them as I was saying was really
failing in living, was really succeeding, had really sense for
living, was really defeated by living.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland had aspiration in living, had an aspiration to
be succeeding. Julia Dehning had aspiration in living, had
aspiration in being one learning and to be then completely living.
Alfred Hersland had failing in him had failing to be one succeeding
in something, Julia Dehning was then one not succeeding in being,
was one not really learning anything for living. It was then right
that they should have come to be two loving one another and then
coming to marrying and then coming to be not succeeding in married
living. Some have it right for them to be loving and marrying and
succeeding in married living, some have it right from the being in
them to be loving each other and marrying and not succeeding then
in having married living in them for those two of them together
then. Some have it to be right for them from the being in them to
be loving one another then and not then to be marrying. Some who
are loving one another do not have it really that it is right from
the being in them that they are loving for each other then. And
then it is right from being in some one that that one should love
some one, should not love some one, should be loved by some one,
should not be loved by some one. Anyway it certainly was alright
from the being in them that Alfred Hersland and Julia Dehning
should come to be loving one another and marrying and not
succeeding in their married living.</p>

<p>They were married then and they did not succeed in their married
living together then. They were each one of them not really
succeeding not really failing in their living.</p>

<p>Really it is a very difficult thing in living for some to be
certain that they are believing in loving, that they are believing
in being honest in living, that they are believing in any one being
a good one. It is so terribly mixed up and how does one know
living, loving, thinking, honest being, feeling, goodness in
living, and yet one is doing thinking, living, loving, honest
action, goodness in living, and some one else is being a good one,
an honest one, a loving one, a thinking one, a feeling one and
always then one is knowing everything in one and one is not
believing what one is knowing inside them and one is knowing what
is going on in them and one is not believing that thing and how
then is one really certain that loving and feeling and thinking and
goodness and honesty is in them and how is one not certain and what
is then the satisfaction of having been of being of going to be
being a living one and that one is not certain that loving that
thinking that honesty that goodness is something in them and that
one is not then certain. One is saying, of course he would do that
thing, he is a middle aged man and he needs to do that thing, he
needs to do that thing, yes I have a passion, I have a passion for
my children, yes he has a passion, he has a passion for his
reputation, he is a middle aged man and he has a chance to do that
thing, of course he will do that thing, why should he not do that
thing, it is honest for him a middle aged man to do that thing,
they need that thing or else they would not pay him to do that
thing, of course he is a loving man, of course he loves his
reputation, of course he is a middle aged man, of course he has
three years to make him a very rich man, of course he is an honest
man, of course he is a good man, I respect him, everybody respects
him, he loves his reputation, he has a very good reputation,
certainly some are loving, some are honest, some are good ones,
some are thinking in living, certainly some are certain of this
thing, certainly I am certain to be certain of this thing.</p>

<p>I am certain to be certain of the thing that some have loving in
them, that some have thinking in them, that some have honest action
in them, that some have goodness in them, that every one has being
in being living. I am certain to be certain of this thing with some
kind of meaning and I am not then going to be terribly in a twitter
in me about this thing. I am going to be certain of this thing, and
why not be certain of this thing why not be certain of this thing
as certain as of being being in every one having living as being in
them. I am going to be certain of this thing. I am going now to be
describing honesty and goodness and loving and thinking and living
in Julia Dehning and Alfred Hersland.</p>

<p>To some it is an encouraging thing a very encouraging thing that
mostly every one has plenty of courage in them for daily living. To
some it is a wonderful thing that not everything scares every one.
It is so easy for some to be scared by mostly everything, by every
little bit of daily living, it is a very fine thing, a fine fine
thing for such of them to be really certain that not everybody is
scared by everything. Very often some are living a long time in
living believing that every one is really scared by everything.
Some are not ever really believing that any one is scared by
everything. As I was saying it is certainly an encouraging thing to
some that some are certainly loving, some are certainly thinking,
some are certainly feeling, some are certainly honest ones, some
are certainly good ones. I have said that this is to be a
description of being in Julia Dehning and Alfred Hersland, I am
remembering this thing, that is certain.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning soon came to thinking that Alfred Hersland was not
an honest man. Julia Hersland soon came to be certain that Alfred
Hersland was not an honest one. Mr. Dehning was an honest enough
man in living. That is certain.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning and Alfred Hersland were married and commenced
being together for all of their daily living. Mr. Dehning came to
think that Alfred Hersland was not an honest enough man to have in
the Dehning family daily living. Julia Hersland was quite certain
that Alfred Hersland was not an honest enough one for any Dehning
family living. The Dehning family were certainly quite honest ones
for daily living. Alfred Hersland certainly was not quite such an
honest one in some of his dailyliving.</p>

<p>It is to some a quite difficult thing to be certain that they
have loving, that they have thinking, that they have feeling, that
they have honest daily living, that they have goodness in them. It
is not at all a difficult thing for some to be certain of
themselves in living, to be certain about other ones in living
whether they are loving, whether they are feeling, whether they are
honest ones, whether they are good ones, whether they are thinking
in all of their living. As I was saying Mr. Dehning came to be
thinking that Alfred Hersland was not an honest man enough for
Dehning family living. As I was saying Julia Hersland came to be
quite soon quite entirely certain that Alfred Hersland was not an
honest enough one to be having as one having with her all his daily
living. As I was saying Alfred Hersland was one really not failing
really not succeeding in living, he was one having some aspiration
for succeeding in living, he was one having engulfing resisting
being in him, he was one having some loving being in him, he was
one having some thinking in him, he was one certainly not going to
be honest enough in the Dehning family way of living.</p>

<p>They all of them had some loving feeling in them. Mr. Dehning,
Mrs. Dehning, Julia Hersland and Alfred Hersland. They each one of
them certainly could have some loving feeling in them. They each
one of them could have very little loving feeling in them. In
living Dehning family living each one had in them some loving
feeling. Alfred Hersland had some loving feeling in him. The
Dehning family living as I said before was very right very rich
American living quite pleasantly, quite generously, reasonably
honestly, reasonably lovingly, somewhat urgently existing. Julia
Hersland in married living was expecting different living from
Dehning family living, so she was thinking, she wanted a very much
more earnest and exciting American living than the Dehning family
living and always then it was certain that in her she was certain
that she had it in her to be really having Dehning family living as
every one reasonably good ones had it to have in them, Alfred
Hersland was not really then of Dehning family living, Julia was
really then always of Dehning family living. Mr. Dehning was then
fairly slowly quite certain that Alfred Hersand was not such a
reasonably honest one as Mr. Dehning needed for business living.
Julia Hersland had come fairly quickly to be certain that Alfred
Hersland was not the kind of a one she needed for fairly honest
daily living, Alfred Hersland was really not failing then, really
not succeeding then in living, Alfred Hersland had then important
feeling for being one aspiring to succeeding in living. Alfred
Hersland had then some loving feeling in him, that was not then to
him in him important feeling. Julia had then in living loving
feeling, that was then important feeling in her to her then. Mr.
Dehning had some loving feeling in him then, he always had some
loving feeling in him, this was always important to him in him.
Mrs. Dehning had some loving feeling in her, this was not important
then to her in her or really then to any one.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland was then not really succeeding not really
failing in living. Mr. Dehning as I said of him had it in him some
then, he had it in him all his living, he had it in him more and
more in his living to be listening to any one wanting to do
anything. He was quite entirely one listening to any one wanting to
do anything. Mostly in living he was a man quite certainly judging
that some men would do and some men would not do something and
always he had it in him to be listening to any one telling about
doing anything. Alfred Hersland as I was saying was married to
Julia Dehning. Alfred Hersland as I was saying was not really then
failing was not really then succeeding in living. Mr. Dehning was
an honest man. He surely was an honest enough man. The Dehning
family each one of them was certain sometime in her in him that
they were honest ones for living. The Dehning family surely each
one sometime were certain that they were honest enough for living.
They were each one sometime certain that they were really honest
ones in living each one sometime in her or in him. The time came
sometime to Julia Dehning when she was surely certain that she was
one honest in living.</p>

<p>It was easy for Julia Dehning to be certain sometime that she
was completely an honest one for living. It was never possible then
that she should not be certain that she was completely an honest
one for living. It was quite easy surely for Julia Dehning to be
certain that she was completely an honest one, that Dehning family
living was completely an honest enough one for any living. It was
quite certainly easy for Julia Hersland to be certain sometime that
she was one completely honest for daily living. It was certainly
then certain that she would be then all her living certain that she
was certainly a completely honest one for all daily living. She
could certainly be certain that Alfred Hersland was not a
completely honest one for daily living. Julia Hersland was then one
resisting all her living having in her any changing in being one
being one way of being an attacking one. In a way Julia Hersland
was succeeding, in a way Julia Hersland was not succeeding in
living.</p>

<p>Julia Hersland had some loving feeling in her, Alfred Hersland
had some loving feeling in him. Mr. Dehning had some loving feeling
in him, Mrs. Dehning had some loving feeling in her, George Dehning
had some loving feeling in him, Hortense Dehning had some loving
feeling in her. This is to be now histories of each one of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning was whatever any one thought him. Some are really
what mostly every one thinks such a one is in living. Mr. Dehning
was such a one. Mr. Dehning then in a way made Dehning family
living. Julia Hersland came to be certain that she was one having
Dehning family living as beginning of all being in her. As I said
she was one wanting to be learning anything, needing everything as
anything could feed her for her being one doing living. As I said
once in telling of her loving and marrying Alfred Hersland he was
one to her really doing learning in living. Always as I was saying
she was not doing any learning for living. As I was saying sometime
she came to be certain that she was a completely honest one for
living. This was in her all her living then as really every bit of
learning living in her living. She was one certain that she was an
honest one for all daily living. She was certain that Dehning
family living was honest enough for all daily living. She came to
be quite certain that Alfred Hersland was not honest enough for any
daily living. This was in her then sometime and always then she was
certain of this thing all the rest then of her living and as I was
saying she was one completely resisting any changing in the
attacking being that was really living in her. All her living then
too she was going on learning everything and always then really she
was one succeeding some, not succeeding some, more, sometime quite
failing in living. Really then as I was saying perhaps she had not
really at all sense for living. She married Alfred Hersland, she
came quite soon to be certain he was not honest really for any
daily living. She came to be quite certain then that she was a
completely honest one for daily living, that Dehning family living
was a completely honest one for family living. As I was saying she
had some loving being ill her, Alfred Hersland had some loving
being in him, Mr. Dehning had certainly some loving being in him,
Mrs. Dehning had some loving being, George Dehning had loving being
in him, Hortense Dehning had some loving being as being in her
living. This is to be now then again and again histories of all of
each one of them. Why should they not each one of them know it in
them that they each one of them had some loving feeling in them.
They did each one of them know it in them sometime that they had
some loving feeling in them, some of them were quite often certain
that they had some loving feeling in them, some of them were
certain that they had some loving feeling in them, each one of them
certainly sometime was certain that that one had some loving
feeling.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning, Julia Hersland certainly then had some loving
feeling in her and sometimes she was quite certain of this thing.
Alfred Hersland certainly had some loving feeling in him and very
often he was certain of it being there in him. Mr. Dehning had
certainly some loving feeling in him and certainly it was a simple
thing for him to be mostly always certain of this thing. Mrs.
Dehning had certainly some loving feeling and she certainly
sometimes was quite entirely certain of this thing. George Dehning
had certainly some loving feeling in him and he certainly was
really quite often certain of this thing. Hortense Dehning had some
loving feeling in her in all her living and she was fairly certain
of this thing. This then is a true thing that each one of them
Julia Hersland and Alfred Hersland and Mr. Dehning and Mrs. Dehning
and George Dehning and Hortense Dehning had some loving being in
her or in him.</p>

<p>There was then Dehning family living. Julia Hersland had been of
Dehning family living. She had been needing learning anything, all
her living she was needing learning everything as anything could
feed her for being one wanting to be living. She came to loving and
marrying Alfred Hersland. This is an interesting thing to some.
This has been quite an interesting thing to some. The being in
Julia Hersland, the loving being, the living being in her is an
interesting thing to some. She was then as I was saying one having
independent dependent being in living. This is a history of her and
of every one.</p>

<p>I am beginning more and more to feel being in young girls, in
young women. I am beginning more and more to know the being they
have in them. I do not yet know the being in all of them, I do not
yet know all the being in all of them. I see one kind of them that
I do not know at all as being and I see that kind of them again and
again, I see again and again one and another of that kind of them.
I do not know at all the being in them, in any of that kind of
them. I know then now always very much always more and more the
being in women, the being in them when they are young girls coming
to be going to be young women. I know always more and more what men
are coming to be doing in their living, I do not know very much
more now of the being of men when they are young boys coming to be
going to be men. I certainly do now know very much more of the way
being is in young girls in their living. I certainly do know quite
a good deal of this thing and it is a very pleasant thing in me to
be more and more knowing this thing. Why is it a pleasant thing in
me to me to be more and more knowing this thing. It is a pleasant
thing in me to me to be knowing this thing because it is to me a
completely pleasant thing to be knowing everything and it is to me
a completely pleasant thing in me to be feeling in me delicately
inside me the being that I am coming to be knowing through knowing
some one, through knowing any one. I am feeling always in me
knowing every one through some one feeling any one, every one in
them, I am feeling that one and that one is feeling any one, is
feeling every one, and sometimes it is a completely delicate thing
so feeling any one feeling every one. Sometimes it not at all a
delicate thing so feeling some one feeling any one, everyone,
sometimes it is a completely delicate thing, feeling some one
feeling every one, feeling any one. Always all my living I am
feeling some feeling other ones and this I am liking in living.
Sometimes as I am saying it is a very completely delicate thing
feeling some one feeling any one, feeling every one. I am having
now a completely delicate feeling in feeling some one feeling any
one, feeling some one. I am now completely beginning to be feeling
being in young girls, in young women, and this is to me a very
pleasant thing, really a delicate completely pleasant thing.</p>

<p>As I was saying Julia Hersland had in her some loving feeling.
It is certainly pretty certain that she had some loving feeling in
her. She was loving and then marrying Alfred Hersland and then
certainly coming to not loving Alfred Hersland. She was of Dehning
family living. She was certainly in a way always loving and perhaps
coming always to have more and more loving feeling for her father
Mr. Dehning. Mr. Dehning in a way certainly really did make Dehning
family living. In a way Dehning family living was not really what
Julia Hersland was at all living in her living, in a way that was
all she was ever living. As I was saying she was not putting any of
her being into making Dehning family living. She came sometime to
be quite certain that she was an honest one in daily living, that
Dehning family living was honest enough living for any daily living
and then as I was saying she was always all her living needing to
be learning anything and as I was saying she was really not
learning in living and she had her own being as I was saying
attacking independent dependent being, that is courage for living,
that is having some one supporting when the last end of a bad thing
was on her in her living and not then feeling that she was having
to be having such support although having in her really loving
feeling for the supporting being then in her living. She was
certainly then one not using her being for living because she
certainly was not learning anything in living, she certainly had
some loving feeling in her in her living, she certainly was
sometime completely certain that she was an honest one for daily
living, she certainly was not learning anything ever in living for
living, she certainly was not learning anything ever in living her
living, she certainly was not ever learning anything, she certainly
was completely feeling needing learning everything, she certainly
was completely feeling needing learning anything, she certainly was
not failing completely, not succeeding completely in living, she
certainly was one being alive in living. She certainly was one
having some loving feeling in her in her living. Alfred Hersland
certainly had some loving feeling in him in his living. He came to
loving Julia Dehning and then marrying her and then somewhat loving
her and somewhat keeping on loving her and then not loving her and
then later he was really loving another and he was never really of
Hersland family living in the way of having anything very loving in
him or any way of being certain that Hersland family living was
important enough for daily living and always he had a very little
loving feeling for Mr. Hersland and Mrs. Hersland and Martha
Hersland and David Hersland and always then he had some loving
feeling in living, certainly Julia Hersland and Alfred Hersland
each one of them had some loving feeling in them in each one of
them. They had then each one of them come to be loving and
marrying, each one of them then had certainly some loving feeling
then for some one, some aspiration for something important to them
from being one living. Julia Dehning had been a young girl and then
an older one and then one needing for her feeling to be all her
living learning everything, learning anything, needing to be
marrying Alfred Hersland. Alfred Hersland had been a young man
having it in him that not anything had been in living really
important to make for him aspiration to be one succeeding. This had
come to be in him after he had been going to stop studying to earn
a living for one he was then loving and had then come not to be any
longer loving that one. He had come then to have really aspiration
in him for succeeding in being important in succeeding. He had as I
was saying all his living some loving feeling in him. Julia as I
was saying was a young girl and then was really alive in her to her
in her being and needing to be learning anything to be learning
everything and having courage to be living in being alive in her to
her in her being and being then not learning anything and being
then of Dehning family living and being then certain but not then
with it as conviction that she was an honest one in living, that
Dehning family being was honest enough in any daily living, and
always then she was not one not having completely courage for
living and always then she was one succeeding in being in her
living, and always then she was completely anything completely
everything she ever was in living because as I am saying she had
not ever really sense for living because as lam saying she had
always in her some loving feeling, because as I was saying she
always was alive in being in her living. She was then all her
living as I was saying not so very interesting. She was as I am
saying of those having attacking being, independent dependent
being, those having it to have in them emotion to be poignant like
sensation. This is to be now certainly a complete history of her
and of any one coming to be knowing her in any living.</p>

<p>Mostly every one is certain that when they were young they did
anything and then they were not tired or not feeling well from
doing this thing. I am certain this is not what is really ever
happening. I am certain many have not feeling well and very tired
feeling when they are young ones and have been doing something. It
is a very curious thing this being a very tired one, a very
disturbed one, one not feeling well when one was a young one and
then being this when one is an older one, really mostly every one
is all their living when they are quite completely young when they
are young when they are older when they are old ones repeating not
feeling well, being a disturbed one, being a very tired one. Very
many are not really knowing this thing in living. I am knowing this
thing in living. Each one is repeating all their living being a
tired one, being a disturbed one, being one not feeling well again
and again.</p>

<p>This is to be now a description of Julia Dehning and Julia
Dehning coming to be Julia Hersland and Julia Hersland then. She
was then all her living repeating being in her way a tired one a
disturbed one a one not feeling well again and again. Mostly not
any one is really certain of their way of being a tired one, being
one not feeling well being a disturbed one until they are an older
one. Each one, every one is always repeating their being in being
again and again a disturbed one, a tired one, a one not feeling
well in daily living.</p>

<p>How wise it is to be knowing every one is repeating all their
living being tired ones, being disturbed ones, being ones not
feeling well quite often. As I am saying mostly every one is not
knowing that they have been again and again repeating being not
well, being a disturbed one, being a tired one in their young
living. When young ones are very tired ones, are disturbed ones are
not well ones they very often are not at all remembering that
thing, when they are older ones they are sometimes remembering when
they are tired ones from doing something, disturbed ones from
living, not well sometimes in daily living. Some are remembering in
their young living being tired ones and disturbed ones and not well
ones, some are very well remembering this thing. Julia Hersland who
was Julia Dehning was one who was not remembering having been a
tired one, a disturbed one a not well one in young living. She
hardly could be remembering being not a well one, a tired one, a
disturbed one, in her middle living. This is to be now some history
of being in her.</p>

<p>Some have liked very much the being and the living in Julia
Dehning. Some have not liked all the living in Julia Dehning. Some
have liked the being in Julia Dehning. Some have liked and have not
liked the being in Julia Dehning. As I was saying she had all her
living the same way of having tired feeling, of having disturbed
feeling, disturbed living, the same way of being sometimes not well
in daily living. I remember the way I had tired feeling and
disturbed feeling in my living when I was a young one now when I
have it when I am not any longer such a young one. Julia was not
really ever remembering that she had all her living the same being
a tired one, the same being a disturbed one, the same being
sometimes not well, as daily living. This was being in her to know
this in her, to not really remember this inside her. I remember
tired being and disturbed being and being not well in daily living,
sometimes from eating, sometimes from drinking, sometimes from
excited feeling. As I was saying Julia Hersland all her living was
completely resisting changing anything in her being a living one
having a kind of attacking, she was one resisting really learning
anything from having been living, she was one really wanting to be
learning anything, to be learning everything for anything could
really be a food to this one. So then all her living she had had
disturbed living, disturbed feeling, tired feeling, not feeling
well in daily living and really she knew this thing, she could
really be quite reasonably knowing this thing really she was not
ever really remembering this thing. She was then one being alive in
living, she was one having some loving feeling, she was one
learning sometime to know for certain that she was for herself and
every one honest for daily living, she was one having learned to
know as certain that Alfred Hersland was not an honest one for
daily living, she was one coming to have it known as certain that
Hersland family living was honest enough living for any daily
living. She was one then not learning anything in living. She was
one then needing to be learning anything, she was one then
completely resisting being in any way changing in being one living
in some attacking being, she was one having courage to be one being
going on living, very much courage for being one going on living,
she was one having all her living a way of having tired feeling,
disturbed feeling, disturbed living, not feeling well in daily
living and being one quite reasonably knowing this thing and being
one not really ever at all really remembering this thing. This then
is a description of being in Julia Hersland born Julia Dehning. As
I was saying she and Alfred Hersland were not really at all
successful for their married living, anybody now can realise this
thing, certainly, surely any one now with any sense for
understanding when I am explaining now can be realising this
thing.</p>

<p>Loving being in each one of them, what the mother and the father
and each one felt toward every other one just after the marrying.
Some loving feeling then in each one of them.</p>

<p>Loving being in each one of them, what Mr. Dehning and Mrs.
Dehning and Julia Hersland and Alfred Hersland and Hortense Dehning
and George Dehning each one felt toward every other one of them
just after the marrying of Julia Dehning with Alfred Hersland is
what I am now beginning to be a little describing. Some loving
feeling then in each one of them I have said again and again was in
them each one of them. I said Julia had really not sense for
living, she was completely resisting any changing by learning of
being in her being in her as attacking, she was then really not
learning anything in living, she was then not doing anything any
one was needing, she was really then not having any one really
doing anything she was needing, she was then always she was really
living in her being and really she was not failing in living and
really some liked very much the being in her in her living, and
really some liked and did not like being in her, and some really
did not like being in her, and to herself and every one and really
then she had courage in being one going on being one living. So
then she had really not sense for living, she had really loving
feeling in her in all of her living. Some can have resisting to any
changing in any attacking being in them and can have from that
being in them sense for living, really courage for winning in
attacking being. Julia as I was saying had it to have quite
completely active all her living needing to be learning anything,
to be learning everything, she had it in her needing to have as
somewhere in her that some one would keep it from coming to her the
last end of any bad thing. And so then she not learning anything in
living from not having any not resisting any changing in attacking
being in her had not any sense at all really for living in her in
her living. Now I will tell something about loving being.</p>

<p>Some are sweet ones to some, some are sweet ones to hardly any
one, some are quite sweet ones to mostly every one, some are
somewhat sweet ones in living, some are not sweet ones in any
living they are doing. Some having resisting being are very sweet
ones, some, having attacking being are very sweet ones. Some are,
some are not sweet ones, each one of these I am now beginning to be
describing as having some loving feeling Mrs. Dehning and Mr.
Dehning and Julia Hersland and Alfred Hersland and George Dehning
and Hortense Dehning had some sweetness in them. Many having
attacking being have sweetness in them, many having resisting being
have sweetness in them. I would like to be sometime some in love
with every one. I will not be sometime some in love with every one.
I would like certainly to be sometime in love some with every one,
to have every one sometime in love with me and then I would be
certain what way each one had loving being being in them. I really
would like then some to have each one, every one, any one having
loving being to my feeling and then I could have it in me to be
certain what way any one, in which way each one having loving in
them have loving feeling in them and coming out from them. Not
every one will ever be loving this one, that is certain and so this
one and I am this one will not be completely certain of loving
being in each one. I will be quite certain about loving being in
some, I will be completely certain about loving being in some, I
will be somewhat certain about loving being in mostly every one.
There are some who are not telling, showing, meaning anything about
loving being in them to me as I look long at them, some kinds in
men and women. I do very much regret this thing. I would like very
well to have loving being from some one of each kind of them to me,
to some one I am completely knowing. I regret that I do not know
completely loving being in every kind there is in men and women. I
see some kinds of men and women, I look long at some of these kinds
in men and women and I see nothing of the way they do their loving.
And then I am very much regretting I do not yet know
everything.</p>

<p>Julia Hersland was of the attacking kind in men and women having
emotion when having emotion poignantly like a sensation. She had
very considerable excitement in being one going on with living, she
had very much nervous being in being one needing to be learning
everything, she had some dependent being in being one having right
Dehning family living in her as being, she had stupidity in being
one resisting really learning in living, she was one having some
passion in needing having some loving relation, she was one having
some worn out feeling in not having completed passional loving, she
was one having much courage in being one being honest for winning
all living, she was one being sweet to some by being needing that
some one had been keeping her from having the last end of a bad
thing happening, she was courageous to many in having it as being
that she was really going to be going on living, she was a harsh
thing to the feeling of some in being one not remembering having
tired, disturbed, not well feeling, she was a hard thing to some
from having it as being that she was not attacking for winning,
that she was attacking to be going on with being one living in the
being that had been all her living from the beginning. This is then
quite a full description of being in her.</p>

<p>I know all loving being in her, I will now describe this thing.
I know all loving being in all the Dehning family each one and in
Alfred Hersland who was married to Julia Dehning and I will now
begin a description of all the loving being in each one of them,
ever in any one of them. Alfred Hersland and Julia Dehning were
married. Each one of the two of them had some loving feeling in
them then, each one of the Dehning family had some loving feeling
in them then. This will be now some description of loving feeling
in each one of them then.</p>

<p>They were married then. Married living was then beginning to be
in them in each one of them Julia Hersland and Alfred Hersland and
for them in Mr. Dehning and Mrs. Dehning and George and Hortense
Dehning. Every one of them had then for them, every one of Dehning
family living, feeling of married living in them. Julia was having
then married living, married loving. Julia knew she certainly was
learning then anything. Alfred Hersland came then to be of Dehning
family living. Mr. Dehning could commence then to have some pride
in him in the married living of Alfred and Julia Hersland, he could
then have in him beginning to be listening when Alfred Hersland
could begin to be talking about doing anything in his living. Mrs.
Dehning had then come to have feeling for married living in Mr. and
Mrs. Alfred Hersland. She could then fondle him some, Alfred
Hersland, and make of him a son-in-law in Dehning family living.
She could be then in Dehning family living as she always had been
and Julia having married living was a part of her but apart from
her. Mrs. Dehning then was completely then feeling their married
living nicely and with a good deal of active contented feeling
which was just then just beginning to be a little commencing in Mr.
Dehning. She was not at all then helping Mr. Dehning to this thing,
each one then of the two of them had in them their own individual
feeling in feeling married living in Julia and Alfred Hersland.
Hortense Dehning then was always needing loving Julia in all of her
living, she Hortense was then a really young girl in her feeling
and this in her then could not be at all a thing to be ever then
noticed in her by any one. George Dehning was then in Dehning
family living, that was all that was in him then in feeling married
living in Julia and Alfred Hersland then.</p>

<p>There are some who have not in them enough to last out not being
a moral one, not feeling moral conviction throughout their living.
There are some who have not in them enough power to learn anything
in living, although needing to be learning anything for being
living, so that they can go on without having it in them a moral
conviction that some one is teaching some one something in all
living. There are some not having in them enough needing to be
learning anything, although they are completely always needing to
be learning anything, to be not bothered with being certain that
they have honest being for daily living. Not any one having really
in them moral feeling is really believing any other one is really
liking frivolous living, is really believing that they are not
really needing learning anything. This then is a description of
Julia Hersland having been just then a married one. As I was saying
she was in her feeling needing learning anything for everything to
her feeling could be food to her for her to be one really living in
going on being living. This was then not enough in her as I was
saying so that she did not come then to be completely certain that
she was honest for daily living, that Dehning family living was
honest enough for any daily living, that Alfred Hersland was not
honest for daily living. So then she was one having moral
conviction that she was honest for daily living, that there was
teaching existing in living. This then is moral conviction, this is
not religion this is moral conviction. Religion in such a one is
being certain that the last end of a bad thing will net come to
such a one. Moral conviction in such a one is being certain of
honest being for daily living, of teaching being always going on
being existing. Julia Hersland then was a married one, she had
completely feeling in her needing to be learning anything, this was
in her but was not really filling her to keep her from being
certain about honest being for daily living, about teaching being
really always everywhere somewhere existing. This then was Julia
Hersland having become a married one.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning as I was saying was a little coming to be having it
in him that he was to begin inside him listening to what Alfred
Hersland could be telling him about what Alfred Hersland really was
needing to be one completely being in living. This was then just a
little then beginning to be in Mr. Dehning when Alfred and Julia
Hersland had become quite entirely then married and living so then.
Mrs. Dehning was then completely in her in their married living
being beginning. She was completely in herself then inside her
then, Mrs. Dehning, she was then of married living in them, she was
then completely then again all of herself inside her to make her
herself again then. This was then married living beginning in them
in her then. She had completely in her then inside her the
beginning married living in them, she had completely in her then
inside her the being of her. This was beginning married living then
of Alfred Hersland and Julia Hersland in her.</p>

<p>Hortense Dehning as I was saying was in her for herself then
really quite nicely living any living in Julia then, and so then
Hortense then was living inside her beginning married living of
Julia and Alfred Hersland and this was not then an important thing
to any one and only to Hortense for remembering. As I was saying
George Dehning was living in Dehning family living, certainly he
was living in that living then and so he was living in Dehning
family living in the beginning married living in Alfred and Julia
Hersland and that is enough then about him. To go on then. As I was
saying once, Alfred Hersland was needing something to make him
completely be then one being really living. This is then to be some
description of his coming not to be having, to be having this
thing.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning had all he could be needing to be successful in
living. As I was saying more and more it was important being in him
really to be listening to any one wanting to be doing anything.
Each one has their own way of telling some other one what they are
needing for being succeeding in living. Some are stammering some
when they are telling this thing of their needing something to be
then a successful one, to some one. Some tell this quite quickly to
any one, some tell it quite quickly but not to any one, some almost
do not tell this thing to any one, some seem to be one not telling
this thing to any one some of such of them then tell this thing
quite completely to some. Each one is himself is herself inside her
inside him in telling this thing, in telling of needing something
to be making that one a successful one in living. Some are very
convincing in telling this thing, some are not at all convincing in
telling this thing, some are more some are less convincing in
telling this thing, some are convincing to some in telling this
thing, some are not really convincing to any one in telling this
thing, some are convincing to mostly every one in telling this
thing. As I was saying it was coming to be always more important
being in Mr. Dehning to be listening to any one wanting to be doing
anything. Mr. Dehning was everything he was needing for his
successful living. This is certain. Mr. Dehning was one being quite
successful in all of his living. Alfred Hersland came to be a
little convincing to him, not really to the completeness of being
convincing to him in telling what he would be needing to be one
quite successful in living but then Alfred Hersland was then being
of Dehning family living. Mr. Dehning was certainly living then
being in Dehning family living, he was one having it always more in
him as important being listening to any one wanting to be doing
anything, he was one having quite altogether everything he was
using for quite completely successful living, he was certainly one
certain that not any one should be not having something in living
they were not then using, certainly he had feeling that Alfred
Hersland to be succeeding would have to be using everything he had
for living and so he Alfred Hersland was a little never really
convincing in being one going to be succeeding to Mr. Dehning but
then Mr. Dehning was in Dehning family living, Alfred Hersland was
in Dehning family living, listening to any one wanting to be doing
anything was always more and more important being in Mr. Dehning,
Mr. Dehning came then to enough then for completely listening came
then to be convinced by Alfred Hersland's telling what Alfred
Hersland was needing for succeeding in living.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning liked very well then hearing any one telling again
and again what any one was needing for succeeding in living. As I
am saying always more and more it was important being in Mr.
Dehning being one listening to any one telling about what they were
needing to be doing to be really living in their living. As I am
saying Mr. Dehning liked very well then some repeating, Alfred
Hersland then was really then repeating with pretty steady
aspiration that he was needing something to be succeeding in being
one living.</p>

<p>I am beginning to like conversation, I am beginning to like
reading some thing about some that I never before found at all
interesting. I am beginning to like conversation, I used not to
like conversing at all, and social living, and so going on and on I
am needing always I am needing something to give to me completely
successful diversion to give me enough stimulation to keep me
completely going on being one going on living. That is a
description of some being in me, this is then some history of me.
So then I am beginning now to like conversation.</p>

<p>As I was saying Alfred Hersland was telling then after he was a
married one with a reasonable steadiness in aspiration, with quite
a really complete enthusiasm, with eagerness but not with
insistence in telling, with quite sufficient pleasure in repeating,
with quite a great deal of honesty in hoping, he was telling then
what he was needing to be one really succeeding quite well in
living. He was then in Dehning family living. He was then just
married to Julia Dehning.</p>

<p>I was saying that I was coming to now be interested in
conversing and this is to me now completeness in diversion which is
what I am having to make of me one going to be going on living. I
have been having all my living completeness in diversion and so I
have been one all my living been one going to be going on being
living. Each one then who is not stopping being going on living is
one having it in them in some way to be one going on going on being
living.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning as I was saying was one quite completely succeeding
in living, he was one going to be going on in being one being
living and always it was more and more important in him in his
being that he was listening when some one was telling what that one
was going to be doing in living, was going to be needing to be
doing what that one was going to be doing in living. So then it was
always in Mr. Dehning that he was listening to some one telling
what they were going to be doing in living, what they were going to
be needing to be going to be doing something. As I am saying Mr.
Dehning had in him to be really listening to some one telling such
a thing to him. As I was saying he was not really listening to
Alfred Hersland until Alfred Hersland was really in Dehning family
living, then sooner than it was right to him by listening he was
doing more than listening and this is to be now some history of
this thing.</p>

<p>Anybody can understand that Mr. Dehning was one really listening
to any one wanting to be doing anything, really listening to any
one. Anybody can understand that this always was in Mr. Dehning and
always was more and more important being in him. Any one can
understand that really with Alfred Hersland he came not to be so
really listening as it was in him to be doing really in his living.
Alfred was in Dehning family living and Mr. Dehning always was
listening to any one in Dehning family living wanting to be doing
anything and Alfred was in Dehning family daily living, he was in
Dehning family living and not born to be this thing and he was one
really earnest in aspiring, really honest in hoping, really
enthusiastic in believing, really thorough in repeating. Alfred
Hersland came then to be beginning.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland came then to be beginning succeeding in living.
This is to be now some history of this thing.</p>

<p>Julia was one not really attacking for winning, she was one not
needing to be really living, she was really doing what she was
feeling she was needing to be doing if she were to be one really
being living in going on living. She was really then all her living
keeping on being in family living although she was attacking to be
going on being living by learning anything. That is a history of
her. She was certain then after she was a married one that she was
an honest one in daily living, that Dehning family living was
honest enough for living, she was then always then and always in
Dehning family living. She was always then attacking to be learning
as if she could be one going to be really living in being one going
to be going on as living. Really then she was all her living in
Dehning family living. Really then as I have been saying quite
often she was not attacking to be winning, any one can now
understand this thing. To very many she was one attacking to be
winning, really then she was in a way like Mrs. Dehning who too was
stupid in being one attacking and not for any real winning of
anything.</p>

<p>Any one can then now be understanding being in Julia Hersland
and can be understanding then Dehning family living, and can begin
again now to be getting ready to be understanding being in Mr.
Dehning and in Alfred Hersland and how they came to be doing with
themselves and each other what they came to be doing. This is a way
of saying I could be such a very happy one if every one really was
certain that I was really a very wise one. I like it that I am
feeling that I could be a very happy one if every one were certain
I was a completely wise one. Really I like it very well that I am
not really certain, that mostly not any one is really certain. It
is a nicely disturbing feeling, this thing. I am now completely
realising being in Mr. Dehning and Alfred Hersland.</p>

<p>That thing that I was saying that some have not ambition as
emotion in them and these then are to mostly every one not
ambitious ones in living and some of these have very much ambition
as really being in them and some have it as intention and not
emotion in them and some really do not have it as emotion, as
intention, as being in the being in them is really very
interesting. I can understand this thing from having been knowing
some who are ones older ones are very much liking, really these
have it in them sometimes to be very much needing to be succeeding
in living for the being in them and yet not having ambition as
emotion, as intention in them really not having at all ambition as
emotion, as intention in them, makes of them then those being very
sweet in living, being full of sweetness then and light and life to
very many knowing them. Some not having any ambition as intention,
as emotion in them have not any ambition in them but these are just
being in living, they are really not actually succeeding in living.
Some of such of them are being very completely well in being
living, this is another thing. Now I am thinking of Julia Hersland
and Alfred Hersland, now I am thinking of one having really not
ambition as emotion, almost not ambition as intention, quite
completely ambition as being, now I am thinking of one having
completely ambition as aspiration, considerably and hopefully and
even enthusiastically and eagerly, ambition as intention, not
really ambition as being. This is to be a history of Alfred and
Julia Hersland.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning had come then as I was saying to be doing
differently than listening to Alfred Hersland. He gave him a good
deal of money as a loan for Alfred to be really then beginning to
be succeeding in living.</p>

<p>Alfred certainly did have a very little real sense for living,
else with being one aspiring in emotion, and ambitious in emotion
and intention and not ambitious in being and not really succeeding
in being one resisting and not really succeeding in being one
engulfing he would not have been one ending living with not being
then one having been really completely failing. He was not ever
really succeeding in living. He was one not really learning
anything very much by having been in living. He was not well in the
beginning of his middle living believing he was beginning to be one
going to be really going on succeeding in living. Now I am going
on. Now go on.</p>

<p>Succeeding is to me just now very interesting. Some are
certainly succeeding in living, some are certainly not succeeding
in living, some are in between. I have been coming just lately to
be understanding more and more the being in each one and the way
being in each one makes of each one one succeeding, one not
succeeding, one in between succeeding and not succeeding in living,
one succeeding some, one succeeding sometime, one succeeding
sometimes, one not succeeding at all in living, one not succeeding
quite often in living, one beginning with succeeding, one
succeeding and then not with any more succeeding just keeping on
going. I have come more and more to understanding the being in men
and women in relation to their succeeding and failing in living. I
have been making groups of them groups of men and women and
grouping the being in them in relation to ambition, to succeeding,
to failing in them. I have been explaining some men to some and it
is certainly an interesting thing to be doing this thing. I am
hoping sometime to write a complete history of men and women, I am
beginning to be hoping this thing again, I am filled up now so much
with learning so much about men and women and feel so much wisdom
in me now inside me completely organising that I am coming again to
be almost certain that I can sometime be writing the complete
history of every one who ever was or is or will be living. I will
sometime be writing complete histories of pairs of people who are
connected in living. I am now telling about some succeeding, some
failing in living.</p>

<p>It is very difficult in quarrelling for either one to be certain
what the other one has then in him that is making him then do
quarrelling. This is often quite astonishing This is sometimes
quite entirely astonishing that not one quarrelling is certain of
what the other one has in her, in him for quarrelling. This can be
really astonishing when any one later is learning at all what was
then in another one. And then it is such a very difficult thing
ever to believe the other one when the other one is telling what
was in him for quarrelling.</p>

<p>It is certainly a difficult thing to believe another one about
quarrelling in that other one with one. Very often then it is not a
thing any one can be doing believing then the other one. Sometimes
it is a thing some one can be doing believing the other one. Mostly
then every one comes sometime more or less in them to quarrel with
some other one, with mostly every other one sometime. A little
quite a little, quite a good deal, quite some, quite almost not at
all, quite often, quite seldom, quite certainly, quite slowly,
quite suddenly, quite gradually, certainly there is quite a good
deal in every one of some quarrelling with some one, with quite a
number of them that sometime for that one are being living with
that one in the living that one can have in that one. This then is
to be now much description of Dehning and Hersland quarrelling.
They certainly did quarrel some.</p>

<p>They certainly did quarrel some all of them. They certainly did
quarrel completely, some of them. This is to be now some history of
all of them.</p>

<p>Now I am writing of being successful in living, of quarrelling
in being living. Now I am writing of having loving feeling in them
some men and some women of being ones succeeding in living some men
and some women, of being doing some quarrelling some of these men
and some of these women. This is to be now more history of each one
of them.</p>

<p>Quarrelling is to me very interesting. Beginning and ending is
to me very interesting. Mostly every one does some quarrelling.
Quarrelling is to me very interesting. Beginning is to me very
interesting. Ending is to me very interesting. Every one is
beginning and ending in their living. Mostly every one is sometimes
quarrelling with some one. Quarrelling as I am saying is to me very
interesting. Beginning is interesting, ending is interesting to me
as I have been again saying. Mostly every one is sometimes
quarrelling with some one, mostly every one is beginning sometime
ending with some one. This that I am now writing is a history of
Dehning and Hersland living and quarrelling.</p>

<p>Quarrelling is not letting those having attacking be winning by
attacking, those having resisting being be winning by resisting,
those having dependent being be winning by dependent being, those
having engulfing being be winning by engulfing being. This is
quarreling in living, not letting each one by some one be winning
by the being in them. This is certainly quarrelling in living.
There is a great deal of quarrelling in living, that is reasonably
certain and that is a very natural thing as certainly very many are
not winning with the being in them.</p>

<p>Quarrelling is then this thing. Sometimes it is like not writing
only for one's sell and those not knowing one. Quarrelling is then
certainly mostly that each one is not winning, to some one, with
the being in them, quarrelling is then certainly then mostly that
some one is not winning then, for some one, with the being in them.
That certainly is quarrelling. That certainly is continually
happening in living in any living by every one, by any one.</p>

<p>Quarrelling then is some one not winning by the being in them
for some one, to some one. This is now to be some history of some
quarrelling.</p>

<p>Now any one can be understanding how Julia and Alfred Hersland,
how Mr. Dehning and Alfred Hersland how Mrs. Dehning, how each one
came to be quarrelling, how Mr. Dehning and Julia Hersland and Mrs.
Dehning then came to be quarrelling with Alfred Hersland. Surely
any one can now understand this thing. Surely now every one can now
understand this thing.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning was helping Alfred Hersland as Alfred Hersland had
wanted Mr. Dehning to help him. I was saying that Mr. Dehning came
to help Alfred Hersland in the way Alfred Hersland had been wanting
Mr. Dehning to help him. I told something about this thing.</p>

<p>Julia and Alfred Hersland were still living a married living
when Mr. Dehning was not going into any house where Alfred Hersland
was staying and Mrs. Dehning was still going to see Julia where she
was living. Alfred Hersland was then not beginning to be
succeeding. He was really not altogether failing.</p>

<p>Mr. Dehning had come to be certain that he could be explaining
to any one that Alfred Hersland was not honest enough for daily
living, that he could really convince any one of this thing. He
certainly had good reason for convincing every one, he certainly
could have convinced mostly every one. He could convince almost any
one of this thing. He was quite certain and he had good reason for
being quite certain that any one could convince any one of this
thing.</p>

<p>As I was saying Julia Hersland very soon after commencing having
married living was certain that Alfred Hersland was not an honest
one for living, she was certain of this thing, she came at that
time then to be to herself completely knowing it as certain that
she was an honest one in living an honest one for living, she had
always been knowing that Dehning family living was honest enough
for any daily living, in daily living.</p>

<p>Beginning anything, going on with anything, ending come to
anything to any one ever living is tome an interesting thing. This
is being now more description of everything ever existing in Mr.
Dehning, Mrs. Dehning, Alfred Hersland, Julia Hersland, George
Dehning and Hortense Dehning and any one coming to know any of them
very well in their living.</p>

<p>It was a natural thing for Mr. Dehning to be certain that he
could convince any one that Alfred Hersland was what he knew him
then to be in daily living. It was a perfectly natural thing for
Mr. Dehning to be certain of this thing, Mr. Dehning did not talk
so very much about this thing. Really he told it again and again to
Julia and Mrs. Dehning and George Dehning some in Dehning family
living but this was a natural thing for Mr. Dehning to be doing
then. Really he was naturally completely certain that he could
certainly convince every one that he had been completely right in
not any longer having Alfred Hersland in any family living where he
Mr. Dehning was having family living. He was certain that this
thing was a right thing. He never thought or said then that Julia
should have come to be certain not to want to be married to Alfred.
He certainly never did say this thing then, that is he never really
certainly said this thing. He said quite often that Alfred Hersland
was not honest enough for any daily living. He was quite certain of
this thing. Any one certainly could be convinced of this thing if
there could come any reason for convincing any one of this thing.
Mr. Dehning said this thing when it was right for him to be saying
this thing. Mr. Dehning had completely natural feeling in him about
this whole thing. This then has been a description of Mr. Dehning
and Alfred Hersland having been in Dehning family living. This is
to be now more description of being in each one and in some
together in living of these I have mentioned again and again.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland had ambition in him. Julia Hersland had ambition
for living. Not either one or the other of them had really sense
for living, not either one or the other was really in the whole of
living succeeding or failing. They had each of them ambition in
them. They had ambition differently in them each one of them. Mr.
Dehning had ambition in living. Mrs. Dehning had ambition. This is
to be now some description of ambition, and honest living, and
loving being and daily living and succeeding and failing in each
one of them.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland then was for Dehning family living, not honest
in daily living. He was much later when he was working with some
men then fairly successful in living. He could be then when working
with certain men quite a successful enough one in living. He had
not really sense for living, he had not really not any sense for
living. He had as I was saying not any ambition in him from the
resisting, from the engulfing being in him. He had a feeling from
the resisting and engulfing being in him some feeling of succeeding
in living, of feeling something elegant in him in living for him.
He had then too, from the resisting and engulfing being in him with
this feeling of feeling something being quite elegant in him and in
living and some feeling of succeeding being an elegant thing in
being living, quite a good deal of vanity for living. As I was
saying really aspiration and ambition was really stupid being in
him because really he was one not winning by being resisting,
really not winning by being engulfing. He had aspiration in him, he
had ambition in him, as I was saying he had not really feeling of
anything being important in him until he was loving and wanting to
stop studying to marry that one and then not wanting to marry that
one. He had not ambition and aspiration in him by the being of him.
He had aspiration and ambition in him, beginning when something was
important to him, as something of emotion, as certainly a good deal
of intention. So then aspiration and ambition as emotion was almost
sentimental being in him it was not in him from being one able to
be succeeding able to be winning by the being in him, aspiration
and ambition as intention was really stupid being in him, they were
not from being in him but from needing to be having what he needed
to be having to have anything be important to him which was not
from the being in him important to him. He was then certainly for
Dehning family living not honest for daily living and to himself
then he was a man having it in him to have that he was not quite
certain that to be a dead one was to be really not a dead one. He
had some loving feeling in him, he could with not winning resisting
and engulfing being have violent temper sometimes in him. He was
one then to Dehning family living not honest in daily living. He
was one very much later, and working with some men, not really not
successful in living.</p>

<p>Certainly some are loving, some are honest, some are good ones,
some are thinking in living, certainly there are some in living
having some of thinking, loving, good being, honesty in them. Some
have certainly some of something really in them. Certainly they
have.</p>

<p>Some have pretty honest living in them always in their daily
living and are liking it very well that they have some reputation
for this thing. Mr. Dehning really was such a one. Some come to be
sometime completely certain that they are completely honest ones in
living and then all their living they are completely freely
attacking with this thing. Julia Dehning was such a one. She was
really not feeling it as being that there was for her a reputation
of being an honest one in living, she liked it that the Dehning
family living, Mr. Dehning, had a complete reputation of honest
living in daily living, her being an honest one in daily living was
a thing when she came to be living with it inside her completely in
her she could be using all her living for all the attacking she was
ever doing to be winning. Alfred Hersland was not believing that
not every one was thinking that he was an honest enough one for
daily living. He never really was certain that any one excepting
Mr. Dehning was really believing that he was not an honest man for
any kind of daily living. He never was really certain that Julia
could have really been believing this thing if she had not been
then and all of her living in Dehning family living. Julia was
certain of this thing that Alfred Hersland was not honest enough
for daily living when she came to living in married living. She
came very quickly to be very certain that to her then she was one
living in her being which was one being complete in honest living
and she was soon then coming to be attacking in all her living with
this thing. Mr. Dehning as I was saying was one having completely
in him for him the reputation of being one really completely honest
enough for any daily living. Mrs. Dehning was one honest enough for
any daily living, and she had feeling of Dehning family living
having a reputation for this thing but the kind of reputation she
was always feeling they were having was the kind one comes to be
having when one is a dead one, when one is not any longer in
living, she was really in living quite completely an honest one.
Each one then of the four of them Mr. Dehning, Alfred Hersland,
Julia Hersland and Mrs. Dehning had a different feeling in their
having reputation of being an honest enough one for living. This is
then what was happening. Mr. Dehning had come quite slowly to be
certain that Alfred Hersland was completely not an honest enough
man for any honest enough daily living. Mr. Dehning had come quite
slowly enough to be certain of this thing. He had as I was saying
never been really certain that Alfred Hersland was really for him
in Dehning family living and then he was certain enough of this
thing to be pretty nearly completely listening to Alfred Hersland
telling about anything if needed to be doing to be really living in
daily living and then he was still not quite entirely completely
listening and he was already then giving Alfred Hersland what
Alfred Hersland was needing to be beginning to be living in daily
living to be beginning to be living to be one succeeding in living,
Mr. Dehning then certainly came to be certain that Alfred Hersland
was not honest enough for any daily living and Alfred Hersland was
quite certain then that Mr. Dehning was completely in him certain
of this thing. Mr. Dehning did not see Alfred Hersland any more at
all then to speak at all to him in any daily living. Mr. Dehning
was certainly certain that he could convince any one that certainly
Alfred Hersland was not honest for any daily living. Mr. Dehning
could certainly convince almost any one of this thing. Mr. Dehning
did certainly not just then begin anything to convince any one of
this thing.</p>

<p>Julia Hersland came very quickly to be really certain that
Alfred Hersland was not an honest one for any daily living and as I
was saying she was one having then certainly complete courage for
being one going on being living. She knew then as being in her that
she was one being honest always in being one being living, having
courage always for being one going to be going on being living. She
was always then needing to be one going to be learning everything.
This has been then a complete description. She was quickly certain
that Alfred Hersland was not honest for any daily living. This then
was then for Alfred Hersland not a serious thing, this was then not
in him then as important in him, as being living then in him as
being really something really exciting. As I was saying in a way
Julia Hersland was not an interesting one in being living. She was
an interesting one in being living to some, that will be again more
history of her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dehning was certainly not certain from any being in her
that Alfred Hersland was not honest enough for any daily living.
She could and did come to be quite certain of this thing. As I said
of her she was completely an honest one in being one being living.
As I was saying she was feeling reputation as being as if some one
were already a dead one. As I was saying she was one mostly
attacking harshly in living but not for any winning. As I was
saying she had sense for living. As I was saying she was always
being in her stupid being in being one feeling anything. So then
she was not certain from any being in her being there to her in her
that Alfred Hersland was not honest enough for any daily living.
She certainly came to be certain of this thing. So then she was
going on talking to Allred Hersland for quite a long time in daily
living and then it came that to hear him or to see him or to know
of him made her completely then a nervous one.</p>

<p>I will be telling about feeling being in George Dehning and
Hortense Dehning in the history of David Hersland that will
certainly sometime be written.</p>

<p>I have given a description of Alfred Hersland and Julia Hersland
not succeeding in married living, of Alfred Hersland not succeeding
in being one beginning to be succeeding in living from being in
Dehning family living. As I was saying later he was not failing in
living, he was fairly succeeding, later when he was working with
some other men.</p>

<p>This is to be now more history of married living of Mr. and Mrs.
Hersland and of Mr. Dehning living and Mrs. Dehning being
living.</p>

<p>The Herslands Alfred and Julia were living married living. They
had a baby and it was quite a strong well one but it did not live
to be a very old one. It got sick and died of something. As I was
saying Julia loved babies being little babies and her children.
This first one was a little boy and Mrs. Dehning thought that he
was one looking very much like the father of him. Mr. Dehning had
seen him and saw him very often and he was glad that his daughter
Julia had a baby and loved him. They had later Julia and Alfred
another child and this one was a girl and Mrs. Dehning was certain
that this one would be in Dehning family living, this one was
already looking like the mother of her. Mr. Dehning often saw her
when the nurse was with her, the baby, and he liked it very much
that Julia was happy in having a little girl who was like her. Then
there was a little boy who was quite a weak little one and about
this one it was not quite certain although Mrs. Dehning was pretty
nearly certain that he was quite a good deal like the father of
him. This one was quite a weak little one in commencing but he came
to be quite a strong enough little one a little later in his
living. He was certainly a good deal like the father of him, Mrs.
Dehning often said this about him but he had it a little in him to
be like his young uncle George Dehning. Mrs. Dehning did not say
this very often Mr. and Mrs. Hersland then were living then married
living as I am saying.</p>

<p>The Herslands Alfred and Julia Hersland did not go on being in
married living. It was a natural thing as I was saying that they
should not be succeeding in married living, the two of them. As I
was saying Alfred Hersland came later to loving another. Julia
Hersland too came later to loving another. Each one of them as I
was saying was not succeeding was not failing really in living. I
can feel myself in myself going to be being an old one. I can feel
being in some going to be old ones in the living of these and I can
not feel being in some when these are going to be beginning to be
old ones. I can certainly more and more feel old being going to be
in men and in women in each one. I am beginning a little to feel
young being having been, very young being having been in each one
in all women and all men. I certainly can feel being old ones in a
good many now when I am feeling being in them. I like to be feeling
them being old ones in every little thing in every piece of being
in them. I cannot so well feel being in them having been very young
in them. I am a little beginning to feel this thing, I am just
commencing then in really feeling this thing. I am feeling again
and again in myself going to be an old one. I do not like this
thing, I certainly do like this thing. I certainly do like ending
being in all men and in all women. I certainly do not at all like
this thing. I certainly have completely a queer disturbed mixed
with sombre feeling in this thing. I certainly do really completely
need feeling certainly this thing in every one that each one is
sometime ending in being living. Alfred Hersland and Julia Hersland
went on then for sometime being living. Sometime then they went on
being living in married living with each other and then they were
not and then they had more living in them and then one and then the
other one was ended in being living. This is then to be all history
of them. I will be going on to the ending in all description of
every one, of any one. How can anything be different from what it
is. I do not know any such a thing. Very many are knowing this. I
am not knowing this thing.</p>

<p>I am not knowing anything being different from what it is. Very
many are knowing everything being different from what it is. Once
this was to me an astonishing thing. Now it is not to me at all an
astonishing thing.</p>

<p>I am thinking now about everything being what it is, everything
not being what it is, something being what it is, nothing being
what it is, something not being what it is to some, I am thinking
of this thing and I am thinking about sense for living in men and
women.</p>

<p>I would like to be thinking about some being practical in their
being and some not being that thing in their being but I am not
just now feeling any understanding of this thing and so I am not
thinking about this thing. I have been expecting some time to be
soon thinking about this thing. I am not as I have just been saying
thinking now about this thing. I am thinking now as I have been
saying about something being what it is, not being what it is to
some men and some women. I am thinking about every one having it or
not having it that something that everything is what it is, not
what it is to them each one of them, that nothing is what it is, to
some one. I am too thinking and going soon now to be telling very
much about sense for living in men and women.</p>

<p>Those in Dehning daily living, those in Hersland daily living
each one of them came to know some men and women, in being one
being living. Each one any one having living being has some sense
for living or has not any sense for living pretty nearly not any
sense for living. This is to be now some description of sense for
living in men and women.</p>

<p>Some have sense for living from having realisation in them that
each thing they are knowing is such a thing as it is to them and
really knowing this in them. Each thing has then to some of such of
them the value that thing has really for any one needing that thing
for being one going on living. Some are knowing in them that each
thing they are knowing in living is the thing that thing really is
being but they are not feeling that thing as really value to any
one for any one to be going on living. I will sometime be telling
some more about this thing.</p>

<p>Kinds in men and women. I am seeing kinds in men and in women so
many kinds in them. Sometimes I am seeing a number of one kind of
them, some other days I am seeing a number of other kinds of them.
I wish I knew everything about them, I wish I knew everything about
each one, I wish I had a complete record of each one, what each one
did, what each one had as being in her in him, what each one could
be doing, thinking, feeling, knowing. I certainly do wish that I
knew everything about being and doing and feeling and knowing being
in each one. I do not yet that is certain, I am almost not hoping
that I will sometime know everything about every one, I only know
that I wish that I did sometime know everything about every one all
through the living being ever in each one. Nobody knows, nobody can
know, and I am telling it very often, nobody knows nobody can know
how I am wanting to know everything about every one. I am seeing so
many just now having living being in them succeeding or failing
much or some in living, nobody knows, nobody can know how I want to
know all the being ever in them. Nobody can know how tired I get
looking so hard at them, nobody knows how much I want to know all
the being there is or was or will be in any man or woman ever
living. Nobody knows and I tell it very often, nobody knows this
thing. Nobody can know this thing being in me that I am telling
very often, nobody knows what I am wanting, that I am wanting to
know completely all the being there ever was or is or will be in
any one.</p>

<p>I can certainly not really tell this thing to any one so that
any one can completely believe this thing that I am really wanting
to be knowing all the being ever having been, going to be, being in
any one. No one can really believe my needing really needing to be
having this thing, really needing this thing for living.</p>

<p>I tell you every one that I am seeing very many kinds in men and
women, a very great many men and women, and all the kinds there are
of them. I tell it again and again that I am seeing a very great
many men and women, such a number of them and I am seeing kinds in
them and I tell every one that I am doing this thing, that I am
knowing this thing. Nobody knows, nobody knows that I am really
needing to be knowing everything ever in any man in any woman, any
being, all being ever in any woman in any man. Nobody knows that I
am completely needing to be completely knowing this thing. I am
seeing a very great many men and women. I am seeing kinds in them.
I do not know all the being in each one of them.</p>

<p>I see very many men and women. I look at them, some have been
succeeding in being one being living, some are succeeding, some
will be succeeding. Some have not been succeeding in being in their
living, some will not be succeeding, some are not succeeding. Some
have sense for living and are not succeeding, have not been
succeeding, will not be succeeding in living. I will tell something
now about sense for living in women and in men.</p>

<p>I see very many just now who are living and I look at them. I
see very many just now. I am asking some of them to do something,
some of these do what I ask them to do and some do not do what I
ask them. Some do in a way something when I ask them to do
something. I am as I am saying seeing now very many men and very
many women. I am seeing each one of them doing several things for
living, some are asking, some are talking, some are standing, some
are waiting, some are working, some are eating, some are sitting,
some are drinking, some are writing, some are loving, some are
forgetting that they had begun doing something, some are thinking
every one should understand what they are saying, some are feeling
that every one near them are ugly ones for living, some are
laughing, very many are rushing some are washing themselves or
other things, some are dressing, some are having their feet swollen
and hurting them as they are standing, as they are walking, as they
are sitting, as they are working. Anybody then can see then that I
am seeing just now very many men and very many women.</p>

<p>As I am saying sense for living is something that is to me quite
interesting. I can tell something now about this thing in men and
women.</p>

<p>I can tell something more about this thing about having sense in
living, by living, for living, I can tell some more about sense in
men and in women. I sometimes can tell very much about sense for
living in men and women. I have been telling to some quite a good
deal about this thing. I am thinking now about one kind and lam
knowing now not really knowing all of them but really knowing being
in them in some of this kind in men and women. I am knowing three
of them of this group of them as men. I am knowing one of a group
of them as a woman. I am knowing another of another group in men
and women as a woman, some of another group of them some as men and
some as women. I am knowing another very large group of them and I
am knowing these as everything they ever are in living some of
them. I am trying to begin now telling what I am knowing about
sense in men and in women.</p>

<p>J am now not doing anything but telling about sense in living,
sense from living, sense of living, sense for living, sense about
living in men and in women. I am telling everything to be away
where I am not just now learning so that I am going to be
completely telling all I am knowing about sense for living in men
and women and I am not yet doing this thing and I am not yet really
certain that I am now going to be having everything away so that I
will be telling this thing. I certainly do not now certainly know
this thing. I am putting everything away from me in me so that I
shall be soon telling all this thing. I will now go on putting
everything a little more away from me in me so that I certainly
will not be telling anything that is not this thing. Hike this
thing putting everything away from me in me so that I will be
telling this thing. I will tell this thing. Certainly I will tell
this thing. Pretty nearly everything is away now and I am very
nearly telling this thing. I am certainly not leaving anything not
put away from me inside me so that now I certainly can be telling
something. I certainly can be telling this thing.</p>

<p>I am liking to be thinking about sense for living being in some
of each kind there is in men and in women. I am liking to be
thinking about making kinds of them in men and women in relation to
sense for living being in them. I am liking then as I am saying
just now to certainly be putting everything away so that now I am
thinking kinds this way in men and in women.</p>

<p>Do I know everything of having sense in being living, well, I do
not think I do, I do not know knowing everything about having sense
for living. I have said something about having sense for living. I
am going to be saying something about having sense for living. I
have just been being seeing one certainly having had and having and
perhaps going to be having sense for living. It was interesting to
me to be seeing this one. I saw one having sense for living but
this one was one having sense for each little piece of living and
this never made in this one sense for all the living in this one.
This one had so much sense for each little piece of living this one
was doing that it was astonishing. This one had not really sense
for living for big pieces of living in him. I saw another one and
this one had not had much sense for living but this one had not
then at all really needed this thing, this one then had sense for
living and then it was sense like a good many have it in them a
dull thing in this one as being like a really married one and then
this one had more sense for living and was a very careful one and
then this one came very early in her living to being a really dead
one and not any one was then remembering loving this one as much as
one would have thought from all the being in this one many would be
remembering loving this one.</p>

<p>I am thinking now again of three having really succeeding in
living, really sense for living in them and these have it for a
whole living in them and these do not have it that they are really
learning in being one going on living, these have it in them that
at one time they are realising completely succeeding in living and
they are then really completely succeeding in living, and then they
are realising completely succeeding in living and there are more
seeing them and they have more of a building in which they are then
living and they are then completely succeeding in living, and then
they are realising again succeeding in living and then they have
more again to see them and they have again a bigger building in
which they are then and they are then again completely succeeding
in living and not any at all are they learning anything from having
been at all in any living and so on and so on and these then are
the most wonderfully succeeding ones in living and always they have
not it at all in them to be learning at all anything in being being
living. These then are men and women succeeding in living, having
sense for living, certainly sense for winning, not any sense for
learning from having been one being living, not really sense for
feeling being living, certainly some sense for feeling being
winning, certainly sense for having working under them not any one
going to be winning, not having any sense for trusting any one
working for them, really sense for winning in living, really sense
for always winning a bigger living, always changing to winning a
bigger living, always not learning anything from being one being
living, always then succeeding for living. I am seeing three of
them. One of them is being one making a big business of something,
one of these is making a to be always larger to be for him to be
in, one of these is one everybody is knowing in every country now
that that one is one being living.</p>

<p>Some as I was saying have really sense for living, there are as
many ways of having this thing as there are kinds in men and women
and I have certainly been saying that there are quite a very great
many kinds in men and women.</p>

<p>Some are saying that they have it that they can by remembering
be certain that each one they are knowing were sometime younger
ones. Some are certain that each one they are knowing are getting
to be very old ones. Some are certain that each one they are
knowing are not changing, they were not very much younger ones,
they are not coming now to be very much older ones. There are
different ways of feeling oneself and other ones as to any one
coming to be older, having been younger ones. This and having sense
for living is to me just now very interesting.</p>

<p>Every one being a young one, having been a young one, being an
older one, having been an older one, being an old one and having
been and going on being an old one, having been and going on being
a young one, having been one not an old one not a young one and
going on being not a young one not an old one is to me very
interesting. I cannot really get away from this thing as being
everything there is in any one being one being living. I really
cannot get myself away from this thing. This is any one being
living.</p>

<p>I really am thinking that every one is living in being in some
way one having sense for living, in being in some way one being one
going on being living. Some have come to be not any longer living
ones. Perhaps each one ever living will be coming sometime to be
not any longer one being going on living. Perhaps each one sometime
is not any longer one being in living. I am certainly repeating
this thing which is to me something I am certainly thinking is
perhaps being in every one. Some are changing the size in being in
them in the living in them. I am seeing some doing this thing in
being ones going on being in living. I like seeing every one and
then I very much do not like at all seeing every one. Some have
changing in size in them inside them in being in them, some are not
changing in the size in them in the being of them inside them.
There is one she has been changing the size in being inside her in
living and this one is not a young one is not an old one. There is
one and this one is almost an old one is changing the size in her
in being and this one was really a fat one and is now quite
entirely a thing one, this one then is one changing being in this
one and this one is really not a fat thin one but really then a
really thin one and then this one is quite dull then to any one
listening to being in that one. And some one is a thin one, that
one was not a young one not an old one and this one was a funny one
in being one being in being in him a fat one.</p>

<p>I certainly pretty nearly like being in each one. I do not like
listening too many days one after the other to some. I am now doing
this thing. I will then know something. Each one always is
repeating. This is certain that each one always is repeating all
the being in that one. This sometimes is quite a dull thing for me
when I am listening, not that each one is repeating all the being
in them that is never to me a dull thing but the thing they are
repeating can be to me quite a dull thing.</p>

<p>I am still not telling all I know about sense for living.
Perhaps I am not yet quite ready to be telling everything about
this thing. This then is going to commence again being the history
of every one and among them of the Herslands and the Dehnings.</p>

<p>Sense for succeeding in living, sense for feeling being in
living, sense for being one going to be going on being living,
these three are different things, quite entirely different things
and some having one have the others, some have almost none of any
of them, some have some of one of them, I am thinking just now of
one having some sense for succeeding in living, some sense for
feeling being one being living, not any sense for being one going
to be going on being living. This is one and I am feeling this one.
Some will be remembering this one, some will not be remembering
this one. I am feeling this one. This one is one certainly having
some sense for succeeding in living, is one having certainly really
sense for being one feeling being living, is one having certainly
having certainly never been having any not any sense for being one
going to be going on being living. Mrs. Hersland, Mrs. Alfred
Hersland was one having as I was saying sense for being one going
to be going on being living. Mrs. Hersland, Mrs. Alfred Hersland,
Julia Hersland was one then quite different from this one I am just
now describing.</p>

<p>This one I am just now describing, this one I am just now really
feeling is one then really having sense for really succeeding in
living, is one having sense for really feeling that that one is
really being in living, is one being really in living, is one not
ever having been being one going on being living. As I am saying
any one will not then when this one is not any longer being in
living, will not be remembering really this one having been being
in living. This description then is a description of this one. This
one then is one really feeling being in living, really this one is
really being this, this thing, being one really feeling being in
living, really feeling all the being this one was being in being
living, this one then really was quite entirely in the living this
one had in being one being living, feeling of all being this one
was in being living. Am I really then saying this thing that I am
now feeling in the being being in this one, that this one was and
in a way it was sometimes quite a completely bubbling thing that
this one had sense for some succeeding in being one being living,
it was sometimes quite very often entirely a thing that any one
really could be remembering that this one was really perhaps having
quite sense enough for succeeding in living and this one certainly
was then feeling all the being this one was in being one being
living. This one was then as I was saying not really at all like,
quite different then from the being in Julia Hersland. I will tell
now more about both of them.</p>

<p>This one is then one I am now knowing completely in being one, I
am being that one, completely realising the being in this one. I
really did not think I would be so soon doing this thing, realising
being in this one, and then I was, I am realising the being in this
one and I like realising the being in this one, and I will be
remembering this one although I am not sure that I can be certain
to be really realising remembering this one. I will though
certainty be remembering this one, yes I will be remembering this
one, really I am certain of this thing, I certainly will be
remembering this one, I am certain of this thing.</p>

<p>I am feeling now in every one the sense for being one being in
living that each one has in them and the way each one has that
sense in them and the way each one is beginning being one being one
succeeding being one not succeeding in everything, being one
beginning and going on and ending in being one being living.</p>

<p>I am feeling very much sense for living in men and in women, in
every one I am seeing doing being in living, being one going on
being living, I am feeling very much this thing when I am seeing
one being a young one, when I am seeing some one being not a very
young one, when I am seeing somebody who is quite certainly not a
young one, when I am seeing any one.</p>

<p>Very many have been here living and talking and some of them
have been very much loving some one, and all of them have it in
them to have some sense in being one being living. Some of them are
not very interesting to very many knowing them in being in the way
that one is one having some sense in being one being living. Very
many have then been here and are living and are having each one
some sense for living and some of them are quite successful ones in
being living and very many of them are quite enough successful in
being living to be going on being those being living in being
living. Very many then are here and have it in them very many of
them to have some sense in being one being living and very many of
them are succeeding in living so that until their ending they are
those being those going on being living. There are then very many
here and mostly each one of them of these that are here have it in
them to have in them some sense in being one being living and very
many of them are succeeding in being living, are succeeding in
living so that each one of them of these are those going on being
living until there is naturally a complete end to being in them.
There were a number here, some of them have been loving some one
quite a good deal in being one having some sense in being living,
in being one being living, in being one succeeding well enough in
being living to be going on being one being living. There are then
often very many here and each one of them, that is certainly quite
a number of them, some perhaps not and I am not just now telling
about them, mostly then very many of them have it in them to have
some sense in them in being one being living, some of them as I was
saying quite a good deal sometimes are loving some one, quite a
number of them as I am saying are succeeding well enough in being
living to be of them and there are very many of them always living
a very great many of them always being living who have it to be
succeeding enough in being living to be of them those who are going
to go on being in living until they are not any longer being
living. This is then sense in being living in very many who are
here very often, this is the way they have sense in being living in
them. As I was saying Julia Hersland and Alfred Hersland were not
such a man and such a woman. No they were not really of such of
them, they were really of such of them they did go on being living,
they were not of such of them, in a way they did not go on being
living, they were as I was saying a little differently in them each
one of them from the other one of them as to sense for living. As I
was saying Julia Hersland had not really sense for being one being
living, as I was saying she had strength for being one going on
being living, as I was saying Alfred Hersland was one having some
little sense for being one being living, as I was saying he was not
ever really very much living in this thing in the sense for being
one being living that there was a little in him. As I was saying
they were both of them nearly succeeding, nearly altogether failing
in being those being in living. I am not yet certain that I am
finished with general telling about sense for being in living in
men and women. I am almost certain that I am now really interested
in this thing. There are then very many here, who have it in them
to have some sense in them in being one being living, some of such
of them quite often are really loving some one, very many of them
are succeeding in being one being living well enough to be one
going on in being one being living.</p>

<p>There were to-night eight of them and each one of them had in
them some ways of not having any sense for living at all in them.
There were eight of them and each of them have very much of not any
of some kind of sense for living in them. I was telling one of them
this thing in telling this one how he had sense for living so that
he would be completely succeeding in being one being living. This
one had sense for living in being one being quite certain from
experiencing that in being living he could be one succeeding in
living, be one having some feeling for being one being living. He
is then one having certainly in him from experience in being one
being living a realisation that in being one being living one can
be one succeeding in living. This one has not been in living very
penetratingly making any other one feel this thing, this one has
certainly quite entirely learnt to be realising that he could be
succeeding in being one being in living. This one is then one
having really sense for being living. This one is one having it in
him to certainly be succeeding quite some in living. This is one
then having it in him to be realising that he can be, that he will
very likely be succeeding some in living. He is one as I am saying
having other people knowing this thing with him but then it is not
an exciting thing, really not to him, really not to any one, he has
been learning this thing, he has always been quite certain that he
is working, he is certainly one always having been quite liking to
be where he would be when he could be learning to be really
realising that he was certainly to be one succeeding some in being
living. I was telling this one then that this one really had sense
for living in him. It was not at all an exciting thing telling this
to him. I told it to him and always then I was certain that that he
had some sense for living was not at all a thing to give to him to
give to any one enough excitement so that any one could go on
telling him this thing, telling him that he had sense really for
living.</p>

<p>As I was saying there were eight of them and each one of them
had it in them to have in them in a way not any sense for living,
and I have told about one of these eight of them that she had not
any sense for being one going to be going on being one being
living. This one then was a dead one and then this one was moving a
little then but then that was not really a disturbing thing, no not
to me even, now when I am not any longer a quite young one.</p>

<p>There were then eight of them and one of them had really not
really at all any sense for being one being living, not any sense
at all really for being one ever having, ever being, ever going to
be living. This one then certainly never had been having, never
would have been having, never should have been having any sense at
all in being one being living. This one was one really in a way not
failing in living, this one was one to whom in a way one would be
listening and then this one was a completely one not having ever
been having any sense in being one being living and then not any
one was listening to this one. It would have been an astonishing
thing that any one could be having not any sense for living as this
one was having this thing, it would have been an astonishing thing
if so many had not been coming so nearly to listening to this one
so that they did not really realise that not any one could listen
to this one. This one really is an astonishing one, this one really
has not any sense in being one being living. I will tell very much
about such a one. This one was not certain that this one was one
really being living and really this one was not such a one and this
one was a beautifully astonishing one in being one really being one
to whom very many were almost listening and being one being so
completely one not having anything of having any sense in being one
being living. This one really was one being beautifully
astonishing. I know this one.</p>

<p>There were then eight of them. One was one having sense for
living in being one not knowing what kind of sense for living very
many very like this one are having in being living. This one had
really then sense for living in being one not knowing the sense for
living some like this one have in them and then too not knowing
this thing made of this one quite a foolish one, made of this one a
stupid one that was a quite funny thing when one was knowing this
one.</p>

<p>There were as I was saying eight of them having in them each one
of them some ways of not having any sense in being living in them.
One of them was one having sense for being living in him enough so
that he never came to have responsibility which would crush him. He
could have been quite certainly a worried one but really in his
living he was one who was almost not at all a worried one. He had
then sense for living in having been in all living certain to be
one who would have been a worried one if he had not been one not
becoming a worried one. He was one then having sense for living, in
being one feeling being living enough to have sense for living so
that he did not in living by trying for all living become a worried
one. He was quite entirely a really nice one this one and he had
sense for living to the really living everything any one could need
from him. He was certainly quite entirely a complete one, a very
nice one, a one not having come to be a married one, and he had
sense for being one being living not having come to be a married
one, he was one not having sense for living in being one not
needing to have been coming to be a married one. I cannot help
mentioning it again that he was really a very nice one to have been
going on and not be a worried one and be a living one, a very nice
one with sense for living, with not sense for living. There is
another one then the sixth one having so much sense for living and
so little sense for living that it is a sweet delight in this one
this thing to every one, no really not to every one, I cannot
really say it is a sweet delight this in this one to every one, it
is such a thing certainly to some. There is another one having
certainly sense in living and certainly this one would be having a
good deal of sense for any living if this one in telling about
sense for living was not then forgetting to be living in having
sense for living. This is enough about this one. There is another
one and that one then makes complete the eight of them and this one
has sense for living and this one is as big as all the world will
be when it is a completed one, in beginning feeling and this one is
then completing the world then being all in him and this one then
is then really inside him is then having really completely sense in
being living and this one then does not then complete the world to
make of it a complete one and this one then has still sense for
being living, this one then has not sense in being one being
living.</p>

<p>I am now going to be telling that Julia Dehning and Alfred
Hersland were living in their house and having some kind of married
living in them then.</p>

<p>I am interested in having sense for being in living in men and
women, I am interested in men and women succeeding in living, I am
interested in men and women being married ones and being ones
having or not having sense of being in married living, in being
ones succeeding in being married ones, succeeding in married
living.</p>

<p>I am very much interested in men and women having sense for
being ones being in being living, for men and women having sense
for being ones succeeding in being living, succeeding feeling being
living, succeeding in winning anything in being one being living,
succeeding in living to themselves to any one, in men and women
being married ones. I am very much interested now in this thing, in
these things in men and women, I am interested just now in every
one. I am interested in every one in having in them sense for being
one being in living. I like very much just now looking at any one,
at every one, I like very much just now to be reading about any one
having been doing anything, I like very much just now hearing about
anyone being in living, about any one having been doing, being
doing anything, I like seeing pictures of any one and I like very
well knowing everything I can be knowing about every one. I like
this thing just now, I am liking just now knowing about every one
that each one is having or not having in some ways sense in being
one being living and that each one is in some way being one
succeeding, not succeeding, not going to be succeeding, pretty
nearly succeeding, not at all succeeding, perhaps going to be
succeeding, pretty nearly succeeding, almost succeeding, succeeding
or not at all succeeding or not succeeding or very well succeeding
in living. I like it as I am saying just now knowing about each one
in any kind of married living they have in them. It would be such a
pleasant thing to very many thinking, feeling, telling about men
and about women to have it in them to be just now, to be often
liking to be thinking about men and about women having in them some
sense, not any sense for being in living, some sense and very
little sense and very much sense for being ones succeeding in
living. It would be then a little to them that it would be a
pleasant thing for them to be certain that very many men and very
many women are always being just now being living.</p>

<p>This then is in me just now in my feeling and I am telling this
thing and I am feeling that just now there are very many men and
very many women married ones, that there are just now very many men
and very many women having in them sense for being feeling
themselves and sometimes some one and sometimes some and sometimes
themselves to them as being in being living and there are men and
women living just now and having in them hardly any sense for being
one being in living, and that men and women are having or are not
having sense for being ones succeeding in being living, succeeding
in living. I am then telling now of being in men and in women. I am
telling now about some being married men, some men, and some being
married women, some women. I am telling now about some having in
some ways sense for being ones being living, some having in some
ways sense for succeeding while they are being in living, I am
telling something now about every one. I am telling very much now
about being married in some who are just now living in being
married ones. I know some of such of them just now and I am now
going to be telling something about each one of them. This then
will be more description of Mr. and Mrs. Hersland being married
ones, of other ones being married ones.</p>

<p>I am thinking about some who are living. Some of these are
married ones in living. Some of these are not married ones in
living. I am thinking about some who are living. Some of these
certainly have not been ever married ones in living, some of these
have certainly sometime been married ones in their living, some of
these certainly have been sometimes married ones in living. I am
thinking about some who are living. I am thinking about a good many
who are living. Some who are living are going on being living, some
who are living are not going to be going on being living. I am
thinking about a very great many who are living, some of these are
liking very well being in living, some are not really liking it
that they are being in living. I am then thinking very much about a
great many who are living. Some of these as I have been saying have
in a way sense in being in living, some of these as I have been
saying have in a way not sense really for being in being living.
Some of these as I have been saying are living just now and I am
knowing them just now when they are doing this living, some of them
are certainly living just now and I am not knowing them just now
doing their living. I am then certainly just now thinking about
very many men and very many women being living. Some as I am
saying, some men and women are married ones in living and some are
not married ones in living. Some as I am saying are married ones
again and again in their living, some as I am saying are not at all
ever married ones in their living. Some then certainly are
sometimes married ones in their living. Being a married one is an
interesting thing to me I am certain. Being married ones is an
interesting thing to some, is not a very interesting thing to some.
Being a married one is an interesting thing sometime to some one
and is not an interesting thing sometime to that one. Being a
married one is more is less an interesting thing to some one in the
living being in that one. Some then are certainly sometime in their
living a married one. Some being sometime in their living a married
one are sometime finding that thing an interesting thing in them to
them. In a way being a married one was an interesting thing to
Alfred Hersland in a way it was not an interesting thing to him.
Being a married one was in a way a very interesting thing to Julia
Hersland, in a way it was not a very interesting thing to Julia
Hersland.</p>

<p>I am thinking just now certainly thinking just now about some
men, about some women. I certainly am just now thinking about men
and about women. I certainly am just now thinking about some men, I
certainly am just now thinking about some women. I am not certain
that I cannot very soon have finished writing a complete history of
all men and all women. This is a new feeling for me to have in me.
This is a new thing to be inside me, this that I am not certain
that I will not have very soon now have brought to a completion all
the history of all men and all women so completely that not any
more ever can be as a new thing written. This is a new feeling to
have in me. I am not really certain I am going to be liking to have
this as a thing to be completely in me. Perhaps I will be certain I
am knowing completely everything of being in men and in women. It
would be an exciting thing to be certain really of this thing
having had the complete history of every one already finished in
writing. I will not be having it as certain this thing, I will go
on being one every day telling about being being in men and in
women. Certainly I will be going on being one telling about being
in men and women. I am going on being such a one.</p>

<p>I am wondering whether each one is an interesting thing in being
one being living. I am wondering about this thing.</p>

<p>I am knowing some one wanting that each one is certain that
everything is in the world to any one being living. I know another
one who is certain that not very many things are in the world to
any one being really living. I know some one who asks questions
always about these things and I am remembering the words that one
is using in asking about everything in asking about anything. That
one is wondering whether any one is having anything in being one
being really living. I am wondering whether this one is one really
being almost now a quite old one. I am wondering just now whether I
am not already really understanding all the being there ever can be
in any man and any woman. I am almost being certain that I am
understanding all being ever having been, ever being, ever going to
be in any man, in any woman. I am almost certain I am understanding
just now everything about being in men and women.</p>

<p>I am certain I do not know completely yet all the detail of all
the kinds there are of men and women. I am almost certain I am
understanding just now all there is of being in men and in women
when they are beginning, when they are in middle living, when they
are ending.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that I am realising just now being being in
all men and in all women and the way this is in them in each one of
them. I am understanding just now very much and I am not just now
telling very much. I will soon now certainly be telling very much.
Thinking about sense in being in living in men and women, thinking
about some being and some not being married ones in being living
has been to me a thing I have been very completely enjoying. I am
now one knowing being being in men and in women.</p>

<p>I am thinking about some being and some being not married ones
in being living, I am thinking about some being completely not
married ones in being living, I am thinking now about every one. I
will be telling just now about being being in every one.</p>

<p>It is a funny thing to me, a peculiar thing that each one is not
knowing that living is what is certainly in them and each other one
is one being one having it in them that they are ones being living.
I know that each one very often is really forgetting this thing
that one is one having it that that one is one having being living
as being and that every other one each one is one having being in
them of being one being living. Mostly every one is sometime
forgetting this thing about that one, about every one.</p>

<p>And so then I am knowing everything because really I am not ever
forgetting this thing that I am one being one having living in
being and that every one is having it in that one that that one is
having living being in being that one.</p>

<p>I am then one in a way certainly one knowing everything. Some
are ones in a way knowing everything. Some are ones not in a way
knowing everything. Some are knowing that some are in a way ones
knowing everything. Some are never feeling anything about any one
knowing everything. Mostly every one is sometime, is sometimes
feeling about some one in a way knowing everything. Alfred Hersland
was the one then Julia Dehning was marrying. She married him as one
she was marrying. He was one being one she was marrying, she was
one being one he was marrying and each one of them was the one the
other one was marrying and loving then. Each one of them was
marrying the other one needing that one then and loving that one
then. Each one of them then married the other one needing that one
then for loving and living and being then being the one they were
needing to be being in living.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning married Alfred Hersland. They were married and
living then not very successfully to each of them married living.
It is certain that each one of them was needing the other one then
for being in living what each one of them was needing for being in
living in them. Each one of them was then being in living and was
then certain to be needing being in living. Each one of them was
succeeding was failing in living. Not either of them had in a way
really sense for living in being living. Each one of them in a way
would be certain to be going on being in living. Each one of them
was going on being in living.</p>

<p>Julia was one as I was saying one needing to be one being going
on being living. Julia was such a one all her living. All her
living she was one needing to be going on being one being living.
All her living she was one as I have been saying one needing to be
one going to be going on being living. So then Julia was married to
Alfred Hersland. She married him and was loving him and was certain
then and not by thinking about this thing that she was one going to
be going on being living. This was being in her then. This was
always being in her all her living.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning then married one she was needing then for the
being in her that was being one who was needing to be certainly
always going on going to be living. This was being in her and she
was then not thinking about this thing. Alfred Hersland then as I
was saying was thinking about being one being aspiring in being
succeeding in living. They were married ones Julia and Alfred
Hersland. This is to be now more history of some coming to know
them.</p>

<p>It is not such a very difficult thing going on being living as
it seems to be to some thinking about this thing about going on
being living. It is quite an easy thing for a great many having
living being in them. This is a thing to surprise some that really
this thing is not a difficult thing. To some it is quite a
difficult thing being one going on being living. To very many, for
very many it is not at all a very difficult, to quite some it is
not the very least bit a really difficult thing, to be one going on
being one being living, being in being living.</p>

<p>To some it is quite a surprising thing that it is not a very
difficult thing to very many, being ones going on in being ones
being in living. Julia Hersland certainly all her living was one
being one going on being living, as I am saying she was not having
it really in her to be from being in her one having really sense in
being to herself being in living, in having really sense for living
from being in her, from having been in living all her living. She
was one certainly though going to be all her living going on being
living. She was one really not from being in her being one
succeeding in living, succeeding in being living to her inside her,
she was one certainly going to be from being in her one going to be
going on being one going to be living all of her living, that is
certain. When she was ending she would come of course to be one not
any longer being in living but that would be simply that she had
come then sometime to be a dead one, not that she had ever come to
be one not going to be going on being one going on being living.
Really then she was one as I was saying needing learning anything
because anything could be feeding her to be one going to be going
on being living and indeed then she was one needing to be resisting
really learning anything to be at all changing attacking being in
her which was in her to make of her being one going to be all her
living going on being living. This is in a way a full description
of her, there can be more description of her. This will be some
more description of her.</p>

<p>Certainly some are in their living married ones. Certainly there
are some having it in being that they are ones going to be going on
being living and these can have it in them to be in living
attacking to be winning, these can have it in living to be learning
something. Some of such of them can have it to be learning
something more and more in living, some can have it in them to be
really learning the same thing again and again. Julia as I was
saying really was not learning anything and this is a nice thing to
be certain of in thinking out being being in Julia all her living.
Julia was then as I was saying one needing being one having it that
she was learning anything. She was completely then when she was
doing this thing marrying Alfred Hersland. She liked it a little
then and then it went on to come to be quite soon a beginning of a
long ending, a long dividing of themselves from living with each
other any more in being in living.</p>

<p>Pride and egotism and vanity and ambition and succeeding and
failing I like to think about now in each one. I like thinking
about pride and egoism and vanity and ambition and failing and
succeeding in each one I am knowing because it is very interesting
to know these things being in those having these things in
them.</p>

<p>I was just telling some one interesting things about each one of
them in that family having it in them that egotism in them did not
in them make them doing very well the thing they had some talent to
be doing. One of these had it in that one to be one having some
talent to be working to be interesting in something to every one
and this one had it in him to have it that for him in him he was
one living in being one needing to have it that he was one being
one having pride in having been possibly beginning something and
this one was an unhappy one inside him when he was a young one and
quite a thin one and then he was one coming to be a rather heavy
set one and some thought that then he was coming to be a quite
happy one but happiness was not then in him. He knew this then, his
brother and his sister all of them were certain of this thing then.
One of these had it that she had vanity completely in her as
egotism in her and she had then a pride in feeling this to be there
concealed inside her and egotism filled this one to keep vanity in
her with pride to keep it from being a trouble to her as knowledge
to any one of her and this one was one having been going to be and
being to herself and some a distinguished woman in being one
leading some one only nobody was ever really following that one and
this one was one really to herself and to every one one not having
it as being to be one going on being living, and this one was dying
in having slowly less and less leading in her of some one with not
any one following and this one then would have been listening while
I was telling her this thing only just then her mind certainly was
wandering and not any one then was following this mind in her being
then wandering. This is one I will perhaps not be ever seeing again
and yet as she might say perhaps I will, who knows certainly then
that I will not ever see this one again. There was another one of
these that had it in her to be one quite ordinarily wallowing and
engulfing in loving and ordinary enough in being not a very stupid
one and like a good many in being one giving and taking and this
one had it that egotism in her was not having any reinforcing for
any of this being that was being in her but was in her as being to
her that she was one needing to be one doing everything any one was
needing and this one was then an unhappy one and a rich one and
every one was flattering this one and every one was quite certain
that this one would always be living and they would always be
flattering this one to keep this one as one going on being living
and sometime there will be histories and histories written of these
women and these men. One of this family was really succeeding in
living having it in him that egotism in him went to make him into
complete carrying out power in him to be a busy man coming to be a
very rich one and so this one had effective ambition in him and
this one was a dead one when he was not a very old one and some
were not really very sorry that this one was a dead one although
not any one was really very glad that this one was a dead one.</p>

<p>Julia Hersland and Alfred Hersland neither one of them were at
all like the family of women and men I have been just describing.
Julia Hersland was one going on being in being living, Alfred
Hersland was one not failing not succeeding in living, not having
altogether not any sense for living, not having really sense for
living, was one who was twice a married one and was one who was
sometimes a very loving one. Julia was one who might have been
twice a married one but really she was only once a married one and
she was in a way a loving one. This is to be now a more detailed
account of what happened in their living in each one of them, to
each one of them. Alfred Hersland married Julia Dehning and was
then living in married living in a way in Dehning family living. He
had then later help from Mr. Dehning so that he could be having
what he knew then he was needing to be one succeeding in living. He
was not then succeeding in living and Mr. Dehning came then to be
certain that Alfred Hersland was one not honest enough for any, for
him, daily living. Julia Hersland had been, before Mr. Dehning was,
certain of this thing certain of this thing about Alfred in her
married living with him. Mrs. Dehning was certain then that Julia
never should have been allowed to be married to him and this was in
her then a very certain thing.</p>

<p>Julia Hersland was the wife of Alfred Hersland and was not
coming to having successful married living with him. She had
children, two children, she came to know very well David Hersland
brother of Alfred Hersland. She did not ever marry again as Alfred
Hersland did. She might have done this thing. Now I go on with him,
then I go on with her. I am going on with him, then I am going on
with her.</p>

<p>Hersland had not then when Mr. Dehning was helping him, had not
succeeded in beginning really successful living, he was then one
not to every one failing in living, he was then certainly one
having been one, Mr. Dehning was certain any one could be
understanding, as not being one honest for daily living in any
living any one Mr. Dehning was having with him could be living in,
any one Mr. Dehning was knowing in daily living could be having as
being in daily living with such a one. Hersland then and Julia
Hersland were living then in married living, Mr. Dehning was then
certainly not ever seeing Hersland then, he was not ever then
entering in any house where Hersland was living then. Did Hersland
ever know certainly that Julia would be certain that Hersland was
not what Julia was needing for honest daily living if Julia had not
been certain by reason of having a father still living in Dehning
family living, did Hersland really ever believe this thing that
Julia was certain of this and not by having because of her father
being one making Dehning living Dehning living feeling of honest
being not being in Hersland in some living of daily living in him,
was Hersland really not ever in him certain of this thing, of this
being certain in Julia that she would not be needing the being in
him for any daily living even if she had not then had a father
living making Dehning family living, Julia was certain that
Hersland might have been certain of this thing, Julia was certain
that he would be certain of this thing and that then he would not
be saying he was certain of this thing, Mr. Dehning was certain
enough that Hersland was certain of this thing, Mrs. Dehning was
certain to be talking on and on to herself and to Julia and to
every one in Dehning family living who was then not listening and
that was every one then about being certain about this thing and
David Hersland who was later then talking about this thing to Julia
and George and a little sometime to Hortense Dehning was certain
that Alfred was one who was not certain that to be dead was to be
really a dead one and David Hersland was a young man then and was
completely then hoping to be discovering this thing as certain in
Alfred Hersland that Alfred Hersland was not certain that to be
dead was to be really and truly a really dead one. So then there
was then married living and having been having children and a
father-in-law and a mother-in-law and a brother-in-law and a
sister-in-law both quite young ones and a brother then in Alfred
Hersland's living and Julia Hersland and not really failing to
every one knowing him then and not really beginning being
succeeding to himself then and beginning to know some then who came
to see him then and not ever seeing Mr. Dehning then but some
seeing of Mrs. Dehning then and some seeing of George Dehning then
and some living then in the house with him of his brother David
Hersland who was studying in Bridgepoint just then. He came later
in his living to know other ones and as I was saying he was not in
his living succeeding or failing. To some he was quite a good deal
succeeding, to some he was quite a good deal failing, to himself he
was a good deal succeeding, sometimes he was telling about being a
good deal succeeding in living, sometimes he was to himself a good
deal failing in being in living. He knew very well in all of his
living Patrick Moore, and later Minnie Mason. Later he married
Minnie Mason. As I was saying he was not failing, certainly not
altogether succeeding in being in living. Later he had about almost
completely an angry feeling in not liking Mr. Dehning and Mrs.
Dehning and Julia Dehning, and George Dehning and Hortense Dehning
and mostly then he was certain that he had loving feeling in him,
that he had and had had and could have and would have some loving
feeling for Julia Hersland and her children and he was then needing
completely to be one being living loving Minnie Mason who had been
a married one and later was one married to him. He was one almost
one to himself, to some, to his brother David Hersland, to several,
sometimes almost not to any one having that he had had, did have,
would have loving feeling for Julia Hersland and her children. He
was one as I am saying who was not ever one having it being needing
having ambition in being one being living from the resisting, from
the engulfing being that was being in him. He was one having
ambition in intention and aspiration from being one having vanity
in him from engulfing being that was in him not winning being in
living. He was then a man having people liking him in living,
having people despising him in living, having some people loving
him in living, having some people liking him pretty well, having
some people certainly not liking to have him being liked by them.
He was one who had married living with Julia Hersland, with Minnie
Hersland. He was one knowing very well some men and working with
some men. He was one not having enough sense for living for
anything really more than being married to Minnie Mason, than for
working pretty well sometime with some men, than for being almost
persuading his brother David that he Alfred had really some loving
being always in him. He had not sense for living enough for having
aspiration and ambition and being marrying Julia Dehning and being
persuading Mr. Dehning to be almost believing that he Alfred
Hersland needed something that Mr. Dehning could give him to be
beginning to be succeeding in living and being one making Mrs.
Dehning willing to have him be petted by her in Dehning family
living and make her later then a very nervous one. So then Alfred
lived and went on living and ended one having in him not enough
sense for living to be one failing, to be one succeeding in living.
He was one ending being in living having loving feeling in him,
being a married one, having been really working quite well with
some men, being pretty nearly a completely hated one in Dehning
family living, being certainly a completely hated one in Dehning
family living and being then a tradition as a hated one not honest
in daily living in Dehning family living; and then Julia Hersland
was dead and I am not finding it very interesting knowing what was
happening later to the children of Alfred and Julia Hersland. He
did not have any children in his married living with Minnie
Mason.</p>

<p>Julia had complete courage as being one certainly going to be
going on being living. Julia had sweetness in her that was very
certain to some coming to know her. Julia had honesty in being one
having in her Dehning family living and being then stamping that
thing with her being one certainly very certain to be one going on
being living. She was one needing to be learning anything,
everybody came to know this thing, every one comes to know this
thing in knowing this one in living, Julia had certainly courage in
living sweetness in living to some knowing being being in her in
all of her living as she was going on being one going on certainly
being living. Alfred never came to be loving her as being one
certainly having sweetness in her to some knowing being being in
her, in a way Alfred was not loving her as being one certainly
going to be going on being living, in a way he was loving her as
being one going to be going on being living. He was loving her some
then as being one certainly going to be going on being one being
living, he was certainly loving her some as one being one certainly
needing to be learning anything, he was certainly loving her some
as one attacking but not really for winning, he was one loving her
some for being one not really winning by being attacking, he was
really not loving her for being one resisting learning really
anything so that she could not have any changing in being one
attacking, he was one not really coming to be hating Dehning family
living and always then he could have a very angry temper about this
thing. He was one really then not having really hating really ever
in him, she could have hating him come to be in her, the Dehning
family could have a tradition of hating him be in them as a thing
they might have been inheriting, the Hersland family could mostly
not be feeling hating them the Dehning family very personally in
them.</p>

<p>Julia came then later to be really completely separated from
him, she came then to be going on being living, she might have then
come to be marrying some one, she did not then come to be marrying
any one, that was in a way an accidental thing, she might have come
then to be marrying one, she did not then marry that one, she went
on certainly being one going on being living, she was succeeding
well enough then in going on being in living, she had children as I
have been saying and as I said of them I am not finding it to me at
all an interesting thing to be telling just now about living coming
to be more and more in them.</p>

<p>So then there has been written some history of Julia and Alfred
Hersland, there will be written now a little more detailed
description of living being in each one of them with the people
knowing each one of them.</p>

<p>Some are quite certain that they have some friend, some friends
who are stronger than they are to do some thing but then these are
ones doing the thing in a way that is not for that thing a
completely perfect way of doing that thing and that one who is not
such a strong one as a friend of his is in doing that thing is one
doing that thing to make that thing a completer thing. In his
beginning in living important living Alfred Hersland had not at all
in him to him such a feeling about any other one. Later in his
living after he was married to Minnie Hersland and she helped him
with Pat Moore to tell him this to be inside him he could then know
a little in him that he had friends stronger than he was in doing
something. He never had this really completely in him but at
moments in his later living he had it almost completely inside,
him. Only at moments in his later living as I was saying and then
not really completely inside him but somewhat certainly in his
later living at moments then when Pat Moore was not so intimate but
still pretty intimate with him and Minnie Mason was married to him
he had this pretty nearly completely at moments inside him that he
had friends, that he certainly had a friend stronger than he at
doing some thing for living but that he himself had it in him to do
that thing and to do it very perfectly very perfectly indeed, very
completely indeed, very completely certainly completely and
perfectly and he knew this at moments in him and he told it to his
children who were the children of Julia Hersland sometimes when he
sometimes for a little time saw one of them. He was then one
certainly not failing, pretty nearly really succeeding then in his
later living. Patrick Moore in a way admired him and Alfred
Hersland in a way was always all his living knowing him.</p>

<p>Patrick Moore was one in a way succeeding very well in living.
There was another one who was knowing Alfred Hersland some then.
Mackinly Young was knowing him then but that was because Young was
knowing Moore a little and was going to be a musician. Then there
was James Flint who knew Alfred Hersland quite well and then knew
Julia Hersland and then knew David Hersland very well and he knew
Minnie Mason very well and Alfred Hersland met her then. James
Flint always more or less all his living knew Moore and he knew
David Hersland as long as David was living, not seeing him very
often but always knowing him. I will begin now continuing the
history of Alfred Hersland and Julia Hersland and of some who came
to know them. I am beginning coming to the beginning of the ending
of my description of Alfred and Julia Hersland. To begin then.
Mackinly Young knew Moore a little. Young was a musician, he was
certainly serious in that profession, he certainly was serious in
going to be one going to be making something important in musical
composition. There are very many who are very serious ones in going
to be doing something in the way of artistic creation. There are
very many who are working many hours every day with serious
intention. Young was one who had it in him to be one always
steadily working, having certainly real feeling in being one
certainly seriously going to be going to do something that would be
certain to be a good thing. He was one having as I was saying power
for steady working. He was one having certainly a sense for being
one certainly being living. He was one not continuing in being
living being one having certainly sense for being one being living
with being one having certainly the power to be day after day
steadily working. He certainly had sense in being one being in
living, he certainly had sense for being one feeling being in
living. This was rising up slowly from the depths of him and mostly
then he was every day steadily working and this which was really
sense for being in living which was really in him was so slowly
rising in him that he being one steadily seriously earnestly
continuously working made for him a cover to him and sense in being
one being really living rather did not make any more than a
touching of this thing the cover of him which was being one
completely seriously steadily working. Let me explain again. This
one then was as I was saying a man and his name was Mackinly Young.
He was a musician. He was completely seriously working every day in
his living. He was certain that he needed to be one to be really
living to be one creating something in writing music that certainly
would be a thoroughly good thing. This one Mackinly Young was one
having certainly a feeling of being one really being living, he was
one being really in being living, he was one having certainly sense
in being living. He was one seeing with his thinking, feeling in
his working that everything he was learning was really something
and each day in his living he was really learning something. He was
one certain that everything he was learning was something he could
be using to be doing the thing he seriously was certain he needed
to be doing to be one really being in living. He was one steadily
learning more and more and always then when he was composing the
only thing that was anything were things that really were not
anything, were just suggestions of there being somewhere inside
that one a sense really in being living. Not anything this one was
learning was coming into connection with the sense of being one
being living that was in this one. It was this way with this one.
This one in seriously steadily daily working was really a practical
man that is to say each thing he was learning was for the doing of
something. He was one always working and really then he could do
that thing he certainly had been learning but then that was not
creation. No certainly not, that was not creation. And yet sense
for living was in him but it was a thing to rise slowly in him so
slowly that it almost stopped and went so slowly like molasses very
thick that not anything he could be learning could be helping him
with this thing. Not at all and really then it was some sense for
living he certainly had in him but not enough to be one so
seriously so earnestly certain to be winning doing a really
completely good thing, not continuous enough in oozing to be making
sense for him in all the arguments he was always indulging in, just
enough to make him again and again say completely funny penetrating
things, not too penetrating even but thoroughly interesting as
funny things but that again not any too often. He was one then who
if he was not one melancholy by the nature in him or too worrisome
would certainly end up by teaching something and being certain that
the ones he was knowing would never work hard enough or be serious
enough to really do the thing. However he knew Pat Moore very well
and continued to know him. In a way he really liked Alfred
Hersland, he never thought Alfred would really succeed in doing
anything, he thought Pat Moore might succeed very well in living,
he thought James Flint would succeed in living but that was not of
any interest to Young, he continued to know Alfred Hersland for
some years, he came to know Minnie Hersland and he liked her very
well and he always came to see the two of them and always he liked
very much to see Pat Moore quite often. Pat Moore was a very
different kind of a man, this is a description of what he was in
being and in living. Patrick Moore was not a musician but he liked
it that his friends were good at that thing. He was in business and
in a way was a man completely succeeding, excepting when he was
very worried because he was a poor man, was a man quite completely
for the being and the living in him succeeding in living.</p>

<p>Patrick Moore was of the resisting kind of them and his being
was alive and very lively inside of him. His being was completely
alive and quite lively inside him and he was one succeeding in
living excepting when he was worrying about being a poor man a very
poor man sometime in his living and this was a strange thing to be
in him to many that knew him. This is something that is important
in any one coming to know him that he was a man succeeding in
living, being alive inside him and lively inside in him and
worrying sometime that he was a really poor man and not worrying
any one else with this thing. He was never a very poor man but he
was very often as is common not a quite rich one. He was never a
very rich one, he was when he was at the ending of his middle
living and to the end of his living then quite a rich one. He was
married then and his wife was quite a rich one. He was one doing
real estate business and was one almost every one was liking. As I
said of him he had always some admiration for Alfred Hersland and
he was quite certain that Hersland would never be really failing in
living. He had some understanding of Hersland not continuing to be
living with Julia Hersland and loving his children. He had feeling
for Alfred Hersland marrying Minnie Mason. He liked Flint very well
and always was ready to have Flint come to see him. He liked Young
very well and often he did not for a very long time see him. He
admired Young for being one so thoroughly working and working and
arguing. He liked every one very well and very often as I was
saying he was worrying about being a poor man but really he was not
ever troubling any one with this thing. He was as I was saying of
the resisting kind in men and women and as I was saying being was
alive in him always all his living, it was very lively really
inside him. He was one liking some, liking a good many, admiring
some, admiring a good many, he was one very many were liking and he
was one really succeeding in living, he was one having really all
his living livelily in him sense for feeling being one being
living, he was one as I was saying worrying sometimes and for quite
long times about being a poor man, not about being one failing in
living, that was not being in him, but about being a poor man, but,
as I was saying, he was one not really ever worrying any one with
this thing. I will tell more now about him and the other ones in
his being living.</p>

<p>I would certainly like to be knowing it of each one just how
succeeding, just how failing in living comes to be in them in
living from the being in them. I would certainly like to know this
of each one who ever was, who is now living. I certainly would like
to know it about each one just how the being in them connects
itself with any one, with anything, with every one so that that one
is succeeding is failing in living. I certainly cannot tell any one
how very much I would like to know this in each one. I am
completely filled up with wanting to be completely certain about
every one about the being in them and the failing and the
succeeding and the succeeding and the failing they have in them in
their living. I look at every one, I read about each one, I think
about each one, I listen to each one, I listen to about each one, I
listen to any one, I listen to every one, I look at any one, I look
again and again, I listen again and again and again, I am thinking
very often about each one, I certainly would like to know it about
every one about the being in them and the way being in them makes
failing and succeeding in them. I am much less interested in their
being good ones or bad ones, clean ones or dirty ones, rich ones or
poor ones, well-mannered or badly-mannered ones, sick ones or well
ones, I want to know about each one the being in them being in them
to make of them ones succeeding, ones failing.</p>

<p>That is what I want to know about each one, being in them making
of them ones succeeding, ones failing, ones succeeding and failing,
ones failing and succeeding in being in living. This is what I want
to know about each one and I never can know everything and perhaps
I never can know everything about this thing. Very likely I can
never know everything about this thing. That is to me a thing made
of me, one certain to be one some day certainly ending. I like
living but I am certain that I cannot know everything and so I know
certainly that I will be one some day not being any longer living.
This is not to me now a sorrowful thing, this is to me now quite a
certain thing. I like being living, I like too being certain of
something, I am certainly certain of something.</p>

<p>This is to be now a description of successful living of not
successful living being in Pat Moore and Alfred Hersland and
Mackinly Young and James Flint and Minnie Mason and David Hersland.
I tell about successful living about failing in these now because I
want to be telling about it in every one and I cannot just now do
that thing because I do not just now completely know that thing. I
know a good deal now about being in men and women, about being in
some one, in some, in many making in them each one their
succeeding, their failing in being living, in being in living, in
being going on being living. I know this now so that I could have
it in me to know very much about succeeding and failing in men and
women and yet I am not certain I will very soon be knowing really
very much more about this thing. I really have not very much hope
in me that soon I will be knowing very much more about succeeding
and failing being in men and women. I seem just now in me to be a
little, a good deal stopping in being learning about this thing in
men and women. If I tell about being in some men some women making
for them succeeding making for them failing in being living, in
being in living, in being going on being in living, in being going
on living, perhaps then a little I will be beginning again learning
something of being being in men and women making succeeding and
failing in them.</p>

<p>I am getting to find it more and more interesting being one
feeling it in every one the being in them making them to be
succeeding, to be failing in living.</p>

<p>James Flint liked Patrick Moore very well. He admired him. James
Flint began his beginning living as a musician, he ended his
beginning middle living as a manufacturer of clothing. He was a man
certainly succeeding in living and yet not one succeeding well
enough to be at all startling. He was one succeeding in living. He
was one certainly being living in being in living, certainly very
solidly this thing and always then he had a quick way of doing
things in music and manufacturing that were a little quicker than
solid succeeding in him and this then kept him from being one
really quite startlingly being one succeeding in living. He was one
as I was saying completely succeeding in living, being certainly
one solidly attacking in successful winning and always then as I
was saying he was lightly attacking and successfully lightly
attacking quicker then he was solidly attacking and this was in him
in being a musician and this was in him in being one manufacturing
clothing and this was in him and he was one not being at all in his
living an astonishingly successful one. As I was saying he admired
Pat Moore and liked him very well indeed and Moore was one
certainly successful quite well in living and being entirely alive
inside him and very lively inside him with this live being in him.
Not any one was close to Pat Moore in Moore's being alive in being
living and Moore was succeeding well enough in living and not any
one was wanting him to be succeeding any more than he was
succeeding and he was sometimes worrying a good deal about going to
be a very poor man but he never worried any one with this thing and
yet Flint was not quite entirely satisfied with Moore being in his
own living. James Flint certainly was satisfied with being being
alive in Moore and very lively in him and Moore being one
succeeding in living. Flint did not need to have Moore succeed any
more than Moore would be succeeding in living but somehow to Flint
it was as if Moore should have been a little more poignantly
succeeding, that is to say he should not be more poignant in being,
in living, in succeeding but somehow being succeeding as he Moore
was succeeding should have been a more poignant thing to some one,
to any one, not to Moore, not to Flint, not to any woman, not to
any other man, but somehow some way to some one. Flint then in a
way was not completely satisfied with Pat Moore. As I was saying
Flint and Moore knew each other and Flint had come to know Minnie
Mason, Flint was a man a good many came to know in living and
Minnie Mason came to know Moore and Young, and Hersland came to
know her and some years later a number of years later Alfred
Hersland was married to her. They all came to know David Hersland
as was a natural thing. Now I will give a very short description of
Minnie Mason and Minnie with each one of them and Minnie Mason
marrying and married to Alfred Hersland.</p>

<p>Some have sense for living from having realisation in them that
each thing they are knowing is such a thing as it is to them and
really knowing this in them. Some are knowing in them that each
thing they are knowing in living is the thing that thing really is
living.</p>

<p>Some have in them completely the emotion of knowing something is
something without feeling in them that any thing is anything. This
certainly can be in men and women. There are many ways of having
sense for living, sense of being living in them in men and in
women. Some have completely the emotion of something being what
they are needing for being one going on being living and some of
such of them have not at all in them any feeling of any one thing
having it as being the thing they are needing to be having it be to
have them be ones going on being in living, being in living, being
living. Some have some of such feeling and not any such thing, not
any such feeling has any value for them.</p>

<p>I am knowing one who knew Young some and Flint a little and
heard of Moore and came once to dine with Alfred and Minnie
Hersland and this one was one being certain that he was one loving
with intensity a powerful thing and this one was one loving with
intensity the emotion of feeling a thing being a powerful thing and
so this one was always hoping but really never being one doing
anything that gave to him satisfaction. And this is very common. I
am not just now liking every one, not at all, each one is too
completely herself, himself inside her, inside him and repeating
sometimes with some changing, sometimes with more emphasizing,
sometimes with a weakening feeling, sometimes more loudly,
sometimes more faintly the being in that one, and I certainly do
just now not want to be certain of this thing and I am completely
certain of this thing and I know now certainly there are very many,
most every one not wanting to be certain inside them that each one
is repeating always all the being in them being themselves inside
them. I can see just now in me that for very many living this is
not at all a romantic thing this knowing that each one always is
repeating. I know that mostly every one will not ever be really
certain of this thing. I, I am always certain of this thing, I
mostly am all solid in this thing, that is full up, that is
satisfied, that is comfortable, that is interested, that is
noticing, that is stirred by this thing, I will not just now be
mentioning again this thing.</p>

<p>Minnie Mason married Alfred Hersland when he was loving again in
his living and they were succeeding well enough in being in married
living. They went on being in married living. It interested them
enough, it interested some others in the beginning, mostly it was
not so very interesting their being in married living, their
succeeding well enough in married living, Alfred Hersland
succeeding well enough in living, mostly every one they were
knowing succeeding well enough in living. I am interested in this
thing.</p>

<p>Minnie Mason certainly did love very much and very often. She
certainly did very much of this thing. She came to loving one and
being loved by that one and to marrying that one and marrying then
was almost then a successful thing for the two of them. It was not
then a successful thing. She had had come then to almost marrying
another one instead of the one she married then and that would have
been almost a successful thing in having married living. She came
later as I was saying to marrying Alfred Hersland, that was quite a
successful thing in having married living. As I was saying she was
one certainly loving very often, she was one as I was saying
certainly loving very much and as I was saying she certainly did
this thing very often. In a way she went on knowing the one she had
been married to, in a way she went on knowing every one. She knew
James Flint and he knew Patrick Moore and Patrick Moore knew Alfred
Hersland and Minnie Mason married Alfred Hersland. She was as I was
saying in a way knowing every one, she, as I was saying, in a way
went on knowing each one she ever had been knowing. In a way she
went on knowing the one she had been married to, the one she almost
had been marrying, she was then successfully marrying and being in
married living with Alfred Hersland. She was then going on knowing
James Flint and Moore and even Young then as I was saying.</p>

<p>Pat Moore thought it certainly a very good thing that Alfred
Hersland married Minnie Mason. He said to every one he thought it a
very good thing. He did think it to be a very good thing that
Minnie Mason married Alfred Hersland. He knew Minnie and he knew
Alfred and he always went on knowing them and he very often took
dinner with them. Flint did not see any of them very often, he
sometimes saw them. He saw Moore, and he saw Hersland and Minnie
Hersland when he came to see them, Young did not see any of them
often. He did sometimes see them, he did sometimes see Mr. and Mrs.
Hersland and he did once in a while see Moore and once in a while
he saw James Flint. They all thought it was a very good thing that
Hersland and Minnie were married and living contentedly in married
living and were then succeeding quite well in living. Moore was
quite certain that it was a good thing that Hersland and Minnie
were marrying.</p>

<p>Some are very happy loving some one, some are very happy then
loving another one. Some one is very happy in loving one, some one
is very happy in loving and then is very happy in loving another
one. Minnie Mason was such a one. It is quite common to be quite
happy sometime in being loving. It is quite common to be happy in
loving one and to be happy in loving another one. This is quite
common. Minnie was quite happy in loving one and she married that
one and she was quite happy in loving another one and she did not
marry that one and she was quite happy in marrying another one and
she did marry that one. Certainly it was quite right, Moore was
certain of this thing, that any one with the name of Minnie Mason
should be happy in loving some one. Minnie was happy in loving one
and she was happy in loving that one. She married that one, she was
almost then succeeding in married living with that one. She did not
keep on being married to that one, she in a way always was knowing
that one, she in a way always knew it as quite a happy thing in her
living that this one certainly would be doing something when she
asked him to be doing something. She was very happy just then when
she was marrying this one in loving another one and she was never
going to be marrying and she never married that one and she
certainly would have been certainly almost succeeding in married
living with that one. She was in a way all her living knowing this
one, she was in a way certain that this one would be doing anything
she would ask him if she ever would come to asking him to do
something. She was then later as I was saying happy in loving
Hersland. She married him, she was succeeding then in married
living, he was succeeding then in living. She was of the resisting
kind of them but resisting was in her constantly trickling out of
her as steadily trickling attacking, very often she was doing very
much lying as I was saying. She had really sense for living as I
was saying. Resisting being came trickling out of her, there was a
great deal always trickling out of her, it was as attacking being
to mostly every one knowing her, as I was saying she had sense for
living, as I am saying she and Alfred Hersland successfully went on
living in married living until they came one and then the other of
them to be old ones and then dead ones.</p>

<p>Minnie Hersland had had and in a way had not at all had sense
for being in living. She was not in a way continuing in being
living but in a way she was by not stopping being living. She was
then in a way all her living continuing being living, in a way she
was not ever to herself inside her in being being, continuing being
living. Going on being living in men and women in all of them is an
interesting thing. Each one has that in them the way their kind in
men and women can have it to have it in them.</p>

<p>Minnie then all her living was in a way continuing being living,
in a way she was not ever in her being continuing being living. As
I was saying she was loving very much and very often, as I was
saying in a way she had sense really for living, as I was saying
she was in a way always going on knowing any one she ever had been
knowing.</p>

<p>These are all now living these I have been, these I am now
describing. They were then, Alfred Hersland and Julia Hersland and
each one of them knew some who were then doing living. Some have
sense for living by the emotion in them, some have sense for living
by being certain that each thing is existing. Some have not any
sense for living by emotion, by being certain that each thing that
everything is existing, some of such have it in them that they are
certainly going to be going on living. As I was saying Julia
Dehning was one almost not having any sense for living, she was one
certainly going to be going on being living, what I here was in her
of sense for living was sense of living by emotion being in
her.</p>

<p>She did certainly in a way have a little a very little sense of
living from emotion in her, she did certainly have it in her to be
one going to be going on living, this was courage in her to her and
to every one ever knowing her. She did as I was saying have
sweetness of a little having sense for being living by having
really emotion in a way in her, not emotion as loving, emotion as
being in living. She had in a way this really in her.</p>

<p>As I could be saying there are some living to be ones being good
for living, there are some living to be ones making themselves and
others good for living, there are some living because they are
certain that there is some good to some one in their being living,
there are some living certain that each one has some good in
living, there are some living needing to be certain that sometime
some one will be a good one, there are some living hoping sometime
to be certain that some will be good ones in living, there are some
living who are certain that not any one not being a good one is
really being in living, there are some living that are not certain
by their thinking that any way is a good one but they have it in
them to be only able to be living by considering living in the way
of something to be done to be a good one to make some one be a good
one to have it that in living there are there will be good ones,
there are some in living that are certain that they must be one
being a good one, there are all these and then there are as one
might say schools of each one of these ways of being of many being
these things with not much feeling in them of such a thing to make
them be doing much living. I will now tell about Julia Dehning and
a whole lot more of men and women.</p>

<p>Some men are certainly sometime loving a woman. Some women are
certainly sometime loving some man. Some men are sometime certainly
loving some woman. Very many men are thinking the woman they are
loving a very wonderful thing. Very many men are sometime loving,
each one of them, some one. Some of these are not really thinking
the one they are loving to be such a wonderful one. Many women are
sometimes in their living loved by some man, some are needing this
for being one to themselves being living, some are liking such a
thing very well for keeping on being living, some are excited in
this thing, some are certain that they are going on living having
this thing, some are always thinking they are not going on in
living having this thing, and then they are very many the women who
are as it were schools following in the feeling of some one having
a feeling in them of having, having had, going to be having some
man loving them. There are some women, quite some of them who have
it as being that they are completely feeling one thing when they
are feeling that thing, these then are wonderful ones to any one
loving them, they are eternal things having it in them to be
completely one thing, these may be ones having any kind of thing in
feeling but each time feeling is in them they are feeling that
thing with the whole of them and these can then give to any one
loving them the feeling that being one is a thing not having any
beginning or any ending and so then many being in the state of
having loving for them, by some one of such of them many have it in
them then that infinite and eternal has really meaning. A thing not
beginning and not ending is certainly continuing, one completely
feeling something is one not having begun to feel anything because
to have a beginning means that there will be accumulation and then
gradually dying away as ending and this cannot be where a thing is
a complete thing. So then many women give to the men loving them
the awe-inspired feeling of realising an eternal thing. And that is
very satisfying and so very many men are very much liking having
this kind of loving given to them. Now I am saying this is in some
women, not only in loving but in living, they are completely
feeling something. There are a very great many woman living not at
all completely feeling anything and they are sometimes loving some
one and they are sometimes being loved by some one. Loving is a
very nice thing to very many doing that thing, it is not at all a
nice thing to very many doing that thing. Now as I am saying Julia
Hersland, who had been Julia Dehning came to know a good many men
and women in her living. In her younger living she had not known
any one not in Dehning family living or visiting. Now she was
coming now when she was no longer succeeding in married living she
was coming to know some men and women. She came to know David
Hersland brother of her husband Alfred Hersland. She came to know
James Cranach and his wife Miriam. She came to know Theodore
Summers and to know very well then William Beckling, and she came
to know pretty well not so very well because Helen really did not
like Julia Hersland in her daily living, she came to know Helen
Cooke. Julia came to know Rachel Sherman although Rachel was
certain that Helen was right about her feeling about living being
in Julia Dehning as some called her then, and then later Rachel
married Adolph Herman and then with not any changing in her feeling
she was a very dear friend in her feeling and in Julia Hersland's
feeling. And Julia had known and then was not any longer knowing
Charles Kohler, and then there was Arthur Keller whom in a way
every one was quite certain would come to be sometime a
brother-in-law to her and then there was one she was certainly
needing to be one certainly to be existing as being one certainly
teaching some one something, Linder Heme, and then there was the
whole family that were relations to her, and then there was
Florentine Cranach who was a cousin of James Cranach and then there
was Hilda Breslau who might come later to be a sister-in-law to her
but who really later married another, Ernest Brakes who was a
painter, and then there was Selma Dehning who had married into the
Dehning family and then had not any love for any one who was not a
Dehning and then there was Ella and Fred and their little baby,
Robert Housman who came very often to stay with them the Dehnings
and with Mrs. Hersland, and then there was Mrs. Conkling the aunt
of Selma Dehning and then there was a cousin of Mrs. Conkling and
she had five children and they were all girls and all in a way
earning their living and very nice girls in home living and Julia
liked going out with them. And then there was a doctor who did not
do any practicing Dr. Florence Arden who was quite an entirely
magnificent woman and Julia liked meeting her when she met her at
any concert or at any meeting and then there was a very rich man
Mr. James Curson and his wife Mrs. Bertha Curson who were extremely
delighted to know Mrs. Hersland and Julia Hersland was completely
happy in spending some time in the country with them. That's all
just now. There are some women, there are some men who are all
their living certain that they are not liking it that every one is
living the way each one is living, that they are not liking it that
they are living the way they are living, that they are not living
another way in living. Some are certain that they are needing that
every one should be in a way trying to be a good one, some are all
their living certain of this thing, some are all their living in
the living of being certain of this thing, some could be certain of
this thing, some can and are, some are certain of this thing that
each one should be one trying to be a good one they are completely
certain of this thing and they are then of the school of this thing
and they are that all their living certainly one certain of this
thing that each one should be one in a way trying to be a good
one.</p>

<p>Julia knew Mr. and Mrs. James Miriam Cranach and she knew
Theodore Summers and she knew William Beckling and she knew very
many other men and women, this is certain. All of these were in
some way certain that each one in living should in a way be doing
something so that everything would be a good thing for some one. So
then to give a little description of Theodore Summers and Miriam
Cranach and James Cranach and William Beckling. And then to give
some description of Julia Hersland knowing each one of them.
Theodore Summers was one certainly quarrelling so as to make some
kinds of men do something so that some should be certain that they
were having for living what they were needing. Theodore Summers
certainly was hotly quarrelling sometimes for this thing.</p>

<p>In a way Julia liked very much understanding Summers being one
quarrelling to win something, in a way she wanted to follow after
him, in a way she certainly did not follow after him. Later she did
not at all follow him.</p>

<p>Summers was certainly in a way to Julia for a time complete in
important living of being one certainly giving it to her to have
for living certainly learning something, but he did not give it to
her that Dehning living was certainly completely honest living
because he was not ever feeling anything about anything like any
such thing and so then he was not really important to her. He had
completely energy in living, he was not one certainly going on
being living as Julia Hersland certainly was going to be going on
doing and so in a way Summers was not to Julia really completely in
her living, I will tell a little more a little later about him.</p>

<p>Miriam Cranach was really a friend to Julia Hersland and that
was an important thing and that was in a way not at all an
important thing. Miriam was a resisting one really being living in
a religion, a religion that in a way was completely certain to be
leading any one to be certain that not any one would be a good
enough one to help themselves or any one and it did not lead Miriam
to this thing and it did lead Miriam to be certain of this thing.
Julia Hersland was certain that Miriam was completely an honest one
for daily living but she was not needing Miriam for this thing, she
was not needing Miriam for the religion in Miriam, she was not
really needing Miriam, she and Miriam were completely faithful
friends in living and this was not important to any one as being
inside in any one and both of them were certainly in a way living
inside in them, and this is certain, and in a way it is a little a
strange thing and I will tell sometime some more about this
thing.</p>

<p>Julia Hersland might later have come to marry William Beckling
but William came then to be quite a sick man and he had then
certainly to take care of himself in living and he would not then
marry any woman. I will tell more about him. He was in a way one in
a way acting as if he were almost certain that some one should be a
good one for living. This is all now for just beginning a
description of living in him.</p>

<p>Mostly all of these whom Julia knew then met the others she knew
then but very many did not like some of the others they met then.
Some did like very much some of those they met then. Some did not
come to know any of the others they met then. Some did come to know
some of the others they met then. As I was saying Julia had in a
way not come to have any friends in her personal living in her
younger living. This is quite common. This is quite astonishing to
those who have had friends personal to them to their living but it
is certainly very common, quite extraordinarily common that young
women and younger ones and young men and younger ones have not had
any one who was personally a companion to them. As I am saying this
is really extraordinarily common. It is also very uncommon as I am
saying and very many are knowing.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning then had in a way in her younger living not had
really any one personally a companion to her then, she was herself
inside her and giving a stamp then decidedly to herself to every
one of herself on Dehning living as being in her being living. She
was then being in Dehning family living, that is now certain.</p>

<p>Now then to begin again the long list of those she came to know
as Mrs. Alfred Hersland, some of them she knew earlier, certainly
William Beckling, a very little Miriam Cranach, quite well in
Dehning family living Charles Kohler, she had heard of Adolph
Herman and as for the rest perhaps she had met them, knew of some
one knowing them, perhaps not, that really is not an important
thing to any one excepting to me who am interested in knowing
everything every little thing. I will then begin remembering these
things. Julia Hersland too knew David Hersland, she in a way knew
some that knew him, he in a way knew every one she knew then, she
in a way knew about some of those Alfred Hersland was knowing then.
She did not later know anything of those Alfred Hersland was
knowing.</p>

<p>Really almost all her living she knew William Beckling, she did
not come to marry him, that was because he became a sick man and
was certain then that it was not right for him to marry any woman.
She knew Theodore Summers a few years, she always sometime heard
something about him, later when she did not any longer often see
him. It was a little then an important thing in her living as part
of really learning anything, as part of being one certainly and she
was certainly such a one as part of being in courageous being one
going on certainly going on being living.</p>

<p>She came to know the Cranachs after she was a married one. They
had a little known William Beckling, they did not care about him,
they had known David Hersland, they liked knowing him. Julia
afterwards to the end of her living knew them really for her daily
living. There will be a history written a short one of her and each
one of them. Helen Cooke knew Julia after she was Mrs. Hersland.
Helen knew Mrs. Cranach, she knew William Beckling, she knew David
Hersland, she really did not interest herself really to know any of
them then. She later came to know David Hersland as a thing
interesting to her for the living being in her, she always all her
living knew Julia Hersland, she did not find that at all
interesting. Rachel Sherman married Adolph Herman, Adolph Herman
knew William Beckling, Rachel Sherman knew Helen Cooke very well
then and she met William Beckling and Mrs. Alfred Hersland and then
Adolph Herman and then she married him. I will tell about that
thing. The Hermans in a way always went on knowing and later
learning anything with Mrs. Hersland. That was interesting. I will
tell about this thing. Charles Kohler was one in a way in Dehning
family living, later they were not certain that in a way he had
been in Dehning family living, for some time then not anybody in
Dehning family living saw him, Julia sometimes saw him then, she
never was certain whether he had been in his feeling ever in
Dehning family living. He was not in any way to any one in Dehning
family living or to any one knowing Julia Hersland an important
one. Linder Herne was a man certainly teaching something. Julia had
heard of him, she liked it that all the rest of his living she
could know him.</p>

<p>Arthur Keller as I said she came to know as he came to be
perhaps going to be a brother-in-law. I will tell about him later
in the history of David Hersland. Then there was Hilda who married
Ernest Brakes and she might have married George Dehning. I will
tell a little about her now and more about her later, she never
completely wanted to know Julia Hersland and yet she liked it very
well that she did know Julia Hersland. She married Ernest Brakes
and she sometimes met the Dehnings later when she went out
somewhere. Then there were other ones as I said in telling about
those Julia was knowing, I will begin again telling about every one
Julia Hersland was knowing.</p>

<p>There certainly are kinds in men and women. There certainly are
things hurting each one living. The things hurting each one hurt
them in the way their kind of them, their kind in men and women are
hurt by anything. Sometimes it is astonishing to some one that they
are effected by something in a way and that is the way their kind
of them in men and women are certain to be affected by that thing
and they did not know of which kind they were and that they would
be effected the way their kind in men and women is always being
effected by something and so they found it completely astonishing
to know it of themselves that they were effected that way by that
thing. Some know quite certainly by the middle of their middle
living how they are going to be effected by each thing. Very many
are never really certain about this thing. Quite a number come to
be quite certain about this thing. Some can be certain about other
ones about this thing. Some are quite certain but are not really
knowing this thing, some are not certain and are not really knowing
this thing.</p>

<p>Each kind then in men and women have it to have that all of them
are hurt in the same way by something that can hurt them. This is
just now in me by my feeling. Some of each kind of them have it to
be much less hurt than others of their kind of them by anything.
Some of each kind of them can be almost quite completely hurt by
something hurting them. Each kind of them in men and women have it
in them to have their own way of having frightened feeling in them
from something really scaring them. Some of each kind in men and
women are not very much frightened by anything scaring them. Some
are very much scared by something frightening them. Some easily
have their way of being frightened in them, some need very much
frightening to have their way of being frightened, the way of being
frightened of their kind of them come out of them.</p>

<p>I am beginning now telling more of Miriam Cranach who was of a
kind of them of whom many have it to have religion in them so that
they are in living really ones having really inside them and
outside of them distinction from this thing. Some of such of them
are fairly happy ones in living but very many of such of them are
happy really only by religion. These are of the resisting kind in
men and women, that is to say they are of the dependent independent
kind. They have it in them not to be really dependent, not to be
really independent. They have completely the sensitiveness of
resisting being but they are not sensitive to anything that is not
to their feeling connected with the relation of themselves of some
one to the universal feeling. They have not at all engulfing being
although some of them almost suggest such a thing, they have not at
all resisting although some of them very much suggest such a thing,
they seem to be resisting because they are not responding to
anything that is to them whatever meaning that word many have for
them not god-given. They seem some of them to be engulfing because
they are completely sensitive to that thing. These have it very
often that they have not any power of expressing themselves about
anything that does not completely touch them. Many of these if it
were not for the looks of them would seem from their talking or
their writing generally to be quite stupid ones.</p>

<p>Miriam was such a one. I will not tell very much just now about
her because sometime later when I tell more about men and women I
will tell about Miss Ortenried who married Olaf Lawson. I will then
tell all I know then about this kind in men and women, how they
have religion in them, how they can be hurt by something, how they
can be frightened when something has scared them. I told something
about Miriam Cranach knowing Julia Dehning Hersland. I have already
told something about this thing.</p>

<p>Always something is happening and one is then feeling something
and sometimes one is then one knowing how some other one felt when
something was happening. Some one can understand then always
sometime how some other one was feeling sometime about
something.</p>

<p>William Bedding was one who was almost for him completely,
brilliantly succeeding in living, and then he came to be a sick one
and he was certain then that it would not be right for him to marry
a woman.</p>

<p>Beckling then was almost completely brilliantly succeeding in
living as I was saying. He did not begin early in his living to be
so brilliantly succeeding, but about the middle of his middle
living he was certainly almost quite brilliantly succeeding.</p>

<p>Almost all these I have been saying who were knowing Julia
Hersland were succeeding pretty well in living. Ernest Brakes who
married Hilda Breslau who might have come to marry George Dehning
was never succeeding any too well in living. They were happy ones
enough in being living Brakes and his wife Hilda. Henry Sherman and
his wife Rachel were in a way successful in living quite successful
in living, in a way quite happy in living, happy enough in living,
they were to very many knowing them and to themselves all their
living very happy quite successful ones in being living. They were
loving each other that is certain and were pleasant to each other
completely in being husband and wife living together and going
about together. They both had much intention, much aspiration, much
conviction, much sensitiveness in living, they did not have very
much that hurt them but some things did hurt them, perhaps some
things frightened them that is not certain. They did not have
religion but they each had complete devotion to being certain that
each one was to be one really and truly working, was one really and
truly working. These came to know Julia Hersland always more in
their living and in her living. They came to be almost always more
or less in each others daily living. I can not describe them more
because I do not know what to be certain about in thinking about
them. Sometime I will be more certain and then I will begin again
about them. I will tell more now about Julia Hersland and each one
she came to know in living and how she came to know them and I will
tell more and more about all the living ever being in her. I could
go on and on, I am so certain that it would be a very important
thing if some other going on being living, some other ones going on
being in living could be knowing really how to be distinguishing
the resisting from the attacking kind in men and women, could be
understanding the way having it in them to have religion in them is
in them of the resisting kind of them, is in them of the attacking
kind of them. I am so certain that I am knowing a very great deal
about being being in men and in women that it certainly does seem
as if something would be missing if not any one could be coming to
know from me all of that everything. And now I am sad with this
thing for certainly I will be going on with all this thing and
certainly then not any one will be rightly certain about some one
which kind of being that one has in them resisting or attacking and
how religion is in that one. But then I am remembering that every
one being ever in living is pretty well used to this thing that
some one has it to have knowing realising something and not any one
else even later has that thing and so then I will go on writing,
and not for myself and not for any other one but because it is a
thing I certainly can be earnestly doing with sometimes excited
feeling and sometimes happy feeling and sometimes longing feeling
and sometimes almost indifferent feeling and always with a little
dubious feeling. I could though be so wise and I am so wise and it
would be so nice for me to be certain that from me some other one
could be a wise one a little less wise than I am who am the
original wise one. I could then be so pleased with this thing with
being certain that with me there would be an increasing of wise
realisation, and then I am remembering it is like when I was a
younger one I was for years so sorry about things important in
something being lost and some one being a dead one by an accident
when he was a young one and then later I was certain I would not be
using that thing that was lost and would not be reading something
if it had been written and if I did not need that thing, very
likely not any one would be really needing that thing, and whatever
any one is having is plenty good enough unless they want some other
thing and perhaps they will find that other thing, and anyhow
nobody can be a wise one in the way I am just now a wise one, so I
will go on and go on and if anybody comes to be like me a wise one
why then there will have come to be another wise one. I am almost
certain I am completely a wise one. I will not tell any more now
about this thing. I will tell now some more about religion and
about attacking and about resisting being and I will tell some more
now about everything and perhaps sometime I will be sad again about
not any one ever having the understanding of being in men and women
that I am having.</p>

<p>Julia Dehning came to know each of them, some men and some
women, and so for now to finish them and her up. Sometime and it
will be in the history of David Hersland that it will be done I
will be telling more about each one coming to be sometime a
completely dead one. I like it very much that each one all their
living have it that they are in some way being living ones. Very
often to very many they are very faintly repeating to themselves to
any one that they are being living ones then when they are living.
Some are not when they are dead ones letting any one having known
them be really certain that they are then dead ones. Always then I
am certain that sometime I will be telling very much more about
every one being in their living living ones and being sometime then
really a dead one, dead ones. Being living and then being a dead
one, I am certain that I will always be telling more and more about
these things to every one. Being a very happy one makes it that I
can tell each one sometime about this thing about being a living
one and about being sometime then a dead one. I like very much
being a happy one, a really widely certainly happy one. I like very
much being a very happy one. I can tell to myself too and to every
one that each one in the way it is in him is being in his living
and each one is sometime then a dead one. I say that I will
certainly tell more and more about this to every one. I will
certainly always be telling about every one being in being living
and every one being sometime a dead one.</p>

<p>Julia Hersland was being in living and certainly sometime she
came to be a dead one. Julia Hersland certainly was being in living
and she certainly sometime came to be a dead one. Julia was as I
was saying one not failing, in a way not succeeding in living.
Julia in a way certainly was quite an excited one in being one
being in living. Julia certainly was one keeping on being in living
all her living and then she was a dead one. Julia was in a way in
living not a happy one, not an unhappy one, in a way quite a happy
one. Julia was certainly one in a way not having been one feeling
in living. She was one in a way succeeding in living. She came to
know quite a number of men and women and quite a number of men and
women came to know her and she was one having certainly it in her
to be one being going on being in living.</p>

<p>She came to know a good many men and women in living and a good
many men and women came to know her and they, mostly all of them,
were succeeding in living and in a way she was one having been
succeeding in being in living. She was of Dehning family living as
I was saying. She was not of Dehning family living. She went on
living being in living as I was saying. She came sometime to be a
dead one. Many others had come by then to be dead ones. Some had
not yet then come to be dead ones. There are very many always
living that is certain. There are very many always living. There
were then once very many living. Julia Hersland was one being going
on in living. She came sometime to be a dead one. Julia knew some
then when she was being living and they were then being living, and
they knew her then some.</p>

<p>Julia came to know some. She came to know each one of them some
sometime in her living. Julia came to know them those I have been
mentioning each one of them some sometime in her living. Julia came
to know them each one of them sometime in her living. I was just
telling some one yesterday evening that some one has it not to have
in them the poignancy of experience that that one thought that
other one had in living. That one had concentration in expressing
experiencing, that one had not concentration in experiencing.
Having concentration in experiencing is common but then again it is
not so very common. There was one that I was seeing yesterday
evening and this one was of the slow resisting and engulfing kind
in men and women and this one was quite solemn and this one was not
such a solid one in being a slow resisting engulfing one as this
one was in expression and so this one was solemn. This one could
really be thinking about some one, this one had imagination, this
one had sensitiveness for coming to be realising ways of doing
something, this one had not sensitiveness for realising the feeling
of something having being really existing, this one had the feeling
of having feeling of being really existing, this one then had slow
solemn expression. I was telling some one yesterday evening, no I
do not think I was telling any one this thing yesterday evening. I
would have been telling some one yesterday evening if I had not in
a way not been wanting to tell that one this thing, that each one
could be finding another one interesting if each one felt another
one being in act of feeling the way that one really is feeling
being living. I cannot come to be more certain ever of anything
than I am of how very interesting it is to me in my being one being
living to be certain of the feeling there is being in each one and
how that feeling comes out of each one as expression. The one I was
going to be telling this thing to last evening is one having it
that he is sympathetically realising this about each one who has
been expressing himself in something written or painted or winning
in fighting or governing, or thinking or discovering, this one
cannot be rightly certain although this one is very often telling
about this thing and this one is very often quite certain what the
being is in any one as experiencing when the expression is not a
formulated one. Now I can learn it by loving repeating, loving
repeating is in me and so to me every one is having as it were
coming out of them formulated expression. Loving repeating in me
makes of me then one understanding being in men and women, and the
relation of expression coming out of each one to the being making
them of them. So then any one can know that being one loving
hearing seeing feeling repeating has made of me a very wise
one.</p>

<p>I am commencing now again a description of Julia coming to know
some men and some women sometime in her living. I am beginning
again describing being and expression of the being of them coming
out of them of some men and some women Julia came to know in
living.</p>

<p>It is a queer thing that some one wanting to be giving and
giving some one something is not giving that one what that one is
wanting. It is a queer thing that some are wanting to be giving
some something and are giving some something and are not giving
them what they are wanting, what they are needing for their living.
It is a queer thing that some are realising sometime that some
other one is seeing, is remembering something that one cannot be
seeing by looking, cannot be remembering by any kind of trying to
remember that thing. It is a queer feeling to be really certain
that one is not remembering the way another one is remembering, is
not seeing the way another one is seeing, it is a queer feeling to
be completely realising the way another one is seeing something
another one is realising something and to be quite certain by
realising that one can not be seeing, cannot be remembering that
thing. It is a completely queer feeling, this that I am describing.
It is a completely queer feeling to be realising that some one is
seeing something, is feeling something is remembering something, to
be completely realising that one being feeling, being remembering,
being seeing something and to be completely realising that one
realising another one's feeling seeing remembering that thing
cannot one's self feel see and remember that thing. I can say that
having such a feeling is completely having a queer feeling in being
one being living. I can say that I am having completely a queer
feeling when I am realising that I am not being feeling, seeing,
remembering something when I am completely realising some one else
being feeling, seeing, remembering that thing. I have then a
completely queer feeling, I have been having a completely queer
feeling, I have been realising some one being able to be feeling,
remembering, seeing something and I have been realising that I am
not able to be feeling, remembering, seeing that thing. It is not a
completely queer feeling if one is not completely realising some
one's experiencing something and completely realising not being
going to be, not being experiencing that thing. This thing then is
the complete thing in having complete queer feeling in living. I
well tell about, this again and again. It is in me now, it will be
in me again and again. It is in me now, it will be in me very
often. I am now beginning the ending of my telling about the living
in Julia Hersland and Alfred Hersland and other women and other men
knowing them.</p>

<p>Some one was saying of some one that he was an interesting one,
he wanted himself to be such an earnest one, his father was not an
earnest one that was a thing he was used to in his living, his
mother was an indolent one, he was pretty well used to that thing
that she was an indolent one, his brother was certainly not an
earnest one he had not any hope that he could be in living, a
fellow who was such a one as his brother was, an earnest one, he
himself was not ever keeping going in being an earnest one, this
one then was as another one said of him one asking very much of
himself in living and he was not succeeding, very likely would not
be succeeding in going on being an earnest one and he was not a
disappointed one one disappointed with living, he was one not
really filled with any earnest feeling in being one being living,
he had earnest feeling of knowing that not any one in his family
had been being in living an earnest one and this made of him in a
way one who could be in living if he would be, a disappointed one.
So then as some one said of this one this one was one feeling it in
him that he might have been expecting having earnest feeling coming
to be being inside him but he did not come to be expecting this
thing as he was almost certain that his father did not have ever
inside him earnest feeling, that his mother certainly was one going
to be going on being indolent in being living, that his brother
certainly never would have anything in him of earnest feeling, and
then he to himself as one to be realised by him would not come to
have inside in him certainly earnest feeling, that was very likely
to be not in him this earnest feeling that he was expecting from
some one inside him. So then this one as this other one said of him
was a very moral man. He certainly asked a great deal of himself,
that is what this other one said about this one, this one that the
other one said was one who was certainly a very moral one in his
being one going on being living. This one then as I was saying was
a very moral man in being one expecting very much from himself
inside him in his being one being living. He certainly was not
having it in him very expectantly feeling this expectation of
having earnest feeling going on being in him but he certainly was a
moral one in having this very certain realisation that not his
father not his mother not his brother not himself in learning
living was an earnest one in feeling anything.</p>

<p>It is a very amusing thing hearing some realising other ones
being moral ones in living. She should do it, she wants so much
from herself to herself in living, let her pay herself for being
one going to be going to be a good one. That is what some one is
saying about some one. It is very interesting to be helping some
one going to be a good one. It is certain that some are going to be
good ones in living. It is certain that to some this is in some
other one very unbecoming. It is certain that to some this in some
other one is very becoming. I have been helping some with this
thing with coming to be going to be a good one. I have been helping
some very much in this thing. Each one is herself, is himself
inside her inside him and it is certainly a very interesting thing
helping each one, helping some of each kind of them to be going to
be a good one. I have sometimes been helping some, with very much
feeling and serious consideration and steady struggling and earnest
attention, I have sometimes been helping some to going to be a good
one in their living for them. I have quite often been doing this
thing. I am now going on telling a little more about the middle
living in Julia Hersland and in some coming to know her then. She
was then to herself inside her one honest in all daily living, one
certainly having courage in being one certainly going to be going
on living, one certainly going to be learning anything, one
certainly to herself inside her in a way certainly a good one.</p>

<p>One cousin is dead, another is quite a sick one. That is not so
strange as they are then in the middle of their middle living, it
is not strange and yet it is certainly something one is not wishing
to have happening just then. It is natural that when there are very
many of a family living and very many cousins and some aunts and
uncles living that sometimes some of them should be sick ones, even
that once in a while one of them should come to be a dead one. In a
way it is a strange thing because very often for many years not any
one in the family connection is a seriously sick one, not any one
is ever thinking of any one they are then knowing as any where near
to any dying. Sometimes it happens that one cousin is quite a sick
one, sometimes it happens that all the uncles are dead by then and
only two aunts are still living. Sometimes it happens in a family
living that all the aunts and some of the uncles are still living.
Sometimes it happens that the aunts and uncles that are sisters and
brothers of the mother of some one are all living and the mother
the sister of these uncles and aunts is the only one of that family
who is not then any longer living. Sometimes it happens that pretty
nearly every one of the brothers of a father of some one are not
any longer living and the father then after some more years of
being living is not any longer living. There is then sometimes in
family living when there is not any one who is then a seriously
sick one, that there has not been any one during many years coming
to be not any longer a living one. Some have some feeling in them
that sometime some one who is a cousin will be a seriously sick one
and some one who is a cousin will come to be not any longer living.
Some are feeling that sometime quite a number who are cousins to
them will not be any longer living. Julia Hersland was in the
ending of her middle living. Mrs. Dehning had been for sometime not
any longer living. Mr. Dehning was not any longer living. Julia
Hersland went on being one being living until well to the end of
her older living. She had a brother George and a sister Hortense.
These were both a good deal younger. She had children who were
living. She was not really ever married again although of course it
would have been quite a natural thing for her to marry again and to
marry William Beckling. He came as I said to be a sick one but he
really did not come to be a dead one until the beginning of his old
living. You never can tell anything certainly about such a
thing.</p>

<p>I am certainly going to be telling more about feeling being in
living. I will tell some more about feeling being in living,
feeling certain that one is being in living in some and then in
some other men and women. I will not worry any one just now with
this thing. This is in me for me and I am certainly not scaring
myself with this thing. I certainly would not be frightening any
one in living. I certainly would be wanting every one to be certain
that they are feeling themselves being living. Some like the being
they have in them. Some are frightened and then they do the thing
that frightens them. Some are glad that when they have been sick
ones it was of a kind of sickness that was not a very expensive
one. Some when they have a sickness need expensive medicine to cure
them. Some are certain that some other one is always certain to be
needing to have money spent, and that they are of the kind in men
and women who even when they come to be sick ones have a kind of
sickness come to them that does not need expensive medicine for
curing. Some are certain that they would be strong to be struggling
if they were anywhere where they needed to be winning by fighting,
one was saying that she was the kind of one who would be holding
out until she would be a dead one because it was what she needed
for her satisfaction, but she said she would not really be holding
out as she might have been doing because she would not want that
her husband should be losing a chance to be earning a living by
working. Some are quite right in saying that they are one being one
strong to be winning, some are quite right then in saying such a
thing and these then some of them are winning in living and some of
them are not winning in living. Some are quite right in saying that
they are one to certainly injure some one and then it is some one
not that one who is injuring that one. Some are quite right in
saying they are one to injure some one, some do then injure some
one, some do then not injure some one. Some are quite right to be
asking a question after they have been silently listening while
other people have been talking, some are quite right in not then
letting themselves be asking a question. Some are certainly quite
right to be listening very quietly very often, some are quite right
to be almost never doing this thing.</p>

<p>I will tell now a very little more how Julia Hersland and some
others did something, did everything.</p>

<p>Each one is coming gradually to be knowing in their living what
way being is inside in men in women when they are quite young ones,
completely little ones, older ones, middle aged ones, old ones,
then each one comes gradually to be knowing how being is in men, in
women when men when women are about sixty, about fifty, about
fifty-five, about forty, about forty-five, about thirty, about
twenty-eight, about twenty-six, about twenty-two, about eighteen
and fourteen and eleven, and seven and five and three and two and
under one to being only just beginning being in living. Each one
gradually in living is realising how being is in men, how being is
in women at different ages in them, each one comes in living to
know more differences than just very young living, young living,
middle living and old living. Again and again it is a startling
thing to some one to be learning pieces of this thing of the way
being is at different ages in men and in women. I am just now a
little realising how old men and how old women mostly are when they
are sixty-one. I have learnt a good deal about how being is in men
between twenty three and forty-two. I know a good deal about
twenty-seven, twentyfive, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-two,
thirty-four, thirty-seven, forty and forty-two and then I know a
little about fifty-seven and now I am learning something about
being in women and in men when they are sixty and sixty-one. I know
a good deal about them when they are very little ones, two and
three years old in living, something about them when they are
eleven, a very little when they are seventeen almost nothing when
they are eighteen and fifteen. I know a very little about them when
they are twenty-one. I know that being is very differently in them
at different ages in different kinds in men and women. I know that
some when they are sixty are healthy ones and some then when they
are sixty are not at all then healthy ones. I know some when they
are sixty are pretty well worn then and some are dead before they
come to be that age in living and some are quite young men and
quite young women in eating, sleeping, moving, talking and
enjoying, and always then each one is learning in living how being
is in each one ever living at different ages in their being living
and I, I am just now being quite an astonished one, finding it
quite astonishing to be really realising being sixty years old and
being in living in men and in women.</p>

<p>Alfred Hersland came to be older than sixty in living, Julia
came to be a little older in living, Minnie who married Alfred
later did not come in living to be sixty before she came to an
ending, Mr. Dehning came to be sixty and he was pretty well
beginning then to be quite an old man, Mr. Hersland came to be
older a good deal older than sixty before he was not any longer one
being living, he was when he was sixty in a way then a completely
old one, he was then in a way then not at all a completely old one.
I will tell about being old ones later in the description of
Dehning and Hersland family living being completely then for that
generation ended and ending.</p>

<p>Minnie Mason as I said was married to Alfred Hersland. She would
never have it that she would not be married to him when they were
beginning to be needing being one in living. She certainly saw to
it that they could then be married and quite reasonably happily
married then. She knew David Hersland then. She told him she liked
him and she would be a nice sister-in-law to him. She was quite a
nice sister-in-law to him. She had not really much interest in
Alfred having been married to Julia Dehning excepting only that it
would be certain that Julia should be freed from him so that she
herself should marry Alfred Hersland when they came to need to be
together for living. So then Alfred Hersland went on living as I am
saying. Julia Hersland went on living as I have been saying. I will
tell now a little more about these things, about being in
living.</p>

<p>Certainly some are loving each other more in living than mostly
any one is loving any other one. This was not a thing ever coming
to be in Julia Dehning, this was not a thing that ever came to be
really in Alfred Hersland. They had loving being sometimes in them
each one of them. I have said this of them again and again. Almost
every one ever knowing either one of them thought of each one of
them that they had each one of them sometime loving feeling in
them. I have told about loving feeling being in Alfred Hersland. I
have told about loving feeling being in Julia Dehning. In a way
loving feeling could be quite poignantly in Julia Dehning and she
could have sweetness in her then as being in her then. In a way
though as I was saying she had always in her stupid being as having
it in her to be always resisting having any way in her of really
learning anything and in a way she did not have any sweetness in
her with this being in her. This stupid being was certainly always
being in her and active enough inside her. In a way then she
certainly had not really sweetness as actively in her as there was
not any sweetness in her with the stupid being of her active in her
and stupid being in her was always active inside her. She certainly
was one not learning anything in being one being in living, she was
one certainly having a dominant courage in her from being one
certainly going on being living, she was one having certainly
earnest intention as being in her from being one always wanting to
have teaching being in the world as always existing, she was one
being fairly interesting, from being one being really excited in
being one always being living, she was one certainly being harsh
and being troublesome and being without realising anything without
feeling anything in being one needing anything as anything could be
to her as something on which to be feeding, she certainly was one
having affection and being in Dehning family Jiving, she was one
having certainly sometimes loving feeling and having this
poignantly with sweetness in being and sweetness in kissing and she
was one certainly having stupid being as being in her all her
living so that she was everlasting, actively resisting changing at
all in attacking. She was one as I was saying not succeeding not
failing in living. I am not certain I will just now tell any more
about the being in Julia Dehning. Later I will tell more about her
in the history of David Hersland that I will now very soon be
writing. Certainly I will then tell more of her and of some who
knew her and whom David knew by knowing her and some who knew him
and then knew her because he knew her just then.</p>

<p>I certainly will not tell any more now about being in her, about
living in her, I certainly will tell some about being in her, about
living in her, later. I certainly will later be telling something
that I have not yet been telling. I do not yet know about her what
I will be telling about her later. I certainly will be telling more
about her later. I am quite certain of this thing.</p>

<p>When I was a young one I was needing some one to teach me
something I was needing just then. I was then at the ending of my
beginning being in living. Some one then began teaching me that
thing I was needing just then, that one was then teaching me that
thing I was needing just then. I was paying that one for teaching
me that thing, the thing I was needing just then. Once I was saying
to this one I will not be paying you to-day, I will pay you in
three weeks, you will wait till then, I said to this one. This one
said yes I will wait until then, but I am now asking you to tell me
what you are meaning when you are saying to me and to yourself then
that you have not money to pay me to-day for this thing. Do you
mean that you cannot get the money to pay me to-day, is that what
you are meaning, that you cannot get it to-day if you need it to
day is that your meaning. I said no that is not my meaning, I mean
that I have not the money to-day and that I will have it in three
weeks that is what I am meaning by what I am saying. You mean you
will not get it to-day because you are feeling you are not really
needing to have it to-day that is your meaning, said that one. No I
said that is not the way to understand this thing, I have not got
the money to-day and I will have it in three weeks from to-day, my
brother sends me my money every month that is what I mean by what I
am saying. That is what I am meaning said that one, you are needing
the money to-day to your feeling, I am needing the money to-day we
will say to my feeling but you do not need the money to-day to your
feeling, that is what you are meaning, money is a thing like
working you are giving it when you are feeling that you are needing
the money to be giving it, I am giving work because I am needing
money to be receiving it, said this one. I had a confused feeling
then. Money was something I was owning yes, but not owning because
it was like being in myself that I needed to be living, having
money was as natural to me then as being in living and I could not
be spending it irregularly, I must spend it as an income. I had it
yes but not to give except when regularly I had some. It was
confusing that I was so certain I had not the money then and yet
certainly I could get the money then but it was not possible to get
the money then for I could not feel I could be needing really to be
spending the money I could get then when it was not the time to get
this money as money to be spending. Some have such a feeling in
living, some have not such a feeling in living. Some cannot really
believe it that any one is spending money when they are not certain
that the family have money that gives that money to them. Some
really can never believe this thing of any one. Some are certain
that every one who is not living by daily pay for working can ever
be without having enough for some kind of living. I am feeling
always more and more in living how certainly some are certain of
something. In a way it is a personal thing for them, in a way it is
a family affair in them, in a way it is a way of living in a
national way for them, in a way it is a way of living of the local
way in them, in a way it is a way of living their kind in men and
women have in being in living. It is certainly quite completely a
difficult thing for any one to be remembering how any one else is
doing their daily living, in a way it is quite a difficult thing
for some, for quite a number of men for quite a number of women to
be remembering how they were getting along from time to time to be
in living. It is very often astonishing to be realising complete
being in living in men and in women. It is certainly astonishing to
know it of each one what that one has done in being in living in
himself inside him, to himself inside him, with other ones, with
some other one, to any other one, to some one. I am saying this
thing because I am in living and because very many men and very
many women are living. I am saying this thing because I certainly
am going on being in living because very many men and very many
women are certainly going on being in living. Alfred Hersland and
Minnie Mason and Patrick Moore and James Flint and Mackinly Young
and David Hersland and George Dehning and Hortense Dehning and
Julia Hersland and Theodore Summers and William Beckling and Helen
Cooke and James Cranach and Miriam Cranach and Rachel Sherman and
Adolph Herman and Charles Kohler and Linder Herne and Arthur Keller
and Florentine Cranach and Hilda Breslau and Ernest Brakes and
Selma Dehning and Ella Housman and Robert Housman and Fred Housman
and Florence Arden and James Curson and Bertha Curson and Hilda
Gnadenfeld and Algar Audenried and every one who knew any one of
them were sometime being in living, were all their living going on
being in living.</p>

<p>All men and all women ever having been, being in living are
certainly feeling something in them about going on being in living.
Each one of them certainly sometimes is going on being in living
doing something and then is going on being in living doing some
other thing. Each one ever having been in living has certainly been
in living feeling certain in some way of doing something. It is as
I say certainly to some an astonishing thing to be knowing in some
other one the way that one has it to be in living certain about
being one doing some thing in some way in the living of that one.
Certainly some one is very often certain that not any one really is
certain in doing something in some way, that that one is certainly
not certain enough in doing that thing that way to be ever in the
living of that one really doing that thing in any such a way in the
living of that one. As I am saying each one ever having been, being
in living is doing something in some way, is certain in some way in
being in some way being living, is going on in some way being in
living, certainly mostly every one. As I am saying there has been
being there is being in some of these I have been mentioning, in
Alfred Hersland and Martha Hersland and Julia Dehning and David
Hersland and George Dehning and Hortense Dehning and William
Beckling, and Minnie Mason, and Charles Kohler and Pat Moore and
Florence Arden and James Flint and Robert Housman and Adolph Herman
and Mackinly Young and Selma Dehning and Hilda Breslau and Arthur
Keller and James Flint and every other one they were any of them
ever knowing and every other one living when any of them were going
on being living and every other one being living when they were not
any longer going on being living any of them or any other one,
before any one of them were being in living being then being
living, every one then of all these certainly sometime in a way was
going on being in living, was certainly being some way in being
living. This is enough to say just now about each one of them. This
is what I am saying just now about each one of them. I will
certainly say this about each one of them again and again. This is
the ending of just this way of going on telling about being being
in some men and in some women. This is the ending of this way of
telling about being having been and being in Alfred Hersland and
Julia Dehning.<br>

<h2>8. DAVID HERSLAND</h2>

<p>I do ask some, I would ask every one, I do not ask some because
I am quite certain that they would not like me to ask it, I do ask
some if they would mind it if they found out that they did have the
name they had then and had been having been born not in the family
living they are then living in, if they had been born illegitimate.
I ask some and I would ask every one only I am quite certain very
many would not like to have me ask it if they would like it, if
they would very much dislike it, if they would make a tragedy of
it, if they would make a joke of it, if they found they had in them
blood of some kind of a being that was a low kind to them. I would
like to know how every one can be feeling about such a thing, if
they have any feeling about any such thing. David Hersland was the
younger son of Mr. David Hersland and Mrs. Hersland. In his younger
living he never thought about any such thing as that about which I
have just been telling. In his later living he liked thinking about
feeling such things, thinking such things being in men and women.
Some when they are quite young ones are thinking then about such
things. He was never at all when he was a young one thinking about
any such thing. This is to be now a history of him.</p>

<p>What am I believing about living. I am believing that I am not
certain when I am saying something from being one being then being
loving that I am meaning anything by what I am then saying, I am
not certain that I am not then having being in being one being
loving that is being that is having the meaning as being of what I
am then saying. I am believing that I am not certain about being
being in one meaning what one being in being loving is saying. I am
believing that I am not certain being being loving in one is in one
then meaning what that one is then saying. I am believing that I am
not certain that being is not in one meaning what that one being
then being loving is saying. What is it I am knowing about living,
I certainly am not knowing that I am not knowing everything about
being in living. I am not certain that I am knowing everything
about being living. I am not certain that I am not knowing
everything about being living. I am not certain that I am knowing
everything about being living.</p>

<p>I know that I am not certain about what I would do for some one
what I would not do for some one. Not any one is certain so that
acting by them shows it to any one what they would do for some one,
what they would not do for some one. Each one then would do
something for some one, would not do something for some one, would
do something for any one would not do something for any one. Some
are quite certain about themselves in this thing. Some are quite
not certain about themselves in this thing. Not any one is rightly
certain about themselves about this thing. Perhaps not any one is
really certain about themselves about this thing. Perhaps one is
certain about that one about this thing. I know I am not certain
about what I would do for some one, what I would not do for some
one.</p>

<p>Some one having some one who was with them become a dead one
could be saying, when some one was saying something, that one does
not know he is a dead one, he will never know that thing. He does
not know he is a dead one, some one said of some one who was a dead
one. Some one could be certain that some one who is a dead one
would not know he was a dead one, some one could not know that some
other one who was a dead one would not know that that one was a
dead one. Some one then has been quite certain that some one who
was with them when that one was a dead one did not know then that
that one was a dead one. Some have been certain that every one who
is a dead one does not then know that that one is a dead one.</p>

<p>It is a surprising thing sometimes to be learning which ones of
some one has been knowing are quite certain and say the thing then
as a very simple thing that anybody can be knowing that some one
who has been with them being a dead one is not knowing that that
one is a dead one.</p>

<p>It is certainly something that some are saying when some one who
was with them is a dead one that that one is not knowing then that
that one is a dead one. Some like very well to be hearing some one
say this thing that some one is a dead one and is certainly then
not knowing this thing. Some like very well hearing this thing.
Some are not wanting ever to be hearing any thing about any one
ever being a dead one. This will soon now be the beginning of a
description of living that David Hersland did before he came to be
a dead one.</p>

<p>Some are satisfied with having been living when they are come to
be a dead one with not having had in them any very sick feeling,
any very bad thing to be doing, any very hard work for them in
them, not any queer feeling of not having had their head quite
right inside them. Some are satisfied then with having been living
ones when they have come to be a dead one, some are not satisfied
then with having come to be then a dead one. Some are satisfied,
some are not satisfied with having been one being living. Some are
quite satisfied with having been one having living in them, some
are not satisfied at all with this thing. Some are very well
satisfied with having come to be a dead one, some are not at all
satisfied with this thing.</p>

<p>Some one gives to another one a stubborn feeling when that one
could be convincing that other one if that other one would then
continue listening. Some are certain that sometimes they can be
convinced by some one. Some are certain they are sometimes
convinced by some one. Some are certain that they could be
conceived sometimes by some one but that they will not be letting
themselves ever have any such a thing happen to them. Some like
being convinced of some things by some, by some one.</p>

<p>Some one and I certainly never did think that one ever could do
such a thing has it to be so strongly repeating the facts that one
is remembering that almost always I am always convinced that I have
been wrong in my feeling. I certainly am not certain whether I ever
can be certain whether I ever am when I am feeling something
justified from my way of feeling anything in having such a feeling
when this one is repeating the way that one is remembering
everything. Some one said about some one who was saying something
that seemed a very foolish thing to some one about how some one did
something, but that one was not saying foolish things, she was
judging from the feeling of being convenienced and inconvenienced
that she would be having and that was all that concerned her in her
judging. It was not a foolish thing then that that one had been
saying. No, there are many ways of not being a foolish one in being
living. There are certainly lots and lots of them of ways of not
being a foolish one in being in living. So then some certainly
could be convincing me of many things if I go on listening. I am
quite certain that this is certain.</p>

<p>David Hersland was a dead one before he was a middle aged one.
He was then never in his living an old one. He was dead before he
came to the middle of his middle living.</p>

<p>I am coming to know some whom I have known as middle aged ones,
as young ones. This is a pleasing thing.</p>

<p>David Hersland was a dead one before he was a middle aged one.
He was then never in his living a middle aged one. He was dead
before he came to the middle of his middle living.</p>

<p>I have come to know some as being young whom I have been knowing
as middle aged ones as coming to be old ones, I know now what ones
being young ones will come to be middle aged ones like some I have
been knowing as middle aged ones. This seems an easy thing. It is a
very difficult thing.</p>

<p>It is hard to be certain to one's feeling that some one one has
been knowing is a dead one, will not be a growing older one. Some
one was saying that his grandfather had been a dead one before his
grandfather was finished being a young one. That is a queer thing
that a grandfather was never in his own middle living.</p>

<p>I am coming to know now more and more of a group of them in men
and women what kind they are when they are young ones, when they
are middle aged ones, when they are old ones. To-night I came to be
certain about one group of them what kind they are when they are
young men when they are young women. I am not yet certain about
some groups of them what they are when they are old ones, I am not
certain about some groups of them what they are when they are
middle aged ones, I am not certain about some groups of them what
they are when they are young men when they are young women, I am
not certain about some groups of them what they are when they are
young ones younger than young women and young men. I am certain I
am not yet knowing all the kinds there are in men and women.</p>

<p>David Hersland was come to being one not being living before he
could come to be a middle aged one. He was not even then an older
one, an old one, a middle aged one. He came to be a dead one after
a considerable beginning of his middle living.</p>

<p>I know now how quite a number of groups that there are of men
and women are ones existing when they are young ones, that is young
women and young men, that is just ending their beginning living,
just beginning their middle living. I am beginning to know of some
groups in men and women, what they have as hands and faces and ears
and bodies to them and being in them, and ways of acting in them
when they are young men and young women, older young men and young
women, middle aged men and women, old men and women. I do not know
yet very much about what any group of them are when they are young
children. I am slowly spreading very slowly spreading to them, I
have not yet spread to them, not at all reached to them yet in
spreading out in knowing being in groups of men and women.</p>

<p>As I was saying David Hersland was a dead one before he was a
middle aged one. He was dead before he came to the middle of his
middle living. He was then never a middle aged one, he was then
never an old one. He was one of a kind in men and women. Certainly
each one is one of a kind in men and women. I am knowing more about
being in each group of them when every one of a group of them is a
young one, and an older one, an old one. I am knowing then being in
some groups of men and women as it is in them when they are young
men or women, older men or women, old men or women.</p>

<p>No one will listen while I am talking. Some have very much such
a trouble in being one being living. Some have not at all any of
such trouble in them. Some will listen when I am talking. Some will
not listen when I am talking. Some will listen while they are fat
ones, they do not listen when after dieting they have become thin
ones. These then listen to other ones and some of these other ones
could not get any listening from them before the dieting that made
these come to be thin ones from having been fat ones. Some are
listening to me now and before they were always listening every
evening to another one. They are listening to me now, I like them
to be listening. Some who are young men and young women are
listening to me now very often. Some who are now young men are
listening to me now very of ten, they listen to me and I am talking
very much now quite often to them. Some are very faithful in being
ones listening and these are not listening very often. I know very
well one such a one. Some quite older ones are listening but then
really I am not talking very much when they are listening. Some
have it to be certain that not any one ever is listening when they
are talking. Some of these are mistaken, some of these are not
mistaken. Some of these come to know it in them that they are not
listening being so certain in them that there can not ever be
conversation in any living for them. This will be soon a
description of being in David Hersland and how men and how women
listened to him, how some listened to him, how others listened to
him, how some heard him doing talking but never listened to him,
how some did not ever hear him doing any talking, how some forgot
about him, how some remembered him, how some talked to him, how
some said they would prefer not having ever to talk to him, how
some had to talk to him, how some stopped talking with him, how
some being with him liked what they were then doing, how some being
with him sometimes did not at all like that thing, how some told
him everything that they could think of telling and how some were
sorry they had told him and how some were not sorry they had told
him and how some wanted to go on telling him more and how some
forgot they had told him anything. This is then to be a description
of David Hersland of being and listening and talking and being
liked and disliked and remembered and forgotten and going on being
living and dying and being a dead one.</p>

<p>Some are listening to me and I tell them then the being they
have in them. I tell them what they have what they have not in
them, how it comes together, how it does not come together in them,
how the being they have in them is important to them, how it is not
important to them, how it can be active in them, how it can be not
active in them, why they like having their being in them, why they
do not like having their being in them. Mostly every one has
listened some when I have been telling them about being in them.
Some have listened and I have thought that they were believing what
I was telling them and then many years after they have been telling
that they were certain then that I was telling them then what I had
not any reason to believe was true of them. And sometimes then
later when they tell me such a thing they find it that I am not
certain that I was not then doing this thing. Some make of
themselves a new one by my telling them about the being in them and
to very many then they are quite a new one and to some then they
are not at all a new one, they are quite an old one. Some like
listening and later then they have a frightened feeling that I will
influence them to be another one, they do not like very well some
of them what they are in living, they do like some of them what
they are in living, they are quite certain they do not want me to
be influencing them. Some are listening and I am talking and I am
talking and then they ask a question and then I say to myself that
words can have a meaning to some one and a meaning to some other
one and that I was talking and that that one was intelligently
listening and that that one has then asked this question. I have
told so many so much about the being in them. I will tell I am
quite certain some more about the being in them. This will be now
much history of talking and listening. I talk one way and listen
one way and talk other ways and listen other ways and so probably
does every one. This is to be now very much description of talking
and listening, of a number of young men and young women talking and
of a number of older men and older women talking and of each one of
them the young men and young women and the older men and the older
women listening.</p>

<p>Some are certain that sometime some could be different ones in
being in being living, some are certain that sometime every one
will be a different one in being in being living, some are hoping
that sometime some one will be a different one, some are certain
that they are believing that something can be different in living
sometime for some, some are certain that they are believing that
something can be different in each one, some are believing this
thing about men some are believing this thing about women, some are
believing this thing about men and women, some are thinking they
are believing this thing, some are not believing that they are
believing this thing, some are always believing this thing, some
are not always believing this thing, I am not believing this thing,
another one is not believing this thing, another one is not
believing this thing, another one is believing this thing, another
one is believing this thing, another one is believing this thing,
another one is believing this thing, another one is not believing
this thing, another one is not believing this thing, another one is
not believing this thing, another one is believing this thing,
another one is believing this thing.</p>

<p>This is to be a history of David Hersland and of his coming in
his living to be thinking again and again and very often of coming
to be a dead one. This is to be a history of him and of his coming
to be thinking of coming to be a dead one and of his thinking about
coming to be a dead one and about being a dead one and about his
coming to be a dead one.</p>

<p>This then is to be now a history of David Hersland and of
talking and of listening and of thinking about being dead ones in
men and women men being in being living. This then is to be now a
history of David Hersland and of his talking and of his hearing
talking and of his listening and of other ones doing listening and
of very much talking and of thinking and feeling and of everything
that ever was or is or will be being in some men and some women
doing living. This then is to be now commencing being a history of
David Hersland being in living and being talking and being
listening and being talking and listening and being talking and
being talking and being talking and being listening and being
listening. This is then to be now a history of him.</p>

<p>Every one has experiencing in being one being living. I am
saddening with not feeling each one being experiencing as each one
is having that thing. I am saddening with this thing. There are so
many being in living and there are so many that I am knowing by
seeing and hearing being in living and each one of these is
experiencing in being living and I cannot be feeling what way each
one is experiencing, I who am suffering and suffering because of
this thing. I am in desolation and my eyes are large with needing
weeping and I have a flush from feverish feeling and I am not
knowing what way each one is experiencing in being living and about
some I am knowing in a general way and I could be knowing in a more
complete way if I could be living more with that one and I never
will live more with every one, I certainly cannot ever live with
each one in their being one being living, in my being one being
living. I tell you I cannot bear it this thing that I cannot be
realising experiencing in each one being living, I say it again and
again I cannot let myself be really resting in believing this
thing, it is in me now as when I am realising being a dead one, a
one being dying and I can do this thing and I do this thing and I
am filled then with complete desolation and I am doing this thing
again and again and I am now again and again certain that I will
not ever be realising experiencing in each one of very many men and
very many women, I can realise something of experiencing in some of
them, in them as kinds of them but I am needing to have it in me as
a complete thing of each one ever living and I know I will not, and
I am one knowing being a dead one and not being a living one, I who
am not believing that I will be realising each one's experiencing,
I do not want to realise each thing they are experiencing, I do not
care anything about such a thing, all that I am needing to be one
being living is to be realising completely how each one is
experiencing, with what feeling, thinking, believing, creating and
I I am very certain that I will not ever be completely with each
one doing such a thing, I will be doing something in such a thing
with kinds in men and women, with some of some kinds of them but
not with each one not with every one, no certainly not with every
one. No certainly not with every one, completely, certainly not,
and more and more knowing some one experiencing and completely
knowing that one makes it certain that if I could live with each
one I could realise the experiencing in each one and I cannot ever
live with each one, I certainly never will be living a good deal
with each one ever having been living.</p>

<p>David in beginning living was hearing some, was feeling some
about somethings being things that one should be doing so as to be
one going on being living. Such a thing as not changing a thing
when one was beginning putting it on one way and such a thing as
counting some things and not other things and such a thing as
arranging clothing so that not in any way could he be putting one
thing on the way he had been putting that thing on the other
morning and stepping on something and not stepping on something and
thinking something and then certainly thinking then another thing,
and doing something and certainly then be doing another thing, and
hoping something and saying then another thing, and walking around
something and walking around that same thing and never walking
again around that same thing, as I was saying when he was one
beginning being living he was hearing then when he was one
beginning living some things, he was feeling then some things about
needing somethings being happening so that he could become one
going on being living and he was then as I was saying hearing some
things, he was then feeling some things that needed being so that
he could be one going on being in being living.</p>

<p>He was one then as I was saying commencing being in living and
he was then a little an older one and this is to be now a complete
history of him and of listening and of talking and of some doing
listening and doing talking.</p>

<p>One and then another and then another one and then another one
said something and then some other one said something and some one
can listen to every one who says something. There are not so many
kinds in men and women, I have just been seeing pictures of about
fifteen kinds of them, kinds of men and women, there are more than
that of course of kinds in men and women as I feel being being in
them but there are not so very many kinds in men and women. Each
one talks a good deal in being in living even those who do not do
very much talking. Every one who ever was living talks a good deal
that is certain. Every one ever living talks a good deal, some are
talking and others are listening and those then talking are
thinking that those then listening are ones not ever doing very
much talking and some of them do very much talking and some of them
do not do so very much talking. Some one talks a good deal in being
living, every one listens a good deal in being living, this is to
be now a description of talking and listening, this is to be now a
description of being and living in David Hersland, of David
Hersland.</p>

<p>There are not then so many kinds in men and women. Each one of
every kind in men and women is as I am saying doing very much
talking doing very much listening in being living, some of each
kind in men and women do more talking in being living than others
of that kind of them, some of each kind in men and women do more
listening than others of that kind of them, some of each kind in
men and women do more talking and more listening than others of
that kind of them, that kind in men and women. I am saying that
there are not so very many kinds in men and women as I am feeling
being in men and women, but as I was saying each one of a kind in
men and women has being in that one being differently in him from
being in any other one of that kind of them. I am now beginning
describing being in David Hersland, I will be telling very much now
about talking and listening, I will be describing in many various
ways quite a number of men and quite a number of women.</p>

<p>Each one is mostly all his living all her living, a young one,
an older one, one in middle living, an old one to themselves, to
any one, to some one. That is to say not any one is all his living
all her living to any one, that is to say not any one hardly is
feeling another one being a young one and then an older one and
then an old one. It is a very strange thing this thing and an
interesting thing that almost not any one is to any one is to
themselves inside them one having been in all parts of being
living. That is to say it is very striking one man is writing about
some one and that one about whom that one is writing is to that one
say an old man. That one writing tells about that man being a young
one, tells about that man being a middle aged one and always it is
a description of the old man who was once a young man, a child, a
middle aged man, it is not a description of a young man a middle
aged man or a child. It is the same thing if some one is a child to
some one feeling that one, telling about that one, that one may be
described as an older one, a middle aged one an old one but it is
always then a description of a child having become a middle aged
one, an older one, an old one. So then this is certain that each
one is to some one for all of the living ever in that one a child,
to some one, a baby, to some one, an older one, to some one, a
middle aged one, to some one, an old one, to some one. I am not
saying that not any one can be feeling more than one stage of being
in themselves, in any other one, but I am really almost saying this
thing. It is an interesting thing that each one in a way is feeling
the world being existing in this kind of way too in them. Those
feeling the world an old thing are only feeling this thing, those
feeling the world a new thing are only feeling this thing, those
feeling the world to be having had a past living are only feeling
it as a thing having description and so on and so on and it is
extraordinary how not any one can be convincing in telling about
one being a young man if they are feeling the living being in that
one being that of an old one. Mostly every one is in some place in
being living to every one knowing that one and that is the complete
realisation that each one is having of that one. Always then this
comes to be to me more an extraordinary thing that not any one can
really be telling the whole history, can really be realising the
whole going on of being in them, that not any one can be telling
the whole history of any one, that not any one can be realising the
whole time of being going on being of being in any one. I do
certainly think this to be an extraordinary thing. Mostly then as I
am saying not any one is feeling any other one really having been
in living a young one an older one a middle aged one, an old one.
Really then mostly every one all the living of some one is feeling
that one to have been a young one or an older one, or a middle aged
one or an old one.</p>

<p>Listening does not help one with this thing because as I am
saying each one is feeling themselves as having been an old one, a
middle aged one, a younger one, a young one all their living and
when they an old one talk about themselves as a young one, it is a
description of an old one having been a young one, not a realising
of being a young one, and so on and so on and so each one is in
themselves in feeling one having been in all living a young one, or
an older one, or a middle aged one, or an old one.</p>

<p>I did use to find this very perplexing this difficulty each one
has of realising whole being having been going on being in any one,
in themselves inside them. It is a very useful thing that always in
living there are some being young ones some being older ones, some
being middle aged ones, some being older ones so that one can
always be certain that not any one has been living without all the
being in them having been going on being as being a young one an
older one a middle aged one, an old one. As I was saying listening
is not helping any one very much with this thing, knowing ones self
inside one is not helping one very much with this thing, talking
about being having been in one is not helping one very much with
this thing. Knowing family living is helping some with this thing,
having little ways in moments inside one in feeling, in doing
something perhaps is helping something with this thing, mostly not
anything is really helping one doing this thing, realising the
whole being having been, going on, going to be going on in any one.
So then I am not thinking about doing this thing. I am thinking
about telling about being being in men and in women, I am thinking
about telling about talking and listening that some men and some
women are doing, that mostly every one is or was or will be doing.
I am thinking then about telling about knowing being being in men
and in women. I am thinking then about listening and talking being,
going to be being, having been being in some men in some women.</p>

<p>David Hersland was interested in dying, in loving, in talking,
in listening, in ways of eating, in ways of being going on being in
living. He came to be a dead one when he was coming to the
beginning of the middle of his middle living; this will be now a
complete description of the being being in him and the living he
was having in being one being living.</p>

<p>He was one interested in ways of eating, in loving, in ways of
being going on being living, in dying, in listening, in talking. He
was one living in needing to be certain always and that always
every day in his living that he was understanding that living was a
thing that he wanted then to be doing, that he was then realising

<p>I am now beginning a description of being having been in David
Hersland, the being, the living in him, the talking and listening
he was doing in living, the ways he was eating, loving in him,
dying in him, going on being living in him when he was one going on
being living in living. I am now beginning a description of David

of the being in him and the living in him and the talking he did in
living, and the listening he did in living, and the loving he did
in living, and the going on being living he did in living and the
dying he did when he was being living and I will give one

and the things that were interesting to him in listening and in

going on living, in ways of eating, he was certainly then one
mostly all his living almost completely interested in his being one

going on being living.</p>

<p>I will now be telling about David Hersland being one of Hersland
family living, having Hersland family living as living for him,
having Gossols half country half city living as a way of having
living in him. I will now be telling about living being in David
Hersland when he was quite a little one when he was a bigger one,
when he was as big one as he ever was in being one being living. I
will now be telling about being being in him and I will tell of
course a good deal about the being being in him. Naturally I will
tell a great deal about living and being being in David Hersland.
He was living in Gossols in a part of Gossols where not any rich
people were living. He was living the Hersland's half-country,
half-city living. He was living the half country half city living
of the men and women and children living in that part of Gossols
where the Herslands were living. He was living the living he was
naturally living from the being he had as being in him. This is to
be now some description of him. This is to be now of course very
much history of him. This will be naturally a description, some
description, many descriptions of very many men and very many
women. This will be then very much description of David Hersland,
of being, of living, of dying, of listening, of talking, of going
on being living, of going on being in living, of ways of
eating.</p>

<p>David Hersland was all his younger and young living living in
Gossols and he was knowing then the Hersland family and any one
knowing the Hersland family then and he was knowing every one
living in the part of Gossols he was living in, mostly every one,
and he was knowing some others too then. He was talking some then
and listening some then, certainly he was listening some then and
talking some then. I have already told something about his having
been one listening some then about his having been one talking some
then.</p>

<p>David Hersland would have liked it very well all his living to
like every kind there is of women. He would have liked very well to
have had this in him all his living. He would have liked all of his
living to feel beauty in any kind there is of women. He would have
liked it very well to feel in him beauty being in each one in all
women. He would have liked very well in every bit of being living
to be feeling each woman a beautiful thing to be being in living.
He certainly would have liked very well all his living to be
finding every woman every kind of woman a beautiful one in being
loving. This is to be then a history of living being in David
Hersland, of loving, listening, talking, going on being living,
dying, ways of feeling going on being living in him. He is then one
I am going to be now beginning describing.</p>

<p>He would have liked it very well to be having all his living
each woman ever living to be a beautiful one to him. He wanted it
then that all his living every woman he could come to be knowing
should be to him, would be for him a beautiful one. He wanted this
thing all his living. He wanted always that any woman, that every
woman was a beautiful woman to him, was a beautiful woman being a
woman being living. He was then one certainly being interested all
his living in dying, loving, ways of eating, ways of going on being
in living, talking and listening. He was one then all his living
one certainly almost being one completely interested in being one
being living. This is to be now a history of living being and
having been in some men and some women.</p>

<p>David was one being then being one almost completely interested
in being living from the beginning of his being one being living.
As I have been saying this is to be now a description of his being
one being living. I am beginning now this description of him, a
description of all living being in him of all the being in him.</p>

<p>I am realising being in some men, men succeeding completely in
living, I will tell sometime about some of them. Some men are very
active in being living, some men are not so very active in being
living, some men and some women are very active in being living,
some men and some women are not very active in being living. Some
men are very active in being living and are succeeding very well in
being living, some men are very active in being living and are not
succeeding very well in being living, some men and some women are
succeeding very well in being living, some men and some women are
not succeeding very well in being living.</p>

<p>Some men and some women have being very actively in them and are
succeeding very well in being living and are not very convincing to
some knowing them all their living, some men and some women have
being very actively in them and are succeeding very well in being
living and are convincing to very many knowing them all their
living. I certainly will try to tell all I am realising of being in
men and women. I will try sometime to tell all I am realising of
being in some having being very actively in them and succeeding
completely well in being in living and being convincing to many
knowing them all their living, of being in some having being
actively in them and being ones succeeding completely in living and
being convincing as being really interesting to some knowing them
all their living, of being in some having being actively in them
and being ones succeeding astonishingly succeeding and being
convincingly interesting to some and being certainly not
convincingly interesting to some and being some convincingly
interesting to some and being some not convincingly interesting to
some, I can try to tell all I am realising about being being in men
and in women. I can try to realise completely all being in each
one. I am trying to be realising all being in each one. I am
quarrelling with some, I am hurting some, I am winning with some, I
am beginning with some, I am being hurt by some, I am neglecting
some, I am wanting some, I am forgetting some, I am happy with
some, I am kissing some, I have been telling some I did not know
that that one was feeling that thing and that one was telling me
then that that one did not know I was feeling that thing, I
certainly did have resentment against some one, I certainly did not
like what some one did when I was doing something, I am trying to
be realising being, I can try to do this thing. This is to be now a
complete description of all the being I ever have been realising as
being in David Hersland and very many he knew and ones who knew
him. This then is to be a description. This then is to be a history
of him and of some whom he knew, of some who knew him, this then is
to be a history of all of him and of some whom he knew, of all of
him and of some who knew him.</p>

<p>He began living and this is to be now a little description of
that beginning. He went on being living and this is to be then a
description of that thing. He still went on living and this is then
to be a description of that thing. He came to be a dead one and
this will be then a description of that thing. He began being
living and this is to be now some description of this thing.</p>

<p>I am troubled with men and with women, I am troubled by men and
by women. I am troubled that each one is experiencing each thing
they are experiencing the way each one is experiencing each thing.
I do not want that any one should experience anything any way but
the way each one is experiencing that thing. I certainly do not
want it that any one should experience anything in any way that
that one is not experiencing a thing. No I do not want anything to
be at all a different thing in the way each one is experiencing
each thing, no I do not want anything to be different in
experiencing than it is in each one, I certainly do not, I may but
I doubt it, I certainly do not, I am certain of this thing. I
certainly do not want any one to be experiencing anything in a
different way than the way they have it in them to experience that
thing. I am troubled as I was saying with each one being one
experiencing the way each one is experiencing, I am troubled by
each one experiencing the way each one is experiencing each thing.
I am troubled, I say I am very much troubled by each one being that
one experiencing each thing as that one is experiencing that thing.
I certainly am very much troubled with this thing. Each one is
experiencing each thing in the way that one is experiencing each
thing. I certainly do not at all want that each one should not be
experiencing each thing the way that one is experiencing that
thing. Some say I do want each one to be experiencing differently
from the way each one is experiencing each thing, I may but I doubt
this thing, I certainly am certain that I do not want that each one
is experiencing each thing differently from the way each one is
experiencing each thing. So then I want it that each one is
experiencing each thing the way each one is experiencing each
thing. I certainly do not want it that each one is experiencing
each thing in a way each one is not experiencing each thing. I am
as I am saying troubled with each one experiencing each thing the
way each one is experiencing each thing. I certainly am troubled by
each one being experiencing each thing the way each one is
experiencing each thing.</p>

<p>Some are not succeeding in living, some are succeeding in
living. Some are feeling some one to be one succeeding in living,
some are not feeling that one to be one succeeding in living. Some
are ones being certain that sometime something will be working in a
different way from the way that thing is now working. Some are
certain that everything will be working differently from the way
everything is now working. Some as I am saying are understanding
something one way, some as I am saying are understanding something
another way. Some are beginning with understanding, some are ending
with understanding. Some are realising experiencing in some one
when that other one has done something. Some are realising
experiencing in some one when that some one has commenced doing
something. Some are realising experiencing in some one when some
one has completely done something. Some are realising experiencing
in each one while each one is doing being experiencing. I certainly
am very troubled by each one being one experiencing each thing they
are experiencing.</p>

<p>I said there are very many men and very many women always being
living. I said there are very many men and very many women
experiencing each thing they are each one experiencing. I said
there are very many men and very many women always, there certainly
are very many men and very many women always living.</p>

<p>David Hersland knew very many being living while he was one
being living. He knew some when he was a little one, an older one,
one beginning being in middle living. He certainly did know quite a
number who were being living while he was being living.</p>

<p>He knew some of them longer than he did other ones, he talked
more to some than he did to other ones, he forgot some more than he
did other ones, he listened to some more than he did to other ones,
he liked some better than he did other ones, he loved some more
than he did other ones, he was liked more by some than he was by
other ones, he was remembered more by some than he was by other
ones. He knew then a good many who were living when he was living.
There were a very great many who were living when he was living. He
knew some who were living when he was living. There were some whom
he knew all his living, there were some whom he knew a very short
time in his living. I certainly will be trying to tell about each
one ever having been, going to be, being living, I certainly will
now tell about each one David Hersland was knowing and about each
one who knew him. I certainly am now trying to be beginning telling
about each one David Hersland knew in his living about each one who
in his living knew him.</p>

<p>I certainly am now trying to be beginning to tell about David
Hersland being living, I certainly am going to be trying to tell
about David Hersland being living, about each one he knew when he
was being living, about each one who while he was being living knew
him. Many women have it in them to be sometimes loving some one.
Many of such of them have it in them then to be laying their hand
on that one, to be feeling inside in them then and out from them
the way any one being one having feeling of being some one
directing any living is feeling, being some one giving something is
feeling, being some one receiving something is feeling, being some
one many might be finding it necessary to be respectfully
addressing is feeling, being some one who is some one who is an
important one by reason of being one being born to be in living is
feeling. This feeling in the one having that feeling is mostly a
very nice thing to that one having that feeling, it is sometimes a
very nice thing to the one loving that one, it is sometimes not at
all a nice thing to some one loving that one, it is sometimes a
nice thing to some seeing that one having that feeling, it is to
some seeing one having that way of feeling a very funny thing, to
some a very unpleasant thing, to some a serious thing, to some a
curious thing. However it is certain that very many women having
feeling in them of loving some one have then a feeling of being
some one having it in them to be important to every one as being
one having been born to be living. They are then acting that way in
being one being one loving some one. As I am saying some have one
feeling about such a thing, some have another feeling about such a
thing. Some have a feeling of being impressed by any woman having
such a feeling of being one being important by being one having
been born to be living in being in living, being important as being
one being born and being living. Very many women as I am saying are
sometime, are sometimes loving some man and as I am saying some of
such of them have it then in them to have of their kind of them the
feeling and the manner then of being one having it in them to be
one directing living. Very many women are sometime, are sometimes
loving some man and as I am saying some of such of them have it
then in them to have of their kind of them the feeling and the
manner then of being one having it in them to be one being
important by reason of having been one being born to being in
living. As I am saying very many women are sometime, are sometimes
loving some man and as I am saying some of such of them have it
then in them to have of their kind of them the feeling and the
manner then of being one having it in them to be important to every
one because of being existing and that is enough as it is to any
one in any position where they are and not anybody in any way can
move them. Anyway very many women having loving in them are having
then the feeling and the acting of being ones being born important
ones to any one. As I am saying each one having this feeling is
acting then the way their kind of them is naturally acting having
such a feeling. As I am saying some feel one way some feel another
way in feeling, seeing some woman having such a feeling. David
Hersland as I was saying was one having it that each woman having
loving in them had on him some effect to make of him in some way
one submitting to that one. He was then one in a way doing very
much submitting. Some liked this in him, some did not like this in
him, some found him one very unpleasant in being one being living,
some found him very attracting in being one being living. Any how
this is to be now a complete history of him and this time I am
certain to be beginning with his beginning being one being in
living.</p>

<p>Some come to be a dead one before they come to be a middle aged
one, some come to be a dead one before they come to be an old one.
Some come to be a dead one before they come to be the ending of the
beginning of their middle living. David Hersland came to be a dead
one before he came to be at the ending of the beginning of his
middle living.</p>

<p>Quite a number come to be dead ones before they come to be old
ones. Quite a number come to be dead ones before they come to be
middle aged ones. Quite a number come to be dead ones before they
come to the beginning of coming to be a middle aged one. Some then
really come to be dead ones before they come to the ending of the
beginning of their middle living. Some of these might have been
succeeding in living if they had gone on being living, some of
these might have been not succeeding in living if they had gone on
then being living. Some then come to be quite really dead ones
before the ending of the beginning of their middle living. Some do
not come to be dead ones before the ending of their beginning
middle living. Quite a number do not come to being dead ones before
the ending of the beginning of their middle living. David Hersland
as I was saying came to be a dead one before he came to be at the
ending of his beginning being in his middle living. David Hersland
might have been one succeeding if he had gone on being living,
David Hersland might have been one not succeeding if he had gone on
being living. So then certainly some men, some women come to be
really dead ones before the ending of the beginning of their middle
living. Certainly quite a number of men and quite a number of women
come to be dead before they come to be at the ending of the
beginning of their middle living. Some as I was saying of these if
they had gone on being living would have been succeeding well
enough in living, some of these as I was saying would certainly not
have been succeeding very well in being living. David Hersland as I
said of him was one who came to be one being dead before he came to
be one beginning being in the middle of his middle living, he was
one as I have said of him who might have been one succeeding in
living if he had been one going on being living, he might have been
one failing in living if he had been one going on being living.
Some who have come to be dead ones before they have come to the
beginning of the middle of their middle living would certainly have
been succeeding if they had been ones going on being living. Some
who come to be dead ones before the beginning of the middle of the
middle of their living would have been really failing if they had
gone on being living. I am going now to be telling about being and
living being in David Hersland from his beginning being in living
to his coming to be one not being any longer being living. I cannot
tell to any one how completely very many come to be dying and quite
dead ones before they come to the beginning of the middle of their
middle living. I am telling to myself that I am certain of this
thing. I am telling that some of these would have been succeeding
in living if they had been ones not coming to be dead ones before
the beginning of the middle of their middle living. I am also
telling that some of these would have been failing in living if
they had been ones going on being living to the ending of their
middle living, if they had been ones going on to being old ones in
being living. As I am certainly saying David Hersland was one
coming to be a dead one before the ending of the beginning of his
middle living. This is now to be a complete history of being and
living in him.</p>

<p>Not any one could be certain all their living that any other one
is completely living their living. Almost not any one can be
certain that any other one is completely living the living of that
one. Mostly not any one is believing all their living that any
other one is completely living the living of that one. Mostly every
one is believing that some one could be completely living all the
living of that one. Some to themselves inside them are believing
they are completely living the living of them. Some to themselves
inside them are not believing that they are completely living the
living of them. Mostly not any one is believing of any other one
that that one is completely living the living of them. Some are
believing that some one is completely living the living of that
one. Some could be believing that some one is completely living the
being in him, some could be believing that some one is completely
living the being in her, some could not be believing that any one
could be completely living the living in that one. Mostly not any
one is really believing that any other one is completely living
their living, some are believing that some are living completely
the living in them, very many are not believing anything about this
thing, mostly every one is believing something about this thing. So
then very many are always being living. There are some certainly
believing that some one can be completely living the living in
them, some are certainly believing that every one can be completely
living the living in them. Certainly some are certain that some are
realising meaning in being one completely living their living,
certainly some are certain that every one can be realising the
meaning in being one completely living their living, some are
certain that perhaps some one can be realising the meaning of being
one being completely living in their living, certainly some are
certain that certainly not any one can be realising any meaning in
one living completely all their living.</p>

<p>Certainly then each one is himself each one is herself,
certainly.</p>

<p>Certainly then each one is himself each one is herself certainly
then each one is that one in being one being living. Some are
certain that each one could be one being certain of something. Some
are certain that some could be ones being certain of something,
some are not at all certain about any one being certain of
anything, some are quite certain about every one being certain
about one thing, some are quite certain that every one is certain
about the same thing, some are not at all certain about every one
being certain about the same thing, some are thinking that some
time they might come they might come to have come to be certain
that every one is certain about the same thing, there are very many
quite certain that every one can be certain about the same thing,
there are very many quite certain that every one is certain about
the same thing, there are some there are many quite certain that
not every one is certain about the same thing, there are some
certainly certain that each one is certain of something, there are
certainly some quite certain that very many are not certain of even
one thing, there are certainly some quite certain that some are not
ever certain of any one thing, there are some who are not certain
about any one being certain of anything, there are certainly very
many certain that every one is certain of the same thing, there are
certainly very many certain that every one can be certain of the
same thing, there are certainly some that are certain that not
every one can be certain about the same thing, there are certainly
some who are certain that each one is certain of something, there
are certainly some that are certain that not each one is certain of
something, there are some that are coming to be certain of
something about every one being or not being certain, there are
some not coming to be certain about each one being or not being
certain about something. There are some saying something and saying
it again and again, there are some saying something and not saying
it again and again, there are some saying one thing and then saying
another thing, there are some saying one thing and then saying
another and then saying another thing, there are some saying one
thing and saying it again and then saying another thing and saying
it again and again and again. Mostly every one is more or less
always saying something. Mostly every one is sometimes saying
something. Mostly every one is quite often saying something. Some
times one is saying something and another one is saying the same
thing, sometimes one is saying something and another one is not
then saying that thing, sometimes one is saying something and
another one is saying that thing and then is saying another thing.
This is very often happening. Very many then are always being
living. Mostly every one is more or less saying something quite
often and mostly every one is more or less hearing that some one is
saying something. This is to be now a complete description of David
Hersland before his beginning being in living and sometime there
will be some description about some thinking about his being about
his not being one living completely his living. I said of him that
he came to be one not any longer being living before he came to be
at the end of the beginning of his middle living. This will be now
a beginning of description of being and living in him.</p>

<p>In beginning his living David Hersland was of course a very
little one and he was then quite interesting to some. In beginning
his living he was of course not remembering anything and there were
some who later remembered about him then. In beginning his living
he was of course completely a very small one, he was beginning
living and he was then going on in being living and he then went on
being in living and he was then not such a very little one. He was
then in being one beginning being in living a very little one. Then
he was going on being in living and always more and more then he
was coming to be not such a very little one. He was in beginning
being living a completely small one. As I was saying he was a
younger one, he came to be living after Martha and after Alfred
Hersland had each of them been sometime living. Mr. Hersland had
always intended to have three children and as I was saying there
had been two and these two had not gone on being living and so
David Hersland came to be living and sometime later in some way he
heard this thing when he was still quite a young one and he had it
in him then to be certain that being living is a very queer thing,
he being one being living and yet it was only because two others
had not been ones going on being living. It was to him then that he
was certain then that being living was a queer thing. As I said of
him in a way he was needing it that every moment he was one being
one being living by realising then that he was one needing then
being one being living. He was in a way then as I was saying
needing to be certain that he realised in him every minute in being
living needing being being living. He certainly was one for
sometime going on being living. He went on for sometime being one
going on being living. As I was saying he could have it in him to
be feeling that it was a very queer thing to be one being living.
He was one that could be realising very much and very often that he
was needing being one being living. He was one needing to be
understanding every minute in being living what meaning there was
to him in his needing to be to him one being being living. He
certainly then could have it in him to be going on being living. He
certainly could have it in him to feel it to be a queer thing to be
one being living. He was one then as I was saying who was a very
little one in beginning living as mostly every one must be in being
one beginning being living, he was then one beginning being living,
he was then a very small one, he was the youngest of the three
Hersland children, he was quite pleasant to the Hersland family
then, all his living he was not unpleasant to any one of them the
Hersland family, this is to be now quite a complete history of
him.</p>

<p>One man has one kind of way of feeling something, something that
is existing. Something is an object being existing, it can be
anything any kind of a thing. One man sees it as a thing having
solidly being existing. This man has it that he realises a thing
having solidly being existing, he does not realise that a thing has
character making it a particular thing, he does not realise that it
has expression its way of telling any one that it is that kind of
thing, he does realise it as having existence in relation to other
things being existing that is to say he does realise that other
things are at the same time solidly existing and each thing has to
have its room for being existing and so for each one to have this
solid existing makes a relation being between things being
existing. This is one man having realisation of anything.</p>

<p>Another one has it that he has it to be realising completely the
character of each thing, anything, has it to be realising
completely the way each thing would be telling the character it has
in being living by repeating if each thing could be expressing the
character of that thing to any one. This one has that thing so that
each thing is existing, not by description, by really being in
having completely character in being existing. This one has then a
realising a complete realising of each thing being in relation to
any other thing. This one has completely the realisation of this
thing. This one has some sense of a thing of each thing being
solidly existing but not so much as this one is needing to make
this one be a slow one in growing realisation.</p>

<p>There is another one and this is the one that is different from
these two. This one has realisation of a thing having solid
existing, this one has realisation of character in each thing, this
one has realisation of relation existing between everything so that
each thing is existing at the same time as every other thing is
existing and this one has emotion in him about each one of three
things he is realising about each thing. This is another kind of a
one.</p>

<p>There are some who realise it of each thing that it is a pretty
thing, there are some that realise it of each thing that it is an
ugly thing, there are some who realise it of each thing that it is
a funny thing, there are some who realise it of each thing that it
is a tender thing, there are some who realise it of each thing that
it has a pretty color, there are some who realise it of each thing
that it has a pretty shape, there are some who realise it of each
thing that it has a meaning, there are some who realise it of each
thing that it is a queer thing, there are some that realise it of
each thing that it is an unpleasant thing, there are some who
realise it of each thing that it would be pretty if it were in a
garden, there are some who realise it of each thing that it would
be a nice thing if it were in a room with simple furnishing, there
are some who realise it of each thing that it is a thing a nice
thing when it is in a room which is not a very light one, the re
are some realising that each thing is part of a story any one can
be telling about anything, there are some that are realising each
thing is a nice thing if it is exciting to love that thing, in a
way then every one has it in them to feel something about things
being in being existing.</p>

<p>Now I am telling about another one. One this one has a gift of
expression of expressing something and that is a beautiful thing
that is to say the means of expressing something in this one is a
beautiful thing and this one is one wanting to be expressing the
existence the character of anything. Now this one has complete
emotions about the means this one has for expressing anything, this
one certainly has not any emotion about anything that is being
existing. This one has not a realisation of something being solidly
existing, this one has not a realisation of the character of
anything, of the way anything could be experiencing being existing,
this one has not any realisation of anything being in relation to
any other thing and this is a natural thing when one is realising
the being in this one. This one is needing being one realising
anything as existing so that this one can be having something to be
using his beautiful means of expression on. So then this one has a
practical realisation of everything being existing.</p>

<p>These then are some ways of being ones realising anything. I
will not now tell about other ones. I will not tell now about other
ones.</p>

<p>David Hersland as I was saying was one wanting it that he should
be one realising every minute what there was in life to be a thing
going on being doing. He was one doing this thing in all of his
living from the beginning of being one being living to the end of
his being one being living, that is to say from his being in the
middle of his beginning being living to the ending of the beginning
of the middle of being living.</p>

<p>As I was saying the last one I have been just describing was one
needing to be certain that things are existing so that he could be
using his beautiful means of expression. There are some having not
such beautiful means of expression who are needing for their means
of expression that they have as being, are needing realising that
things are existing, are practically needing this thing. There are
some, and these are a different kind, in whom the means of
expression is the thing really existing, and these are to
themselves not needing it that they have a practical need of
realising things being existing. I cannot tell enough about every
one, certainly not. Then there are very many realising objects not
as being existing but as being acting one in relation to another
one, this is very common, for very many of such of them things are
really being existing, for very many of such of them things being
existing is only a practical thing so that they can be being in
relation, they are not really being existing they are acting for
themselves, for some other one, toward themselves, toward some
other thing but now I am getting empty of realising and so I will
not now be saying any more about any one, not completely empty of
realising but emptier than I have been.</p>

<p>David Hersland was then certainly for himself almost completely,
for some other ones completely, for some quite some interesting. He
was then one being completely interesting to some, almost
completely interesting to himself as being one being existing,
quite interesting to very many, he was in short one quite
interesting in being one being living to very many and a little
some to almost every one knowing him. This is certainly now to be a
history of him, of his being one being living and being to quite
some quite interesting.</p>

<p>So then each one has a kind of way of feeling everything being
existing and this is to be now a complete history of David Hersland
knowing everything he knew in being one being living and of
everything any one he came to know knowing anything came to know in
being living. Certainly now I will begin again.</p>

<p>Very many are talking, very many are listening, David Hersland
certainly in being one being living was one being one talking was
being one listening. Certainly he was one beginning being one being
talking being one being listening quite from the beginning of the
middle of his beginning being one being existing in being living.
He was one then certainly all his living being one being listening
being one being talking. He was interesting to quite a number in
being one being listening, he was interesting to quite a number in
being one being talking. Quite a number were interesting to him as
being ones being listening, quite a number were interesting to him
as being ones being talking. He was one as I was saying who was
wanting to be needing it that every woman was to him a beautiful
one in being living. This was in him from the ending of the middle
of his beginning living to the ending of the beginning of his
middle living and then he was one not any longer being living.
Certainly wanting to be needing that every woman was a beautiful
thing in being one being living was in him in the beginning of his
being in his middle living. This is to be now a description of
being in him and of living in him in the beginning of his being one
being living.</p>

<p>Two knowing each other all their living might tell each other
sometime what each one of them thought the other one had been,
thought the other one would be doing in being living. Two having
known each other very well in their living might tell each other
what each one thought really about the other. Two knowing each
other very well in living might be doing this thing. Two knowing
each other very well in living might know each one what that one
thought of the other one. Two knowing each other very well in
living might be thinking that they were knowing what the other one
knew about each other one. Two knowing each other very well in
living might be knowing what each one thought about each other one.
Two knowing each other very well in living might be thinking they
are knowing what each one is thinking about being and about living
in the other one. Two knowing each other very well in being living
might be thinking they are not knowing what the other one is
thinking about the other one. Two knowing each other very well in
living might be telling each one of them to some one what they are
thinking of the other one. Two knowing each other very well in
living might not be telling any one what they are each one of them
thinking about the other one. Two knowing each other very well in
living one of them might be telling the other one sometime what
that one was thinking of the other one. Two knowing each other in
living one might be telling some one sometimes what that one
thought of the other one. Two knowing each other very well in
living one of them might be sometime telling some one what that one
had often been thinking about being, about living in the other one.
Two knowing each other very well in living one of them might
sometime tell some one what that one had come to think about the
being and the living in the other one. So then very often there are
two living knowing each other very Well in living. Some of such of
them then are certain that they are knowing what the other one
thinks of that one. Some are not certain that they are knowing what
the other one thinks of that one. Some are knowing what the other
one thinks of that one. Some are not knowing what the other one
thinks of being and living in that one. Some are often wondering
what the other one is thinking of being and living in that one.
Some are never at all wondering about what the other one is
thinking about that one. To some it would be a pleasant thing to
know certainly what the other one is thinking about that one. To
some it would not be at all a pleasant thing to know certainly what
the other one is thinking about being and about living in that ore.
Some sometime talk to some one about what the other one is thinking
about being and living being in that one. Some sometimes talk to
the other one about what the other one is thinking about being and
living being in either of them, in one of them: Some are talking to
every one they are knowing about what the other one is thinking
about being and living being in that one. Some are for a very long
time having a feeling of being one knowing about thinking about
being and living in both of them in both of them. Two of two of
them sometimes for a very long time have a quite certain feeling
about knowing about thinking about being and living in both of them
in the two of them. Certainly there are very often in living being
two of them knowing each other certainly very well in being living.
Certainly very often one of them has a feeling of knowing or not
knowing what the other one is thinking about the being and living
in that one.</p>

<p>David Hersland as I was saying was one being interested in his
being one being living. He was one being interested in quite a
number of other ones being ones being living. Some are not
interested in ones being living. David Hersland was interested in
ones being living. He was one as I was saying almost completely
interested in being one being living. He was one, as I was saying,
to himself almost one being completely, almost being completely
living. He was one interested in some being ones being living. He
was one in a way interested in every one he came to be knowing, in
any one who came to know him. He was one as I was saying interested
in his being one being living, almost completely interested in
being living, he was one almost completely living. This is to be
now some description of his being a quite young one in living.</p>

<p>They talked in different ways about different things, some
talked in some way about something then talked in another way about
something, some talked in some way about something then talked in
another way about another thing, some talked in the same way about
a good many things, mostly every one talked a good deal about
something, mostly every one talked a good deal about a number of
things. Mostly, all his living, David Hersland talked a good deal
about something, mostly all his living he talked a good deal about
a good many things. He liked it certainly so mostly every one was
saying sometime about him to do a good deal of talking, in a way to
himself and to very many knowing he did not like doing a good deal
of talking. Any way he certainly did considerable talking while he
was one being one being in living. As I was saying he came to be a
dead one at the end of the beginning of his middle living. To some
this was a very sad thing, to some this was a sad enough thing, in
a way to some it was not at all an interesting thing, to some it
was for quite a very long time a very interesting thing. Some found
it then a very interesting thing to be wondering whether he would
have been one having been succeeding in living if he had been one
being living a reasonably long time. Some certainly thought this to
be an exceedingly interesting question.</p>

<p>As I was saying the Herslands lived where a good many other
people were living when David Hersland was a young one, was
beginning being in living. As I was saying each one he was then
knowing talked some about something, talked some about a good many
things. David Hersland then talked some about something, talked
then some about a good many things. He was then one talking and
listening and so was everybody else doing that thing, those he was
seeing then. He was living in Hersland family living then, he was
living in that part of Gossols living then where the Hersland
family were living then. This is to be now some description of
living he was doing then and the living some other ones were doing
then in their daily living.</p>

<p>Some one and that one is quite reasonably an observing one is
seeing some one sitting and that one is to very many looking an
interesting enough one and then that one the one that is reasonably
observing says of this one the one sitting and being interesting to
quite a number who were looking that way just then that this one is
certainly quite entirely a stupid one, that one can tell that by
observing that one and knowing so that that one is not at all
really an interesting thing. This one then tells about that one the
one sitting and it is certainly true what the one telling is
telling about that one, it is quite a good description and it is
pleasantly then an astonishing thing to be certain that the one
describing the other one from observation is extraordinarily of the
same quality and having been having the same history in being
living as the one that one has been describing and quite correctly
describing as one not interesting in being living and one at whom
very many are quite a good deal looking. This kind of thing
happening was the interesting thing in some being in being living
to David Hersland in almost any part of his being in living. As I
was saying of him he certainly was one wanting to be needing that
every woman ever living should be a beautiful thing to him in his
feeling.</p>

<p>David Hersland was one certainly enjoying some kind of things
that were happening. He certainly very often was enjoying things
having been happening. This is to be now a quite complete history
of him from his beginning to his ending.</p>

<p>He was playing some when he was a young one, he was believing
somethings then pretty nearly believing some things then, reading
some then, talking some then, listening some then, eating a good
deal sometimes then, deciding some things then when not anybody had
asked him to decide a thing, being listened to some then when he
was deciding some thing then, liking it pretty nearly entirely then
that some were listening while he was deciding something then,
pretty nearly entirely liking it that he was one being going on
being living then. He knew a good many then, a good many in a way
knew him then, he was living in Hersland family living then, he was
living inside him to himself some then, he was living half country
half city living then, he was almost living the living of many he
was knowing then in his daily living, he certainly was almost then
completely liking being one going on being living. He talked a good
deal all his living as I was saying, he certainly a good deal did
not talk in all of his living, he listened some that is certain, he
talked some that is quite certain. He was one going on being in
living until he was at the end of the beginning of his middle
living and then he came to dying and then he was a dead one. In his
beginning living he was doing different things in his daily living,
this is to be now a description of living and of being in him.</p>

<p>One who knew David Hersland a long time in living was one
certainly living so that that one later in the living of that one
should certainly be one certainly not marrying a certain one. This
one might be loving that one, this one certainly was one living in
being living so that certainly that one to that one was one
certainly one never going to be marrying a certain one. Very many
knowing of this one, knowing this one a little would be saying that
this one was certainly sometimes going to be marrying a certain
one, not any one really knowing this one ever did any thinking
about this one going to be marrying that certain one, it was not a
thing to any one really knowing this one needing any thinking, it
was a thing that everybody knowing this one took as being of course
certain that this one would never be marrying that certain one.
Certainly everybody knowing very well the two of them were certain
that each of them were certain that that one never would be
marrying the other one. This one then married that certain one. Now
did this one have it that this one had not been knowing that every
one knowing this one very well was very simply certain that that
one would not be marrying a certain one or did this one have it
that this one was knowing this thing. Did this one have it that
once this one was knowing that thing and when this one came to be
one going to be marrying the certain one was not knowing this
thing. It certainly was to every one a simply inevitable thing that
this one would never be marrying a certain one. This one certainly
married that certain one. Every one really knowing this one never
came to knowing whether it had perhaps not ever been an inevitable
thing to that one that that one was not ever to be marrying that
certain one, not any one knowing this one ever came to know that
for this one it had been an inevitable thing that this one was not
ever to marry that certain one. To some knowing this thing it was a
puzzling thing and then it was to them that that one had married
that certain one and they knew them very well in their married
living. To some it was not a puzzling thing, they were not ever
thinking then when this one had been once married to that certain
one, they were not ever thinking about that one ever having been
going to be married to any one, to that certain one. To some it was
not a puzzling thing, it was a thing like something having been a
lost thing that never had been a thing any one had found before it
was lost. To some it was a thing that was not puzzling at all and
yet was different from what every one knowing anything was certain
could be happening, to some of such of them it was not at all a
puzzling thing. To some it was a thing that was like being a dead
one and certainly perhaps one being a dead one is not knowing it
then that that one is then being a dead one. To mostly not any one
was it at all exasperating, to mostly not any one was it really
exciting that that one had married a certain one and it had been to
every one knowing them a simply inevitable thing that that one
would not ever marry that certain one. So then that one had married
that certain one. Certainly every one knowing either one of them
very well had been simply certain like being certain of being one
being living that that one would not ever be marrying that certain
one. In a way, as I say, when that one then married that certain
one, it was not to very many of those having been simply certain
exciting, it was to very many of those having been simply certain
that this one would not marry that certain one not puzzling, it was
not to any one knowing them and having been simply certain at all
exasperating, it was not to all of them who had been completely
certain that that one would not ever marry that certain one when
that one married that certain one really exciting. And this was a
strange thing to be in David Hersland in being one being living.
This one as I am saying was one knowing David Hersland very well in
living. This one was one David Hersland knew very well almost all
his living. David Hersland was one having it as I was saying that
he was one wanting to be having it that he was completely needing
to be certain every minute in being living of having it that he was
realising that there was being a reason in being living so that he
could be one going on being living. He was one as I was saying
certainly needing every moment in his living to be one needing to
be reasoning to be realising that he was one to be one going on
being living. As I was saying he knew very well the one that came
to marry a certain one when he had been completely quite certain
that that one would not be marrying a certain one and it was not to
him completely exciting, it was not to him completely interesting
that this one had then married that certain one and that not he,
not any one that he knew then knew then whether that one had or had
not ever been completely certain that one could certainly not ever
marry that certain one. As I was saying David Hersland knew this
one very well, this one knew David Hersland very well, as I was
saying this thing was not then when it had suddenly happened, and
it happened certainly quite suddenly, it was not then to David
Hersland completely interesting, it was not then to David Hersland
completely exciting, this that it was not then or ever later than
then a completely interesting thing a completely exciting thing to
David Hersland is certainly a curious thing. David Hersland is one
I am now beginning describing. I certainly will tell a good deal of
everything I know about living and about being in him.</p>

<p>It is a nice thing to some that some one is certain that every
one would be thankful perhaps to him certainly at any rate
thankful, just thankful if they could be having it completely shown
to them what way they could be living so that living could have a
meaning to every one when every one had come to be thankful for
understanding living having such a meaning. There are very many
certainly being certain that everybody could be thankful if
everybody could be thankful. Some are quite certain that anybody
could be thankful if everybody could be thankful. Some are quite
certain that some one is really certain that every one could be
thankful if every one were really coming to be ones being thankful
ones. Very many then are quite certain that each one could be
wanting what every one could be wanting. Very many then are quite
certain that certainly every one could be wanting what each one
could be wanting. Mostly a good many are saying that some one who
is certain that every one could be wanting what every one could be
wanting is a very nice one. Each one is certainly being living,
each is one certainly being sometime a dead one. Does each one
being one being living need it to be perhaps liking that thing.
Does each one being living need it to be sometime wanting
something. Does each one coming to be a dead one, need it to have
it that he could be wanting what every one else perhaps could be,
could have been wanting. Does each one who has come to be a dead
one know then that he is a dead one. Does any one having come to be
a dead one know then that he is a really truly dead one. Certainly
a very great many are very certain that they are thinking that each
one is or could be wanting a certain kind of meaning in being one
being living, and then some one is not then being such a one and is
it then really completely puzzling, completely exciting, completely
interesting to any one that some one could not be wanting what
every one certainly is realising everybody could be wanting. I will
certainly not commence telling a good deal, that is, as much of a
good deal as I will be telling of being being in very many being
living. Many men and many women are being living, have been, will
be being living. I will now tell a good deal that is I will tell
all I will be telling about being being in men and women, in some
men and in some women. I shall now just be repeating that I
certainly am knowing there is being being in men and in women being
living, I will just repeat this now again and again and again and
then I can be certain enough of this thing to be leaving it without
being then looking at it and so then I can leave it and it will be
then keeping going and I can go ahead and be fooling and mixing up
everything in telling about being being in David Hersland and this
I hope sometime to be doing but not this evening, no certainly not
this evening, no certainly not now when I am looking to be just
repeating that being is in men and in women who are being
living.</p>

<p>Some are not very much interested in their being living in
living and they are a little interested in this thing. They are
going on being in living and they are not very much interested in
their being living in living and they are a little interested in
this thing in being one being living in living. Some of these are
then going on and going on being living in living and they are not
then very much interested in this thing and they are a little
interested in this thing. Some of such of them are going on being
in living and they keep on going on being in living and they are
not much interested in this and they are a little interested in
this thing. Quite a number of such of them are keeping on being
ones being living and they are not some of such of them ever very
much interested in this thing and they are a little interested in
this thing. Some of them are going on being living and they are
certainly not ever very much interested in this thing and they
certainly are a little interested in this thing.</p>

<p>David Hersland was one being living in living and certainly he
was one almost completely interested in being one being in living,
this is to be now certainly some description of this in him, this
is certainly to be now some description of being of not being very
much, of being a little, of being almost completely interested in
being one being in living. David Hersland was one being living to
the ending of his beginning being in middle living I am realising
that being is in men and in women being living, I can now be not
repeating this thing, I can now go on and go on and go on a little
more then and a good deal more then about David Hersland and about
his knowing some and about some knowing him.</p>

<p>David was a young one and knowing a good many then and some were
knowing him then. He was doing things then every day with himself,
with some one else, with other ones, and he was then being one
being a young one in being living. He was knowing then quite a
number of ones being living and some were knowing him then. He
liked it then being living, he always almost completely liked it
being living. He was then a young one being living and he knew some
then who were being living then and some knew him then. He was then
a quite young one.</p>

<p>Some are wondering about other ones about how they have enough
money to support them. It is a very mysterious thing sometimes to
some one about living coming to be paid for by some one. Some find
it quite a strange thing that some one was not doing anything and
that one is doing something and that one is knowing then how to do
that thing and some one is paying that one for doing that thing. To
some it is an astonishing thing that any one can be doing anything
so that some one can be paying them something for that thing. To
some it is not at all an astonishing thing that some one is knowing
how to be doing something so that some one is paying that one
something for doing that thing. To some as I say being one being
earning a living is a thing that is astonishing, to some being one
earning a living is a thing that is not at all in any kind of a way
astonishing. Those living in Gossols as I was saying in the part of
Gossols where the Herslands were living were ones living in small
houses as I was saying and some knew about how some made money to
be ones going on being living and some did not know this about some
of them how they were earning money so as to be ones able to be
going on being living. Some as I was saying were doing something
and anybody looking could be seeing them doing that thing and could
be seeing some one, some paying them to be doing that thing. Some
were not doing things that every one could be seeing them be doing.
Some were not doing anything that any one could see would be a
thing any one would be paying them anything to be doing. In a way
certainly some of them were not making money so as to be ones going
on being going on being living. Certainly some of them were not to
themselves to any one making money enough for any such a thing, for
any going on being living. Sometimes it was a puzzling thing about
some family living in some house then in that part of Gossols where
the Herslands were living about who it was that was in that house
living. Sometimes not any one that said anything really knew
anything about that thing. It was confusing and then mostly not any
one was really confused by that thing.</p>

<p>David Hersland all his living knew quite a number who were being
living then and quite a number who were being living knew him then.
He knew quite a number who were being living, he knew quite a
number when he was a young one, some knew him then, as I was saying
all his living he knew quite a number who were living while he was
one being living. Certainly some he was knowing were doing
something and some one was paying them something for that thing,
certainly some he was knowing were doing something and not any one
really was paying them anything for the thing they were doing,
certainly there were some he was knowing who were really not doing
very much any one thing and some of these had money then and some
of these did not have money then. Mostly all his living David
Hersland would have liked it very well to be knowing it about each
one what they were doing, what they had been doing, what they would
be doing to be earning money to be ones going on being living. This
was all his living a thing that was quite interesting to David
Hersland knowing this thing about each one he was ever knowing.
Sometimes about some one such a thing was very confusing sometimes
about some one he was knowing in living, sometimes he was confused
about this thing about some one, sometimes he was not confused
about this thing about that one, sometimes he was not listening
enough to some one to be really understanding this thing about some
one how that one was having money enough to be one going on being
living, sometimes he was listening very much to some one and he
listened to every one knowing that one and it was not confusing
about that one but he never could find out about that one about the
money that one had to be one going on being living. Always all his
living this was to him an interesting enough thing about each one
he was knowing what money they had and how they had that money for
daily living. As I was saying all his living he knew a good many
who were then living, as I was saying all his living a good many
knew him. As I was saying when he was in his beginning living he
knew a good many who were living then, as I was saying when he was
in his beginning living a good number knew him then. He was then as
I was saying living in the part of Gossols where the Hersland
family were living then and the Hersland family were living on a
ten acre place then and there were very many living in that part of
Gossols where the Herslands were living then and these were living
in small houses and as I was saying David Hersland knew them, he
knew a number of people then, some knew him then, I will be telling
something now about being in him and knowing other ones being in
him and other ones knowing him being in him. I will tell now about
his being one beginning being living.</p>

<p>Mostly every one at different parts in their living when they
are very little ones when they are a little bigger ones when they
are not any longer very young ones when they are quite not very
young ones when they are ones beginning being in their middle
living when they are ones being in their middle living when they
are ones ending being in their middle living when they are ones
coming to be growing old ones when they are ones come to be old
ones have a feeling about some one having angry feeling in them
have some feeling about any one that has for them angry feeling in
them. Mostly every one has some feeling about angry feeling being
in some one, about angry feeling being inside them, about angry
feeling in any one. Some have all their living about the same
feeling about some one having angry feeling about having angry
feeling themselves inside them about any one having angry feeling
in them. Some have a very different feeling about angry feeling
being in some one about angry feeling being in any one about angry
feeling being inside in them in different parts of their being in
living. Some are certainly changing in their feeling about angry
feeling being in any one about angry feeling being in some one
about angry feeling being inside in them as they are going on being
living. I am telling now about angry feeling being in some one
about angry feeling being in any one about angry feeling in one
inside that one to that one and I am saying that some are changing
while they are being living about their feeling about each one of
these ways of being and some are not changing in their way of
feeling about angry feeling being in any one in some one in some in
themselves inside them, and some are changing very much in their
living about angry feeling and some are not changing very much in
their feeling about angry feeling and some are changing one way and
some are changing another way. Each one of the Hersland family
could have angry feeling in them. Some of them were changing in
being living about angry feeling being inside them, about angry
feeling being in some other one, about angry feeling being in some
one, about angry feeling being in some, and some of these were not
changing much in their living in their being living in feeling
about angry feeling being inside them, being in some one, being in
any one, being in some. They were all of them changing somewhat in
their living in their feeling about angry feeling, some of them
were changing very much while they went on being living about angry
feeling being in them being in some other one being in any one.
Certainly some of them were changing very much in their feeling
about angry feeling being in them, being in some, being in any one,
some of them were certainly hardly at all changing, not very much
changing in their feeling about angry feeling all the time that
they were living.</p>

<p>There were very many living there in that part of Gossols where
the Herslands were living and some knew them and some knew some of
them and some knew of some one of them how that one had angry
feeling in that one and some of the Hersland family knew of some of
those who lived near them how they had angry feeling in them. Some
of these who knew the Hersland family then, knew some of the
Hersland family then did not know how those of the Hersland family
they knew then had angry feeling in them. Each one of the Hersland
family knew some of those living near them without knowing of them
how they had angry feeling in them.</p>

<p>Each one of the Hersland family could have some angry feeling
sometimes in them. Each one of the Hersland family did have
sometimes some angry feeling in them. David Hersland knew something
about angry feeling in him and in each one of the Hersland family
who could have angry feeling, that is to say he knew something
about angry feeling being in each one of the family of the then
Hersland family. Mostly each one of the Hersland family knew
something about the way each one, each other one, all of them could
have angry feeling in them. As I was saying some of them changed in
their living about angry feeling being inside them, inside any
other one, inside all of them and some as I was saying some of them
did not change very much in their feeling about angry feeling being
in any one of them, in all of them, in them.</p>

<p>Mostly every one then is having some feeling about angry feeling
all their living. This can be then certainly some description of
angry feeling being in men and in women in all parts of their being
living and in all kinds in men and in women. Mostly every one then
certainly has some feeling of being sometime an angry one, has some
feeling of some other one being sometime an angry one. Mostly a
good many have some feeling about angry feeling being existing in
themselves and in other ones. Some are liking angry feeling being
in them, some are certainly not liking angry feeling being in them
or having been in them, some are certainly liking angry feeling
having been in them. But this is not now to me an important thing,
the liking angry feeling inside in one, the not liking angry
feeling inside in one. It is now an important thing to me that
certainly mostly every one has angry feeling in him sometime and
mostly every one has some feeling about angry feeling being in him,
being in some other one, being in any one and that some are
changing very much in their feeling about angry feeling in
themselves, in some other one in any other one while they are being
in living and some are hardly at all changing in their feeling
about angry feeling in themselves in any one while they are being
living. Some knowing some in that part of Gossols where the
Herslands were living knew about the way angry feeling was in them
when it was in them and some did not know this thing about some
they were knowing then. Each one certainly in the Hersland family
then could have angry feeling sometimes in them. Each one of them
did have sometimes angry feeling in them, some knowing some of them
knew of them how they had angry feeling, some knowing some of them
did not know how they had angry feeling in them. Some knowing some
of them knew how one of them had angry feeling but not how the
others of them had angry feeling. Some of the Hersland family were
certainly changing very much in their feeling about angry feeling
being in any one from the beginning to the ending of their being
living, some of them certainly changed some in their feeling about
angry feeling being in any one from the beginning of their being
living to their ending, each one of them certainly changed some
about this, that is a natural enough thing when any one is passing
from being a very little young one through to a bigger older one,
to a middle living one to an older one, to an old one to a very old
one. David Hersland in his being living certainly was changing very
much in his feeling about angry feeling in any one. That is
certainly a very natural thing. Each one of the Hersland family
could have angry feeling in them. Some knew how each one of them
had angry feeling in them, some did not know how each one of them
had angry feeling in them, some did not know and then they did know
about angry feeling in them in each one of them. Each one of the
Hersland family certainly had their own way of having angry feeling
in them. Certainly each one knew something about how each one of
them had angry feeling in them when they had it in them. The
Hersland family had not very much angry feeling in them for any one
to be noticing, they had some angry feeling in them sometimes each
one of them for some one to be noticing. Some had angry feeling
more often in them than others of them. David Hersland had angry
feeling in him once in a while not very often, Alfred Hersland had
angry feeling in him once in a while not so very often, this is to
be now a history of David Hersland.</p>

<p>Some are wanting to be needing in their living to have some one
have some angry feeling. Some are needing it in their living to
have some one have some angry feeling. Some are needing angry
feeling being existing, some are wanting to be needing angry
feeling being existing. David Hersland was one sometime in his
living wanting to be needing having angry feeling being existing he
was sometime in his living needing angry feeling to be existing, he
was sometime in his living not wanting any angry feeling to be
existing, he was sometime in his living completely wanting not
angry feeling being existing, he was sometime in his living having
an angry feeling about angry feeling being existing, he was
sometime in his living completely needing having angry feeling
really being existing, he was one wanting sometime in his living
that not any angry feeling should be existing.</p>

<p>Some are needing angry feeling being in some one existing, some
are needing angry feeling being inside them being existing, some
are wanting to be needing angry feeling being in some existing,
some are wanting to be needing angry feeling being sometimes
existing inside them, some are wanting to be needing that angry
feeling be not existing in any one, not in themselves inside them,
some are having angry feeling and they are never certain whether
they are needing whether they are not needing that thing, some are
having some one having angry feeling and they are not certain
whether they are liking whether they are not liking that thing,
some are having angry feeling inside them and they are not certain
whether they are liking whether they are not liking that thing,
some are having some having angry feeling some one having angry
feeling and they are not certain whether they are needing or
whether they are not needing that thing. Certainly very many are
sometimes having angry feeling in them, certainly very many are
having others having angry feeling for them, certainly very many
are having some one having angry feeling for them, certainly very
many are having some often having angry feeling against them,
certainly very many have some to have angry feeling about them,
certainly a very great many have some one having angry feeling
about them, have some one having angry feeling against them, have
some one having angry feeling with them.</p>

<p>To some it is extraordinary that any one having angry feeling
can then come to be convincing. Some having angry feeling come then
to be convincing about something to some one. Some came to be very
convincing to David Hersland when they had angry feeling in them
sometime in his living. Some did not come to be convincing to him
about anything when they had angry feeling in them, sometimes in
his living not any one having angry feeling was convincing to him
about anything, sometimes in his living almost any one having angry
feeling in them were convincing to him then about something they
were saying then, certainly for sometime while he was being living
some certainly some one was mostly always convincing about
something when those, when that one, were angry ones, was an angry
one. Certainly very many living are changing in their feeling about
any one being an angry one about some one being an angry one, about
they themselves that one being an angry one. Some certainly are
very different in different times in their living in their feeling
about angry feeling being existing. Some are not changing very much
in the time of their being living in their feeling about angry
feeling being existing. Each one certainly has in them their own
way of feeling, of changing in feeling about angry feeling being
existing. Very many come to know in being living quite a number who
are then existing. Some come to know of some they are then knowing
how they have angry feeling in them, some do not come to know of
very many they are knowing how they have angry feeling in them,
some come to know of quite a number they are knowing how they have
angry feeling in them. Alfred Hersland came to know of some he was
knowing how they come to have angry feeling in them. David Hersland
came in some way to know of quite a number he came to know in being
living how they came to have angry feeling, what they do when they
have angry feeling. As I was saying sometimes when he was living he
was one wanting to be needing that not any one was having angry
feeling, as I was saying sometimes in his living he was needing, to
be one going on being living with any meaning in that thing, that
not any one having angry feeling in being in living that not any
angry feeling was being existing, sometimes in his being living he
was wanting to be needing that there was angry feeling quite a good
deal of angry feeling existing, sometimes while he was living as I
was saying of him he was quite needing that angry feeling was
really existing, as I was saying he was in his living one changing
about ones having angry feeling being ones being convincing about
something. This is to be in a way a history of him and of every one
that he ever knew and of every one who ever came to know him or of
him.</p>

<p>Some have different feeling about each one having angry feeling.
Some when they are young ones have different feeling about each one
having angry feeling. Some have a feeling about one having angry
feeling and that one has angry feeling and that one can do
anything, having angry feeling, and mostly that one does not do
anything when that one is having that angry feeling and some one
being then a young one has it in that one then to be completely
certain that that one is wanting to be needing that not angry
feeling be existing, that one then the one being then a young one
has it in that one that any one having angry feeling is one not
convincing any one of anything certainly not convincing any one of
anything certainly quite completely not convincing any one of
anything, angry feeling then is to that one when one that one is
knowing who could be doing anything in having angry feeling and
mostly is not doing anything in having angry feeling is having
angry feeling, angry feeling is to that one when one that one is
knowing is having angry feeling angry feeling then is to that one
something that that one is certainly wanting to be needing to have
not ever existing, certainly to that one then not any one having
angry feeling could be convincing about anything, that is one way
of having feeling in some one, in some, in some one when that one
is a young one, in some when they are young ones, in some when they
are older ones, in some only when they are young ones, in some only
when a certain one is having angry feeling, in some when any one is
having angry feeling, in some when every one is having angry
feeling, about angry feeling being existing. So then certainly some
when they are young ones are feeling about some one, one who could
be doing anything when having angry feeling and who sometimes is
doing something when having angry feeling and sometimes is not
doing anything when having angry feeling, are feeling about angry
feeling when angry feeling is in that some one that they are
certainly wanting to be needing that not any angry feeling ever is
existing, that certainly not any one could be convincing to any
one, who was one ever having, ever going to be having angry
feeling. As I am saying some have such feeling about angry feeling
when they are young ones when angry feeling is in a certain one.
Some as I was saying are having such feeling when they are older
ones when angry feeling is in a certain one. Some have such feeling
as I am saying about angry feeling when they are young ones when
angry feeling is in some, some as I am saying have such feeling
about angry feeling when they are older ones when angry feeling is
in some, some as I am saying when they are young have such feeling
when angry feeling is in any one, some when they are older as I am
now saying have such feeling about angry feeling when angry feeling
is in any one, some as I am now saying when they are older ones
have such feeling about angry feeling being existing, some are ones
having such feeling about angry feeling being existing when they
are young ones in being living. Alfred Hersland had such feeling
about some one having angry feeling when he Alfred was not a young
one not yet an older one, he had not such a feeling about any one
having angry feeling when he was a young one, when he was an older
one. David Hersland had such feeling about some one having angry
feeling when he was a young one, he had it then not so much in him
when he was beginning being an older one he had it again in him
when he was going on a little being an older one he had it in him
then some about every one, about any one having angry feeling, he
did not have it in him not really in him not at all wanting having
it in him at all when he was going on still more being an older
one, he had it a little in him then, he was not wanting it at all
then to be in him for him to be one going on being living, he
certainly did not want it then to be in him he did not have it then
in him for his living, for his being one being living. Some he knew
when he was living were ones having such feeling when he was
knowing them, some he knew in his living had been sometime having
such feeling about angry feeling, some whom he knew in his living
would certainly be having such feeling about angry feeling. Some
who knew him when he was being living when he was not having it to
be needing such feeling thought that he was having such feeling
about angry feeling, some thought then he was wanting to be needing
such feeling about angry feeling when he was not wanting to be
needing such feeling. He knew very many while he was one being
living. I am saying again, quite a number knew him while he was
being living. I am saying again, some felt one way of feeling about
angry feeling in him, other ones felt other ways of feeling about
angry feeling in him. I will slowly be describing every one feeling
about&mdash;angry feeling in him, about his feeling about angry
feeling in him, I will be describing his feeling about angry
feeling being in him, about angry feeling being in any one, about
angry feeling being in some. He certainly did very often a good
deal of talking a good deal of listening about angry feeling being
existing. Angry feeling was very often quite interesting to
him.</p>

<p>In some one, in some to some, in some to some one sometime,
sometimes, to some sometimes, all the time of their being living,
to some one sometimes all the time of that one being living there
is not anything to convince of anything. Sometimes such a one who
not in any way has power of doing anything when that one is being
an angry one, who certainly is not convincing about anything in
being one being living, that is to some one, has it to have it to
give that one that some one angry feeling of being one not then
able to be doing anything to be expressing any angry feeling to be
completely then filled up with furious angry feeling to be then
only completely doing smiling. Some then being in family living
with some other one, some then are existing in living and then some
one has it to have because of that one being something, doing
something, completely furious angry feeling, completely not doing
anything to be to them telling anything to any one that that one is
having completely furious angry feeling, completely smiling and the
one that is making the one have this in that one this completely
furious feeling, this completely not doing anything to be showing
any one that that one is having completely furious angry feeling,
this completely smiling is one not having it to be able to be doing
anything in any way to that one that is then having completely
furious feeling not convincing that one, not pleasing that one, not
injuring that one, not in any way to that one or in any way for
that one meaning anything to any one in being one being living.
Certainly this can be in some being living, this way of being one
having angry feeling, this certainly when some are coming to the
ending of the middle of their young living comes to be in them very
often. Some have it in them some all of their living, some have it
in them some in the beginning of the middle of their young living,
some of them have it in them some at the ending of their young
living, some have it in them some to the beginning of the middle of
their middle living, some but mostly not so very many have it in
them some all their living, quite a number certainly do have it
some all their living this then this way of having angry feeling
come to be in them, this way of having angry feeling in them, quite
a number certainly of women, quite a number certainly of men.
Certainly David Hersland could have it in him to have this in him
when he was in the beginning of the middle of his being in his
young living, he could have it in him until almost the ending of
his young living, it is certainly not completely certain that he
could not have it in him any time in his being one being living
which was to the ending of the beginning of his middle living. He
was not knowing much about this being in any one when he was one
being in young living any such a way of having angry feeling, he
could come to be certain in him that such a way of having angry
feeling is not at all uncommon. He certainly sometime came to be
certain of this thing that very many have it, had it, could have it
in them to have this way of having angry feeling come to be in
them, be in them. Very many do not come to have angry feeling come
to be in them, be in them, very many do have have it sometime to
have angry feeling coming to be in this way in them, be in this way
in them, very many do not, very many certainly very many sometime
do come to have angry feeling come in this way to be in them, do
have angry feeling in some such way in them then.</p>

<p>Certainly each one has their own way of having angry feeling in
them, certainly some having angry feeling come to be in them from
some one not having it to have it from being one being in living
having any way of being one acting to affect them, to convince them
have it then to have angry feeling in the way their kind of them,
in the way that one has angry feeling. Each one certainly has angry
feeling the way it is natural for that one to have angry feeling in
that one, that is mostly every one. Some do not have it completely
to have angry feeling in them the way it is natural to have angry
feeling in them but this is another thing, certainly mostly every
one has more or less completely in them when they have angry
feeling in them their way of having angry feeling in them. I have
just now been telling about David Hersland, I have been just
telling about David Hersland and about Alfred Hersland and I will
tell more about angry feeling being in women being in men being
sometime in every one having ever angry feeling in them, about any
one having angry feeling, about some having angry feeling.</p>

<p>Angry feeling again and again is in each one being in any family
living, being in any living, this is pretty nearly certain. Angry
feeling again and again is in one being one being in a family,
being in any living. Angry feeling again and again is in one in
different ways in one in one being in any living, being in any
family living. Mostly each one being in any family living, mostly
each one being in any living is having to have in that one again
and again angry feeling from each one that one is knowing in the
family living, from each one that one is knowing in any living.
Perhaps it is certain that not every one is having angry feeling in
that one from each one they are knowing in any living. Perhaps it
is certain that each one in any family living is having again and
again the same kind of angry feeling from each one being with that
one in that family living. Perhaps this is really certain. Perhaps
it is certain that each one has from each one being, from each one
being doing something the same kind of angry feeling again and
again. Perhaps it is really certain that almost every one has a
different way of having angry feeling with each one that one is
knowing and perhaps it is quite certain that mostly every one has
that way of feeling angry feeling from some one being in living,
from some one doing something, again and again. It is perhaps
almost completely certain that each one being in some family living
is having some angry feeling about each one in that family living
and about each one in a certain kind of way of having angry feeling
and in each way of having some angry feeling having it again and
again. Perhaps not every one is having a different way of having
angry feeling with different ones in their living, perhaps some are
not having angry feeling in some way again and again.</p>

<p>Some are having pretty nearly completely angry feeling again and
again, some are not having completely angry feeling again and
again, some are not having anywhere nearly completely angry feeling
again and again, some are having quite completely angry feeling
again and again.</p>

<p>Some are having angry feeling, mostly every one is having some
angry feeling. Some are knowing something about this thing, some
are not knowing anything about this thing, some are knowing very
much about this thing, some are remembering what they have been
knowing about this thing, some are needing to be forgetting
everything they were ever knowing about this thing, some are
wanting to be needing to be remembering what they could be knowing
about this thing.</p>

<p>Each one certainly has their own way of feeling about angry
feeling being in them, having been in them, going to be in them.
Each one has their own way of knowing has their own way of not
knowing about angry feeling having been, going to be, being in
them. Each one has it to be remembering about angry feeling, each
one has it to be not remembering about angry feeling, in their own
way each one of them. Certainly each one has their own way of
remembering and forgetting angry feeling being, having been, going
to be in them, each one certainly has their own way of remembering
and forgetting knowing about angry feeling having been, being,
going to be in them.</p>

<p>Each one certainly has their own way of feeling, of thinking, of
remembering, of forgetting about angry feeling having been, being
in them, going to be being in them. Mostly each is one in some way
liking in some way not liking having angry feeling having been,
being, going to be being in them. Some are almost not at all liking
having, having had, going to be having angry feeling, some are
almost completely liking having angry feeling, some are almost
completely liking having had angry feeling, some are almost
completely liking going to be having angry feeling. Some are
certainly liking some ways of having angry feeling in them some are
certainly not liking other ways of having angry feeling in them,
some other way of having angry feeling. Some are liking that some
are knowing they are having angry feeling. Some are sometimes
liking that some are knowing they are having angry feeling. Each
one has angry feeling in different parts in that, one being one
being living, each one has angry feeling from some one from some
that one is knowing in being living. Some are almost quite certain
that not any one is knowing they are having angry feeling when they
themselves are knowing they are having angry feeling. Some are
quite certain that very many are quite certain that they are having
angry feeling and they themselves are quite certain that they are
not having not at all having angry feeling, sometimes then these
have been having angry feeling, sometimes then these have not been
having having angry feeling, sometime others have not been thinking
these were having angry feeling when these were thinking those
others were thinking that thing, sometimes others have been
thinking these were having angry feeling when these were thinking
those others were thinking that thing.</p>

<p>Some then have angry feeling about each one they are knowing and
are having it again and again. Some are certainly having it again
and again from each one being with them in them in family living
and for each one are having a certain kind of angry feeling and are
certainly having it again and again.</p>

<p>Each one has then the angry feeling in them of their kind of
them, of their being one being living. There are different ways of
having angry feeling in different ones who are having it that one
being with them in family living, being with them in some living is
one not having it to have it that that one can be doing anything to
the one then having angry feeling but is one doing something, being
something that is certainly the reason why the one having angry
feeling just then is just then having angry feeling in that one.
Certainly there are in this way of having it happen that angry
feeling is in some, different ways of having angry feeling in the
one having then angry feeling. As I am saying some certainly are
then needing to be wanting not to have it that they themselves that
any one is certain that they are having then angry feeling.
Certainly some are needing when such angry feeling is in them are
needing it that not any other one is knowing that they are having
angry feeling inside them. Some are certainly then when they are
having such angry feeling in them are certainly then needing to be
certain themselves then inside them that they are then having angry
feeling in them. Some are needing certainly needing when they are
having such angry feeling in them are certainly needing that some
one some other one is knowing it then that they are having then
such angry feeling in them. Some are ones when they are having such
angry feeling in them are ones wanting to be needing that some
other one is knowing it of them that they are then having such
angry feeling in them. Some are ones wanting to be needing it that
not any one ever can be knowing that they are ones having such
angry feeling in them. Some having such angry feeling are ones
wanting to be needing it that they are ones not then knowing it
that they have inside them any such angry feeling. Some having such
angry feeling in them are ones needing to be wanting then and
always in them about such angry feeling in them that they are not
knowing it inside them that they are having in them such a way of
having in them angry feeling. Then there are ones certainly not
ever being ones ever remembering having been having in any such a
way angry feeling. Then there are some certainly needing that they
are wanting that not any one should ever be remembering anything
about any one ever having any such a way of having angry feeling.
Then there are some certainly very well remembering that they are
ones having been having such an angry feeling and some of these
then are ones really needing that not any one, that they not
themselves inside them are ever mentioning that they have been
having any such a way of having angry feeling in them and there are
some of this kind of them that can never be listening when any one
is mentioning such a way of having angry feeling, and there are
some of such of them who are certainly not hearing when any one in
any way is mentioning such a way of having angry feeling, of such
angry feeling having been sometime in that one. Certainly to very
many having such angry feeling in them it is a thing they are
mostly not at all liking, certainly some, quite some having it in
them to have such angry feeling in them are in some ways needing it
to be wanting it to be in them, some are in some way coming to be
liking it to be inside in them such a way of having angry feeling
in them, some are in some way coming to be liking it inside in them
such a way of having angry feeling in them, some are almost
completely liking it having such a way of having angry feeling in
them some of those having angry feeling in them from some one not
being one in any way doing anything to that one in any way able to
be doing anything to that one but being one being in the family
living, being one being in some living of that one and being one
being then in being living, being one doing something in being
living. Certainly Alfred Hersland was one being in the family
living of David Hersland. Certainly there were very many in the
living of David Hersland sometimes in David Hersland being one
being living. Certainly some of these were sometimes ones making it
that David Hersland had in him angry feeling and these then were
then ones not being ones able in any way to be doing anything in
the living of David Hersland he being one being then being living.
Alfred Hersland was one certainly one when David Hersland was in
the beginning of the middle of his young living, one not doing
anything in the living, in the living David Hersland was then
living, certainly David Hersland had then angry feeling from Alfred
Hersland being one then being living being one then doing
something. Certainly David Hersland had sometimes angry feeling in
him and this was in him and it was in him in the middle of his
young living and this was in him because Alfred Hersland was being
then one doing some particular thing. Certainly then sometimes
Alfred Hersland was knowing that David Hersland was having angry
feeling in him. Certainly sometimes when David Hersland was having
angry feeling in him in this way in him Alfred Hersland was not at
all then knowing this thing. Sometimes Martha Hersland would be
knowing this thing that David Hersland was having angry feeling in
him in this way in him, mostly she was not knowing this thing,
David Hersland certainly always knew it in him when he was having
angry feeling in him in such a way inside him, sometimes later he
could be explaining such angry feeling when he was explaining
something and Martha was listening, sometimes he could come to be
almost thinking it a funny thing to have been having any such angry
feeling he could be thinking it to be a funny thing to himself
inside him he could be sometime almost mentioning this thing to
some one that it was a funny thing to have been having angry
feeling in any such way inside him, certainly he sometime sometimes
could be mentioning this thing that he was thinking it to be a
funny thing that he had angry feeling in any way inside him, he
certainly sometime could come to be completely thinking that it was
a very peculiar thing to have been having such a way of having
angry feeling, to have been having sometimes inside him such a way
of having angry feeling, he could be completely explaining to
himself and sometime to some one and sometime to some that it was a
peculiar thing to have been having such angry feeling inside him.
He certainly could be sometime completely explaining such angry
feeling, he certainly could be explaining completely explaining
that this was a peculiar thing that this was quite a funny thing
having been having such angry feeling in him, he could certainly
sometime he completely certain about the explanation of this thing,
about this being a funny thing, to himself and to some. He was one
as I was saying having had quite reasonably often such a way of
having angry feeling in him when he was in the middle of his young
living. He was one in a way having such a way of having angry
feeling in him when he was one being in the beginning of his middle
living. He was quite certainly not one having any such angry
feeling in him in any such a way when he was in the ending of his
young living. This is quite clear then, he had certainly a good
deal of such angry feeling in him and quite often in the middle of
his young living, not any in the ending of his young living,
certainly some and fairly often in the beginning of his middle
living, more or less then to the ending of his living which was in
the ending of the beginning of his middle living. He had angry
feeling in such a way in him pretty much the same way in him when
he had it in him and yet there were differences and sometime these
differences will be coming to be showing themselves in his coming
to be having it that every one is knowing other things in him that
every one knowing him could be certainly knowing.</p>

<p>There are different ways of having angry feeling when some one
is teaching some one something. There are different ways of having
angry feeling when some one is trying to teach some one something.
There are different ways of having angry feeling inside each one
who is having angry feeling with some one teaching that one.</p>

<p>One is being one some one is teaching and that one can be
certain that that is not at all a good way for that one to be
teaching that one that thing. One is being one some one is teaching
and the one some one is teaching can be quite completely certain
inside that one that the one that is teaching that one is one not
knowing anything about that thing. That one the one some one is
teaching something can be certain of this thing that the one
teaching that one is not teaching that one in the right way of
teaching that thing, can be certain of this thing when that one is
quite in the beginning of the middle of young living.</p>

<p>Some one is one to whom some one is regularly teaching
something. Someone is one whom some one is teaching. Some one is
one whom someone is regularly teaching something and that is in the
middle of the young living of that one, is quite in the beginning
of the middle of the young living in that one and that one is then
one in the middle of the middle of the young living of that one and
is then in the ending of the middle of the young living in that one
and is always quite certain that the one regularly teaching that
one something is one not knowing anything about, the thing that one
is teaching. Certainly David Hersland was one not admiring any
teacher any one teacher teaching him in any fashion until David
Hersland was one at the ending of young living at the beginning of
the beginning of his being in middle living and then he certainly
was admiring some who were teaching, regularly then teaching him
then something.</p>

<p>Some can be quite, certain when they are in the beginning of the
middle of their young living can be quite certain that not any one
teaching them something is one knowing anything about that thing.
Some of such of them are not in any way pleasant ones for those
then teaching them to be teaching. Some of such of them are not at
all unpleasant ones for those then teaching them to be teaching.
David Hersland as I was saying was of such of them that I have been
describing and certainly he was not then to every one teaching him
an unpleasant one, he was certainly then not to every one then
teaching him something a pleasant one.</p>

<p>Certainly mostly every one in being one being in young living is
one being one some one is regularly teaching something. Certainly
some are then quite certain to themselves inside them that not any
one teaching them then something is knowing anything really about
the thing they are then teaching. Certainly some are certain of
this thing to mostly every one knowing them then. Certainly some
are certain of this thing to some one knowing them then. Certainly
some are needing to be wanting to be certain of this thing.
Certainly some are wanting to be needing to be certain of this
thing. Certainly very many are pretty nearly completely certain of
this thing. Some are certainly mostly always completely certain of
this thing then when they are in any part of the middle of their
being in young living. David Hersland was, certainly, was one of
such of them. He was one feeling in such fashion. He was not then
admiring any one of those who was then teaching him something, who
was then being a teacher for him in a regular fashion.</p>

<p>Certainly some do not at all think about this thing whether the
one teaching them anything is knowing anything about that thing.
Certainly not, they certainly are not at all thinking about this
thing in any one regularly teaching them anything, very many who
are being taught something, very many who have been taught
something. When I asked something they did not answer that
question, certainly they can teach some something, did they or did
they not answer the question I asked, certainly not, certainly they
did not answer that question, certainly they answered about a good
many things, let me know if they answered my question, certainly
they did not answer my question, the question I asked, and I will
ask a question again, they will not answer the question I will ask
them to answer. When I asked something they did not answer that
question, certainly not, certainly they did not answer that
question, certainly they said something about that thing, certainly
they did not answer my question, they answered some questions, they
certainly did not answer that question the question I asked them, I
will ask them again, they certainly will say something, they will
not explain that thing, I will ask about some other thing, they
will not be able to explain that thing, I am certain that they
cannot explain anything anything I ask them. Some can when they are
in the middle of their young living, in any part of the middle of
their young living can be saying such a thing to themselves inside
them. Some can say such a thing to themselves inside them, in only
one part of the middle of their young living. Very many do then say
such a thing to themselves inside them. Very many do say such a
thing to some other one. Some do say such a thing, almost, to the
teacher teaching them. Some do say such a thing to the teacher
teaching them. Some are hearing some one say such a thing. Some are
listening when some one is saying such a thing. As I was saying
David Hersland was one certainly saying such a thing sometimes to
himself inside him, sometimes to some one, sometime to the teacher
teaching him, sometimes to the teacher teaching him, he was one
saying such a thing in all of the middle of his young living. In
some, saying such a thing is an important thing, being one saying
such a thing is an important thing. Certainly some who have been
ones saying such things are not important ones, excepting while
they are saying such things, to any one. Some saying such things
are needing being ones thinking about the things, such things,
being said by them. Some saying such things are needing to
themselves inside them being ones having been saying such things.
Some are certainly for a good deal of the time they are ones being
living are ones needing in some way being ones saying such a thing.
Different kinds of them in men and women are saying such things in
the way their kind of them can say such things. Each one has their
own being inside them and each one saying such things is using the
being in them for the saying of such things, is feeling with the
being in them about having been, about being one saying such
things. Certainly this has close connection in very many, such
things with angry feeling being in them. Certainly some are not
needing that some one should be one to interfere with them by being
one being one teaching something, they are quite certain. Certainly
they can then have angry feeling some of them, some of them do then
have angry feeling. Some of them do not then always have angry
feeling, some have then almost not at all angry feeling, they have
different kinds of feeling, some do then always have angry feeling,
some do then sometime have angry feeling. Certainly David Hersland
was one not by any means always having then angry feeling, when he
was thinking, when he was feeling, when he was saying such things.
He very often did not then have angry feeling, he could have then
the need in him to be explaining to the one teaching him what he
was thinking about them, he could have it in him sometimes to be
completely disregarding their being existing, he could sometimes be
thinking about them and not hearing them and they were then ones
teaching him, he could be one almost completely listening and then
certainly he would be needing to be teaching them, he could be
wanting them not to be a bother to him while they were ones being
ones teaching him something, he could be one almost having them
being ones being not existing and they certainly were existing then
to themselves and to every one as ones being ones teaching him
something. As I was saying he was one certainly not pleasant to
those teaching him something, he was one certainly not unpleasant
to those teaching him something, he was unpleasant to some, almost
completely unpleasant to some, he was not quite completely pleasant
to any of them, he was very nearly completely pleasant to some of
them. He was one, sometimes needing to be doing some other thing
when some one was being one teaching him then something. This
certainly could happen to him, it certainly did happen to him again
and again.</p>

<p>One was one not completely certain that each one teaching that
one something was one not knowing anything about the thing that one
was teaching. This one was completely certain that some teaching
that one something were ones not knowing anything about that thing.
This one was one almost completely certain about some teaching that
one something that they were ones not knowing anything about the
things they were then teaching to that one. This one in being one
being an older one was quite certain that not any one having been
teaching that one in any regular way anything was one knowing how
the teaching of that thing should have been done. This one then was
one who in later living being in that one was certain that not any
one who had been teaching that one anything knew anything about
teaching, about teaching that one, about teaching any one. This one
was one quite certain in his later living that teaching was
something that some one should be understanding. This one in being
one being later in the living in that one was certain then that
that one was one having it then that that one was teaching
something, was having it then that that one was not one learning
anything then by talking and listening, was one then certain that
that one knowing how thinking can be done, and certainly that one
did then know that thing, was one then certainly one to be teaching
any one and then that one really would not then be doing teaching,
to that one inside in that one, as not any one not knowing about
the way of doing thinking, not realising the way of doing thinking
would be one profiting by such teaching and such a one would not be
needing that thing, that teaching that this one could be doing.
There was then such a one and this one was then in the beginning of
the ending of the middle living in that one. This one was then one
certainly having angry feeling that was irritation, that was
impatient feeling while this one had been a young one and any one
had been teaching that one something. This one was one certainly
not at all pleasant to very many having been teaching this one.
This one was interesting to some teaching this one. This one was
quite pleasant to some teaching this one. David Hersland was not
like this one. David Hersland was a different kind of a one. This
one was one having it to be realising very well the way each one
doing thinking is doing thinking, this one was one not realising
very well which way any one was experiencing anything and the
relation of doing thinking in each one doing thinking with the way
each one is experiencing. This one was then one certainly having
angry feeling when this one was a young one in having any one
teaching that one anything in the way any one was then teaching
that one. This one was then completely the same one in being one
coming to be an older one. This one was one certainly doing
thinking, this one was one certainly knowing about thinking being
done by men and by women doing thinking. This one then was
different from David Hersland. David Hersland was not like this one
I have just been describing. David Hersland was one certainly often
certain that the one that was then teaching him was one not
understanding that thing. David Hersland certainly sometimes
carefully explained, to some one teaching him, that thing. As I am
saying David Hersland was one not like the one I have been just
describing. David Hersland was one certainly doing thinking, David
Hersland was certainly one talking and listening, the one I have
been just describing was one doing talking and listening, David
Hersland was one wanting to be needing to be one teaching each one
something, he was one certainly coming to be early in his middle
living a dead one. He was one certainly finding it often a
troublesome thing to have a governess living in the house with him
as he was one to himself needing to be reading almost anything,
certainly a certain thing, and sometimes a governess said something
about such a thing. He could find it a pleasant thing to have a
governess living in the house with him and he did find it to be a
pleasant thing and then, again and again it was not at all a
pleasant thing but mostly it was not to him at all a serious thing,
they were not any of them really regularly teaching anything to
him.</p>

<p>There are some who are certain, in being ones being in later
living, who are certain that they could have been ones having it
that they had teachers really knowing something and then if they
had had them they would have been ones living a different way in
being ones learning in being living in being one being in being
living. There are in each kind in men and women some having such
feeling in them. David Hersland was not at all one of such of them.
It is a curious thing that the one I was describing as being one
certainly knowing about thinking being in any one is in a way such
a one. Surely this one is not such a one and yet in a way that one
is such a one. That one is such a one although certainly not any
one to that one was when that one was a young one was one really
knowing how to be teaching something to that one and that one when
that one was in the later living in that one was understanding
thinking being in each one thinking and was one certainly thinking
and one then certain that he would be one not teaching as it was
not a thing that one was then feeling any one could be
understanding excepting one not needing that thing and this one was
surely then one certain that some one when that one was a young one
could have been teaching that one something if the one teaching
that one had been understanding teaching. As I was saying in a way
David Hersland was one like this one, in a way David Hersland was
one not like this one, certainly David Hersland was one certain
about almost every one teaching him when he was a young one that
they were not understanding what they were teaching and if they
were understanding what they were teaching were not understanding
how to be teaching. He was not certain about every one, he was to
some teaching him a quite completely pleasant one.</p>

<p>There are some not thinking, not feeling about their knowing
anything, not having angry feeling in them with those teaching them
regularly but have very much such feeling about some teaching them
in some irregular fashion. Some being ones some one is teaching it
is just the other way in them. David Hersland was certainly not of
either of these kinds of them, being one some one is teaching.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of ways of having angry feeling, each one
certainly was having sometimes angry feeling when that one was
being one some one was teaching, each one certainly is having
sometimes angry feeling when that one is being one some one is
teaching.</p>

<p>Some are thinking, some are feeling, some are thinking and
feeling, some are thinking some one is feeling, some are thinking
some one is thinking, some are thinking some one is feeling and
thinking, some are feeling some one is thinking, some are feeling
some one is thinking and feeling, some are feeling some one is
feeling. These are so very many ways of thinking and feeling
connecting, not connecting, of being existing, of not being
existing, there are so many ways of realising and not realising
thinking and feeling being, thinking being, feeling being, feeling
not being, thinking not being, thinking and feeling not being, some
kind of thinking, some kind of feeling not being in some one.</p>

<p>Certainly it is a trouble to me to be doing this thing. I
certainly cannot in any way know it is a trouble to you to do this
thing when you asked me whether you should or should not do this
thing and then did what I said you should do about doing this
thing. I certainly can be realising it is a trouble to me to do
this thing, I certainly cannot be realising it is a trouble to you
to do this thing. You asked me and I told you and you did what I
told you and now you are thinking I should have been feeling that
you were doing that thing from the feeling you were having about
that thing. You certainly asked me what you should do about doing
that thing, I certainly told you what you should do about doing
that thing, you certainly did what I told you to do about doing
that thing.</p>

<p>Some are younger ones than other ones, some are asking ones by
being ones not feeling it to be ones to be deciding ones, some are
ones being ones quite certain that other ones can be ones working
to do deciding, some are ones liking other ones to be ones to be
ones being quicker ones, some are ones not being ones realising
anything inside them at any time before it is a completely finished
thing, and certainly very many in their being ones being living are
ones are being ones to whom some one can be saying, is saying, will
be saying what I have just been telling some one said or could have
said or might have said or will be saying or is saying to some one.
This is to be some description of angry feeling being in men and in
women about such a thing, in all of them. This will be then some
description of one kind of angry feeling, of some explaining and
then some more angry feeling and some more angry feeling and then
sometimes not any more angry feeling and then sometimes more angry
feeling being in men being in men and in women.</p>

<p>It would be easy to have angry feeling, for some, if they were
not coming to be certain that some other one was one coming to be
one not thinking anything that was an important thing to be doing
as thinking. Very many are having sometimes and quite often angry
feeling about some one and then that one comes to be for them one
certainly not being one doing important thinking or feeling or
acting and this one then is going on being asked advice by the one
having had and now not having any angry feeling about that one. So
then asking advice and taking advice is one thing and asking advice
and taking advice is another thing and that in the same one in
relation to the same other one. Giving advice and talking to some
one is one thing and giving advice and talking to some one is
another thing in the same one giving advice and talking to the same
other one.</p>

<p>Some would like to be certain about some one who has been one
talking to them giving advice to them whether that one is one
really one not important in feeling and in thinking. Some are
thinking very often about wanting to be certain about this thing.
If they were certain about this thing they certainly would not be
having in them in any way that is certainly not in most ways angry
feeling against that one. Some are never really certain inside them
about this thing, some are certain and then they are not certain
about this thing in some one who has been one talking to them
giving advice to them when they asked advice of that one. Some are
completely certain and they have angry feeling in them when that
one is talking to them, giving advice to them that they are asking
of that one. Some are certain of that thing that the one having
been one talking to them often and giving advice to them when they
were wanting to have advice given to them is one not important in
thinking and in feeling and are not at all in any way angry inside
in them when that one is talking then when that one is giving
advice to them.</p>

<p>Asking advice is in some kinds in men and in women, in some men
and women of many kinds in men and women. Asking advice means a
different thing in one than it does in another one in the being in
them. Giving advice is in the same way in some kinds in men and
women, is in some men and women of very many kinds in men and
women. It means different things in the being in different kinds in
men and women.</p>

<p>David Hersland was one certainly giving advice some from well in
the beginning of the ending of young living. It meant something in
the being in him. He was one who certainly could have angry feeling
in him in being one giving advice to some one, mostly he was one
not having angry feeling in giving advice to any one. He was one
who certainly did come to be certain about some one about some who
had been one talking to him who had been ones talking to him,
giving advice to him when he was asking for advice to be given, he
was one certainly coming to think of some one, of some of such of
them that they were ones that that one was one not important in
thinking not important in feeling and mostly then Hersland did not
have then any angry feeling in him about that one, about them, he
could have sometime in coming to be certain angry feeling about
some one of such of them. Mostly he did not have angry feeling
inside him in being certain about any one.</p>

<p>As I was saying he was one giving advice certainly a good deal
of advice in being one being living.</p>

<p>Some certainly are liking to be working with sharp knives or
sharp scissors, some are not liking to be working with sharp knives
or sharp scissors, some have angry feeling when some one has been
sharpening the knives or scissors they have been using, some have
angry feeling in them when some one has sharpened a knife or a
scissor for them, some have very angry feeling when some one will
not let the knife or scissors they are using be sharpened so that
they will be sharp ones, some are very angry when some one is
wanting to be using knives and scissors which are not sharp ones
and is preferring them to be not sharp ones. Some are asking always
that some one sharpen the knives or the scissors they are using,
some are angry when they find that some one will not sharpen a
knife or a pair of scissors for them.</p>

<p>As I was saying Martha Hersland was the oldest of the three
Hersland children. Certainly she could have angry feeling,
certainly she could ask advice sometimes from some one, she did ask
advice sometimes that is certain, she certainly did ask advice
sometimes from David Hersland. David Hersland did quite often
enough give advice to Martha and she quite often enough took the
advice he gave her. Certainly she very often listened very much to
him. He certainly listened some. As I was saying he was one who
certainly gave advice quite often while he was one being one being
living. He certainly listened some to advice that might have been
given to him. Some are thinking that he was one not at all ever
listening, he certainly did listen some.</p>

<p>Some are certainly not listening to some and some of such of
them are certainly listening some then. Some are feeling about some
other one that that one is repeating very much and that that one is
very certain that that one is not liking any one to be repeating in
talking and certainly that one is repeating and repeating and
repeating. Some are certain about such a one that that one is one
mostly having an angry feeling when that one is listening and
sometimes that one is not having then an angry feeling and
certainly sometimes then that one is having angry feeling.
Certainly very many are sometimes quite certain about some other
one that that one is not listening to everything that one is
hearing and that that one is one judging in that one as one being
one having been listening completely to everything that one has
been hearing and certainly that one has not been listening to
everything that one has been hearing. Mostly every one sometime is
certain of this thing in every one and very many when they are
certain of this thing have then very much angry feeling in them.
Each one has their own way of having angry feeling in them and
coming out of them.</p>

<p>Angry feeling is coming, coming, not coming, certainly not
coming to be in them in some. Angry feeling is certainly coming to
be in them in some. It is really a surprising thing to some that
they have been having really angry feeling in them. Some are
certainly not feeling in them before, during, after they have been
having angry feeling any of the feeling that would be for them in
their thinking, in their feeling, in their realisation angry
feeling. It is a curious thing that certainly certainly very many
are not feeling any feeling in them giving to them angry feeling
and yet certainly they are just then having angry feeling in them.
This is happening quite often to some. Some are ones of such a kind
of them and of some of such of them not many are knowing that they
are having angry feeling in them when they are having angry feeling
in them. In a way David Hersland quite often was of such of them.
Some of such of them have it that they would be to themselves
having angry feeling if they had more realisation in being one
feeling some of them, some of such of them are ones who would not
have been having angry feeling if they had all the feeling they
were having just then being active in them to them, some would be
having angry feeling to themselves then if they could be certain to
be going on having angry feeling. In a way as I was saying David
Hersland was such a one. In a way he had never in him really a
complete angry feeling, in a way he had sometimes almost complete
angry feeling, in a way really inside him he had sometimes very
angry feeling in him, in a way he had inside him not ever any
really angry feeling in him. He could be telling his sister Martha
sometimes about angry feeling being existing in some. Certainly she
would ask him quite often about angry feeling being existing in
some.</p>

<p>Some are not understanding that every one is not always knowing
that every one can come to be a dead one. Some are always being
ones being quite certain that each one sometime will be coming to
be a dead one. Some are certain every minute in their living that
each one ever living will come sometime to be a dead one. Some are
certain that each one will come to be a dead one, are always
certain of this thing. Some of such of them have quite an angry
feeling when they are realising that some other one is not always
certain of this thing that each one sometime is being one coming to
be a dead one, that sometime each one ever living is a dead one.
Some who are certain of this thing are always in their living
having angry feeling when some one is not certain of this thing in
being one being living, that each one is sometime a dead one. Some
who are all their living completely certain that each one is
sometime certain to be a dead one have in part of their living very
angry feeling when some one is not certain of this thing. Some who
are living are in a way having angry feeling and having irritated
feeling, some who are certain all their living that each one
sometime is coming to be a dead one, when they are hearing some
talking who are not ever feeling about each one coming to be a dead
one sometime. Some who are certain that each one will some-time be
a dead one have some angry feeling in them all their living when
some are not listening to any one who is telling that sometime
every one will be a dead one. Some are pretty nearly certain all
their living that each one sometime will be a dead one. Some are
completely certain all their living that each one ever living will
come to be a dead one sometime. Some have sometimes in their living
angry feeling about what other ones are feeling or are not feeling
about each one being sometime a dead one.</p>

<p>Certainly some are very every minute certain that sometime each
one ever living will be a dead one. Some of such of them are having
angry feeling inside them in being one being certain of this thing.
Some are not always being completely certain that sometime each one
will be a dead one. Some are having angry feeling inside them about
this thing.</p>

<p>Some are having angry feeling about some such thing about being
certain about every one being a dead one sometime, about always
being certain about this thing, about not often being certain about
this thing, about never coming to themselves inside them being
completely certain, completely not certain every minute about this
thing, about not remembering this thing, about not listening about
this thing, about other ones not saying they are certain about this
thing, that they are not certain about this thing, about others
listening, about others refusing to listen to this thing that each
one sometime is a dead one, some are having angry feeling in them
about such a thing sometime in their living and then in parts of
their living they are having very little angry feeling about such
things and part of their living they are having remembering having
angry feeling about such a thing and part of their living they are
not having at all angry feeling about such things. David Hersland
was one of such of them. He certainly all his living was talking
some and listening some he was talking a good deal and listening a
good deal in his living, he certainly was sometimes talking, he
certainly was listening very often to talking about each one coming
to be sometime a dead one.</p>

<p>Some are certain that they are understanding why every one is
being living. Some are certain that they are understanding why any
one is being living. Some are certain that they are understanding
that every one who is living is living. Some are certain that they
are understanding that any one who is living is living. Some are so
certain that they are understanding that every one who is living is
being living that they are boasting about this thing and sometimes
some one hearing them telling about this thing has angry feeling in
that one. One can have been in living, to that one and to mostly
every one, one certain that every one is living in being living but
that that one is not understanding this thing living being in any
one. Such a one can have it come then, to that one, that that one
is understanding this thing, living being in every one being
living, and then that one is finding that one to be a very
different one from what that one has ever been in being living and
that one is telling that thing and telling it so much and in such a
way of telling it again and again that some are then certain that
that one is a different one and some are not certain and some are
certain that that one is not a different one from what that one has
been and some of each of these kinds of them have in them then
angry feeling, some of them have some angry feeling, some have very
little angry feeling, some have very much angry feeling about that
one.</p>

<p>It is certainly interesting what each one feels, thinks, says,
knows, would like to know, does not care about knowing about living
feeling being in anything, in any one, in every one. It is
certainly a very exciting thing to some to feel something in them
about living being in men and in women. It is not at all, not the
least bit an exciting thing to some to feel anything about living
being in men and in women, in anything, in everything.</p>

<p>Some one has been one to that one, to every one knowing that
one, one certainly not going ever to be certain that living being
in any one, in every one, in everything, is a thing that one is
ever going to be understanding and then all of a sudden, sometime
when that one has been changing in some way in doing something,
that one is one to keep on telling that that one certainly does
understand everything that is to say living being in men and in
women. Certainly such a one can have then angry feeling but, very
often, almost mostly, such a one is not just then having angry
feeling and certainly some are having about such a one then angry
feeling and some are not having then about such a one any angry
feeling.</p>

<p>David Hersland was one who almost came to be one certain
sometime to be completely understanding being being in men and in
women being living. He was one certainly almost and not so very
often still quite often coming to be certain of being one
completely understanding everything. As I was saying he had
sometimes then angry feeling, certainly some had about him then
some angry feeling. Sometimes then he had not any angry feeling.
Certainly there were some then interested about him then who had
not then angry feeling. Some who were not very much interested had
about him then angry feeling, some who were not very much
interested in him then had not then about him any angry feeling. As
I was saying he was almost one having it to be in him to be
completely certain that he was understanding everything again and
again and sometimes all of a sudden. As I was saying he was almost
such a one, he was quite often almost such a one. There are
certainly some coming to be quite certain, some all of a sudden,
that they are understanding everything. Some have about some such a
one very angry feeling, David Hersland did have in being living
about some of such of them angry feeling, about some others of such
of them he had a very gentle feeling, about some others of such of
them he had a very sympathetic feeling, about some others of such
of them he had a very interested feeling, about some others of such
of them he had a scared feeling, about some others of such of them
he had really a completely surprised feeling, about some others of
such of them he had a very silly feeling, about some others of such
of them he had an annoyed feeling, about some others of such of
them he had quite an indifferent feeling, about some others of such
of them he had sometimes a very earnest feeling, about some others
of such of them he had intensely an inquiring feeling, about some
others of such of them he had a disgusted feeling, about some
others of such of them he had a very sorrowful feeling, about some
others of such of them he had a disappointed feeling, about some
others of such of them he had a feeling that made him be one going
on scolding them every time he thought about them, about some
others of some of them he was not certain but perhaps they really
did understand everything and then sometimes he was quite certain
that they did not understand everything and then sometimes he had a
humble feeling perhaps they were understanding everything and then
sometimes he had a certain feeling that they were not understanding
everything. As I am saying David Hersland was one having it to be
almost one to be sometimes completely certain that he was
understanding everything.</p>

<p>Certainly some in one way of being ones being living, some in
other ways of being ones being living come to be certain, some
gradually, some all of a sudden, some sometime, some sometimes,
some quite often, some very often, come to be certain that they are
understanding every one being one being living. Some as I am saying
are having when they are having this thing angry feeling, some when
they are having this thing are not having it to be having any angry
feeling. Some about such of them have angry feeling, some have not
any angry feeling about any one of such of them. As I am saying
there are very many ways of coming to be certain of being one
understanding living being in men and in women. As I am saying
there are very many ways of being impressed of not being impressed
by any one of such of them, by some of such of them, by many of
such of them, by every one of such of them.</p>

<p>There are certainly many ways of feeling, of thinking, of liking
of not liking living being in men and in women, living being
existing. Very many are convinced that living is a real thing,
something they are certain is existing, some are not so certain of
this thing. Some are content with living being existing, some are
not at all content with this thing. Some are certainly certain that
if every one were understanding everything that not any one will
only be wanting to be certain only that living is being existing.
Some are so certain that understanding anything is amusing to every
one, and certainly it is not it is not at all amusing to some it is
not at all interesting to some. Some are so certain that
understanding anything is interesting to every one that they are
certain that sometime every one will be understanding something.
Some are so certain that understanding everything is a necessary
thing that they are certain that sometime they will be
understanding everything. Some of such of them come to be certain
that they are understanding everything, to some of such of them it
comes all of a sudden.</p>

<p>As I was saying some of such of them have angry feeling in them
then, as I was saying some of such of them have not at all angry
feeling in them then. As I was saying David Hersland in a way was
almost such a one.</p>

<p>If he feels it and he knows it and he tells it and he thinks it
and he says it, clearly tells it why then perhaps it is something
and perhaps it is not anything. Some are certain that clear
thinking and clear telling and certain feeling and complete emotion
are something some one can be doing. Some are certain that sometime
they will be having complete emotion and certain feeling and clear
thinking and eloquent expression. Some are certain that they are
having clear thinking and complete emotion and adequate expression
and absolute conviction. Some are certain that they have been
having clear thinking and complete emotion and complete conviction
and adequate expression. Some are certainly very clearly thinking,
some certainly have then complete conviction. Some are certainly
having complete emotion and are clearly thinking and are having
adequate expression and perhaps are really having then absolute
conviction. Some are certainly having sometime complete emotion and
adequate expression. Some are perhaps having sometime complete
emotion and clear thinking and adequate expression. Some are
perhaps having clear thinking and adequate expression and some
emotion, very much emotion and pretty nearly absolute conviction.
Some are certainly having clear thinking and adequate expression
and considerable emotion. Some are certainly not having completely
clear thinking and complete emotion and adequate expression and
absolute conviction.</p>

<p>Some one is certain that some other one is doing clear thinking,
is having adequate expression, is having almost complete
conviction, is certainly not having complete emotion. That one is
certain that the other one is one having pretty nearly complete
emotion, not at all any clear thinking, not at all absolute
conviction, might easily be having adequate expression.</p>

<p>Which is then the important one, certainly one of the two of
them. One of the two of them is certainly in a way the important
one. One of the two of them is certainly in a way not the important
one.</p>

<p>David Hersland was certain that really one of them was the more
important one. David Hersland was one certainly in a way not having
complete emotion, certainly in a way doing clear thinking,
certainly in a way having adequate expression, certainly having
very nearly absolute conviction. He had absolute conviction. He had
clear thinking, he had adequate expression, he felt inside him
complete emotion.</p>

<p>Some are working hard to be ones telling some one something.
Some are working and are telling some one something. Some are not
working hard to tell some one something. Some are not working hard
and they are then telling some one something.</p>

<p>To some spirituality and idealism have no meaning excepting as
meaning completest intensification of any experiencing, any
conception of transcending experience has to some not any meaning.
To some anything to have meaning must be existing, to some anything
to have meaning must be being, having been going to be experienced
as something existing by some one. Many who are carefully and
completely thinking have it to leave out something they have been,
they will be, they are, they can be experiencing and this is a very
natural thinking as very many who have it to be ones clearly and
completely reasonably thinking have it to have it that they are
thinking to be solving a problem and naturally then they are not
thinking into them everything they can be experiencing. Some are
quite certain that any one very clearly thinking are not ever
completely experiencing, some are quite certain that any one
clearly thinking is leaving out very much that should be being
remembered by that one. Some certainly have a conception that
everything should be intelligible to some one, certainly some of
such of them are to some others, listening to them, not convincing.
Some have it to be experiencing that they are experiencing more
than experiencing and this is to very many completely convincing
and it is to some completely convincing in some, and it is
altogether convincing to some and to some it is convincing when
these having it in them to have such experiencing of something that
is not experiencing explain their experience, to some it is not
then convincing. To some, some having experiencing of something
which is more than any experiencing are convincing when they are
explaining this thing. To some it would be a very pleasant thing if
not any one having such experiencing ever got mixed up between what
was, what is, what will be to that one and how it comes to be, how
it came to be, how it will come to be, in short the explanation,
the description, the condition what as experience to them was
without any condition.</p>

<p>As I am saying some are working in being ones being thinking,
some are not working in being ones being thinking. Some are
certainly thinking and working in being one being thinking and
certainly coming to an ending in their thinking and doing it the
thinking as a complete thing and certainly carefully doing that
thing and certainly clearly telling the thinking they have been
doing. Some certainly then have not been putting in everything that
any one could be experiencing that is connected with the thing
about which they have been thinking, some will not put in some
experiencing, some cannot put in some experiencing, some are
certain that they have put in all that experiencing, some put in
almost all experiencing that has anything to do with that thing
when they are thinking about that thing.</p>

<p>Certainly to be completely experiencing, to be clearly thinking,
to have real conviction, to have enthusiasm, to keep on going in
doing thinking and having experiencing is a very enjoyable thing.
Certainly very many are very clearly thinking that is quite a
number are certainly quite thinking quite clearly. David Hersland
was such a one. He certainly had enthusiasm, he certainly could
have some experiencing, he certainly was needing for his own
satisfaction to put in everything any one could be experiencing in
thinking about anything. He certainly was one completely wanting to
do this thing. He was one in a way doing this thing. He was one in
a way never coming to be completely doing this thing, he was one
having almost absolute conviction, he was one having real
enthusiasm. He was one not being certain that experiencing being
intensified was spirituality and idealism. He was not certain that
one could not be experiencing something that was a different thing.
He almost came to be certain that one could not be experiencing
something more complete than any experiencing, he came to be almost
certain that one can be experiencing something that is more than
experiencing. He came to be certainly quite certain that not anyone
could explain such a thing, he came to be almost certain that
perhaps he could sometime explain such a thing.</p>

<p>Some certainly and certainly they were not expecting to be doing
that thing come sometime to be explaining what they were certain
certainly was not existing. This is quite common. Some certainly
come to be quite certain that something is existing that they were
completely certain was not ever existing. David Hersland was in a
way not at all such a one.</p>

<p>Many are very logical in being ones being thinking. Some
demonstrate something in being ones being thinking. Many are very
logical in being ones being thinking. Some keep on demonstrating
something. Many are very logical in being ones being thinking, some
of these are demonstrating something, some of these are beginning
demonstrating something, some of these are not really demonstrating
anything, some of these are occasionally demonstrating something.
It is like this, many who are logical ones are while they are being
logical are always experiencing being one being living, some while
they are being logical ones are being ones experiencing a great
deal of being ones being living, some while they are being logical
are experiencing very little of being ones being living, some while
they are being logical have at times the conviction of being ones
experiencing being living, some are certain that being logical ones
makes of them ones being ones experiencing being living and this is
perhaps true of them. The way each one is experiencing the amount
each one is experiencing living is then a thing that some one is
knowing, that some one is not knowing, that some are not knowing of
themselves inside them, that some are knowing of themselves inside
them, about which some have conviction, about which some do not
have conviction, about which some have conviction and they
certainly are not knowing what they are certain they are knowing,
about which some have conviction and they certainly are knowing
what they are knowing, about which some are not knowing that they
are having a conviction, about which some are having a conviction
and are not certain of that thing, about which some are quite
certain they have not any conviction, about which some are
certainly not knowing everything, about which some are knowing more
than others are knowing, about which some are knowing very much,
about which some are knowing hardly anything. So then experiencing
being one being living is a thing about which some are knowing very
much in themselves, in other ones. Experiencing being one being
living is something some have very much in them. Experiencing being
one being living is something many are certainly having some.
Experiencing being one being living is certainly something every
one is having some. Certainly some are having more than others are
having of being one experiencing being one being living.</p>

<p>Surely some one is meaning something by what that one is saying.
It would be a nuisance for some not to be certain of this thing.
Some one is meaning something when that one is saying something.
Certainly in each one there is a connection between what that one
is saying and that one is meaning, certainly in some way there must
be some connection. Each one has their own way inside them of
meaning something, each one has their own way of having connection
between what that one is meaning and what that one is thinking,
between what that one is meaning and what that one is saying, about
what that one is meaning and what that one is feeling, about what
that one is meaning and what that one is certain is conviction in
that one.</p>

<p>It would be a nuisance for some not to be certain of this thing
that each one has some connection in them between what they are
meaning what they are saying what they are feeling, what they are
thinking, what they are certain about in being one being
living.</p>

<p>Certainly some are pretty certain that there is not enough
connection to make it interesting, in very many, between what they
are meaning, they are thinking, they are feeling, they are saying,
they are certain in something existing.</p>

<p>I mean, I mean and that is not what I mean, I mean that not any
one is saying what they are meaning, I mean that I am feeling
something, I mean that I mean something and I mean that not any one
is thinking, is feeling, is saying, is certain of that thing, I
mean that not any one can be saying, thinking, feeling, not any one
can be certain of that thing, I mean I am not certain of that
thing, I am not ever saying, thinking, feeling, being certain of
this thing, I mean, I mean, I know what I mean.</p>

<p>And certainly some one is right in saying such a thing, such a
one some of such of them certainly are right in saying such a
thing. Some of such of them have it that the moment of sensibility,
emotion and expression and origin is all in a state of completion
and then it is a finished thing and certainly then that one was
meaning something and he was saying I mean, I mean, and it was all
finished and then there was another something and this one
certainly very often said I mean. That one said that very often in
being one being living.</p>

<p>Surely in some way there is some connection between what each
one is meaning and saying and feeling and thinking and being
certain of in living. Surely it would be a very great nuisance to
ones being ones being living if there were not some connection in
each one between meaning and feeling and saying and thinking and
being certain in each one.</p>

<p>Some are quite certain that there is very little connection
certainly not enough to make it interesting between what every one
is meaning and what every one is thinking and what every one is
saying and what every one is feeling and of what every one is
certain. David Hersland, yes he might be one of such of them.</p>

<p>Some are quite certain that there is enough connection to make
it completely interesting between what every one is meaning and
what every one is thinking and what every one is feeling and of
what every one is certain. David Hersland was certainly one of such
of them.</p>

<p>Some are certainly knowing what they are meaning, some are
certainly not knowing what they are meaning. Certainly every one in
a way is meaning something, certainly every one in a way is saying,
is thinking, is feeling, is quite certain of something.</p>

<p>Which way some one is meaning anything, which way some one is
meaning everything, how some one is meaning what that one is
saying, meaning, feeling, thinking and being certain, what that one
is doing, feeling, thinking and of what that one is certain, how
that one is going on meaning something, meaning anything, meaning
everything, which way that one is going on meaning what that one is
saying, feeling, thinking, doing, what connection there is in that
one between living in that one and being in that one, how that one
is liking is not liking what that one means to any one knowing that
one, how that one is liking is not liking what that one is not
meaning to some one, to any one, how anything coming into that one
comes out of that one, how some things coming into that one hardly
are coming out of that one, how much the things coming out of that
one are different from the things going into that one, how quickly
and how slowly, how completely, how gradually, how intermittently,
how noisily, how silently, how happily, how drearily, how
difficulty, how gaily, how complicatedly, how simply, how joyously,
how boisterously, how despondingly, how fragmentarily, how
delicately, how roughly, how excitedly, how energetically, how
persistently, how repeatedly, how repeatingly, how dryly, how
startlingly, how funnily, how certainly, how hesitatingly, anything
is coming out of that one, what is being in each one and how
anything comes into that one and comes out of that one makes of
each one one meaning something and feeling, telling, thinking,
being certain and being living.</p>

<p>Certainly the way of experiencing anything and expressing that
thing is the being being in each one. Certainly there are groups of
men and women as to ways of experiencing things in being ones being
living, certainly there are groups of them who in a way have the
same ways of experiencing in them and these have each of them ways
of experiencing something. Each one of them are meaning something
to themselves inside them, to any other one, in being ones being
living and having their own way of being ones experiencing
anything, of being ones expressing anything.</p>

<p>Some are not knowing what kind they are of ones experiencing, of
ones expressing, very many are not knowing what kind they are of
ones experiencing, of ones expressing. In a way David Hersland did
know very well what kind he was of ones experiencing, of ones
expressing, in a way he never came to be completely certain that he
was not perhaps another kind of a one experiencing, another kind of
a one expressing.</p>

<p>Some have almost a way of saying what they are meaning. Some
have a way of thinking, a way of feeling in them and a way of
needing to be meaning something in them and they have for very much
of their living almost a way of saying what they are meaning and
for part of their living they have a way of saying what they are
meaning. Some have a way of feeling something and almost a way of
thinking something and they have all their living a way of saying
what they are meaning. Some have all their living a way of saying
what they are meaning. Some have a way of saying what they are
meaning dimly. Some have a way of saying what they are meaning
dreamily. Some have a way of saying what they are meaning
doubtingly. Some have in their living a way of saying what they are
meaning and then they have not a way of saying what they are
meaning, they have not then any way for them of saying what they
are meaning. Some certainly are slowly coming to a way of saying
what they are meaning. Some certainly any time in their being one
being living are ones having a way, having ways of saying what they
are meaning.</p>

<p>Some certainly are ones feeling completely feeling something,
are ones thinking very well about everything, are ones certainly to
themselves sometime going to be needing to be ones saying what they
are meaning and some of such of them are saying what they are not
meaning while they are not saying what they are meaning and some
then are not saying anything when they are not saying what they are
meaning. Some of such of them are certain that sometime they will
be ones saying something saying what they are meaning. Some of such
of them are almost certain that they will not ever be saying
anything, saying what they are meaning. Some of such of them are
sometime saying something, saying what they are meaning, some of
such of them are not sometime saying something, saying what they
are meaning. David Hersland was not at all one of any such a kind
of them.</p>

<p>Some are quite certain that they are knowing what each one
saying anything is meaning by what they are saying. David Hersland
was in a way one of such of them. Some are quite certain that each
one is meaning something when they are saying anything. In a way
David Hersland was almost such a one. Some are certain that each
one is one wanting to be meaning something by what that one is
saying. David Hersland was not such a one, he was somewhat such a
one sometimes in his living. Some are certain that each one is one
not wanting to be meaning something by what that one is saying.
David Hersland was hardly ever at all really such a one. Some are
certain that each one is one liking it to be one meaning something
by what they are saying when they are saying anything, David
Hersland was pretty nearly one of such of them.</p>

<p>Some are believing that mostly every one is meaning the same
thing in being one being living. David Hersland could have been one
being such a one, David Hersland was not one being such a one. Just
the Way each one is experiencing what they are experiencing, how
much they are experiencing in the way they are experiencing, how
much of the time in being one being living they are experiencing
much, they are experiencing little, how strongly they are
experiencing what they are experiencing in the way they are
experiencing and what way and how much they are thinking, what
connection there is in them each one between experiencing and
thinking, what result it has all in them as meaning and how and
when and what way they are telling what they are meaning, that is a
thing certainly in each one interesting to some, that is a thing in
every one interesting to some, that was a thing certainly
completely interesting to Hersland, a thing he needed to have
completely interesting to him, a thing about which he was
completely thinking and in a way he was one wanting to be needing
to be one completely certain that there was not complete interest
in him in any such complete realisation, in a way he was one
needing to be completely certain that he was complete in needing
the realisation of experiencing and thinking and meaning and
telling in all men and women, in a way he was one wanting to be
needing to be certain to be interested in not being certain that
any such realisation would be complete living for him. He was one
sometimes in being one being living feeling one way of wanting to
be needing to be a complete one and sometimes in being living
feeling another way of wanting to be needing completeness in being
living, he was one sometimes wanting to be needing not completeness
in being one being living. He was one certainly very much an
interested one in experiencing, in thinking, in meaning, in telling
being in men and in women.</p>

<p>Some one is feeling very strongly about something, that one is
thinking about the thing about which that one is having then strong
feeling, that one then is telling about the thing about which that
one is having then strong feeling. This one is telling about the
thing about which that one is having then strong feeling, certainly
not any one is having then strong feeling about that thing
excepting the one telling about that thing. Not any one perhaps
could have strong feeling about that thing excepting the one
telling about that thing. There are some who have it in them to
have strong feeling about something and perhaps not any one ever
being living could be having that kind of a strong feeling about
that thing. David Hersland was not such a one. Some one is feeling
very strongly about something, that one is thinking about the thing
about which that one is having then strong feeling, that one then
is telling about the thing about which that one is having then
strong feeling. This one is telling about the thing about which
that one is having then strong feeling, certainly one other one is
having then strong feeling about that thing, the one telling about
that thing is having then about that thing strong feeling and
another one. David Hersland was not such a one one having strong
feeling about something and thinking about that thing and telling
about that thing and having one other one having then a strong
feeling about that thing. There are some having a strong feeling
about something, they are thinking about that thing, they are
telling about that thing, there are other ones then having strong
feeling about that thing about which these ones, such a one, is
feeling a strong feeling, is thinking about, is telling about.
David Hersland was one of such of them ones having strong feeling
about some thing and thinking about that thing and telling about
that thing and these being then some who are having then strong
feeling about the thing, about which the one had been having strong
feeling, about which that one had been thinking, about which that
one had been telling. Some are remembering how something was
happening when they are feeling about that thing, when they are
thinking about that thing, when they are telling about that thing.
David Hersland was pretty completely one of such of them. Some are
remembering what was happening when they are telling about
something not when they are feeling about that thing not when they
are thinking about that thing. Some are remembering what was
happening not when they are telling about that thing, not when they
are feeling about that thing, they are remembering what was
happening when they are thinking about that thing. Some are
remembering what was happening when they are feeling about that
thing and not when they are thinking about that thing but when they
are telling about that thing. Some are remembering what was
happening when they are feeling about a thing and when they are
thinking about that thing but not when they are telling about that
thing. Some are remembering what was happening when they are
feeling about a thing, not when they are telling about the thing,
not when they are thinking about the thing.</p>

<p>Some are certainly clearly thinking completely clearly thinking,
some have all their living been pretty clearly thinking, some have
it to be needing to be to themselves what they are that is one
certainly thinking clearly completely clearly about anything about
which they are thinking. Some of these certainly are thinking very
clearly about anything about which they are clearly thinking, some
of these are boasting, not to themselves, some yes to themselves,
some to some others, some to very many others, some to one, of this
thing. Some are certain that they are not boasting about this
thing, some are quite certain they are not boasting about this
thing, some who are telling it very much and very often that they
certainly are clearly thinking about anything they are thinking and
they certainly are thinking clearly about anything about which they
are thinking are completely certain that telling about this thing
by them to a good many, to every one is not boasting. Some who are
clearly thinking, who are thinking clearly about everything about
which they are thinking are needing to be certain that they have
come to the right conclusion, sometime about everything. David
Hersland in a way was not such a one. Some who are thinking clearly
about everything about which they are thinking are not certain that
they will sometime come to a right conclusion about anything about
which they are thinking clearly. Some are certain that if they can
keep on clearly thinking they will certainly sometime come to a
completely right conclusion about everything about which they are
thinking clearly that is about anything about which they are really
thinking. David Hersland was in a way not such a one. Some
certainly are thinking very clearly about anything about which they
are thinking, some certainly can keep on pretty well thinking
clearly about everything about which they are thinking.</p>

<p>Each one has his has her own way of being one experiencing in
being one being living. Each one is of a kind in men and women, of
a kind of way of being one experiencing, of being one experiencing
anything, of being one experiencing being one being living.</p>

<p>Each one in some way can know, each one in some way cannot know,
each one in some ways does know, each one in some ways does not
know of each one some one in some ways can know, some one in some
ways cannot know, of each one some can in some way know, some can
in some way not know what they are meaning by being one being
living, each one, how they are thinking, how much and what way they
are boasting, how they can and how they cannot be experiencing,
what some other one could be meaning who might be having almost
such a being in them as that other one has in them. Certainly some
are not thinking about anything and these are ones very clearly
certain about many things and are clearly certainly expressing what
they are knowing and they are not changing when others are
changing. Certainly some are not thinking about anything and they
are clearly feeling something and they are clearly telling that
thing, and they certainly are not changing when they have not been
feeling a new feeling about the thing they have been clearly
telling, their feeling. David Hersland might have been one of such
of them, he was not one of such of them, he certainly was one
thinking about mostly everything about which he was having feeling.
He might have been one not thinking about anything but having
clearly a feeling about that thing and clearly expressing the
feeling he was having and not doing any thinking and not doing any
changing and having then more clear feeling and clearly expressing
that clear feeling. He might have been such a one. He certainly
might have been such a one. He certainly was one having clear
feeling about some thing, he was one certainly thinking about
things, he certainly was one clearly expressing what he was feeling
when he was clearly feeling something, he was one certainly
thinking about almost everything, he was one in a way needing to be
having complete thinking, he was one not really wanting to be
needing complete thinking, he was one certainly thinking about
almost everything.</p>

<p>He was certainly to some one in a way boasting about being one
being living in being one being the one he was then. To very many
he was certainly one not boasting about this thing. He was one
certainly to himself one sometimes boasting of this thing, he
certainly was one liking to be to some, one boasting of this
thing.</p>

<p>Mostly every one is needing some one to be one listening to that
one being one being one boasting. David Hersland in a way was not
one needing one to be one listening to him being one being one
boasting. There certainly were some who were listening then to him.
He was one in away not really needing this thing and that was
because he was one so clearly tilling what he was so clearly
feeling. He needed some to be listening while he was thinking, he
did have very many to listen while he was thinking, he almost was
not needing this thing. Some who are thinking are very much needing
some one to be one boastingly listening, some who are thinking are
needing some one to be listening to them and saying something and
not really saying that thing. Some are needing to be having some
one saying something and they are not seriously considering the
serious thing they are needing that some one is saying while they
are thinking. David Hersland could in a way be one of such of them.
Very many are completely ones of such of them.</p>

<p>Thinking, boasting, listening, remembering, forgetting, feeling,
and meaning, and telling are in some being living.</p>

<p>Some are certainly completely interested in going on being
living, some are not completely interested in this thing, some are
almost completely interested in this thing. In a way David Hersland
was not completely interested in this thing, in a way he was almost
completely interested in this thing. Some are thinking about being
interested in this thing, about being interested in going on being
living. Some are telling every one how interesting it is to be
interested in this thing. Some are boasting about being completely
interested in this thing, some are boasting about not being at all
interested in this thing. Sometimes it is astonishing that some one
has been forgetting that that one is completely interested in this
thing. Some are pretty nearly always remembering that they are
completely interested in this thing. Being ones completely
interested in being ones going on being living is what very many
are certain is not all of living to them. Being ones completely
interested in being ones going on being living is what very many
are having as very nearly all of living for them. Each one ever
living is certainly sometimes completely interested in being one
going on being living. David Hersland as I was saying was in a way
not completely interested in this thing, was in a way almost
completely interested in this thing. He was one certainly talking
about this thing, he was one certainly listening to some talking
about this thing, he was one certainly sometimes boasting about
being one perhaps sometime going to be completely interested in
this thing, he was one certainly mostly remembering about being
interested in this thing, he was one certainly sometimes quite
forgetting about any one being interested in this thing, he could
certainly be feeling something about the meaning of this thing, he
certainly could do very much thinking about the meaning of this
thing. He could certainly be feeling something about being one
going on being living, about any one going on being living, he
certainly could think very much and very often about any one being
one going on being living. He could certainly feel something about
this thing, he could certainly think very much indeed about this
thing, he could certainly feel a little something about this thing,
he could certainly feel a little something about any one not going
on being living, he could certainly think very much about this
thing.</p>

<p>Some are thinking very much in being ones being living, some are
not thinking very much in being ones being living. Some are
thinking very much about being ones going on being living, in being
ones being living, some are not thinking very much about being ones
going on being living, in being ones being living. Some are feeling
very much about being ones going on being living, some are not
feeling so much about being ones going on being living. Some are
certainly boasting very much about feeling about being ones being
going on being living, some are boasting very much about being ones
not feeling very much about being ones going on being living. David
Hersland went on being living until he was at the ending of the
beginning of his middle living and then he was not any longer going
on being living.</p>

<p>Some are changing while they are living in their feeling about
being one going on being living, about any one being one going on
being living. Some are changing very much in their feeling about
this thing. Very many are changing very much in their feeling about
this thing during the time they are being one being living. Some do
not change so very much in their feeling about this thing while
they are ones being living. David Hersland certainly changed some
in his feeling about this thing while he was one being living, he
certainly did not change so very much in his feeling about this
thing in being one being living. He was one thinking very much and
very often about any one going on being living, he certainly
thought very different things about this thing at different times
in his being one being living. Each one in a way is feeling
something about ones going on being living, about that one being
one being living. Certainly each one feels in some way something
about such a thing. Feeling and thinking about ones, about that one
being going on living, thinking, boasting, listening, remembering,
forgetting, feeling, and meaning, and telling about being one,
about being ones going on being living is in some going on being
living.</p>

<p>Some are having a very delicate feeling and they are ones that
can be thinking and they are ones sometimes delightfully telling
something, beautifully telling something, touchingly telling
something, quaintly telling something, freshly telling something
and they are ones dully telling something and flatly telling
something and harshly telling something and telling and telling and
not telling anything, and telling something so that some one can be
saying certainly that one was thinking that other one was not
knowing anything and certainly the one was knowing that that one
was certain that the one was not knowing anything. Some are having
quite a delicate feeling and they are often thinking and they are
telling what they are meaning and certainly it is sometimes quite a
beautiful telling they are doing and certainly sometimes not a
beautiful telling that they are doing. Some are feeling very
delicately and they are thinking and they are completely telling
very beautifully something. Some are feeling delicately and they
are not doing very much thinking and they are sometimes quite
beautifully telling something. David Hersland was not of any of
these kinds of them. Some are not feeling delicately about anything
and they are thinking very much and very often and they are
sometimes almost beautifully telling about something. Some are not
feeling at all delicately about something and they are thinking
very much and very often and they are persisting and they are
sometimes almost really completely beautifully telling something,
almost beautifully telling something, almost completely telling
something, almost beautifully completely telling something. David
Hersland was not of any such a kind in men and women. Some are
certainly quite not having any delicate feeling about anything and
they are persisting and they have complete realisation of being one
loving everything and they are thinking very much and very often
and they are quite completely delicately thinking and such of them
can be ones succeeding very well in being ones being living, they
can be ones not feeling beautifully or delicately about anything,
they can be ones succeeding very well in being ones going on being
living, they can be ones living very completely to be ones teaching
being good ones in being ones going on being living. David Hersland
was not one of such of them. Some are feeling delicately about
something and are not feeling delicately about any other thing,
some are feeling delicately and sensitively and completely about
some things and not about other things, some of these are thinking
very much and very often, some of these are almost completely
telling beautifully about something, David Hersland was in a way
one of such of them. Some are thinking to make a thing a complete
thing more when they are younger ones than when they are older
ones. Some are thinking to make anything a complete thing more when
they are older ones than when they are younger ones. Some are
wanting to be needing to think some thing to be a complete thing
more when they are younger ones than when they are older ones, some
more when they are older ones than when they are younger ones. Some
are needing to be thinking a thing a complete thing when they are
younger ones and when they are older ones. Some certainly are all
their living needing to be thinking something to be a complete
thing, some are certainly needing all their living to be thinking
everything to be a complete thing. Some are certainly all their
living wanting to be needing to be thinking everything to be to
them a complete thing, some are certainly all their living wanting
to be needing to think some thing out to be a complete thing. David
Hersland was certainly sometimes in his being one being living
almost needing to be thinking something out to be a complete thing,
he certainly was in his younger living, he certainly was sometimes
in his older living needing to be sometimes thinking everything out
to be a complete thing. He was not in his living ever completely
wanting to be needing to be thinking everything out to be a
complete thing, he was certainly in his living, in his younger
living certainly and perhaps in his later living almost completely
wanting to be needing to be thinking something out as a complete
thing. David Hersland was of a kind in men and women having it in
them to have feeling clearly in them, to be telling clearly the
feeling they have in them, to have very much feeling in them and to
have it in them, some of them, very often. David Hersland was one
who was thinking very much and very often and he was certainly
thinking very clearly when he was thinking and he certainly was
thinking very much in being one being living. He was one in a way
needing to be thinking out a thing to be a complete thing. He was
one feeling clearly, telling clearly what he was clearly feeling,
he was one feeling very much and very often. He was one wanting to
be needing to be feeling having every woman being in some ways a
beautiful one. He was one feeling very much and very often, he was
one feeling clearly and completely what he was feeling. He was one
telling clearly what he was feeling. He was one thinking clearly
very much and very often. He was one in a way needing to be one
thinking things to be completed things, he was one then making
anything a transparent thing and then it was a little a confused
thing for certainly he was wanting to be needing to be feeling that
any woman was in some ways a really beautiful one. He was one
clearly thinking clearly feeling and doing both very much and very
often and that together made it that he was one needing in a way to
be thinking everything to be a completed thing and in a way then he
was not succeeding in being in living for then he came to be one
making everything a pretty transparent thing, a thing so clear that
it was a sparkling thing, a thing so clear that it did not have
beginning or middle or ending and as I was saying it was not a
completely clear thing as certainly he was pretty completely
wanting to be needing to be feeling that any woman that could ever
be existing was in some way a really beautiful thing. David
Hersland was not any longer living and some one had a trunk that he
had had and always liked to use it when that one was travelling.
Some one was very indignant that he had come to be a dead one and
almost went out to where he was not any longer living to complain
to some one about this thing. Some one knew only some time later
after David Hersland was not any longer living that he was not any
longer living and that one felt it to be a completely strange thing
that David Hersland was not any longer living and after that it was
not a strange thing and after that it was not a real thing as
certainly he could not have been one being living, and after that
there was another one very much like David Hersland and that one
was already not any longer living the one like David Hersland
before the one who had known David Hersland knew about this one.
There was another one who had certainly been one going to be very
sorry if anything happened to David Hersland and that one was sorry
when David Hersland came to be a dead one. There was one who was
excited about David Hersland having come to be a dead one because
David Hersland certainly might have been going on being living if
he had not come to be a dead one. This one was excited again and
again about this thing. There was one who was tenderly completely a
sad one and then always was about this thing about David Hersland
being a dead one a tenderly complete sad one. David Hersland then
in a way was one having been living in being living. David Hersland
was of a kind in men and women. There are many kinds in men and
women. Each kind has a way of thinking, of feeling, of experiencing
anything.</p>

<p>Some have babies in being one being living, some do not have any
of them, David Hersland never had any of them. Some would like to
have them, some would not hike to have them. David Hersland was
never really wanting to be needing to have much feeling about
having babies in being one being living. He did not have any of
them. He did not ever come to have very much feeling about he
himself having them. He could come to have feeling about some
needing to be wanting to be having some of them, about some needing
to be wanting not to be having some of them.</p>

<p>Some do have many of them. Some do not have many of them.
Certainly some completely do not want to have any of them, some
almost completely do not want to have any of them, some certainly
completely want to have some of them, some certainly completely
Want to have one of them, some certainly completely want to have
many of them, some almost completely want to have many of them,
some almost completely want to have some of them. Certainly very
many are interested in some wanting, in some not wanting to have
any of them, some are not at all interested in anybody wanting in
anybody not wanting to have any of them. David Hersland was
certainly not completely, not almost completely interested in
anybody wanting in anybody not wanting any of them. Being a baby
was not to him completely interesting. It was not to him completely
uninteresting, certainly not completely uninteresting, really
certainly not completely uninteresting.</p>

<p>David Hersland was certainly one needing to be saying something
about babies and men and babies and women. Babies and men and
babies and women were not to him completely interesting. He
certainly sometimes was talking and certainly sometimes was
listening to talking about babies and women, about babies and men.
Babies and men, and babies and women were not to him almost
completely interesting. He certainly sometimes and sometimes quite
often talked very much about babies and men, and babies and women.
Certainly many are talking sometimes and sometimes very often about
something and that thing is not to them completely interesting and
that thing is not to them almost completely interesting and they
are liking very well the talking they are doing about this thing
and they are liking very well the listening they are doing to any
one talking about this thing. Certainly then babies, having them,
not having them was not completely an interesting thing to David
Hersland was not almost completely an interesting thing to him.</p>

<p>Some things were completely interesting things to David
Hersland, some things were almost completely interesting things to
him, some things he was wanting to be having as completely
interesting things to him, some things were almost completely not
interesting things to him. Certainly some remembered that David
Hersland had said something sometimes about any one having, about
any one not having, not going to be having, going to be having,
having had, not having had, liking, not liking having babies.
Certainly some remembered what David Hersland had been saying about
such a thing and some were talking quite often about what he had
been saying about such a thing and some were certainly talking
quite often about such a thing and not then any more remembering
very much about what he had said about such a thing and some were
not then, some of such of them, remembering that he had talked
sometimes about such a thing and some were, some of such of them,
were remembering very well that he had some times been talking
about such a thing. He certainly had been talking some sometimes
about such a thing, he certainly sometimes was convincing some one
of something when he was talking about such a thing.</p>

<p>Certainly every one can have been one, can be one imagining
something, some are imagining everything to be anything, some are
very carefully imagining something to be anything, some are
dreamily imagining something to be anything, some are daintily
imagining anything to be something, some are very carefully
imagining again and again the same thing to be something, some have
earnest feeling in imagining everything to be anything, some have a
tired feeling in imagining something to be anything. Some are
telling very much and very often the way they were, the way they
are, the way they will be imagining anything to be something, some
are very much interested in their being one having been, being,
going to be being one imagining everything to be something some are
very much interested in their own imagining everything being
something and in every one else's imagining everything being
something, some find it very interesting that every one else is
imagining everything being something. Some were imagining some
things being some things when they were young ones and then were
imagining everything being something when they were older ones.
Some are talking very much and very often about being one being
imagining in being one being living. Some are very convincing in
being one telling about being one being imagining in being living.
Sometime each one has been telling very much and very often what
that one is thinking about that one being one being imagining in
living, being one talking in living, being one listening in living,
being one succeeding in living, being one failing in living.
Sometime each one has been telling very much and very often about
living having been, about living being in that one.</p>

<p>Some have been doing something very often, they have been doing
that thing very much and very often and yet they are not then
knowing being in being one doing that thing, that is to say some
one may be one living all the living of that one doing some one
thing again and again with many men and many women and this one
then has not been learning anything about how to be one doing that
thing. Some one might be one ruining many men and many women
certainly was one ruining one and certainly then that one might be
one not knowing anything about ruining about not ruining any one,
might be one certainly not knowing anything about ruining men and
women, might certainly be one not knowing anything of being being
in men and women who are who are not ruined by that one, in short
it is sometimes surprising how some are not being ones having had
experience in being ones doing something when they have been ones
doing something. Some have been ones doing something and really
then they have not very often done that thing. It is surprising
very often how some who have been ones doing something have been
ones very rarely doing that thing, and some who have been ones
doing something have been doing that thing very often.</p>

<p>Every one certainly is telling very much and very often
everything in being one being living and some are listening to some
and some are listening to many and some are not doing very much
listening and some are listening more and then are listening less
and some are talking more and some are talking less and each one is
one being living and then each one is one going on being living all
the time that one is one being living, and each one is sometime a
young one and each one is sometime quite a young one.</p>

<p>Some are jumping when they are young ones, jumping from a place
and are landing way below from where they were jumping and it is a
pretty thing to see them doing, and many of them when they are
doing this thing are not hurting themselves in landing. Certainly
very many when they are young ones are jumping a long distance and
are landing somewhere and to some of such of them it is not an
important thing at all to be knowing where they are going to be
landing when they are beginning jumping. Some are certain that not
any one is such a one when they are a young one, some are certain
that every one when they are jumping even when they are quite young
ones have it that it is to them an important thing to be certain
that they can be landing safely somewhere below the place from
which they have been jumping. Some are certain that mostly every
one when they are young ones are ones jumping and not being ones
being interested in knowing that they will be landing somewhere and
not be ones having been hurt by jumping. Some are quite certain
that being young ones is being in some way in being living, some
are quite certain that being young ones is in some one way of being
in being living and in others another way of being in being living.
Some are quite certain that there are some ways in being living
that every one being a young one has then in that one. Some are
certain that this is not a true thing. Some are certain that not
any one being a young one, having been a young one has been then
one saying a certain thing, some are quite certain that mostly
every one having been a young one is one then not saying a certain
thing. Each one being in being living having been a young one is
remembering, is not remembering having been being then. Some are
certain that not any one is remembering very much in having been a
young one, some are certain that every one is remembering very much
in having been a young one. Some are certain that they are
remembering completely having been a young one and then some one
who was a young one too then is remembering and that then makes it
to the first one that that one really is not at all remembering
being living in being a young one. Sometimes this is a pleasant
thing, sometimes it is a thing indifferent to that one, sometimes
it is a thing making that one feel a feeling of being one having
been existing without having been one going on in being one being
living. Some are not listening to other ones remembering being a
young one, some are listening very often to other ones remembering
being a young one. Each one being living is certainly one having
been one going on being living. Many when they are being young ones
are talking very much and very often, many when they are being
young ones are ones going on being living, many when they are being
young ones are sometimes ones not going on being living. Many when
they are young ones are being ones going on being living and they
are then remembering this thing and they are then forgetting this
thing and they are sometimes ones telling something about being
ones not going on being living. Some are certainly not remembering
being ones being young ones, some are certainly remembering and
very clearly remembering and remembering completely being young
ones in being living. Many are quite certain they are remembering
being young ones in being living. Many are completely certain they
are not remembering being young ones in being living. Some are
remembering some one being a young one in being living, some are
not remembering any one being a young one in being living.</p>

<p>David Hersland in the beginning of his being living was being a
young one. There were others then being young ones. Some had then
one way of being in being young ones and others had then other ways
of being in being young ones and David Hersland was a young one
then and later some of them remembered their being in being young
ones then and some did not remember much of their being in being
young ones then. David Hersland remembered some of them being in
being young ones then, something of some of them, a little
something of being a young one then, certainly something of being
being in him when he was being a young one and sometimes he was one
quite certainly remembering being in being a young one and
sometimes he was one quite certainly not remembering being in him
as being in him in being a young one. Certainly some are
remembering better than others being young ones in being
living.</p>

<p>There are such very different ways of feeling any one being a
dead one and any one being a living one at different times in being
one being living. Certainly to very many being living when they are
being young ones being a dead one is a thing that is a thing a
little terrifying, not very exciting, quite interesting, not
happening, certainly not happening. To some it is a thing
completely terrifying when they are young ones, certainly not
happening, certainly not interesting, certainly very often being a
thing that one is a good deal remembering. To some when they are
young ones it is a thing happening, it is a thing terrifying them,
it is a thing mostly forgotten, it is a thing quite interesting. To
some it is a thing completely forgotten, quite interesting, not
happening, might be quite terrifying. To some it is a thing, when
they are young ones, needing to be then completely forgotten,
sometimes then completely desolating, sometimes then making in that
one that that one is wanting to be certain that it is something not
happening, is something not happening, is something that that one
is finding interesting, is something that that one is then a good
deal forgetting. In a way David Hersland was such a kind of
one.</p>

<p>Some when they are being young ones are certainly not certain
that anything is not existing and then they certainly are certain
that not anything is existing and then they are wanting to be
needing that anything being that anything not being existing is a
thing completely interesting to them and then it is not really at
all then completely interesting to them and these are ones being
ones going on being living some of them and David Hersland was one
of such of them.</p>

<p>Certainly there are very many who being young ones are not
certain about anything being existing, anything being not existing
and are sometimes feeling completely in them about such a thing.
There are some who when they are young ones are not certain about
anything being existing, about anything being not existing and are
not feeling anything at all in them about any such thing. Certainly
some when they are young ones are quite certain that everything is
existing, certainly some when they are young ones are wanting to be
needing to be quite certain that not anything is existing. There
are certainly very many going on being living when they are young
ones, a very great many being young ones are being then ones going
on being living. Some are certainly then and later remembering
having been ones then going on being living, certainly some then
and later are not remembering having been then ones going on being
living. Some are remembering then when they are young ones going on
being living are remembering it then that they are young ones going
on being living and then later are forgetting that they were
remembering this thing when they were young ones. David Hersland
might have been one of such of them.</p>

<p>There are a very great many being young ones and there are a
great many having been being young ones. David Hersland knew some
who were being young ones and he was a young one then, David
Hersland knew some being young ones and he was not really being a
young one then. There certainly have been and are being very many
being young ones. Each one has their own way of having it in them
being a young one when that one is being a young one.</p>

<p>Certainly some are ones having been young ones and ones then
having been talking very much and jumping very much and being then
being ones almost completely ones certain then that they were ones
completely feeling being ones talking and being ones jumping. Very
many certainly are not when they are young ones feeling themselves
to be completely ones then jumping then talking. Some are ones
certainly not altogether completely then, when they are young ones,
feeling themselves then in being being ones jumping then, being
ones talking then, being ones then completely jumping and talking.
Very many later are remembering themselves having been ones feeling
themselves being completely one jumping completely one talking when
they were young ones. Some are certainly being ones when they are
young ones doing very much jumping doing very much talking then
when they are young ones, some of such of them are certainly then
feeling themselves to be ones pretty nearly completely ones being
ones talking being ones jumping, some of such of them are certainly
then not completely then feeling themselves ones being completely
ones being jumping, completely ones being talking. Certainly very
many when they are being young ones are ones then talking then and
jumping then and certainly some of such of them are ones certainly
feeling themselves being completely then ones talking, ones
jumping. Some and certainly some of them are ones that are not ones
anybody would be thinking were feeling themselves being such ones
are ones not feeling themselves at all being ones completely
jumping completely talking when they were being young ones. In a
way Hersland was such a kind of a one. In a way he was one
certainly not one completely feeling being one jumping being one
talking when lie was being a young one. In a way he was very nearly
completely feeling himself being one being talking being one being
jumping when he was being a young one. Certainly he was quite a
good deal one being one feeling being completely one jumping
completely one talking then when he was a young one. Each one
certainly is one being a young one when that one is one beginning
being living. Some are remembering being one beginning being
living, some are not remembering being one beginning being living.
Some are ones who might be remembering and were and some are ones
who might be remembering and were not. In a way David Hersland was
one of such of them. In a way he was one who might have been
remembering he was a young one and very much he was one not
remembering. He certainly was one knowing very many when he was a
young one many who were then being ones being young ones. Some are
saying some one looks like some one and then some other one says
yes and then they are both laughing and then they are telling
another one about this thing and they are all then laughing and
laughing and they keep on then for a very long time laughing and
beginning telling one another about this thing and sometimes then
they are not telling one another about this thing and sometimes
they are not then telling some other one about this thing but
certainly then they can be, they are laughing then. Some are
telling that some one is like some one and that one telling that
thing has angry feeling and is getting having more and more angry
feeling in telling this thing while the one that one is telling
this thing is certainly not saying that this one is finding a
resemblance that is convincing to this one. Sometimes some are
beginning telling about something and then certainly a number are
saying something and certainly very many of them are having then
angry feeling and they are then talking and talking and talking and
telling that thing and every minute each one of them is having
angry feeling. Certainly some are talking each one about a thing
and each one is having angry feeling and they are ones going to be
playing something then and certainly mostly each one of them is
talking then and certainly mostly each one of them is having angry
feeling in them and perhaps it is quite exciting to all of them
then and perhaps it is not really exciting to most of them then.
Certainly some are talking very long times and quite often and
another one is with them and is talking very long times and quite
often and another one and another one is with them and each one of
them is certainly talking very long times and quite often.
Certainly each one being living is beginning being living and
certainly some of such of them are doing these things in being ones
being then being living.</p>

<p>David Hersland was one being one beginning being living and
there were others then being ones beginning being living and they
sometimes were with each other then and sometimes some were with
some then and others were with others then. Certainly each one
every one being living is being one sometime beginning being living
and this is in different ways in them in each one ever living. To
some certainly not any one is ever a young one. To some not anyone
is certainly to themselves inside them a young one. Some are
certain that not any one is ever to themselves inside them a young
one. Some are doubting whether any one is to themselves inside them
to themselves then a young one. Some are certain that no one is
ever to themselves inside them a young one. Certainly not any one
is being to themselves a young one inside them to some. Certainly
any one is being to themselves a young one inside them to some. To
some, certainly not any one is ever a young one. To some certainly
every one is sometime a young one. To some every one is sometimes a
young one. Certainly each one has a way of feeling about young
being, about beginning being living in that one, in every one.
There are certainly very different ways of feeling about being
young ones, about anybody being a young one, about that one being a
young one, about anybody having been a young one, about that one
having been a young one.</p>

<p>Certainly each one is beginning being living when they are
beginning being ones being living. Certainly some are not to
themselves in being living being young ones. Certainly some are to
themselves in a way in being living young ones. Some perhaps are to
themselves in being living in the beginning Of being living really
being young ones. Each one ever living is certainly sometime
beginning being in living. There are certainly many ways of being
to oneself in being one beginning being living. To some certainly
not any one is ever a young one. Certainly not any one is one being
to themselves a young one inside them to some. To some certainly
not any one is ever a young one. Certainly each one is one
beginning being living. Certainly not every one is to themselves
inside them then one beginning being living. Not every one is one
to themselves inside them having been beginning being living.
Certainly in a way David Hersland was such a one, he certainly in a
way was such a one one certain in a way that not any one is ever a
young one. He was one in a way not ever to himself inside him one
being a young one. Certainly there are very many being ones and
always there are very many of them and very many of them are such
of them are ones being certain then that not any one is ever a
young one, being certain then that one is not then a young one,
being certain then that one is not one having been a young one.
David Hersland was one being once beginning being in living. There
were very many then being ones beginning being in living, some of
them were in a way young ones then inside them to them, some of
them were not in a way young ones then inside them to them.</p>

<p>Being one needing to be listening to some one is being in some
when they are young ones, when they are older ones, when they are
middle aged ones, when they are old ones. Being one needing to be
listening to some one is what very many being in living are being
in being one being living. Certainly very many are ones needing to
be listening to some one to be ones certain to themselves to be
ones going on being living, going to be going on being living. Some
are needing being one listening to some one while they are young
ones, while they are older ones, while they are beginning being in
middle living and then they are ones listening to some one and some
of such of them are then ones not needing to be listening to some
one. Some are needing some one to be very convincing in being one
to whom they are listening. Some are certainly needing this thing
very much in being one being living. Some are needing this thing
sometimes in being one being living. Some are needing this thing
and are needing it again and again. Some are not needing this thing
but it is certainly a comforting thing to them to be having this
thing. Some are having this thing and it is a comforting thing to
them and they are wanting to be needing this thing. Some are
wanting to be needing this thing and they are almost needing this
thing. Some are wanting not to be needing this thing. Some are
having some one being a convincing one to whom they are listening
and it is then almost a comforting thing to them and they are then
ones wanting to be needing this thing and then it is coming to be
in them that they are not having this thing. In a way David
Hersland was one of such of them, in a way it was something he was
having and it was then in a way a comforting thing to him and then
in a way he was wanting to be needing this thing and then in a way
he was certain not to be having any more of this thing and of their
being some one being convincing to whom he was listening. When he
was a young one he was almost knowing that he was wanting to be
needing this thing, when he was an older one he was knowing that he
was having this thing and having it again and again, when he was
older he was knowing that he was wanting to be needing this thing
and that certainly he was not going to be having anything of this
thing and perhaps he was then going to be completely needing this
thing and perhaps he was going to be then not at all needing this
thing, and then he did not go on being one being living. Certainly
he was one being living when he was being a young one, he was often
then quite certainly one being almost completely interested in
being one being living, he was then quite often wanting to be one
being completely interested in being one being living, he was then
one quite often almost completely interested in being one being
living. He certainly then went on being living, he did this thing
certainly all of his being living in being in young living. He
certainly when he was a young one was needing then sometimes to be
sure that he was one being living, this is certainly what some
being living are needing when they are ones being young ones in
being living. David Hersland certainly was one almost completely
one being living when he was being a young one. Some he was knowing
then were certainly being completely living then and being then
being young ones in being living. Some he was knowing then were not
quite completely being ones being living then, some were quite a
good deal not being ones being completely living then when they
were being young ones in being living. David Hersland did a good
deal of living in being living then when he was a young one. He was
knowing very many then and very many knew him then. He remembered
some of them in his later living and he did not remember some of
them. He certainly was one almost completely then interested in
being one being living then.</p>

<p>Certainly every one being living is being one going on being
living and some are then knowing that thing and some are then not
knowing that thing and some are remembering doing that thing and
some are not remembering having been doing that thing having been
going on being living. Certainly every one being living is one
going on being living, certainly very many are not remembering
having been doing that thing, certainly very many are remembering
having been being doing that thing. Certainly every one living is
one going on being living, certainly every one having been living
is one having been going on being living. Certainly every one being
living is one going on being living. Some are doing some things
then, some are not doing some things then, some are enjoying some
things then, some are not enjoying some things then. Some are
certainly needing to be ones knowing they are being ones going on
being living, are needing to be doing some things that are things
that are making them be feeling that they are being ones going on
being living by being, things that any one is needing to be one
going on being living, that is breathing and breathing and
breathing. There are very many such of them always being existing,
there are very many certainly knowing then that they are ones going
on being living then when they are doing more breathing than just
breathing in being living. Very many are doing very much breathing
to be ones knowing they are going on being living, very many are
certain to be ones going on being living when they have been
regularly doing more breathing than breathing to be being living.
Some certainly are liking very much being living doing this thing.
Quite a number are liking very much being living doing this thing
being ones knowing then being one going on being living.</p>

<p>To some certainly every one is always a young one. To some
certainly some one is almost always a young one. Certainly any one
being living is then one going on being living. Certainly some are
breathing more than they are always breathing and certainly some of
such of them are ones knowing then that they are ones going on
being living. Some are knowing they are ones going on being living
when they are young ones, some are not knowing they are ones going
on being living when they are young ones, some are ones not knowing
it then when they are ones going on being living in being young
ones, some are ones knowing it then when they are young ones
knowing that they are ones going on being living then.</p>

<p>Some when they are being young ones are liking being ones going
on being living, some when they are being young ones are not liking
it being ones going on being living. Certainly some are then
wanting to be liking being one going on being living, some are
certainly then not wanting to be liking being one going on being
living, certainly going on being living. David Hersland was
sometimes not liking being one going on being living, he certainly
was one sometimes, almost always, liking being one going on being
living then. He certainly was one going on being living then, he
certainly was sometimes knowing this thing then, he certainly was
sometimes almost knowing this thing then. He was doing some things
then and some others were doing some things then and he was doing
some things and some others were doing the things he was wanting to
be needing to be doing then, and he was doing some things then, and
he was doing some things he was needing to be doing then and some
others did things then when he was doing things, and some were
doing things then and he was going to be doing things then, and he
was doing things then and some others were doing things then and
some others were going to be doing things then, and some were doing
things and he was doing things and some others were doing things
and he was going to be doing things and he was needing to be doing
things and he was doing things and he was wanting to be doing
things and he was doing things and some others were doing things
and some others were going to be doing things and some others were
wanting to be doing things and some others were doing things and
some others were needing to be doing things and some others were
doing things and some others were doing things. Certainly some when
they are ones being dreaming and they are young ones then and ones
being dreaming then are ones then not dreaming then about anything.
There are certainly some being young ones and ones being dreaming
then and they are then not being ones dreaming then about anything.
There are some being ones being dreaming and they are young ones
then and some of them are ones dreaming then about something,
certainly some of them who are ones being one being dreaming and
being ones being then young ones are ones dreaming then about
something. Some certainly are ones being dreaming when they are
ones being young ones and some of such of them are ones being ones
not dreaming then of anything and some are ones certainly some of
them are ones dreaming of something. Some when they are being ones
being young ones are ones sometimes then being ones being dreaming
and some of such of them are ones dreaming then of something,
sometimes when they are then ones dreaming then and sometimes are
ones not dreaming of anything when they are ones being young ones
and being sometimes then ones being dreaming.</p>

<p>One is doing something and then doing that thing again and then
doing another thing and then doing that thing again and then doing
the one thing and then the other thing and that one certainly would
be doing some other thing and doing that thing again and would be
then doing another thing and would be doing that thing again and
would then be doing the one thing and then would be doing the other
if that one were not doing the things that one is doing in being
one being living. Certainly some are doing something and doing that
thing and doing another thing and certainly some are completely
ones needing to be ones doing that thing and that thing again and
then some other thing and then that other thing again and then one
thing and then another and then another thing to be ones being
being ones living. Certainly some are doing something and are doing
it again and are doing another thing and are doing it again and are
doing the one thing and are doing the other thing and are
completely wanting to be needing to be doing the one thing and the
other thing to be one being living. There are some that certainly
are almost completely wanting that they should be ones needing to
be one doing one thing, to be one doing that thing again, to be one
doing another thing, to be one doing that again, to be one doing
the one thing and the other thing, to be one needing doing the one
thing and the other thing to be one being living. There are some
who are almost completely wanting that they should be one who is
one that is needing being one doing the one thing and doing it
again and doing another thing and doing it again and doing the one
thing and the other thing to be one being living. Certainly each
one being living is doing something and doing another thing and the
one thing again and the other thing again and the one thing and the
other thing and something and that thing again and something. Each
one being living is one being one doing something and doing it
again and another thing and something and another thing and doing
something and doing another thing again. Each one being living is
one doing something and doing that thing and another thing and that
thing and another thing and another thing and that thing and
another thing and another thing again. Certainly each one living is
one in some way doing something, doing another thing, in some way
needing doing something, doing another thing, in some way wanting
to be needing doing something, doing another thing, doing another
thing and doing something again and another thing again and another
thing again. Some are certainly needing to be ones doing something
and they are doing one thing and doing it again and again and again
and again and they are doing another thing and they are doing it
again and again and again and they are doing another thing and they
are doing it again and again and again and such a one might have
been one doing a very different thing then and doing another very
different thing then and doing another very different thing then
and doing that then each or any one of them and doing it again and
again and again. Certainly some are ones being living and are ones
being ones doing something and doing it very well in doing it again
and again and again. Certainly some are ones being living and are
ones doing something and doing it well and not doing it well in
doing it again and again and again and again. Certainly some are
ones being and are ones doing something and are ones doing it quite
well and are ones doing it quite well in doing it again and are
ones doing it again and again. Some are ones being living and doing
something and are doing that thing and are doing some other thing
and are doing some other thing and certainly they are then doing
some other thing and certainly they are doing each thing and hardly
any one is doing anything better than such a one is doing anything.
There are some being living and they are doing something and they
are doing that thing and they are going on doing that thing and
then they are not any longer doing that thing. Some are quite doing
something in being living. Some are being living and are quite
steadily and completely doing something. Some are being living and
they are then doing something and they are then doing that thing
again. Some are being living and certainly they are ones doing
something and are then ones being living. Certainly each one being
living is one in some way doing something in some way being living
to some in being one doing something, is in some way being living
inside that one in being one doing something, is in some way
needing being being living, is in some way needing being doing
something, is in some way wanting to be needing being doing
something. Each one being living is one doing something and doing
it again and doing some other thing and doing it again and doing
the one thing and doing the other thing and doing another thing and
doing one thing and the other thing and doing another thing and
doing it again. Certainly some are ones completely being living to
themselves inside them. Some of such of them are ones being ones
doing some thing and another thing and doing the one thing and the
other thing and doing them again and doing them again and doing
them again and again. Certainly some are ones completely being
living and they are this thing to themselves then, they are this
thing to some other one, they are ones being completely living in
being ones being living and doing something and another thing and
another thing and doing some of them again and again and again and
again. Certainly some are ones being ones completely being living
and when they are ones being living and are ones being completely
living in doing something and doing that thing again and doing
some, other thing and doing that thing again and again and again
and being one doing such a thing again and doing some other such
thing and doing it again and again and again and again and being
one being one completely living and being such a one to every one,
certainly to any one knowing that one, knowing anything of that
one.</p>

<p>There are some when they are being living and when they are
beginning being living are ones completely being living and are
ones completely being living to themselves then and to mostly every
one and are ones being completely being living doing many things
and doing them, most of them, very often. There certainly are some
being living who are ones certainly being ones completely being
living and are such ones and any one can be completely certain of
this thing being one knowing such a one, being one knowing any one
knowing such a one. Certainly there are very many being completely
living in being living and are such to any one and are ones doing
some thing and another and another thing and doing one again and
again and again and doing the other thing again and again and doing
the other thing again and again and again. Certainly there are some
being ones completely being living in being living and doing
something and doing it again and again and doing another thing of
the same kind of thing and doing it again and being one being
completely living in being one being living. Certainly some are
ones completely being living in being living and are such ones to
any one, to every one and certainly there are ones being living not
being ones completely living that is not to some knowing them
knowing of them and some of such of them are ones certainly doing
something and certainly doing another thing of the same kind and
another one of the same kind and doing each one of them very much
and very often and again and again and again and again. Certainly
some are ones being ones completely being living to themselves in
being living and some knowing them are certain that this is not
being in them in some, of such of them that they are ones being
completely living in being living. There certainly are ones who are
ones not being completely living in being living to themselves then
and some are certainly certain that some of such of them are ones
being completely being living in being living and some are
certainly certain that some of such of them are not ones being
completely living in being living. Certainly each one being living
is beginning being living and some are then knowing this thing and
some are not then knowing this thing, those being in being
beginning being living. Some who are beginning being living are
then knowing that thing. Some who are beginning being living are
then not knowing that thing. Some beginning being living are almost
then knowing that thing. Certainly some beginning being living are
quite certainly not knowing anything at all of any such thing being
in being living. Certainly there are many ways of being ones being
completely living in being living, being ones not completely living
in being living. There are certainly many ways of being ones
completely being living in being young ones, there are certainly
many ways of being ones not completely being living in being young
ones. When one is a young one one is a young one. Certainly when
one is a young one one is then a young one. In a way one is knowing
then that one is not then a young one, in a way one is knowing it
then that one is then a young one. When one is a middle aged one
one is then a middle aged one. In a way one is knowing then that
one is then a middle aged one, in a way one is knowing then that
one is not then a middle aged one. When one is an old one one is
then an old one. In a way one is knowing then that one is then an
old one, in a way one is knowing then that one is not then an old
one. When one is a young one one is a young one. Certainly when one
is a young one one is then a young one. In a way one is knowing
then that one is then a young one, in a way one is knowing then
that one is not then a young one. When one is an older one one is
then an older one. One is then in a way knowing then that one is
then an older one, one is then in a way knowing then that one is
not then an older one.</p>

<p>When one is a young one one is a young one. When one is a young
one one is certainly then in a way a young one. When one is a young
one one is certainly in a way then not a young one. When one is a
young one one is a young one. One is a young one and is then in
some ways then not a young one. One is a young one and is in some
ways then a young one.</p>

<p>One is a young one and one is knowing in some way that one is a
young one. One is a young one and one is knowing in some way that
one is not a young one.</p>

<p>One is a young one and is knowing that one is not a young one
and is knowing that one is a young one. One is an older one and is
knowing that one is an older one and is knowing that one is not an
older one. One is a middle aged one and is knowing that one is a
middle aged one and is knowing that one is not a middle aged one.
One is an older one and is knowing that one is a middle aged one
and is knowing that one is not a middle aged one. One is an older
one and is knowing that one is not an older one and is knowing that
one is an old one. One is an old one and is knowing one is an old
one and is knowing that one is not an old one. One is an older one
and is not knowing one is an older one and is knowing one is an
older one. One is a very old one and one is knowing one is a very
old one and is not knowing one is a very old one. One is an older
one and is knowing one is an older one and is not knowing one is an
older one. One is a young one and one is and one is not knowing one
is a young one. One is a young one and one is knowing one is not a
young one and one is knowing that one is a young one. One is a
young one and is then knowing that one is a young one and is then
knowing that one is not a young one.</p>

<p>One is a young one and is knowing and is not knowing then that
that one is then a young one. One is a young one and is knowing
then that that one is not a young one, is knowing then that that
one is then a young one.</p>

<p>David Hersland was a young one, he was knowing he was then a
young one, he was knowing that he was then not a young one. He knew
some who were young ones then. Some of them were knowing then that
they were young ones then and knowing then that they were not young
ones then. Every one is doing something in being a young one in
being living. Some are jumping and some are then not jumping very
much and some are not jumping well enough then so that they are
interested in doing that thing, and some are jumping then and it is
an extraordinary thing that they can do that thing so wonderfully,
the thing they are doing then, the jumping they are doing then.
Some are jumping then and mostly not any one is jumping a longer
distance than they are jumping. Some are jumping and they go on
jumping and it is certainly very satisfying to be one then jumping.
Some are jumping and certainly it is a very wonderful thing the
jumping they are doing. Some are jumping and anybody would be
satisfied with jumping in such a way unless they were ones jumping
in quite a different way. Some are ones jumping very well and it is
quite interesting being jumping then and certainly not any one
would not be an interested one in being one jumping in the way
these are jumping, David Hersland was one of such of them.
Certainly he was jumping and jumping very well and jumping quite
often. Some when they are jumping are wonderfully jumping. David
Hersland knew some of such of them. Every one is doing something in
being a young one in being living. Very many are jumping then and
David Hersland was jumping then and he jumped very well and was
quite interested in jumping then. Some jump quite wonderfully when
they are jumping. Some are interested in such jumping, some are
wanting to be doing such jumping. David Hersland was interested in
such jumping, he was almost wanting to be doing such jumping. He
jumped very well when he was one doing jumping, he was not feeling
very much about wanting to be doing wonderful jumping. He did
extremely good jumping when he was one doing jumping.</p>

<p>Every one is doing something in being a young one in being
living. Mostly every one is doing something when they are being one
being young ones. Certainly jumping is doing something. Some are
doing a good deal of jumping when they are young ones. Some are
doing then very wonderful jumping. Some are jumping very well then.
David Hersland jumped very well then. Each one when that one is a
young one is knowing then that that one is a young one, is knowing
then that that one is not a young one, each one when that one is a
young one is not knowing then that that one is then a young one, is
not knowing then that that one is then a young one. Some when they
are young ones are knowing then very well that every one is certain
to be sometime a young one. Some when they are young ones are
feeling that they are then completely knowing this thing. In a way
they are completely then knowing this thing, in a way they are not
completely then knowing this thing. Some are certainly when they
are young ones not in any way completely knowing the thing that
every one is sometime a dead one. Very many are in some way knowing
this thing that every one is sometime being a dead one, very many
are knowing something of this thing when they are being young in
being living. Very many are not knowing very much about every one
being a young one, very many when they are young ones are not then
knowing very much about this thing. Very many are not knowing very
much about every one being a dead one, very many when they are
young ones are not then knowing very much about, this thing.
Certainly David Hersland in a way knew almost completely then when
he was a young one that every one would sometime be a dead one, in
a way he did not at all completely know about this thing about
every one coming to be sometime a dead one, then when he was being
a young one in being living. There were very many being young ones
in being living then when David Hersland was being a young one in
being living. David Hersland knew some who were being young ones
when he was being a young one, he knew some of them and he was with
some of them some of the time then and he did some things with some
of them and he did not do some things with some of them and he
certainly talked enough then with some of them and he did not talk
very much to some of them and he was going to talk some with some
of them and he certainly would have liked sometimes not to have
talked much with some of them, but mostly he talked a good deal
with a good many of them and he mostly always could have talked
more with most of them and certainly he did not talk to some and he
would have liked to have talked to them but mostly he talked a good
deal with a good many of them and he did things with some of them
and he was being young in his living when others were being young
in their living and he knew a good many of such of them and he did
some things with them and he talked some with them and he certainly
did know some of them being young ones in their living when he was
being a young one in his living.</p>

<p>Some do not do things very much with others who are being young
ones in living when they are being young ones in being. Some do
very much do things with others who are being young ones in living
when they are being young ones in being living. David Hersland did
things a good deal with some who were being young ones in being
living when he was a young one in being living, he did not do some
things with any one who were being young ones in being living when
he was a young one in being living.</p>

<p>Certainly every one who is being is being living. Certainly some
are certain that in being living they are ones feeling that being
living is some thing. Certainly some being living are feeling that
being living is something. Certainly very many in being living are
feeling that being living is something. Very many are feeling that
being living is a thing making of them ones being existing. Some
are feeling that being living is a thing not making of them ones
being existing. Certainly being existing is something very many are
feeling in being ones being living. Certainly very many are very
often doing something, certainly very many are going on living for
quite a long time. Certainly very many are always feeling
themselves then being existing. Certainly very many are certain
that being existing is something. Certainly some are sometimes
feeling that being existing is almost not something. Certainly some
are sometimes feeling that being existing is not something.
Certainly quite a number being living are feeling that being
existing is not anything. Certainly a very great number are feeling
that being existing is something. Certainly David Hersland was
sometimes feeling that being existing is something. Certainly David
Hersland was sometimes feeling that being living is not something.
Some are quite certain that being existing is not anything. David
Hersland was almost certain of this thing that being existing is
not anything. Some are certain that being existing is something.
Certainly David Hersland could be almost being certain of this
thing that being existing is something. David Hersland when he was
a young one could be feeling that he was completely certain that
being existing is not anything. David Hersland when he was a young
one was feeling that he was as nearly certain, as any one could be
who was not completely certain, that being existing is not
anything. David Hersland was feeling when he was a young one that
he might come to be certain that being existing is not anything.
David Hersland was certain then when he was a young one that being
existing is not anything, and he was completely certain of this
thing, and he was as completely certain of this thing as any one
can be who is not completely certain of this thing, David Hersland
was almost completely certain of this thing then when he was a
young one certainly almost completely certain that being existing
is not anything. He was completely certain of this thing that he
was feeling this thing that being existing is not anything. He was
almost completely certain of this thing that being living is not
anything. He was completely certain of this thing that being
existing is not anything. He was almost completely certain of this
thing that being existing is not anything. He was completely
certain of this thing that being existing is not anything. He was
almost completely certain that being existing is something, he was
almost completely certain of this thing then when he was a young
one, he was almost completely certain that being existing is
something, he was completely certain that he was feeling completely
feeling that being existing is something, he was completely certain
that being living is something, he was almost completely certain
that being living is something, he was almost certain, when he was
a young one, that being existing is something, he was completely
certain then of this thing that being existing is something, then
when he was a young one. He was feeling certain, then when he was a
young one, that he was almost certain of this thing that being
existing is something, he was feeling certain then when he was a
young one that he was almost certain of this thing that being
existing is not anything. He was one being living and he was one
feeling something about being existing. Very many are ones being
living and very many of them are ones feeling something about being
existing. Very many are ones feeling something about existing, when
they are young ones. Very many are being living and all of them are
being young ones in being living and some of them are ones feeling
something about being existing. Feeling something about being one
being existing is in very many being living. Feeling something
about being existing was in David Hersland in being one being
living.</p>

<p>Some are wanting to know about some one whether that one is a
young one or is an older one. It is an important thing to know that
of some one. That one being a young one is in a way one being one
kind of a one and that one being an older one is then in a way not
that kind of a one. Some one is being one being living and that one
is then a young one. That one is a kind of a one. That one being
that kind of a one is being one living in a certain way, thinking
and doing in a certain way and that one is one certainly doing that
in a way one way being a young one and in a way in a different way
being an older one. It is an important thing to be knowing of that
one, of any one whether that one is then a young one or an older
one. Some are knowing about some one that that one is an older one
and that one is not then an older one, that one is then in the very
beginning of the middle living of that one and not in the middle of
the middle living of that one. Perhaps that then is the reason that
one is doing something in the way that one is doing it then.
Perhaps that is not the reason that that one is doing that thing
the way that one is doing that thing then. Perhaps that one will be
doing that thing that way in the ending of the middle of the living
in that one. Perhaps that one will not Be doing that thing in that
way at the ending of the middle of the middle living in that one.
Certainly I am asking each one how old that one is just then.
Certainly I am doing this thing. David Hersland was a young one in
the ending of the beginning of the ending of young living and he
certainly was then one that some were needing to be asking how old
he was then and certainly some were thinking then that he was as
old as he was then and certainly some were thinking then that he
was older than he was then. Certainly he was at the beginning of
the ending of young being in him then and he certainly was knowing
quite a number who were being living then and some were young ones
who were younger than he was then and some were ones who were as
old as he was then and some some were ones who were older ones than
he was then. He had been knowing very many all his living and some
were older ones than he was then and some were younger ones than he
was then and some were just as old as he was then. Certainly all
his living he knew quite a number who were being living and quite a
number knew him. Sometimes in his being living he was not knowing
so many who were being living and not very many knew him. Sometimes
in his living he knew quite a number who were living. Sometimes in
his living he did not know very many who were living. Sometimes in
his living very many knew him. Sometimes in his living there were
not very many who knew him.</p>

<p>Sometimes, to some one, knowing anybody in being living is to
that one something really existing. Sometimes, to some one, knowing
somebody is to that one a thing that in a way is not really
existing. Sometimes some one is wondering about this thing.
Sometimes that one is not wondering about that thing. Certainly
some are not ever wondering about such a thing. Certainly some are
knowing somebody and that thing is existing. Certainly there are
some who are doing this thing. Certainly some are knowing somebody
and that thing is not existing. Certainly there are some who are
doing this thing.</p>

<p>David Hersland was certainly one having all of such ways of
being being in him. He certainly was one knowing some one and that
thing being existing to him, he certainly was one knowing some one
and that thing being not existing to him. He certainly was one
knowing some one and that thing being sometimes being sometimes not
existing to him. He certainly was one wondering about such a thing.
He was certainly one not wondering about such a thing. He certainly
was one being existing inside him to him, he was certainly one
being not existing inside him to him. He was certainly one
wondering about such a thing. He was certainly one not wondering
about such a thing. Certainly sometimes he knew a number of people
being living and he knew some of them in some way and he did not
know some of them in that way and he was then knowing some in that
way some of those he had been knowing in that way and he was not
knowing some then in that way some of those he had been knowing in
that way and he was knowing then some of those in that way some of
those he had not been knowing in that way. He certainly sometimes
in being living knew quite a number of ones being living. He
certainly sometimes in being living did not know very many being
living. He certainly was one having ways of knowing ones in him,
and certainly he was sometimes having very many ways of knowing
ones being in him. He certainly had very many ways of knowing ones
being in him and certainly sometimes in being living he was knowing
very many being living and certainly sometimes in being living he
was not knowing very many being living. He was one wondering about
knowing ones in being living, he certainly was one wondering quite
often about being one knowing ones being living.</p>

<p>The way some other one is not frightened by something, the way
some other one is frightened by something makes some one, make some
almost certain that not any one is existing. The way some other one
is frightened by something, the way some other one is not
frightened by something makes some wonder whether they are
realising being being in any one. Some other one being frightened
by some one, some other not being frightened by some one makes some
feel uncertain whether they are themselves being living. Some other
one being frightened, some other one not being frightened by
something, by some one make some certain that that other one is not
understanding anything. Some certainly are not believing another
one who is then a frightened one, who is then not a frightened one.
Some are explaining to some one who is not a frightened one by some
thing that that one is not understanding what a thing it is the
thing that is not frightening that one. Some are certainly then
completely being astonished ones in realising that that one who is
not frightened by one thing is frightened by another thing which is
certainly not a dangerous thing and the other thing is a dangerous
thing and why should any one be frightened by anything that is not
a dangerous thing and why should any one not be frightened by
anything that is a dangerous thing. Some certainty are frightened
by some things that are not pleasant things, some certainly are
frightened by some things that are dreary things, some certainly
are frightened by things that are dangerous things, some certainly
are frightened by things that are dirty things, some certainly are
frightened by things that are lively things, some certainly are
frightened by things that are quick things, some certainly are ones
being frightened by things because those things are slow
things.</p>

<p>David Hersland was one all his living learning to be believing
that what frightened some one did frighten that one, that what did
not frighten some one did not frighten that one. David Hersland
certainly was one all his living trying to be learning to be one
believing this thing believing that what frightened some one did
frighten that one, that what did not frighten some one did not
frighten that one. He was sometimes being one, in trying to be
learning this thing, one who was certain that not any one is being
existing. He was sometimes one certain that what was frightening
that one was not frightening that one, that what was not
frightening that one was frightening that one. He was explaining
very often that he was not believing that what was frightening some
one was frightening that one, that what was not frightening that
one was not frightening that one. Certainly he was one trying to be
one learning to be believing that what was frightening any one was
frightening that one, that what was not frightening some one was
not frightening that one.</p>

<p>He was in his living sometimes knowing very many who were
living. Sometimes in his living very many who were being living
knew him. He knew quite a number who were being living when he was
a young one then when he was a young one.</p>

<p>Some one was not having angry feeling when he was asking why any
one is doing anything. This one did not have angry feeling when
some one was explaining that each one did the thing that each one
was doing so as to be satisfying the wanting to do that thing that
each one had then inside in them. Some are wanting to be asking why
each one is doing the thing each one is doing and have not any
angry feeling in asking this thing. Some one was explaining that
each one doing anything, certainly some of them, were doing that
thing to satisfy the feeling of wanting to be doing that thing.
Some one was asking what was the use in doing anything and the one
asking this thing did not have any angry feeling when that one
asked that thing. Some one was explaining that the use of doing a
thing was to be satisfying the need any one had to be doing that
thing and this explanation did not give to the one receiving this
explanation any angry feeling, it did not give to that one any
satisfied feeling, it did not give to that one any sad feeling, it
did not give to that one any angry feeling. Some are not having any
angry feeling when they are asking why any one is doing anything.
Some are not having any angry feeling when they are asking why each
one is doing the thing each one is doing. Some are not having any
angry feeling when some one is giving an explanation of why each
one is doing what each one is doing. Some are not having any angry
feeling when some one is explaining why any one is doing anything.
Some are not having any angry feeling when some one is explaining
that each one is doing what each one is doing and is in some way
completely explaining that thing, some are not then having any
angry feeling, some are not then having any satisfaction, some of
such of them are not then having any sad feeling, some of such of
them had been then perhaps expecting to be having some
satisfaction, some of such of them are not having any weary
feeling, some of such of them are not having then disappointed
feeling, some of such of them are not then having any excited
feeling, some of such of them are not then not asking why each one
is doing what each one is doing, some of such of them are not then
having any angry feeling.</p>

<p>Some are explaining that each one is doing the thing each one is
doing because they are needing to be doing that thing, because they
are needing to be wanting to be doing that thing, because doing
that thing is a thing that is feeding them, because doing that
thing is a thing that they are needing to be doing so that they can
be ones doing something that they are ones needing to be wanting to
be doing, because doing that thing is a thing that is something any
one will be doing who is one needing to be one doing some things
that this one is needing to be doing, because doing that thing is a
thing in some way satisfying that one as being the one being that
one. Some having some one explaining each one being one doing what
each one is doing are not having then any angry feeling. Some of
such of them are explaining that exchanging anything is a
completely pleasant thing and they are not exchanging anything just
then, some of such of them are explaining that exchanging anything
is a completely pleasant thing and they are exchanging a good deal
just then, some of such of them are not having in them any angry
feeling, some of such of them are asking then why each one is doing
what each one is doing, some of such of them are hearing some then
explaining that thing, some of such of them have not in them then
any angry feeling.</p>

<p>In a way David Hersland was one not completely asking why each
one is doing what each one is doing. In a way David Hersland was
not ever completely explaining why each one is doing what each one
is doing. In a way he did have angry feeling in him in asking, in
listening, in explaining, this thing, certainly he did very nearly
did not have angry feeling in him about any of this thing.
Certainly he might have been one completely asking about this thing
about why each one is doing what each one is doing. He might have
been one certainly he might have been one completely explaining
this thing why each one is doing what each one is doing. He was not
ever completely asking this thing, he was not ever completely
explaining this thing. He might have been one having completely
angry feeling in asking, in explaining, in having explanations of
this thing, he certainly was not ever completely angry in asking
about this thing, in explaining, in hearing some one explaining
this thing. He was one who certainly might have been one completely
asking about each one doing the thing each one is doing, he was one
who certainly might have been one completely explaining each one
doing what each one is doing.</p>

<p>David Hersland was not completely asking himself, asking any one
why each one is doing what each one is doing. Sometimes he was
almost completely asking this thing. He might have been one
sometime completely asking this thing. He might not have been
sometime completely asking this thing. He was not ever really
completely asking this thing. He certainly might easily be
thinking, any one might easily be certain about it about him when
he was living that he was one completely asking this thing. He
certainly was not completely asking this thing. He certainly was
not ever completely explaining why every one is doing what each one
is doing in being living. He might have been one explaining this
thing, he might have been one not explaining this thing. Certainly
many were certain that he was one having been being, going to be
being explaining this thing. He could be one needing wanting to be
explaining this thing. He was not ever completely needing wanting
to be explaining this thing. He was not then ever really in living
completely explaining why each one is doing what each one is doing
in being living.</p>

<p>He certainly might have been one completely listening to any one
explaining this thing why each one is doing what each one is doing.
He was pretty nearly completely listening to any one who was one
explaining this thing. He was then one sometimes explaining
something. He was then sometimes wanting to be needing being one
completely explaining everything. He was then sometimes almost
completely needing wanting to be one explaining everything. He
certainly listened very much and very often and certainly he very
nearly completely listened when he listened to very many who were
explaining everything. Certainly he was one who was listening, who
was explaining, who was asking, who was answering in being one
being living. He was one certainly completely clearly feeling a
good deal in being one being living. He certainly was one clearly
thinking. He certainly was one pretty nearly completely explaining
everything. He certainly was one pretty nearly completely asking
about each one being one doing the things each one is doing. He was
a young one and he was an older one and he was a little older then
and then he was not any longer living. He certainly sometimes then
was knowing very many who were living then. He certainly sometimes
then was known by some who were living then. He certainly was one
who was in a way completely clearly feeling some things. He
certainly was one who was in a way very completely clearly
thinking. He was in a way one pretty nearly completely needing to
be wanting to be completely asking about each one being the one
that one is in being living. He was one certainly wanting to be
needing to be certain that somethings being existing are beautiful
things being existing. He was one certainly not in a way completely
feeling such a thing. He was in a way completely clearly feeling
what he was feeling. He was one certainly not completely explaining
everything. He was one certainly not completely asking about each
one being the one that one is in being living. He was one feeling
some things clearly feeling some things. He was one knowing some
very well in being one being living. He was one who was doing some
things. He was one clearly thinking in being living. He was one
listening and talking and asking and answering. He was one, and
certainly some were certain of this thing, he was one clearly
feeling, clearly thinking, completely clearly feeling, completely
clearly thinking some things, and he was then feeling and listening
and talking and asking and answering and almost completely then
needing to be sometime explaining everything. He was not ever
really completely needing to be explaining everything. He was not
ever completely explaining everything. He might have been one
completely explaining everything. He might not have been one
completely explaining everything. He was one and certainly there
were some who were certain of this thing, he was one almost
completely listening to any one who was explaining everything. He
was one and he certainly was that to some he was one not in a way
completely listening to any one explaining everything. He was one
who certainly to some was very nearly explaining everything. He was
not one explaining everything. He was not completely needing to be
such a one.</p>

<p>To be young, to be older, to be middle aged, to be older, to be
old, each one is a way of being and each one means something to
each one being living. In a way being young means something to
every one and it is not the same thing. One is a young one that is
to say that one is in the beginning of being living, that is to say
that one is not yet a middle aged, is not yet beginning to be a
middle aged one. That one is thinking, is feeling about being being
in that one, that one is telling about that thing. That one is
doing something and is thinking about that thing. That one is not
then to that one one being a young one that is to say that one is
not then to that one, one beginning being living, that one is then
to that one one being living one being one doing something and
thinking about that thing, one being one thinking, one being one
feeling, one helping some one to be one doing something, one
realising the way some other one should begin doing something, one
telling some one how that one should go on doing something. This
one then is in a way not a young one that is to say this one is in
a way not one being one being beginning in being living. This one
in a way is a young one, that is to say this one is one not feeling
something, not thinking something, not being in being living one
being what that one will be being when that one is an older one.
That one is then in a way a young one and is in a way beginning
being living and this is then in this one, and this one is one not
then having that thing in that one that is being a young one, is
not then having that thing in that one as something that one is
needing to be one deciding anything, to be one directing some other
one, to be one working and feeling and thinking, and that one is
then a young one and this is in that one as being and that is then
making that one be the one that one is then in being living.</p>

<p>David Hersland was such a one in being a young one, he certainly
was then one being one not needing it to be a young one to be one
being then living, to be one being then working and thinking and
feeling and directing some and deciding anything. He was then a
young one and being then a young one made it that he was one being
existing as being one doing anything, feeling anything, thinking
anything, deciding anything, directing anything in the way that he
was then doing such a thing, then when he was a young one.</p>

<p>Some are needing themselves being a young one, an older one, a
middle aged one, and older one, an old one to be ones realising
what any one telling about different ways of feeling anything, of
thinking about anything, of doing anything is meaning by what that
one is telling. Some are needing themselves being a young one, an
older one, a middle aged one, an older one, an old one to be one
being certain that it is a different thing inside in one being a
young one, from being an older one, from being a middle aged one,
from being an older one, from being an old one. Some are needing
themselves being different ages in being living to be realising
that each one is different in being one being feeling, in being one
being thinking, in being one doing anything, in being one deciding
anything, in being one directing anything in being a young one, in
being an older one, in being a middle aged one, in being an older
one, in being an old one.</p>

<p>David Hersland was such a one. David Hersland was needing being
at different ages in being living to be realising the different
ways any one can be thinking, feeling, doing at different times in
being living, in being a young one, an older one, a middle aged
one, an older one, an old one, a very old one.</p>

<p>Some are needing being at different ages in being living to be
to themselves one doing something, thinking some thing, feeling
something, directing some, deciding something. David Hersland was
such a one. Some are needing being at different ages in being
living so that they can be realising that each one is feeling
differently, is thinking differently, is doing anything
differently, is deciding differently, is directing anything or any
one differently at different ages in their being living. David
Hersland was such a one.</p>

<p>David Hersland was a young one and he was then thinking and
feeling and doing some things and deciding some things and
directing some things and directing some whom he knew then,
directing some of them in doing things, directing some of them in
thinking things, directing some of them in feeling things. He was
directing some then in thinking about some things, he was directing
some then in their feeling about some things. He was deciding some
things then and deciding some things then for some who were knowing
him just then. He was one then being living all his living. He was
one being one being living to himself inside him almost all of his
being living.</p>

<p>He was one being a young one, David Hersland was in a way being
a young one when he was a young one when he was in the beginning of
his being living. He was one being a young one in a way being a
young one when he was a young one. He was experiencing then, in a
way he was experiencing then being a young one, in a way he was not
experiencing then being a young one. He was a young one when he was
in the beginning of his being living and in a way he was then
experiencing that thing. He was a young one when he was beginning
being living and in a way he was not then experiencing that thing.
In a way he was not then a young one then when he was in the
beginning of his being living and he was then experiencing that
thing experiencing being not then a young one. He was in a way not
a young one then when he was in the beginning of his being one
being living and he was in a way then not experiencing that thing
experiencing being then not a young one.</p>

<p>He was one experiencing being one being living all of his being
living. He was experiencing being at some age in being living in
all of his being living.</p>

<p>He was one experiencing being living then when he was a young
one. He was one experiencing being a young one then when he was a
young one, he was one experiencing not being a young one then when
he was a young one.</p>

<p>He was one experiencing living being in him, he was one
experiencing living being in some when he was knowing them who were
knowing him then when he was a young one. He was experiencing in
them their being a young one some who were then being young ones,
he was experiencing in them their not being young ones some who
were then young ones. He was experiencing being not young ones in
some who were not then young ones. He was experiencing then some
being young ones in some who were not then young ones. He was
experiencing living then when he was a young one, he was
experiencing being living then. He was experiencing being living
all his living, he was experiencing living all his living.</p>

one having very much feeling in being one being living. He was
sometimes certain of this thing. He was sometimes certain that he
was not living in being one having very much feeling in being
living. He was sometimes certain of this thing. When he was in

<p>Understanding being in some one makes the one understanding the
being in some one come very nearly to telling that one the one
whose being is being understood by the one understanding the being
of some one makes that one come sometimes very near to telling the
one whose being that one is understanding that that one will
certainly never be doing the thing that that one is needing to be
one going on being living. Some one is understanding the being in
some one. That one might be telling that one the one whose being
that one is understanding that that one will never be doing the
thing that one is needing to be doing to be one really going on
being living. Some one is understanding the being in that one.
Certainly that one whose being is being understood then is one not
going to be doing the thing that one is needing to be doing to be
one going on being really living. The one understanding the being
in the other one might be telling that one this thing. The one
understanding the being in the other one is very nearly telling
that one this thing. The one understanding the being in the other
one is certainly not telling the other one this thing. The one
understanding the being in the other one is knowing that that one
will never be telling the other one anything about this thing. The
one understanding the being in another one and understanding then
that that one will not ever be doing the thing that one is needing
to be doing to be one being to that one inside that one one going
on being living, is telling the one that one is understanding is
telling that one this thing that that one will not ever be doing
the thing that one is needing to be doing to be one going on, to
that one inside that one, one going on being living. Certainly some
one to whom some one understanding the being in that one has been
telling that thing is not ever completely forgetting that thing, is
not ever completely forgetting that that one will be one not going
on being living, not really going on being living.</p>

<p>Some one understanding some one and being certain that that one
will not be doing the thing that one is needing to be really one
going on being living, is certainly hoping that some other one
understanding that one will not ever tell that thing to the one
certainly not going to be doing the thing that one is needing to be
one going on living. That one is not telling that thing. Certainly
that one did not ever tell that one that thing, did not ever tell
that one that that one would never be doing the thing that one was
needing to be doing to be one really going on being living.</p>

<p>Some one is understanding some one sometime and that one is then
certain that the one that one is then understanding is one
certainly not going to be doing the thing that one is needing to be
doing to be one really going on being living. Perhaps that one the
one not going to be doing the thing that one is needing to be doing
to be one going on being living would be wanting to have the one
understanding that one tell about understanding that one. The one
understanding the other one is telling that one about being one not
going to be doing the thing that one is needing to be doing to be
one really going on being living. The one being pretty nearly
certain then that the other one understanding the being in him is
really telling what will be happening that is that that one will
not ever be doing the thing that one is needing to be doing to be
one really going on being living, is sometimes almost forgetting
this thing that this one will not be doing what this one is needing
to be doing to be one really going on being living.</p>

<p>Some one understanding being in some one is certain not ever to
be telling that one that that one will not ever be doing the thing
that one is needing to be doing to be one going on living. Some one
understanding some one is telling that one and explaining that
thing completely explaining that thing that that one that that one
is understanding is one certainly not going to be one doing the
thing that one is needing to be doing to be one going on being
really living. That one the one not going to be doing the thing
that one is needing to be one going on being living is completely
understanding the explanation of that thing that the one
understanding that one has been giving.</p>

<p>Some one is certain that the one that one is understanding then
is one that will certainly not be doing the thing that one is
needing to be doing to be one going on really being living. That
one the one the other one is understanding is one certainly not
going to be doing the thing that one is needing to be doing to be
one really going on being living. The one understanding the one not
going to be one doing the thing that one is needing to be one going
on being living is not mentioning this thing to that one. The one,
the other one is understanding, the one who is not going to be
doing the thing that one is needing to be doing to be one going on
being living is sometimes quite certain that that one will be
surprising the one who is understanding the being in that one.</p>

<p>David Hersland was understanding the being in some one and was
telling that one then about this thing about understanding the
being in that one. Some one was understanding the being in David
Hersland and was not telling him about this thing was not telling

about that one not understanding the being in him. Some one was
understanding something of the being in David Hersland and was
asking some one who was not understanding the being in Hersland to
explain that thing, the not understanding in the one not
understanding, the understanding in the one understanding
something.</p>

<p>One not understanding the being in David Hersland was asking
every one knowing that one to explain that one not being one
understanding the being in Hersland. Some one understanding the
being in David Hersland was explaining that some one was
understanding some of the being in David Hersland and that that one
was one who was not needing any more explaining for certainly that
one needed that David Hersland was not needing any more explaining.
Some one was understanding the being in David Hersland and this was
one needing that some other one was not understanding the being in
David Hersland. One was understanding something of the being in
David Hersland and was sometime telling about this thing that that
one had been understanding something of the being in David Hersland
and that one was then forgetting this thing forgetting the
understanding of the being in David Hersland. Some one was not
understanding the being in David Hersland and was not ever

Hersland and was explaining this thing explaining understanding the
being in David Hersland to every one understanding the being in
David Hersland. Some one was understanding the being in David
Hersland and was sometimes explaining this thing, sometimes
explaining the being in David Hersland. David Hersland was the son
born of his mother Fanny Hersland after Martha Hersland, Alfred
Hersland and two who did not come to be ones going on being living
were born out of her. He was the son of Fanny Hersland and her
husband David Hersland. David the son was something like his mother
and something like his father. He was something like his sister
Martha, he was something like his brother. He was different, quite
different from his mother and his father and his sister and his
brother. He was remembering in his being living that the one who
was his mother and the one who was his father and the one who was
his brother and the one who was his sister was his mother, was his
father, was his brother, was his sister. He was not remembering in
his being living sometimes he was not remembering anything about
any one being his mother, any one being his father, any one being
his sister, any one being his brother. He was living the living
each one in the Hersland family was living when the Hersland family
was living their family living. He was living a living not any
other one in the Hersland family living was living when the
Hersland family was living the Hersland family living.</p>

<p>He was one needing to be one being living to himself inside him
and to be one sometimes having some be certain of this thing be
certain that he was one being living to himself inside him. He was
one needing to be one being living to himself inside him and to be
one sometimes having every one not knowing anything of any such a
thing being in him of his being one being living to himself inside
him.</p>

<p>He was one being living to himself inside him and some were
knowing this thing, they were not mentioning this thing, they were
not remembering this thing, they were knowing this thing and he was
one to them living in being living and not then knowing them in
being one being living with them. He was one being living in being
one being living to himself inside him and he was not remembering
this thing and he was knowing this thing and sometimes he was
certain that some were knowing him in knowing this thing and
sometimes he was certain that some were not knowing him in knowing
this thing. He was sometimes certain that he was knowing some he

one being living inside him. He was one being quite certain that he
was not knowing any one knowing him he being one knowing inside him
that he was one being living to himself inside him.</p>

<p>Surely he said some things and did some things that some said he
said and did. David did some things alone when he was a young one,
some things he did not do alone when he was a young one. Some are
knowing some one, are hearing that one say some things, are knowing
that that one is doing some things and it is then when that one is
telling some other one what that one has been hearing what that one
has been knowing that some other one is a surprised one. Surely
some one is saying the things that some other one is hearing that
one saying, certainly that one is saying those things, only it
happens that some other one never happens to be one hearing any one
saying such things.</p>

<p>Surely David Hersland was saying some things, was doing some
things that some said he said and did. Surely he was saying some
things and some said he said such things and some were certain that
he had not said any such thing and some were wondering about his
saying such a thing, and some were wondering if some are saying the
things some are saying they are saying, and some are certain that
some are saying some things and some are ones not being ones
hearing such things. Surely David Hersland said some things and did
some things that some said he said and some said he did. Certainly
some knowing him were wondering if he had been saying some things
he had been saying, certainly some knowing him were wondering if he

<p>When he was a young one he did some things alone and when he was

things that he was certainly wondering, when some one was telling
that he had been doing, that he was wondering if he had been ever
doing any such a thing. Certainly he was saying some things and
certainly when some said such things to him as things he had been
saying he did not recognise them as a thing he could ever have been
saying. Certainly some are doing the things and are saying the
things some are saying they did, some are saying they said.
Certainly David Hersland did some things some said he did, and said
some things some said he said. Sometimes some one knowing some one
is saying that that one said something and it is something that
would astonish some to believe that one was saying and surely that
one had been saying that thing because the one telling about the
thing was one certainly not one having it to be one thinking any
such thing, hearing any such thing from any other one. Sometimes it
is very astonishing to some knowing some one to be knowing
everything that that one they are knowing is saying, everything
that one they are knowing is doing. Certainly it is very often
astonishing to some one when that one comes to be knowing what some
one that one is knowing has been saying. Certainly each one is
saying very much in being one being living. Certainly something
some one has been saying is astonishing to some one when that one
comes to be hearing that that one has been saying that thing.</p>

<p>Surely each one certainly did some things and said some things
that some said he did and said. Certainly it is astonishing to some
one hearing that some one has said something that that one has
said. Certainly it is astonishing to some one knowing that some one
did some thing that that one did. Each one is doing some things in
being one being living. Some are knowing such a one, any one. Some
are knowing what this one is saying in being living, what some one
is saying is believing is some times hearing some other thing that
this one has been saying that some one has been saying, and then
the one knowing this one is wondering whether the one did say such
a thing and then sometimes is one finding it to be very astonishing
that the one is one saying such things and then some time is one
hearing the one saying such things and then is one not then
astonished at knowing the one as being one saying such things in
being one being living.</p>

<p>Certainly each one in being one being living is saying some
things, is doing some things. Certainly each one knowing any one is
hearing some of the things that one is saying. Certainly each one
knowing some one is hearing some things that that one has been
saying to some other one knowing that one. This is sometimes
something that astonishes the other one the one then hearing what
the one that one is knowing has been saying to the other one.</p>

<p>David Hersland said some things in being one being living and
some heard him saying some things and some repeated what he had
been saying. Sometimes he was not certain that he had, that he had
not been saying some things he was hearing then, sometimes he was
certain that he had not been saying any such thing and sometimes he
had been and sometimes he had not been saying the things he was
certain he had not been saying. He said some things and sometimes
he was certain that they were not things he could have been saying
but he was not certain that they were not things he had been
saying. He was one saying some things in being one being living.
Some certainly were certain that they had been hearing every kind
of thing he was saying in being one being living. Some of such of
them had been hearing every kind of thing he could be saying. Some
of such of them had not been hearing every kind of thing he had
been saying. Some of such of them were sometimes wondering about
such a thing about not having heard every kind of thing he was
saying.</p>

<p>David Hersland said some things when he was a young one, said a
good many things when he was a young one and some heard very many
things he said then and some heard very few of the things he said
then. Some were certain that they heard very many of the things he
said then when he was a young one and some were certain that they
heard every kind of thing he said then when he was a young one.</p>

<p>Certainly David Hersland said some things then when he was a
young one that some said he said then. He knew that he had said
some of them. He did not know whether be had said some of them. He
knew he did not say some of them. He did say some he knew he did
not say, some he knew he did say, some he did not know whether he
did or whether he did not say, he did say some he knew he could not
say, he could not have said as they were not the kind of things he
did say. He did not say some of the things he knew he did not say
the kind of things he could not say because they were the kind of
things he did not say.</p>

<p>Each one in being living is saying things, is doing things.
David Hersland in being living was doing things, was saying things.
When he was a young one he did some things alone, when he was a
young one he did not do some things alone. When he was a young one
he said some things and some heard the things he said, and he said
some things and some did not hear the things he said. Some told
some other ones some things he said and astonished them. Some told
some other ones that he did not say some things and that astonished
them. Certainly he said some things in being one being living then
when he was a young one, certainly he said some things that some
said he said, certainly he said some things that some said he had
not said. Certainly some are saying some things to some one
listening and it is quite astonishing that they should say that
thing and it is not at all astonishing that they should say that
thing. Certainly sometimes they are astonished at having been
saying that thing and certainly sometimes they are not astonished
at having been saying that thing. Certainly sometimes some are
astonished at that one having been saying such a thing. Certainly
sometimes some are wondering about that one having been saying such
a thing. Certainly some are not ever believing that that one has
been saying such a thing. Certainly some are certain that that one
is one often saying such a thing. Certainly some are saying that it
is a very simple thing that that one is saying such a thing.
Certainly some are wondering if he will ever say such a thing again
the thing the one said to some one who was listening.</p>

<p>Certainly when one is a young one some one is hearing that one
saying something that not any one else is hearing that one saying
and very often that one is telling some other one that the one said
that thing and is telling that thing and pleasantly and simply
telling that thing and the one hearing that thing hearing that the
one was saying such a thing is wondering if the one was saying that
thing or whether the one telling that the one was saying that thing
is simply and pleasantly imagining that the one was saying that
thing.</p>

<p>It certainly is astonishing that each one is saying all the
things each one really has been saying. It certainly is astonishing
that any one can be saying so many kinds of things so many things
as every one is saying in being living. This is astonishing to
some, interesting to some, exciting to some, simple to some,
doubtful to some.</p>

and was out of breath then from having been running and would then
just ask him how he was and had not then just then any other thing
to say to him. David Hersland had been a quite young one and then
he was not a very young one he was coming then to the ending of the
beginning being living. He was then knowing a good many men and
women, some were then ones at the end of their beginning being
living, some were then a little older, some of them were then a
little younger, some were then a good deal older than he was then.
When some one ran after him and was quite breathless then and said
how do you do, to him then and had not anything more to say just
then, not anything more then to say to him he was quite certain
that such a one was a silly one. He was certain then that that one
was an affectionate one, one satisfied then with having been
running, with having been saying how do you do, then, with having
nothing more just then to say to him. He was certain that one being
such a one was a silly one and one running after every one that one
saw whom that one was knowing. He was certain that one running
after him and being breathless then and saying how do you do to him
then and having just then not any other thing to say to him was a
completely silly one.</p>

<p>He was being one, David Hersland was being existing and
sometimes some one ran after him and was breathless then and tired
then and shook hands with him then and was more tired then and had
not anything to say to him just then, certainly had not anything to
say to him just then. He was certain that that one was a silly one,
he was completely certain that that one was completely a silly one.
David Hersland was one certainly in a way needing to be certain
that every woman was in a way a beautiful thing. Certainly not any
woman was in a way a beautiful thing to him. He was completely
needing that every woman is a beautiful thing. Certainly he was
completely realising that affection is a thing that is in one
wanting to be seeing another one. Certainly he was not completely
wanting to be seeing any woman who is existing. Certainly he was
one realising affection being in any woman completely wanting to be
seeing some one. Certainly he was one completely needing realising
that any woman is a beautiful thing. He was one realising, that
affection being in some one, that one is one wanting to be seeing
some one. He was one needing to be completely wanting to be seeing
some one. Certainly some one sometimes ran after him and certainly
asked him then how he was and was one not having any other thing
just then to say to him. He certainly was one realising that
affection is something making some one be one completely wanting to
be seeing another one. Certainly this one was one running after him
and being breathless then and saying how do you do to him and being
tired then and not having anything just then to say to him.
Certainly this one was one doing this quite often. Certainly this
one was one doing this thing, running after them, after some men,
after some women, and saying how do you do to them, and being
breathless then and having just then not any other thing to say to
any one of them.</p>

<p>David Hersland was certainly one knowing some men and some women
while he was being one being living. Certainly some men and some
women knew him while he was being living. When he was quite a young
one he knew some and some knew him, and when he was not such a
young one he knew some and some knew him and when he was an older
one he knew some and some knew him, and when he was a little older
still he knew some and some knew him.</p>

<p>There are very many people being living. Certainly very many
come together to see something, to hear something, to do something,
to see some see something, to see some hear something, to see some
do something, to hear some see something, to hear some do
something, to hear some hear something, to feel something, to feel

very many are being living. Very many are telling about this thing
that very many are being living. Certainly very many are being
living. Certainly very many are very willing that very many be
being living.</p>

<p>Very often very many who are being living come together and they
are together then and very many are very willing that very many
should be doing this thing should be coming together and very many
are not very willing that very many should come together and very
many are in some way telling about this thing about very many
coming together and certainly very many are together and certainly
very many very many are being living.</p>

<p>Certainly very many are living, certainly very many are

this thing about very many being together and very many are willing
that very many are telling about this thing about very many being
together and very many are not very willing and very many are not
at all willing that very many are telling about very many being
together.</p>

<p>It certainly is in some ways a very nice thing very many being
together, it certainly is in some ways not a very nice thing very
many being together. It certainly is in some ways a cheerful thing
very many being living, it certainly is in some ways not at all a
cheerful thing very many being living. David Hersland was certainly
one who was all his living feeling something about this thing,
about very many being living, feeling something about this thing
about very many being together, he was one in a way all his living
feeling something, thinking something, realising something about
this thing about very many being together, about this thing about
very many being living, pretty nearly all his living, very nearly
in every part of his living he was feeling something, he was
thinking something, he was realising something about very many
being together, about very many being living.</p>

<p>Certainly very many are together. Certainly very many are
living. Certainly very many are telling something about this thing
about very many being living. Certainly very many are telling
something about this thing about very many being together.</p>

<p>David Hersland was one being living and this is now a history of
his being one being living, this is to be now a history of being
living being in him, of his being one being living.</p>

<p>Certainly very many are being living, very many are dying, very
many are commencing existing. Very many are seriously living. Very
many are not so seriously living. Very many are not so seriously
living.</p>

<p>Very many are being living. Some are saying thank you to some
one, some are not saying thank you to any one. In a way David Hers
and was not saying thank you to any one, in a way David Hersland
was not not saying thank you to any one.</p>

<p>Certainly very many are being existing, very many are dying,
very many are commencing being existing.</p>

<p>Certainly David Hersland was being existing, certainly David
Hersland was dying, certainly David Hersland was commencing being
existing.</p>

<p>He was commencing being existing, he was going on being
existing. He was going on being existing, he was not going on being
existing.</p>

<p>If any one is sad enough then that one is certainly one wanting
to be a sad one, is certainly one not wanting to be a sad one. If
any one is not sad enough then that one is liking being a sad one,
is not liking being a sad one.</p>

<p>David Hersland was not sad enough and he was liking being a sad
one and he was not liking being a sad one. He was sad enough and he
was certainly wanting then to be a sad one, he was certainly then
not wanting to be one being a sad one.</p>

<p>All his living he was a sad enough one. All his living he was
one wanting to be a sad enough one. All his living he was one
wanting not to be a sad enough one. All his living he was not sad
enough and he was not liking this thing not liking not being a sad
enough one and all his living he was liking this thing liking being
a not sad enough one.</p>

<p>Some are sad enough, certainly they are sad enough. Some are not
sad enough, certainly they are not sad enough. Some certainly would
be sad enough if they could be sad enough. Some certainly would be
sad enough if they could be sad enough.</p>

<p>Some would be sad enough if they could be sad enough. Some of
such of them are sad enough. Some of such of them are not sad
enough.</p>

<p>David Hersland would not be sad enough if he could be sad
enough. David Hersland was sad enough. David Hersland was not sad
enough. David Hersland was pretty nearly sad enough. David Hersland
could be sad enough. He could not be sad enough. He could be sad
enough. He certainly was pretty nearly sad enough. He was sad

knew very many who were being living while he was being living.
Very many who were being living knew David Hersland. Very many are
being living. A very great many are always being living.</p>

<p>Sadness in himself and others was certainly interesting to him
in being one being living. Sadness in himself was certainly
interesting to him. David Hersland was certainly interested in
sadness being existing, he was interested in sadness being in him,
he was interested in sadness being in every one. He was interested
in sadness being existing. When he was a young one he was
interested in sadness being existing, he was interested in sadness
being in him. All his being living he was interested in sadness
being existing, in sadness being in him, in sadness being in every
one, in sadness being in any one.</p>

<p>All his living he was interested in not being certain that
sadness is existing. All his living he was interested in not being
certain that sadness was existing in him. All his living he was
interested in not being certain that sadness is existing in every
one. All his living he was interested in not being certain that
sadness was existing in some one.</p>

<p>When he was a young one he was interested in being certain that
sadness was existing in him. When he was being a young one he was
interested in not being certain that sadness was existing in him.
All his living he was interested in sadness being existing. All his
living he was interested in sadness not being existing. All his
living he was not certain that any sadness is existing. All his
living he was certain that sadness is existing.</p>

<p>He was a young one and he was being living and he was quite
completely living then, sometimes he was quite completely living,
certainly he was sometimes quite completely living then. Certainly
he was then, when he was a young one, not certain that sadness is
being existing, certainly he was then when he was a young one
certain that sadness is being existing.</p>

<p>He was not a sad one, in a way then when he was being a young
one he was not a sad one, he was a sad one, in a way then when he
was being a young one he was a sad one. Then when he was a young
one he was interested in being not certain that sadness is
existing. Then when he was a young one he was interested in being
certain that sadness is existing.</p>

<p>Ways of being living is something some are knowing are existing
and some are not knowing are existing. Some are knowing they are
living in a way of being living. Some are not knowing they are
living in a way of being living. Some are knowing they are living
in a way of being living are knowing this thing when they are young
ones, when they are beginning being ones being living. David
Hersland was not one of such of them. Some are never in their being
living are never knowing they are living in a way of being living.
David Hersland was not one of such of them. Certainly very many
being living are not ever knowing they are being living in a way of
being living. Some are knowing they are living in a way of being
living. Some when they are beginning being ones being living are
ones knowing they are living in a way of being living. David
Hersland when he was a young one was not one knowing then that he
was living in a way of being living. He was one for sometime not
interested in such a thing. He was one for sometime not interested
in ways of being living. He was one certainly not ever completely
interested in any such thing, in ways of being living. He was
sometime almost interested in such a thing in ways of being living.
He was not ever really completely interested in ways in being
living. He was quite interested in being interested in ways of
being living. Sometime he was quite interested in being interested
in ways of being living. He was not one really knowing then when he
was a young one about ways of being living. Certainly some are
really knowing about this thing about ways of being living.
Certainly some are not really knowing about this thing about ways
of being living.</p>

<p>David Hersland was being living and sometimes he was with very
many who were being living and sometimes he was not with very many.
He knew some who really knew about ways of being living. He knew
some who really did not know about ways of being living.</p>

<p>Little by little they are not so young those being young. Little
by little they are not so young and they are then so young, they
are then quite young. They are then young those who are young.
Little by little they are not so young those being young.</p>

<p>Those being young little by little are not so young. They are
young. They are not so young. They are then still quite young.
Little by little they are not so young. They are still then quite
young. Little by little then they are not so young. They are young
then.</p>

<p>One is in the beginning of being living. One is then going on
being living. Little by little each one is not so young. One is
still then young. Little by little one is not so young. Quickly one
is not so young, quite quickly one is not so young. One is then
still young. One is then not any longer young. One was young and
then that one was older and then that one was not at all a very
young one and then that one was not at all a young one and then
that one was quite not a young one. If one had been beginning
knowing that one when that one was this one one being quite not a
young one that one would have been one to such a one one being
quite a young one and then would have been for some time longer
then quite a young one.</p>

<p>One is a young one a completely young one, one just beginning
being living and this one little by little is not such a young one
and is one then to one knowing that one not such a young one, and
to one just beginning knowing that one a completely young one.</p>

<p>One was a young one and this one had been one being a young
enough one so that some one could toss that one, toss up that one
and one did toss up that one, did regularly toss up that one and
then this one was one that that one could not toss up any longer
and this one then the one that had been a tossed one had then to
toss himself to earn a living and this one was then a quite young
one and this one was then to the one that had tossed that one a
completely not a young one, a young one was one that could be
tossed by that one and this one could not be tossed by this one and
this one did not toss himself enough to be another kind of a young
one, a young one who tossed himself and he was not a young one
because he could not toss himself again and again and certainly
this one was to that one to himself inside him completely a young
one, completely not a young one.</p>

<p>A young one is one tossing himself and not with a rhythm, not
with a regular rhythm, one who is not a young one is one tossing
himself with a rhythm, some rhythm, is tossing himself with a
regularity that has meaning as a repeated thing and this is
certainly the way one not being a young one is tossing himself and
the way one being a young one is not tossing himself.</p>

<p>One who is tossing himself pretty nearly regularly would have
been one who was not completely a young one but he was completely a
young one and that was because there were older ones who had been
ones tossing themselves regularly and this one knew then that this
was the way that one should toss himself and that one then did not
toss himself so then and always when this one was tossing himself
as regularly as they had been tossing themselves they were tossing
themselves more regularly, so that that one to himself then and to
every one was a young one, a completely young one, quite a young
one one who was not tossing himself with any regular rhythm, was
then a quite completely young one.</p>

<p>Little by little they are not so young those being young. It is
certainly steadily changing and certainly in each one they are each
one a little and a little a different one that is one being an
older one, one being not such a young one.</p>

<p>One is thinking and he is thinking quite the same thing he has
been thinking since he commenced thinking and always and always it
is a little older, a little different and a little different and it
is a very pleasant thing to some to see in any one, to see in
themselves little growing difference in them and then it is like a
map of anything, one is finding that the real thing is like the
description. That is very exciting and very depressing and very
contenting and very disconcerting and very expected and very
astonishing and some then are certain that it is not existing in
every one and some are certain that it is existing in every one.
And some in some part of their being living are seeing changing in
men and women and in other parts of their living are not seeing
changes happening.</p>

<p>Some one quite in the middle of the middle living in that one is
meeting some one who is at the ending of the beginning living in
that one and is then struck by the changing in that one and that
one is then struck by the changing in the other one and each one is
then knowing that every one is changing some.</p>

<p>Some are beginning seeing changing in every one when they are in
the ending of the beginning of their middle living. Some who are in
the ending of the beginning of their middle living are then seeing
changing existing in every one who is being living. Some all their
living are seeing changing in every one, are feeling changing to be
existing in every one.</p>

<p>David Hersland was realising all his living that changing is
existing in every one and he was not really feeling this thing,
really seeing this thing until the middle of the beginning of his
middle living and then he was loving this thing and looking at each
one and thinking about this thing and living in this thing, and
being a little frightened by this thing and being contented by this
thing and being convinced of this thing and telling it to himself
about each one he was knowing and being certain that being living
was a thing being existing and being then almost completely certain
of this thing. He was then one who came to be a dead one at the
beginning of the middle of his middle living and he had been one
who had been almost completely fully living in changing being
existing in every one being living. He had been completely almost
completely feeling each one being an older and an older one. He had
been one almost completely seeing being a young one and being then
a little and a little not such a young one. He was one certainly
needing to be one realising changing being existing. He was one
completely enjoying seeing changing being existing in each one. He
was one almost completely being satisfied with being living in
being one seeing changing happening in each one. He was one being a
young one and then he was knowing some who were young ones quite
young ones and not such young ones and older ones and quite old
ones and certainly he sometimes was feeling changing being existing
but not very much then certainly not very much then because he was
then being a young one and not going fast enough then in being
living to be certain that anything was changing in the being in any
one. He was knowing that changing is existing, any one could be
knowing that thing, he was not living in that thing, not at all
then living in that thing, not any one to him was then really
living in that thing. He was a completely young one then, he knew
quite a number who were living then.</p>

<p>David was a boy when he was a young one. That was a natural
thing. He was a boy then, he was not a boy to himself then, he was
a boy to himself then, he was one being existing to himself then,
he was one not being existing to himself then. He was a boy to very
many knowing him then. He was not a boy to some knowing him then.
He was some one being existing to those knowing him then. Certainly
he was not certain not always certain then that he was one being
one feeling something. He was quite often quite certain that some
being existing are ones being existing in feeling something. He was
quite often certain that very many who are being existing are then
feeling something. He was one quite clearly feeling what he was
feeling. He was one sometimes quite certain he was not one ever
feeling and he was one who was quite certain that he was one who
was one feeling enough to be a sad one and not feeling enough to
have feeling being a thing that was being in him. He was one
certainly quite clearly feeling feeling being existing. Certainly
he was one quite clearly feeling something about some things and he
was one almost being certain that feeling is existing in some who
are existing, and then he came to be one going on being living and
he came sometime to be quite certain he was very clearly feeling
what he was feeling.</p>

<p>He was one beginning living and then he was one feeling
something and he was then one not feeling anything and he was then
a quite sad one and he was then not at all a sad one, a quite not
sad one. He was then a troubled one and he was then troubled with
this thing with being a troubled one and he was wondering then
about any one being a troubled one and he was then not always
certain about anything about this thing about being a trouble one.
He was a troubled enough one, he was not then completely interested
in this thing in being a troubled one, he was quite certain that he
would be sometime interested in this thing in any one being a
troubled one. He was in a way a troubled one and in a way he was
one deciding then quite clearly deciding about any one whom he knew
was a troubled one. He was one quite clearly deciding about each
one who was a troubled one. He was a troubled one and in a way he
was quite clearly deciding about himself then, about himself being
a troubled one, and he was not then completely interested in this
thing in any one being a troubled one, in he himself being a
troubled one but he was certain that sometime he would be
completely interested in this thing completely interested in being
a troubled one, completely interested in every one being a troubled
one. He was not ever completely interested in this thing, in any
one being a troubled one, in himself being a troubled one, he was
sometime and for quite sometime troubled by this thing, he was then
not troubled by this thing for certainly then he was clearly
certain that any one is a troubled one, that every one is a
troubled one, that he himself was a troubled one and he was clearly
feeling about this thing and he was clearly thinking about this
thing and he was then not completely interested in this thing, not
troubled by this thing, and he was certainly then being filled then
with being certain that in some way he was one being existing and
that sometime he would be one being a dead one and certainly every
one would certainly sometime be a dead one and certainly every one
would be one having been existing.</p>

<p>When he was a boy a young one if he had been a little different
then he might have been troubled by being troubled by anybody being
troubled, by everybody being troubled. He was one who was troubled
then, he knew some were troubled then, he felt quite clearly about
such a thing then about being troubled then, he was certain then
that sometime he would be completely interested in this thing. He
was sometime and for quite sometime troubled by this thing, he was
not completely interested in this thing in any one being a troubled
one.</p>

<p>He was then one beginning being living and he was one then being
one who was one. He was being one then. He was in the beginning of
being living. He had been living some time then. He was a boy then,
certainly he was a boy then. He was one having been sometime being
living, he was being one then being one being living. He was being
one then.</p>

<p>He was one who had some feeling. He felt something when he was a
young one. He always felt something. When he was a young one he was
certain that he would not be one having feeling. When he was a
young one he was certain that he would be one having some feeling.
He was not then completely interested in this thing. Sometimes then
he was almost completely interested in this thing. When he was one
being a young one he could have been one writing it down every day
that he was one not having feeling, that he was one not having any
feeling. When he was a young one he could have been writing it down
every day that he was wanting not going to be having feeling, not
going to be having any feeling. When he was a young one he could
have been writing it down every day that he was a troubled one. He
could have been writing down every day, when he was a young one,
that he was one doing everything, having complete living in doing
everything. When he was a young one he could every day have been
writing down that he was feeling clearly feeling something about
everything, that he was feeling, clearly feeling something about
every one.</p>

<p>He was quite clear in feeling what he was feeling and he was
quite clear in deciding about being being existing. He was
certainly then not completely interested in any one, in he himself
then being a troubled one.</p>

<p>When he was a little older he was clearly feeling certainly
clearly feeling something, he was clearly thinking then, he was
almost then needing to be certain that sometime he would be clearly
thinking about everything. He was not completely then needing to be
clearly thinking about everything, he was clearly then clearly
feeling something, he was then not clearly feeling something, he
was not needing to be clearly feeling the thing he was not clearly
feeling. He was clearly feeling something, he was almost completely
living in clearly feeling that thing, the things he was clearly
feeling. He was not completely living in the things he was clearly
feeling. He was completely needing to be clearly thinking about the
things about which he was clearly thinking. He was almost
completely living in clearly thinking about the things he was
clearly thinking, completely clearly thinking. When he was a young
one when he was beginning in being living he was a very little one,
that is a natural thing, he was then quite completely a little one,
he was then a very little one, that is a natural thing. When he was
beginning being living he was a very little one. He was living then
and then he was a little a bigger one and he was living then and he
was still a little bigger then. When he was beginning being living
he was one who was one, who was of a kind of a one. He was living
then. He was very well taken care of then as was a natural thing.
He was not ever really interested in this thing, interested in
having been a very little one, a completely little one. He was
quite not interested in this thing in having been a quite little
one. He was interested in having been one being a bigger one, he
was not ever interested in having been a completely little one.</p>

<p>He was then in the beginning a completely little one and this
interested some then, this did not ever interest him, this did not
very much interest any one knowing him. He had been a very little
one, certainly he had been, this was not a thing having meaning in
the being in him and this is a thing not really needing mentioning
that he had been a completely little one. He had been then in
beginning being living a completely little one. He certainly was
not ever remembering any such thing. He certainly was not really
ever finding this thing interesting. He was then a little a bigger
one and he a little remembered that thing and he did not interest
himself ever very much in this thing in having been a very little
bigger one. He was one quite remembering this thing having been a
little bit a bigger one, he was not at all minding remembering this
thing, he remembered quite clearly something of this thing, he was
not ever interested in this thing, he certainly quite clearly
remembered this thing remembered having been a little a bigger one
and he certainly was not ever really interested in this thing in
having been a little a bigger one. He was then a little more a
bigger one and he remembered something of this thing, he even
remembered feeling some little thing and it was a pleasant enough
thing to him to remember something then but it did not interested
him, it did not ever interest him. He quite clearly remembered
having been living then, he was not interested in remembering
having been living then, he remembered having been clearly feeling
something then, he was not ever really interested in remembering
having been clearly feeling something then. He was then a little a
bigger one then and he remembered somethings from then and he was
not ever really very much interested in any of them, in remembering
any of them. In a way he was not completely uninterested in having
been living then but really he was not completely interested in
having been living then, he went on being living then. He was
interested in having been going on being living then. He always was
interested in having been going on being living then. He want on
living then. He remembered something of that thing. He was a little
interested in remembering a little something of that thing.</p>

<p>He did sometimes write down something about having been just
being living when he was a young one, when he was in the middle of
his beginning living. He did then write down that he was a troubled
one and really he was not then a troubled one in the sense of being
interested in that thing, in the sense of remembering anything of
such a thing. It was to him later a little later when he was
reading what he had been writing surprising to be learning that he
had been every day then, all day then completely a troubled one.
Certainly he was not remembering any such a thing. Certainly he had
not been living in any such thing. Certainly he had been being a
troubled one, certainly he had not been completely interested in
any such thing, certainly he had been writing down such a thing.
This certainly did astonish him then. Anyway he was being living
and he was then deciding somethings quite often and some asked him
quite often then to decide something and certainly he was quite
clearly thinking then and he was feeling something and feeling it
clearly enough then and he was doing things with others who were
doing something and it was a thing he did quite well, some things
he did with them he did very well, some things he did with them he
did very well.</p>

<p>Certainly he did some things he did with some then very well,

Some are wondering if deciding something is something that makes
one be some one who really is doing something. Some certainly are
wondering if some things are being decided by those deciding some
things. Some are certainly uncertain whether they should have a
feeling of submission when some one has decided something. Some
certainly are wondering if deciding anything is giving any meaning
in being one being living. Some are certainly wondering if hoping
something about something being decided sometime is a thing that is
a feeling in them. Some are wondering if any one is not hoping that
some time some things will be decided. Some are certain that
sometime they will not be wondering about whether deciding anything
has any meaning. Certainly some are deciding some things. Certainly

if they were not ones being cheerful ones. Some of such of them
would be ones being gloomy ones if they were not ones not being

sorrowing. He was not ever sorrowing when he was a young one, he

deciding for any one that any one should not smell everything. He
was not deciding about smelling things, for any one. He was not

<p>A noise is something some one is hearing. Many are making noises
and many are hearing noises. A noise is a great many things some
one is hearing. A great deal of noise is something some one is
hearing.</p>

<p>A good deal of noise, a very great deal of noise, noise,
continued noise, more noise, always some noise, always a good deal
of noise, noise is what some one is hearing. A good deal of noise,
a great deal of noise, noise is something some one is not hearing.
A great deal of noise, noise, continued noise, a good deal of noise
is what some one would be hearing if there were any noise, if there
were a great deal of noise, if there were any noise for that one to
be hearing. Some one is sometime hearing very much noise. Sometimes
that one is not hearing any noise. There is sometimes not any noise
for that one to be hearing. A great deal of noise is something that

whom that one was certain was not a dull one is a dull one. Some
one who was certain that some one was not a dull one is now certain
that that one is a dull one. That one is asking if that one who was
once not a dull one if not now a dull one. That one is not so
certain that that one who was once not a dull one is now a dull
one, is not so certain of this thing that that one can tell any one
that that one is a dull one. That one is almost certain and that
one can talk about this thing about the one who was not a dull one
being now a dull one.</p>

<p>In a way it is a gentle thing to be one being not any longer
living that is to say it is a gentle thing to be one having done
something and doing that thing was not a gentle thing not at all a
gentle thing. It is a gentle thing to be one being one not any more
doing the thing that one was doing and it is a gentle thing to tell
about that thing by some other one the thing that one was doing.
Doing a thing is not quite a gentle thing, and having done the
thing is almost a gentle thing, and some one telling about it when
that one is not ever doing a thing is a gentle thing and discussing
that thing the thing done is a very gentle thing.</p>

ever coming to be certain that they are going on being living, he
was one finding very many being ones not going to be ever beginning
in keeping going in thinking, he was finding very many being
living, he was finding some being not at all dull in being ones he
was then knowing, he was finding very many being ones very likely
to be ones not going to be interesting some time, he was one
finding very many being quite stupid in being ones going on being
living, he was one finding very many not being dull in being ones
he was being knowing when they were being living, he was one
finding some going to be ones beginning being ones thinking, he was
one finding very many who were almost beginning being ones
thinking, he was one finding very many who were not ones thinking
what they were beginning to be thinking, he was one finding very
many who were not thinking, he was one finding very many who were
not clearly thinking, he was one finding some who were not

<p>Some one is doing something. Some have done something. What they
have done they have done and they worked then and they did a thing
and certainly it was a complete thing quite a complete thing and it
was not so gently a complete thing as it is when some other ones
are seeing it a completed thing. Some one has done something. It is
a completed thing, a quite complete thing. It has a beginning, a
middle and an end. It is all done. It is a complete thing. It was
done by some one. The one that did that thing began it and went on
with it and finished it. It is a complete thing. Any one can see it
and every one is certain that it is a complete thing, and some are
certain that it is a complete thing and some are feeling it to be a
complete thing and they are telling about it as being existing, a
complete thing, and certainly it is a complete thing, and certainly
then it is in a way a gentle thing, that is to say a gently
complete thing, that is to say a thing that is a complete thing and
some are certain of this thing. A thing is a complete thing and
then certainly if some come to know that of it it is a gentle thing
for certainly if any one can come to be certain that a thing is a
complete thing that thing is something that every one is gently
seeing. Certainly then some are saying they are not looking at it
and these then are not gently seeing anything, these are seeing a
complete thing but certainly not every one can be seeing that as a
complete thing. When any one, that is every one, that is some, that
is mostly any one can see something as a complete thing, that thing
has come to be a gently complete thing, a thing that can be gently
seen as a complete thing and anything that is a complete thing will
be sometime seen gently seen as a complete thing and certainly then
some will then be looking at some other thing. David Hersland was
not gently seeing anything as a complete thing. He was looking at
some things that mostly any one could see then as a complete thing
and he was then not really seeing it as a complete thing and so he
was not seeing it gently as a complete thing. Really he was not
seeing the things which have been made by some one and are complete
things. He certainly was looking at some of them, at a good many of
them, and he was certain they were complete things, and he was
almost seeing them gently, completely as gently complete things and
he was almost not looking at them, he was almost looking at the
things that are complete things, that some one was then making, as
a complete thing, as complete things and he was not completely then
seeing such a thing, seeing such things as complete things, really
then in a way he was not completely seeing complete things as
complete things, not really completely seeing complete things as
complete things, not really seeing a complete thing as a complete
thing and so he was almost seeing a complete thing, a thing any one
then could gently be seeing as a complete thing, he was almost
gently seeing that thing as a complete thing, and he was almost
seeing a thing, a complete thing some one was then making, as a
complete thing, he was almost then seeing such a thing as a
complete thing.</p>

<p>David Hersland was being living and he was then not any longer
being living. He was one being living and then being living and
then he was not any longer one, he was not then being one being
living.</p>

<p>Naturally some knew David Hersland had a brother and a sister
and a father and a mother. Naturally some were certain that he was
in Hersland family living. He was like them, of course he was like
them, why should he be unlike them when he had been living with
them and had come out of them and had heard them and had seen them.
He did some things in the way they did things. He did some things
in the way some of them did some things. Some do not like to do
things in the way they do things that is in the way some other ones
do things. Some are very earnest in this thing, some are very eager
in this thing, some are often telling about this thing about not
doing some things in the way some of the ones related to them by
blood connection are doing such things. David Hersland was not one
of such of them. He mostly was not thinking himself being one doing
a thing in the way some other one was doing a thing. And sometimes
it was a pleasant thing to him to be connected with every other one
by such a thing by doing things in a way he was noticing other ones
had been doing. Sometimes it was a pleasant thing to him to know
then that everything means something, that he was a part of every
one who was a part of him and sometimes he had very much family
feeling in him, sometimes he had quite enough family feeling in
him, very often he had not very much family feeling in him, very
often he was naturally not having any family feeling.</p>

day that he was being living then. He was not knowing every day

<p>He was knowing that he was being living every day. He was being

<p>Sometime he was feeling something. Sometime he was eating
something, sometime he was thinking something. In his daily living
he was thinking, he was eating, he was feeling. Any one could be
such a one. He was such a one. Not any one could be such a one. He
was almost not eating anything, he was thinking something, he was
feeling something. He had need of this thing of being one eating
something, of being one almost not eating anything. He had need of
these things of being one eating something, of being one almost not
eating anything.</p>

<p>Eating one thing is a way of living for some. Deciding to be
eating one thing is a way of living for some. Deciding anything
about eating is a way of living for some. Eating one thing,
deciding to eat one thing is all being living for some. David
Hersland was one deciding about eating something. David Hersland
was one sometimes deciding to be eating only one thing. Deciding
about eating one thing, deciding about eating, eating one thing,
eating some thing was not all of living for him. He was then one
living all his living that is to say until he was not any longer
living, until he was one who had been living, who was then one not
any longer living.</p>

<p>Every day that he was living he was one being himself inside
him, he was one doing something, he was one going to be doing
something, he was one knowing some, he was one some were knowing.
Every day he was being living he was not being one being himself
inside him to himself then as he was some other time in being
living. Every day he was being living he was pretty nearly being to
himself inside him what he was to himself inside him the other
times in his being living. He was himself inside him, pretty nearly
every day he was, was himself to himself inside him. Pretty nearly
every day he was being himself inside him to himself then and being
in a way different from being to himself inside him from the way he
was any other day and being pretty nearly the same to himself
inside him that day as every other day. He was, every day he was
being living, he was being to himself inside him pretty nearly the
same and quite not at all the same and certainly he was being
pretty nearly the same. Certainly he was, certainly he was pretty
nearly the same. Certainly he was not at all the same, quite not
the same. Every day he was knowing some one, knowing some, and

pretty nearly the same, to some he was the same one day as another
day. To some he was not the same not the same one day as another
day. Some were certain he was the same every day. Some were certain
he was not the same every day. He was the same every day, he was
pretty nearly the same to himself inside him every day and this is
not a description of him, this is certainly not a description of
him, that he was the same every day, that he was to himself pretty
nearly the same every day.</p>

<p>David Hersland lived as long as he was living and he certainly
sometimes was quite certain that he needed to be completely
expressing the feeling that certainly there was not any succeeding
in being living, that certainly it was enough not to have been ever
living, that it would have been enough to have not been one coming
to be living, that having been living, being living had not in any
way any meaning.</p>

<p>He certainly sometimes in being living was needing to have some
way of completely feeling such a thing and certainly sometimes in
being living he came almost completely to be feeling this thing, to
be completely feeling that it would have been enough not to have
come to be one being living. He certainly sometimes in being living
came to be almost completely feeling, completely feeling that being
living could not have in any way any meaning. He was sometimes
needing to have some way of expressing such a thing and sometimes
he did in some way express such a thing, he certainly did in some
way sometimes express such a thing. He did sometimes almost
completely feel such a thing. He did sometimes in some way express
such a thing. He certainly did sometimes in some way express such a
thing.</p>

<p>David Hersland was living and all the time he was not certain
that he was not needing feeling something that certainly not any
one and in a way he was certain of this thing, not any one was
really feeling. And then he was not certain. Certainly some were
really feeling something and that was then a thing that was
completely making it that something is existing and some are being
living in being doing something and that is making being living
something that has in a way a possibility in meaning and in a way
then it does not make any difference really of anything, does not
make really everything in any complete way a different thing and
certainly then there is not any way of having anything a different
thing since the different thing if it is a different thing is
completely a different thing and if it is not a different thing
then it is not a completely different thing and certainly then
David Hersland was not then feeling anything that was a completely
different thing and certainly then he was completely interested and
completely not interested in any such thing. He certainly was one
almost completely interested in a different thing. He certainly was
one almost completely not interested in a completely different
thing. He was almost completely interested in feeling a different
thing. He was pretty nearly not at all interested in feeling a
different thing. He was almost completely interested in feeling any
completely different thing. He certainly was almost completely
interested in not having completely been feeling something. He
certainly was almost completely interested in some having almost
completely felt something. He went on living and not a very long
time that is to say he was living to the ending of the beginning of
middle living and certainly he was then such a one, having been
such a one, one almost completely interested in feeling a
completely different thing, one almost completely interested in not
having been feeling a completely different thing, one almost
completely interested in any one feeling a completely different
thing, one almost not interested in feeling any different thing,
one almost completely not interested in any one completely feeling
any one thing, one almost completely interested in not completely
feeling anything, one almost completely interested in not feeling
any different thing.</p>

<p>In a way he was quite certain that not any one not coming to be
loving him could be coming to be completely listening to him. In a
way he was quite certain that not any one was coming to be loving
him. In a way he was not certain of this thing. In a way some one
was coming to be loving him and certainly then was listening to him
and certainly then he was knowing this thing knowing that this one
was listening to him and in a way then he was certain that this one
in a way was coming to loving him and certainly then this one was
not ever completely that thing and in a way he was certain of this
thing certain that this one was not coming to be completely that
thing one loving him. Certainly some were quite completely
listening to him and certainly he was knowing this thing knowing
they were quite completely listening to him and he knew too that
some one coming to be loving him would be coming completely to
listen to him and certainly in a way he was certain that not any
one had been completely coming to be loving him and certainly some
were almost completely doing this thing, loving him, and certainly
some were quite completely listening to him certainly quite
completely listening to him. In a way some one came to be loving
him and certainly was listening to him and he certainly did know
that if any one was coming completely to love him such a one would
come to completely listen to him and in a way he was certain that
not any one was doing any such thing coming to completely love him
and he was not certain that some one would not come to be doing
this thing coming to be completely loving him and certainly some

be certain that they are the one that is of the kind of them that
they are in being living. This is not then a completely easy thing
because then they are ones being ones then not doing everything and
not doing everything very often and certainly then it is not a
completely easy thing to be certain that that one is being of a
kind of a one completely of a kind of a one, that that one is
completely that one of that kind of a one of kinds in men and
women. Certainly any one could be one coming to be almost an old

some have begun again coming to be almost an old one. Any one might
be one coming to be almost an old one. In a way it is not a
completely satisfying thing having come to be almost an old one. In
a way it is a thing that is a finished thing having come to be
almost an old one. Some one is coming to do that thing again and
again coming to be almost an old one. Some one is almost completely
doing this thing coming to be almost an old one. Some one could be
one coming to be almost an old one and certainly then there is such
a thing, there is being almost an old one. Certainly there is such
a thing, there is being almost an old one. Some can know that there
is such a thing, that there is being almost an old one, some can
know that there is just enough of this thing, of there being that
any one is almost an old one. Some one will be one going on enough
to be such a one to be one being almost an old one. Some one is
going on enough in being that one in being one being almost an old
