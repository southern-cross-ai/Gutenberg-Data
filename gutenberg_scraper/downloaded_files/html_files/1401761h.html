  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">I. &mdash; DEATH'S FIRST SELECTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOMETIMES a well-executed murder clears the air. This
  observation is in no sense suggestively advanced. But the fact is that in
  virtually all groups, communities, and gatherings of human beings there are
  certain members who would be far, far better out of the way... persons whose
  speedy absence would result in more actual good than would their continued
  presence.</p>

  <p>It is even doubtful if the introduction of reason, which immediately
  suggests all sorts of inhibitions, would produce any permanently ameliorating
  results.</p>

  <p>More than one poor mortal has decorated a rope end, sat fleetingly but
  finally in a hot chair, or moldered for life in a cell, whose single act of
  violence has really benefited society or some part of it. The worst that can
  be said of him is that he has set it a questionable example. Of course life
  could not continue to muddle along under a regime of murder at random, a
  system of salutary but unsolicited removals. This cannot be for the simple
  reason that almost every one of us during the course of his or her life
  deserves to be murdered at least once....</p>

  <p>The fact remains, however, that murder is not always just
  that&mdash;murder. Sometimes it is murder and more, such as the manifestation
  of inherent decency. Murder is not always so simple and explicable as a mere
  bash on the head, a knife in the neck, a shot from a gun, or a dose of
  poison. Nor can its germ always be easily isolated. Sometimes its motives are
  so remote and yet so urgent, so involved yet so delicately balanced, that it
  becomes the height of futility to expect twelve other potential but as yet
  uninitiated murderers to sit justly in judgment.</p>

  <p>Impossible.</p>

  <p>The situation&mdash;society itself&mdash;should first be judged before the
  murderer is even placed on trial. And a situation, an atmosphere, a hidden
  conflict involving the lives and happiness of human beings, is frequently as
  difficult to grasp as smoke... as dangerous to handle as dynamite.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">So it well may be that in this particular situation things
had got
  themselves so involved, so out of hand, that the death of someone was
  inevitable&mdash;that the sudden removal of some human obstruction was the
  only happy way out.</p>

  <p>Yet, if so, it certainly seemed the least inevitable possibility in the
  world that that someone was destined to be so fair a creature as Emily-Jane
  Seabrook.</p>

  <p>Most certainly no one seeing this young woman swinging her shapely legs
  over the smooth turf of the Coastal Golf Club would have suspected that even
  then the shadow of Death was settling round her feet, and that the eyes of
  Death were watching her intently as she teed off at the first hole. On this
  fair morning it would have been hard to convince any one of her many friends
  and followers that within the brief span of thirteen hours the warm life
  would go shatteringly to fragments in the ruins of her highly desirable young
  body.</p>

  <p>Who could have predicted such an ending for Emily-Jane? Who could have
  desired for her such a hideous fate? Had she not everything to live for, this
  girl, this child of fortune? Perhaps&mdash;perhaps; but also other persons
  had a little living to do for themselves, and perhaps this idea had not even
  occurred to Emily-Jane Seabrook. She would distribute happiness on all sides
  &mdash;up to a point, a point where the distribution interfered with the life
  of Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>This is a bad way to be.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, but not always, does one get quite away with it. And in the
  case of Emily-Jane that quite made all the difference between her living and
  her dying. It made a lot of difference to Emily-Jane, and profoundly
  influenced the lives of several human beings. Of course, this was not new to
  Emily-Jane. She had always influenced human lives, but she would have never
  given her own to do so. The idea had never entered her competent little mind.
  Far from it. Her competent little mind was too firmly fixed on her body. It
  was a fine body. But, after all, the finest body can be broken most
  unattractively.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At the famous old Crewe mansion that night the engagement
of Barney Crewe
  and Emily-Jane was to be announced. This did not matter much. The engagement
  had been known from the early days of the summer&mdash;exactly two weeks
  after Barney had met Emily-Jane for the first time.</p>

  <p>What did matter, however, was the party. Masks and everything, the
  everything principally consisting of well-filled bottles and punch bowls.
  High revelry in honor of Emily-Jane, and perfectly promoted by that same
  efficient young woman. She did so enjoy seeing young people have a good
  time.</p>

  <p>Barney, himself, would have been considered no mean catch for any other
  girl save Emily-Jane. In this event Barney was the lucky man. This, in spite
  of the fact that he was young, wealthy, interesting enough, and a painter who
  worked with such utter disregard of his medium that already he had won some
  degree of recognition among the more eccentric artists who created with fine
  but futile frenzy, yet who totally lacked the impish irrelevance that Barney
  brought to even his most abominable work.</p>

  <p>What good, then, could result from the death of this fine girl? Who could
  be her enemy? Who could wish this apparently healthy-minded, stimulating,
  care-free creature anything but health, happiness, and success? To murder her
  would be an act of wanton vandalism. Brutal passion or jealousy could be the
  only possible motives for stopping her triumphal progress through life.</p>

  <p>So thought the world after the event. Of course, no one could have thought
  it before. Yet several persons were thinking things right now.</p>

  <p>Her light-hearted laughter floated back to the ears of Barney's elder
  brother Daniel, who from his easy chair on the club-house veranda was
  following her every move. And Daniel Crewe in turn was being watched from a
  pair of dark, intense eyes set deep in the head of Scott Munson. This man's
  intuitive suspicion of impending events had been keenly alert for the past
  six weeks of his stay with the two brothers. It was more than ever alert
  today.</p>

  <p>Yet there was nothing occult about Scott Munson. Hard facts, a deep
  insight, and close observation ruled his judgment. He had watched human
  beings in conflict for many years of his life, and in this present situation
  he recognized all the elements of serious trouble.</p>

  <p>Occasionally his eyes would shift to the girl on the golf-course, then
  return unobtrusively to the face and the hands of the man whose thoughts he
  was trying to read. Hands meant much to Scott Munson. Daniel Crewe was his
  friend, his good companion and, at present, his greatest problem. A problem
  that filled him with a keen sense of trouble and regret. All unconscious of
  the interest of these two motionless figures on the veranda&mdash;and a
  third, had it only been known&mdash;Emily-Jane tucked her arm under that of
  her partner and hurried him down the green slopes of the fairway.</p>

  <p>Lane Holt looked down at her with admiring but frankly unwholesome eyes.
  He made a remark in a quick low voice, and the girl did not look at all
  displeased.</p>

  <p>"Why, Lane," she said, "what a thing to say!"</p>

  <p>"But it would be, wouldn't it?" replied Lane. "Perhaps," she answered.
  "And a great deal more dangerous."</p>

  <p>"That would add spice and relish, my dear."</p>

  <p>"Listen, statuesque slave of your senses, you must bear in that evil mind
  of yours that up here in my new environment you are not supposed to know me
  one-hundredth part as well as you do&mdash;even less than that." Her laughter
  was not quite so innocent as she added: "You're playing golf with me this
  morning merely as a favor to my beloved Barney, who is doing bad things with
  his brushes."</p>

  <p>"Damn Barney," exclaimed Holt. "Damn him always and eternally."</p>

  <p>"Why damn Barney as much as all that? He does deserve considerable damning
  at times, but not such a generous portion."</p>

  <p>"Why the devil do you want to fling yourself away on him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh that!" said Emily-Jane carelessly. "Why not? He fills all the
  requirements. He's dumb, rich, and idealistic&mdash;head over heels." She
  paused a moment and looked enigmatically at her companion, then added : "And
  I'm clever, Lane my buck, but not quite so rich. Cheer up, life isn't over
  yet, not by a long sight it isn't."</p>

  <p>But in this Emily-Jane with all her youthful confidence was slightly in
  error, to put it mildly. Her life, had she but realized it, was almost over.
  The best or the worst part of it already lay behind. Little lay ahead save a
  crash, a moment of agony&mdash;and liberating darkness.</p>

  <p>"Unscrupulous woman," murmured Lane Holt, slipping his hand up her
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Nice woman," retorted Emily-Jane. "An exceptionally charming girl."</p>

  <p>She was just that. An exceptionally charming girl in many of the
  essentials. Beautifully built and alluringly poised. Hair of the sleek golden
  quality. It reflected light in yellow bars which slid attractively when she
  moved her head, so bobbed as effectively to show its shape. One felt like
  taking Emily-Jane's head between one's hands and holding it, feeling the
  smooth, fresh cheeks and looking into the large, blue, disarmingly innocent
  eyes. In the depth of those eyes lurked something slightly disturbing and
  exciting. Her face though small was broad. It ended in a surprisingly sharp
  little chin, lending to her a delightful impression of helplessness. Hers was
  that peculiar quality of innocence that subtly invited enlightenment. Her
  body, which at times could look so frail, was sinuous, swift with life and
  motion. Her torso moved with the endless variety of charm of a trained
  dancer. One could easily believe that Emily-Jane was completely unconscious
  of the effect she created when on the beach or dancingfloor. She might have
  been. Grace, strength, and freedom characterized her every movement. She was
  tireless, resilient, yet possessed of an abiding languor, an altogether
  captivating promise of eventual capitulation.</p>

  <p>Beyond doubt Emily-Jane had many things to live for, the most important of
  which were her senses and herself, but few realized this, for Emily-Jane had
  already lived and acquired wisdom if not merit.</p>

  <p>Lane Holt knew and understood her. Seven years ago in the propinquity of a
  college town their interests had coincided. Emily-Jane had graced a school
  for young ladies at that time. Although Holt had been in his senior year at
  the college the discrepancy in years and educational progress had made no
  difference in their mutual attraction. It was of a biological nature which
  was simple if not pure. They had belonged to a select little group of, let us
  say for the sake of charity, high-spirited boys and girls who loved fun.</p>

  <p>It was at this time and with these companions that Emily-Jane received the
  fundamentals of an exceedingly liberal education. It was at this time,
  likewise, that she had perfected the art of concealing an essentially vicious
  nature behind a refreshingly healthy and admirable exterior. A no mean art to
  master although it has a diversity of minor devotees.</p>

  <p>At college, too, Lane Holt had come to know Daniel Crewe. Barney being
  several classes lower had known Holt only distantly yet devotedly, as
  underclassmen should and will, although the reason is rather obscure to
  appreciate in most cases.</p>

  <p>The friendship between Daniel and Holt had been based on a mutual
  appreciation of literature and a bent for investigation which had carried
  them along on many an impossible intellectual exploration.</p>

  <p>About Lane Holt there had been an atmosphere of romance and intrigue. His
  dark brooding silences, his splendid, careless carriage, his indifference to
  public opinion, and his quick brain marked him out from his fellows. In
  short, he had been a selfish poseur with an eye open for easy opportunity.
  Daniel had known and liked him. Even envied him a little. They had never been
  companions. Toward the close of their final year they had entirely lost track
  of each other without even being aware of the fact.</p>

  <p>A few weeks ago they had met for the first time since those days. Since
  that meeting Holt, like Scott Munson and Emily-Jane, had become permanent if
  casual fixtures at the Crewe's hospitable establishment. There were others
  there, too, who also became involved in the timely obliteration of Emily-
  Jane.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Far out on the links now the girl was saying to her partner
in that
  lilting voice of hers: "And tonight, my fervid devastator, you must be more
  careful than you were in that last hollow."</p>

  <p>"You are losing your old fondness for taking chances. The approach of
  prosperity. What, my girl?"</p>

  <p>"My life has been composed of taking chances," she replied. "I love to
  take them, but also I detest being foolhardy except when I know I'm safe.
  There's a difference, a vast difference."</p>

  <p>"Wisdom in wickedness," suggested Holt. Makes wickedness a virtue," added
  Emily-Jane. "Safety first, then," agreed Holt, "but keep your eyes on that
  Scott Munson chap and also on big brother. Both have a restless, inquiring
  air about them."</p>

  <p>"I can easily dispose of Daniel," she observed. "In fact, I have done so
  quite effectively already. But Munson is a different matter altogether."</p>

  <p>"I'm told he's a sort of super-finder-out-of-things. Too intelligent to be
  human. Is he?"</p>

  <p>"All of that and more," she replied. "Last year he was drafted to sit on
  some silly old national crime commission. He played the active part. He's
  done things in this state&mdash;they're called big. The governor and district
  attorney and all the powers that be just eat out Of his bloodless hand and
  like it. He's been resting up here with the brothers all summer on the
  strength of past relations in parts unknown."</p>

  <p>"I hope he continues to rest and does nothing more than that," said Holt
  fervently.</p>

  <p>If Munson had heeded this pious hope, Holt's life might have been
  radically different.</p>

  <p>"For some reason," said Emily-Jane, "I'd like to break his resistance down
  and then torture him. Drive him mad. I can see it and feel it. God!"</p>

  <p>Emily-Jane permitted very few persons to look upon the expression then on
  her face. It was hot, voracious, strangely cruel. Her teeth were a trifle
  bared.</p>

  <p>And she was such a nice girl was Emily-Jane. Good company and all that. A
  real sport.</p>

  <p>At that moment even Lane Holt was just a wee bit skeptical. He had his
  doubts about Emily-Jane&mdash;his fears, also.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">II. &mdash; SILENT WATCHERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BACK on the club-house veranda Daniel Crewe was staring at
  the place where he had last seen the girl and her partner. All he now saw was
  an exceedingly exasperated fat man brutally assaulting a small white object
  that so far had successfully escaped any serious injury. The fat man was one
  of the club's richest members, so he could well afford to be both exceedingly
  fat and exasperated. It was nothing much to see. And it is to be doubted if
  Daniel actually witnessed the titanic conflict, which is just as well,
  because the sight would have given him, at that moment, but scant relief from
  his thoughts.</p>

  <p>His long, thin, tanned countenance was of a peculiarly friendly cast in
  spite of the trouble that now lay on it. There was a haunting suggestion of a
  misunderstood horse. A sort of protective expression had crept about his
  eyes, which were of an undecided gray. For a large, long, and apparently
  self-reliant man there was something unexpectedly speculative about Daniel
  Crewe, a sense of eternal sadness. It was as if the shadow of regret had
  settled lightly upon him, never to leave him altogether happy and at peace
  again. Life does such things to people regardless of their material
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>Daniel was thinking now of his brother, thinking with more desperation and
  bafflement than he cared to admit to himself. Yet even as he thought, he
  little suspected that in a short while now Death would be sending its
  impulses through his strong arms and that only a few short hours separated
  him from tragedy, stark and ugly.</p>

  <p>Interwoven in the thoughts of his brother were nagging thoughts of
  others&mdash;friends who held a place in his loyalty and confidence.</p>

  <p>There was Sam Stoughten, for instance. He had never been long separated
  from Sam even after having had four years of him as roommate at college. And
  then there was Sam's wife Sue. A good girl, Sue, sensitive as the devil
  beneath her apparent stolidity.</p>

  <p>And how about June Lansing? Daniel loved June. Recently she had informed
  him that they were engaged. Daniel had not answered back. He knew June. They
  must be engaged if she said so.</p>

  <p>He thought of these three oddly lovable individuals, then included himself
  and his brother. They were all involved, all a part of the picture. They were
  all actively engaged in the conflict that was taking place in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," he thought, "the five of us&mdash;all at the mercy of one
  girl, our happiness, our hopes, every damn thing."</p>

  <p>His eyes grew narrow, and there was a sudden hardening round his jaws.
  Scott Munson, silently watching, remarked this and pondered after his
  fashion.</p>

  <p>But chiefly Daniel's thoughts were with his brother Barney. Barney was a
  creature who deserved the serious thought of someone, and it was not the
  boy's fault.</p>

  <p>From the first this young man had always got the tough breaks. At birth he
  had lost his mother and thereby won his father's unreasonable antipathy, one
  might almost say active antagonism. The old man had resented Barney. Dan had
  been the favorite. Nothing too good for the first and successfully born. And
  Dan had hated it. The harder the old man had ridden Barney the stronger was
  Dan pulled to his brother. A strange nature, Dan's. What made it harder for
  him was his youthful realization that at heart his father was a good person
  and that perhaps somewhere hidden within his stubborn old heart was a sort of
  lonesome love for his younger son.</p>

  <p>Whatever it was, Barney from the outset had never got what he wanted. At
  every turn the old man had thwarted him, trampled on his small aspirations as
  a child, opposed them when the boy had grown to manhood. It had only been
  through the active intervention of Dan that Barney had been given his chance
  to paint. Even then it had been a source of sporadic friction and
  ridicule.</p>

  <p>Then the old man had died. After that life had taken on a different color
  for Barney&mdash;a friendlier warmth. The bulk of the estate had gone to
  Daniel. To Barney had been allotted the magnificent income of five thousand
  two hundred dollars per annum. Even unto the end&mdash;a typical gesture.</p>

  <p>Promptly and without questioning his brother, Daniel had set about
  readjusting matters so that the valuable estate was equally divided even to
  the joint ownership of their picturesque old summer home on the Connecticut
  side of Long Island Sound.</p>

  <p>In the simplicity of his soul Barney had been well satisfied with the
  original arrangement. He was pleased with his one hundred dollars a
  week&mdash;enthusiastic about it. No need now to swallow his pride and to
  wait for whatever small bits of change that might come his way. The
  experiences of his youth had left their traces.</p>

  <p>"Now I'll never have to work much," he had confided to Daniel. "Just paint
  all the time, all the damntime. Travel perhaps. But of course I'll live here
  with you, keep on living here just as always... it's a nice old place... that
  is if you want me. When you get married I'll paint a portrait of your wife.
  For nothing," he added magnificently.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Daniel. "That will be great. Yes, you'd better keep on
  living right where you are. It would be safer. We're used to you round here.
  Just sit down quietly somewhere and paint all the damn time."</p>

  <p>"And travel perhaps," added Barney.</p>

  <p>So that was all settled.</p>

  <p>Then Daniel had gone about making Barney a rich young man and had
  understood perfectly when Barney had failed to be impressed with his newly
  acquired wealth. As a matter of fact, the whole strange business had made
  young Barney a little more than upset. He had not returned to his usual
  abnormal self until he had made an elaborate and illegal will in which he
  beautifully left all his earthly goods to Daniel, not omitting his paintings.
  They received special mention. For some reason rather vague in his ewn mind
  Barney seemed to believe that this will of his relieved him of all further
  interest in and responsibility for his fortune. He was now left free to paint
  all the damn time when not benignly contemplating his brother as his
  prospective heir.</p>

  <p>These brothers, each in his own way, were strangely dependent on each
  other. Yet that did not prevent them from seeing clearly each other's
  imperfections. For example, Barney could never quite forget how stupid Daniel
  had been about breeding foxes. Barney had made the suggestion after having
  read about fox-breeding in some Sunday supplement. It had resulted in one of
  those idiotic exchanges both enjoyed.</p>

  <p>"And why in God's name should we breed foxes?" Daniel demanded.</p>

  <p>"We'd have more foxes then." This with patience from Barney.</p>

  <p>"What do we want with more foxes?" persisted the other.</p>

  <p>"But we haven't any foxes at all yet," replied Barney, keeping a strong
  hold on himself.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know, but suppose we had some foxes?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we'd just have more, that's all. We'd have more foxes. Isn't that
  enough for you?"</p>

  <p>"Too damned much," scoffed Daniel. "What would we do with all these foxes
  knocking about all over the place? I ask you that."</p>

  <p>"We could sell them. Earn a good profit," suggested Barney, who had not
  thought the idea quite through.</p>

  <p>"And take the bread out of some other fox-breeder's mouth," countered
  Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Why bread?" asked Barney mildly.</p>

  <p>"Why not bread?" returned Daniel. "Don't fox-breeders eat bread like the
  rest of us?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Barney stoutly. "I never met a fox-breeder. How did
  bread get into this argument anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but let's not go on about foxes any more," pleaded
  Daniel.</p>

  <p>"All right," replied Barney, getting pretty well tired of foxes himself.
  "But we could give them away to our friends for Christmas or just any old
  time for that matter."</p>

  <p>"Who wants a fox?" asked Daniel.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who wants a fox right off," cried Barney. "I don't go round
  asking people if they want foxes. Let's forget there ever was a fox. Sorry
  now I brought up the subject, sorry I even mentioned the name of fox. Thought
  it would be a thing to do, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Yes," grinned Daniel cynically, "a hell of a thing to do. You just stick
  to your painting, Barney. Why not paint yourself a couple of foxes and then
  breed 'em?"</p>

  <p>Too full for words Barney went about his ways. He might yet breed foxes
  just to spite his brother. And in his dream he pictured the whole countryside
  swarming with foxes until at last they were trampled under foot.</p>

  <p>Daniel was convinced, perhaps justly, that his brother needed the
  protection of a stronger mind. If not, why did the boy persist in painting
  red apples sky-blue and in giving to his nudes the unpalatable hue of a very
  old and dead fish?</p>

  <p>"Because I see 'em that way," the exasperated Barney had once explained
  under the fire of rude criticism.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a terrible way to see anything," observed Daniel, and added
  color blindness to his brother's other deficiencies.</p>

  <p>An aunt, Miss Matty Evans, often had to listen to this sort of stuff, and
  although she was mildly amused she wondered how men could be such fools.</p>

  <p>"You two should go on the vaudeville circuit when you get to arguing," she
  once remarked. "People are crazy enough to pay money to listen to that kind
  of nonsense."</p>

  <p>Until the appearance of Emily-Jane at the beginning of the summer the
  world had been a good place for the two brothers_</p>

  <p>At the thought of this girl and her potentialities for harm, Daniel's
  hands gripped the arms of his chair, gripped and held fast. The man who sat
  quietly watching him over the rim of his newspaper was quick to note this
  involuntary action. He wondered what he could do for Daniel&mdash;how he
  could force himself into his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"What can I do?" Daniel was thinking. "Something must be done. How can I
  prevent that young idiot from going through with it? What can I tell him?
  She's got me all tied up&mdash;cold."</p>

  <p>As his eyes stared unseeingly across the green expanse of the golf-course
  these questions went jabbing through his mind steadily, unceasingly like a
  physical pain. Scott Munson, observing the conflict, felt a growing
  excitement within himself, something undefinable yet filled with imminent
  danger. About Daniel as he sat there brooding there was an atmosphere of
  fatefulness, as if already he was on his way to some final yet inevitable act
  that would forever cut him off from old familiar ties.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson sensed this and divined the source of Daniel's trouble. He
  had watched his friend looking at Emily-Jane when that golden young slip had
  teed off at the first hole and he knew that although she was now no longer
  there Daniel was still seeing her in his mind's eye. And Munson knew that to
  Daniel this girl stood for everything that was undesirable in life,
  everything that was disastrous.</p>

  <p>Munson knew this much from his power of concentrated observation helped by
  his knowledge of Daniel. But there were many other things that Munson did not
  know, but which he would very much have liked to know.</p>

  <p>For instance, he did not know that seven years past, when at college,
  Daniel had had intimate relations with Emily-Jane and that recently, even in
  the face of her approaching marriage with his brother, the girl had attempted
  to renew those relations. This was one thing that Munson did not
  know&mdash;one single scrap of concrete knowledge which might have done much
  to alter circumstances.</p>

  <p>Nor did Munson know anything about the "Hush! Hush! Club," an esoteric
  little organization that festered during Daniel's later period at college and
  created no end of salacious speculation among certain members of the student
  body. The celebrations and rituals of this group were never mentioned nor
  could they be mentioned for the obvious reason that expulsion and disgrace
  would have descended swiftly upon its members. And even members of such
  little circles do not court this kind of public recognition.</p>

  <p>And innocent Emily-Jane had been its high priestess and inspiration.</p>

  <p>Into the inner circles of this group of girls and boys Emily-Jane had
  conducted Sam Stoughten. There she had dominated him physically, and Sam had
  gone through a very bad time of it before Daniel had succeeded in conducting
  him back for a breath of fresh air. But in doing so Daniel had momentarily
  come under the sway of Emily-Jane, who, to do her credit, appears to have
  been a specialist in her particular line.</p>

  <p>Another thing Scott did not know was about the letters.</p>

  <p>Sam had killed a classmate, killed him because of Emily-Jane. True enough,
  Sam had not meant to kill the boy. It had been one of those situations in
  which the loser died as the result of a fair fight. The authorities had never
  been able to trace the supposed murderer, but Sam had been silly enough and
  heart-broken enough to pour the whole story into a letter to Emily-Jane. In
  this letter written in a moment of self-loathing Sam shouldered the
  responsibility for the boy's death. In the hands of a district attorney, it
  would be an extremely convincing confession.</p>

  <p>Then there were other letters. Lots of them. Poor Sam had poured out on
  paper the ravings of a temporarily diseased mind, and Emily-Jane was in
  possession of the collected filth. Also she had a few rather revealing
  letters from Dan. More important still, Emily-Jane had told Daniel that
  unless he played hands off, those letters would find their way into the hands
  of Sue and June. Daniel knew that this was no idle threat. Emily-Jane was
  quite reckless enough to pull down the whole house of cards and involve them
  all in the crash. She had more strings to her bow than one.</p>

  <p>Taken altogether it was a pretty situation. The happiness of more than one
  person was tangled up in it. In striking at one, Emily-Jane could injure them
  all&mdash;Sam, Sue, Barney, June and Daniel. She held all the cards and was
  playing them with the skill of an experienced player. But this is sometimes
  dangerous. It certainly was so in the case of Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>Finally, Scott Munson was not aware of the fact that through a window of
  the club-house at that very minute the amiable face of Sam Stoughten was also
  turned toward the links whereon Emily-Jane was sporting with Lane Holt. It
  would have given Munson more unpleasant food for mental consumption had he
  been able to see the expression lurking behind Sam's horn-rimmed glasses.</p>

  <p>For Sam those letters existed like some tangible defilement, some deadly,
  unclean threat. When he encountered Emily-Jane at the home of the brothers
  the weight of the ages again settled down on his sturdy shoulders. He longed
  to remove from the face of the earth this girl who was planning such an
  unfair enterprise as to marry Barney.</p>

  <p>He did not blame her for the past. Sam took, as he should, full
  responsibility on himself for his own con-duct. But to strike through him and
  through Daniel at others... well, yes, murder was not so bad after all in
  certain situations.</p>

  <p>Then, there was Lane Holt. A chance encounter after years had led Daniel
  to invite the man to visit him&mdash;an idle invitation and a ready but
  graceful acceptance.</p>

  <p>That did it. Lane Holt was among them. He, too, was a part of the picture.
  Quite an important part. He was on the side of Emily-Jane. He had a
  comprehensive understanding of the situation. Daniel more than suspected that
  he was taking full advantage of it right under the eyes of poor color-blind
  Barney.</p>

  <p>It had all come about through the unfortunate over-sight of allowing
  Barney at large unaccompanied. But who could have forecast the result? As a
  rule Barney never paid personal attention to women. In the abstract he had
  vague, fanciful ideas about them. In the flesh he loved to look at them when
  pleasing. But no one for a moment suspected he would drive home with one of
  them from the Coastal Golf Club and keep her there for lunch, later in the
  dusk of a summer's evening driving off with her again. Only Emily-Jane could
  turn a trick like that. And Emily-Jane had done it.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson had been present when Barney had introduced Emily-Jane to
  Daniel. From that moment on Munson had been aware of gathering forces,
  electricity in the air. And when, finally, Emily-Jane had landed the
  idealistic Barney and established herself as a part of the household under
  the skeptical chaperonage of Miss Matty Evans, Munson had known that things
  were all wrong with Daniel and that the situation was not going to improve
  until Emily-Jane was removed. Just how this was to be accomplished Munson
  failed to see. However, what he did see was that Emily-Jane in some peculiar
  way known only to herself had a strong hold on Daniel and that Daniel was
  unsuccessfully striving to break it.</p>

  <p>Sitting there on the veranda, Munson felt that the situation, whatever it
  was, was rapidly coming to a climax that the climax was at hand, right there
  among them all.</p>

  <p>Munson looked as much like a detective as a detective will ever look like
  one. He had been a detective, actively and successfully. The government knew
  his work. But Munson was more of the scholar, more of the student. He was a
  living curiosity directed by intelligence and a power of observation that
  almost approached divination. He could feel a situation, anticipate a coming
  conflict. As a lecturer in criminology and psychological detection he had
  been much in demand among colleges that went in for that sort of thing. He
  had two passions&mdash;the study of human conduct, and travel, thc_ latter
  running a poor second. When actively engaged on a case he was absolutely
  ruthless, attacking the minds of those he suspected with devilish ingenuity.
  He had, perhaps, his own private opinions about murder and other allied
  indulgences, but these were so clearly separate from his professional
  attitude that not even his best friend could count on the slightest latitude
  or show of grace.</p>

  <p>And that is what troubled Munson all the more in this present situation.
  He feared for Daniel, and would willingly have sacrificed his own career to
  prevent disaster&mdash;to save his friend from the danger he felt was
  present. But once Daniel committed himself to a certain unlawful course of
  conduct, once he, for example, took a human life, Munson would be arrayed
  against him and would give Daniel no more quarter than he would have given
  any other individual who had placed himself beyond the pale of the law.
  Before the event, Scott Munson was human; after&mdash;well, he followed his
  own convictions, for which perhaps no one can blame him&mdash;much.</p>

  <p>His large, dark, intense eyes; his sharp, determined features; his
  straight black hair, slightly streaked with gray, his slim, alert body, well
  poised and competent&mdash;all these characteristics of Scott Munson created
  an impression of a man not easily deflected from his course. About him at
  times there was something uncomfortably subtle, something Satanic. One felt
  that within him dwelt some hidden source of power waiting to be released. No
  doubt this impression was created because of the man's abnormal interest in
  the mental processes of virtually everyone with whom he came in contact.
  People were never quite stupid to Munson. He never grew bored with the most
  banal individual, for the reason that he was completely engrossed in trying
  to sound and chart the substrata thought currents tunneling the mind of the
  person under observation. Many women hated him instinctively. More men would
  have done so, perhaps, were it not for the fact that even today men have a
  greater opportunity to live their dreams, to turn their currents of thought
  into active expression. Had Scott Munson suddenly found himself in a world of
  normal, well-adjusted, standardized minds he would willingly have exchanged
  his bodily comforts for all the torments of hell.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Eyes on the links, watching&mdash;three pairs strong. And
even as they
  watched the object of their vigil came lightly across the green accompanied
  by her debonair partner.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the two approaching the club-house with their open display
  of intimacy and understanding, a low sound of impotent anger involuntarily
  escaped Daniel's lips, and he rose quickly from his chair. Munson followed
  his example, and in silence the two men walked down the veranda and stood
  together at its edge. Only Sam Stoughten did not move at the girl's approach.
  He remained motionless at the window, his eyes alone moving, but their
  expression never changed. The sharp, concealed hatred never left them. It
  lived and darted there behind his slightly tinted horn-rimmed glasses.</p>

  <p>Daniel stood gazing out at the quiet surface of the Sound upon whose blue
  waters, about three miles out, a group of fair green islands lay sprinkled in
  picturesque disorder, their shores rimmed in collars of cream-white. sand.
  There was an expression of hopelessness in Daniel's brooding eyes. June
  Lansing's image was floating through his thoughts. She was mingling with bad
  company, for desperation was bringing to the surface in his mind a resolve it
  had long restrained.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, a hand fell upon his shoulder. He swung round with a sharp
  start. Between himself and Scott Munson stood Holt.</p>

  <p>"Will either of you gentlemen do me the favor of a flask?" he asked. "It
  was plenty hot out there. We cut our game short."</p>

  <p>"Don't swing a flask," said Daniel shortly. "I'm going home."</p>

  <p>He strode off down the veranda, knocking against a chair. Holt's gaze
  followed the retreating figure, and the man who stood for a moment quietly
  but intently regarding Holt read in his eyes a mixture of malice, envy, and
  scorn, which is never a pretty thing to see.</p>

  <p>"Half a minute," said Scott, and doubled back of the club-house.</p>

  <p>"Damn cads," muttered Holt. He hated their guts. He wished to God they
  were well out of the way. Mr. Holt was quite sincere about this. For Daniel
  his emotion was mixed with sordid envy, for Munson with wholesome fear. To
  him Barney did not matter. The boy was growing a full set of horns even
  before he had a wife. That was funny in a way&mdash;funny to Lane Holt. He
  sought out Emily-Jane to tell her about it. The girl laughed merrily. It was
  pleasant to hear such laughter.</p>

  <p>Munson, standing by Dan's roadster, watched him thoughtfully as he
  approached.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Daniel, regarding Munson with a sort of rebellious
  interrogation in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Although they had been sitting with. each other practically all morning on
  the veranda of the club, this was the first word that had passed between
  them. The gift of silence is vouchsafed only to those who are either content
  with their thoughts or unhappily occupied with them.</p>

  <p>"Well?" replied Munson, also with a rising inflection.</p>

  <p>Daniel experienced a stab of nerves as Munson remained quietly looking at
  him. "What do you mean by well, Scott?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What did you mean?" replied Munson.</p>

  <p>Daniel laughed uneasily. "Nothing much, I expect," he replied. "Just
  wondering what you wanted&mdash;how you got here."</p>

  <p>"No, you didn't, Daniel," replied Munson seriously. "You meant, what was I
  thinking you were thinking. If you want to know, Dan, I've been thinking a
  damn sight more than I care to. I'd like to feel free to let your thoughts
  alone. I mean that, Dan, for you of all men. What's on your mind? What's
  burning you up? Hadn't you better come across with me? Let's face the trouble
  together. You know I can help at times. At least you won't feel so confounded
  lonesome. Come on, Dan, old boy."</p>

  <p>Slowly Daniel climbed into his car. He appeared not to have heard his old
  friend. How tired and strangely remote he felt... old for his thirty years.
  When at last he spoke he did not look at Munson, but continued to stare
  vacantly ahead over the arc of the steering wheel.</p>

  <p>"Scott," he said, "there's only one person can help now and she&mdash;I
  mean, that person won't help. That person who could help, who could so easily
  help, only wants to hurt, to injure and destroy. I know that." He drummed
  nervously on the wheel with the tips of his long brown fingers. "Yet
  something's got to be done," he added as if to himself. "Something...
  what?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe together we could dope that something out," suggested Munson.</p>

  <p>Then Daniel turned and asked Munson a strange question, one that troubled
  his friend's thoughts considerably throughout the tragic days to follow.
  "Tell me, Scott," he began, as if he were inwardly puzzling over a certain
  problem, "tell me this. A man purchases deliberately a number of high-powered
  guns, arranges his business affairs, and, let us say, travels all the way to
  Africa at no small trouble and expense. Well, once there this man proceeds to
  organize and equip a small army of carriers and what-nots. Then, after
  several weeks of crouching, stalking, and false-dealing in general, he brings
  down a fine, great elephant or a tiger&mdash;animals that are minding their
  own affairs, keeping to their own land, and living according to their own
  savage code. What would you call that man, Scott? What would the world call
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Why, don't be childish, Dan !" laughed Munson.At the worst he's nothing
  more than a fanatical hunter, a waster of time, money, and animal life.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>Daniel nodded appreciatively. "Just so," he went on, "but the idea of it
  has always puzzled me somewhat. I know I'm a bit childish about wantonly
  killing things &mdash;always have been." He hesitated a moment, then
  continued: "And suppose that same chap removes from the face of the earth a
  person who wrecks and strikes at one's very being&mdash;one's so-called soul,
  a person far more deliberately cruel and dangerous to society than the most
  treacherous beast or reptile that lurks in the jungle, a creature who is not
  only evil but also one who can create evil in others&mdash;what, Scott, would
  you call that person?"</p>

  <p>There was fever in Daniel's eyes as he turned and confronted his
  friend.</p>

  <p>"I see what you're driving at, Dan," slowly replied Munson, "and I can't
  say that in a manner of speaking I don't sympathize with your point of view.
  But again you're all wrong. You can't trifle with human life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How about human hearts and souls?" snapped Daniel.</p>

  <p>"As things stand today the law fails to take them strictly into
  consideration," said Munson, "although they play a part. But, by and large,
  it has a hard enough time dealing with the body. There are no doubt
  soul-murderers or heart-murderers or mind-murderers, but as a rule they
  escape unpunished in this world. Daniel, the man you spoke of, no matter what
  the circumstances, is in this world a murderer, and there's no getting away
  from that. We're living in this world, you see. Remember that, Dan, remember
  that."</p>

  <p>Again Daniel nodded agreement. "I guess you're right at that, Scott," he
  said with a twisted smile. "No doubt about it. But, after all, it does seem
  sort of goofy, doesn't it? Damn goofy I'd call it, if you ask me.
  Murderer&mdash;a nice, bright, homelike word, that!" He paused and smiled at
  Munson, and this time his smile was natural and friendly. "Just like some of
  the crazy discussions we used to have back at college. Thanks, Scott. See you
  soon. You're lunching at the club, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for an answer he set his car in motion.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">III. &mdash; DANIEL AND BARNEY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a moment Scott Munson stood poised in the driveway
  watching the gliding roadster until it raced round a curve, then, going
  swiftly through a rear door of the club-house, he reached the veranda just in
  time to see Emily-Jane Seabrook signal Daniel to stop. For a moment it looked
  to Munson as if Daniel were going to disobey the summons of the gracefully
  fluttering hand, but slowly the car slackened speed and came to a reluctant
  stop.</p>

  <p>At that moment Munson became aware of a figure standing beside him, and
  turned to inspect the tense body and clenched hands of Sam Stoughten.
  Munson's eyes swept to the other's face and lingered there fascinated by what
  he saw written on the tight lips, the grim jaw, and the chin aggressively
  out-thrust. And behind the lenses of the glasses Scott caught a glimpse of
  the fires of hell itself. Stoughten stood there thus for a moment, his guard
  of reserve down, then his body relaxed as if defeated, the chin dropped, the
  hands swung helplessly, and the man turned back to the club-house.</p>

  <p>In this brief flash of self-revelation Sam had furnished Scott Munson with
  still more food for thought. And Munson's first thought was that Emily-Jane
  had more than one seeming friend who did not wish her any too well.</p>

  <p>"Half a mo'," cried that young lady, as she ran down the steps and gaily
  approached her prospective brother-in-law, now waiting sullenly behind the
  wheel of his car.</p>

  <p>Munson saw that much, but what he did not see, nor did anyone else for
  that matter, was the swift change of expression that took possession of
  Emily-Jane's features the exact moment she felt sure she was free from the
  observation of others.</p>

  <p>No more of the frank-eyed Emily-Jane. Gone&mdash;vanished! Here was a new
  creature, a thing ridden by a hot venomous fury. Laughing Emily-Jane had
  become a hard-voiced, blazing young devil, something a trifle subhuman. At
  first she had nothing to say but much to look, then gradually an unpleasant
  smile re-arranged the lines of her lips.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that again, Daniel," she said evenly. "You wanted to make a fool
  of me in front of the whole damn club. Well, don't do it, Daniel. Don't do
  it, my ex-slave."</p>

  <p>She laughed, as Daniel's face darkened. And had she but known it each
  ringing note was doing a terrible thing to her.</p>

  <p>"Wipe that look off your face, Daniel," she went on softly. "Look like you
  used to, or have you forgotten how?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Daniel at last. "It didn't make sufficient impression, but you
  seem to remember."</p>

  <p>"You're going to live to regret that, Daniel," she said, leaving a pause
  of ice between each word.</p>

  <p>"I doubt that," replied Daniel, looking at her strangely. "But what do you
  want? I'm waiting."</p>

  <p>"Tell your brother I'm lunching at the club," she said, "and explain to
  him in words of one syllable about tonight. You're going to make the formal
  announcement and drink to our happiness. You'll like that, won't you, Daniel?
  You're the head of the family, you know, such as it is. That's about all for
  now," she went on, after a short pause during which she had been enjoying the
  effect of her words. "That's about all except that I suggest you stop
  treating Lane Holt as if he didn't belong. He's a particular friend of mine.
  I'm fond, of Lane. Very. And, Daniel dear, you might as well make up your
  mind to be a good boy right now. We'll be better friends that way... much
  better friends. If you don't behave" &mdash;once more she paused and looked
  at him consideringly&mdash; "if you don't, Daniel, I'll kick over the whole
  damn apple cart. You have more to lose than I, you and your precious friends.
  And the harm that I can do can never be undone. Remember that, Daniel. Now
  you may go."</p>

  <p>Her silvery laughter fell pleasantly on the soft quiet air and brought a
  responsive smile to the lips of several sentimental dowagers clucking round
  their daughters on the veranda. Emily-Jane was always passing happiness
  along.</p>

  <p>She had just passed great quantities of it to Daniel, but there was little
  suggestion of a smile on his lips as he sent his car, like a whirring curse,
  down the sweeping driveway of the Coastal Country Club.</p>

  <p>Emily-Jane's short talk with Daniel had done her small good. If she had
  not been altogether popular with him before, she was far less now. As he went
  brooding over the country road on his way homeward, Daniel Crewe swore both
  darkly and deeply in his heart that for once in her life Emily-Jane was not
  going to have anything like her way. She would never defeat him. He knew this
  now. And he also knew why she would never defeat him. But this knowledge,
  instead of bringing to him the relief one would expect, filled him with a
  sort of dull horror. He experienced a desire not to be alone with himself,
  and at the same time felt a strong inclination to lie down somewhere and hide
  like an animal&mdash;not like a man.</p>

  <p>Already he felt the world withdrawing a little from him. Already he stood
  aside as if he were another person and criticized the determination that was
  solidifying in his mind. He had a strange feeling that within his very being
  he was utterances not lost on the ears of two men who were standing a little
  apart from the group. Its effect was to cause the cohiding and protecting a
  stranger, a furtive, stealthy stranger with whom he must become friendly so
  that he should no longer fear his promptings.</p>

  <p>This furtive stranger was assuring him in no equivocal language that he
  had been a damn fool to ask Scott Munson those revealing questions just now.
  That had been a decidedly false step. Daniel must be more careful. There must
  be no more false steps. From now on he must avoid arousing the slightest
  suspicion. Tonight, for instance, tonight of all nights, he must convince the
  world that he admired and respected his brother's future wife. He must go
  through with it successfully. A man can do anything if he tries. Another
  thing, he must attempt to erase all traces of suspicion that might lie in the
  mind of his friend Scott Munson. No. Better leave Scott alone. Let that
  conversation pass. The harm had already been done.</p>

  <p>Daniel stopped the car at the side of the road and wiped his forehead. Why
  was he sweating so? He held up his hands before his eyes and looked at them
  intently. Then for a long minute he studied his features in the driver's
  mirror. Any change? No. None that he could see. Quite the same old Daniel. A
  trifle pale perhaps. Still, there was that unaccustomed sensation of
  trembling, of trembling inwardly. Better take a drink, suggested the
  stranger, and Daniel, acting on this never unwelcome suggestion, drew a
  silver flask from the side pocket of the roadster and helped himself.</p>

  <p>As he did so a car, filled with acquaintances, flashed by, some of its
  occupants being just human enough tolook back, as if to make sure of having
  seen something unusual.</p>

  <p>"Strange thing for Dan Crewe to be doing," said a man named Jackson.
  "Never saw Daniel drinking all alone before. Must have needed it badly. Had
  to stop his car and pull up at the roadside. The thirsty devil couldn't wait
  till he reached home."</p>

  <p>But Daniel had not heeded the passing of the car. His nerves had ceased
  jumping. Yes, he would go home now and make one last effort. He would try his
  luck with Barney.</p>

  <p>If he only could. If he only could. At the thought of possible success his
  world came back a little. Daniel almost prayed.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Back on the club-house veranda Emily-Jane was chatting
spiritedly with
  young and old alike. That was one of her many charms. She always found time
  to be gracious to the mothers and fathers of her friends.</p>

  <p>"If only the other young people would try to be more like her," was a
  general observation.</p>

  <p>"Dan's such a lovable old bear," she was saying, "but such a goose. He's
  so fussy and nervous about tonight that he looks for all the world like an
  undertaker trying to sympathize with a corpse."</p>

  <p>Propheti utterances not lost on the ears of two men who were standing a
  little apart from the group. Its effect was to cause the color momentarily to
  withdraw from Sam Stoughten's ruddy face. He turned abruptly away and sought
  a secluded chair. Scott Munson idly moved in his direction.</p>

  <p>"Yes," continued Emily-Jane, "the poor man's elected to make the formal
  announcement, and he doesn't seem to have the vaguest idea how to go about
  it. He'll probably begin with, 'Come, all ye. Come, all ye. The honorable
  judge is now sitting'!"</p>

  <p>Amid general laughter she escaped from the circle and flashed down the
  veranda. As she passed Sam Stoughten's chair she paused
  lightly&mdash;tauntingly.</p>

  <p>"Hello there, Sambo," she said. "All alone and sullen. Where's black-eyed
  Susan?"</p>

  <p>"Why, haven't you seen her?" asked Stoughten in a casually bitter tone.
  "Why not write to her? You admit yourself you're good with letters."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps some day I'll take your advice, Sambo," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better be quick," said Stoughten. "Meaning what?" asked Emily-
  Jane.</p>

  <p>Stoughten did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Sambo," said the girl, after a moment of thoughtful
  silence. "And don't try to frighten me. Admit you're licked and behave
  yourself. Good-by, Sambo, dear."</p>

  <p>She passed lightly on down the veranda.</p>

  <p>Presently Scott Munson moved quietly from the shadow of an alcove near the
  water-cooler and, seating himself by Stoughten, deliberately lighted a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Smoke, Sam?" he asked, extending his case.</p>

  <p>The hand that selected a cigarette trembled slightly. "Thanks," said Sam,
  but for several minutes he made no attempt to light the cigarette.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Daniel found his brother contentedly at work in the dining-
room, the last
  place in the world any normal painter would select for his efforts. The room
  was almost dark, the curtains being drawn, but Barney seemed to be either
  unaware of the lack of light or indifferent to it. Today he was engaged in
  seeing the most uncompromisingly yellow bananas in shades of girlish pink. On
  the table at his elbow was a bowl of fruit, pieces of which he had already
  partly eaten as if to make sure that his subjects were authentic. It would
  have been a pity to waste so much talent on stuffed fruit. Daniel stood
  looking down at the painting over his brother's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Even the specks are wrong," he observed at last, with a note of the old
  bantering challenge in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Don't take them too much to heart," replied his brother, without
  troubling to look up. "They're my specks, after all. I see 'em that way, so
  they are that way. Go paint some specks of your own. I'll match my specks
  against yours, speck for speck, catch as catch can."</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," said Daniel. "It's a wonder to me you can paint any
  specks at all in this light."</p>

  <p>He sat down at the long table and stretched his arms wearily across its
  deep, glowing surface.</p>

  <p>"I've decided to accustom myself to painting in entire darkness,"
  announced Barney. "I may even start a new school of painting. It will be
  altogether intellectual, uninfluenced by externals, dependent on neither
  color nor form. Just pure thought&mdash;the brain transferred to canvas."</p>

  <p>"Yours transferred to canvas would leave it quite unspoiled," observed
  Daniel.</p>

  <p>"In that there would be some deep significance," said his brother.</p>

  <p>"When you paint in the dark," asked Daniel, not in the least interested,
  "how will you know what you're painting?"</p>

  <p>"It is better not to sometimes," replied Barney soberly. "Far, far better.
  But the real answer is, you won't know."</p>

  <p>"Not even when you've finished?" asked Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Probably not," said Barney, "because in my proposed school all pictures
  will be not only painted in darkness but also hung in darkness. One will be
  expected to view them in pitch blackness and to criticize accordingly. Too
  many critics of pictures are influenced by what they see rather than by what
  they don't see. That is a great mistake. Now in my school every artist will
  enjoy an equal advantage&mdash;complete invisibility. Of course there will be
  trained guides to lead people about. I've thought it all out."</p>

  <p>"To me," said Daniel, "it's about the most reasonable idea you ever
  had."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," replied Barney. "Where's the girl?"</p>

  <p>"She told me to tell you she was staying to lunch at the club with the
  rest of the gang," said Daniel, then added mendaciously, "She thought it
  would save a lot of fuss and bother in view of the doings tonight."</p>

  <p>"There's a brain for you," Barney remarked admiringly. "Thinks of
  everything and everyone. Well, it won't be long now. I beat you to it, Dan,
  old son. And there's a damn fine girl just dying to marry you. Why don't you
  do something about June, Dan? Let's all get married together. We'll be tagged
  so we won't get mixed up, as they always do at least once or twice in all
  good Franco-American farces."</p>

  <p>Daniel was beginning to feel his nerves quivering again. This was due to a
  sharp realization that perhaps never again would he and his brother be able
  to talk thus together. He rose and sought the sideboard where he poured
  himself a drink. Then he came back to the table.</p>

  <p>"I say, Barney," he began, and there was that in his voice that made
  Barney stop daubing and look up at his brother anxiously. "Listen here,
  Barney," Daniel began again, "I'm not at all sure about tonight. Do you feel
  you're doing the wisest thing? After all, you two have known each other less
  than a couple of months at the most. What I mean is, old man, you're pretty
  damn happy as you are&mdash;we've been happy together. We can keep on being
  happy&mdash;traveling and all that sort of thing. No end of possibilities.
  I'm not going to get married for a long, long time. Why not wait a while
  longer with me? There's a lot of things we can enjoy together. Don't let's go
  through with the formal announcement which actually is an open invitation to
  your wedding. Why, Barney, kid, in only a couple of weeks you'll be a married
  man! What then? Let's clear out. Let's do any-thing. Call it off, will you...
  or... or... wait a little longer. Just wait and see what happens. Give me a
  chance, Barney. We'll go right away. Just think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off with the nauseating knowledge of failure. Barney's face had
  fallen. The boy was amazed. Not unlike a too trusting pup that had been
  smitten suddenly by a cat that had led him to expect better things, he now
  looked up at his brother. Daniel's gaze was filled with a deep entreaty. Then
  he looked away. Instinctively his eyes sought the shadows.</p>

  <p>"Get yourself another drink, old boy," said Barney in a quiet voice. "I
  know how you feel, but of course you're all wrong about everything. My being
  married will make no difference at all. We can go on living just the same as
  ever and do all the things we've planned. I know how you feel. I'd feel the
  same. Don't you think I haven't thought about it myself? I have&mdash;lots.
  And of course you must marry June. The four of us will have one hell of a
  high time."</p>

  <p>"Guess you're right, Barney," said Daniel, but there was no conviction in
  his voice.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up," Barney said, and laughed light-heartedly. "Of course I'm
  right. I'm always right about everything. You've got to admit that. And
  anyway the cakes and everything are all ordered. Aunt Matty would have a
  horrible fit. She'd die, perhaps, or bust with a deafening report."</p>

  <p>Daniel nodded slowly and smiled. The Furies seemed to be jigging
  grotesquely on his grave. Reason was reeling drunkenly to bed. A crazy
  parachute was dragging him over a cliff. He would let go soon. Then the
  drop</p>

  <p>"No," he remarked. "I guess it would never do, especially now that the
  cakes have been ordered, and all that about Aunt Matty. No, Barney, we
  mustn't let her bust with a deafening report."</p>

  <p>"I merely mentioned the cakes in passing," grinned Barney, now thoroughly
  satisfied that everything was once more as he wanted it to be. "They're
  fairly good at that." He extracted one from his pocket and popped it into his
  mouth. "Fairly good but lamentably small. Crisp ! Have one. Besides we love
  each other."</p>

  <p>Daniel picked up the soiled-looking object his brother had tossed across
  the table and, after removing several adhering threads and a family gathering
  of tobacco crumbs, followed Barney's inelegant example.</p>

  <p>"There's paint on it," he said.</p>

  <p>"I know," agreed -Barney. "There's paint on all of them. Just slightly
  though."</p>

  <p>"You're going to have a swell time of it tonight," said Daniel, "if you
  don't make yourself sick on a lot of truck beforehand. I'd better speak to
  Aunt Matty about you."</p>

  <p>"No, don't," put in Barney hastily. "Leave her entirely alone. She's been
  watching me all morning as it is. And speaking of cakes, do you remember,
  Dan, when we were boys and I'd be locked in the room, how you used to put
  cakes and stuff in an old shoe and I'd pull it up to the window with a
  string? Well, ever since then I've never been able to enjoy an honestly
  acquired piece of cake. To be thoroughly enjoyable it must be pilfered."</p>

  <p>He paused and looked back on the past. Something in that old dark room
  seemed to evoke memories. He was secretly a little frightened himself about
  the party that night, and was unconsciously seeking escape in memories of the
  days when he and Daniel had been boys together.</p>

  <p>"You know, Dan," he went on wisely, "I don't think father would have been
  half as hard-boiled if mother had been alive. He must have missed her like
  the devil. . . mother... not having her and all. Just a couple of damn
  disorderly sons. I can, see things better now."</p>

  <p>From a sense of loyalty, a sensitive understanding of Daniel's position,
  Barney always included him in the hard treatment he himself had received. It
  was almost as if he were trying to justify his father and at the same time to
  let Daniel know that he understood. Then, again, it made his childhood seem a
  little less unshared.</p>

  <p>"You got all the raw deals, Barney," said Daniel, not trusting himself to
  look at his brother, the closest creature to him in all God's world. "All the
  tough breaks were yours, but the old man really wasn't like that&mdash;not
  really."</p>

  <p>The room had grown quiet now. Daniel was standing at one of the windows.
  He had parted the curtains slightly and was looking out on the lawn. Then his
  gaze lifted, and he was looking out across the lawn to the far-away
  water-rimmed edge of the sky. And he felt himself out there amidst a vast
  silence and peace. He was alone out there between the sea and the sky. He was
  alone and resting, his problem forever solved.</p>

  <p>What was he going to do about it? He shivered a little. Only too well he
  knew. He turned back to the room.</p>

  <p>He stood contemplating the small, firm, and strangely lined face of his
  brother. Suddenly it came over him that this would be in all likelihood the
  last time he would ever see him so completely happy again. He wanted to
  retain that memory... to fix it in his mind.</p>

  <p>"You're sure about tonight, then, kid?" he asked diffidently.</p>

  <p>"Sure, Daniel, dead sure," said Barney.</p>

  <p>"All right then," said Daniel. "I think I'll go and dig up June. She might
  do a little something about food. Get back to your leprous painting, Barney.
  Do your specks."</p>

  <p>But Barney did not return at once to his painting. He remained seated at
  the table running his fingers through the fine straw-colored hair that gave
  the ap, pearance of straying casually about his head. From a nut-brown face,
  prematurely old yet hauntingly attractive, a pair of large, speculative eyes,
  touched with the wisdom of a child, stared into the darkness. He was re-
  painting the years of his childhood in entirely fresh colors. He sat quite
  still, all hunched up and untidy, like an ancient gnome greedily poised above
  a bowl of fruit.</p>

  <p>Dan had been strange just now, he felt. There had been something different
  about him. He had suggested a person who was going away for a long time to
  some shut-off place.</p>

  <p>And Barney wondered why. Perhaps because of to-night, he decided. Daniel
  was all wrong. He would get over that.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">IV. &mdash; DAN'S LAST TRY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Daniel left his brother he felt as if he carried with
  him his own as well as Emily-Jane's death warrant. More than that, he felt as
  if he were holding in his hand the broken bits of happiness of several
  lives.</p>

  <p>Like a cornered animal seeking refuge, yet knowing there was no refuge, he
  stood in a state of growing panic on the long, rambling front veranda of the
  old house. He craved yet feared the comfort of June Lansing's presence.</p>

  <p>Far away on the other side of the Sound he could see a few scraps of white
  jutting up from the water like jagged teeth. A few miles out lay three
  islands, bare rocks sprawled out on the surface of the water like dragons
  resting momentarily in their slow progress seaward.</p>

  <p>Daniel knew all of those rocks intimately, their lobster-pots and the
  ashes of abandoned fires, their old tin cans and remains of rotted
  fish&mdash;unpleasant items, perhaps, until one became used to them, until
  they became familiar features and loved.</p>

  <p>Thinking of those early days of exploration with the ambitious but
  unsteady Barney, Daniel moved restlessly across the wide tree-studded lawn
  until he came to the edge of the high bluff that dropped sharply to the
  smooth white beach below. To the right of him twisted the Cliff Path leading
  to High Rock Point. At this place the bluff came to its climax&mdash;assumed
  the proportions of a full-fledged cliff, at the base of which lay a broken
  floor of rocks. There were pleasant hollows in these rocks Daniel recalled.
  Some were always filled with water a little warmer than the sea. Some were
  filled with drifting sand. Altogether an attractive haunt for children,
  lovers, and straying artists. To descend the cliff was no easy matter, but
  could be achieved by the willing of spirit and bodily activity. Most
  reasonably minded persons found their way to this watery retreat by way of
  the beach. Up from the rocks reared the bitten face of the cliff to the
  summit of High Rock Point, a conservative but adequate name. And from the
  summit of High Rock Point grew sea-loving old pine trees, scrub brush, and
  wiry bushes.</p>

  <p>High Rock Point was useful as well as ornamental. It served as a place to
  walk to, to linger at and leave behind. It was a landmark. Local residents
  were proud of it, as if that mattered a rap to the cliff. However people
  spoke well of High Rock Point and successfully managed to keep from falling
  off it, which was something.</p>

  <p>Several homes lay between the Crewes' house and the cliffs. Daniel could
  see their chimneys and gables now pointing through the green of the trees. He
  turned and looked back at his own home. Like its owner the old structure was
  friendly, brown, and rambling. It was a place of many large cool rooms and of
  many windows looking on the sea. Those in the rear gave view to an orchard
  that drifted away until stopped by the woods which bordered the marshes. A
  broad, irregular veranda virtually ran round the house and invited rest and
  contentment at any hour of the day. One could follow the breeze on that
  veranda as well as dodge the sun. On it opened at unexpected places little
  doors as well as large ones, and innumerable mysterious passageways invited
  exploration. On the ground floor no room appeared to be on a level with
  another one. In this house one was forever either stepping down into a room
  or up out of one. A large hall extended from sea view to orchard, the doors
  to this hall forming the frames of two charming pictures&mdash;the greens and
  browns and blossomings of an old orchard at the one end, while at the other,
  the blue reaches of the Sound glimpsed through a park of trees.</p>

  <p>It was a house to live in, and Daniel had lived in it nearly all the years
  of his life. Now as he considered its familiar lines he had a feeling that
  the old place had about done with him, that their long term of companionship
  was just about at an end.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," thought Daniel, "might as well look up June. She's in for a
  tough time, too."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">June Lansing watched him coming toward her across the lawn.
There was
  something radically wrong with this man, she decided. There had been
  something wrong with him for weeks. Of late he had seemed to be afraid to
  touch her. An invisible obstacle seemed to have raised itself between them.
  Yet it was not quite that. The obstacle was there for Daniel alone. He seemed
  to be exerting some inner restraint on himself. It was a hard thing to puzzle
  out, yet she could not help feeling the presence of some alien and inimical
  influence. Daniel had changed, there was no doubting that, no pretending it
  away.</p>

  <p>Ever since the arrival of Emily-Jane, Dan had begun to freeze a little, as
  if the life within him were chilled. He had more and more taken refuge in his
  own thoughts, guarding them instead of sharing them as at one time he had
  done so generously. Intuitively June associated with the dazzling appearance
  of Emily-Jane the alteration of Daniel's attitude, not only to herself but
  also to the world in general.</p>

  <p>Now she watched the long, lounging figure out of troubled eyes and
  wondered much behind her placid countenance. She felt that this lover of hers
  owed it to their mutual confidence to let her help him. At least she could
  listen to his worries, or whatever it was that was plaguing his usually
  sanguine mind. She had always heard that a good woman can help a man. Yet
  here she had a perfectly good man who would not let her help him. June wanted
  to be with Daniel in whatever he was going through. Not for a moment did she
  suspect his loyalty. Dan was all right as far as that was concerned. It was
  something else, but what?</p>

  <p>June Lansing was a loosely connected, sprawling creature, a big girl with
  big bones, but shapely withal. Unlike many of her sisters her well-developed
  bosom was no better developed than her brain. Above her ruggedly handsome
  face, sprinkled with a shower of freckles, lay interesting masses of
  flame-colored hair. She possessed a large humorous mouth capable of twisting
  itself into all sorts of eloquently expressive shapes. Her nose was fine but
  not small and her eyes, reflecting golden-brown&mdash;the shade of a proper
  ale&mdash;were flecked with little speckles, and were entirely her own. No
  other woman had eyes quite like those of June Lansing with their funny yellow
  specks.</p>

  <p>Leggily ranging back in her deck chair on the lawn, she now looked quietly
  up at Daniel standing above her. For a moment neither spoke, then Daniel
  found an aimless-sounding "Hello," which he offered her.</p>

  <p>"Is that the way? Is that the way?" she remonstrated. "Can't you manage
  something a little better than that?"</p>

  <p>"How are you, June?" he asked woodenly.</p>

  <p>"So well," she said, "I do so well that if you don't come out of your
  trance and give me a kiss I won't forget in a hurry I'll get up and give you
  such a sock with this chair that you'll go sound instead of half asleep."</p>

  <p>Then Daniel knelt down beside her and gave her a kiss that she was
  destined not to forget in a long, long time, if ever. Into it went all of his
  love and longing for this woman, his pent-up misery and desperation. It was
  almost as if he were trying to lose himself in that kiss, to hide himself in
  her. When he rose she looked at him with pleased surprise behind which lay a
  shade of fear.</p>

  <p>"Better and better," she said at last. "One would think you'd been
  deprived of a woman's kisses for years and years, and yet all the time you've
  had me. You should call more often, Dan. I like your visits."</p>

  <p>"I'm an accommodating sort of cuss," he replied, striving to appear
  cheerful, "but exclusive, as you doubtless know."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of the kind," she answered. "For instance, where have you,
  been all morning and why not at my side?"</p>

  <p>"Been at the club most of the time," he told her. "Sat out eighteen holes
  with Scott, then came home and badgered Barney. We had a talk or something
  approaching one. Since then I've been looking for you."</p>

  <p>"And I've been under your nose all the time."</p>

  <p>"I don't like the way you put things," he objected. "I don't want you
  under my nose. Rather have you under my foot. It sounds more magnificent than
  nose."</p>

  <p>"Now don't try to talk to me as you would to Barney," she said. "It's
  beyond my dim comprehension how you two lunatics ever manage to exchange
  thought. You seem to go strolling casually round the fringes of an
  intelligent conversation, then suddenly abandoning hope, seek out the nearest
  by-path to inanity. Is it that you feel obligated to amuse each other, or
  befuddle each other? He told me this morning that he suspected you were a
  mental case, but I told him you were merely growing."</p>

  <p>"I'm growing, sure enough," said Daniel. "I'm growing old at a terrific
  speed, but Barney doesn't amuse me any more, June. He's got me worried, that
  boy has."</p>

  <p>"And you've got me no less worried," she replied seriously. "You should
  let Scott Munson plumb into your mind and let in a couple of gallons of
  daylight or let out a flood of darkness. Just what is your guilty secret,
  Daniel Crewe? Out with it, man&mdash;out with it! Something is wrong with
  you, all wrong, worried, and unhappy. Don't think for a second I haven't
  known. Why don't your give me a chance? I want to help. You know&mdash;kind
  of keep in touch with current events."</p>

  <p>She stopped and her eyes opened wide as she saw the color slowly drain
  away beneath his tan and noticed that for the first time since she had known
  him his eyes refused to meet hers.</p>

  <p>"Guilty secret?" he repeated, laughing a trifle tin-steadily. "Guilty,
  June? Why, I have no guilty secret. And as for Scott Munson, I haven't joined
  the criminal class... yet. Not yet. Not yet. Not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly when he realized he was needlessly repeating that
  crazy phrase. There was a tightness about his throat and a hot, empty
  sensation at the pit of his stomach. So it was already apparent, his guilt.
  He was branded before the deed. Good God ! And Munson had seen it, too. Even
  Barney had looked at him queerly. He found a handkerchief and applied it to
  his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Hot, isn't it?" he said, but June did not answer. "Or is it?" he added
  lamely.</p>

  <p>"Look at me, Daniel," commanded June.</p>

  <p>She said no more but strove to hold him with her golden-brown eyes. She
  seemed to be trying to draw from his brain the trouble that was there, for
  now she realized that there was something seriously wrong with Daniel,
  something that threatened their happiness. "Go on, Dan," she said at length.
  "Tell me."</p>

  <p>"No, June, really," he replied, endeavoring to drive off the suspicions he
  feared were forming in her thoughts. "Honestly, old thing, there's nothing.
  What could there be? It's just Barney. I'm worried about him&mdash;about
  Barney and this girl. Barney's an awful kid, after all, while
  Emily-Jane&mdash;well, she's quite a catch, I suppose, isn't she?" He broke
  off lamely and looked hopefully at June.</p>

  <p>"Is she?" asked that young lady. "Is she, Dan? What do you think,
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Of course she's wonderful and all that," he replied. "I know everyone's
  strong for her, but for some reason I don't quite fancy seeing Barney
  attached to such a luminary, if you get what I mean."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," said June, dryly. "And a little more. I get that you think
  Emily-Jane is a lovely girl, but&mdash;you'd do anything in the world to get
  rid of her."</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly and looked searchingly at Daniel, who in turn was
  looking at her with the fascination of horror. Deep in his eyes she saw
  something&mdash;what was it? What was it she saw there? It was furtive and
  dangerously driven, an expression she had never seen in the eyes of any man.
  And it was because she knew and loved this man so well, was so close to him
  in thought as well as emotion, that the terrible idea had come to her. From
  where did it come?</p>

  <p>"You'd do anything to get rid of her," she repeated slowly and as if to
  herself. "Anything in the world." Her hands flew out and gripped him by the
  shoulders. She held him roughly. He could feel the strength of her fingers
  through his coat. "Oh, Dan, Dan!" she said.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what do you mean, June?" he faltered. "What do you see?"</p>

  <p>She gave him a push and laughed. It sounded a trifle strained. "A touch of
  sun," she said. "Daniel, I believe you'd love to see Barney married to a
  younger edition of Aunt Matty?"</p>

  <p>Daniel's smile was a little more natural this time. "He could do a lot
  worse," he admitted. "The two of them get along quite happily together what
  with her constant recriminations and preoccupation with food. A younger
  edition of Aunt Matty is just what Barney needs."</p>

  <p>June Lansing did not seem to be listening. Her eyes were leveled on the
  water. What was she thinking? What suspicion had suddenly come into her mind?
  June's silence was making him nervous.</p>

  <p>"Dan," she asked at last, her voice steady, casual, only slightly
  interested, "did you ever know Emily-Jane when you were at college?"</p>

  <p>"Never knew her... met her... danced with her... that sort of thing...
  heard of her, of course," Daniel succeeded in jerking out, with a fairly
  convincing assumption of indifference.</p>

  <p>"And what did you hear?" she continued.</p>

  <p>"Oh, just the usual thing. Nothing that mattered one way or the
  other."</p>

  <p>"Delightfully vague and uninforming," murmured June. "Tell me, Dan, did
  Sam Stoughten also know her?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so. Why?" replied Daniel quickly, "What made you ask
  that, June?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing in particular," said June easily, "but a good many things in
  general. A few weeks ago I saw them together when they had every reason to
  believe they were unobserved. Sam looked as if he were being confronted by a
  ghost, and a most unpleasant ghost, at that. But you know how Sam is with
  women," she continued on a note of reassurance. "He's never entirely
  comfortable except when Sue's around."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," agreed Daniel. "Sam never was much of a ladies' man. He's a
  faithful old soul. Loyal to a fault, poor devil. Next to Barney&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why `poor devil'?" interrupted June.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Daniel. "Just thinking back, I suppose. He lost out a
  lot in college, but he never envied his friends."</p>

  <p>"And tonight you announce the glad tidings," observed June for no apparent
  reason.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dan. "That's just it&mdash;the glad tidings. If you ask me
  it's all a lot of nonsense. Everyone knows they're engaged already. It's just
  an excuse to throw a party, as I look at it. And this stuff about switching
  off the lights for a minute just before the announcement&mdash;why that? All
  damn rot."</p>

  <p>"That," said June, "was not Emily-Jane's idea. It came from some member of
  the club crowd. A group of her admirers are going to present her with the
  most gorgeous Japanese kimono you ever dreamed about."</p>

  <p>"That well may be," replied Daniel. "I never dreamed about a Japanese
  kimono."</p>

  <p>"Well you will when you see this one," went on June. "When the lights
  flash on, there it will be presto&mdash;all spread out on the table.
  Emily-Jane has many friends. Are you one of them, Daniel?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Daniel, striving to put a hearty note into his voice.
  "Of course, June. You know that as well as I do. She's all right. It's just
  about Barney, that's all. Emily-Jane shouldn't marry Barney. She shouldn't do
  it. Of all the men in the world, why did she have to pick out him? I've
  nothing against the girl. Nothing."</p>

  <p>Silence once more fell between them. Both were occupied with thoughts too
  delicate or dangerous to be expressed. Furtively June was studying the tense,
  drawn face of the man she loved. A feeling of tenderness so poignant it was
  painful to bear came over her for him sitting there alone with all his lies
  and trouble.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Daniel," she said, and held out her arms to him. "Come here
  and put your head down on this businesslike bosom of mine. It was made for
  just such a head as yours, big, empty, and, oh, so dumb."</p>

  <p>Then Daniel knelt down beside her and his head was on her breast. On the
  green of the lawn and the blue of the open sky his eyes closed wearily. What
  had beauty to do with him? And he rested there. It was a moment of drifting
  peace. Perhaps the last one he would ever know. From her body came comfort
  and a sense of things, of life and what had been. How tired he was. How
  damned uselessly tired. Was there a chance that even now he could find
  another way out?</p>

  <p>"Some day," he said in a low voice, "some day, June, things will be all
  jake, won't they? We'll be all right, what? All of us? I'm worried, June,
  that's all. It's hell to have a damn fool brother."</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," she answered. "I know, Dan."</p>

  <p>His weakness was so unlike him it struck her like a physical hurt. At that
  moment she would have done anything&mdash;given herself to him&mdash;just to
  have eased his mind. Anything to have kept him from thinking. Somehow she was
  going through with it. Even in the dark she would not leave Daniel alone.</p>

  <p>This resolution formed she lifted his head and kissed him on both
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hit the deck, sailor," she said. "Let's go and drag some food from Aunt
  Matty. She reluctantly hinted that there might be some sandwiches and tea for
  luncheon. You need food."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Daniel had eaten and gone to his room, which held a corner
position in the
  right wing of the house, if the rambling old dwelling could be said to have
  anything so conventional as wings. All the windows were filled with trees and
  with the Sound. The one at the side gave a long view of the Cliff Path and a
  glimpse of the orchard. Across the hall from him was Lane Holt's room, while
  directly next to his own was the room occupied by Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>Daniel was standing now at the side window. He was idly contemplating the
  stout old limb of a tree. For him that limb had friendly associations. Ever
  since he could remember it had been trying to get in through the window as if
  curious to see what the room looked like inside. Many times as a boy he had
  climbed out along that inquisitive old branch and thus reached the ground. He
  had taught Barney to make use of this convenient exit, but only after several
  hairbreadth escapes. Barney had always climbed with too much confidence. He
  had proceeded as if he expected something always to be where he was, and when
  that something failed him Barney came to grief.</p>

  <p>Daniel turned from the window and his thoughts. Restlessly he paced the
  room. Every now and then he turned his head as if looking for something.
  Suddenly, he stopped dead still in his tracks. His chin went up, and he stood
  there waiting, thinking rapidly. Then he took a quick glance at his watch and
  left the room. The hall was empty. Taking a key from his pocket he let
  himself into the room next to his and quickly closed the door. Slowly his
  eyes traveled round the room. Now where would a person hide a packet of
  letters? Surely it would be under lock and key. Her trunk was locked.
  Hopeless. His long hands slid searchingly between the clothes in the bureau
  drawers. He turned to the suitcase and opened it. The letters couldn't be
  here. They weren't. He ran to the closet and flung open its door. Another
  bag. Daniel snatched it out and opened it. Quick, delving fingers. Nothing.
  Nothing! Goddamn ! They must be in the trunk and that was locked. If he could
  only find those letters there still might be another way out. Once more he
  began to search the room.</p>

  <p>On the bureau stood an antique box fashioned to resemble a row of books.
  Emily-Jane had brought it with her. It was a fairly common specimen. Daniel
  had seen them before, but to Emily-Jane it had probably seemed an exceedingly
  secretive hiding place. He slid back the base of the box and pressed the
  center volume. In a moment the thing was open. No letters of Sam's, but three
  of his own and two addressed to him by Emily-Jane. Years ago she had cleverly
  regained possession of her own letters. He took them all and slipped them
  into an inside vest pocket.</p>

  <p>Light feet falling in the hall outside. Coming closer. Daniel turned
  calmly and faced the door. He was leaning against the side of the open window
  when she entered.</p>

  <p>"I've been waiting for you," he lied effectively. "Come in and shut the
  door. Lock it."</p>

  <p>Emily-Jane without a word did just that. Her eyes swept the room and
  discovered that nothing had been disturbed. Daniel had been careful. He had
  even taken the precaution of substituting a few business letters for those
  that had been in the box.</p>

  <p>It was as well he had done so. Still without speaking she crossed the room
  to the bureau. Her hands idly shook the box, then she turned back satisfied.
  Peeling off her jersey, she stood before him half nude, a silken band across
  her breasts.</p>

  <p>"Well, Daniel," she said. "You've got yourself into this mess. Now get
  yourself out of it. My brain is quicker than yours, and Barney is at the foot
  of the stairs. If I call for Lane Holt he'll swear to anything. He's in his
  room now. Let's talk business. What's the bright idea?"</p>

  <p>She searched for a cigarette, found one, lighted it, and seated herself on
  the bed. Daniel turned to the window to conceal the murder that blazed from
  his eyes. When he faced the girl once more he had regained his composure.</p>

  <p>"Emily-Jane," he said, "I've come in here to ask you to call it off. You
  have a chance now to do a good thing, a kind thing. Do it, won't you? I'm
  licked. Give me Sam's letters and chuck Barney. Let me look after him."</p>

  <p>"That would listen better from the bed," she replied coolly. "Come over
  here and sit down." Obediently he seated himself beside her. She flung a
  careless arm round his neck and blew a cloud of smoke in his face. "Now kiss
  me," she said.</p>

  <p>"Will you give me those letters, Emily-Jane?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"It's as much for your sake as ours I am asking."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie, Daniel, dear."</p>

  <p>"Money?" he suggested huskily. "For a great deal of money, Emily-Jane,
  will you?"</p>

  <p>"No, you fool. I'll get money and more. I can get all yours and his too if
  I want it. No, Daniel, I'm incorruptible. I'm far above money."</p>

  <p>"Oh, for God's sake, Emily-Jane," he pleaded, "don't go through with it.
  Give me those letters and lay off of Barney. Won't you, won't you,
  Emily-Jane?"</p>

  <p>It was not an agreeable sight to see this big, hulking creature pleading
  thus with the girl. He had swallowed his pride. He was willing to go down on
  his knees to her.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "I won't."</p>

  <p>Then Daniel did go down on his knees before the girl.</p>

  <p>"Those letters," he said in a voice so low she could scarcely hear him. "I
  ask you now here on my knees to give them to me and to give up Barney. Think,
  Emily-Jane, think. You've got the chance now. Won't you take it? Please. I
  ask you."</p>

  <p>For answer she tossed away her cigarette and crushed his face against her
  breast. Then she suddenly released him and sprang up, laughing
  tauntingly.</p>

  <p>"Get up from there," she jeered. "You're making a tragic ass of yourself.
  Come over here and help me off with my shoes."</p>

  <p>She sank into a deep chair and extended her neat, slim legs. With lowered
  head as if stunned, Daniel got slowly off his knees. He felt heavy and dead
  as he turned to the door and fumbled with the key. A few swift strides
  brought her beside him, and he stood there a moment looking down at her in a
  dull, abstracted manner. Even now the voice of his pleading would not be
  stilled.</p>

  <p>"No?" he said. "Won't you?"</p>

  <p>As he opened the door she once more threw one bare arm round his shoulder.
  Then she laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, you're a glutton for punishment, Dan," she said. "Sorry you have to
  leave so soon. Call again."</p>

  <p>The door closed on her mocking voice. Daniel was in the hall. He turned
  with hands hanging and came in contact with a figure that was standing
  perfectly still &mdash;frozen. The figure swayed slightly.</p>

  <p>"Dan?" his name came in a whisper. "Dan?"</p>

  <p>He took June's arms in his hands just above the elbows. In the dim light
  of the hall he. stooped and peered into her face. Then he shook his head
  slowly. Neither spoke. Again he peered down at her and shook his head.
  Releasing his hold on her arms he walked quietly down the hall and entered
  his room. The door closed.</p>

  <p>Alone in the hall June Lansing stood looking at the door to Emily-Jane's
  room. All the warmth had gone out of her ale-golden eyes. They were cold
  spots now, cold, hard, and bright. Then she, too, walked quietly down the
  hall, entered her room and closed the door.</p>

  <p>From the shadow of an alcove used for trunks, Betty, the maid, emerged and
  went thoughtfully about her appointed tasks. It took all sorts of people to
  make the world, thought she, but here indeed was a pretty kettle of fish.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">V. &mdash; THE SEARCHING BLADE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOMETHING was going to happen that night. Already things
  were going on, secret things in that old house. Scott Munson, slipping into
  his black robe, felt it in his bones. What was he going to do about it? How
  head this off? That well-known ounce of prevention&mdash;where could he find
  it? Should he keep his eye on Daniel or concentrate on Sam Stoughten? Should
  he divide his attention between the two? From his knowledge of men both had
  reached a dangerous pitch of desperation. Or would it be better to watch
  Emily-Jane, the object on which that desperation centered&mdash;the source of
  it?</p>

  <p>To work on a case before it had actually broken was a new experience to
  Scott Munson. He sat down in a chair by the open window and looked out at the
  dark night. Perhaps he had read his characters wrong this time. Perhaps he
  had read into them meanings that were not there. Munson had no particular
  fondness for Emily-Jane. In fact, he considered her a beautiful but
  unpleasant little hypocrite, but surely she was not capable of creating all
  the strain and concealed animosity that were disturbing the atmosphere like a
  palpable thing. On the other hand why wasn't she? In the forty years of his
  life he had seen the most insignificant women accomplish disasters far out of
  proportion to their individual importance.</p>

  <p>That little byplay about letters between Emily-Jane and Sam Stoughten on
  the club-house veranda&mdash;what, if anything, was the meaning of that? Now
  was the time for someone to come out into the open and to speak a piece in no
  uncertain words. But the trouble was people seldom spoke at the right time
  and always at the wrong.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson felt that if Daniel would only tell him what was on his mind
  matters could be straightened out. Daniel, he feared, no less than Sam
  Stoughten and everyone else involved, was exaggerating the seriousness of
  some situation to the proportions of a tragedy. If properly staged and
  directed it might well be turned into a farce, or at least brought to the
  level of plausibility. People did not react that way, however, under certain
  given circumstances. The situation itself had taken control, and the actors
  were merely following directions bereft of reason and volition.</p>

  <p>Well, if things must be they must, he supposed. Perhaps it was written and
  could not be deleted. If people perversely insisted on making a hash of their
  lives there was little that he could do to stop them. Then a wave of human
  emotion for a moment smothered the cool, impersonal logic of Scott Munson.
  These people were his friends, and this old house itself was too homelike and
  friendly to be the scene of some stupid but irreparable tragedy. But damn it
  all, why were his thoughts constantly dwelling on tragedy even before a
  tragedy had occurred? There was a feeling in the air, or was he just giving
  rein to his imagination? That was not like him. Some mischief must be
  afoot.</p>

  <p>He rose, dropped the black hood over his head, and left the room. In the
  hall he saw Sam Stoughten entering Daniel's room. Sam was robed but not
  hooded. The expression on his ruddy, homely face was anything but
  festive.</p>

  <p>"The uniform of the evening seems highly appropriate," mused Scott as he
  passed down the hall. "I'd give a lot to hear the conversation between those
  two gentlemen."</p>

  <p>He paused, then shook his head, and swiftly descended the stairs.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Sam sat down on Daniel's bed and looked at him. There was a
mute inquiry
  in his mild blue eyes, an expression suggestive of a decent-spirited dog, one
  that wanted something very badly but was too considerate to ask for it
  outright. Daniel turned from the mirror and regarded the slightly upturned
  face. Then he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "I found mine, Sam&mdash;only mine."</p>

  <p>"No," repeated Sam as if trying to puzzle out the exact meaning of the
  word. "Glad you found yours, though."</p>

  <p>Neither spoke again. Daniel turned back to the mirror and brushed a hand
  across his face. Ten years seemed to have been added to his face since he had
  left Emily-Jane's room. He was trying to brush them away. It was fortunate
  they were wearing hoods.... All men would look alike tonight.</p>

  <p>Sam rose from the bed and stood with idly swinging arms.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't matter," he said. "I just dropped in to ask. Be getting back to
  Sue now. She'll be waiting. You're looking tired, Dan."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm all right," said the other. "Have a drink?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Sam.</p>

  <p>Daniel swung up a bottle from the floor beside the bureau, and they drank
  the whisky neat. Their eyes met as they put down their glasses. A lifetime of
  associations mutually shared passed between them.</p>

  <p>"I tried," said Daniel. "She caught me at it, but I don't think she
  suspected. They must be locked in her trunk. Couldn't go that."</p>

  <p>"That girl's a devil, Daniel."</p>

  <p>"She's not so good, Sam."</p>

  <p>"And she's got the two of us, not to mention young Barney."</p>

  <p>"Wish she were a man, Sambo."</p>

  <p>"Don't see where that makes a hell of a lot of difference." There was a
  new note of hardness in Sam Stoughten's voice. "After a woman has passed a
  certain limit she has no sex."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met searchingly, but not frankly, then looked away. Daniel
  turned back to the mirror for no reason at all. He was tired of his face.</p>

  <p>"We were damn fools, Daniel," went on Stoughten, in a voice that seemed to
  be summarizing the past before writing <i>finis</i>. "But I was the
  damnedest. It was all my fault, old man. I dragged you in."</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Daniel, reaching for the bottle. "Have a drink."</p>

  <p>"I had one."</p>

  <p>"Have two."</p>

  <p>They drank neat again and larger.</p>

  <p>"Somehow it doesn't make me feel so good," observed Sam in gentle
  complaint. "I used to love to get drunk."</p>

  <p>Daniel grinned. "And you did, Sam. You did. As a lord&mdash;as a whole
  houseful of lords, in fact."</p>

  <p>"Not going to get drunk tonight," announced Sam. "Must keep a clear
  head."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Daniel curiously.</p>

  <p>"The occasion calls for it," said Sam. "One should keep a clear head
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"You're not going to make some sort of a damn fool of yourself, are you,
  Sam?"</p>

  <p>Once more their eyes studied each other.</p>

  <p>"I've stopped making a damn fool of myself," said Sam deliberately. "I
  might make myself something else, Dan, but not a damn fool."</p>

  <p>Dan was across the room and had seized Sam's thick wrists. Sam refused to
  look up. He stood there stolidly.</p>

  <p>"Look at me, Sam," commanded Daniel. "This is my show. Understand that. My
  show entirely. You go back to Sue and stick by her. That's your show, your
  job. Stick by Sue."</p>

  <p>"And let us all drift to hell, I suppose," said Sam. "Misery loves
  company," replied Daniel.</p>

  <p>"There should be one member less," said Sam. Daniel released his grip. Sam
  looked up and laughed a little recklessly. "I don't know what we're talking
  about, Dan," he said, "but don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.
  Watch and see."</p>

  <p>"I shall," said Dan grimly.</p>

  <p>At the door Sam paused and looked back. "And, Dan," he added, "I want to
  thank you for all you've done in the past and for what you just tried to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Remember," called Daniel as the door was slowly closing, "don't be a damn
  fool, Sam."</p>

  <p>"Not a chance," came Sam's voice.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A pair of slim provocative legs flashed clown the hall.
Emily-Jane seemed
  all legs. There was a skirt, a suggestion of a skirt. Some sort of
  momentarily interrupting flare of flounce, after which Emily-Jane continued
  once more somewhere in the region where the vertebrae either end or begin
  their business of being a spine, and up swept the beautiful back of
  Emily-Jane to her pert little neck and sleek golden, hair. She was every bit
  as good in front&mdash;or nearly.</p>

  <p>Emily-Jane intended to show the world just how lucky a man Barney really
  was. It looked as if she would experience little difficulty in establishing
  her point. She was supposed to be something along the general lines of a
  ballet dancer.</p>

  <p>The legs carried what remained of her to June Lansing's door, upon which
  she tapped lightly, then entered unbidden.</p>

  <p>June looked up from the brilliant buckle she was attaching to her pump.
  Emily-Jane failed to detect the slightest sign of welcome in June's eyes, but
  a little thing like that meant nothing to Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>"I thought we'd go down together," she remarked. "How do I do?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, as usual," said June. "You know that even better than I."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad you think so just the same," replied the other.</p>

  <p>"Emily-Jane," said June, having affixed the buckle and disappeared into
  some sort of milkmaid's costume, "Emily-Jane, you don't give a damn what I
  think, and you know it."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I know it, but it's much pleasanter to pretend," came the cool
  response of Emily-Jane. "We're slated to be sisters-in-law, you know. Don't
  you think we'll make a happy family?"</p>

  <p>"No," said June, with equal candor, "I don't. For some reason Daniel hates
  you, and you have some sort of a hold on him. I don't know what it's all
  about, but I do know that things aren't right. The best I can do is to
  suspect that you are playing poor Barney for a gull. What is all this between
  you and Dan? Why doesn't someone speak? I feel as if I were playing blind
  man's buff with an electric fan. What was he doing in your room today?"</p>

  <p>Emily-Jane smiled wisely.</p>

  <p>"All men are creatures of impulse," she answered. "Daniel is no exception.
  For the intimate details I refer you to him."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't gall me at all, Emily-Jane," June replied easily. "He was in
  your room for something, but you were the last thing in the world he wanted.
  I know that. What I don't know is just what is behind. it all. That's what I
  want you to tell me."</p>

  <p>"Once more I refer you to Daniel," said Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'd be asking you if I hadn't already asked him?" replied
  June. "He won't say a word and he's worried gray about something. What is it,
  Emily-Jane? Help me out in this, and I'll try to make a go of things. It's a
  business proposition."</p>

  <p>"One which I neither need nor care to accept," said Emily-Jane. "I'll make
  a go of things without your help. Apart from that I don't know what you're
  talking about. Are you nearly ready to go down?"</p>

  <p>There was an ominous expression in the eyes that met those of Emily-Jane.
  "You're going to marry Barney?" asked June.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>"And nothing is going to stop you?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing that I can see."</p>

  <p>"Then God help you is all I can say," said June. "Something tells me it
  won't ever come off."</p>

  <p>"Then God help all of you," replied Emily-Jane. "You'll need Him."</p>

  <p>"I say that, too," answered June. "I'm ready now. Let's go."</p>

  <p>Together they left the room, Emily-Jane triumphant. Seeing them together
  it would have been difficult to detect that they were not the best of
  friends.</p>

  <p>At the head of the stairs they masked and descended hand in hand. A lovely
  picture they made. In June's loose clasp Emily-Jane's hand lay
  unresponsive.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Bodies caught and swayed in a flood of music. Beautiful
women, beautifully
  bare, disturbingly perfumed. Laughing couples along the rambling veranda,
  thirsty ones around the punch bowl. All the men in black dominoes and hoods.
  The hoods were easily lifted. Tonight the old house was seeing a bit of life.
  It was stepping out. Being gay for Barney.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of me?" Emily-Jane asked that rather dazed young
  man.</p>

  <p>Barney surveyed her from head to foot. "One doesn't have to think about
  you," he observed. "One knows at a glance. You're all there. Degas should be
  with us."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" she asked quickly. "Do I know him?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently not," said Barney. "Neither do I."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Barney," Emily-Jane told him. "With me at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," he replied. "Shall we indulge in a partial assault?"</p>

  <p>Barney failed to notice the swift glance she cast about her as if seeking
  relief. Where the devil was Lane? No thrill in dancing with this crazy
  creature who was constantly making uncomfortable observations&mdash;the more
  uncomfortable because there was always a grain of truth in them in spite of
  their ambiguity.</p>

  <p>The fact of the matter was that hardly a dozen guests had arrived before
  Barney began to wonder when everybody was going home. He did not hold with
  this party. It was too big and noisy. One never could find anyone who was not
  going somewhere or doing something. Everybody was so busy, so heady. He
  wondered if the swirling couples were happy, or if they just imagined they
  were having a good time. Perhaps they were, but damned if he could see it.
  And he was still young. What was wrong with him? Why was he not like these
  other perspiring and persistent young men who were constantly clutching at
  someone and making such a business of having a good time? He did like to
  dance with Emily-Jane though. She was different. She was heavenly.</p>

  <p>"All right, then," she said, reluctantly yielding to the situation. "Come
  on. Let's try."</p>

  <p>"Let's not try," objected Barney. "Let's damn well do it."</p>

  <p>They were in the midst of things now, twisting, swaying, jerking, gliding,
  doing all manner of surprising and inexplicable movements. It was all very
  odd, people disporting themselves in such a way. But he did enjoy dancing
  with Emily-Jane. She made it a point to see that he liked it, and Barney was
  only human. Emily-Jane's body was pleasant to hold, particularly when in
  motion. She could cling without interfering, and before the dance was over he
  had begun to think he really knew how. But that was the last dance he had
  with her that night.</p>

  <p>Lane Holt was on hand to claim the next one. Then Emily-Jane really did
  dance. Lane was worth it. He knew his stuff. Tall, graceful, perfectly
  poised, he carried her smoothly over the floor and away from the bemused
  Barney.</p>

  <p>"I've been invited to join a party," said Lane, "after this show is
  over."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have?" answered Emily-Jane. "Going?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he replied. "You're being so damned discreet."</p>

  <p>"We might take a walk," she observed, "after the household has dug in.
  Can't tell what I will do after I've had a few more glasses of that
  punch."</p>

  <p>"Under those circumstances the party's off," said</p>

  <p>Lane, his arm tightening round her supple body. "Easy there, Lane,"
  breathed Emily-Jane. "Turn those lips away. This isn't an exhibition dance.
  Be nice. Be nice."</p>

  <p>"I'll be nice" said Holt. "Let's try the veranda."</p>

  <p>"Punch first," she answered. "It's a warm night."</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't mind it," replied Holt, sweeping her trim body with
  caressing eyes.</p>

  <p>And so the dance went on. Barney at loose ends wandered purposelessly
  about, looking speculatively at hooded figures and wondering which one was
  Dan.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was Emily-Jane who found him. He was sitting in his room
by the window,
  looking out into the dark, moist night. His hood was off and his head rested
  wearily back against the chair. From below came the strains of the orchestra.
  Voices floated up from the lawn.</p>

  <p>Emily-Jane entered quietly and stood looking at him for a few seconds
  before he became aware of her presence.</p>

  <p>"Snap out of it, Dan," she said. "It's time now to go down and welcome me
  to your family."</p>

  <p>No more pleading from Daniel. He realized the futility of trying to move
  this girl.</p>

  <p>"You're going through with it then?" was all he said.</p>

  <p>"Right now. Pronto," replied Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>He walked toward the door, but she did not move. She stood in his way, her
  young body tense. He looked down at her and her lips parted. An invitation
  lay in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dan," she said, her voice low and commanding. "Look, Dan. Here I am.
  Don't be such a prig."</p>

  <p>"Prig?" he replied hoarsely. "I wonder what you'd call a cheat."</p>

  <p>She moved out of his way and they left the room. Thus did Emily-Jane lead
  her sacrifice to the slaughter.</p>

  <p>The dancing floor was now sprinkled with tables. Everywhere food was in
  evidence. Also Aunt Matty. Hoods were off and mouths open. Barney was eating
  sandwiches with relief. It was something to do. Daniel without a word dragged
  him away from a fresh supply and lined him up against the heavy portires
  that cut off the library from the main reception room.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget the lights," excitedly whispered a charming young thing in
  hardly enough to describe.</p>

  <p>"I had," smiled Daniel, looking down kindly at the lively little upturned
  face. "Run along, baby, and get ready to do your stuff."</p>

  <p>"It'll be on a table right in front of you, Dan," she said
  worshipfully.</p>

  <p>"Very good," replied Daniel, nodding approvingly.</p>

  <p>Then he sought Sam Stoughten, who was looking anything but happy at the
  side of his wife Sue. She was overheated but still game. They were not
  passionately fond of dancing, these two. With them a little was almost more
  than enough. Where all the new steps came from, and why, was an unsolved
  puzzle to them.</p>

  <p>"Sam," said Daniel, "will you go into the library and switch off the
  lights when you hear a high treble and probably inarticulate voice make a
  noise in your direction?"</p>

  <p>Sam disappeared into the other room.</p>

  <p>"He's been the very devil tonight," complained Sue.</p>

  <p>"He's teething, perhaps," smiled Daniel, and went in search of Barney,
  who, having grown tired of standing by himself, had drifted away to see what
  the salad was all about. This time Emily-Jane accompanied them back to the
  curtain, round which was the only cleared space in the room. Daniel had taken
  up his position on the left of the fair creature. Barney had tacked himself
  on her right. This was all very strange, he decided. All very uncalled
  for.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson, his eyes fixed on the group, stood poised alertly as if
  trying to fix the situation in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Friends," began Daniel unexpectedly, and at the sound of his voice the
  room grew quiet, "I suppose it's no use trying to keep it a secret any
  longer. Emily-Jane, here, has for some unaccountable reason consented to
  marry this brother of mine. Hence all the rejoicing. Let's drink what we can
  grab and wish them happiness and a long life."</p>

  <p>"Lights out, Sam," cried a high treble voice. "Lights out."</p>

  <p>As the lights flashed out Daniel's ankle turned slightly on an uneven spot
  on the floor. He lurched against Emily-Jane, who lurched against Barney.</p>

  <p>"What the hell?" said Barney. "Is this a free for all?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, Sambo," called the little voice through the darkness. "Only a
  minute now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" muttered Daniel suddenly.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Dan?" called Barney. "Where are you, old man?"</p>

  <p>Daniel did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Dan! Dan!" cried his brother.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, kid. Stand by," Daniel's words came in a whisper.</p>

  <p>Emily-Jane ran her hand up Daniel's arm. There was a sharp cry in the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake put on those lights," a man's voice called.</p>

  <p>"We're ready now, Sambo," came the high treble. "You can turn on the
  lights."</p>

  <p>"Right," came the voice of Stoughten, and the room was promptly flooded
  with diffused radiance.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson took a quick step forward, blotting Emily-Jane from view of
  the others, and with a pocket handkerchief wiped the blood from Emily-Jane's
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Say nothing," he muttered. "Go and admire that damn kimono."</p>

  <p>He looked into the library. Sam was turning away from the switch. "Sam,"
  he said quietly, "one moment."</p>

  <p>Sam came to him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Walk upstairs with Daniel, will you?" Munson said. "Take Barney with
  you."</p>

  <p>The three men left the room. Then Scott Munson, taking advantage of the
  general interest aroused by the kimono, walked back of the curtain and
  carefully withdrew a long knife. There was blood upon the blade. Holding it
  so as not to smudge the hilt, he walked through the library, entered the hall
  and ran quickly upstairs.</p>

  <p>Below in the reception room Emily-Jane was strutting magnificently in her
  gorgeous Japanese kimono.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">VI. &mdash; DEATH TAKES STEPS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MUNSON paused a moment before Daniel's door and listened.
  Two persons were speaking, but he could hardly distinguish between their
  voices. He knew that one was Daniel's, but which? Then suddenly for the first
  time he realized the remarkable similarity in the voices of the erstwhile
  roommates, Sam Stoughten and Daniel Crewe. During their four years at college
  one of them had either consciously or unconsciously taken on the vocal
  expression and mannerisms of the other.</p>

  <p>"Soft pedal that stuff," Daniel was saying, as Munson entered without
  knocking. "After all, you did make a damn fool of yourself, but things could
  have been worse."</p>

  <p>Appearing not to have caught the full significance of what Daniel had just
  said, Munson swiftly crossed the room. Opening one of the smaller drawers in
  the bureau, he unconcernedly tossed out its contents. Collars and
  handkerchiefs, incontinently bereft of their accustomed shelter, found
  themselves on the floor.</p>

  <p>"I say," cried Barney, sitting on the bed by his brother, "Daniel here has
  just been wounded, perhaps mortally, and you barge in and start a rough
  house. Why that?"</p>

  <p>Munson merely smiled somewhat grimly and holding up the knife, still wet
  with blood, deliberately dropped it in the deflowered drawer, locking it and
  pocketing the key. Both Daniel and Stoughten watched him moodily from the
  bed.</p>

  <p>Maintaining a preoccupied silence, Munson turned and keenly inspected
  Daniel, noting the drawn lines in his pale face. Sam had risen and was
  attempting to remove his wounded friend's garments. Barney was doing futile
  things with his hands. Munson seemed to be totally unimpressed by the fact
  that Daniel had just been stabbed, an attempt made on his life.</p>

  <p>"Just where did he get it?" he demanded shortly.</p>

  <p>"In the arm, Scott," said Daniel apologetically. "At least I think so.
  Feels more or less that way."</p>

  <p>Still Munson did not move.</p>

  <p>"You should know if anyone," he remarked. "Do you realize that I did my
  best to prevent all this? And do you further realize that the Scott Munson
  you have known is now gone? From now on I am out to get someone anyone who
  attempts to arrange matters through a stupid and, I say, cruel recourse to
  bloodshed and brutality. I gave you all a chance, and you've treated me like
  a damn fool. I'm not a nice man."</p>

  <p>Sam Stoughten flinched at his words. Barney only looked slightly amazed.
  But Daniel regarded him out of stolid, indifferent eyes.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime you're going to let me bleed to death so you'll have a
  nice little murder on your hands to solve," he answered bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you won't die quite yet," said Munson, "although that stab was
  intended to murder... someone. And that someone was not necessarily you,
  Daniel."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room quickly, and brushing Barney aside, ran his hand along
  the sleeve of Daniel's domino. Looking at his fingers he found them red with
  blood.</p>

  <p>"A nice piece of work," he observed in a cold, impersonal voice. "Well
  conceived, but poorly executed. And it would be the left arm. Tell me one
  thing. After the lights went out did you move at all from your places?"</p>

  <p>"We all seemed to lurch," replied Barney innocently. "Not much, but I know
  we lurched."</p>

  <p>"That explains the mistake," said Munson, addressing his remark to
  Sam.</p>

  <p>Stoughten turned red and refused to meet his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sam," continued Munson, "let's do our best to correct the error.
  Snap to it! If Dr. Manning is not too drunk by this time get him up here. If
  he is, telephone to Woods at the village. Use the phone in the pantry and
  don't shout. Barney, do something else with your hands. Sit on them. Put them
  in your pockets. Go over by the window and take a chair. Try to think exactly
  what happened after the lights went out. And, Sam," added Munson, "I want
  June Lansing. Send her here quietly, but quickly."</p>

  <p>He had already stripped off Daniel's domino, coat, and vest. With a pair
  of nail scissors, snatched from the bureau, he deftly cut away the crimson
  sleeve and laid the wound bare. Casting one dismayed glance at the wound,
  from which the blood was freely welling, Stoughten hastened from the room,
  but not before he heard Munson remark, "Suppose it had found your back,
  Daniel, where would you be now?"</p>

  <p>Munson found a towel and twisted it tightly round Daniel's arm. "Faint?"
  he asked in a slightly kinder voice.</p>

  <p>"A trifle light, Scott," admitted Daniel. He hesitated a moment, then
  continued with an appealing glance at the impassive face of Munson; "I
  suppose you couldn't forget all this, Scott? For old times' sake couldn't you
  let it drop?"</p>

  <p>Munson looked at him thoughtfully. "Dan," he said, "you're not talking to
  a friend now, but to one whose offer of help you deliberately rejected. But
  maybe I could let it drop officially if this is the worst&mdash;the end."</p>

  <p>Hearing the word "end," Barney turned from the window and looked
  tragically at the pair on the bed. "My God, Scott," he faltered, "what's all
  this talk about the end? Is Dan really in a bad way?"</p>

  <p>"You should be locked up, Barney," replied Munson gravely. "Locked up or
  deported."</p>

  <p>"But I had no hand in the affair," protested Barney.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sorry," Munson rejoined sarcastically. "I was sure you had."</p>

  <p>"Don't let him kid you, Barney," advised his brother weakly.</p>

  <p>"Then you know who did do it." Munson's easy voice had grown suddenly
  hard.</p>

  <p>Barney looked startled.</p>

  <p>"Lay off Barney," said Daniel. "He's not in on this. None of us knows a
  thing about it. It was too damn dark. You know that yourself."</p>

  <p>"I think I know who did it," came amazingly from Barney.</p>

  <p>"Who?" inquired Munson.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Barney!" frantically interrupted Daniel.</p>

  <p>"I'm fairly sure I can explain the whole thing," went on the unheeding
  Barney, in a tone of complacency. "Aunt Matty did it. It was just a piece of
  carelessness. You know Aunt Matty always has a knife in her hand, always
  slashing at things. Well, she just passed by in the dark and happened to
  slash poor Daniel by mistake. That's all."</p>

  <p>"And who had she intended to slash?" demanded Munson, showing no signs of
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Who?" exclaimed Barney. "Why, no one, ofcourse. A loaf of bread, or some
  sort of dead animal such as a ham, or chicken, or even a pt de foies. The
  sandwiches were running low. I know that sad fact myself."</p>

  <p>"You would, Barney, you would," said Daniel, grinning in spite of his
  growing weakness. "Stick to that story, boy. It's a slick solution. What do
  you think, Scott?"</p>

  <p>In Munson's eyes there was a hint of good-natured disgust. "It all depends
  on what Aunt Matty thinks," he observed dryly, and added, "after I have
  talked with her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Aunt Matty will agree to anything," said Barney cheerfully, as he
  rose from his chair and started for the door.</p>

  <p>Munson smiled in spite of himself at this piece of effrontery.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" he commanded sharply. "The ordinary criminal, the low-down type is
  merely immoral. He's not such a difficult problem. But you people of some
  pretense to social standing are totally unmoral. You are the hardest class
  with which to deal. You band together and stick. Now, there has been an
  attempted murder here. If that knife had found its mark one of you three
  standing there in the dark against that curtain would now be dead. Quite
  bloodily extinguished. And," he added slowly, "it's by no means certain which
  one of you it would have been. That isn't a nice thought to carry round with
  you, is it?" Without waiting for an answer he went on : "So please sit down,
  Barney, and do try not to complicate matters any more than they are. You
  might actually be helping to kill the thing you most love. There's a
  potential murderer at large among us, tonight, and there may be more than
  one."</p>

  <p>Barney sat down promptly with a look of horrified amazement on his face.
  "The devil there is," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Munson. "Where the deuce is Manning?"</p>

  <p>The door opened, and Manning, followed by June Lansing and Sam Stoughten,
  came into the room. Manning was by no means too drunk, but contained just the
  right quantity of liquor to lend inspiration to his hand. He was a man of
  some forty odd years, dapper, handsome, and possessed of a head of remarkably
  white hair. An unfailing attraction. Men could trust Manning, but not women,
  so they did and seemed to enjoy it. Manning, also. His practice had been so
  punctuated with scandals that he had practically abandoned the practice the
  better to apply himself to the scandals. A good doctor when he could be
  located. Independently rich.</p>

  <p>"Sam had the devil of a time finding me," he announced, "and when he did .
  . . well..." The doctor left his sentence eloquently unfinished.</p>

  <p>Going up to Daniel he rapidly examined the wound.</p>

  <p>"Clean enough," he remarked, "but, Dan, my boy, you're going to have one
  hell of a fine arm for several weeks. All the way through. A good jab, that.
  Required strength." Turning to Munson, he added, "I thought something was
  up."</p>

  <p>"You called for the light?" asked the latter.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Manning. "Thought I detected a certain note in Daniel's
  voice. Made me nervous. Hand me my bag, Stoughten."</p>

  <p>"Notice anything?" went on Munson.</p>

  <p>"Altogether too dark. Not a cat." Manning was busy with Daniel's arm.</p>

  <p>"It was an accident, doc," said Daniel significantly. "A piece of sheer
  carelessness. Aunt Matty just happened to have a knife in her hand
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly," said Manning. "Those things happen every day,
  but" &mdash; and here he gave Daniel a look of comprehension &mdash; "Aunt
  Matty should not be allowed to play with knives."</p>

  <p>"It's a habit," proclaimed Barney. "A menace. One must keep dodging her
  all the time. A very careless and near-sighted woman, and has been so from
  birth."</p>

  <p>"Your nerves are shot to pieces, Dan," said the doctor, stepping back and
  critically regarding his handiwork. "Here," he went on, "I'm going to leave
  you a bottle of these. Take two in a half a glass of water in about half an
  hour. I always carry them to parties in case some woman gets laughing or
  crying or cursing too much. Nice girls we have with us these days." With one
  of his rapid changes he turned to Barney and said : "Just slip down the back
  way with this bag and get it into my car as quietly as you can."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the astute Barney had dragged Aunt Matty into the
  privacy of the pantry.</p>

  <p>"You just stabbed Daniel in the arm," he informed her. "It was when the
  lights went out. Then you stabbed him with a long knife through the curtain.
  All a mistake, you understand. No hard feeling, no fits of passion."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather have done it in a rage than through sheer carelessness,"
  complained Aunt Matty. "Then I wouldn't have seemed such a fool."</p>

  <p>"Well, just say anything you like," urged Barney. "Bayonet practice, for
  instance."</p>

  <p>"Or merely a girlish whim," suggested Aunt Matty. "Is he really bad?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Barney assured her. "He's just stabbed. That's all."</p>

  <p>"Anything short of murder you can blame on me," she said. "I'm too old for
  things to make much difference now one way or the other, but I draw the line
  at murder for some quaint reason."</p>

  <p>As Barney hurried away the old lady looked pensively at the gently
  swinging door. "There's something wrong going on in this house," she thought
  to herself, "but I can't put my finger on it, although I feel I'm getting
  hot."</p>

  <p>Back in the room Barney assumed an unnatural and unconvincing air of
  briskness. "Got safely through the lines, Dr. Manning," he announced,
  "without anyone seeing me."</p>

  <p>"Except Aunt Matty," remarked Munson.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?" asked Barney, and was outraged when everyone
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"All out now," commanded Manning, "except June Lansing. Ever put a man to
  bed, June?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she assented calmly. "Often." "Who?" demanded Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Father," smiled June. "At times mother would have nothing to do with
  him."</p>

  <p>Munson unlocked the bureau drawer and gingerly withdrew the knife. At the
  sight of the stained blade an inimical presence seemed to have entered the
  room. All pretense of light-heartedness died out. The little group looked
  serious and defensive. Scott Munson was no longer one of them, but to this
  attitude he appeared entirely indifferent. He confronted Barney and pointed
  with one long finger to the hilt of the knife.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Matty's," he remarked unsmilingly. "Her finger-prints. Don't mind if
  I just make sure? Hand me one of those glasses, Sam. I'd like a bit of a
  night-cap."</p>

  <p>Realizing how suspicious it would appear not to comply with Munson's
  request, Stoughten obeyed. Scott Munson watched him closely, noting the exact
  position of his fingers. Then he poured himself adrink. With the glass in one
  hand and the knife in the other, he turned to the door. Then he halted and
  looked at Barney. That dismayed young man, as if fascinated, followed the
  direction of Munson's eyes and obediently opened the door for him. With a
  curt good night, Munson left the room.</p>

  <p>"That is what I call a real cheery exit," remarked Manning.</p>

  <p>"It's his way," replied Daniel. "When he's once started he turns into a
  torturer. Seems to check his heart until called for. May I have a shot,
  doctor? I'm damn well tired now."</p>

  <p>"Haven't the heart to refuse."</p>

  <p>"Pour out the drinks, Sam," said Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Come, cheer up everybody," suggested Barney, trying to be helpful. "The
  worst is yet to come."</p>

  <p>Both Daniel and Stoughten looked at him with hostile eyes.</p>

  <p>"What are you looking at me like that for?" he asked nervously. "Why the
  devil is everyone so subdued and jumpy? Feel like going down and getting
  foaming drunk myself."</p>

  <p>"Do," urged Daniel smoothly. "Get good and drunk, and then go to bed. It
  wouldn't be a bad idea."</p>

  <p>"Sweet advice from a brother," retorted Barney. "Come along, Sam, and get
  me drunk."</p>

  <p>Stoughten finished his drink and followed Barney from the room. At the
  door Barney looked back. "Too bad it wasn't your throat," he said.</p>

  <p>"On your way, baby," called Daniel. "Outside."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">For the past half-hour Daniel had been sleeping quietly.
June attributed
  his restful slumber to the tablets she had given him. Had she but known it,
  the contents of the glass now lay; on the floor in a neat little pool between
  the wall and the bed. Daniel had no idea of indulging in sleeping potions
  that night. There was still a thing to do.</p>

  <p>Munson came quietly into the room and stood looking down at the sleeping
  man's averted face.</p>

  <p>"You gave him the tablets?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Half an hour ago," said June.</p>

  <p>"Then he's through for the night," he remarked in a tone of relief.</p>

  <p>He departed as noiselessly as he had entered and sought the privacy of his
  own room. Yes, Daniel was through for the night, he reflected. This little
  stabbing incident had perhaps settled many problems. He was content it had
  been no worse. Lighting a cigarette, he sat down in a comfortable chair. Sam
  Stoughten had tried and failed. Apparently in addition to her other gifts
  Emily-Jane also possessed a charmed life. Munson wondered if she suspected
  the intended destination of that long searching blade or whose hand had held
  the knife. Stoughten would now be afraid to act further. Munson held the
  evidence against him. The finger-prints on the knife were identical to those
  on the glass. He had assured himself of that. Both exhibits were now locked
  up in a safe place. Scott Munson relaxed and enjoyed his cigarette.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">June Lansing rose quietly and picked up Daniel's vest,
which had slipped
  to the floor from the arm of a chair. On the matting beneath the vest lay a
  scattering of letters. Without hesitation she opened one of the letters and
  began to read. Perhaps this letter might help her to discover what all the
  trouble was about. It was no time to stand on ceremony. As she read a slow
  red flush gradually mounted to her face. Seating herself, she glanced at
  Daniel and returned once more to the letter.</p>

  <p>At the end of half an hour she rose slowly, slipped the letters into
  Daniel's pocket and mechanically hung up the garment in the closet. The last
  lingering traces of girlhood seemed to have left her face. For a long time
  she stood looking down at the man she loved, whose secret she now held, whose
  problem she understood. A wave of sympathy for him went out from her. He was
  momentarily free from his burden. Peace after weeks of heart-eating worry was
  with him. Peace and helplessness. For tonight, at least, he was safe. But
  Daniel, she knew, would never let Barney marry Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>The orchestra was playing "Home, Sweet Home." Its strains drifted up to
  the listening girl. She glanced at her wrist-watch... two-thirty. The close
  of Emily-Jane's dance, a huge personal triumph and a greedily received
  display. Emily-Jane must be quite well satisfied. Pleased with herself, in
  fact. At the thought of the girl, June's face became hard and set. In her
  eyes lay a frozen light, impersonal, cold, inscrutable. There was something
  about her at that moment that suggested the aloof, unapproachable
  magnificence of a statue of justice. Something huge and unalterable.</p>

  <p>Once more she looked down at the sleeping man, stretched out one hand,
  hesitated and withdrew it.</p>

  <p>Then she turned slowly, very slowly away from the bed. And she left the
  room.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Daniel was at the door listening.</p>

  <p>Just outside in the hall Barney was bidding good night to Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>"I love you, Emily-Jane," Barney was saying, in a pathetically inadequate
  voice considering the depth of his emotions. "To me you are the most
  beautiful damn creature in the world."</p>

  <p>Emily-Jane laughed softly, a trifle impatiently, the listening man
  thought. "Be a good boy, Barney," he heard her say. "Trot off to bed and go
  to sleep. I must run down now and see some of the gang off. You're not so
  good at that."</p>

  <p>A moment later, when Barney thrust his head in at his brother's door,
  Daniel was back in bed. Satisfied he was safely asleep, Barney's head was
  withdrawn, and the door closed softly.</p>

  <p>Daniel, in spite of his wounded arm, slipped into his domino. To hell with
  the pain. A drink, must have a drink. He found the bottle and drank. Then he
  went to the window and waited, looking out over the night.</p>

  <p>A late moon, like an overripe cantaloup badly damaged in shipment, was
  rising over the Cliff Path. Daniel regarded it without either interest or
  appreciation.</p>

  <p>Presently he saw two figures detach themselves from the shadows and pass
  down the path in the direction of High Point Rock. One figure was
  unmistakable. Its slim legs flashed out from the kimono. An attractive effect
  in the moonlight. Still Daniel waited. At the end of ten minutes he rose from
  his crouching position and went to another window, climbed carefully through
  it and seized the limb of the old tree. Already his wound was open and
  bleeding. Along his, left arm ran a moist, burning sensation. Daniel was
  indifferent to it. Indifferent now to everything. Once on the ground, he
  sought the protection of the trees and moved through the darkness in a
  direction parallel with the Cliff Path but more protected from
  observation.</p>

  <p>But Daniel was not the only nocturnal stalker on that particular night;
  there were others, and Death was guiding their feet.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">From behind a thicket of wind-worried bushes Daniel
listened and watched.
  He saw Emily-Jane drink from a small container that flashed in the sad
  moonlight and he heard her reckless laughter as she returned it to her
  companion. Blood was now trickling from Dan's fingers, but he was unconscious
  of it. The night wind was cool on his forehead, and from the base of High
  Point Rock the sea spread on and on to God knows where. How pleasant it was
  to be there and to smell the scent of the salt mingling with that of the
  shrubs and earth still moist from yesterday's rain. For a moment Dan was once
  more a child with little Barney. They were looking for berries and birds'
  nests, and Daniel did most of the finding. At the thought of Barney his eyes
  returned to the figures standing on the edge of the great rock.</p>

  <p>They had become merged now. They were one. And Lane Holt's triumphant
  laughter smote his ears. It was hateful to hear&mdash;unbearable. Then Daniel
  heard Emily-Jane speaking, unabashed and unafraid. "No, Lane, no," she was
  saying, "he doesn't matter in the least. It will make no difference, my man.
  You are my man, aren't you, Lane? My unholy, unfaithful lover?"</p>

  <p>And Holt: "That last crack, honey, goes two ways."</p>

  <p>"In what else is the joy of life?" came the voice of Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>And that was the last word she ever uttered.</p>

  <p>Breaking from the bushes Daniel slipped between them. Hot with drink,
  Emily-Jane flung herself upon the intruder. Daniel had her by the naked
  shoulder with his one good hand. His bloody hand smashed into the face of
  Holt. It was not a fist, just a red mangled flail. From the bushes another
  black figure came at the group. Its gaze was directed not at the swaying
  figures, but rather on the ground at the edge of the rock. Still violently
  holding Emily-Jane, Daniel turned to Holt. The man was no longer there. He
  was slinking along the Cliff Path, peering back over his shoulder. Then he
  vanished from view. The other black figure, sobbing quietly to itself, backed
  into the bushes. With a strange sensation of sudden release, Daniel turned
  back to Emily-Jane. She, too, had vanished.</p>

  <p>And Daniel stood alone, peering down into the blackness where lay the
  great broken rocks upon which he and Barney had played in bygone years.</p>

  <p>A lone, black figure in the dwindling moonlight, high up against an
  unresponsive sky... peering, peering, peering down to where a shattered
  figure lay all unheedful of the low nervous mouthings of the surf.</p>

  <p class="first">HOW he succeeded in reaching the foot of the cliff Daniel
  never remembered. For a short time his mind was blank, numb, incapable of
  recording external impressions. He wanted to know. He wanted to be sure. With
  his own eyes he wanted to see his terrible handiwork lying there in the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>And as he staggered, bruised and aching, among the broken rocks, he found
  her, the shattered mass once known as Emily-Jane. Then, there alone in the
  darkness he knelt by the body of the girl and laid a hand on her upturned
  face. A bloody end of the bandage fell against her cheek. He was forgetful of
  his own danger. His only desire was to be alone with his victim to brood
  there beside her in the damp and dark.</p>

  <p>Sea waves washing and sea mist rising. A solitary figure crouched over the
  twisted body of a dead girl. Far, far away, over there somewhere in a dump of
  black trees, an old, weary moon, once as glorious as Emily-Jane, was going
  out, its pale face merely a memory of brighter nights gone by. And above all,
  the great black cliff, a threatening, watching mass of bitter stone.</p>

  <p>God ! What had he done? Put a period to an evil life. Yes, but perhaps
  even the most distorted life had rights of its own. Gone now his assurance of
  rectitude. Gone now the desperate courage that had seen him through the act.
  He was merely Daniel now, Daniel alone and afraid.</p>

  <p>As his eyes grew accustomed to the shadows at the base of the cliff, he
  could see more distinctly the distorted figure of Emily-Jane. Her bare legs
  lay sprawled and twisted, lending to the nearly nude body a suggestion of
  obscenity. One arm was crushed unnaturally beneath the naked back, and Daniel
  saw with dilated eyes how frightfully the skull had been smashed. There was a
  black stain around the hair.</p>

  <p>This thing he had done. This ruin he had created.</p>

  <p>With back-drawing hands he did what he could for the grotesque body of the
  girl he had hated so intensely in life. Now that she was incapable of further
  evil, now that she was helpless, no longer an object of envy and admiration,
  his former loathing was gone. He straightened the outflung limbs and removed
  the arm from beneath the shattered back. It was a rough job, but at the end
  Emily-Jane looked a little more as she would have preferred to look when
  found. She was now not quite so defenseless.</p>

  <p>Then Daniel did a strange thing for this age of rationalism. Moved by some
  unknown chord in his nature, he lifted up his hands to the dripping blackness
  and offered a numbed, formless prayer. He prayed for himself and for Barney.
  He prayed blindly, voicelessly, for all mankind and even for Christ himself,
  who must suffer along with man. Then he rose and left the rocks and walked
  through the sand. Emily-Jane lay behind him, beyond all good and evil.</p>

  <p>He had done the thing he had planned. She was dead, and now Barney must
  suffer. The boy would suffer. Perhaps, if he ever found out he would come to
  hate the brother who had eternally sacrificed the peace of his soul to save
  him from inevitable sorrow and humiliation.</p>

  <p>Daniel was mortally weak. The long beach stretched ahead of him. Beneath
  his feet the sand resisted hisfumbling tread. If only June were there to help
  him on. Then silently out of the darkness, like black wings from the sea,
  fear came to Daniel. Panic-fear, blind and selfish, the fear of death, the
  fear of detection, and of the consequences of detection.</p>

  <p>Like a wild, hunted thing he stopped and sought to penetrate the night
  with his terror-stricken eyes. A bloody, trembling hand smeared his lips. His
  head moved grotesquely from side to side, and slowly, as if reluctantly, he
  sank lower and lower until he found himself crouching in the sand like some
  hateful beast.</p>

  <p>The body on the rocks whose blood he had splashed, was it following him
  silently down the beach? Hideous dead eyes that cared not for darkness.
  Reaching hands that plucked. And laughter ! God ! The laughter of the
  revengeful, maddened dead. He rose and lurched for-ward. But what lay before
  him? Discovery, capture, and death set by the clock. Not sudden death, but
  death that sits and waits with you and studies your face with assured but
  averted eyes. Yet, anything was better than this awful beach and the body on
  the rocks.</p>

  <p>Daniel shambled onward, his red bandage slipping down his arm and trailing
  from his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Would Barney ever know the deaths his brother died for him that night?
  Dazedly Daniel wondered if his own soul lay behind him, shattered upon the
  rocks with Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>"Peace, God, peace. For a moment let me forget." Daniel staggered and
  fell. The sand gave rest to his body, but God did not speak.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">From a sound sleep Scott Munson suddenly awoke. He wondered
why. What had
  called him? Looking at his watch, he placed the hour at three-thirty. Pitch-
  black outside. A silent house. Munson knew that for some good reason he was
  awake. Then he became aware of the reason. Through the open window a mist was
  driving in from the sea. His hair and face were wet.</p>

  <p>Something else, however, had happened to claim his activity. Within the
  last few hours some new misfortune had come to the old house. Scott Munson
  felt this vaguely, as a person awaking suddenly in a dark room sometimes
  feels the presence of a stranger, unseen but close at hand.</p>

  <p>He snapped a cigarette into action and tightened the belt of his smoking
  jacket. Yet even now, as he stood smoking reflectively before his door, Scott
  Munson was not sure of the exact nature of the trouble nor what line to
  take.</p>

  <p>"Just smouse round a bit," he decided, "is the best I can do at
  present."</p>

  <p>With this somewhat vague line of action in mind he opened the door he had
  been looking at as if for some helpful suggestion, and stepped out into the
  dim light of the silent hall.</p>

  <p>From the head of the stairs he discovered Sam Stoughten on the point of
  making the ascent.</p>

  <p>"Things are looking up," was Munson's thought as he studied Stoughten's
  white face.</p>

  <p>Sam looked as if he had just been tossed in a blanket by all the fiends in
  hell. The expression of strain and horror round his eyes particularly
  interested Munson, who was studying him intently behind a mask of genial
  surprise. Also, he noted that the longer he maintained that genial mask, the
  more Sam's hand trembled on the banister below. So Munson maintained the mask
  and quietly took note until at last he feared his poor victim would fall in a
  swoon or else become an idiot, in either of which cases he would lose his
  usefulness for Munson.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, as Sam was actually about to collapse, "why don't you
  come on up? You look as if you'd seen a ghost."</p>

  <p>It was an unfortunate way to open a conversation with Sam that night.</p>

  <p>"Ghost?" croaked Sam, promptly sitting down on the stairs with his back to
  Munson. "Ghost? I don't understand. Don't let's talk. It's much too
  late."</p>

  <p>"Never too late for ghosts," observed Munson heartily. "Especially for new
  ghosts."</p>

  <p>He had the satisfaction of seeing Sam's broad back give a violent lurch.
  Also, he observed that to the lurching back clung several wet leaves.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you don't want to talk with me about ghosts," he continued, "why
  don't you come upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't made up my mind," Sam had the wit to reply. "I've been drinking
  and I'm a little worried about seeing Sue."</p>

  <p>"Sporting of you to admit it," said Munson. "Where have you been holding
  your revels?"</p>

  <p>"In there," declared Sam, pointing to the dining-room. "Alone. Heavily.
  That's why I'm this way. Goofy."</p>

  <p>"I hate to stand here talking to your back," observed Munson, "so I think
  I'll skip down and talk to your face until you've made up your mind."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm coming right up," declared Sam, rising as promptly as he had sat
  down. "Don't trouble yourself about me."</p>

  <p>But it was much too late. Munson had literally skipped down and seized Sam
  by the arm with a friendly but firm grasp.</p>

  <p>"Too drunk to talk," objected Sam, making a pretense of reaching for the
  stairs with a wavering foot.</p>

  <p>"Not sure," said Munson. "Let me smell your breath."</p>

  <p>Sam drew back as if the very idea revolted him to the marrow.</p>

  <p>"I was merely considering your wife," explained Munson. "Come in, and show
  me where dwelleth this drink."</p>

  <p>Attempting a crablike mode of progress, Sam allowed himself to be forcibly
  conducted to the dining-room where Munson gently eased him into a chair.</p>

  <p>"Now, Sam," he said cheerfully, "we'll both have a slight nip. Where is
  the stuff?"</p>

  <p>Receiving no reply, he searched busily round the room, then returned to
  the despondent Sam and stood looking reproachfully down at him.</p>

  <p>"Why, Sam," he said, "there isn't a dram in the place."</p>

  <p>"Drank it all," replied Sam moodily.</p>

  <p>"What did you do with the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"Threw it away."</p>

  <p>"Where, Sam?"</p>

  <p>Sam was staggered. "Through the window," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Which window?"</p>

  <p>"That one," replied Sam with a sweep of his arm that included all the
  windows in the room.</p>

  <p>"You lush," proclaimed Munson admiringly. "It's terrible," admitted
  Sam.</p>

  <p>"And where did all those leaves come from, sticking to your back?"
  suddenly demanded Munson.</p>

  <p>Sam began to think he was really drunk. "Fell into a plant," he
  offered.</p>

  <p>"What plant, Sam?" Munson's voice went on. "There isn't a plant in the
  room."</p>

  <p>"Threw it away, too," said Sam with decision.</p>

  <p>"That was rather rough," observed Munson. "Just where did you throw it,
  Sam?"</p>

  <p>Oh, God, would this devil never cease?</p>

  <p>"Through the same window," said Sam in a whisper. "Sure you didn't carry
  it out?" continued Munson. "Certain," replied Sam.</p>

  <p>"Then why the mud on your shoes? Look at them." Sam refused to look. "Mud
  from the plant," he announced triumphantly. "I was watering it. Felt sorry
  for the thing."</p>

  <p>"And then you thoughtfully wiped up all traces of mud from the floor,"
  said Munson approvingly. "That was nice of you, Sam."</p>

  <p>"The least I could do," modestly replied Sam. "Too bad you split your
  domino while doing it," observed Munson sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't matter," said Sam. "Sue'll mend it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I wouldn't tell her the same pack of lies you've told me," said
  Munson, his voice losing its easy banter and taking on a keen edge of irony.
  "I wouldn't do that, Sam, because it will only make matters worse. Make you
  look er&mdash;guilty, Sam, if you get what I mean. As a matter of fact, it's
  none of my damn business... yet. You'd better go to bed, old man, and don't
  worry about staggering."</p>

  <p>Sam raised an ashen face to Munson. His eyes were filled with fever.
  Tragedy lay therein, and looking at him Munson felt a twinge of pity. His
  heart was heavy, for to some extent, Sam's lies had confirmed his worst
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>Without attempting an answer, Sam rose slowly and left the room. He
  climbed the stairs and made his way directly to Daniel's room. He opened the
  door and looked in. Daniel's bed was empty. "Christ !" muttered Sam
  helplessly. "Oh, Christ, he's done for!"</p>

  <p>He sought his own room and sat down in the dark to wait. His door was
  slightly open to permit him to see the hall. Sue, the complete sleeper,
  continued her gentle tribute to one of her favorite occupations. Sam sat and
  waited.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Alone in the dining-room, Munson wandered about restlessly.
He was deeply
  disturbed now. Sam's conduct had sharpened the edge of his fear. As he passed
  the door to the pantry he stopped and peered through the glass. Suddenly he
  realized that there was a light in the kitchen. Why the light? More
  smousing.</p>

  <p>Quietly he passed through the pantry, and standing in the dark, looked
  into the kitchen. No luck this time. It was only June Lansing sitting by the
  stove. With her usual composure she was sipping a cup of tea. The teapot
  stood on a nearby table.</p>

  <p>Tea was a good idea. Why not some tea?</p>

  <p>"May I have a cup, too?" he asked, entering the kitchen noiselessly.</p>

  <p>For a moment June looked at him unseeingly as if still caught in the web
  of her thoughts. Then she shook herself slightly and smiled. "You're just in
  time," she replied. "The tea is in the full flavor of its youth."</p>

  <p>Munson drew up a chair and accepted the proffered cup. "How's your
  patient?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Dreamless," said June. "A perfect patient."</p>

  <p>"A strange happening," suggested Munson.</p>

  <p>"It's one of those things that is better left untouched," she replied,
  looking at him frankly. "Like a hot coal," she added.</p>

  <p>"But don't you think attempted murder demands some investigation?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I prefer to regard it in the light of an accident," said June
  enigmatically. "And accidents don't count."</p>

  <p>For the first time he noticed that one of her slippers was missing.
  Interesting. June, following the direction of his gaze, smiled and extended
  her stockinged foot; at the same time withdrawing the other.</p>

  <p>"Corns," she announced briefly.</p>

  <p>Munson smiled in turn. "These modern shoes," he remarked. "Inventions of
  the devil."</p>

  <p>"They certainly play the devil with one's feet," agreed June.</p>

  <p>"June," said Munson after a meditative silence, "I'm worried. I've the
  strangest feeling something has happened."</p>

  <p>"Something always does," she replied.</p>

  <p>"But not something terrible," said Munson. "What is it all about?"</p>

  <p>For a moment or so she considered him thoughtfully, and Munson felt that
  he detected an unfamiliar expression in her eyes and a new maturity about her
  face. She was somehow different. "I've noticed it, too, Scott," she replied
  at last. "I've felt things going on and remarked changes in people, but no
  one takes me into his confidence. I have my suspicions, and, Scott, I believe
  they're the same as yours."</p>

  <p>"Emily-Jane?" said Munson.</p>

  <p>June nodded.</p>

  <p>"There's more to that young lady than meets the eye," observed Munson.</p>

  <p>"Not much if you saw her tonight," said June with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Daniel is out of luck about something," said Munson. "I'd do anything to
  help him, June."</p>

  <p>"So would I," the girl replied. "And you know that, Scott."</p>

  <p>"I do," he said, then added, "Damn that girl."</p>

  <p>"I guess she's pretty well damned herself already," said June, "but I
  doubt if she knows it."</p>

  <p>"That's what makes me afraid," said Munson, and the two of them sat
  regarding each other with thoughtful eyes.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When Daniel rose from the sand he had driven off his
unreasoning, brutish
  panic. Fear was still with him, had been added to his other emotions, but it
  was the fear of the intelligent man calculating and weighing the chances of
  escaping the consequences of a rash and terrible deed.</p>

  <p>His arm had not become stiff for the reason that he had given it no
  opportunity, but it ached and burned so intensely that he felt he was
  carrying a flame at his side. Stubbornly refusing to think of anything save
  ways and means of getting back to his room undetected, he plodded on down the
  beach and, circling the embankment, made his way into the security of the
  trees. He had decided to return to his room by the same way he had left it,
  regardless of the damage the exertion might do to his arm. Quietly he moved
  through the darkness, swaying as he went, like a drunkard trying to escape
  observation. He little realized that his brain was not functioning with its
  customary accuracy. It was skipping the essential details.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Munson, poised at the head of the stairs, drew back
quickly. Someone was
  coming out of Emily-Jane's room, and the person was not Emily-Jane. The
  watching man waited with indrawn breath as the door slowly opened. Lane Holt,
  after a quick look along the hall, slid through the partly opened door which
  he quickly locked behind him. Carrying the key in his hand he tip-toed to his
  room.</p>

  <p>"If the door had been locked from the inside after his guilty exit, I
  could see some sense in the business," thought Scott Munson. "As it is, I am
  greatly perplexed&mdash;deeply interested."</p>

  <p>From the darkness of his doorway Sam Stoughten was watching Munson. When
  he saw him approach Daniel's room, his heart sank and his brain began to work
  at top speed. Anything to help Dan. He slipped from his room and locked
  himself in the nearby bath-room, where he waited. It was merely a chance, a
  futile attempt, perhaps, but it might give Daniel time or an alibi.</p>

  <p>Munson looked into Daniel's room and found the bed empty. Odd. How could
  that be? Perhaps the effects of the drug had worn off. Perhaps&mdash; He
  closed the door and walked down the hall to the bathroom. The door was
  locked.</p>

  <p>"Dan," he called in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Scott," came Daniel's voice.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you doing out of bed?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask foolish questions," came the reply.</p>

  <p>"How do you feel... how's the arm?"</p>

  <p>"Both doing well, thank you. Want to come in and have a nice little
  chat?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Munson, slightly nettled. "But you'd better get back to bed as
  quickly as possible."</p>

  <p>"I never linger, Scott," came the voice. "Good night, old man."</p>

  <p>Munson continued on to his room, where he sat down to consider things. He
  went over the scanty gleanings of the night, but some disturbing thought kept
  cutting across his reflections. Why, damn it all, he had it. Their voices
  sounded alike, remarkably so. And the similarity could be made almost perfect
  if deliberately attempted. What a fool he had been. Well, he deserved it.
  Only a short time ago he had rather shamefully made a fool of Sam. He had
  even decided from Sam's futile attempts to lie that he really was a bit of a
  fool. Evidently not.</p>

  <p>Munson rose swiftly and returned to the bathroom. It was unoccupied. Sam
  had returned to his own room after having waited a little more than a
  reasonable length of time. He did not know whether or not his effort had been
  of help to Daniel, but he hoped for the best.</p>

  <p>When Munson opened Daniel's door he experienced an odd conflict of
  emotions. He was both disgusted and relieved to find him back in bed. But as
  his eyes strayed to the open window, the feeling of relief vanished.</p>

  <p>On the white woodwork of the sill was the mark of a bloody hand&mdash;four
  dark red fingers and the lower part of the palm. The missing section failed
  to show on the darker wood of the sill proper.</p>

  <p>Sam had done his best, but his best had not been good enough.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">VIII. &mdash; THE BODY ON THE ROCKS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THROUGH the slanting rays of a new sun that promised great
  things if given time, Pete Clark, occasional fisherman and confirmed seeker
  of solitude and rest, gently nosed his odorous old boat against the small
  beach just under High Point Rock. Pete had no reason in particular for this
  enterprising landing. As a matter of fact, Pete never had any reason for
  doing any of the things he did. Therefore he was a happy man. Realizing that
  his boat had found its way to a rather pleasant haven, Pete considered the
  advisability of entrusting his valuable person to the shore. It seemed the
  logical thing to do, and Pete did it, but not because it was logical.</p>

  <p>In the course of his purposeless amblings, his speculative eye dwelt on a
  small bright object lying near by in the sand. Inasmuch as this object was
  actually near by, to be exact, no farther from Pete than three paces, this
  excellent navigator decided to pick it up. This he did, and after examining
  it with purely esthetic enjoyment slipped it into a trustworthy pocket,
  wondering as he did so just what the hell it was. As to wonder was to worry,
  that is for Pete, he gave it up and continued his snaillike tour of
  inspection.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, that is if the arresting of so slow a progress could be called
  sudden, Pete stopped. His long arms froze to the seams of his trousers, and
  his eyes became glued to the mass of shelving, broken rocks. Altogether Pete
  was a most unpicturesque object. But Pete had one saving feature, developed
  from long gazings on distant horizons. Pete had good eyes, keen though
  disarmingly vague and mild. He was now using those eyes as he had never used
  them in all the years of their looking.</p>

  <p>What he saw was the body of a girl, most improperly clad, lying on the
  rocks. And Pete's eyesight told him that the body would never move again of
  its own volition. But Pete moved. He moved by slow stages as if fascinated,
  until at last he found himself standing over the body of the dead girl.</p>

  <p>And so it was Pete Clark, of humble calling and few demands, who first
  found all that remained of the beautiful and highly admired Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>Just what was the nature of the thoughts that passed through the mind of
  Pete on that bright, fair morning, as he stood with the lonely sea as a
  background and contemplated the broken body of the beautiful girl, is not
  recorded, but awe was written on his seamed and sun-dyed face. Some minutes
  passed before the practical side of Pete's nature asserted itself. Then it
  was that he began dimly to realize the fact that he knew this girl, for Pete
  was by way of being a local character, well received in the highest as well
  as the more modest kitchens. This girl was none other than Miss Emily-Jane
  Seabrook, Mr. Barney's young lady.</p>

  <p>Once this fact had become firmly fixed in the bemused brain of Pete Clark,
  his movements thereafter were merely automatic. With meticulous solicitude he
  beached his pride and joy, and after eying the results of his efforts with
  approval, departed down the beach at a pace which for Mr. Peter Clark was a
  trifle above terrific.</p>

  <p>Thus it came about that at six o'clock Pete presented himself for the
  first time at the front door of the Crewe Mansion and commanded the
  infuriated maid to summon Mr. Barney with the utmost expedition. He intimated
  darkly that all was far from well. Dubiously and ungraciously the maid
  departed, and in a surprisingly short time for Barney he appeared on the
  scene and hurried to the door where Pete was unhappily lurking.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Pete," called Barney. "What's all this about bad news? Anything
  wrong at home? How about a drink?"</p>

  <p>As Pete stood listening to Barney and remembering him as a tumbling cub,
  his heart grew heavier and heavier and his tongue seemed turned to stone.
  Casual-minded as he was, Pete instinctively sensed the tragic irony of the
  situation. Young Barney offering him the sympathy that he himself soon would
  be needing.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Barney," he began, and halted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Pete, what is it?" asked Barney, reading the trouble in his old
  friend's face. "Is it as bad as all that?"</p>

  <p>"'Fraid it is, Mr. Barney," said Pete. "It's worse. Your young lady, sir,
  is lying at the base of High Point Rock and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Barney just looked at him with a question, a plea in his eyes. Just looked
  at him and waited.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pete. "Yes, Mr. Barney, she is."</p>

  <p>Barney stiffened as if a current of electricity had been suddenly shot
  through his body. Then slowly he began to sway. Pete was able to stand it no
  longer. He took young Barney in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Boy, boy," he muttered, "come over here and sit down. We'll get Mr. Dan
  for you. He'll take care of you now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Pete, get Dan," said Barney, forgetting his brother's wound. "I
  think I'd like to have Dan."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There it was! The knock! The fateful sound for which he had
been waiting
  throughout all the years of his life, it seemed... waiting and preparing.
  During the early hours of the morning he had risen and cut away as much as he
  could of the red, frayed bandage. With his right hand he had encased his arm
  in a clean towel, pinned it somehow, and let it go at that. Now he was ready
  for the summons.</p>

  <p>The knocking continued with increasing urgency. Weakly he rolled from his
  bed and went to the door. "Yes," he called. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Dan," came the voice of Dora, one of the maids, "Mr. Barney wants
  you bad. An awful thing has happened. He's downstairs."</p>

  <p>"Tell him I'll be with him." Daniel's voice was choked.</p>

  <p>Barney wanted him. God Almighty, what irony! Barney wanted him. And he
  must face Barney with the accusing truth in his heart. He had brought this
  sorrow to his own brother by slaying the thing he loved. Thank God, the
  sincerity of his sympathy for Barney would help to carry him through the
  ordeal.</p>

  <p>Daniel was an ill man, weak from fatigue and the loss of blood. The
  terrible strain of all that he had gone through already had ravaged his face.
  Devitalizing fever was burning in his veins. He realized that his arm was now
  in a dangerous condition. In spite of all this, some reserve of power, some
  force of pride lay within him and gave him strength&mdash;the strength that
  kills its possessor. But far above all other factors was his affection for
  his brother. The knowledge that Barney needed him at this moment urged him
  on.</p>

  <p>He struggled into his dressing-gown. With one hand on the edge of the
  bureau he steadied himself and threw back his shoulders, his head well up,
  then like a man about to take a perilous plunge he made for the door. It was
  surprisingly opened for him by Scott Munson, fully clad and alert. For a
  brief moment their eyes met and Daniel's threw back a challenge. Then
  Munson's gaze shifted to the blood marks on the white surface of the window
  ledge. Daniel, following his gaze, received a shock so numbing that it left
  him outwardly frozen. Its effect was not apparent, He merely grinned back at
  Munson.</p>

  <p>"No time for hound work, Scott," he said. "Barney needs me."</p>

  <p>Munson bowed. He had asked for the slur and got it.</p>

  <p>"Sure you can stand it, Dan?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have to stand it, Scott."</p>

  <p>"All right. Come on."</p>

  <p>Together they walked down the hall and descended the stairs, Daniel
  displaying no sign of weakness. Barney was sitting on a long bench in the
  hall, and Pete Clark, silently protective, was standing by. At the sound of
  his brother's familiar tread, Barney raised his face, and slowly his chin and
  lips began to quiver until at last a gasp broke from him. He gripped the
  bench with both hands and dropped his head. Why was he such a baby? Daniel
  would know he wasn't a baby and would tell the others so. It was all right
  now. Daniel had come. Daniel's arms were about him and he hid his face in his
  brother's robe.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, kid," Dan was saying. "Go ahead, Barney. Do as you damn well
  please. Look, boy, look at me. See, I'm crying, too."</p>

  <p>And, in truth, Daniel was crying. Tears were running down his haggard
  cheeks, although he made no sound. Daniel was crying inwardly for the grief
  of his brother. Barney looked up at Daniel as if for confirmation. With a
  slender finger he touched one of the tears on his brother's face.</p>

  <p>"Don't, Dan," he whispered. "Don't feel so sad." He hesitated, then added
  in a voice of incredulity, "She's gone, Dan, she's... oh, Dan, she's dead."
  Then Barney broke, and the terrible sobs of a man wrenched themselves from
  his breast.</p>

  <p>"That's the boy, Barney," Daniel murmured, holding his shaking brother and
  swaying gently. "Just like long ago, Barney, when things went wrong. But they
  always came right, didn't they? And they'll come right now."</p>

  <p>They were alone, each with a racked heart, and the years fell away. Once
  more they were boys together, sharing each other's woes. But this time it was
  the elder brother who needed the greater comforting. And just as in those
  other days, a sea breeze passed down the hall and found its way to the old,
  drifting orchard.</p>

  <p>"Don't you mind, Barney. Don't you mind."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Munson slapped the telephone back on its fork and sat back
in his chair,
  regarding the squat instrument gloomily.</p>

  <p>"God damn everything," he said quite slowly and distinctly, "including
  myself."</p>

  <p>His arrangements had been made. The district attorney, summoned from his
  bed at that early hour, had agreed to put him in complete charge of the case.
  The district attorney at that early hour would have agreed to
  anything&mdash;anything at all if he were only allowed speedily to return to
  bed.</p>

  <p>"Play no favorites, Scott," he had said, "and call on the local
  authorities."</p>

  <p>And when Munson had told him where to go, the district attorney had
  yawned. Two more telephone conversations had set the machinery in motion.</p>

  <p>This was the first case in his career that Munson had approached with
  dread. He had insisted on taking it because he knew that things would be even
  worse if outsiders were let loose in that old, friendly house. Yet he roundly
  damned everything, including himself. His hands came down with a snap on the
  mahogany arms of his chair. He rose briskly and went to the open window of
  the library.</p>

  <p>"Pete Clark," he called.</p>

  <p>Pete sped down the veranda at the rate of at least twelve miles an
  hour.</p>

  <p>"Did you find the gardener, Griggs?"</p>

  <p>"I did, sir, and I sent him to stand by the body."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Pete. Do you mind standing by here for a short time?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, if I could sit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Pete. Sit, collapse, or contort, but just stick around."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Munson."</p>

  <p>"I thank you."</p>

  <p>Munson left the library and stood waiting in the hall. He had invited the
  household, exclusive of the servants, to confer with him immediately in the
  library. He now watched its various members descend the stairs and enter that
  pleasant room. There was a method in what he did. It interested him to note
  the manner in which each person looked at him as he or she passed by.</p>

  <p>Sam Stoughten's expression had been that of a rather anxious shamefaced
  boy whose sins had only partially found him out. His wife's had been merely
  that of a very much worried wife who wished everything would settle down
  again so that she could deal properly with her fool of a husband. Lane Holt's
  had been that of a man who hides his fear behind a swagger. Aunt Matty's had
  been merely one businesslike question-mark&mdash; "What's happened to our
  house, Scott?" June Lansing's had been thoughtful and searching. Daniel's
  expression had been that of a man so weary he no longer cared much. In
  Barney's eyes Scott read the greatest trouble. Grief had left them a trifle
  wild and a trifle brooding. They were not the eyes of a sane man. He had been
  the only one who had looked at Munson and not seen him. Barney was turning
  in, trying to puzzle something out, to catch a lost impression or to map out
  some little plan of his own.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to go through all this, Barney," Munson had told him,
  placing a kindly but restraining hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"But I must go in," Barney had replied, and moved on with lowered head. "I
  might help you, Scott," he had tossed back.</p>

  <p>Munson entered the library and confronted the little group.</p>

  <p>"I'm nervous," he said, "and worried. I guess we all are. I won't keep you
  long here because we have a harder task ahead. Here, then, is the situation."
  He addressed himself to Daniel. "You can have me handle the case, for I have
  full authority already, or you can entrust yourselves to the usual agents of
  the law&mdash;the law which at present I represent. It is for you to decide
  whether you prefer me among you or some other equally distasteful person or
  persons. If&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stay here and do your worst, Scott," interrupted Daniel. "You can't help
  it. In a way you're doing us all a kindness, even if it hurts."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Dan," replied Munson. "You always were a sport."</p>

  <p>"See here!" Holt was on his feet, mouthing aggressively. "What's all this
  about, anyway? You don't know that a crime has been committed. What right
  have you to assume so? It's the most irregular way of carrying on I've ever
  encountered."</p>

  <p>"A crime has been committed." Barney's voice came startlingly from a
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Holt, in some respects, is justified in what he says," continued Munson
  calmly. "My methods are somewhat unofficial, but they have a few saving
  virtues. They are quiet. They are intelligent. They are absolutely
  uninfluenced by self-interest or any desire to win official recognition. And
  that means a lot. As to the question of a crime having been committed, I
  think that most of us present will agree with me when I say a crime has been
  committed and that that crime is murder. Anyway, I am already in possession
  of certain information conclusive enough to convince me. And by the way,
  Holt" &mdash; Munson stepped across the room and stood over the lounging
  figure &mdash; "may I ask for that key?"</p>

  <p>Holt's face grew white. He sprang to his feet. "You damned spy!" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>Munson smiled pleasantly. "Please don't keep us waiting," he said. "We
  have other things to do."</p>

  <p>There was the sound of an automobile stopping at the front entrance.
  Munson, looking through the window, saw several local constables alighting
  from a disreputable machine. Lane Holt, turning round, also saw them.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to be searched?" asked Munson. "You see the law is already
  in operation." Munson's manner suddenly changed. He leaned forward and held
  the man with his eyes, eyes stinging with fury. "Hurry up," he said in a low
  voice. "I want that key."</p>

  <p>Holt reeled back as if struck by a snake. His expression registered both
  fear and surprise. Was the man confronting him Scott Munson? God, no. He was
  a demon&mdash;hate in the body of man.</p>

  <p>"I'm waiting. I'm waiting," thrilled Munson's voice.</p>

  <p>Holt's fingers fumbled in his watch pocket and withdrew a key which he
  extended to Munson with a shrinking hand as if in mortal fear of coming in
  contact with him. When Munson accepted the key it seemed as if every person
  in the room breathed easier.</p>

  <p>"And did you get what you were after?" he inquired sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"No," came hoarsely from Holt.</p>

  <p>"If you had," went on Munson in an even, venomous voice, "I'd have got
  that too. Now, listen, Holt. Even before this investigation has got well
  under way you've made yourself liable to arrest for attempted theft. Sit down
  now and think that over. You called me a spy. Of course I'm a spy. At present
  that's my one occupation, and I hate it. But it doesn't take much of a spy to
  find out what you've been doing ever since you accepted the hospitality of
  Daniel and Barney Crewe."</p>

  <p>Munson paused and turned to face the others in the room. His eyes seemed
  to hold everybody in a spell like some bad dream.</p>

  <p>"I'm a spy," he announced. "Anyone who ever finds out anything is, in one
  sense or another, a spy has to be a spy. That's one reason why I asked all of
  you here. To me you are all suspects, and as suspects you naturally come
  under my espionage. I will play no favorites, nor will I shirk the most
  unpleasant duty. I ask you not to regard me as your friend any longer, but
  merely as a man out to get the truth, to exonerate the innocent and to
  confront the guilty. Quite a speech, isn't it?" He paused, then hastened on:
  "Quite a speech, yes, but the situation must be made clear. It must be
  understood. If the guilty person can beat me, I for one won't blame him. Let
  him do it. I'd escape the consequences of a murder myself if I could. So, I
  say, go to it and escape if and when you can. I'm here to do a mean job that
  does not appeal at all to me, but I'm going to do it, and I'm going to show
  no mercy. And to be entirely frank with you all, the only persons in this
  room who have nothing to hide are Aunt Matty and young Barney over there. You
  are all against me and I'm against you all. But just the same that fact does
  not prevent me from liking you all and from wishing that things were
  different." He paused and turned to Holt. "Sit down!" he snapped. "I'll talk
  to you later."</p>

  <p>Then he walked to his former position and half sat on a long table laden
  with books, magazines, papers, lamps, and ash trays&mdash;an untidy,
  comfortable table. Everyone present was amazed at the sudden urbanity of the
  man. He favored them all with a bland smile.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "I made a mistake when I told you I liked
  you all. Personally, I never could bear the sight of Lane Holt, but just
  because of my feelings about him he will receive, if anything, more careful
  treatment than anyone else."</p>

  <p>He walked over to a window and looked out as if expecting something. Then
  he once more returned to his former place and looked thoughtfully at each one
  of the group in turn.</p>

  <p>"There is a murderer present," he said quietly, and the effect of that
  simple statement was horrible, almost beyond endurance. "A murderer," he
  repeated as if to himself, "and he may be my friend. Funny. And even if I
  catch him I shall always regard him as my friend."</p>

  <p>Abruptly he ceased speaking and, turning his back on his listeners, idly
  sorted the magazines on the table. For a full minute the room was submerged
  in a brooding silence. Barney, who had been growing gradually more excited
  throughout the course of Munson's talk, now began to tremble slightly.
  Daniel, watching him with solicitous eyes, was about to go to him when he was
  arrested by the sound of Holt's voice.</p>

  <p>"What right have you to say that a murderer is present?" he demanded.
  "What proof?"</p>

  <p>Without troubling to turn, Munson answered: "That's my business,
  Holt."</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't, Scott," came the excited voice of Barney, at the sound of
  which both Daniel and Munson started forward. "No, it isn't. It's my
  business. I know the murderer now. I've just figured it out. He always hated
  her... he didn't want me to marry her... didn't want me to marry Emily-Jane!
  There he is! Look at him ! There is the murderer."</p>

  <p>Barney's voice broke in hysteria and he pointed wildly at Daniel, who
  stood still with his hands hanging helplessly beside him. On his face there
  was an expression of profound sorrow as he said in a low, pleading voice,
  "Barney, kid. Oh, Barney, Barney, Barney."</p>

  <p>And Barney laughed crazily, his trembling arm still extended toward
  Daniel.</p>

  <p>"I tell you my own brother murdered Emily-Jane," he cried in a loud voice.
  "Look at him. Look at him. Doesn't he look like a murderer? He killed her as
  sure as God."</p>

  <p>And Daniel still stood there like a man crucified, his tired, tragic eyes
  striving to reach the heart of his brother. It was not what Barney said that
  mattered, but that his brother for whom he had gone through several cycles of
  hell with many more to come should have turned on him at this
  moment&mdash;that was the final affliction.</p>

  <p>"Barney, old man, Barney," his voice called to his brother. "Come here,
  kid. Forget it. Don't be like that."</p>

  <p>No one will ever know whether or not Barney was answering that call when
  he took two steps forward, then crumpled to the floor.</p>

  <p>In an instant Daniel had gathered him up in his arms and carried him to a
  sofa. The pain caused by this action caused him to stagger back against Scott
  Munson.</p>

  <p>"Get a doctor, Scott," he said.</p>

  <p>"He's already here," replied Munson. "See, he's taking care of Barney. It
  was only a nervous outburst, Daniel. Don't mind that. He knows you're his
  best friend."</p>

  <p>He led Daniel to the pantry and made him sit down. Then he handed him a
  drink. Leaving him for a moment, he returned with Manning.</p>

  <p>"My God, Dan," said the doctor, "you shouldn't have lifted your brother
  like that. Here, let me look at that arm."</p>

  <p>Then, carrying on a rapid-fire conversation, he dressed and bandaged
  Daniel's arm, after which he took a drink himself and gave one to his
  patient.</p>

  <p>Daniel, feeling his strength returning, followed Manning back to the
  library where Munson still held the group together. Barney, revived, had gone
  to his room under the care of Aunt Matty.</p>

  <p>"Does he still believe?" Daniel asked as Scott Munson joined them.</p>

  <p>"He's not right yet," said Munson, "but you mustn't mind him. All
  sensitive, high-strung temperaments are like that when overwrought."</p>

  <p>"Then you're not going to arrest me?" asked Daniel, with a broken
  grin.</p>

  <p>"Not on that kind of evidence, Dan," replied Munson. "Barney's ravings are
  not relevant." He looked Daniel squarely in the face and said: "We are all
  going to the rocks now. Are you strong enough to come? I had to talk myself
  hoarse this morning, waiting for that damn fool Manning. Of course we could
  have moved her before, but I've blocked off the entire point from cliff top
  to the beach. It's essential that I should see things for myself. Would you
  like to see her?"</p>

  <p>It was a challenge that Daniel feared not to accept.</p>

  <p>Back down to the beach again. Daniel recalled all the terrors of only a
  few short hours ago. This time he was accompanied by nearly all of the actors
  in the drama. Thank God, Barney was not among them. Daniel could never have
  stood that. Those stretcher-bearers, two stalwart fishermen, they were to
  bring Emily-Jane home. And he must look at her in full daylight under the
  watchful eye of Munson. Was that why they all were there? Munson, the
  torturer, always got his way. Well, he, Daniel, would fool him this time. He
  had used up all his emotions of any kind. He was as dead as Emily-Jane so far
  as caring was concerned.</p>

  <p>He was walking with Manning now, and the doctor was helping him along.
  "Munson's a brute," said Manning. "You should never have done this."</p>

  <p>Daniel began to laugh. "Done what, doctor?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>He knew the doctor was looking at him curiously, and he pulled himself
  together.</p>

  <p>They had reached the rocks now. Munson was carefully shepherding them.
  Something to do with foot-prints, perhaps, or perhaps not. Somehow, June was
  on his other side. She was holding tight to his hand. Raise your head. Look.
  Don't laugh. For God's sake, don't laugh. "I did that." Should he shout
  it?</p>

  <p>Yes, there was Emily-Jane. A little figure on a large rock. He knew what
  she looked like. He had made her so for this public exhibition. Hold tight,
  June.</p>

  <p>"Jesus," muttered Manning behind them, "doesn't she look lonely?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">IX. &mdash; FROM BEACH TO CLIFF</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE more Emily-Jane was the center of all eyes. It almost
  seemed a pity that she couldn't have arisen in her ballet dress and performed
  one of her innocently suggestive little dances. Instead she lay there cold,
  picked out by an early sun as golden as her hair. As in life so in death,
  eyes looked at her fascinated, but this time there was a different quality in
  her spell.</p>

  <p>Munson mounted the rock. For some minutes he stood looking down at the
  girl. Dark, lithe, and inscrutable he was. The sun splashed against his
  straight black hair. He stood motionless, his intense gaze photo-graphing
  every detail of the body and its immediate surroundings. Then, throwing back
  his head, he let his eyes travel slowly up the face of the cliff until they
  rested on the summit. There they remained fixed. He would have to go up there
  to the actual point of the departure of Emily-Jane from the world she had so
  successfully deceived. Once more he looked down at the dead girl as if trying
  to discover the reason for her existence.</p>

  <p>"All right, Manning," he said, in a low voice that carried its calm tones
  clearly to the silent group of watchers.</p>

  <p>Dr. Manning left Daniel's side and joined Munson on the rock.</p>

  <p>"Manning," Munson said, "I waited for you so that you could give evidence
  at the inquest. I can rely on your discretion when you are discreet, and I
  might as well tell you now that I want the inquest to be a mere
  formality&mdash;wilful murder with an open field. You understand?" He raised
  his dark eyes to those of the doctor.</p>

  <p>"What a body, Munson," murmured Manning. "What a figure. Too bad. Too damn
  bad. Wasted. Lost. I understand."</p>

  <p>The whole-hearted depravity of the man pleased Munson, who smiled grimly
  and said, "For the moment, Manning, I want your purely professional
  observations."</p>

  <p>"You have them, Munson. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"The position of that figure and certain other details," Munson continued,
  "tell me an interesting story. What do they tell you, Manning?"</p>

  <p>For some time Manning's eyes roved over the body, then he looked up at
  Munson with puzzled eyes.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, Munson," he said, "there's the position of the body
  itself. Graceful as she was in life, she just couldn't have fallen so
  gracefully. Impossible. She would have been all sprawled out or twisted.
  Somebody has fixed her. Decent of whoever it was. Then another thing, those
  blood smears on her face, they upset me. By rights they shouldn't be there.
  The face, fortunately, is uninjured. There is no reason&mdash;no way that I
  can see, for blood being there at all. My conclusion is that someone put
  those marks on her face in the dark. Probably it isn't her blood, but that of
  some wounded&mdash;" He gave a slight start and ended up with, "That's the
  way I see it."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Munson. "Damned good. And that's the story I want you to
  tell at the inquest with the exception, with the very essential exception, of
  the wounded part. Now just one minute and we'll get this over. I want to let
  these people go back home to breakfast, if they can eat any."</p>

  <p>Once more his eyes traveled over the little group at the foot of the
  rock.</p>

  <p>"Pete," he called in a casual voice, "will you come up here for a
  moment?"</p>

  <p>For the second time that morning Pete ascended the rock, on this occasion
  with the dignity and deliberation of a semi-official consultant.</p>

  <p>"Now, Pete," said Munson, with an indulgent smile, "you arrived at the
  Crewe house at six o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Did I?" said Pete, quite pleased and surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Pete, you did," Munson assured him. "About how long were you on this
  beach altogether?"</p>

  <p>"About an hour by the sun," replied Pete. "What I mean is, one hour from
  the time I landed until I called on Mr. Barney."</p>

  <p>"So that puts you here just at about five o'clock," observed Munson. "Was
  the body when you found it exactly as it is now?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," replied Pete emphatically. "Just as she lays there now."</p>

  <p>"Not likely that anyone else would be wandering round here before five, do
  you think, Manning?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"Most unlikely, I should say," he replied.</p>

  <p>"That's all," said Munson briskly. "The inquest will be held at ten
  o'clock tomorrow."</p>

  <p>As Pete was on his way down, Munson called him back.</p>

  <p>"Did you see anything else down here," he asked, "that might be helpful in
  clearing up this case? Any marks or objects&mdash;anything?"</p>

  <p>And Pete honestly declared that he had not seen a thing, for he had
  completely forgotten the bright little object now resting in his pocket.</p>

  <p>Alone on the rock, Munson knelt down and examined the girl's dress.
  Suddenly he rose and called to June Lansing. Reluctantly she left Daniel's
  side and mounted the rock.</p>

  <p>"June," said Munson, still preoccupied, "would you very much mind reaching
  your hand down in there and see what it is? I don't like to do it myself for
  some reason."</p>

  <p>"You're a terrible man, Scott," replied June, "and I mean it, but you
  can't help some of your finer instincts, can you?"</p>

  <p>When she looked into his eyes she read there a deep, abiding sadness, and
  there was sadness in his voice, too, when he said : "June, you must believe
  me. This is the rottenest, the most heartbreaking task I've ever undertaken.
  But, June, I've got to go through with it to the end, and I must do it my
  way."</p>

  <p>Without another word, June did as she was bidden. The hand she withdrew
  held a packet of letters. She exchanged glances with Munson, and for the
  first time June's eyes wavered. Silently and with a heavy heart she left the
  rock. When Munson rose and read with deep concentration one of the letters
  from the packet, Sam could not repress a gasp.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Sue, startled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing," replied Sam, when all the time he felt like ducking and
  setting off hell-bent down the beach. "Nothing at all except that this place
  is getting on my nerves."</p>

  <p>He braced himself to receive the admonitory look that Munson was sure to
  bestow on him upon his completion of the beastly letter. Fortunately for the
  state of Sam's morale, no such look was forthcomng. Instead, Munson looked up
  thoughtfully, then slipped the letter back into the packet. There was a new
  expression in his eyes when he glanced down at the still figure at his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Holt," he called sharply.</p>

  <p>As Holt approached the rock it became apparent to everyone present that he
  was in an abject state of funk. His swagger and self-esteem were gone, and
  with their departure the man became a lamentably deflated creature. His feet
  seemed to scrape along the rocks and his eyes strained away from the body of
  Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>Munson watched him silently.</p>

  <p>"Go on and look at her," he said harshly. "You weren't so modest when she
  was alive."</p>

  <p>Lane Holt for a swift flash bared his teeth, then he looked uneasily away,
  his fingers nervously plucking at the flaps of his coat pockets. Munson
  seemed to be in no hurry. He was carefully, almost hopefully, examining the
  blood smears on the waxen face turned to the sky.</p>

  <p>"What the hell do you want with me here?" Holt asked at last in a husky
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," replied Munson. "Thanks for reminding me. Were these, by any
  chance, what you were looking for in Emily-Jane's room?"</p>

  <p>He held out the packet of letters. Holt started visibly. Involuntarily his
  hand went out as if to seize the packet.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no," he replied. "I was looking for nothing &mdash;just to see if
  she was in, that's all."</p>

  <p>"No thought of a little blackmail, Holt?" asked Munson. "Sort of a
  complete life of crime? No?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't do it, Munson. I didn't, you know. I&mdash;I was fond of
  Emily-Jane. I really was."</p>

  <p>"That admission makes it all the more probable in view of the fact that
  she was soon to marry another man. Don't try to convict yourself, Holt. You
  don't have to."</p>

  <p>"May I go now?" Holt's face was ghastly, his words trembled. He could feel
  Munson's eyes burning into him. There was no escape. No hope of escape. "Yes,
  go!" The words fell like a lash.</p>

  <p>Munson turned back to his inspection of the blood smears.</p>

  <p>"Dan," he called in an absorbed voice, "do you think you could make the
  grade, old man?"</p>

  <p>"Damn him and his old mans," muttered Sam. "He's trying to hang the lot of
  us. Why, old Dan can hardly stand on his feet. He's been through enough for
  one day."</p>

  <p>But Daniel was moving forward, moving slowly and carefully, but well under
  way. There was no suggestion of hesitancy about his approach, no indication
  of guilt or dread. At the base of the rock, Pete Clark, who had remained to
  see whatever was to be seen, offered to lend a helping hand.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Pete," said Dan. "I think I can still navigate."</p>

  <p>He climbed the rock he had played on so often as a boy, and stood gazing
  down at Emily-Jane. Not many hours ago she had been dancing and trysting.
  Enjoying both. It seemed such a great way off. Just a few hours. Most of the
  guests at the affair were still sleeping. Time had not even begun for them.
  How could she be so utterly dead, so completely remote from life? Why, she
  did not even know that life ever had been, that there was a world with golf
  links in it, country clubs, and dances. She was not even aware of the rock
  she was lying on. She was through, gone. And really it was a good thing,
  although even in death she still retained the power to wound and to destroy.
  What a fool he had been to hope otherwise. Munson had been repeating his name
  for some time. Why in hell couldn't he keep quiet? Daniel wanted to
  think.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said impatiently. "What's on your mind, Scott?" His gaze
  was polite but abstracted. Scott was a good chap. A hard worker. At present,
  an awful pest.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of these, Dan?" asked the awful pest, pointing to the
  blood smears on the face of Emily-Jane. "I asked Doc Manning, but I'd like to
  get your opinion."</p>

  <p>Daniel's thoughts snapped back to the immediate present. "Are we
  conversing as equals, Scott?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"As always, Dan," replied Munson, a little puzzled.</p>

  <p>"That being the case," said Dan, with a smile, "my opinion is that you're
  an extremely apparent hypocrite and that you don't want my opinion at all.
  Scott, old dear, you're just plain plain, if you get what I mean. Now let's
  get down to cases. What do you really want? Do you want me to find the
  murderer of this girl here? Are you seeking my collaboration? If so, give me
  your confidences also. As you know, I'm a pretty sick dog at present. You
  can't bank on my reactions, you know, because I'm not quite myself at the
  moment. Out with it, Scott. Don't be a humbug."</p>

  <p>"Daniel," said Munson, "you're too much for me. As far as I'm concerned,
  your rather painful trip down here has been entirely wasted. I see now that
  I'll have to work on you a different way. You know me too well. I'm at a
  disadvantage because of that, but time will tell. Good luck. I hope you
  win."</p>

  <p>"Same to you," said Daniel. "I hope you choke."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," replied Munson with a real smile. "Can I help you down?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," said Daniel. "I think I can make it, but why don't you cover
  her up, Scott? She's licked."</p>

  <p>"But don't forget, Dan, she still possesses the power of death."</p>

  <p>Daniel turned and faced him squarely. "You mean you possess the power of
  death," he retorted. "She's ended."</p>

  <p>Thus, at the moment of triumph, Daniel made the mistake of emphasizing
  with obvious satisfaction the impotency of Emily-Jane. Munson was not the man
  to overlook such little slips. He dropped the sheet over the body and
  followed Daniel from the rock.</p>

  <p>"We've stood about enough punishment for one morning," he said to the
  little group. "You'd better get back now and try to eat something. When we
  bring home Emily-Jane, I hope you'll keep young Barney out of the way. Don't
  mind the presence of some minions of the law if you happen to see them. I've
  had to have a few photographs taken, but I've instructed the men to leave the
  members of the household entirely alone. Let's try to carry on as usual. I'll
  join you as soon as I can, if that prospect brings you any pleasure. I hope,
  Dan, young Barney has come to his senses, but don't be surprised if he
  develops a fixed idea. It will have to wear itself out. It's tough, but the
  kid's had a shock." He paused and looked down the beach. "At last," he
  exclaimed, "here comes our honored coroner. I bet he's had his
  breakfast."</p>

  <p>Munson was back on the rock when they last saw him. With the assistance of
  a short stout officer he was carefully painting the outline of Emily-Jane
  upon the rock.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Having settled his business with the coroner and that
dignitary having
  departed, Munson turned to the two local officers who had come to relieve
  Griggs, the gardener.</p>

  <p>One of these officers was a red man. That was the impression he gave. Red
  of face and hair and hand. He was short and rather stout. The other was a
  crushed individual. No stomach. A sad, broken sort of face, and great lengths
  of arms and legs&mdash;yards of them.</p>

  <p>"Well," thought Munson, considering the pair, "this is a well-balanced
  team they've given me."</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" he asked the little red officer. "Shay, sir," came the
  piping reply.</p>

  <p>"And yours?" Scott turned to the other, whose sad eyes were fixed dreamily
  on the sea.</p>

  <p>"Shay, sir," this one found the heart to say.</p>

  <p>"I'm not asking to be introduced to my friend here," said Munson. "I
  already know his name."</p>

  <p>The crushed officer looked even more sorrowful. "My name is Shay," he
  replied, as if trying to convince himself of that fact.</p>

  <p>"Oh," suggested Scott hopefully. "Brothers, I take it."</p>

  <p>"We hardly know each other," protested the crushed one. "He's just joined.
  Been an officer somewhere else."</p>

  <p>In the face of this new complication, Munson came near to washing his
  hands of the case, but he rallied gamely. "What do they call you at home?" he
  asked the red officer.</p>

  <p>"Tim, sir," came the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>The crushed man seemed to be having a terrible time with himself. He gave
  the impression of one preparing for a long, swift flight. When Munson turned
  to him he spoke quickly.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask it, Mr. Munson," he said. "It is. It always was."</p>

  <p>They were now standing in a space where no one had been allowed to tread.
  The two fishermen were preparing to carry the body back to the house. Munson
  sat down on a rock and moodily considered the situation. Suddenly his eyes
  took on a new interest. About two feet away, in a patch of smooth hard sand,
  was an odd impression&mdash;a cluster of small pointed indentations, the
  whole being a little larger than a fifty cent piece.</p>

  <p>Forgetting for a moment the stupendous problem of the two Tim Shays, he
  took out a notebook and made a careful sketch of the design. While doing so
  he noticed the mark of a man's foot near by. This he carefully measured for
  length and breadth. Then he put away his notebook and turned to face the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I'm not blaming you fellows about the matter of names,
  but it does seem unfortunate. Any suggestions?"</p>

  <p>"I've also been known as Shad," offered the crushed man.</p>

  <p>"And they used to call me Red," contributed the other. "Red Shay," he
  added, with evident satisfaction. Munson beamed upon them.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "you can see for yourself how simple it is. It's all
  settled. Now, boys, we'll have to get up the face of that cliff somehow or
  other."</p>

  <p>His aids looked aghast. The man must be mad. If he started in like this,
  what would it be at the finish? Had the truth been vouchsafed them, they
  would have resigned en masse from the force.</p>

  <p>Munson was back on the rock, superintending the removal of Emily-Jane,
  taking an active part in it.</p>

  <p>"Careful, men," he told the huskies. "She's badly broken. Handle her
  gently."</p>

  <p>And the great men, with hard, rough hands, handled the body of Emily-Jane
  with all the delicacy of a woman. Munson stood looking after them as they
  plodded through the sand, bringing Emily-Jane home. Then he rejoined his
  waiting staff.</p>

  <p>"All set," he said briskly, and led the way to the path that twisted up
  the side of High Point Rock. At the foot of the path the staff halted
  smartly.</p>

  <p>"They say I suffer from giddiness," confided Red to Munson.</p>

  <p>"Well, here's your chance to show them they're all wrong," replied
  Munson.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Munson," quoth Shad, "I'm a good man on a flat. None better, but
  going up, no&mdash;not so good."</p>

  <p>Munson suddenly turned on them with what they later decided was nothing
  less than the fires of hell in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you see this path?" he asked them in a low voice. "Do you see how
  steep it is&mdash;how high?"</p>

  <p>They readily agreed that they saw all that and more.</p>

  <p>"Well, if this path were ten miles long," continued Scott, "and twice as
  high, I'd make you sprint up it. Come on."</p>

  <p>As they fell in behind him, Red confided to Shad in a whisper, "There'll
  be two deaths instead of one."</p>

  <p>"Three," muttered Shad. "And he'll be the murderer."</p>

  <p>As Munson made his way up the twisting pathway, he halted from time to
  time to chalk a circle round certain dark stains that occasionally appeared
  on the large rocks beside the way. He noted that the rocks bearing these
  stains were always those that would prove helpful in serving as brakes or
  braces for anyone descending the path. He took no pride in his discoveries.
  In fact they rather depressed him. Those blood smears on the face of
  Emily-Jane and a few dark spots on the rock had led him to expect the
  existence of these on the path. Once he stopped and picked from between two
  rocks, companionably leaning against each other, a torn piece of
  blood-stained lint, obviously a part of a bandage&mdash;Daniel's bandage. The
  train was only too clear, yet it did not prove that Daniel had murdered
  Emily-Jane. Contributory evidence only. He might have been on the spot. He
  might have gone down the cliff after the commission of the act, and arranged
  her body. He might have seen the person who did kill her, but so far, Munson
  suddenly realized, he possessed no conclusive evidence. Daniel had the
  motive, and it could be proved he was at the scene of the murder, but was
  that quite enough? With some juries it would be if the case were properly
  presented. And then Munson remembered with a sinking heart their conversation
  at the golf club just before Daniel had driven off&mdash;that could be used
  to advantage by a skilful prosecutor, but still it was not complete. Even now
  Daniel might be safe if only nothing new were found against him.</p>

  <p>Munson, poised in the path, with the piece of red lint in his hand,
  sweated not so much from the exertion of the climb as from the temptation to
  pervert the truth, to juggle the facts. Not for any friend in the world would
  he convict an innocent person, offer up a sacrifice. And this was only too
  easily possible. It could be done. On the night, or rather morning, of
  Emily-Jane's death there was more than one person astir, and probably lurking
  round High Point Rock. He wiped his forehead and, after slipping the lint
  into an envelope, continued on his way.</p>

  <p>Clawing up the path behind him, came the two ex. hausted Shays. When they
  spied the chalk marks on the rocks they became exceedingly perplexed.</p>

  <p>"Looks to me like he's playing games," observed Red, quite seriously.</p>

  <p>"He's just mad enough to," returned Shad. "Maybe he thinks he's showing us
  the way."</p>

  <p>"That's real nice of him then," put in Red in hitbest sarcastic pipe. "As
  if there was a chance of ever losing this path. It would be just as hard to
  go back now as to keep on going up."</p>

  <p>"Then up we go," groaned Shad. "This isn't getting us nowhere."</p>

  <p>"No?" said Red. "Well, I'm telling you now, I'm scratching out my grave
  with my own two dogs."</p>

  <p>Munson was met at the top of the path by a tall bronzed man with
  startlingly pale blue eyes. He was neat of appearance, well set up, and had a
  brisk, businesslike way about him.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. Munson?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I was before I started up that damned path," said Scott, with a faint
  smile. "I'm rather less than Munson now. And you?"</p>

  <p>The bronzed man with the pale blue eyes was indulgent enough to return
  Munson's smile.</p>

  <p>"My name's Bennett, Mr. Munson," he said. "I'm from headquarters. The
  district attorney instructed me to hot-foot it down here to help you. Now get
  me right on this. He told me to help you when and if you needed me, but not
  to butt into your operations. In other words, I'm at your disposal. I can
  come and go as needed. I've been here since a quarter to seven. Found two
  local men guarding the point. I've been standing by up here because from all
  I could learn, it seemed to me that this place was important."</p>

  <p>Munson extended his hand.</p>

  <p>"I need someone like you," he said. "Already I've felt the need of someone
  with whom to compare notes &mdash;someone to talk to&mdash;someone to listen
  to me. This is a family affair, you know, and that makes things difficult."
  He paused to consider his words carefully, then added: "If I don't take you
  entirely into my confidence it is not through lack of trust, but merely on
  the grounds of expediency. Unnecessary things need not be known."</p>

  <p>"I expect nothing, Mr. Munson," said Bennett. "I'm really not on the case.
  As I said before, I'm merely standing by to be used when called for... to go
  here and there when necessary."</p>

  <p>At this moment two strained faces appeared round the edge of the rock at
  the head of the path. The faces were too tired even to sweat. They had merely
  congealed themselves into two molds of exhaustion. It looked as if for all
  eternity, even after eons of complete rest those faces would remain
  unchanged, never able to return to their former state of well-being. Bodies
  followed the faces, and these bodies promptly deposited themselves on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Quite a climb," came from one of the faces, with a feeble smile.</p>

  <p>"Compared with that path, Mt. Blanc is a hole in the ground," announced
  the other.</p>

  <p>"My staff," said Munson, pointing to the prostrate figures. Then he
  addressed himself to the faces. "Rest up, boys," he said. "You deserve it.
  Rest up a few minutes, then we'll get to work. Be careful where you
  walk."</p>

  <p>"Can't walk," said the redder face.</p>

  <p>"Don't have to worry where I put my feet," said the other. "Mine stay
  right where they are... forever."</p>

  <p>As the two men walked away, Munson's keen ear detected the sound of low
  but hysterical laughter. Munson, himself, was laughing a little inwardly.</p>

  <p>"I feel sure I'll be needing your help," he remarked to Bennett. "My staff
  seems to be permanently damaged. Have you looked about any?"</p>

  <p>"A little," replied Bennett, "but touched nothing. There are certain
  things." He did not continue.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Munson, taking a quick step forward and pointing to a man
  arguing with the two local guards barring the way to High Point Rock, "and
  I'll bet one of those certain things is the property of that gesticulating
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"There is a silver hip flask," suggested Bennett. "Lead me to it," said
  Munson. "I have an idea I know about where it is."</p>

  <p>"We must step carefully because there are also foot-marks," observed
  Bennett diffidently.</p>

  <p>Fifteen yards farther on, close to the soggy edge of the great rock,
  Bennett pointed to a flask lying on the bare earth. Round about the flask was
  a frantic scramble of footprints now rapidly drying beneath the sun that had
  promised so much. Munson carefully picked up the flask and examined it for
  initials. They were plain enough "L. H." A pleased expression came to
  Munson's face. Suddenly he waved the flask aloft.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Holt," he called. "I've found it."</p>

  <p>With an expression of the utmost dismay, Holt stopped arguing with the
  guards and fixed his eyes on the flask, gleaming like an accusing brand in
  the sun-light.</p>

  <p>"Will you please go, Bennett," said Munson, "and conduct that gentleman
  through our conscientious constabulary?"</p>

  <p>Bennett soon returned with Holt in tow.</p>

  <p>"Be careful how you step, Holt," warned Munson. "You might spoil some of
  your own footprints. By the way, which ones are yours?"</p>

  <p>Munson looked appraisingly at Holt's feet, then pointed to a mark in the
  soil.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet that one belongs to you," he said. "Of course, you were wearing
  dancing shoes. Put your foot in it and see how it fits."</p>

  <p>"Damned if I will," replied Holt, his eyes on the flask. "And you haven't
  the authority to make me."</p>

  <p>"You're right there," replied Munson, reluctantly. "Anyway, I don't work
  much from footprints unless they are practically forced upon me. Nevertheless
  your refusal shows a decided disinclination to cooperate with the law. Oh, is
  this yours?"</p>

  <p>Holt's hand shot out to the extended flask, which Munson quickly drew
  back.</p>

  <p>"I see it is," he remarked dryly. "We found it here&mdash;right on the
  edge of the cliff at virtually the exact spot where Emily-Jane was pushed to
  her death."</p>

  <p>"Munson, I swear to God I didn't do it," said Holt in desperation. "In
  spite of that flask, in spite of every-thing you've got against me or may get
  against me, I tell you I didn't murder Emily-Jane."</p>

  <p>"All right, Holt," said Munson, in a voice a little less bitter than he
  customarily used when addressing him. "Go away now and don't come back here.
  We'll have a little talk soon. But keep your shirt on. You're in a bad
  way."</p>

  <p>The man's once jaunty shoulders sagged as he turned and retraced his
  steps. Munson looked after him for a moment, then sat down rather heavily on
  a convenient rock.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with this case," he said, "lies in the extraordinary
  circumstance that I have already three perfectly good suspects, three
  perfectly good motives, and three convincing sets of clues. Get me?"</p>

  <p>Bennett nodded.</p>

  <p>"If I worked hard enough," continued Scott, "I might be able to convict
  any one of the three suspects, yet all three can't be guilty."</p>

  <p>"It's a matter of choice at present," remarked Ben-nett.</p>

  <p>"That's just the trouble," replied Munson. "It's a matter of
  choice&mdash;my own personal feelings, and I don't like that. If I followed
  them I'd go out and get that person who was just here, a most unpalatable
  character."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you do it?" asked Bennett.</p>

  <p>"No," said Munson, with a shake of his head, "that would be a little too
  low down. I may get him in the end, but something, some small, still voice
  keeps telling me he's not the man."</p>

  <p>He rose and walked restlessly about, his searching eyes taking in every
  detail of the setting. He noted the bushes, stopped to examine certain marks
  barely visible in the soil, then returned to the cliff's edge and stood
  looking down at the confused grouping of footprints. The minutes passed
  unnoticed as he examined these. At length he returned to the rock and sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"Had much experience with murder?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Some," said Bennett.</p>

  <p>"Any good on observation?" continued Munson.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," replied the other quite frankly. "I've a microscopic pair of
  eyes, and that's almost a fact."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Munson. "Now I'm going to make up a little story and after
  I've finished I want you to help me find out if there's any foundation in
  fact in it." He closed his eyes and settled himself on the rock.</p>

  <p>"It's getting damned hot," he said, "and I'm getting damned hungry and
  sleepy. Can't afford to be sleepy. Well, here goes. A girl and a man are
  standing right here near the edge of the cliff. It is three o'clock in the
  morning. An old slut of a moon is trying to display her vanished beauty. The
  man and the girl are drinking, perhaps. In those bushes over there a man is
  hiding. He watches and listens. And somewhere about, not</p>

  <p>quite sure where, another man is hiding. Now one of two things happens. I
  don't know which. Either the couple near the edge of the cliff starts to
  quarrel, and the man tries and eventually succeeds in pushing her over in
  spite of the intervention of one of the hidden men, either that happens or
  the couple starts in love-making and one of the hidden men rushes out and
  confronts them. A fight follows and over she goes. In either case the second
  hidden man is a witness to the whole tragic, silly, sordid business. He
  sneaks away unseen and scared momentarily dumb."</p>

  <p>Munson stopped and opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now you study these marks here, wander round through the bushes and
  examine the ground as well as you can under the circumstances, then tell me
  what you've found out. I'm either too lazy or too tired to do it myself, but
  already I've seen some things."</p>

  <p>Bennett, without a word and with a display of modesty that did him credit,
  followed the trail of Munson's previous investigations, only he was much more
  thorough and fared farther afield. He even disappeared into the thicket of
  bushes. When he returned he set about reading the riddle of the footprints.
  Munson seemed to be sleeping or thinking. Bennett was not sure which. Finally
  he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Munson," he said, "you're about right, but it won't work unless we
  can get that eye-witness of yours to come clean."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know it's only a story," replied Munson. "A sort of a picture of
  what might have happened, that's all."</p>

  <p>"What actually did happen, I expect," said Bennett. "Let's work
  backwards."</p>

  <p>"A good idea," agreed Munson.</p>

  <p>"Well, let's begin with this mess of footprints," went on the other.
  "Undoubtedly these are the girl's. High heels and all. A small, dainty foot.
  Now, there are two pairs of men's prints, one larger than the other. All that
  they actually show is that there's been considerable stamping going on.
  There's your scuffle part. But there's one print that gives us our lead to
  the bushes, assuming the guy ran in a straight line. Take the last print
  in&mdash;the one on the outskirts, so to speak. Feel like moving?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Munson, "but I will."</p>

  <p>"Then, we'll use the center of that heel as a pointer and follow it to the
  bushes," said Bennett.</p>

  <p>The two men did so and halted at the line of the bushes. It hardly
  required a practiced eye to see that someone had recently broken through
  those bushes. The interlaced twigs were snapped in several places. Some
  leaves had been stripped from the branches. With the facts already in hand it
  was not difficult to reconstruct the scene.</p>

  <p>"Want to go inside?"</p>

  <p>Munson did. Here they discovered ample evidence to confirm whatever
  suspicion the snapped twigs and stripped leaves might have aroused. A large
  body must have crouched here. There were not many signs of trampling, but
  enough to show that the thicket at this point was unlike the thicket
  elsewhere. Not conclusive, perhaps, but sufficiently so under the
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Satisfied?" asked Bennett.</p>

  <p>Munson nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then let's go back," said the detective.</p>

  <p>They retraced their steps and followed the bushes round a bend. Bennett
  stopped and pointed. "In there," he said briefly. "Same thing."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't found that one," said Munson.</p>

  <p>"Here's something," said Bennett, "you haven't worked into your story. It
  might have a bearing." This time Bennett took Munson to an isolated clump of
  bushes about fifteen yards from the edge of the cliff. The clump was composed
  of unusually high bushes. A tall person could stand beneath their branches.
  Even with the sun doing its best, the soil underneath the bushes remained
  moist. Bennett took no little pleasure in pointing out to Munson the prints
  of two different pairs of feet on the landward side of the clump. One pair
  was made by a man, the other by a woman, but the woman could not have been
  Emily-Jane, for these prints had been made by far less dainty shoes of an
  entirely different character.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who they were," mused Munson aloud.</p>

  <p>"Of course they might have been here earlier in the evening and then gone
  away," said Bennett, dashing cold water all over his discovery.</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," replied Munson impatiently. "But in a case of murder and
  with so many plausible suspects, a lead as hot as this might prove extremely
  helpful.... Not every witness of a murder is willing to come forward. It was
  a hot, murky, dark summer night. God knows how many couples were taking
  advantage of it to go the limit. You couldn't drag 'em to admit they were out
  in the dark, dark bushes at three o'clock in the morning. A woman would have
  to be fairly seething with public spirit and <i>pro bona publico</i> to come
  forward of her own free will, and, of course, the escort would hold back for
  fear of involving the woman." He stopped speaking and looked thoughtfully at
  the prints, particularly at those of the woman. He seemed to be trying to
  visualize the person who had stood in the shoes that had left their marks so
  clearly behind.</p>

  <p>"Bennett," he said at last, "a man spends all his life taking back
  something whether he knows it or not. I now take back what I said awhile ago
  about footprints. It is perfectly true that in the past I've never got all
  worked up over them, but these prints here interest me strangely. They might
  mean so damn much&mdash;not the prints, but the persons who made them. Now,
  as I read these prints&mdash;I refer to the smaller ones&mdash;it strikes me
  they must have been made either by a woman who prefers comfort to style or by
  one who has occasion to be much on her feet, a servant perhaps. I don't mean
  one of your high-stepping, high-heeled, movie-mad girls, although she may
  easily be that type&mdash;Wait a minute." Munson broke off, and returned to
  his inspection of the prints. "Let's take up the man's prints for a change,"
  he resumed. "What type of man left them here, do you suppose?</p>

  <p>Bennett studied the marks in the damp soil for several minutes. He, too,
  seemed to be endeavoring to give flesh and blood to the wearer of the shoes
  that had made them.</p>

  <p>"For one thing," he said, "he was far from being a dandy. The wide, flat
  heel and the broad toe, the nail marks in the heel and the full impression of
  the sole, all go to convince me that those are the working shoes of a
  working-man&mdash;an outside man." He looked at Munson for confirmation, but
  Munson seemed to be miles away.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Munson unexpectedly. "How about this : A maid still
  wearing her service shoes snags onto the stable man, the gardener, or some
  other outside male servant, and takes him for a walk. No date, no dressing-up
  for the occasion, no thought one way or another. They come down here and
  eventually stand behind this bush. Now, I say this because I happen to know
  just such a likely pair. There may be a dozen of them on this point of
  land&mdash;all sorts of combinations of those pairs, but I know one pair.
  I've watched them. A maid and an outside boy who possesses both the
  inclination and the enterprise to come prowling down here on a dark night.
  Perfectly innocently, I mean, that is, within all reasonable expectations.
  I'm going to find out&mdash; Oh, hell," he broke off, "all this is
  unprofitable speculation, but interesting. You got me into it, Bennett. I
  already know the murderer. Of that I'm fairly certain, but I wish to God I
  could find another one. I rather like this murderer, you see. Understand,
  Bennett, my remarks are unofficial now."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, Mr. Munson," replied Bennett earnestly. "It's a tough
  situation."</p>

  <p>"It is. It is," said Munson, walking absent-mindedly away. Presently he
  stopped and called back over his shoulder, "Have you had any breakfast,
  Bennett?"</p>

  <p>"I could stand a cup of coffee," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Then let's go back to the house. There are things to be done there and
  I'd like to have you along."</p>

  <p>A piping voice greeted them as they were about to leave the point. "What's
  to become of us?" asked the piping voice.</p>

  <p>Munson looked upon the intrepid Shays with a sardonic grin. "My staff
  seems to be partially resuscitated," he said. "What's going to become of you,
  did you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Munson," said Shad. "What's to become of us?"</p>

  <p>"One hell of a lot," came the distressing reply, "if you stick around with
  me. Come along and I'll show you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; CARE SITS ON CREWE HOUSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Daniel and the rest returned from the beach, Manning,
  who had returned a little before the others, was waiting on the veranda. "A
  nice, depressing morning," he said in greeting. "Just the sort of a thing for
  a bright summer day. Invigorates the body and stimulates the nerves. Gives
  one an appetite."</p>

  <p>He was talking at random now, popping out anything in an endeavor to make
  these sad-looking, harried people a little less dispirited. Among Manning's
  various vices was a genuine desire to see his friends happy, to open a bottle
  of any old thing and to help them to enjoy life. He was constantly fighting
  off the dread of depression. No one suspected how low-spirited he felt when
  alone at night he confronted himself in the mirror and thought, "Only a few
  more years left now and those not much good." For this reason he made it a
  point to be alone at night as little as possible. In this he succeeded
  tremendously, but no one realized more keenly than he that within a few short
  years he would be able to share only his memories with the charming women he
  had once seduced. Therefore, when he saw the party from the beach come
  trailing across the lawn, he, too, felt as if the bottom had dropped out of
  things. Getting drunk, he reflected, was no worse than getting morbid. The
  only trouble about it was you couldn't stay drunk indefinitely. And as soon
  as you got sober you became twice as morbid and no end sick. He voiced his
  thoughts tentatively.</p>

  <p>"I think we should all get just a little bit drunk," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"And play going to Jerusalem," added June.</p>

  <p>"Or murderer, murderer, who's got the murderer," put in Sam bitterly.</p>

  <p>"No," protested Daniel, "Scott is playing that game, and it looks as if
  he's going to win. How's Barney. doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Barney's all right," replied Manning. "I've seen the best-hearted people
  break out like that before. When they've had a shock they turn on those
  closest to them. Don't worry, Dan. Something will come along and shock him
  back to reason."</p>

  <p>He led June aside and looked at her seriously and with kindly
  comprehension.</p>

  <p>"Listen, June," he said in a low voice. "I want you to know that I'm with
  the house in this affair. You know what I mean. I'm with you and Daniel and
  Barney, too, for that matter. A friend on the outside may prove very valuable
  in the near future. I'm that friend, and I want you to consider me so. Might
  not be so damned respectable, but I've still got a lot of influence round
  these parts with all kinds of people. They'll do things for me. That's all.
  You can count on me. Now I'm going to take charge of Daniel and put him to
  bed for a while. Send up some coffee and toast and" &mdash; he considered a
  moment, then continued &mdash; "yes, you'd better send up a bottle of
  well-selected wine. I've got to put some heart into Daniel. This thing is
  going to be a fight, June, and it's only just begun."</p>

  <p>"It began a long time ago, Dr. Manning," said June. "I'm afraid that this
  is the last act where everybody gets carried off the stage on stretchers and
  things. But it's good to know we can count on you. Something keeps telling me
  we're not licked yet. If I thought so"&mdash; she shrugged her
  shoulders&mdash; "I'd put an end to the misery."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Manning.</p>

  <p>"I don't know right off, but I'd find a way."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he did it, that chap, Holt?"</p>

  <p>June followed the direction of the doctor's glance to an isolated corner
  of the veranda where Holt was sitting alone. Within the past few hours the
  man had altered shockingly. There was a crazy cast to his face. His eyes were
  all confused with conflicting emotions, hate and fear fighting for supremacy.
  June could find in her heart no pity for Lane Holt.</p>

  <p>"I wish he had," she answered. "I wish he had."</p>

  <p>"He damn well looks the part," said Manning. "If he goes round like that
  much longer he'll be slipping the noose over his own head. Come along, June.
  I must look after Dan."</p>

  <p>Together they walked down the veranda and joined the group. No one
  appeared to be interested in breakfast, yet no one could hit on anything
  better to do.</p>

  <p>Before Daniel left with the doctor, he turned to his friends. "We should
  get this straight, I think," he said. "Munson is not to blame. He did
  everything in his power to head off what has happened. I know that. Now he
  must go his way and we ours. I still consider him my friend, and you must
  admit that as a friend Scott Munson is, to say the least, a good egg."</p>

  <p>"And as an enemy he's a pain in the neck," said Sam doggedly.</p>

  <p>"An unhappy selection of words to express your sentiments, Sam." Daniel
  grinned at his friend from the doorway.</p>

  <p>Sam looked back at Daniel and realized with a stab of impotent anger what
  a human wreck he was as he stood there grinning, or trying to grin. It was as
  much as he could do to keep the tears from starting to his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell," he replied a little huskily, "what do words matter any more?
  What do they mean? I feel like Manning. Let's all get a little drunk, and
  laugh a lot at nothing."</p>

  <p>"Or cry a lot for something," surprisingly remarked Sue, who had never
  placed much confidence in her tongue.</p>

  <p>One by one they drifted into the cheerful old dining-room, but Holt
  remained alone on the veranda. He was brooding, scheming, and fighting down
  his fear. Why couldn't he tell? Munson wouldn't believe him. No one would
  believe him, yet, by God, Daniel was guilty as hell. Holt had not seen his
  face, but there was no mistaking his figure, particularly that blood-wet
  hand. His fear was gaining ascendency now. All the world was fear. Everything
  was against him. Everyone. Hopelessly he slumped forward in his chair. His
  thoughts were like the haze on a tropic swamp... fevered, poisoned,
  drifting.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When Manning had finished with Daniel's arm and got him
into bed, he
  leaned back in an easy chair and sipped his wine with pagan appreciation.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Daniel, my boy," he said, "if we were only in Biarritz or Paris. I
  often think of those places."</p>

  <p>"Somehow I'd like to be in Montreux," came rather wistfully from the bed.
  "You know, Manning... all of us... out of this mess... Barney better and
  everything." A moment's silence, then, "but that can't be... ever." The voice
  trailed off and finished with a decided, "Damn it all to hell !"</p>

  <p>"It can be, Daniel." Manning's tone was tempting "Listen, Daniel, it can
  be. I'm positive of that."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"You know my damn young fool of a nephew, Lambert? Rich as all outdoors.
  Mother's side."</p>

  <p>"Know him well. He's all right."</p>

  <p>"Glad you think so. Glad somebody thinks so. I like him, myself. Drink up,
  Daniel. It won't hurt you." Manning was working hard to put a little
  enthusiasm into his patient. He was waxing enthusiastic himself as his plan
  took shape in his mind. "Well," he continued, "young Lambert has a yacht
  among many other things, a regular sea-going yacht. She's anchored in a cove
  near Willow Point not far off. And she's ready for sea at a moment's notice.
  Remember that. It's a good point. Now, this damn fool nephew of mine has been
  just aching to take a trip round the world or to any spot between or thereon.
  All he's waiting for is someone to go with him. Doesn't care how many. It
  could be done quietly, Daniel, and if this mess, as you call it, keeps on
  getting messier, why, I say, let's go."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," called Daniel.</p>

  <p>"The doctor's wanted," one of the maids announced in an awed voice.
  "They've brought the body back."</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn !" said Manning, gulping down his wine. "It's not my job, but
  anything to be obliging. Think it over, Dan."</p>

  <p>The door closed and Daniel lay there alone . . thinking. He was too damn
  tired to think. He closed his eyes. . .</p>

  <p>He must have drowsed off, for when he next opened his eyes, June was
  sitting by his bed. He had not heard her come in nor did he know how long she
  had been there. Her hand was lying on the coverlet, a strong but now
  pathetically listless hand, and he let his fall upon it.</p>

  <p>"Hello, June." He gave her hand a gentle squeeze.</p>

  <p>"'Lo, Daniel. Any better?"</p>

  <p>"Lots. How's Barney?"</p>

  <p>"He's up and about. The poor kid seems to be lost."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't come to me."</p>

  <p>"He's thinking only of himself at present and of... her."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to spank his bottom."</p>

  <p>"Very pretty. Suppose I died. Would you go round visiting the sick and
  wounded?"</p>

  <p>"If they'd been good to me, yes. I might get drunk and laugh at
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"Would you mind if I died, Daniel?"</p>

  <p>"Quite a lot. Part of me is dead already. Do you want to kill the
  rest?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then don't die."</p>

  <p>"But I might have to."</p>

  <p>"Same here. I'm pretty damn close to it now."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"What did you mean?"</p>

  <p>Silence. A long silence, then Daniel, "Is she next door?"</p>

  <p>"No, Dan. It's in a spare room. There is no 'she.'"</p>

  <p>"It's just as well, June. The trouble started with her, but it hasn't
  ended with her."</p>

  <p>"Are you glad she's gone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, glad."</p>

  <p>"Then so am I."</p>

  <p>"Munson thinks I did it, June."</p>

  <p>"Scott thinks everybody did it."</p>

  <p>"Sort of a mass attack, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Or a series of individual assaults."</p>

  <p>"Each pushing her nearer the brink"</p>

  <p>"We shouldn't talk like this," said June.</p>

  <p>"Why not? You never liked her."</p>

  <p>"I never liked her, no. Toward the end I hated her more than anything else
  in life. I hated her more than the filthiest vice or the most cowardly
  deed."</p>

  <p>"She deserved all that, June."</p>

  <p>"But what about God?"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't have cared for her much."</p>

  <p>"Wish it could have happened some other way... wish he had done it instead
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He did kill her, June, if there is a God. He killed her as much
  as&mdash;oh, well, anybody. Don't doubt that."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't get Scott to see it that way."</p>

  <p>"He'd have a hell of a time catching God."</p>

  <p>"He'd try to if he thought there was a ghost of a chance."</p>

  <p>"June?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dan."</p>

  <p>"How'd you like to go away?"</p>

  <p>"How go away?"</p>

  <p>"On a yacht, a fine big yacht. All over the world. Everywhere. Away from
  this mess. Out of reach. New places. A new suit of thoughts."</p>

  <p>"God, Dan, I'd love it. Could I have a new dress of thoughts?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear, and a hat."</p>

  <p>"Everything new from the skin out, Dan."</p>

  <p>"That goes with me as long as you don't change your skin."</p>

  <p>"Do you like my skin?"</p>

  <p>"The little I've been able to ogle."</p>

  <p>"We'll like each other a long time, Dan?"</p>

  <p>"Let's do it, June."</p>

  <p>"No matter what?"</p>

  <p>"No matter what."</p>

  <p>"And then we'll go away to everywhere on that yacht, won't we?"</p>

  <p>"If you'll slip me a kiss we will."</p>

  <p>"All right. I'm going now." June bent over Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, can I come in, lady?"</p>

  <p>"Great God, June, what's that?"</p>

  <p>A crushed face with desperate eyes was looking in at the window. It seemed
  to be suspended in space and terribly aware of the fact.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing there?" asked June. "Just what are you doing
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know, lady," spoke the face. "Risking life and limb, if you
  ask me, but Mr. Munson thinks I'm looking before clues."</p>

  <p>"Are you?"</p>

  <p>"What, me, lady? Looking? I'm just clutching Hanging on for dear
  life."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can't come in. That's that. Tell Mr. Munson so."</p>

  <p>"Oh, lady, I can't get down. Come look how I am all scrunched up and
  perilous."</p>

  <p>"You should have thought about that before you climbed up here."</p>

  <p>"I did, lady. That was all I thought of. Couldn't think of anything
  else."</p>

  <p>"Well, tell Mr. Munson you can't come in."</p>

  <p>The face looked earthward cautiously. "Mr. Munson," it wailed, "she says I
  can't come in."</p>

  <p>"Then snap on down," came the voice of Scott Munson.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that, lady?" asked the face. "`Snap on down,' says he.
  There's a fair sample for you. I'd snap like a twig if I hit the ground. Do
  let me come in, lady."</p>

  <p>"Let him in, June," said Daniel. "I'm interested to see just what is
  attached to a face like that."</p>

  <p>"You can come in," said June.</p>

  <p>"I'll always remember this, lady, and you, too, sir, in the bed. I'll
  always remember this and be grateful. Could you give me a hand, lady? It's
  more for the sake of confidence. A man just can't be courageous in the
  position I'm in. It would be foolhardy."</p>

  <p>June seized the outstretched hand and gave it a powerful pull. Face, body,
  and feet came clattering into the room.</p>

  <p>"Lady, you saved my life," said Officer Shad as he rose from the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Bring him over here, June?"</p>

  <p>From the left knee of the man's trousers Daniel picked a piece of red
  lint. Another piece clung to his elbow.</p>

  <p>"Now an envelope and my fountain-pen, old dear." He placed the lint in the
  envelope and wrote :</p>

  <p class="letter">Clues found on the body and person of one of your
  profession. With the compliments of Daniel Crewe.</p>

  <p>"Take that to Mr. Munson, officer, and call again at any time."</p>

  <p>"But not by the tree, sir. Never that tree again."</p>

  <p>"This is the way out," said June.</p>

  <p>"Where do I go when I leave here, lady?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, just go wandering round, barging in anywhere. Some day we'll find
  your body rotting in the halls." Officer Shad slid out with a shiver.</p>

  <p>"He spoiled a perfectly good kiss," complained June, returning to the
  bed.</p>

  <p>Daniel dressed slowly and went downstairs. He was wondering what had
  become of Sam Stoughten. He hadn't had a talk with Sam since the thing
  occurred. He would like to know what Sam was thinking. Munson had those
  letters.</p>

  <p>As he stepped out on the veranda his eyes fell on Barney, sitting crouched
  before his easel. Then Daniel transferred his gaze to the canvas. He was
  shocked to attention. A great trembling emptiness took the place of all other
  emotions. His brother was painting the scene of the crime with the murderer
  on the spot. So much was apparent at once to the eye although the picture was
  little more than commenced. There was the Rock caught in a pale unearthly
  radiance, and caught in the radiance also was the vague, half-formed figure
  of a man in a black domino with the hood removed. The figure although hardly
  more than an impression looked tall and gaunt, much like his own. Its arms
  were upraised frantically, and the face, indistinguishable, was lifted to the
  hidden source of the light.</p>

  <p>Daniel lost himself in the weird spirit of this terrible picture. Once
  more he was standing at the edge of the cliff with the first numbing
  realization of murder laying cold hands on his heart. He was alone there,
  sick and afraid. He had done it. He had murdered. He could feel again the
  flesh of the girl's bare shoulder. He could feel her slipping from him,
  twirling through the night to death.</p>

  <p>Daniel's lips began to tremble. Sweat broke from his forehead. He tried to
  take his eyes from the canvas, but the fascination of horror held them fixed.
  It was as if he were calling to himself, accusing himself, demonstrating his
  deed before the eyes of the world. Nothing Scott Munson could do or say would
  have the same uncanny power as had this picture to move him, to break down
  his resistance and self-control and finally to cause him to confess his
  crime. Here was the highest refinement of torture, conceived by his own
  brother.</p>

  <p>So absorbed had Daniel been in the picture that he had not noticed his
  brother's curious gaze fixed upon him. Barney had been noting with the
  insight of an artist every light and shade of emotion that passed across
  Daniel's face. He had been studying his brother's expressions, his open
  display of dread and horror, with morbidly bitter enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd appreciate it," he said in a strangely hostile voice. "I
  am doing it for your special edification."</p>

  <p>Daniel started, came back out of the picture, and looked at his brother.
  "Don't, kid," he said. "It's not like you."</p>

  <p>Barney laughed ironically. "It's exactly like me. I am like that."</p>

  <p>"You never hurt a soul in your life, Barney . . before."</p>

  <p>"No? Well, watch me from now on."</p>

  <p>Aunt Matty had come out and was standing by Daniel. She was staring at the
  picture with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Barney," she said, at last, "that's not nice. Why don't you paint
  something else&mdash;a rose or a rainbow?"</p>

  <p>"Or a pickle or a sponge or a cabbage," suggested Barney, with a sneer.
  "That picture isn't intended to be nice. I prefer to paint murderers. My
  inspiration stands beside you."</p>

  <p>Daniel led Aunt Matty back into the house and sat her down on a sofa in
  the library. The old lady, usually so game, was weeping softly.</p>

  <p>"There, there now," murmured Daniel, putting an arm round the frail body.
  "Barney isn't well yet. He doesn't mean what he says. He'll come back to us.
  Don't take on so."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what's come over this old house," said Aunt Matty. "It used
  to be a place of so much sea and sunlight, Danny. Laughter and comfort and
  the smell of the orchard. And you were both such good boys. All the time
  good. Why, you didn't ever drink much and cut up, not even after you were
  grown men. Good friends and happiness, and the servants all satisfied.
  Where's it all gone to, Danny? Overnight, all gone."</p>

  <p>"It will come back, Aunt Matty. We'll bring it back somehow."</p>

  <p>Daniel lied to the old lady, but his lies had to wind their way around a
  sizable lump in his throat. Those days, he knew, would never return. When he
  thought of the days ahead his heart failed him.</p>

  <p>"I think I could have stood anything," said Aunt Matty, "if you two boys
  were as you've always been. Barney's bitterness and accusations, Daniel, are
  breaking my heart. Why should he hold it against you?"</p>

  <p>"He's not himself," replied Daniel, wearily. "He'll come round presently.
  His nerves are shot, that's all."</p>

  <p>Aunt Matty lowered her voice to a confidential whisper. Her bright eyes
  snapped. "Everything started with that Emily-Jane," confided the old lady. "I
  wish I'd pushed her off that rock myself."</p>

  <p>Daniel derived no little comfort from the venomous wish of Aunt Matty. "I
  guess you're back to normal now," he said. "Let's not worry any more, or
  better still, let me do all the worrying for you. I'm used to it now."</p>

  <p>He stood up, then on a sudden impulse, bent over the bewildered and
  saddened old lady, and kissed her cheek. Then he left the room. Straight past
  Barney he walked, his eyes avoiding the easel, and across the lawnto the
  beach in search of Sam. He must be about somewhere.</p>

  <p>Then Daniel saw him. He was sitting on some rocks with Sue, and both
  looked miserable. When he joined them, the pair appeared relieved.</p>

  <p>"How's your arm?" asked Sam abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Doc Manning is quite proud of it, Sam. No need to trouble about the arm
  at all."</p>

  <p>"That was a strange thing," remarked Sue.</p>

  <p>"Stranger things have happened, Sue," said Daniel.</p>

  <p>Sam showed no interest in the strangeness of the thing.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Dan," continued Sue, "did Sam murder Emily-Jane?"</p>

  <p>"Don't mind me," put in Sam. "I'm somewhere else."</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask, Sue?"</p>

  <p>"Because I think he acts like a murderer. He's been sitting here muttering
  and grunting and scowling into my face. Why, you'd think he was a couple of
  murderers at least."</p>

  <p>"Do murderers go on like that, Sue?"</p>

  <p>"Well, they couldn't behave any worse."</p>

  <p>"Then, Sam did it. The mystery is solved."</p>

  <p>"I hope they catch him and hang him good," said Sue. "Then perhaps he'll
  come to his senses."</p>

  <p>"It might be just the thing he needs, a good old-fashioned hanging."</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha,"&mdash;the sound startled Daniel&mdash;"you're an amusing couple,
  you two. A regular pair of Neros, playing the fiddle while Rome burns. Munson
  will have us all hung if we don't slip him some arsenic mighty quick."</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you?" said Sue. "Those are the words of the worst type of
  murderer&mdash;a poisoner, no less."</p>

  <p>For some time three pairs of moody, trouble-touched eyes did their best to
  discourage the glinting surf playfully belaboring the sand, then as if at
  some unspoken command, the owners of the eyes arose without expectation and,
  mounting the bluff, filed across the lawn to the house. Sue went on ahead,
  but Sam and Daniel were stopped by Munson.</p>

  <p>"Thanks for your assistance, Daniel," said Munson, tapping the envelope
  containing the lint strands plucked from the body of Officer Shad, "but I
  hardly feel like using these. Your action has tied my hands."</p>

  <p>"Stow that stuff, Scott," replied Daniel good-naturedly. "You probably
  think you've got enough dope without them. You'll use them if you think
  they'll help you. My advice is to keep them, old man. You'll need everything
  you can get to convict an innocent man. However, it has been done."</p>

  <p>Munson's eyes snapped. "Thanks not my game, Daniel," he said. "And you
  know it."</p>

  <p>"Nobody seems to be running true to form these days, Scott," remarked
  Daniel.</p>

  <p>Bennett appeared at the corner of the house and approached them.</p>

  <p>"Bennett, I want you to meet two of our best suspects," said Scott, and he
  introduced them.</p>

  <p>"We're neck and neck," said Daniel, "vying for the honors."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope you both lose," said Bennett, with evident sincerity as he
  shook hands. "I never heard of a murderer before voluntarily contributing
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"It's my kind heart, Bennett," said Daniel. "I like to see everybody
  happy."</p>

  <p>As Daniel and Sam walked away Bennett's eyes followed them. "A cool
  customer," he remarked, referring to Daniel.</p>

  <p>"So damn cool," replied Munson, "I expect him to crack at any moment
  now."</p>

  <p>Just before they reached the veranda Sam halted Daniel. "Sorry as hell
  about that arm, Dan," he said rapidly. "I must have miscalculated. Daniel, I
  was desperate."</p>

  <p>"We won't talk about that, Sam," replied Daniel, "but isn't it one devil
  of a mess?"</p>

  <p>Barney was still painting, and in spite of every effort of will Daniel
  could not prevent himself from lingering over the picture. The old feeling
  gradually crept back, the old horror.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The inquest was over. Both procedure and verdict had gone
according to
  Munson's carefully laid plans. He had succeeded in protecting the family,
  sparing Barney's feelings, and saving the reputation of the dead girl. At the
  same time he had got exactly what he wanted, a clear field.</p>

  <p>The proceedings had attracted a little well-bred interest. About a dozen
  members of the Coastal Golf Club had motored over, more to pay their respects
  and to offer decently restrained condolences than to attend the inquest
  itself. Unalloyed astonishment seemed to be the prevailing mood. The thing
  was simply impossible. There must be some mistake. Then they had motored
  back; cocktail time was perilously close at hand. Daniel had been glad to see
  the last of them. Manning had proved helpful without appearing to be so. He
  had encouraged speedy departures and warded off embarrassing questions.</p>

  <p>One small creature composed entirely of eyes and legs did nothing else but
  look at Barney. He had scarcely been aware of her gaze. Her name was Sally
  Brent. Before the advent of Emily-Jane she had secretly entertained certain
  vaguely defined hopes. They were all about some day. She and Barney
  had&mdash;oh, well, there had always been Barney. Where was Barney now? He
  seemed to be lost in some utterly remote region behind his brooding eyes.
  Little Sally smiled gamely and allowed old Brent to drive her home. Just the
  same, she felt sure that, given the right opportunity, she could have brought
  a little comfort to her erstwhile playmate and companion. And any female from
  the age of eight, obsessed with this fine fancy, is a constant source of
  danger to the object of her solicitude.</p>

  <p>It was twilight now. Barney was sitting at his easel. All afternoon he had
  sat there, working away with crazy concentration. The painting on the large
  canvas was gradually beginning to take on depth and definition. Whatever
  genius Barney had was going into its creation. His feelings for the bizarre
  found expression here in a weird atmospheric treatment. It was as much a
  painting of a mood as it was of a place or person.</p>

  <p>Several yards away Daniel was standing, his eyes burning into the picture.
  Although Barney was aware of his brother's presence, he calmly continued with
  his brush. To Daniel there seemed to be something inevitable in the slow,
  unhesitating progress of the picture. It was like the sure-footed approach of
  Doom, dreadfully unhurried and confident. It was like a threat withheld until
  the time was ripe to strike. It was the face, the vague, cloudy,
  indistinguishable face of the figure that struck terror to Daniel's soul. It
  was his face. Daniel knew it. It had to be his face. He could see it. He
  could see himself staring into the damp, murky night, filled with the
  skimmed, sick drippings of a dying moon.</p>

  <p>Unconsciously Daniel's face had taken on the same expression it had worn
  at the time of the murder. His features were tortured and drawn, his neck
  cords taut, his body strained and rigid. All unknowingly, Daniel stood there,
  a self-confessed murderer.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson, appearing in the doorway, arrested his step, and took in the
  scene. From Daniel his eyes moved to the canvas, then back again to the
  agonized face. Munson received the impression that some terrible force, some
  impelling emotion, was goading Daniel against his will to offer himself as a
  model. Then a sigh escaped Daniel's lips and his body relaxed. He passed a
  hand across his eyes and moved away like a man who had just gone through some
  exhausting physical test. Then he saw Munson for the first time and turned
  away. Barney's bitter eyes looked mockingly into his. Helplessly he turned
  from side to side. He was trembling now, trembling inwardly. Every nerve in
  his body was lashing him with little nagging stings. In the back of his mind
  some dim glimmer of intelligence kept urging him to pull in, for the moment
  of danger was at hand. He breathed deeply and threw back his shoulders. His
  head went up. But he did not trust his tongue to speak. Silently he passed
  Munson and went upstairs to his room.</p>

  <p>Munson walked over to Barney and looked sorrowfully into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "You shouldn't do that. Daniel's always been damn good to
  you. Some day soon, Barney, I'm going to hurt you badly if only to bring you
  back to Dan."</p>

  <p>He was thinking of five letters his searching hand had encountered tucked
  in a vest hanging under a number of other garments in a dark corner of
  Daniel's closet.</p>

  <p>The net was being drawn closer round Daniel. Munson was morally convinced
  that he had committed the crime. He knew that with the evidence he had
  already in hand he could make him pay the extreme penalty. Yet there had been
  other people out that night, people with both motives and opportunity. An
  altogether new theory of the murder was forming itself in his mind. He would
  hold his hand for a while....</p>

  <p>And all that night in Daniel's room the light was kept burning. Whenever
  he turned it out the shadows of Barney and Emily-Jane kept flitting through
  the room.</p>

  <p>Thank God she had not screamed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; EYES THAT LOOKED ON MURDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SCOTT MUNSON was on a spot that interested him strangely. It
  was a lone narrow ledge about three feet wide, jutting out from High Point
  Rock four feet from its summit. Officers Shad and Red, flat on their
  respective stomachs, were following Munson's movements with eyes filled with
  alarm. Vicariously they were dying a thousand deaths as their chief,
  apparently indifferent to his unenviable position, twisted his way round the
  uneven face of the cliff. In some places the ledge narrowed to the width of a
  foot. When Munson approached these perilous crossings, the Shays
  automatically closed their eyes, and with indrawn breath listened acutely for
  the crash which to them was now merely a matter of moments.</p>

  <p>"With all the places on this neck of land to investigate," observed Red,
  "he would pick out this one."</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd pass out when he tried to lure us down there," commented
  his colleague.</p>

  <p>"My resignation was trembling on the tip of my tongue," replied Red.</p>

  <p>"He's mad," said Shad mildly, but with conviction.</p>

  <p>"Mad Munson," amplified the redder Shay, who had a flair for rugged
  names.</p>

  <p>This was Scott's third visit to the ledge, his third minute, inch by inch
  inspection. He had nothing to go on, nothing but his imagination, a memory
  that constantly eluded recapture, and a wild unsubstantial theory. And he had
  found nothing to justify his efforts. In one spot, which just so happened to
  be the right one, the moss had been disturbed. There were certain
  indentations. Along the ledge he found other similar marks, but these were so
  faint and undefined that he feared their discovery was due more to hope than
  to their actual presence. Nevertheless, this ledge and its possibilities
  fascinated him. It formed an essential part of this wild theory which in turn
  was based on nothing more definite than an unwarranted suspicion.</p>

  <p>His staff watched him return from the ledge with mingled emotions. It had
  enjoyed being horrified and at the same time it was relieved to find their
  leader still among them.</p>

  <p>"From now on," said Munson, brushing the earth from his hands, "your
  business will be to watch. Got guns?"</p>

  <p>"We have," replied Shad. "Mine seems awful heavy."</p>

  <p>"Bear up under your burden," said Munson, "and keep your eyes open. No one
  is to leave the grounds without my permission."</p>

  <p>It struck both Shad and his associate, who were at heart good-natured,
  sociably inclined spirits, that this new duty was going to be highly
  uncongenial. It presented so many opportunities for unpleasantness and
  friction, strained relations and mean looks. However, they accepted their new
  assignment with a fortitude worthy of the profession they so gracefully
  adorned.</p>

  <p>On leaving the point, Munson spoke to the local guard.</p>

  <p>"Bronson," he said, "you can go home now, and stay there if they'll let
  you. Tell them at the lockup. Mr. Munson suggested you take a couple of days
  off. Make sure that your chief hears you. I've finished with this place now.
  It's open to the public."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Bronson, smiling broadly upon the Shays. "I'll
  carry out your instructions to the letter."</p>

  <p>"A couple of days off," muttered Red, as he followed Munson along the
  Cliff Path. "Did you hear that? What do we get? Nothing but dangerous and
  disagreeable duty."</p>

  <p>"After he's through with us," said Shad, "I'm going to put in for a life
  pension."</p>

  <p>"If you have any life left to pension," amended his brother
  officer.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Now," said Munson to himself, "it's high time I did the
conventional
  thing. I am satisfied about her feet. They could easily have been the feet
  I'm looking for."</p>

  <p>He found old Griggs in the orchard, doing helpful things to a peach
  tree.</p>

  <p>"Griggs," he said, coming at once to the point, "was your helper out on
  the night of the murder or the accident or whatever it was?"</p>

  <p>"He was, sir," replied Griggs. "I've been waiting for this, Mr. Munson. He
  was out late, and he hasn't been the same lad since. Got something on his
  mind, but I'd stake my life he had no hand in it."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," agreed Munson heartily, experiencing a strange sensation.
  Did he really want to hear the boy's story? He had to hear it. Nothing left
  for him to do. "What's his name, Griggs? I want to see him. Will you get him
  for me?"</p>

  <p>"His name's Tom," said Griggs, as he went in search of his assistant.</p>

  <p>Munson knew Tom although Tom was not aware of that fact. To put it
  accurately, Munson did not actually know the boy, but he knew the most
  important thing about him and that had to do with Betty, the maid. Tom was in
  love with this healthy wench, and very much in love at that. He was a boy
  with bangs, Tom. A boy with freckles and bangs. Good blue eyes that made up
  for everything, including a slight stoop and a pronounced tendency to
  stammer.</p>

  <p>"Tom," said Munson, leading the boy aside, "there's no trouble in this for
  you unless you fail to tell the exact truth. Stick to that and I'm your
  friend. It's all very simple and easy. All you have to do is to answer my
  questions. Here's the first one. Why were you and Betty out so late on the
  night of the accident?"</p>

  <p>"T-t-t&mdash;" Tom swallowed and began things afresh. "T-t-t-'t weren't no
  accident, Mr. Munson." His words fell out in fragments.</p>

  <p>With one question Munson had covered a lot of ground. But Tom, willing as
  he was to talk, was handicapped by nature. Munson did not like to listen to
  him. It made him feel spasmodic. He considered the situation a moment, then
  looked about the orchard. Far down toward the salt marshes were a bench and
  an old battered wicker rocking-chair. A pleasant, secluded, unassuming
  retreat. There he would hear the story.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Tom," he said. "We all ought to be in on this, you, Betty, and I.
  It's important. Now just run up to the house and bring Betty back to me. I'll
  meet you down there." He pointed to the bench.</p>

  <p>Betty, her vital young eyes bright although her cheeks had lost some of
  their color, showed no reluctance to talk once she was assured that the state
  of her virtue was not under investigation, that it was, in fact, taken for
  granted.</p>

  <p>"We were out late, Mr. Munson," she admitted readily enough, "because the
  party didn't break up until half past two, and I was helping to serve."</p>

  <p>Munson, sitting, insecurely in the rain-warped wicker chair, nodded and
  continued to think. Might as well skip a lot of ground, he decided. Why lead
  up to it by dramatic stages? Get the worst over at once&mdash;the
  confirmation of his suspicions, of his convictions, by eye-witnesses. Then he
  would do what had to be done, and the case would be over. Over, yes, but not
  before he had had a talk with young Barney and brought him back to poor Dan.
  His brother would need him now.</p>

  <p>"Then you actually stood under those high bushes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We did, sir," replied Betty, and Tom nodded. "We were afraid of being
  seen and misunderstood."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Betty," said Munson in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Betty settled herself on the bench and cast Tom a look of importance as if
  she suspected the poor boy of not understanding what it was all about. It was
  a look that meant, "What I saw you saw and there's no two ways about it." Tom
  seemed to understand.</p>

  <p>"It was late," began Betty, "and I was so hot from running here and there
  that I wanted to cool off before going to bed. Tom took me down to the Rock.
  We started out right away, about half past two. Well, we got there all right
  and the moon was just rising. Not much of a moon, though."</p>

  <p>"Meet anyone on the way?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," replied Betty. "We walked to the edge of the Rock and stood
  looking out awhile, looking and talking and wondering sort of. Then we walked
  round the point to get a view of the marshes. Terribly mysterious they looked
  in the moonlight. When we came back we were scared stiff to see Miss
  Emily-Jane and that man Holt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Betty," Munson broke in. He had detected a note of anger
  in the girl's voice. "You don't seem to like Mr. Holt. Why?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't let me alone since the first day he arrived," replied Betty.
  "Doesn't ever seem to get wise to himself. He just can't believe I won't fall
  for him."</p>

  <p>Tom shifted restlessly on the bench and muttered some brief, private
  observation about a dog.</p>

  <p>"Well, you saw them standing there," said Munson. "Then what, Betty?"</p>

  <p>"We didn't want to pass them," she continued, "so we stopped behind those
  high bushes. They were having a long argument, and drinking. He was urging
  her to give up Mr. Barney and go away with him. She just laughed. Then,
  suddenly, his arms went out and he grabbed her. They were swaying there on
  the edge of the cliff.</p>

  <p>"At that moment there was a thrashing in the bushes, and out comes a black
  figure with a hood on its head. It rushed over to Holt and tried to drag him
  away. Then out pops another black figure and starts for the scramble, but it
  stops, this figure does. Stops sudden, just like it saw something unexpected.
  From where we stood, looking round the edge of the bushes, we could see plain
  enough, but we didn't see what that second figure saw. All we saw was the
  first figure slashing at that man Holt, trying to get him away from the girl,
  and Holt pushing with all his might. He swung round suddenly, and Miss
  Emily-Jane went over the edge of the cliff."</p>

  <p>"Did she scream?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"She made no sound."</p>

  <p>"Funny, that," thought Munson, "if she saw it coming." Aloud he asked,
  "Did you recognize either of the hooded figures, Betty? Think well. It
  doesn't mean anything, but I'd just like to get an idea."</p>

  <p>Apparently this question was not to Betty's liking.</p>

  <p>She looked everywhere but into Munson's dark, steady eyes, which never
  left her face.</p>

  <p>"It can do no harm, Betty," he said quietly, "and it might help me a
  lot."</p>

  <p>Betty considered. "It's just a guess," she said, "so you can't hold it
  against me, and if it will help, I'll tell. The figure that tried to save
  Miss Emily-Jane was just about the size of Mr. Dan. The one that scuttled
  back into the bushes was heavy like Mr. Stoughten. That's the best I can
  do."</p>

  <p>"And after that, Betty?"</p>

  <p>"Holt split off through the darkness," the girl went on, "and left the
  tall black figure standing alone on the rock. And it stripped off its hood,
  Mr. Munson"&mdash;here Betty's voice took an an overtone of awe and she
  hesitated a moment&mdash;"and it was Mr. Dan. I lied about that. It was Mr.
  Dan and I saw his face. It was terrible, so full of pain and suffering it
  was. Just like he was being nailed to some invisible cross. He just stood
  there all the while on the rock, then he left the rock and went down into the
  darkness below."</p>

  <p>"By the pathway, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Munson."</p>

  <p>The three of them sat in silence awhile, each one picturing the scene,
  then Munson spoke. "And after that, Betty?"</p>

  <p>"We waited about ten minutes and went home."</p>

  <p>"Did you meet anybody on the way, or see anybody about the house?"</p>

  <p>"Only Miss June. She was just coming out of the pantry. Said she was
  having a cup of tea for herself. Had one shoe off. Said her feet hurt
  her."</p>

  <p>"And was that what you saw, Tom?"</p>

  <p>Betty's glance seemed to set off some mechanism in Tom's anatomy which in
  turn started his head nodding in violent agreement.</p>

  <p>"All except the Miss June part," corrected Betty, "Tom sleeps in one of
  the outhouses with the men. It's the same house where you've lodged those two
  queer officers that keep following you about."</p>

  <p>Munson smiled. "And why didn't you tell me about this before?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"We were both afraid we might lose our places," replied Betty. "We like it
  here together and all. It didn't seem to matter much about Miss Emily-Jane. I
  didn't like her."</p>

  <p>"But suppose we should have convicted an innocent man? What would you have
  done then?"</p>

  <p>"I'd have snitched long before that," the girl explained.</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime you were perfectly willing to let me work my head off
  looking for the murderer?"</p>

  <p>"We decided it would give you something to do. We were interested to see
  if you'd guess right. Did you?"</p>

  <p>Once more Munson smiled, this time in spite of his irritation. "I don't
  guess," he said. "I have to know."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do, Mr. Munson? Do you mind telling?"</p>

  <p>"This," said Munson. "I'm going to let you go now with the strict
  understanding that you'll say nothing. You've really placed yourselves within
  the reach of the law by withholding this information. You'll have to make up
  for it now. When I'm ready I'll let you know and then I want you to repeat
  your story before Mr. Holt and probably in the presence of Sergeant Bennett.
  Will you do that for me?"</p>

  <p>They readily agreed and departed almost on tiptoe, like sobered children.
  Munson remained where he was. He was lost in thought. He was very much afraid
  that Betty's story wouldn't quite wash. It was true enough as far as it went.
  She believed she had seen what she had told him, but unconsciously she had
  been biased in her vision.</p>

  <p>As a result she had presented Lane Holt in the light shed by her own
  opinion of him. She had seen him as the murderer and Daniel as the hero
  rushing to the rescue. No, it wouldn't wash; at least, Munson was not so
  sure. Her narrative of the actual killing had been too confused. Either one
  of them might have pushed the girl off, in spite of the fact that Betty
  claimed Holt had deliberately tried to do so, while Daniel had done just the
  opposite and attempted to save Emily-Jane. After all, Betty's story might go
  with a jury, particularly when corroborated by the enslaved Tom. Strong
  evidence, if properly rehearsed and presented. Why not go ahead with it? Lane
  Holt was no good. What was his life worth compared with Daniel's or Sam's?
  Munson was sorely tempted. It would be so very easy with the clues he had in
  hand, and the situation would be saved. Certainly of the three Holt acted the
  guiltiest. Well, all he could do was to put Betty's story to the test, to
  confront Lane Holt with it and to study his reactions. In the face of such
  overwhelming direct evidence he might, if he were guilty, break down and
  confess.</p>

  <p>Rising from his chair, he walked slowly back to the house through the old
  orchard. He skirted the side of the house and came out on the lawn. He
  wondered if Emily-Jane's body had been sent away yet, and seeing June Lansing
  sitting alone under the shade of a tree, he strolled over and asked her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said June calmly. "Emily-Jane has seen the last of Crewe House. A
  most unbereaved-looking old lady arrived while you were off somewhere, and
  carried her back to Ohio. Strange thing, that. Never even knew she came from
  Ohio. Somehow she didn't act as if she had come from there."</p>

  <p>"Did you receive the old lady, or Aunt Matty?"</p>

  <p>"The pair of us did. She was an odd old thing. Some sort of an aunt or
  other. She didn't seem to know what it was all about or to care a rap. Just
  duty. She was doing it."</p>

  <p>"Say anything about Emily-Jane?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly knew her, she said. Emily-Jane rarely came home. Couldn't drag her
  back except for a few weeks at a time."</p>

  <p>"How did Barney act?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't act. Just kept on painting. He's mad." June lit another
  cigarette. "He's funny. The body was taken out the back way, so he didn't
  even see it leave. Anyway he hasn't been interested in Emily-Jane's body
  since the life went out of it. Looked at it once, then hurried away. For him
  Emily-Jane had ceased to exist. The body didn't matter. And all he said when
  he looked at her was, `And back of all that beauty&mdash;' He never finished
  his sentence." June tossed her cigarette away and lit another one. "Wish it
  was all over," she said. "Our Emily-Jane left a lot of trouble behind. She
  ran true to form to the last, Scott."</p>

  <p>"You're smoking too much, June," said Munson. "I've been noticing it of
  late."</p>

  <p>He rose and walked away. June's ale-colored eyes with their little
  speckles dwelt on him thoughtfully. She held out one hand and watched it. The
  fingers trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Guess he's right," she said to herself. "My nerves are going, too."</p>

  <p>Munson started for his room. On his way up he met Aunt Matty, who had
  evidently sought refuge in trifles, for she was fussing about a lost domino,
  one that had never been worn.</p>

  <p>"There were six of them," she was telling Betty,who gave the impression of
  being only mildly interested, "and now there are only five. The new one's
  gone."</p>

  <p>The old lady managed to cram so much tragedy into this last statement that
  Munson smiled as he mounted the stairs. Then suddenly he stopped, his foot
  half raised for the next step. Where was that lost domino, he wondered. That
  was it. Was that domino actually lost or&mdash; A great shouting somewhere
  outside interrupted this interesting line of thought. Munson ran down the
  stairs and out to the veranda.</p>

  <p>At the far end of the lawn, the end nearest the road, he made out a long
  pair of legs frantically raised aloft. Upon approaching these legs he
  discovered they were joined to the attenuated trunk of Officer Shad. Clutched
  in the officer's arms as if it were a pearl of great price, was the head of
  Lane Holt. On the fringe of this grotesque struggle, Officer Red was capering
  excitedly, revolver in hand.</p>

  <p>"You hold him, and I'll shoot him," he was shouting for the benefit of the
  prostrate Shay.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, don't shoot," cried Shad. "Things are bad enough as they
  are. This devil's trying to bite my ear clean offen my head."</p>

  <p>Munson silently enjoyed the scene until he saw Officer Red take deliberate
  aim at the beautifully exposed though earnestly animated rear section of Mr.
  Lane Holt. It was an irresistible target. Munson appreciated the fact, but
  felt called upon to intervene.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Red," he remarked. "I'd like to take a try myself, but the
  situation doesn't justify it, I'm afraid. Put your gun away." Then he
  addressed Officer Shad. "Let him up, Shad," he said. "You have done
  well."</p>

  <p>Shad seemed to think so himself, as he released the head and arose from
  the scene of battle.</p>

  <p>"He was trying to do a bunk," he announced, pointing to a partially
  strangled Holt. "We told him to stop, but he wouldn't. So," concluded Shad
  with modest satisfaction, "we stopped him."</p>

  <p>"How about it, Holt?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"They're crazy as hell," exclaimed Holt. "I was mooning about down here
  after Emily-Jane had gone&mdash;I'd seen the last of her going down the
  road&mdash;and I wasn't paying much attention to anything, when all of a
  sudden these two lunatics rushed out from behind a bush and told me to stop.
  Naturally I told them to go to hell, and kept on walking. Then without word
  of warning they jumped on my back and down I went. Ever since then I've just
  been trying to get up. That's all."</p>

  <p>"He damn well near bit my ear off," said Officer Shad, applying a tender
  hand to the left side of his long head.</p>

  <p>"You would have been well avenged if Mr. Munson hadn't stopped me," said
  Officer Red.</p>

  <p>"There seems to have been a general misunderstanding," Munson observed,
  "but I must admit you boys did well. I'm proud of you. Carry on."</p>

  <p>Taking Holt by the arm he led him back across the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Holt," he said, "if you feel up to it, I'd like to have you meet me in
  the little study at the far end of the house in about half an hour." He
  looked at his watch. "It's eleven-thirty now and luncheon is not until one.
  Think you can make it?"</p>

  <p>The man shrugged his drooping shoulders rather hopelessly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell, what does it matter anyway?" he said in a flat voice. "I'll be
  there.... Might as well get it over. I don't care a damn now one way or
  anotherbut I suggest you have a little talk with your good friend
  Daniel."</p>

  <p>He broke away from Munson and went into the house. Munson found Bennett,
  who had just returned from making inquiries at the neighboring houses in an
  endeavor to ascertain if any of the servants had been near High Point Rock on
  the night of the murder. He had had no luck. When Munson told him his story
  his eyes lighted up.</p>

  <p>"Then that settles everything," he said. "We'll drill a confession out of
  his hide and I'll take him to the lockup right off. You've got the case on
  ice, Mr. Munson."</p>

  <p>But Scott only smiled wearily as he turned toward the house. "I'm not so
  sure, Bennett," he said. "Sometimes you can't depend on the accuracy of eye-
  witnesses even."</p>

  <p>"But their story would convince any jury."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Scott, "and that's what irks me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; DEATH COMES INDOORS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DANIEL'S study was like a happy thought on a dull day. It
  was an unexpected relief. At the extreme left end of the house, it was
  approached by way of a long crazy corridor that ambled past a series of
  pleasant rooms, each of which invited the passer to enter and linger awhile.
  It was not so much a study as it was a retreat&mdash;an escape from boredom
  when life turned drab. Here there were books and comfortable chairs and the
  smell of tobacco. Its front windows gave to the lawn and the broad sweep of
  the Sound; those at the side commanded a view of the orchard with the
  glinting streams of the salt marshes caught in the arms of the trees. From
  the study a door led directly to the veranda where it curved round the house,
  and here there were several easy chairs. It was like a private deck on an
  ocean liner, an essential part of the whole, yet cut off and remote.</p>

  <p>It was by way of the veranda door that Munson and Bennett now entered. The
  room seemed lost to the world, so still and tranquil it was. And Daniel was a
  part of its stillness. At one of the side windows he was standing in an
  attitude of tense immobility. Deep in thought, he stood with his sunken eyes
  brooding out over the salt marshes where the sluggish streams twisted through
  the reeds. On his face was an expression of utter weariness and defeat. His
  was the face of a man who was very much alone with himself.</p>

  <p>The two men were in the room before he turned from the window. He regarded
  them in silence for amoment; then an expression of resignation came into his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen," he said in a quiet voice, "I suppose you want me?"</p>

  <p>"Why should we want you, Dan?" asked Munson quickly.</p>

  <p>"For murder," he replied in level tones. "That's all you want anyone for
  these days, Scott."</p>

  <p>"Well, this time, Daniel, we're not after you, but your room. Mr. Lane
  Holt has promised to meet us here for a chatty half-hour. I've a feeling he's
  got an interesting story to tell. I've the same feeling about you and Sam,
  and I've promised myself the pleasure of listening to those stories within
  the next few days."</p>

  <p>Daniel slightly inclined his head. "I shall try to make mine as
  interesting as possible and as unenlightening."</p>

  <p>Munson smiled rather sadly. "Things have gone far beyond that, Daniel," he
  said. "We'll have to have a showdown soon. You know I can't keep stalling on
  the job forever."</p>

  <p>Holt entered the room by way of the corridor. Daniel faced him squarely.
  Their eyes met, and those of Holt were filled with an insane hatred. He
  looked upon Daniel as the cause of all the misery through which he had
  passed, the nights and days of cold, pursuing fear. But for Daniel,
  Emily-Jane would be alive today, and he, Holt, would be safe... and
  happy.</p>

  <p>His lips bared his white, even teeth as he uttered one word,
  "Murderer!"</p>

  <p>On the silence of the room the word fell jarringly, accusingly. Daniel
  received it with an expressionless face. He seemed to be considering the man
  before him as if he were some microscopic specimen. Presently he spoke. His
  voice was quiet and well controlled.</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to wonder about that," he said, and walked to the veranda
  door where he stopped and looked back. "Holt," he continued, "you don't
  deserve to live, and I've a strange feeling that you won't live much longer."
  He grinned and passed through the door. His tall figure could be seen
  stalking across the lawn.</p>

  <p>"What the devil did he mean by that?" asked Holt nervously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing good for you," said Sergeant Bennett, with a grim smile. "I
  wouldn't be alone with him if I were in your place."</p>

  <p>Munson was looking worried. Just what had Daniel meant, anyway? His remark
  had made Scott feel jumpy. He shrugged his shoulders. Probably Daniel had
  only wanted to throw a scare into Holt. Well, Holt was scared enough as it
  was. No need to paint the lily. He turned to the rather pitiful object of his
  thoughts and studied his fear-haunted, feverish eyes with their thinly veiled
  depths of hate. His scrutiny convinced him that Holt's mind was sick, that
  the man had already departed from the rational ways of thinking and was
  keeping to the tracks merely through fear and force of habit. A thin ray of
  pity momentarily touched Munson. Perhaps, after all, Emily-Jane's going out
  had left an empty place in the life of this creature who stood dejectedly
  before him, as rotten as he was.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he said in a kindly voice, for he realized that Lane Holt was
  about to be subjected to a test that would tax the strongest nerves, and he
  had grave doubts regarding the man's ability to stand it.</p>

  <p>Holt, without speaking, slumped lethargically into an easy chair and kept
  his eyes on the floor. The kindly tone affected by Munson had increased
  rather than diminished his fear. It was suggestive of a bountiful meal just
  previous to execution. Munson could afford to be kindly only when things were
  going his way. Holt entertained the morbid impression that the two men were
  looking at him as if he were already dead. He moved uneasily in his chair.
  His gaze strayed over the floor&mdash;anywhere but up.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said at last, irritably, "did you get me here just to look at
  me? Let's get this over."</p>

  <p>"All right, Bennett," said Munson. "You can bring Betty and Tom here now.
  You'll find them at the back of the house."</p>

  <p>Bennett was not long in returning with the maid and her lumbering but
  obedient slave. Munson saw them comfortably seated and made them feel at
  ease. The expression of fear deepened in Holt's eyes. He had given the pair
  one quick glance, but had refused to meet Betty's accusing gaze.</p>

  <p>"Now, Betty," said Munson in an easy voice, "all you have to do is to sit
  there and tell your story just as if you were telling it to someone in no way
  concerned with the case. Understand? Make everything clear, but be sure about
  your details, and don't for the love of Pete imagine things. Just stick to
  what you know, what you actually heard and saw."</p>

  <p>The girl had her story clearly briefed in her mind by this time, and she
  told it with a simple conviction that left no room for doubting her
  sincerity. As her participation in the events of the night unfolded, Holt's
  eyes gradually crept up from the floor until they rested on Betty's full red
  lips as if held there by some terrible attraction. Occasionally Munson
  interrupted the story to ask Holt a question.</p>

  <p>"Did you quarrel, Holt, while you were standing there near the edge of the
  cliff?"</p>

  <p>"No," came Holt's unsteady voice, "we didn't quarrel at all. At first we
  argued a little, but after a while we gave that up."</p>

  <p>"All right, Betty, go on."</p>

  <p>And Betty went on to the ghastly climax, which seemed more ghastly still
  because of the stark simplicity with which she narrated it. Holt was on his
  feet, his face working and lips dry. There was a kind of hopeless desperation
  in his eyes. He spoke like a man who had no expectation of being believed,
  yet his words were urgent, pleading.</p>

  <p>"She's wrong," he said. "They didn't see that. The whole thing was
  confused. How could she tell what happened? Right up to the end of her story
  she sticks to the facts, except about our quarreling. Then at the most
  important part she deliberately reverses what actually happened. It doesn't
  make sense. What reason had I for killing Emily-Jane? I tell you I was fond
  of her in my way, and she was fond of me. I had nothing to fear from her. You
  have Sam Stoughten's letters. There's a motive for you, stronger than any you
  can pin on me."</p>

  <p>"But you wanted those letters, Holt," Munson quietly reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell, yes!" cried Holt. "Perhaps I did, but that was after the thing
  had happened. I only thought of them then. I'm a rotter, if you want to have
  it that way, but I didn't murder Emily-Jane."</p>

  <p>"Then you mean you won't confess?" asked Ben-nett. "You're going through
  with it? What's the sense, man, in the face of all this evidence&mdash;two
  eyewitnesses, your flask at the scene of the crime, your actions after the
  crime, and your admitted relationship with the dead girl? Why drag out the
  misery, Holt? It will come to the same thing in the end."</p>

  <p>Munson had remained silent. He preferred to let Bennett try his hand. He
  was more convinced than ever that Lane Holt was innocent, yet he could not
  brush aside the testimony of two obviously sincere eyewitnesses. Everything
  was unsatisfactory about this case. Munson heartily wished he was out of it.
  Holt turned to him.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to arrest me on that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Munson considered while Bennett watched him eagerly. "I don't know," he
  said at last. "I'm not sure, but stick around, Holt. We might be wanting you
  at any minute."</p>

  <p>Holt started to say something, then gave it up as if the effort were too
  hopeless. His whole being was dipped in a clinging hatred of Daniel Crewe.
  Everyone was on Daniel's side. If he could only get back at Daniel. If he
  could only pin the guilt on him. Holt felt that he would willingly sacrifice
  anything for that. He left the room unsteadily, holding on to the frame of
  the door for support. In the library he sat down at Daniel's great desk and
  thought. With the hounds of fear rushing across his brain he found that he
  could still think clearly and to some purpose. Gradually an evil smile
  twisted his white lips. "They'll have to believe that," he said to himself.
  "There will be no getting round it."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Daniel found June in her favorite chair on the lawn. She
was doing
  nothing, absolutely nothing. Her thoughts were adrift in space. And although
  her expression was calm and composed, Daniel felt that her spirit was tense
  and waiting. He could not account for this feeling. Yet he knew that June was
  passing through her own little private hell and that be was responsible. The
  realization of this was almost more than he could bear. How could he confess
  when she was fighting silently with the truth in her heart? What was Holt
  saying to Munson back there in the study? Was he telling what he knew, and
  would Scott Munson believe him?</p>

  <p>June looked up and smiled. "There's a chair," she said, pointing to one
  with her foot. "Drag it over here and fold up your great length in it."</p>

  <p>"Munson has collared Holt," said Daniel, doing as he was bidden. "They've
  got him in there now."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to hear his story, Dan."</p>

  <p>"So would I, and then again I wouldn't."</p>

  <p>She turned in her chair and looked at him in a way that was unusual for
  her. Her eyes were so tender and unhappy... they were lonely, those eyes of
  June's. Daniel felt himself powerless to help her.</p>

  <p>"You have nothing to fear, Daniel," she told him. "Don't mind what lies
  Holt may tell. Munson will deal with him."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe that, June?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dan. Stick it out."</p>

  <p>"Together we'll see it through."</p>

  <p>"We'll see it through and farther."</p>

  <p>"How about our yacht?"</p>

  <p>"Is there such a thing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, June. It's a swell yacht."</p>

  <p>"Manning?"</p>

  <p>"Through Manning."</p>

  <p>She pondered awhile in silence, then, "Well, keep the yacht in mind, Dan."
  Her voice broke and she turned her head away. "Although it may be only a
  crazy hunch."</p>

  <p>His hand was gripping hers. "Come back and fight, June," he pleaded.</p>

  <p>"Half a minute, old dear. I'll fight."</p>

  <p>"And you know?"</p>

  <p>Her head sank on her breast. "Dan," she whispered, "I've always
  known."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, June." His voice was dead.</p>

  <p>She turned on him fiercely. "Then don't be sorry. I'm only sorry for
  you."</p>

  <p>"And me for you, dear."</p>

  <p>A long silence, then June, "We'll make the grade somehow."</p>

  <p>"In our yacht?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," she smiled. "That yacht's gotten the best of you."</p>

  <p>"I've always been fond of the sea, June, you know."</p>

  <p>She was holding everything back now. Her teeth were set, and her hands
  gripped the arms of her chair. "I know, Dan. I like it, too."</p>

  <p>"All the world and places," he murmured, his eyes on the broad blue Sound.
  "Clear of this dismal damn mess."</p>

  <p>"That's the way I like to hear you talk. Your old face looks so worn."</p>

  <p>And he rested his head on her shoulder, but he wasn't very comfortable.
  Neither was June.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Since the death of Emily-Jane, meals at Crewe House had
been rather
  sketchy affairs. Attendance had been unreliable. For a long time now Aunt
  Matty hadn't known what the world was ever coming to. And no matter how often
  and thoroughly she washed her hands of everything she was still very much
  involved.</p>

  <p>At luncheon both Holt and Daniel were absent, which, according to Aunt
  Matty, made it a pretty state of affairs. The head of the house not sitting
  down at his own table, and his own blood brother gnawing away like a dog and
  saying never a word.</p>

  <p>"But what's the use of being head of the house unless you can do as you
  please?" asked June.</p>

  <p>Aunt Matty cast her an indignant look. "There isn't any head to this
  house," she pronounced, "and still less tail."</p>

  <p>Sue Stoughten laughed so earnestly over this that Aunt Matty thought she
  had really been funny. The old lady felt much better.</p>

  <p>Munson endeavored to lead Sam into the ways of speech, but Sam, suspecting
  a trap, was sparing of his words. Bennett, who had stayed for luncheon at
  Munson's invitation, gave an admirable demonstration of well-controlled but
  effective eating. Barney, as Aunt Matty had put it, just gnawed away in
  stubborn silence.</p>

  <p>Then came the shot&mdash;the sound of a shot.</p>

  <p>White faces lifted and forks suspended. For what were they waiting? No one
  seemed to know. They were held there because all their instincts told them
  urgently that they did not want to know. There had been enough of
  tragedy&mdash;enough of death. Keep out of it. Don't know. Don't try to find
  out.</p>

  <p>Bennett, however, wanted to know and intended to find out. The sound of
  the shot had hardly died away before he was out of the dining-room and up the
  stairs. For only a moment he paused, then ran down the hall to an open door.
  Daniel was standing in it, a piece of paper crushed in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Come back in here with me, Mr. Crewe," said Bennett in a quietly
  commanding voice, as he brushed past Daniel and entered the room. Daniel,
  like a person in a hypnotic condition, turned and followed the detective.
  Below at the foot of the stairs, Scott Munson sarcastically excused himself
  as he passed between Officers Shad and Red, each politely insisting that the
  other ascend first.</p>

  <p>Bennett stood in the middle of the room and took in the situation. At a
  large table Lane Holt sat. He was sprawled out and his head was flung back
  and he was dead. In his right hand he held a pen, and in his left temple
  there was a hole made by a bullet fired at close range.</p>

  <p>Munson was there now. Mechanically he felt the man's heart. It would never
  again harbor hate or fear.</p>

  <p>"Well, he's out of the case," said Munson, looking regretfully down at the
  grotesque figure. "This leaves us about half-way up a tree."</p>

  <p>For a moment he looked about him, then he deliberately placed a chair
  against the wall where he commanded a full view of the room, and sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Daniel," he said, his voice sounding tired and strained.
  "Bennett, go to the door and ask those two faces please to withdraw. They
  confuse me. Tell one of them to telephone the coroner and tell him to bring a
  doctor. Then come back here and stand by my chair. I want you to see with
  me."</p>

  <p>When Bennett had dispatched the stunned Shays he returned to Munson's
  chair and once more looked about the room.</p>

  <p>"Take notes," said Munson. "I want you to remember everything. Daniel, you
  say, was just leaving the room when you reached the door. He had a piece of
  crumpled paper in his hand. Put that down. Now just make brief notes as I go
  along. Pen in dead man's right hand. Wound in left temple fired at close
  range. Handkerchief on floor at left side. Ink bottle open. Service revolver
  at far end of room under window. Probably thrown there by murderer. Is it
  your gun, Daniel?" His eyes met Daniel's and Daniel nodded. "Go on with the
  notes, Bennett," said Munson. "Service revolver the admitted property of
  Daniel Crewe. Now draw a line." Munson looked up. "All right, Daniel," he
  said, then added, "Get this, Bennett."</p>

  <p>"My story's so simple," replied Daniel, "it sounds foolish."</p>

  <p>"Tell it," said Munson.</p>

  <p>"I was in my room." Daniel spoke in a detached, matter-of-fact voice.
  "Lane Holt called me. His words were : `Daniel, please come here.' He sounded
  urgent. I got up from the bed and walked across the hall. There was a shot.
  As I opened the door I thought I heard something scraping across the floor. I
  entered the room but saw nothing moving. Holt was as he is now. I went to him
  and saw he was dead. Then I saw what he had been writing and I took the sheet
  of paper, hoping to get away with it. Bennett stopped me at the door.
  And"&mdash; Daniel smiled sardonically&mdash;"that's all."</p>

  <p>"Bring me the paper, Bennett."</p>

  <p>Daniel relinquished his hold on the paper. It dropped into Bennett's
  outstretched hand. He brought it over to Munson, who smoothed it out and
  read:</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Munson :</p>

  <p>I am going to hand you this statement to read, because whenever I try to
  tell you the truth I can see you don't believe me and then I lose my
  nerve.</p>

  <p>Everything that Betty said was true. I agree in every detail with two
  exceptions. We did not quarrel. I did not touch Emily-Jane. Daniel Crewe
  deliberately murdered her, and if you want to find out the facts I dare you
  to grill Sam Stoughten. At the same time ask him who did the stabbing.</p>

  <p>If you're so damned honest think this over. Daniel Crewe is the
  murd...<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>At the point where the statement broke off there was a small splash of
  ink. The lower part of the letter was smeared where the writing had not yet
  dried.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready to go, Daniel?" Munson's voice was toneless.</p>

  <p>"I didn't do it, Scott."</p>

  <p>"It's better to be arrested for this murder than the other one." There
  seemed to be some hidden significance in Scott's words.</p>

  <p>Daniel left the room with Bennett. Munson sank back in his chair. When
  Judson, the coroner, arrived with the doctor he was still sitting in the same
  position.</p>

  <p>"Another killing, Judson," he said. "I'd like to hold the inquest at four
  tomorrow. Let me see." He looked at his watch. "That will give me a little
  less than twenty-seven hours."</p>

  <p>"It looks like a fairly simple case," Judson observed after he had heard
  the details. "I'm sorry as hell for Daniel Crewe. He's a fine lad." He paused
  and looked round the room, then said in a puzzled voice, "I wonder what the
  devil's got into this old house anyway?"</p>

  <p>"You tell me," said Munson.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"I didn't do it, June." Daniel spoke rapidly while Bennett
stood by. He
  admired Daniel Crewe.</p>

  <p>"Can you prove it, Dan?" June's face was deathly pale, but her voice was
  as calm as ever and her eyes held no hint of fear.</p>

  <p>Daniel shook his head and grinned from complete frustration. "It's silly,"
  he said. "It's so damned pat. Why, it couldn't look more convincing if I'd
  dragged him into the dining-room and strangled him before your eyes."</p>

  <p>"What does Scott think?"</p>

  <p>"What can he think?" Daniel hesitated, remembering Munson's words. "He
  acted sort of funny, though," he added. "Seemed to have something on his
  mind."</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said June.</p>

  <p>"Think so?" said Daniel.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," she repeated, and kissed him. Then she turned to Bennett
  and smiled, "Take him away, officer."</p>

  <p>Daniel stepped into the waiting car and was driven down the road. June
  stood there waving to him until the trees dosed over the car.</p>

  <p>Barney at his easel watched his brother depart. Save for a slight
  tightening round the lips his expression did not change.</p>

  <p>June sank into a chair and let the tears chase each other down her
  freckled cheeks. Barney tried to pretend he did not notice her. He began to
  fidget fretfully on his stool. Finally he put down his brushes and looked at
  her uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that," he commanded explosively. "What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"I'm crying, you young fool. Crying like hell." "Why?"</p>

  <p>"They've arrested Daniel."</p>

  <p>"Good. Why?"</p>

  <p>"They claim he shot Lane Holt."</p>

  <p>"What's he doing, anyway&mdash;making a hobby of it?"</p>

  <p>"Barney, I could kill you."</p>

  <p>"Wish you would, June." Barney's voice was sufficiently bitter. He
  regarded June speculatively for a moment. "Did he do him in?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Holt's dead," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Good," said Barney, with undisguised satisfaction. June smiled in spite
  of her tears. "You have no soul, Barney."</p>

  <p>For the remainder of the day Barney was unable to paint. He passed most of
  the time sitting on his brother's bed.</p>

  <p>Only June Lansing knew where he was. She left him entirely alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; OBVIOUSLY MURDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOMETHING scraping across the floor. Something scraping
  across the floor. Now what in hell did he mean by that?"</p>

  <p>Munson, as he wandered about the room, was entertaining himself with the
  mumblings of his own voice.</p>

  <p>"Scraping, scraping, scraping," he continued under his breath. "What was
  scraping? Didn't sound like a lie. Didn't work in anywhere."</p>

  <p>Once more he returned to his chair and sat down. Why was he so convinced
  that Daniel had not shot Lane Holt? All the facts cried out against him. Less
  than three-quarters of an hour before the man was found shot through the
  head, Daniel had told him he did not deserve to live and had predicted his
  speedy death. "I have a strange feeling that you won't live much
  longer"&mdash; those were the exact words he had used. Now, here was Holt
  dead, obviously murdered.</p>

  <p>Then, there was the gun. Munson cast the revolver a disgusted glance. He
  knew what marks were on that gun&mdash;Daniel's finger-prints. Munson would
  see about that later. But why had he tossed it over there by the window? Damn
  fool thing to do. And the bullet the doctor had extracted from Lane Holt's
  brain had been shot from Daniel's revolver. All the pieces fitted together
  perfectly. And Daniel had been caught with an incriminating statement written
  by the dead man crushed in his hand.</p>

  <p>Judson had put it conservatively when he observed that the case looked
  fairly simple. It was altogether too simple. Either that, or Daniel,
  convinced that any moment he would be charged with the murder of Emily-Jane,
  had decided to make a clean sweep of things.</p>

  <p>Munson got up and walked over to the table. He seated himself where Holt
  had sat, and leveled his eyes on the revolver on the floor twelve feet away,
  near the window directly in front of him. Munson noticed that the window was
  about two inches open from the bottom. This fact did not impress him at the
  moment. He closed his eyes and let the stillness of the room settle round
  him. He was not thinking now. His brain was merely receiving impressions.
  Over there on the bed lay a dead man. And just before he had become such a
  dead man something had happened to his mind. Munson could feel once more the
  crazy eyes of Lane Holt furtively looking at him. Yes, undoubtedly, the man
  had been mentally unbalanced, morally and mentally warped through a conflict
  of fear and hate. Made melancholy, perhaps, from brooding over the death of
  Emily-Jane. What did this mean? How could he work it in, use it to help
  Daniel?</p>

  <p>Munson took Holt's statement from his pocket and smoothed it out on the
  desk. For some minutes he studied the writing. There was something peculiar
  about that writing, a mechanical difference rather than an expression of the
  writer's personality. Well, he'd have to see about that, too. And there was
  that handkerchief on the floor at the left side of the chair. Subconsciously
  Munson was laying the foundation of his investigations. Suspicions,
  impressions and questions were lying fallow in his mind. For the time being
  he had completely dismissed all consideration of the first murder. That would
  have to wait, although the motive for the murder of Lane Holt must have
  sprung from that of Emily-Jane. The two were inseparably linked, results of
  the same situation.</p>

  <p>Leaving the table, he walked over to the bed and drew down the sheet.
  There was Lane Holt, the once jaunty and debonair lover of Emily-Jane. Shot
  in the left temple at close range. Why the left temple? Why not? Well, for
  one thing it was the side nearest the door. Yet because of that very fact it
  was the most awkward side to approach. Daniel would have been forced to
  squeeze himself in between the open door and the table. Much easier to go
  round the other way, much easier and more natural. But Munson was not greatly
  interested in the bullet hole in Lane Holt's head. His eyes were intently
  studying every detail of the man's hands now lying curled and useless on the
  spread. Munson bent over and scrutinized those hands. "An immaculate devil,"
  he thought as his eyes dwelt on the meticulously manicured nails. Then,
  carefully taking the dead man's wrists he raised the hands and inspected each
  finger in turn.</p>

  <p>Gradually, yet with increasing momentum, a grin, a grin of almost beatific
  proportions, broke the severe lines of Scott Munson's lips. Then the grin,
  having achieved its triumphant climax, suddenly collapsed. Munson recovered
  the figure and turned away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell," he reflected, and a look of discouragement settled on his
  face. "What's the good in getting him off one murder charge if only to bring
  another one against him?" Still, the other charge would be more difficult to
  prove than this one. Here everything was all set up. Just waiting for some
  jury to pounce upon. The murder of Emily-Jane was a great deal more
  complicated. There were other persons involved. No, he would have to get
  Daniel out of this scrape no matter what might happen in the future. Very
  easy to say, but how was he going to do it?</p>

  <p>In the kitchen the Shays were hovering over a belated meal. They felt
  somewhat despised and rejected, having been so summarily dismissed from the
  scene of the crime. Their appetites remained unimpaired.</p>

  <p>"And to think," remarked Officer Shad impressively, arresting the upward
  progress of a skilfully laden fork, "just to think that only a few short
  hours ago I was locked in a desperate struggle with him. My ear will bear the
  marks of his teeth to its grave."</p>

  <p>"Well, the back of him just escaped bearing the marks of my bullet to its
  grave," observed Officer Red. "If it hadn't been for Mr. Munson it 'ud have
  gone in plop. I had a dead bead on it."</p>

  <p>"A dangerous case, this," said Officer Shad. "I wonder who goes next?
  Looks to me like a sort of a general killing off."</p>

  <p>"They call it the process of elimination," came sententiously from Red.
  "They go on and on and on, until only one is left, and then he gets all the
  money."</p>

  <p>"Whose money?"</p>

  <p>"All the money there is."</p>

  <p>"In what?"</p>

  <p>"All the money there is in the will." Officer Red was quite convinced
  about this. "There's always a will in cases like these, and that naturally
  leads to elimination."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," agreed Shad.</p>

  <p>"Now, the way I figure this case out, that guy Holt must have been a
  collateral cousin. Get me?" Officer Red fixed his companion with a politely
  skeptical gaze.</p>

  <p>"He certainly was mean," once more agreed Shad. "The way he went after my
  ear."</p>

  <p>"And being a collateral cousin he comes in under the will," continued Red.
  "And that starts all this bumping off business. They're all after the money,
  and"&mdash; he lowered his voice&mdash;"the old lady bears watching. From the
  way she bustles us about and keeps shooing us out of the house you can tell
  she doesn't want us around. No, sir. She's afraid of us. And did you ever
  notice how she keeps peering into things like she was looking for something?
  The will. That's what she's after, mark my words."</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair with a complacent expression on his face,
  which, if anything, was a few shades redder due to the exertion caused by
  eating and talking at the same time.</p>

  <p>"I wonder where that will is?" mused Officer Shad. "It would be a feather
  in our caps if we could find it."</p>

  <p>"Then keep your eye on the old dame," said the master mind of the pair,
  "and look in places whenever they let us in the house."</p>

  <p>"It must be a mighty valuable will," said Officer Shad, "what with two
  killings and one stabbing already."</p>

  <p>Further elucidation of the case was interrupted by the appearance of Dora.
  This superior and comely domestic eyed the pair with a look of disgust that
  bordered almost on loathing.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Munson wants you two," she said. "He's up in the room with the
  corpe."</p>

  <p>"The what?" from Officer Red incredulously. "I said it," snapped the girl.
  "The corpe."</p>

  <p>"No, no, my dear," said the officer gently. "It's not corpe. The word is
  corpse."</p>

  <p>"And," put in Officer Shad admonishingly, "you certainly should get to
  know that word with nothing else but corpses knocking about here."</p>

  <p>"I wish you were knocking about with them," retorted Dora, as the officers
  marched from the room.</p>

  <p>Munson was back in his chair when the Shays answered his summons.</p>

  <p>"The grounds are unguarded, sir," announced Shad. "Well, you can give the
  grounds a rest for a while," said Munson. "No one is trying to get away now.
  I have more important work for you to do."</p>

  <p>Uneasy glances passed between the officers.</p>

  <p>"Yes," continued Munson, "I want you to watch me."</p>

  <p>"You mean," Shad's voice was uncertain, "to see that they don't do you
  in?"</p>

  <p>"Among other things," replied Munson gravely, "but just now I want Shad to
  make a circle round that gun down there. Don't touch it."</p>

  <p>Shad walked down to the gun, then gingerly circled round it, carefully
  placing his long feet the one in front of the other. Munson watched him
  abstractedly. Presently he asked, "Now what, may I ask, do you think you're
  doing, Shad?"</p>

  <p>Shad looked up from his delicate task. "Making a circle around the gun,"
  he replied. "Like you said."</p>

  <p>"Not like I said at all," snapped Munson. "Here, take this piece of chalk
  and draw a circle round the thing."</p>

  <p>"A perfect circle?" asked the officer, "or just rough?"</p>

  <p>Munson looked at the crouching Shad a long time. No one will ever know
  what thoughts were passing through his mind, what violent impulses he was
  controlling. At last he rose wearily and walked down the room. With a piece
  of white chalk he carefully marked the position of the revolver, then
  thrusting a long pencil into its barrel he carried it back to his chair. Shad
  looked at Red with eloquently elevated eyebrows, shrugged his shoulders, then
  stood up and idly watched his chief.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson was humming under his breath. Still humming he raised his
  eyes and looked so pensively upon the Shays that those two worthies began to
  shift about uncomfortably. "Come here, boys," he said pleasantly. "I want you
  to see what I see in case my testimony requires corroboration."</p>

  <p>The officers allowed themselves to draw near. "Do you see the trigger
  guard on this revolver?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"We do," vouchsafed Shad, hoping thereby to reinstate himself in the good
  graces of his chief.</p>

  <p>"And do you see a small piece of thin, strong thread attached to it?"
  Munson could not keep an element of excitement from his voice.</p>

  <p>"We do." This time they spoke in unison.</p>

  <p>"Well," continued Munson, "what do you think it's there for?"</p>

  <p>A heavy silence, at last broken by Officer Shad.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," he said, "there's two revolvers just alike in the house and they
  tied that thread on to one of them so they could tell them apart like they do
  with tooth-brushes."</p>

  <p>"And you, Red. What's your conjecture?"</p>

  <p>"I conject," replied Red brightly, "that the gun was hung on the wall
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Thank you both," said Munson dryly. "You stay here until I return, and
  don't go monkeying round with that body on the bed."</p>

  <p>Both officers hastily disclaimed any intention of so doing. As a matter of
  fact, since entering the room they had sedulously avoided even glancing at
  the sheet-covered body. They would have preferred not to have been left alone
  with it.</p>

  <p>When Munson returned he had established the fact that the butt of the
  revolver bore three clear finger-prints made by Daniel. He had compared them
  with aset already in his possession. He wondered moodily how he was going to
  be able to laugh that off.</p>

  <p>"Now for a look at the corpse," he said briskly. "Come over here,
  boys."</p>

  <p>The boys approached the bed, but it was plain to see that their hearts
  were not in their feet. Munson pulled down the sheet.</p>

  <p>"I want you to pay particular attention to the hands," he said.</p>

  <p>Munson raised the hands so abruptly that the officers started back
  nervously.</p>

  <p>"Did you want us to sniff them?" asked Officer Red.</p>

  <p>"That will hardly be necessary now," replied Munson. "Just look at them.
  You observe that the two fingers next to the thumb on the left hand are
  slightly smeared with ink, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Yes, they observed that.</p>

  <p>"Well, remember it," said Munson. "Now, Shad, go over there by the table
  at the left-hand side of the chair and draw a circle round that handkerchief
  on the floor. Don't cut up any more capers."</p>

  <p>This time Shad did splendidly.</p>

  <p>"Now come with me," said Munson. Followed by his staff, he left the room
  and locked the door. He hurried downstairs to the library and called up
  Manning on the telephone. Dr. Manning was on the point of leaving for the
  club, an attractive feminine voice informed Munson. She would get him. She
  did.</p>

  <p>"Now, what is it?" came Manning's voice.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard our latest joke?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, Munson," the speaker at the other end of the line replied.
  "Thought I recognized your voice. No, I haven't heard a damn thing. Just got
  up. A swell night. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Lane Holt was shot to death in his room at about one o'clock today.
  Daniel has been detained at the village lockup pending the inquest. It will
  be held at four tomorrow afternoon." Munson spoke tersely.</p>

  <p>A series of "Good Gods" dropped heedlessly by the horrified doctor had
  accompanied Munson's information. Now that Munson had ceased speaking,
  Manning had the field to himself. He proceeded to take advantage of it.
  Finally he drew breath and asked, "But did he really do it, Scott?"</p>

  <p>"They have an absolutely water-tight case against him unless I can break
  it between now and the inquest. You've got to help me."</p>

  <p>"Anything. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Did you ever play golf with Lane Holt?"</p>

  <p>Manning's answer to that and several following questions ended with :
  "I'll be on the dot tomorrow to testify to that effect. Any reporters
  yet?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks for reminding me," replied Scott. "I have just the boys for them.
  Good-by, Manning." He snapped the instrument down and favored his staff with
  a broad grin. "I've a wonderful assignment for you," he said.</p>

  <p>Suspicion sullied the eyes of the officers.</p>

  <p>"Yes," continued Munson. "A wonderful assignment. You go out there on the
  lawn and keep your eyes open for newspaper men. Don't let them near the
  house. They don't wear badges on their sleeves or cards in their hat bands.
  They look very much like anyone else when they're sober, but they don't know
  the meaning of truth the way you and I understand it, and they'll lie you
  into a cocked hat if you give them a chance. They'll even go so far as to
  adopt disguises just to get themselves into the place. Now, I rely on you
  boys to stop all that. We've had trouble enough already. The women are in on
  this, too. Go out and protect them."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we know how to handle those birds," began Officer Red. "I remember
  once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"March!" interrupted Munson, and the boys left the room.</p>

  <p>Munson went to the window. He had caught a glimpse of June Lansing on the
  veranda. There she was, all sprawled out in a chair, the whole rangy body of
  her. And she was looking comfortably miserable. Munson was aware of June's
  penchant for lolling away the hours doing nothing or as little as possible
  and enjoying herself hugely. Now, however, she did not look as if she were
  greatly enjoying her slothful repose.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were open, those funny eyes of hers, but they did not see, or
  were not conscious of seeing. All receptivity to life and the movements of
  life seemed to have passed from them. Blankly and flatly they gazed at
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Munson stepped through the French window and quietly approached her.
  "June," he asked, "do you happen to know where Daniel kept his revolver?"</p>

  <p>June did not stir. She was beyond being startled. "I haven't the slightest
  idea, Scott?" she replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"June," said Munson. "Look at me."</p>

  <p>The girl raised her eyes to his.</p>

  <p>"I'm working for Daniel in this."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that, Scott?"</p>

  <p>"I'm the only one left to do it, and I'm going to get him off. He'll be a
  free man tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Scott, are you sure?" She was not much at giving a public
  demonstration of her feeling, but in this instance she was unable to keep the
  depth of her anxiety from showing itself in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Unless my mind has gone all bad," replied Scott, "I'm fairly sure I'll be
  able to throw a large-sized monkey-wrench into the works."</p>

  <p>"But things look pretty bad for him, don't they?"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't look worse," was Munson's frank reply. "That's what gives me
  hope. There's such a thing as looking too damn guilty."</p>

  <p>"He always keeps his revolver in the right-hand top drawer of the library
  desk," said June. "It was there only yesterday. I saw him handling the ugly
  thing and I made him put it away. Daniel is in no frame of mind to be
  handling dangerous weapons."</p>

  <p>"Did anyone else see him handling that revolver?" Munson asked
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"No," replied June. "That is, no one paid any special attention to him.
  Lane Holt passed the door on his way upstairs. He just glanced in and kept on
  going."</p>

  <p>"You'd swear to that?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly. Why not? It's a fact."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, June," said Munson cheerfully. "You've done me a world of good.
  Also Daniel."</p>

  <p>He returned to the desk in the library and sat down at it. For a long time
  he surveyed the smooth dark surface before him. There were the leather-tipped
  blotter, the scissors, and the paper-knife. Several books stood at one end,
  at the other a roll of blue-prints. Daniel was forever planning the building
  of something or other and not doing it. And there were the pens. Yes, there
  were the pens&mdash;three of them straying at random across the desk. Those
  pens. Munson became very still as he looked at them. There was something
  wrong about those pens. What was it? They looked lost and out of place. He
  never recalled having seen them that way before, or had he? Damned if he was
  sure. He reached out a hand and delicately felt the surface of the desk
  beyond the edge of the blotting paper. Something heavy had rested there once.
  There were faint scratches. He could feel them and he could see them. He
  closed his eyes and thought about the desk to the exclusion of everything
  else. There should be an inkstand. There always had been an inkstand, one
  with a place for the pens. Funny thing&mdash;with his eyes closed he could
  see it perfectly. There it was. A long flat slab of bronze pierced by two
  wells. And the base of the stand was grooved to accommodate three pens, to be
  specific, the three pens now lying in disorder on the desk.</p>

  <p>Munson rose quickly and left the room. Betty was in the kitchen drinking
  tea, but at his request she willingly put down her cup and followed him to
  the library.</p>

  <p>"Betty," he said, "you take care of this room. I see you messing about
  here every day."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Betty. "Not exactly messing, Mr. Munson."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Far from it." Munson laughed with agreeable hypocrisy.
  "Just my way of putting it. Now where's the inkstand, Betty?"</p>

  <p>Betty looked at the desk in surprise, then her expression changed to one
  of indignation. She eyed the desk accusingly.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's gone, Mr. Munson," she said. "It isn't there. And it was there
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"You know that?"</p>

  <p>"I know it, sir."</p>

  <p>Munson remained silent, then he turned and paced the length of the room
  and back. If Lane Holt had taken Daniel's revolver he might have also taken
  the inkstand, but there was no proof that he had taken either. And what did
  he want with the inkstand? There was a bottle of ink in his room. Munson
  stopped in front of Betty.</p>

  <p>"Where were you around one o'clock today?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>"Standing out there in the hall," replied Betty, pointing to a spot just
  outside the wide door.</p>

  <p>"See anything of Lane Holt?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly did, sir. From the time I told what Tom and me had seen down
  at the Rock before him in Mr. Dan's study I kept looking out for that man.
  His eyes had scared me proper. So when I saw him coming out of this room, I
  just eased myself out of his way."</p>

  <p>"Where did he go after he left this room?"</p>

  <p>"He went right on upstairs."</p>

  <p>"Was he carrying anything, Betty? Think hard."</p>

  <p>"No, sir. He had his handkerchief in his hand." "Was it a large
  handkerchief, did you happen to notice?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, now that you come to mention it, I remember how it hung
  down."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he could have been using it to cover something he was
  carrying?"</p>

  <p>Betty gave a quick cry of triumph. "That's it, Mr. Munson," she said. "I
  should have known it right off."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because his arm hung flat to his side like it was glued there."</p>

  <p>Munson's smile of gratification was swiftly changed to one of
  consternation at the sudden sound of revolvers being discharged at top
  speed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, mother!" cried Betty, flinging her arms round Munson. "We'll all be
  murdered now."</p>

  <p>Munson disentangled himself from the throttling embrace of the girl and
  rushed out to the veranda just in time to see a black-clad figure
  disappearing down the road at great bounds. Its arms were waving wildly in
  the air. In the general direction of this industrious figure, Officers Shad
  and Red were merrily discharging their revolvers. Munson lost no time in
  reaching the scene of action.</p>

  <p>"Now please tell me," he said in a tired voice, "just what in God's name
  is the meaning of this maddened fusillade?"</p>

  <p>"A reporter," said Red briefly, eying his smoking weapon with
  approval.</p>

  <p>"Did he say he was a reporter?"</p>

  <p>"He did not," put in Shad with a sardonic laugh. "That's the funny part
  about it. He said he was a preacher. And damned if he wasn't disguised like
  one. White collar and all. Kept insisting on seeing Aunt Matty. Said that
  with all the sorrow that's visited the house he thought he'd drop over and
  have a little talk with her. But he didn't fool us. Not for a minute."</p>

  <p>At this point Officer Red laughed cynically. "No," he said, "he didn't get
  away with it. We told him to beat it, and then we pulled our guns and banged
  away."</p>

  <p>"Did you swear at him, perhaps?" Munson's voice was almost timid as he put
  the question.</p>

  <p>"Did we swear?" repeated Shad, and rolled his eyes at his brother-in-arms.
  "Did we swear? Mr. Munson, you should have heard us. We used every bad word
  we could think of. He'll never come back here any more."</p>

  <p>Munson's hand sought his forehead. "Oh," he said, and, "Oh!"</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" asked Officer Red solicitously.</p>

  <p>"No, certainly not," replied Munson. "Everything's splendid&mdash;dandy."
  He let his eyes rest on his staff. "Did this man happen to mention any name?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Red promptly. "He called himself the Reverend Williams.
  Horace Williams in full."</p>

  <p>Horace seemed to strike some responsive chord in both of the officers, for
  at the very mention of the name they started in laughing, and continued for
  some time with ever-increasing volume.</p>

  <p>The Rev. Mr. Horace Williams. That was the name of the particular man of
  God Aunt Matty had been hoping would call. Munson remembered it distinctly.
  She had been expecting him to tell her just what the world was coming to, and
  now, no doubt, the Rev. Mr. Williams was wondering about that himself.</p>

  <p>"Did we do all right, Mr. Munson?" asked Officer Shad, wiping the tears
  and sweat from his long, lugubrious face.</p>

  <p>"Quite all right," said Munson weakly, "but don't mention the fact up at
  the house that you scared the Rev. Mr. Horace Williams out of ten years'
  growth. It might get to Aunt Matty's ears."</p>

  <p>"Then it was a real preacher?" asked Red, his eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"I'm very much afraid it was," Munson smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"Gord," breathed Officer Shad. "And all those words we used."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; HOW ONE LIFE WENT OUT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MUNSON explained everything, but already everyone's nerves
  were so finely edged that his words did little to dispel the tension gripping
  the various members of the household.</p>

  <p>Aunt Matty retired flutteringly to her room. Sam, Sue, and June sat in a
  silent group at the far end of the veranda. Without Daniel they seemed to be
  lost. They missed his cynical voice and his rather grim banter. All of them
  were thinking of him sitting alone and worried in the hot, unclean village
  lockup.</p>

  <p>"How's he going to sleep tonight?" asked June of no one in particular.
  "He's much too long."</p>

  <p>"Probably won't sleep at all," replied Sam. "He'll have lots of things to
  think about."</p>

  <p>"Too many things," said June.</p>

  <p>"We all have," said Sam. "Wish I could stop."</p>

  <p>"I've stopped," announced Sue. "I can't think any more even when I want
  to. My brain has crumbled."</p>

  <p>"He must have done it, June," Sam's voice was low, "but damn if I can see
  why."</p>

  <p>"There were plenty of good reasons for killing Lane Holt," answered June
  in a dead voice. "I could have done it myself."</p>

  <p>Sam nodded his head slowly, then his eyes met those of June for one swift
  glance. The girl's gaze dropped to the large solitaire sparkling on her
  engagement finger. Daniel's last gift. She wondered if it would ever mean
  anything now. "I felt like that myself," said Sam, "but I'm always too late
  it seems."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Sue.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing much," he answered. "Only, if Lane Holt had to be killed I'd
  rather have done it than Dan."</p>

  <p>"Do you enjoy murdering people?" asked his wife, slightly raising her
  eyebrows. "Must you go sticking your great nose into every murder? And are
  you anxious to make a widow out of your own wife, or would you prefer to see
  me dead at your feet, the victim of your own hand?"</p>

  <p>This was a long speech for Sue, and not a very pleasant one under the
  circumstances. Sam smiled conciliatingly upon her.</p>

  <p>"No, Sue," he said, "but I can't bear the thought of Dan sitting alone
  down there tonight. He's done a lot for me&mdash;gone through hell and
  all."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there any hope?" asked Sue. "What do you think, June?"</p>

  <p>"There's some hope, Sue."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Scott Munson. He's for Dan in this."</p>

  <p>"If he is," put in Sam, "it's because he has other plans for Dan. That
  guy's going to hang us all, and he doesn't need Lane Holt to help him do it,
  either."</p>

  <p>"If you keep on being so cheerful and optimistic, Sam," said his wife,
  "I'm going to start in screaming and pulling my hair out by the roots."</p>

  <p>"Even that would be a relief," remarked June.</p>

  <p>They sat in silence as the shadows of the trees lengthened and dusk came
  quietly over the water and gathered round them. The old house was silent now,
  and in his room Lane Holt was silent, too. But there was no peace. The horror
  of murder and the fear of death and separation hung on the air. It would soon
  be night now&mdash;black night for Daniel.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Scott Munson was still thinking about
scraping&mdash;something scraping
  across the floor. But that was only one of his perplexities. He was also
  thinking of ink-stands, threads tied to revolvers, ink-stained fingers,
  dropped handkerchiefs, and left-handed golf players. They were all a part of
  the same thought. And occasionally across these thoughts bounded the
  disconcertingly active figure of the Rev. Mr. Horace Williams earnestly
  retreating down the road. An unfortunate occurrence.</p>

  <p>One after another Munson eliminated the various units composing the
  structure of his thought, until only the bronze inkstand remained, that and
  the sound of scraping. Suddenly he sat forward in his chair as if listening,
  then gradually his body relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what an abysmal, rank, noisome novice I have turned out to be," he
  told himself. "It has to be there. By all the laws of man and God it can't be
  anywhere else. And I should have known it. It was my job to know."</p>

  <p>He rose from his chair and casually collected his staff. The Shays were
  only too willing to be collected. They had grown weary of looking out for
  reporters, and were ready to do something else now&mdash;any old thing. The
  Shays were fond of change. Routine palled on their vibrant, sensitive
  natures.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," said Munson.</p>

  <p>"What's up, chief?" asked Officer Red.</p>

  <p>"We're going to look for an inkstand," he answered.</p>

  <p>The staff exchanged significant glances. What a silly occupation for three
  full-grown men. This Munson was mad indeed.</p>

  <p>Munson led them across the lawn and round the house until they stood
  directly beneath the side window of the room in which Lane Holt lay dead.
  Here there was a brick-faced shaft running down against the side of the house
  about five feet below the surface of the lawn. A boarded-up window was set
  into the shaft. It opened up into the cellar and was obviously used at one
  time for purposes of ventilation, but as that section of the cellar was now
  no longer used neither shaft nor window had any particular reason for
  existing.</p>

  <p>In the rapidly fading light Munson peered down into the shaft and saw that
  it was half filled with several seasons' accumulation of dead leaves, a
  direct reflection on the executive ability of Griggs and the enterprise of
  Tom, his invaluable assistant.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't have been better suited to his purpose if he had dug the hole
  himself," soliloquized Munson, as he inspected the shaft. "How dumb I've
  been! It's a plain case of galloping senility."</p>

  <p>His inspection finished, he turned to the Shays and considered their
  unlovely figures.</p>

  <p>"I imagine you're better designed for shaft work, Shad," he said. "Red
  would fill it up and wouldn't be able to bend. So just get down in there and
  don't come out until you bring an inkstand with you."</p>

  <p>"It's a nasty-looking place," observed the officer fastidiously. "Might be
  more than inkstands down there."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Munson, "if you find a body or anything else interesting
  bring it along, too. In you go, my man."</p>

  <p>And in went Shad, his hearty disapproval of the entire procedure
  eloquently marked on his face.</p>

  <p>"Now grope around in that rubbish and produce an inkstand," commanded
  Munson.</p>

  <p>"With my bare hands?" asked Shad in a tone of incredulity.</p>

  <p>"I don't care if you grope with your teeth, so longas I get my inkstand,"
  replied Munson. "Make it snappy."</p>

  <p>"Well, of all the things," murmured Shad, as he shrinkingly bent to his
  task.</p>

  <p>His groping was soon over. Virtually the first object his hand encountered
  was the heavy bronze inkstand, partially covered with leaves.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," he exclaimed with infinite relief, as he passed the stand up
  to Munson, who received it with a glow of triumph.</p>

  <p>Round the bronze slab was tied a long piece of string on the free end of
  which was attached a strand of strong, thin thread.</p>

  <p>"That pretty well settles it," said Munson, winding the string round the
  inkstand. "Our day's work is done. You two had better go back to the kitchen
  and rustle up some grub."</p>

  <p>This suggestion, the officers later agreed, was the only reasonable one
  they had ever heard Munson make. As they were about to follow it, Red
  stopped, unable to restrain his curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Might I ask what you wanted with that old chunk of metal, Mr. Munson?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much," replied Munson carelessly. "Just to keep an innocent man
  from being charged with murder and eventually going to the chair."</p>

  <p>With a half-frightened look at the object now safely tucked in the crook
  of Munson's arm, the officers tip-toed through the darkness on the most
  cheerful mission of a long and trying day.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The inquest into the death of Lane Holt occasioned a wider
show of
  interest than had the one caused by the shocking departure of Emily-Jane. And
  this hardly seemed fair. Certainly Emily-Jane would have held it against Holt
  had she been in a position to do so. However, it was not altogether Holt's
  fault. He had not planned the inquest. The knowledge that Daniel Crewe was
  being detained pending the verdict of the jury had spread rapidly. The local
  inhabitants refused to consider the possibility of his guilt, and they
  attended the inquest for the sole purpose of showing that fact no matter what
  nonsense the coroner's jury might be led to believe.</p>

  <p>When Daniel appeared in the company of Dr. Manning, a low murmur of voices
  ran through the long library. Heads were thrust in at the French windows and
  sympathetic eyes followed the progress. Without any effort on his part Daniel
  had made himself a popular figure in the community. The loyalty of the two
  brothers and their life together at the old Crewe home had long been a
  subject of interest in many homes. The two of them were much a part of the
  place, very closely associated with the life of the countryside.</p>

  <p>Tall and haggard, Daniel sat between June and Manning. He had not slept
  and his eyes were sunken, but they looked on Coroner Judson with interested
  composure, in which there was no suggestion of the anxiety he felt. He had
  thought the long night through and still was unable to see how he was going
  to clear himself of the murder of Lane Holt. There was not a scrap of
  evidence in his favor. Fate had stacked the cards skilfully against him. For
  some odd reason his position reminded him of "The Case of Sergeant Grischa."
  It was so hopeless and at the same time so useless&mdash;so tragically
  inane.</p>

  <p>At the back of the room Barney at the last moment slid into a seat and
  found himself dangerously withinthe influence of the large eyes of one small
  Sally Brent. Today, however, she contented herself with regarding the
  crumpled, untidy figure furtively. After the exchange of quick, shy smiles,
  both pretended the other had gone away. They were not successful at this.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson had placed himself strategically the better to be able to
  confer with Coroner Judson, whose methods of procedure were inclined to be
  informal and rather absent-minded.</p>

  <p>After Dr. Wood had finished giving his professional testimony,
  establishing the fact that Lane Holt had died as the result of a bullet from
  a revolver fired at close range, Judson asked : "Would it have been possible,
  Dr. Wood, for the deceased to have done it himself?"</p>

  <p>"Easily possible," replied the doctor, "but for two exceptions : the
  bullet entered the left temple and the revolver was found lying at least
  twelve feet from the body. Inasmuch as the deceased died instantly he could
  hardly have so disposed of the gun. Furthermore, a right-handed man would not
  have shot himself in the left temple."</p>

  <p>Dr. Wood stepped down and was followed by Sergeant Bennett whose story of
  the shooting was brief but devastating to Daniel. A little after one o'clock
  in the afternoon while at luncheon he had heard the shot. He had reached the
  scene so quickly that Daniel Crewe had been unable to escape from the room.
  This had obviously been his intention, for he, Bennett, had stopped him at
  the door. Bennett had found in Daniel's hand an accusing statement written by
  the dead man. The statement had not been finished.</p>

  <p>"Is this the statement, sergeant?" asked the coroner, extending the
  crumpled sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"It is, sir."</p>

  <p>The statement was then read to the jury, and at its conclusion a look of
  sorrow and consternation settled on many faces in the room. The case was now
  wide open. Scott Munson was evidently ready for a show-down. Daniel felt the
  walls growing higher and higher around him and above him. Soon he would be
  completely shut off and bricked in, yet he gave no indication of the
  hopelessness he was feeling.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Bennett," asked the coroner, "did you ever hear Daniel Crewe say
  anything that would lead you to believe he had designs on the life of the
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>Only for a moment did Bennett hesitate, then he answered clearly : "I did,
  sir. Within an hour of Holt's death and in the presence of one other witness
  Daniel Crewe told Holt that he didn't deserve to live and that he doubted if
  he would live very much longer."</p>

  <p>A feeling of even greater discouragement ran through the room.</p>

  <p>"Are you convinced, Bennett, that no one else could have been with the
  deceased at the time of his death?' came the voice of the coroner.</p>

  <p>"We were all at luncheon together," replied Bennett. "The servants have
  been accounted for."</p>

  <p>"And you are equally certain the deceased could not have taken his own
  life?" continued Judson.</p>

  <p>"I see no way he could have done it, sir." Bennett spoke with quiet
  conviction.</p>

  <p>"And you say Daniel Crewe admitted ownership of the revolver from which
  the bullet was fired?"</p>

  <p>Many of the spectators felt like shouting or running away, so logically,
  so inevitably, was the coroner leading up to the only conclusion that could
  be drawn. Manning gripped Daniel's right arm. "Hold hard, old sport," he
  whispered. "They don't know the half of it yet." Daniel grinned
  appreciatively. June Lansing waswhite and rigid. Her eyes dwelt pleadingly on
  Scott Munson, who appeared to be entirely unmoved by Bennett's evidence.</p>

  <p>"He did," said Bennett. "Mr. Crewe admitted ownership of the revolver from
  which the bullet was fired."</p>

  <p>"That will be about all, Sergeant Bennett," said the coroner, looking a
  trifle discouraged himself. "Now I'd like to have Betty Harrison come
  forward."</p>

  <p>Betty faced the coroner and his gentlemen of the jury without the flicker
  of an eye. She was there to do her best. She was determined to do her best.
  Nothing could induce her to change the mind she had already so completely
  made up. Betty was going to lie like the very devil, and she did not much
  care who knew it. She was going to lie and keep on lying. To her it seemed
  the only honest thing left to do. Guilty or not guilty, Mr. Daniel was right
  whatever he did &mdash; right in the eyes of God as well as her own, which to
  Betty's way of thinking, was equally if not more important.</p>

  <p>Mr. Judson considered his notes for a moment. It was his duty to make the
  motive for the murder clear to the jury. This, thought Judson regretfully,
  was only too easy to do.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Betty," he said. "I want Sergeant Bennett back here for one
  more question." Betty was given a near-by seat. Bennett took the chair by the
  coroner's table.</p>

  <p>"Bennett," asked the coroner, "did you hear the deceased accuse Daniel
  Crewe of the murder of Miss Seabrook?"</p>

  <p>"I did," replied Bennett. "Holt accused Mr. Crewe of the murder of Miss
  Seabrook. There were three witnesses present. You have the names, Mr.
  Judson."</p>

  <p>"All right, Bennett," said the coroner. "Come on back, Betty." When the
  girl was seated he continued, "Did you hear the deceased accuse Mr. Daniel of
  the murder?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not the one to put words into a dead man's mouth," answered Betty
  virtuously.</p>

  <p>"But Sergeant Bennett was present at the same time, Betty, and he says he
  heard the accusation," the coroner observed mildly.</p>

  <p>"Then let him put words into a dead man's mouth," conceded Betty. "I
  won't."</p>

  <p>It was a relief to laugh a little. The spectators took advantage of the
  opportunity. Mr. Judson looked perturbed.</p>

  <p>"How far were you sitting from the deceased, Betty?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"As far as I could," came Betty's prompt response, "but not far enough to
  miss a single word he said."</p>

  <p>"Then you didn't hear him accuse Mr. Daniel of murder?" persisted the
  coroner.</p>

  <p>"I did not," replied Betty, and settled herself in her chair as if she
  were prepared to fight it out on that line until the Day of Doom.</p>

  <p>Mr. Judson shrugged his shoulders and with baffled eyes looked out over
  the room. "She says she didn't hear him," he remarked to no one in
  particular. "Didn't hear him."</p>

  <p>"He couldn't have said it," cut in Betty, "because I saw him commit the
  murder with my own two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will do, Betty," Mr. Judson almost shouted. "You go right away now.
  Thomas Shanks."</p>

  <p>As Thomas Shanks passed the indomitable girl, she deliberately stopped and
  transfixed him with her eyes. The boy nodded violently and lumbered to the
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Tom," began the coroner in a kindly voice, "did you hear the deceased
  accuse Mr. Daniel of murder?"</p>

  <p>"N-n-no," chattered Tom, then after reorganizing himself, continued, "N-n-
  no."</p>

  <p>"Are you stammering now, Tom?" asked Judson, "or just trying to be
  emphatic?"</p>

  <p>"I-I-I&mdash;" Tom was embarking on the choppy seas of speech when the
  coroner interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Let's do it this way, Tom," he suggested. "You just nod up and down for
  yes"&mdash; here Judson demonstrated and Tom's head solemnly followed his
  example&mdash;"and sidewise for no." Again the dumb show was repeated.
  "Good," said the coroner. "Now. Did you hear the deceased&mdash;you know what
  the deceased means, Tom?" Tom shook his head. Judson reached in his pocket
  and produced a large handkerchief. He, too, seemed to be going through the
  process of reorganization. "Well, in this case, Tom," he explained with
  admirable gentleness, "it means Lane Holt. Did you hear him accuse Mr. Daniel
  of murder? Up and down, yes, Tom. Side-wise, no. Remember."</p>

  <p>Betty had half risen from her chair. She was glaring at Tom and
  industriously shaking her pretty head. As if responding to some dynamic cheer
  leader Tom followed her example. With a satisfied smile she sank back in her
  chair, and the coroner instructed Tom to step down as speedily as
  possible.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Daniel Crewe," called Judson, and the room became hushed as Daniel
  took the chair.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Crewe," said the coroner with a marked display of deference,
  "would you mind giving us your version of the death of Mr. Lane Holt?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," replied Daniel, smiling at the coroner, and when he had
  finished his story even his best friends found it difficult to place any
  great faith in it. Yet Daniel had apparently spoken with the utmost candor
  and had attempted neither to evade nor to stress any particular point. The
  jury looked unimpressed, and Mr. Judson gave the impression of an exceedingly
  dismayed man performing an unpleasant duty.</p>

  <p>"Then you admit," he said, when Daniel had finished, "that you
  appropriated the statement which the deceased was writing at the time he met
  his death and which specifically accused you of the murder of Miss
  Seabrook?"</p>

  <p>"There's no good in denying it," replied Daniel, with engaging frankness.
  "It was both an unwise and unethical thing to do, but in the confusion of the
  moment my brain acted instinctively. The self-protection idea, you know. I
  was convinced that Lane Holt was not responsible for his actions at the time
  of his death, and I saw no reason for his written ravings to get into the
  hands of those who might attach undue importance to them. Frankly, I hardly
  realized the paper was in my hand, when Sergeant Bennett stopped me at the
  door."</p>

  <p>Daniel left the witness chair much worse off than when he had seated
  himself in it. There seemed to be no hope left. It was obvious to all now
  that the jury had no choice in the matter. It would have to return a verdict
  of murder, naming Daniel Crewe. In the back of the room little Sally Brent
  was weeping silently into her scarf. She had no handkerchief. She never had.
  Barney was looking at her uneasily and wishing she would go away. There was a
  pause in the proceedings while Scott Munson conferred with the coroner.
  Presently Judson turned to the jury.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I want you to give your undivided attention to some
  evidence about to be presented by the next few witnesses. Mr. Munson will
  please take the chair."</p>

  <p>"At the moment," Munson told the jury, "I want to stress only two points
  and the first one is: the pen with which the deceased was writing was found
  in his right hand, yet there were ink smears on the two fingers nearest the
  thumb on his left hand. The second point is that the deceased died as a
  result of a bullet entering his left temple."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Munson," inquired the coroner, "whose finger-prints did you find on
  the revolver that killed Lane Holt?"</p>

  <p>"Those of Daniel Crewe," said Munson calmly. "Dr. Manning, please."</p>

  <p>Munson relinquished his seat to Manning, who included the entire room in
  his benign smile. He was attired as meticulously as if he were going to some
  delicate and difficult tryst at which a successful seduction might turn on
  the set of the shoulders of his coat or the stripe in his silk shirt. Even
  the bud in his lapel had been thoughtfully selected.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Manning," asked the coroner, "did you ever play golf with the
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>"I did, sir," answered Manning. "He told me the first time I played with
  him that he was left-handed."</p>

  <p>"And did you ever play bridge with the deceased?" continued the
  coroner.</p>

  <p>"I did, sir. He held his cards with his right hand and played them with
  the left, which is just the reverse of the manner in which right-handed
  people play."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see the deceased write?" asked the coroner.</p>

  <p>"On several occasions, sir," replied Manning, "and on each occasion he
  wrote with his left hand. He was signing his name to chits at the club."</p>

  <p>"Then, in your opinion, the deceased was left-handed?" inquired the
  coroner.</p>

  <p>"Beyond any question of doubt," said Manning. "Thank you, Dr.
  Manning."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

  <p>"Miss June Lansing, please."</p>

  <p>When June had calmly seated herself, Judson turned to her and asked, "Miss
  Lansing, when was the last time you saw the revolver that killed the
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," replied June. "Mr. Daniel Crewe had it in his hand. He was
  examining it in the library and I asked him to put it away."</p>

  <p>"Did he do so?"</p>

  <p>"He put it in the upper right-hand drawer of his desk in the library."</p>

  <p>"Did anyone else witness him do so?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Holt was passing the door at the time. I remember he looked in."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Miss Lansing. Miss Betty Harrison, please."</p>

  <p>Betty, formulating a lot of new lies to be used if and when necessary,
  took the chair.</p>

  <p>"Betty," asked the coroner, "when did you notice the disappearance of an
  object from Mr. Crewe's desk?"</p>

  <p>This seemed fair enough to Betty, so she answered truthfully. "Yesterday
  afternoon," she replied. "Might have been about three. Mr. Munson called my
  attention to it."</p>

  <p>"Was the object on the desk in the morning previous to the death of Mr.
  Lane Holt?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I saw it there myself."</p>

  <p>"And is this the object, Betty?" The coroner tapped the bronze inkstand
  with his pencil.</p>

  <p>"It is, sir, but it didn't have that string around it then."</p>

  <p>"Betty, do you recall when you last saw the deceased alive?"</p>

  <p>"It was just before luncheon yesterday, Mr. Judson. He was coming out of
  the library and he went upstairs."</p>

  <p>"Did he have anything in his hand?"</p>

  <p>"His handkerchief, sir."</p>

  <p>"Did he give you the impression of concealing some heavy object beneath
  the handkerchief?"</p>

  <p>"He did, sir."</p>

  <p>"What gave you that impression?"</p>

  <p>"The way his arm hung by his side. It didn't move natural-like. Looked
  weighted down."</p>

  <p>"Sure about all this, Betty?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure," said Betty, and the coroner excused her with a feeling of no
  little relief. "Officer Shay." he called.</p>

  <p>Two figures proceeded majestically down the room.</p>

  <p>They took their time about it, to enable everyone to have a good
  opportunity to gaze upon them. When they brought up against the coroner's
  table the taller of the two figures uttered one pithy word, "Which?"</p>

  <p>"Which what?" asked Mr. Judson, looking up from his notes.</p>

  <p>"Which one?" explained Shad.</p>

  <p>Munson leaned over the table and spoke in a low tone to the bewildered
  official. "The one known as Shad," he said.</p>

  <p>"But I know all about it, too," protested Red. "Don't you want me?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"Not at all?"</p>

  <p>"No. Never."</p>

  <p>Officer Red, heavy with disappointment, turned away from the table, while
  the lucky Shad seated himself in the coveted chair and crossed his long legs.
  He gave the appearance of a man both ready and willing to discuss at length
  any topic the coroner might care to bring up.</p>

  <p>"Officer Shad&mdash;I mean, Officer Shay," asked Jud son, "when did you
  find this object?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a funny thing, Mr. Judson," began Officer Shad in a slow,
  reminiscent manner. "It's a funny thing about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It isn't a funny thing," snapped the coroner. "It's an extremely serious
  thing. Answer my question."</p>

  <p>Shad looked terribly hurt. "About dusk, sir," he answered. "It was
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Where did you find it?"</p>

  <p>"In a shaft, sir, directly beneath the deceased's window."</p>

  <p>"The window facing his table?" asked the coroner. "The same, sir."</p>

  <p>"Was this string attached to it then?"</p>

  <p>"It was, sir."</p>

  <p>"And the revolver, Shay," continued Judson, "was this strand of thread
  wound round its trigger guard when you first saw it?"</p>

  <p>"It was, sir."</p>

  <p>"That's all, Shay. Thank you."</p>

  <p>It wasn't much, thought Shad, but at least it was better than nothing.
  Munson returned to the chair.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Munson," said the coroner, "explain it your way."</p>

  <p>Munson turned to the jury. "It has been proved," he said, "that the
  deceased was left-handed in spite of the fact that the pen was found in his
  right hand. It has been shown that he had a knowledge of the whereabouts of
  Daniel Crewe's revolver. It is known that just before his death he was seen
  leaving the library carrying his handkerchief in his hand. Betty Harrison has
  testified that she gained the impression he was concealing some heavy object
  under the hand-kerchief. This heavy inkstand that vanished from the library
  was later found in a shaft directly below the window facing the desk in Lane
  Holt's room. This long string was attached to the inkstand. At its free end
  there is a strand of thin but strong thread. The same kind of thread is wound
  round the trigger guard of the revolver. On the floor at the left-hand side
  of the chair in which the deceased was sitting at the time of his death his
  handkerchief was found. The fingers usually employed in writing by the
  deceased were smeared slightly with ink&mdash;but they were on his left hand.
  These statements are all facts. Oh, yes" &mdash; Munson paused and thought
  for a moment, then continued &mdash; "The window facing the table in the room
  occupied by the deceased was about two inches open from the bottom at the
  time of his death. Now, gentle-men, with these facts clearly in mind I will
  show you exactly how Lane Holt met his death if you will accompany me to the
  room he occupied."</p>

  <p>When the jury and several members of the press were assembled in the dead
  man's room, Munson sat down at the table and with a new strand of thread
  joined the free end of the string to the trigger guard of the revolver.
  Making sure that the other end of the string was securely attached to the
  inkstand, he raised the window and carefully lowered the stand over the shaft
  directly below. He then pulled the window down within two inches of the sash.
  pulled the string made taut by the weight of the inkstand, he returned to the
  table and placed his handkerchief round the butt of the now unloaded
  revolver. He sat down at the table and, after a little manipulation with the
  handkerchief, placed the revolver against his left temple.</p>

  <p>"Remember," he remarked, "Lane Holt was left-handed, which I am not. He
  did this much better, much easier."</p>

  <p>Then he picked up the pen in his right hand, pulled the trigger of the
  revolver and relaxed his grip. The handkerchief fluttered to the floor, and
  the revolver, pulled by the weight of the heavy inkstand, went scraping
  across the matting until it reached the window, where the thread snapped,
  allowing the gun to fall back to the floor.</p>

  <p>"A nutty idea, wasn't it?" Munson's voice broke the silence that followed
  this simple but convincing demonstration of how Lane Holt had died. "Well,
  over there on the bed lies all that is left of the crazy brain that figured
  it all out &mdash; but," Munson added, "he didn't quite get away with it, his
  last dirty trick."</p>

  <p>With an odd smile he rose and went to the door. "I wonder," he said,
  pausing, "who first told us not to speak ill of the dead?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; MUNSON SITS ALONE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">GOOD-BY, Barney." Sally Brent extended a timid hand. "Silly,
  isn't it? We haven't even said hello ... and now it's good-by."</p>

  <p>The inquest was over, and people were flocking around them on the veranda.
  Barney was completely dazed. He was experiencing a high state of uselessness.
  He had to do something about this girl's hand, but instead of doing anything
  he contented himself by peering at the small, outstretched palm as if it were
  some novel specimen of fish.</p>

  <p>"It's a hand, Barney," said Sally solemnly. "You're supposed to shake
  it."</p>

  <p>Barney knew all about shaking hands, but it struck him as being rather
  foolish to be shaking Sally's. Sally was always around somewhere if he wanted
  her. Nevertheless, he permitted himself to be inveigled into accepting the
  proffered fingers.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad about Daniel," Sally went on, hoping she might at last hear the
  sound of Barney's voice.</p>

  <p>Barney stiffened. His expression, the girl thought, had suddenly grown a
  little bitter. "There are too many people," he complained. "I don't like all
  these people. How's your motorboat?"</p>

  <p>One might have thought he was inquiring about an ailing aunt or mother.
  However, Sally's motorboat deserved a certain amount of respectful
  solicitude. It was one of the fastest on the Sound, and with little Sally at
  the wheel one of the maddest.</p>

  <p>"Swell," replied Sally. "Come over and take a ride with me soon."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Barney vaguely. "One of these days."</p>

  <p>"Well, good-by, then, Barney." Sally's eyes were at their brightest.</p>

  <p>"So long, Sally."</p>

  <p>The small creature turned away. Well, that was a start, at any rate. Not
  much, but a start. It would have to do for now. Barney was still woefully
  confused. She would have to wait until he was a little more like himself.
  Sally was quite willing to wait. Fundamentally she was a sensible girl. Most
  women are, when it comes to getting what they want. And Sally knew what she
  wanted. Also she knew how to set about getting it.</p>

  <p>Barney looked after her as she threaded her pert little way neatly down
  the veranda. That was Sally Brent. Barney decided he did not dislike the
  girl. Rather a nice little thing. No brain, but harmless. Then he turned and
  regarded everybody reproachfully. "Please hurry away from here," was clearly
  expressed in his eyes. And when at last the house had relapsed into its
  accustomed tranquillity, he hurried indoors and returned with his easel. In
  front of this he crouched, his eyes caressing the canvas. Presently he began
  to paint as if prompted by some inner voice.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When Scott Munson left the room after demonstrating the
method and manner
  of Lane Holt's death, he did not return to the library. At the moment of
  triumph he was in a bitter mood. There was still another murder to be solved,
  and this time he would not be on the side of his friend Daniel Crewe. He
  would be out to get Daniel, and Munson felt that the time was drawing near. A
  moment of freedom again, then darkness and despair. What a tough break. What
  a miserable situation.</p>

  <p>He moved to one of the French windows and looked into the library. There
  was Manning, the libidinous old fool, looking as if he'd just swallowed the
  canary. What was he smirking at, anyway? Munson idly shifted his gaze. Oh,
  yes, that was it. Not a bad leg either. One could depend on Manning's good
  taste in these matters. The jury was back now. There could be only one
  verdict. Evidently so thought the jury for, without any further taking of
  testimony, it attributed the death of Lane Holt to a self-inflicted wound
  from a bullet entering the brain through the left temple.</p>

  <p>As Daniel's friends gathered round him, extending hands and offering
  congratulations, Munson witnessed the scene ironically. He wondered what
  Daniel was thinking deep down in his heart. These good people believed that
  everything was over now, everything but the shouting, when in reality
  everything was just beginning. And there was Sam Stoughten, suspect number
  two. Sam was not looking so cheerful as the occasion might seem to warrant.
  As a matter of fact, Sam was relieved but feeling far from hilarious. "If
  that devil Munson is as clever as all that," he was thinking to himself,
  "what chance have we got against him? He'll have us all strung up before the
  end of the week." He did not bother Daniel at the moment, but picked his way
  to the veranda, where to his ill-concealed disgust he encountered the object
  of his thoughts. Munson favored Sam with a long, deep, and penetrating
  scrutiny, under the intensity of which his depression became even more
  depressed.</p>

  <p>"Been getting drunk lately?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"Chuck it, Scott," said Sam. "Don't crow. You turned a neat trick this
  time. Things looked bad for Daniel."</p>

  <p>"Looked?" replied Munson.</p>

  <p>To Sam's relief he was joined by his wife, June, and Daniel. June Lansing
  was the happiest one of the group. Scott found himself wondering about
  that.</p>

  <p>"Scott Munson," she said, "you're a wizard. I feel almost as if you'd
  saved Dan's life."</p>

  <p>"Dan saved his own life this time," replied Munson, looking unsmilingly at
  Daniel. "I hope he'll be as successful in the future."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Daniel dryly. "I'll do my damnedest, Scott."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll need it," responded Munson. He was actually angry with
  Daniel for having placed him in the position in which he found himself. If
  Daniel hadn't been so hopelessly pig-headed, everything might have been
  different. And Munson had given him every chance, practically begged him for
  his confidence.</p>

  <p>June did not relish the element of grimness underlying the exchange of
  remarks between the two men. "How do you mean Daniel saved himself?" she
  asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"He told me he heard something scraping across the floor," replied Munson.
  "That piece of gratuitous information kept turning up in my mind. I was
  continually hearing that scraping. If I hadn't been so dumb I'd have figured
  out the whole thing the moment I saw the strand of thread attached to the
  revolver. What puzzled me was that Daniel didn't mention hearing a bump when
  the revolver fell back to the floor. You must have heard a bump, Dan."</p>

  <p>"I heard it," said Dan, "but at the time I didn't think it important. It
  was just by good luck I happened to mention the scraping."</p>

  <p>"Well, you scraped yourself out with your ears this time," observed Munson
  sardonically, as he turned from the group. "And," he added, looking back,
  "you've gotten to know what the inside of a cell looks like."</p>

  <p>"I can't get over the feeling that he's a mean man," said Sam Stoughten.
  "A wise-cracking snake in the grass."</p>

  <p>After dinner that evening Munson sat alone. For his cogitations he had
  selected a secluded section of the veranda. When daylight came, a large
  collection of stubs from methodically and occasionally irritably smoked
  cigarettes could be seen sprinkling the lawn in the neighborhood of the chair
  in which Munson had sat.</p>

  <p>Scott realized with a sinking sensation that the time for a final showdown
  was at hand. Yet some nebulous, vaguely revealed idea at the back of his mind
  was warning him to go slow. It was like a voice urging him to take one more
  look before he leaped finally and irrevocably.</p>

  <p>Lane Holt was eliminated. That was flat. And the elimination of Lane Holt
  immediately suggested a simple, attractive, and highly dishonorable way out
  of an appalling situation, one that might eventually prove to be even more
  appalling than Munson cared to admit to himself.</p>

  <p>Lane Holt was out of the way, but Tom and Betty remained behind to damn
  his name eternally. The story of these two eye-witnesses was made ready to
  hand for Scott Munson's purposes, should he be weak enough to take the easy
  way out of his difficulties. However, Scott Munson was not so constituted. He
  had said he was going to go through with this case regardless of whom it
  affected. He had given his word to the district attorney he would play no
  favorites. But stronger than any promptings of honor, any considerations of
  friendship or professional achievement, was a grim element in his spiritual
  as well as intellectual composition that forced him to go through with a job
  once he had tackled it. Consequences did not count. If the true solution of a
  certain problem would have resulted in the destruction of the human race,
  Munson would have been an extremely uncomfortable person to have around. In
  spite of the restraining influence of common sense and kindness, his
  strongest instincts would have driven him at that problem even though its
  solution involved his own elimination together with the remainder of less
  inquisitive mankind.</p>

  <p>Munson had never attached much importance to Lane Holt's part in the
  tragedy of Emily-Jane. He had never credited the man with sufficient
  emotional drive to enable him to commit the act. The murder of Emily-Jane had
  been no easy task. It had been, as a matter of fact, far more difficult
  psychologically, far more opposed to a man's natural instincts, than a murder
  done in the heat of passion. The cowardly element involved in her murder must
  have been recognized and overcome by the person contemplating the deed. The
  murder, when considered apart from the circumstances surrounding it and the
  motives leading up to it, was of a particularly cruel and brutal nature. Just
  the right kind of murder for such a creature as Emily-Jane.</p>

  <p>Nor did Munson place any great reliance in the obviously biased story of
  Betty Harrison. Up to a certain point the girt had remained veracious, but at
  the critical moment her natural honesty had cracked under the strain of her
  loyalty to Daniel and her ill will against Lane Holt. Her vision had become
  considerably impaired. Tom Shanks, her slave, was hopeless. He saw through
  the eyes of Betty and thought with Betty's brain.</p>

  <p>Although Scott Munson was morally certain that Daniel had murdered Emily-
  Jane, he found it more difficult to eliminate Sam Stoughten from his
  thoughts. Sam had already to his credit one attempted murder. Beyond any
  question of doubt it had been his hand that had driven the knife through the
  curtain and into Daniel's arm on the night of the dance. Sam had intended
  that knife to put a very definite and speedy end to the triumphal but
  ruthless progress of Emily-Jane. He had been alone and unobserved in the
  dining-room with immediate access to a diversity of knives. He had had
  control of the light switches. He had a clear mental picture of the group of
  three and of Emily-Jane's exact position in that group. A long-bladed dinner
  knife had been used. Sam's forger-prints had been found on its handle.</p>

  <p>Sam had motives enough and more to energize his hand. His loyalty to
  Daniel was not the least of them. That motive was, perhaps, even stronger
  than any personal consideration. Stoughten was Daniel's confidant. Better
  than anyone else he had known what dark, unhappy thoughts were troubling his
  friend's mind. So strong was his affection for Daniel he had proved himself
  capable of attempting murder himself rather than to let Daniel become
  involved. He knew that his old roommate was snared in the net so skilfully
  cast by Emily-Jane. Sam further knew that Daniel would never let her marry
  Barney. Step by step Sam had seen the situation mounting to a climax. He had
  been on the inside all along. He had shared Daniel's thoughts and had been
  aware of his unsuccessful attempts to persuade Emily-Jane to give up
  Barney.</p>

  <p>Munson recalled that brief passage at arms between Emily-Jane and Sam
  Stoughten on the veranda of the club-house. That conversation had dealt with
  letters&mdash;Sam's letters to Emily-Jane. The existence of those letters
  alone constituted sufficient motive for murder. As long as that slim packet
  remained in possession of Emily-Jane there would not be a care-free minute in
  Sam Stoughten's life. And Sam had not been in his room at the time of the
  murder. He had been out in the night and had lied most uneffectually about
  his movements.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson realized that he could present such a strong case against
  Stoughten to any jury that a conviction of first degree murder would result
  on the first ballot.</p>

  <p>Yet, in spite of this, in spite of all the damning evidence Munson could
  so easily produce, he knew in his heart that Sam Stoughten had not murdered
  Emily-Jane. But he was also equally certain that Sam had been present at the
  time of the murder, that he had been close at hand and witnessed the whole
  thing. Sam had been the figure that had backed into the bushes. Munson was
  sure of this, and he was no less sure that within a few days now he would
  force Sam to say what he had seen.</p>

  <p>With Sam out of it there remained only Daniel, and several times since the
  murder he had tacitly admitted his guilt. There was hardly anything left for
  him to do. The trail he had left behind him could have been picked up and
  followed by the veriest novice. Daniel had gone out of his way to supply an
  abundance of clues. His motive for murdering Emily-Jane had been even
  stronger than Sam's. And ever since the murder Daniel had conducted himself
  like a man whose soul had been forfeited to the devil. Previous to the death
  of Emily-Jane, Scott Munson had clearly seen murder in Daniel's eyes. After
  her death, Munson had seen in the eyes of his friend the tortured conscience
  of a man who had taken a human life against all his natural instincts; forno
  matter how strongly convinced of the rightness of his act Daniel might have
  been intellectually, it was plain to Scott Munson that his being cried out
  against it.</p>

  <p>Once more Munson saw Daniel standing rigid and horror bound before that
  accusing picture being painted by Barney. There stood a murderer if Munson
  had even seen one. An open confession of his guilt was stamped on his drawn
  face.</p>

  <p>Daniel Crewe a murderer! Munson rose abruptly and in the darkness paced
  the veranda. Murder with premeditation, and yet when viewed in a certain
  light Daniel's mad act had been about the greatest sacrifice one man can make
  for another. It had been a sacrifice greater than death itself, for even if
  Daniel escaped the chair he would carry his guilt in his heart with him
  through life. And the awful memory of that night on High Point Rock would
  always linger in his eyes and dwell deep in his thoughts. There would be
  nights when Emily-Jane would return to Daniel to taunt and torture him, and
  Daniel in his dreams would become a murderer again.</p>

  <p>Pacing there in the darkness, Munson realized all this, and he understood
  the subtle ramifications of this so-called crime. What a rotten hand for life
  to have dealt to a decent player like Dan.</p>

  <p>The cigarette Munson tossed aside was one of those most irritably smoked.
  It had been a thoroughly unsatisfactory cigarette. Munson stopped pacing long
  enough to contemplate its tiny light glowing in the grass. He was well rid of
  that cigarette. He continued down the veranda to the far end. When he
  returned to his chair he found it occupied by a dark, motionless figure.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" he demanded sharply.</p>

  <p>"Stoughten," came the quiet reply. "Didn't know I had taken your chair,
  Munson. I wanted to be alone to think."</p>

  <p>"Well, you've a devil of a lot to think about, Sam," said Munson. "I
  wouldn't care to be entertained by the thoughts that are passing through your
  mind at this moment."</p>

  <p>"Nor I by yours," rejoined Stoughten. "Draw up a chair and sit down,
  Scott."</p>

  <p>Munson found a chair for himself, and for some minutes the two men sat
  smoking in silence.</p>

  <p>"Well," asked Sam at last, "who did it, Munson?"</p>

  <p>"Either you did it or Dan," replied Scott bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Any particular preference?" Sam inquired.</p>

  <p>"I'm playing no favorites," said Munson. "The both of you look guilty as
  hell to me."</p>

  <p>"Scott"&mdash;Sam's voice was serious&mdash;"suppose I should tell you
  that Daniel had no hand in the affair. Suppose I could convince you that I
  was present at the time of the murder. Suppose I could prove to your entire
  satisfaction that, although he may have intended to murder Emily-Jane, he did
  not actually do it. Would you, under those circumstances, lay off of
  Dan?"</p>

  <p>"You'd have some damn tall proving to do, Sam," replied Munson, "and if
  you did succeed in convincing me, I'd have only one choice left."</p>

  <p>"And that choice?" Sam had lowered his voice. "To arrest you on a charge
  of murder," said Munson.</p>

  <p>Sam stiffened slightly in his chair. When he spoke again it was almost as
  if he were speaking to himself.</p>

  <p>"It would be the better choice, at that," he remarked, "but perhaps there
  doesn't need to be any arrest at all. I saw the whole affair and I'm not at
  all sure that the death of Emily-Jane wasn't purely accidental." Suddenly he
  came to life and regarded Munson triumphantly. "I think I've got you, Scott,"
  he continued slowly. "No matter which way you move I think I've got you
  blocked. Both Betty and Tom are ready to swear themselves blue in the face
  that Lane Holt did it. Now, I am the only other eye-witness and I can do
  either one of two things&mdash;swear that Emily-Jane's death was due to an
  accident, or substantiate the evidence of Betty and Tom. In either case you'd
  be left high and dry."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have overlooked, Sam," replied Munson quietly, "several small
  but important details. Earlier in the evening an attempt was made on the life
  of Emily-Jane, who later was found dead. I happen to know the person who made
  that first attempt. As for motive I have some letters. And just to give you a
  little surplus food for thought, I'm not at all sure that I may not be able
  to unearth still another eye-witness."</p>

  <p>Sam sank back hopelessly in his chair, his inspiration drained. For a
  minute he had been foolish enough to believe he had discovered a way out of
  the difficulty for both Daniel and himself. He saw now that there was no way
  out.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with those letters, Scott?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We'll talk about them," replied Munson, rising from his chair, "when you
  are a little more willing to talk... sensibly."</p>

  <p>He left Sam sitting despondently in his chair and went directly to his
  room. Here he produced his note-book and thoughtfully studied the little
  design he had copied from the sand. Just what was he trying to prove and how
  was he going to set about doing it at this late date? He closed the book and
  slipped it back into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Another eye-witness," he said to himself, "or the whole truth from Sam.
  Must get one or the other, and I might need both."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; THE INEVITABLE DRAWS NEARER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DANIEL and June were idling along the Cliff Path. They had
  little to say to each other. There was little that required saying. Both were
  smoking nervously. Daniel was scarring the toes of his boots by kicking
  stones from the path. He was conscientious about it. Apparently his idea was
  to leave no stone unturned. June was impartially slashing at weeds and wild
  flowers with a thin stick. It made a swishing sound that was satisfying to
  the ear. A serious, industrious pair they made... and miserable.</p>

  <p>Ahead of them High Point Rock rose against the sky. Neither June nor
  Daniel turned to look in that direction. Instinctively their gaze avoided the
  spot from which Emily-Jane had dropped out of life. Daniel halted and leveled
  his eyes on the waters of the Sound. June came and stood beside him.</p>

  <p>"It would be that way," remarked Daniel.</p>

  <p>"The old trail, the old trail, the trail that is always new!" she
  murmured. "I'd like to take it, Dan."</p>

  <p>"All the world and places," replied Daniel. "Gad, if we could only make
  it!"</p>

  <p>She took his hand, which was hanging impotently at his side. "Trust me,
  Dan," she said. "I'll get you by."</p>

  <p>He made no reply other than giving her hand a friendly squeeze.</p>

  <p>"Wish Barney would give up that damn picture," he said presently. "It's
  got on my nerves terribly for some reason. Feel as if I wouldn't be able to
  stand it much longer."</p>

  <p>"Poor old mule-faced Dan"&mdash;June's voice was sympathetic&mdash;"you've
  been having a pretty tough time of late. For your sake I hope things look up
  a bit."</p>

  <p>"For the both of us," he said, his eyes still straining out across the
  water.</p>

  <p>As if by common consent they turned and started to retrace their steps.
  Neither of them had any desire to stand on High Point Rock. Then they
  stopped. Scott Munson was swinging along the path. When he drew up in front
  of them they noticed that his dark eyes were unusually sharp and
  searching.</p>

  <p>"Came along," he said in a friendly voice, taking Daniel by his uninjured
  arm. "I want you both to help me out with a little idea of mine."</p>

  <p>"More wizardry, Scott?" June inquired.</p>

  <p>"No," said Munson briefly. "Merely the application of common sense to a
  given set of circumstances."</p>

  <p>He was leading them in the direction of High Point Rock. Daniel moved with
  reluctance. His nerve seemed to have deserted him. The old inner trembling
  had re-turned. He felt that he would not be responsible for his actions if he
  set foot on that spot again. Little beads of sweat stood out on his forehead.
  He tried to force himself forward, but his feet dragged.</p>

  <p>"It's hot," he said, stopping and fumbling for his handkerchief. "We were
  just going home, Scott."</p>

  <p>"Well, this won't take you long," replied Munson easily. "And I really do
  need your help."</p>

  <p>Daniel allowed himself to be led along. Under Munson's hand his arm
  quivered slightly. June said nothing. She was furtively regarding Munson, and
  there was a strange probing expression in her eyes. It was as if she were
  endeavoring to read the man's mind, to anticipate his next move.</p>

  <p>"You're getting lazy, Dan," she remarked. "The walk will do you
  good&mdash;stretch those long legs of yours."</p>

  <p>They were on the cliff now, and Munson was directing their steps toward
  the exact spot on which Daniel had stood when Emily-Jane had gone twisting
  down into the black void opening up at his feet. They had reached the place.
  Daniel stood rooted to it. He felt that at any moment he would point to the
  bushes and explain to Munson exactly where he had hidden while watching Holt
  and Emily-Jane. The temptation was well-nigh irresistible. It would be a
  relief to get the whole thing off his chest, to be done with it and to know
  the worst rather than to be expecting it with every intake of his breath. The
  idea grew in fascination. It was as much as he could do to prevent himself
  from raising his arm and pointing to the bushes. Scott Munson's face would
  make an interesting study. Daniel wondered what he would say, how he would
  look.</p>

  <p>Munson was examining the ground with the professional interest of a stage
  manager. He had no eyes for either Daniel or June, and Daniel was just as
  well pleased. By this time Daniel's state of agitation was only too apparent
  in his face. So greatly was he affected by the spot that he felt again the
  hot moist trickle of blood running down his left arm from the knife wound.
  All his previous sensations returned to him. He was unable to ward them
  off.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson was speaking. His voice seemed distant and indistinct. "Now,
  June," he was saying, placing the girl at the edge of the cliff, "you stand
  right here and hold that position. As I figure it out that's where Emily-Jane
  must have stood."</p>

  <p>June's face was colorless. Her eyes had taken on a hard, defiant
  expression. She looked steadily at Munson.</p>

  <p>"You're showing us a good time, Scott," she said. "You wouldn't like me to
  jump off, would you?"</p>

  <p>Apparently too preoccupied to answer, Munson turned to Daniel. "Stand
  close to June," said Munson. "and put your hand on her arm or her
  shoulder."</p>

  <p>Stiffly, automatically, Daniel did as he was bidden. Munson stepped back a
  few paces and studied the pair.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, as if to himself, "that's just about how it must have
  been. Now please hold it, both of you, until I give the word." He hurried
  away, and June found herself alone with Daniel, looking into his fixed,
  staring eyes. But Daniel did not seem to see her. Emily-Jane was standing
  there between them. Daniel could feel her presence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly June screamed piercingly. She flung her arms round Daniel and for
  a moment they swayed at the edge of the cliff over which a hand had slid
  noiselessly and seized her by the ankle. A moment of cold terror. Then Daniel
  broke the spell, and dragged June back, breaking the clutch of the hand.
  Almost immediately Munson was with them. Solicitous apologies to June, to
  which she did not listen. She was leaning against Daniel's breast. Her head
  was on his shoulder. Little shudders ran through her body. She was very
  still. Daniel's lips were twisted in a white grin. His eyes, tired and
  sunken, never left Munson's face</p>

  <p>"Scott," he said, with a calmness that held a note of finality, "you
  excelled yourself this time. My congratulations and contempt."</p>

  <p>Munson was equally calm as he returned Daniel's gaze. "I am sorry you feel
  that way about it," he replied. He was angry with himself and the world in
  general. "Emily-Jane must have had an even more trying experience."</p>

  <p>"Emily-Jane deserved it. June has done nothing." Daniel's voice was
  harsh.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Munson smiled and took a hesitating step toward them. He looked
  old and tired. "Forgive me, both of you," he said, his low voice holding a
  note of warmth. "I couldn't keep myself from making the experiment. It was
  devilish of me, I realize now, but I wanted to find out if it could have been
  done that way, and now I know that it could."</p>

  <p>June released herself from Daniel's arms and turned to Munson with lips
  that were trying to smile.</p>

  <p>"You're a devil, Scott," she told him, "a devil straight from hell, but I
  think I understand. You're forgiven."</p>

  <p>"They don't come any gamer than you, June," said Munson.</p>

  <p>June's eyes were resting on Daniel, who was standing by lost in thought.
  This business couldn't go on much longer. He would have to confess. June
  uttered a little cry.</p>

  <p>A stream of blood was running freely down his hand and dripping to the
  ground from his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Strip off that coat," said Munson, and stepped quickly to Daniel's side.
  As he stanched the flow of blood with a clean white handkerchief, his gaze
  strayed over the water. "Evidently," he said rather bitterly, although his
  lips were smiling, "the gods don't expect a man in my shoes to be much of a
  human being."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When Munson returned to Crewe House he addressed himself to
the Shays.</p>

  <p>"It is more important than ever, he told them, that no one leave these
  grounds. You don't have to worry about the back of the house, because in that
  direction escape is effectually cut off by the marshes. A person would be a
  damn fool to risk the quagmires and quick-sand there. And you don't have to
  watch the Cliff Path. Nobody is going to jump off High Point Rock, or at
  least I don't think so. If they do"&mdash;he shrugged his
  shoulders&mdash;"we're saved a lot of trouble and unpleasantness. Just keep
  your eye on the road and the gardens at the east end of the house, and for
  God's sake don't pull your guns unless you are damn well sure you can't carry
  on without them. As a matter of fact, I don't think anyone is going to try to
  get away, but we can't afford to take any chances. We're just about ready now
  to put the handles on this case."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice he said 'we'?" asked Officer Shad, as Munson strode across
  the lawn and descended the steps to the beach.</p>

  <p>"That's as it should be," replied Officer Red, "considering what we've
  been through."</p>

  <p>Munson laid hands on the first canoe he could find and unceremoniously
  dragged it across the sand to the water's edge. He shoved off from the beach
  with a dexterity bred of experience and soon was paddling easily over the
  gently marcelled surface of the Sound.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson was not at all pleased with the events of the morning and the
  part he had played in them. He had succeeded in throwing June Lansing,
  usually so hard-boiled and imperturbable, into a state of white terror, and
  he had been instrumental in opening the wound in Daniel's arm. Funny thing
  about that wound. It was almost as if it had opened itself under the
  influence of auto-suggestion. Yet in spite of these contretemps, as
  regrettable as they were, Munson had proved to his own satisfaction that
  Emily-June could have been thrown off her balance by a hand tugging at her
  ankle from the ledge. To this extent the theory he had been holding in
  reserve was not so wild, not so impossible of practical application. He was
  now following up that theory&mdash;not hopefully, but with characteristic
  thoroughness.</p>

  <p>About a mile and a half ahead of him, three low rocky islands lay
  somnolently in the water washing against them. Munson was bound for these
  islands, upon one of which he had good reason to believe Pete Clark was
  reclining in Olympian isolation. Munson skirted the outer island and found it
  unadorned by the picturesque person of his quarry. Neither had Pete Clark
  selected the second island for his philosophic re-pose, but upon the third
  and last rocky retreat there lay Pete Clark. He was resting easily. Beneath
  his head a gunny-sack, redolent of fish at their worst, had been nicely
  adjusted at exactly the desired angle, enabling the recumbent figure to view
  both sea and sky with the minimum of bodily effort and fatigue. Hard by on
  the rocks, within easy reach of the most languid hand, rested a battered tin
  box. Pete regarded with disapproval the method employed by some deep thinkers
  of conducting their meditations on an empty stomach. And from the position of
  the sun, Pete was seriously considering the advisability of disturbing
  himself to the extent of appeasing his appetite. He sighed and considered the
  box out of the corner of his eyes.</p>

  <p>When Munson scrambled over the rocks and stood above him, Pete evinced no
  surprise. Maybe Munson would do something about the midday meal, open the box
  and distribute its contents, or something.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Mr. Munson," said Pete. "What brings you to this God-forsaken
  place?"</p>

  <p>"You do," replied Munson, sitting down beside him. "You do, Pete."</p>

  <p>The occasional fisherman looked a little disturbed. "And what can I do for
  you, Mr. Munson?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing violent," Munson hastened to assure him. "Just a little help,
  that's all."</p>

  <p>He looked so long at Pete's feet that their owner, as if for the first
  time in his life, became aware of their presence. He, too, regarded his feet
  with mild interest not unmixed with a little surprise. Those were his feet,
  those large, still objects down there. Well, they would never be able to say
  he had not spared them as much as possible. As far as use was concerned they
  were virtually new.</p>

  <p>"Are these the same shoes you were wearing when you found the body of Miss
  Seabrook on the rocks?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"I always wear the same shoes," answered Pete with deliberation, "except
  when I go barefooted."</p>

  <p>"A good idea," said Munson approvingly. "'Makes everything so much
  simpler. I thought they were the same shoes because they've been in my mind a
  good deal lately."</p>

  <p>Pete Clark permitted himself a momentary glow of pride. He even went so
  far as to wiggle his feet almost playfully.</p>

  <p>"The way it must have been," continued Munson, as much for his own benefit
  as his listener's, "was that you were walking along the beach just before you
  discovered the body of the girl lying on the rocks. And you weren't thinking
  much, Pete, about anything in particular. You were just sort of grazing
  along. Then your eyes must have been attracted by some small bright object
  lying in the sand. After considering the pros and cons of the situation you
  no doubt decided that the object was sufficiently interesting to justify your
  picking it up. And you did pick that object up, Pete. You picked it up,
  examined it, slipped it into your pocket and forgot all about it. Am I
  right?"</p>

  <p>"Where were you hiding?" demanded Pete.</p>

  <p>"Under the bedclothes in my room," replied Munson. "I was still sleeping,
  but it just had to be that way. I read the whole story in the sand,
  Pete."</p>

  <p>"Well I'm not cockeyed myself when it comes to seeing things along
  beaches," said Clark, "but you're a damned sight more seeing than me. That's
  just exactly the way it was. I saw the bright little gadget sparkling there
  in the sand. I picked it up and slipped it into my pocket. When you asked me
  if I had seen or found anything, I'd clean forgotten about it."</p>

  <p>"And where is that bright little object now?" inquired Munson.</p>

  <p>Pete thought for some time. Presently his contorted features relaxed, and
  his natural face, looking a little overworked, once more reappeared. "Last
  time I saw it," he said, "one of the kids was playing with it."</p>

  <p>"Didn't know you had any children, Pete. Congratulations."</p>

  <p>Pete accepted the felicitation rather cynically, Munson thought. "Oh, yes,
  I've got children right enough," he replied. "Several sets of them."</p>

  <p>"Where do they live?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"Different places," was Pete's evasive reply. "Round about. Might run into
  one of them most anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's that way," said Munson. "I see." "Yes, it's that way," admitted
  Pete.</p>

  <p>"And where does the child who was playing with that gadget live?"</p>

  <p>"At home," said Pete. "My regular home. She's official."</p>

  <p>"That's nice," replied Munson. "Suppose you take me there." He produced
  several crumpled bills, which Pete regarded without any great show of
  interest. "Some for you and some for her," Munson added.</p>

  <p>"Got to eat first," Pete replied. "You eaten?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said Munson. "Lost my appetite this morning."</p>

  <p>"Well, try one of these," the other suggested, as he opened the battered
  tin box and fingered out a handful of sandwiches, a suspicious-looking chunk
  of cheese, and two pitifully bruised peaches.</p>

  <p>Munson gladly accepted the provender Pete allotted him with scrupulous
  fairness, and together they made a silent but satisfactory meal.</p>

  <p>"Usually sleep after eating," Pete observed tentatively, when the last
  gulp of food had ceased to distend his throat. "How about you, Mr.
  Munson?"</p>

  <p>"Usually, Pete, but nothing doing today. Got a lot of trouble on my hands.
  No time for sleep now." Munson helped Pete to rise, helped him to launch his
  boat, and virtually lifted him into it. After this he shoved off in his canoe
  and followed Pete's leisurely progress landward.</p>

  <p>The Clarks had a marsh exposure. A small, unlovely frame building housed
  an indeterminate number of them. Mrs. Clark gave the appearance of a woman
  who did as well as she could for herself and for any-one else who happened to
  be around at the time of doing. She showed no surprise at the unexpected
  return of her husband. She was neither elated nor depressed. He was there.
  She accepted the situation.</p>

  <p>After a lame introduction Pete led Munson off to search for the child last
  seen playing with the gadget. She was found, and her name turned out to be
  May. She was playing with a new gadget now and she had no idea where the
  other one could be unless it had worked its way into the depth of a towering
  pile of oyster-shells to which she pointed with a languor characteristic of
  her sire. Munson regarded the pile and thirsted for his staff. The Shays
  would have been invaluable at this moment, but the Shays were otherwise
  engaged. The pile was up to Munson. After subsidizing both May and her father
  and intimating the probability of a suitable reward upon the successful
  conclusion of their joint efforts, Munson removed his coat, and the three of
  them became intimately involved with oyster-shells.</p>

  <p>At the end of two painful hours, hours that always lingered in the mind of
  Pete Clark, the searchers among the shells were no nearer success, but much
  nearer total exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"Never knew I owned so many shells," said Pete at last, in an effort to
  look on the bright side of things.</p>

  <p>"Well, you certainly own a lot, pa," replied his daughter, not without
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"If you ask my opinion," announced Munson, his fatigue-drawn face
  appearing over the rim of the pile, "you own exactly one too many shells,
  Pete."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Clark issued from the back door and stood for a while contemplating
  the activities of the searching party. "What do you all want to be doing that
  for?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It's a gadget, mother," said Pete. "A bright little gadget with stones
  and all. May claims she lost it here or hereabouts."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that !" exclaimed the lady, with a depreciating wave of her right
  hand. "Why didn't you say so before? I picked it up and tucked it away in my
  bureau drawer. You should of asked."</p>

  <p>Slowly Munson's face once more rose above the shells. It was a sad face
  and a weary one. For a while he looked at May, then shifted his gaze to Pete.
  Finally he raised his eyes to the sky as if seeking strength and refuge in
  prayer. Apparently he derived some benefit from this, for when he spoke his
  voice was calm.</p>

  <p>"She's right," he said. "I guess we should have asked."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Barney's easel was standing in the hall. A single lamp
above it shed a
  soft glow over the canvas. Before the picture Daniel was standing, and in his
  hand he held a knife. The ship's clock in the library had just sounded two
  bells&mdash;an hour past midnight. The silence in the old house was almost
  liquid. Like a stream it moved through the hall. From the beach came the
  slow, low, methodical break and wash of the surf. The sound rose and fell
  painfully in the back of Daniel's mind.</p>

  <p>And his face was like a mask of pain. The experience of the morning on the
  cliffs had left its traces there. Then to come home to this&mdash;this
  reproduction of horror. There it stood waiting for a few swift brush
  strokes&mdash;ten minutes' work&mdash;to reveal his crime to the world, to
  perpetuate it.</p>

  <p>Daniel's eyes clouded as he raised the knife. It would be like cutting a
  part out of his own life, destroying something of himself. If he did it he
  might sleep. But he could not do it. His hand was powerless to strike. The
  picture was not completed. A low gasp escaped from his lips as the knife
  dropped to the floor. He turned away.</p>

  <p>Scott Munson did not pause as he slowly descended the stairs. Across the
  silence their eyes met&mdash;a wordless exchange of mutual regret and
  understanding.</p>

  <p>"You'd better get back to bed, Daniel," said Munson quietly. "You need
  some sleep."</p>

  <p>"All right, Scott," said Daniel. "I'll try again. If I don't get some
  sleep soon, something is going to crack."</p>

  <p>He passed Munson and continued on up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Gradually he merged into the darkness that lay on the upper hall. A low
  "good night" drifted down to Munson.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Daniel," he called back softly.</p>

  <p>Daniel let himself into June's room and lay down beside her on the top of
  the light coverings. Her arms drew him to her.</p>

  <p>"Keep on fighting, Daniel," she whispered. "We mustn't give up now."</p>

  <p>Gradually Daniel's inner trembling ceased, and presently he slept, but
  June remained awake, her wide eyes looking up into the darkness that lay upon
  them.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; THE LOST DOMINO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Daniel had mounted into the darkness of the upper hall,
  Munson approached Barney's painting and stood regarding it with decidedly
  disapproving eyes. He realized that in a sense this painting was an ally of
  his, but he could not bring himself to consider it with any measure of
  appreciation. Young Barney should not be doing a thing like that. One
  inquisitor in the house was quite sufficient. He would have to have that
  little talk with Barney. High time he was given the low-down on the
  situation. Daniel might deserve to be smitten down by the impersonal hand of
  the law, but certainly not by his brother. Standing before the painting,
  Munson decided that Barney was due for a shock&mdash;a flock of shocks, in
  fact.</p>

  <p>He turned from the picture and let his gaze wander round the long wide
  hall. Something was on his mind, something that had given him a shock. The
  wild theory he had been holding in reserve was gradually taking the sharp,
  definite outlines of a conviction. And that conviction was in some way
  associated with the kitchen and a nocturnal cup of tea. Aunt Matty had never
  found the lost domino. Neither had Scott Munson, although, unknown to Aunt
  Matty, he had added to her plaintively peering eyes the best efforts of his
  own.</p>

  <p>Entering the dining-room on noiseless feet, he crossed over to the pantry
  door and glanced through its small leaded window. One glance was enough to
  attract and to hold his attention. He thrust his hands comfortably into his
  pockets and settled back on his heels like a man prepared to stay where he
  was for some time to come. There was a puzzled expression in his eyes and his
  lips barely betrayed the suggestion of a smile.</p>

  <p>What he saw was nothing less than the Shays in united action. The light
  was burning in the kitchen and beneath its sharp radiance Officers Shad and
  Red were moving about contortedly. From their singularly unsuccessful efforts
  to walk on tiptoe Munson concluded their lives heretofore must have been open
  books, unsullied by deception. As if in atonement for an occasional collision
  with a chair or a table, Officer Red applied one finger permanently to his
  lips. Munson gained the impression that his stout, rubicund assistant
  entertained the hope of impressing the inanimate objects that seemed to
  bestrew his path with the urgent need of the utmost silence and secrecy. It
  was too much to ask of any kitchen furniture, and finally when Officer Shad,
  in stooping over, brought that part of his body which was opposite his head
  but at a slightly higher elevation smartly against the pointed corner of a
  table, the result was disastrous. Both Shad and the table vied with each
  other in making the air hideous with sound. A plate crashed to the floor, and
  Red became much redder. But as far as Shad was concerned, he was standing in
  a vast silence in which only pain existed, pain and outraged dignity.</p>

  <p>"What did you want to do that for?" demanded Red in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Just to see how it would feel," replied Shad, his usually mild eyes
  blinking with hostility. "You should try it. It's a lot of fun."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Red, "but there's no need to make such a noise about it . .
  . breaking plates and everything."</p>

  <p>Shad laughed dramatically. "Did you ever bring yours up against the sharp
  point of a table?" he inquired softly. For a moment his gaze dwelt on a
  rather self-assertive section of his colleague's body, then once more he
  indulged in unpleasant laughter. "But it wouldn't hurt yours," he added with
  brutal frankness. "Yours is too damn fat."</p>

  <p>Officer Red Shay did not exactly toss his head, but the dignity of his
  bearing eloquently expressed the fact that his mind was bent on higher if not
  larger things, and that there were some subjects he positively declined to
  discuss. Once more the search commenced, and the mildly diverted Munson found
  himself wondering what motive, if any, animated the activities of his staff.
  His curiosity grew to the proportions of a definite need to know. The Shays
  were stealthily peering into pots and pans, table drawers, and closets.
  Officer Red even went so far as to sound the walls with a delicate finger.
  This last was too much for Munson. He quietly opened the pantry door and,
  remaining in the unlighted pantry as he had done once before on the night of
  the murder of Emily-Jane, spoke to his staff from the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Would you kindly try to tell me," he asked in a quiet voice, "what the
  devil you two imagine you're doing?"</p>

  <p>The unexpectedness of this disembodied question completely demoralized the
  officers. Motionless they remained in exactly the same position they had been
  in when the voice smote their ears. They poised frozenly as if playing a
  tragically earnest adaptation of "still waters, no more moving." Only their
  eyes moved and they were very busy as they darted about the room in quest of
  the owner of the voice. When Munson emerged into the light of the kitchen the
  tableau disintegrated with twin sighs of profound relief.</p>

  <p>"You gave us such a start, Mr. Munson," Officer Red was honest enough to
  admit.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Red," replied Munson, "but you haven't answered my question."</p>

  <p>"I don't rightly remember it, sir," said Officer Red.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the meaning of all this grotesque mincing about this kitchen
  like a couple of trick conspirators?" Munson demanded. "What do you hope to
  find here?"</p>

  <p>"We were looking for it," said Shad in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"It?" repeated Munson. "What?"</p>

  <p>"The will," announced Officer Shad.</p>

  <p>"What will and whose?" Scott Munson was becoming more and more
  perplexed.</p>

  <p>"The will that's at the bottom of all this trouble," explained Officer
  Red. "It was my idea, the will."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," said Munson, sitting down at the table and critically
  examining his finger-nails. "And it's not here, perhaps?" He eyed his staff
  sadly.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Munson," replied Officer Shad. "It's not here."</p>

  <p>Munson drummed on the table with the nails he had been recently
  inspecting.</p>

  <p>"I hate to discourage initiative," he said at last, "but in spite of my
  best efforts I can't disabuse my mind of the belief that you two are about
  the biggest damn fools I've ever had the good fortune&mdash;mind me, I say,
  good fortune&mdash;to meet. Still, I may be wrong. Possibly there are two
  bigger damn fools somewhere hidden in an obscure crevice of this earth. If
  that is so I hope they stay there."</p>

  <p>He rose from the table and switched the light on in the pantry. Aunt Matty
  was a hoarding housekeeper.</p>

  <p>The pantry was filled with earthenware jars and tin boxes. It was a
  storeroom of pleasant surprises. In the past it had never failed to whet
  Barney's curiosity and to stimulate his cupidity. There were many shelves and
  cupboards. Munson looked about him with interest. This was the only room in
  the house he had not searched. He had looked for that missing domino from
  attic to cellar. He had been through all the outhouses, and now he knew that
  if it was still in existence it must be somewhere in the room in which he
  stood. Well, he would give the boys a little encouragement, he decided. After
  his last remarks to them they deserved to be encouraged. He called them into
  the pantry.</p>

  <p>"Now, I'm going to give you something to look for," he promised them. "If
  your heads are so set on finding missing property, just swarm over this room
  and bring me back a domino."</p>

  <p>Blank amazement greeted his request.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't look much like a place where they'd hide games," said Officer
  Shad skeptically, glancing at the shelves and cupboards.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he wants a piece of sugar," suggested Officer Red.</p>

  <p>"No," said Scott. "And I don't mean a domino either in the strict usage of
  the word. What I want is a large, floppy, black garment with a hood on it. If
  you want to save yourself a lot of unnecessary exertion, which I suspect you
  do, I suggest you look through those lower cupboards first. Take the one in
  the extreme corner."</p>

  <p>Officer Shad, remembering the painful if ludicrous injury inflicted on his
  person by the table, squatted with surprising compactness, and opened the
  door to the cupboard. "Nothing in here," he announced, "except a lot of old
  stone jars. Seem empty to me."</p>

  <p>"How big are those stone jars, Shad?" asked Munson with sudden
  interest.</p>

  <p>"A matter of some two feet, I'd say," the officer replied.</p>

  <p>"Will you yank the one out that seems hardest to get at?"</p>

  <p>Shad inspected the jars with a calculating eye. "They're all hard to get
  at," he concluded.</p>

  <p>"But I said the hardest." Munson's voice was sharper now.</p>

  <p>With a grunt of utter weariness Shad thrust in a long arm and after a
  great deal of noise, succeeded in dragging forth a jar which obviously from
  his efforts must have been the hardest to get at.</p>

  <p>"Now lift off the top," said Munson.</p>

  <p>Shad obeyed, and Munson bent down quickly.</p>

  <p>"Now pull it out," he continued, and there was no elation in his voice. It
  sounded rather flat and tired.</p>

  <p>When Shad had drawn the crumpled black garment from the jar, he extended
  it to Munson. "You knew it was there all the time," said Shad in an injured
  voice.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't," Scott hastily disclaimed. "Honestly, Shad, I didn't. I
  just doped it out that the thing had to be there, or somewhere else close
  by."</p>

  <p>"Well, now that you've got it," inquired Officer Red sarcastically, "what
  are you going to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Put those jars back exactly as you found them," said Munson, "and keep
  this little incident strictly to yourselves. Don't ask foolish questions,
  Red, but go upstairs and park yourself in the hall. Watch all the doors. At
  the end of two hours come down and wake up Shad. He'll be making revolting
  noises on the couch in the library. We should have someone outside by rights,
  but I don't think the people involved in this case are going to try to make a
  getaway. Snap to it."</p>

  <p>The Shays' idea of snapping at that hour of the night was rather a languid
  stroll. Before the pantry door closed on them they glanced back at
  Munson.</p>

  <p>"What's he doing?" asked Red in a whisper. "Kissing it?"</p>

  <p>"Looks more like his nose," said Shad. "Perhaps he has a cold."</p>

  <p>Munson carried the domino to the kitchen and sat down. Again he sniffed at
  the neck band to which still clung a faint trace of scent, illusive, almost
  indefinable.</p>

  <p>Then he let the domino drop to his knees and sat staring straight ahead of
  him.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Bennett," said Munson on the following morning, when that
crisp, self-
  confident officer put in an appearance, "it's good to get you back. My staff
  is becoming almost too diverting."</p>

  <p>Bennett smiled appreciatively. "Have they been shooting up the countryside
  again?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Munson. "Looking for lost wills this time." He paused and
  passed a hand impatiently across his eyes. He had hardly slept at all that
  night. "Perhaps I wrong the Shays," he resumed. "When I come to consider it,
  they've been the only bright spot in this whole tragic business. You know,
  Bennett, whenever I have any dealings with those two broken reeds of the law
  I get the same feeling of bewilderment and unreality that poor Alice must
  have experienced at the mad tea-party. If they were just a little bit better
  I'd see that they were damn well fired from the force, but they're so dumb,
  so incredibly useless, I'm afraid to cast them adrift in this world of
  frenzied competition."</p>

  <p>Munson little realized as he spoke that despite his humane sentiments the
  Shays were destined soon to be cast very much adrift indeed.</p>

  <p>The two men were walking round the west side of the house. They came to
  the orchard and continued on in the direction of the salt marshes.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Munson slowly, in response to a question from his companion,
  "the case is about over as far as our end of it is concerned. Nothing remains
  to be done now save, perhaps, the most heart-breaking task that ever
  confronted a man. I'm such a coward, Bennett, that I'm tempted to clear out
  and let you take charge from here. I feel like an undertaker for broken
  souls."</p>

  <p>"If I can help to make things any easier, Mr. Munson," replied Bennett,
  "I'm at your disposal, although I don't like this business so much myself.
  They're all nice people," he added, with a backward jerk of his head in the
  direction of the house.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Bennett," said Munson. "I'll let you know. Let's go over there
  and have a little talk with Betty. That girl, I suspect, is a mine of
  information if you can only make her forget to tell lies."</p>

  <p>Betty was sitting on the same bench at the end of the orchard where she
  had first told her story of the murder of Emily-Jane. As Munson and Bennett,
  apparently engaged in casual conversation, strolled past the bench, Munson
  stopped, and with an arresting hand on the officer's arm, looked at the girl
  with a friendly grin.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that so, Betty?" he asked, hoping to arouse her curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Isn't what so, Mr. Munson?" asked Betty innocently, rising to the
  bait.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Bennett here was just saying," Munson explained,
  absent-mindedly sitting down beside Betty, "Officer Bennett was just saying
  that it's a downright shame so much fuss and worry should be made over the
  death of Miss Emily-Jane."</p>

  <p>For the peace of mind of one Thomas Shanks, it was fortunate he was not
  present to witness the look of warm approval with which Betty favored
  Bennett, who upon receiving it immediately felt compensated for the remark
  Munson had so callously put into his mouth.</p>

  <p>"And he's about right, too," replied Betty feelingly. "All the trouble
  started the moment she set foot in the house. Before that this place was one
  of the happiest spots in all the world. You know that yourself, Mr.
  Munson."</p>

  <p>The girl's words seemed to be stabbing the man who sat beside her. For a
  moment he forgot what he had come there for&mdash;the problem that was
  uppermost in his mind. He was thinking of life at Crewe House before the
  advent of Emily-Jane. He was thinking of the ideal understanding and
  comradeship that had bound the two brothers so closely together. He was
  thinking of the plans the three of them had made during the long, lazy summer
  hours. There was going to be a breakfast in Paris on a certain specified
  morning, followed by a flight over the Channel and several weeks in London.
  After that they had planned a walking trip in which ale had largely figured.
  Barney had insisted on making it a slouching trip, and from that had rapidly
  retrograded until the trip had become a "barely moving tour of some small and
  preferably level area of England." Scott recalled his words. Where was all
  that now? Barney had ceased to be absurd. Old friendships were split and
  embittered. The breakfast in Paris had been shot to hell. Murder and suicide
  had come to spend the summer. There was no getting rid of them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Betty," Munson replied. "That's just about the way of it. This place
  here was one of the happiest and fairest spots on God's green earth. Bennett,
  it would have done your heart good just to have been about for a while. There
  was something so damned restful and decent about the place and the people in
  it. I was a tired man when I first came here, but after a couple of days I
  wasn't tired any more, and now"&mdash;he hesitated a moment&mdash;"well, now
  I'm tired again, tired as hell."</p>

  <p>"You can thank that girl for that," said Betty, sticking to her original
  theme. "If she had never come here everything would be right now just like it
  had been before."</p>

  <p>"Did you feel like that all along, Betty?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"I certainly did," she replied. "Miss Emily-Jane never pulled the wool
  over my eyes, not for one second she didn't."</p>

  <p>"Nor mine," said Munson.</p>

  <p>"But she fooled most everybody else," the girl continued. "And she did it
  right in front of their eyes. It didn't take me long to see what kind she
  was&mdash;always pawing the men-folks with her hands and laughing up into
  their silly eyes, and poor easy-going Mr. Barney thinking she was just grand.
  It's a good thing for him she's gone. Why, the very afternoon of the party
  she&mdash;" Betty broke off suddenly and failed to complete her sentence.
  "I'd better be getting back to the house," she said. "They'll be hollering
  for me up there."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I imagine you noticed a lot, Betty," thoughtfully observed Scott
  Munson, rising lazily from the bench. "A girl like you with eyes in her head
  sees a great deal more than people give her credit for. Isn't that so?"</p>

  <p>Betty laughed knowingly. "I saw a whole lot more than Miss Emily-Jane ever
  wanted me to see," she replied. "I know for certain she tried to make a go
  for Mr. Daniel. I saw her try it with my own two eyes."</p>

  <p>"But she was out of luck there," said Munson encouragingly. "What did Mr.
  Daniel do, Betty? Did he give her the cold shoulder?"</p>

  <p>"He did that," Betty stoutly declared. "And she gave him the bare
  shoulder. I was standing in one of the alcoves and I saw the whole thing. I
  saw Mr. Dan pulling himself away from her. He was trying to get out of her
  room and she was holding him back with her naked arm. I'll never forget the
  look on his face. It was awful. And she laughed and asked him to call
  again."</p>

  <p>"When did that happen?" asked Munson casually.</p>

  <p>"Only a few hours before she was standing up before all the world,
  publicly engaging herself to Mr. Dan's own blood brother," she announced
  triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"It was a good thing no one else saw it," said Munson. "Mr. Barney, for
  instance, or Miss June."</p>

  <p>"It made no difference," answered Betty.</p>

  <p>"Then someone else did see it?"</p>

  <p>"Miss June saw the whole thing," Betty announced.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have heard what she said to Mr. Dan." Munson's laugh as he
  made this observation was just a trifle off key.</p>

  <p>"She didn't say a word, Mr. Munson, not a word. She and Mr. Dan just stood
  there looking at each other, and I remember he kept shaking his head slowly
  from side to side."</p>

  <p>"Then what happened, Betty?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing happened," replied Betty. "Mr. Dan just went on to his room, and
  Miss June stood looking at Miss Emily-Jane's door with the strangest
  expressionin her eyes. She just stood there staring at that door, and then
  she went to her room. I wouldn't want anybody to look at me the way she
  looked at that door."</p>

  <p>As the two men walked back through the orchard, Munson turned to
  Bennett.</p>

  <p>"Had Betty realized what she was saying," remarked Munson, "she would
  rather have had her tongue cut out than to have said it."</p>

  <p>But Bennett did not answer. He was thinking over what Betty had just told
  them, and he did not envy Munson his successful solution of the murder.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; THE BREAKING POINT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SAM STOUGHTEN was sweating. Munson was sweating him. It was
  a cool evening. A fresh breeze fingered the curtains at the open windows and
  searched through the room. Yet Sam's pale face in the lamp-light glistened
  with perspiration. Scott Munson, sitting idly in front of him, resembled some
  weird, sinister visitant from outer darkness. All his life-forces seemed to
  be concentrated in his eyes. Relaxed in his chair, he sat without moving. All
  power and energy had deserted his body and streamed upward to his eyes and to
  the brain behind those eyes.</p>

  <p>For three hours now this thing had been going on. Munson patient and
  probing, bitter at times, mocking, cruel and unscrupulous. Then, suddenly,
  bewilderingly, another Munson&mdash;subtle, kind, almost sympathetic. Sam was
  unable to understand it. These swift changes confused him, upset the unstable
  balance of his already weary mind. For three miasmal hours the very core of
  his being had been alternately lashed and bullied by the tongue and eyes of
  this man who sat so untiringly before him. But Sam had not yet been broken.
  Stubborn, rebellious, and deathly sick, his stomach nauseated and his brain a
  ball of aching lead, he still stuck to his guns. He would not tell. No human
  being would ever torture from his lips the story of the murder of Emily-Jane.
  He no longer had the power to force his eyes to meet those of his inquisitor.
  However, he could still resist him. No agony of mind or body could make him
  speak, no fear of punishment nor hope of escape.</p>

  <p>Sam sat with lowered head. He was like a spent and blinded bull unable to
  shake off his tormentor. His limp, moist hands were too spiritless now to
  grip the arms of his chair. And all the time he was conscious of Munson's
  eyes watching him. A desire to drive the light forever from those eyes took
  possession of him. It would have to be something sharp&mdash;something thin
  and sharp and long enough to reach into the brain. Sam would be able to face
  him then to look into his sightless eyes and laugh.</p>

  <p>Munson was speaking now. That voice, always that voice, going on and on
  and on. Would Munson never grow weary of the sound of his own voice? Would he
  never stop asking the same monotonous questions, repeating them over and
  over? Would he never realize all his trickery was lost on Sam? He should know
  by this time that Sam had no intention of answering his damn questions. Why
  didn't he let up and give a fellow a chance to rest, to gather his scattered
  wits and to think things out?</p>

  <p>"Sam," came the calm voice, "in your heart you know that you're going to
  talk before you leave this room. Why not get it over?"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell, Munson." Sam spoke with lowered head. He would not meet those
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sam, think."</p>

  <p>"Go to hell, Munson."</p>

  <p>"Sam!"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell, Munson. Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell."</p>

  <p>Munson cast the lowered head a covert glance of admiration, then his face
  hardened. "You've asked for it, Sam," he said.</p>

  <p>From an inside coat pocket he produced a thin packet of letters. Selecting
  a letter, he opened it and began to read. At Munson's first words a sensation
  of suffocation washed over the huddled figure. His body stiffened in the
  chair, and his hot eyes, filled with shame and self-loathing, darted from
  side to side as if seeking some means of escape. Scott Munson's voice was
  quiet and unhurried. Sam shrank from the words. The girl was dead now. Why
  had she left her past behind her to confront the living? Why had she not
  carried it down into the oblivion of the grave? Surely, she could want no
  more of him.</p>

  <p>Munson had finished the letter and now was opening another one. Sam could
  see from beneath his brows the man's long, slim fingers sliding into the
  envelope. They moved with calculated deliberateness. Like snakes, thought
  Sam, those fingers. Then Munson's voice again, but the words were Sam's words
  and the thoughts were his. Poisoned memories winging about his ears, beating
  their way into his brain. And Munson's voice, steadily sounding on, stripping
  Sam of the last shred of self-esteem as it picked its way fastidiously
  through filth.</p>

  <p>Sam buried his head in his arms and tried not to hear. To drown out the
  words he kept repeating under his breath, "Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to
  hell," but Munson's voice went on, the words still drilled in Sam's ears and
  festered in his brain. Then the reading ceased and Sam heard the faint rustle
  of paper. He waited. Would it all begin again? Yes, Munson was opening
  another letter. Sam's endurance snapped.</p>

  <p>"Damn your soul to hell," he said, getting to his feet and confronting
  Munson. "Must you do that, Munson&mdash;keep hitting a guy below the
  belt?"</p>

  <p>Munson considered him coldly. "Any worse than trying to stab a girl from
  behind a curtain?" he asked, and continued on with the reading.</p>

  <p>"Stop," pleaded Sam. "For God's sake. Don't do it, Scott."</p>

  <p>But Munson's voice kept implacably on until he had read the letter
  through. Then he carefully replaced the letter in the packet, slipped it into
  his inside pocket and sat looking up at Sam with an inscrutable expression in
  his eyes. Sam sank back in his chair. For a blessed moment the room was
  still, then Munson began to speak.</p>

  <p>"You wrote those letters, Sam," he said, "and later you made a cowardly
  attempt to stab in the back the girl to whom they were written. You did that,
  Sam. I have the knife with your finger-prints on it. You had the motive and
  the opportunity. And there's the letter about the kid in college. I can see
  pretty clearly what happened. but it might not be so clear to a jury. I could
  charge you right now with attempted murder if not something a damn sight more
  serious. Now listen, Sam." Munson leaned forward in his chair and forced the
  other's attention. "Have you any idea what that would mean? It would mean
  that those letters would pass into the hands of some jury. Your own defense
  would read them&mdash;Sue. Reporters would read them, mouth over them,
  chuckle over them, parts of those letters would find their way into every
  paper in this country. Millions of eyes would be looking&mdash;reading your
  letters, Sam. In railway trains commuters would be passing remarks back and
  forth about them. `Hot stuff, Bill!' `Say, listen to this.' Your name and
  Emily-Jane's would be forever linked, and Sue's life pretty much smeared. Get
  me, Sam? That's just a part of the picture. I'm not laying it on thick
  either. You're intelligent enough to know that. And all because you stupidly
  refuse to speak. Think it over, Sam. Your silence is helping no one,
  protecting no one. Just the opposite. It's doing a hell of a lot of harm." He
  reached in his pocket and brought out the letters. "Sam," he went on in a
  matter-of-fact voice, "I'll give you these letters if you will tell me what I
  want to know. What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>This time the silence lasted several minutes. Once Sam reached blindly for
  the letters, then slowly withdrew his hand. God, how he wanted to do it ! The
  picture that Munson had partially painted danced before his eyes. He could
  hear people talking, whispering, and chuckling obscenely, as they read the
  papers in public places. Munson was not playing fair. He had no right to
  place a man in such a position. Then Sam thought of Sue. He saw her hurt,
  bewildered face. At this thought his anger surged within him, and he faced
  his enemy.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell, Munson," he said, stedfastly keeping his eyes off the
  extended packet of letters. "You can disgrace me, arrest me, and do any damn
  thing you please, but you can't lick me. Keep your damn letters."</p>

  <p>He covered his face with his hands and tried to muffle the choking sound's
  which in spite of his efforts broke from his lips. Munson rose slowly from
  his chair and stood looking down at the stooped figure. For the first time in
  his life he felt himself defeated. Yet, as he stood there looking at Sam, a
  strange expression came to his eyes&mdash;a mixture of approval and
  regret.</p>

  <p>"All right, Sam," he said, his voice sounding unexpectedly natural and
  sincere. "I'll give you these letters anyway. You've earned them, but I'm
  very much afraid you're sending your best friend to inevitable death... and
  it's not so nice to die, Sam."</p>

  <p>He tossed the packet to the floor between Sam's feet and, crossing the
  room, quietly closed the door be-hind him. For a few seconds Sam looked
  uncomprehendingly at the letters. What was that Munson had just said?
  Something about death&mdash;death and Daniel "it's not nice to die." And he,
  Sam, was sending his own friend to his death. Munson had sounded in earnest.
  No tricks this time. Suddenly Sam seized the letters and hurried down the
  room. In the hall he met Sue. She was just coming up to bed.</p>

  <p>"What did Scott want with you?" she asked, half fearful and half
  suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much," lied Sam, cupping the letters in his hand as well as he
  could. "He just loves to hear himself talk. Did you happen to see where he
  went?"</p>

  <p>"He's in his lair," she said, then placing a hand on his arm, added a
  trifle timidly: "You're not looking at all well, Sam. I hope you'll manage to
  get yourself back to a non-lying basis soon. She paused and looked into her
  husband's eyes. They seemed so world-weary and harassed. "Tell him to go
  away, Sam," she added, and in spite of himself Sam smiled.</p>

  <p>"That's just what I've been doing," he replied. "All night long I've been
  telling him. I even named the place."</p>

  <p>Munson was standing at the window with his back to the door when Sam burst
  into the room without stopping even to knock. The man at the window swung
  about sharply, then stood facing his visitor, a question in his eyes. They
  studied each other silently. Sam seemed to have nothing to say.</p>

  <p>"Well?" inquired Munson. "Aren't the letters all there?"</p>

  <p>"You can have them back, Scott," said Sam huskily, and he extended the
  letters. "If they'll help Dan you can have them."</p>

  <p>"They won't help Daniel," said Munson. "You're the only one who can do
  that ... and you refuse. For that I now tell you to go to hell."</p>

  <p>He deliberately turned his back on Sam and continued to stare out of the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Listen," went on the voice behind him. "I'll tell now. What you said
  about Dan... got me . .. I won't hold out any more. Listen, Scott, do you
  want to hear?"</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Munson, "and take it easy. You've fought like a fool
  tonight. If I were in your place I'd burn those letters up." He turned from
  the window and, going to the closet, produced a bottle of whisky. "Here," he
  continued, handing Sam a drink. "Swallow that down and give me those letters.
  We'll burn them now before I change my mind."</p>

  <p>He struck a match to a bundle of newspapers in the fireplace and carefully
  distributed the letters among the flames. Together they watched them burn,
  and for the first time in weeks a feeling of freedom stirred in Sam's heart.
  For some reason he felt cleaner.</p>

  <p>"Well, that little chapter in Emily-Jane's life will never be read again,"
  Munson remarked, as he pulverized the ashes. "Let's get this over, Sam."</p>

  <p>"God, how I hate doing this," muttered Sam. "It's going to be even worse
  than I thought."</p>

  <p>"And it might be even worse than that," replied Munson, "if you don't come
  clean."</p>

  <p>Sam started abruptly as if afraid to give himself any more time to
  think.</p>

  <p>"You're right about the knife," he began. "I wanted to kill her. I wanted
  to kill her, Scott, for several reasons&mdash;for myself, for Daniel, for
  Barney, for all of us nearly&mdash;Sue and June. I feel that the person who
  did it was a public benefactor. You see she wouldn't give up, wouldn't listen
  to reason. That afternoon Daniel had pleaded with her in her room. He offered
  her a pile of money. She laughed at him. She even tried to vamp him then and
  there. After that I knew she was going to die. I knew it, Scott. I saw it in
  Daniel's eyes. But somehow I didn't want him to be the one to do it. I wanted
  it done, but I didn't want Dan to do it. See what I mean?"</p>

  <p>Munson nodded sympathetically. "A tough situation," he said, "I can see
  it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," continued Sam. "It was tough. So, I decided to do it myself, and
  I'd have succeeded if they hadn't moved after the lights went out."</p>

  <p>"You nearly succeeded in killing Dan," Munson observed.</p>

  <p>"The very one I wanted to help most," Sam went on regretfully. "Scott, you
  might not believe me, but I'm sorry right now I didn't succeed in killing
  Emily-Jane that time."</p>

  <p>"I would have had you behind the bars within fifteen minutes, and you'd
  never have come out alive, Sam."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would have been the better way," he answered dispiritedly. "It
  couldn't be worse than it is now. Well, that clears up that part of it,
  anyway. When I went into the dining-room I had it all doped out. I knew the
  exact fold in the curtain. I picked up the knife from the table and switched
  off the lights. Then I felt for the fold and stabbed. When the signal came
  for the lights, I was back again at the switch."</p>

  <p>"In the eyes of whatever God there is I dare say you're as much of a
  murderer, Sam, as the person who actually did succeed."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm even worse." Sam spoke with conviction. "My motives were
  more selfish. When I saw Dan's arm that night, I became even more determined
  to go through with the thing. I thought he was out of commission, and that
  put it up to me. And Daniel knew I had tried to stab Emily-Jane. He told me
  not to be a damn fool. For the rest of the night I watched her. When she went
  down the Cliff Path with Lane Holt, I followed them. Oh, I gave them plenty
  of time. and kept well out of the way. I was still hooded, too. When I got to
  High Point Rock I crouched down in some bushes and waited. I don't know how
  long it was&mdash;more than ten minutes, anyway. And I didn't quite know what
  I was going to do, but of course, the place naturally suggested one thing. By
  that time I was all prepared to push them both off if Holt put up a fight.
  Then they strolled into view and stood near the edge of the rock. They were
  laughing and drinking and mixing it up."</p>

  <p>"Did you suspect anyone else's presence?" asked Munson.</p>

  <p>"An army might have been encamped right behind me, and I wouldn't have
  known it. I was too busy thinking and watching and nerving myself for that
  short, quick dash."</p>

  <p>Once more Munson nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then a thing happened, Scott," Sam resumed, "that spoiled all my plans
  and scared me stiff for a moment. Another hooded figure broke from the bushes
  and made for the pair at the edge of the rock. I started to follow. Got well
  out in the open, then stopped in my tracks. Emily-Jane had gone over. I saw
  her go. So, I backed into the bushes again, feeling pretty sick."</p>

  <p>Sam stopped as if he had finished his story and looked hopefully into
  Munson's hard, scornful eyes. No hope there. Sam lowered his gaze.</p>

  <p>"Give the unimportant details, Sam," said Munson. "Those ashes in there
  bear witness to my good faith."</p>

  <p>Sam gulped and the color slowly left his face. Once more his face and
  hands grew moist.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Scott? That's just what I saw."</p>

  <p>"You know damn well what I mean. Who was the man--that second figure?"</p>

  <p>"Daniel." The name came with a gasp.</p>

  <p>"Then you saw him?"</p>

  <p>"I recognized him right off. Later I saw his face. It was after Holt ran
  away. I saw Dan's face. There was moonlight on it." Sam stopped and a shudder
  ran through his body. "He was suffering, Scott," he added simply. "Suffering
  there alone. It was as much as I could do to keep from going to him, but I
  knew he wouldn't want me then."</p>

  <p>Munson rose from his chair and walked to the window.</p>

  <p>"Much obliged," he said with his back to Sam. "I'm glad you got that off
  your chest. Then you're morally certain that Dan did it, eh? I knew all
  along, but I needed your story. You see, if I can get him to make a
  confession, I'll be able to spare the lot of you no end of scandal and
  publicity. It will be better for Dan in the end."</p>

  <p>Munson stretched wearily and turned yawning from the window. Sara remained
  in his chair. His eyes were filled with trouble. He was breathing
  rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Sam," continued Scott, "it's about time we hit the hay. It's been a devil
  of a strain on you, and you don't look any too damn well. But you'll sleep
  better tonight with a clean conscience and those letters out of the way."</p>

  <p>Sam looked at him dully and gave a short mirthless laugh. "I'm going," he
  said. "Give me a drink first."</p>

  <p>Munson poured him a drink and stood watching him as he gulped it down. The
  empty glass fell to the floor with a little crash. Sam sprang to his feet and
  faced Munson. His eyes were in torment, pierced with utter misery.</p>

  <p>"That isn't all, Scott," he said in a low voice. "I saw something
  else."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did," replied Munson casually. "What?"</p>

  <p>"A hand," Sam whispered. "It slipped over the edge of the cliff and
  clutched Emily-Jane by the ankle."</p>

  <p>"Was it a man's hand, Sam?"</p>

  <p>Sam shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Right hand or left?"</p>

  <p>"Left, Scott."</p>

  <p>"And was there a ring on it&mdash;a large solitaire?"</p>

  <p>"Let me go, Scott. I've told you enough."</p>

  <p>"You saw it?"</p>

  <p>Sam bowed his head and walked unsteadily to the door. For a moment their
  eyes met, but neither man spoke. There was nothing left to say.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">XIX. &mdash; THE FACE IN THE PICTURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MUNSON stood there looking wearily at the door. It had been
  a fight&mdash;a tough one. Scott felt that it had been a fight. He felt it as
  much spiritually as he did physically. The fact that he had won brought him
  scant elation. To the contrary. He was now faced with a situation he would
  have gone a long way to avoid. God, what a case! What a mess of misdirected
  loyalty and idealism ! And to what good end? He shrugged his shoulders and
  turned from the door.</p>

  <p>This time when he stretched his long frame and indulged in a yawn it was
  honestly. There was no strain for an effect. He was tired&mdash;fed up with
  himself and with humanity in general.</p>

  <p>"I don't know the oriental mind," he mused, "but damn if these people
  aren't all Chinese to me. Still there's something terribly human about them.
  A generous murder. Now who in hell ever heard of a paradox like that?"</p>

  <p>The fact that his night's work was not yet over made him feel even more
  weary. Longingly he eyed his bed. One of the most all around satisfactory
  beds in which he had ever slept. From the bed his eyes traveled to his easy
  chair. He felt himself longing for this source of comfort and repose. Then
  his gaze sought the table on which stood the bottle of whisky.</p>

  <p>"Damn if I have to long for that," he muttered with a faint smile. "That's
  one thing I can do at least."</p>

  <p>He did. He was even lavish about it, which was unusual for Scott
  Munson.</p>

  <p>"Might get myself drunk for a couple of months,"` he reflected. "Just stay
  drunk and go dotty and forget who I am. That would be one way out."</p>

  <p>He finished his drink and left the room abruptly. No answer was
  forthcoming to his knock on Barney's door. He turned the knob and entered.
  When he switched on the lights he received a start. The wreck of a small male
  creature was sitting up in bed. Out of two vaguely inquiring eyes it regarded
  Munson. Young Barney had selected for his sleeping attire a tattered,
  paint-smeared smock. This, together with his casually straying hair and his
  lined face, gave him the appearance of an exceedingly ancient infant.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to wear that thing to bed for?" demanded Munson in a
  tone of disgust.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't find my tops and I can't stand bottoms," said Barney
  cryptically. "Can you stand bottoms, Scott?"</p>

  <p>"If you are referring to pajamas," replied Munson, "it's purely a personal
  matter. Only God and myself know the answer."</p>

  <p>"How about Betty?" came the surprising inquiry. "You seem to be forever
  chasing her about. I don't think it's nice. For a man of your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And for a person who never seems to be looking at anything," cut in
  Munson, "you seem to be able to observe one hell of a lot. And your mind,
  Barney, is about as evil as your eye."</p>

  <p>"That's the usual detective's line," replied Barney, "and it doesn't help
  at all about the tops. If you'll believe it, that drawer over there is just
  bursting with bottoms&mdash;practically new bottoms&mdash;and there's not one
  top among them. Aunt Matty used to supply me with tops, but she's off me now
  on account of that picture. Anyway, what does it matter to you whether I
  sleep in my bare skin or in a suit of armor?"</p>

  <p>"You can sleep in a dress suit so far as I am concerned," replied Munson,
  sitting down near the bed and suddenly becoming grave. "It's about that
  painting of yours that I want to talk. Like Aunt Matty, I'm off you, too,
  Barney. I'm off you because of that damn picture and the way you're treating
  Daniel. Somehow it's not like you, Barney, and it's rotten. Daniel needs you
  now. He's always stood by you."</p>

  <p>A strange look came into Barney's eyes, but he remained silent.</p>

  <p>"But," continued Munson, "I'm not going to tell you why you're all wrong.
  You're going to find that out for yourself. Then you'll just have to believe.
  And it's not going to be easy, Barney. It's going to hurt like hell... knock
  down your house of cards and scatter your beautiful dreams."</p>

  <p>Munson paused for a moment. When he resumed speaking his voice was
  unusually gentle.</p>

  <p>"But I won't mind hurting you, Barney," he said, "if it will only help you
  to see the truth, which in this sad affair is more beautiful and more
  terrible than any dreams your brain will ever weave. I won't mind hurting you
  if it will bring you back to Daniel, who for your sake has made a sacrifice
  even greater than death itself. I won't mind hurting you, Barney, if it will
  help you to see through the maze of stupidity and despair clouding this
  case&mdash;to see behind it all the essential love and loyalty of the thing.
  I tell you frankly that during all the years of my dealings with misguided
  humanity I have never encountered such a poignantly sorrowful situation."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Scott," said Barney. "I don't mind being hurt either. Most of my
  life I've been pretty much sat on, but I never minded before because Daniel .
  . well, you see, Daniel was always around. He used to be a big help in the
  old days."</p>

  <p>Barney stopped speaking and sat staring into space. Munson knew that
  memories were stealing back from the past. He could almost feel their
  presence in the room.</p>

  <p>"You know, Scott," continued Barney in a low voice, "sometimes I watch
  kids and wonder if any of them are as decent as Dan must have been when he
  was their age. Without anyone knowing it much, he must have been a remarkable
  youngster fearless, generous, and understanding." Barney smiled rather
  sheepishly at Munson and added, "He was awfully damn good to me, Scott."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Munson, "for the sake of the old days are you willing to find
  out the truth now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Scott, if it will help any."</p>

  <p>"And you'll take it like a man?"</p>

  <p>Barney slowly nodded. "I'll take my medicine," he replied with a faint
  smile. "I've been in a gray murk lately, but when you took Dan away that day,
  I received a bit of a shock. Since then I've been asking myself a few
  questions."</p>

  <p>"I'm still in a gray murk," replied Munson, producing one of the letters
  Emily-Jane had written to Daniel and extending it to Barney. "Do you
  recognize that handwriting?"</p>

  <p>Once more Barney nodded, and this time his face was white. "Emily-Jane
  wrote that to him," he said, as if speaking to himself. "It must have been
  years ago."</p>

  <p>"It was," replied Munson. "All you heed to do is to skip through it. Then
  think of Daniel and the situation he was in&mdash;and he wasn't alone either.
  I'll be back in about ten minutes."</p>

  <p>Barney made no answer as Munson rose and left the room, His eyes were
  fixed on the letter, and the hand that held it was shaking so violently that
  he was forced to clamp it between his knees.</p>

  <p>When Munson returned to the room some fifteen minutes later, Barney was
  sitting up in bed, in the same position, but the letter had fallen from his
  hand. A change had come over his face. During Munson's absence young Barney
  had grown fast. The eyes that greeted Munson were no longer vague and
  visionary. They were alert, confident, and at the same time disconcertingly
  unfathomable. Only a slight tenseness around the corners of his mouth gave
  evidence of the strong control he was exerting over his emotions.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Scott," he said in a calm voice. "I have pictured the whole
  situation. Why didn't Daniel show me this before-before it happened?"</p>

  <p>"There were other letters," Munson replied. "Sam's. She had them and she
  was going to use them."</p>

  <p>"What a mess," mused Barney. "And a creature so utterly lovely... God's
  mind must have been straying." His voice trailed off into silence, and he sat
  there with his chin on his knees.</p>

  <p>"But Daniel should have shown you that letter," came Munson's voice. "That
  would have been the sane and rational thing to do... only people don't do the
  sane and rational things. He wanted to spare you, Barney."</p>

  <p>"He knows my old weakness, Scott," said Barney. "I'm a great dodger of
  facts. If I don't like a fact I alter it to suit my own ideas. If I can't
  alter it, I ignore it&mdash;banish it from my mind. I've never been a great
  hand at lifting up my voice and declaiming about the hard facts of life, its
  grimness, its realness, and all that jargon. From the first time a baby falls
  down on its nose it begins to know about the hard facts of life and its
  grimness. What I've always tried to do is to ungrim life a little, and to do
  that successfully, one must be pretty clever at self-deception."</p>

  <p>He paused and considered Scott Munson thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you've noticed that I've never asked you any questions about
  this case. Apparently I've been indifferent. But I haven't. I haven't wanted
  to know. I've been dodging facts and making up facts&mdash;false ones-of my
  own. And all the time I've been painting that picture a question has been
  buzzing round in the back of my mind, Scott. I was afraid of the answer. I
  didn't want to know why Emily-Jane was out with Lane Holt at that time of
  night. So I just kept on painting. The more I painted the angrier I became,
  until finally the thing fastened on me like an obsession. I only knew that a
  beautiful thing had been snatched out of my life ... the most beautiful thing
  that had ever come into it. That beauty had been denied me and I wanted to
  make someone else suffer. God help me. I picked on Dan. Now that I look back
  on it all, I can see that she never really cared for me. Little incidents
  stand out&mdash;things I refused to admit at the time. I couldn' talk to
  anyone else like this, Scott, not even to Daniel. Beauty must have made me
  drunk and now&mdash;oh, well, I sobered up to find a lot of facts that can be
  neither altered nor dismissed. I'll just have to face them, Scott, that's
  all. I must think about Dan. How do things stand with him?"</p>

  <p>"Not so good, Barney," said Munson slowly.</p>

  <p>"God. What a tragic jam," mused Barney. "There seems to be no way out and
  I'm responsible for it all."</p>

  <p>"The situation was," replied Munson. "You were merely a part of it."</p>

  <p>"I know. I know," said Barney. "That doesn't help any, Scott."</p>

  <p>Munson rose and Barney handed him the letter. "I wish you could destroy
  it," he said, "but I suppose it's a bit of evidence. We must all of us lose
  our dreams now."</p>

  <p>"Nothing else you want to know, Barney?" asked Munson, slipping the letter
  into his pocket. He was frankly puzzled by Barney's attitude, his baffling
  mixture of common sense and visionary ideas. He was puzzled and at the same
  time pleased.</p>

  <p>"No, Scott," Barney replied. "I owe you a lot as it is. Don't tell Dan I
  know."</p>

  <p>When Munson had left, Barney lay back on his pillows and looked
  sightlessly up at the ceiling. Presently two glistening drops gathered in his
  eyes and trembled there until they broke from his lashes. That was all... two
  tears for Emily-Jane, or, rather, for what Emily-Jane had meant to
  him.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Several hours later he rose and, dressing about as
carefully as he ever
  did, went quickly downstairs. All quiet in the old house. Dawn was trembling
  on the fringe of night. From the hall he collected his easel and painting
  equipment and staggered with them to his brother's study, the first room to
  catch the light. The noise this occasioned aroused the shadowing instincts of
  Officer Red. Breathing heavily, he creaked down the corridor in the wake of
  Barney. Between them they made the night lively with sound. To such an
  extent, in fact, that Officer Shad awoke and dogged the heels of Red.</p>

  <p>Both officers stood peering into the study. Some minutes passed.</p>

  <p>"You might as well get the hell out of here," said Barney, without
  troubling to turn around. "Those faces of yours behind me give me the creeps.
  Take them away."</p>

  <p>Whereupon the faces, wearing a slightly injured look, were withdrawn. It
  didn't matter about Mr. Bar-</p>

  <p>ney. Too bad, though. A nice young man like that going clean off his
  head.</p>

  <p>While Crewe House slept Barney sat before his easel. Occasionally he rose
  and going out to the veranda, studied the eastern sky. And when at last the
  comfortable old study was filled with the light of a new day, Barney took up
  his brushes and began to paint with swift, sure strokes.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Munson returned to his room and quite willingly accepted
the invitation of
  his easy chair by the window. Barney had not proved difficult. A surprising
  character.</p>

  <p>Scott had wanted to see Daniel but he did not feel up to it now.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he called, as a knock sounded on the door.</p>

  <p>Daniel came quietly into the room. At the sight of the thin, lined face
  and the eyes sunken from watching too many long nights through, Munson felt a
  trifle downed. He wanted to escape from the room.</p>

  <p>"Want a drink, Dan?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I do," said Dan, pouring out a drink and tossing it off. "I did.
  Badly."</p>

  <p>Seating himself on the bed, he looked silently at Munson. "Almost over
  now?" Dan asked.</p>

  <p>"Almost, Dan."</p>

  <p>"What are you waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"For the most natural thing in the world."</p>

  <p>"Meaning what?"</p>

  <p>"For someone to say something, Dan. I've had a talk with Sam."</p>

  <p>"Did he say something?"</p>

  <p>"More than enough."</p>

  <p>Daniel rose from the bed. "Then that pretty well leaves it up to me," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Munson. "And to me, also."</p>

  <p>Daniel walked to the door. "I'm glad it's all over, Scott. It will
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I said almost over," interrupted Munson.</p>

  <p>"Almost over," Daniel corrected himself. "Don't feel too low about it,
  Scott. It started out to be a rather decent summer. I'll talk to you in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"We'll have to go through with it then," replied Munson. "Sam isn't all
  clear yet."</p>

  <p>He hated himself for the lie, but it was necessary to play these people
  against each other. And Munson knew how to play them.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The sun was well up when Daniel opened his eyes. He had
slept deeply and
  forgotten something. What was it? Oh, hell, yes. Scott had said they would
  have to go through with it today. Well, here was today. Daniel was ready for
  it. As he rolled from his bed a thrill of excitement ran through him. No more
  skulking now. That was all over. He would make a confession and Scott would
  do the rest. And the yacht? Too bad. He tried not to think of the yacht.
  "Keep on fighting," June had said. To what good end that? Scott still thought
  that Sam was involved. His mind must be disabused. No need to make too many
  people suffer needlessly. There would be enough.</p>

  <p>He bathed and dressed quickly and went downstairs. He would have liked to
  see Barney just then, but Barney was not to be seen. Perhaps things could be
  patched up, now that Daniel was going away.</p>

  <p>He wandered about the lawn as if seeing the place for the last time. He
  kept telling himself that this could not be so, but deep down in his heart he
  knew that when he took that ride with Munson or Bennett he would never return
  to his old home again. Crewe House would see the last of him.</p>

  <p>Look, trees, look! Here comes your old friend. Take a good look at him now
  before he goes away. He. used to climb you once. Remember? The two little
  boys? No more climbing now. Daniel has become a murderer. He murdered a
  beautiful girl, and now he, too, must die.</p>

  <p>Daniel shivered and went down to the beach. For a while he stood idly
  tossing stones into the water. Not such bad sport, that. There was quite a
  knack in skimming stones. Better than being locked behind bars. Oh, hell
  !</p>

  <p>Daniel turned from the beach and looked in at the boathouse. There were
  the canoes and there was Barney's crazy motorboat. Daniel recalled the first
  ride he had ever taken in it. It had also been his last. Only Barney knew how
  to make the engine work, and at times it failed even Barney.</p>

  <p>Daniel returned to the lawn and sought his study. At the door he stopped
  suddenly, his eyes transfixed. Bowed and motionless Barney was sitting before
  the canvas, and the picture was finished. Daniel saw himself standing at the
  edge of the cliff and behind his head the yellow moonlight radiated like a
  nimbus. His arms were outspread and from his left hand blood was dripping.
  And the face was not the face of a murderer. All the pain of suffering
  humanity seemed to be centered there. Tenderness and deep regret looked out
  of the deep-set eyes.</p>

  <p>The minutes passed unheeded as Daniel studied the painting and the
  intention of the painter. A wave of relief and thankfulness swept over
  Daniel. Unconsciously a deep sigh escaped his lips. Barney looked up and met
  the gaze of his brother. Daniel nodded silently.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said quietly, "I did it, Barney."</p>

  <p>"I know, Dan. Forgive me&mdash;" and Barney knelt at his brother's
  feet.</p>

  <p>Daniel put his hand on Barney's head. "I'm going to confess, Barney."</p>

  <p>"Don't, Dan. Don't!"</p>

  <p>In Barney's excited imagination he saw what lay ahead for Daniel... the
  trial and humiliation of it all, then the waiting alone in a cell, and
  finally Daniel in the chair. Good God, that couldn't be! His brother, Dan,
  alone and convulsed in death. His arms went up to Daniel, to this man who had
  always stood for the fine things of life, the decent, generous things.</p>

  <p>"Don't, Dan," he repeated.</p>

  <p>Silence a moment, then "Is it all right with you, Barney?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dan, and you?"</p>

  <p>"It's always been all right with me, kid. We've had a tough
  break&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>He stood with his hand on his brother's head, and his face was the face in
  the picture. His eyes were filled with pain and infinite tenderness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">XX. &mdash; ALL THE WORLD AND PLACES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the library June Lansing sat facing Scott Munson. Her
  eyes were alert and filled with expectancy. Munson's were those of a tired
  and none too happy man.</p>

  <p>"June," he began, "I want to talk over this case with you. Something has
  to happen today. Things can't continue like this. We've been stalling long
  enough."</p>

  <p>June leaned back in her chair and considered her cigarette. "Yes, Scott,"
  she said. "What comes next?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Munson hesitatingly, "I thought you might have something
  to say."</p>

  <p>"And I thought that was your job, Scott," June coolly observed.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Munson, "but&mdash;well, I had a long talk with Sam last
  night and he had lots to say. Daniel is going to talk this morning.... You
  see, June, the case is about closed."</p>

  <p>"Then why string it out, Scott?" June smiled and lighted another
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I have some things," Munson explained. "This for example. It was hidden
  in the pantry, June."</p>

  <p>He held up the black domino, which he had taken from the table.</p>

  <p>"And then there's this buckle," he continued. "It was found in the sand
  near the rocks. It sort of worries me, June... this thing taken together with
  what Sam saw that night, your hand with that solitaire on it, and no end of
  other stuff. Did you hold on with your right hand and pull with your left,
  June?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said June, her poise never deserting her. "It was safer. The ledge,
  as you know, is narrow at that point."</p>

  <p>Munson thoughtfully studied the girl's face. She was pale but collected,
  and for the first time he detected an expression of pain in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, June," he said gently.</p>

  <p>June laughed shortly and rose from the chair. For several minutes she
  paced the room restlessly.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Scott?" she repeated at last, turning suddenly and confronting
  Munson. "Where can you find the word? There is no word. No form of speech can
  express the sorrow and horror I've been carrying round in my heart. I did the
  thing. Let's get that straight. I did it because I couldn't let Dan do it. I
  took that frightful stigma on myself because Dan&mdash;Scott, Dan is too fine
  for a thing like that. In time I was going to let him know&mdash;let you all
  know, but I still had hope. I still thought we might get away somewhere. It
  was murder, Scott, but it wasn't such a terrible murder. I am weak enough to
  regret it though. Day and night it is in my eyes, in my thoughts, gnawing at
  my mind. But I couldn't let Dan do it... I couldn't let him do it. We were
  all mad that night."</p>

  <p>She sank to a chair and buried her face in her hands. Little convulsive
  shivers ran through her body. Munson rose and, crossing over to her, placed a
  hand on her shoulder. For some time they remained thus in the silence of the
  great, dim room.</p>

  <p>"I read one of her letters to him," she resumed, her head still in her
  hands, her eyes fixed on the carpet. "Then I knew what all the trouble was
  about. After the dance she told me she had a date for a little walk in the
  moonlight."</p>

  <p>"Why did she tell you that?"</p>

  <p>"Because I pretended I had one, too, and she was warning me to keep away
  from High Point Rock. She thought I was like herself&mdash;a cheat. I think
  she almost liked me then. A girl like her gets lonely unless she has someone
  of her kind about her. I took the domino and got down to the ledge long
  before anyone else had started. I thought I lost that buckle somewhere along
  the way. All evening it had been giving me trouble, but I never knew just
  where it fell off. I waited on the ledge, Scott, waited a long time, and then
  the thing happened. Everyone who comes to High Point Rock halts at that spot
  or close to it at some time or other. I knew they would come and I waited.
  Those minutes will be with me all my life. You know the rest. Sam must have
  seen. In the confusion of the scuffle above my head I reached up and gripped
  her ankle... I pulled her over the edge of the cliff and she almost struck me
  as she fell. I heard her strike. It came to me through the darkness. Oh, God,
  oh, God, that sound!" She paused and looked up at Munson. "I'd beaten Dan to
  it," she added, "but at the peace of my own soul if I have such a thing. Is
  that enough, Scott?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, June," he answered. "I'm afraid the case is closed."</p>

  <p>"It's a God-damned lie." Daniel's words cut sharply across the silence of
  the room. "It's impossible&mdash;stupid."</p>

  <p>Munson and June turned quickly to see the two brothers standing in the
  doorway. Daniel strode across the room and pulled June roughly to her feet.
  Then he took her in his arms and held her fiercely to him.</p>

  <p>"Scott, it's a damned lot of nonsense," he said, looking at Munson over
  June's shoulders. "I did it and you've all along known I did.
  Barney&mdash;everyone knows. This girl here is out of her mind. Shut up,
  June"&mdash; and Daniel shook her vigorously, then once more gathered her in
  his arms.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid June is right," replied Munson. "You see, Daniel, I can prove
  it."</p>

  <p>For a moment Daniel's faculties were atrophied. He could hardly realize
  the fact that he was not an actual murderer. His whole world was changed by
  this new development. But he was not relieved. He was afraid for June. She
  was in danger. This, at the moment, was all he knew. June was in danger. Now
  he would have to fight. Barney crossed the room and placed a timid hand on
  June's arm. He, too, seemed bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Then, I'm morally responsible," said Daniel. "I tried to do it, I wanted
  to do it, and I planned to do it. If June did do the thing it was I who drove
  her to it."</p>

  <p>"I killed her because I wanted to," broke in June "No one drove me to
  it."</p>

  <p>"You keep quiet," said Daniel, holding her even closer.</p>

  <p>"Do you loathe me, Barney?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Barney bent over and kissed a part of her nose, "I'm thinking," he
  whispered. "Hold tight, old girl."</p>

  <p>"Morally responsible, yes," replied Munson, "but I can't arrest you on
  that. June actually did it and inasmuch as there was no conspiracy between
  you, June is guilty of murder in the eyes of the law. And it's the law with
  which we have to deal. Both you and Sam are potential murderers. Both of you
  tried to murder Emily-Jane, but the fact remains that you didn't do it. You
  failed and now June must&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But, my God, Scott," cut in Daniel, "can't something be done? You're not
  going to arrest June for the murder of Emily-Jane?"</p>

  <p>"What else can I do?" asked Scott, with a helpless shrug of his
  shoulders,</p>

  <p>"Take me," said Daniel. "You can prove a charge against me without any
  trouble. I'll offer no defense."</p>

  <p>"I'm not looking for a victim just for the fun of it," replied Munson
  rather bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Scott," put in Barney, "if you'll go over there in the corner and
  count one hundred I'll guarantee to save everybody a lot of trouble."</p>

  <p>For some minutes Munson paced the floor lost in thought. June raised her
  head and watched him.</p>

  <p>"Keep fighting, Dan," she whispered. "We're not licked yet. I feel
  it."</p>

  <p>"Wish I had a gun," muttered Barney. "I'd shoot him in the legs."</p>

  <p>"This is what I'm going to do," said Munson, stopping in front of the
  little group. "I'm going to motor to New Haven and parley with the district
  attorney. I don't know what will come of it, but I'll try to make things as
  easy as I can for you, June. Daniel, you and Sam had better come along with
  me, so that June won't have too many allies to get her into trouble. June, I
  suggest that you stay on the veranda as much as possible where my staff can
  keep an eye on you. Consider yourself under arrest."</p>

  <p>He left the room and hurried upstairs. The moment he was gone Daniel
  turned to Barney.</p>

  <p>"It's up to you, Barney," he said. "Get in touch with Manning and dope out
  a scheme with him. Mention the yacht. June shouldn't be here when we get
  back. Lay the staff low if necessary. And work quick, Barney. I'll delay
  Scott as long as I can."</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking," replied Barney, "thinking deeply."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget the yacht," continued Dan, hurriedly. "It's our one best
  bet. And get June out of the way."</p>

  <p>"I'm still thinking," was all Barney said.</p>

  <p>"Ready?" called Munson from the door. The Shays stood behind him. They
  were regarding June with sorrowful eyes.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Barney had thought to some purpose. No sooner had the car
containing
  Munson, Sam, and Daniel driven off than he was calling up Manning. This
  excellent man received the news calmly.</p>

  <p>"From six o'clock on tomorrow morning," he told Barney, "there'll be a
  sea-going yacht hanging round Singing Reef. Try like hell to pick us up
  there. We'll be waiting&mdash;that is, the yacht will."</p>

  <p>Barney then called up Sally Brent and made known his needs. Sally was only
  too willing to meet them. Barney could have her motorboat or anything else he
  wanted. The warmth of Barney's gratitude brought a faint flush to the cheeks
  of the small young lady at the other end of the wire.</p>

  <p>Barney's next call was a New Haven number&mdash;another girl friend.
  Marion Wilson would be quite willing to lie for Barney. At seven o'clock
  tomorrow morning she would call up and say that June had arrived in a state
  of nervous exhaustion. Yes, she understood perfectly. All set.</p>

  <p>Leaving the library, Barney hurried to the beach and got his motorboat
  into the water. Soon he was chugging vibratingly toward the islands. As a
  result of this trip, Pete Clark began to move with incredible rapidity. He
  left the rocks and went about his affairs. Barney returned to the beach and
  did a surprising thing. He took a heavy sock from his pocket and packed it
  with sand. Later, when Pete came strolling through the orchard, Barney
  unobtrusively put him in possession of the sand-filled sock. Barney was still
  thinking. He hurried up to June's room and carefully packed two traveling
  bags. He included even mules and a rather seductive pajama outfit. All the
  bright things he put in, for in his heart he knew that even if he succeeded
  there still would be many sad days dawning for June.</p>

  <p>When Barney descended to the veranda the Shays were keeping solicitous
  eyes on June Lansing. He procured his easel and set it up in front of one of
  the French windows opening into the library. Then he wandered up to the
  Shays. They made no protest when he offered to paint their pictures. June
  made this possible by agreeing to sit close by. Barney placed his subjects in
  the French windows and began the serious business of making the Shays
  immortal. He painted swiftly and honestly, and presently the Shays began to
  appear on the canvas. After ten minutes of steady work, he arrested his
  flying brush and asked the officers to elevate their chins a little more
  proudly. As they did so, Pete Clark silently rose up behind them and smote
  Officer Shad delicately but sufficiently upon the head with the sock Barney
  had so providentially packed with sand. Officer Red, turning to ascertain the
  reason for his associate's sudden collapse, received a similar blow. Pete
  then quietly withdrew with the sock, and Barney hurried upstairs for the
  bags. June was waiting in the hall to relieve him of one of these. Together
  they hurried to the back of the house where Aunt Matty and Sue were waiting
  to say good-by. There was no time for words. It was a silent departure. June
  was crying softly as she hurried through the orchard. Aunt Matty was holding
  a conference with the servants from which they dispersed with sealed
  lips.</p>

  <p>At the border of the salt marshes Barney suddenly disappeared into a hole
  from which June had to extricate him. The suitcase had opened and most of its
  intimate contents lay on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Are you helping me to escape or am I helping you?" demanded June.</p>

  <p>"It's sort of an <i>entente cordiale</i>," replied Barney, helping her to
  repack the bag.</p>

  <p>At the opening of a small creek, Pete was placidly waiting for them in the
  flattest of flat-bottomed skiffs. June stepped in and Barney passed the bags
  to her.</p>

  <p>"They'll never find her, Mr. Barney," declared Pete. "Never in the world.
  I'm taking her to my last resort. Have Mr. Dan down here tonight. I'll be
  waiting."</p>

  <p>June said nothing as the skiff moved off. She merely looked back at Barney
  and bit her under lip.</p>

  <p>When Barney had once more seated himself in the chair, the Shays were
  about to return to their normal state of mental obtuseness.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" asked Officer Shad.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied Barney innocently. "I thought you fell asleep."</p>

  <p>Officer Red tenderly felt the top of his head. "No," he declared. "No. It
  couldn't have been that ... not just that."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Munson on his return was not a happy man, and the Shays
were even less so.
  On learning of the disappearance of June, Scott had immediately called up
  Headquarters and got in touch with Bennett.</p>

  <p>"Get out here as fast as you can," he told him. "The Shays are
  hopeless."</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that both Shad and Red stoutly exonerated Barney,
  pointing out the utter impossibility of his having had anything to do with
  June's escape, Munson regarded that cheerful young man with suspicion and
  distrust.</p>

  <p>Munson felt that the absence of June Lansing was not so serious. She would
  not be able to get far. All arteries of escape were being watched. It would
  be impossible for her to make a complete getaway. Nevertheless it was
  annoying. Things looked bad enough for June as they were. This little
  escapade was not going to help at all. Yet in his heart he did not blame her.
  Had he been in her place he would have done the same thing. He did not even
  take the trouble to make inquiries, knowing the hopelessness of trying to
  battle against the loyalty of Crewe House.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At two o'clock that night Daniel used the old tree outside
his window for
  the last time. At the edge of the salt marshes Pete Clark was patiently
  waiting for him. Daniel stepped into the skiff and was silently carried out
  across the marshes. The reeds hid the skiff, and the channel twisted between
  high banks. Presently they came to a small island&mdash;a mere scrap of earth
  surrounded by mud and stagnant water. In the darkness, Pete miraculously
  guided Daniel along a narrow path. Daniel was mud to the hips.</p>

  <p>There was a low shed in the bushes, and it was here that Daniel found
  June. She was fighting mosquitoes and smoking cigarettes. For a moment he
  held the disheveled figure in his arms, then he, too, turned his attention to
  the mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>"Think we'll get away with it?" asked June. "We have so far," replied
  Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Didn't believe it was in Barney," she continued.</p>

  <p>"You never can tell what's in Barney," said Daniel. "He's always been a
  bit amazing to me."</p>

  <p>June edged closer to Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Dan," she said rather haltingly, "do you feel anydifferently toward me
  now that you know I'm a&mdash;that I killed Emily-Jane?"</p>

  <p>"How could I, June?"</p>

  <p>"You don't feel that I'm stained sort of?"</p>

  <p>"Far from it."</p>

  <p>"But I do, Dan." Her sad eyes looked out into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"We were both in it, old thing. Don't feel like that." Pete appeared with
  a pot of hot coffee.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock that morning, Barney was called to the telephone. Marion
  Wilson was on the wire. Munson followed Barney into the room and stood
  suspiciously at his elbow.</p>

  <p>"You say she's there?" said Barney into the transmitter.</p>

  <p>"Yes," came the mendacious reply. "In bed. Her nerves seem to have gone to
  pieces."</p>

  <p>"Hell!" replied Barney. "Hold the wire, Marion." He turned to the waiting
  Munson. "She says that June's just drifted in and they've put her to bed."
  Munson took the telephone and questioned the girl closely. "Don't let her out
  of your sight until I get there," he told her. "I'm coming right now."</p>

  <p>"Want me to go with you?" asked Barney. "She might need a friendly
  face."</p>

  <p>"I want no one to go with me," snapped Scott. "I'm damn well sick of you
  all."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," said Barney humbly.</p>

  <p>When Scott had gone Barney had an extremely private interview with Aunt
  Matty. As a result of this little talk three rather questionable cups of
  coffee were expeditiously brewed. They contained most of the tablets Dr.
  Manning had left for Daniel on the night of the dance. Aunt Matty painted the
  lily by adding several drops of this and that to the mixture&mdash;strong
  drugs long secreted in her own private medicine chest.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later when she offered this concoction to Bennett and the
  two Shays with her own fair hands, the officers of the law could hardly
  refuse, especially when they saw Barney and Sam Stoughten gulping down their
  coffee with every indication of relish.</p>

  <p>"I guess we all need something in these sad times," the old lady said,
  with a deep but hypocritical sigh.</p>

  <p>There is no getting away from the fact that the officers were most
  potently doped. And strange to say, Bennett was the first to go. He was found
  sleeping peacefully in a chair on the veranda. Officers Shad and Red speedily
  emulated his example. Then Barney executed his master stroke.</p>

  <p>With the aid of Sam he carried the sleeping men to the beach and placed
  them comfortably as possible in his temperamental motorboat. A modest supply
  of food and water followed them. The remaining room was taken up with an
  extra supply of gasoline. These preparations completed, Barney lashed the
  wheel and brought the engine to life. Soon the little motorboat with its
  three unconscious passengers became a rapidly diminishing speck against the
  blue.</p>

  <p>"Suppose the boat capsizes and the three of them drown?" asked Sam,
  unhelpfully. "What then?"</p>

  <p>Barney ran a hand through his disorderly, straw-colored hair. "I don't
  know exactly what then," he admitted. "It would be a great pity, but nobody
  has anything on us."</p>

  <p>Barney next resorted to his bicycle and pedaled rapidly to Sally Brent's
  sumptuous home. That young lady was ready and waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"It's all tuned up," she announced.</p>

  <p>"So am I," said Barney, stepping into her long, rakish-looking motorboat.
  "You wait here for me, Sally. I'll take a walk with you then."</p>

  <p>"All right, Barney," said little Sally Brent. "I'll wait right here."</p>

  <p>Barney swept out on the Sound for a few miles, then brought the boat
  sharply about and followed the coast line. In the distance he saw his own
  home standing comfortably back among the trees. In a few minutes he rounded
  High Point Rock, and once more he changed the course of the boat. This time
  he drove for the shore, to a narrow channel opening into the salt marshes.
  Here among the reeds Pete with June and Daniel were waiting in the skiff. The
  transfer was rapidly made, Pete suitably rewarded, and the motor-boat headed
  for Singing Reef with June at the wheel. Daniel came aft and sat by
  Barney.</p>

  <p>"Well, old fox face," he said, making an effort to be cheerful. "Why don't
  you come along with us?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Barney, "I've a date to go walking with Sally, and, anyway, I
  have to return her boat."</p>

  <p>"But you'll join us soon?"</p>

  <p>"Just as soon as I've perfected a little scheme I've been working
  out."</p>

  <p>"What scheme's that, Barney?"</p>

  <p>"I'm learning how to count my chickens before they're hatched."</p>

  <p>"How's that?" asked Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Well," began Barney, "I'm a little reluctant to talk about it until I'm
  sure I'm right. You might laugh at me."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, Barney."</p>

  <p>"It's really quite simple," said Barney. "The most important thing is to
  get to know a lot of chickens."</p>

  <p>"Sort of gain their confidence?" Daniel suggested.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," replied Barney, his face lighting up. "You get those chickens
  to place implicit trust in you. Then you stick around while they are laying
  their eggs, after which you stroll up quite casually and borrow the
  eggs."</p>

  <p>"I think I see it all," said Daniel.</p>

  <p>"I knew you would," replied Barney. "Well, when you've lured the eggs away
  from the chickens you find something or someone to throw them at&mdash;some
  enemy or creditor or just a casual passer-by. And there you are."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean, there we are?" demanded Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Just that. There you are. You can't go wrong. No eggs, no chickens. The
  answer is zero. It works out every time."</p>

  <p>"Pretty tough on the hens," observed Daniel. "Don't you ever pay them
  back?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Barney. "You buy 'em another rooster. After that I'm going in
  for bull-baiting."</p>

  <p>"Sounds interesting. How do you do that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you put a worm on the end of a bull's nose," began Barney. "Then
  you push him off the end of a pier and the fish in snapping at the worm bite
  the bull on the nose."</p>

  <p>"I should think the bull would be furious," put in Daniel.</p>

  <p>"He is," said Barney. "And humiliated, too."</p>

  <p>Before Barney could go on any more about the bull, they had passed Singing
  Reef and were circling round a large, handsomely designed yacht with runaway-
  looking lines. On the stern they made out a freshly painted name.</p>

  <p>No time for bull-baiting now. Barney took the wheeland brought the
  motorboat neatly alongside the yacht. Two handclasps and it was all over.
  Ready hands assisted June and Daniel aboard. The luggage followed.</p>

  <p>Daniel and June were leaning over the rail as Barney sheered off.</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Barney," called Daniel. "God bless you, boy."</p>

  <p>"I'll follow you, Dan," called the small figure in the motorboat.
  "Wherever you are, I'll follow you. Just let me know."</p>

  <p>June tried to speak, to call back a last word to Barney. Her voice broke
  and she held out both her hands in farewell.</p>

  <p>The yacht got under way, and Barney turned to face a lonely sea. It had
  never been so lonely, he thought, so utterly bereft of life and interest. He
  turned his head and looked back at the rapidly vanishing yacht.</p>

  <p>"So long, Dan," he whispered. "It won't be long. We'll get together
  soon.</p>

  <p>True to her word, Sally was waiting for him in the same spot. She looked
  as if she had not even moved. At first she appeared as a small speck in the
  distance, and when Barney drew into the slip by which she stood she did not
  appear much larger.</p>

  <p>For a long time they walked in silence, then presently they joined hands
  and Barney began to talk. Sally Brent listened with the wisdom of her
  sex.</p>

  <p>When they reached Crewe House, Scott Munson was sitting on the veranda. As
  he watched them approach, a strange expression came into his eyes. It would
  have been difficult to tell at that moment the nature of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Scott," said Barney.</p>

  <p>"Out of my sight," replied Munson. "What have you done with Bennett and
  the Shays?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Scott," said Barney. "Do I look as if I could do away
  with three able-bodied men?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Scott, "but someone has."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they got tired of waiting for you and just went home."</p>

  <p>"Who was responsible for that fake telephone call this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Search me," said Barney.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to hang you," said Scott.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That night Barney sat on the veranda and wondered about
June and Daniel. A
  few chairs away Munson was smoking moodily. Well on their way to the sea,
  June and Daniel were leaning over the rail of the flying yacht and wondering
  about Barney. Their thoughts must have passed on the water. Manning was not
  with them. He was walking across the lawn of Crewe House and approaching
  Barney's chair.</p>

  <p>"May I come along when you go?" he asked, his voice sounding hushed in the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>Barney placed his hand on the back of Manning's. "We'll go together," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Later they were joined by Sam and Sue, but still the place seemed
  empty.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next morning Munson received a furious long-distance
call from New
  York City.</p>

  <p>"This is Bennett," that officer mouthed, "and I'm in New York. The Shays
  are with me and they're driving me mad."</p>

  <p>"But why did you want to rush off to New York?" asked Munson, in his
  mildest voice.</p>

  <p>Strange animal-like noises at the other end of the wire greeted this
  question.</p>

  <p>"We didn't want to," Munson at last made out. There seemed to be tears in
  Bennett's voice. "We were doped and dumped into a half-witted motorboat and
  sent out unconscious across the Sound. When we came to we didn't know where
  we were. Later a Sound steamer picked us up and landed us at New York."</p>

  <p>Munson sat back and considered the telephone. His face was a study in
  conflicting emotions.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that, Mr. Munson?" Bennett's voice demanded.</p>

  <p>"Remarkably neat," replied Munson. "Never heard of anything quite like
  it."</p>

  <p>"Ruthless, I call it," said the other. "The work of a cold-blooded
  criminal."</p>

  <p>"Who doped you, Bennett?"</p>

  <p>"That old devil you call Aunt Matty."</p>

  <p>"What!" Munson sat up in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Thought you'd be surprised," came Bennett's voice. "Yes. She's the snake
  in the grass. Put the bracelets on her, Mr. Munson. Arrest everybody. They're
  all in it."</p>

  <p>Munson's eyes reflected the hopelessness of the situation. "I'm afraid
  they are," he answered. "In fact, I suspect the entire neighborhood. We can't
  arrest all of them."</p>

  <p>"But what are we going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know, Bennett. I'll admit I'm stumped. I know this,
  though&mdash;in the future I'm going to confine my efforts to the
  professionally criminal class. Amateurs are too erratic for me."</p>

  <p>"Same here," replied Bennett earnestly. "I guess I better be getting the
  Shays back home."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Munson. "Bring them along."</p>

  <p>He hung up and sat looking at the telephone. Slowly, reluctantly, a smile
  gathered at the corners of his lips. This facial manifestation finally
  crystallized in a grin of sheer enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"Put the three of them in a boat and sent them off on their own," he
  mused. "My God, what a thing to do. And the old lady's in it&mdash;up to her
  ears. They're all in it&mdash;more than I even suspect."</p>

  <p>Slowly he rose from the chair.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm licked," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21">XXI. &mdash; REUNION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONE year later two small, untidy, and exceedingly
  incompetent- looking individuals alighted from the wrong train at the Swiss
  lake resort of Montreux. Many bags surrounded them, and at these they looked
  as if seeing them for the first time. The female member of this team
  proceeded to count the bags.</p>

  <p>"I forget whether there were six or seven," she said.</p>

  <p>"I never knew," replied Barney, then added cheerfully, "We've quite a lot
  at any rate."</p>

  <p>After bumping into each other several times in their efforts to get
  started they finally managed to go in the same direction at the same time.
  One hour later they had reached the hotel that was only ten minutes' distance
  from their original point of departure. This was exceptionally good time for
  them. They considered themselves in luck.</p>

  <p>At the hotel they at last induced someone to take them to the suite of
  rooms occupied by June and Daniel. Here they were warmly received. June had
  grown graver and more womanly. There was a suggestion of humility in her eyes
  and a world of under-standing. Even about Daniel there lingered traces of the
  tragedy through which he had passed.</p>

  <p>Barney and Sally Brent sat down very close together and looked about
  them.</p>

  <p>"It's nice here," said Sally. "Nicer than Paris."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Barney. "She thinks we lost a bag."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Daniel comfortingly. "We'll get that for you. I
  can't believe you're here."</p>

  <p>"We are," replied Barney. "We eloped."</p>

  <p>"And we're not married yet," added Sally, as though mentioning a fact of
  relatively minor importance.</p>

  <p>"What !" exclaimed Daniel. "Not married. How's that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see we were awfully busy," began Barney.</p>

  <p>"And in New York we didn't know just how to go about it," Sally helped
  out.</p>

  <p>"And by that time we'd gotten started," put in her teammate.</p>

  <p>"Started?" demanded Daniel. "How do you mean, started?"</p>

  <p>"Everything," replied Barney simply, and Sally nodded her head.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you get the captain to marry you on the way over?" Daniel
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"We didn't think of it for a couple of days, then it didn't seem to us as
  if it would be very nice," Barney explained.</p>

  <p>Daniel turned to June for help. She had sunk to a couch and was laughing
  silently but desperately. Tears were running down her face.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Daniel, turning back to the expectant pair. "We'll have to
  fix that up, too. And without further delay."</p>

  <p>Barney's face brightened. "I kept telling Sally you'd see about everything
  when we got here," he said. "I never was any good about details."</p>

  <p>"Do you call getting married a detail?" asked Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Barney, "compared with all the rest of it."</p>

  <p>"Where's Manning?"</p>

  <p>"He'll be along later. Said he had some business to transact with a
  baroness or something."</p>

  <p>"A nice lot, the three of you," observed Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Barney. "The three of us are all right. Munson's in Paris.
  He sent you this." Daniel took the hastily written note and read:</p>

  <p class="letter">To the both of you&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">After your sneaking departure Betty and Tom became so
  indignant that they swore out two statements and gave them to the district
  attorney. They seemed sufficient to satisfy him, and so the case is
  officially closed. He attributes June's confession to an attempt to extricate
  Daniel from an unfortunate set of circumstances. I can do nothing to change
  his mind. The law is no longer interested in either one of you, but I am. Why
  not join me this winter in Egypt? We could do well there.</p>

  <p class="letter">Affectionately, SCOTT MUNSON.</p>

  <p>"I'll show this to you later," Daniel said to June. "Munson says
  everything is all right." He put the letter into his pocket and once more
  considered the pair. "I suppose you'd like a drink," he observed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Barney.</p>

  <p>"Could I have some ice-cream?" asked Sally. "Peach ice-cream,
  perhaps?"</p>

  <p>Daniel smiled and June looked somewhat shyly at Sally. "Do you want to
  come over here, Sally?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Evidently Sally did. June took her in her arms. "Sure, kid," she said,
  "you can have all the ice-cream you want."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'd like to wash up a bit," Daniel suggested.</p>

  <p>"Do we have to do that now?" asked Barney.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," replied Daniel. "It's merely customary, that's all."</p>

  <p>Sitting on the terrace overlooking the lake, the four of them did things
  about drinks and ices. Sally was extremely happy.</p>

  <p>"I'll paint that brute of a mountain," declared Barney, waving a hand at
  the Dent du Midi.</p>

  <p>"I guess it will be able to stand it," observed Daniel. "Everybody paints
  that."</p>

  <p>"But not the way I'm going to paint it," said Barney. "When I've finished
  with that mountain it won't recognize itself."</p>

  <p>"That," said Daniel, "is barely possible."</p>

  <p>June's eyes were fixed on the mountain, but she was seeing High Point
  Rock. Barney's arrival had brought so many things back to mind. Then she
  smiled upon Sally Brent, who was whole-heartedly sucking a spoon.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you'll like it here with us?" asked June.</p>

  <p>"It's wonderful," said Sally. "We'll all stick together, June."</p>

  <p>"And you two will damn well get married right off," put in Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Barney. "You fix us up."</p>

  <p>Later, when Manning arrived, it was discovered that he had brought the
  baroness with him. She was charming. They were still transacting business, it
  seemed, the exact nature of which was never quite disclosed.</p>
