A MILLION POUNDS</h2>

<p>One fine spring morning Peter Kerrigan was strolling casually
along the Euston Road in the direction of King's Cross. He saw a
small man in a black felt hat coming towards him in a great hurry.
The next moment a loiterer, who had been leaning against the rails
and staring at the sky, lurched forward and bumped awkwardly into
the small man and picked his pocket. Kerrigan, who took an interest
in everything connected with his fellow-creatures, could not help
admiring the dexterity with which the lounger had extracted the
leather wallet and slipped it into his own coat-pocket. The next
moment Kerrigan himself bumped awkwardly into the lounger, neatly
removed the stolen wallet and, after many profuse apologies, turned
round and walked briskly after the little man in the black felt
hat.</p>

<p>It was all done on the spur of the moment. There was no
particular reason for going out of his way to befriend a total
stranger, except that Kerrigan was in a mood of general benevolence
towards mankind. It was a lovely morning; he had backed three
winners the day before; the state of his exchequer was prosperous
owing to an amazing run on the red at a select little club off
Grosvenor Square a few weeks earlier; he was wearing a new suit;
and there was no pastime he enjoyed so much as stealing from
thieves. "It's not that I do it on high moral grounds," he used to
explain, "but simply because thieves never prosecute."</p>

<p>So when he saw the unfortunate little man being robbed of his
wallet, the temptation to recapture the swag was irresistible.</p>

<p>Whistling as gaily as any butcher's boy, Kerrigan marched along
in the wake of the owner of the swag, and after they had turned a
couple of corners he felt that it would be quite safe to examine
the contents of the wallet. There was always a chance that it might
contain a thousand pounds or the Koh-i-noor diamond; on the other
hand, the seedy little man, who was in such a hurry, hardly looked
the type that carries riches about with him.</p>

<p>The wallet contained no money, but only a miscellaneous
collection of used-up railway tickets, bus tickets, a card of
admission to the Reading-Room of the British Museum made out in the
name of Harrison Hone, a photograph or two, and a letter dated six
weeks earlier. The words "a million pounds" caught Kerrigan's eye
as he was about to put the letter back, and he immediately unfolded
it and read it. It ran:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Harry,&mdash;This is written in great
haste. A wonderful thing has happened to me, and before long I
shall be worth at least a million pounds. You may hear strange
things about me in the near future, but do not worry. I shall be
all right, and when I have completed the transaction we will both
be immensely rich men. And then what times we'll have. And what
books we'll buy. And what drinks we'll drink. Give my love to Hilda
and my nephews.<br>
<br>
&mdash;Yours affectionately,<br>
John.<br>
<br>
"P.S.&mdash;'Go, bid the soldiers shoot,' eh, old chap?"</p>

<p>Kerrigan whistled. "Worth a million pounds," he murmured. "This
is a matter which needs investigating. I wonder why he wants the
soldiers to shoot. Never mind, I'll find that out later."</p>

<p>He quickened his stride till he overtook the man in front, and
then, bowing politely, he remarked, "Your wallet, sir, I
think?"</p>

<p>The little man turned round and blinked rapidly at Kerrigan, and
then at the wallet, and finally said, with a little stammer:</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much indeed. Yes, it's
mine. I must have dropped it. Thank you."</p>

<p>"Please don't mention it," replied Kerrigan affably, "I hope
nothing of value has dropped out of it."</p>

<p>"There is nothing of value in it, I'm afraid," replied the other
with a frank smile that Kerrigan rather liked. It converted the
man's face in a moment from being nervous, harassed, and
middle-aged into an almost schoolboyish simplicity and candour. The
next moment the smile vanished from under the brown, straggly
moustache, and the careworn expression came back.</p>

<p>"But all the same," he went on, "I'm very grateful to you for
your kindness." He put the wallet back into his breast pocket,
murmuring something about "wondering how on earth he had managed to
do such a foolish thing," and then held out a thin, bony hand.
Kerrigan had to think rapidly. Another instant, and it would have
been the end of the interview. And he was interested in that
million pounds. He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"What do you say to celebrating the recovery of your property
with a little beer?" he inquired. "It is past half-past eleven; the
taverns are open; a little judicious purchase of ale would harm
neither of us, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Not for me, I thank you all the same," replied the other
nervously. "The truth is, that I very rarely indulge in alcohol.
Indeed I may say that I am practically a total abstainer."</p>

<p>"Very well. You drink milk and I'll support the Trade. Come
on."</p>

<p>The little man hesitated and then said:</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. But it is only fair to tell you that
I&mdash;er&mdash;unfortunately left all my money on the
piano&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Kerrigan, "I'm full up to the ears with
cash. Come along. I never ordered milk before in a tavern, but we
live and learn. I wonder if they'll try to throw me out. It will be
a novel experience."</p>

<p>He led his still hesitating companion into an adjacent
public-house, and with a mixture of easy courtesy and familiarity
accosted the brilliant damsel who presided at the counter.</p>

<p>"A very good morning to you, mademoiselle, and perhaps you would
oblige me with a large can of ale and, if you stock such a
commodity, a glass of milk. You stock it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. A glass for my friend here, and," he lowered his
voice, winked, and jerked his head almost imperceptibly towards his
companion, "slip a spot of Jamaica into it."</p>

<p>The damsel was as experienced as she was brilliant, and Kerrigan
convoyed his new friend to a table in the corner of the room and
set down in front of him a large glass of rum and milk. The
practically total abstainer took a large and hasty gulp at the milk
and broke into a violent paroxysm of coughing which lasted for
almost a minute. The brilliant lady laughed openly, and winked at
Kerrigan, who returned the greeting with expert rapidity.</p>

<p>"What curious milk," the little man succeeded in saying at last,
"it tastes all queer and hot."</p>

<p>"It's the Pasteur treatment," replied Kerrigan. "They use it in
all public-houses nowadays."</p>

<p>"I had no idea of that," said the other doubtfully. "I used to
study Pasteurisation a good deal in the old days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all changed since then," interrupted Kerrigan hastily.
"This is the very latest thing."</p>

<p>"It certainly has an attractive taste. But I think it requires
to be sipped rather than taken in draughts."</p>

<p>"That's right. Stick to sips and you can't go wrong. And now to
business, Mr. Hone."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;what business? And how do you know my
name?" The little man looked round wildly. Possibly vague
recollections of having read stories about people being decoyed
into public-houses by strangers and then robbed and even murdered,
flashed through his mind.</p>

<p>Kerrigan lowered his voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>"Have you heard from John?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hone started so abruptly that some of his Pasteurised milk
was upset on the table.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "I wish to God I had." Then he made a pathetic
effort to pull himself together, and went on. "I'm afraid I don't
know what you're talking about. And&mdash;er&mdash;if you don't
mind, I think I'd better be moving on now. I'm in rather a
hurry."</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan assumed an air of portentous seriousness and
said, "I'm on your side."</p>

<p>The little man gazed at him forlornly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;" he began, and then stopped.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Kerrigan, "I mean all that and a bit more. I know
a good deal more about John than you think."</p>

<p>"Then do you know where he is now?" wailed Mr. Hone. "He's been
away for six weeks, and I'm getting so anxious about him."</p>

<p>"Six weeks! Is it as long as that? I shouldn't have thought it
was more than four."</p>

<p>"It was six weeks yesterday."</p>

<p>"And not a word from him?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. Not a line. Not even a telegram."</p>

<p>Kerrigan whistled.</p>

<p>"Not even a telegram. That's bad," he observed, shaking his
head. "That's very bad."</p>

<p>"I'm so afraid he may have done something foolish," said Mr.
Hone in a despairing voice. "John was always the reckless one of
the family. And when I got his letter&mdash;" He broke off again
and peered suspiciously at Kerrigan.</p>

<p>The latter nodded reassuringly and said:</p>

<p>"The one about the million pounds. Yes, I know. Go on."</p>

<p>But Mr. Hone was obviously very far from being reassured. The
Pasteurised milk was mounting to his head, and was beginning to
endow him with a fair amount of truculence. He looked rather like a
mildly pugnacious rabbit.</p>

<p>"How do you know about it?" he demanded. "What do you know about
it? Who are you, anyway? I don't even know your name."</p>

<p>"My name is Carkeek," replied Kerrigan without hesitation. "I am
a private inquiry agent."</p>

<p>"But why should you inquire, even privately, into my brother's
affairs?"</p>

<p>"Because I am representing an interested party," answered Mr.
Carkeek. "Some one," he added, "whose name I cannot divulge. But I
can assure you it is a man of the very highest standing."</p>

<p>This puzzled Mr. Hone, and his truculence gave way to a petulant
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"It's all very mysterious," he announced, "and very tiresome.
Six weeks ago I don't suppose there were two quieter or more placid
lives being led in the whole of England than mine and my brother's.
I was at work at my lectures, and he was at work in his library.
And now my brother has vanished in search of a million pounds, and
I'm all of a muddle. Do you know, Mr. Carkeek," he concluded with
desperate earnestness, "I'm even beginning to lose the thread of
some of my lectures. Lectures, mind you, that I've been giving word
for word for the last fifteen years. If it goes on like this, I
shall be getting into trouble. Perhaps even getting the sack. And
then where should I be, with a wife and two small boys to
support?"</p>

<p>Kerrigan signed to the brilliant lady for another pair of drinks
and answered cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll be able to support them on your share of the million
pounds."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what to do," murmured the little man with a
wistful sigh. "I ought to do something, but I don't know what. I'm
so&mdash;so unused to this sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Why not tell me the whole story?"</p>

<p>"There isn't anything to tell. My brother has vanished. And I
don't know what to do about finding him. I don't even know if I
ought to do anything. My brother is very peculiar. He is liable to
fits of very bad temper. He is very unlike me in many ways."</p>

<p>"Where has your brother vanished from?"</p>

<p>"From where he was working."</p>

<p>"And where was that?"</p>

<p>But the rabbit was becoming pugnacious again. Mr. Hone drained
off his glass and stood up.</p>

<p>"I'm going now," he observed a trifle thickly. "Thank you very
much for your hospitality. Your most kind hospitality&mdash;and
your most kind return to me of my pocket-book. Greatly obliged to
you, Mr. Carkeek. Good-bye ol' fellow. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Kerrigan saw that nothing more was to be learnt about the
disappearing brother and the million pounds, so he shook hands with
the slightly inebriated lecturer, watched him depart a little
unsteadily, and then followed him unobtrusively to a shabby house
in the shabby lane off Gower Street, Bloomsbury, into which Mr.
Hone admitted himself with a fumbling latch-key.</p>

<h2 id='ch2'>II<br>
MURDER AT THE MANOR</h2>

<p>Peter Kerrigan was a young gentleman of about thirty-five who
had lived by his wits since the early age of eleven. His father had
been a good-looking, fascinating Irish waster, who had left
Connemara for the good of Connemara late one night in a violent
hurry, to the public annoyance and secret relief of the Royal Irish
Constabulary which had always had a soft side for Terence Kerrigan.
From Liverpool to Glasgow, and from Glasgow to New York, and from
New York back to Hamburg, and from Hamburg to Petersburg, had been
the outline of Terence Kerrigan's travels, until in about 1892 he
married a beautiful Latvian girl and settled down to live in the
neighbourhood of the docks of Riga. The result of the marriage was
the one son, Peter, who played with the riff-raff of the waterside
and learnt to swear fluently in twelve languages. Terence Kerrigan
found vodka very much to his liking, and gradually discovered that
he could live on a pennyworth of bread to an intolerable deal of
it. His friends and acquaintances also discovered that vodka
increased the natural fieriness of his Irish temper, and brawls
became an everyday occurrence in the Irishman's life. Finally, when
Peter was eleven years old, Terence and the beautiful Latvian Mrs.
Kerrigan were both killed in a violent stabbing affray in a
dockside tavern in Riga. For the next eight years the lad supported
himself, in various ways&mdash;some legal, some dubious, and some
unquestionably illegal. On the outbreak of war, he happened to find
himself in London and enlisted in an Irish infantry regiment. His
peculiar talents and his fluency in languages, his repertoire of
which had by now risen from twelve to eighteen, soon became so
evident even to British Major-Generals (and if a thing is evident
to a British Major-General it is probable that it is evident to
other people as well) that he was transferred to the Intelligence
Branch and dispatched to the fringe of Scandinavia nearest to
Germany. From there he drifted to Russia, Siberia, Persia,
Caucasia, Asia Minor, and Syria, and was the hero of many exploits
and escapades, both creditable and discreditable, before the
signature of the Peace Treaties sent him back to his civilian
pursuits. By the time he was thirty-five he had acquired a very
considerable knowledge of the ways of the world. He had learnt his
way about the shady quarters of a good many large cities, and he
collected an almost unequalled circle of shady acquaintances. If he
had been given to boasting, which he was not, he could have boasted
truthfully that he was personally known to a corrupt politician, a
corrupt policeman, and a corrupt magistrate in three-quarters of
the capitals of Europe. He was famous in the underworld of many
countries for his openhanded generosity, his loyalty to friends,
his versatile method of gaining a livelihood, his free-lance
independence of gangs, organisations, bosses, and vendettas, and he
was universally respected for his remarkable skill in taking care
of himself.</p>

<p>He was about five feet ten inches tall, with square shoulders
and long arms; his hair was brown and curly and his eyes blue.</p>

<p>After following the nervous but stimulated lecturer to the house
off Gower Street, Peter Kerrigan made a note of the address, hailed
a taxi, and drove home to lunch. Home, at this period in the
adventurer's career, was a flat in Grosvenor House; funds being
plentiful, he was doing himself luxuriously. As he drove, and
afterwards as he lunched, he considered the affairs of Mr. Hone and
his vanished brother. The question to be answered was, "Is it worth
while following the matter up?" If Kerrigan had been hard up, he
would not have dreamt of wasting five minutes over such a vague,
nebulous business. But, situated as he was, with a comfortable
nest-egg tucked away in the Grosvenor House branch of the
Westminster Bank, and time being no object, it was just possible
that a little diversion might be obtained from an investigation
into the mysterious absence of the hot-tempered librarian. It all
hinged on that phrase about the million pounds. Was it to be taken
literally or was it a figure of speech? Did it mean, "I have a
business deal on hand which will result in my netting the sum of
one million golden sovereigns, which, carefully invested, will
produce a yearly income of fifty thousand golden sovereigns?" Or
did it mean, "I've a chance of making some money which will make me
into a regular millionaire compared with what I've been making so
far?" If the former was the correct version, then the matter was
well worth investigating. Peter Kerrigan's ambition in life was to
lay his fingers on a pile sufficiently large for him to be able to
cut all the dubious and all the definitely illegal branches of his
activities. And a good slice out of a million pounds would do the
trick nicely.</p>

<p>But if the second version was correct, then the game was not
worth twopence. Kerrigan had no idea of the amount of salary a
librarian was likely to earn&mdash;he had, indeed, only the vaguest
idea of what a librarian did, or why librarians existed at
all&mdash;but he was fairly certain that a few hundreds would make
a librarian feel like a millionaire. And he was not interested in
hundreds. The librarian and his lecturing brother could keep them,
so far as he was concerned. But a million! That was a very
different story. By the time Kerrigan had reached the Stilton
cheese, he had made up his mind to devote a day or two to the
matter.</p>

<p>The first step was comparatively simple. At nine o'clock next
morning, dressed in a shabby blue suit and an old bowler hat, and
carrying a small brown handbag, he repaired to Gower Street and
took up a post at the corner of that intellectual thoroughfare, and
Mr. Hone's dingy lane. His argument was that the lecturer must come
out to deliver his lecture. He surely could not cram the people who
listened to him&mdash;even if they only amounted to a
handful&mdash;into the small house which he had let himself into
the day before. Again, Kerrigan knew very little about lecturers
and their habits, but he felt instinctively that they did not ply
their trade in poky little houses in back streets. His instinct was
right. At twenty minutes past nine Mr. Hone came down the steps of
his house. With one hand he clutched a large flat portfolio, with
the other he tugged nervously at his straggly moustache. He looked
even more careworn and harassed than on the day before. Kerrigan
wondered if two glasses of rum and milk had given him a
headache.</p>

<p>Mr. Hone pattered past the watcher, keeping his eyes firmly
fixed on the ground, and a few minutes later Kerrigan was ringing
the bell of Number Twenty-seven. The lady of the house herself
opened the door. She too bore unmistakably the marks of poverty and
struggle. In happier circumstances she would have been comely, even
pretty, but an incessant battle against adversity had made her
careless of appearances. The mere task of living absorbed all her
energies.</p>

<p>"Gas, Light, and Coke Company, madam," said Kerrigan briskly.
"Meter inspection."</p>

<p>"Our meter was inspected yesterday," replied Mrs. Hone, showing
no disposition to admit the official.</p>

<p>"All the meters in this district were inspected yesterday,"
replied Kerrigan unabashed, "but there was a fire last night at our
office, and all the records were lost. So we've got to do it all
over again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hone gave way before this convincing explanation, coupled
as it was with Kerrigan's most disarming smile, and pointed to the
meter in the passage.</p>

<p>"Very well. There it is."</p>

<p>"We've also to inspect the gas-jets throughout the house,
madam," went on the inspector. "There have been several cases of
serious gas-poisoning lately, owing to faulty jets."</p>

<p>"Is that thrown in free, or do we have to pay extra for it?"</p>

<p>"Thrown in free, madam."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hone's thin features relaxed into a faint smile as she
said:</p>

<p>"Well, that's something anyway," and she stood back for Kerrigan
to enter.</p>

<p>The only room in the house that was of the slightest interest
was the small dining-room which obviously was used as day-nursery,
study, and sitting-room as well. In one corner there was a small
roll-top desk, and Kerrigan, during the couple of minutes in which
he was left alone in the room, glanced hastily at the papers,
letters, envelopes, and memoranda that lay upon it. One envelope
immediately caught his eye, for it was written in the same shaky
scrawl as the letter about the million pounds had been. The writing
was quite unmistakable. Kerrigan stuffed the envelope in his
pocket, and turned to examine the photographs on the mantelpiece.
These consisted either of snapshots or of the ghastly family groups
that were turned out with such pride by the photographers of twenty
and thirty years ago. There was one that interested Peter, for it
was obviously the wedding group of Mr. and Mrs. Hone, and the best
man was simply a larger edition of the bridegroom. As the same
figure appeared in several other groups, and also in several of the
snapshots, and as there was no other man except the lecturer
himself, who appeared more than twice upon the mantelpiece, it was
a fairly safe conclusion that the best man was brother John, the
librarian, with his eyes upon a million pounds. Kerrigan added one
of the snapshots to the envelope in his pocket, and, seeing nothing
else that was likely to be of use to him, left the house.</p>

<p>As soon as he was well away from the neighbourhood of Gower
Street, he pulled the envelope out of his pocket and examined the
post-mark. It was Bicester, and the date, so far as he could
decipher it, seemed to be about two months earlier. The writing
interested him. It was shaky and straggly, and bore the
unmistakable appearance of having been written by a very palsied
hand. At the same time, it was the writing of an educated man. Here
and there were letters which were beautifully formed, and the Greek
"E's" and the bold capitals could never have been written by a
product of the board schools.</p>

<p>"A literary gent who has taken to the bottle," was Kerrigan's
verdict, as he carefully replaced the envelope in his pocket and
signalled to a passing taxi.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of a town called Bicester?" he asked the
driver.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Buckinghamshire. Can't drive you there, sir, without
a fill-up of petrol."</p>

<p>"Can you drive me to the station that would take me there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Paddington."</p>

<p>"Paddington it is then. And first drift round to Grosvenor House
so that I can get the ancestral tails and topper."</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan's knowledge of England was almost exclusively
confined to London and one or two of the seaports. The rural
Midlands were something quite new to him, and he sat in the corner
of his carriage, entranced by the endless succession of green
meadows, flower-laden hedges, and leafy woods. It was so peaceful
and undisturbed, so utterly different to the swift, hard, ruthless
kaleidoscope of men and women and events that he was accustomed
to.</p>

<p>But as the miles were reeled off and, according to the map on
the carriage wall, the train was rapidly approaching Bicester,
Kerrigan began to get puzzled. There was no change in the quiet
countryside. It was still meadows and woods and isolated cottages.
At any moment he expected that the train would plunge into a
seething, swarming, black industrial area. And he kept on hoping
that it would. For this rural placidity was not the sort of
surroundings in which a million pounds could be picked up, nor was
it the sort of place in which business men would be likely to
gather to plan vast secret coups of finance. "You couldn't be
secret in a country like this," he reflected, "every one knows
where every one else is, and what every one else is doing."</p>

<p>And when the train drew up at the almost deserted platform of
Bicester Station, and Peter got out and gazed at the sleepy little
town shimmering in the midday heat, he felt half inclined to take
the next train back to London. Either it was a pure chance that the
letter had been posted at Bicester, on a week-end visit, perhaps,
or on a holiday&mdash;or else the librarian had not meant more than
a few pounds when he so glibly and impressively used the word
"million."</p>

<p>But as it was nearly lunch-time and no trains to London were due
to arrive for a couple of hours, he decided to stroll into the
town, look round, have lunch, show the snapshot to one or two
people on the chance of a lucky recognition, and then if nothing
had happened, to return quietly in the afternoon.</p>

<p>A citizen of the town directed him to the Angel Hotel, as being
a suitable place for a gentleman to obtain a meal, and Peter
Kerrigan strolled, hands in pockets, in that direction. It was a
warm, drowsy day, and Bicester seemed to be rather a drowsy place.
But Kerrigan found it extremely interesting.</p>

<p>It was quite unlike anything he had met in England before. It
was so sleepy and so placid, and yet at the same time so quietly
prosperous in appearance. Nothing had ever happened here and
nothing ever would happen here. That was the impression he got. As
for picking up a million pounds, it was even more fantastic than it
had seemed in the train. Kerrigan smiled at the thought of the
wild-goose chase that had brought him down to the heart of rural
England in search of financial adventure and profit, and the next
moment he turned in to the lounge of the Angel Hotel.</p>

<p>After a few preliminary exchanges on the subject of the crops,
the past hunting season, and the prospects of the next hunting
season, with the landlord, Kerrigan asked casually:</p>

<p>"Did you ever meet a man in these parts called Hone?"</p>

<p>The landlord looked at him queerly and replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, I did meet a man called Hone, and I should like to meet
him again. He owes me three pounds fourteen shillings, and I've
about as much chance of ever seeing that money as I have of flying
to the moon."</p>

<p>"Is that the man?" asked Kerrigan, producing the photograph.</p>

<p>"That's the man," replied the landlord after a brief scrutiny.
Then he looked at Kerrigan knowingly and winked. "I'll lay six to
four that I can guess your profession, sir, if you give me three
shots."</p>

<p>"I'll take you in sixpences," said Kerrigan, who could never
resist a bet.</p>

<p>The landlord leant across the bar and said in a loud stage
whisper, "Bailiff or Detective or Solicitor."</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan saw that he had stumbled on a piece of luck which
ought to be followed up, and he solemnly laid a florin upon the
counter.</p>

<p>"You win," he remarked, "and allow me to tell you that you're a
pretty shrewd chap."</p>

<p>"Pretty shrewd, pretty shrewd," exclaimed the triumphant
landlord. "And which of the three are you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Now you're asking," parried Kerrigan with a laugh; "but
I'll tell you this. If you help me to find Hone, I'll help you to
get your three pounds fourteen shillings back."</p>

<p>"Come right in," said the landlord, opening the door of his
private room.</p>

<p>"This Mr. Hone," he proceeded, when they were comfortably
installed in arm-chairs, "had some sort of job at the big house
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whose big house?"</p>

<p>"Lord Claydon's place, outside Bicester. You've heard of Lord
Claydon's place? It's called Marsh Manor. Never heard of it? Well,
you do surprise me! It's a couple of miles out, on the way to
Aylesbury. It's the biggest place in the district. This man Hone
worked there&mdash;sort of secretary, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Librarian, perhaps."</p>

<p>"It might have been. He looked a learned sort of fellow in some
ways. Wore spectacles and always had a book under his arm. But mind
you, in other ways he looked like a wrong 'un. Drank a lot of
whisky&mdash;that's what he owes the money for&mdash;and had a look
about the eyes as if he'd been at it for some time. Man of fifty or
thereabouts. Shifty expression on his face, if you know what I
mean. Still, he was a good customer. That's why I gave him the
credit. And now he's skipped out and owes me three pounds fourteen.
A real wrong 'un, that's what he's turned out."</p>

<p>"Do you know why he left?"</p>

<p>"Not an idea."</p>

<p>"How long was he there?"</p>

<p>"About eighteen months, I should say."</p>

<p>"Have they got a new man in his place?" inquired Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"I'm told so. But I've not seen him."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know anything about Hone? I mean, what his
plans were, or what he was likely to turn to after he left
here?"</p>

<p>"No. He wasn't a talkative man, even when he'd had a few
drinks."</p>

<p>Kerrigan pondered. The landlord did not seem to know very much
that was of use, except the one fact that Hone had worked for Lord
Claydon. A visit to Marsh Manor seemed to be the next move. The
landlord assured him that Lord Claydon was at home, and as
entertaining a party of friends; he also informed Kerrigan that he
himself was the owner of a car which he hired out at very moderate
charges, and that the hotel had accommodation also at a very
moderate rate in the event of the young detective (or bailiff or
solicitor) wishing to stay the night.</p>

<p>Kerrigan accepted both car and accommodation, and in a few
minutes was driving himself out towards Marsh Manor in an ancient
and rattly Ford.</p>

<p>It was impossible to miss the entrance to the Manor. A wide
semicircle of iron gates was supported on massive pillars of grey
stone and surmounted by a huge coat-of-arms, also in grey stone,
while an ancient half-timbered lodge was hidden behind a couple of
gigantic plane trees. The avenue ran through a grass park for half
a mile and then vanished into an impenetrable screen of woods. The
Manor itself was invisible from the road and only a thin column of
smoke, ascending into the air above the trees, showed that a house
was there at all.</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan drove boldly through the imposing gateway, quite
unawed by its magnificence, and rattled and clanked up to the front
door of the Manor, a large, square, yellow Georgian building. As he
drew up with a piercing shriek from the brakes of the car, he got
an unpleasant surprise which made him hastily alter his plans. He
had intended to announce himself as a detective from Scotland Yard,
but when he saw a policeman standing on the top of the steps which
led up to the door, he decided that this would be a little
indiscreet. He therefore hastily adjusted his outlook to that of a
solicitor, tried to assume a portentously solemn appearance, and
dismounted from the car. The policeman eyed his approach coldly
and, on the top step, interposed his massive person between
Kerrigan and the front door, and inquired his business.</p>

<p>"I am a solicitor," began the young man smoothly, "and I wish to
speak to Lord Claydon for a minute or two."</p>

<p>"If you will give me your card, sir, I will take it in."</p>

<p>Kerrigan, who never travelled without a varied supply of
calling-cards to meet varied emergencies, produced one on which was
printed "Mr. Algernon Phipps, Y201 Albany, London, W.1. Almack's,
Bucks, Boodles." It was not the card he would have selected for a
family solicitor, but he had been taken unawares, and the
production of half a dozen cards and the selection of a suitable
one would have aroused a certain amount of justifiable
suspicion.</p>

<p>The policeman examined it and then handed it to another
policeman who was stationed in the hall. Kerrigan was longing to
know what they were doing at the Manor, but decided not to risk a
direct question. Policemen were apt to resent direct questions.</p>

<p>The next moment the last man in England that he wanted to see
came out of the house, holding the card in his hand. It was
Inspector Fleming, of Scotland Yard, and he and Inspector Fleming
had known each other for a good many years.</p>

<p>The Inspector smiled and held out a hand.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Kerrigan," he said. "Just the sort of place you would go
and turn up in. Half a moment." He turned to the policeman.
"Where's this man Phipps?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There he is, sir."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," intervened Kerrigan blandly, looking over Fleming's
shoulder at the card. "There is a misunderstanding. I see that I
have by mistake sent in the wrong card. How foolish of me!"</p>

<p>"What's the game this time, my lad?" asked the detective with
another smile.</p>

<p>"He said he was a solicitor, sir," put in the policeman with an
aggrieved air. He felt that somehow or other he had been "put upon"
by the plausible stranger.</p>

<p>"When you know this gentleman as well as I do," replied Fleming,
"you'll know that he's capable of saying anything. Come inside,
Kerrigan; I want a word with you." He led the way into a large hall
and drew the young man across to a sofa. "What are you doing here?"
he asked. "I've got a very special reason for wanting to know."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the truth, Fleming," replied Kerrigan after a
moment's hesitation, "and the truth isn't a thing I would tell to
every one."</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure of that," put in Fleming drily.</p>

<p>"Come, come, laddie, none of that. Just concentrate on listening
for a bit. I came down here to discover the whereabouts of a
certain Mr. John Hone, until six weeks ago librarian to the gent
who owns this shack."</p>

<p>"And why did you want to know his whereabouts?"</p>

<p>Again Kerrigan hesitated and finally he said:</p>

<p>"I heard from his brother that he thought he was likely to make
a large sum of money in the near future."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Ah! That's just what I wanted to know."</p>

<p>"You had no idea, Kerrigan?"</p>

<p>"Straight, I hadn't."</p>

<p>"I see. And is that all you can tell me?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely all, Fleming. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't have
worried about the thing at all, because I'd got such vague
information to go on, only it happens that I've got plenty of
leisure just now and I thought I might glance at it."</p>

<p>"I see. And how did you propose setting about finding Mr. John
Hone?"</p>

<p>"I intended to ask old Lord What's-his-name, the lad who owns
the spot. I thought he might know something. And I thought I might
try to have a word with the new librarian, if there is such a
party."</p>

<p>"There was such a party until last night," replied Fleming.</p>

<p>Kerrigan got excited.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me that another of them has skipped
out?" he said.</p>

<p>"Not skipped out," said the Inspector. "Murdered. The librarian
was murdered in the library some time during the night."</p>

<h2 id='ch3'>III<br>
THE TREASURE</h2>

<p>"One librarian talks about a million pounds and vanishes,"
murmured Fleming thoughtfully, "and his successor is murdered."</p>

<p>"I had no idea it was such an exciting trade," Kerrigan
observed, but the detective paid no attention to him. He was
staring at the carpet and frowning. Kerrigan waited. At last
Fleming looked up with a grin.</p>

<p>"The last time you and I met professionally," he remarked, "was
in the matter of that murder in Earlscourt and the North of England
forgers."[*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Murder in Earlscourt, by Neil Gordon.]</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"As a direct result of your being allowed to do what you liked,
the boss of the forgers got clear away with his life and liberty,
and you got clear away with a whole sack of forged pound-notes. By
the way, how did you manage to get them changed?"</p>

<p>Kerrigan winked.</p>

<p>"I suppose that's the reason for your having so much leisure,"
went on Fleming. "How many notes were there in that sack?"</p>

<p>"You don't suppose, do you," said the young man, "that if you
can't collect any evidence against me, I'm going to manufacture it
myself?" He glanced round, and lowered his voice. "As a matter of
fact, there were four thousand five hundred and twenty-nine."</p>

<p>"Quite so," replied Fleming. "A tidy little sum. And now look
here, Master Kerrigan, this time you're not going to be allowed to
operate outside, on your own, like you did before. You're inside,
and you stay inside, where I can keep an eye on you. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. And what's more, I'll make a bargain with you. I'll
help you to find the murderer, if you promise to leave me the
million if I get hold of it. Is it a deal?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly not," replied Fleming firmly. "But I rely on
you, as a law-abiding citizen, to bring me any information which
you think may be of use."</p>

<p>"That's all jolly fine," retorted Kerrigan, "but how do I know
what may be of use until you tell me all about the murder? Come on,
Colonel, shoot the story."</p>

<p>After a moment's thought, Fleming said:</p>

<p>"I don't see why not. As a matter of fact there isn't much to
tell so far. The librarian was a man of about thirty, called Walter
Newman, of Canadian origin; he was brought up in America and
subsequently came to this country. He was taken on here to fill the
vacancy caused by Hone's departure about six weeks ago; he had very
high recommendations from several people in Canada, and one or two
in England. Lord Claydon took him on at once, because he is anxious
to get the catalogue of the library finished as soon as possible.
It's an enormous library, and it's never been properly catalogued,
apparently."</p>

<p>"Is it worth a million pounds?" inquired Kerrigan. "I don't know
much about these things."</p>

<p>"It's supposed to be worth about ten thousand pounds. But of
course, when it's all catalogued, it may turn out to be worth
more."</p>

<p>"Or less."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But the library isn't the valuable thing about this
place, Kerrigan. The library's a bagatelle compared to the
Treasure."</p>

<p>Kerrigan was thrilled by the word. It conjured up visions of
everything that he had been pursuing for years&mdash;gold, silver,
jewels, anything which could be converted into wealth, luxury, and
ease.</p>

<p>"Treasure?" he repeated in a reverent whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes. There's no secret about it. It used to be quite a
well-known story."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Kerrigan. "It's not well-known to me. I've never
heard of it."</p>

<p>"In about 1830," said Fleming, "there was a mad Lord Claydon who
brought it back from India. He was an art-collector; collected
anything he could lay his hands on&mdash;pictures, books,
furniture, jewels, carpets, tapestries, sculpture, anything. The
house is full of stuff he brought home from his travels. And,
incidentally, there is a tremendous lot of valuable stuff in the
house. But the most valuable of the lot, according to himself, was
the Treasure which he brought back from India on his last voyage.
He got a great iron safe made for it in one of the cellars and a
huge iron double door for the cellar itself, and then he went and
died, and the Treasure has never been seen from that day to
this."</p>

<p>"What! It wasn't in the safe?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't anywhere. There's been about a hundred years of
searching for it, but in the last twenty or thirty years they've
rather given it up as a bad job. They're very doubtful, in fact, if
it ever existed. You see, the old chap was as mad as a hatter from
all accounts."</p>

<p>"And what did the Treasure consist of?"</p>

<p>"Ah! That's one of the points. Nobody ever saw it. The old boy
came home in a great state of excitement and announced that he'd
got the greatest treasure of his life, and chucked every soul out
of the house except a pair of Hindu servants whom he'd brought back
with him. After a couple of months he threw open the house again,
and got the safe made, and he told his eldest son&mdash;the present
man's grandfather&mdash;that he would tell him about the Treasure
when he was on his death-bed. And a week later he broke his neck
hunting, and that was the end of him, and his bag of diamonds or
whatever it was."</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan whistled.</p>

<p>"And now librarian John Hone has found them, eh?"</p>

<p>Fleming sat up.</p>

<p>"I wonder. But why kill his successor? That seems rather a
difficulty."</p>

<p>"Yes. It does. By the way, how was he killed?"</p>

<p>"Hit on the head with a poker&mdash;the devil of a hard
hit."</p>

<p>"And is that all the story so far?"</p>

<p>"That's all," said Fleming, getting up. "Turn your active and
shockingly experienced mind on to the problem, my lad, and keep
your eyes open. Let me know if anything occurs to you and don't try
any monkey-tricks or you'll find yourself in Queer Street. By the
way, you might have a look at the house-party and let me know what
you think of them. They're an odd crew, so far as I've been able to
make out. But I haven't had long enough to give them a real look
over."</p>

<p>"You can't give me any assurance about my share in any swag that
emerges?" began Kerrigan, but Fleming cut him short.</p>

<p>"No, I can't," he replied, "and I wouldn't if I could. Now come
and be introduced to Lord Claydon. By the way, I wonder what you'd
better be? I don't want him to think you're helping me."</p>

<p>"I'm going to help myself," murmured Kerrigan, but not loud
enough for the detective to hear. In a louder voice he said:</p>

<p>"I'll be agent of the Insurance Company that the librarian
fellow was insured with. How about that?"</p>

<p>"It'll do. But you don't look like an insurance agent. You're
too well dressed. However, nobody will pay much attention to you,"
and Fleming led the way into a billiard-room at the end of a long
corridor.</p>

<p>"Oh, won't they?" said Kerrigan to himself, as he saw a couple
of girls talking in a far corner of the room. "Just you wait, my
lad!"</p>

<p>The next moment he was being introduced to Lord Claydon as the
representative of the Moon Life Insurance Company of Canada. Lord
Claydon, a middle-aged man of about fifty-five, bowed coldly and
said nothing. He obviously did not like insurance agents. He
obviously liked them even less when Fleming explained that it was
essential that this one should stay in the house until the inquiry
was over. Lord Claydon turned abruptly and called to one of the
girls in the corner:</p>

<p>"Pamela, here's a&mdash;a&mdash;gentleman from the insurance
people who has to be put up. Will you fix a room for him,
and&mdash;er&mdash;look after him." And without waiting for an
answer, his lordship turned away, and walked across to the
fireplace where another middle-aged man was standing, and plunged
into conversation with him. Fleming slipped out and went back to
work. The girl addressed as Pamela walked slowly round the
billiard-table and nodded unsmilingly to the representative of the
insurance company.</p>

<p>"How d'you do? I'll tell Perkins to arrange something for you.
It'll face north, though. But it can't be helped." She nodded again
and went back to her corner.</p>

<p>Kerrigan was left isolated in the middle of the room. He looked
at the fireplace, at the two middle-aged men, and then he looked at
the corner where the two girls were engaged in earnest talk with a
tall, thin young man, and decided to plunge into the latter group.
He approached them with easy confidence, undaunted by the frigid
silence which greeted his advance.</p>

<p>"Tiresome things, these murders," he observed genially. "Upset
the domestic staff always, what?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl Pamela. She was a tall, good-looking
girl of about twenty-three or four, beautifully dressed and
manicured, with marcel-waved black hair and crimson lips, thin
eyebrows, and unfathomable depths of self-confidence.</p>

<p>"I suppose the next thing is to spot the murderer," proceeded
Kerrigan. "Do you think it's an outside job or an inside job?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Pamela.</p>

<p>"And what do you think, sir?" he addressed the thin young
man.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the thin young man. Peter Kerrigan
glanced swiftly over him and was interested in his appearance. His
face was very brown and he had a scar across one of his cheeks as
if he had once been the hero of a German student-duel, and he
looked very competent. His hair was dark brown, his eyes were light
brown, and an upturned moustache gave him a distinguished
appearance. His manner, to put it mildly, was stand-offish.
Kerrigan turned to the other girl and was even more interested. She
was very tall&mdash;only an inch or so short of six feet&mdash;and
she carried herself magnificently. An exquisite pink-and-white
natural complexion was emphasised by contrast with a superb mass of
dark red hair that glowed with dull splendour in the sunlight, and
there was something about her face that made Kerrigan think that
she might have a sense of humour, in spite of the statuesque
coldness with which she was regarding him.</p>

<p>"I must introduce myself," he said, with a comprehensive bow to
the trio. "My name is Kerrigan. Peter Kerrigan."</p>

<p>The girl called Pamela obviously felt that some sort of show of
civility was called for, and she said in a perfunctory way:</p>

<p>"Miss Shackleford. Captain Streatfield&mdash;let me
introduce&mdash;"</p>

<p>They both bowed distantly.</p>

<p>"What about you, Miss Shackleford?" Kerrigan persevered. "Have
you any theories about the murder?"</p>

<p>"None, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Kerrigan felt like taking out his handkerchief and mopping his
brow. He had never known such uphill work. Instead, he tried a new
tack.</p>

<p>"What about the famous Treasure, eh? This business brings it
into the sphere of practical politics again, all right. I bet that
librarian knew a thing or two about it."</p>

<p>There was no answer from the trio, and Peter became aware that
Lord Claydon and the other man by the fireplace were listening. The
next moment the door opened and a short, tubby, cheerful-looking
man came in. With almost audible sighs of relief the silent party
in the corner broke up and went eagerly to meet him.</p>

<p>"Come and make up a four, Mr. Rubin," cried Lady Pamela. "We've
been waiting for you."</p>

<p>"I could not get away a moment sooner," replied the newcomer in
a strong American accent. "I have been making a deposition to the
cops, and it took them thirty minutes to write down in
quadruplicate that I was asleep last night from eleven-fifteen till
seven-forty this morning, and heard no sounds or signs of the
dastardly crime."</p>

<p>A card-table was put out and the four sat down to bridge.
Kerrigan strolled across to the fireplace, and the other man was
introduced as Sir George Ilford. Sir George was the only one of the
party who seemed disposed to talk. He was about six feet five, and
his breadth of shoulder, his bushy black eyebrows, and his heavy
black moustache added to the formidable aggressiveness of his whole
appearance.</p>

<p>"Insurance, are you?" he said, staring down at Kerrigan. "Come
to dispute the claim, I suppose. That's all you fellows ever do.
You don't look like an insurance tout, either. But all you
insurance chaps get prosperous on the mugs who pay the
premiums."</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan looked up at him coolly.</p>

<p>"You don't look like a mug," he observed. The big man was
surprised at this answer, and could not think of any better reply
than, "You're right there."</p>

<p>The conversation got no farther; Lord Claydon looked at his
watch and said nervously to Ilford something about a stroll in the
rose-garden before tea, and the two men went out of one of the
French windows, the host pausing to say, "I hope you'll make
yourself at home, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;" before he went out.</p>

<p>"I'm not being what you might call a social success," thought
Kerrigan, as he strolled out of the billiard-room to make a survey
of the house. "They don't seem to cotton on to me as a guest very
much."</p>

<p>Seeing a telephone in the hall, he rang up his hotel in London
to ask for a bag to be packed and dispatched to Marsh Manor by
passenger train, and then he wandered round the house.</p>

<p>"There are two possible hypotheses," he said to himself, as he
strolled slowly along one of the corridors which seemed to abound
in the vast mansion. "Either the Treasure is still here, or it was
taken away last night. John Hone may have got wind of its
hiding-place or he may not. But if he did, I'll swear he didn't
take it away with him. Because there would be no point in killing
the lad last night if the stuff had already gone."</p>

<p>"I wish Fleming trusted me," was his next reflection, and he
heaved a deep sigh as he admitted that there was no particular
reason for the Inspector to trust him. It was pretty annoying,
though, to think that there was a very good chance that an
immensely valuable treasure was lying somewhere in the house, and
that if any one found it, it would probably be the police officials
themselves.</p>

<p>A distant gong seemed to indicate that tea was ready, but
Kerrigan decided to continue his stroll; and after an hour of
methodical pacing, of counting yards and door-handles, of ascending
and descending staircases, and of comparing his results with a plan
of the house which he found on the wall of the gun-room, he was
able to reach a fairly accurate mental picture of the lie of the
land. The ground-floor was enormous, the first floor much smaller,
and the jumble of attics on the second floor was about the same
size as the first. But almost all the activity of the house was on
the ground-floor, which included sixteen out of the thirty
bedrooms. The library was separate from the rest of the house and
was connected with it by a glass-roofed passage. From the date on
the gun-room plan, it was fairly certain that the mad Lord Claydon
had built the library, and from the scale of the plan it was
obvious that it was an extremely large room. But close study of it
was impossible at the moment, owing to the presence in the
glass-roofed passage of an exceptionally bulky and taciturn
policeman with instructions to let no one pass. Another bulky and
taciturn policeman was on duty at the top of the cellar stairs, so
there was no opportunity of examining the famous safe which had not
contained the Treasure; and Peter, having discovered his allotted
bedroom on the first floor, retired to consider the recent form of
the horses who were due to race against each other in the Derby on
the following Wednesday week. At half-past six a footman of stately
demeanour appeared and announced coldly that he had come to lay out
his evening clothes, and was palpably shaken on hearing that the
gentleman had brought no evening clothes, or indeed any luggage at
all. He had a poor opinion at any time of gentlemen visitors who
were relegated to the first floor, facing north; and a visitor who
addressed him as "old fish" was little better than a social pariah.
Alfred indicated his opinion by a superior lift of his eyebrows
which Kerrigan did not miss. He immediately counter-attacked.</p>

<p>"Is there a telephone on this floor?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"There are six telephones on this floor," replied Alfred
loftily.</p>

<p>"Then get me the Duke of Westminster at once."</p>

<p>"The Duke of&mdash;" faltered Alfred, his nerve beginning to
give way.</p>

<p>"Of Westminster. And please be kind enough to bring me a whisky
and soda."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Very good, sir. At once, sir," replied the footman,
almost backing out of the room in mingled deference and alarm. He
returned in two minutes with a large whisky and soda, and in five
minutes with the information that His Grace was in the south of
France. This did not surprise Kerrigan, who had read the news of
His Grace's departure in the <i>Daily Mail</i> that morning, but he
remarked petulantly, "Dash the man! He might have told me." Alfred
bowed deeply and retired. At seven o'clock he returned to say that
the Inspector of Police wished him to attend in the library, and
Kerrigan went down eagerly to the scene of the crime.</p>

<p>The library was shaped like the nave of a Gothic church. It was
enormously long and enormously high, with a vaulted roof. The books
were crammed into bookcases about twelve feet high&mdash;the upper
shelves being accessible only from step ladders which were
scattered about the room, and there seemed to be thousands of them.
High above these shelves there was a narrow gallery, running round
all four sides of the library, and reached by a spiral staircase at
each end. The floor was crowded with tables on which lay glass
cases, and there was one large table covered with papers. At the
far end there was a small room which was used as the librarian's
office; it had no door communicating with the outside, and so
formed a kind of cul-de-sac.</p>

<p>Kerrigan found Fleming giving instructions to his sergeant, who
was scribbling in a notebook. The Inspector beckoned him in.</p>

<p>"This is the place, Kerrigan. And under that sheet is
the&mdash;er&mdash;chief exhibit. I want you to have a look at it,
in a moment. In the meantime, what do you think of the
house-party?"</p>

<p>"A genial crowd, a genial crowd," replied Kerrigan. "One of them
very nearly spoke a civil word to me, and another one almost
recognised my existence when I addressed her."</p>

<p>"Streatfield and Lady Pamela are engaged to be married."</p>

<p>"Then I'm sorry for both of them," said Kerrigan
wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Fleming took him by the lapel of his coat and led him into a
corner.</p>

<p>"Look here, my lad," he said in an undertone, "I can't make you
help me if you don't want to. But if you're after this Treasure,
your way lies along my way for a considerable extent, and we might
do worse than pool our information."</p>

<p>"All right," said Kerrigan. "Pool away; you begin."</p>

<p>"Well, the first thing," said Fleming, "is that this murder was
unpremeditated."</p>

<p>"And the man was bashed with a poker?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The library poker."</p>

<p>"That means that who ever did it was pretty quick, and pretty
desperate."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Fleming, "and I'll show you one of the things that
made him quick."</p>

<p>He opened a cardboard box and displayed an automatic pistol.</p>

<p>"This was in the librarian's hand," he said. "A queer thing for
a librarian to have, eh?"</p>

<p>"May I look at it?" asked Kerrigan, stretching out his hand.
"You've got all the finger-prints, and what not, off it?"</p>

<p>Fleming nodded.</p>

<p>"American&mdash;1930 make&mdash;not fired lately&mdash;common as
flies in Chicago&mdash;no sort of help there," murmured Kerrigan as
he made a rapid and expert survey of the weapon.</p>

<p>"He had two spare clips of cartridges in his coat-pocket and two
more in his kit upstairs. And he carried it under his arm."</p>

<p>"Whew! He must have been one of the lads! That's Al Capone
stuff."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought that too," agreed Fleming. "But apart from the
gun there wasn't anything else at all suspicious in his outfit.
Come along and have a look at him."</p>

<p>The dead librarian had been killed outright with a single
smashing blow of the poker on the side of the head. Kerrigan looked
at the body, which was clad in dressing-gown, pyjamas, and bedroom
slippers, for several minutes before he said:</p>

<p>"The hands might be the hands of a man who never did any manual
labour, but spent all his time pottering about with books; they
might also be the hands of a man who played the piano, or mended
watches, or opened safes."</p>

<p>"Opened safes?" said Fleming sharply.</p>

<p>Kerrigan spread out his own thin, beautifully-shaped
fingers.</p>

<p>"Like mine," he remarked blandly.</p>

<p>There was a silence for a moment, and then Kerrigan glanced at
the inside of the dead man's bedroom slippers.</p>

<p>"American make," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes. Cincinnati. The man was a Canadian who had lived in the
States."</p>

<p>"If I were you, Fleming, I would go into those references of
his. I can't believe that librarians in this dead-and-alive corner
of a law-abiding country carry guns under their arms."</p>

<p>"I have already wired about them."</p>

<p>Kerrigan patted the Inspector on the back.</p>

<p>"You are coming on, my boy. I shall recommend you to the
Commissioners for promotion."</p>

<p>"Any more cheek," replied Fleming with a laugh, "and I shall
recommend you to the magistrates for deportation."</p>

<p>"In the meantime, what's the next move?"</p>

<p>Fleming lowered his voice again.</p>

<p>"Watch the house-party. It was an inside job."</p>

<p>Kerrigan whistled. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"One of the house-party?"</p>

<p>"Or one of the servants. Maitland&mdash;my sergeant&mdash;is
going to watch the servants' hall. You and I will take the
rest."</p>

<p>The gong sounded again from the house, and the policeman on duty
at the door of the library put his head in and said, "Dinner is
announced, sir."</p>

<p>"One more word," said Kerrigan. "Is there any trace of anything
having been taken away from here during the night?"</p>

<p>Fleming laughed.</p>

<p>"If there were a million golden sovereigns hidden here, then I
can assure you they have not been removed. But if there was a
handful of jewels, then nobody can possibly say whether they have
been removed or not. In any case, I don't think they are likely to
have left the house."</p>

<h2 id='ch4'>IV<br>
SPARRING FOR POSITION</h2>

<p>The short and tubby Mr. Rubin proved to be the life and soul of
the dinner-party. He chattered away gaily in his high-pitched
American voice, and did not seem to mind in the least that the only
people at the table who paid the slightest attention to him were
Kerrigan and a guest whom the latter was only meeting for the first
time. This was an elderly gentleman called Tollemache, a small,
bent, scholarly-looking individual with gold-rimmed spectacles and
grey hair, and a courteous, old-world manner in which he apologised
frequently for allowing his attention to stray from the topics
under discussion. It transpired in the course of some skilfully
veiled questioning by Kerrigan, that Mr. Tollemache was an expert
valuer of works of art, who was apparently doing for the
art-treasures of Marsh Manor what the unfortunate librarian had
been doing for the library.</p>

<p>The indefatigably gay Mr. Rubin, disregarding most courageously
the damping atmosphere of the dinner-table, persisted in chaffing
Mr. Tollemache on the chances that he might provide the next victim
for the murderer.</p>

<p>"Art-valuers for art's sake," he kept on repeating waggishly,
till poor little Mr. Tollemache positively squirmed in his chair,
and the magnificent Miss Shackleford finally came to his
rescue.</p>

<p>"I think we ought to change the subject," she announced coldly,
but decisively.</p>

<p>"I cordially agree," exclaimed Kerrigan, and his quick eye
noticed that the girl looked as if his support made her sorry that
she had spoken.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Rubin. "Let's talk about Insurance. I
understand that this gentleman represents an Insurance Company.
Will you quote me a risk for a wet day for the Derby?"</p>

<p>"Three and a tenth," replied Peter glibly; he had not the
faintest idea of the technical jargon of the profession he was
representing.</p>

<p>Sir George Ilford looked sharply down the table from under his
heavy black eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Three and a tenth what?" he inquired in a waspish tone that did
not sound at all friendly.</p>

<p>"Oh, just three and a tenth," replied Kerrigan airily. "That's
the market figure."</p>

<p>Captain Streatfield took a hand in the talk.</p>

<p>"How do you fellows work out a figure like that? It's all Greek
to me."</p>

<p>"We employ a staff of highly-trained meteorologists who
calculate the secondary arterial depressions," answered the
insurance agent, "and their results are passed on to the staff of
chemico-mathematicians who reduce the whole thing to a common
denominator and recommend a figure which goes before the next
board-meeting. "And if that doesn't choke 'em off," thought
Kerrigan, "I'll eat my hat."</p>

<p>Streatfield's face had gone completely blank as he nodded
vaguely several times, but little Mr. Tollemache became quite
excited.</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;what is a secondary, arterial depression?" he
cried. "I've been an amateur meteorologist for years, and I've
never heard of such a thing. Will you explain it to me?"</p>

<p>"Damn it!" thought Kerrigan, "that's hard luck!" Aloud he
replied:</p>

<p>"Explain it, my dear sir? I'll do better than that. I'll send
you a book about it, and, if I may, a little pamphlet of my own on
the subject. Don't let me forget to do that. Give me your card
after dinner. And what is your fancy for the Derby, Mr. Rubin?" he
went on hastily to avoid the possible importunities of the amateur
meteorologist. In this he was successful, for the discussion of
various likely winners of the Derby almost made the conversation
general. Kerrigan, during the exchange of certainties and tips and
likely winners, glanced swiftly round the table. There was no doubt
that an atmosphere of tension existed in Marsh Manor; an atmosphere
not entirely to be accounted for by the tragic occurrence of the
night before. The librarian had only been among them for a few
weeks, and Sir George Ilford and Lord Claydon and the tough but
pleasant-looking captain did not seem to be the sort of men who
would be unduly cast down by the death, even the violent death, of
a comparative stranger. Lord Claydon himself was nervous and
silent. Dark lines under his eyes, a tremulous wrist when he lifted
his wine-glass, a hunted expression, combined to give him an air of
worry and depression. Kerrigan caught him several times staring at
Sir George Ilford with a curious, unfathomable look in his eyes,
and each time he started perceptibly on realising that Kerrigan was
watching him.</p>

<p>After dinner the two girls and Streatfield and Rubin returned to
their bridge-table; Mr. Tollemache dived into an Art Quarterly,
Lord Claydon disappeared, and the dark and immense baronet
challenged Kerrigan to a game of picquet. On the delivery of the
challenge, Streatfield looked up sharply from the card-table and
started to say something, but was checked by Miss Shackleford's
quick interruption of "Your deal, David."</p>

<p>Kerrigan soon discovered that Ilford was a fairly good
picquet-player, and by dint of carefully masking his own
expertness, succeeded in losing fourteen pounds in an hour without
arousing any suspicion. The result was exactly as he had hoped. The
baronet grew exceedingly cheerful; several whiskies and sodas were
sent for and consumed; and at the end of another hour's play, Sir
George, twenty-three pounds up, was positively mellow. By this time
they were alone in the drawing-room&mdash;Mr. Tollemache having
retired to bed and the other four to play snooker&mdash;and Ilford
became almost confidential.</p>

<p>"Who did the murder, Mr. What's-your-name?" he asked. And
without waiting for an answer he went straight on, "What do you
make of Rubin, eh?"</p>

<p>"A very nice gentleman, I think," said Kerrigan, assuming a
simple expression, as of one who was anxious to please
everybody.</p>

<p>"Oh, you do, do you?" replied Ilford truculently. "Well, you're
easy to please. And what's he doing here, eh?"</p>

<p>"He's a guest of his lordship's, I suppose."</p>

<p>"A queer sort of guest," said the other with a frown. "Came here
a week ago with a letter of introduction from Claydon's son in New
York, was asked to stay to dinner, and has been here ever since and
shows no signs of going. What do you make of that, Mr. Insurance
Tout?"</p>

<p>"It means that his lordship is a very hospitable man,
surely."</p>

<p>"It means also that Mr. Rubin wants investigating, as I told
that inspector this morning. I'll tell you what happened, of
course. Young Marsh, Claydon's son, is out in New York running
after some damned chorus girl or other, as he always is, and he
must have met Rubin and told him all about the Treasure. Sort of
thing Marsh would do when he'd got a couple of drinks inside him.
And Rubin has come over to try and get it for himself. The question
is whether he got it or not&mdash;last night."</p>

<p>Kerrigan did his best to give a start of horror, but felt that
it was unconvincing. Ilford, however, did not seem to notice
anything, for he went on:</p>

<p>"That shakes you a bit, doesn't it? What do you think, eh? Does
Mr. Rubin look the sort of man that murders an unfortunate young
librarian in cold blood?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know anything about that sort of
thing," replied Kerrigan, achieving a very passable stutter of
alarm.</p>

<p>The baronet sneered.</p>

<p>"The place is full of queer guests," he said. "But then, it's a
queer world nowadays. I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be
glad to sit down to picquet with an insurance tout. Never mind.
Your money is as good as any one else's. At least I hope your
cheque is. Have another drink. I'm going to bed. We must have
another game to-morrow night," and he stalked out without another
glance at his defeated opponent.</p>

<p>Kerrigan waited a minute or two and then drifted into the
billiard-room, where Streatfield and the two girls were standing,
cues in hand, in a group. Rubin was not in the room. There was an
awkward drop in the conversation as he came in and then Streatfield
said abruptly, "No, damn it, I'm going to," and came forward.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kerrigan."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kerrigan. Did you lose a lot to Ilford?"</p>

<p>"More than I could afford," replied the young man, wondering if
he dared to venture on a sickly smile, and discarding it at the
last moment in favour of a downcast expression. "About twenty-three
pounds."</p>

<p>"It's a damned shame!" cried Rosemary Shackleford.</p>

<p>"He's a very good player," murmured Kerrigan deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"He's more than a good player," replied Streatfield meaningly.
"He's a very lucky player. His luck is so famous that there are
certain clubs in London where he finds it difficult to get
opponents."</p>

<p>"I certainly thought he was a little fortunate once or twice
this evening."</p>

<p>"Take my advice," replied Streatfield, "and don't play with him
again."</p>

<p>"But I want to try and win my money back!" Kerrigan protested
eagerly.</p>

<p>"When you've seen a twentieth part of the world that I have,"
said Streatfield, "you'll realise that you very seldom get your
money back from men like him. Anyway"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"don't say you haven't been warned."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. Thank you very much indeed. But I assure
you that I can look after myself. I'm not such a greenhorn as all
that, you know. And now what about a game of bridge?"</p>

<p>But the other three declined, on account of the lateness of the
hour, and retired. Kerrigan picked up a cue and began to practice
some intricate fancy strokes at the top of the table, when the door
opened and Mr. Rubin came in. He stopped in the doorway for a
moment, during which Kerrigan had the presence of mind to miscue
atrociously, and then came forward.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to find you alone," said the American. "I've been
wanting a word with you. Have a cigar?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I never smoke cigars," replied Kerrigan
untruthfully. The other man lit up and then said:</p>

<p>"Do you want to earn a little money, lad?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely." The reply was emphatic and sincere.</p>

<p>"Well, now's your chance. I don't know if you're a wealthy man
or whether fifty pounds would be of any use to you. But if you want
to pick up fifty, you can do it."</p>

<p>"Fifty pounds! I'm your man. It's nothing illegal, is it?" he
added virtuously.</p>

<p>Mr. Rubin laughed.</p>

<p>"Illegal! Good heavens, no. I want to send a letter to my wife
about a business deal I'm engaged on, and the cops have established
what you might call a censorship bureau here, and they're reading
all the letters that come in or go out. Now, I don't want my
affairs known to every Tom, Dick, and Harry in the Force. So will
you slip out to-night and post a letter for me in Bicester?"</p>

<p>"Why not do it yourself?"</p>

<p>Mr. Rubin looked at him pityingly.</p>

<p>"I was in the house when the librarian was bumped off," he said,
"and so I'm a suspect. You weren't, so you aren't, if you follow
me. We're under parole not to leave the house. I can't break my
parole. Besides," he added naively, "it would look so damned
suspicious if I was caught. But it wouldn't matter to you. You've
given no parole and you're a free citizen. How about it?"</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said Kerrigan; "I'm a married man with seven
children, and I couldn't look them in the face again if I refused a
chance of picking up fifty pounds."</p>

<p>"Good lad, good lad!" exclaimed Mr. Rubin. "I thought you'd
probably help me. Here's the letter, and here's ten pounds to go on
with. I wouldn't have bothered you, only it is very important. Vast
sums of money are involved." He thrust an envelope and a crinkly
note into Kerrigan's hand, and got up and hurried from the
room.</p>

<p>"Well, now," murmured Kerrigan, lying back in his chair and
gazing at the ceiling, "what on earth is the meaning of that? Am I
behaving like such a complete mutt that people think I won't see
anything fishy in being given fifty quid to post a letter at
midnight? Or is Mr. Rubin such a complete mutt as not to see
anything fishy? Or is Mr. Rubin a sufficiently clever man to see
that I'm not such a fool as I look, and that I'll spot at once the
fishiness of the transaction? Yes, that might be it. That might
very well be it."</p>

<p>The letter was addressed to Mrs. H. Rubin, 38 Edward Road,
Battersea, and marked, "To be called for."</p>

<p>Kerrigan rang the bell and asked for a kettle of boiling water.
With the aid of the electric heater he managed to maintain a
sufficient head of steam to soften the gum of the envelope. Very
gingerly he opened and read the letter. It ran:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Mary,&mdash;You will find the stuff at 150
Ladbroke Crescent. But it is quite unimportant. Business is going
fine, and I hope to complete soon. Please send me any news you get
from New York.&mdash;Yours ever,<br>
<br>
"Hilldrop K. Rubin."</p>

<p>He read it again and then a third time, and then he replaced it
in the envelope and sealed it up. He was faced with a pretty
problem, and the more he considered it, the more difficult it
became. If it was a serious, urgent message, worth fifty pounds to
get sent off, then it was obviously in cipher and might mean
anything. No one in their senses would entrust an important message
to a total stranger without making certain that it was
unintelligible to him. On the other hand, it might mean nothing at
all, in which case Mr. Rubin must be trying to test the <i>&gt;bona
fides</i> of the insurance agent. "That is to say," thought
Kerrigan, "if I am a good man and true, I will go and post the
letter and earn my money; whereas if I am a police spy, I will tell
Fleming, and 38 Edward Street, Battersea, will be watched for
little Mary, and 150 Ladbroke Crescent will be searched, and
Hilldrop K.&mdash;Good Lord! what a name!&mdash;will know where I
stand. But then again! Is he likely to pay fifty pounds to know
where I stand? If so&mdash;he's up to no good, and that black-faced
barrister isn't far wrong."</p>

<p>After half an hour's earnest pondering he left the
billiard-room, nodded good-night to the sleepy policeman who was on
duty in the hall, and strolled down one of the long ground-floor
corridors as if going to his bedroom. It was now just on midnight,
and the house was very quiet. On reaching the door of the gun-room
in which he had found the plan of the house, he glanced over his
shoulder to make certain that he was not being followed, slipped in
and shut the door and wedged a chair under the handle. Then, very
cautiously, without turning on the light, he tiptoed to a corner in
which he had seen a jumble of tennis racquets and shoes, found a
rubber-soled pair that more or less fitted him, opened the window
noiselessly and peered out. A policeman was standing on the lawn
about three yards away, with his back to him, yawning heavily.
Peter Kerrigan ducked down below the level of the sill, and then
slowly hoisted himself up so that he could just see over it and
reconnoitred the position. The solution to the problem was easy.
Twenty yards to the left a small conservatory was joined on to the
house, and with a dexterous flick, Kerrigan threw a tennis racquet
through the glass. The policeman gasped, drew his truncheon, and
made a gallant sprint to the scene of the crash, while Kerrigan
hopped out of the window, pulled it down after him, and scuttled
along the shadow of the wall of the house, round a corner, behind a
shrubbery, and down a garden walk in the direction of the wood
which screened Marsh Manor from the road.</p>

<p>Once in the shelter of the wood he was comparatively safe until
he reached the walls of the park, which were, for all he knew, also
being patrolled by guardians of the King's Peace. He kept well away
from the gates, and found himself confronted by the distinctly
awkward obstacle of a twelve-foot brick wall, along the foot of
which he groped in search of a foothold, until he suddenly came
upon a ladder leaning against it. Without a moment's hesitation he
went up it like a lamplighter, down the rope-ladder which was
hanging on the other side, and off down the road in the direction
of Bicester.</p>

<p>"I'm not the only cat upon the tiles to-night," he reflected, as
he lolloped along at a steady six miles an hour into the town. He
posted the letter, and then went into a day-and-night telephone-box
which was outside the post office and rang up the quiet little club
at the back of Grosvenor Square that he belonged to&mdash;a club
where a little roulette could always be played&mdash;and asked for
the secretary. The secretary, whose real work did not begin until
about one a.m. when the club-rooms began to fill up, was promptly
available, and Kerrigan asked him to find out what he could about
Sir George Ilford, Captain Streatfield, and Lord Claydon, and let
him have the information sent to Jessop Gaukrodger, Esq., C.B.E.,
c/o The Angel Hotel, Bicester, to be left till called for. The
secretary, whose terms for inquiring into antecedents were five
pounds per head, willingly undertook the commission, and Peter,
well satisfied with his evening's work so far, hung up the
receiver, stepped out of the box, and collided with Miss
Shackleford.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Kerrigan," she said politely, and entered the
box.</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan walked very thoughtfully down the road for a
couple of hundred yards and then, very thoughtfully, back again.
The girl came out of the telephone-box as he came up.</p>

<p>"May I have the honour of escorting you back to the Manor?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Of two evils, I would sooner be escorted than spied upon," she
replied coldly.</p>

<p>"I wasn't spying upon you," protested Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"Let us call it simply a curious coincidence," answered Miss
Shackleford, falling into step beside him. "And how is the
insurance business? Flourishing, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Fair to middling, thank you."</p>

<p>"There are two rather queer things about you, Mr.
Kerrigan&mdash;by the way, am I walking too fast for you?"</p>

<p>"I can manage to keep up," he replied a little angrily. He made
rather a speciality of self-possession and aplomb, but this girl
seemed to be in the same line of business.</p>

<p>"You are much too well dressed to be an insurance agent, and
much too foolish&mdash;after losing all that money to Sir
George&mdash;to be anything except what you obviously are."</p>

<p>"And what is that, please?"</p>

<p>She laughed; a gay laugh which rippled away over the fields, and
said:</p>

<p>"You're so obviously a society journalist. Tell me, are you
Melisande, or Man About Town, or Cicerone?"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I'm Lord Beaverbrook."</p>

<p>"Then will you give me a photograph and a couple of paragraphs
in the <i>Express</i>?"</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan changed the subject abruptly.</p>

<p>"Miss Shackleford, what is the trouble at Marsh Manor? There's
no use telling me that there isn't any trouble, because it's so
obvious."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I would tell anything important to a
gossip-writer?"</p>

<p>"Then there is something important?"</p>

<p>"Only to the people concerned. Not to you or your 'public.'" She
threw an infinity of scorn into the last word. Kerrigan tried a new
line.</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is Sir George Ilford?"</p>

<p>"Ask no questions and you'll get no lies."</p>

<p>"Oh! He's as bad as that, is he?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say so."</p>

<p>"And Captain Streatfield? He looks nice."</p>

<p>"He is nice."</p>

<p>"I suppose the truth is that Lord Claydon has made some sort of
bloomer or other and Ilford is blackmailing him." Kerrigan spoke in
jest, but he was immediately conscious that the girl's cheerful
bantering defence had changed into a wary caution. There was a
perceptible pause before she replied:</p>

<p>"That would make a good paragraph, wouldn't it? I expect you'd
get seven-and-sixpence for that, and your boss would get a nice
libel action."</p>

<p>"Ilford doesn't look as if he would stick at anything," Kerrigan
reflected aloud. "Not the sort of man I'd care to come up
against."</p>

<p>"Considering he was a heavy-weight boxing champion and is still
in first-class condition, I don't advise you to come up against
him, <i>mon cher petit</i>. What are you, five feet two, or five
feet three?"</p>

<p>"Five feet ten," said Kerrigan indignantly.</p>

<p>"You don't look it," the girl replied with a maliciously bland
smile. "I'm rather good at ju-jitsu and I believe I could take you
on myself."</p>

<p>Kerrigan ignored this insult.</p>

<p>"What about the Treasure?" he asked, and this time she replied
seriously:</p>

<p>"Ah! the Treasure. If only that could be found, it would solve
everything."</p>

<p>"Are there so many things to be solved?"</p>

<p>"A good many," she sighed involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Such as?"</p>

<p>She recovered at once.</p>

<p>"Ah! That's asking. You stick to the Treasure hunt and the
murder, and leave our private affairs to ourselves."</p>

<p>They trudged on in silence for a bit and then Kerrigan said:</p>

<p>"If I found the Treasure for you, it would be a help to you all,
I understand?"</p>

<p>"If you found it after I've failed, it would be a miracle,"
retorted Miss Shackleford.</p>

<p>"Oh! So you've looked for it?"</p>

<p>"Every one has looked for it."</p>

<p>"Except me."</p>

<p>She laughed derisively.</p>

<p>"Except, O most intelligent insurance agent, you!"</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know what it consists of?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows for certain. But it oughtn't to be very hard to
make a guess, when you remember that the mad Lord Claydon went in
1819 to stay with his friend the Maharajah of Futtiwalla; that
while he was there he succeeded in persuading his cousin, the
Governor-General, not to annex Futtiwalla; that the Maharajah was
very grateful to him; that the Maharajah owned the finest
collection of diamonds in India&mdash;which means the
world&mdash;and that Lord Claydon came back from India with no more
baggage than he took out."</p>

<p>"You mean you think the famous Treasure is a wad of
diamonds?"</p>

<p>"I mean," she replied with mock gravity, "that I think the
famous Treasure is a wad of diamonds. How exceptionally brilliant
of you to guess my meaning like that!"</p>

<p>"It's my exceptional brilliance," murmured Kerrigan, "that has
brought me to my present journalistic eminence. And now what about
those ladders? They are yours, I presume?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I pinched them from the tool-shed."</p>

<p>They got over the wall and threaded their way through the park
till they reached the garden, where the girl halted.</p>

<p>"This is where we part," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I help you to get in?" he whispered back. She shook her
head decisively.</p>

<p>"If it was a question of gate-crashing, I would trust myself to
your expert guidance. But I don't fancy you're cut out for
desperate enterprises. Good-night." She nodded and vanished swiftly
behind a huge rhododendron.</p>

<p>Kerrigan waited breathlessly for the challenge of a policeman,
but nothing happened to break the stillness of the night. After
five minutes he concluded that by some means or other the girl had
managed to get into the house unobserved, and he crept round
towards the gun-room. The policeman was no longer visible, and five
minutes later Kerrigan was safely in bed.</p>

INSPECTOR FLEMING</h2>

<p>Inspector Fleming was a quiet, cautious man. When he was sent to
take charge of a case, the Superintendent at Headquarters and the
Commissioners knew perfectly well that no mistakes of routine would
be made, that no line of investigation would remain unexplored, and
that no theory would remain untested. Progress would not be
brilliant. The investigation would not proceed by spectacular leaps
and bounds. But good, solid, persevering work would be put into it
by the Scottish inspector and his group of subordinates. When,
therefore, Lord Claydon had telephoned the news that his librarian
had been murdered, and added that the Buckinghamshire police had no
objection to the collaboration of a Headquarters detective, the
assistant commissioner had no hesitation in dispatching Fleming to
Marsh Manor. He arrived at half-past ten in the morning, and by
half-past two he was telephoning his first report to his
Superintendent. The main points of his report were:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. That the librarian, Walter Newman, had been found dead in
his pyjamas in the library, pistol in hand, battered about the head
with the library poker.</li>

<li>2. That the windows of the library were fastened on the inside,
and that the total absence of any traces or footmarks on the
rain-sodden grass, gravel, or flower-beds made it almost certainly
"an inside job."</li>

<li>3. That there was any amount of incentive for burgling the
library owing to the supposed existence of the famous
Treasure.</li>

<li>4. That there were several people in the house capable of
striking the violent blow which killed the man.</li>

<li>5. That the antecedents of these people required careful
investigation, as well as those of the librarian.</li>

<li>6. That a Peter Kerrigan had turned up for some reason or
other, but definitely for no good purpose.</li>

<li>7. That he would report again next day.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Nothing for it but to wait till to-morrow, Maitland," the
Inspector said to his sergeant, as he hung up the receiver. "There
are eight men, including the butler and the two footmen, who might
have struck the blow, and the one who did it can't get far away
even if he makes a bolt for it. To-morrow we ought to get some
answers to our questions. To my mind, it lies between Ilford and
Rubin. I don't like the looks of either of them."</p>

<p>The sergeant, who was a silent man, nodded and said nothing.</p>

<p>"It all hinges, of course," went on Fleming, "on this so-called
Treasure. If we knew what it consisted of, we should be a good bit
farther on."</p>

<p>"Money's money all the world over," said Maitland gloomily.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it makes a lot of difference what form it's in. For
instance, if this treasure really consisted of diamonds, we know
where we are. Our pals in the diamond-gangs will be after them. But
if it's some work of art, as it very well might be, according to
what they tell me about the old lunatic, the diamond fellows won't
touch it, and we shall have to look around in the high-class
smuggling circles. It might be a picture, for instance."</p>

<p>"No one would kill a man for a picture."</p>

<p>"Not even if he knew he could smuggle it into America and get a
quarter of a million for it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it might be," conceded Maitland.</p>

<p>"There's another question. Is the Treasure still here, if it
ever was here, or did our friend with the poker get away with it
last night?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" was the sergeant's contribution to the solving of this
knotty point.</p>

<p>"If what Kerrigan says is true&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the sergeant again, knowingly.</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Fleming. "I know it's a big 'if'; but, if it
is true, that man John Hone, while working here in the library,
tumbled to the secret and went away. Why did he go away? Either to
get away with the Treasure or to get help to get away with it. If
the former, why is the librarian murdered six weeks later? If the
latter, the Treasure must be too big for one man to lift by
himself. And in that case, what the devil can it possibly consist
of? I understand from Lord Claydon that they've gone through the
place with a pocket-comb about once every six months for a hundred
years."</p>

<p>"Quite," replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>"And there's another thing," pursued Fleming. "What the blazes
is Kerrigan doing here? He doesn't waste his time, you know. If
Kerrigan's about the place, you may be quite sure that money's
about the place too."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothing for it but to wait till to-morrow."</p>

<p>At midnight, Fleming was aroused by a policeman with the
singular story that a tennis racquet had been thrown through a
conservatory roof for no apparent purpose. A careful examination of
the racquet and the scene of the incident cast no light upon the
affair and the Inspector retired to bed once more.</p>

<p>Next morning the sergeant handed him a bunch of replies to some
of the questions he had asked by telephone and telegram the day
before.</p>

<p>The information contained in these consisted of the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. That Walter Newman, the murdered man, was unknown in
librarian circles; that his certificates of examinations passed,
and degrees attained, were forgeries; that the two credentials of
former employers in London were forgeries.</li>

<li>2. That Sir George Ilford was a man who lived very near the
border-line between legal and illegal methods of self-support; that
he had never actually stepped over the line so far as Scotland Yard
knew.</li>

<li>3. That Captain Streatfield's name was unknown to the
Yard.</li>

<li>4. That Mr. Tollemache was a genuine art-valuer, and himself
the owner of a fine collection.</li>

<li>5. That Lord Claydon was thought to be in low financial
water.</li>
</ul>

<p>While Fleming was considering these replies, Kerrigan strolled
in and greeted the Inspector cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I've got a bit of news for you, venerable sir," he said,
seating himself on the edge of the table, and ignoring Sergeant
Maitland's indignant frown. "Comrade Rubin is a queer fish."</p>

<p>"Is that your news?"</p>

<p>"That's my news. I fancy that Comrade Rubin is anxious to know
whether I'm connected with the police or not."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just an idea of mine, that's all. You see, he realises that
I'm easily the most formidable person in the house. Did you say
anything?" he asked, turning politely to Maitland who had snorted
ostentatiously. "No? Then use your handkerchief and don't sniff.
You see, Fleming, Rubin posted a letter last night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Fleming, "Rubin posted a letter last night?
How?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest idea," replied Kerrigan blandly. "All I
know is that he posted it, and I'm fairly certain he'll be
expecting an answer by telephone to-day; just a message to say that
his letter arrived safely without policemen attached to its
delivery."</p>

<p>Fleming looked hard at the young man who looked back
unabashed.</p>

<p>"Kerrigan," he said finally. "You went out last night and posted
Rubin's letter, and you threw a tennis racquet through the
conservatory to distract attention while you went out or came
in."</p>

<p>Kerrigan protested.</p>

<p>"You haven't a shadow of right to make such an accusation. You
haven't got a shred of evidence."</p>

<p>"I haven't got a shred of evidence, but I'm a tolerably good
guesser."</p>

<p>Kerrigan laughed cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Let's leave it at that, shall we?"</p>

<p>"For the time being," replied the detective dryly; "and now let
me give you a bit of news. The librarian was a fake."</p>

<p>"Forged references?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then a whole lot of it is as plain as a pikestaff," cried
Kerrigan energetically. "Hone discovered the secret and went off to
find a buyer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leaving the Treasure behind him&mdash;" put in Fleming.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the news leaked out and Newman came down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a rival also came down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And bumped off Newman. What clever little chaps we are, to be
sure!"</p>

<p>"But Newman didn't know where the treasure was," said Fleming,
"otherwise he wouldn't have stayed here six weeks."</p>

<p>"But did the murderer know?"</p>

<p>"He might have known. Hone might be working with him."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't Hone come down in person?"</p>

<p>"That's true," said Fleming thoughtfully. "Of course, the
murderer might have got hold of Hone and made him tell him. Hone's
been missing now for six weeks."</p>

<p>"Why not try to find him?"</p>

<p>Fleming looked at Peter with interest.</p>

<p>"What a brilliant suggestion," he said admiringly. "I would
certainly act on it immediately if it wasn't for the fact that the
idea occurred to me about twenty hours ago, and I acted on it
then."</p>

<p>"All right, all right, all right!" protested the young man. "I
was only trying to help."</p>

<p>A policeman came in with a slip of paper and laid it in front of
the Inspector. The latter glanced at it, glanced at Peter, and then
read out: "Telephone message for Mr. Rubin: 'Mary received his
letter quite safely.' Sent from call-box in Jermyn Street."</p>

<p>"Well, Master Kerrigan, it looks as if you guessed right
too."</p>

<p>"It's by guessing right that I make my living," he replied.</p>

<p>"Give this to Mr. Rubin," went on Fleming to his sergeant, "and
ask Lord Claydon to be kind enough to come and speak to me.
Kerrigan, sit over there in that corner and listen, but don't butt
in. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Lord Claydon came into the room a moment or two later. There was
still a worried look in his eyes and a distrait expression on his
face, and his whole appearance was slightly untidy as if he had
shaved, dressed, and brushed his hair with his mind on other
things. His grey, drooping moustache which concealed much of his
mouth, wanted trimming, and his hands were stained with nicotine.
He sat down in an easy-chair and then nervously sat bolt upright on
the edge of it.</p>

<p>"I've got one or two more questions that I must ask you, Lord
Claydon," said Fleming. "The first is this: did you take up
Newman's references?"</p>

<p>"Only the two in London. Not the Canadian ones."</p>

<p>"And the two replies were satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"They were most enthusiastic."</p>

<p>"The addresses from which they were written were empty
houses."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"The man or men who wrote those replies had got access somehow
or other to two empty houses&mdash;one in Belgrave Square and the
other in Mount Street, Mayfair."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember those were the vicinities I wrote to."</p>

<p>"And they simply burgled the two houses&mdash;got your letters
out of them and answered them."</p>

<p>"So Newman's testimonials were forged?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Lord Claydon sighed heavily. "I suppose he was after the
Treasure. It's the curse of this house."</p>

<p>"There's another question, Lord Claydon. You must excuse its
rather personal nature. Are you in financial difficulties?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Lord Claydon simply.</p>

<p>"So the discovery of the Treasure means a very great deal to
you?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it exists. I have long ago given up the idea
that it exists."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Tollemache is down here to value your pictures for the
purpose of selling them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am going to dispose of almost all my Old Masters."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Fleming, "that is all I wanted to ask just at
present."</p>

<p>"What do you make of him?" he asked, after Lord Claydon had gone
out.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth I'm not very much interested in him,"
replied Kerrigan. "It's another member of the family that I want to
know more about."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you another tip, my lad," went on Kerrigan, ignoring
the question. "There were two telephone calls put through from the
call-box at Bicester last night about half-past twelve. One was of
no importance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To your club in Davis Street," interrupted Fleming.</p>

<p>Kerrigan stared.</p>

<p>"You old fox!" he exclaimed, "do you mean to say you've got on
to those calls? What was the other one?"</p>

<p>"Ah! the other one," said Fleming thoughtfully. "The other one
was interesting. It was a lady ringing up a friend in London and
asking for a bunch of skeleton keys to be brought down here."</p>

<p>"A bunch of skeleton keys!" echoed Kerrigan. "What the devil
for?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps to open something with?"</p>

<p>"Don't try to be funny," replied Peter warmly. "I am now going
off to pursue my researches into the only member of this family
that I find intriguing. By the way, is all that you've told me
confidential?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, no! You can tell any one anything."</p>

<p>Kerrigan went out, murmuring to himself, "Now, what the blazes
did the old fox mean by that, I wonder? I must be jolly
careful."</p>

<p>He strolled through the house till he came to the billiard-room,
where he found the two girls sitting in a corner darning silk
stockings. Rosemary Shackleford looked up with a trace of animation
and said briskly, "Good morning," but the other girl frowned and
went on with her work.</p>

<p>Kerrigan sat down opposite them with the words: "Do you mind if
I watch some of the world's work in progress?"</p>

<p>Rosemary smiled and replied:</p>

<p>"Have you got your paragraphs sent off to your paper yet?"</p>

<p>Lady Pamela looked up sharply and said:</p>

<p>"If anything appears in the Press about us that we can trace to
you, I'm going to get you horsewhipped."</p>

<p>"Do you know," answered Kerrigan earnestly, "that you have
raised a point of exceptional interest to a student of progress and
evolution like myself? You want to get me horsewhipped, and I've no
doubt it would give you a very great deal of satisfaction. But I
wonder very much if there's such a thing as a horsewhip in the
whole of this establishment?"</p>

<p>Lady Pamela half turned her back on him with an angry movement.
He went on:</p>

<p>"Of course, you could get me hit over the head with a spanner,
or even tickled to death with carburettor needles, but a
horsewhipping&mdash;no. Not in this twentieth century age of
mechanics. Tell me, Lady Pamela, where can I find out more about
your fascinating ancestor who started all this trouble with his
diamonds and his what-nots?"</p>

<p>"There is a biography of him in every room in the house, I
should think," she answered coldly.</p>

<p>"And what would you say were his chief characteristics?"</p>

<p>"Why not read the book and see for yourself,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Kerrigan. Shall we take a stroll in the garden,
Rosemary?"</p>

<p>Lady Pamela got up and turned her back completely on Kerrigan.
But Miss Shackleford unexpectedly declined.</p>

<p>"No, I'm feeling lazy. I'm going to stay here."</p>

<p>Lady Pamela obviously was annoyed by this refusal, for she
answered in a voice of ice, "Very well, dear, so will I."</p>

<p>"Somehow or other," murmured Kerrigan reflectively, "Lady Pamela
manages to conceal her affection for me."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't break her heart if you left the house," said Lady
Pamela.</p>

<p>"But Fleming won't let any of us go," protested Kerrigan.</p>

<p>A quiet voice came from the doorway of the billiard-room:</p>

<p>"Any one may go who wants to. The investigation is closed."</p>

<p>Fleming could move very quietly when he wanted to. Kerrigan spun
round.</p>

<p>"Your sleuthing over?" he cried. "You have made an arrest?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. But I know all I need to know."</p>

<p>"And you're withdrawing your men?"</p>

<p>"We are leaving almost at once. The rest of my inquiry will take
place in London. Lady Pamela, perhaps you will inform the rest of
the house-party that they are free to come or go as they please;"
and with that Fleming quietly went out again.</p>

<p>Lady Pamela said sharply:</p>

<p>"Well, that settles the hash of our young gossip-writer. Out you
go."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Kerrigan, "but I must have one moment's
conversation with Miss Shackleford."</p>

<p>"Must?" said Lady Pamela, raising her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Must," replied Peter undaunted.</p>

<p>"Come out into the garden, Mr. Kerrigan," said Miss Shackleford
unexpectedly, and she led the way out.</p>

<p>The young man followed with alacrity, and when they were out of
earshot of the house, he stopped and said, "I should like to help
you."</p>

<p>She stared at him for a moment and then burst into a gay
laugh.</p>

<p>"The young knight-errant, eh? Journalist turned Galahad? I think
that's too sweet of you."</p>

<p>"Quite so," he replied imperturbably. "I've got the impression
that you need help&mdash;as well as skeleton keys."</p>

<p>The smile faded abruptly from her face.</p>

<p>"You were fifty yards down the road when I was telephoning; you
couldn't have heard me."</p>

<p>"I didn't."</p>

<p>"Have you told the Inspector?"</p>

<p>"The Inspector told me."</p>

<p>She gave him a long, searching glance. "Why did he tell you?"
she said at length. "Why are you in the confidence of the police, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>"The point is that I think you're up against trouble and I
should like to help you."</p>

<p>"The point is," she retorted, "that I don't think I want any
help, thank you; and even if I did, I'm not at all sure that you
would be a very competent helper."</p>

<p>"Give me a trial."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, no," she replied firmly. "Any one who lets George
Ilford rook him at picquet must be the biggest donkey in England.
Good-bye, Mr. Kerrigan," she held out her hand, "and give me a
little write-up occasionally in your Society Chatterings."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said. Kerrigan watched her walk
with athletic, springy step round the corner of the house, and then
he went in to look for Fleming. He was told that the Inspector had
already left for London by motor-car.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to pack his bag, being careful to
put in it a copy of the <i>Life of the eccentric Lord Claydon</i>,
and telephone to Bicester for a car to take him to the station.
Neither Lord Claydon nor any of the house-party were visible.</p>

<p>Two hours later Kerrigan drove up to Grosvenor House in a taxi,
changed into an unobtrusive suit of dark blue, put on a pair of
rubber-soled shoes, equipped himself with electric torch, flask,
sandwiches, various apparatus for picking locks, and an easily
portable rope ladder and, hiring a fast car from a firm of motor
engineers in Albemarle Street, drove himself back towards Bicester.
It was Wall Street to a dime that some sort of game would be afoot
at Marsh Manor that night.</p>

<h2 id='ch6'>VI<br>
THE SECOND MURDER</h2>

<p>Kerrigan reached a small village called Launton, a mile or two
from Bicester, at about six o'clock in the evening, and, not
wishing to arrive at the scene of action before dusk, he went into
the "Black Bull," the only public-house in the place, and ordered
some beer, and sat down in a corner of the parlour to study the
biography of the old Lord Claydon who had started all the trouble.
He was interested, not in the details of his life, but only in the
details of his character. If the treasure had not already been
found by the murderer of Newman, there was still a chance for an
intelligent man to find the secret. And Kerrigan was firmly
convinced that the best way to do that, indeed the only way to do
it, was to study the peculiarities of the man who had hidden it.
Hone had presumably succeeded in finding it, and Peter felt
strongly that what one man could do could be done again by another
man. After two hours of steady reading and intermittent
beer-drinking, he called for a pencil and piece of paper and jotted
down the main characteristics of the old gentleman so far as they
emerged in the biography, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.A very rich man who did not mind what he spent on works of
Art.</li>

<li>2.A very shrewd judge of values. Almost every picture, statue,
manuscript, gem, tapestry, and piece of stained glass which he
bought had enormously appreciated in value during the last hundred
years.</li>

<li>3.A great traveller.</li>

<li>4.A very peculiar sense of humour. For example, he had a large
and most elaborate cottage built on the estate, and then used it as
a kennel for a tiny Belgian dog which he had taken a fancy to; took
enormous delight in practical jokes, especially hoaxes that hurt
and annoyed people.</li>

<li>5.Author of several books on Art and pamphlets on
Shakespeare.</li>

<li>6.Inventing a mythical Treasure might have appealed to him as a
capital joke on posterity, but, on the other hand,</li>

<li>7.His passion for works of Art, and all beautiful things, was
something he never joked about.</li>

<li>8.Took a great pleasure in setting puzzles and traps for
people. He built a complicated maze in the park, brought Italian
workmen over to make secret panels and doors and passages in the
Manor, all of which were discovered in the course of the numerous
searches for the Treasure, and enjoyed, like a child, pressing
springs for doors or boxes to open, or mechanical toys to start
functioning.</li>

<li>9.With the exception of the famous Treasure, was never known to
conceal a work of Art however valuable it might be. He loved
showing them off and letting them lie about the house.</li>

<li>10.Intensely despised all his children for being complete
Philistines. He gave them every opportunity of travel and
education, but none of them took the slightest interest in anything
except hunting and shooting and fishing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kerrigan reread these jottings several times over. The problem
to be solved was: where would a man of that character be likely to
hide a jewel or a work of Art that was superlatively valuable? And,
incidentally, what else except jewels could be so superlatively
valuable to a man who had Titian and Rembrandt and Franz Hals and
Benvenuto Cellini all over his house?</p>

<p>It was certainly a possibility that the whole thing was a grim
hoax upon his Philistine children, and that he went happy to his
grave in the knowledge that they, who had no use for beautiful
things, should spend their lives in looking feverishly for a work
of Art that had never existed. But if this view was correct, then
what had John Hone discovered, and why had Walter Newman been
murdered? The thing was certainly worth pursuing on those grounds
alone, and at nine o'clock Kerrigan left the "Black Bull" at
Launton to continue the pursuit. He dawdled quietly along the
country lanes until he was within a mile of Marsh Manor, and then
he drove the car into a field and parked it under the concealment
of an English hedge in summer-time, and set out on foot for his
objective. Although he walked with his usual confident elasticity
of step, he did not feel at all easy in his mind about the night
before him. There were too many incalculable factors for his
liking, too many people who had a hand to play in the game. Peter
Kerrigan could be rash and reckless when it was necessary, but he
infinitely preferred to win a hand by skill and prudence than by
wild bravado. He liked to go into an adventure with his eyes open,
his plans laid, and, if possible, an avenue of retreat behind him.
But to-night he was venturing into uncharted seas, and he would
need to be even more wide awake than usual. One of the troubles
about it, of course, was the palpably obvious trap which Fleming
had laid. Fleming must have decided that the Treasure was still in
the library, and had called off his men in order to induce the
murderer to make another shot at finding it. Probably Fleming was
hiding in the library at that very moment, pistol in hand and
whistle in mouth. That part of the evening's work was more or less
plain sailing. In normal circumstances the murderer would not be
such an inconceivable ass as to fall into such a simple trap. He
would wait weeks, even months, before making another attempt. What
made the situation so complicated was that there were almost
certainly several people who wanted a few hours alone in the
library. The murderer, if Kerrigan's theory was correct, was not
the only man who knew of the existence of the Treasure. There was
John Hone, for one, and there were the members of the Claydon
family circle; however sceptical it had become after a hundred
years of fruitless search, the Claydon family must have had their
hopes of ultimate gain raised suddenly and drastically by the
murder. And it was possible, indeed probable, that the late Newman
had confederates. The result of this would naturally be that none
of the searchers could afford to run the risk of delay; it was
better to run the risk of falling into Fleming's trap than of
letting a rival steal a march. And in any case, what did the trap
amount to? To enter a library, even with intent to commit a felony,
was not proof of murder. On the other hand, Fleming was undoubtedly
a wily old fox, and there was no knowing what he might or might not
have up his sleeve. It was altogether a puzzling problem, and
Kerrigan, as he hooked his portable rope ladder on to the wall of
Marsh Manor, came to the conclusion that he had not the faintest
idea of what was likely to happen. The only thing he felt confident
about was that something or other was certain to happen.</p>

<p>He moved silently across the park until he came to the
protecting belt of wood, and, selecting a spot on the inner edge of
the wood from which he could command an excellent view of the
library, at a distance of about thirty yards, he lay down in a
conveniently soft cluster of ferns, and waited for events.</p>

<p>At about half-past ten he saw Lord Claydon come out, smoking a
cigar, and stand apparently wrapped in thought on the gravel path.
Then Sir George Ilford joined him, and they talked together for a
few moments and then went in again, and Kerrigan heard the sound of
bolts on the inside of the French window. A minute later the lights
in the drawing-room went out. It was obviously the beginning of the
retirement of the party, for it was not long before the lights in
the billiard-room and then the lights on the staircase were
extinguished one by one, until by half-past eleven there was not a
single light visible from Kerrigan's hiding-place.</p>

<p>"That's jolly fishy," murmured that gentleman into the ferns.
"Why is nobody reading in bed, and why this singular unanimity in
favour of an early night?"</p>

<p>He smiled with gentle satisfaction. His theories seemed to be
working out correctly. Every one in the house was going to bed
early, because every one wanted to be first into the library. But
each person would be certain to wait a short time&mdash;even if it
was only a quarter of an hour&mdash;before beginning operations, in
order to let the rest of the house settle down to its slumbers.
Peter Kerrigan, therefore, rose to his feet and slipped noiselessly
into the shadow of a long, rose-clad pergola and thence to the dark
lee of the library itself. It took him only a moment or two to
force up with a penknife the catch of one of the windows, hoist
himself nimbly on to the window-sill, and lower himself silently
into the library.</p>

<p>Once inside, he closed the window and crouched on the floor,
listening, listening with every ounce of tense concentration that
he was capable of mustering. For five long minutes he remained
motionless. But there was no sound in the great, dark, vaulted
library except his own soft breathing. At last he decided that it
was safe to begin creeping towards the place he had selected in his
mind for his observation post, and foot by foot he stole, on all
fours, to the spiral staircase and up it into the narrow gallery.
Once or twice the stairs creaked under his weight and each time he
stopped dead and waited for something unpleasant, such as a shout,
a light, or a pistol bullet, to happen. But nothing did happen, and
at last he reached his objective. Then with infinite care he built
up a rampart of heavy books in front of him and crouched down to
wait. "Nothing like books for stopping pistol bullets," he
reflected. And then he smiled broadly. It was one of the few
occasions in his life when he had found some use for
literature.</p>

<p>The air in the library was oppressively heavy and filled with
the musty smell of old bindings; it felt as if it had not been
changed since the library had been built by the mad old lord. It
was laden with the dust of generations and seemed to intensify the
sinister atmosphere which the murder of the librarian had created.
It was just the atmosphere for a brutal and violent murder. The
leaden stillness of it was frightening. It seemed to have enjoyed
the murder and to be waiting for another. If Peter Kerrigan had
been the sort of person who was affected by atmospheres, he would
have been exceedingly uncomfortable, if not actually frightened. As
it was, he settled himself down behind his rampart and gave himself
up to the problem of whether to wear a grey topper at the Derby or
a grey bowler. He had some time ago promised himself that when he
was really in funds again he would stand himself one or the other,
and the time had now come to carry out the promise. He was just
deciding in favour of the topper when he suddenly realised with an
abrupt and painful shock that there was some one in the library
just below him. It was the sound of a chair being moved an inch or
two on the parquet floor that warned him, and he leant forward and
stared down into the darkness. Nothing was visible, but he thought
he could just detect the occasional noise of breathing.</p>

<p>It was not the presence of some one else in the library that
gave Kerrigan such a shock. After all, it was exactly what he was
waiting for. It was the silence of the other man's entry that made
him think. He would need to be very expert in the art of moving in
the dark to make so little noise, and the more expert he was, the
more formidable an adversary he would be. But Kerrigan had not much
time for reflection, for a less expert mover-in-the-dark was
cautiously opening the door of the library, entering, and closing
it behind him. Then there was a long pause, broken only by the
sound of an occasional shuffle or crack which Kerrigan guessed to
be the rather clumsy movements of the newcomer. The first man,
immediately below him, was absolutely motionless&mdash;like a
spider who has felt the impact of the unfortunate fly against the
web. Kerrigan began to be rather sorry for the second man. He was
so obviously an amateur and the other was so obviously a
professional.</p>

<p>The heavy, musty atmosphere of the library seemed to become more
than ever sinister, and the silence seemed to be made even more
oppressively profound by the knowledge that men were lurking in the
darkness below. Kerrigan suddenly decided to create a diversion. He
took a book from the top of his rampart and threw it over the
balustrade of the balcony. It fell with a resounding crash and was
followed instantaneously by a gasp from the direction of the door.
There was not a sound from below the balcony, and Kerrigan was
immensely impressed with the nerve of the hidden watcher. The other
man, of course, was simply a mass of nerves&mdash;a man who ought
never to have undertaken an enterprise of this kind. He was
probably armed to the teeth, too, and might start banging bullets
off at any moment in any direction. That was the worst of amateurs.
They had no sort of sense when it came to an emergency.</p>

<p>The emergency arrived almost at once. A thin beam of light
suddenly sprang into existence from a point about six yards from
where Kerrigan reckoned that the professional spider was sitting,
flickered round the room, and came to rest upon the crouching
figure of Mr. Rubin near the door. Instantly Mr. Rubin straightened
himself with a hoarse cry, whipped out a pistol, and blazed off a
fusillade at the light. The fourth shot hit the globe and the light
went out. There was a moment of unearthly silence after the
clatter. And then there was a gentle laugh from under the balcony,
followed by a single shot and a heavy thud.</p>

<p>The whole thing had happened so swiftly that by comparison it
seemed hours before the main lights of the library were switched
on, and Fleming and three men in plain clothes came tearing up the
library from the far end. Actually it could not have been more than
ten seconds. But the ten seconds had been enough. Mr. Rubin lay
dead on the floor with a pistol bullet through the heart, and an
open window showed how the assassin had retreated. Fleming, pistol
in hand, was out of the window in a flash and his men tumbled out
after him.</p>

<p>The next moment there was a burst of sound as a powerful
motor-bicycle engine sprang into life with a deafening roar.</p>

<h2 id='ch7'>VII<br>
THE SAMPLER CLUE</h2>

<p>There were obviously two men concerned in it, and they vanished
into thin air, leaving few traces behind except evidence of
remarkable audacity. So far as Fleming could reconstruct it, the
sequence of events had been as follows: on the afternoon of the
same day a powerful motor-bicycle and side-car had been stolen from
the parking-place in the main square of Aylesbury. After dark, it
had been driven to some spot fairly near the entrance of Marsh
Manor, and then pushed by hand the rest of the way, through the
gates, and up to a strategic position near the library. There were
distinct traces of two different sets of footmarks beside the spot,
where a small patch of oil showed that the machine had been parked.
One man, whose feet left large imprints, had remained by the
machine and chewed gum, while the other, obviously much smaller and
lighter, entered the library. Only a second or two elapsed between
the shooting of Rubin and the starting of the engine, and the same
man could not possibly have managed both. In all probability the
machine had started before the murderer reached it and threw
himself into the side-car, so swiftly was the retreat effected.
Indeed, the whole thing was so swiftly and efficiently carried out
that Fleming never actually caught sight of either man. The outer
cordon of police, guarding the walls and gates, had been withdrawn
in order to encourage as many people as possible to walk into
Fleming's trap, and, of course, one effect of this was to enable a
fugitive who had once got clear of the house, to complete his
escape with comparative ease in the darkness; and it was fair to
presume that the raiders had known about the withdrawal of the
cordon before they took the risk of entering the grounds of the
Manor.</p>

<p>The motor-bicycle and side-car was found next day in a ditch
near Banbury.</p>

<p>During the time which elapsed between the flight of the murderer
and the return of the pursuing police-officers, Kerrigan hastily
locked the door of the library and made a quick survey of the
scene, ignoring the hammering and shouting which was soon in full
cry on the other side of the door. Rubin was stone dead. That was
obvious. He was still clutching his pistol in his hand, and the
floor beside him was littered with empty cartridges. Below the
balcony, where the single shot had been fired from, Kerrigan
thought he could detect the marks in the dust where the man had
knelt behind the desk. A large picture had been unhooked from the
wall and was lying on the desk, but Kerrigan had no means of
knowing whether the murderer had put it there or not. On the ground
lay a contrivance which particularly interested him. It was a long
flexible arm of steel, to one end of which was fixed the remains of
the shattered electric torch, and which could be expanded to a
length of about twenty-five feet or folded up till it was only a
few inches long. It reminded Kerrigan of the arms for holding
telephones which he had seen occasionally in offices, and the use
of it was perfectly clear. He had, indeed, just seen a very
convincing demonstration of its effectiveness.</p>

<p>At the far end of the library, he poked his head into the
librarian's office where the detectives had been concealed, but
there was nothing of interest there. He longed to search Rubin's
pockets, but felt that that would be going a bit too far and that
Fleming would make a real fuss about it&mdash;"and I wouldn't blame
him," he reflected with characteristic candour.</p>

<p>When the Inspector returned, he found Kerrigan seated at a
table, smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Oh, so you've come back?" he said shortly. Fleming was not in a
good temper.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm full of information&mdash;"</p>

<p>He described briefly what he had seen, while the Inspector
removed everything of interest from the dead man's pockets, and
glanced through one or two letters and papers which he found in
them. By the time he had finished, Fleming's natural good-humour
had reasserted itself.</p>

<p>"The whole thing is my fault," he observed thoughtfully. "I
completely underestimated the capabilities of the man; and yours,
too, if it comes to that. I never thought for a moment that on a
dead-calm night like this any one could break in here without my
hearing him from that end of the room; even though I did leave all
the windows on the catch and oiled all the hinges. I didn't want to
scare any one away." He looked down at the dead body. "It would
have been a good deal better for that poor fellow if I had scared
him away."</p>

<p>"I suppose Rubin killed Newman?" asked Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"Yes. I suspected him from the beginning, but I had no evidence
against him. There isn't much against him now, except perhaps
this." He held out a telegram which he had taken from Rubin's
pocket, "And this wouldn't have hanged him."</p>

<p>Kerrigan looked at it and read, "W.N. is one of D.'s men." He
nodded.</p>

<p>"I see. Some one warned him that Newman was a member of some
other troupe of humourists; Rubin slugged Newman on the head, and
another gent comes down hot-foot to settle the account with Rubin.
Perhaps it was D. himself. It's like one of those plays about
Chicago that one reads about."</p>

<p>"Both Rubin and Newman came from America," replied Fleming
significantly.</p>

<p>"So they did. And Ilford and Lord Claydon were both in America
for a good many years."</p>

<p>"Yes. And now, young Kerrigan, I've got to get to work. Run away
home, and don't do any more burglarious entries into country
houses. I ought to charge you as it is, but I'm not going
to&mdash;I'm too busy. But you've got to promise to behave."</p>

<p>"It's no good," said Kerrigan, "I don't know how."</p>

<p>"Well, one of these days you'll run up against an officer who
doesn't understand your temperament, and then you'll get into
trouble."</p>

<p>"And you'll bail me out, old chap. By the way, Fleming, was that
picture on the wall or on the desk when you were here this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I rather think on the wall. Incidentally, it isn't a picture.
It's a sampler. Don't touch it, you young fool," he added
sharply.</p>

<p>"You don't imagine," said Kerrigan, "that the man who moved
about this room like a cat, who killed Rubin, and got away under
your very nose&mdash;you don't imagine that he's left any
finger-prints lying about?"</p>

<p>"You never know. And I'm not taking any risks."</p>

<p>"All right. I won't touch it. But what the blazes did he want
with it? What is it, anyway?"</p>

<p>"It" was an old-fashioned sampler, consisting of lines of poetry
exquisitely sewn in red and blue wool on a dark-grey
background.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll tell you what this is," said Kerrigan confidently.
"It's the clue to the whereabouts of the diamonds. It's exactly
what I'm looking for."</p>

<p>Fleming smiled.</p>

<p>"It may be, or it may not be."</p>

<p>"It all depends whether some one else unhooked it and laid it on
the desk or whether our murderous friend did it. Dash it all,
Fleming. I think you might have noticed whether it was on the desk
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I might as well point out to you, before I ask you to clear
out, that it is one of a set of twenty-four samplers on the walls
of this library; and that any of the other twenty-three are just as
likely to contain the clue."</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Kerrigan, eagerly scrutinising the sampler; "but
the point is, why did the fellow unhook this one&mdash;or why did
any one else unhook this one?" He ran to where another of the set
was hanging and peered at its edges, its frame, and glass, and
finally unhooked it and examined the wall behind it.</p>

<p>"There you are!" he announced in triumph. "What did I tell you?
This one is not only twice as dusty, but the mark on the wall
behind it is twice as distinct; which means that it has hung here
much longer, and that's because old John Hone had that one down
when he was solving the key to the problem."</p>

<p>"You're an optimist," said Fleming, "and now&mdash;run
away."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to leave this house until I've had a quiet
half-hour with that sampler."</p>

<p>Fleming unlocked the door and held it open.</p>

<p>"You needn't leave the house, so far as I'm concerned. That's a
matter for you and Lord Claydon. But you're going to leave this
library."</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to withdraw gracefully, and
Kerrigan withdrew. He found the rest of the house in a turmoil of
excitement. The house-party was assembled in the drawing-room, in
varying types of dressing-gown, kimono, or overcoat, while the
passages were full of the peering white faces and round eyes of
startled domestics. Kerrigan marched boldly into the drawing-room,
and there was a dead silence as he entered. Lord Claydon, curiosity
completely overcoming astonishment and distaste, hurried forward to
greet him with a flood of excited questions. What was it all about?
Who had fired, and who at? Had anybody been hit? Was any one hurt?
What did it all mean? Where were the police?</p>

<p>Kerrigan advanced slowly, hastily revolving in his mind what he
ought to say. By the time he had reached the middle of the room he
had decided upon a policy which he thought would meet the case. He
put on a lugubrious expression, shook his head sadly several times,
and murmured, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."</p>

<p>Lord Claydon stepped back in astonishment.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>Kerrigan shook his head again and said mournfully:</p>

<p>"Mr. Rubin killed Mr. Newman, and now some one else has killed
Mr. Rubin. An eye for an eye."</p>

<p>Sir George Ilford, who had been standing by the fireplace,
meditatively, with an arm on the mantelpiece, suddenly came
forward.</p>

<p>"And who killed Rubin?" he demanded energetically. "You seem to
be a little Mister Know-all. Can you tell me that?"</p>

<p>Kerrigan had intended to keep the conversation on a melancholy
level. In the back of his mind he was toying with the idea of
claiming that one or other of the dead men was his brother, in
order to command sympathy and consideration, and, above all, an
invitation to stay on in the house. But unfortunately his sense of
humour ran away with him, and he could not resist the temptation to
exclaim, with a hearty laugh, "Who killed Cock Rubin, eh?"</p>

<p>He regretted it the moment he had said it, because it raised the
atmosphere from a suitable gloom into one of ill-suppressed relief.
It was obvious that no one felt any profound regret for the demise
of the American. Lord Claydon's tired and worried expression
relaxed, and Rosemary Shackleford laughed aloud. Only Captain
Streatfield was rather shocked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Rosemary&mdash;come," he began, but the girl cut him
short.</p>

<p>"Don't be a prude!" she exclaimed. "I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
sorry for any one that dies, but I'm not going to break my heart
over a stranger whom I didn't very much like."</p>

<p>"I think you're perfectly right," said Kerrigan approvingly.</p>

<p>There seemed to be something in his voice, or perhaps in his
very existence, that infuriated Ilford, for the huge baronet turned
on him in a flash.</p>

<p>"You just shut up," he said fiercely. "No one wants your
opinion, you damned little police-spy. The sooner you get out the
better."</p>

<p>"I was going to suggest," replied Peter imperturbably, "that the
longer I stay in, the better. In other words, as Mr. Robey would
say, that you invite me to join the house-party."</p>

<p>A moment of incredulous silence greeted this outrageous
suggestion, and then Ilford said:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!"</p>

<p>Lady Pamela merely remarked:</p>

<p>"You'd better ask Inspector Fleming if he has an official
status, dad. If he has, he can go to the servants' hall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if he hasn't," Ilford chimed in, "he can go to hell!"</p>

<p>Kerrigan saw that the tide of public opinion was running against
him. He determined on bold measures.</p>

<p>"Before you do anything rash," he said, holding up his hand as
if he was a preacher exhorting his flock, "allow me to observe that
I have no official or unofficial position&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it's outside for you, my lad," interrupted Ilford.</p>

<p>"But I do happen," went on Kerrigan, unmoved, "to be in
possession of rather an interesting piece of information. It's
about the famous Treasure."</p>

<p>Lord Claydon turned sharply.</p>

<p>"It doesn't exist. There never was such a thing."</p>

<p>The benign Mr. Tollemache, who had been sitting unobtrusively in
a corner of the room, got up at these words and came into the
circle. He was wearing an old, untidy dressing-gown and a pair of
grey woollen pyjamas and purple socks.</p>

<p>"I'm greatly interested in the Treasure," he announced in mild,
precise tones, "as indeed every one naturally is."</p>

<p>"It doesn't exist," reiterated Lord Claydon. He was a man of one
idea at a time. "If it had existed, it would have been found years
ago."</p>

<p>Mr. Tollemache looked inquiringly at Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this young gentleman can give us some further
enlightenment."</p>

<p>"I'm quite sure he can't," said Lord Claydon. Sir George Ilford
added:</p>

<p>"If he takes my advice, he'll keep his mouth shut and clear
out."</p>

<p>The two girls and Streatfield said nothing, but were watching
keenly.</p>

<p>"But I don't want to clear out," protested Kerrigan. "If there's
one person in the world who can help you to find this stuff, I'm
that very same fellow."</p>

<p>Just as Lord Claydon was hesitating over his reply, Ilford
said:</p>

<p>"Hang it all, Tom, we can't stay here all night. Give the man a
bed, and sling him out in the morning."</p>

<p>"An admirable suggestion," said the adventurer. "Suits me down
to the ground."</p>

<p>"That's lucky," replied Ilford grimly. "Come on."</p>

<p>Without waiting for a word from the owner of the house or his
daughter, Ilford marched to the door and led the way out into the
corridor. Kerrigan followed him to a spare bedroom on the first
floor and stood in silence while the other closed the shutters,
bolted them, locked the small padlock on the bolt and pocketed the
key.</p>

<p>"We don't want any more trouble to-night," he remarked
significantly. "Sleep well," and he went out and locked the door
behind him, leaving Kerrigan a prisoner.</p>

<p>About thirty seconds later Kerrigan had turned the lock of the
door with a piece of bent wire, and was peering cautiously out into
the corridor. He was just debating whether to venture out upon a
general tour of reconnaissance when he heard the sound of shuffling
and whispering upon the stairs and he hastily drew back and closed
his door. A moment or two later, Streatfield and the two girls came
in unceremoniously, almost pushing him out of the way as they did
so, and Streatfield put his back against the door and pulled a
heavy Service revolver out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"Now, Master Kerrigan, we want a few words with you," he
remarked in a dry, menacing voice. Kerrigan stared at him, trying
to estimate exactly how dangerous he might turn out to be. He was
thin and square-shouldered and broad, and, although he was not much
taller than Kerrigan himself, he looked strong and athletic. His
face, the adventurer noticed for the first time, was tanned, not
with the reddish hue of a few days in the English sun, but with the
genuine, deep, permanent tan which is only produced by a long
period in a tropical country. And people who spend long periods in
tropical countries might easily turn out to have acquired rough
ideas and efficient methods of putting their ideas into practice.
On the other hand, he might simply turn out to be the ordinary type
which goes from public-school to the army or the Indian or Colonial
Civil Service.</p>

<p>The two girls stood near the window&mdash;Lady Pamela looking at
Streatfield, Rosemary with her eyes fixed on Kerrigan. Streatfield
proceeded at once:</p>

<p>"First of all, who are you?"</p>

<p>"A rolling stone," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"H'm! Gathering any moss that comes handy, eh?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"And at the moment you're after this Treasure?"</p>

<p>"My dear Sherlock, it's a treat to watch your giant brain at
work."</p>

<p>"And you've discovered something?"</p>

<p>Kerrigan became cautious. He tapped the side of his nose with
his forefinger and said, "Ah!"</p>

<p>"We want to know what it is," went on Streatfield, "and unless
you tell us, there's going to be another shooting incident in this
house."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" murmured Kerrigan absently, "how perfectly charming!"
He was wondering what line of policy would be the most advantageous
to himself. He held a good many cards, but on the other hand the
trio which faced him held the supremely important card of entry
into the library. He himself could hardly hope to go on entering
the library an indefinite number of times by burglarious methods.
And unless he did get in, his chances of being able to go on with
the search were non-existent. He made up his mind quickly.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, ladies," he said, with his most charming
smile. "I wish I had something to offer you to drink, but I fear it
is hardly possible. It's not my house, you know," he added, with a
bow to Lady Pamela.</p>

<p>"Well, come on," said Streatfield. "Out with it."</p>

<p>"I have a business proposal to make&mdash;" began Kerrigan, but
the other cut him short.</p>

<p>"No, you haven't. We want to know what you know. That's all." He
pointed the revolver at Kerrigan's chest.</p>

<p>"Hi!" exclaimed the latter in alarm. "Look out! That beastly
thing is probably loaded."</p>

<p>"It is," was the dry answer.</p>

<p>"Well, don't point it at me. It's dangerous."</p>

<p>"It's only dangerous in the hands of people who don't know how
to use it. I do."</p>

<p>"You ought to know, Mr. Kerrigan," said Lady Pamela, "that we're
in earnest. We don't care what happens so long as we get the
diamonds."</p>

<p>Kerrigan faced her. "And why doesn't Lord Claydon want to find
them?"</p>

<p>"Of course he wants to find them."</p>

<p>"I wonder. He seems so particularly insistent that there is no
swag at all."</p>

<p>"I'm still waiting, Kerrigan," said Streatfield. "I'll give you
three minutes. After that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After that, what?"</p>

<p>"I shall be compelled to send for my man-servant. He's waiting
outside. He's a Colombian&mdash;you know&mdash;from South America.
I may as well tell you that he is devoted to me, and that
he's&mdash;er&mdash;inclined to be a little rough."</p>

<p>"No, Tom, I won't have it," cried Rosemary.</p>

<p>"You won't, but he will," was the quiet answer. Peter found
himself more and more disliking the calm competence of this
sunburnt captain.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly horrible," went on the girl, flushing up to her
magnificent hair. "You're not savages."</p>

<p>"No, but my Colombian very nearly is," replied Streatfield, and
Lady Pamela turned on Rosemary.</p>

<p>"We aren't doing this entirely for ourselves," she said.</p>

<p>"Who are you doing it for?" asked Kerrigan interestedly. "Your
dog Fido?"</p>

<p>Lady Pamela looked at him with a cold, hard expression.</p>

<p>"You won't find the Colombian quite so funny!"</p>

<p>"But I say, have you appreciated the fact that the house is
swarming with police?"</p>

<p>"You've probably had very little experience of a Colombian gag,"
murmured Streatfield, absently examining his revolver. "It's a
singularly effective silencer."</p>

<p>"The whole story, please," said Lady Pamela, "beginning at the
beginning. And please don't leave anything out or put anything in."
Her voice sounded even more formidable than Streatfield's.</p>

<p>"How are you going to tell when I'm leaving things out or
putting things in?" Kerrigan asked.</p>

<p>Streatfield replied slowly. "We know a good deal already, so
you'd better be careful. Come on, now. Time's up."</p>

<p>Kerrigan looked at him and then at Lady Pamela, and then at
Rosemary, and suddenly he felt sorry for them. They were so young
and so earnest and so exceptionally foolish. Lady Pamela no longer
looked formidable; she looked like a rather bad amateur actress.
Rosemary ought to have been asleep in bed, dreaming of
tennis-parties and dances, instead of being mixed up in childish
melodrama. Streatfield, for all his grim expression and his
sensational Colombian in the background, was a public schoolboy
trying to impress his lady-love by a show of desperate valour and
resource. Kerrigan smiled suddenly at them and sat down on the edge
of the bed.</p>

<p>"Children, children!" he said, shaking a forefinger at them.
"You're playing with fire. You're running yourselves into a
deucedly complicated and dangerous business. And not one of the
three of you is more than fifteen years old. Now don't interrupt,
but listen to your wise old Uncle Peter. This, in fact, is the
children's hour."</p>

<p>He then briefly sketched out the sequence of events which had
led him from Mr. Hone in the Euston Road to the spare bedroom in
Marsh Manor, being very careful as he went along to omit any
references to his skill at pocket-picking, at lock-turning, at
window-opening, or any other accomplishment which might make him
appear a man of knowledge and resource. They so obviously despised
him that it would be a tactical error to disillusion them. He also
forgot to mention that the man who shot Rubin had taken down the
sampler from the wall of the library.</p>

<p>At the end of his story he said:</p>

<p>"That's all. And now I suggest that we join forces and hunt for
this jolly old Treasure together."</p>

<p>Streatfield opened his eyes ostentatiously wide at this
suggestion.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary idea!" he said. "We don't in the least
want your help. We don't even want your company. If there's any
money to be got, we're going to get it."</p>

<p>"Don't forget that the Claydon family has been after it for a
hundred years," Kerrigan reminded him. "What makes you think you'll
be more successful?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind," answered Streatfield. "Come on, Pamela. Come
on, Rosemary."</p>

<p>"Then you won't combine with me?"</p>

<p>"Strange as it may seem, Mr. What's-your-name, we won't."</p>

<p>Rosemary, who had been studying Kerrigan's face intently during
his story, suddenly observed quietly:</p>

<p>"Tom, do you realise that he hasn't said a word about his clue
to the Treasure? Downstairs, he said that he had a clue."</p>

<p>"By Jove, you're right!" exclaimed Streatfield. "Come on, you
blighter&mdash;out with it!"</p>

<p>"I'll show it to you to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You'll tell it to us now."</p>

<p>"But I'm getting very sleepy."</p>

<p>"At once, please!"</p>

<p>"All right, all right. Do put that pistol down! The clue I found
was that the man who shot Mr. Rubin was disturbed while looking at
one of those samplers on the wall."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't describe which one, but I could point it out to you
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Come and point it out now."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. The library is full of police."</p>

<p>Streatfield seemed to see the force of this objection.</p>

<p>"All right. To-morrow, as soon as we can get into the library,
you'll show it to us. Don't forget. And, mind, no
tricks&mdash;or&mdash;" He left the threat unfinished, opened the
door and stood aside for the girls to go out.</p>

<p>"Au revoir, fair ladies," said Kerrigan. Lady Pamela walked out
as if he did not exist, but Rosemary turned her head and looked at
him curiously for a moment. She seemed to be puzzled by something
about him. Streatfield, before going out, marched across the room
and tested the padlock of the shutters.</p>

<p>"Have you got the key?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No. The amiable baronet trousered it after telling me a bedtime
story and kissing me good-night."</p>

<p>"Did he lock the door too?"</p>

<p>"He tried to," replied Kerrigan blandly, "but I don't think the
lock works very well. Here is the key."</p>

<p>Streatfield tested it. "Seems to work all right," he muttered
and, going out, he locked the door and went off down the
passage.</p>

<p>It was one of Peter Kerrigan's weaknesses that he could never
resist the temptation to try to be funny. He would spend days
laboriously building up a fictitious reputation and would then
demolish it all in a moment by some idiotic and irresistible joke.
The instant that Streatfield locked the door, the temptation surged
up. In the twinkling of an eye he seized his bent wire again,
unlocked the door, rolled a towel up into a ball, held it for a
moment in the jug of cold water, and got into the corridor just in
time to catch Streatfield on the back of the neck with a long shot
as he turned the corner of the corridor. By the time Streatfield
was hammering on the door, it was locked once again, and Kerrigan
was vehemently protesting his innocence of the outrage.</p>

<p>His night's sleep was short, but it was very sweet.</p>

<h2 id='ch8'>VIII<br>
LADY CAROLINE</h2>

<p>At nine o'clock next morning the door of the bedroom was
unlocked, and an extraordinary-looking man, who was obviously the
Colombian man-servant, came in, carrying a breakfast-tray. He was
very short and square, so square as to be almost deformed, and he
was bow-legged. His arms were long and powerful and his depth of
chest was remarkable. Black hair, close cropped, heavy black
eyebrows, and a dark skin completed a singularly repulsive picture.
Kerrigan blinked, and then sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Tarzan," he observed at length, "so you've weighed in
with the morning coco-nuts, eh? And how are things in the
jungle?"</p>

<p>The man answered with a flood of Spanish and scowled. Kerrigan,
who wasn't going to give away the fact that he once spent a hectic
year in Venezuela and spoke Spanish perfectly, lay back and
murmured genially, "Well, you are an ugly swob and no mistake."</p>

<p>The Colombian knew enough English to understand this, and to
reply, "You laugh other side of your face soon!"</p>

<p>"Leave me, laddie, leave me," said Peter, waving to the door.
"The sight of you is bad for the appetite. And, by the way, be a
good little Seor and borrow me a razor."</p>

<p>"I shave you myself," suggested the man unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"You do nothing of the kind!" Kerrigan retorted with
emphasis.</p>

<p>An hour later the young man once again picked the lock of his
bedroom door, and strolled downstairs. Streatfield met him in the
hall and stared. Kerrigan patted him on the shoulder in a kindly
way.</p>

<p>"It was a faulty lock, old chap. I told you it was. I hope you
slept well."</p>

<p>He strolled past him into the drawing-room and found Pamela
talking to a new addition to the party: a venerable and rather
severe-looking old lady, dressed in rustling black, and hung about
with jet ornaments. Lord Claydon was standing uncomfortably in the
background. Pamela started and frowned at the young man's
entrance.</p>

<p>Streatfield, who had followed him, called out over his shoulder,
"He's got out, somehow. But it's all right. I'll take care of him."
He added in a venomous undertone and with an apprehensive glance at
the old lady, "You come right out of here."</p>

<p>Kerrigan smiled, went forward, and bowed to Lady Pamela.</p>

<p>"I trust you had a quiet and pleasant night."</p>

<p>"Who is this, who is this?" exclaimed the old lady, fumbling for
her lorgnette.</p>

<p>"It isn't any one, Aunt Caroline, it's just a&mdash;just
a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Insurance agent," said Streatfield, from behind.</p>

<p>"You mustn't listen to old Tom Streatfield," said Kerrigan with
an easy laugh. "That's his idea of a joke."</p>

<p>The old lady found and adjusted her glasses, examined the young
man through them, and said to Pamela at the same time:</p>

<p>"Well, child, where are your manners, where are your manners?
Introduce him to me."</p>

<p>"He isn't the sort of person that one introduces," replied Lady
Pamela coldly.</p>

<p>The venerable lady turned upon her.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask you what sort of a person he is," she said in a
voice that made Pamela's sound almost cordial. "I told you to
introduce him."</p>

<p>The girl's pretty face grew dark and sulky as she muttered:</p>

<p>"Mr. Costigan&mdash;my aunt&mdash;Lady Caroline Marsh."</p>

<p>"Kerrigan, not Costigan," he corrected cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Is your hair artificially waved, or is it naturally wavy, young
man?" demanded the dame.</p>

<p>"It's the same as yours, madam&mdash;naturally wavy."</p>

<p>Lady Caroline was somewhat taken aback by this reply, and
renewed her scrutiny with her glasses.</p>

<p>"I gather from the singularly unpleasant look upon my niece's
face," resumed the old lady, "that you are not exactly <i>persona
grata</i> here. Why is that? Are you a tradesman, or merely a poor
man. You have the appearance of being a gentleman."</p>

<p>"That is one of the first things they teach us nowadays at
Borstal," replied Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"Why don't they like you?" persisted Lady Caroline.</p>

<p>Streatfield started to say something about a misapprehension,
and was sternly informed that his opinion would be welcome when
asked for, but not a moment sooner.</p>

<p>"I can't make it out," replied Kerrigan. "I'm far and away the
most amusing person in the house. I'm brimful with anecdotes about
leading personages in all the capitals of Europe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Scandalous anecdotes?" interrupted the old lady.</p>

<p>"Highly scandalous, madam. Not fit for your ears, I can assure
you."</p>

<p>"Harry!" she cried, wheeling imperiously upon Lord Claydon, "I
insist upon Mr. Cartwright&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kerrigan."</p>

<p>"Taking me in to dinner to-night."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Caroline," replied Lord Claydon, "you don't
understand the circumstances. Mr. Kerrigan isn't even staying in
the house. I don't know anything about him."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Stuff and nonsense. I understand this, that two men have
been murdered in this house within forty-eight hours of each other,
that you are trying to sell the family pictures&mdash;which is a
downright, damnable scandal&mdash;and that I've got to spend the
next day or two here finding out what's at the bottom of it all,
and that I insist upon Mr. Kerosene&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kerrigan."</p>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. being invited to stay and entertain me.
Otherwise I shall be bored to death by these thick-headed children,
and glowered at by that intolerable George Ilford."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted if Mr. Kerrigan would stay," said his
lordship gloomily.</p>

<p>"It's quite out of the question," said Pamela.</p>

<p>"Impossible." Streatfield shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p>"I accept your invitation with the greatest pleasure," remarked
Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"Capital!" exclaimed the old lady vigorously. "Then that's
settled. And now sit down here, Mr. Kerrigan&mdash;got it at
last!&mdash;and talk to me. Tell me about some of these capitals of
Europe. Were you ever in Petersburg?"</p>

<p>"I was at school at Petersburg Academy. I was sacked after one
term."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, no! Come, come!" expostulated Lady Caroline. "You
can't expect me to believe that!"</p>

<p>"It's quite true. It was in 1911."</p>

<p>"I was there nearly fifty years ago. My husband was ambassador.
It was a lovely city. Ah! what times we had!"</p>

<p>"You must have been the toast of the town," said Kerrigan with a
courtly bow. The old lady rapped him on the hand with her lorgnette
and almost giggled. Lady Pamela walked out of the room indignantly,
with Streatfield at her heels.</p>

<p>"Impertinent baggage!" exclaimed Lady Caroline. "You ought to
spank her, Harry."</p>

<p>"Yes, quite so, quite so," murmured Lord Claydon, and he also
went out.</p>

<p>The old lady's demeanour changed abruptly. She leant forward and
whispered:</p>

<p>"What's up here? The whole place is at sixes and sevens."</p>

<p>"I can't make it out," Kerrigan whispered back. "But I know
this, it's more than the murders. There's something else."</p>

<p>"Why should Harry be selling the pictures?" Lady Caroline hissed
at him. "He was left three-quarters of a million, and he's lived
quietly. And what is Ilford doing here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about him."</p>

<p>"He's a bad lot, but he's as thick as thieves with Harry. Always
has been."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the money for the pictures is going to Ilford?"</p>

<p>"Can't be that. If Ilford wanted money to get him out of one of
his scrapes, Harry would give it to him in cash. He's got
plenty."</p>

<p>Lady Caroline leant back and gazed at the ceiling for a moment.
Then she fixed the young man with a hawk-like glance and said:</p>

<p>"And where do you come in? Police?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm on my own."</p>

<p>She looked at him again and then snapped:</p>

<p>"Rosemary?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. There was another pause, followed by:</p>

<p>"Adventurer, eh?"</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan was a little startled by the old dame's
shrewdness, especially as she followed up the thrust with
another.</p>

<p>"After the Claydon Treasure, I suppose. Do you think you'll get
it?"</p>

<p>"If it exists."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By using my brains."</p>

<p>She scrutinised him very carefully once again and said:</p>

<p>"You're frank, anyway. Well, your only chance of finding it is
to stay in the house."</p>

<p>"Lady Caroline, you are a confoundedly sharp old party," said
Kerrigan, and the old lady screamed with delighted laughter.</p>

<p>"And every one else wants to chuck you out, and that's why
they're so furious at my asking you to stay, and that's why you
jumped at my invitation with such alacrity."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship goes right up to the top of the class!"</p>

<p>"Very well, Master Kerrigan. You're at my mercy. I'll make a
bargain with you. Find the Treasure for me, and I'll give you
one-tenth of it, for yourself."</p>

<p>Peter threw up his hands indignantly.</p>

<p>"One-tenth! Oh, most generous lady!"</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll make it a fifth."</p>

<p>"I would suggest half and half."</p>

<p>"Oh, you would, would you!" replied Lady Caroline with spirit.
"A fifth, or nothing. Don't you see, my man, that without me you're
useless? You'd go out of the front door this minute. But I'm not
quite useless without you. I've got some brains of my own."</p>

<p>"Let's make it a quarter," said Kerrigan, seeing immediately the
force of her argument.</p>

<p>"You're a greedy young hound; very well, we'll make it a
quarter. And mind you play fair or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll play fair," he assured her, but her shrewd old eyes
twinkled with scepticism.</p>

<p>"I think you will while I'm watching you. But I wouldn't trust
you an inch out of my sight. What's the next move, young man?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be done until the police leave the library.
I don't know if the Treasure is there. But I am certain that the
clue to its whereabouts is there. By the way, Lady Caroline, what
do you think of Captain Tom Streatfield? Is he on the level? I
mean, is he straight, or is he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Another old Borstalian, eh?" Lady Caroline finished the
sentence for him with a flicker of an ancient eyelid that was
suspiciously like a wink. "I don't know anything about him," she
went on. "He's engaged to Pamela, and so far as I'm concerned, he's
welcome to her. She's a spoilt brat."</p>

<p>"We must keep an eye on him," said Peter. "He's after the
Treasure, too, and he's got a man-servant that has dropped straight
out of the primeval jungle."</p>

<p>The door opened and Mr. Tollemache mooned benevolently into the
room and bowed to Lady Caroline, who replied with a grim nod.</p>

<p>"A terrible, terrible business," the art-valuer said, wringing
his hands nervously. "A second murder in such a short space of
time. And such a nice man, such a very nice man. Why, only last
night I was inviting him to come and see my small collection of Old
Masters in London. Poor man! Poor, poor man!"</p>

<p>"Talking of Old Masters," said Lady Caroline with
asperity&mdash;"who is going to buy my brother's collection?"</p>

<p>"I have found a buyer. I have my own humble little way of
finding buyers, but sometimes they are successful. And in this case
I am happy to say, I have found one who is willing to pay a good
price for the chief pictures."</p>

<p>"What do you call a good price?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I am not at liberty to say. It is a matter of
professional etiquette, you understand. Lady Caroline, may I have a
word with you? If possible, alone?"</p>

<p>"Don't mind Mr. Kerrigan. He's my secretary. Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, it is great intrusiveness on my part, meddling in a
strictly family affair. But it did occur to me that a solution of
Lord Claydon's financial troubles is to be found in the famous
Claydon Treasure."</p>

<p>"First find the Treasure," put in the old lady dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh, exactly, exactly." Mr. Tollemache was very shy and nervous.
"But what I was about to suggest is that we should all pool our
brains and our ideas and help Lord Claydon to find it. I would be
only too glad to do anything I can to assist."</p>

<p>"And what use would you be?" inquired Lady Caroline with brutal
directness.</p>

<p>Mr. Tollemache was flustered.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;thought that the Treasure might be a picture
or a diamond or something that I'm accustomed to handling," he
murmured disjointedly.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Lady Caroline briskly, "if we want your
help we'll let you know. Many thanks. Many thanks. And now, Mr.
Kerrigan, give me your arm. I'm going to sit in the summer-house."
They went out, leaving the art-valuer behind them.</p>

<p>"Now what did he want?" asked the old lady, as soon as they were
out of earshot.</p>

<p>"I'm not very sure," said Kerrigan slowly, "I haven't paid much
attention to Comrade Tollemache up to now. Apparently he's a
well-known art-collector and what not. Inspector Fleming verified
his <i>bona fides</i>."</p>

<p>"His <i>bona fides</i> as an art-collector," said Lady Caroline
sharply, "is one thing. His methods of collecting might be another.
For all we know he may be a picture-thief."</p>

<p>"But not a murderer," protested Kerrigan. "Surely that
grey-haired old dodderer doesn't sneak about at nights with guns
and stuffed eel-skins!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what a stuffed eel-skin is, and I don't think I
want to know. Now, wrap that rug round my feet, and hand me that
book and go away. Come back the moment it is possible to get into
the library."</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan settled his new patroness into a long chair and
went off in search of Inspector Fleming, reflecting as he went that
the bargain he had made with Lady Caroline was probably the best
thing he could have done in the circumstances. It was exasperating
to have to promise to take only one quarter of the loot, but the
philosophical way of regarding it was to remember that he was lucky
to be inside Marsh Manor at all.</p>

<p>He found Fleming once more packing up to leave.</p>

<p>"A genuine departure this time," the Inspector said with a grin.
"I've no doubt whatever that Rubin killed Newman, and that the man
who killed Rubin has got away from here. So I've got to get away
from here too."</p>

<p>"What about the Colombian nightmare?" asked Kerrigan casually.
"You don't think he had a hand in any of it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe aye and maybe no," was the non-committal answer. "In any
case I know where to lay my hands on him when I want him."</p>

<p>"So you're really off?"</p>

<p>"I'm really off. You'll be wanted at the inquest, of course.
I'll see you there. By the way, when you explain to the Coroner how
you broke in last night, you may find the local cops slipping after
you with warrants. So you'd better look out. I should be sorry to
see you get thirty days; when you ultimately fetch up in jail, it
ought to be for fifteen years at least."</p>

<p>As soon as Fleming and his assistants had departed, Kerrigan ran
to the summer-house, awoke Lady Caroline, and conducted her to the
library. The door was locked on the inside, and there was the sound
of voices from within.</p>

<p>"Who's in there?" screamed the old lady through the keyhole.
"Open the door this very instant."</p>

<p>The voices immediately stopped and there was silence inside.
Lady Caroline repeated her shrill and vehement demands, beating
upon the panels with a stick as she did so. Finally Pamela's cold,
hard voice came from within.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, Aunt Caroline, but we're busy."</p>

<p>Streatfield's voice added, "Kerrigan, don't waste time picking
the lock. There's a good stout bolt on this side of the door!"</p>

<p>"Come round and break a window," urged the old lady in a
whisper. But her voice was more penetrating than she intended, for
Streatfield replied at once, "I'm afraid we've got them all
shuttered, Lady Caroline. We're going to be here for some
time."</p>

<p>The fiery blood of a hundred earls started into the wrinkled
face of her venerable ladyship and her eyes sparkled with indignant
fires. She was just about to launch more screams through the
keyhole, when her new secretary held up a restraining finger and
beckoned her back along the passage.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" she demanded. "If you've got an idea in your
head, let's have it. Come on, man, come on."</p>

<p>"If they've got all the shutters up," whispered Kerrigan, "all
we've got to do is to find the main electric-light switch and turn
it off. They'll hate treasure-hunting in the dark."</p>

<p>Lady Caroline's fury gave way to a cackle of delighted laughter
which echoed down the corridor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crawshawe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kerrigan."</p>

<p>"Look here, young man," she exclaimed peremptorily, "I will not
be interrupted and corrected by a whipper-snapper like you all the
time. What's your Christian name?"</p>

<p>"Peter."</p>

<p>"Very well, Peter, you're an unmannerly lout to keep on
interrupting an old woman, but that's a good idea of yours about
the switch."</p>

<p>"I'll go and turn it off." The lapel of his coat was grasped by
a small, plump, ring-bedecked hand.</p>

<p>"Stay here, you young donkey. I'll turn the switch off. You must
wait to see what they do. They'll either open the door or a
shutter," and with that she marched off down the corridor,
chuckling with elderly glee as she went.</p>

<p>Two or three minutes later a chorus of "Oh's!" from the library
indicated that she had not taken very long to carry out her part in
the manoeuvre.</p>

<p>Then there was a long pause. Kerrigan, kneeling with his ear and
eye alternately to the keyhole, could hear the muttered sounds of a
council of war, and he was suffering from pins-and-needles and
incipient cramp before he saw a thin ray of light from the
direction of the windows, and knew that a shutter had been opened.
He ran out into the garden, found the window that had been
unbarred, flattened his nose against the glass, and started when he
saw the ugly face of the half-deformed Colombian glaring at him
from a distance of about two inches. The man was holding an
unpleasant-looking knife in his right hand. Kerrigan stooped,
heaved up a large stone from a rockery which happened to be at his
feet, and discharged it accurately through the window-pane into the
Colombian's face. The latter fell back with a howl of rage, and
Kerrigan poked his head carefully through the hole in the glass and
said:</p>

<p>"What cheer, chaps? Have you found the boodle?"</p>

<p>The Colombian, with blood streaming down his face and a flood of
Spanish oaths streaming from his lips, stood waving his knife like
a maniac and was only calmed by a curt order in Spanish from his
master, who came up to the window and said quietly to Peter:</p>

<p>"You're not doing yourself any good by these antics, you know.
You'd very much better go away before anything serious happens to
you. It's been a nasty house for accidents lately."</p>

<p>Streatfield looked very cool and very self-confident as he
spoke, and again Peter had the feeling that he and his weird
man-servant, though not conspicuously endowed with brains, would be
a very awkward pair to meet in a rough-and-tumble on a dark night
in an out-of-the-way spot. Rosemary Shackleford looked over his
shoulder, and asked:</p>

<p>"Which of the samplers was it, Mr. Kerrigan?"</p>

<p>"Let me in and I'll show you."</p>

<p>"Not blooming likely!" she replied gracefully.</p>

<p>"Then I'm afraid you'll just have to guess."</p>

<p>This conversation was interrupted by the appearance on the lawn
of Sir George Ilford and Lord Claydon. During the brief exchanges
which followed it was the dark baronet who did all the talking,
while Lord Claydon stared at the ground and kicked at stray
fir-cones.</p>

<p>"What's up?" demanded Ilford. "Lady Caroline says that there's
some sort of shindy going on."</p>

<p>Kerrigan withdrew his head from the jagged hole in the glass and
replied:</p>

<p>"It's only the Treasure-hunt, old chap. Streatfield's digging
away like mad in the library, and Tarzan's on duty at the window.
The glass broke," he added, "when Tarzan went too close to it."</p>

<p>"Damnation!" exclaimed Ilford, and he thrust his head through
the hole and shouted, "Streatfield, you damnable fool! Who the
devil asked you to butt in here?"</p>

<p>Streatfield answered coolly:</p>

<p>"And who the devil asked <i>you</i> to butt in here?"</p>

<p>"Lord Claydon did, and he happens to be the owner of this house.
There isn't a Claydon Treasure, and even if there was, he wouldn't
want you to look for it. Do you understand that?"</p>

<p>"Pamela wants me to find it, and I'm going to. Do you understand
that?"</p>

<p>"Your turn, Sir George!" said Kerrigan, but the other did not
hear him.</p>

<p>"Well, just listen to this," he was saying. "You clear out of
this library, and don't worry Lord Claydon any more. He's got quite
enough to worry him without all this." Ilford's great dark head
came out of the hole and he addressed Kerrigan. "And the same thing
applies to you as well."</p>

<p>"And to me as well?" said a mild voice behind them, and they all
wheeled round to find that little Mr. Tollemache had unobtrusively
joined the party. Lord Claydon turned away from him and walked
across the lawn, as if the reminder of the impending sale of his
art-treasures was more than he could stand.</p>

<p>"Yes, you as well," replied Ilford moodily.</p>

<p>"My own impression," said the little art-collector sunnily, "is
that the famous Treasure is a picture or set of pictures of
magnificence surpassing any that exist to-day&mdash;a collection,
for instance, of Michael Angelo's lost cartoons, or unknown
portraits by Velasquez, or pictures of Ver Meer of Delft. Even if I
am wrong in holding this view, surely the bare possibility that I
might be right is enough to justify every man and woman in
prosecuting this search to the very utmost of their ability. It is
a duty which is owed to mankind, in the sacred name of Art."</p>

<p>"In the sacred name of drivel and balderdash," replied Ilford
furiously. The timid Mr. Tollemache shrank away from the big man's
menacing tone and murmured something apologetic about being
extremely sorry if he had said anything which upset any one. Ilford
swung round with an impatient snarl, and strode after the receding
figure of Lord Claydon, leaving Mr. Tollemache to appeal to
Kerrigan against the injustice of the way in which his innocent
remarks had been taken up. The latter looked at him
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, it certainly was odd," he said slowly; "very odd
indeed."</p>

<p>He turned to see what the party in the library was doing, and
saw that the door was standing wide open and the library was empty.
They had taken advantage of the diversion created by Mr. Tollemache
to beat a retreat. Kerrigan raced round the house and dashed into
the library. All the samplers had been taken off the walls and a
heap of empty frames lay on one of the tables. A fanfare of an
electric horn made him look up just in time to see Streatfield and
the two girls, and the Colombian man-servant, tearing down the
avenue in a huge, pale-blue Bentley.</p>

<h2 id='ch9'>IX<br>
THE MISSING BOOK</h2>

<p>Kerrigan was still watching the gap in the trees through which
the Bentley had vanished several seconds before, when Lady Caroline
tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, so they've gone," she said. "Why?"</p>

<p>"It's all my fault," replied Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask whose fault it was. I asked why they've gone."</p>

<p>"Because they've got the samplers, and I suppose they've taken
them away to some place where they can examine them at
leisure."</p>

<p>"The samplers?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The man who murdered Rubin last night was examining one of
them when he was interrupted. I told that bright young party that
one of the twenty-four held the clue, but I didn't tell them which
of the twenty-four it was; and in any case, I never dreamt that
they would get in ahead of me. I completely underestimated
Streatfield's resourcefulness."</p>

<p>"Streatfield's resourcefulness?" said the old woman scornfully.
"The brains of the party is in that red-haired girl's head. She's
as artful as a sack of weasels."</p>

<p>"The point is, what are we to do next?" replied Kerrigan,
thinking very hard. "There are very odd things about this whole
business. Why is Lord Claydon so very anxious that the Treasure
should not be discovered? If he's as hard up as he appears to
be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's not hard up at all," snapped Lady Caroline.</p>

<p>"But he's selling the pictures!"</p>

<p>"It's my opinion that the man's mad."</p>

<p>"It might be that he really has lost a very great deal of money
and that he's already found and sold the family Treasure. That
would account for his not wanting us or Streatfield to go on
looking for it."</p>

<p>"Stop these idle speculations, young man, and tell me which of
the samplers contains the clue."</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you which one it was, Lady Caroline. I could
only show you where it hung in the library, and that isn't much
good."</p>

<p>"Come and show me," ordered Lady Caroline, and they went into
the ill-omened room. Kerrigan pointed out the place where the
sampler had hung. Lady Caroline pursed up her thin dry lips and
looked with bright, bird-like glances up and down the walls,
counting aloud, "one, two," up to six&mdash;over and over again.
Finally she said, "I can whittle it down to one out of six. Those
samplers were put up by the mad Lord Claydon about the same time as
he built this library, and they were in sets of six, four sets of
six each. One set was quotations from <i>Hamlet</i>, one from
<i>Macbeth</i>, one from <i>Lear</i>, and one from <i>Othello</i>.
This must have been one of the <i>Hamlet</i> set. I remember they
started at that window there."</p>

<p>"When you say <i>Hamlet</i> and all the rest of it," said
Kerrigan diffidently, "do you mean the stuff that Shakespeare
wrote?"</p>

<p>Lady Caroline fumbled for her lorgnette and gazed at him with
the utmost astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do mean the stuff that Shakespeare wrote."</p>

<p>"I thought you probably did. I'm not much of a reader myself.
It's generally thought to be pretty high-class, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> generally thought to be pretty high-class,"
conceded Lady Caroline grimly.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, dear!" said the mild voice of Mr. Tollemache behind
them. "What a scene of destruction and desolation! Who on earth has
been cutting those charming Georgian samplers out of their frames?
What Philistine has done this thing? If it was poor Mr. Rubin, I
can almost sympathise with the man who shot him, though I
fear&mdash;ahem!&mdash;that that is rather an irreverent thing to
say. <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>, so to speak."</p>

<p>Lady Caroline, whose lorgnettes were now in full blast, turned
them upon him with cold dignity.</p>

<p>"Quite so," she observed, and turned again to her new
secretary.</p>

<p>But Mr. Tollemache was undaunted by the obviousness of the snub.
He was already examining the heap of frames with the close, peering
scrutiny of the connoisseur.</p>

<p>"Fine old Georgian frames," he murmured, "but sadly pock-marked
a long time ago by some scoundrel with a bodkin or some such
instrument." He picked up one of them and swung it backwards and
forwards. "Heavy things; no wonder the thief preferred to cut out
the samplers and leave the frames."</p>

<p>"Were the samplers valuable?" asked Kerrigan sharply.</p>

<p>Mr. Tollemache smiled a benignant smile.</p>

<p>"I would have offered a hundred pounds for the lot, if Lord
Claydon had wanted to dispose of them. But perhaps a hundred
guineas would have been nearer the mark. I am not sure," and the
old man drifted out again aimlessly.</p>

<p>Kerrigan waited till he had gone and then said:</p>

<p>"If the value is not in the samplers as samplers, nor in the
pock-marked frames&mdash;by the way, I wonder why the bodkin-holes
in them? Oh yes, of course; some earlier generation of
treasure-hunters&mdash;it must be something hidden between a
sampler and the frame&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course not!" interrupted Lady Caroline indignantly. "Don't
be so silly. If it had been that, why do you suppose they would
have taken away all the samplers? And besides, it would have been
found ages ago!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon, Lady C. Of course, you're
right."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Of course I am."</p>

<p>"So the quotations must contain the clue. That's the only
alternative left. And that blighter Streatfield has the quotations.
Well, the only thing to do is to get after him. That blue Bentley
is a fairly conspicuous car; it ought to be easy enough to
follow."</p>

<p>"Would it not be as well to inquire," suggested Lady Caroline
with a meekness that contrasted most suspiciously with her usual
aggressive briskness, "whether copies of the samplers exist?"</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan looked sharply at her and then observed with a
laugh:</p>

<p>"Come on, now, Lady Machiavelli, out with it. Where are the
copies?"</p>

<p>"How dare you address me so impertinently? Do you hear? As a
matter of fact," she went on with another of her elderly chuckles,
"there used to be drawings of them in a large album somewhere.
Harry will know where it is."</p>

<p>"Will you ask him where it is, Lady Mac? It would come better
from you than from me."</p>

<p>"Lady Mac? What new impertinence is this? Oh, I see! You young
ruffian. Very well, I'll go and ask him. You wait here. I suppose
that even you can see the significance of the existence of a book
of copies of a lot of old samplers that aren't worth more than a
hundred guineas to-day, and couldn't have been worth more than a
hundred pence then." She shuffled out briskly, and Kerrigan could
hear her chuckle as she went and exclaim, "Lady Mac indeed! I'll
Lady Mac him!"</p>

<p>Sir George Ilford must have been waiting for an opportunity to
speak to Kerrigan, for the moment the old lady had gone he appeared
with all the well-timed promptness of a stage entry. He seemed to
be in a great hurry and his long strides were even longer than
usual.</p>

<p>"Look here, Kerrigan," he began at once, "this is all very
unfortunate for Claydon. He's asked me to talk to you about it.
Strict confidence and all that. Understand?"</p>

<p>"I shall have to use my own discretion about that," said Peter.
"I'm not going to promise anything."</p>

<p>Ilford considered this reply for a moment and then said:</p>

<p>"Very well, damn it, it can't be helped. Look here, it's about
this infernal treasure-hunting of yours and old Lady C. and that
triple-dyed fool Streatfield. One of you will go and find it, and
that will be the ruin of Claydon."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he's been doing some damned silly speculating and has
got himself into an almighty hole and owes a packet. I can tell
you, he absolutely owes a packet. The result is that all his
pictures have got to go. But I've worked out an arrangement with
his creditors by which they'll take part of the debt in cash, part
of it in pictures, and let the rest go hang. In other words, they
don't want to bankrupt Claydon and smash him altogether. The
agreement is all fixed up and it will be signed in a couple of
days. But if the creditors hear that a great wad of diamonds has
turned up, they'll want to grab them to cover the rest of the debt.
It wouldn't be human nature not to. After all, they'd be theirs
morally as well as legally. D'you see?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied Kerrigan cautiously. There was no
point in appearing to be particularly intelligent.</p>

<p>Ilford was inclined to be impatient.</p>

<p>"I should have thought that it was as plain as a pikestaff," he
exclaimed. "Don't go ferreting about for the diamonds until the day
after to-morrow when the agreement is signed. That's what I'm
driving at. If you were a brainy sort of chap I wouldn't mind so
much. Brainy chaps have been on the game for a hundred years or so.
But it's just your type of blithering fool that blunders on to a
thing like this."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," murmured Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"Don't try to be sarcastic with me," said Ilford simply. "I
don't like sarcasm. And as I am about a foot taller than you are,
and at least four stone heavier, I am in a very good position to
enforce a certain amount of respect from you."</p>

<p>"But you have my respect without having to get it by force."
Kerrigan tried to look nervous and frightened. Ilford took a step
towards him, and said:</p>

<p>"You've got it clear, eh? No monkey-tricks now."</p>

<p>Peter, sternly resisting the temptation to fetch the truculent
baronet a quick punch in the middle of the waistcoat, asked
meekly:</p>

<p>"What about Streatfield and his Jeeves?"</p>

<p>"His what?"</p>

<p>"His gentleman's personal gentleman. Tarzan. Mowgli. The Boston
Tar-Baby. You know who I mean. How are you going to stop them going
on with the hunt? Not to mention the thug who pipped off Rubin, and
any counter-thugs that may have been supporting the late
Rubin."</p>

<p>"All you need concern yourself with, sir," replied Ilford
coldly, "is your own inaction. I can look after the rest without
your kind assistance."</p>

<p>He marched towards the door and was just going out when Kerrigan
tried a chance shot.</p>

<p>"Can you look after Mr. Tollemache? He seems an inquisitive old
bird."</p>

<p>The effect of this simple question was electrical. Sir George
Ilford came striding back, his fist clenched, his face dark, and
the veins throbbing on his forehead.</p>

<p>"What exactly do you mean by that?" he asked with dangerous
quietness.</p>

<p>Kerrigan managed to work up a very passable imitation of a
frightened giggle.</p>

<p>"Oh, as a matter of fact, of course," he stammered, "I didn't
mean anything. It was just so funny to imagine poor old Tollemache
standing up against you. That was all."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. That was all, was it? Very well." He turned and went
out again, leaving a thoughtful man behind him.</p>

<p>Presently Lady Caroline came back. She also had a thoughtful
expression on her ancient countenance.</p>

<p>"There are too many starters in this race," she observed,
closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we're odds-on favourites," replied Peter.</p>

<p>"I've forgotten what that means," replied Lady Caroline with a
sigh. "It's nearly thirty years since I last went to the
Derby."</p>

<p>"May I have the honour of escorting you to it next week?"</p>

<p>Her eyes lit up. "I might think of it. I might certainly think
of it. 'Tough Egg' is favourite, I think you said?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't me who said that, Lady Caroline. It must have been
some one else you were discussing it with."</p>

<p>"Silence, this instant. To business. Harry told me where the
book is; he also told me that that nasty little art-collector had
asked him the same question not half a minute earlier."</p>

<p>"Is the book in here?" exclaimed Kerrigan quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Harry says if it's anywhere it's here. We can look it up
in the catalogue."</p>

<p>"Whew! That's a good job. Tollemache hasn't been back. Now it's
our turn to hold the fortress."</p>

<p>The catalogue&mdash;a massive book with vellum cover and steel
clasps&mdash;announced that "Samplers, the Claydon, Drawings of,"
resided habitually upon Shelf 61B., and Kerrigan put a step-ladder
in front of Bookcase Number 61, and climbed up to Shelf B., Lady
Caroline eagerly screaming instructions and advice from below.</p>

<p>But "Samplers, the Claydon, Drawings of," was not upon Shelf B.,
nor upon any other shelf in Bookcase 61. Kerrigan descended the
ladder and said, "That's that."</p>

<p>Lady Caroline tapped her teeth with her lorgnette and replied,
"It certainly would seem so."</p>

<p>"This requires long and careful thought," went on Peter. "Oh no,
it doesn't," he added with sudden briskness. "It's as plain as a
pikestaff. Every one that has made a recent dart at the Treasure
has gone for the samplers themselves; that is to say, they either
did not know of the existence of the book&mdash;in which case they
couldn't have taken it away&mdash;or else they knew it was already
gone. But one gentleman had any amount of leisure in this library
to find it and use it, and any amount of opportunity to take it
away with him, and that is Mr. Hone, ex-librarian. In fact, I
shouldn't be surprised if it was the finding of that book that put
him on to the scent in the beginning. In any case, after he had
solved the problem he wasn't going to run the risk of any one else
finding the book, so he carted it away with him."</p>

<p>"Or else hid it somewhere else in the library," interrupted Lady
Caroline.</p>

<p>"Or else, as you so shrewdly observe, Lady C., hid it somewhere
else in the library. My own idea is that he would be more likely to
get rid of it by the unobtrusive method of wrapping it in brown
paper, affixing a stamp or two and bunging it into the out-going
mail-bag. In which case it may be anywhere, but might just possibly
be still at Mr. J. Hone's private residence, if he has one. In the
meantime it's gone, and I must go too."</p>

<p>"In pursuit of that red-haired girl, eh?"</p>

<p>"Simply in the way of business, your ladyship," said Kerrigan
with a bow.</p>

<p>"And how do you propose catching them?"</p>

<p>"It's going to be extremely difficult. But the blue of that
Bentley is very vivid."</p>

<p>"You don't know that Rosemary girl at all well?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid I don't."</p>

<p>"She won't miss the traceability of that blue. She'll make half
a dozen changes of car before she lets them settle down in a quiet
country hotel to work out the problem."</p>

<p>"It would be a bore for me if she succeeded," said Kerrigan,
"but I don't see how it can affect you, Lady C. Presumably you'd
have to hand over your three-quarters to the family chest."</p>

<p>"Presumably," said the old lady dryly, and again there was more
than the suspicion of a wink in the venerable eyelid; "in any case,
I'm not going to let Streatfield and that brat Pamela get away with
it. Catch them putting it back into the family chest! They'd hang
on to it and clear out to America or somewhere."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kerrigan, "I've got to get after them, and that
right rapidly."</p>

<p>"There's just one other thing before you go," said Lady
Caroline. "If you assume that this Treasure is as valuable as old
Lord Claydon thought it was, and if you assume that although he
wanted to hide it and make a practical joke of it, yet at the same
time he didn't want it lost permanently, it is more than likely
that he had several copies of his sampler-book made."</p>

<p>"More than likely," agreed Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"He might even have had it printed."</p>

<p>"As you say, he might even have had it printed. But as it's a
hundred years ago, it's unlikely that we would find a copy upon the
bookstalls."</p>

<p>"Most unlikely, Peter. But have you ever heard of the British
Museum?"</p>

<p>"No. But I'm not surprised to hear that there is one. There was
one at Petersburg. I never went into it myself, but I used to meet
a girl outside it in the evenings at one time. That's how I come to
know about it."</p>

<p>"I am not interested in your licentious past. Please don't refer
to it again," said Lady Caroline severely. "Concentrate upon the
British Museum."</p>

<p>"Consider me as concentrated exclusively upon the British
Museum."</p>

<p>"Very well. It contains a library with a number of books in
it."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"Several millions."</p>

<p>"Several millions! Whew! And if this book of drawings was
printed, a copy of it might be there?"</p>

<p>"That was my idea. Anyway it's worth trying. Off you go to the
Museum&mdash;I'll give you my admission-card&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you go there to read, Lady Caroline?" exclaimed Kerrigan in
surprise.</p>

<p>"I haven't been inside the place for fifty years, but I belong
to an Art Society that gets admission-tickets every year. In any
case, they don't look very closely at the tickets. Any one with a
little assurance can walk straight in&mdash;and from the little
I've seen of you, I should say that you've got a certain amount of
assurance&mdash;and the catalogue-man will look it up for you. If
the book is there, you mayn't take it away with you, but you can
copy out the quotations from <i>Hamlet</i> and bring them back here
as quick as you can."</p>

<p>"But how the dickens shall I know which are from <i>Hamlet</i>,
and which aren't?"</p>

<p>Lady Caroline tapped him sharply on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Copy them all out, then, you illiterate child. I suppose you
know how to write?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and read."</p>

<p>"A monument of erudition. You can take my car."</p>

<p>"That reminds me. I've got a car hidden in a field quite
close."</p>

<p>"Very well. Run along, now, run along!"</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan ran along.</p>

<h2 id='ch10'>X<br>
WARM WORK AT CHISWICK</h2>

<p>It is uncertain whether it was Lady Caroline's ticket of
admission or Peter Kerrigan's naturally buoyant self-confidence
that did the trick, but at any rate there was no difficulty about
getting into the vast, book-filled dome. The young man halted
abruptly on the threshold&mdash;and was sharply bumped from behind
by a hurrying Afghan student who was poring over his book as he
went instead of looking where he was going&mdash;and stared round
him in astonishment. He had never been in such a room in his life;
and he had seldom seen any people like the occupants who sat at
desks, and buried their noses in gigantic piles of books. Kerrigan
himself was no great reader, and the sight of a man or woman
actually sitting down to tackle fifteen or twenty books
simultaneously filled him with respectful awe. They were so
superbly indifferent to their surroundings, so utterly oblivious of
anything outside their piles of literature. Peter felt that if he
pulled out a pistol and fired a shot through the glass roof nobody
would pay the slightest attention. One or two of the readers might
brush glass splinters off their desks, but most of them would not
even hear the noise of the shot. Another reader&mdash;a Hindu this
time&mdash;bumped into him, and this reminded him that he was
blocking the gangway, so he advanced to the huge circular
catalogue-counter and handed in his request. Twenty minutes later
an assistant came back with a thin black book and handed it to him.
It was called <i>The Claydon Samplers</i>, and on the fly-leaf
there was an inscription recording the fact that it had been
presented to the Museum by the Earl of Claydon in 1818.</p>

<p>Kerrigan eagerly took it to a desk and examined it. It consisted
simply of the twenty-four engravings. There was not a single word
of letterpress throughout, except the title of the book, and
Kerrigan had to set to work to copy out the quotations on each of
the twenty-four samplers. It took more than an hour to complete the
job, and then, before returning to Marsh Manor, he drove to the
house off Gower Street where the brother of the missing librarian
lived, knocked, and asked for Mr. Hone.</p>

<p>The little lecturer was at home, and he came shuffling to the
door in tattered bedroom slippers and blinked at Kerrigan. He
obviously did not recognise him.</p>

<p>Kerrigan greeted him heartily.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Mr. Hone. You look gloomy. Had your pocket picked
again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, of course&mdash;silly of me&mdash;won't you come
in? How are you?" said the little man with a rush.</p>

<p>"No, I've only a moment to spare. Any news of your brother?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. Not a line. Oh! It's too terrible! He's dead, I
know he's dead&mdash;murdered just the same as those other poor
fellows. It's horrible. And all because John was clever enough to
find that way of making a million pounds."</p>

<p>"Steady, Mr. Hone, steady. Keep calm. There's no proof that he's
dead. He may be alive and kicking with the best of them."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" wailed the little man. "The police keep on coming
to me and asking me questions, and they've circulated everywhere
and broadcast for him and put his photograph in the papers, but
it's eight weeks now since he went away. Nobody could hide for
eight weeks without being found. And not a word from him all this
time!"</p>

<p>"Not even a parcel?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, there was a parcel, but that was sent off before he
disappeared&mdash;the day before&mdash;and the police came this
morning and took that away."</p>

<p>Kerrigan's heart gave a bound.</p>

<p>"They took it away this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't know why. One of them came and asked if there had
been a parcel. And of course I said yes, and gave it to him. I
thought it was funny they didn't ask for it before if they've known
about it all this time and wanted it."</p>

<p>"Was it a policeman in uniform who came for it?"</p>

<p>"No, a plain-clothes man. A detective."</p>

<p>"How did you know he was a detective?"</p>

<p>"He said he was," replied Mr. Hone simply, and then added in a
panic: "You don't think he was an impostor, do you? He couldn't
have been an impostor surely?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't suppose so for a moment," said Kerrigan soothingly.
"What did he look like?"</p>

<p>"Well, he was quite a young man with chubby pink cheeks and a
very soft voice&mdash;now that you mention it, he didn't look at
all like an ordinary policeman&mdash;and he spoke very
pleasantly."</p>

<p>"No trace of an American accent?"</p>

<p>"Oh, none. I should have noticed that at once."</p>

<p>"And what was in the parcel, Mr. Hone?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I didn't open it. It was addressed by my brother
to himself, you see, and there was a postcard asking me to keep it
for him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kerrigan, "if you'll take my advice, you'll
telephone at once to Scotland Yard, ask for Inspector Fleming, and
tell him about this young cherub with the soft voice. Fleming may
be interested. If you like, you can mention my name. My name
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lecturer interrupted with a pallid smile.</p>

<p>"I may have forgotten you just at first, Mr. Carkeek, but I
haven't forgotten you entirely you see."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; quite, quite!" said Mr. Carkeek, who was rather taken
aback at the resurrection of his forgotten <i>nom de guerre</i>.
"As a matter of fact, Fleming knows me better by my Christian
name&mdash;Kerrigan is my Christian name."</p>

<p>"Kerrigan Carkeek," murmured little Mr. Hone. "What a singular
cacophony."</p>

<p>"It isn't my fault," replied Peter, who had not the faintest
idea what cacophony meant. "And now run off and telephone to
Fleming. It's urgent, vitally urgent."</p>

<p>"It's all so bewildering, and so terrible," Mr. Hone broke into
a wail again. "I shall never see my poor brother again."</p>

<p>"Very sad," thought Kerrigan, as he got into his car, "but
devilish like the advertisement for Bovril." He drove to
Piccadilly, parked his car in Wardour Street, and sauntered round
to Orange Street, a small and dingy thoroughfare that runs off
Leicester Square. He went into the entrance of a high,
shabby-looking house, up a long, dark flight of stairs, and knocked
at a battered door, labelled B. Smail.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a pale, spotty youth who announced firmly
that Mr. Smail was out and that no visitors were admitted.</p>

<p>"Rats to you!" observed Kerrigan genially, and raising his voice
he shouted, "Oh, Barney! Barney lad, let's in."</p>

<p>A shout came from the dark interior and was followed by a fat,
heavy man with a big jowl and a huge unlit cigar gripped firmly in
irregular, yellow teeth.</p>

<p>"Why, Pete!" he cried, holding out a hand that felt like a slab
of fish, "come right in, boy. I haven't seen you for the heck of a
time. I've got Dutchy here, you know Dutchy? Hey, Dutchy, d'you
know young Pete Kerrigan? Smartest lad in this or any other
burg!"</p>

<p>He led the way into an inner sanctum where another fat, heavy
man was sitting in an easy chair. His cigar, however, was in full
blast.</p>

<p>Kerrigan knew him by name&mdash;"Dutchy" Goertz, a gentleman who
had been prominent among receivers of stolen goods for many years
in Barcelona, Marseilles, Rotterdam, and London&mdash;and shook
hands with him cordially.</p>

<p>"I know you by name, Mr. Goertz, and I'm sorry I haven't ever
brought you anything in the way of business."</p>

<p>The fat receiver laughed, a deep guttural laugh.</p>

<p>"And I know you by name, Mr. Kerrigan, and if you brought me
anything in the way of business, I wouldn't touch it. They tell me
that you could work the three-card trick on a Sheffield racecourse
gang and get away with it."</p>

<p>Kerrigan smiled modestly. "Praise from Mr. Goertz is praise
indeed," he remarked.</p>

<p>Mr. Goertz backed away in mock alarm and buttoned up his coat.
"Hands off!" he cried. "I haven't got any money on me."</p>

<p>"Well, young Pete," said Smail, "and what can I do for you? Sell
you a packet of snow? Or would you prefer heroin?"</p>

<p>"Information&mdash;as usual, Barney," said Kerrigan. "Do you
know a young fellow with initial D., pink chubby cheeks, and a very
soft voice, and who makes about as much noise when he walks in the
dark as a cat on a heap of cotton-wool, and is clever as a cartload
of monkeys, and shoots plumb straight?" He addressed the question
to Smail, but he turned sharply on Mr. Goertz at the end of it, for
that individual was undoubtedly shifting uneasily in his seat.
Barney noticed it, too, and said, "Well, Dutchy, do you know
him?"</p>

<p>"I know of him," admitted the other; and then, lowering his
voice to a whisper, he said, "Hellish dangerous."</p>

<p>"Well," said Barney, "the description means nothing in my young
life, but then I'm a specialist. I don't mix with people much
outside the dope crowd. Dutchy's a mixer, and you can believe me,
Peter, or you can believe me not, just as you please, but when
Dutchy says a man is hellish dangerous you can lay a dollar or two
that he's the wrong man to run a kindergarten. Come on, Dutchy;
spill some more. We're all friends here."</p>

<p>"Your kid not listening at the door?" asked the cautious
receiver. Barney shook his head.</p>

<p>"You see this little glass?" he said, jerking his thumb at a
small square mirror that was fixed to the wall near his elbow,
glass upwards. "If you look in here, you can see my outer room
there. Periscope. Neat, eh? No, there isn't no one going to fool
round Barney's keyhole. No, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Goertz, "and if Barney will guarantee you, Mr.
Kerrigan, I'll tell you all I know about a man who answers to that
description."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Mr. Smail succinctly. "Pete's O.K."</p>

<p>"Well," said Goertz slowly, "there's a man called the
Duke&mdash;no one knows his real name, but he's English right
enough and he's a gentleman&mdash;who's made a trade for himself in
America during the last ten or fifteen years. He's the
Millionaires' Pet."</p>

<p>"Sounds harmless enough," said Kerrigan. "What does he do?"</p>

<p>"He'll do anything a millionaire pays him to do, and he won't
blackmail him afterwards. That's how he's got his
reputation&mdash;and his customers. If a man pays him to recover a
document, say, that didn't ought to be drifting round the world,
and the Duke recovers it, he hands it to his employer. He doesn't
do what all the rest would do, use it to blackmail the fellow
himself. He's got a regular scale of tariffs, and he'll undertake
anything, provided it's for a millionaire, or a Corporation that
can pay his scale. And that's about all I know. Your man may not be
the same, but it sounds like the Duke."</p>

<p>"It sounds very like the Duke," murmured Kerrigan. "Can you put
me on to any one who knows him personally?"</p>

<p>"No, by thunder, and I wouldn't if I could. If the Duke knew
that I was putting any one on to him, he'd soon plug a .45 into my
anatomy, and I'm too old for that sort of thing. I tell you, he
doesn't care two brass pins for any man's life except his own, and
I should say he rated that at three brass pins."</p>

<p>"I take it, then, that you won't invite us to meet over a
friendly cocktail?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I will not," was the emphatic reply.</p>

<p>"What about you, Barney? Will you give me a hand?"</p>

<p>"Count me right out of this," answered the placid Mr. Smail.
"I'm one for peace at any price. I'm not a man of blood and
iron."</p>

<p>Kerrigan rose. "Well, gentlemen, I am very much obliged to you
for your information, so far as it goes. <i>Auf
Wiedersehen</i>."</p>

<p>The man called Dutchy Goertz heaved himself to his feet and held
out his hand.</p>

<p>"Take my advice, lad," he said, "leave the Duke alone. He's the
original, number one, hall-marked, twenty-two carat son of a gun.
If you try to get him, he'll get you as sure as fate. So long,
lad."</p>

<p>Kerrigan shook the two large flabby hands that were offered to
him and went out. Half-way down the stairs he heard a soft footstep
behind him and spun round. It was the fat receiver, coming down
much more nimbly than his bulk seemed to allow for. The stairs were
very dark and quite deserted save for the two men. As Goertz passed
Kerrigan he said in a quick whisper, "Try 33 Rome Street," and went
out of the building without a glance at the young man.</p>

<hr>

<p>Peter Kerrigan was of an instinctively cautious disposition. If
it was absolutely necessary, he could be as reckless as any one,
but he disliked and, to a certain degree despised, recklessness. He
regarded it as being made up of 10 per cent. bravery and 90 per
cent. folly. To him it was the same sort of quality that
distinguishes the bull-dog. Kerrigan vastly preferred the
calculating and far-seeing courage of the cat. He liked to take as
few risks as possible and to be ready with a previously planned
line of retreat in case the worst came to the worst. It was,
therefore, only after a good deal of thought and preparation that
he approached the dingy number thirty-three of the dingy Rome
Street, that lies off a dingy Soho Square. He had paid a visit in
the meantime to Clarkson's, the world-famous theatrical costumiers,
and now resembled an elderly, grey-whiskered, and stoutish
parson&mdash;complete with umbrella, books from the London Library
on the classics, gloves, patched elastic-sided boots, and a look of
mild harassment.</p>

<p>It took him half an hour to make his preliminary survey of the
house, and at the end of that half-hour he had to admit that he had
learnt nothing of the slightest interest or value. The house was
exactly the same to all outward appearance as 31 or 35, or any
others in the street. No one had either come in or gone out. No one
had appeared at any window, no shadow had crossed any blind.</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman tried bolder measures. He took out a
small packet of religious leaflets, with which Mr. Clarkson's
establishment, faithful as ever to its tradition of accuracy down
to the smallest details, had provided him, and started to deliver
them at each of the odd numbers in the street. He had to wait
several minutes on the doorstep of Number 33 before there was any
answer to his repeated knockings and ringing. Finally the door was
opened by an old woman who might have been turned out of the same
mould as any of the other old women in the street.</p>

<p>Kerrigan tried to detain her with conversation about parochial
matters, but it was a subject about which she appeared to know even
less than he did, and over which she certainly was not disposed to
linger. But, looking past her into the hall he saw a telephone
hanging beside the hat-rack, and a few moments later he discovered
from the Supervisor that the number was Soho 1412, and the
subscriber's name was Hood.</p>

<p>He then rang up the number and, when a woman's voice answered
the phone, he said in a husky whisper that there was danger from a
fat man disguised as a clergyman. The woman gasped, and whispered
back: "But he's just been here."</p>

<p>Kerrigan had to make up his mind in a fraction of a second what
line to pursue, and he decided to take the boldest.</p>

<p>"He's just turning down Rome Street," he said, "follow him." And
he added, as a pressing afterthought, "But whatever you do, no
violence," and he rang off.</p>

<p>Then pulling his clerical hat firmly down on his ears, and
resisting the temptation to light an extremely unclerical cigar, he
left the telephone-box and started off down Rome Street. The door
of Number 33 opened as he passed, and some one&mdash;he dared not
look round&mdash;came out of the door and followed him. He had one
unpleasant moment at the idea that it might be the redoubtable Duke
himself who was upon his track, and that he might take the liberty
of disregarding the telephone injunction to a Gandhi-like
non-violence, but on the whole it was unlikely that any one would
be foolish enough to run the risk of gun-work in the West-End of
London, and Peter dodged through Soho out into Shaftesbury Avenue
and got on to a bus. By securing a seat on the lower deck beside
the door, he was able to watch for the pursuer without exciting any
suspicion, and he turned towards the conductor an expression that
was intended to convey an owl-like innocence. The only person who
got on to the bus after him was a middle-aged man in a black coat
and black trousers and a stiff collar and bowler hat. He carried a
small dispatch-case and looked a very ordinary sort of business
man. There was, however, a slight traffic block lower down
Shaftesbury Avenue, and two young men got on to the bus who had a
distinctly tough appearance. They wore soft hats and very smart
grey flannel suits and shiny, pointed patent-leather shoes, and
neither of them had shaved for several days. They addressed the
conductor in American accents&mdash;booked ninepenny fares to the
terminus of the journey, and incessantly picked their teeth with
matches.</p>

<p>The middle-aged business man immersed himself in his documents,
the clergyman studied a prayer-book which he was not surprised to
find had been supplied with his outfit, and the bus bowled gaily
along to Hammersmith, Chiswick, and Acton Town.</p>

<p>Kerrigan was confident about the young men; he was a good deal
less certain about the business man whose mild attention seemed to
be wholly devoted to his documents. In fact, his suspicions were
based wholly on the facts that the man had undoubtedly followed him
on to the bus and was undoubtedly making an unusually long journey.
And even these suspicions were allayed when the man suddenly got
off at Stamford Brook Underground Station and disappeared up a side
street. By this time the two young men had produced a pack of cards
and were passing the time cutting through the pack, and Kerrigan
felt that he had by now memorised the details of their personal
appearance with sufficient accuracy to be able to recognise them
again, for certain, through any disguise. He wondered if they had
done the same by him, as he dismounted from the bus and walked
slowly along a side-street that led to Chiswick Mall. He had gained
a little from his expedition if he had become familiar with the
appearance of two of the Duke's assistants, and he had tested to a
certain extent the accuracy of Dutchy Goertz's information about
Number 33 Rome Street. But the man he was after was the Duke
himself. There were two strong motives for running his head into
what sounded like an exceedingly dangerous hornet's nest. Firstly,
Kerrigan had no great faith in the capacity of himself and Lady
Caroline to solve the problem of the samplers. He had never been
much of a hand at such things, and he was fairly certain that his
temporary and venerable colleague had enjoyed even less experience
in this line; and even if they succeeded in solving the puzzle, it
was more than likely that the redoubtable Duke&mdash;if indeed it
was the Duke who had shot Rubin&mdash;would arrive at a solution
much more quickly. There was, in fact, every chance that he had
done so already. In any case, Kerrigan was convinced that his best
chance lay in ignoring the cipher and striking straight at the
Duke.</p>

<p>Secondly, and this was characteristically far-seeing of
Kerrigan, it seemed as if the Duke might be a useful man to know
for future occasions. He might offer to join him in partnership, or
he might try to blackmail him, or to pick his pocket. There were
lots of possibilities about a man like the Duke&mdash;even if he
did sound a little dangerous&mdash;and Peter Kerrigan was
determined to find him if it could be done without wasting too much
time. And it looked as if there would be no necessity to waste a
lot of time. The two shiny-shoed toughs now padding slowly down the
road after him provided an excellent link with the Duke, and they
had the air of men who would be quick workers if pushed to it.</p>

<p>An array of estate-agents' notice-boards on an empty warehouse
which backed on to the river, caught Kerrigan's eye, and he slowed
up and looked with a swift professional glance at the padlock which
secured its heavy double door. It seemed to be an ordinary padlock,
and a moment or two with a skeleton key proved that it was an
ordinary padlock, and, had an inquisitive citizen of Chiswick
happened to be watching at that moment, he would probably have been
very surprised to see a stoutish parson disappearing into an empty
warehouse and shooting a heavy bolt after him.</p>

<p>A quick glance round showed Kerrigan at once that he had fallen
on his feet. The warehouse was exactly suited for his purpose.
There was no window on the ground-floor, and what little light
there was came filtering through a broken trapdoor from the floor
above. Peter ran nimbly up the wooden ladder and found that the
second floor was illuminated by one grimy window overlooking the
street and another, slightly less grimy, overlooking the river.
Outside this second window there was a wooden platform and a rusty
apparatus with iron wheels, chains, and ropes for loading and
unloading boats. The whole place bore many signs of having been
disused for a long time. Peter went out on to the platform and
surveyed his surroundings.</p>

<p>Twenty yards away from the warehouse and separated from it by a
narrow lane that ran down to the river's edge, stood a large house
in a pleasantly large garden, a relic of old uncrowded days when
London was fringed by large houses standing, dignified and aloof,
in their own grounds. This survivor, though now jostled by
warehouses and slums, still managed to preserve some of its dignity
and aloofness, and the tastefulness of the lay-out of the garden
and the absence of lace curtains in the windows seemed to indicate
that it might be inhabited by people who would render assistance to
the Church in distress. After making sure, therefore, that it was
impossible for him to be overlooked from the street, and that no
spy had as yet ventured down the narrow lane as far as the river,
he lowered himself down the ropes into the water, dived, and swam
under water as far as he could&mdash;cumbered as he was by his
clothes and heavy boots. When at last he was forced to rise to the
surface, he found that he had managed to pass the end of the lane
and was out of sight from the main road. He dived again and came up
at the end of the garden farthest from the warehouse. There were
now enough trees and shrubs between him and any possible observers
to make a safe landing, and a moment or two later he was standing,
dripping, outside the back door. An excited and sympathetic maid
rushed, gibbering incoherently, for an excited and sympathetic
lady-of-the-house, and in an hour's time the Reverend Eustace Hardy
was lying on a sofa in a comfortable drawing-room, clad in a pair
of grey woollen pyjamas, a brown woollen dressing-gown, and a pair
of woollen bed-socks. At his side was a table upon which stood a
tall glass of hot whisky and water and lemon, for the Reverend
Eustace had most lamentably caught a chill after his gallant dive
into the river to save a drowning child. Lady Harrower, the
lady-of-the-house, was in an ecstasy of mingled anxiety for the
life of the brave cleric, admiration for his grey wavy hair and
blue eyes, and delight at being able to entertain and succour a
clergyman. She was a charming, fluttering, simple lady of about
five-and-fifty, and as the Reverend Eustace drained his glass and
held it out for a refill he congratulated himself upon his
extraordinarily good luck.</p>

<p>Lady Harrower required no prompting to offer him a bed for the
night, and only a little manoeuvring was required to ensure that
the bedroom faced the warehouse. From the bedroom window the
reverend gentleman could see sentries in the road, and from a
window in the passage he could see a small rowing-boat patrolling
slowly up and down the river.</p>

<p>As soon as twilight began to fall, at about ten o'clock, Peter
went out for a stroll in the garden, explaining to a twittering
hostess that his chill had been entirely subdued by her aspirin and
whisky, and that all he required was a little fresh air.</p>

<p>From a vantage point in a shrubbery he was able to watch the
swift and methodical raid upon the empty warehouse at about a
quarter to twelve. It was carried out by four men led by the quiet
business man who had travelled down in the bus from Shaftesbury
Avenue. But there was no sign of any one resembling the formidable
Duke. He, apparently, did not do all the dirty work himself.</p>

<p>Early next morning, the Reverend Eustace parted with expressions
of mutual goodwill from his benefactress and returned to
Bicester.</p>

<h2 id='ch11'>XI<br>
THE SHAKESPEARE CLUES</h2>

<p>The big blue Bentley car, gathering speed, vanished behind the
trees, and a moment or two later the last sound of its powerful
exhaust died away on the Bicester road. The occupants were in high
good-humour, and as the car swung out of the park gates, they
simultaneously exploded in a peal of laughter. Even the grim
Colombian servant laughed, showing his teeth like a hyena.
Streatfield, who was driving, was the first to return to earth.</p>

<p>"What's the next move?" he asked.</p>

<p>Lady Pamela shrugged her elegant shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied. "Let's drive to Claridge's and do
some thinking."</p>

<p>"Good egg!" said Streatfield. "We can also toy with a spot of
dinner after we've solved the great mystery. I say, didn't we score
off all that pack of blighters neatly?" He and Pamela laughed
again.</p>

<p>Rosemary Shackleford looked thoughtful. "Doesn't it seem to
you," she asked, "that they might be able to trace a car like this?
After all, it is a little conspicuous, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"What does it matter if they do trace us?" replied Streatfield
with a short laugh. "I fancy that Esteban and I could tackle Ilford
or that insurance fellow if it came to a rough house."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking about them. I was thinking about the people
who bumped off first Mr. Newman and then Mr. Rubin."</p>

<p>"I'm not much afraid of them either," said Streatfield. "I've
seen some queer things and met some queer people in my time and it
takes a good deal to worry me."</p>

<p>Lady Pamela looked admiringly at the brown, efficient face of
her fianc. Sitting half crouched over the wheel, his profile set
and determined, driving with a combination of caution and
brilliance, the captain certainly looked a difficult man to
intimidate. But Rosemary seemed to be less impressed than
Pamela.</p>

<p>"I don't see what you can do against gunmen," she argued, but
Streatfield brushed aside the suggestion with a petulant shake of
the head.</p>

<p>"Two can take a hand at gun-play," he said shortly, and Pamela
added, "Don't be so absurd, Rosemary."</p>

<p>But Rosemary refused to be suppressed.</p>

<p>"Even if you are so confident about yourselves," she said,
"speaking for myself, I have no desire to be hanging around if
there's going to be gun-play. So just be good children and listen
to me. In about half an hour we shall be at Great Missenden. You'll
drop me there with all the samplers. I'll hire a car and dodge away
across country until I find some nice country pub where I can
settle down in quiet to solve the problem of the Treasure. You and
Gerald and Esteban can go to Claridge's and shoot as many people as
you like in the meantime. But if you take my advice you'll lie
pretty low. The man who shot poor Mr. Rubin doesn't strike me as
being a man to try and be funny with. But that's just as you
please," she added hastily, seeing that Streatfield was about to
say something.</p>

<p>Lady Pamela answered instead.</p>

<p>"Why do you imagine, Rosemary, that you can solve the cipher or
whatever it is by yourself? Don't you think three heads are better
than one?"</p>

<p>Rosemary Shackleford smiled.</p>

<p>"Pam, darling, I love you dearly, but I never thought you were a
genius."</p>

<p>Lady Pamela was obviously not very pleased at this frankness,
but she replied:</p>

<p>"Well, what about Gerald?"</p>

<p>"Gerald and Esteban are the strong-arm squad," answered Rosemary
with another smile. "Their business to distract the bullets from me
while I'm doing the thinking."</p>

<p>"Rosemary, darling," expostulated Pamela, "what on earth are you
talking about? Gerald is perfectly brilliant. Every one knows
that."</p>

<p>"Dear child, of course he is. I see I shall have to explain from
the very beginning. Assuming that Mr. Kerrigan was speaking the
truth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A pretty big assumption," growled Streatfield, "the beastly
little counter-jumper!"</p>

<p>"No, Gerald," said Pamela unexpectedly, "I am pretty sure that
he was telling the truth. He was much too frightened of you to do
anything else."</p>

<p>"Permitting me to continue," went on Rosemary, as the big car
slid through the village of Aston Clinton, famous as the home of
one of the unfortunate Brides in the Bath, "assuming, as we must
for the time being, that he was telling the truth, we have here in
this car the clue which may lead us to a million pounds. There are
several other people who know of the existence of this clue, and
who know also that we've got it. It is fairly obvious that there
will be a considerable hue and cry. People don't let a million
pounds slip away quite so easily as all that. Now, we aren't a very
difficult party to trace. We've got a rather ostentatious car;
we've got Esteban, who looks as if he'd stepped straight out of
Lord George Sanger's; we've got Gerald, who's got a cut across his
face; we've got Lady Pamela Marsh, one of the most damnably
be-photographed of England's brightest and youngest; and I've got
red hair," she concluded. "What do you know about all that?"</p>

<p>"There's certainly something in that," conceded Streatfield.
"What do you suggest?"</p>

<p>"That we split up, of course. I'll keep my hat well down over my
vermillion tresses and dodge away with the samplers, while you
scatter into London."</p>

<p>Streatfield swerved beautifully round a stray cow that was
contemplating suicide in the middle of the road, and pursed his
lips thoughtfully. Lady Pamela chipped in:</p>

<p>"In theory I think you're right, Rosemary. But in
practice&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's your trouble?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, darling, that you're the right person to do the
dodging away and puzzling out of the cipher. I think Gerald would
be better at it."</p>

<p>"Pamela!" exclaimed Rosemary, "I never heard such nonsense. Of
course I'd be better at it. Besides, Gerald's scar is much harder
to hide than my hair!"</p>

<p>"I don't think I would be very good," said Streatfield. "I never
pretended to be able to solve that sort of thing. I'm better at
practical things."</p>

<p>"You see, Pamela darling?"</p>

<p>Lady Pamela's pretty pink-and-white face clouded over
dangerously, and she said in a cold, unpleasant voice:</p>

<p>"You must remember, Rosemary, that this million pounds belongs
to my family and not to yours."</p>

<p>Rosemary Shackleford flushed.</p>

<p>"In that case, I'll drop out of it at once. Will you stop,
please, Gerald? I can easily walk to a garage and hire a car
home."</p>

<p>"Don't be idiotic!" said Streatfield. "Pam, you're a fool.
You've got no brains, nor have I. Rosemary's chock-a-block with
them. We can't do without her, even if we wanted to. And so far as
I'm concerned, we don't want to."</p>

<p>Pamela laid her hand on the other girl's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Don't be angry with me, darling. I'm all worked up about the
whole thing. My nerves are all to hell. Of course you're the one to
slip away with the samplers. Forget everything I said."</p>

<p>Streatfield interposed tactfully.</p>

<p>"We're just coming to Tring, Rosemary. I suggest that you stop
here and raise a car."</p>

<p>"If you're sure you want me to."</p>

<p>"Absolutely," they both replied.</p>

<p>"Very well. Pull up now, Gerald. I'll walk into the village. I
mustn't appear in this car."</p>

<p>Streatfield pulled up, and Rosemary, the samplers under her arm,
got out.</p>

<p>"I'll ring up Claridge's when I've found a place. But for
Heaven's sake be careful. You'll be watched all the time."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll be careful," said Streatfield dryly. "Don't worry
about us. Good luck. Cheerio!"</p>

<p>Rosemary walked into Tring, hired a car, and was driven to
Amersham, where she paid it off and hired another car to
Maidenhead. At Maidenhead a motor-bus took her to Slough, and a
third hired car finally deposited her at half-past eight that
evening at a small country inn in Surrey, situated near the village
of Churt, and named the Pride of the Valley. She engaged a room,
dined in a shaded corner of the dining-room, and kept her hat on
during the meal, and after dinner retired to the seclusion of her
room to study the twenty-four samplers which had adorned the walls
of the mad Lord Claydon's library.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven she retired to bed without having advanced
one inch towards a solution, and after breakfast next day she
started again. Rosemary had never before realised how exhausting
brain-work can be. By lunch-time she was quite worn out, and she
spent the afternoon recovering some of her mental energy by
strolling on the Surrey commons.</p>

<hr>

<p>That same morning Peter Kerrigan returned to Marsh Manor with
the results of his expedition to London, which he laid before Lady
Caroline. The old lady was extremely annoyed at his delay in
returning, and reprimanded him for his quite unnecessary escapade
at Chiswick.</p>

<p>"You might have been killed!" she exclaimed at him in high,
piercing tones. "The Lord knows the world would be a better place
if you had been, and no one would have cared two straws about it.
But I want your help to get this money. Do you understand? After
I've got it you can do what you like. But until then no more
nonsense."</p>

<p>"I wanted to find the man who shot Rubin," protested
Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"Why? What was your idea? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I thought if I went into partnership with him," said Peter with
a grin, "he might not speak to me like a Prussian
sergeant-major."</p>

<p>"Young man," said Lady Caroline, "as soon as we've got this
money, I shall do my level best to get you hanged!"</p>

<p>"Nobody as gracious as you could be so cruel," retorted
Peter.</p>

<p>"Give me those Shakespeare quotations," said the old lady
austerely, and Kerrigan laid on the table the results of his hour
in the reading-room of the Museum. Lady Caroline sorted out the six
slips marked <i>Hamlet</i>, and put the others aside.</p>

<p>"Now," she said grimly. "What about it?" She stared at them and
Kerrigan stared at them. Then she asked sharply. "These numbers in
the corners&mdash;were they on the samplers?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Each set was numbered one to six."</p>

<p>"Then we'd better put them in that order." She rearranged the
slips in order, and the quotations, all in blue wool, except one in
red, ran as follows:</p>

<p>On Number 1, three lines:</p>

<p class="poem">"With all my love I do commend me to him."<br>
"My lord, you shall tell us where the body is."<br>
"But, see, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading."<br></p>

<p>On Number 2, three lines:</p>

<p class="poem">"For to that sleep of death what dreams may
come."<br>
"The passion ending, doth its purpose lose."<br>
"And marshal me to knavery. Let it stand."<br></p>

<p>On Number 3, two lines:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Or but a sickly part in one true sense."<br>
"Behind this arras I'll convey myself."<br>

<p>(In red wool):</p>

<p class="poem">"Is not this a swift fellow, my lord? he's as good
at anything and yet not a fool."</p>

<p>On Number 4, three lines:</p>

<p class="poem">"Hath this man no feeling of his business?"<br>
"Within the book and folio of my brain."<br>
"To pay four ducats, four, I would not farm it."<br></p>

<p>On Number 5, three lines:</p>

<p class="poem">"I pray thee, pass with your best violence."<br>
"Most lazar-like with foul and loathsome crust."<br>
"With evil speeches of his father's death."<br></p>

<p>On Number 6, three lines:</p>

<p class="poem">"For if the sun breed decay in a dead dog."<br>
"With thoughts beyond the reaches in our souls."<br>
"In mine impudence, your skill shall, like a star."<br></p>

<p>After several minutes of complete silence, Lady Caroline said
slowly and thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary collection of quotations! Let me look at
the others." She scrutinised carefully the slips on which Kerrigan
had copied out the quotations from <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Othello</i>,
and <i>Lear</i>, and then returned to the <i>Hamlet</i> slips. "The
first thing which jumps to the eye is very obvious, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Kerrigan looked at her doubtfully. He was rather out of his
depth.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," she went on impatiently, "you're illiterate, I
forgot. I'll explain, if possible in words of one syllable. There
are a lot of well-known quotations in all of Shakespeare's plays.
In these three sets,"&mdash;she pointed to the slips from
<i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Othello</i>, and <i>Lear</i>&mdash;"the
quotations are almost all well-known. But not one of the
<i>Hamlet</i> ones is even remotely well known."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," ventured Kerrigan unwisely, "<i>Hamlet</i> doesn't
contain so many well-known ones as the others," and he instantly
regretted his rashness in the withering sneer with which the
suggestion was greeted.</p>

<p>"These quotations from <i>Hamlet</i>," went on Lady Caroline,
"are not only not well known; many of them are not worth quoting.
'Behind this arras I'll convey myself,' or 'With all my love I do
commend me to him.' It's absurd to spend days sewing rubbish like
that on to a sampler. That proves conclusively that we're right in
concentrating on the <i>Hamlet</i> samplers. The famous quotations
are put in as a blind; these have been chosen because they contain
the words or letters or something which makes the cipher."</p>

<p>"Why is one of the lines sewn in red wool when all the others
are sewn in blue?" observed Kerrigan thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Which one? Oh yes. 'Is not this a swift fellow, my lord? He's
as good at anything and yet not a fool.' H'm! If it's the only one
that is sewn in red, there must be some reason for it. It must be
the key to the cipher."</p>

<p>"Or else it's been done in red simply to make us think that it's
the key."</p>

<p>"Let's assume it's the key," said Lady Caroline, and together
they wrestled with the problem unavailingly until lunch-time. They
tried anagrams and alternative words and every third word and every
fourth word and initial letters and last letters and every
conceivable combination of words and letters and syllables. But it
was all in vain. They utterly failed to extract an iota of sense
from the samplers.</p>

<p>Luncheon was not a very cheerful meal. Lord Claydon and Sir
George Ilford did not appear. The only other guest at the table was
Mr. Tollemache, and, as Lady Caroline refused to open her mouth
except to put food into it, and was completely lost in thought, the
burden of entertaining Mr. Tollemache fell entirely upon
Kerrigan.</p>

<p>The art-valuer seemed to be obsessed with the famous Treasure.
He talked of nothing else.</p>

<p>"It may be an epoch in the History of Art, Mr. Kerrigan," he
kept on saying. "It may mean nothing less than the disclosing of
some of the great lost pictures. It may lead to a new chapter in
the history of the world."</p>

<p>"Pictures easy things to hide?" asked Kerrigan with his mouth
full of cold salmon.</p>

<p>"Oh no, oh no," chirruped Mr. Tollemache. "That I grant you.
That I concede you frankly. They are not easy things to hide.
Rolled up, they are tolerably bulky, and unrolled they often cover
a widish space. But it is possible, my dear sir, surely you will
admit that it is possible that the old Lord Claydon was such a
clever man that he found a hiding-place that baffled generations of
searchers."</p>

<p>"It's possible, of course."</p>

<p>"Now what are your views, Mr. Kerrigan? What do you think of the
chances of finding the famous Treasure? In your experience, Mr.
Kerrigan, you must have come across cases of pictures being lost or
stolen and turning up in very queer places?"</p>

<p>"What exactly do you mean by my experience?" inquired Kerrigan
guardedly.</p>

<p>"In your work for your Insurance Company."</p>

<p>Kerrigan had forgotten that he had recently adopted that
profession for a short time.</p>

<p>"Ah yes! But my line has been life insurance. Not works of
art."</p>

<p>Mr. Tollemache was disappointed, and the conversation
languished. After luncheon Lady Caroline took Kerrigan aside.</p>

<p>"I am now going to take a nap," she announced. "I want you to
get a copy of <i>Hamlet</i> from the library, read it through until
you come to the quotation that is sewn in red upon the third
sampler, and have the place ready for me at half-past three when I
wake up. The context may give us some clue."</p>

<p>Kerrigan set about his novel task with considerable interest. It
was a quite new experience for him, and he always enjoyed anything
that was new. He found a copy of <i>Hamlet</i> and, selecting a
corner of the library that commanded all the windows and the two
doors, he built himself a rampart out of the <i>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</i>, laid a pistol on the desk beside him, and set to
work. Peter Kerrigan paid no attention whatsoever to omens or
superstitions, but he paid a good deal of attention to the
possibility of being taken by surprise.</p>

<p>He was soon absorbed in <i>Hamlet</i>, and his emotions as he
read were mingled admiration, puzzlement, and amusement. The notion
of killing a man by pouring poison in his ear struck him as
extremely ingenious; on the other hand, he could not understand the
scruples of a man who would not bump off his hated enemy simply
because he found him praying. Hamlet's device of ensuring that
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern would be put on the spot as soon as
they arrived in England appealed to him; and Polonius seemed to be
simply asking for trouble by hiding behind a curtain and spying. He
found the language at times difficult to understand and he
profoundly despised Hamlet's indecision. On the other hand he was
immensely awed by what he called Shakespeare's "gift of the gab;" a
fellow who could reel off words like that was obviously a learned
sort of card, a university professor most likely or a barrister; at
any rate, a fellow who lived in a library.</p>

<p>Ophelia and her lamentable fortunes almost brought tears to his
eyes, while the king's treachery in the last scene made him
angry.</p>

<p>But of the line which was sewn in red upon Sampler No. 3 of the
series he could find no trace. To make quite certain he read the
whole play through again. The line was not there. There was,
however, one line which seemed vaguely familiar, and that was the
very last line in the play: "Go bid the soldiers shoot," and it
took him at least ten minutes of brain-cudgelling before he
remembered that it was the inexplicable postscript to the letter
from John Hone to his brother which had started all the trouble.
"Go bid the soldiers shoot, eh, old chap?" had been the words. That
was something, at any rate. The whole assumption from the beginning
had been that John Hone had solved the cipher and felt that his
hand lay upon the Treasure. And here, in his triumphant letter to
his brother, he had quoted Hamlet in a jubilant postscript.</p>

<p>Surely that was an additional confirmation that the secret lay
in the Hamlet samplers. And yet the first line that he had tried to
trace in Hamlet was not there! As it was not quite half-past three,
the hour of Lady Caroline's awakening from her siesta, Kerrigan set
himself to try and trace another of the quotations, and very soon
ran to earth Line 2 on Sampler Two: "The passion ending, doth the
purpose lose."</p>

<p>He tried again, and found Line 1, Sampler Three: "Or but a
sickly part of one true sense." Then Lady Caroline appeared, and he
handed her his results. She was keenly interested.</p>

<p>"The only line in red is not in <i>Hamlet</i>," she repeated
several times. "That's extraordinarily interesting. That makes me
more certain than ever that it's the key to the whole cipher.
Peter, we've got to get that line!" She closed her eyes and
murmured, "'Is not this a swift fellow, my lord? He's as good at
anything and yet not a fool.' It's familiar, Peter, it's very
familiar, and yet somehow it's not familiar. It doesn't sound
right. It's got something queer about it."</p>

<p>"We've got to hurry up about it," said Peter half to himself.
"We haven't got much time."</p>

<p>Lady Caroline looked at him waspishly.</p>

<p>"Your part in this affair is to make time for me," she said.
"You've got to keep the world out of this library until I've solved
the cipher. That's all you're good for."</p>

<p>"Let me remind your ladyship," said Kerrigan blandly, "that
although I am a match, on the average, for ten ordinary men, I
fancy that in a short time I may be called upon to cope with one
extraordinary man backed by about twenty ordinary ones."</p>

<p>But Lady Caroline was not listening. Her eyes were shut and she
was murmuring, "Is not this a swift fellow, my lord?"</p>

<p>Then she opened her eyes and said sharply:</p>

<p>"Get me Christchurch College, Oxford, on the telephone, and ask
for Professor Macnamara."</p>

<p>Bicester is no great distance from Oxford; the telephone service
was in its blandest mood and the Professor chanced to be in
college, so the call did not take more than twenty minutes to put
through. Lady Caroline seized the receiver, announced herself, and
exchanged brief greetings. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Professor, I am trying to run to earth a quotation and I want
your help. Listen carefully while I repeat it." She gave the
quotation twice, slowly and clearly, and then there was a pause.
She repeated it a third time, and then the Professor gave his
verdict. Lady Caroline thanked him, replaced the receiver, and
turned to Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"It's a misquotation," she announced, "from <i>As You Like
It</i>, Act v. Scene iv."</p>

<p>"From as I like what?" inquired Kerrigan, mystified.</p>

<p>"Another of Shakespeare's plays," the old lady said impatiently.
"Really, you are the most ignorant young man I've ever met! The old
Lord Claydon who built this library would have positively hated
you. He hated his own children because they were so ignorant. The
quotation ought to be 'Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?' You
see? 'Rare' instead of 'swift.' Pass me over the Shakespeare."</p>

<p>She turned up <i>As You Like It</i> and read aloud the words,
and then the dialogue that led up to and succeeded the words, and
then shook her head. "There doesn't seem much to help us
there."</p>

<p>"But why should any one make a mistake in the quotation?"
demanded Peter, his wits thoroughly roused. "If it was written, a
mistake wouldn't be so bad; it would be understandable. But to go
and solemnly sew the wrong word, and to sew it in the wrong colour,
and to choose the quotation from the wrong play&mdash;it couldn't
possibly have been an accident. It's out of the question."</p>

<p>"You're right, Peter. Of course you are. It's intentionally
wrong, and the red wool is to draw our attention to it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps 'rare' is some sort of key-word?"</p>

<p>"Either 'rare' or 'swift.'"</p>

<p>"The trouble about key-words," said Kerrigan, "is that there are
dozens of different ways in which a key-word can be used."</p>

<p>"I suppose," replied Lady Caroline, "there are experts in
ciphers whom we could hire to solve it. But I've no idea how we can
lay our hands upon one. Perhaps that is the sort of thing that you
are good at&mdash;finding professional cipher experts?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Kerrigan slowly, "that there are such things,
but I wonder very much if it's that sort of cipher."</p>

<p>"What's your idea?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking about the mad old Lord Claydon," he answered. "I
don't suppose he wanted the Treasure to be lost permanently, and so
he wouldn't have made the cipher too difficult. There may be
professional solvers nowadays, but I don't imagine that they
existed prominently in the 'twenties or 'thirties."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Lady Caroline sharply. "What are you driving
at?"</p>

<p>"The old man was fond of cruel practical jokes; he also hated
the laziness and ignorance of his children and his nephews and so
on. How would it be if he invented this story of the Treasure, and
left these Shakespeare clues simply in order to make them all study
Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>"And the Treasure would be the intimate knowledge of Shakespeare
that they would gain in doing so?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think that's possible?"</p>

<p>"I think it's very possible. I think it's damnably possible!"
exclaimed the old lady with spirit. "It's exactly the sort of thing
he would have enjoyed." She paused, and then went on again. "There
are one or two arguments against it, though, I'm glad to say. So
far as we can make out, only the <i>Hamlet</i> samplers are to be
used. That means that his children would only have had to study one
play, whereas with a little more trouble he could have made them
study lots of the plays. And if there's no Treasure, what was it
that John Hone found?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's something in that." Kerrigan brightened. "He
obviously found something. Then here's another idea. There was a
Treasure, a real one, and old man Claydon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Old Lord Claydon, if you please," corrected Lady Caroline
sharply. "He was my great-granduncle!"</p>

<p>"Old Lord Claydon hid it so that the finder of it at least had
to wade through one play of Shakespeare's to find it. He was
rewarded for his trouble, and the others were scored off for their
ignorance. How about that?"</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope that is the correct view," replied the old
lady, "and I propose that we act as if it was. In other words, we
must study our <i>Hamlet</i>."</p>

<p>"Keeping in mind the application of a key-word which is either
'swift' or 'rare.'"</p>

<p>"It might be that as 'swift' has been substituted for 'rare' we
are to substitute 's' for 'r,' 'w' for 'a,' 'i' for the next 'r,'
'f' for 'e,' 't' for the next 'r,' and so on."</p>

<p>It did not take long for this theory to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>"In any case," pointed out Kerrigan, "we aren't studying
<i>Hamlet</i>. We aren't improving our minds."</p>

<p>But Lady Caroline was not listening. She was examining Slip No.
6 most intently through her lorgnettes.</p>

<p>"'In mine impudence, your skill shall, like a star,'" she
muttered. "Why 'in impudence'?"</p>

<p>"It struck me, Lady C.," replied Kerrigan, "that Gaffer
Shakespeare is a bit obscure from time to time; of course, I'm not
a judge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" she snapped. "On the other hand, I am. In my days
girls were educated. William Shakespeare never wrote 'in mine
impudence.' It's ridiculous! Find the passage in <i>Hamlet</i>
where he says that."</p>

<p>"Dash it all!" protested Kerrigan. "I've already read it all
through twice. Have I got to plug through it all again?"</p>

<p>"You're learning your <i>Hamlet</i>," said the old lady grimly.
"Just as if you were a descendant of old man Claydon."</p>

<p>With an exaggerated sigh, Kerrigan sorted out the play from the
other volumes and started to skim through it rapidly, in search of
the words, "In mine impudence&mdash;" Lady Caroline went on
studying the slips through her lorgnettes, and for a time there was
silence.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Kerrigan looked up.</p>

<p>"I've come across the first one of all. Sampler No. i, line 1:
'With all my love I do commend me to you.' Don't you think while
I'm about it we might note down where to find each of them? It will
save time in the long run. It's in Act i., Scene v., line 184."</p>

<p>Lady Caroline jotted it down.</p>

<p>A little later Kerrigan read out: "'But look, where sadly the
poor wretch comes reading.' Act ii., Scene ii., line 167," and Lady
Caroline duly made a note of it, and then a moment afterwards: "and
here's the one about the sun and the dead dog, same Act and Scene,
line 180."</p>

<p>The next one was: "'For in that sleep of death what dreams may
come,' Act iii., Scene i., line 67, and the next: 'The passion
ending, doth the purpose lose.' Act iii., Scene ii., line 207, and
the next: 'Behind the arras I'll convey myself,' Act iii., Scene
iii., line 28."</p>

<p>It was not until Kerrigan was half-way through Act iv. that Lady
Caroline pulled him up sharply. He had just said:</p>

<p>"Here's another: Act iv., Scene iv., line 20. 'To pay five
ducats, five, I would not farm it.'"</p>

<p>"Four ducats, four, you mean," interrupted Lady Caroline.</p>

<p>"No, madam, I mean five ducats, five."</p>

<p>"Then it's another mistake." They stared at each other until
Lady Caroline said quietly: "Go on, Peter. Just find that one about
'impudence.'"</p>

<p>Kerrigan had to read almost to the end of the play before he
found Hamlet's words: "I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine
ignorance your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, stick
fiery off indeed."</p>

<p>"A singular capacity for making mistakes," observed Lady
Caroline dryly. "Let us start all over again."</p>

<p>They started all over again and examined each quotation
carefully; Kerrigan finding them in the book and Lady Caroline
checking them on the slips and jotting them down on a large sheet
of paper, writing the line from the slip first and the same line,
as Kerrigan found it in the book, immediately after it. The result
was curious. Lady Caroline's sheet ran as follows:</p>

<pre>

Slip1    "With all      my love     I    do commend     me     to   him."

<p>Then came the quotation from <i>As You Like It</i>, when the
word "swift" was substituted for the word "rare." Then:</p>

<pre>

Slip4 "Hath  this   man     no      feeling      of    his    business."
Book    "     "    fellow   "          "         "      "          "

</pre>

<p>"Well," said Kerrigan, mopping his brow with an elegant silk
handkerchief, "I don't know what happened to Lord Claydon's
children, but I think I can repeat that infernal play word for
word, and I don't care two straws if I never hear of it again, or
of Brother Shakespeare either. What do you make of it, Lady C.?
Where do we stand? Have we got our hands upon a million
dollars&mdash;our pickers and stealers upon the ducats? Damnation!
I'm beginning to quote that stuff already."</p>

<p>"I've got as far as this," replied Lady Caroline coolly. "The
words which ought to have been in the samplers but weren't, read as
follows: 'You must look in the work of the rare fellow volume five
you vile pestilent maggots of ignorance.'"</p>

<h2 id='ch12'>XII<br>
THE THIRD MURDER</h2>

<p>"That's all very well," said Kerrigan. "That's all jolly clever
and nice. But who is the rare fellow? Is it Gaffer Shakespeare
himself?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," replied Lady Caroline. "I rather fancy
it must be intended for Ben Jonson. Don't ask foolish questions,"
she went on hastily. "Ben Jonson was a poet and a playwright, and
on his memorial stone in Westminster Abbey, it says, 'O rare Ben
Jonson!'"</p>

<p>Kerrigan gazed at the old lady in respectful admiration.</p>

<p>"What an awful lot you do know," he said. "Let's try and find
this sportsman's literary work. Jonson, Benjamin. You sit there,
Lady C., while I look round for it."</p>

<p>In about a quarter of an hour he found the complete works of
that illustrious writer, and inside the cover of Volume V. there
was a pocket, consisting simply of a flap of paper which had been
pasted on to the board. The pocket was empty.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that," murmured Lady Caroline, her eyes fixed
abstractedly upon the work. "That man Hone got it, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what did he do with it? That's the point."</p>

<p>"And a very curious point it is, too," replied her ladyship;
"very curious indeed."</p>

<p>Kerrigan examined the book again carefully.</p>

<p>"There couldn't have been very much in here," he said. "It's too
small to hold more than a couple of sheets of notepaper."</p>

<p>"It obviously held a piece of paper with the instructions for
finding the Treasure; probably another of these cipher jokes.
That's clear enough. What isn't so obvious is why Hone ran the risk
of taking it away with him when we're more or less agreed that he
left the Treasure behind. It seems silly, and yet the man couldn't
have been very silly or he wouldn't have got as far as this. You
see, Peter, or at least you will see after I've explained it to
you, there was first of all the clues on the samplers. Hone didn't
take them away&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they were a bit too bulky to march out with under his
arm."</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt. He only had to take the one with the line in
red on it. The word 'rare' is the vital word."</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Lady Caroline icily. "Very well. He leaves the
first clue, and he leaves the Treasure; but he takes the second
clue away with him. That doesn't sound reasonable."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's hidden it."</p>

<p>"Of course he's hidden it. He must have. And that brings us up
against a very pretty little problem. He must have hidden it in the
obvious place&mdash;slipped it into any one of the ten thousand
books which are lying on the shelves of this library. The next
thing for you to do is to find it."</p>

<p>"That will take a goodish bit of time," said Peter
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Not if we employ the local troop of Boy Scouts and offer a
handsome reward for the discovery of a document!"</p>

<p>"He may have memorised it and then burnt it."</p>

<p>"Of course he may. But we've got to assume that he hasn't! Go
down and find the local scoutmaster and fix it up with him."</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan took his car and drove into Bicester in search of
scouts. His first port of call was the Angel Hotel. Not only did it
sell admirable beer, but, like all inns, it was a centre of
information. Kerrigan was just polishing off a tankard of ale when
he became aware that a man was sitting in a dark corner of the
lounge, half-hidden by an aspidistra, watching him. The next moment
he had slid into the chair beside the man and was saying:</p>

<p>"Dear old Inspector Fleming! Revisiting your ancient haunts?
What will you have? Landlord, a good deal of ale at your earliest
convenience."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Kerrigan," replied Fleming calmly, "so you're still
hanging around? Have you found that million pounds?"</p>

<p>"No. Have you found that murderer?"</p>

<p>Fleming smiled. "The police have a clue," he said. "Tell me,
have you been bothered with any more Treasure-hunting strangers at
Marsh Manor?"</p>

<p>"No. The place has been comparatively free of them lately. I was
beginning to wonder what had happened to them all. Do you suppose
that the man who shot Rubin got away with it after all?"</p>

<p>"You mean the Duke?" asked Fleming casually. Kerrigan started.
"Don't look so surprised, Mr. Kerrigan," went on the detective,
pulling out a pipe and beginning to fill it. "You aren't the only
person who can find things out."</p>

<p>"You're an old fox!" said Kerrigan admiringly. "I always said
you were. What else do you know?"</p>

<p>But Fleming was too busy lighting his pipe to answer the
question. The next time he did speak, he observed:</p>

<p>"It's been a curious case in one or two ways. Chicago gangsters
so seldom bring their feuds over here. It's interesting to see
their methods at work. They are different in several ways from the
methods of our bad eggs."</p>

<p>"In what sort of way?"</p>

<p>"Well, they're much more reckless for one thing. In Chicago
they're accustomed to shooting people in the streets and getting
away with it, and they've got the idea that they can do the same
thing when they come to other countries. It makes them take all
kinds of absurd risks. On the other hand,"&mdash;Fleming paused and
then went on seriously&mdash;"on the other hand, Kerrigan, I'm
flabbergasted at the technical skill of some of them. I had no idea
the thing could be carried to such a pitch. That business in the
library over there when Rubin was shot was a bit of an eye-opener
for me, I can tell you. I wasn't thirty yards away, in that little
room at the end of the library with the door open, and I didn't
hear a sound until Rubin came in from the house. The other fellow
came in from the garden without a sound."</p>

<p>"A remarkable feat," said Kerrigan, adding with a modest cough,
"I know how difficult it was because I had just done it
myself."</p>

<p>Fleming laughed. "But then I'm never surprised at any talents
for villainy that you display, my dear fellow. And, incidentally,
you'll admit that the Duke made a brilliant get-away. The whole
thing was a masterpiece from beginning to end."</p>

<p>"How did you tumble to the fact that it was the Duke?"</p>

<p>"That was easy once the Chicago police identified Newman as one
of his pals."</p>

<p>"And have you caught him yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Fleming quietly. "But it's only a matter of
hours."</p>

<p>"Have you tried 33 Rome Street, Soho?"</p>

<p>"We raided it after your visit to it yesterday."</p>

<p>Kerrigan sat bolt upright. "Say that again slowly."</p>

<p>Fleming smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>"Surely you knew that we would&mdash;er&mdash;follow you about a
little, Kerrigan. You're such a knowing young fellow."</p>

<p>"You infernal old fox!" cried Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"You looked a most benign parson. I would have joined your
congregation at once if I'd thought you had got a church. You see,
Kerrigan, you've got crooked ways of finding things out quickly
that I haven't got. I've no doubt that it would have taken me as
long as forty-eight hours, or perhaps even more, to get as far as
the Rome Street house. By having you watched, we got there in six
hours. Very simple, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Then you saw that business down in Chiswick?"</p>

<p>"And very neat and clever I thought it was. We scooped in all
five of the lads who went into the warehouse. They were all Yanks.
They'll come up to-morrow on 'feloniously entering,' 'illegal
possession of firearms,' and perhaps on 'loitering with intent to
commit.' Remanded, of course, for a fortnight."</p>

<p>Kerrigan became indignant.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you, my boyhood's chum,
deliberately allowed six murderous thugs to follow me into a
disused warehouse at dead of night, loaded up with gatlings and
stuffed eel-skins? Why didn't you clap them into irons before they
went in? You had no means of knowing that I wasn't inside. In my
opinion, you're a cold-blooded, callous, hard-hearted
policeman!"</p>

<p>Fleming laughed gently.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Maitland was very worried about it," he said. "He felt
very strongly about it and said that it wasn't right or fair."</p>

<p>"Sergeant Maitland is a good citizen."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he's very soft-hearted. And he really was worried
about those six fellows. He kept on saying that no doubt they were
stiffs, and thugs, and hooligans, and probably kicked their
grandmothers, and robbed orphans, but after all, he was a humane
man and fair was fair, and it wasn't right to let them run such a
frightful risk."</p>

<p>"Sergeant Maitland ought to be sunk in mid-channel with a stone
round his neck."</p>

<p>"But I pointed out to him," continued Fleming blandly, "that you
were certain to have cleared out long ago, and were probably at
that very moment picking a pocket in Leicester Square or selling a
gold-brick to an Australian in the lounge of the First Avenue Hotel
in Holborn."</p>

<p>Kerrigan got up and surveyed the detective coldly.</p>

<p>"Your idea of quiet, gentlemanly fun," he said, "is not my idea
of quiet, gentlemanly fun, and I dislike your taste in
conversation. Furthermore,"&mdash;he broke off and stared at a man
who came into the hotel at that moment&mdash;"furthermore," he
repeated absurdly, and his voice trailed away and he sat down again
abruptly and pulled out his pocket-book; he rummaged in it and
produced a photograph which he glanced at and handed to Fleming.
Fleming looked from the photograph to the stranger and back again
at the photograph. Then he handed it back, nodded, and raised his
eyebrows in inquiry.</p>

<p>Kerrigan got up and yawned.</p>

<p>"What about a game of billiards? There's a table in there."</p>

<p>He led the way into the billiard-room. As soon as the door
closed behind them, he said in a quick whisper:</p>

<p>"That's Hone, the librarian who disappeared."</p>

<p>Fleming's brows contracted and his eyes shone, but he said only
"Ah!" and then he slowly relit his pipe&mdash;a totally unnecessary
waste of a match, as the pipe was already in full blast. Then:</p>

<p>"So that's Hone," he observed very thoughtfully. "That's
exceedingly interesting. I think I would like a talk with him."</p>

<p>"Half a minute!" exclaimed Kerrigan. "Don't be hasty. What do
you want to talk to him about?"</p>

<p>"About the present whereabouts of the Duke. I fancy he might be
able to tell us a thing or two."</p>

<p>"I should think nothing was more unlikely," replied Kerrigan
emphatically. "I don't see how he could possibly know anything. And
if you go and talk to him, you'll only make him frightened and
you'll get nothing out of him at all. Whereas if you leave him
alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He'll lead you to the Treasure!" interrupted Fleming dryly.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" exclaimed Kerrigan. "I wish I'd never told you who
he is."</p>

<p>Fleming inserted a forefinger into the young man's buttonhole
and said to him in a kindly voice:</p>

<p>"Look here, Kerrigan, if you can find that Treasure you're
welcome to it so far as I'm concerned. But don't go and run
unnecessary risks. So long as the Duke is at large you'll be in
danger. If you help me to rope him in, then you'll have a clear
field for treasure-hunting and you can go ahead. But at present you
haven't got a clear field."</p>

<p>"Just leave him alone for this one evening," begged Kerrigan.
"After that you can do what you like."</p>

<p>"It isn't worth while taking the risk," replied Fleming
firmly.</p>

<p>"Risk be damned! The Duke won't come near Bicester again after
killing a man within a couple of miles of the place two days
ago."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I think he will do," replied Fleming
quietly, "and that's why I'm here. Come on; there's no time to
waste."</p>

<p>He led the way into the lounge again and walked across to where
Hone was talking in an undertone to the landlord.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hone, I think?" he began, and the ex-librarian spun round,
his face white and his lips trembling.</p>

<p>"You've made a mistake," he stammered, but Fleming patted him
soothingly on the arm. "It's quite all right," he said. "Come into
the billiard-room and have a talk. I'm a police inspector from
Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>Hone stumbled twice before he reached the billiard-room, and he
was obviously in a pitiable state of nerves.</p>

<p>"Now," said Fleming, shutting the door, "this is my friend, Mr.
Kerrigan. Get him a drink, Kerrigan. You can speak just as freely
in front of him as in front of me. I want to know all you can tell
me about the man who is called the Duke?"</p>

<p>Hone shivered violently at the mention of this young gentleman's
pseudonym, and for a moment or two he found it difficult to utter
an intelligible sound. At last he managed to say in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"I had something for sale, and he got me kidnapped. He
threatened me with torture. I had to tell him part of the secret. I
didn't tell him the whole secret. Then I escaped. If I hadn't, he
would have tortured me when he got back and found that I hadn't
told him the whole of it."</p>

<p>"You told him about the samplers?" asked Kerrigan.</p>

<p>Hone turned an eye that contained a bloodshot mixture of terror
and low cunning upon him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I told him that the Treasure was sewn into the back of one
of the samplers. I had to invent something. It was the best I could
do. There was a red-hot poker in front of my nose."</p>

<p>"And where is he now?" asked Fleming sharply.</p>

<p>Hone shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest idea." He drank off a neat brandy at a
gulp and a little colour came into his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Where were you kidnapped to?"</p>

<p>"A house in St. John's Wood. I think I could find it again. It
was near Marlborough Road Underground Station."</p>

<p>"We'll start for St. John's Wood in five minutes," said Fleming.
Hone started abruptly.</p>

<p>"I can't go back there&mdash;I daren't go back there! He would
kill me!" The man's voice rose to a pitiable wail.</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd," said Fleming. "You'll be surrounded by dozens
of policemen. How could he possibly get at you? Besides, I very
much doubt if he's still there."</p>

<p>Hone seemed a little reassured by this, and his spirits rose
slightly, especially when Kerrigan brought him another drink.</p>

<p>"You swear I'll be protected?"</p>

<p>"Of course you'll be protected. All you've got to do is to
identify the house and then you can do what you like."</p>

<p>"There's just one thing, Inspector." Hone had a sudden relapse
into his nervous fit and began stammering again. "A very small
matter. I left Marsh Manor rather abruptly some six or seven weeks
ago and I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;er had to leave a good deal of my
baggage behind me. Would it be very inconvenient if I hired a car
and went to Marsh Manor now and collected some of it? It wouldn't
take me long. And then we could go to London afterwards."</p>

<p>"A very good suggestion," said Kerrigan warmly. "In fact, I'm
going that way myself and I'll be very glad to drive you
there."</p>

<p>Fleming frowned. He did not want to put unnecessary spokes in
Kerrigan's wheel, but at the same time his paramount duty was to
discover and raid the St. John's Wood lair of the American murderer
at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>"It's on the way to Aylesbury," went on Kerrigan. "You'll have
to go by train from Aylesbury if you want to get up to London
quickly. There aren't any good trains from here at this hour of the
day."</p>

<p>This was a pure guess of Kerrigan's, but it turned out from an
inspection of time-tables that it was substantially correct.</p>

<p>"All right," conceded Fleming reluctantly, "we'll stop at the
Manor, but you must drive us to Aylesbury, Kerrigan."</p>

<p>"You bet I will! Come on, lads. What sort of luggage is it, Mr.
Hone? Books, I suppose? You librarians are great ones for
books."</p>

<p>Hone seemed pleased with this suggestion, and Kerrigan guessed
that the reason was that the ex-librarian had been looking for a
plausible excuse for going into the library.</p>

<p>"Yes, as a matter of fact, yes," he replied jerkily. "As it
happens I left several of my own books in the library. I should be
glad to have them back."</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan's spirits began to rise. It began to look as if
the quest of the famous Treasure was really coming to a successful
conclusion. He had started it as a mild amusement without any high
hopes of profit, but had gradually got bitten with the undying
fascination of all treasure-hunts, and, quite apart from the
prospect of heavy financial gain, he was thoroughly excited at the
possibility of succeeding where so many had failed. All he had to
do now was to make certain that Hone was left for a few minutes
alone in the library and then subsequently relieve him of any
pocket-book, package, or parcel that he might be encumbered with.
Or, simpler still, he might be able to hide in the library before
Hone came in, and then pounce upon him red-handed, so to speak.</p>

<p>He reckoned, however, as Fleming had done before, without the
resourcefulness of the redoubtable Duke. For, a mile out of
Bicester, a powerful motor-bicycle came up from behind and the
rider shot the unfortunate librarian neatly through the forehead,
punctured the off-front tyre with another shot and disappeared
round the next corner at sixty or seventy miles an hour.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, while Fleming was making half the telephone
wires in the country red-hot from Marsh Manor, Kerrigan walked into
the library and found Rosemary Shackleford standing there with the
fifth volume of Jonson's works in her hand.</p>

<h2 id='ch13'>XIII<br>
BLACKMAIL</h2>

<p>Rosemary gave a faint start and coloured a little, but otherwise
showed no sort of embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Good evening," she remarked quietly; "I was wondering if you
would still be here."</p>

<p>"Good evening," replied Kerrigan gaily. "Doing a spot of quiet
reading, eh?"</p>

<p>"It isn't often one gets a chance," Rosemary answered easily,
replacing the volume of Jonson in the bookcase with an assumed
casualness, and pulling out at random another book. "A queer jumble
of stuff in here," she went on. "A lot of awful trash, and some
good stuff as well."</p>

<p>"What about those samplers?" asked Peter bluntly. "Did you solve
the mystery?"</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>"No, it was too much for me altogether. I'm no good at that sort
of thing. Are you a cipher expert, Mr. Kerrigan?"</p>

<p>"Good lord, no!"</p>

<p>"I should have thought you might be good at something," she said
with mocking gaiety, "but it's difficult to find out what it is. It
certainly isn't picquet, and it doesn't seem to be brain-work. What
is your line, Mr. Kerrigan? Basket-making? Fret-saw?"</p>

<p>"Professional boxing," replied Kerrigan, with a bow. There was a
dry laugh from the doorway as Streatfield came in.</p>

<p>"Professional boxing!" he said. "I used to do a bit of boxing
myself once. We might have a spar together some time."</p>

<p>Kerrigan assumed an air of nervousness.</p>

<p>"Oh, well! I'm not sure about that; I'm rather out of
practice."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought you might be," answered Streatfield with a
laugh. "Pamela!" he called over his shoulder, "here's your young
pal again!"</p>

<p>Lady Pamela came in and looked coldly at Kerrigan. Then she
turned to Streatfield and said:</p>

<p>"We can't get rid of him so long as Aunt Caroline is here."</p>

<p>"Then I suggest," replied Streatfield, "that you put a little
pressure upon your esteemed papa to get rid of Aunt Caroline."</p>

<p>Kerrigan replied affably: "I don't see why we shouldn't all be
friends," but his eyes were not upon the pair he was addressing but
upon Rosemary Shackleford. She was perched upon a desk, swinging
one leg idly and gazing thoughtfully at the ground. He knew exactly
what she was pondering about&mdash;the whereabouts of the piece of
paper which had been in the Jonson volume. She struck him as being
an exceedingly intelligent young lady. The pair who did all the
talking and bluffing were simply ludicrous; but the tall,
red-haired girl was quite different. He wondered what she was in
the business for at all; he wondered if she really liked the
bad-tempered and silly Lady Pamela; if she was trying to smooth the
path of true love or if she was playing her own hand; if she was
detachable from her present alliance or not. The last idea struck
him as being worth while verifying. The trouble was that he himself
could not verify it without disclosing that he knew a great deal
more than he pretended, and Peter instinctively hated doing this.
It was one of his strongest weapons in his incessant warfare with
the world that people invariably underestimated him until it was
too late. At the present moment he flattered himself that every one
in this present case underestimated him profoundly, and the most
dangerous of them all, the Duke, did not even know of his
existence.</p>

<p>He determined, therefore, to get Lady Caroline to try and detach
Rosemary Shackleford from her present alliance. Without her, Lady
Pamela and her offensive fiance would be useless; with her, they
kept on obstructing and getting in the way, and wasting time just
at a critical juncture when time was of the utmost value. He nodded
to Streatfield, bowed to the two girls and, remarking, "Well, I
must go and lie down; I'm always so tired if I don't get an hour's
rest in the evening," he strolled out in search of Lady
Caroline.</p>

<p>As he drifted from room to room in his search, he could not help
admitting to himself that the activities of the young gentleman who
called himself the Duke were becoming a little alarming. The man
was an obvious master of the Chicago technique of committing a
murder in broad daylight and getting away with it. Of course, he
could not conceivably continue to commit these daylight murders in
England with impunity. Indeed, his luck had already been
phenomenal. But the knowledge that he was still at large and
apparently still undaunted by the police pursuit, by the broadcast
descriptions, by the rewards and the photographs, by the
mobilisation of the immensely efficient resources of British
detection, was definitely disquieting. The man might easily make a
final raid on Marsh Manor, and Kerrigan was certain that the
police, even the quietly astute Fleming himself, would leave this
possibility out of their calculations. They had no experience of
the aggressive criminal. The Scotland Yard idea of a murderer was a
man who, after committing his crime, ran away in a wild,
overpowering panic, and hid in a clumsy amateurish fashion until in
ninety-five cases out of a hundred he was caught and convicted. The
murderer who took the offensive instead of bolting, who was as cool
as a cucumber instead of being panic-stricken, and, most important
of all, was no amateur at his job but a highly-skilled
professional, was a phenomenon quite outside their experience and
calculations. Kerrigan, reaching this point in his meditations,
called a halt in his search for Lady Caroline until he had gone up
to his room to get his pair of neat little black automatic pistols.
With men like the Duke about the place, it was just as well to be
armed and ready. Even that queer-looking Colombian servant would be
more respectful in an emergency if he found himself at the business
end of one of those pistols. Normally, Kerrigan relied on his own
quickness and a length of gas-piping to carry him through the
ordinary rough-and-tumble of life in a quiet country like England.
But if Chicago methods were going to be introduced, they would have
to be met by Chicago methods. The only trouble was that when he
reached his room he found that the lock of his suit-case had been
clumsily forced, and that his neat little black automatic pistols
had vanished.</p>

<p>Peter Kerrigan sat down on his bed, lit a Russian cigarette, and
put in some hard thinking. There was one vitally important question
which had to be solved somehow or other at the earliest possible
moment, and that was: did the thief break open the suit-case in
order to disarm Kerrigan, or did he break open the suit-case to
find something else and simply appropriate the pistols as a
by-product, so to speak?</p>

<p>If the former, then somebody knew that he was a dangerous
fellow, a man who was liable to have pistols in his luggage and who
ought to be deprived of those pistols at an early date. If the
latter, the position was not nearly so serious. It might mean an
ordinary sneak-thief, or some one who wanted to make certain that
Kerrigan was not masquerading, or some one who was examining all
the luggage in the house. In the event of it being one of these
three types of thief, the mere discovery of a pair of pistols would
not necessarily lead to the deduction that he, Kerrigan, was a
formidable individual. It might just as easily mean that he was
panic-stricken at the idea of living in a house where two murders
had recently been committed and had laid in an arsenal for the
purpose of self-protection.</p>

<p>The identity of the thief was at present undiscoverable.
Kerrigan had no finger-print apparatus nor microscope, nor indeed
any technical detective skill. All he could do was to wait and see,
and, in the meantime, use every means possible to replace his lost
weapons. That was more than ever vitally important now that it was
almost certain that there were active enemies inside the house as
well as outside. He went downstairs and unobtrusively slipped into
the gun-room to investigate the possibilities there. All the
shot-guns and rook-rifles which had adorned the walls of the
gun-room had vanished.</p>

<p>It was an extremely thoughtful Kerrigan who walked slowly down
the long corridor towards the telephone, and before he had reached
the instrument he had decided not to use it. There were too many
chances of being overheard, and he was particularly anxious that
the gentleman who had rifled his suit-case should not know that he
was already aware of the theft and fully on his guard.</p>

<p>To purchase a firearm of some kind at a gunsmith's either in
Bicester or in Aylesbury would involve the necessity of obtaining a
gun-licence from the police and, although he was fairly ignorant of
the workings of the British police on its routine, civil side, he
was pretty confident that a local gendarmerie would be unlikely to
hand over a gun-licence at a moment's notice to a total stranger
who was not even a resident in the district. It might be possible
to slip out and drive to a telephone-box and ask Barney Smail to
send a gun down by special messenger. On the other hand, the entire
district for miles round would already be seething with detectives
and policemen, and it was any odds that every telephone call would
be tapped and docketed and the sender traced; some zealous country
bobby might easily clap him into the local stocks and keep him
there all night before Fleming could arrive to bail him out. And it
would be utterly impossible to leave Lady Caroline to cope with a
possible inrush of thugs and gunmen during the night. There was no
alternative but to do the best he could without firearms, and it
was in rather a gloomy frame of mind for one who was by nature so
buoyant, that he entered one of the smaller sitting-rooms and found
a regular family row in progress. Lord Claydon, Lady Caroline
Marsh, and Sir George Ilford were all talking simultaneously,
rather loudly, and all three were indulging in small but vehement
gesticulations. Had Peter Kerrigan been a perfect gentlemen, the
fine flower of Eton and Trinity, he would have backed out of the
room with a mumbled apology. Had he been a thick-skinned
counter-jumper, he would have pretended to notice nothing and would
have advanced brazenly towards the vociferating group. But being,
as he was, somewhere between the two, he stood in the doorway and
watched the trio with unfeigned interest.</p>

<p>The two men stopped at once and stared at him, but Lady Caroline
only glanced over her shoulder and went straight on, through a
chorus of hisses and "hushes," in her high-pitched voice, "Publish
and be damned. Publish and be damned."</p>

<p>"Will you stop your infernal squawking?" shouted Lord Claydon.
It was the first time that Kerrigan had seen him display any
vigorous emotion. He was red in the face and perspiring.</p>

<p>"I will not stop my infernal squawking," retorted the old lady
with spirit. "I'm squawking for your good, as you very well know!
It's the only sensible thing to do. Come in, Peter Kerrigan, and
don't stand there like a street-boy watching a dog-fight."</p>

<p>Sir George Ilford's deep voice chimed in:</p>

<p>"If you say a word in front of that young sweep&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" snapped Lady Caroline. "Yes, George Ilford? And what will
happen if I do?"</p>

<p>"I'll break his neck."</p>

<p>"And be hanged for your pains, and a good job, too. Don't you
see, you pair of great fools, that you've got no other course open?
Either you publish and be damned, or you use violence. There's no
third course. Will you come into this room, Peter Kerrigan, or must
I come for you and haul you in by the ears?"</p>

<p>Kerrigan advanced slowly, keeping an eye alert for the enormous
baronet, whose scowling face and clenched fists added but little to
the charm of his formidable appearance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kerrigan is now my secretary and colleague," went on Lady
Caroline. "Did you get the Boy Scouts?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. There has been a certain amount of activity on
the Western Front since I set out boy-scouting, so to speak."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't time to listen to all that now. I want to tell
you what's going on here."</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind!" shouted Lord Claydon, and
Ilford exclaimed, "A dirty little tout!"</p>

<p>"He's never heard of Shakespeare," replied Lady Caroline
sharply, "but he's a first-class hand at everything else. And he's
my secretary, and if I mayn't consult my own secretary, who the
devil may I consult? Yes, George, I said 'Who the devil,' and I
mean 'Who the devil'!"</p>

<p>"Do you seriously propose, Caroline," asked Lord Claydon, "to
admit a total stranger into my family secrets?"</p>

<p>"Not all of them, you fool."</p>

<p>Lord Claydon did not appear to be a man of great stamina. He had
shot his bolt, and with a gesture of despair he sat down on a sofa.
Sir George Ilford looked at him for a moment and then at the
indomitable old lady, and then said, more calmly:</p>

<p>"I suppose if your mind is made up to tell him, nothing will
stop you."</p>

<p>"Nothing!" she replied, with a sort of grim cheerfulness. Ilford
shrugged his massive shoulders and walked over to the window.</p>

<p>"Peter!" went on Lady Caroline in a rapid undertone, "it's like
this. That damnable old Mr. Tollemache is the biggest and most
poisonous blackmailer in the world."</p>

<p>Kerrigan gaped.</p>

<p>"That inoffensive old fish!" he exclaimed. "I thought he was an
authenticated, all-square-and-above-board art-valuer and
collector!"</p>

<p>"So he is. He's a collector all right. Only he does most of his
collecting by blackmail. He's genuinely crazy about Art and Old
Masters and that sort of thing, and as he never has any money to
buy them with, he hit upon this simpler method of getting hold of
them."</p>

<p>"And he's got something against Lord Claydon?" inquired
Kerrigan. Lady Caroline nodded.</p>

<p>"I see. Yes, that explains a good deal," went on the young man
thoughtfully. "He was going to exchange the incriminating documents
for the pick of these Old Masters, and then he suddenly heard that
we were all hot on the track of the famous Treasure, and he's
holding off on the chance that he may be able to add that to the
bag. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"There are a lot of things which might be said against you,"
observed Lady Caroline, "but no one could say that your mind works
slowly."</p>

<p>"So, of course, Lord Claydon doesn't want the Treasure found
just yet awhile," said Kerrigan.</p>

<p>Lord Claydon said nothing, but George Ilford answered for
him.</p>

<p>"We've got to the end of our tether. We've told Tollemache that
unless he accepts the original bargain&mdash;the documents against
the pictures&mdash;by to-morrow evening, we'll tell him to go to
hell."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd tell him to go to hell now," said Lady Caroline
pugnaciously.</p>

<p>Lord Claydon mumbled, "No, no, no."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Kerrigan, "I see where we stand. We've got to
postpone finding the Treasure until to-morrow for fear that
Tollemache may scoop it. And we've got to find it at the earliest
possible moment for fear that the Duke may scoop it. It's a pretty
problem."</p>

<p>"The so-called Duke," said Ilford, "hasn't much of a chance.
Half the police in England are after him. He'll be too occupied in
looking after his own skin to worry any more about the
Treasure."</p>

<p>"He managed to spare the time," replied Kerrigan quietly, "to
murder John Hone a mile from here about half an hour ago."</p>

<p>The other three were stricken into an appalled and
half-incredulous silence, broken at last by Lord Claydon, who said
vaguely:</p>

<p>"John Hone? My librarian that was?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The man who started all this trouble by deciphering the
first clue and hiding the second clue."</p>

<p>"Murdered! But why?" Lord Claydon seemed utterly befogged.</p>

<p>"Because he was coming back to collar the Treasure."</p>

<p>Sir George Ilford spoke, and it was noticeable that for the
first time he addressed Kerrigan as if he was a social equal:</p>

<p>"Then you think this Duke fellow may have another go at the
house to-night?"</p>

<p>"I've no idea of what his plans are, or are likely to be. He's
obviously a man of astonishing nerve."</p>

<p>"Then what do you advise?" Kerrigan heroically did not allow
himself even the suggestion of a smile at the change in the
baronet's tone.</p>

<p>"It isn't only the Duke we've got to reckon with," he observed.
"I'm not sure that I care for this fellow Streatfield."</p>

<p>"Streatfield!" exclaimed Lord Claydon, arousing himself from his
lethargy. "The fellow's going to marry Pamela. He's as straight as
a die."</p>

<p>"You can be as straight as a die and still be fond of a million
pounds."</p>

<p>"But do you mean to suggest that he and Pamela would walk off
with the thing if they found it?"</p>

<p>"I think they might dish out a small share of it all round, but
I fancy that Streatfield would find it difficult to part with the
bulk of it."</p>

<p>"I simply don't believe you," asseverated Lord Claydon.
"Besides, neither he nor Pamela have got the brains to find
it."</p>

<p>"No. But that red-haired girl has," replied Kerrigan. "She's got
as far as we have already."</p>

<p>"What!" shrilled Lady Caroline. "Rosemary Shackleford has got as
far as Ben Jonson?"</p>

<p>"She has. She's reached Volume Five of his immortal works."</p>

<p>Lady Caroline calmed down suddenly into a stern grimness.</p>

<p>"So that in your opinion it's become a triple problem, eh?
Tollemache, the Duke, and Streatfield," asked Ilford.</p>

<p>"Yes. And I think that you, Lady Caroline, could knock out the
Streatfield party, if you could get hold of the Shackleford girl.
Couldn't you see her and persuade her to come over to our side? Put
all the cards on the table. Tell her the whole story. Streatfield
will be absolutely useless without her."</p>

<p>"I refuse to believe," reiterated Lord Claydon, "that my
daughter is capable of behaving in the slightest degree badly
towards me. She knows that I'm in financial straits, and she
wouldn't hesitate to stand by me."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Lady Caroline dryly. "But we might just as well
be on the safe side, and take no risks."</p>

<p>"The point is," said Ilford, "what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Have you a pistol?" asked Kerrigan suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes. In my room upstairs. Why?"</p>

<p>"Will you lend it to me?"</p>

<p>Ilford stared at him suspiciously. "Most certainly not."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," said Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"I expect you do. But I'm not such a half-witted fool as you
seem to think." He marched to the door and went out.</p>

<p>Kerrigan turned to Lady Caroline.</p>

<p>"Will you try and detach that girl from Streatfield? It would
save one complication if you could manage it. Things are difficult
enough as they are."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I'll try."</p>

<p>"Even if you fail, find out why she's so keen on helping
Streatfield. Find out what their idea is. Find out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll find out everything there is to know," she replied
emphatically. "In the meantime, what about that second clue?"</p>

<p>"We're no worse off than any one else with the possible
exception of the Duke. He may have extracted its whereabouts from
Hone. But Streatfield is no nearer than we are, and Tollemache
isn't so near. The real danger is another of the Duke's dashing
raids. The man is really rather superb, you know."</p>

<p>The door opened noisily and Ilford strode in; his dark face was
darker than ever, and he was breathing heavily. He went straight up
to Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"I say!" he exclaimed, "my room's been burgled, and my pistol's
gone!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" murmured the other softly, "whoever it is, he's a thorough
sort of worker. When did you see it last?"</p>

<p>"I don't know when I saw it last, but I know that my room hadn't
been burgled this afternoon after lunch when I went up to get a
handkerchief. It's in a damnable mess now."</p>

<p>"Where was the pistol?"</p>

<p>"In a drawer of the dressing-table."</p>

<p>"Loaded?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kerrigan, "there's no point in taking any
unnecessary risks. I'm going to ring up the Chief Constable of the
county and get in touch with my friend Fleming. I've got the
impression that things are likely to start moving this evening
after dark. Lady Caroline, perhaps you would have the kindness to
go and see Miss Shackleford. Sir George, not a word about your
pistol. We're in deep waters. We've got to go carefully."</p>

<p>"Yes, but who took it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I strongly suspect my friend Tarzan, the
pride of Colombia."</p>

<p>"Streatfield's man?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I won't listen to a word against Streatfield," said Lord
Claydon. "He's going to marry my daughter, Pamela."</p>

<p>No one paid any attention to him, and Kerrigan went off to
telephone to London. Five minutes later he was seated in a big
chair in the hall, once again thinking hard&mdash;for the telephone
was out of order.</p>

<p>"It's only two miles to Bicester," he murmured, "but the man who
cut the wire knows that as well as I do, so the road will be neatly
ambushed between us and that admirable burg. Now, whatever am I to
do?"</p>

<h2 id='ch14'>XIV<br>
A GAME OF POKER</h2>

<p>Of all the people inside the walls of Marsh Manor that evening,
only Peter Kerrigan knew the full implications and possibilities of
the situation. Of the rest, each knew a certain amount about the
activities and intentions of some of the others, but only he was
fully aware of the hidden dangers which surrounded the house from
without and threatened it from within.</p>

<p>But although he was so alive to the situation, he was completely
in the dark as to what, if anything, was likely to happen, and what
he ought to do. The most menacing danger was unquestionably from
the Duke; the most annoying was the fear that Streatfield and his
melodramatic Colombian would make fools of themselves and start
shooting; the most subtle attack would undoubtedly come from Mr.
Tollemache. Mr. Tollemache was a new factor in the situation, and a
rather disturbing factor. A man who had amassed a very large
fortune from blackmail was obviously a man to be watched, not
because he would be liable to a sudden violence, but because he
must be a man of patient, far-seeing intelligence. He was a man of
brains, whereas the Duke was a man of brilliant action, and
Streatfield a man of clumsy forcefulness.</p>

<p>Tollemache was certainly a man to watch. It was, of course, very
difficult to estimate just how much he knew. For example, did he
suspect Kerrigan to be more than an ordinary police-spy or a
journalist? It was of great importance to know whether he
underestimated his capacity. Streatfield unquestionably
underestimated him, and the Duke did not know of his existence. The
attitude of Tollemache had to be discovered, and Kerrigan decided
to set about discovering it at once.</p>

<p>The art-valuer was sitting in the billiard-room, wearing a
purple velvet jacket and an ancient pair of black baggy trousers
and bedroom slippers, studying the current number of the
<i>Burlington Magazine</i>. He looked up benignly as Kerrigan came
in, and laid down the periodical.</p>

<p>"Ah! my young friend, come in, come in&mdash;I've had no one to
talk to all day. Come and have a chat before we go off to dress for
dinner. It is only seven o'clock."</p>

<p>Kerrigan sat down and picked up the <i>Burlington</i> with a
grimace.</p>

<p>"Rather outside my line of country," he said. "I'm afraid I'm
not a very brainy sort of chap."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have to be very quick at figures in the insurance
business," replied Mr. Tollemache. "Every one has a speciality.
Yours is figures, mine is art. You wouldn't be able to detect a
first-class forgery of a picture. I wouldn't be able to add up a
column of figures correctly. Would you care for a game of
billiards? I am but an indifferent performer."</p>

<p>"So am I," replied Kerrigan, "but I would be delighted to
play."</p>

<p>At a quarter to eight Mr. Tollemache was leading by forty-two
points to thirty-nine; the highest break on either side having been
seven, which included a fluke, and Kerrigan, as he went up to dress
for dinner, admitted that he had learnt nothing whatever about
him.</p>

<p>In the corridor outside his room he found Streatfield in earnest
conversation with his villainous-looking Colombian servant.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Streatfield," he said genially; "having a heart-to-heart
talk with the missing link? What's doing in the tree-tops, Mowgli?
Everything all serene and jolly?"</p>

<p>They paid no attention to him beyond a couple of sour glances,
and Streatfield went on talking in swift South American Spanish.
Kerrigan pretended that his door was locked, and searched his
pockets for the key.</p>

<p>"At eleven o'clock sharp," Streatfield was saying, "and have the
car ready by the back gate of the park. And mind, no shooting
unless it's absolutely essential."</p>

<p>"So they, at any rate, have not lost their guns," thought
Kerrigan as he went into his room. A moment later there was a knock
at the door and Lady Caroline came in. Her lips were tightly closed
and her whole expression was one of stern annoyance.</p>

<p>"It's no good," she said; "she won't leave them."</p>

<p>"What's her idea?"</p>

<p>"Her idea," replied Lady Caroline in a tone which made it very
obvious what she thought of Rosemary Shackleford, "is to stand by
Pamela and her young man."</p>

<p>"And do you mean to say that Lady Pamela is out to rob her own
father?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what it amounts to."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Kerrigan; "I was under the impression that I
knew a thing or two about tough circles, but I haven't often met
charming young ladies who want to rob their papas."</p>

<p>"It's all that young man," snapped Lady Caroline. "I've met the
type before. He's one of the ambitious kind. Not content with a
hundred thousand pounds&mdash;must have a million. And that suits
Pamela down to the ground. She's a girl who likes a good time and
doesn't mind who has to pay for it so long as she gets it. And that
Shackleford girl is her best friend and is going to stand by
her."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it doesn't really matter," replied Kerrigan. "The
immediate and pressing danger is not from her brains; it's more
from other folks' guns. After dinner to-night, Lady C., you've got
to retire to your room and lock yourself in. We can't have you
getting in the way of bullets."</p>

<p>"I shall do exactly what I choose, young man."</p>

<p>"No, really," begged Kerrigan. "I must ask you to keep out of
the way to-night. I shall have my hands full enough as it is,
without having to worry about you."</p>

<p>"Never mind about me; I can look after myself. And now I must go
and dress for dinner." Lady Caroline paused at the door. "What do
you really think is likely to happen? Anything at all?"</p>

<p>"Quite possibly nothing at all. It all depends on whether the
Duke knows where to look for that second clue. If he does, he may
make a desperate dash for it. And then things will move. If he
doesn't, quite possibly nothing at all may happen. Personally, I
think he'll turn up."</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do if he does?"</p>

<p>"I shall hang around and wait for what old man Shakespeare would
probably have called a spot of inspiration."</p>

<p>"He would have called it nothing of the sort," said Lady
Caroline severely.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kerrigan was first down into the drawing-room before dinner, and
he had already refused a cocktail before the next-comer, Rosemary
Shackleford, appeared. He never touched alcohol if there was the
prospect of a wild night before him. It was one of his few rules in
life. Miss Shackleford took a glass from the tray and drained it at
one gulp.</p>

<p>"No cocktail for you, Mr. Kerrigan?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I've already had three," he answered, with a very fine
imitation of a self-conscious giggle, "and, to tell you the truth,
I'm not really very accustomed to such strong drinks. At home I
only have a little beer now and then."</p>

<p>"Three already! Do have another and see what happens!"</p>

<p>Kerrigan with another giggle took a glass and held it up to the
light and then laid it on the window-sill.</p>

<p>"I shall go all funny," he said, "but never mind. Eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die, eh?"</p>

<p>The girl started a little at the peculiar aptness of the
quotation and looked suspiciously at him. His face betrayed no
emotion except a beaming and all-embracing geniality.</p>

<p>The next moment Streatfield came in quietly, and she turned to
speak to him. With a swift movement Kerrigan threw the contents of
his glass out of the window and lifted the glass to his lips as if
he had just drained it off.</p>

<p>"I say, I say!" he exclaimed, spluttering a little, and
coughing. "You were quite right, Miss Shackleford. Quite right. I
needed just one more. I say, how right you were! How marvellously
and beautifully right! What a marvellously and beautifully right
person you are!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he intercepted a swift glance which passed between
the other two. Streatfield replied smoothly:</p>

<p>"I am glad you find Miss Shackleford's advice good. I have been
known to take it myself, sometimes."</p>

<p>"Streatfield, old chap," said Kerrigan. "You are an
exceptionally wise and splendid fellow! I admire you a very great
deal. Do you mind my admiring you a very great deal? You're so
efficient and competent. I wish I was efficient and competent."</p>

<p>"I always admire efficiency," murmured a soft voice at the door
as Mr. Tollemache came quietly in, and the conversation became more
or less general. Kerrigan talked incessantly for about ten minutes,
and then pretended to get sleepy. It gave him a natural and
reasonable opportunity for watching the others. During dinner,
Rosemary, Pamela, and Streatfield drank a good deal, Sir George
Ilford even more, and Lord Claydon hardly paused in the steady
succession of glasses of wine which he poured down his throat. Mr.
Tollemache drank water, and Lady Caroline a single whisky and
soda.</p>

<p>After dinner Kerrigan pretended to fall asleep on a sofa and
only woke up when a game of poker was suggested by Streatfield. In
an hour he had managed to lose thirty-four pounds, mainly to Lady
Pamela, whose spirits rose proportionately. At half-past ten the
game fizzled out in the face of a heavy series of ostentatious
yawns from Streatfield, and the party began to break up for the
night. Before any one actually left the drawing-room, however,
Streatfield turned to Lord Claydon and said:</p>

<p>"What about locking-up? Would you like me to give you a
hand?"</p>

<p>Lord Claydon jumped eagerly at the offer and, with Sir George
Ilford, set out for a tour of the house, locking, bolting,
shuttering, and barring.</p>

<p>Lady Caroline retired to her room, Lady Pamela drifted out, Mr.
Tollemache had vanished some time ago, and Kerrigan was left alone
with Rosemary. She went across to him and whispered, "Mr.
Kerrigan!"</p>

<p>"Eh?" he blinked, and half-stifled a yawn.</p>

<p>"Don't talk too loud. I want to tell you something."</p>

<p>Kerrigan concealed the alertness with which he was
listening.</p>

<p>"Well?" he drawled.</p>

<p>"It's about Lady Caroline," she murmured, "I want to help her
without hurting poor Pamela, and I think I know how to do it."</p>

<p>"Help her! I didn't know she wanted help. In what sort of
way?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that. Will you take a message from me to
her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then tell her to look in the wooden box at the foot of the
cellar stairs," and with that the red-haired girl turned on her
heel and went out.</p>

<p>Kerrigan had to act quickly. If he sat on the sofa and
considered the position for more than five seconds, the girl would
know that his suspicions were aroused and that, therefore, he was a
man to be carefully watched. He jumped up and, singing softly but
unmelodiously, walked unsteadily to the door and up the stairs. As
he went, he saw, over the balustrade, the party of three who were
locking up the house. They seemed to be making a thorough job of
it.</p>

<p>He knocked at Lady Caroline's door and was admitted. The old
lady was sitting bolt upright in a wooden chair studying an Italian
grammar; she listened with interest to the message and, at the end,
said emphatically:</p>

<p>"I thought that girl would come round. It wouldn't be in human
nature to back Pamela against her father. Run down to the cellar
and investigate, Peter, and come back here at once."</p>

<p>Kerrigan resumed his slightly swaying progress, descended the
stairs, and drifted off in the direction of the entrance to the
cellar. The big iron door at the top of the cellar stairs was
open&mdash;apparently the locking-up party had not reached that
part of the house&mdash;and, with a quick glance to make sure that
he was unobserved, he slipped through and went down. The stairway
was only illuminated by the light from the corridor above, and
after its first right-angle twist it became difficult to see more
than a yard or two. At the foot there was a second iron door, also
part of the mad Lord Claydon's legacy to his posterity, and
Kerrigan pushed it open and went in. He switched on an electric
torch and surveyed his surroundings. The cellar was large and
empty, save for a pile of old furniture heaped in one corner. The
huge safe stood against the far wall&mdash;its door wide
open&mdash;and beside it lay a wooden packing-case. Beyond the safe
a blank opening led to an inner cellar. Kerrigan paused to listen
and then, hearing no sound, advanced to the packing-case. It was
quite empty, and just as he had satisfied himself that there was
nothing in it or under it, he heard the cellar door shut with a
snap and the sound of bolts being shot and footsteps faintly
receding up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Stung!" he remarked aloud. "Very badly stung indeed."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of him that he spent no time cursing or
regretting or kicking himself. He had made two bad mistakes in
thinking that the girl Rosemary had underestimated him and in
underestimating her himself; and the only thing to do was to set
about retrieving the position at the earliest possible moment. The
first thing, obviously, was to explore the inner cellar, and he
made for the black oblong which marked the entrance to it. But as
he reached the entrance he got a really nasty shock, for a voice
with a palpable American accent observed out of the darkness, "Oh
boy, I've sure got you covered with a pop-gun!" and a rival
electric torch burst into light. Kerrigan swung his own torch round
and let it rest upon a man who was standing, pistol in hand, a
dozen paces away.</p>

<p>"Put your hands up," said this gentleman pleasantly, "and keep
them up till I say the word."</p>

<p>A swift and expert search revealed that Kerrigan carried, by way
of arsenal, no firearms, but two lengths of gas-pipe and a pair of
knuckle-dusters. The man with the pistol annexed these.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, lighting a small but powerful oil-lantern,
"let's have all the news."</p>

<p>Kerrigan looked at him with interest. He was a tough-looking
citizen with a very thick, short neck and square shoulders and
ugly, knobbly hands. He was only redeemed from downright ugliness
by a cheerful gleam in his pale blue eyes. He looked a rascal, but
a rascal with a sense of humour.</p>

<p>"The chief bit of news," said Kerrigan, "is that we're locked
in."</p>

<p>"You don't say!" replied the thug casually, and Kerrigan knew at
once that one problem was solved. There was an alternative exit to
the cellar, or the man would have displayed more emotion at finding
himself a prisoner.</p>

<p>"And what are you doing down here, boy?" went on the other.</p>

<p>"Looking for mice," replied Kerrigan, and the American
laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, you've sure caught more than you expected! Still I'm glad
you've come, boy. I was getting mighty lonesome down here. Don't
get fresh, though! I'd hate to have to load you up with lead. I'd
get lonesome again if I had to bump you off."</p>

<p>"That's all right," replied Peter heartily. "I know the business
end of a gun when I see one. I'm not one of your storm-troops.
Well, and what's it all about?"</p>

<p>The American pulled out a chair from the heap of old furniture
in the corner and sat down comfortably, and crossed his legs and
put the pistol on his knee.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just a spot of business," he observed. "My boss is
after some game or other and I'm waiting for orders. That's
all."</p>

<p>"What is the game?"</p>

<p>The gunman yawned.</p>

<p>"Oh boy, I don't know, and if I did, I don't think I would run
round shouting the good tidings to perfect strangers."</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I sit down, too?" asked Kerrigan, and without
waiting for an answer he pulled out another chair and sat down. His
mind was racing furiously. He was in a fix and at the moment he
could see no way out. It was getting on for eleven o'clock and
things would soon be starting to move aloft. It would be the height
of folly to attempt any rash <i>coup de temps</i> against this
square-headed tough. But the square-headed tough solved the problem
himself. He was a man who could shoot like a machine, face other
people's bullets, stand loyally by his boss through thick and thin,
run incredible risks unflinchingly, but he could not stand being
bored. For over an hour he had been sitting alone in a dark, damp
cellar, and there was every prospect of having to sit there for
several hours more. It was an intolerable situation.</p>

<p>"Say!" he exclaimed hoarsely and suddenly, "do you play the
poker-game at all, mister?" and he produced a pack of cards from
his pocket. Kerrigan tried very hard not to let a flash of elation
come into his eyes; he dropped his eyelids, and said:</p>

<p>"I used to play a bit. I haven't played lately very much."</p>

<p>"Care for a game?" asked the other with elaborate
carelessness.</p>

<p>"I don't mind."</p>

<p>"No tricks now. Or you'll never open another jackpot on this
side of hell. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. I'm not fool enough to play around with that
gun."</p>

<p>"Good," said the thug. "Fetch out one of those tables."</p>

<p>When the table was set, the American laid the pistol down beside
his right hand and began to deal. In the middle of the deal he
stopped and remarked, "I'm a sportsman, see? I could take all your
wad of dollars without having to play for them, see? But I'm a
sportsman, and I like a game. Now, ante up, and don't get
fresh."</p>

<p>For four or five hands they played in silence&mdash;Kerrigan
winning two or three small pots and his opponent a couple of
slightly larger ones. Then Kerrigan held three tens and defeated
three fives, and the American paid over four pounds and frowned. A
few minutes later Kerrigan defeated a straight with a flush, and
the American paid over eleven pounds and scowled. Kerrigan judged
that the time had come for opening his campaign. It was his deal,
and he dealt himself three sevens and his opponent a pair of kings.
He drew two pairs to fill his full-house and gave his opponent a
pair of aces and a king. A moment or two later the highly gratified
American was raking in seventeen pounds odd. From then onwards the
latter won steadily. Kerrigan's dealing was skilful, and his play
was suitably adjusted to the hands which he allotted to his
opponent and himself. After a quarter of an hour he decided that
the moment had come for the decisive stroke. He would have liked to
have left it longer, but he simply did not dare. Even now it might
be too late. Anything might be happening upstairs. Battle, Murder,
and Sudden Death might be in full swing, and, worse still, his
quarter share in a million pounds sterling might be vanishing.</p>

<p>"Have you got any more dough?" inquired the jubilantly
triumphant American. "I've got a whole packet of these pounds of
yours," and he crumpled up the pile of notes in front of him into a
ball.</p>

<p>"I've got a few more," said Kerrigan, dealing himself four tens
and his opponent four nines, and recapturing sixty-five pounds. The
jubilation faded abruptly and the scowl darkened as Kerrigan
remarked sneeringly, "You damned Yanks think you know a thing or
two about poker, eh? It's like robbing blind puppies."</p>

<p>"You shut your mouth, blast you!" said the bandit furiously,
laying his hand on his gun.</p>

<p>"Go on, shoot!" replied Kerrigan. "You can get money that way.
You'll never get it by poker."</p>

<p>The other dealt sulkily and a small pot went to Kerrigan. The
supreme moment had arrived. Kerrigan dealt himself the two, three,
four, and five of hearts, and drew the six of hearts to complete
his straight flush. He dealt the American the seven, eight, nine,
ten, and knave of spades. The bidding stopped at two hundred and
ten pounds when Kerrigan, leaning back in his chair, obviously well
out of reach of the pistol, said with a jeering little laugh:</p>

<p>"I'm going to see you, and I'm going to collect your money, Mr.
Damned Yank. There you are: Two of hearts, three of hearts, four of
hearts, five of hearts, six of hearts! Run away back to Yankland,
boy, and learn ludo."</p>

<p>The American looked at the cards, and then a shattering laugh
echoed round the cellar, as he put his cards down, one by one as
Kerrigan had done, saying between laughs:</p>

<p>"Seven of spades, eight of spades, nine of spades, ten of
spades, jack of spades," and finishing up with another roar.</p>

<p>Kerrigan lay a little farther back in his chair, stretched his
legs out under the table, and kicked the American a terrific blow
on the right elbow. Then he sprang up, knocking the table over as
he did so, and hit him accurately upon the point of the jaw. The
bandit went over backwards, and Kerrigan, ignoring the Queensberry
rules, public-school traditions, and the British sense of fair-play
and sportsmanship, instead of waiting for the prostrate adversary
to rise, kicked him sharply on the jaw again. Complete silence fell
upon the cellar, broken only by a gentle laugh as Kerrigan stooped
and picked up the pistol. He then resumed possession of his own
humbler armament of lead-piping and knuckle-dusters, carefully
pocketed all the pound notes, and then made a rapid survey of the
cellar. He soon found what he was looking for&mdash;a length of
rope&mdash;and it only took him a moment or two to tie up his
recent poker adversary into a condition resembling an ancient
Egyptian mummy. Kerrigan had once served for a few months as a
sailor, and he was good at knots. Then, after rolling the mummy
into a corner out of the way, he took the lantern and went to look
for the exit which he knew must exist. Its discovery was an easy
matter, for the bandit had left the door open. It was a low door,
whitewashed to match the cellar walls, and it fitted with
extraordinary smoothness and exactitude into its place, so that
when it was shut it was impossible to distinguish between it and
the surrounding wall. It was heavily backed with bricks, presumably
to prevent its being discovered by a betraying echo, and it swung
on massive iron hinges, which, he noticed, had been recently
oiled.</p>

<p>Kerrigan went through it, lantern in one hand and gun in the
other, and down a narrow passage which ended in another door
leading into a long-disused, half-subterranean washhouse. Three
stone steps led from the washhouse into the garden, and a yard or
two from the top of the steps a large motor-bicycle and side-car
was standing under the shelter of a spreading rhododendron.</p>

<p>Kerrigan was much too cautious a campaigner to put down his
lantern and his gun in order to rub his hands with delight, but
that was what he felt like doing. From being locked helpless in a
dark cellar, he had already so transformed the situation that he
was now fully armed, and had placed himself astride of the line of
retreat of one of his opponents. It was definitely a good
beginning. The next point to be decided was whether or not to put
the motor-bicycle out of action. It would certainly prevent the
escape of somebody, presumably the Duke, and if that somebody had
got hold of the Treasure, or even of the second clue only, it would
be a matter of the most vital importance to prevent their escape.
On the other hand, suppose that the owner of the motor-bicycle had
failed to get hold of what he was after, and was flying for his
life, it would be decidedly unpleasant to compel him to stay at the
Manor and fight his way to safety on foot. The Duke at bay, with
nothing to lose by displaying the accuracy of his marksmanship,
would be a tough proposition. Kerrigan decided to compromise by
letting almost all the petrol out of the tank. It was nearly full,
and he drained away all except a quarter of an inch into a large
tin bath which he found in the cobwebby washhouse. Then he
extinguished the lantern and proceeded on hands and knees
cautiously round the house. There were two main dangers which he
had to contend with&mdash;the professional skill of the Duke, and
the amateurish clumsiness of Streatfield and his melodramatic
Colombian. Probably, he reflected, Tarzan was at that very moment
creeping about in the garden on his tummy with a knife in his
teeth. During a youth spent in the jungles of Colombia he must have
become an expert in the art of stealthy night-rambling. He might be
lurking in every shadow or following him with murderous and
noiseless footsteps. Kerrigan could not prevent himself from
looking over his shoulder. He could have sworn he saw something
move near that big beech tree. There it was again&mdash;and again.
Kerrigan held his breath and lay as flat as he could. There was a
long silence. An owl hooted very loudly from a plane tree almost
overhead, and Kerrigan, his eyes fixed on the shadows at the foot
of the beech, wondered if the Colombian had taken to
tree-climbing.</p>

<p>Then the thing moved again, quite definitely this time, and an
elderly rabbit came trotting slowly out on to the centre of the
lawn and sat down to admire the view.</p>

<p>"Stout fellow!" thought Kerrigan with a sigh of relief. "So long
as you sit there and don't get the wind up, it means that my rear
is all safe. Avanti, Savoiardi," and he crept forward again towards
the back of the house. A few yards farther on he stopped again.
Light footsteps were coming very quickly up a gravel path in front
of him, and then he saw for a brief moment the silhouette of what
looked like either a woman or a boy muffled up in a long overcoat
hurrying past, holding what looked extremely like a rifle or a
shot-gun. The silhouette vanished against a background of dark
shrubs, and the next moment there was the sound of a door being
cautiously opened and shut. Kerrigan backed under the protection of
a weeping willow to consider this new development. The gun might
not have been a gun at all; that was one alternative. It might have
been the boot-boy returning from a little nocturnal fishing
expedition. Or it might have been a housemaid who had been on her
evening out, and had taken a stick to reassure herself against the
possibility of encountering tramps or drunks. Or it might have been
the Duke himself. He was said to be a smallish man. On the other
hand that was a little unlikely, because the Duke would surely not
use a rifle or a shot-gun. But again it might have been the Duke
carrying something else&mdash;an oxyacetylene burner, for instance,
or a rope-ladder, or any one of a score of implements and
contrivances for making away with other people's quarter-shares in
hidden treasure. Anyway, whoever it was, he had got in by the back
door, and Kerrigan determined to try and do the same. It was easier
than he had anticipated. A nervous kitchen-maid in a dressing-gown
opened the door on the chain and peered out anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry to bother you," said Kerrigan softly. "I'm one
of the guests in the house and I'm locked out. I wonder if you
would mind letting me in? I don't want to disturb the butler by
ringing the front-door bell."</p>

<p>The girl, after a moment's hesitation, undid the chain and let
him in.</p>

<p>"You're up late," said Kerrigan pleasantly, as he entered. "Been
out?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir," stammered the maid.</p>

<p>"Ah! I saw some one come in just in front of me. I wondered who
it was."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no one came in, sir. Mr. Harding gave us strict
orders, sir, that no one was to be let in."</p>

<p>"Mr. Harding?"</p>

<p>"The butler, sir."</p>

<p>"But you let me in."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're different, sir. You're a guest, sir. I recognized
you as soon as I could make you out in the darkness."</p>

<p>Kerrigan pulled a pound note out of his coat-pocket&mdash;one of
the many notes that had recently been crumpled in the fist of the
now mummified bandit&mdash;and handed it to the girl.</p>

<p>"Many thanks for your trouble," he said, "and there's another of
these for you if you'll tell me the name of the person who came in
just now."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any one, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, there was. Carrying a gun. Come, a couple of
pounds."</p>

<p>"No, sir. I promised I wouldn't tell, and I'm not going to
tell."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, what a bore!" said Kerrigan. "You're the sort of girl
that's got a conscience, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I'm not ashamed of it."</p>

<p>"Quite right, too; quite right. Would fifty pounds be any good
towards soothing it?"</p>

<p>But the girl only grew sullen. She obviously did not believe for
a moment that she would ever see even a fraction of fifty pounds if
she gave the information, and she felt that she was being "put
upon." Kerrigan saw that it was useless and he left her, after
assuring her that he would not reveal her guilty secret to Mr.
Harding, the great and omnipotent.</p>

<p>He slipped noiselessly through the green baize door which
separates in all well-regulated households the servants' hall from
the rest of the house, and paused to listen for sounds of clamour
and strife. Everything was quiet.</p>

<h2 id='ch15'>XV<br>
THE DUKE GETS IN</h2>

<p>The first thing that struck Kerrigan was that all the lights
were burning in the passages. The place was a perfect blaze. He
concluded that Lord Claydon and Ilford had had a glimmer of common
sense; darkness would certainly suit the book of the two rival
parties of treasure-hunters. The second thing that struck Kerrigan
was the fact that if darkness was of great importance to the
treasure-hunters, then the main switch of the Manor lights was one
of the key-points in the battlefield. Sooner or later one or other
of the combatants would come creeping down the passage towards the
main switch. The power to plunge the Manor into complete darkness
at a given moment might easily turn the scale in favour of the
party controlling the switch.</p>

<p>Kerrigan returned through the baize door and went down the three
steps to the passage where the switch was situated. There was a
door at the far end of the passage which could be locked and
bolted, but there were no means of securing the baize door. It was,
therefore, impossible to isolate the switch. It was at the mercy of
any one who knew where it was or who happened to stumble upon it.
Nor was it a thing that was likely to be easily overlooked, being a
large, shiny brass lever, protruding about nine inches from its
groove in the wall and labelled "Main Switch" on a brass label
screwed into the wall below it. Above it was a formidable array of
fuse-boxes, dials, wires, and all that central apparatus of an
electric-lighting equipment which so resembles part of the interior
of a submarine. There was no possibility of mistaking it. There,
beyond all reasonable doubt, was the Main Switch.</p>

<p>Kerrigan cast his eyes round for a solution of his problem and
lit upon one at once. On the opposite wall of the passage there was
a second switch, smaller and less highly polished than the other,
labelled "Fire Alarm." A card was pinned on to the wall below the
label, and on it was written, "Pull down to ring fire-bells and
communicate with Bicester Fire Station." With the assistance of a
trusty pocket-screwdriver, it took Peter Kerrigan about one minute
and a quarter to transpose the two labels, and then, shaking with
silent laughter, he went back through the baize door, and into the
main lounge hall of the Manor.</p>

<p>There was no one there, and he sat down in a big arm-chair,
pulled a sofa in front of him so that he was not visible to any one
coming into the lounge, and waited. He was in a commandingly
central position so far as the main part of the house was
concerned. The library, of course, was outside his range of seeing
or hearing, but that could not be helped. All the other
conspirators would be concentrating passionately on the library,
and it would be madness to attempt to butt in at this eleventh
hour. All tactical points of vantage would have been snapped up
ages ago, like the front row of the pit or the unreserved seats at
Wimbledon. He wondered whether they had lined up in a queue for
them. The Colombian was probably sitting up in the gallery armed
with a blow-pipe, while Streatfield lurked about in the shadows
below with a perfect battery of pistols. Kerrigan tried for the
fiftieth time to picture what was likely to happen, and for the
fiftieth time gave it up. He had never in his life been involved in
an affair of such obscurity and difficulty and uncertainty. To be
competing with two rival gangs was nothing new; but it was a
novelty not to have the faintest idea what he was competing
for.</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps from the direction of the billiard-room
interrupted his meditations, and a moment later, by peering round
his arm-chair, he was able to see the powerful figure of Sir George
Ilford striding slowly into the hall, shooting quick glances right
and left as he came. He went to the front door, tried the locks and
bolts, and then tested all the windows. When he came over to
Kerrigan's corner, he started on seeing that young gentleman asleep
on a sofa, hair tousled, face red, breathing loud.</p>

<p>"Here!" exclaimed Ilford, "what are you doing here? Wake up!"
and he shook him roughly.</p>

<p>Kerrigan opened his eyes and smiled benevolently.</p>

<p>"Dear old egg," he murmured dreamily, "why is it that I
associate you with the suburbs of London?" and he closed his eyes
again.</p>

<p>"You're as drunk as an owl!" said Ilford angrily, shaking him
again.</p>

<p>"Your name is Wandsworth," replied Kerrigan, getting up slowly,
running his hands through his hair, blinking foolishly, and
smiling. "Come on, Wandsworth, action! Action! that's the cry. You
lead and I follow. Or shall I follow and you lead? Whichever you
like; it's all one to me. But if you don't mind I'll just have a
nap first. Forty winks save one, as the Bible says. Night-night,
Tooting, old chap," and he lay down again on the sofa.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of disgust, Ilford tested the window behind
the sofa and then marched to the staircase. As he reached the foot
of it, Lord Claydon appeared at the top.</p>

<p>"All right, George?"</p>

<p>"Yes. All right. Everything's as right as a trivet."</p>

<p>"Same here. I thought I heard voices."</p>

<p>"It's only that insurance tout. He's dead drunk on a sofa over
there. That's all."</p>

<p>"What do you think we ought to do with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, leave him," said Ilford impatiently. "It doesn't matter
what happens to him."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Uncle Harry," said a girl's voice from one of the
first floor corridors; "it's high time you were in bed."</p>

<p>"Is that you, Rosemary? Good-night."</p>

<p>Kerrigan could see the girl join Lord Claydon and lean over the
banisters. She was wearing a flimsy silk dressing-gown and blue
pyjamas and elegant, high-heeled bedroom slippers.</p>

<p>"Every one's gone to bed, I suppose," she remarked, "except you
two gay old night-birds?"</p>

<p>"Almost every one," said Ilford with a dry laugh.</p>

<p>"Shall I switch the lights out?" asked Rosemary.</p>

<p>"No, my dear," replied Lord Claydon with a touch of nervousness
in his manner, "I'll do all that."</p>

<p>She craned her neck over and remarked:</p>

<p>"Don't forget the lights in the billiard-room. They seem to be
in full swing. And the passage leading to the dining-room."</p>

<p>"All right, all right!" said Lord Claydon testily. "You needn't
worry about the lights."</p>

<p>"I'm only trying to save you expense," replied the girl blandly.
"I hate to see such a waste."</p>

<p>There was a pause. It looked as if a deadlock had set in.
Neither of them made a move.</p>

<p>"Well, bedtime!" said Lord Claydon feebly, but nothing happened
until Ilford went slowly up the stairs, nodded to Claydon and the
girl, and vanished. "Time you were in bed, Rosemary," said Lord
Claydon.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not going to bed for ages yet," she replied, "I'm not a
bit sleepy. I think I'll go down and look at the <i>Sketch</i> for
a bit."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I say&mdash;" began her guardian, but she tripped past
him and went nimbly downstairs and ensconced herself with a sheaf
of evening and illustrated papers on the very sofa which was
screening the somnolent drunkard.</p>

<p>"Good-night, uncle," she cried. "You can leave the lights to
me."</p>

<p>Lord Claydon began to come downstairs, paused irresolutely, and
then said:</p>

<p>"How long are you likely to be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about half an hour or so."</p>

<p>"Very well." He hovered about uncertainly and then turned and
went along one of the corridors in the direction, not of his own
room, but of Ilford's, seeking, presumably, comfort and advice.</p>

<p>Rosemary selected the <i>Sketch</i> and the <i>Tatler</i>, and
threw the other papers on the floor beside her, and deep silence
settled upon the main lounge hall of Marsh Manor. It lasted for
about ten minutes, and was broken by the characteristically quiet
arrival of Mr. Tollemache&mdash;the mild-looking, world-wide
celebrity in the art world and, as alleged, in the blackmailing
world as well. His footsteps were almost noiseless and his voice
was soft and caressing.</p>

<p>"Still up, Miss Shackleford?" he murmured, moving a chair in
front of the sofa and sitting down facing her. "I thought I was the
last. I've been almost asleep, I'm sorry to say. What do you think
are the chances of finding the Treasure?"</p>

<p>The girl betrayed no sign of surprise at the sudden directness
of the question.</p>

<p>"I've no idea," she replied. "Are you also a competitor in the
great search?"</p>

<p>"Every one is naturally interested in the whereabouts of a
million pounds, even if it does not belong to oneself. It isn't
lost, what a friend gets."</p>

<p>"You mean that you can always borrow from him?"</p>

<p>"I meant rather that one delights in his good fortune."</p>

<p>"Very Christian of you," said the girl dryly.</p>

<p>"And what is your opinion of the nature of the Treasure?" went
on the art-collector. "Or, better still, of its whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea about either."</p>

<p>"And yet surely a clever girl like you must have solved the
puzzle in those samplers?"</p>

<p>Kerrigan almost betrayed himself with an exclamation. Rosemary
answered truthfully:</p>

<p>"Oh yes, that was easy. How long did it take you, Mr.
Tollemache?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, I didn't actually do it myself. A friend
of mine did it, and told me about it."</p>

<p>"And are you following up what your friend told you? I mean, are
you taking an active interest in the Treasure-hunt, or merely an
academic interest?"</p>

<p>"Believing as I do that the Treasure probably consists of
pictures by Leonardo or Ver Meer, I am taking both an active and
academic interest. And so you've got as far as clue number one,
Miss Shackleford? Do you suppose that any one else in the house
has?"</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>"No, frankly, I don't believe that Uncle Harry or Sir George
could rise to the pure heights of intellect required for the
solution of the problem. I fancy that only your anonymous friend
and I have managed it."</p>

<p>"What about that young man with the curly brown hair?"</p>

<p>She laughed again, gaily and lightheartedly.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Kerrigan!" she replied. "I don't think he's one of the
world's heaven-born puzzle solvers. At the present moment he's
rather drunk and locked in the cellar."</p>

<p>"What!" said Mr. Tollemache sharply.</p>

<p>"I said that dear little Mr. Kerrigan is at present rather drunk
and locked in the cellar. Is there anything worrying you, Mr.
Tollemache?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever," he answered, with all his habitual mild
blandness.</p>

<p>Kerrigan was puzzled. The little blackmailing art-dealer had
unquestionably been put out at the mention of the cellar. His tone
of voice and the fact that the girl had asked him whether anything
was worrying him, was sufficient proof of that. Was it possible
that the unfortunate poker-playing thug was a friend, not of the
Duke, but of Mr. Tollemache? That was perfectly possible. In which
case the blackmailer was a more formidable factor than he had
allowed for. He had regarded him hitherto as a man playing a lone
hand, and playing it quietly and without violence. But if the thug
below-stairs was in his troupe, then he would have to be added to
the already sufficiently numerous throng of potential gunmen.
Another question that was less important, although undeniably
interesting, was how he had hit upon the solution of the samplers?
Of course he might be bluffing; he might know nothing whatsoever
about the solution. That was a point which would probably be
settled later.</p>

<p>Mr. Tollemache continued in his soft, ingratiating voice:</p>

<p>"I don't believe you understand me one little bit, my dear young
lady. I don't think you like me very much, and I'm sure you don't
trust me."</p>

<p>"I see no reason," was the cool reply, "why I should either
trust or distrust you. I don't know you very well, after all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will allow me to explain," he went on, "exactly
what my position is. I have three duties."</p>

<p>His explanation of his position and his triple obligations was
rudely interrupted by the arrival, headlong and breathless, of one
of the footmen from the upper parts of the house. He was dressed in
shirt, socks, and trousers and he was extremely agitated and
excited, exclaiming repeatedly, "My lord, my lord, my lord!" In the
twinkling of an eye, Lord Claydon, Ilford, the butler, and Lady
Caroline (in a fearful and wonderful dressing-gown of purple satin,
and a lace cap), appeared on the first floor. The first three ran
downstairs; Lady Caroline stayed above.</p>

<p>"My lord, my lord!" reiterated the footman. "A window at the end
of the wing. I saw you and Harding shut it, my lord, and bolt the
shutters&mdash;and now it's open, wide open!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried Ilford, racing up the stairs three steps at a
time. "Which way? Which way?" He came back in a moment or two.
"Yes," he said briefly. "It's open, and there's a rope-ladder
hanging from the sill."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then Lord Claydon said
heavily:</p>

<p>"That means the Duke is inside the house."</p>

<h2 id='ch16'>XVI<br>
KERRIGAN <i>CONTRA MUNDUM</i></h2>

<p>"Personally," said Mr. Tollemache quietly after a moment, "I am
rather sceptical about the existence of that gentleman. I think you
will find, my dear Claydon, that one of your admirable staff of
domestics is conducting a harmless little flirtation in your
conveniently adjacent, and if I may say so, conveniently
sequestered woods."</p>

<p>"Where's Gerald and his servant fellow?" cried Lord Claydon,
paying no attention to him. "Why didn't they hear the alarm?"</p>

<p>Lady Pamela, who had joined Lady Caroline on the first floor,
answered both questions with a cold off-handedness.</p>

<p>"They're patrolling the house. Just because they aren't in
hysterics in the lounge it doesn't mean that they didn't hear the
alarm."</p>

<p>Lord Claydon was immensely relieved.</p>

<p>"Of course," he exclaimed. "I'd forgotten that they are on
guard. Nothing can happen while they're on guard. Let's all go back
to bed. Come on, George. Rosemary, Tollemache!"</p>

<p>He led the way upstairs. Only the agitated footman followed him.
Sir George Ilford said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Rosemary, where exactly is Gerald?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"He must be told about this business at once."</p>

<p>"How are you going to tell him if you can't find him?"</p>

<p>This baffled Sir George, and he stared helplessly round.
Rosemary went across and laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Look here, George," she said. "Gerald has got the whole thing
in hand. Why worry? He and Esteban are a match for about half a
dozen men at any time. And here they've got the advantage of
knowing the ground and being ready beforehand. You can leave
everything to them. Run away to bed. Good-night. Good-night, Mr.
Tollemache."</p>

<p>Ilford looked at her doubtfully and said:</p>

<p>"I suppose you know more about Gerald's plans than I do."</p>

<p>"Of course she does," interrupted Lady Pamela. "And so do I. Why
can't you leave well alone?"</p>

<p>"I can't see where the 'well' comes in, if that fellow has got
into the house through that open window."</p>

<p>"Can't you understand that 'that fellow' as you call him, isn't
expecting to meet people like Gerald and Esteban, whereas they are
expecting to meet him?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Ilford. "If you're so cocksure, you can go
ahead with it. I'm not going to butt in, because I haven't got a
gun, and I doubt if I would if I had."</p>

<p>He went upstairs again to his room. Lady Pamela leaned on the
balustrade. Lady Caroline had already taken herself and her purple
dressing-gown off.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mr. Tollemache," said Rosemary, holding out her
hand.</p>

<p>"I have, as I was saying," said Mr. Tollemache, sitting down,
"three duties. One to myself, which impels me to make as much money
and collect as many pictures as I can; secondly, towards Lord
Claydon, who did me a very good turn years ago when I was very
nearly down and out; and thirdly, towards Art. Now, as a general
rule, my dear young lady, I am bound to confess that I look after
my own interests first. It is only natural. But here is a case in
which my own interests are diametrically opposed to those of Lord
Claydon and of Art. For if this famous Treasure is discovered, Lord
Claydon will not need to sell me his collection of Old Masters, and
I shall lose the chance of a lifetime. So the discovery of the
Treasure will help Lord Claydon but not me. Furthermore, if the
Treasure proves to be lost Leonardos or Ver Meers, the immortal
cause of Art will be vastly benefited. It is two to one, dear young
lady, and I surrender. I want to help you to find the Treasure. I
am on your side!"</p>

<p>Kerrigan smiled broadly.</p>

<p>"You old liar!" he said to himself.</p>

<p>Rosemary replied at once:</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. I know we are all very grateful to you,
Mr. Tollemache. You really want to help?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed."</p>

<p>"And so you can. By going off to bed now."</p>

<p>Mr. Tollemache lowered his voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>"I can help you in another way as well. Can you get hold of that
queer-looking Spaniard?"</p>

<p>"Esteban?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Get hold of him and tell him to watch George Ilford's
window."</p>

<p>Rosemary lowered her voice: "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because Ilford knows where the Treasure is. And there's no one
here who can tackle him except Esteban."</p>

<p>"That's true," she murmured. "But are you sure about
Ilford?"</p>

<p>"I heard him say to Lord Claydon this evening&mdash;just a
half-sentence&mdash;a word or two&mdash;but it was enough. 'Take it
to Christie's to-morrow,' was what I heard. Isn't that enough?
There's nothing else in the house that he could take to be sold at
Christie's. I've got an option on all the valuable stuff. Don't you
think that that's conclusive?"</p>

<p>Rosemary looked up at Lady Pamela who had been listening
intently from the first floor.</p>

<p>"What about it, Pam?" she said.</p>

<p>"I don't trust George Ilford a foot," replied that lady.</p>

<p>"Shall we warn Gerald?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't do any harm."</p>

<p>"It isn't Gerald you ought to warn," interposed Mr. Tollemache.
"It's his servant. Ilford's a man of enormous strength. It will
need the servant to tackle him."</p>

<p>"Shall I go and tell him, Rosemary?"</p>

<p>"I think so, Pam. It won't do any harm."</p>

<p>"All right. By the way, where's the insurance tout?"</p>

<p>"Drunk in the cellar."</p>

<p>"Good." Lady Pamela ran off down the passage.</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Tollemache, your second piece of assistance," said
Rosemary coaxingly. "Run along to bed, and leave everything to
us."</p>

<p>"You're sure there's nothing more I can do? I am no fighting
man, but I have a certain amount of low cunning which is at your
disposal." He laughed a gentle, throaty laugh. "How would it be if
you retired for the night and left the field to me instead?"</p>

<p>Rosemary laughed also.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, Mr. Tollemache, I'm afraid. We're in earnest,
you know."</p>

<p>"Ah! But so am I. What's that?" he added sharply.</p>

<p>Kerrigan could not see what it was, but Rosemary's next words
enlightened him.</p>

<p>"It's only Esteban, on all fours, changing ground."</p>

<p>Kerrigan was full of admiration for the girl's light-hearted
fearlessness. She might be taking part in a game of hide-and-seek
for all the fuss she made, instead of being involved in a game of
manoeuvre and counter-manoeuvre with cut-throats and murderers, for
a colossal stake.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Tollemache. "In that case, I fancy the game is
due to begin."</p>

<p>There was a subtle change in his voice. It seemed fresher and
younger. Rosemary apparently noticed nothing different about it,
for she replied with her usual, off-hand lightness:</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought it had begun ages ago."</p>

<p>"My game is only beginning now," replied Mr. Tollemache. "Do you
see this neat little bottle, my dear young lady? It contains
vitriol."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then he continued:</p>

<p>"I have found in a long course of experience that it is no
earthly use threatening high-spirited young ladies with pistols.
They just sneer at them. But vitriol is different. I never yet met
a young lady, however spirited, who sneered at vitriol. It does
leave such horrid marks."</p>

<p>Kerrigan could hear the girl's breath coming quickly, but she
spoke with complete composure when she said:</p>

<p>"And which side are you on now, Mr. Tollemache?"</p>

<p>"On my own, now that Master Esteban has been cleared out of his
room, thanks to you, dear young lady. And now perhaps you will
kindly step this way. I think you might as well join your drunken
young friend in the cellar. It will keep you out of mischief. No
tricks now, or your exquisite appearance will become a good deal
less exquisite in the immediate future."</p>

<p>Rosemary did exactly what Kerrigan would have done in the same
circumstances. She neither swore nor protested nor implored. She
went in front of Mr. Tollemache towards the cellar without a
word.</p>

<p>"Good girl!" murmured the art-valuer with a chuckle. "Good,
obedient girl!"</p>

<p>Kerrigan peeped round the sofa and watched them disappear round
the corner of the passage. Tollemache's new and militant activity
introduced an additional factor of some slight importance. It meant
an extra amount of vigilance. Another new factor was Tollemache's
anxiety to get Esteban away from his room. Kerrigan was just
wondering what that meant when he got a nasty shock. His eyes
happened to light upon an evening paper which was lying among the
heap that Rosemary had deposited on the floor beside the sofa, and
he read, mechanically, a paragraph in the stop-press news which ran
as follows:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Clapham Common Murder.<br>
<br>
"The body of the man found buried on Clapham Common this morning
has been identified as that of a Mr. William Morganson Tollemache,
a well-known art-dealer, valuer, and private collector."</p>

<p>He read it twice before the full implication of it sprang up and
hit him between the eyes, and then a whole lot of things explained
themselves in a flash which had been inexplicable before. The chief
and main and overwhelming implication was that the gentleman who
had been masquerading at Marsh Manor for weeks and weeks as Mr.
Tollemache, who was at that moment strolling towards the cellar
door with Miss Shackleford, vitriol bottle in hand, was the Duke
himself. The position was now enormously complicated. It was not
simply that the famous killer was in the very midst of the
defences; that was what Kerrigan had reckoned would happen. He was
ready for that emergency. But the famous killer was not a stranger
fighting upon strange ground. He had been in the place for weeks,
planning, spying, plotting, calculating, until he knew the place
probably better than any one else; certainly far better than
Kerrigan did. It was the latter now who was fighting on strange
ground against an adversary who knew every inch of it. Nor was that
all.</p>

<p>Kerrigan during the last few days had kept Tollemache and the
Duke in separate water-tight compartments. Such-and-such a thing
had been known to one and not to the other and <i>vice versa</i>,
and plans of action, calculations of possibilities and estimates of
probabilities had been based upon this separation into
compartments. But now that the two personalities had suddenly been
rolled into one, everything was changed with painful abruptness,
and Kerrigan had precious little time in which to reorientate his
ideas.</p>

<p>The first and most pressing eventuality to be guarded against
was that the Duke might take advantage of his visit to the cellar
to have a word with the mummified bandit who was now certain to be
one of his colleagues. If he did, he would very quickly realise
that Kerrigan was at large in the house, was a formidable opponent,
and armed with the bandit's pistol. If, on the other hand, he did
not speak to his colleague but simply pushed the girl in, then it
would not be long before she found her way out into the washhouse
and thence into the garden.</p>

<p>Another possibility that might materialise at any
moment&mdash;indeed, Kerrigan was rather surprised that it had not
done so already&mdash;was the arrival of the police. It would not
take long for Fleming to connect the body on Clapham Common with
the gentleman who had been staying at Marsh Manor. Kerrigan could
not help wishing that Fleming would waste as little time as
possible in putting in an appearance. In the meantime, there was
nothing to be done but to wait and watch. In less than a minute Mr.
Tollemache came back slowly, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
Kerrigan shifted the pistol in his coat-pocket to a more convenient
angle and waited. He did not dare to look round the corner of the
sofa again, but he could hear the other man's breathing. A moment
later he heard the breathing recede, and then a creak on the stair.
He flashed a quick look round the sofa, saw Mr. Tollemache go
slowly upstairs, and turn down the corridor which led to the region
of Esteban's room and the window which had been opened and
rope-laddered.</p>

<p>Kerrigan slipped off his shoes and ran noiselessly after him. At
the corner of the passage he lay down and peered round an inch or
two from the floor. The Duke had opened the window again and was
picking up the rope-ladder, which had been left on the floor beside
the window, and was fixing it again to the window-sill. Then he
pulled out a key, unlocked the door of Esteban's room and went in,
locking it behind him.</p>

<p>Kerrigan tiptoed down the passage and listened at the keyhole.
There was a cracking sound, as if some one was snapping thin bits
of wood across his knee, several times repeated. Then there was a
pause and the sound of a heavy bit of furniture being moved. The
Duke was obviously hot on the trail. He knew where to look and he
was looking. At any moment he might find the Treasure or the second
clue, and then he would come out again and the shooting would
begin.</p>

<p>Kerrigan decided that face-to-face shooting in a corridor would
be no joke, and that an ambush would give him a better chance. He
looked round hastily. There was no possibility of ambushing even a
mouse in the corridor, which was lamentably deficient in alcoves,
dark corners, or protective curves. A brain-wave struck him. The
obvious place was in the darkness at the foot of the rope-ladder.
It would be a perfect place of concealment, and the Duke, in the
comparative elation at having got out of the house, might be more
off his guard and easier to surprise. Kerrigan darted across to the
window and was just throwing his leg over the sill when he saw the
squat, frog-like figure of Esteban coming up the ladder a yard or
two below him. The figure of Rosemary Shackleford was faintly
discernible on the ground at the foot. But Peter Kerrigan was less
concerned with her figure at that moment than with the long knife
which Esteban was carrying in his mouth.</p>

<p>He withdrew his head with lightning celerity, and darted down
the passage again. Just as he rounded the corner he heard the first
attempt of Esteban upon the handle of his bedroom door.</p>

<p>Assuming that the Colombian knife-expert could be trusted to
perform the traditional rle of the bull-dog and remain on guard at
the bedroom door, Kerrigan was safe to dash round the outside of
the house and cut off the Duke's retreat <i>via</i> the bedroom
window. That the Duke had a retreat <i>via</i> the bedroom window,
Kerrigan did not doubt for an instant. Probably he had half a dozen
different lines of retreat, but the obvious thing was to cover the
bedroom window. Kerrigan had to chance the Colombian's movements,
and he rushed downstairs. At the foot of the stairs he was seized
with a happy inspiration, and he ran up again and, halting at the
corner so that he was invisible from the end of the passage,
whispered with a penetrating hoarseness in his best South American
Spanish, "Guard that door, Esteban. Whatever you do, guard that
door!"</p>

<p>"That ought to fix Tarzan," he thought, as the answering whisper
of "<i>Sa, senor, senor,</i>" came down the passage, and he was
free to concentrate upon getting out.</p>

<p>To get out of the house quickly was not so easy a task as it
sounded. Every door and window was bolted and barred, and it was a
question of choosing the one which would most readily yield to
Peter's bunch of skeleton keys and twisted wires. He decided on the
back door, and dived through the green baize and started to work.
It took him about four minutes to get out, longer than he had
anticipated, but there were two separate locks to be
negotiated.</p>

<p>Once outside he vanished into a shrubbery and worked his way
along the house until he was opposite the room of the first floor
which he judged to be Esteban's. There was a light burning in it;
occasionally a shadow appeared on the wall; and the window was
open. The Duke was evidently still at work.</p>

<p>"What a magnificently cool fellow!" thought Kerrigan enviously.
"Wanted for murder a dozen times over; knows that he's surrounded
by chaps after him; must hear old Mowgli scrabbling at the door,
and yet he works away, cool as be damned, as if he owned the earth.
Wish I was like that!"</p>

<p>He settled down on hands and knees behind a row of sweet-peas in
a flower-bed, and glanced along the house towards the tall outline
of the library. Presumably Streatfield was wasting his time on
guard there, or doing something equally futile and footling. Then
he suddenly remembered the figure of Rosemary Shackleford on the
grass at the foot of the rope-ladder. Damn it! what a fool he had
been not to lock the door of the washhouse. But then he couldn't
have known at the time how important it would be not to let that
infernal girl realise the whole situation. She knew as much as any
one now&mdash;except, perhaps, that Tollemache was the Duke, and
she would probably guess that with some blasted feminine intuition.
She hadn't wasted a moment in fetching up her troops once she got
out of the cellar; she was like Napoleon&mdash;put her fingers on
the hub of the thing at once and got hold of Tarzan and slung him
into the fray to blockade the bedroom door. Her next
move&mdash;Peter Kerrigan jumped as if he had been stung&mdash;her
next move, of course, would be to get hold of Streatfield and sling
him into the fray to blockade the bedroom window. He would be here
at any minute with his arsenal of firearms, and a border of
sweet-peas, however decorative, cannot by any stretch of the
imagination be called bullet-proof.</p>

<p>His guess was correct. A moment or two later there was a
crackling of pine-needles away to his left, followed by a stealthy
rustling, and then Streatfield's crouching figure appeared a few
yards away, taking post behind a tree.</p>

<p>"The Duke," thought Kerrigan, "is in rather a tight place."</p>

<p>The tightness of his place lay, of course, in his ignorance of
Rosemary's easy exit from the cellar, and in the consequent swift
mobilisation of her allies. On the other hand, he was a gentleman
of undeniable quickness and resource. He had about an even chance,
thought Kerrigan.</p>

<p>The next instant the light went out in Esteban's room. The Duke
had found what he was looking for. The Grand Retreat was about to
begin. It began in complete silence. There was not a sound for
perhaps five minutes. It was impossible to see from the ground
anything that was happening inside that darkened room and Kerrigan
concentrated his watchfulness upon a patch of light below the dark
window that was cast by illuminations elsewhere in the house. Any
one sliding down a ladder, or letting down a ladder to slide down,
would be bound to attract attention in this zone of reflected light
upon the wall.</p>

<p>Suddenly a heavy mass, looking very like the body of a man, fell
across the zone of light to the ground, and Streatfield
straightened himself and opened fire. The dark mass lay very still
in the shadow at the foot of the wall. A terrific banging and
thumping from inside the house seemed to indicate that Esteban had
launched his assault major upon the bedroom door. A minute more and
the whole house would be up and abroad. Another heavy mass fell
from the darkened window, and again Streatfield fired at it as it
reached the ground, and again it lay very still at the bottom of
the wall.</p>

<p>Kerrigan shot a sidelong look at Streatfield and saw that he was
feverishly putting a new clip of cartridges into his automatic; he
was far too excited to be on the alert for anything except the
targets which had descended or were likely to descend from that
window. Kerrigan got up as silently as he could and moved away from
him. He had no desire to be anywhere near the man who was
advertising himself as the possessor of firearms and an inclination
to use them. It was a good move, for, hardly had he slipped away a
dozen yards when there was a terrific flash and an ear-splitting
explosion, about ten feet in front of Streatfield's tree. The
Duke's bomb-throwing practice was good for direction, but not quite
good enough for strength. The deafening clap of the explosion was
followed by a simultaneous burst of excitement and indignation from
every bird within a mile of the Manor, the cawing of rooks vastly
predominating as they rose and wheeled and flapped in their
hundreds above the woods.</p>

<p>But Kerrigan did not object to the noise nor, after he had made
certain that he was not hit, to the bits of flying metal which
hurtled over his head in all directions. It was the three or four
seconds of absolute darkness after the flash that he objected to.
For it was obviously in those three or four seconds that the
American gunman was going to make the first move of his retreat.
The only thing to do, therefore, was to advance at once towards the
wall below the window and trust to the blinding darkness
evaporating before he reached it. Pistol in hand, therefore, and
crouching as low as possible, he made straight for the house,
tripped over a strand of wire that was assisting some plant or
other to reach its full development, and fell flat on his face. He
got up in time to see a dark figure running with incredible agility
round the house in the direction of the hidden motor-bicycle.</p>

<p>"That'll worry him," thought Peter, as he jumped to his feet.
"He'll be expecting his pal to have got it started for him."</p>

<p>The next moment he flung himself down again, for a bullet from
behind had taken off the tip of his left ear. The bomb had not
accounted for Streatfield, apparently. This view was confirmed by
the sound of that gentleman's voice roaring out, "Esteban, Esteban,
<i>venga, venga!</i>"</p>

<p>A crash and a splintering of woodwork from the bedroom above was
evidence of the Colombian's success at last in breaking down the
door; the lights were switched on, and the next moment the
Colombian jumped out of the window on to the pile at the foot of
the wall, which was now revealed to be mattresses and pillows.</p>

<p>"Here he is, here he is!" shouted Streatfield, forgetting his
Spanish in the excitement of the moment, and blazing away into the
trees above Kerrigan's prostrate body.</p>

<p>"Tut-tut!" thought that individual, as the bullets crashed into
the undergrowth or glanced off tree-trunks, "this is a trifle warm.
Blast the fellow!" He whipped out of his pocket the electric torch
with the long, expandable arm which he had found in the library on
the occasion of Rubin's murder, extended the arm to its maximum
length into the flower-beds, switched it on, jumped up, and ran for
his life towards a clump of trees. Streatfield extinguished the
light in four seconds, and Peter reached the trees in three and a
half. But the Colombian had not seen the electric-light and he had
seen the flying figure, and he set off in pursuit with huge,
bounding strides like a gorilla. He seemed to be a man who despised
new-fangled weapons such as gunpowder and Colt revolvers, for in
his hand he carried his favourite long, shiny knife.</p>

<p>Kerrigan, who had halted for a moment under cover of a massive
beech tree to take stock of the situation, saw him coming, a
fearsome, primeval spectacle. But the only tactical problem which
his dervish-like onslaught presented, was how to shoot him without
drawing Streatfield's fire again. At all costs he must keep the
beech tree between himself and where he imagined Streatfield to be.
Fortunately, the oncoming gorilla saw him and swerved a little in
order to get at him round the tree trunk, so that Kerrigan did not
have to move. He waited till the man was a dozen yards away and
aimed at his great, barrel-like chest, then changed his mind and
decided only to bring him down with a shot in the leg. After all,
he did not want to do the poor faithful devil a serious injury, let
alone be run in before an English jury on a homicide charge. He
pulled the trigger and the pistol jammed.</p>

<p>"That comes of trusting cheap American goods," he said aloud, as
he flung the pistol at the Colombian. It hit him fair and square
upon the top of the head and bounced off as if it had been a
ping-pong ball. Esteban shook his head as a man shakes off a
troublesome mosquito and did not slacken speed. Only he lifted his
shoulders a little so that he could see his quarry more clearly.
Esteban apparently mingled a faint glimmer of common sense with his
berserker folly.</p>

<p>There were two courses open to Kerrigan. He could either attempt
to draw one of his two useful little pieces of gas-piping and join
in a hand-to-hand rough-and-tumble with the Colombian, trusting to
be able to finish him off in a second or two and get away before
the arrival, pistol in hand, of Streatfield, or else he could turn
and make a bolt for it. It took him the barest fraction of a second
to make up his mind, and then he turned and bolted in the direction
the Duke had gone.</p>

<p>There were several advantages in taking this direction. Firstly,
it kept the beech tree for a second or two longer between himself
and Streatfield's line of advance; secondly, it made a clash
between his two sets of opponents a distinct possibility; and
thirdly, it kept him upon the main objective, the recovery of
whatever it was that the Duke had removed from Esteban's bedroom.
The main disadvantage was that it placed him, practically unarmed,
between two heavily-armed and hostile forces.</p>

<p>The race was conducted at a whirlwind speed as far as the corner
of the house, with Kerrigan just maintaining his lead. On the other
side of the corner he dived down between two yew hedges that led
away from the direction of the washhouse, and as there was a choice
of three paths, and the hedges cast a deep shadow across all of
them, he gained perhaps one second, or eight or nine yards, on the
pursuer who hesitated before choosing the right path. Another
second was gained in the rose-garden, and it was with a lead of
about twenty-five yards that he raced back and made a detour for
the washhouse. He had heard the sound of a motor-bicycle suddenly
spring into life from that direction, and he realised that it was a
case of now or never. He had not the faintest idea of what he was
going to do when he reached the motor-bicycle, beyond a vague,
general strategic notion that his one chance now lay in embroiling
the Duke and the Streatfield-Esteban combination.</p>

<p>By this time windows were open, maids were screaming, lights
were blazing, Ilford's voice could be heard roaring something in
the distance, and Kerrigan, as he braced himself for a final sprint
across a now brightly-illuminated lawn, could see at least one
female figure hanging out of a first floor window, gesticulating
wildly and apparently screaming. He could also see on his left
front, between himself and the house, and racing along to cut him
off, the figure of Streatfield with a pistol in each hand. While
Esteban had followed him on the detour into the garden, Streatfield
had cut off the corners by hugging the wall of the house. The only
consolation in an otherwise extremely unconsoling situation was
that Streatfield was running straight towards the hidden but now
noisy motor-bicycle. Kerrigan glanced over his shoulder. The human
gorilla had just bounded clear of the rose-garden and was on the
edge of the lawn. The lights of the house shone bravely upon his
gleaming knife.</p>

<p>Again Kerrigan had an awkward choice to make, and he postponed
it for a second or two by turning right-handed a little so that he
was running almost parallel with the house. This at least would
bring Streatfield nearer the motor-bicycle. Kerrigan found time to
curse the Duke for being so slow to emerge; but, presumably, he was
watching the runners and awaiting developments. The female who was
leaning out of the window screamed hoarsely and shrilly at
Streatfield as he ran past beneath her, and then suddenly levelled
a gun to her shoulder and fired straight at Kerrigan. He ducked and
swore and simultaneously heard an infuriated bellow behind him. A
pattering sound upon the rose-bushes like rain, told him that the
gun had been a shot-gun; and the sight of Esteban, rolling about on
the lawn and howling, told him that not all the pellets had been
wasted upon inoffensive plants; and the shrill voice screaming,
"Out of the way, Peter!" told him that the providential shooter was
Lady Caroline.</p>

<p>The same instant the sound of the motor-bicycle stopped, and an
American voice shouted angrily: "Heine, where in hell are you?
We've got to quit!" Kerrigan skipped nimbly out of the line of
fire, and the old lady blazed off another salvo of small shot at
the unfortunate Colombian. This time her aim was not so true, and
the patter on the rose-bushes only had the effect of galvanising
Esteban into activity. With a volley of imprecations he sprang up
and hobbled out of sight. Streatfield had also vanished. The scene
of action seemed to have been transferred once more into the
interior of the house.</p>

<p>So far almost everything had gone as far wrong as it was
possible for it to go. Kerrigan had placed himself, armed, across
the Duke's line of retreat, only to see the blundering Streatfield
drive him off it again; he no longer had a pistol; the whole
campaign had shifted on to ground that the American knew from A to
Z; while the only item upon the asset side was the partial
disablement of the amiable Colombian. And then another important
item on the debit side struck him forcibly.</p>

<p>Once the American got into the cellar, he would presumably be
able to find time to release his colleague, the poker-playing
bandit. A few cuts with a knife&mdash;it was a matter of a second
or two. Together they would form a real Strong-Arm Squad and would
probably abandon guile and strategy and simply shoot themselves
out, in good old-fashioned Chicago style. They might just as well
be hanged for sheep as lambs&mdash;a proverb of which they were
probably well aware. The only question was, by which exit would
they shoot themselves out?</p>

<p>Lady Caroline was calling urgently to him in a whisper, and
Kerrigan ran quickly across to her.</p>

<p>"Here you are," she whispered eagerly, handing down her
shot-gun, "and here are some cartridges. It was the best I could
do. The farmers round here don't seem to keep rifles or
revolvers."</p>

<p>"Well done, Lady C.!" he cried enthusiastically, seizing the
gun, stuffing in a couple of cartridges and pocketing the rest.
"Keep your door locked, and your head down. See you later!" and he
ran stealthily to the entrance of the washhouse and peered in.</p>

<p>The American's movements, as usual, had been astonishingly swift
and effective. From the time when he had called out, urging his
assistant to disclose his whereabouts, to the moment of
Streatfield's arrival outside the washhouse, hardly a couple of
seconds could have passed. And yet he had rushed into the
washhouse, slammed the door in Streatfield's face, entered the
cellar, and released his tied-up friend Heine before the few
seconds of Streatfield's natural hesitation outside the door of the
washhouse had elapsed.</p>

<p>When Kerrigan peered into the washhouse, all he could see was
Streatfield kneeling at the side of the door into the narrow
passage trying to see what was happening in the cellar. He did not
have to wait long. A tempest of explosions and flashes lit up the
darkness and Streatfield, apparently unhurt, shrank back very
naturally into a corner, while the bullets thudded and ricochetted
and bounced on the walls of the washhouse. One hit the ceiling just
above Kerrigan's head and brought down a handful of plaster and
cement. The appalling clatter stopped as abruptly as it had begun,
and the dead silence that followed was only broken by a faint clang
which Kerrigan at once recognised as the shutting of the iron door
at the top of the cellar stairs. The American contingent had
carried their retreat right into the house.</p>

<p>Peter left his observation post at the door of the washhouse and
ran towards the back door, but, passing on his way the rope-ladder
which was still dangling from the window where the pseudo Mr.
Tollemache had hung it, he changed his mind, seized it, and went up
like a lamplighter. But, unlike Esteban, he went up it with his
eyes on the window above him instead of on the ground, and just
before he reached the top a thick cudgel came over the window-sill,
followed by the glorious mass of hair that crowned Miss
Shackleford's head, and a peremptory, "Stop!"</p>

<p>"Stop be damned!" said Kerrigan, hauling up hand over hand.</p>

<p>"You be damned," retorted the girl, aiming a vicious blow at his
head which he only just succeeded in dodging. It hit him on the
shoulder instead and hurt excessively.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, tut!" he said in some annoyance, pushing her aside
firmly, as she hit him another swinger on the elbow, and jumping
down into the corridor. "You are the silliest girl I've ever met in
my life. You've got as much sense as a hen!" Then, tucking his
shot-gun under his arm, he sprinted down the corridor in the
direction of the main staircase, pausing at the end to add over his
shoulder, "And, as every one knows, a hen is all beak," and then he
ran down the staircase.</p>

<p>Half-way down he stopped abruptly. Standing on the hearth-rug in
the lounge hall below him was a young man with a pink, chubby face.
In his left hand he was holding a grey wig, a grey moustache, and a
pair of grey side-whiskers, and in his right a large automatic
pistol. He was looking up at Kerrigan with mild interest. The first
thing that the latter saw about him was that he was not even out of
breath. His hand was as steady as a rock, his movements of hand and
eye quiet and deliberate.</p>

<p>"Oh boy!" said the young man, "I don't wish you any harm. Drop
your cannon." Kerrigan dropped his shot-gun on to the stairs with a
clatter. "You'd much best get back to your insurance touting," went
on the Anglo-American, glancing casually up to where a confused
murmuring, sobbing, and an occasional wail betokened the alarmed
condition of the household. "Strong-arm stuff isn't in your line.
Take my advice and you'll keep out of these blood-and-thunder
entertainments. You aren't cut out for them, laddie. You aren't,
really. Now, that Streatfield fellow, he's different. He's a tough
egg and no mistake. Any man who can slug my Heine under the jaw and
tie him into knots is a tough egg and I wouldn't waste any more
time on him than it takes to pull a trigger. But you're a decent
little softie. Run away, boy; run away." He threw a glance, again a
casual, negligent glance, at the front door, which was standing
ajar.</p>

<p>Kerrigan succeeded in producing a woeful stammer as he said:</p>

<p>"But I don't know where to run to. It's all so dangerous
everywhere."</p>

<p>The American smiled, and it was a smile of genuine
amusement.</p>

<p>"As you say, boy, it is all so dangerous everywhere."</p>

<p>Sir George Ilford's dark head appeared over the landing on the
first floor for a moment. The American appeared to be looking
straight at Kerrigan, but he jerked his wrist with an incredibly
swift upward motion and a shot hit the ceiling above the baronet's
head.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurt him either," explained the ex-art-valuer,
"just to frighten him."</p>

<p>He had succeeded in his object, for the head withdrew with
considerable rapidity. The next moment there was a gentle
scrunching of wheels on the gravel outside and then Heine, the
poker-playing thug, poked his head in at the front door and
observed:</p>

<p>"Got it, chief."</p>

<p>"Where's Streatfield?"</p>

<p>"Didn't see him. In the cellar, I guess."</p>

<p>"Oh! Just wait till I switch off the lights. It'll make it
easier for us getting away."</p>

<p>The Duke went across to the baize door with lithe, pantherine
steps and disappeared. Kerrigan had taken advantage of this brief
conversation to edge down half a dozen steps and, when Heine, fully
equipped for motoring in black peaked cap and goggles, swung the
door open and came into the hall, he was completely covered from
the thug by the door. The Duke had no monopoly of quick, silent
moving, and Heine only saw over his shoulder the last few feet of
Kerrigan's attack. The knuckle-dusters caught him on the back of
the head and he went down like a stone. Peter had just stuffed the
body behind a sofa, got into the big black coat and peaked cap and
was adjusting the goggles, when the air was rent by a tumult of
bells, topped by the deep note of the main fire-alarm bell of the
Manor. The next instant there was a tempestuous rush of arms, legs,
and hairy face through the door, as Esteban, despite his pelleted
leg, hurtled through and flung himself upon the figure in the black
oilskins. They went to the ground in a heap and rolled over and
over and over, Kerrigan gripping the Colombian's knife-wrist like
grim death and the other struggling frantically to get it free. The
Colombian was immensely more powerful and heavy than Kerrigan, but
the latter's wrists were famous in the underworlds of a good many
countries, and the long knife remained out of action until two
deafening explosions and a loud click sounded as if they had been
let off inside Kerrigan's ear-drums. Esteban gave a sigh and went
suddenly limp, and then his head fell back with a thud. Kerrigan
paused for a moment to pull the peaked cap down over his eyes and
adjust his goggles before he jumped up.</p>

<p>The Duke was looking down at the Colombian.</p>

<p>"Have two shots done it?" he asked tranquilly. His iron coolness
appeared to be quite unshakable. "I would have given him a third
but my clip's finished. Come on, Heine&mdash;quick. There's
something wrong with these blamed lights."</p>

<p>The two men made for the door, colliding slightly in the
entrance, and ran down to the motor-bicycle.</p>

<p>"I'll drive," said the Duke, and Kerrigan sprang into the
side-car. As they swung down the avenue a couple of bullets hit the
fir trees in front of them and they could see the figure of
Streatfield standing outside the washhouse.</p>

<p>The Anglo-American chuckled as the powerful bicycle roared out
of the park gates on to the Aylesbury Road. Kerrigan lay back in
the side-car and wondered how long it would be before they were
stopped by a police patrol. After the murder that evening of John
Hone&mdash;good Heavens! it seemed a month ago&mdash;every road
would surely be patrolled, if not picketed and blockaded. There
wasn't the faintest chance of getting to Aylesbury without being
challenged, let alone London.</p>

<p>But apparently the Duke had no intention of going to Aylesbury,
for a short distance down the road he turned off to the right to
the little village of Ambrosden, and then again up a cart-track
just short of the village. At the end of the track there was a
gate, and he halted and switched off the lights.</p>

<p>"Here we are, my boy," he remarked gaily. "Three more minutes,
and then good-bye to all this." He vaulted nimbly over the gate,
and Kerrigan got out of the side-car and followed him across a
field to a large shed. The door was quickly swung back, a light
switched on, and an aeroplane revealed.</p>

<p>"Go to it, lad," said the Duke. Heine was clearly the
pilot-mechanic. Peter had never piloted an aeroplane in his life
and did not propose to begin now. He had no objection to flying as
a passenger; but as a pilot, no. The obvious moment had arrived for
slugging the Duke a quick one behind the ear, when suddenly the
other man seemed to have an inspiration that something was wrong.
Whether it was Kerrigan's momentary hesitation before he got to
business, or whether it was something unfamiliar about his build,
or whether the sudden light revealed a chin less unshaven than Mr.
Heine's azure jaw, at any rate he had a sudden flash of suspicion,
and he sprang back and whipped out his pistol.</p>

<p>"Stand still!" he exclaimed in a low whisper; "don't move. Who
the hell are you?" Kerrigan took off his hat and goggles. The
Anglo-American stared at him. "What the blazes are you doing here?"
he inquired after a pause.</p>

<p>"Heine was taken ill at the last moment," replied Kerrigan
blandly, "and he asked me to deputise for him."</p>

<p>The Duke peered attentively at him and then remarked, with all
his usual tranquillity:</p>

<p>"I don't understand it. And I'm afraid I haven't time to go into
it now, which is a pity. The only possible assumption is that
you're not the boob I took you for, and that seems incredible."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Kerrigan bowed.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," replied the other, picking up a length of rope, "I
haven't time to go into that now. Turn round and put your hands
behind your back. As I said before, I don't want to do you any
harm."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can," replied Peter. "You see, your gun
isn't loaded," and with that he hurled himself at the Duke, and for
the second time within a quarter of an hour found himself engaged
in a wrestling match. This time, also, it was an even match. Both
men were wiry and immensely strong, and both appeared to know every
trick, legitimate and illegitimate, of a public-house brawl or
street-fight. After three minutes of desperate encounter they broke
away and sprang to their feet, and the Anglo-American backed into a
corner and emerged the next instant with a pair of knuckle-dusters
on his hands. Kerrigan had slipped his off after felling Heine at
the door of the Manor, and now, instead of hastily putting them on
again, he held up his hand and said:</p>

<p>"Stop. I give in. I'm no boxer."</p>

<p>The Duke paused in his cat-like advance and said:</p>

<p>"Straight?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Look here, I can't stop you getting away, and I'm no match
for you. Why not just clear out and not worry about me? You're only
wasting time. Even if I ran all the way to Bicester and told the
police you'd be well away. They'll never catch you."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," said the Duke, "and time's getting
short."</p>

<p>"And I give you my word of honour that I won't tell the police
till to-morrow that you've gone in an aeroplane."</p>

<p>"Your word of honour be damned," replied the other, seizing the
aeroplane. "You give me a hand in running her out into the
field."</p>

<p>Five minutes later the last sound of the aeroplane's hum had
died away in the darkness, and Peter Kerrigan sat down on the floor
of the garage to examine the contents of the Anglo-American's
pockets which he had scientifically picked, one by one, during
their collision in the door of the Manor, their motor-bicycle
journey in the darkness, and during their rough-and-tumble
wrestling match.</p>

<h2 id='ch17'>XVII<br>
THE TREASURE</h2>

<p>It was after breakfast next morning before Kerrigan returned to
Marsh Manor and found the whole place a seething mass of reporters,
policemen, detectives, photographers, insurance-representatives
(genuine ones), and, outside a cordon of police, sightseers with a
very poor chance of seeing any sights.</p>

<p>Inspector Fleming took down the long depositions of every one
concerned, arrested Heine on a charge of being an accessory before
the fact in the murders of John Hone, Rubin, Mr. Tollemache, and
the Colombian, warned Kerrigan that he might be arrested later on
for the assault on Heine if that gentleman pressed the charge, and
announced that he would advise the Chief Constable of the County to
proceed against every one, including Lady Caroline, for being in
illegal possession of firearms.</p>

<p>After it was all over, Kerrigan at last was able to get hold of
Lady Caroline.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the old lady with some asperity. "So he got
away?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I got the clue. And it looks to me like another
cipher."</p>

<p>He handed her an envelope containing eleven sheets of yellow
paper, closely written up in a queer crabbed handwriting.</p>

<p>Lady Caroline examined them with great care through her
lorgnettes. At last she said slowly:</p>

<p>"I don't think this is in cipher. I'm going to London now. I
want you to come with me."</p>

<p>"But the clue?" expostulated Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," replied the old lady. "Go and get a
motor-car."</p>

<h2 id='ch18'>XVIII<br>
A MILLION POUNDS</h2>

<p>It was Heine who reluctantly cleared up a good many obscure
points. Heine had been the Duke's chauffeur, gunman, and general
mechanic for some years, and when the Duke got the commission from
a newspaper-magnate in America, whose past had not always been so
blameless as his present, to rid him of the blackmailing attentions
of Mr. Tollemache, art-valuer, art collector, and blackmailer, the
two men with their attendant circus of satellites, removed
themselves from Chicago to Europe to carry out the good work.</p>

<p>While in London, preparing to deal with the blackmailer, the
Duke was approached with another offer of employment&mdash;this
time by the agent of a Nebraska multi-millionaire whose conscience
allowed him to do anything he liked. This employment consisted of
extracting from a Mr. John Hone the secret of a million-pound
treasure about which he had spoken in certain discreet
art-collecting circles.</p>

<p>The Duke, who was a quick worker, undertook this second job, and
was agreeably surprised to find that the two overlapped. For after
abducting Mr. Tollemache one day from his house in Kensington, he
discovered that he was at that very moment starting to blackmail
Lord Claydon. Lord Claydon had, apparently, committed bigamy early
in life, and was unwilling to go to prison, to see his son by his
second wife disinherited, and to contemplate the prospect of his
entire estates and fortune going, after his death, to the next heir
who happened to be the half-caste son of a Jamaican cook. And it
was in Lord Claydon's house that this million-pound fortune lay. It
was almost too easy. Mr. Tollemache's profession made him naturally
a recluse into whose movements, appearances, and disappearances no
one ever liked to inquire if even they had been interested, and his
departure from the house at Kensington and rebirth at Marsh Manor
passed unnoticed and undiscussed.</p>

<p>The first complication had been the appearance of Mr. Rubin,
acting on behalf of a North Dakota multi-millionaire. But Mr. Rubin
was not in the same street as a thief and a murderer as the Duke,
and after he had, in a panic, killed the Duke's protg and
assistant, Newman, his fate was sealed.</p>

<p>Hone also had been kidnapped and had several times given, under
pressure, partial and sometimes definitely incorrect information
about the Treasure and the way to find it. In fact, the Duke's
assistants at the house in St. John's Wood had only just discovered
the whereabouts of the packet of yellow papers under the boards in
the bedroom which Hone had occupied at the Manor a few hours before
the ex-librarian made his successful dash for liberty, which ended
so fatally for him.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Duke got clear away. His aeroplane was found in a field near
Amsterdam, and a young man resembling him was seen boarding a train
for Antwerp, but he was not heard of again until his reappearance
on the north side in Chicago some months later.</p>

<p>Heine was hanged, and the remainder of the gang got long
sentences. Lady Pamela married Streatfield. Lord Claydon and Sir
George Ilford settled down to a quiet bachelor life at Marsh
Manor.</p>

<p>The eleven yellow be-scribbled leaves of paper were unanimously
declared by the experts to be part of Shakespeare's original
manuscript of <i>Hamlet</i>, beginning: "Look here, upon this
picture, and on this," down to "Lay not that flattering unction to
your soul," and were sold in New York for the equivalent in dollars
of one million two hundred and ten thousand pounds sterling. By
mutual agreement Peter Kerrigan received two hundred and fifty
thousand pounds, out of which he gave twenty thousand to the little
Gower Street lecturer whose walk in the Euston Road had started it
all.</p>

<p>The remainder, together with his hand and heart, he laid in a
rash moment at the elegant feet of Rosemary Shackleford.</p>

<p>She considered the offer for a minute or two and then smiled and
declined it. Peter was, on the whole, a little relieved, and they
remained the best of friends.</p>
