<h2>BOOK ONE</h2>

<h3><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter One</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Not very far from Up ton-on-Severn&mdash;between it, in fact,
and the Malvern Hills&mdash;stands the country seat of the Gordons
of Bramley; well-timbered, well-cottaged, well-fenced and
well-watered, having, in this latter respect, a stream that forks
in exactly the right position to feed two large lakes in the
grounds.</p>

<p>The house itself is of Georgian red brick, with charming
circular windows near the roof. It has dignity and pride without
ostentation, self-assurance without arrogance, repose without
inertia; and a gentle aloofness that, to those who know its spirit,
but adds to its value as a home. It is indeed like certain lovely
women who, now old, belong to a bygone generation&mdash;women who
in youth were passionate but seemly; difficult to win but when won,
all-fulfilling. They are passing away, but their homesteads remain,
and such an homestead is Morton.</p>

<p>To Morton Hall came the Lady Anna Gordon as a bride of just over
twenty. She was lovely as only an Irish woman can be, having that
in her bearing that betokened quiet pride, having that in her eyes
that betokened great longing, having that in her body that
betokened happy promise&mdash;the archetype of the very perfect
woman, whom creating God has found good. Sir Philip had met her
away in County Clare&mdash;Anna Molloy, the slim virgin thing, all
chastity, and his weariness had flown to her bosom as a spent bird
will fly to its nest&mdash;as indeed such a bird had once flown to
her, she told him, taking refuge from the perils of a storm.</p>

<p>Sir Philip was a tall man and exceedingly well-favoured, but his
charm lay less in feature than in a certain wide expression, a
tolerant expression that might almost be called noble, and in
something sad yet gallant in his deep-set hazel eyes. His chin,
which was firm, was very slightly cleft, his forehead intellectual,
his hair tinged with auburn. His wide-nostrilled nose was
indicative of temper, but his lips were well-modelled and sensitive
and ardent&mdash;they revealed him as a dreamer and a lover.</p>

<p>Twenty-nine when they had married, he had sown no few wild oats,
yet Anna's true instinct made her trust him completely: Her
guardian had disliked him, opposing the engagement, but in the end
she had had her own way. And as things turned out her choice had
been happy, for seldom had two people loved more than they did;
they loved with an ardour undiminished by time; as they ripened, so
their love ripened with them.</p>

<p>Sir Philip never knew how much he longed for a son until, some
ten years after marriage, his wife conceived a child; then he knew
that this thing meant complete fulfilment, the fulfilment for which
they had both been waiting. When she told him, he could not find
words for expression, and must just turn and weep on her shoulder.
It never seemed to cross his mind for a moment that Anna might very
well give him a daughter; he saw her only as a mother of sons, nor
could her warnings disturb him. He christened the unborn infant
Stephen, because he admired the pluck of that Saint. He was not a
religious man by instinct, being perhaps too much of a student, but
he read the Bible for its fine literature, and Stephen had gripped
his imagination. Thus he often discussed the future of their child:
'I think I shall put Stephen down for Harrow', or: 'I'd rather like
Stephen to finish off abroad, it widens one's outlook on life'.</p>

<p>And listening to him, Anna also grew convinced; his certainty
wore down her vague misgivings, and she saw herself playing with
this little Stephen, in the nursery, in the garden, in the
sweet-smelling meadows. 'And himself the lovely young man,' she
would say, thinking of the soft Irish speech of her peasants; 'And
himself with the light of the stars in his eyes, and the courage of
a lion in his heart!'</p>

<p>When the child stirred within her she would think it stirred
strongly because of the gallant male creature she was hiding; then
her spirit grew large with a mighty new courage, because a
man-child would be born. She would sit with her needle-work dropped
on her knees, while her eyes turned away to the long line of hills
that stretched beyond the Severn valley. From her favourite seat
underneath an old cedar, she would see these Malvern Hills in their
beauty, and their swelling slopes seemed to hold a new meaning.
They were like pregnant women, full-bosomed, courageous, great
green-girdled mothers of splendid sons! thus through all those
summer months she sat and watched the hills, and Sir Philip would
sit with her&mdash;they would sit hand in hand. And because she
felt grateful she gave much to the poor, and Sir Philip went to
church, which was seldom his custom, and the Vicar came to dinner,
and just towards the end many matrons called to give good advice to
Anna.</p>

<p>But: 'Man proposes&mdash;God disposes', and so it happened that
on Christmas Eve, Anna Gordon was delivered of a daughter; a
narrow-hipped, wide-shouldered little tadpole of a baby, that
yelled and yelled for three hours without ceasing, as though
outraged to find itself ejected into life.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Anna Gordon held her child to her breast, but she grieved while
it drank, because of her man who had longed so much for a son. And
seeing her grief, Sir Philip hid his chagrin, and he fondled the
baby and examined its fingers.</p>

<p>'What a hand!' he would say. 'Why it's actually got nails on all
its ten fingers: little, perfect, pink nails!'</p>

<p>Then Anna would dry her eyes and caress it, kissing the tiny
hand.</p>

<p>He insisted on calling the infant Stephen, nay more, he would
have it baptized by that name. 'We've called her Stephen so long,'
he told Anna, 'that I really can't see why we shouldn't go
on&mdash;'</p>

<p>Anna felt doubtful, but Sir Philip was stubborn, as he could be
at times over whims.</p>

<p>The Vicar said that it was rather unusual, so to mollify him
they must add female names. The child was baptized in the village
church as Stephen Mary Olivia Gertrude&mdash;and she throve,
seeming strong, and when her hair grew it was seen to be auburn
like Sir Philip's. There was also a tiny cleft in her chin, so
small just at first that it looked like a shadow; and after a while
when her eyes lost the blueness that is proper to puppies and other
young things, Anna saw that her eyes were going to be
hazel&mdash;and thought that their expression was her father's. On
the whole she was quite a well-behaved baby, owing, no doubt, to a
fine constitution. Beyond that first energetic protest at birth she
had done very little howling.</p>

<p>It was happy to have a baby at Morton, and the old house seemed
to become more mellow as the child, growing fast now and learning
to walk, staggered or stumbled or sprawled on the floors that had
long known the ways of children. Sir Philip would come home all
muddy from hunting and would rush into the nursery before pulling
off his boots, then down he would go on his hands and knees while
Stephen clambered on to his back. Sir Philip would pretend to be
well corned up, bucking and jumping and kicking wildly, so that
Stephen must cling to his hair or his collar, and thump him with
hard little arrogant fists. Anna, attracted by the outlandish
hubbub, would find them, and would point to the mud on the
carpet.</p>

<p>She would say: 'Now, Philip, now, Stephen, that's enough! It's
time for your tea', as though both of them were children. Then Sir
Philip would reach up and disentangle Stephen, after which he would
kiss Stephen's mother.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The son that they waited for seemed long a-coming; he had not
arrived when Stephen was seven. Nor had Anna produced other female
offspring. thus Stephen remained cock of the roost. It is doubtful
if any only child is to be envied, for the only child is bound to
become introspective; having no one of its own ilk in whom to
confide, it is apt to confide in itself. It cannot be said that at
seven years old the mind is beset by serious problems, but
nevertheless it is already groping, may already be subject to small
fits of dejection, may already be struggling to get a grip on
life&mdash;on the limited life of its surroundings. At seven there
are miniature loves and hatreds, which, however, loom large and are
extremely disconcerting. There may even be present a dim sense of
frustration, and Stephen was often conscious of this sense, though
she could not have put it into words. To cope with it, however, she
would give way at times to sudden fits of hot temper, working
herself up over everyday trifles that usually left her cold. It
relieved her to stamp and then burst into tears at the first sign
of opposition. After such outbursts she would feel much more
cheerful, would find it almost easy to be docile and obedient. In
some vague, childish way she had hit back at life, and this fact
had restored her self-respect.</p>

<p>Anna would send for her turbulent offspring and would say:
'Stephen darling, Mother's not really cross&mdash;tell Mother what
makes you give way to these tempers; she'll promise to try and
understand if you'll tell her&mdash;'</p>

<p>But her eyes would look cold, though her voice might be gentle,
and her hand when it fondled would be tentative, unwilling. The
hand would be making an effort to fondle, and Stephen would be
conscious of that effort. Then looking up at the calm, lovely face,
Stephen would be filled with a sudden contrition, with a sudden
deep sense of her own shortcomings; she would long to blurt all
this out to her mother, yet would stand there tongue-tied, saying
nothing at all. For these two were strangely shy with each
other&mdash;it was almost grotesque, this shyness of theirs, as
existing between mother and child. Anna would feel it, and through
her Stephen, young as she was, would become conscious of it; so
that they held a little aloof when they should have been drawing
together.</p>

<p>Stephen, acutely responsive to beauty, would be dimly longing to
find expression for a feeling almost amounting to worship, that her
mother's face had awakened. But Anna, looking gravely at her
daughter, noting the plentiful auburn hair, the brave hazel eyes
that were so like her father's, as indeed were the child's whole
expression and bearing, would be filled with a sudden antagonism
that came very near to anger.</p>

<p>She would awake at night and ponder this thing, scourging
herself in an access of contrition; accusing herself of hardness of
spirit, of being an unnatural mother. Sometimes she would shed
slow, miserable tears, remembering the inarticulate Stephen.</p>

<p>She would think: I ought to be proud of the likeness, proud and
happy and glad when I sec it! then back would come flooding that
queer antagonism that amounted almost to anger.</p>

<p>It would seem to Anna that she must be going mad, for this
likeness to her husband would strike her as an outrage&mdash;as
though the poor, innocent seven-year-old Stephen were in some way a
caricature of Sir Philip; a blemished, unworthy, maimed
reproduction&mdash;yet she knew that the child was handsome. But
now there were times when the child's soft flesh would be almost
distasteful to her; when she hated the way Stephen moved or stood
still, hated a certain largeness about her, a certain crude lack of
grace in her movements, a certain unconscious defiance. Then the
mother's mind would slip back to the days when this creature had
clung to her breast, forcing her to love it by its own utter
weakness; and at this thought her eyes must fill again, for she
came of a race of devoted mothers. The thing had crept on her like
a foe in the dark&mdash;it had been slow, insidious, deadly, it had
waxed strong as Stephen herself had waxed strong, being part, in
some way, of Stephen.</p>

<p>Restlessly tossing from side to side, Anna Gordon would pray for
enlightenment and guidance; would pray that her husband might never
suspect her feelings towards his child. All that she was and had
been he knew; in all the world she had no other secret save this
one most unnatural and monstrous injustice that was stronger than
her will to destroy it. And Sir Philip loved Stephen, he idolized
her; it was almost as though he divined by instinct that his
daughter was being secretly defrauded, was bearing some unmerited
burden. He never spoke to his wife of these things, yet watching
them together, she grew daily more certain that his love for the
child held an element in it that was closely akin to pity.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter Two</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>At about this time Stephen first became conscious of an urgent
necessity to love. She adored her father, but that was quite
different; he was part of herself, he had always been there, she
could not envisage the world without him&mdash;it was other with
Collins, the housemaid. Collins was what was called 'second of
three'; she might one day hope for promotion. Meanwhile she was
florid, full-lipped and full-bosomed, rather ample indeed for a
young girl of twenty, but her eyes were unusually blue and
arresting, very pretty inquisitive eyes. Stephen had seen Collins
sweeping the stairs for two years, and had passed her by quite
unnoticed; but one morning, when Stephen was just over seven,
Collins looked up and suddenly smiled, then all in a moment Stephen
knew that she loved her&mdash;a staggering revelation!</p>

<p>Collins said politely: 'Good morning, Miss Stephen.'</p>

<p>She had always said: 'Good morning, Miss Stephen,' but on this
occasion it sounded alluring&mdash;so alluring that Stephen wanted
to touch her, and extending a rather uncertain hand she started to
stroke her sleeve.</p>

<p>Collins picked up the hand and stared at it. 'Oh, my!' she
exclaimed, 'what very dirty nails!' Whereupon their owner flushed
painfully crimson and dashed upstairs to repair them.</p>

<p>'Put them scissors down this minute, Miss Stephen!' came the
nurse's peremptory voice, while her charge was still busily engaged
on her toilet.</p>

<p>But Stephen said firmly: 'I'm cleaning my nails 'cause Collins
doesn't like them&mdash;she says they're dirty!'</p>

<p>'What impudence!' snapped the nurse, thoroughly annoyed. 'I'll
thank her to mind her own business!'</p>

<p>Having finally secured the large cutting-out scissors, Mrs.
Bingham went forth in search of the offender; she was not one to
tolerate any interference with the dignity of her status. She found
Collins still on the top flight of stairs, and forthwith she
started to upbraid her: 'putting her back in her place,' the nurse
called it; and she did it so thoroughly that in less than five
minutes 'the second-of-three' had been told of every fault that was
likely to preclude promotion.</p>

<p>Stephen stood still in the nursery doorway. She could feel her
heart thumping against her side, thumping with anger and pity for
Collins who was answering never a word. There she knelt mute, with
her brush suspended, with her mouth slightly open and her eyes
rather scared; and when at long last she did manage to speak, her
voice sounded humble and frightened. She was timid by nature, and
the nurse's sharp tongue was a byword throughout the household.</p>

<p>Collins was saying: 'Interfere with your child? Oh, no, Mrs.
Bingham, never! I hope I knows my place better than that&mdash;Miss
Stephen herself showed me them dirty nails; she said: "Collins,
just look, aren't my nails awful dirty!" And I said: "You must ask
Nanny about that, Miss Stephen." Is it likely that I'd interfere
with your work? I'm not that sort, Mrs. Bingham.'</p>

<p>Oh, Collins, Collins, with those pretty blue eyes and that funny
alluring smile! Stephen's own eyes grew wide with amazement, then
they clouded with sudden and disillusioned tears, for far worse
than Collins' poorness of spirit was the dreadful injustice of
those lies&mdash;yet this very injustice seemed to draw her to
Collins, since despising, she could still love her.</p>

<p>For the rest of that day Stephen brooded darkly over Collins'
unworthiness; and yet all through that day she still wanted
Collins, and whenever she saw her she caught herself smiling, quite
unable, in her turn, to muster the courage to frown her innate
disapproval. And Collins smiled too, if the nurse was not looking,
and she held up her plump red fingers, pointing to her nails and
making a grimace at the nurse's retreating figure. Watching her,
Stephen felt unhappy and embarrassed, not so much for herself as
for Collins; and this feeling increased, so that thinking about her
made Stephen go hot down her spine.</p>

<p>In the evening, when Collins was laying the tea, Stephen managed
to get her alone. 'Collins,' she whispered, 'you told an
untruth&mdash;I never showed you my dirty nails!'</p>

<p>'Course not!' murmured Collins, 'but I had to say
something&mdash;you didn't mind, Miss Stephen, did you?' And as
Stephen looked doubtfully up into her face, Collins suddenly
stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p>Stephen stood speechless from a sheer sense of joy, all her
doubts swept completely away. At that moment she knew nothing but
beauty and Collins, and the two were as one, and the one was
Stephen&mdash;and yet not Stephen either, but something more vast,
that the mind of seven years found no name for.</p>

<p>The nurse came in grumbling: 'Now then, hurry up, Miss Stephen!
Don't stand there as though you were daft! Go and wash your face
and hands before tea&mdash;how many times must I tell you the same
thing?'</p>

<p>'I don't know&mdash;' muttered Stephen. And indeed she did not;
she knew nothing of such trifles at that moment.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>From now on Stephen entered a completely new world, that turned
on an axis of Collins. A world full of constant exciting
adventures; of elation, of joy, of incredible sadness, but withal a
fine place to be dashing about in like a moth who is courting a
candle. Up and down went the days; they resembled a swing that
soared high above the tree-tops, then dropped to the depths, but
seldom if ever hung midway. And with them went Stephen, clinging to
the swing, waking up in the mornings with a thrill of vague
excitement&mdash;the sort of excitement that belonged by rights to
birthdays, and Christmas, and a visit to the pantomime at Malvern.
She would open her eyes and jump out of bed quickly, still too
sleepy to remember why she felt so elated; but then would come
memory&mdash;she would know that this day she was actually going to
sec Collins. The thought would set her splashing in her sitz-bath,
and tearing the buttons off her clothes in her haste, and cleaning
her nails with such ruthlessness and vigour that she made them
quite sore in the process.</p>

<p>She began to be very inattentive at her lessons, sucking her
pencil, staring out of the window, or what was far worse, not
listening at all, except for Collins' footsteps. The nurse slapped
her hands, and stood her in the corner, and deprived her of jam,
but all to no purpose; for Stephen would smile, hugging closer her
secret&mdash;it was worth being punished for Collins.</p>

<p>She grew restless and could not be induced to sit still even
when her nurse read aloud. At one time she had very much liked
being read to, especially from books that were all about heroes,
but now such stories so stirred her ambition that she longed
intensely to live them. She, Stephen, now longed to be William
tell, or Nelson, or the whole Charge of Balaclava; and this led to
much foraging in the nursery ragbag, much hunting up of garments
once used for charades, much swagger and noise, much strutting and
posing, and much staring into the mirror. There ensued a period of
general confusion when the nursery looked as though smitten by an
earthquake; when the chairs and the floor would be littered with
oddments that Stephen had dug out but discarded. Once dressed, she
would walk away grandly, waving the nurse peremptorily aside,
going, as always, in search of Collins, who might have to be
stalked to the basement.</p>

<p>Sometimes Collins would play up, especially to Nelson. 'My, but
you do look fine!' she would exclaim. And then to the cook: 'Do
come here, Mrs. Wilson! Doesn't Miss Stephen look exactly like a
boy? I believe she must be a boy with them shoulders, and them
funny gawky legs she's got on her!'</p>

<p>And Stephen would say gravely: 'Yes, of course I'm a boy. I'm
young Nelson, and I'm saying: "What is fear?" you know,
Collins&mdash;I must be a boy, 'cause I feel exactly like one, I
feel like young Nelson in the picture upstairs.'</p>

<p>Collins would laugh and so would Mrs. Wilson, and after Stephen
had gone they would get talking, and Collins might say: 'She is a
queer kid, always dressing herself up and play-acting&mdash;it's
funny.'</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wilson might show disapproval: 'I don't hold with such
nonsense, not for a young lady. Miss Stephen's quite different from
other young ladies&mdash;she's got none of their pretty little
ways&mdash;it's a pity!'</p>

<p>There were times, however, when Collins seemed sulky, when
Stephen could dress up as Nelson in vain. 'Now, don't bother me,
Miss, I've got my work to see to!' or: 'You go and show
Nurse&mdash;yes, I know you're a boy, but I've got my work to get
on with. Run away.'</p>

<p>And Stephen must slink upstairs thoroughly deflated, strangely
unhappy and exceedingly humble, and must tear off the clothes she
so dearly loved donning, to replace them by the garments she hated.
How she hated soft dresses and sashes, and ribbons, and small coral
beads, and openwork stockings! Her legs felt so free and
comfortable in breeches; she adored pockets, too, and these were
forbidden&mdash;at least really adequate pockets. She would gloom
about the nursery because Collins had snubbed her, because she was
conscious of feeling all wrong, because she so longed to be someone
quite real, instead of just Stephen pretending to be Nelson. In a
quick fit of anger she would go to the cupboard, and getting out
her dolls would begin to torment them. She had always despised the
idiotic creatures which, however, arrived with each Christmas and
birthday.</p>

<p>'I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!' she would mutter, thumping
their innocuous faces.</p>

<p>But one day, when Collins had been crosser than usual, she
seemed to be filled with a sudden contrition. 'It's me housemaid's
knee,' she confided to Stephen. 'It's not you, it's me, housemaid's
knee, dearie.'</p>

<p>'Is that dangerous?' demanded the child, looking frightened.</p>

<p>Then Collins, true to her class, said: 'It may be&mdash;it may
mean an 'orrible operation, and I don't want no operation.'</p>

<p>'What's that?' inquired Stephen.</p>

<p>'Why, they'd cut me,' moaned Collins; 'they'd 'ave to cut me to
let out the water.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Collins! What water?'</p>

<p>'The water in me kneecap&mdash;you can see if you press it, Miss
Stephen.'</p>

<p>They were standing alone in the spacious night-nursery, where
Collins was limply making the bed. It was one of those rare and
delicious occasions when Stephen could converse with her goddess
undisturbed, for the nurse had gone out to post a letter. Collins
rolled down a coarse woollen stocking and displayed the afflicted
member; it was blotchy and swollen and far from attractive, but
Stephen's eyes filled with quick, anxious tears as she touched the
knee with her finger.</p>

<p>'There now!' exclaimed Collins. 'See that dent? That's the
water!' And she added: 'It's so painful it fair makes me sick. It
all comes from polishing them floors, Miss Stephen; I didn't ought
to polish them floors.'</p>

<p>Stephen said gravely: 'I do wish I'd got it&mdash;I wish I'd got
your housemaid's knee, Collins, 'cause that way I could bear it
instead of you. I'd like to be awfully hurt for you, Collins, the
way Jesus was hurt for sinners. Suppose I pray hard, don't you
think I might catch it? Or supposing I rub my knee against
yours?'</p>

<p>'Lord bless you!' laughed Collins, 'it's not like the measles;
no, Miss Stephen, it's caught from them floors.'</p>

<p>That evening Stephen became rather pensive, and she turned to
the <i>Child's Book of Scripture Stories</i> and she studied the
picture of the Lord on His Cross, and she felt that she understood
Him. She had often been rather puzzled about Him, since she herself
was fearful of pain&mdash;when she barked her shins on the gravel
in the garden, it was not always easy to keep back her
tears&mdash;and yet Jesus had chosen to bear pain for sinners, when
He might have called up all those angels! Oh, yes, she had wondered
a great deal about Him, but now she no longer wondered.</p>

<p>At bedtime, when her mother came to hear her say her
prayers&mdash;as custom demanded&mdash;Stephen's prayers lacked
conviction. But when Anna kissed her and had turned out the light,
then it was that Stephen prayed in good earnest&mdash;with such
fervour, indeed, that she dripped perspiration in a veritable orgy
of prayer.</p>

<p>'Please, Jesus, give me a housemaid's knee instead of
Collins&mdash;do, <i>do</i>, Lord Jesus. Please Jesus, I would like
to bear all Collins' pain the way You did, and I don't want any
angels! I would like to wash Collins in my blood, Lord
Jesus&mdash;I would like very much to be a Saviour to
Collins&mdash;I love her, and I want to be hurt like You were;
please, dear Lord Jesus, do let me. Please give me a knee that's
all full of water, so that I can have Collins' operation. I want to
have it instead of her, 'cause she's frightened&mdash;I'm not a bit
frightened!'</p>

<p>This petition she repeated until she fell asleep, to dream that
in some queer way she was Jesus, and that Collins was kneeling and
kissing her hand, because she, Stephen, had managed to cure her by
cutting off her knee with a bone paper-knife and grafting it on to
her own. The dream was a mixture of rapture and discomfort, and it
stayed quite a long time with Stephen.</p>

<p>The next morning she awoke with the feeling of elation that
comes only in moments of perfect faith. But a close examination of
her knees in the bath revealed them to be flawless except for old
scars and a crisp, brown scab from a recent tumble&mdash;this, of
course, was very disappointing. She picked off the scab, and that
hurt her a little, but not, she felt sure, like a real housemaid's
knee. However, she decided to continue in prayer, and not to be too
easily downhearted.</p>

<p>For more than three weeks she sweated and prayed, and pestered
poor Collins with endless daily questions: 'Is your knee better
yet?' 'Don't you think my knee's swollen?' 'Have you faith? 'Cause
I have&mdash;' 'Does it hurt you less, Collins?'</p>

<p>But Collins would always reply in the same way: 'It's no better,
thank you, Miss Stephen.'</p>

<p>At the end of the fourth week, Stephen suddenly stopped praying,
and she said to Our Lord: 'You don't love Collins, Jesus, but I do,
and I'm going to get housemaid's knee. You see if I don't!' Then
she felt rather frightened, and added more humbly: 'I mean, I do
want to&mdash;You don't mind, do You, Lord Jesus?'</p>

<p>The nursery floor was covered with carpet, which was obviously
rather unfortunate for Stephen; had it only been parquet like the
drawing-room and study, she felt it would better have served her
purpose. All the same it was hard if she knelt long enough&mdash;it
was so hard, indeed, that she had to grit her teeth if she stayed
on her knees for more than twenty minutes. This was much worse than
barking one's shins in the garden; it was much worse even than
picking off a scab! Nelson helped her a little. She would think:
'Now I'm Nelson. I'm in the middle of thee Battle of
Trafalgar&mdash;I've got shots in my knees.' But then she would
remember that Nelson had been spared such torment. However, it was
really rather fine to be suffering&mdash;it certainly seemed to
bring Collins much nearer; it seemed to make Stephen feel that she
owned her by right of this diligent pain.</p>

<p>There were endless spots on the old nursery carpet, and these
spots Stephen could pretend to be cleaning; always careful to copy.
Collins' movements, rubbing backwards and forwards while groaning a
little. When she got up at last, she must hold her left leg and
limp, still groaning a little. Enormous new holes appeared in her
stockings, through which she could examine her aching knees, and
this led to rebuke: 'Stop your nonsense, Miss Stephen! It's
scandalous the way you're tearing your stockings!' But Stephen
smiled grimly and went on with the nonsense, spurred by love to an
open defiance. On the eighth day, however, it dawned upon Stephen
that Collins should be shown the proof of her devotion. Her knees
were particularly scarified that morning, so she limped off in
search of the unsuspecting housemaid.</p>

<p>Collins stared: 'Good gracious, whatever's the matter? Whatever
have you been doing, Miss Stephen?'</p>

<p>Then Stephen said, not without pardonable pride: 'I've been
getting a housemaid's knee, like you, Collins!' And as Collins
looked stupid and rather bewildered&mdash;'You see, I wanted to
share your suffering. I've prayed quite a lot, but Jesus won't
listen, so I've got to get housemaid's knee my own way&mdash;I
can't wait any longer for Jesus!'</p>

<p>'Oh, hush!' murmured Collins, thoroughly shocked. 'You mustn't
say such things: it's wicked, Miss Stephen.' But she smiled a
little in spite of herself, then she suddenly hugged the child
warmly.</p>

<p>All the same, Collins plucked up her courage that evening and
spoke to the nurse about Stephen. 'Her knees was all red and
swollen, Mrs. Bingham. Did you ever know such a queer fish as she
is? Praying about my knee, too. She's a caution! And now if she
isn't trying to get one! Well, if that's not real loving then I
don't know nothing.' And Collins began to laugh weakly.</p>

<p>After this Mrs. Bingham rose in her might, and the self-imposed
torture was forcibly stopped. Collins, on her part, was ordered to
lie, if Stephen continued to question. So Collins lied nobly: 'It's
better, Miss Stephen, it must be your praying&mdash;you see Jesus
heard you. I expect He was sorry to see your poor knees&mdash;I
know as I was when I saw them!'</p>

<p>'Are you telling me the truth?' Stephen asked her, still
doubting, still mindful of that first day of Love's young
dream.</p>

<p>'Why, of course I'm telling you the truth, Miss Stephen.' And
with this Stephen had to be content.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Collins became more affectionate after the incident of the
housemaid's knee; she could not but feel a new interest in the
child whom she and the cook had now labelled as 'queer', and
Stephen basked in much surreptitious petting, and her love for
Collins grew daily.</p>

<p>It was spring, the season of gentle emotions, and Stephen, for
the first time, became aware of spring. In a dumb, childish way she
was conscious of its fragrance, and the house irked her sorely, and
she longed for the meadows, and the hills that were white with
thorn-trees. Her active young body was for ever on the fidget, but
her mind was bathed in a kind of soft haze, and this she could
never quite put into words, though she tried to tell Collins about
it. It was all part of Collins, yet somehow quite
different&mdash;it had nothing to do with Collins' wide smile, nor
her hands which were red, nor even her eyes which were blue, and
very arresting. Yet all that was Collins, Stephen's Collins, was
also a part of these long, warm days, apart of the twilights that
came in and lingered for hours after Stephen had been put to bed; a
part too, could Stephen have only known it, of her own quickening
childish perceptions. this spring, for the first time, she thrilled
to the cuckoo, standing quite still to listen, with her head on one
side; and the lure of that far-away call was destined to remain
with her all her life.</p>

<p>There were times when she wanted to get away from Collins, yet
at others she longed intensely to be near her, longed to force the
response that her loving craved for, but quite wisely was very
seldom granted.</p>

<p>She would say: 'I do love you awfully, Collins. I love you so
much that it makes me want to cry.'</p>

<p>And Collins would answer: 'Don't be silly, Miss Stephen,' which
was not satisfactory&mdash;not at all satisfactory.</p>

<p>Then Stephen might suddenly push her, in anger: 'You're a beast!
How I hate you, Collins!'</p>

<p>And now Stephen had taken to keeping awake every night, in order
to build up pictures: pictures of herself companioned by Collins in
all sorts of happy situations. Perhaps they would be walking in the
garden, hand in hand, or pausing on a hillside to listen to the
cuckoo; or perhaps they would be skimming over miles of blue ocean
in a queer little ship with a leg-of-mutton sail, like the one in
the fairy story. Sometimes Stephen pictured them living alone in a
low thatched cottage by the side of a mill stream&mdash;she had
seen such a cottage not very far from Upton&mdash;and the water
flowed quickly and made talking noises; there were sometimes dead
leaves on the water. This last was a very intimate picture, full of
detail, even to the red china dogs that stood one at each end of
the high mantelpiece, and the grandfather clock that ticked loudly.
Collins would sit by the fire with her shoes off. 'Me feet's that
swollen and painful,' she would say. Then Stephen would go and cut
rich bread and butter&mdash;the drawing-room kind, little bread and
much butter&mdash;and would put on the kettle and brew tea for
Collins, who liked it very strong and practically boiling, so that
she could sip it from her saucer. In this picture it was Collins
who talked about loving, and Stephen who gently but firmly rebuked
her: 'There, there, Collins, don't be silly, you are a queer fish!'
And yet all the while she would be longing to tell her how
wonderful it was, like honeysuckle blossom&mdash;something very
sweet like that&mdash;or like fields smelling strongly of new-mown
hay, in the sunshine. And perhaps she would tell her, just at the
very end&mdash;just before the last picture faded.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>In these days Stephen clung more closely to her father, and this
in a way was because of Collins. She could not have told you why it
was so, she only felt that it was. Sir Philip and his daughter
would walk on the hill-sides, in and out of the black-thorn and
young green bracken; they would walk hand in hand with a deep sense
of friendship, with a deep sense of mutual understanding.</p>

<p>Sir Philip, knew all about wild flowers and berries, and the
ways of young foxes and rabbits and such people. There were many
rare birds, too, on the hills near Malvern, and these he would
point out to Stephen. He taught her the simpler laws of nature,
which, though simple, had always filled him with wonder: the law of
the sap as it flowed through the branches, the law of the wind that
came stirring the sap, the law of bird life and the building of
nests, the law of the cuckoo's varying call, which in June changed
to Cuckoo-kook!' He taught out of love for both subject and pupil,
and while he thus taught he watched Stephen.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the child's heart would feel full past bearing,
she must tell him her problems in small, stumbling phrases. Tell
him how much she longed to be different, longed to be someone like
Nelson.</p>

<p>She would say: 'Do you think that I could be a man, supposing I
thought very hard&mdash;or prayed, Father?'</p>

<p>Then Sir Philip would smile and tease her a little, and would
tell her that one day she would want pretty frocks, and his teasing
was always excessively gentle, so that it hurt not at all.</p>

<p>But at times he would study his daughter gravely, with his
strong, cleft chin tightly cupped in his hand. He would watch her
at play with the dogs in the garden, watch the curious suggestion
of strength in her movements, the long line of her limbs&mdash;she
was tall for her age&mdash;and the poise of her head on her
over-broad shoulders. Then perhaps he would frown and become lost
in thought, or perhaps he might suddenly call her:</p>

<p>'Stephen, come here!'</p>

<p>She would go to him gladly, waiting expectant for what he should
say; but as likely as not he would just hold her to him for a
moment, and then let go of her abruptly. Getting up he would turn
to the house and his study, to spend all the rest of that day with
his books.</p>

<p>A queer mixture, Sir Philip, part sportsman, part student. He
had one of the finest libraries in England, and just lately he had
taken to reading half the night, which had not hitherto been his
custom. Alone in that grave-looking, quiet study, he would unlock a
drawer in his ample desk, and would get out a slim volume recently
acquired, and would read and re-read it in the silence. The author
was a German, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, and reading, Sir Philip's eyes
would grow puzzled; then groping for a pencil he would make little
notes all along the immaculate margins. Sometimes he would jump up
and pace the room quickly, pausing now and again to stare at a
picture&mdash;the portrait of Stephen painted with her mother, by
Millais, the previous year. He would notice the gracious beauty of
Anna, so perfect a thing, so completely reassuring; and then that
indefinable quality in Stephen that made her look wrong in the
clothes she was wearing, as though she and they had no right to
each other, but above all no right to Anna. After a while he would
steal up to bed, being painfully careful to tread very softly,
fearful of waking his wife who might question: 'Philip, darling,
it's so late&mdash;what have you been reading?' He would not want
to answer, he would not want to tell her; that was why he must
tread very softly.</p>

<p>The next morning, he would be very tender to Anna&mdash;but even
more tender to Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>As the spring waxed more lusty and strode into summer, Stephen
grew conscious that Collins was changing. The change was almost
intangible at first, but the instinct of children is not mocked.
Came a day when Collins turned on her quite sharply, nor did she
explain it by a reference to her knee.</p>

<p>'Don't always be under my feet now, Miss Stephen. Don't follow
me about and don't be always staring. I 'ates being
watched&mdash;you run up to the nursery, the basement's no place
for young ladies.' After which such rebuffs were of frequent
occurrence, if Stephen went anywhere near her.</p>

<p>Miserable enigma! Stephen's mind groped about it like a little
blind mole that is always in darkness. She was utterly confounded,
while her love grew the stronger for so much hard pruning, and she
tried to woo Collins by offerings of bull's-eyes and chocolate
drops, which the maid took because she liked them. Nor was Collins
so blameworthy as she appeared, for she, in her turn, was the
puppet of emotion. The new footman was tall and exceedingly
handsome. He had looked upon Collins with eyes of approval. He had
said: Stop that damned kid hanging around you; if you don't she'll
go blabbing about us.'</p>

<p>And now Stephen knew very deep desolation because there was no
one in whom to confide. She shrank from telling even her
father&mdash;he might not understand, he might smile, he might
tease her&mdash;if he teased her, however gently, she knew that she
could not keep back her tears. Even Nelson had suddenly become
quite remote. What was the good of trying to be Nelson? What was
the good of dressing up any more&mdash;what was the good of
pretending? She turned from her food, growing pasty and languid;
until, thoroughly alarmed, Anna sent for the doctor. He arrived,
and prescribed a dose of Gregory powder, finding nothing much wrong
with the patient. Stephen tossed off the foul brew without a
murmur&mdash;it was almost as though she liked it!</p>

<p>The end came abruptly as is often the way, and it came when the
child was alone in the garden, still miserably puzzling over
Collins, who had been avoiding her for days. Stephen had wandered
to an old potting-shed, and there, whom should she see but Collins
and the footman; they appeared to be talking very earnestly
together, so earnestly that they failed to hear her. Then a really
catastrophic thing happened, for Henry caught Collins roughly by
the wrists, and dragged her towards him, still handling her
roughly, and he kissed her full on the lips. Stephen's head
suddenly felt hot and dizzy, she was filled with a blind,
uncomprehending rage; she wanted to cry out, but her voice failed
completely, so that all she could do was to splutter. But the very
next moment she had seized a broken flower-pot and had hurled it
hard and straight at the footman. It struck him in the face,
cutting open his cheek, down which the blood trickled slowly. He
stood as though stunned, gently mopping the cut, while Collins
stared dumbly at Stephen. Neither of them spoke, they were feeling
too guilty&mdash;they were also too much astonished.</p>

<p>Then Stephen turned and fled from them wildly. Away and away,
anyhow, anywhere, so long as she need not see them! She sobbed as
she ran and covered her eyes, tearing her clothes on the shrubs in
passing, tearing her stockings and the skin of her legs as she
lunged against intercepting branches. But suddenly the child was
caught in strong arms, and her face was pressing against her
father, and Sir Philip was carrying her back to the house, and
along the wide passage to his study. He held her on his knee,
forbearing to question, and at first she crouched there like a
little dumb creature that had somehow got itself wounded. But her
heart was too young to contain this new trouble&mdash;too heavy it
felt, too much over-burdened, so the trouble came bubbling up from
her heart and was told on Sir Philip's shoulder.</p>

<p>He listened very gravely, just stroking her hair.
'Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;' he said softly; and then: go on, Stephen.'
And when she had finished he was silent for some moments, while he
went on stroking her hair. Then he said: 'I think I understand,
Stephen&mdash;this thing seems more dreadful than anything else
that has ever happened, more utterly dreadful&mdash;but you'll find
that it will pass and be completely forgotten&mdash;you must try to
believe me, Stephen. And now I'm going to treat you like a boy, and
a boy must always be brave, remember. I'm not going to pretend as
though you were a coward; why should I when I know that you're
brave? I'm going to send Collins away to-morrow; do you understand,
Stephen? I shall send her away. I shan't be unkind, but she'll go
away to-morrow, and meanwhile I don't want you to see her again.
You'll miss her at first, that will only be natural, but in time
you'll find that you'll forget all about her; this trouble will
just seem like nothing at all. I am telling you the truth, dear, I
swear it. If you need me, remember that I'm always near
you&mdash;you can come to my study whenever you like. You can talk
to me about it whenever you're unhappy, and you want a companion to
talk to.' He paused, then finished rather abruptly: 'Don't worry
your mother, just come to, me, Stephen.'</p>

<p>And Stephen, still catching her breath, looked straight at him.
She nodded, and Sir Philip saw his own mournful eyes gazing back
from his daughter's tear-stained face. But her lips set more
firmly, and the cleft in her chin grew more marked with a new,
childish will to courage.</p>

<p>Bending down, he kissed her in absolute silence&mdash;it was
like the sealing of a sorrowful pact.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>6</b>
</p>

<p>Anna, who had been out at the time of the disaster, returned to
find her husband waiting for her in the hall.</p>

<p>'Stephen's been naughty, she's up in the nursery; she's had one
of her fits of temper,' he remarked.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that he had obviously been waiting to
intercept Anna, he now spoke quite lightly. Collins and the footman
must go, he told her. As for Stephen, he had had a long talk with
her already&mdash;Anna had better just let the thing drop, it had
only been childish temper.</p>

<p>Anna hurried upstairs to her daughter. She, herself, had not
been a turbulent child, and Stephen's outbursts always made her
feel helpless; however, she was fully prepared for the worst. But
she found Stephen sitting with her chin on her hand, and calmly
staring out of the window; her eyes were still swollen and her face
very pale, otherwise she showed no great signs of emotion; indeed
she actually smiled up at Anna&mdash;it was rather a stiff little
smile. Anna talked kindly and Stephen listened, nodding her head
from time to time in acquiescence. But Anna felt awkward, and as
though for some reason the child was anxious to reassure her; that
smile had meant to be reassuring&mdash;it had been such a very
unchildish smile. The mother was doing all the talking she found.
Stephen would not discuss her affection for Collins; on this point
she was firmly, obdurately silent. She neither excused nor upheld
her action in throwing a broken flower-pot at the footman.</p>

<p>'She's trying to keep something back,' thought Anna, feeling
more nonplussed every moment.</p>

<p>In the end Stephen took her mother's hand gravely and proceeded
to stroke it, as though she were consoling. She said: 'Don't feel
worried, 'cause that worries Father&mdash;I promise I'll try not to
get into tempers, but you promise that you won't go on feeling
worried.'</p>

<p>And absurd though it seemed, Anna heard herself saying: 'Very
well then&mdash;I do promise, Stephen.'</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter Three</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen never went to her father's study in order to talk of her
grief over Collins. A reticence strange in so young a child,
together with a new, stubborn pride, held her tongue-tied, so that
she fought out her battle alone, and Sir Philip allowed her to do
so. Collins disappeared and with her the footman, and in Collins'
stead came a new second housemaid, a niece of Mrs. Bingham's, who
was even more timid than her predecessor, and who talked not at
all. She was ugly, having small, round black eyes like
currants&mdash;not inquisitive blue eyes like Collins.</p>

<p>With set lips and tight throat Stephen watched this intruder as
she scuttled to and fro doing Collins' duties. She would sit and
scowl at poor Winefred darkly, devising small torments to add to
her labours&mdash;such as stepping on dustpans and upsetting their
contents, or hiding away brooms and brushes and
slop-cloths&mdash;until Winefred, distracted, would finally unearth
them from the most inappropriate places.</p>

<p>''Owever did them slop-cloths get in 'ere!' she would mutter,
discovering them under a nursery cushion. And her face would grow
blotchy with anxiety and fear as she glanced towards Mrs.
Bingham.</p>

<p>But at night, when the child lay lonely and wakeful, these acts
that had proved a consolation in the morning, having sprung from a
desperate kind of loyalty to Collins&mdash;these acts would seem
trivial and silly and useless, since Collins could neither know of
them nor see them, and the tears that had been held in check
through the day would well under Stephen's eyelids. Nor could she,
in those lonely watches of the night-time, pluck up courage enough
to reproach the Lord Jesus, Who, she felt, could have helped her
quite well had He chosen to accord her a housemaid's knee.</p>

<p>She would think; 'He loves neither me nor Collins&mdash;He wants
all the pain for Himself; He won't share it!'</p>

<p>And then she would feel contrite: 'Oh, I'm sorry, Lord Jesus,
'cause I do know You love all miserable sinners!' And the thought
that perhaps she had been unjust to Jesus would reduce her to still
further tears.</p>

<p>Very dreadful indeed were those nights spent in weeping, spent
in doubting the Lord and His servant Collins. The hours would drag
by in intolerable blackness, that in passing seemed to envelop
Stephen's body, making her feel now hot and now cold. The
grandfather clock on the stairs ticked so loudly that her head
ached to hear its unnatural ticking&mdash;when it chimed, which it
did at the hours and half-hours, its voice seemed to shake the
whole house with terror, until Stephen would creep down under the
bed-clothes to hide from she knew not what. But presently, huddled
beneath the blankets, the child would be soothed by a warm sense of
safety, and her nerves would relax, while her body grew limp with
the drowsy softness of bed. Then suddenly a big and comforting
yawn, and another, and another, until darkness and Collins and tall
clocks that menaced, and Stephen herself; were all blended and
merged into something quite friendly, a harmonious whole, neither
fearful nor doubting&mdash;the blessed illusion we call sleep.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed on Collins' departure, Anna tried to
be very gentle with her daughter, having the child more frequently
with her, more diligently fondling Stephen. Mother and daughter
would walk in the garden, or wander about together through the
meadows, and Anna would remember the son of her dreams, who had
played with her in those meadows. A great sadness would cloud her
eyes for a moment, an infinite regret as she looked down at
Stephen; and Stephen, quick to discern that sadness, would press
Anna's hand with small, anxious fingers; she would long to inquire
what troubled her mother, but would be held speechless through
shyness.</p>

<p>The scents of the meadows would move those two
strangely&mdash;the queer, pungent smell from the hearts of
dog-daisies; the buttercup smell, faintly green like the grass; and
then meadow-sweet that grew close by the hedges. Sometimes Stephen
must tug at her mother's sleeve sharply&mdash;intolerable to bear
that thick fragrance alone!</p>

<p>One day she had said: Stand still or you'll hurt it&mdash;it's
all round us&mdash;it's a white smell, it reminds me of you!' And
then she had flushed, and had glanced up quickly, rather frightened
in case she should find Anna laughing.</p>

<p>But her mother had looked at her curiously, gravely, puzzled by
this creature who seemed all contradictions&mdash;at one moment so
hard, at another so gentle, gentle to tenderness, even. Anna had
been stirred, as her child had been stirred, by the breath of the
meadow-sweet under the hedges; for in this they were one, the
mother and daughter, having each in her veins the warm Celtic blood
that takes note of such things&mdash;could they only have divined
it, such simple things might have formed a link between them.</p>

<p>A great will to loving had suddenly possessed Anna Gordon, there
in that sunlit meadow&mdash;had possessed them both as they stood
together, bridging the gulf between maturity and childhood. They
had gazed at each other as though asking for something, as though
seeking for something, the one from the other; then the moment had
passed&mdash;they had walked on in silence, no nearer in spirit
than before.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Sometimes Anna would drive Stephen into Great Malvern, to the
shops, with lunch at the Abbey Hotel on cold beef and wholesome
rice pudding. Stephen loathed these excursions, which meant
dressing up, but she bore them because of the honour which she felt
to be hers when escorting her mother through the streets,
especially Church Street with its long, busy hill, because everyone
saw you in Church Street. Hats would be lifted with obvious
respect, while a humbler finger might fly to a forelock; women
would bow, and a few even curtsy to the lady of Morton&mdash;women
in from the country with speckled sunbonnets that looked like their
hens, and kind faces like brown, wrinkled apples. Then Anna must
stop to inquire about calves and babies and foals, indeed all such
creatures as prosper on farms, and her voice would be gentle
because she loved such young creatures.</p>

<p>Stephen would stand just a little behind her, thinking how
gracious and lovely she was; comparing her slim and elegant
shoulders with the toil-thickened back of old Mrs. Bennett, with
the ugly, bent spine of young Mrs. Thompson, who coughed when she
spoke and then said: 'I beg pardon!' as though she were conscious
that one did not cough in front of a goddess like Anna.</p>

<p>Presently Anna would look round for Stephen: 'Oh, there you are,
darling! We must go into Jackson's and change mother's books'; or,
'Nanny wants some more saucers; let's walk on and get them at
Langley's.'</p>

<p>Stephen would suddenly spring to attention, especially if they
were crossing the street. She would look right and left for
imaginary traffic, slipping a hand under Anna's elbow.</p>

<p>'Come with me,' she would order; 'and take care of the puddles,
'cause you might get your feet wet&mdash;hold on by me,
Mother!'</p>

<p>Anna would feel the small hand at her elbow, and would think
that the fingers were curiously strong; strong and efficient they
would feel like Sir Philip's and this always vaguely displeased
her. Nevertheless she would smile at Stephen while she let the
child guide her in and out between the puddles.</p>

<p>She would say: thank you, dear; you're as strong as a lion!'
trying to keep that displeasure from her voice.</p>

<p>Very protective and careful was Stephen when she and her mother
were out alone together. Not all her queer shyness could prevent
her protecting, nor could Anna's own shyness save her from
protection, She was forced to submit to a quiet supervision that
was painstaking, gentle but extremely persistent. And yet was this
love? Anna often wondered. It was not, she felt sure, the trusting
devotion that Stephen had always felt for her father; it was more
like a sort of instinctive admiration, coupled with a large,
patient kindness.</p>

<p>'If she'd only talk to me as she talks to Philip, I might get to
understand her,' Anna would muse. 'It's so odd not to know what
she's feeling and thinking, to suspect that something's always
being kept in the background.'</p>

<p>Their drives home from Malvern were usually silent, for Stephen
would feel that her task was accomplished, her mother no longer
needing her protection now that the coachman had the care of them
both&mdash;he, and the arrogant-looking grey cobs that were yet so
mannerly and gentle. As for Anna, she would sigh and lean back in
her corner, weary of trying to make conversation. She would wonder
if Stephen were tired or just sulky, or if, after all, the child
might be stupid. Ought she, perhaps, to feel sorry for the child?
She could never quite make up her mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Stephen, enjoying the comfortable brougham, would
begin to indulge in kaleidoscopic musings, those musings that
belong to the end of the day, and occasionally visit children. Mrs.
Thompson's bent spine, it looked like a bow&mdash;not a rainbow but
one of the archery kind; if you stretched a tight string from her
feet to her head, could you shoot straight with Mrs. Thompson?
China dogs&mdash;they had nice china dogs at Langley's&mdash;that
made you think of someone; oh, yes, of course,
Collins&mdash;Collins and a cottage with red china dogs. But you
tried not to think about Collins! there was such a queer light
slanting over the hills, a kind of gold glory, and it made you feel
sorry&mdash;why should a gold glory make you feel sorry when it
shone that way on the hills? Rice pudding, almost as bad as
tapioca&mdash;not quite though, because it was not so
slimy&mdash;tapioca evaded your efforts to chew it, it felt horrid,
like biting down on your own gum. The lanes smelt of wetness, a
wonderful smell! Yet when Nanny washed things they only smelt
soapy&mdash;but then, of course, God washed the world without soap:
being God, perhaps He didn't need any&mdash;you needed a lot,
especially for hands&mdash;did God wash His hands without soap?
Mother, talking about calves and babies, and looking like the
Virgin Mary in church, the one in the stained-glass window with
Jesus, which reminded you of Church Street, not a bad place after
all; Church Street was really rather exciting&mdash;what fun it
must be for men to have hats that they could take off, instead of
just smiling&mdash;a bowler must be much more fun than a
Leghorn&mdash;you couldn't take that off to Mother&mdash;</p>

<p>The brougham would roll smoothly along the white road, between
stout leafy hedges starred with dog-roses; blackbirds and thrushes
would be singing loudly, so loudly that Stephen could hear their
voices above the quick clip, clip of the cobs and the muffled
sounds of the carriage. Then from under her brows she must glance
across at Anna, who she knew loved the songs of blackbirds and
thrushes; but Anna's face would be hidden in shadow, while her
hands lay placidly folded.</p>

<p>And now the horses, nearing their stables, would redouble their
efforts as they swung through the gates, the tall, iron gates of
the parklands of Morton, faithful gates that had always meant home.
Old trees would fly past, then the paddocks with their
cattle&mdash;Worcestershire cattle with uncanny white faces; then
the two quiet lakes where the swans reared their cygnets; then the
lawns, and at last the wide curve in the drive, near the house,
that would lead to the massive entrance.</p>

<p>The child was too young to know why the beauty of Morton would
bring a lump to her throat when seen thus in the gold haze of late
afternoon, with its thoughts of evening upon it. She would want to
cry out in a kind of protest that was very near tears: 'Stop
it&mdash;stop it, you're hurting!' But instead she would blink hard
and shut her lips tightly, unhappy yet happy. It was a queer
feeling; it was too big for Stephen, who was still rather little
when it came to affairs of the spirit. For the spirit of Morton
would be part of her then, and would always remain somewhere deep
down within her, aloof and untouched by the years that must follow,
by the stress and the ugliness of life. In those after-years
certain scents would evoke it&mdash;the scent of damp rushes
growing by water; the kind, slightly milky odour of cattle; the
smell of dried rose-leaves and orris-root and violets, that
together with a vague suggestion of bees-wax always hung about
Anna's rooms. Then that part of Stephen that she still shared with
Morton would know what it was to feel terribly lonely, like a soul
that wakes up to find itself wandering, unwanted, between the
spheres.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Anna and Stephen would take off their coats, and go to the study
in search of Sir Philip who would usually be there waiting.</p>

<p>'Hallo, Stephen!' he would say in his pleasant, deep voice, but
his eyes would be resting on Anna.</p>

<p>Stephen's eyes invariably followed her father's, so that she too
would stand looking at Anna, and sometimes she must catch her
breath in surprise at the fullness of that calm beauty. She never
got used to her mother's beauty, it always surprised her each time
she saw it; it was one of those queerly unbearable things, like the
fragrance of meadow-sweet under the hedges.</p>

<p>Anna might say: 'What's the matter, Stephen? For goodness' sake
darling, do stop staring!' And Stephen would feel hot with shame
and confusion because Anna had caught her staring.</p>

<p>Sir Philip usually came to her rescue: 'Stephen, here's that new
picture-book about hunting'; or, 'I know of a really nice print of
young Nelson; if you're good I'll order it for you tomorrow'.</p>

<p>But after a little he and Anna must get talking, amusing
themselves irrespective of Stephen, inventing absurd little games,
like two children, which games did not always include the real
child. Stephen would sit there silently watching, but her heart
would be a prey to the strangest emotions&mdash;emotions that
seven-years-old could not cope with, and for which it could find no
adequate names. All she would know was that seeing her parents
together in this mood, would fill her with longings for something
that she wanted yet could not define&mdash;a something that would
make her as happy as they were. And this something would always be
mixed up with Morton, with grave, stately rooms like her father's
study, with wide views from windows that let in much sunshine, and
the scents of a spacious garden. Her mind would go groping about
for a reason, and would find no reason&mdash;unless it were
Collins&mdash;but Collins would refuse to fit into these pictures;
even love must admit that she did not belong there any more than
the brushes and buckets and slop-cloths belonged in that dignified
study.</p>

<p>Presently Stephen must go off to her tea, leaving the two
grown-up children together; secretly divining that neither of them
would miss her&mdash;not even her father.</p>

<p>Arrived in the nursery she would probably be cross, because her
heart felt very empty and tearful; or because, having looked at
herself in the glass, she had decided that she loathed her abundant
long hair. Snatching at a slice of thick bread and butter, she
would upset the milk jug, or break a new tea-cup, or smear the
front of her dress with her fingers, to the fury of Mrs. Bingham.
If she spoke at such times it was usually to threaten: 'I shall cut
all my hair off, you see if I don't!' or, 'I hate this white dress
and I'm going to bum it&mdash;it makes me feel idiotic!' But once
launched she would dig up the grievances of months, going back to
the time of the would-be young Nelson, loudly complaining that
being a girl spoilt everything&mdash;even Nelson. The rest of the
evening would be spent in grumbling, because one does grumble when
one is unhappy&mdash;at least one does grumble when one is
seven&mdash;later on it may seem rather useless.</p>

<p>At last the hour of the bath would arrive, and still grumbling,
Stephen must submit to Mrs. Bingham, fidgeting under the nurse's
rough fingers like a dog in the hands of a trimmer. There she would
stand pretending to shiver, a strong little figure, narrow-hipped
and wide-shouldered; her flanks as wiry and thin as a greyhound's
and even more ceaselessly restless.</p>

<p>'God doesn't use soap!' she might suddenly remark.</p>

<p>At which Mrs. Bingham must smile, none too kindly: 'Maybe not,
Miss Stephen&mdash;He don't 'ave to wash you; if He did He'd need
plenty of soap, I'll be bound!'</p>

<p>The bath over, and Stephen garbed in her nightgown, a long pause
would ensue, known as: 'Waiting for Mother', and if mother, for
some reason, did not happen to arrive, the pause could be spun out
for quite twenty minutes, or for half an hour even, if luck was
with Stephen, and the nursery clock not too precise and
old-maidish.</p>

<p>'Now come on, say your prayers,' Mrs. Bingham would order, 'and
you'd better ask the dear Lord to forgive you&mdash;impious I calls
it, and you a young lady! Carrying on because you can't be a
boy!'</p>

<p>Stephen would kneel by the side of the bed, but in such moods as
these her prayers would sound angry. The nurse would protest: 'Not
so loud, Miss Stephen! Pray slower, and don't shout at the Lord, He
won't like it!'</p>

<p>But Stephen would continue to shout at the Lord in a kind of
impotent defiance.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter Four</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>The sorrows of childhood are mercifully passing, for it is only
when maturity has rendered soil mellow that grief will root very
deeply. Stephen's grief for Collins, in spite of its violence, or
perhaps because of that very violence, wore itself out like a
passing tempest and was all but spent by the autumn. By Christmas,
the gusts when they came were quite gentle, rousing nothing more
disturbing than a faint melancholy&mdash;by Christmas it required
quite an effort to recapture the charm of Collins.</p>

<p>Stephen was nonplussed and rather uneasy; to have loved so
greatly and now to forget! It made her feel childish and horribly
silly, as though she had cried over cutting her finger. As on all
grave occasions, she considered the Lord, remembering His love for
miserable sinners:</p>

<p>Teach me to love Collins Your way,' prayed Stephen, trying hard
to squeeze out some tears in the process, 'teach me to love her
'cause she's mean and unkind and won't be a proper sinner that
repenteth.' But the tears would not come, nor was prayer what it
had been; it lacked something&mdash;she no longer sweated when she
prayed.</p>

<p>Then an awful thing happened, the maid's image was fading, and
try as she would Stephen could not recall certain passing
expressions that had erstwhile allured her. Now she could not see
Collins' face at all dearly even if she willed very hard in the
dark. Thoroughly disgruntled, she bethought her of books, books of
fairy tales, hitherto not much in favour, especially of those that
treated of spells, incantations and other unlawful proceedings. She
even requested the surprised Mrs. Bingham to read from the
Bible:</p>

<p>'You know where,' coaxed Stephen, 'it's the place they were
reading in church last Sunday, about Saul and a witch with a name
like Edna&mdash;the place where she makes some person come up,
'cause the king had forgotten what he looked like.'</p>

<p>But if prayer bad failed Stephen, her spells also failed her;
indeed they behaved as spells do when said backwards, making her
see, not the person she wished to, but a creature entirely
different. For Collins now had a most serious rival, one who had
lately appeared at the stables. He was not possessed of a real
housemaid's knee, but instead, of four deeply thrilling brown
legs&mdash;he was two up on legs and one up on a tail, which was
rather unfair on Collins! that Christmas, when Stephen was eight
years old, Sir Philip had bought her a hefty bay pony; she was
learning to ride him, could ride him already, being naturally
skilful and fearless. There had been quite a heated discussion with
Anna, because Stephen had insisted on riding astride. In this she
had shown herself very refractory, falling off every time she tried
the side-saddle&mdash;quite obvious, of course, this falling-off
process, but enough to subjugate Anna.</p>

<p>And now Stephen would spend long hours at the stables,
swaggering largely in corduroy breeches, hobnobbing with Williams,
the old stud groom, who had a soft place in his heart for the
child.</p>

<p>She would say: 'Come up, horse!' in the same tone as Williams;
or, pretending to a knowledge she was far from possessing: 'Is that
fetlock a bit puffy? It looks to me puffy; supposing we put on a
nice wet bandage.'</p>

<p>Then Williams would rub his rough chin as though thinking:
'Maybe yes&mdash;maybe no&mdash;' he would temporize, wisely.</p>

<p>She grew to adore the smell of the stables; it was far more
enticing than Collins' perfume&mdash;the Erasmic she had used on
her afternoons out, and which had once smelt so delicious. And the
pony! So strong, so entirely fulfilling, with his round, gentle
eyes, and his heart big with courage&mdash;he was surely more
worthy of worship than Collins, who had treated you badly because
of the footman! And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;you owed something to
Collins, just because you had loved her, though you couldn't any
more. It was dreadfully worrying, all this hard thinking, when you
wished to enjoy a new pony! Stephen would stand there rubbing her
chin in an almost exact imitation of Williams. She could not
produce the same scrabby sound, but in spite of this drawback, the
movement would soothe her.</p>

<p>Then one morning she had a bright inspiration: 'Come up, horse!'
she commanded, slapping the pony. 'Come up, horse, and let me get
close to your ear, 'cause I'm going to whisper something dreadfully
important.' Laying her cheek against his firm neck, she said
softly: 'You're not you any more, you're Collins!'</p>

<p>So Collins was comfortably transmigrated. It was Stephen's last
effort to remember.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Came the day when Stephen rode out with her father to a meet, a
glorious and memorable day. Side by side the two of them jogged
through the gates, and the lodgekeeper's wife must smile to see
Stephen sitting her smart bay pony astride, and looking so
comically like Sir Philip.</p>

<p>'It do be a pity as her isn't a boy, our young lady,' she told
her husband.</p>

<p>It was one of those still, slightly frosty mornings when the
landing is tricky on the north side of the hedges; when the smoke
from farm chimneys rises straight as a ramrod; when the scent of
log fires or of burning brushwood, though left far behind, still
persists in the nostrils. A crystal clear morning, like a draught
of spring water, and such mornings are good when one is young.</p>

<p>The pony tugged hard and fought at his bridle; he was trembling
with pleasure, for he was no novice; he knew all about signs and
wonders in stables, such as large feeds of corn administered early,
and extra long groomings, and pink coats, with brass buttons, like
the hunt coat Sir Philip was wearing. He frisked down the road, a
mass of affectation, demanding some skill on the part of his rider;
but the child's hands were strong yet exceedingly gentle&mdash;she
possessed that rare gift, perfect hands on a horse.</p>

<p>'This is better than being young Nelson,' thought Stephen,
''cause this way I'm happy just being myself.'</p>

<p>Sir Philip looked down at his daughter with contentment; she was
good to look upon, he decided. And yet his contentment was not
quite complete, so that he looked away again quickly, sighing a
little, because, somehow these days, he had taken to sighing over
Stephen.</p>

<p>The meet was a large one. People noticed the child; Colonel
Antrim, the Master, rode up and spoke kindly: 'You've a fine pony
there, but he'll need a bit of holding!' And then to her father:
'Is she safe astride, Philip? Violet's learning to ride, but
side-saddle, I prefer it&mdash;I never think girl children get the
grip astride; they aren't built for it, haven't the necessary
muscle; still, no doubt she'll stick on by balance.'</p>

<p>Stephen flushed: 'No doubt she'll stick on by balance!' the
words rankled, oh, very deeply they rankled. Violet was learning to
ride side-saddle, that small, flabby lump who squealed if you
pinched her; that terrified creature of muslins and ribbons and
hair that curled over the nurse's finger! Why, Violet could never
come to tea without crying, could never play a game without getting
herself hurt! She had fat, wobbly legs too, just like a rag
doll&mdash;and you, Stephen, had been compared to Violet!
Ridiculous of course, and yet all of a sudden you felt less
impressive in your fine riding breeches. You felt&mdash;well, not
foolish exactly, but self-conscious&mdash;not quite at your ease, a
little bit wrong. It was almost as though you were playing at young
Nelson again, were only pretending.</p>

<p>But you said: 'I've got muscles, haven't I, Father? Williams
says I've got riding muscles already!' then you dug your heels
sharply into the pony, so that he whisked round, bucking and
rearing. As for you, you stuck to his back like a limpet. Wasn't
that enough to convince them?</p>

<p>'Steady on, Stephen!' came Sir Philip's voice, warning. Then the
Master's: 'She's got a fine seat, I'll admit it&mdash;Violet's a
little bit scared on a horse, but I think she'll get confidence
later; I hope so.'</p>

<p>And now hounds were moving away towards cover, tails
waving&mdash;they looked like an army with banners. 'Hi,
Starbright&mdash;Fancy! Get in, little bitch! Hi, Frolic, get on
with it, Frolic!'</p>

<p>The long lashes shot out with amazing precision, stinging a
flank or stroking a shoulder, while the four-legged Amazons closed
up their ranks for the serious business ahead. 'Hi, Starbright!'
Whips cracked and horses grew restless; Stephen's mount required
undivided attention. She had no time to think of her muscles or her
grievance, but only of the creature between her small knees.</p>

<p>'All right, Stephen?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Father.'</p>

<p>Well, go steady at your fences; it may be a little bit slippery
this morning.' But Sir Philip's voice did not sound at all anxious;
indeed there was a note of deep pride in his voice.</p>

<p>'He knows that I'm not just a rag doll, like Violet; he knows
that I'm different to her!' thought Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The strange, implacable heart-broken music of hounds giving
tongue as they break from cover; the cry of the huntsman as he
stands in his stirrups; the thud of hooves pounding ruthlessly
forward over long, green, undulating meadows. The meadows flying
back as though seen from a train, the meadows streaming away behind
you; the acrid smell of horse sweat caught in passing; the smell of
damp leather, of earth and bruised herbage&mdash;all sudden, all
passing&mdash;then the smell of wide spaces, the air smell, cool
yet as potent as wine.</p>

<p>Sir Philip was looking back over his shoulder: 'All right,
Stephen?' Oh, yes&mdash;' Stephen's voice sounded breathless.</p>

<p>Steady on! Steady on!'</p>

<p>They were coming to a fence, and Stephen's grip tightened a
little. The pony took the fence in his stride very gaily; for an
instant he seemed to stay poised in mid-air as though he had wings,
then he touched earth again, and away without even pausing.</p>

<p>'All right, Stephen?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes!'</p>

<p>Sir Philip's broad back was bent forward over the shoulder of
his hunter; the crisp auburn hair in the nape of his neck showed
bright where the winter sunshine touched it; and as the child
followed that purposeful back, she felt that she loved it utterly,
entirely. At that moment it seemed to embody all kindness, all
strength, and all understanding.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>They killed not so very far from Worcester; it had been a stiff
run, the best of the season. Colonel Antrim came jogging along to
Stephen, whose prowess had amused and surprised him.</p>

<p>'Well, well,' he said, grinning, 'so here you are, madam, still
with a leg on each side of your horse&mdash;I'm going to tell
Violet she'll have to buck up. By the way, Philip, can Stephen come
to tea on Monday, before Roger goes back to school? She can? Oh,
splendid! And now where's that brush? I think our young Stephen
here takes it.'</p>

<p>Strange it is, but unforgettable moments are often connected
with very small happenings, happenings that assume fictitious
proportions, especially when we are children. If Colonel Antrim had
offered Stephen the crown of England on a red velvet cushion, it is
doubtful whether her pride would have equalled the pride that she
felt when the huntsman came forward and presented her with her
first hunting trophy&mdash;the rather pathetic, bedraggled little
brush, that had weathered so many hard miles. Just for an instant
the child's heart misgave her, as she looked at the soft, furry
thing in her hand; but the joy of attainment was still hot upon
her, and that incomparable feeling of elation that comes from the
knowledge of personal courage, so that she forgot the woes of the
fox in remembering the prowess of Stephen.</p>

<p>Sir Philip fastened the brush to her saddle. 'You rode well,' he
said briefly, then turned to the Master.</p>

<p>But she knew that that day she had not failed him, for his eyes
had been bright when they rested on hers; she had seen great love
in those melancholy eyes, together with a curiously wistful
expression of which her youth lacked understanding. And now many
people smiled broadly at Stephen, patting her pony and calling him
a flier.</p>

<p>One old farmer remarked: ''E do be a good plucked un, and so be
'is rider&mdash;beggin' your pardon.'</p>

<p>At which Stephen must blush and grow slightly mendacious,
pretending to give all the credit to the pony, pretending to feel
very humble of spirit, which she knew she was far from feeling.</p>

<p>'Come along!' called Sir Philip. 'No more to-day, Stephen, your
poor little fellow's had enough for one day.' Which was true, since
Collins was all of a tremble, what with excitement and straining
short legs to keep up with vainglorious hunters.</p>

<p>Whips touched hats: 'Good-bye, Stephen, come out soon
again&mdash;See you on Tuesday, Sir Philip, with the Croome.' And
the field settled down to the changing of horses, before drawing
yet one more cover.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Father and daughter rode home through the twilight, and now
there were no dog-roses in the hedges, the hedges stood leafless
and grey with frost rime, a network of delicate branches. The earth
smelt as clean as a newly washed garment&mdash;it smelt of 'God's
washing', as Stephen called it&mdash;while away to the left, from a
distant farm-house, came the sound of a yard-dog, barking. Small
lights were glowing in cottage windows as yet uncurtained, as yet
very friendly; and beyond, where the great hills of Malvern showed
blue against the pale sky, many small lights were
burning&mdash;lights of home newly lit on the altar of the hills to
the God of both hills and homesteads. No birds were singing in the
trees by the roadside, but a silence prevailed, more lovely than
bird song; the thoughtful and holy silence of winter, the silence
of trustfully waiting furrows. For the soil is the greatest saint
of all ages, knowing neither impatience, nor fear, nor doubting;
knowing only faith, from which spring all blessings that are
needful to nurture man.</p>

<p>Sir Philip said: 'Are you happy, my Stephen?'</p>

<p>And she answered: 'I'm dreadfully happy, Father. I'm so
dreadfully happy that it makes me feel frightened, 'cause I mayn't
always last happy&mdash;not this way.'</p>

<p>He did not ask why she might not last happy; he just nodded, as
though he admitted a reason; but he laid his hand over hers on the
bridle for a moment, a large, and comforting hand. Then the peace
of the evening took possession of Stephen, that and the peace of a
healthy body tired out with fresh air and much vigorous movement,
so that she swayed a little in her saddle and came near to falling
asleep. The pony, even more tired than his rider, jogged along with
neck drooping and reins hanging slackly, too weary to shy at the
ogreish shadows that were crouching ready to scare him. His small
mind was doubtless concentrated on fodder; on the bucket of water
nicely seasoned with gruel; on the groom's soothing hiss as he
rubbed down and bandaged; on the warm blanket clothing, so pleasant
in winter, and above all on that golden bed of deep straw that was
sure to be waiting in his stable.</p>

<p>And now a great moon had swung up very slowly; and the moon
seemed to pause, staring hard at Stephen, while the frost rime
turned white with the whiteness of diamonds, and the shadows turned
black and lay folded like velvet round the feet of the drowsy
hedges. But the meadows beyond the hedges turned silver, and so did
the road to Morton.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>It was late when they reached the stables at last, and old
Williams was waiting in the yard with a lantern.</p>

<p>'Did you kill?' he inquired, according to custom; then he saw
Stephen's trophy and chuckled.</p>

<p>Stephen tried to spring easily out of the saddle as her father
had done, but her legs seemed to fail her. To her horror and
chagrin her legs hung down stiffly as though made of wood; she
could not control them; and to make matters worse, Collins now grew
impatient and began to walk off to his loose-box. Then Sir Philip
put two strong arms around Stephen, and he lifted her bodily as
though she were a baby, and he carried her, only faintly
protesting, right up to the door of the house and beyond
it&mdash;right up indeed, to the warm pleasant nursery where a
steaming hot bath was waiting. Her head fell back and lay on his
shoulder, while her eyelids drooped, heavy with well-earned sleep;
she had to blink very hard several times over in order to get the
better of that sleep.</p>

<p>'Happy, darling?' he whispered, and his grave face bent nearer.
She could feel his cheek, rough at the end of the day, pressed
against her forehead, and she loved that kind roughness, so that
she put up her hand and stroked it.</p>

<p>So dreadfully, dreadfully happy, Father,' she murmured,
'so&mdash;dreadfully happy&mdash;'</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter Five</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>On the Monday that followed Stephen's first day out hunting she
woke with something very like a weight on her chest; in less than
two minutes she knew why this was&mdash;she was going to tea with
the Antrims. Her relations with other children were peculiar, she
thought so herself and so did the children; they could not define
it and neither could Stephen, but there it was all the same. A
high-spirited child she should have been popular, and yet she was
not, a fact which she divined, and this made her feel ill at ease
with her playmates, who in their turn felt ill at ease. She would
think that the children were whispering about her, whispering and
laughing for no apparent reason; but although this had happened on
one occasion, it was not always happening as Stephen imagined. She
was painfully hyper-sensitive at times, and she suffered
accordingly.</p>

<p>Of all the children that Stephen most dreaded, Violet and Roger
Antrim took precedence; especially Roger, who was ten years old,
and already full to the neck of male arrogance&mdash;he had just
been promoted to Etons that winter, which added to his overbearing
pride. Roger Antrim had round, brown eyes like his mother, and a
short, straight nose that might one day be handsome; he was rather
a thick-set, plump little boy, whose buttocks looked too large in a
short Eton jacket, especially when he stuck his hands in his
pockets and strutted, which he did very often.</p>

<p>Roger was a bully; he bullied his sister, and would dearly have
loved to bully Stephen; but Stephen nonplussed him, her arms were
so strong, he could never wrench Stephen's arms backwards like
Violet's; he could never make her cry or show any emotion when he
pinched her, or tugged roughly at her new hair ribbon, and then
Stephen would often beat him at games, a fact which he deeply
resented. She could bowl at cricket much straighter than he could;
she climbed trees with astonishing skill and prowess, and even if
she did tear her skirts in the process it was obviously cheek for a
girl to climb at all. Violet never climbed trees; she stood at the
bottom admiring the courage of Roger. He grew to hate Stephen as a
kind of rival, a kind of intruder into his especial province; he
was always longing to take her down a peg, but being slow-witted he
was foolish in his methods&mdash;no good daring Stephen, she
responded at once, and usually went one better. As for Stephen, she
loathed him, and her loathing was increased by a most humiliating
consciousness of envy. Yes, despite his shortcomings she envied
young Roger with his thick, clumping boots, his cropped hair and
his Etons; envied his school and his masculine companions of whom
he would speak grandly as: 'all the other fellows!'; envied his
right to climb trees and play cricket and football&mdash;his right
to be perfectly natural; above all she envied his splendid
conviction that being a boy constituted a privilege in life; she
could well understand that conviction, but this only increased her
envy.</p>

<p>Stephen found Violet intolerably silly, she cried quite as
loudly when she bumped her own head as when Roger applied his most
strenuous torments. But what irritated Stephen, was the fact that
she suspected that Violet almost enjoyed those torments.</p>

<p>'He's so dreadfully strong!' she had confided in Stephen, with
something like pride in her voice.</p>

<p>Stephen had longed to shake her for that: 'I can pinch quite as
hard as he can!' she had threatened. 'If you think he's stronger
than I am, I'll show you!' At which Violet had rushed away
screaming.</p>

<p>Violet was already full of feminine poses; she loved dolls, but
not quite so much as she pretended. People said: 'Look at Violet,
she's like a little mother; it's so touching to see that instinct
in a child!' then Violet would become still more touching. She was
always thrusting her dolls upon Stephen, making her undress them
and put them to bed. 'Now you're Nanny, Stephen, and I'm Gertrude's
mother, or you can be mother this time if you'd rather&mdash;Oh, be
careful, you'll break her! Now you've pulled off a button! I do
think you might play more like I do!' And then Violet knitted, or
said that she knitted&mdash;Stephen had never seen anything but
knots. 'Can't you knit?' she would say, looking scornfully at
Stephen, 'I can&mdash;Mother called me a dear little housewife!'
then Stephen would lose her temper and speak rudely: 'You're a dear
little sop, that's what you are!' For hours she must play stupid
doll-games with Violet, because Roger would not always play real
games in the garden. He hated to be beaten, yet how could she help
it? Could she help throwing straighter than Roger?</p>

<p>They had nothing whatever in common, these children, but the
Antrims were neighbours, and even Sir Philip; indulgent though he
was, insisted that Stephen should have friends of her own age to
play with. He had spoken quite sharply on several occasions when
the child had pleaded to be allowed to stay at home. Indeed he
spoke sharply that very day at luncheon:</p>

<p>'Eat your pudding please, Stephen; come now, finish it quickly!
If all this fuss is about the little Antrims, then Father won't
have it, it's ridiculous, darling.'</p>

<p>So Stephen had hastily swallowed her pudding and escaped
upstairs to the nursery.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The Antrims lived half a mile from Ledbury, on the other side of
the hills. It was quite a long drive to their house from
Morton&mdash;Stephen was driven over in the dog-cart. She sat
beside Williams in gloomy silence, with the collar of her coat
turned up to her ears. She was filled with a sense of bitter
injustice; why should they insist on this stupid expedition? Even
her father had been cross at luncheon because she preferred to stay
at home with him. Why should she be forced to know other children?
they didn't want her nor she them. And above all the Antrims! that
idiotic Violet&mdash;Violet who was learning to ride
side-saddle&mdash;and Roger strutting about in his Etons, and
bragging, always bragging because he was a boy&mdash;and their
mother who was quite sure to patronize Stephen because being
grown-up made her put on a manner. Stephen could hear her
infuriating voice, the voice she reserved for children: Ah, here
you are, Stephen! Now then, little people, run along and have a
good feed in the schoolroom. There's plenty of cake; I knew Stephen
was coining; we all know Stephen's capacity for cake!'</p>

<p>Stephen could hear Violet's timorous giggle and Roger's guffaw
as they greeted this sally. She could feel his fat fingers pinching
her arm; pinching cruelly, slyly, as he strutted beside her. Then
his whisper: 'You're a pig! You eat much more than I do, mother
said so today, and boys need more than girls!' then Violet: 'I'm
not very fond of plum cake, it makes me feel sicky&mdash;mother
says it's indigestion. I could never eat big bits of plum cake like
Stephen. Nanny says I'm a dainty feeder.' then Stephen herself,
saying nothing at all, but glaring sideways at Roger.</p>

<p>The dog-cart was slowly climbing British Camp, that long, steep
hill out of Little Malvern. The cold air grew colder, but
marvellously pure it was, up there above the valleys. The peak of
the Camp stood out clearly defined by snow that had fallen lightly
that morning, and as they breasted the crest of the hill, the sun
shone out on the snow. Away to the right lay the valley of the Wye,
a long, lovely valley of deep blue shadows; a valley of small
homesteads and mothering trees, of soft undulations and wide,
restful spaces leading away to a line of dim
mountains&mdash;leading away to the mountains of Wales, that lay
just over the border. And because she loved this kind of English
valley, Stephen's sulky eyes must turn and rest upon it; not all
her apprehension and sense of injustice could take from her eyes
the joy of that seeing. She must gaze and gaze, she must let it
possess her, the peace, the wonder that lay in such beauty; while
the unwilling tears welled up under her lids&mdash;she not knowing
why they had come there.</p>

<p>And now they were trotting swiftly downhill; the valley had
vanished, but the woods of Eastnor stood naked and lovely, and the
forms of their trees were more perfect than forms that are made
with hands&mdash;unless with the hands of God. Stephen's eyes
turned again; she could not stay sulky, for these were the woods
where she drove with her father. Twice every spring they drove up
to these woods and through them to the stretching parkland beyond.
There were deer in the park&mdash;they would sometimes get out of
the dog-cart so that Stephen could feed the does.</p>

<p>She began to whistle softly through her teeth, an accomplishment
in which she took a great pride. Impossible to go on feeling
resentful when the sun was shining between the bare branches, when
the air was as clear and as bright as crystal, when the cob was
literally flying through the air, taking all Williams' strength to
hold him.</p>

<p>Steady boy&mdash;steady on! He be feeling the weather&mdash;gets
into his blood and makes him that skittish&mdash;Now go quiet, you
young blight! Just look at him, will you, he's got himself all of a
lather!'</p>

<p>'Let me drive,' pleaded. Stephen. 'Oh, please, <i>please</i>,
Williams!'</p>

<p>But Williams shook his head as he grinned at her broadly: 'I've
got old bones, Miss Stephen, and old bones breaks quick when it's
frosty, so I've heard tell.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Mrs. Antrim was waiting for Stephen in the lounge&mdash;she was
always waiting to waylay her in the lounge, or so it appeared to
Stephen. The lounge was a much overdressed apartment, full of
small, useless tables and large, clumsy chairs. You bumped into the
chairs and tripped over the tables; at least you did if you were
Stephen. There was one deadly pitfall you never could avoid, a huge
polar bear skin that lay on the floor. Its stuffed head protruded
at a most awkward angle; you invariably stubbed your big toe on
that head. Stephen, true to tradition, stubbed her toe rather badly
as she blundered towards Mrs. Antrim.</p>

<p>'Dear me,' remarked her hostess, 'you are a great girl; why your
feet must be double the size of Violet's! Come here and let me have
a look at your feet.' then she laughed as though something amused
her.</p>

<p>Stephen was longing to rub her big toe, but she thought better
of it, enduring in silence.</p>

<p>'Children!' called Mrs. Antrim, 'Here's Stephen, I'm sure she's
as hungry as a hunter!'</p>

<p>Violet was wearing a pale blue silk frock; even at seven she was
vain of her appearance. She had cried until she had got permission
to wear that particular pale blue frock, which was usually reserved
for parties. Her brown hair was curled into careful ringlets, and
tied with a very large bow of blue ribbon. Mrs. Antrim glanced
quickly from Stephen to Violet with a look of maternal pride.</p>

<p>Roger was bulging inside his Etons; his round cheeks were
puffed, very pink and aggressive. He eyed Stephen coldly from above
a white collar that was obviously fresh from the laundry. On their
way upstairs he pinched Stephen's leg, and Stephen kicked
backwards, swiftly and neatly.</p>

<p>'I suppose you think you can kick!' grunted Roger, who was
suffering acutely at that moment from his shin. You've not got the
strength of a flea; I don't feel it!'</p>

<p>At Violet's request they were left alone for tea; she liked
playing the hostess, and her mother spoilt her. A special small
teapot had had to be unearthed, in order that Violet could lift
it.</p>

<p>'Sugar?' she inquired with tongs poised in mid air, '<i>And</i>
milk?' she added, imitating her mother. Mrs. Antrim always said:
<i>And</i> milk,' in that tone&mdash;it made you feel that you must
be rather greedy.</p>

<p>'Oh, chuck it!' growled Roger, whose shin was still aching. You
know I want milk and four lumps of sugar.'</p>

<p>Violet's underlip began to tremble, but she held her ground with
unexpected firmness. 'May I give you a little more milk, Stephen
dear? Or would you prefer no milk, only lemon?'</p>

<p>There isn't any lemon and you know it!' bawled Roger. 'Here,
give me my tea or I'll spoil your hair ribbon.' He grabbed at his
cup and nearly upset it.</p>

<p>'Oh, oh!' shrilled Violet. 'My dress!'</p>

<p>They settled down to the meal at last, but Stephen observed that
Roger was watching; every mouthful she ate she could feel him
watching, so that she grew self-conscious. She was hungry, not
having eaten much luncheon, but now she could not enjoy her cake;
Roger himself was stuffing like a grampus, but his eyes never left
her face. Then Roger, the slow-witted in his dealings with Stephen,
all but choked in the throes of a great inspiration.</p>

<p>'I say, <i>you</i>,' he began, with his mouth very full, 'what
about a certain young lady out hunting? What about a fat leg on
each side of her horse like a monkey on a stick, and everybody
laughing!'</p>

<p>'They were not!' exclaimed Stephen, growing suddenly red. 'Oh,
yes, but they were, though!' mocked Roger.</p>

<p>Now had Stephen been wise she would have let the thing drop, for
no fun is derived from a one-sided contest, but at eight years old
one is not always wise, and moreover her pride had been stung to
the quick.</p>

<p>She said: 'I'd like to see you get the brush; why you can't
stick on just riding round the paddock! I've seen you fall off,
jumping nothing but a hurdle; I'd like to see you out hunting!'</p>

<p>Roger swallowed some more cake; there was now no great hurry; he
had thrown his sprat and had landed his mackerel. He had very much
feared that she might not be drawn&mdash;it was not always easy to
draw Stephen.</p>

<p>'Well now, listen,' he drawled, 'and I'll tell you something.
You thought they admired you squatting on your pony; you thought
you were being very grand, I'll bet, with your new riding breeches
and your black velvet cap; you thought they'd suppose that you
looked like a boy, just because you were trying to be one. As a
matter of fact, if you really want to know, they were busting their
sides; why, my father said so. He was laughing all the time at your
looking so funny on that rotten old pony that's as fat as a
porpoise. Why, he only gave you the brush for fun, because you were
such a small kid&mdash;he said so. He said: "I gave Stephen Gordon
the brush because I thought she might cry if I didn't."'</p>

<p>'You're a liar,' breathed Stephen, who had turned very pale.</p>

<p>'Oh, am I? Well, you ask father.'</p>

<p>'Do stop&mdash;' whimpered Violet, beginning to cry; 'you're
horrid, you're spoiling my party.'</p>

<p>But Roger was launched on his first perfect triumph; he had seen
the expression in Stephen's eyes: 'And my mother said,' he
continued more loudly, that your mother must be funny to allow you
to do it; she said it was horrid to let girls ride that way; she
said she was awfully surprised at your mother; she said that she'd
have thought that your mother had more sense; she said that it
wasn't modest; she said&mdash;'</p>

<p>Stephen had suddenly sprung to her feet: 'How dare you! How dare
you&mdash;my mother!' she spluttered. And now she was almost beside
herself with rage, conscious only of one overwhelming impulse, and
that to belabour Roger.</p>

<p>A plate crashed to the ground and Violet screamed faintly.
Roger, in his turn, had pushed back his chair; his round eyes were
staring and rather frightened; he had never seen Stephen quite like
this before. She was actually rolling up the sleeves of her
smock.</p>

<p>'You cad!' she shouted, 'I'll fight you for this!' And she
doubled her fist and shook it at Roger while he edged away from the
table.</p>

<p>She stood there an enraged and ridiculous figure in her Liberty
smock, with her hard, boyish forearms. Her long hair had partly
escaped from its ribbon, and the bow sagged down limply, crooked
and foolish. All that was heavy in her face sprang into view, the
strong line of the jaw, the square, massive brow, the eyebrows, too
thick and too wide for beauty. And yet there was a kind of large
splendour about her&mdash;absurd though she was, she was splendid
at that moment&mdash;grotesque and splendid, like some primitive
thing conceived in a turbulent age of transition.</p>

<p>'Are you going to fight me, you coward?' she demanded, as she
stepped round the table and faced her tormentor.</p>

<p>But Roger thrust his hands deep into his pockets: 'I don't fight
with girls!' he remarked very grandly. Then he sauntered out of the
schoolroom.</p>

<p>Stephen's own hands fell and hung at her sides; her head
drooped, and she stood staring down at the carpet. The whole of her
suddenly drooped and looked helpless, as she stood staring down at
the carpet.</p>

<p>'How could you!' began Violet, who was plucking up courage.
'Little girls don't have fights&mdash;I don't, I'd be
frightened&mdash;'</p>

<p>But Stephen cut her short: 'I'm going,' she said thickly; 'I'm
going home to my father.'</p>

<p>She went heavily downstairs and out into the lobby, where she
put on her hat and coat; then made her way round the house to the
stables, in search of old Williams and the dog-cart.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>'You're home very early, Stephen,' said Anna, but Sir Philip was
staring at his daughter's face.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' he inquired, and his voice sounded anxious.
'Come here and tell me about it.'</p>

<p>Then Stephen quite suddenly burst into tears, and she wept and
she wept as she stood there before them, and she poured out her
shame and humiliation, telling all that Roger had said about her
mother, telling all that she, Stephen, would have done to defend
her, had it not been that Roger would not fight with a girl. She
wept and she wept without any restraint, scarcely knowing what she
said&mdash;at that moment not caring. And Sir Philip listened with
his head on his hand, and Anna listened bewildered and dumbfounded.
She tried to kiss Stephen, to hold her to her, but Stephen, still
sobbing, pushed her away; in this orgy of grief she resented
consolation, so that in the end Anna took her to the nursery and
delivered her over to the care of Mrs. Bingham, feeling that the
child did not want her.</p>

<p>When Anna went quietly back to the study, Sir Philip was still
sitting with his head on his hand. She said: 'It's time you
realized, Philip, that if you're Stephen's father, I'm her mother.
So far you've managed the child your own way, and I don't think
it's been successful. You've treated Stephen as though she were a
boy&mdash;perhaps it's because I've not given you a son&mdash;' Her
voice trembled a little but she went on gravely: 'It's not good for
Stephen; I know it's not good, and at times it frightens me,
Philip.'</p>

<p>'No, no!' he said, sharply.</p>

<p>But Anna persisted: 'Yes, Philip, at times it makes me
afraid&mdash;I can't tell you why, but it seems all wrong&mdash;it
makes me feel&mdash;strange with the child.'</p>

<p>He looked at her out of his melancholy eyes: 'Can't you trust
me? Won't you try to trust me, Anna?'</p>

<p>But Anna shook her head: 'I don't understand, why shouldn't you
trust me, Philip?'</p>

<p>And then in his terror for this well-beloved woman, Sir Philip
committed the first cowardly action of his life&mdash;he who would
not have spared himself pain, could not bear to inflict it on Anna.
In his infinite pity for Stephen's mother, he sinned very deeply
and gravely against Stephen, by withholding from that mother his
own conviction that her child was not as other children.</p>

<p>'There's nothing for you to understand,' he said firmly, 'but I
like you to trust me in all things.'</p>

<p>After this they sat talking about the child, Sir Philip very
quiet and reassuring.</p>

<p>'I've wanted her to have a healthy body,' he explained, 'that's
why I've let her run more or less wild; but perhaps we'd better
have a governess now, as you say; a French governess, my dear, if
you'd prefer one&mdash;later on I've always meant to engage a
bluestocking, some woman who's been to Oxford. I want Stephen to
have the finest education that care and money can give her.'</p>

<p>But once again Anna began to protest. 'What's the good of it all
for a girl?' she argued. 'Did you love me any less because I
couldn't do mathematics? Do you love me less now because I count on
my fingers?'</p>

<p>He kissed her. 'That's different, you're you,' he said, smiling,
but a look that she knew well had come into his eyes, a cold,
resolute expression, which meant that all persuasion was likely to
be unavailing.</p>

<p>Presently they went upstairs to the nursery, and Sir Philip
shaded the candle with his hand, while they stood together gazing
down at Stephen&mdash;the child was heavily asleep.</p>

<p>'Look, Philip,' whispered Anna, pitiful and shaken, 'look
Philip&mdash;she's got two big tears on her cheek!'</p>

<p>He nodded, slipping his arm around Anna: 'Come away,' he
muttered, 'we may wake her.'</p>

<h3><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter Six</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Mrs. Bingham departed unmourned and unmourning, and in her stead
reigned Mademoiselle Duphot, a youthful French governess with a
long, pleasant face that reminded Stephen of a horse. This equine
resemblance was fortunate in one way&mdash;Stephen took to
Mademoiselle Duphot at once&mdash;but it did not make for
respectful obedience. On the contrary, Stephen felt very familiar,
kindly familiar and quite at her ease; she petted Mademoiselle
Duphot. Mademoiselle Duphot was lonely and homesick, and it must be
admitted that she liked being petted. Stephen would rush off to get
her a cushion, or a footstool or her glass of milk at eleven.</p>

<p>'Comme elle est gentille, cette dr&ocirc;le de petite fine, elle
a si bon coeur,' would think Mademoiselle Duphot, and somehow
geography would not seem to matter quite so much, or arithmetic
either&mdash;in vain did Mademoiselle try to be strict, her pupil
could always beguile her.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duphot knew nothing about horses, in spite of the r
fact that she looked so much like one, and Stephen would
complacently entertain her with long conversation anent splints and
spavins, cow hocks and colic, all mixed up together in a kind of
wild veterinary jumble. Had Williams been listening, he might well
have rubbed his chin, but Williams was not there to listen.</p>

<p>As for Mademoiselle Duphot, she was genuinely impressed: 'Mais
quel type, quel type!' she was always exclaiming. 'Vous &ecirc;tes
d&eacute;j&agrave; une vraie petite Amazone, St&eacute;venne.'</p>

<p>'N'est-ce pas?' agreed Stephen, who was picking up French.</p>

<p>The child showed real ability for French, and this delighted her
teacher; at the end of six months she could gabble quite freely,
making quick little gestures and shrugging her shoulders. She liked
talking French, it rather amused her, nor was she averse to
mastering the grammar; what she could not endure were the long,
foolish dict&eacute;es from the edifying Biblioth&egrave;que Rose.
Weak in all other respects with Stephen, Mademoiselle Duphot clung
to these dict&eacute;es; the Biblioth&egrave;que Rose became her
last trench of authority, and she held it.</p>

<p>'"Les Petites Filles Mod&egrave;les,"' Mademoiselle would
announce, while Stephen yawned out her ineffable boredom;
'Maintenant nous allons retrouver Sophie&mdash;Where to did we
arrive? Ah, oui, I remember: "Cette preuve de confiance toucha
Sophie et augmenta encore son regret d'avoir &eacute;t&eacute; si
m&eacute;chante."</p>

<p>'"Comment, se dit-elle, ai-je pu me livrer a une telle
col&egrave;re? Comment ai-je &eacute;t&eacute; si m&eacute;chante
avec des amies aussi bonnes que celles que j'ai id, et si hardie
envers une personne aussi douce, aussi tendre que Mme. de
Fleurville!"'</p>

<p>From time to time the programme would be varied by extracts of
an even more edifying nature, and 'Les Bons Enfants' would be
chosen for dictation, to the scorn and derision of Stephen.</p>

<p>'<i>La Maman</i>, Donne-lui ton coeur, mon Henri; c'est ce que
to pourras lui dormer de plus agr&eacute;able.</p>

<p>'&mdash;Mon coeur? Dit Henri en d&eacute;boutonnant son habit et
en ouvrant sa chemise. Mais comment faire? il me faudrait un
couteau.' At which Stephen would giggle.</p>

<p>One day she had added a comment of her own in the margin:
'Little beast, he was only shamming!' and Mademoiselle, coming on
this unawares, had been caught in the act of laughing by her pupil.
After which there was naturally less discipline than ever in the
schoolroom, but considerably more friendship.</p>

<p>However, Anna seemed quite contented, since Stephen was becoming
so proficient in French; and observing that his wife looked less
anxious these days, Sir Philip said nothing, biding his time. This
frank, jaunty, slacking on the part of his daughter should be
checked later on he decided. Meanwhile, Stephen grew fond of the
mild-faced Frenchwoman, who in her turn adored the unusual child.
She would confide her troubles to Stephen, those family troubles in
which governesses abound&mdash;her Maman was old and delicate and
needy; her sister had a wicked and spendthrift husband, and now her
sister must make little bags for the grand shops in Paris that paid
very badly, her sister was gradually losing her eyesight through
making those little bead bags for the shops that cared nothing, and
paid very badly. Mademoiselle sent Maman a part of her earnings,
and sometimes, of course, she must help her sister. Her Maman must
have her chicken on Sundays: 'Bon Dieu, il faut vivre&mdash;il faut
manger, au moins&mdash;' And afterwards that chicken came in very
nicely for Petite Marmite, which was made from his carcass and a
few leaves of cabbage&mdash;Maman loved Petite Marmite, the warmth
of it eased her old gums.</p>

<p>Stephen would listen to these long dissertations with patience
and with apparent understanding. She would nod her head wisely:
'Mais c'est dur,' she would comment, 'c'est terriblement dur, la
vie!'</p>

<p>But she never confided her own special troubles, and
Mademoiselle Duphot sometimes wondered about her: 'Est-elle
heureuse, cet &eacute;trange petit &ecirc;tre?' she would wonder.
'Sera-t-elle heureuse plus tard? Qui sait!'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Idleness and peace had reigned in the schoolroom for more than
two years, when ex-Sergeant Smylie sailed over the horizon and
proceeded to announce that he taught gymnastics and fencing. From
that moment peace ceased to reign in the schoolroom, or indeed
anywhere in the house for that matter. In vain did Mademoiselle
Duphot protest that gymnastics and fencing thickened the ankles, in
vain did Anna express disapproval, Stephen merely ignored them and
consulted her father.</p>

<p>'I want to go in for Sandowing,' she informed him, as though
they were discussing a career.</p>

<p>He laughed: 'Sandowing? Well, and how will you start it?' Then
Stephen explained about ex-Sergeant Smylie.</p>

<p>'I see,' nodded Sir Philip, 'you want to learn fencing.'</p>

<p>And how to lift weights with my stomach,' she said quickly.</p>

<p>'Why not with your large front teeth?' he teased her. 'Oh,
well,' he added, there's no harm in fencing or gymnastics
either&mdash;provided, of course, that you don't try to wreck
Morton Hall like a Samson wrecking the house of the Philistines; I
foresee that that might easily happen&mdash;'</p>

<p>Stephen grinned: 'But it mightn't if I cut off my hair! May I
cut off my hair? Oh, do let me, Father!'</p>

<p>'Certainly not, I prefer to risk it,' said Sir Philip, speaking
quite firmly.</p>

<p>Stephen went pounding back to the schoolroom. 'I'm going to
those classes!' she announced in triumph. 'I'm going to be driven
over to Malvern next week; I'm going to begin on Tuesday, and I'm
going to learn fencing so as I can kill your brother-in-law who's a
beast to your sister, I'm going to fight duels for wives in
distress, like men do in Paris, and I'm going to learn how to lift
pianos on my stomach by expanding something&mdash;the diapan
muscles&mdash;and I'm going to cut my hair off!' she mendaciously
concluded, glancing sideways to observe the effect of this
bombshell.</p>

<p>'Bon Dieu, soyez cl&eacute;ment!' breathed Mademoiselle Duphot,
casting her eyes to heaven.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>It was not very long before ex-Sergeant Smylie discovered that
in Stephen he had a star pupil. Some day you ought to make a
champion fencer, if you work really hard at it, Miss,' he told
her.</p>

<p>Stephen did not learn to lift pianos with her stomach, but as
time went on she did become quite an expert gymnast and fencer; and
as Mademoiselle Duphot confided to Anna, it was after all very
charming to watch her, so supple and young and quick in her
movements.</p>

<p>'And she fence like an angel,' said Mademoiselle fondly, 'she
fence now almost as well as she ride.'</p>

<p>Anna nodded. She herself had seen Stephen fencing many times,
and had thought it a fine performance for so young a child, but the
fencing displeased her, so that she found it hard to praise
Stephen.</p>

<p>'I hate all that sort of thing for girls,' she said slowly.</p>

<p>'But she fence like a man, with such power and such grace,'
babbled Mademoiselle Duphot, the tactless.</p>

<p>And now life was full of new interest for Stephen, an interest
that centred entirely in her body. She discovered her body for a
thing to be cherished, a thing of real value since its strength
could rejoice her; and young though she was she cared for her body
with great diligence, bathing it night and morning in dull, tepid
water&mdash;cold baths were forbidden, and hot baths, she had
heard, sometimes weakened the muscles. For gymnastics she wore her
hair in a pigtail, and somehow that pigtail began to intrude on
other occasions. In spite of protests, she always forgot and came
down to breakfast with a neat, shining plait, so that Anna gave in
in the end and said, sighing:</p>

<p>'Have your pigtail do, child, if you feel that you
must&mdash;but I can't say it suits you, Stephen.'</p>

<p>And Mademoiselle Duphot was foolishly loving. Stephen would stop
in the middle of lessons to roll back her sleeves and examine her
muscles; then Mademoiselle Duphot, instead of protesting, would
laugh and admire her absurd little biceps. Stephen's craze for
physical culture increased, and now it began to invade the
schoolroom. Dumbbells appeared in the school-room bookcases, while
half worn-out gym shoes skulked in the corners. Everything went by
the board but this passion of the child's for training her body.
And what must Sir Philip elect to do next, but to write out to
Ireland and purchase a hunter for his daughter to ride&mdash;a
real, thoroughbred hunter. And what must he say but: 'That's one
for young Roger!' So that Stephen found herself comfortably
laughing at the thought of young Roger; and that laugh went a long
way towards healing the wound that had rankled within
her&mdash;perhaps this was why Sir Philip had written out to
Ireland for that thoroughbred hunter.</p>

<p>The hunter, when he came, was grey-coated and slender, and his
eyes were as soft as an Irish morning, and his courage was as
bright as an Irish sunrise, and his heart was as young as the wild
heart of Ireland, but devoted and loyal and eager for service, and
his name was sweet on the tongue as you spoke it&mdash;being
Raftery, after the poet. Stephen loved Raftery and Raftery loved
Stephen. It was love at first sight, and they talked to each other
for hours in his loose box&mdash;not in Irish or English, but in a
quiet language having very few words but many small sounds and many
small movements, which to both of them meant more than words. And
Raftery said: 'I will carry you bravely, I will serve you all the
days of my life.' And she answered: 'I will care for you night and
day, Raftery&mdash;all the days of your life.' Thus Stephen and
Raftery pledged their devotion, alone in his fragrant, hay-scented
stable. And Raftery was five and Stephen was twelve when they
solemnly pledged their devotion.</p>

<p>Never was rider more proud or more happy than Stephen, when
first she and Raftery went a-hunting; and never was youngster more
wise or courageous than Raftery proved himself at his fences; and
never can Bellerophon have thrilled to more daring than did
Stephen, astride of Raftery that day, with the wind in her face and
a fire in her heart that made life a thing of glory. At the very
beginning of the run the fox turned in the direction of Morton,
actually crossing the big north paddock before turning once more
and making for Upton. In the paddock was a mighty, upstanding
hedge, a formidable place concealing timber, and what must they do,
these two young creatures, but go straight at it and get safely
over&mdash;those who saw Raftery fly that hedge could never
afterwards doubt his valour. And when they got home there was Anna
waiting to pat Raftery, because she could not resist him. Because,
being Irish, her hands loved the feel of fine horseflesh under
their delicate fingers&mdash;and because she did very much want to
be tender to Stephen, and understanding. But as Stephen dismounted,
bespattered and dishevelled, and yet with that perversive look of
her father, the words that Anna had been planning to speak died
away before they could get themselves spoken&mdash;she shrank back
from the child; but the child was too overjoyed at that moment to
perceive it.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Happy days, splendid days of childish achievements; but they
passed all too soon, giving place to the seasons, and there came
the winter when Stephen was fourteen.</p>

<p>On a January afternoon of bright sunshine, Mademoiselle Duphot
sat dabbing her eyes; for Mademoiselle Duphot must leave her loved
St&eacute;venne, must give place to a rival who could teach Greek
and Latin&mdash;she would go back to Paris, the poor Mademoiselle
Duphot, and take care of her ageing Maman.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Stephen, very angular and lanky at fourteen, was
standing before her father in his study. She stood still, but her
glance kept straying to the window, to the sunshine that seemed to
be beckoning through the window. She was dressed for riding in
breeches and gaiters, and her thoughts were with Raftery.</p>

<p>'Sit down,' said Sir Philip, and his voice was so grave that her
thoughts came back with a leap and a bound; 'you and I have got to
talk this thing out, Stephen.'</p>

<p>'What thing, Father?' she faltered, sitting down abruptly.</p>

<p>'Your idleness, my child. The time has now come when all play
and no work will make a dull Stephen, unless we pull ourselves
together.'</p>

<p>She rested her large, shapely hands on her knees and bent
forward, searching his face intently. What she saw there was a
quiet determination that spread from his lips to his eyes. She grew
suddenly uneasy, like a youngster who objects to the rather
unpleasant process of mouthing.</p>

<p>'I speak French,' she broke out, 'I speak French like a native;
I can read and write French as well as Mademoiselle does.'</p>

<p>'And beyond that you know very little,' he informed her; 'it's
not enough, Stephen, believe me.'</p>

<p>There ensued a long silence, she tapping her leg with her whip,
he speculating about her. Then he said, but quite gently: 'I've
considered this thing&mdash;I've considered this matter of your
education. I want you to have the same education, the same
advantages as I'd give to my son&mdash;that is as far as
possible&mdash;' he added, looking away from Stephen.</p>

<p>'But I'm not your son, Father,' she said very slowly, and even
as she said it her heart felt heavy&mdash;heavy and sad as it bad
not done for years, not since she was quite a small child.</p>

<p>And at this he looked back at her with love in his eyes, love
and something that seemed like compassion; and their looks met and
mingled and held for a moment, speechless yet somehow expressing
their hearts. Her own eyes clouded and she stared at her boots,
ashamed of the tears that she felt might flow over. He saw this and
went on speaking more quickly, as though anxious to cover her
confusion.</p>

<p>'You're all the son that I've got,' he told her. 'You're brave
and strong-limbed, but I want you to be wise&mdash;I want you to be
wise for your own sake, Stephen, because at the best life requires
great wisdom. I want you to learn to make friends of your books;
some day you may need them, because&mdash;' He hesitated, 'because
you mayn't find life at all easy, we none of us do, and books are
good friends. I don't want you to give up your fencing and
gymnastics or your riding, but I want you to show moderation.
You've developed your body, now develop your mind; let your mind
and your muscles help, not hinder each other&mdash;it can be done,
Stephen, I've done it myself, and in many respects you're like me.
I've brought you up very differently from most girls, you must know
that&mdash;look at Violet Antrim. I've indulged you, I suppose, but
I don't think I've spoilt you, because I believe in you absolutely.
I believe in myself, too, where you're concerned; I believe in my
own sound judgment. But you've now got to prove that my judgment's
been sound, we've both got to prove it to ourselves and to your
mother&mdash;she's been very patient with my unusual
methods&mdash;I'm going to stand trial now, and she'll be my judge.
Help me, I'm going to need all your help; if you fail then I fail,
we shall go down together. But we're not going to fail, you're
going to work hard when your new governess comes, and when you're
older you're going to become a fine woman; you must, dear&mdash;I
love you so much that you can't disappoint me.' His voice faltered
a little, then he held out his hand: 'and Stephen, come
here&mdash;look me straight in the eyes&mdash;what is honour, my
daughter?'</p>

<p>She looked into his anxious, questioning eyes: 'You are honour,'
she said quite simply.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>When Stephen kissed Mademoiselle Duphot good-bye, she cried, for
she felt that something was going that would never come
back&mdash;irresponsible childhood. It was going, like Mademoiselle
Duphot. Kind Mademoiselle Duphot, so foolishly loving, so easily
coerced, so glad to be persuaded; so eager to believe that you were
doing your best, in the face of the most obvious slacking. Kind
Mademoiselle Duphot who smiled when she shouldn't, who laughed when
she shouldn't, and now was weeping&mdash;but weeping as only a
Latin can weep, shedding rivers of tears and sobbing quite
loudly.</p>

<p>'Ch&eacute;rie&mdash;mon b&eacute;b&eacute;, petit thou!' she
was sobbing, as she clung to the angular Stephen.</p>

<p>The tears ran down on to Mademoiselle's tippet, and they wet the
poor fur which already looked jaded, and the fur clogged together,
turning black with those tears, so that Mademoiselle tried to wipe
it. But the more she wiped it, the wetter it grew, since her
handkerchief only augmented the trouble; nor was Stephen's large
handkerchief very dry either, as she found when she started to
help.</p>

<p>The old station fly that had come out from Malvern, drove up,
and the footman seized Mademoiselle's luggage. It was such meagre
luggage that he waved back assistance from the driver, and lifted
the trunk single-handed. Then Mademoiselle Duphot broke out into
English&mdash;heaven only knew why, perhaps from emotion.</p>

<p>'It's not farewell, it shall not be for ever&mdash;' she sobbed.
'You come, but I feel it, to Paris. We meet once more,
St&eacute;venne, my poor little baby, when you grow up bigger, we
two meet once more&mdash;' And Stephen, already taller than she
was, longed to grow small again, just to please Mademoiselle. Then,
because the French are a practical people even in moments of real
emotion, Mademoiselle found her handbag, and groping in its depths
she produced a half sheet of paper.</p>

<p>'The address of my sister in Paris,' she said, snuffling; 'the
address of my sister who makes little bags&mdash;if you should hear
of anyone, St&eacute;venne&mdash;any lady who would care to buy one
little bag&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, I'll remember,' muttered Stephen.</p>

<p>At last she was gone; the fly rumbled away down the drive and
finally turned the corner. To the end a wet face had been thrust
from the window, a wet handkerchief waved despondently at Stephen.
The rain must have mingled with Mademoiselle's tears, for the
weather had broken and now it was raining. It was surely a desolate
day for departure, with the mist closing over the Severn Valley and
beginning to creep up the hill-sides...</p>

<p>Stephen made her way to the empty schoolroom, empty of all save
a general confusion; the confusion that stalks in some people's
trail&mdash;it had always stalked Mademoiselle Duphot. On the
chairs, which stood crooked, lay odds and ends meaning
nothing&mdash;crumpled paper, a broken shoehorn, a well-worn brown
glove that had lost its fellow and likewise two of its buttons. On
the table lay a much abused pink blotting-pad, from which Stephen
had torn off the corners, unhidden&mdash;it was crossed and
re-crossed with elegant French script until its scarred face had
turned purple. And there stood the bottle of purple ink,
half-empty, and green round its neck with dribbles; and a pen with
a nib as sharp as a pin point, a thin, peevish nib that jabbed at
the paper. Chock-a-block with the bottle of purple ink lay a little
piety card of St. Joseph that had evidently slipped out of
Mademoiselle's missal&mdash;St. Joseph looked very respectable and
kind&mdash;like the fishmonger in Great Malvern. Stephen picked up
the card and stared at St. Joseph; something was written across his
corner; looking closer she read the minute handwriting: 'Priez pour
ma petite St&eacute;venne.'</p>

<p>She put the card away in her desk; the ink and the blotter she
hid in the cupboard together with the peevish steel nib that jabbed
paper, and that richly deserved cremation. Then she straightened
the chairs and threw away the litter, after which she went in
search of a duster; one by one she dusted the few remaining volumes
in the bookcase, including the Biblioth&egrave;que Rose. She
arranged her dictation notebooks in a pile with others that were
far less accurately written&mdash;books of sums, mostly careless
and marked with a cross; books of English history, in one of which
Stephen had begun to write the history of the horse! Books of
geography with Mademoiselle's comments in strong purple ink: 'Grand
manque d'attention'. And lastly she collected the torn lesson books
that had lain on their backs, on their sides, on their
bellies&mdash;anyhow, anywhere in drawers or in cupboards, but not
very often in the bookcase. For the bookcase was harbouring quite
other things, a motley and most unstudious collection; dumb-bells,
wooden and iron of various sizes&mdash;some Indian clubs, one split
off at the handle&mdash;cotton laces for gym shoes, the belt of a
tunic. And then stable keepsakes, including a headband that Raftery
had worn on some special occasion; a miniature horseshoe kicked
sky-high by Collins; a half-eaten carrot, now withered and mouldy,
and two hunting crops that had both lost their lashes and were
waiting to visit the saddler.</p>

<p>Stephen considered, rubbing her chin&mdash;a habit which by now
had become automatic&mdash;she finally decided on the ample
box-sofa as a seemly receptacle. Remained only the carrot, and she
stood for a long time with it clasped in her hand, disturbed and
unhappy&mdash;this clearing of the decks for stern mental action
was certainly very depressing. But at last she threw the thing into
the fire, where it shifted distressfully, sizzling and humming.
Then she sat down and stared rather grimly at the flames that were
burning up Raftery's first carrot.</p>

<h3><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter Seven</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Soon after the departure of Mademoiselle Duphot, there occurred
two distinct innovations at Morton. Miss Puddleton arrived to take
possession of the schoolroom, and Sir Philip bought himself a
motor-car. The motor was a Panhard, and it caused much excitement
in the neighbourhood of Upton-on-Severn. Conservative, suspicious
of all innovations, people had abstained from motors in the
Midlands, and, incredible as it now seems to look back upon, Sir
Philip was regarded as a kind of pioneer. The Panhard was a
high-shouldered, snub-nosed abortion with a loud, vulgar voice and
an uncertain temper. It suffered from frequent fits of dyspepsia,
brought about by an unhealthy spark-plug. Its seats were the very
acme of discomfort, its primitive gears unhandy and noisy, but
nevertheless it could manage to attain to a speed of about fifteen
miles per hour&mdash;given always that, by God's good grace and the
chauffeur's, it was not in the throes of indigestion.</p>

<p>Anna felt doubtful regarding this new purchase. She was one of
those women who, having passed forty, were content to go on
placidly driving in their broughams, or, in summer, in their
charming little French victorias. She detested the look of herself
in large goggles, detested being forced to tie on her hat, detested
the heavy, mannish coat of rough tweed that Sir Philip insisted she
must wear when motoring. Such things were not of her; they offended
her sense of the seemly, her preference for soft, clinging
garments, her instinct for quiet, rather slow, gentle movements,
her love of the feminine and comely. For Anna at forty-four was
still slender, and her dark hair, as yet, was untouched with grey,
and her blue Irish eyes were as clear and candid as when she had
come as a bride to Morton. She was beautiful still, and this fact
rejoiced her in secret, because of her husband. Yet Anna did not
ignore middle age; she met it half-way with dignity and courage;
and now her soft dresses were of reticent colours, and her
movements a little more careful than they had been, and her mind
more severely disciplined and guarded&mdash;too much guarded these
days, she was gradually growing less tolerant as her interests
narrowed. And the motor, an unimportant thing in itself, served
nevertheless to crystallize in Anna a certain tendency towards
retrogression, a certain instinctive dislike of the unusual, a
certain deep-rooted fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>Old Williams was openly disgusted and hostile; he considered the
car to be an outrage to his stables&mdash;those immaculate stables
with their spacious coach-houses, their wide plaits of straw neatly
interwoven with yards of red and blue saddler's tape, and their
fine stable-yard hitherto kept so spotless. Came the Panhard, and
behold, pools of oil on the flagstones, greenish, bad-smelling oil
that defied even scouring; and a medley of odd-looking tools in the
coach-house, all greasy, all soiling your hands when you touched
them; and large tins of what looked like black vaseline; and spare
tyres for which nails had been knocked into the woodwork; and a
bench with a vice for the motor's insides which were frequently
being dissected. From this coach-house the dog-cart had been
ruthlessly expelled, and now it must stand chock-a-block with the
phaeton, so that room might be made for the garish intruder
together with its young body-servant. The young body-servant was
known as a chauffeur&mdash;he had come down from London and wore
clothes made of leather. He talked Cockney, and openly spat before
Williams in the coach-house, then rubbed his foot over the
spittle.</p>

<p>'I'll have none of yer expectoration 'ere in me coach-house, I
tell ee!' bawled Williams, apoplectic with temper.</p>

<p>'Oh, come orf it, do, Grandpa; we're not in the ark!' was how
the new blood answered Williams.</p>

<p>There was war to the knife between Williams and
Burton&mdash;Burton who expressed large disdain of the horses.</p>

<p>'Yer time's up now, Grandpa,' he was constantly remarking; 'it's
all up with the gees&mdash;better learn to be a shovver!'</p>

<p>'Opes I'll die afore ever I demean meself that way, you young
blight!' bawled the outraged Williams. Very angry he grew, and his
dinner fermented, dilating his stomach and causing discomfort, so
that his wife became anxious about him.</p>

<p>'Now don't ee go worryin', Arth-thur,' she coaxed; 'us be old,
me and you, and the world be progressin'.'</p>

<p>'It be goin' to the devil, that's what it be doin'!' groaned
Williams, rubbing his stomach.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Sir Philip's behaviour was that of a
schoolboy with some horrid new contraption. He was caught by his
stud-groom lying flat on his back with his feet sticking out
beneath the bonnet of the motor, and when he emerged there was soot
on his cheek-bones, on his hair, and even on the tip of his nose.
He looked terribly sheepish, and as Williams said later to his
wife:</p>

<p>'It were somethin' aw-ful to see 'im all mucked up, and 'im such
a neat gentleman, and 'im in a filthy old coat of that Burton's,
and that Burton agrinnin' at me and just pointin', silent, because
the master couldn't see 'im, and the master a-callin' up
familiar-like to Burton: "I say! She's got somethin' all wrong with
'er exhaust pipe!" and Burton a-contradictin' the master: "It's
that piston," says 'e, as cool as yer please.'</p>

<p>Nor was Stephen less thrilled by the car than was her father.
Stephen made friends with the execrable Burton, and Burton, who was
only too anxious to gain allies, soon started to teach her the
parts of the engine; he taught her to drive too, Sir Philip being
willing, and off they would go, the three of them together, leaving
Williams to glare at the disappearing motor.</p>

<p>'And 'er such a fine 'orse-woman and all!' he would grumble,
rubbing a disconsolate chin.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that Williams felt heart-broken, he
was like a very unhappy old baby; quite infantile he was in his
fits of bad temper, in his mouthings and his grindings of toothless
gums. And all about nothing, for Sir Philip and his daughter had
the lure of horseflesh in their very bones&mdash;and then there was
Raftery, and Raftery loved Stephen, and Stephen loved Raftery.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The motoring, of course, was the most tremendous fun,
but&mdash;and it was a very large but indeed&mdash;when Stephen got
home to Morton and the schoolroom, a little grey figure would be
sitting at the table correcting an exercise book, or preparing some
task for the following morning. The little grey figure might look
up and smile, and when it did this its face would be charming; but
if it refrained from smiling, then its face would be ugly, too hard
and too square in formation&mdash;except for the brow, which was
rounded and shiny like a bare intellectual knee. If the little grey
figure got up from the table, you were struck by the fact that it
seemed square all over&mdash;square shoulders, square hips, a flat,
square line of bosom; square tips to the fingers, square toes to
the shoes, and all tiny; it suggested a miniature box that was
neatly spliced at the corners. Of uncertain age, pale, with
iron-grey hair, grey eyes, and invariably dressed in dark grey.
Miss Puddleton did not look very inspiring&mdash;not at all as one
having authority, in fact. But on close observation it had to be
admitted that her chin, though minute, was extremely aggressive.
Her mouth, too, was firm, except when its firmness was melted by
the warmth and humour of her smile&mdash;a smile that mocked,
pitied and questioned the world, and perhaps Miss Puddleton as
well.</p>

<p>From the very first moment of Miss Puddleton's arrival, Stephen
had had an uncomfortable conviction that this queer little woman
was going to mean something, was going to become a fixture. And
sure enough she had settled down at once, so that in less than two
months it seemed to Stephen that Miss Puddleton must always have
been at Morton, must always have been sitting at the large walnut
table, must always have been saying in that dry, toneless voice
with the Oxford accent: 'You've forgotten something, Stephen,' and
then, the books can't walk to the bookcase, but you can, so suppose
that you take them with you.'</p>

<p>It was truly amazing, the change in the schoolroom, not a book
out of place, not a shelf in disorder; even the box lounge had had
to be opened and its dumb-bells and clubs paired off nicely
together&mdash;Miss Puddleton always liked things to be paired,
perhaps an unrecognized matrimonial instinct. And now Stephen found
herself put into harness for the first time in her life, and she
loathed the sensation. There were so many rules that a very large
time-sheet had had to be fastened to the blackboard in the
schoolroom.</p>

<p>'Because,' said Miss Puddleton as she pinned the thing up, 'even
my brain won't stand your complete lack of method, it's infectious;
this time-sheet is my anti-toxin, so please don't tear it to
pieces!'</p>

<p>Mathematics and algebra, Latin and Greek, Roman history, Greek
history, geometry, botany, they reduced Stephen's mind to a species
of beehive in which every bee buzzed on the least provocation. She
would gaze at Miss Puddleton in a kind of amazement; that tiny,
square box to hold all this grim knowledge! And seeing that gaze
Miss Puddleton would smile her most warm, charming smile, and would
say as she did so:</p>

<p>'Yes, I know&mdash;but it's only the first effort, Stephen;
presently your mind will get neat like the schoolroom, and then
you'll be able to find what you want without all this rummaging and
bother.'</p>

<p>But her tasks being over, Stephen must often slip away to visit
Raftery in the stables; 'Oh, Raftery, I'm hating it so!' she would
tell him. 'I feel like you'd feel if I put you in
harness&mdash;hard wooden shafts and a kicking strap,
Raftery&mdash;but my darling, I'd never put you into harness!'</p>

<p>And Raftery would hardly know what he should answer, since all
human creatures, so far as he knew them, must run between
shafts...God-like though they were, they undoubtedly had to run
between shafts...</p>

<p>Nothing but Stephen's great love for her father helped her to
endure the first six months of learning&mdash;that and her own
stubborn, arrogant will that made her hate to be beaten. She would
swing clubs and dumb-bells in a kind of fury, consoling herself
with the thought of her muscles, and, finding her at it, Miss
Puddleton had laughed.</p>

<p>'You must feel that your teacher's some sort of midge,
Stephen&mdash;a tiresome midge that you want to brush off!'</p>

<p>Then Stephen had laughed too: 'Well, you are little,
Puddle&mdash;oh, I'm sorry&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I don't mind,' Miss Puddleton had told her; 'call me Puddle if
you like, it's all one to me.' After which Miss Puddleton
disappeared somehow, and Puddle took her place in the
household.</p>

<p>An insignificant creature this Puddle, yet at moments
unmistakably self-assertive. Always willing to help in domestic
affairs, such as balancing Anna's chaotic account books, or making
out library lists for Jackson's, she was nevertheless very guardful
of her rights, very quick to assert and maintain her position.
Puddle knew what she wanted and saw that she got it, both in and
out of the schoolroom. Yet everyone liked her; she took what she
gave and she gave what she took, yes, but sometimes she gave just a
little bit more&mdash;and that little bit more is the whole art of
teaching, the whole art of living, in fact, and Miss Puddleton knew
it. Thus gradually, oh, very gradually at first, she wore down her
pupil's unconscious resistance. With small, dexterous fingers she
caught Stephen's brain, and she stroked it and modelled it after
her own fashion. She talked to that brain and showed it new
pictures; she gave it new thoughts, new hopes and ambitions; she
made it feel certain and proud of achievement. Nor did she belittle
Stephen's muscles in the process, never once did Puddle make game
of the athlete, never once did she show by so much as the twitch of
an eyelid that she had her own thoughts about her pupil. She
appeared to take Stephen as a matter of course, nothing surprised
or even amused her it seemed, and Stephen grew quite at ease with
her.</p>

<p>'I can always be comfortable with you, Puddle,' Stephen would
say in a tone of satisfaction, 'you're like a nice chair; though
you are so tiny yet one's got room to stretch, I don't know how you
do it.'</p>

<p>Then Puddle would smile, and that smile would warm Stephen while
it mocked her a little; but it also mocked Puddle&mdash;they would
share that warm smile with its fun and its kindness so that neither
of them could feel hurt or embarrassed. And their friendship took
root, growing strong and verdant, and it flourished like a green
bay-tree in the school-room.</p>

<p>Came the time when Stephen began to realize that Puddle had
genius&mdash;the genius of teaching; the genius of compelling her
pupil to share in her own enthusiastic love of the Classics.</p>

<p>Oh, Stephen, if only you could read this in Greek!' she would
say, and her voice would sound full of excitement; 'the beauty, the
splendid dignity of it&mdash;it's like the sea, Stephen, rather
terrible, but splendid; that's the language, it's far more virile
than Latin.' And Stephen would catch that sudden excitement, and
determine to work even harder at Greek.</p>

<p>But Puddle did not live by the ancients alone, she taught
Stephen to appreciate all literary beauty, observing in her pupil a
really fine judgment, a great feeling for balance in sentences and
words. A vast tract of new interest was thus opened up, and Stephen
began to excel in composition; to her own deep amazement she found
herself able to write many things that had long lain dormant in her
heart&mdash;all the beauty of nature, for instance, she could write
it. Impressions of childhood&mdash;gold light on the hills; the
first cuckoo, mysterious, strangely alluring; those rides home from
hunting together with her father&mdash;bare furrows, the meaning of
those bare furrows. And later, how many queer hopes and queer
longings, queer joys and even more curious frustrations. Joy of
strength, splendid physical strength and courage; joy of health and
sound sleep and refreshed awakening; joy of Raftery leaping under
the saddle, joy of wind racing backward as Raftery leapt forward.
And then, what? A sudden impenetrable darkness, a sudden vast void
all nothingness and darkness; a sudden sense of acute apprehension:
'I'm lost, where am I? Where am I? I'm nothing&mdash;yes I am, I'm
Stephen&mdash;but that's being nothing&mdash;' then that horrible
sense of apprehension.</p>

<p>Writing, it was like a heavenly balm, it was like the flowing
out of deep waters, it was like the lifting of a load from the
spirit; it brought with it a sense of relief, of assuagement. One
could say things in writing without feeling self-conscious, without
feeling shy and ashamed and foolish&mdash;one could even write of
the days of young Nelson, smiling a very little as one did so.</p>

<p>Sometimes Puddle would sit alone in her bedroom reading and
rereading Stephen's strange compositions; frowning, or smiling a
little in her turn, at those turbulent, youthful outpourings.</p>

<p>She would think: 'Here's real talent, real red-hot
talent&mdash;interesting to find it in that great, athletic
creature; but what is she likely to make of her talent? She's up
agin the world, if she only knew it!' Then Puddle would shake her
head and look doubtful, feeling sorry for Stephen and the world in
general.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>This then was how Stephen conquered yet another kingdom, and at
seventeen was not only athlete but student. Three years under
Puddle's ingenious tuition, and the girl was as proud of her brains
as of her muscles&mdash;a trifle too proud, she was growing
conceited, she was growing self-satisfied, arrogant even, and Sir
Philip must tease her: 'Ask Stephen, she'll tell us. Stephen,
what's that reference to Adeimantus, something about a mind fixed
on true being&mdash;doesn't it come in Euripides, somewhere? Oh,
no, I'm forgetting, of course it's Plato; really my Greek is
disgracefully rusty!' Then Stephen would know that Sir Philip was
laughing at her, but very kindly.</p>

<p>In spite of her newly acquired book learning, Stephen still
talked quite often to Raftery. He was now ten years old and had
grown much in wisdom himself, so he listened with care and
attention.</p>

<p>'You see,' she would tell him, 'it's very important to develop
the brain as well as the muscles; I'm now doing both&mdash;stand
still, will you, Raftery! Never mind that old corn-bin, stop
rolling your eye round&mdash;it's very important to develop the
brain because that gives you an advantage over people, it makes you
more able to do as you like in this world, to conquer conditions,
Raftery.'</p>

<p>And Raftery, who was not really thinking of the corn-bin, but
rolling his eye in an effort to answer, would want to say something
too big for his language, which at best must consist of small
sounds and small movements; would want to say something about a
strong feeling he had that Stephen was missing the truth. But how
could he hope to make her understand the age-old wisdom of all the
dumb creatures? The wisdom of plains and primeval forests, the
wisdom come down from the youth of the world.</p>

<h3><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter Eight</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>At seventeen Stephen was taller than Anna, who had used to be
considered quite tall for a woman, but Stephen was nearly as tall
as her father&mdash;not a beauty this, in the eyes of the
neighbours.</p>

<p>Colonel Antrim would shake his head and remark: 'I like 'em
plump and compact, it's more taking.'</p>

<p>Then his wife, who was certainly plump and compact, so compact
in her stays that she felt rather breathless, would say: 'But then
Stephen is very unusual, almost&mdash;well, almost a wee bit
unnatural&mdash;such a pity, poor child, it's a terrible drawback;
young men do hate that sort of thing, don't they?'</p>

<p>But in spite of all this Stephen's figure was handsome in a
flat, broad-shouldered and slim flanked fashion; and her movements
were purposeful, having fine poise, she moved with the easy
assurance of the athlete. Her hands, although large for a woman,
were slender and meticulously tended; she was proud of her hands.
In face she had changed very little since childhood, still having
Sir Philip's wide, tolerant expression. What change there was only
tended to strengthen the extraordinary likeness between father and
daughter, for now that the bones of her face showed more clearly,
as the childish fullness had gradually diminished, the formation of
the resolute jaw was Sir Philip's. His too the strong chin with its
shade of a cleft; the well modelled, sensitive lips were his also.
A fine face, very pleasing, yet with something about it that went
ill with the hats on which Anna insisted&mdash;large hats trimmed
with ribbons or roses or daisies, and supposed to be softening to
the features.</p>

<p>Staring at her own reflection in the glass, Stephen would feel
just a little uneasy: Am I queer looking or not?' she would wonder,
Suppose I wore my hair more like Mother's?' and then she would undo
her splendid thick hair, and would part it in the middle and draw
it back loosely.</p>

<p>The result was always far from becoming, so that Stephen would
hastily plait it again. She now wore the plait screwed up very
tightly in the nape of her neck with a bow of black ribbon. Anna
hated this fashion and constantly said so, but Stephen was
stubborn: 'I've tried your way, Mother, and look like a scarecrow;
you're beautiful, darling, but your young daughter isn't, which is
jolly hard on you.'</p>

<p>She makes no effort to improve her appearance,' Anna would
reproach, very gravely.</p>

<p>These days there was constant warfare between them on the
subject of clothes; quite a seemly warfare, for Stephen was
learning to control her hot temper, and Anna was seldom anything
but gentle. Nevertheless it was open warfare, the inevitable clash
of two opposing natures who sought to express themselves in
apparel, since clothes, after all, are a form of self-expression.
The victory would now be on this side, now on that; sometimes
Stephen would appear in a thick woollen jersey, or a suit of rough
tweeds surreptitiously ordered from the excellent tailor in
Malvern. Sometimes Anna would triumph, having journeyed to London
to procure soft and very expensive dresses, which her daughter must
wear in order to please her, because she would come home quite
tired by such journeys. On the whole, Anna got her own way at this
time, for Stephen would suddenly give up the contest, reduced to
submission by Anna's disappointment, always more efficacious than
mere disapproval.</p>

<p>'Here, give it to me!' she would say rather gruffly, grabbing
the delicate dress from her mother.</p>

<p>Then off she would rush and put it on all wrong, so that Anna
would sigh in a kind of desperation, and would pat, readjust,
unfasten and fasten, striving to make peace between wearer and
model, whose inimical feelings were evidently mutual.</p>

<p>Came a day when Stephen was suddenly outspoken: 'It's my face,'
she announced, 'something's wrong with my face.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense!' exclaimed Anna, and her cheeks flushed a little, as
though the girl's words had been an offence, then she turned away
quickly to hide her expression.</p>

<p>But Stephen had seen that fleeting expression, and she stood
very still when her mother had left her, her own face growing heavy
and sombre with anger, with a sense of some uncomprehended
injustice. She wrenched off the dress and hurled it from her,
longing intensely to rend it, to hurt it, longing to hurt herself
in the process, yet filled all the while with that sense of
injustice. But this mood changed abruptly to one of self pity; she
wanted to sit down and weep over Stephen; on a sudden impulse she
wanted to pray over Stephen as though she were someone apart, yet
terribly personal too in her trouble. Going over to the dress she
smoothed it out slowly; it seemed to have acquired an enormous
importance; it seemed to have acquired the importance of prayer,
the poor, crumpled thing lying crushed and dejected. Yet Stephen,
these days, was not given to prayer, God had grown so unreal, so
hard to believe in since she had studied Comparative Religion;
engrossed in her studies she had somehow mislaid Him. But now, here
she was, very wishful to pray, while not knowing how to explain her
dilemma: 'I'm terribly unhappy, dear, improbable God&mdash;' would
not be a very propitious beginning. And yet at this moment she was
wanting a God and a tangible one, very kind and paternal; a God
with a white flowing beard and wide forehead, a benevolent
parent&mdash;Who would lean out of Heaven and turn His face
sideways the better to listen from His cloud, upheld by cherubs and
angels. What she wanted was a wise old family God, surrounded by
endless heavenly relations. In spite of her troubles she began to
laugh weakly, and the laughing was good for it killed self pity;
nor can it have offended that Venerable Person whose image persists
in the hearts of small children.</p>

<p>She donned the new dress with infinite precaution, pulling out
its bows and arranging its ruffles. Her large hands were clumsy but
now they were willing, very penitent hands full of deep
resignation. They fumbled and paused, then continued to fumble with
the endless small fastenings so cunningly hidden. She sighed once
or twice but the sighs were quite patient, so perhaps in this Wise,
after all, Stephen prayed.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Anna worried continually over her daughter; for one thing
Stephen was a social disaster, yet at seventeen many a girl was
presented, but the bare idea of this had terrified Stephen, and so
it had had to be abandoned. At garden parties she was always a
failure, seemingly ill at ease and ungracious. She shook hands much
too hard, digging rings into fingers, this from sheer automatic
nervous reaction. She spoke not at all, or else gabbled too freely,
so that Anna grew vague in her own conversation; all eyes and ears
she would be as she listened&mdash;it was certainly terribly hard
on Anna. But if hard on Anna, it was harder on Stephen who dreaded
these festive gatherings intensely; indeed her dread of them lacked
all proportion, becoming a kind of unreasoning obsession. Every
vestige of self-confidence seemed to' desert her, so that Puddle,
supposing she happened to be present would find herself grimly
comparing this Stephen with the graceful, light-footed, proficient
young athlete, with the clever and somewhat opinionated student who
was fast outstripping her own powers as a teacher. Yes, Puddle
would sit there grimly comparing, and would feel not a little
uneasy as she did so. Then something of her pupil's distress would
reach her, so that perforce she would have to share it and as like
as not she would want to shake Stephen.</p>

<p>Good Lord,' she would think, 'why can't she hit back? It's
absurd, it's outrageous to be so disgruntled by a handful of petty,
half-educated yokels&mdash;a girl with her brain too, it's simply
outrageous! She'll have to tackle life more forcibly than this, if
she's not going to let herself go under!'</p>

<p>But Stephen, completely oblivious of Puddle, would be deep in
the throes of her old suspicion, the suspicion that had haunted her
ever since childhood&mdash;she would fancy that people were
laughing at her. So sensitive was she, that a half-heard sentence,
a word, a glance, made her inwardly crumble. It might well be that
people were not even thinking about her, much less discussing her
appearance&mdash;no good, she would always imagine that the word,
the glance, had some purely personal meaning. She would twitch at
her hat with inadequate fingers, or walk clumsily, slouching a
little as she did so, until Anna would whisper:</p>

<p>'Hold your back up, you're stooping.'</p>

<p>Or Puddle exclaim crossly: 'What on earth's the matter,
Stephen!' All of which only added to Stephen's tribulation by
making her still more self-conscious.</p>

<p>With other young girls she had nothing in common, while they, in
their turn, found her irritating. She was shy to primness regarding
certain subjects, and would actually blush if they happened to be
mentioned. This would strike her companions as queer and
absurd&mdash;after all, between girls&mdash;surely every one knew
that at times one ought not to get one's feet wet, that one didn't
play games, not at certain times&mdash;there was nothing to make
all this fuss about surely! To see Stephen Gordon's expression of
horror if one so much as threw out a hint on the subject, was to
feel that the thing must in some way be shameful, a kind of
disgrace, a humiliation! And then she was odd about other things
too; there were so many things that she didn't like mentioned.</p>

<p>In the end, they completely lost patience with her, and they
left her alone with her fads and her fancies, disliking the check
that her presence imposed, disliking to feel that they dare not
allude to even the necessary functions of nature without being made
to feel immodest.</p>

<p>But at times Stephen hated her own isolation, and then she would
make little awkward advances, while her eyes would grow rather
apologetic, like the eyes of a dog who has been out of favour. She
would try to appear quite at ease with her companions, as she
joined in their light-hearted conversation. Strolling up to a group
of young girls at a party, she would grin as though their small
jokes amused her, or else listen gravely while they talked about
clothes or some popular actor who had visited Malvern. As long as
they refrained from too intimate details, she would fondly imagine
that her interest passed muster. There she would stand with her
strong arms folded, and her face somewhat strained in an effort of
attention. While despising these girls, she yet longed to be like
them&mdash;yes, indeed, at such moments she longed to be like them.
It would suddenly strike her that they seemed very happy, very sure
of themselves as they gossiped together. There was something so
secure in their feminine conclaves, a secure sense of oneness, of
mutual understanding; each in turn understood the other's
ambitions. They might have their jealousies, their quarrels even,
but always she discerned underneath, that sense of oneness.</p>

<p>Poor Stephen! She could never impose upon them; they always saw
through her as though she were a window. They knew well enough that
she cared not so much as a jot about clothes and popular actors.
Conversation would falter, then die down completely, her presence
would dry up their springs of inspiration. She spoilt things while
trying to make herself agreeable; they really liked her better when
she was grumpy.</p>

<p>Could Stephen have met men on equal terms, she would always have
chosen them as her companions; she preferred them because of their
blunt, open outlook, and with men she had much in
common&mdash;sport for instance. But men found her too clever if
she ventured to expand, and too dull if she suddenly subsided into
shyness. In addition to this there was something about her that
antagonized slightly, an unconscious presumption. Shy though she
might be, they sensed this presumption; it annoyed them, it made
them feel on the defensive. She was handsome but much too large and
unyielding both in body and mind, and they liked clinging women.
They were oak-trees, preferring the feminine ivy. It might cling
rather close, it might finally strangle, it frequently did, and yet
they preferred it, and this being so, they resented Stephen,
suspecting something of the acorn about her.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen's worst ordeals at this time were the dinners given in
turn by a hospitable county. They were long, these dinners,
overloaded with courses; they were heavy, being weighted with
polite conversation; they were stately, by reason of the family
silver; above all they were firmly conservative in spirit, as
conservative as the marriage service itself, and almost as
insistent upon sex distinction.</p>

<p>'Captain Ramsay, will you take Miss Gordon in to dinner?' A
politely crooked arm: 'Delighted, Miss Gordon.'</p>

<p>Then the solemn and very ridiculous procession, animals marching
into Noah's Ark two by two, very sure of divine
protection&mdash;male and female created He them! Stephen's skirt
would be long and her foot might get entangled, and she with but
one free hand at her disposal&mdash;the procession would stop and
she would have stopped it! Intolerable thought, she had stopped the
procession!</p>

<p>'I'm so sorry, Captain Ramsay!'</p>

<p>'I say, can I help you?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;it's really&mdash;all right, I think I can
manage&mdash;'</p>

<p>But oh, the utter confusion of spirit, the humiliating feeling
that someone must be laughing, the resentment at having to cling to
his arm for support, while Captain Ramsay looked patient.</p>

<p>'Not much damage, I think you've just torn the frill, but I
often wonder how you women manage. Imagine a man in a dress like
that, too awful to think of&mdash;imagine me in it!' Then a laugh,
not unkindly but a trifle self-conscious, and rather more than a
trifle complacent.</p>

<p>Safely steered to her seat at the long dinner-table, Stephen
would struggle to smile and talk brightly, while her partner would
think: 'Lord, she's heavy in hand; I wish I had the mother; now
there's a lovely woman!'</p>

<p>And Stephen would think: 'I'm a bore, why is it?' Then, 'But if
I were he I wouldn't be a bore, I could just be myself; I'd feel
perfectly natural.'</p>

<p>Her face would grow splotched with resentment and worry; she
would feel her neck flush and her hands become awkward.
Embarrassed, she would sit staring down at her hands, which would
seem to be growing more and more awkward. No escape! No escape!
Captain Ramsay was kind-hearted, he would try very hard to be
complimentary; his grey eyes would try to express admiration,
polite admiration as they rested on Stephen. His voice would sound
softer and more confidential, the voice that nice men reserve for
good women, protective, respectful, yet a little sex-conscious, a
little expectant of a tentative response. But Stephen would feel
herself growing more rigid with every kind word and gallant
allusion. Openly hostile she would be feeling, as poor Captain
Ramsay or some other victim was manfully trying to do his duty.</p>

<p>In such a mood as this she had once drunk champagne, one glass
only, the first she had ever tasted. She had gulped it all down in
sheer desperation&mdash;the result had not been Dutch courage but
hiccups. Violent, insistent, incorrigible hiccups had echoed along
the whole length of the table. One of those weird conversational
lulls had been filled, as it were, to the brim with her hiccups.
Then Anna had started to talk very loudly; Mrs. Antrim had smiled
and so had their hostess. Their hostess had finally beckoned to the
butler: 'Give Miss Gordon a glass of water,' she had whispered.
After that, Stephen shunned champagne like the plague&mdash;better
hopeless depression, she decided, than hiccups!</p>

<p>It was strange how little her fine brain seemed able to help her
when she was trying to be social; in spite of her confident
boasting to Raftery, it did not seem able to help her at all.
Perhaps it was the clothes, for she lost all conceit the moment she
was dressed as Anna would have her; at this period clothes greatly
influenced Stephen, giving her confidence or the reverse. But be
that as it might, people thought her peculiar, and with them that
was tantamount to disapproval.</p>

<p>And thus, it was being borne in upon Stephen, that for her there
was no real abiding city beyond the strong, friendly old gates of
Morton, and she clung more and more to her home and to her father.
Perplexed and unhappy she would seek out her father on all social
occasions and would sit down beside him. Like a very small child
this large muscular creature would sit down beside him because she
felt lonely, and because youth most rightly resents isolation, and
because she had not yet learnt her hard lesson&mdash;she had not
yet learnt that the loneliest place in this world is the
no-man's-land of sex.</p>

<h3><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter Nine</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Sir Philip and his daughter had a new common interest; they
could now discuss books and the making of books and the feel and
the smell and the essence of books&mdash;a mighty bond this, and
one full of enchantment. They could talk of these things with
mutual understanding; they did so for hours in the father's study,
and Sir Philip discovered a secret ambition that had lain in the
girl like a seed in deep soil; and he, the good gardener of her
body and spirit, hoed the soil and watered this seed of ambition.
Stephen would show him her queer compositions, and would wait very
breathless and still while he read them; then one evening he looked
up and saw her expression, and he smiled:</p>

<p>'So that's it, you want to be a writer. Well, why not? You've
got plenty of talent, Stephen; I should be a proud man if you were
a writer.' After which their discussions on the making of books
held an even more vital enchantment.</p>

<p>But Anna came less and less often to the study, and she would be
sitting alone and idle. Puddle, upstairs at work in the schoolroom,
might be swotting at her Greek to keep pace with Stephen, but Anna
would be sitting with her hands in her lap in the vast drawing-room
so beautifully proportioned, so restfully furnished in old polished
walnut, so redolent of beeswax and orris root and violets&mdash;all
alone in its vastness would Anna be sitting, with her white hands
folded and idle.</p>

<p>A lovely and most comfortable woman she had been, and still was,
in spite of her gentle ageing, but not learned, oh, no, very far
from learned&mdash;that, indeed, was why Sir Philip had loved her,
that was why he had found her so infinitely restful, that was why
he still loved her after very many years; her simplicity was
stronger to hold him than learning. But now Anna went less and less
often to the study.</p>

<p>It was not that they failed to make her feel welcome, but rather
that they could not conceal their deep interest in subjects of
which she knew little or nothing. What did she know of or care for
the Classics? What interest had she in the works of Erasmus? Her
theology needed no erudite discussion, her philosophy consisted of
a home swept and garnished, and as for the poets, she liked simple
verses; for the rest her poetry lay in her husband. All this she
well knew and had no wish to alter, yet lately there had come upon
Anna an aching, a tormenting aching that she dared give no name to.
It nagged at her heart when she went to that study and saw Sir
Philip together with their daughter, and knew that her presence
contributed nothing to his happiness when he sat reading to
Stephen.</p>

<p>Staring at the girl she would see the strange resemblance, the
invidious likeness of the child to the father, she would notice
their movements so grotesquely alike; their hands were alike, they
made the same gestures, and her mind would recoil with that
nameless resentment, the while she reproached herself; penitent and
trembling. Yet penitent and trembling though Anna might be, she
would sometimes hear herself speaking to Stephen in a way that
would make her feel secretly ashamed. She would hear herself
covertly, cleverly gibing, with such skill that the girl would look
up at her bewildered; with such skill that even Sir Philip himself
could not well take exception to what she was saying; then, as like
as not, she would laugh it off lightly, as though all the time she
had only been jesting, and Stephen would laugh too, a big, friendly
laugh. But Sir Philip would not laugh, and his eyes would seek
Anna's questioning, amazed, incredulous and angry. That was why she
now went so seldom to the study when Sir Philip and his daughter
were together.</p>

<p>But sometimes, when she was alone with her husband, Anna would
suddenly cling to him in silence. She would hide her face against
his hard shoulder clinging closer and closer, as though she were
frightened, as though she were afraid for this great love of
theirs. He would stand very still, forbearing to move, forbearing
to question, for why should he question? He knew already, and she
knew that he knew. Yet neither of them spoke it, this most unhappy
thing, and their silence spread round them like a poisonous miasma.
The spectre that was Stephen would seem to be watching, and Sir
Philip would gently release himself from Anna, while she, looking
up, would see his tired eyes, not angry any more, only very
unhappy. She would think that those eyes were pleading, beseeching;
she would think: 'He's pleading with me for Stephen.' Then her own
eyes would fill with tears of contrition, and that night she would
kneel long in prayer to her Maker:</p>

<p>Give me peace,' she would entreat, 'and enlighten my spirit, so
that I may learn how to love my own child.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Sir Philip looked older now than his age, and seeing this, Anna
could scarcely endure it. Everything in her cried out in rebellion
so that she wanted to thrust back the years, to hold them at bay
with her own weak body. Had the years been an army of naked swords
she would gladly have held them at bay with her body.</p>

<p>He would constantly now remain in his study right into the early
hours of the morning. This habit of his had been growing on him
lately, and Anna, waking to find herself alone, and feeling uneasy
would steal down to listen. Backwards and forwards, backwards and
forwards! She would hear his desolate sounding footsteps. Why was
he pacing backwards and forwards, and why was she always afraid to
ask him? Why was the hand she stretched out to the door always
fearful when it came to turning the handle? Oh, but it was strong,
this thing that stood between them, strong with the strength of
their united bodies. It had drawn its own life from their youth,
their passion, from the splendid and purposeful meaning of their
passion&mdash;that was how it had leapt full of power into life,
and now it had thrust in between them. They were ageing, they had
little left but their loving&mdash;that gentler loving, perhaps the
more perfect&mdash;and their faith in each other, which was part of
that loving, and their peace, which was part of the peace of
Morton. Backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards! Those
incessant and desolate sounding footsteps. Peace: There was surely
no peace in that study, but rather some affliction, menacing,
prophetic! Yet prophetic of what? She dared not ask him, she dared
not so much as turn the door-handle, a haunting premonition of
disaster would make her creep away with her question unasked.</p>

<p>Then something would draw her, not back to her bedroom, but on
up the stairs to the room of their daughter. She would open that
door very gently&mdash;by inches. She would hold her hand so that
it shaded the candle, and would stand looking down at the sleeping
Stephen as she and her husband had done long ago. But now there
would be no little child to look down on, no small helplessness to
arouse mother-pity. Stephen would be lying very straight, very
large, very long, underneath the neatly drawn covers. Quite often
an arm would be outside the bedspread, the sleeve having fallen
away as it lay there, and that arm would look firm and strong and
possessive, and so would the face by the light of the candle. She
slept deeply. Her breathing would be even and placid. Her body
would be drinking in its fill of refreshment. It would rise up
clean and refreshed in the morning; it would eat, speak,
move&mdash;it would move about Morton. In the stables, in the
gardens, in the neighbouring paddocks, in the study&mdash;it would
move about Morton. Intolerable dispensation of nature. Anna would
stare at that splendid young body, and would feel, as she did so,
that she looked on a stranger. She would scourge her heart and her
anxious spirit with memories drawn from this stranger's beginnings:
'Little&mdash;you were so very little!' she would whisper, 'and you
sucked from my breast because you were hungry&mdash;little and
always so terribly hungry&mdash;a good baby though, a contented
little baby&mdash;'</p>

<p>And Stephen would sometimes stir in her sleep as though she were
vaguely conscious of Anna. It would pass and she would lie quiet
again, breathing in those deep, placid draughts of refreshment.
Then Anna, still ruthlessly scourging her heart and her anxious
spirit, would stoop and kiss Stephen, but lightly and very quickly
on the forehead, so that the girl should not be awakened. So that
the girl should not wake and kiss back, she would kiss her lightly
and quickly on the forehead.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The eye of youth is very observant. Youth has its moments of
keen intuition, even normal youth&mdash;but the intuition of those
who stand mid-way between the sexes, is so ruthless, so poignant,
so accurate, so deadly, as to be in the nature of an added scourge;
and by such an intuition did Stephen discover that all was not well
with her parents.</p>

<p>Their outward existence seemed calm and unruffled; so far
nothing had disturbed the outward peace of Morton. But their child
saw their hearts with the eyes of the spirit; flesh of their flesh,
she had sprung from their hearts, and she knew that those hearts
were heavy. They said nothing, but she sensed that some deep,
secret trouble was afflicting them both; she could see it in their
eyes. In the words that they left unspoken she could hear
it&mdash;it would be there, filling the small gaps of silence. She
thought that she discerned it in her father's slow
movements&mdash;surely his movements had grown slower of late? And
his hair was quite grey; it was quite grey all over. She realized
this with a slight shock one morning as he sat in the
sunlight&mdash;it had used to look auburn in the nape of his neck
when the sun fell upon it&mdash;and now it was dull grey all
over.</p>

<p>But this mattered little. Even their trouble mattered little in
comparison with something more vital, with their love&mdash;that,
she felt, was the only thing that mattered, and that was the thing
that now stood most in danger. This love of theirs had been a great
glory; all her life she had lived with it side by side, but never
until it appeared to be threatened, did she feel that she had
really grasped its true meaning&mdash;the serene and beautiful
spirit of Morton clothed in flesh, yes, that had been its true
meaning. Yet that had been only part of its meaning for her, it had
meant something greater than Morton, it had stood for the symbol of
perfect fulfilment&mdash;she remembered that even as a very small
child she had vaguely discerned that perfect fulfilment. This love
had been glowing like a great friendly beacon, a thing that was
steadfast and very reassuring. All unconscious, she must often have
warmed herself at it, must have thawed out her doubts and her vague
misgivings. It had always been their love, the one for the other;
she knew this, and yet it had been her beacon. But now those flames
were no longer steadfast; something had dared to blemish their
brightness. She longed to leap up in her youth and strength and
cast this thing out of her holy of holies. The fire must not die
and leave her in darkness.</p>

<p>And yet she was utterly helpless, and she knew it. All that she
did seemed inadequate and childish: 'When I was a child I spake as
a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child.'
Remembering Saint Paul, she decided grimly that surely she had
remained as a child. She could sit and stare at them&mdash;these
poor, stricken lovers&mdash;with eyes that were scared and deeply
reproachful: 'You must not let anything spoil your loving, I need
it,' her eyes could send them that message. She could love them in
her turn, possessively, fiercely: 'You're mine, mine, mine, the one
perfect thing about me. You're one and you're mine. I'm frightened,
I need you!' Her thoughts could send them that message. She could
start to caress them, awkwardly, shyly, stroking their hands with
her strong, bony fingers&mdash;first his hand, then hers, then
perhaps both together, so that they smiled in spite of their
trouble. But she dared not stand up before them accusing, and say:
'I'm Stephen, I'm you, for you bred me. You shall not fail me by
failing yourselves. I've a right to demand that you shall not fail
me!' No, she dared not stand up and speak such words as
these&mdash;she had never demanded anything from them.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would think them quietly over as two fellow
creatures whom chance had made her parents. Her father, her
mother&mdash;a man, a woman; and then she would be amazed to
discover how little she knew of this man and this woman. They had
once been babies, and later small children, ignorant of life and
utterly dependent. That seemed so curious, ignorant of
life&mdash;her father utterly weak and dependent. They had come to
adolescence even as she had, and perhaps at times they too had felt
unhappy. What had their thoughts been, those thoughts that lie
hidden, those nebulous misgivings that never get spoken? Had her
mother shrunk back resentful, protesting, when the seal of her
womanhood had been stamped upon her? Surely not for her mother was
somehow so perfect, that all that befell her must in its turn be
perfect&mdash;her mother gathered nature into her arms and embraced
it as a friend, as a well-loved companion. But she, Stephen, had
never felt friendly like that, which must mean, she supposed, that
she lacked some fine instinct.</p>

<p>There had been those young years of her mother's in Ireland; she
spoke of them sometimes but only vaguely, as though they were now
very far away, as though they had never seriously counted. And yet
she had been lovely, lovely Anna Molloy, much admired, much loved
and constantly courted&mdash;And her father, he too had been in the
world, in Rome, in Paris, and often in London&mdash;he had not
lived at Morton in those days; and how queer it seemed, there had
been a time when her father had actually not known her mother. They
had been completely unconscious of each other, he for twenty-nine
years, she for just over twenty, and yet all the while had been
drawing together, in spite of themselves, always nearer together.
Then had come that morning away in County Clare, when those two had
suddenly seen each other, and had known from that moment the
meaning of life, of love, just because they had seen each other.
Her father spoke very seldom of such things, but this much he had
told her, it had all grown quite clear&mdash;What had it felt like
when they realized each other? What did it feel like to see things
quite clearly, to know the innermost reason for things?</p>

<p>Morton&mdash;her mother had come home to Morton, to wonderful,
gently enfolding Morton. She had passed for the first time through
the heavy white doorway under the shining semicircular fanlight.
She had walked into the old square hall with its bear-skins, and
its pictures of funny, dressed-up looking Gordons&mdash;the hall
with the whip-rack where Stephen kept her whips&mdash;the hall with
the beautiful iridescent window, that looked over the lawns and
herbaceous borders. Then, perhaps hand in hand, they had passed
beyond the hall, her father a man, her mother a woman, with their
destiny already upon them&mdash;and that destiny of theirs had been
Stephen.</p>

<p>Ten years. For ten years they had just had each other, each
other and Morton&mdash;surely wonderful years. But what had they
been thinking about all those years? Had they perhaps thought a
little about Stephen? Oh, but what could she hope to know of these
things, their thoughts, their feelings, their secret
ambitions&mdash;she, who had not even been conceived, she, who had
not yet come into existence? They had lived in a world that her
eyes bad not looked on; days and nights had slipped into the weeks,
months and years. Time had existed, but she, Stephen, had not. They
had lived through that time; it had gone to their making; their
present had been the result of its travail, had sprung from its
womb as she from her mother's, only she had not been a part of that
travail, as she had been a part of her mother's. Hopeless! And yet
she must try to know them, these two, every inch of their hearts,
of their minds; and knowing them, she must then try to guard
them&mdash;but him first, oh, him first&mdash;she did not ask why,
she only knew that because she loved him as she did, he would
always have to come first. Love was simply like that; it just
followed its impulse and asked no questions&mdash;it was
beautifully simple. But for his sake she must also love the thing
that he loved, her mother, though this love was somehow quite
different; it was less hers than his, he had thrust it upon her; it
was not an integral part of her being. Nevertheless it too must be
served, for the happiness of one was that of the other. They were
indivisible, one flesh, one spirit, and whatever it was that had
crept in between them was trying to tear asunder this
oneness&mdash;that was why she, their child, must rise up and help
them if she could, for was she not the fruit of their oneness?</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>There were times when she would think that she must have been
mistaken, that no trouble was overshadowing her father; these would
be when they two were sitting in his study, for then he would seem
contented. Surrounded by his books, caressing their bindings, Sir
Philip would look care-free again and light-hearted.</p>

<p>'No friends in the world like books,' he would tell her. 'Look
at this fellow in his old leather jacket!'</p>

<p>There were times, too, out hunting when he seemed very young, as
Raftery had been that first season. But the ten-year-old Raftery
was now wiser than Sir Philip, who would often behave like a
foolhardy schoolboy. He would give Stephen leads over hair-raising
places, and then, she safely landed, turn round and grin at her. He
liked her to ride the pick of his hunters these days, and would
slyly show off her prowess. The sport would bring back the old
light to his eyes, and his eyes would look happy as they rested on
his daughter.</p>

<p>She would think: must have been terribly mistaken,' and would
feel a great peace surge over her spirit.</p>

<p>He might say, as they slowly jogged home to Morton: 'Did you
notice my youngster here take that stiff timber? Not bad for a
five-year-old, he'll do nicely.' And perhaps he might add: 'Put a
three on that five, and then tell your old sire that he's not so
bad either! I'm fifty-three, Stephen, I'll be going in the wind if
I don't knock off smoking quite soon, and that's certain!'</p>

<p>Then Stephen would know that her father felt young, very young,
and was wanting her to flatter him a little.</p>

<p>But this mood would not last; it had often quite changed by the
time 'that the two of them reached the stables. She would notice
with a sudden pain in her heart that he stooped when he walked, not
much yet, but a little. And she loved his broad back, she had
always loved it&mdash;a kind, reassuring protective back. Then the
thought would come that perhaps its great kindness had caused it to
stoop as though bearing a burden; and the thought would come: 'He
is bearing a burden, not his own, it's someone else's&mdash;but
whose?'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Christmas came and with it the girl's eighteenth birthday, but
the shadows that clung round her home did not lessen; nor could
Stephen, groping about in those shadows, find a way to win through
to the light. Everyone tried to be cheerful and happy, as even sad
people will do at Christmas, while the gardeners brought in huge
bundles of holly with which to festoon the portraits of
Gordons&mdash;rich, red-berried holly that came from the hills, and
that year after year would be sent down to Morton. The
courageous-eyed Gordons looked out from their wreaths unsmiling, as
though they were thinking of Stephen.</p>

<p>In the hall stood the Christmas-tree of her childhood, for Sir
Philip loved the old German custom which would seem to insist that
even the aged be as children and play with God on His birthday. At
the top of the tree swung the little wax Christ-child in His
spangled nightgown with gold and blue ribbons; and the little wax
Christ-child bent downwards and sideways because, although small,
He was rather heavy&mdash;or, as Stephen had thought when she too
had been small, because He was trying to look for His presents.</p>

<p>In the morning they all went to church in the village, and the
church smelt of coldness and freshly bruised green stuff&mdash;of
the laurel and holly and pungent pine branches, that wreathed the
oak pulpit and framed the altar; and the anxious-faced eagle who
must carry the Scriptures on his wings, he too was looking quite
festive. Very redolent of England it was, that small church, with
its apple-cheeked choirboys in newly washed garments; with its
young Oxford parson who in summer played cricket to the glory of
God and the good of the county; with its trim congregation of
neighbouring gentry who had recently purchased an excellent organ,
so that now they could hear the opening bars of the hymns with a
feeling of self-satisfaction, but with something else too that came
nearer to Heaven, because of those lovely old songs of Christmas.
The choir raised their sexless untroubled voices: 'While shepherds
watched their flocks...' sang the choir; and Anna's soft mezzo
mingled and blended with her husband's deep boom and Puddle's
soprano. Then Stephen sang too for the sheer joy of singing, though
her voice at best was inclined to be husky: 'While shepherds
watched their flocks by night,' carolled Stephen&mdash;for some
reason thinking of Raftery.</p>

<p>After church the habitual Christmas greetings: 'Merry
Christmas,' 'Merry Christmas.' Same to you, many of them!' Then
home to Morton and the large mid-day dinner&mdash;turkey, plum
pudding with its crisp brandy butter, and the mince-pies that
invariably gave Puddle indigestion. Then dessert with all sorts of
sweet fruits out of boxes, crystallized fruits that made your hands
sticky, together with fruit from the Morton green-houses; and from
somewhere that no one could ever remember, the elegant miniature
Lady-apples that you ate skins and all in two bites if you were
greedy.</p>

<p>A long afternoon spent in waiting for darkness when Anna could
light the Christmas-tree candles; and no ringing of bells to
disturb the servants, not until they must all file in for their
presents which were piled up high round the base of the tree on
which Anna would light the small candles. Dusk&mdash;draw the
curtains, it was dark enough now, and someone must go and fetch
Anna the taper, but she must take care of the little wax
Christ-child, Who liked many lights even though they should melt
Him.</p>

<p>'Stephen, climb up, will you, and tie back the Christ-child. His
toe is almost touching that candle!'</p>

<p>Then Anna applying the long lighted taper from branch to branch,
very slowly and gravely, as though she accomplished some ritual, as
though she herself were a ministering priestess&mdash;Anna very
slender and tall in a dress whose soft folds swept her limbs and
lay round her ankles.</p>

<p>'Ring three times, will you, Philip? I think they're all
lighted&mdash;no, wait&mdash;all right now, I'd missed that top
candle. Stephen, begin to sort out the presents, please, dear, your
father's just rung for the servants. Oh, and Puddle, you might push
over the table, I may need it&mdash;no, not that one, the table by
the window&mdash;'</p>

<p>A subdued sound of voices, a stifled giggle. The servants filing
in through the green baize door, and only the butler and footmen
familiar in appearance, the others all strangers in mufti. Mrs.
Wilson, the cook, in black silk with jet trimming, the scullery
maid in electric blue cashmere, one housemaid in mauve, another in
green, and the upper of three in dark terra-cotta, while Anna's own
maid wore an old dress of Anna's. Then the men from outside, from
the gardens and stables&mdash;men bare-headed who were usually seen
in their caps&mdash;old Williams displaying a widening bald patch,
and wearing tight trousers instead of his breeches; old Williams
walking stiffly because his new suit felt like cardboard, and
because his white collar was too high, and because his hard,
made-up black bow would slip crooked. The grooms and the boys, all
exceedingly shiny from their neatly oiled heads to their
well-polished noses&mdash;the boys very awkward, short-sleeved and
rough-handed, shuffling a little because trying not to. And the
gardeners led in by the grave Mr. Hopkins, who wore black of a
Sunday and carried a Church Service, and whose knowledge of the
ills that all grape-flesh is heir to, had given his face a patient,
pained expression. Men smelling of soil these, in spite of much
scrubbing; men whose necks and whose hands were crossed and
recrossed by a network of tiny and earth-clogged furrows&mdash;men
whose backs would bend early from tending the earth. There they
stood in the wake of the grave Mr. Hopkins, with their eyes on the
big, lighted Christmas-tree, while they never so much as glanced at
the flowers that had sprung from many long hours of their labour.
No, instead they must just stand and gape at the tree, as though
with its candles and Christ-child and all, it were some strange
exotic plant in Kew Gardens.</p>

<p>Then Anna called her people by name, and to each one she gave
the gifts of that Christmas; and they thanked her, thanked Stephen
and thanked Sir Philip; and Sir Philip thanked them for their
faithful service, as had always been the good custom at Morton for
more years than Sir Philip himself could remember. Thus the day had
passed by in accordance with tradition, every one from the highest
to the lowest remembered; nor had Anna forgotten her gifts for the
village&mdash;warm shawls, sacks of coal, cough mixture and sweets.
Sir Philip had sent a cheque to the vicar, which would keep him for
a long time in cricketing flannels; and Stephen had carried a
carrot to Raftery and two lumps of sugar to the fat, aged Coffins,
who because he was all but blind in one eye, had bitten her hand in
place of his sugar. And Puddle had written at great length to a
sister who lived down in Cornwall and whom she neglected, except on
such memory-jogging occasions as Christmas, when somehow we always
remember. And the servants had gorged themselves to repletion, and
the hunters had rested in their hay-scented stables; while out in
the fields, seagulls, come far inland, had feasted in their turn on
humbler creatures&mdash;grubs and slugs, and other unhappy small
fry, much relished by birds and hated by farmers.</p>

<p>Night closed down on the house, and out of the darkness came the
anxious young voices of village schoolchildren: 'Noel, Noel&mdash;'
piped the anxious young voices lubricated by sweets from the lady
of Morton. Sir Philip stirred the logs in the hall to a blaze,
while Anna sank into a deep chair and watched them. Her hands that
were wearied by much ministration, lay over the arms of the chair
in the firelight, and the firelight sought out the rings on her
hands, and it played with the whiter flames in her diamonds. Then
Sir Philip stood up, and he gazed at his wife, while she stared at
the logs not appearing to notice him; but Stephen, watching in
silence from her corner, seemed to see a dark shadow that stole in
between them&mdash;beyond this her vision was mercifully dim,
otherwise she must surely have recognized that shadow.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>On new year's eve Mrs. Antrim gave a dance in order, or so she
said, to please Violet, who was still rather young to attend the
hunt balls, but who dearly loved gaiety, especially dancing. Violet
was plump, pert and adolescent, and had lately insisted on putting
her hair up. She liked men, who in consequence always liked her,
for like begets like when it comes to the sexes, and Violet was
full of what people call 'allure', or in simpler language, of
sexual attraction. Roger was home for Christmas from Sandhurst, so
that he would be there to assist his mother. He was now nearly
twenty, a good-looking youth with a tiny moustache which he
tentatively fingered. He assumed the grand air of the man of the
world who has actually weathered about nineteen summers. He was
hoping to join his regiment quite soon, which greatly augmented his
self-importance.</p>

<p>Could Mrs. Antrim have ignored Stephen Gordon's existence, she
would almost certainly have done so. She disliked the girl; she had
always disliked her; what she called Stephen's 'queerness' aroused
her suspicion&mdash;she was never quite clear as to what she
suspected, but felt sure it must be something outlandish: 'A young
woman of her age to ride like a man, I call it preposterous!'
declared Mrs. Antrim.</p>

<p>It can safely be said that Stephen at eighteen had in no way
outgrown her dread of the Antrim; there was only one member of that
family who liked her, she knew, and that was the small, hen-pecked
Colonel. He liked her because, a fine horseman himself, he admired
her skill and her courage out hunting.</p>

<p>'It's a pity she's so tall, of course&mdash;' he would grumble,
'but she does know a horse and how to stick on one. Now my children
might have been brought up at Margate, they're just about fitted to
ride the beach donkeys!'</p>

<p>But Colonel Antrim would not count at the dance; indeed in his
own house he very seldom counted. Stephen would have to endure Mrs.
Antrim and Violet&mdash;and then Roger was home from Sandhurst.
Their antagonism had never quite died, perhaps because it was too
fundamental. Now they covered it up with a cloak of good manners,
but these two were still enemies at heart, and they knew it. No,
Stephen did not want to go to that dance, though she went in order
to please her mother. Nervous, awkward and apprehensive, Stephen
arrived at the Antrims that night, little thinking that Fate, the
most expert of tricksters, was waiting to catch her just round the
corner. Yet so it was, for during that evening Stephen met Martin
and Martin met Stephen, and their meeting was great with portent
for them both, though neither of them could know it.</p>

<p>It all happened quite simply as such things will happen. It was
Roger who introduced Martin Hallam; it was Stephen who explained
that she danced very badly; it was Martin who suggested that they
sit out their dances. Then&mdash;how quickly it occurs if the thing
is predestined&mdash;they suddenly knew that they liked each other,
that some chord had been struck to a pleasant vibration; and this
being so they sat out many dances, and they talked for quite a long
while that evening.</p>

<p>Martin lived in British Columbia, it seemed, where he owned
several farms and a number of orchards. He had gone out there after
the death of his mother, for six months, but had stayed on for love
of the country. And now he was having a holiday in
England&mdash;that was how he had got to know young Roger Antrim,
they had met up in London and Roger had asked him to come down for
a week, and so here he was&mdash;but it felt almost strange to be
back again in England. Then he talked of the vastness of that new
country that was yet so old; of its snow-capped mountains, of its
canyons and gorges, of its deep, princely rivers, of its lakes,
above all of its mighty forests. And when Martin spoke of those
mighty forests, his voice changed, it became almost reverential;
for this young man loved trees with a primitive instinct, with a
strange and inexplicable devotion. Because he liked Stephen he
could talk of his trees, and because she liked him she could listen
while he talked, feeling that she too would love his great
forests.</p>

<p>His face was very young, clean-shaven and bony; he had bony,
brown hands with spatulate fingers; for the rest, he was tall with
a loosely knit figure, and he slouched a little when he walked from
much riding. But his face had a charming quality about it,
especially when he talked of his trees; it glowed, it seemed to be
inwardly kindled, and it asked for a real and heart-felt
understanding of the patience and the beauty and the goodness of
trees&mdash;it was eager for your understanding. Yet in spite of
this touch of romance in his make-up, which he could not keep out
of his voice at moments, he spoke simply, as one man will speak to
another, very simply, not trying to create an impression. He talked
about trees as some men talk of ships, because they love them and
the element they stand for. And Stephen, the awkward, the bashful,
the tongue-tied, heard herself talking in her turn, quite freely,
heard herself asking him endless questions about forestry, farming
and the care of vast orchards; thoughtful questions, unromantic but
apt&mdash;such as one man will ask of another.</p>

<p>Then Martin wished to learn about her, and they talked of her
fencing, her studies, her riding, and she told him about Raftery
who was named for the poet. And all the while she felt natural and
happy because here was a man who was taking her for granted, who
appeared to find nothing eccentric about her or her tastes, but who
quite simply took her for granted. Had you asked Martin Hallam to
explain why it was that he accepted the girl at her own valuation,
he would surely have been unable to tell you&mdash;it had happened,
that was all, and there the thing ended. But whatever the reason,
he felt drawn to this friendship that had leapt so suddenly into
being.</p>

<p>Before Anna left the dance with her daughter, she invited the
young man to drive over and see them; and Stephen felt glad of that
invitation, because now she could share her new friend with Morton.
She said to Morton that night in her bedroom: 'I know you're going
to like Martin Hallam.'</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter Eleven</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Martin went to Morton, he went very often, for Sir Philip liked
him and encouraged the friendship. Anna liked Martin too, and she
made him feel welcome because he was young and had lost his mother.
She spoilt him a little, as a woman will spoil who, having no son
must adopt someone else's, so to Anna he went with all his small
troubles, and she doctored him when he caught a bad chill out
hunting. He instinctively turned to her in such things, but never,
in spite of their friendship, to Stephen.</p>

<p>Yet now he and Stephen were always together, he was staying on
and on at the hotel in Upton; ostensibly staying because of the
hunting; in reality staying because of Stephen who was filling a
niche in his life long empty, the niche reserved for the perfect
companion. A queer, sensitive fellow this Martin Hallam, with his
strange love of trees and primitive forests, not a man to make many
intimate friends, and in consequence a man to be lonely. He knew
little about books and had been a slack student, but Stephen and he
had other things in common; he rode well, and he cared for and
understood horses; he fenced well and would quite often now fence
with Stephen; nor did he appear to resent it when she beat him;
indeed he seemed to accept it as natural, and would merely laugh at
his own lack of skill. Out hunting these two would keep close to
each other, and would ride home together as far as Upton; or
perhaps he would go to Morton with her, for Anna was always glad to
see Martin. Sir Philip gave him the freedom of the stables, and
even old Williams forbore to grumble:</p>

<p>''E be trusty, that's what 'e be,' declared Williams, 'and the
horses knows it and acts accordin'.'</p>

<p>But sport was not all that drew Stephen to Martin, for his mind,
like hers, was responsive to beauty, and she taught him the
countryside that she loved, from Upton to Castle Morton
common&mdash;the common that lies at the foot of the hills. But far
beyond Castle Morton she took him. They would ride down the winding
lane to Bromsberrow, then crossing the small stream at Clincher's
Mill, jog home through the bare winter woods of Eastnor. And she
taught him the hills whose plentiful bosoms had made Anna think of
green-girdled mothers, mothers of sons, as she sat and watched
them, great with the child who should have been her son. They
climbed the venerable Worcestershire Beacon that stands guardian of
all the seven Malverns, or wandered across the hills of the Wells
to the old British Camp above the Wye Valley. The Valley would lie
half in light, half in shadow, and beyond would be Wales and the
dim Black Mountains. Then Stephen's heart would tighten a little,
as it always had done because of that beauty, so that one day she
said:</p>

<p>'When I was a child, this used to make me want to cry,
Martin.'</p>

<p>And he answered: Some part of us always sheds tears when we see
lovely things&mdash;they make us regretful.' But when she asked him
why this should be, he shook his head slowly, unable to tell
her.</p>

<p>Sometimes they walked through Hollybush woods, then on up
Raggedstone, a hill grim with legend&mdash;its shadow would bring
misfortune or death to those it fell on, according to legend.
Martin would pause to examine the thorn trees, ancient thorns that
had weathered many a hard winter. He would touch them with gentle,
pitying fingers:</p>

<p>'Look, Stephen&mdash;the courage of these old fellows! They're
all twisted and crippled; it hurts me to see them, yet they go on
patiently doing their bit&mdash;have you ever thought about the
enormous courage of trees? I have, and it seems to me amazing. The
Lord dumps them down and they've just got to stick it, no matter
what happens&mdash;that must need some courage!' And one day he
said: 'Don't think me quite mad, but if we survive death then the
trees will survive it; there must be some sort of a forest heaven
for all the faithful&mdash;the faithful of trees. I expect they
take their birds along with them; why not? "And in death they were
not divided."' Then he laughed, but she saw that his eyes were
quite grave, so she asked him:</p>

<p>'Do you believe in God, Martin?'</p>

<p>And he answered: 'Yes, because of His trees. Don't you?' 'I'm
not sure&mdash;'</p>

<p>Oh, my poor, blind Stephen! Look again, go on looking until you
do believe.'</p>

<p>They discussed many things quite simply together, for between
these two was no vestige of shyness. His youth met hers and walked
hand in hand with it, so that she knew how utterly lonely her own
youth had been before the coming of Martin.</p>

<p>She said: 'You're the only real friend I've ever had, except
Father&mdash;our friendship's so wonderful, somehow&mdash;we're
like brothers, we enjoy all the same sort of things.'</p>

<p>He nodded: 'I know, a wonderful friendship.'</p>

<p>The hills must let Stephen tell him their secrets, the secrets
of by-paths most cunningly hidden; the secrets of small,
unsuspected green hollows; the secrets of ferns that live only by
hiding. She might even reveal the secrets of birds, and show him
the playground of shy, spring cuckoos.</p>

<p>'They fly quite low up here, one can see them; last year a
couple flew right past me, calling. If you were not going away so
soon, Martin, we'd come later on&mdash;I'd love you to see
them.'</p>

<p>'And I'd love you to see my huge forests,' he told her, 'why
can't you come back to Canada with me? What rot it is, all this
damned convention; we're such pals you and I, I'll be desperately
lonely&mdash;Lord, what a fool of a world we live in!'</p>

<p>And she said quite simply: 'I'd love to come with you.'</p>

<p>Then he started to tell her about his huge forests, so vast that
their greenness seemed almost eternal. Great trees he told of,
erect, towering firs, many centuries old and their girth that of
giants. And then there were all the humbler tree-folk whom he spoke
of as friends that were dear and familiar; the hemlocks that grow
by the courses of rivers, in love with adventure and clear running
water; the slender white spruces that border the lakes; the red
pines, that glow like copper in the sunset. Unfortunate trees these
beautiful red pines, for their tough, manly wood is coveted by
builders.</p>

<p>'But I won't have my roof-tree hacked from their sides,'
declared Martin, 'I'd feel like a positive assassin!'</p>

<p>Happy days spent between the hills and the stables, happy days
for these two who had always been lonely until now, and now this
wonderful friendship&mdash;there had never been anything like it
for Stephen. Oh, but it was good to have him beside her, so young,
so strong and so understanding. She liked his quiet voice with its
careful accent, and his thoughtful blue eyes that moved rather
slowly, so that his glance when it came, came
slowly&mdash;sometimes she would meet his glance half-way, smiling.
She who had longed for the companionship of men, for their
friendship, their good-will, their toleration, she had it all now
and much more in Martin, because of his great understanding.</p>

<p>She said to Puddle one night in the schoolroom: 'I've grown fond
of Martin&mdash;isn't that queer after only a couple of months of
friendship? But he's different somehow&mdash;when he's gone I shall
miss him!'</p>

<p>And her words had the strangest effect on Puddle who quite
suddenly beamed at Stephen and kissed her&mdash;Puddle, who never
betrayed her emotions, quite suddenly beamed at Stephen and kissed
her.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>People gossiped a little because of the freedom allowed Martin
and Stephen by her parents; but on the whole they gossiped quite
kindly, with a great deal of smiling and nodding of heads. After
all the girl was just like other girls&mdash;they almost ceased to
resent her. Meanwhile Martin continued to stay on in Upton, held
fast by the charm and the strangeness of Stephen&mdash;her very
strangeness it was that allured him, yet all the while he must
think of their friendship, not even admitting that strangeness. He
deluded himself with these thoughts of friendship, but Sir Philip
and Anna were not deluded. They looked at each other almost shyly
at first, then Anna grew bold, and she said to her husband:</p>

<p>'Is it possible the child is falling in love with Martin? Of
course he's in love with her. Oh, my dear, it would make me so
awfully happy&mdash;' And her heart went out in affection to
Stephen, as it had not done since the girl was a baby.</p>

<p>Her hopes would go flying ahead of events; she would start
making plans for her daughter's future. Martin must give up his
orchards and forests and buy Tenley Court that was now in the
market; it had several large farms and some excellent pasture,
quite enough to keep any man happy and busy. Then Anna would
suddenly grow very thoughtful; Tenley Court was also possessed of
fine nurseries, big, bright, sunny rooms facing south, with their
bathroom, there were bars to the windows&mdash;it was all there and
ready.</p>

<p>Sir Philip shook his head and warned Anna to go slowly, but he
could not quite keep the great joy from his eyes, nor the hope from
his heart. Had he been mistaken? Perhaps after all he had been
mistaken&mdash;the hope thudded ceaselessly now in his heart.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Came a day when winter must give place to spring, when the
daffodils marched across the whole country from Castle Morton
Common to Ross and beyond, pitching camps by the side of the river.
When the hornbeam made patches of green in the hedges, and the
hawthorn broke out into small, budding bundles; when the old cedar
tree on the lawn at Morton grew reddish-pink tips to its elegant
fingers; when the wild cherry trees on the sides of the hills were
industriously putting forth both leaves and blossoms; when Martin
looked into his heart and saw Stephen&mdash;saw her suddenly there
as a woman.</p>

<p>Friendship! He marvelled now at his folly, at his blindness, his
coldness of body and spirit. He had offered this girl the cold
husks of his friendship, insulting her youth, her womanhood, her
beauty&mdash;for he saw her now with the eyes of a lover. To a man
such as he was, sensitive, restrained, love came as a blinding
revelation. He knew little about women, and the little he did know
was restricted to episodes that he thought best forgotten. On the
whole he had led a fairly chaste life&mdash;less from scruple than
because he was fastidious by nature. But now he was very deeply in
love, and those years of restraint took their toll of poor Martin,
so that he trembled before his own passion, amazed at its strength,
not a little disconcerted. And being by habit a quiet, reserved
creature, he must quite lose his head and become the reverse. So
impatient was he that he rushed off to Morton very early one
morning to look for Stephen, tracking her down in the end at the
stables, where he found her talking to Williams and Raftery.</p>

<p>He said: 'Never mind about Raftery, Stephen&mdash;let's go into
the garden, I've got something to tell you.' And she thought that
he must have had bad news from home, because of his voice and his
curious pallor.</p>

<p>She went with him and they walked on in silence for a while,
then Martin stood still, and began to talk quickly; he was saying
amazing, incredible things: Stephen, my dear&mdash;I do utterly
love you.' He was holding out his arms, while she shrank back
bewildered: 'I love you, I'm deeply in love with you,
Stephen&mdash;look at me, don't you understand me, beloved? I want
you to marry me&mdash;you do love me, don't you?' And then, as
though she had suddenly struck him, he flinched: 'Good God! What's
the matter, Stephen?'</p>

<p>She was staring at him in a kind of dumb horror, staring at his
eyes that were clouded by desire, while gradually over her
colourless face there was spreading an expression of the deepest
repulsion&mdash;terror and repulsion he saw on her face, and
something else too, a look as of outrage. He could not believe this
thing that he saw, this insult to all that he felt to be sacred;
for a moment he in his turn, must stare, then he came a step
nearer, still unable to believe. But at that she wheeled round and
fled from him wildly, fled back to the house that had always
protected; without so much as a word she left him, nor did she once
pause in her flight to look back. Yet even in this moment of
headlong panic, the girl was conscious of something like amazement,
amazement at herself; and she gasped as she ran: 'It's
Martin&mdash;Martin&mdash;' And again: 'It's Martin!'</p>

<p>He stood perfectly still until the trees hid her. He felt
stunned, incapable of understanding. All that he knew was that he
must get away, away from Stephen, away from Morton, away from the
thoughts that would follow after. In less than two hours he was
motoring to London; in less than two weeks he was standing on the
deck of the steamer that would carry him back to his forests that
lay somewhere beyond the horizon.</p>

<h3><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter Twelve</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>No one questioned at Morton; they spoke very little. Even Anna
forbore to question her daughter, checked by something that she saw
in the girl's pale face.</p>

<p>But alone with her husband she gave way to her misgivings, to
her deep disappointment: 'It's heartbreaking, Philip. What's
happened? They seemed so devoted to each other. Will you ask the
child? Surely one of us ought to&mdash;'</p>

<p>Sir Philip said quietly: 'I think Stephen will tell me.' And
with that Anna had perforce to be content.</p>

<p>Very silently Stephen now went about Morton, and her eyes looked
bewildered and deeply unhappy. At night she would lie awake
thinking of Martin, missing him, mourning him as though he were
dead. But she could not accept this death without question, without
feeling that she was in some way blameworthy. What was she, what
manner of curious creature, to have been so repelled by a lover
like Martin? Yet she had been repelled, and even her pity for the
man could not wipe out that stronger feeling. She had driven him
away because something within her was intolerant of that new aspect
of Martin.</p>

<p>Oh, but she mourned his good, honest friendship; he had taken
that from her, the thing she most needed&mdash;but perhaps after
all it had never existed except as a cloak for this other emotion.
And then, lying there in the thickening darkness, she would shrink
from what might be waiting in the future, for all that had just
happened might happen again&mdash;there were other men in the world
beside Martin. Fool, never to have visualized this thing before,
never to have faced the possibility of it; now she understood her
resentment of men when their voices grew soft and insinuating. Yes,
and now she knew to the full the meaning of fear, and Martin it
was, who had taught her its meaning&mdash;her friend&mdash;the man
she had utterly trusted had pulled the scales from her eyes and
revealed it. Fear, stark fear, and the shame of such
fear&mdash;that was the legacy left her by Martin. And yet he had
made her so happy at first, she had felt so contented, so natural
with him; but that was because they had been like two men,
companions, sharing each other's interests. And at this thought her
bitterness would all but flow over; it was cruel, it was cowardly
of him to have deceived her, when all the time he had only been
waiting for the chance to force this other thing on her.</p>

<p>But what was she?' Her thoughts slipping back to her childhood,
would find many things in her past that perplexed her. She had
never been quite like the other small children, she had always been
lonely and discontented, she had always been trying to be someone
else&mdash;that was why she had dressed herself up as young Nelson.
Remembering those days she would think of her father, and would
wonder if now, as then, he could help her. Supposing she should ask
him to explain about Martin? Her father was wise, and had infinite
patience&mdash;yet somehow she instinctively dreaded to ask him.
Alone&mdash;it was terrible to feel so much alone&mdash;to feel
oneself different from other people. At one time she had rather
enjoyed this distinction&mdash;she had rather enjoyed dressing up
as young Nelson. Yet had she enjoyed it? Or had it been done as
some sort of inadequate childish protest a But if so against what
had she been protesting when she strutted about the house,
masquerading? In those days she had wanted to be a boy&mdash;had
that been the meaning of the pitiful young Nelson? And what about
now? She had wanted Martin to treat her as a man, had expected it
of him...The questions to which she could find no answers, would
pile themselves up and up in the darkness; oppressing, stifling by
sheer weight of numbers, until she would feel them getting her
under; 'I don't know&mdash;oh, God, I don't know!' she would
mutter, tossing as though to fling off those questions.</p>

<p>Then one night towards dawn she could bear it no longer; her
dread must give place to her need of consolation. She would ask her
father to explain her to herself; she would tell him her deep
desolation over Martin. She would say: Is there anything strange
about me, Father, that I should have felt as I did about Martin?'
And then she would try to explain very calmly what it was she had
felt, the intensity of it. She would try to make him understand her
suspicion that this feeling of hers was a thing fundamental, much
more than merely not being in love; much, much more than not
wanting to marry Martin. She would tell him why she found herself
so utterly bewildered; tell him how she had loved Martin's strong,
young body, and his honest brown face, and his slow thoughtful
eyes, and his careless walk&mdash;all these things she had loved.
Then suddenly terror and deep repugnance because of that unforeseen
change in Martin, the change that had turned the friend into the
lover&mdash;in reality it had been no more than that, the friend
had turned lover and had wanted from her what she could not give
him, or indeed any man, because of that deep repugnance. Yet there
should have been nothing repugnant about Martin, nor was she a
child to have felt such terror. She had known certain facts about
life for some time and they had not repelled her in other
people&mdash;not until they had been brought home to herself had
these facts both terrified and repelled her.</p>

<p>She got up. No good in trying to sleep, those eternal questions
kept stifling, tormenting. Dressing quickly she stole down the
wide, shallow stairs to the garden door, then out into the garden.
The garden looked unfamiliar in the sunrise, like a well-known face
that is suddenly transfigured. There was something aloof and
awesome about it, as though it were lost in ecstatic devotion. She
tried to tread softly for she felt apologetic, she and her troubles
were there as intruders; their presence disturbed this strange hush
of communion, this oneness with something beyond their knowledge,
that was yet known and loved by the soul of the garden. A
mysterious and wonderful thing this oneness, pregnant with comfort
could she know its true meaning&mdash;she felt this somewhere deep
down in herself; but try as she would her mind could not grasp it;
perhaps even the garden was shutting her out of its prayers,
because she had sent away Martin. Then a thrush began to sing in
the cedar, and his song was full of wild jubilation: Stephen, look
at me, look at me!' sang the thrush, 'I'm happy, happy, it's all
very simple!' There was something heartless about that singing
which only served to remind her of Martin. She walked on
disconsolate, thinking deeply. He had gone, he would soon be back
in his forests&mdash;she had made no effort to keep him beside her
because he had wanted to be her lover...'Stephen, look at us, look
at us!' sang the birds, 'We're happy, happy, it's all very simple!'
Martin walking in dim, green places&mdash;she could picture his
life away in the forests, a man's life, good with the goodness of
danger, a primitive, strong, imperative thing&mdash;a man's life,
the life that should have been hers&mdash;And her eyes filled with
heavy, regretful tears, yet she did not quite know for what she was
weeping. She only knew that some great sense of loss, some great
sense of incompleteness possessed her, and she let the tears
trickle down her face, wiping them off one by one with her
finger.</p>

<p>And now she was passing the old potting shed where Collins had
lain in the arms of the footman. Choking back her tears she paused
by the shed, and tried to remember the girl's appearance. Grey
eyes&mdash;no, blue, and a round-about figure&mdash;plump hands,
with soft skin always puckered from soap-suds&mdash;a housemaid's
knee that had pained very badly: See that dent? That's the
water...It fair makes me sick.' Then a queer little girl dressed up
as young Nelson: 'I'd like to be awfully hurt for you, Collins, the
way that Jesus was hurt for sinners...' The potting shed smelling
of earth and dampness, sagging a little on one side,
lop-sided&mdash;Collins lying in the arms of the footman, Collins
being kissed by him, wantonly, crudely&mdash;a broken flower pot in
the hand of a child&mdash;rage, deep rage&mdash;a great anguish of
spirit&mdash;blood on a face that was pale with amazement, very
bright red blood that kept trickling and trickling&mdash;flight,
wild, inarticulate flight, away and away, anyhow,
anywhere&mdash;the pain of torn skin, the rip of torn
stockings&mdash;</p>

<p>She had not remembered these things for years, she had thought
that all this had been quite forgotten; there was nothing to remind
her of Collins these days but a fat, half-blind and pampered old
pony. Strange how these memories came back this morning; she had
lain in bed lately trying to recapture the childish emotions
aroused in her by Collins and had failed, yet this morning they
came back quite clearly. But the garden was full of a new memory
now; it was full of sorrowful memory of Martin. She turned
abruptly, and leaving the shed walked towards the lakes that
gleamed faintly in the distance.</p>

<p>Down by the lakes there was a sense of great stillness which the
songs of the birds could in no way lessen, for this place had that
curious stillness of spirit that seems to interpenetrate sound. A
swan paddled about in front of his island, on guard, for his mate
had a nest full of cygnets; from time to time he glanced crossly at
Stephen though he knew her quite well, but now there were cygnets.
He was proud in his splendid, incredible whiteness, and paternity
made him feel overbearing, so that he refused to feed from
Stephen's hand although she found a biscuit in her pocket.</p>

<p>'Coup, c-o-u-p!' she called, but he swung his neck sideways as
he swam&mdash;it was like a disdainful negation. 'Perhaps he thinks
I'm a freak,' she mused grimly, feeling more lonely because of the
swan.</p>

<p>The lakes were guarded by massive old beech trees, and the beech
trees stood ankle-deep in their foliage; a lovely and luminous
carpet of leaves they had spread on the homely brown earth of
Morton. Each spring came new little shuttles of greenness that in
time added warp and woof to the carpet, so that year by year it
grew softer and deeper, and year by year it glowed more
resplendent. Stephen had loved this spot from her childhood, and
now she instinctively went to it for comfort, but its beauty only
added to her melancholy, for beauty can wound like a two-edged
sword. She could not respond to its stillness of spirit, since she
could not lull her own spirit to stillness.</p>

<p>She thought: 'I shall never be one with great peace any more, I
shall always stand outside this stillness&mdash;wherever there is
absolute stillness and peace in this world, I shall always stand
just outside it.' And as though these thoughts were in some way
prophetic, she inwardly shivered a little.</p>

<p>Then what must the swan do but start to hiss loudly, just to
show her that he was really a father: 'Peter,' she reproached him,
'I won't hurt your babies&mdash;can't you trust me? I fed you the
whole of last winter!'</p>

<p>But apparently Peter could not trust her at all, for he squawked
to his mate who came out through the bushes, and she hissed in her
turn, flapping strong angry wings, which meant in mere language:
Get out of this, Stephen, you clumsy, inadequate, ludicrous
creature; you destroyer of nests, you disturber of young, you great
wingless blot on a beautiful morning!' Then they both hissed
together: Get out of this, Stephen!' So Stephen left them to the
care of their cygnets.</p>

<p>Remembering Raftery, she walked to the stables, where all was
confusion and purposeful bustle. Old Williams was ruthlessly out on
the warpath; he was scolding: 'Drat the boy, what be 'e a-doin'??
Come on, do! 'Urry up, get them two horses bridled, and don't go
forgettin' their knee-caps this mornin'&mdash;and that bucket there
don't belong where it's standin', nor that broom! Did Jim take the
roan to the blacksmith's? Gawd almighty, why not? 'Er shoes is like
paper! 'Ere, you Jim, don't you go on ignorin' my orders, if you
do&mdash;Come on, boy, got them two horses ready? Right, well then,
up you go! You don't want no saddle, like as not you'd give 'im a
gall if you 'ad one!'</p>

<p>The sleek, good-looking hunters were led out in
clothing&mdash;for the early spring mornings were still rather
nippy&mdash;and among them came Raftery, slender and skittish; he
was wearing his hood, and his eyes peered out bright as a falcon's
from the two neatly braided eye-holes. From a couple more holes in
the top of his head-dress, shot his small, pointed ears, which now
worked with excitement.</p>

<p>'Old on!' bellowed Williams, 'What the 'ell be you doin'? Quick,
shorten 'is bridle, yer not in a circus!' And then seeing Stephen:
'Beg pardon, Miss Stephen, but it be a fair crime not to lead that
horse close, and 'im all corned up until 'he's fair dancin'!'</p>

<p>They stood watching Raftery skip through the gates, then old
Williams said softly: ''E do be a wonder&mdash;more nor fifty odd
years 'ave I worked in the stables, and never no beast 'ave I loved
like Raftery. But 'e's no common horse, 'e be some sort of
Christian, and a better one too than a good few I knows
on&mdash;'</p>

<p>And Stephen answered: 'Perhaps he's a poet like his namesake; I
think if he could write he'd write verses. They say all the Irish
are poets at heart, so perhaps they pass on the gift to their
horses.'</p>

<p>Then the two of them smiled, each a little embarrassed, but
their eyes held great friendship the one for the other, a
friendship of years now cemented by Raftery whom they
loved&mdash;and small wonder, for assuredly never did more gallant
or courteous horse step out of stable.</p>

<p>'Oh, well,' sighed Williams, 'I be gettin' that old&mdash;and
Raftery, 'e do be comin' eleven, but 'e don't feel it yet in 'is
limbs the way I does&mdash;me rheumatics 'as troubled me awful this
winter.'</p>

<p>She stayed on a little while, comforting Williams, then made her
way back to the house, very slowly. 'Poor Williams,' she thought,
'he is getting old, but thank the Lord nothing's the matter with
Raftery.'</p>

<p>The house lay full in a great slant of sunshine; it looked as
though it was sunning its shoulders. Glancing up, she came eye to
eye with the house, and she fancied that Morton was thinking about
her, for its windows seemed to be beckoning, inviting: Come home,
come home, come inside quickly, Stephen!' And as though they had
spoken, she answered: 'I'm coming,' and she quickened her lagging
steps to a run, in response to this most compassionate kindness.
Yes, she actually ran through the heavy white doorway under the
semicircular fanlight, and on up the staircase that led from the
hall in which hung the funny old portraits of Gordons&mdash;men
long dead and gone but still wonderfully living, since their
thoughts had fashioned the comeliness of Morton; since their loves
had made children from father to son&mdash;from father to son until
the advent of Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>That evening she went to her father's study, and when he looked
up she thought she was expected.</p>

<p>She said: 'I want to talk to you, Father.'</p>

<p>And he answered: 'I know&mdash;sit close to me, Stephen.'</p>

<p>He shaded his face with his long, thin hand, so that she could
not see his expression, yet it seemed to her that he knew quite
well why she had come to him in that study. Then she told him about
Martin, told him all that had happened, omitting no detail, sparing
him nothing. She openly mourned the friend who had failed her, and
herself she mourned for failing the lover&mdash;and Sir Philip
listened in absolute silence.</p>

<p>After she had spoken for quite a long time, she at length found
the courage to ask her question: 'Is there anything strange about
me, Father, that I should have felt as I did about Martin?'</p>

<p>It had come. It fell on his heart like a blow. The hand that was
shading his pale face trembled, for he felt a great trembling take
hold of his spirit. His spirit shrank back and cowered in his body,
so that it dared not look out on Stephen.</p>

<p>She was waiting, and now she was asking again: 'Father, is there
anything strange about me? I remember when I was a little
child&mdash;I was never quite like all the other
children&mdash;'</p>

<p>Her voice sounded apologetic, uncertain, and he knew that the
tears were not far from her eyes, knew that if he looked now he
would see her lips shaking, and the tears making ugly red stains on
her eyelids. His loins ached with pity for this fruit of his
loins&mdash;an insufferable aching, an intolerable pity. He was
frightened, a coward because of his pity, as he had been once long
ago with her mother. Merciful God! How could a man answer? What
could he say, and that man a father? He sat there inwardly
grovelling before her: 'Oh, Stephen, my child, my little, little
Stephen.' For now in his pity she seemed to him little, little and
utterly helpless again&mdash;he remembered her hands as the hands
of a baby, very small, very pink, with minute perfect
nails&mdash;he had played with her hands, exclaiming about them,
astonished because of their neat perfection: 'Oh, Stephen, my
little, little Stephen.' He wanted to cry out against God for this
thing; he wanted' to cry out: 'You have maimed my Stephen! What had
I done or my father before me, or my father's father, or his
father's father? Unto the third and fourth generations...' And
Stephen was waiting for his answer. Then Sir Philip set the lips of
his spirit to the cup, and his spirit must drink the gall of
deception: 'I will not tell her. You cannot ask it&mdash;there are
some things that even God should not ask.'</p>

<p>And now he turned round and deliberately faced her; smiling
right into her eyes he lied glibly: 'My dear, don't be foolish,
there's nothing strange about you, some day you may meet a man you
can love. And supposing you don't, well, what of it, Stephen?
Marriage isn't the only career for a woman. I've been thinking
about your writing just lately, and I'm going to let you go up to
Oxford; but meanwhile you mustn't get foolish fancies, that won't
do at all&mdash;it's not like you, Stephen.' She was gazing at him
and he turned away quickly: 'Darling, I'm busy, you must leave me,'
he faltered.</p>

<p>Thank you,' she said very quietly and simply, 'I felt that I had
to ask you about Martin&mdash;'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>After she had gone he sat on alone, and the lie was still bitter
to his spirit as he sat there, and he covered his face for the
shame that was in him&mdash;but because of the love that was in him
he wept.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter Thirteen</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>There was gossip in plenty over Martin's disappearance, and to
this Mrs. Antrim contributed her share, even more than her share,
looking wise and mysterious whenever Stephen's name was mentioned.
Everyone felt very deeply aggrieved. They had been so eager to
welcome the girl as one of themselves, and now this strange
happening&mdash;it made them feel foolish which in turn made them
angry. The spring meets were heavy with tacit
disapproval&mdash;nice men like young Hallam did not run away for
nothing; and then what a scandal if those two were not engaged;
they had wandered all over the country together. This tacit
disapproval was extended to Sir Philip, and via him to Anna for
allowing too much freedom; a mother ought to look after her
daughter, but then Stephen had always been allowed too much
freedom. This, no doubt, was what came of her riding astride and
fencing and all the rest of the nonsense; when she did meet a man
she took the bit between her teeth and behaved in a most amazing
manner. Of course, had there been a proper engagement&mdash;but
obviously that had never existed. They marvelled, remembering their
own toleration, they had really been extremely broad-minded. An
extraordinary girl, she had always been odd, and now for some
reason she seemed odder than ever. Not so much as a word was said
in her hearing that could possibly offend, and yet Stephen well
knew that her neighbours' good-will had been only fleeting, a thing
entirely dependent upon Martin. He it was who had raised her status
among them&mdash;he, the stranger, not even connected with their
county. They had all decided that she meant to marry Martin, and
that fact had at once made them welcoming and friendly; and
suddenly Stephen longed intensely to be welcomed, and she wished
from her heart that she could have married Martin.</p>

<p>The strange thing was that she understood her neighbours in a
way, and was therefore too just to condemn them; indeed had nature
been less daring with her, she might well have become very much
what they were&mdash;a breeder of children, an upholder of home, a
careful and diligent steward of pastures. There was little of the
true pioneer about Stephen, in spite of her erstwhile longing for
the forests. She belonged to the soil and the fruitfulness of
Morton, to its pastures and paddocks, to its farms and its cattle,
to its quiet and gentlemanly ordered traditions, to the dignity and
pride of its old red-brick house, that was yet without ostentation.
To these things she belonged and would always belong by right of
those past generations of Gordons whose thoughts had fashioned the
comeliness of Morton, whose bodies had gone to the making of
Stephen. Yes, she was of them, those bygone people; they might
spurn her&mdash;the lusty breeders of sons that they had
been&mdash;they might even look down from Heaven with raised
eyebrows, and say: 'We utterly refuse to acknowledge this curious
creature called Stephen.' But for all that they could not drain her
of blood, and her blood was theirs also, so that do what they would
they could never completely rid themselves of her nor she of
them&mdash;they were one in their blood.</p>

<p>But Sir Philip, that other descendant of theirs, found little
excuse for his critical neighbours. Because he loved much he must
equally suffer, consuming himself at times with resentment. And now
when he and Stephen were out hunting he would be on his guard, very
anxious and watchful lest any small incident should occur to
distress her, lest at any time she should find herself lonely. When
hounds checked and the field collected together, he would make
little jokes to amuse his daughter, he would rack his brain for
these poor little jokes, in order that people should see Stephen
laughing.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would whisper: 'Let 'em have it hot, Stephen, that
youngster you're on loves a good bit of timber&mdash;don't mind me,
I know you won't damage his knees, just you give 'em a lead and
let's see if they'll catch you!' And because it was seldom indeed
that they caught her, his sore heart would know a fleeting
contentment.</p>

<p>Yet people begrudged her even this triumph, pointing out that
the girl was magnificently mounted: 'Anyone could get there on that
sort of horse,' they would murmur, when Stephen was out of
hearing.</p>

<p>But small Colonel Antrim, who was not always kind, would retort
if he heard them: 'Damn it, no, it's the riding. The girl rides,
that's the point; as for some of you others&mdash;' And then he
would let loose a flood of foul language. 'If some bloody fools
that I know rode like Stephen, we'd have bloody well less to pay to
the farmers,' and much more he would say to the same effect, with
rich oaths interlarding his every sentence&mdash;the
foulest-mouthed master in the whole British Isles he was said to
be, this small Colonel Antrim.</p>

<p>Oh, but he dearly loved a fine rider, and he cursed and he swore
his appreciation. Even in the presence of a sporting bishop one
day, he had failed to control his language; indeed, he had sworn in
the face of the bishop with enthusiasm, as he pointed to Stephen.
An ineffectual and hen-pecked little fellow&mdash;in his home he
was hardly allowed to say 'damn'. He was never permitted to smoke a
cigar outside of his dark, inhospitable study. He must not breed
Norwich canaries, which he loved, because they brought mice,
declared Mrs. Antrim; he must not keep a pet dog in the house, and
the Pink 'Un was anathema because of Violet. His taste in art was
heavily censored, even on the walls of his own water-closet, where
nothing might hang but a family group taken sixteen odd years ago
with the children.</p>

<p>On Sundays he sat in an uncomfortable pew while his wife chanted
psalms in the voice of a peacock. 'Oh come, let us sing unto the
Lord,' she would chant, as she heartily rejoiced in the strength of
her salvation. All this and a great deal more he endured, indeed
most of his life was passed in endurance&mdash;had it not been for
those red-letter days out hunting, he might well have become
melancholic from boredom. But those days, when he actually found
himself master, went far to restore his anaemic manhood, and on
them he would speak the good English language as some deep-seated
complex knew it ought to be spoken&mdash;ruddily, roundly,
explosively spoken, with elation, at times with total
abandon&mdash;especially if he should chance to remember Mrs.
Antrim would he speak it with total abandon.</p>

<p>But his oaths could not save Stephen now from her neighbours,
nothing could do that since the going of Martin&mdash;for quite
unknown to themselves they feared her; it was fear that aroused
their antagonism. In her they instinctively sensed an outlaw, and
theirs was the task of policing nature.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>In her vast drawing-room so beautifully proportioned, Anna would
sit with her pride sorely wounded, dreading the thinly veiled
questions of her neighbours, dreading the ominous silence of her
husband. And the old aversion she had felt for her child would
return upon her like the unclean spirit who gathered to himself
seven others more wicked, so that her last state was worse than her
first, and at times she must turn away her eyes from Stephen.</p>

<p>Thus tormented, she grew less tactful with her husband, and now
she was always plying him with questions: 'But why can't you tell
me what Stephen said to you, Philip, that evening when she went to
your study?'</p>

<p>And he, with a mighty effort to be patient, would answer: 'She
said that she couldn't love Martin&mdash;there was no crime in
that. Leave the child alone, Anna, she's unhappy enough; why not
let her alone?' And then he would hastily change the subject.</p>

<p>But Anna could not let Stephen alone, could never keep off the
topic of Martin. She would talk at the girl until she grew crimson;
and seeing this, Sir Philip would frown darkly, and when he and his
wife were alone in their bedroom he would often reproach her with
violence.</p>

<p>'Cruel&mdash;it's abominably cruel of you, Anna. Why in God's
name must you go on nagging Stephen?'</p>

<p>Anna's taut nerves would tighten to breaking, so that she, when
she answered, must also speak with violence.</p>

<p>One night he said abruptly: Stephen won't marry&mdash;I don't
want her to marry; it would only mean disaster.'</p>

<p>And at this Anna broke out in angry protest. Why shouldn't
Stephen marry? She wished her to marry. Was he mad? And what did he
mean by disaster? No woman was ever complete without
marriage&mdash;what on earth did he mean by disaster He frowned and
refused to answer her question. Stephen, he said, must go up to
Oxford. He had set his heart on a good education for the child, who
might some day become a fine writer. Marriage wasn't the only
career for a woman. Look at Puddle, for instance; she'd been at
Oxford&mdash;a most admirable, well-balanced, sensible creature.
Next year he was going to send Stephen to Oxford. Anna scoffed:
'Yes, indeed, he might well look at Puddle! She was what came of
this higher education&mdash;a lonely, unfulfilled, middle-aged
spinster. Anna didn't want that kind of life for her daughter.</p>

<p>And then: It's a pity you can't be frank, Philip, about what was
said that night in your study. I feel that there's something you're
keeping back from me&mdash;it's so unlike Martin to behave as he
has done; there must have been something that you haven't told me,
to have made him go off without even a letter&mdash;'</p>

<p>He flared up at once because he felt guilty: 'I don't care a
damn about Martin!' he said hotly. 'All I care about is Stephen,
and she's going to Oxford next year; she's my child as well as
yours, Anna!'</p>

<p>Then quite suddenly Anna's self-control left her, and she let
him see into her tormented spirit; all that had lain unspoken
between them she now put into crude, ugly words for his hearing:
'You care nothing for me any more&mdash;you and Stephen are
enleagued against me&mdash;you have been for years.' Aghast at
herself; she must yet go on speaking: 'You and Stephen&mdash;oh,
I've seen it for years&mdash;you and Stephen.' He looked at her,
and there was warning in his eyes, but she babbled on wildly: 'I've
seen it for years&mdash;the cruelty of it; she's taken you from me,
my own child&mdash;the unspeakable cruelty of it!'</p>

<p>Cruelty, yes, but not Stephen's, Anna&mdash;it's yours; for in
all the child's life you've never loved her.'</p>

<p>Ugly, degrading, rather terrible half-truths; and he knew the
whole truth, yet he dared not speak it. It is bad for the soul to
know itself a coward, it is apt to take refuge in mere wordy
violence.</p>

<p>'Yes, you, her mother, you persecute Stephen, you torment her; I
sometimes think you hate her!'</p>

<p>'Philip&mdash;good God!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I think you hate her; but be careful, Anna, for hatred
breeds hatred, and remember I stand for the rights of my
child&mdash;if you hate her you've got to hate me; she's my child.
I won't let her face your hatred alone.'</p>

<p>Ugly, degrading, rather terrible half-truths. Their hearts ached
while their lips formed recriminations. Their hearts burst into
tears while their eyes remained dry and accusing, staring in
hostility and anger. Far into the night they accused each other,
they who before had never seriously quarrelled; and something very
like the hatred he spoke of leapt out like a flame that seared them
at moments.</p>

<p>Stephen, my own child&mdash;she's come between us.'</p>

<p>'It's you who have thrust her between us, Anna.'</p>

<p>Mad, it was madness! They were such faithful lovers, and their
love it was that had fashioned their child. They knew that it was
madness and yet they persisted, while their anger dug out for
itself a deep channel, so that future angers might more easily
follow. They could not forgive and they could not sleep, for
neither could sleep without the other's forgiveness, and the hatred
that leapt out at moments between them would be drowned in the
tears that their hearts were shedding.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Like some vile and prolific thing, this first quarrel bred
others, and the peace of Morton was shattered. The house seemed to
mourn, and withdraw into itself, so that Stephen went searching for
its spirit in vain. 'Morton,' she whispered, where are you, Morton?
I must find you, I need you so badly.'</p>

<p>For now Stephen knew the cause of their quarrels, and she
recognized the form of the shadow that had seemed to creep in
between them at Christmas, and knowing, she stretched out her arms
to Morton for comfort: 'My Morton, where are you? I need you.'</p>

<p>Grim and exceedingly angry grew Puddle, that little, grey box of
a woman in her schoolroom; angry with Anna for her treatment of
Stephen, but even more deeply angry with Sir Philip, who knew the
whole truth, or so she suspected, and who yet kept that truth back
from Anna.</p>

<p>Stephen would sit with her head in her hands: Oh, Puddle, it's
my fault; I've come in between them, and they're all I've
got&mdash;they're my one perfect thing&mdash;I can't bear
it&mdash;why have I come in between them?'</p>

<p>And Puddle would flush with reminiscent anger as her mind
slipped back and back over the years to old sorrows, old miseries,
long decently buried but now disinterred by this pitiful Stephen.
She would live through those years again, while her spirit would
cry out, unregenerate against their injustice.</p>

<p>Frowning at her pupil, she would speak to her sharply: 'Don't be
a fool, Stephen. Where's your brain, where's your backbone? Stop
holding your head and get on with your Latin. My God, child, you'll
have worse things than this to face later&mdash;life's not all beer
and skittles, I do assure you. Now come along, do, and get on with
that Latin. Remember you'll soon be going up to Oxford.' But after
a while she might pat the girl's shoulder and say rather gruffly:
'I'm not angry, Stephen&mdash;I do understand, my dear, I do
really&mdash;only somehow I've just got to make you have backbone.
You're too sensitive, child, and the sensitive suffer&mdash;well, I
don't want to see you suffer, that's all. Let's go out for a
walk&mdash;we've done enough Latin for today&mdash;let's walk over
the meadows to Upton.'</p>

<p>Stephen clung to this little, grey box of a woman as a drowning
man will cling to a spar. Puddle's very hardness was somehow
consoling&mdash;it seemed concrete, a thing you could trust, could
rely on, and their friendship that had flourished as a green
bay-tree grew into something more stalwart and much more enduring.
And surely the two of them had need of their friendship, for now
there was little happiness at Morton; Sir Philip and Anna were
deeply unhappy&mdash;degraded they would feel by their ceaseless
quarrels.</p>

<p>Sir Philip would think: 'I must tell her the truth&mdash;I must
tell her what I believe to be the truth about Stephen.' He would go
in search of his wife, but having found her would stand there
tongue-tied, with his eyes full of pity.</p>

<p>And one day Anna suddenly burst out weeping, for no reason
except that she felt his great pity. Not knowing and not caring why
he pitied, she wept, so that all he could do was to console
her.</p>

<p>They clung together like penitent children. 'Anna forgive
me.'</p>

<p>'Forgive me, Philip&mdash;' For in between quarrels they were
sometimes like children, naively asking each other's
forgiveness.</p>

<p>Sir Philip's resolution weakened and waned as he kissed the
tears from her poor, reddened eyelids. He thought:
'tomorrow&mdash;tomorrow I'll tell her&mdash;I can't bear to make
her more unhappy today.'</p>

<p>So the weeks drifted by and still he had not spoken; summer came
and went, giving place to the autumn. Yet one more Christmas
visited Morton, and still Sir Philip had not spoken.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter Fourteen</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>February came bringing snowstorms with it, the heaviest known
for many a year. The hills lay folded in swathes of whiteness, and
so did the valleys at the foot of the hills, and so did the
spacious gardens of Morton&mdash;it was all one vast panorama of
whiteness. The lakes froze, and the beech trees had crystalline
branches, while their luminous carpet of leaves grew brittle so
that it crackled now underfoot, the only sound in the frozen
stillness of that place that was always infinitely still. Peter,
the arrogant swan, turned friendly, and he and his family now
welcomed Stephen who fed them every morning and evening, and they
glad enough to partake of her bounty. On the lawn Anna set out a
tray for the birds, with chopped suet, seed, and small mounds of
bread-crumbs; and down at the stables old Williams spread straw in
wide rings for exercising the horses who could not be taken beyond
the yard, so bad were the roads around Morton.</p>

<p>The gardens lay placidly under the snow, in no way perturbed or
disconcerted. Only one inmate of theirs felt anxious, and that was
the ancient and wide-boughed cedar, for the weight of the snow made
an ache in its branches&mdash;its branches were brittle like an old
man's bones; that was why the cedar felt anxious. But it could not
cry out or shake off its torment; no, it could only endure with
patience, hoping that Anna would take note of its trouble, since
she sat in its shade summer after summer&mdash;since once long ago
she had sat in its shade dreaming of the son she would bear her
husband. And one morning Anna did notice its plight, and she called
Sir Philip, who hurried from his study.</p>

<p>She said: 'Look, Philip! I'm afraid for my cedar&mdash;it's all
weighted down&mdash;I feel worried about it.'</p>

<p>Then Sir Philip sent in to Upton for chain, and for stout pads
of felt to support the branches; and he himself must direct the
gardeners while they climbed into the tree and pushed off the snow;
and he himself must see to the placing of the stout felt pads, lest
the branches be galled. Because he loved Anna who loved the cedar,
he must stand underneath it directing the gardeners.</p>

<p>A sudden and horrible sound of rending. 'Sir, look out! Sir
Philip, look out sir, it's giving!'</p>

<p>A crash and then silence&mdash;a horrible silence, far worse
than that horrible sound of rending.</p>

<p>'Sir Philip&mdash;oh, Gawd, it's over 'is chest! It's crushed in
'is chest&mdash;it's the big branch wot's given! Some one go for
the doctor&mdash;go quick for Doctor Evans. Oh, Gawd, 'is mouth's
bleedin'&mdash;it's crushed in 'is chest&mdash;Won't nobody go for
the doctor?'</p>

<p>The grave, rather pompous voice of Mr. Hopkins: 'Steady, Thomas,
it's no good losin' your head. Robert, you'd best slip over to the
stables and tell Burton to go in the car for the doctor. You,
Thomas, give me a hand with this bough&mdash;steady on&mdash;ease
it off a bit to the right, now lift! Steady on, keep more to the
right&mdash;now then, gently, gently, man&mdash;lift!'</p>

<p>Sir Philip lay very still on the snow, and the blood oozed
slowly from between his lips. He looked monstrously tall as he lay
on that whiteness, very straight, with his long legs stretched out
to their fullest, so that Thomas said foolishly: 'Don't 'e be
big&mdash;I don't know as I ever noticed before&mdash;'</p>

<p>And now someone came scuttling over the snow, panting,
stumbling, hopping grotesquely&mdash;old Williams, hatless and in
his shirt sleeves&mdash;and as he came on he kept calling out
something: 'Master, oh, Master!' And he hopped grotesquely as he
came on over the slippery snow. 'Master, Master&mdash;oh,
Master!'</p>

<p>They found a hurdle, and with dreadful care they placed the
master of Morton upon it, and with dreadful slowness they carried
the hurdle over the lawn, and in through the door that Sir Philip
himself had left standing ajar.</p>

<p>Slowly they carried him into the hall, and even more slowly his
tired eyes opened, and he whispered: 'Where's Stephen: I
want&mdash;the child.'</p>

<p>And old Williams muttered thickly: 'She's comin',
Master&mdash;she be comin' down the stairs; she's here, Sir
Philip.'</p>

<p>Then Sir Philip tried to move, and he spoke quite loudly:
'Stephen! Where are your I want you, child&mdash;'</p>

<p>She went to him, saying never a word, but she thought: 'He's
dying&mdash;my Father.'</p>

<p>And she took his large hand in hers and stroked it, but still
without speaking, because when one loves there is nothing left in
the world to say, when the best beloved lies dying. He looked at
her with the pleading eyes of a dog who is dumb, but who yet asks
forgiveness. And she knew that his eyes were asking forgiveness for
something beyond her poor comprehension; so she nodded, and just
went on stroking his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopkins asked quietly: 'Where shall we take him?' And as
quietly Stephen answered: 'To the study.'</p>

<p>Then she herself led the way to the study, walking steadily,
just as though nothing had happened, just as though when she got
there she would find her father lolling back in his arm-chair,
reading. But she thought all the while: 'He's dying&mdash;my
Father&mdash;' Only the thought seemed unreal, preposterous. It
seemed like the thinking of somebody else, a thing so unreal as to
be preposterous. Yet when they had set him down in the study, her
own voice it was that she heard giving orders.</p>

<p>'Tell Miss Puddleton to go at once to my Mother and break the
news gently&mdash;I'll stay with Sir Philip. One of you please send
a housemaid to me with a sponge and some towels and a basin of cold
water. Burton's gone for Doctor Evans, you say? That's quite right.
Now I'd like you to go up and fetch down a mattress, the one from
the blue room will do&mdash;get it quickly. Bring some blankets as
well and a couple of pillows&mdash;and I may need a little
brandy.'</p>

<p>They ran to obey, and before very long she had helped to lift
him on to the mattress. He groaned a little, then he actually
smiled as he felt her strong arms around him. She kept wiping the
blood away from his mouth, and her fingers were stained; she looked
at her fingers, but without comprehension&mdash;they could not be
hers&mdash;like her thoughts, they must surely be somebody else's.
But now his eyes were growing more restless&mdash;he was looking
for someone, he was looking for her mother.</p>

<p>'Have you told Miss Puddleton, Williams?' she whispered. The man
nodded.</p>

<p>Then she said: 'Mother's coming, darling; you lie still,' and
her voice was softly persuasive as though she were speaking to a
small, suffering child. 'Mother's coining; you lie quite still,
darling.'</p>

<p>And she came&mdash;incredulous, yet wide-eyed with horror.
'Philip, oh, Philip!' She sank down beside him and laid her white
face against his on the pillow. 'My dear, my dear&mdash;it's most
terribly hurt you&mdash;try to tell me where it hurts; try to tell
me, beloved. The branch gave&mdash;it was the snow&mdash;it fell on
you, Philip&mdash;but try to tell me where it hurts most,
beloved.'</p>

<p>Stephen motioned to the servants and they went away slowly with
bowed heads, for Sir Philip had been a good friend; they loved him,
each in his or her way, each according to his or her capacity for
loving.</p>

<p>And always that terrible voice went on speaking, terrible
because it was quite unlike Anna's&mdash;it was toneless, and it
asked and re-asked the same question: 'Try to tell me where it
hurts most, beloved.'</p>

<p>But Sir Philip was fighting the battle of pain; of intense,
irresistible, unmanning pain. He lay silent, not answering
Anna.</p>

<p>Then she coaxed him in words soft with memories of her country.
'And you the loveliest man,' she whispered, 'and you with the light
of God in your eyes.' But he lay there unable to answer.</p>

<p>And now she seemed to forget Stephen's presence, for she spoke
as one lover will speak with another&mdash;foolishly, fondly,
inventing small names, as one lover will do for another. And
watching them Stephen beheld a great marvel, for he opened his eyes
and his eyes met her mother's, and a light seemed to shine over
both their poor faces, transfiguring them with something
triumphant, with love&mdash;thus those two rekindled the beacon for
their child in the shadow of the valley of death.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>It was late afternoon before the doctor arrived; he had been out
all day and the roads were heavy. He had come the moment he
received the news, come as fast as a car clogged with snow could
bring him. He did what he could, which was very little, for Sir
Philip was conscious and wished to remain so; he would not permit
them to ease his pain by administering drugs. He could speak very
slowly.</p>

<p>'No&mdash;not that&mdash;something urgent&mdash;I want&mdash;to
say. No drugs&mdash;I know I'm&mdash;dying&mdash;Evans.'</p>

<p>The doctor adjusted the slipping pillows, then turning he
whispered carefully to Stephen. 'Look after your mother. He's
going, I think&mdash;it can't be long now. I'll wait in the next
room. If you need me you've only got to call me.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' she answered' 'if I need you, I'll call you.'</p>

<p>Then Sir Philip paid even to the uttermost farthing, paid with
stupendous physical courage for the sin of his anxious and pitiful
heart; and he drove and he goaded his ebbing strength to the making
of one great and terrible effort: 'Anna&mdash;it's
Stephen&mdash;listen.' They were holding his hands.
'It's&mdash;Stephen&mdash;our child&mdash;she's, she's&mdash;it's
Stephen&mdash;not like&mdash;'</p>

<p>His head fell back rather sharply, and then lay very still upon
Anna's bosom.</p>

<p>Stephen released the hand she was holding, for Anna had stopped
and was kissing his lips, desperately, passionately kissing his
lips, as though to breathe back the life into his body. And none
might be there to witness that thing, save God&mdash;the God of
death and affliction, Who is also the God of love. Turning away she
stole out of their presence, leaving them alone in the darkening
study, leaving them alone with their deathless devotion&mdash;hand
in hand, the quick and the dead.</p>

<h2>BOOK TWO</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter Fifteen</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Sir Philip's death deprived his child of three things; of
companionship of mind born of real understanding, of a stalwart
barrier between her and the world, and above all of love&mdash;that
faithful love that would gladly have suffered all things for her
sake, in order to spare her suffering.</p>

<p>Stephen, recovering from the merciful numbness of shock and
facing her first deep sorrow, stood utterly confounded, as a child
will stand who is lost in a crowd, having somehow let go of the
hand that has always guided. Thinking of her father, she realized
how greatly she had leant on that man of deep kindness, how sure
she had felt of his constant protection, how much she had taken
that protection for granted. And so together with her constant
grieving, with the ache for his presence that never left her, came
the knowledge of what real loneliness felt like. She would marvel,
remembering how often in his lifetime she had thought herself
lonely, when by stretching out a finger she could touch him, when
by speaking she could hear his voice, when by raising her eyes she
could see him before her. And now also she knew the desolation of
small things, the power to give infinite pain that lies hidden in
the little inanimate objects that persist, in a book, in a
well-worn garment, in a half-finished letter, in a favourite
armchair.</p>

<p>She thought: 'They go on&mdash;they mean nothing at all, and yet
they go on,' and the handling of them was anguish, and yet she must
always touch them. 'How queer, this old arm-chair has out-lived
him, an old chair&mdash;' And feeling the creases in its leather,
the dent in its back where her father's head had lain, she would
hate the inanimate thing for surviving, or perhaps she would love
it and find herself weeping.</p>

<p>Morton had become a place of remembering that closed round her
and held her in its grip of remembrance. It was pain, yet now more
than ever she adored it, every stone, every blade of grass in its
meadows. She fancied that it too grieved for her father and was
turning to her for comfort. Because of Morton the days must go on,
all their trifling tasks must be duly accomplished. At tunes she
might wonder that this should be so, might be filled with a
fleeting sense of resentment, but then she would think of her home
as a creature dependent upon her and her mother for its needs, and
the sense of resentment would vanish.</p>

<p>Very gravely she listened to the lawyer from London. 'The place
goes to your mother for her lifetime,' he told her; 'on her death,
of course, it becomes yours, Miss Gordon. But your father made a
separate provision; when you're twenty-one, in about two years'
time, you'll inherit quite a considerable income.'</p>

<p>She said: 'Will that leave enough money for Morton?' 'More than
enough,' he reassured her, smiling.</p>

<p>In the quiet old house there was discipline and order, death had
come and gone, yet these things persisted. Like the well-worn
garment and favourite chair, discipline and order had survived the
great change, filling the emptiness of the rooms with a queer sense
of unreality at times, with a new and very bewildering doubt as to
which was real, life or death. The servants scoured and swept and
dusted. From Malvern, once a week, came a young clock-winder, and
he set the clocks with much care and precision so that when he had
gone they all chimed together&mdash;rather hurriedly they would all
chime together, as though flustered by the great importance of
time. Puddle added up the books and made lists for the cook. The
tall under-footman polished the windows&mdash;the iridescent window
that looked out on the lawns and the semicircular fanlight he
polished. In the gardens work progressed just as usual. Gardeners
pruned and hoed and diligently planted. Spring gained in strength
to the joy of the cuckoos, trees blossomed, and outside Sir
Philip's study glowed beds of the old-fashioned single tulips he
had loved above all the others. According to custom the bulbs had
been planted, and now, still according to custom, there were
tulips. At the stables the hunters were turned out to grass, and
the ceilings and walls had a fresh coat of whitewash. Williams went
into Upton to buy tape for the plaits which the grooms were now
engaged upon making; while beyond, in a paddock adjoining the beech
wood, a couple of mares gave birth to strong foals&mdash;thus were
all things accomplished in their season at Morton.</p>

<p>But Anna, whose word was now absolute law, had become one of
those who have done with smiling; a quiet, enduring, grief-stricken
woman, in whose eyes was a patient, waiting expression. She was
gentle to Stephen, yet terribly aloof; in their hour of great need
they must still stand divided these two, by the old, insidious
barrier. Yet Stephen clung closer and closer to Morton; she had
definitely given up all idea of Oxford. In vain did Puddle try to
protest, in vain did she daily remind her pupil that Sir Philip had
set his heart on her going; no good, for Stephen would always
reply:</p>

<p>'Morton needs me; Father would want me to stay, because he
taught me to love it.'</p>

<p>And Puddle was helpless. What could she do, bound as she was by
the tyranny of silence? She dared not explain the girl to herself,
dared not say: 'For your own sake you must go to Oxford, you'll
need every weapon your brain can give you; being what you are
you'll need every weapon,' for then certainly Stephen would start
to question, and her teacher's very position of trust would forbid
her to answer those questions.</p>

<p>Outrageous, Puddle would feel it to be, that wilfully selfish
tyranny of silence evolved by a crafty old ostrich of a world for
its own wellbeing and comfort. The world hid its head in the sands
of convention, so that seeing nothing it might avoid Truth. It said
to itself: 'If seeing's believing, then I don't want to
see&mdash;if silence is golden, it is also, in this case, very
expedient.' There were moments when Puddle would feel sorely
tempted to shout out loud at the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes she thought of giving up her post, so weary was she of
fretting over Stephen. She would think: What's the good of my
worrying myself sick? I can't help the girl, but I can help
myself&mdash;seems to me it's a matter of pure self-preservation.'
Then all that was loyal and faithful in her would protest: 'Better
stick it, she'll probably need you one day and you ought to be here
to help her.' So Puddle decided to stick it.</p>

<p>They did very little work, for Stephen had grown idle with grief
and no longer cared for her studies. Nor could she find consolation
in her writing, for sorrow will often do one of two things&mdash;it
will either release the springs of inspiration, or else it will dry
up those springs completely, and in Stephen's case it had done the
latter. She longed for the comforting outlet of words, but now the
words would always evade her.</p>

<p>'I can't write any more, it's gone from me, Puddle&mdash;he's
taken it with him.' And then would come tears, and the tears would
go splashing down on to the paper, blotting the poor inadequate
lines that meant little or nothing as their author well knew, to
her own added desolation.</p>

<p>There she would sit like a woebegone child, and Puddle would
think how childish she seemed in this her first encounter with
grief, and would marvel because of the physical strength of the
creature, that went so ill with those tears. And because her own
tears were vexing her eyes she must often speak rather sharply to
Stephen. Then Stephen would go off and swing her large dumb-bells,
seeking the relief of bodily movement, seeking to wear out her
muscular body because her mind was worn out by sorrow.</p>

<p>August came and Williams got the hunters in from grass. Stephen
would sometimes get up very early and help with the exercising of
the horses, but in spite of this the old man's heart misgave him,
she seemed strangely averse to discussing the hunting.</p>

<p>He would think: 'Maybe it's 'er father's death, but the instinct
be pretty strong in 'er blood, she'll be all right after 'er's 'ad
'er first gallop.' And perhaps he might craftily point to Raftery.
'Look, Miss Stephen, did ever you see such quarters? 'E's a mighty
fine doer, keeps 'imself fit on grass! I do believe as 'e does it
on purpose; I believe 'e's afraid 'e'll miss a day's huntin'.'</p>

<p>But the autumn slipped by and the winter was passing. Hounds met
at the very gates of Morton, yet Stephen forbore to send those
orders to the stables for which Williams was anxiously waiting.
Then one morning in March he could bear it no longer, and he
suddenly started reproaching Stephen: 'Yer lettin' my 'orses go
stale in their boxes. It's a scandal, Miss Stephen, and you such a
rider, and our stables the finest bar none in the county, and yer
father so almighty proud of yer ridin'!' And then: 'Miss
Stephen&mdash;yer'll not give it up? Won't yer hunt Raftery day
after to morrow? The 'ounds is meetin' quite near by
Upton&mdash;Miss Stephen, say yer won't give it all up!'</p>

<p>There were actually tears in his worried old eyes, and so to
console him she answered briefly: 'Very well then, I'll hunt the
day after tomorrow.' But for some strange reason that she did not
understand, this prospect had quite ceased to give her
pleasure.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>On a morning of high scudding clouds and sunshine, Stephen rode
Raftery into Upton, then over the bridge that spans the river
Severn, and on to the Meet at a neighbouring village. Behind her
came jogging her second horseman on one of Sir Philip's favourite
youngsters, a raw-boned, upstanding, impetuous chestnut, now all
eyes and ears for what might be coming; but beside her rode only
memory and heartache. Yet from time to time she turned her head
quickly as though someone must surely be there at her side.</p>

<p>Her mind was a prey to the strangest fancies. She pictured her
father very grave and anxious, not gay and light-hearted as had
been his wont when they rode to a Meet in the old days. And because
this day was so vibrant with living it was difficult for Stephen to
tolerate the idea of death, even for a little red fox, and she
caught herself thinking: 'If we find, this morning, there'll be two
of us who are utterly alone, with every man's hand against us.'</p>

<p>At the Meet she was a prey to her self-conscious shyness, so
that she fancied people were whispering. There was no one now with
bowed, patient shoulders to stand between her and those unfriendly
people.</p>

<p>Colonel Antrim came up. 'Glad to see you out, Stephen.' But his
voice sounded stiff because he was embarrassed&mdash;everyone felt
just a little embarrassed, as people will do in the face of
bereavement.</p>

<p>And then there was something so awkward about her, so aloof that
it checked every impulse of kindness. They, in their turn, felt
shy, remembering Sir Philip, remembering what his death must have
meant to his daughter, so that more than one greeting remained
unspoken.</p>

<p>And again she thought grimly: 'Two of us will be alone, with
every man's hand against us.'</p>

<p>They found their fox in the very first cover and went away over
the wide, bare meadows. As Raftery leapt forward her curious
fancies gained strength, and now they began to obsess her. She
fancied that she was being pursued, that the hounds were behind her
instead of ahead, that the flushed, bright-eyed people were hunting
her down, ruthless, implacable, untiring people&mdash;they were
many and she was one solitary creature with every man's hand
against her. To escape them she suddenly took her own line, putting
Raftery over some perilous places; but he, nothing loath, stretched
his muscles to their utmost, landing safely&mdash;yet she always
imagined pursuit, and now it was the world that had turned against
her. The whole world was hunting her down with hatred, with a
fierce, remorseless will to destruction&mdash;the world against one
insignificant creature who had nowhere to turn for pity or
protection. Her heart tightened with fear, she was terribly afraid
of those flushed, bright-eyed people who were hard on her track.
She who had never lacked physical courage in her life, was now
actually sweating with terror, and Raftery, divining her terror,
sped on, faster and always faster.</p>

<p>Then Stephen saw something just ahead, and it moved. Checking
Raftery sharply she stared at the thing. A crawling, bedraggled
streak of red fur, with tongue lolling, with agonized lungs filled
to bursting, with the desperate eyes of the hopelessly pursued,
bright with terror and glancing now this way, now that as though
looking for something; and the thought came to Stephen; 'It's
looking for God Who made it.'</p>

<p>At that moment she felt an imperative need to believe that the
stricken beast had a Maker, and her own eyes grew bright, but with
blinding tears because of her mighty need to believe, a need that
was sharper than physical pain, being born of the pain of the
spirit. The thing was dragging its brush in the dust, it was
limping, and Stephen sprang to the ground. She held out her hands
to the unhappy creature, filled with the will to succour and
protect it, but the fox mistrusted her merciful hands, and it crept
away into a little coppice. And now in a deathly and awful silence
the hounds swept past her, their muzzles to the ground. After them
galloped Colonel Antrim, crouching low in his saddle, avoiding the
branches, and after him came a couple of huntsmen with the few bold
riders who had stayed that stiff run. Then a savage clamour broke
out in the coppice as the hounds gave tongue in their wild
jubilation, and Stephen well knew that that sound meant
death&mdash;very slowly she remounted Raftery.</p>

<p>Riding home, she felt utterly spent and bewildered. Her thoughts
were full of her father again&mdash;he seemed very near, incredibly
near her. For a moment she thought that she heard his voice, but
when she bent sideways trying to listen, all was silence, except
for the tired rhythm of Raftery's hooves on the road. As her brain
grew calmer, it seemed to Stephen that her father had taught her
all that she knew. He had taught her courage and truth and honour
in his life, and in death he had taught her mercy&mdash;the mercy
that he had lacked he had taught her through the mighty adventure
of death. With a sudden illumination of vision, she perceived that
all life is only one life, that all joy and all sorrow are indeed
only one, that all death is only one dying. And she knew that
because she had seen a man die in great suffering, yet with courage
and love that are deathless, she could never again inflict wanton
destruction or pain upon any poor, hapless creature. And so it was
that by dying to Stephen, Sir Philip would live on in the attribute
of mercy that had come that day to his child.</p>

<p>But the body is still very far from the spirit, and it clings to
the primitive joys of the earth&mdash;to the sun and the wind and
the good rolling grass-lands, to the swift elation of reckless
movement, so that Stephen, feeling Raftery between her strong
knees, was suddenly filled with regret. Yes, in this her moment of
spiritual insight she was infinitely sad, and she said to Raftery:
'We'll never hunt any more, we two, Raftery&mdash;we'll never go
out hunting together any more.'</p>

<p>And because in his own way he had understood her, she felt his
sides swell with a vast, resigned sigh; heard the creaking of damp
girth leather as he sighed because he had understood her. For the
love of the chase was still hot in Raftery, the love of splendid,
unforeseen danger, the love of crisp mornings and frost-bound
evenings, and of long, dusky roads that always led home. He was
wise with the age-old wisdom of the beasts, it is true, but that
wisdom was not guiltless of slaying, and deep in his gentle and
faithful mind lurked a memory bequeathed him by some wild forbear.
A memory of vast and unpeopled spaces, of fierce open nostrils and
teeth bared in battle, of hooves that struck death with every sure
blow, of a great untamed mane that streamed out like a banner, of
the shrill and incredibly savage war-cry that accompanied that
gallant banner. So now he too felt infinitely sad, and he sighed
until his strong girths started creaking, after which he stood
still and shook himself largely, in an effort to shake off
depression.</p>

<p>Stephen bent forward and patted his neck. 'I'm sorry, sorry,
Raftery,' she said gravely.</p>

</p>

<p>With the breaking up of the stables at Morton came the breaking
up of their faithful servant. Old age took its toll of Williams at
last, and it got him under completely. Sore at heart and gone in
both wind and limb, he retired with a pension to his comfortable
cottage; there to cough and grumble throughout the winter, or to
smoke disconsolate pipes through the summer, seated on a chair in
his trim little garden with a rug wrapped around his knees.</p>

<p>'It do be a scandal,' he was now for ever saying, 'and 'er such
a splendid woman to 'ounds!'</p>

<p>And then he would start remembering past glories, while his mind
would begin to grieve for Sir Philip. He would cry just a little
because he still loved him, so his wife must bring Williams a
strong cup of tea.</p>

<p>'There, there, Arth-thur, you'll soon be meetin' the master; we
be old me and you&mdash;it can't be long now.'</p>

<p>At which Williams would glare: 'I'm not thinkin' of
'eaven&mdash;like as not there won't be no 'orses in 'eaven&mdash;I
wants the master down 'ere at me stables. Gawd knows they be
needin' a master!'</p>

<p>For now besides Anna's carriage horses, there were only four
inmates of those once fine stables: Raftery and Sir Philip's young
upstanding chestnut, a cob known as James, and the aged Collins who
had taken to vice in senile decay, and persisted in eating his
bedding.</p>

<p>Anna had accepted this radical change quite calmly, as she now
accepted most things. She hardly ever opposed her daughter these
days in matters concerning Morton. But the burden of arranging the
sale had been Stephen's; one by one she had said good-bye to the
hunters, one by one she had watched them led out of the yard, with
a lump in her throat that had almost choked her, and when they were
gone she had turned back to Raftery for comfort.</p>

<p>'Oh, Raftery, I'm so unregenerate&mdash;I minded so terribly
seeing them go! Don't let's look at their empty boxes&mdash;'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Another year passed and Stephen was twenty-one, a rich,
independent woman. At any time now she could go where she chose,
could do entirely as she listed. Puddle remained at her post; she
was waiting a little grimly for something to happen. But nothing
much happened, beyond the fact that Stephen now dressed in
tailor-made clothes to which Anna had perforce to withdraw her
opposition. Yet life was gradually reasserting its claims on the
girl, which was only natural, for the young may not be delivered
over to the dead, nor to grief that refuses consolation. She still
mourned her father, she would always mourn him, but at twenty-one
with a healthful body, there came a day when she noticed the
sunshine, when she smelt the good earth and was thankful for it,
when she suddenly knew herself to be alive and was glad, in despite
of death.</p>

<p>On one such morning early that June, Stephen drove her car into
Upton. She was meaning to cash a cheque at the bank, she was
meaning to call at the local saddler's, she was meaning to buy a
new pair of gloves&mdash;in the end, however, she did none of these
things.</p>

<p>It was outside the butcher's that the dog fight started. The
butcher owned an old rip of an Airedale, and the Airedale had taken
up his post in the doorway of the shop, as had long been his
custom. Down the street, on trim but belligerent tiptoes, came a
very small, snow-white West Highland terrier; perhaps he was
looking for trouble, and if so he certainly got it in less than two
minutes. His yells were so loud that Stephen stopped the car and
turned round in her seat to see what was happening. The butcher ran
out to swell the confusion by shouting commands that no one obeyed;
he was trying to grasp his dog by the tail which was short and not
at all handy for grasping. And then, as it seemed from nowhere at
all there suddenly appeared a very desperate young woman; she was
carrying her parasol as though it were a lance with which she
intended to enter the battle. Her wails of despair rose above the
dog's yells:</p>

<p>'Tony! My Tony! Won't anyone stop them? My dog's being killed,
won't any of you stop them?' And she actually tried to stop them
herself, though the parasol broke at the first encounter.</p>

<p>But Tony, while yelling, was as game as a ferret, and, moreover,
the Airedale had him by the back, so Stephen got hastily out of the
car&mdash;it seemed only a matter of moments for Tony. She grabbed
the old rip by the scruff of the neck, while the butcher dashed off
for a bucket of water. The desperate young woman seized her dog by
a leg; she pulled, Stephen pulled, they both pulled together. Then
Stephen gave a punishing twist which distracted the Airedale, he
wanted to bite her; having only one mouth he must let go of Tony,
who was instantly clasped to his owner's bosom. The butcher arrived
on the scene with his bucket while Stephen was still clinging to
the Airedale's collar.</p>

<p>'I'm so sorry, Miss Gordon, I do hope you're not hurt?'</p>

<p>'I'm all right. Here, take this grey devil and thrash him; he's
no business to eat up a dog half his size.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony was dripping all over with gore, and his
mistress, it seemed, had got herself bitten. She alternately
struggled to staunch Tony's wounds and to suck her own hand which
was bleeding freely.</p>

<p>'Better give me your dog and come across to the chemist, your
hand will want dressing,' remarked Stephen.</p>

<p>Tony was instantly put into her arms, with a rather pale smile
that suggested a breakdown.</p>

<p>It's quite all right now,' said Stephen quickly, very much
afraid the young woman meant to cry.</p>

<p>'Will he live, do you think?' inquired a weak voice.</p>

<p>Yes, of course; but your hand&mdash;come along to the chemist.'
'Oh, never mind that, I'm thinking of Tony!'</p>

<p>'He's all right. We'll take him straight off to the vet when
your hand's been seen to; there's quite a good one.'</p>

<p>The chemist applied fairly strong carbolic; the hand had been
bitten on two of the fingers, and Stephen was impressed by the
pluck of this stranger, who set her small teeth and endured in
silence. The hand bandaged they drove along to the vet, who was
fortunately in and could sew up poor Tony. Stephen held his front
paws, while his mistress held his head as best she could in her own
maimed condition She kept pressing his face against her shoulder,
presumably so that he should not see the needle.</p>

<p>'Don't look, darling&mdash;you mustn't look at it, honey!'
Stephen heard her whispering to Tony.</p>

<p>At last he too was carbolicked and bandaged, and Stephen had
time to examine her companion. It occurred to her that she had
better introduce herself, so she said: 'I'm Stephen Gordon.'</p>

<p>And I'm Angela Crossby,' came the reply; 'we've taken The
Grange, just the other side of Upton.'</p>

<p>Angela Crossby was amazingly blonde, her hair was not so much
golden as silver. She wore it cut short like a mediaeval page; it
was straight, and came just to the lobes of her ears, which at that
time of pompadours and much curling gave her an unusual appearance.
Her skin was very white, and Stephen decided that this woman would
never have a great deal of colour, nor would her rather wide mouth
be red, it would always remain the tint of pale coral. All the
colour that she had seemed to lie in her eyes, which were large and
fringed with long fair lashes. Her eyes were of rather an unusual
blue that almost seemed to be tinted with purple, and their candid
expression was that of a child&mdash;very innocent it was, a
trustful expression. And Stephen as she looked at those eyes felt
indignant, remembering the gossip she had heard about the
Crossby's.</p>

<p>The Crossby's, as she knew, were deeply resented. He had been an
important Birmingham magnate who had lately retired from some
hardware concern, on account of his health, or so ran the gossip.
His wife, it was rumoured, had been on the stage in New York, so
that her antecedents were doubtful&mdash;no one really knew
anything at all about her, but her curious hair gave grounds for
suspicion. An American wife who had been an actress was a very bad
asset for Crossby. Nor was Crossby himself a prepossessing person;
when judged by the county's standards, lie bounded. Moreover he
showed signs of unpardonable meanness. His subscription to the Hunt
had been a paltry five guineas. He had written to say that his very
poor health would preclude his hunting, and had actually added that
he hoped the Hunt would keep clear of his coverts! And then
everyone felt a natural resentment that The Grange should have had
to be sacrificed for money&mdash;quite a small Tudor house it was
yet very perfect. But Captain Ramsay, its erstwhile owner, had died
recently, leaving large debts behind him, so his heir, a young
cousin who lived in London, had promptly sold to the first wealthy
bidder&mdash;hence the advent of Mr. Crossby.</p>

<p>Stephen, looking at Angela, remembered these things, but they
suddenly seemed devoid of importance, for now those child-like eyes
were upon her, and Angela was saying: 'I don't know how to thank
you for saving my Tony, it was wonderful of you! If you hadn't been
there they'd have let him get killed, and I'm just devoted to
Tony!'</p>

<p>Her voice had the soft, thick drawl of the South, an indolent
voice, very lazy and restful. It was quite new to Stephen, that
soft Southern drawl, and she found it unexpectedly pleasant. Then
it dawned on the girl that this woman was lovely&mdash;she was like
some queer flower that had grown up in darkness, like some rare,
pale flower without blemish or stain, and Stephen said
flushing:</p>

<p>'I was glad to help you&mdash;I'll drive you back to The Grange,
if you'll let me?'</p>

<p>'Why, of course we'll let you,' came the prompt answer. 'Tony
says he'll be most grateful, don't you, Tony?' Tony wagged his tail
rather faintly.</p>

<p>Stephen wrapped him up in a motor rug at the back of the car,
where he lay as though prostrate. Angela she placed in the seat
beside herself, helping her carefully as she did so.</p>

<p>Presently Angela said: 'Thanks to Tony I've met you at last;
I've been longing to meet you!' And she stared rather
disconcertingly at Stephen, then smiled as though something she saw
had amused her.</p>

<p>Stephen wondered why anyone should have longed to meet her.
Feeling suddenly shy she became suspicious: 'Who told you about
me?' she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Antrim, I think&mdash;yes, it was Mrs. Antrim. She said
you were such a wonderful rider but that now, for some reason,
you'd given up hunting. Oh, yes, and she said you fenced like a
man. Do you fence like a man?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' muttered Stephen.</p>

<p>'Well, I'll tell you whether you do when I've seen you; my
father was quite a well-known fencer at one time, so I learnt a lot
about fencing in the States&mdash;perhaps some day, Miss Gordon,
you'll let me see you?'</p>

<p>By now Stephen's face was the colour of a beetroot, and she
gripped the wheel as though she meant to hurt it. She was longing
to turn round and look at her companion, the desire to look at her
was almost overwhelming, but even her eyes seemed too stiff to
move, so she gazed at the long dusty road in silence.</p>

<p>'Don't punish the poor, wooden thing that way,' murmured Angela,
'it can't help being just wood!' Then she went on talking as though
to herself: 'What should I have done if that brute had killed Tony?
He's a real companion to me on my walks&mdash;I don't know what I'd
do if it weren't for Tony, he's such a devoted, cute little fellow,
and these days I'm kind of thrown back on my dog&mdash;it's a
melancholy business walking alone, yet I've always been fond of
walking&mdash;'</p>

<p>Stephen wanted to say: 'But I like walking too; let me come with
you sometimes as well as Tony.' Then suddenly mustering up her
courage, she jerked round in the seat and looked at this woman. As
their eyes met and held each other for a moment, something vaguely
disturbing stirred in Stephen, so that the car made a dangerous
swerve. 'I'm sorry,' she said quickly, 'that was rotten bad
driving.'</p>

<p>But Angela did not answer.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Ralph Crossby was standing at the open doorway as the car swung
up and came to a halt. Stephen noticed that he was immaculately
dressed in a grey tweed suit that by rights should have been
shabby. But everything about him looked aggressively new, his very
hair had a quality of newness&mdash;it was thin brown hair that
shone as though polished.</p>

<p>'I wonder if he puts it out with his boots,' thought Stephen,
surveying him with interest.</p>

<p>He was one of those rather indefinite men, who are neither short
nor tall, fat nor thin, old nor young, good-looking nor actually
ugly. As his wife would have said, had anybody asked her, he was
just 'plain man,' which exactly described him, for his only
distinctive features were his newness and the peevish expression
about his mouth&mdash;his mouth was intensely peevish.</p>

<p>When he spoke his high-pitched voice sounded fretful. What on
earth have you been doing? It's past two o'clock. I've been waiting
since one, the lunch must be ruined; I do wish you'd try and be
punctual, Angela!' He appeared not to notice Stephen's existence,
for he went on nagging as though no one were present. 'Oh, I see
that damn dog of yours has been fighting again, I've a good mind to
give him a thrashing; and what in God's name's the matter with your
hand&mdash;you <i>don't</i> mean to say that you've got yourself
bitten? Really, Angela, this is a bit too bad!' His whole manner
suggested a personal grievance.</p>

<p>'Well,' drawled Angela, extending the bandaged hand for
inspection, 'I've not been getting manicured, Ralph.' And her voice
was distinctly if gently provoking, so that he winced with quick
irritation. Then she seemed quite suddenly to remember Stephen:
'Miss Gordon, let me introduce my husband.'</p>

<p>He bowed, and pulling himself together: 'Thank you for driving
my wife home, Miss Gordon, it was most kind, I'm sure.' But he did
not seem friendly, he kept glaring at Angela's dog-bitten hand, and
his tone, Stephen thought, was distinctly ungracious.</p>

<p>Getting out of the car she started her engine.</p>

<p>'Good-bye,' smiled Angela, holding out her hand, the left one,
which Stephen grasped much too firmly. Good-bye&mdash;perhaps one
day you'll come to tea. We're on the telephone, Upton 25, ring up
and suggest yourself some day quite soon.'</p>

<p>'Thanks awfully, I will,' said Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>'Had a breakdown or something?' inquired Puddle brightly, as at
three o'clock Stephen slouched into the schoolroom.</p>

<p>'No&mdash;but Mrs. Crossby's dog had a fight. She got bitten, so
I drove her back to The Grange.'</p>

<p>Puddle pricked up her ears: 'What's she like? I've heard
rumours&mdash;' 'Well, she's not at all like them,' snapped
Stephen.</p>

<p>There ensued a long silence while Puddle considered, but
consideration does not always bring wise counsel, and now Puddle
made a really bad break: 'She's pretty impossible, isn't she,
Stephen? They say he unearthed her somewhere in New York; Mrs.
Antrim says she was a music-hall actress. I suppose you were
obliged to give her a lift, but be careful, I believe she's
fearfully pushing.'</p>

<p>Stephen flared up like an emotional schoolgirl: 'I'm not going
to discuss her if that's your opinion; Mrs. Crossby is quite as
much a lady as you are, or any of the others round here, for that
matter. I'm sick unto death of your beastly gossip.' And turning
abruptly she strode from the room.</p>

<p>'Oh, Lord!' murmured Puddle, frowning.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>That evening Stephen rang up The Grange. 'Is that Upton 25? It's
Miss Gordon speaking&mdash;no, no, Miss Gordon, speaking from
Morton. How is Mrs. Crossby and how is the dog? I hope Mrs.
Crossby's hand isn't very painful? Yes, of course I'll hold on
while you go and inquire.' She felt shy, yet unusually daring.</p>

<p>Presently the butler came back and said gravely that Mrs.
Crossby had just seen the doctor and had now gone to bed, as her
hand was aching, but that Tony felt better and sent his love. He
added: 'Madam says would you come to tea on Sunday? She'd be very
glad indeed if you would.'</p>

<p>And Stephen answered: 'Will you thank Mrs. Crossby and tell her
that I'll certainly come on Sunday.' Then she gave the message all
over again, very slowly, with pauses. 'Will&mdash;you
thank&mdash;Mrs. Crossby and tell her&mdash;I'll certainly
come&mdash;on Sunday. Do you quite understand? Have I made it quite
clear? Say I'm coming to tea on Sunday.'</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter Seventeen</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>It was only five days till Sunday, yet for Stephen those five
days seemed like as many years. Every evening now she rang up The
Grange to inquire about Angela's hand and Tony, so that she grew
quite familiar with the butler, with his quality of voice, with his
habit of coughing, with the way he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>She did not stop to analyse her feelings, she only knew that she
felt exultant&mdash;for no reason at all she was feeling exultant,
very much alive and full of purpose, and she walked for miles alone
on the hills, unable to stay really quiet for a moment. She found
herself becoming acutely observant, and now she discovered all
manner of wonders; the network of veins on the leaves, for
instance, and the delicate hearts of the wild dog-roses, the
uncertain shimmering flight of the larks as they fluttered up
singing, close to her feet. But above all she rediscovered the
cuckoo&mdash;it was June, so the cuckoo had changed his
rhythm&mdash;she must often stand breathlessly still to listen:
Cuckoo-kook, cuckoo-kook,' all over the hills; and at evening the
songs of blackbirds and thrushes.</p>

<p>Her wanderings would sometimes lead her to the places that she
and Martin had visited together, only now she could think of him
with affection, with toleration, with tenderness even. In a curious
way she now understood him as never before, and in consequence
condoned. It had just been some rather ghastly mistake, his
mistake, yet she understood what he must have felt; and thinking of
Martin she might grow rather frightened&mdash;what if she should
ever make such a mistake? But the fear would be driven into the
background by her sense of wellbeing, her fine exultation. The very
earth that she trod seemed exalted, and the green, growing things
that sprang out of the earth, and the birds, Cuckoo-kook,' all over
the hills&mdash;and at evening the songs of blackbirds and
thrushes.</p>

<p>She became much more anxious about her appearance; for five
mornings she studied her face in the glass as she
dressed&mdash;after all she was not so bad looking. Her hair spoilt
her a little, it was too thick and long, but she noticed with
pleasure that at least it was wavy&mdash;then she suddenly admired
the colour of her hair. Opening cupboard after cupboard she went
through her clothes. They were old, for the most part distinctly
shabby. She would go into Malvern that very afternoon and order a
new flannel suit at her tailor's. The suit should be grey with a
little white pin stripe, and the jacket, she decided, must have a
breast pocket. She would wear a black tie&mdash;no, better a grey
one to match the new suit with the little white pin stripe. She
ordered not one new suit but three, and she also ordered a pair of
brown shoes; indeed she spent most of the afternoon in ordering
things for her personal adornment. She heard herself being
ridiculously fussy about details, disputing with her tailor over
buttons; disputing with her boot-maker over the shoes, their
thickness of sole, their amount of broguing; disputing regarding
the match of her ties with the young man who sold her handkerchiefs
and neckties&mdash;for such trifles had assumed an enormous
importance; she had, in fact, grown quite long-winded about
them.</p>

<p>That evening she showed her smart neckties to Puddle, whose
manner was most unsatisfactory&mdash;she grunted.</p>

<p>And now someone seemed to be always near Stephen, someone for
whom these things were accomplished&mdash;the purchase of the three
new suits, the brown shoes, the six carefully chosen, expensive
neckties. Her long walks on the hills were a part of this person,
as were also the hearts of the wild dog-roses, the delicate network
of veins on the leaves and the queer June break in the cuckoo's
rhythm. The night with its large summer stars and its silence, was
pregnant with a new and mysterious purpose, so that lying at the
mercy of that age-old purpose, Stephen would feel little shivers of
pleasure creeping out of the night and into her body. She would get
up and stand by the open window, thinking always of Angela
Crossby.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Sunday came and with it church in the morning; then two
interminable hours after lunch, during which Stephen changed her
necktie three times, and brushed back her thick chestnut hair with
water, and examined her shoes for imaginary dust, and finally gave
a hard rub to her nails with a nail pad snatched brusquely away
from Puddle.</p>

<p>When the moment for departure arrived at last, she said rather
tentatively to Anna: 'Aren't you going to call on the Crossbys,
Mother?'</p>

<p>Anna shook her head: 'No, I can't do that, Stephen&mdash;I go
nowhere these days; you know that, my dear.'</p>

<p>But her voice was quite gentle, so Stephen said quickly: 'Well,
then, may I invite Mrs. Crossby to Morton?'</p>

<p>Anna hesitated a moment, then she nodded: 'I suppose
so&mdash;that is if you really wish to.'</p>

<p>The drive only took about twenty minutes, for now Stephen was so
nervous that she positively flew. She who had been puffed up with
elation and self-satisfaction was crumbling completely&mdash;in
spite of her careful new necktie she was crumbling at the mere
thought of Angela Crossby. Arrived at The Grange she felt over
life-size; her hands seemed enormous, all out of proportion, and
she thought that the butler stared at her hands.</p>

<p>'Miss Gordon?' he inquired.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she mumbled, 'Miss Gordon.' Then he coughed as he did on
the telephone, and quite suddenly Stephen felt foolish.</p>

<p>She was shown into a small oak-panelled parlour whose long, open
casements looked on to the herb-garden. A fire of apple-wood burnt
on the hearth, in spite of the act that the weather was warm, for
Angela was always inclined to feel chilly&mdash;the result, so she
said, of the English climate. The fire gave off rather a sweet,
pungent odour&mdash;the odour of slightly damp logs and dry ashes.
By way of a really propitious beginning, Tony barked until he
nearly burst his stitches, so that Angela, who was lying on the
lounge, had perforce to get up in order to soothe him. An extremely
round bullfinch in an ornate brass cage was piping a tune with his
wings half extended. The tune sounded something like 'Pop goes the
weasel.' At all events it was an impudent tune, and Stephen felt
that she hated that bullfinch. It took all of five minutes to calm
down Tony, during which Stephen stood apologetic but tongue-tied.
She hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry at this very ridiculous
anti-climax.</p>

<p>Then Angela decided the matter by laughing: 'I'm so sorry, Miss
Gordon, he's feeling peevish. It's quite natural, poor lamb, he had
a bad night, he just hates being all sewn up like a bolster.'</p>

<p>Stephen went over and offered him her hand, which Tony now
licked, so that trouble was ended; but in getting up Angela had
torn her dress, and this seemed to distress her&mdash;she kept
fingering the tear. 'Can I help?' inquired Stephen, hoping she'd
say no&mdash;which she did, quite firmly, after one look at
Stephen.</p>

<p>At last Angela settled down again on the lounge. 'Come and sit
over here,' she suggested, smiling. Then Stephen sat down on the
edge of a chair as though she were sitting in the Prickly
Cradle.</p>

<p>She forgot to inquire about Angela's dog-bite, though the
bandaged hand was placed on a cushion; and she also forgot to
adjust her new necktie, which in her emotion had slipped slightly
crooked. A thousand times in the last few days had she carefully
rehearsed this scene of their meeting, making up long and elaborate
speeches; assuming, in her mind, many dignified poses; and yet
there she sat on the edge of a chair as though it were the Prickly
Cradle.</p>

<p>And now Angela was speaking in her soft, Southern drawl: 'So
you've found your way here at last,' she was saying. And then,
after a pause: 'I'm so glad, Miss Gordon, do you know that your
coming has given me real pleasure?'</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'Yes&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;' Then fell silent again,
apparently intent on the carpet.</p>

<p>'Have I dropped my cigarette ash or something?' inquired her
hostess, whose mouth twitched a little.</p>

<p>'I don't think so,' murmured Stephen, pretending to look, then
glancing up sideways at the impudent bullfinch.</p>

<p>The bullfinch was now being sentimental; he piped very low and
with great expression. 'O, Tannenbaum, O, Tannenbaum, wie gr&uuml;n
sind Deine Natter,' he piped, hopping rather heavily from perch to
perch, with one beady black orb fixed on Stephen.</p>

<p>Then Angela said: 'It's a curious thing, but I feel as though
I've known you for ages. I don't want to behave as though we were
strangers&mdash;do you think that's very American of me? Ought I to
be formal and stand-offish and British? I will if you say so, but I
don't feel British.' And her voice, although quite steady and
grave, was somehow distinctly suggestive of laughter.</p>

<p>Stephen lifted troubled eyes to her face: 'I want very much to
be your friend if you'll have me,' she said; and then she flushed
deeply.</p>

<p>Angela held out her undamaged hand which Stephen took, but in
great trepidation. Barely had it lain in her own for a moment, when
she clumsily gave it back to its owner. Then Angela looked at her
hand.</p>

<p>Stephen thought: 'Have I done something rude or awkward?' And
her heart thumped thickly against her side. She wanted to retrieve
the lost hand and stroke it, but unfortunately it was now stroking
Tony. She sighed, and Angela, hearing that sigh, glanced up, as
though in inquiry.</p>

<p>The butler arrived, bringing in the tea.</p>

<p>Sugar?' asked Angela.</p>

<p>'No, thanks,' said Stephen; then she suddenly changed her mind
three lumps, please,' she had always detested tea without
sugar.</p>

<p>The tea was too hot; it burnt her mouth badly. She grew scarlet
and her eyes began to water. To cover her confusion she swallowed
more tea, while Angela looked tactfully out of the window. But when
she considered it safe to turn round, her expression, although
still faintly amused, had something about it that was tender.</p>

<p>And now she exerted all her subtlety and skill to make this
queer guest of hers talk more freely, and Angela's subtlety was no
mean thing, neither was her skill if she chose to exert it. Very
gradually the girl became more at her ease; it was uphill work but
Angela triumphed, so that in the end Stephen talked about Morton,
and a very little about herself also. And somehow, although Stephen
appeared to be talking, she found that she was learning many things
about her hostess; for instance, she learnt that Angela was lonely
and very badly in need of her friendship. Most of Angela's troubles
seemed to centre round Ralph, who was not always kind and seldom
agreeable. Remembering Ralph she could well believe this, and she
said:</p>

<p>'I don't think your husband liked me.'</p>

<p>Angela sighed: Very probably not. Ralph never likes the people I
do; he objects to my friends on principle, I think.'</p>

<p>Then Angela talked more openly of Ralph. Just now he was staying
away with his mother, but next week he would be returning to The
Grange, and then he was certain to be disagreeable: 'Whenever he's
been with his mother he's that way&mdash;she puts him against me, I
never know why&mdash;unless, of course, it's because I'm not
English. I'm the stranger within the gates, it may be that.' And
when Stephen protested, 'Oh, yes indeed, I'm quite often made to
feel like a stranger. Take the people round here, do you think they
like me?'</p>

<p>And Stephen, who had not yet learnt to dissemble, stared hard at
her shoes, in embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>Just outside the door a dock boomed seven. Stephen started; she
had been there nearly three hours. 'I must go,' she said, getting
abruptly to her feet, 'you look tired, I've been making a
visitation.'</p>

<p>Her hostess made no effort to retain her: 'Well,' she smiled,
'come again, please come very often&mdash;that is if you won't find
it dull, Miss Gordon; we're terribly quiet here at The Grange.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen drove home slowly, for now that it was over she felt
like a machine that had suddenly run down. Her nerves were relaxed,
she was thoroughly tired, yet she rather enjoyed this unusual
sensation. The hot June evening was heavy with thunder. From
somewhere in the distance came the bleating of sheep, and the
melancholy sound seemed to blend and mingle with her mood, which
was now very gently depressed. A gentle but persistent sense of
depression enveloped her whole being like a soft, grey cloak; and
she did not wish to shake off this cloak, but rather to fold it
more closely around her.</p>

<p>At Morton she stopped the car by the lakes and sat staring
through the trees at the glint of water. For a long while she sat
there without knowing why, unless it was that she wished to
remember. But she found that she could not even be certain of the
kind of dress that Angela had worn&mdash;it had been of some soft
stuff, that much she remembered, so soft that it had easily torn,
for the rest her memories of it were vague&mdash;though she very
much wanted to remember that dress.</p>

<p>A faint rumble of thunder came out of the west, where the clouds
were banking up ominously purple. Some uncertain and rather
hysterical swallows flew high and then low at the sound of the
thunder. Her sense of depression was now much less gentle, it
increased every moment, turning to sadness. She was sad in spirit
and mind and body&mdash;her body felt dejected, she was sad all
over. And now someone was whistling down by the stables, old
Williams, she suspected, for the whistle was tuneless. The loss of
his teeth had disgruntled his whistle; yes, she was sure that must
be Williams. A horse whinnied as one bucket clanked against
another&mdash;sounds came dearly this evening; they were watering
the horses. Anna's young carriage horses would be pawing their
straw, impatient because they were feeling thirsty.</p>

<p>Then a gate slammed. That would be the gate of the meadow where
the heifers were pastured&mdash;it was yellow with king-cups. One
of the men from the home farm was going his rounds, securing all
gates before sunset. Something dropped on the bonnet of the car
with a ping. Looking up she met the eyes of a squirrel; he was
leaning well forward on his tiny front paws, peering crossly; he
had dropped his nut on the bonnet. She got out of the car and
retrieved his supper, throwing it under his tree while he waited.
Like a flash he was down and then back on his tree, devouring the
nut with his legs well straddled.</p>

<p>All around were the homely activities of evening, the watering
of horses, the care of cattle&mdash;pleasant, peaceable things that
preceded the peace and repose of the coming nightfall. And suddenly
Stephen longed to share them, an immense need to share them leapt
up within her, so that she ached with this urgent longing that was
somehow a part of her bodily dejection.</p>

<p>She drove on and left the car at the stables, then walked round
to the house, and when she got there she opened the door of the
study and went in, feeling terribly lonely without her father.
Sitting down in the old arm-chair that had survived him, she let
her head rest where his head had rested; and her hands she laid on
the arms of the chair where his hands, as she knew, had lain times
without number. Closing her eyes, she tried to visualize his face,
his kind face that had sometimes looked anxious; but the picture
came slowly and faded at once, for the dead must often give place
to the living. It was Angela Crossby's face that persisted as
Stephen sat in her father's old chair.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>In the small panelled room that gave on to the herb-garden,
Angela yawned as she stared through the window; then she suddenly
laughed out loud at her thoughts; then she suddenly frowned and
spoke crossly to Tony.</p>

<p>She could not get Stephen out of her mind, and this irritated
while it amused her. Stephen was so large to be tongue-tied and
frightened&mdash;a curious creature, not devoid of attraction. In a
way&mdash;her own way&mdash;she was almost handsome; no, quite
handsome; she had fine eyes and beautiful hair. And her body was
supple like that of an athlete&mdash;narrow-hipped and wide
shouldered, she should fence very well. Angela was anxious to see
her fence; she must certainly try to arrange it somehow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Antrim had conveyed a number of things, while actually
saying very little; but Angela had no need of her hints, not now
that she had come to know Stephen Gordon. And because she was idle,
discontented and bored, and certainly not over-burdened with
virtue, she must let her thoughts dwell unduly on this girl, while
her curiosity kept pace with her thoughts.</p>

<p>Tony stretched and whimpered, so Angela kissed him, then she sat
down and wrote quite a short little letter: 'Do come over to lunch
the day after tomorrow and advise me about the garden,' ran the
letter. And it ended&mdash;after one or two casual remarks about
gardens&mdash;with: 'Tony says <i>please</i> come, Stephen!'</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter Eighteen</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>On a beautiful evening three weeks later, Stephen took Angela
over Morton. They had had tea with Anna and Puddle, and Anna had
been coldly polite to this friend of her daughter's, but Puddle's
manner had been rather resentful&mdash;she deeply mistrusted Angela
Crossby. But now Stephen was free to show Angela Morton, and this
she did gravely, as though something sacred were involved in this
first introduction to her home, as though Morton itself must feel
that the coming of this small, fair-haired woman was in some way
momentous. Very gravely, then, they went over the house&mdash;even
into Sir Philip's old study.</p>

<p>From the house they made their way to the stables, and still
grave, Stephen told her friend about Raftery. Angela listened,
assuming an interest she was very far from feeling&mdash;she was
timid of horses, but she liked to hear the girl's rather gruff
voice, such an earnest young voice, it intrigued her. She was
thoroughly frightened when Raftery sniffed her and then blew
through his nostrils as though disapproving, and she started back
with a sharp exclamation, so that Stephen slapped him on his glossy
grey shoulder: 'Stop it, Raftery, come up!' And Raftery, disgusted,
went and blew on his oats to express his hurt feelings.</p>

<p>They left him and wandered away through the gardens, and quite
soon poor Raftery was almost forgotten, for the gardens smelt
softly of night-scented stock, and of other pale flowers that smell
sweetest at evening, and Stephen was thinking that Angela Crossby
resembled such flowers&mdash;very fragrant and pale she was, so
Stephen said to her gently: 'You seem to belong to Morton.'</p>

<p>Angela smiled a slow, questioning smile: 'You think so,
Stephen?' And Stephen answered: 'I do, because Morton and I are
one,' and she scarcely understood the portent of her words; but
Angela, understanding, spoke quickly:</p>

<p>'Oh, I belong nowhere&mdash;you forget I'm the stranger.'</p>

<p>'I know that you're you,' said Stephen.</p>

<p>They walked on in silence while the light changed and deepened,
growing always more golden and yet more elusive. And the birds, who
loved that strange light, sang singly and then all together: 'We're
happy, Stephen!'</p>

<p>And turning to Angela, Stephen answered the birds: 'Your being
here makes me so happy.'</p>

<p>'If that's true, then why are you so shy of my name?'</p>

<p>'Angela&mdash;' mumbled Stephen.</p>

<p>Then Angela said: 'It's just over three weeks since we
met&mdash;how quickly our friendship's happened. I suppose it was
meant, I believe in Kismet. You were awfully scared that first day
at The Grange; why were you so scared?'</p>

<p>Stephen answered slowly: 'I'm frightened now&mdash;I'm
frightened of you.'</p>

<p>'Yet you're stronger than I am&mdash;'</p>

<p>Yes, that's why I'm so frightened, you make me feel
strong&mdash;do you want to do that?'</p>

<p>Well&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you're so very unusual, Stephen.'</p>

<p>'Am I?'</p>

<p>'Of course, don't you know that you are? Why, you're altogether
different from other people.'</p>

<p>Stephen trembled a little: 'Do you mind?' she faltered.</p>

<p>'I know that you're you,' teased Angela, smiling again, but she
reached out and took Stephen's hand.</p>

<p>Something in the queer, vital strength of that hand stirred her
deeply, so that she tightened her fingers: What in the Lord's name
are you?' she murmured.</p>

<p>'I don't know. Go on holding like that to my hand&mdash;hold it
tighter&mdash;I like the feel of your fingers.'</p>

<p>Stephen, don't be absurd!'</p>

<p>'Go on holding my hand, I like the feel of your fingers.'
'Stephen, you're hurting, you're crushing my rings!'</p>

<p>And now they were under the trees by the lakes, their feet
falling softly on the luminous carpet. Hand in hand they entered
that place of deep stillness, and only their breathing disturbed
the stillness for a moment, then it folded back over their
breathing.</p>

<p>'Look,' said Stephen, and she pointed to the swan called Peter,
who had come drifting past on his own white reflection. 'Look,' she
said, 'this is Morton, all beauty and peace&mdash;it drifts like
that swan does, on calm, deep water. And all this beauty and peace
is for you, because now you're a part of Morton.'</p>

<p>Angela said: 'I've never known peace, it's not in me&mdash;I
don't think I'd find it here, Stephen.' And as she spoke she
released her hand, moving a little away from the girl.</p>

<p>But Stephen continued to talk on gently; her voice sounded
almost like that of a dreamer: 'Lovely, oh, lovely it is, our
Morton. On evenings in winter these lakes are quite frozen, and the
ice looks like slabs of gold in the sunset, when you and I come and
stand here in the winter. And as we walk back we can smell the log
fires long before we can see them, and we love that good smell
because it means home, and our home is Morton&mdash;and we're
happy, happy&mdash;we're utterly contented and at peace, we're
filled with the peace of this place&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Stephen&mdash;don't!'</p>

<p>'We're both filled with the old peace of Morton, because we love
each other so deeply&mdash;and because we're perfect, a perfect
thing, you and I&mdash;not two separate people but one. And our
love has lit a great, comforting beacon, so that we need never be
afraid of the dark any more&mdash;we can warm ourselves at our
love, we can lie down together, and my arms will be round
you&mdash;'</p>

<p>She broke off abruptly, and they stared at each other.</p>

<p>'Do you know what you're saying?' Angela whispered.</p>

<p>And Stephen answered: 'I know that I love you, and that nothing
else matters in the world.'</p>

<p>Then, perhaps because of that glamorous evening, with its spirit
of queer, unearthly adventure, with its urge to strange,
unendurable sweetness, Angela moved a step nearer to Stephen, then
another, until their hands were touching. And all that she was, and
all that she had been and would be again, perhaps even tomorrow,
was fused at that moment into one mighty impulse, one imperative
need, and that need was Stephen. Stephen's need was now hers, by
sheer force of its blind and uncomprehending will to
appeasement.</p>

<p>Then Stephen took Angela into her arms, and she kissed her full
on the lips, as a lover.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter Nineteen</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Through the long years of life that followed after, bringing
with them their dreams and disillusions, their joys and sorrows,
their fulfilments and frustrations, Stephen was never to forget
this summer when she fell quite simply and naturally in love, in
accordance with the dictates of her nature.</p>

<p>To her there seemed nothing strange or unholy in the love that
she felt for Angela Crossby. To her it seemed an inevitable thing,
as much a part of herself as her breathing; and yet it appeared
transcendent of self, and she looked up and onwards towards her
love&mdash;for the eyes of the young are drawn to the stars, and
the spirit of youth is seldom earth-bound.</p>

<p>She loved deeply, far more deeply than many a one who could
fearlessly proclaim himself a lover. Since this is a hard and sad
truth for the telling; those whom nature has sacrificed to her
ends&mdash;her mysterious ends that often lie hidden&mdash;are
sometimes endowed with a vast will to loving, with an endless
capacity for suffering also, which must go hand in hand with their
love.</p>

<p>But at first Stephen's eyes were drawn to the stars, and she saw
only gleam upon gleam of glory. Her physical passion for Angela
Crossby had aroused a strange response in her spirit, so that side
by side with every hot impulse that led her at times beyond her own
understanding, there would come an impulse not of the body; a fine,
selfless thing of great beauty and courage&mdash;she would gladly
have given her body over to torment, have laid down her life if
need be, for the sake of this woman whom she loved. And so blinded
was she by those gleams of glory which the stars fling into the
eyes of young lovers, that she saw perfection where none existed;
saw a patient endurance that was purely fictitious, and conceived
of a loyalty far beyond the limits of Angela's nature.</p>

<p>All that Angela gave seemed the gift of love; all that Angela
withheld seemed withheld out of honour: 'If only I were free,' she
was always saying, 'but I can't deceive Ralph, you know I can't,
Stephen&mdash;he's ill.' Then Stephen would feel abashed and
ashamed before so much pity and honour.</p>

<p>She would humble herself to the very dust, as one who was
altogether unworthy: 'I'm a beast, forgive me; I'm all, all
wrong&mdash;I'm mad sometimes these days&mdash;yes, of course,
there's Ralph.'</p>

<p>But the thought of Ralph would be past all bearing, so that she
must reach out for Angela's hand. Then, as likely as not, they
would draw together and start kissing, and Stephen would be utterly
undone by those painful and terribly sterile kisses.</p>

<p>'God!' she would mutter, 'I want to get away!'</p>

<p>At which Angela might weep: 'Don't leave me, Stephen! I'm so
lonely&mdash;why can't you understand that I'm only trying to be
decent to Ralph?' So Stephen would stay on for an hour, for two
hours, and the next day would find her once more at The Grange,
because Angela was feeling so lonely.</p>

<p>For Angela could never quite let the girl go. She herself would
be rather bewildered at moments&mdash;she did not love Stephen, she
was quite sure of that, and yet the very strangeness of it all was
an attraction. Stephen was becoming a kind of strong drug, a kind
of anodyne against boredom. And then Angela knew her own power to
subdue; she could play with fire yet remain unscathed by it. She
had only to cry long and bitterly enough for Stephen to grow
pitiful and consequently gentle.</p>

<p>'Stephen, don't hurt me&mdash;I'm awfully frightened when you're
like this&mdash;you simply terrify me, Stephen! Is it my fault that
I married Ralph before I met you? Be good to me, Stephen!' And then
would come tears, so that Stephen must hold her as though she were
a child, very tenderly, rocking her backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>They took to driving as far as the hills, taking Tony with them;
he liked hunting the rabbits&mdash;and while he leapt wildly about
in the air to land on nothing more vital than herbage, they would
sit very close to each other and watch him. Stephen knew many
places where lovers might sit like this, unashamed, among those
charitable hills. There were times when a numbness descended upon
her as they sat there, and if Angela kissed her cheek lightly, she
would not respond, would not even look round, but would just go on
staring at Tony. Yet at other times she felt queerly uplifted, and
turning to the woman who leant against her shoulder, she said
suddenly one day:</p>

<p>'Nothing matters up here. You and I are so small, we're smaller
than Tony&mdash;our love's nothing but a drop in some vast sea of
love&mdash;it's rather consoling&mdash;don't you think so,
beloved?'</p>

<p>But Angela shook her head: 'No, my Stephen; I'm not fond of vast
seas, I'm of the earth earthy,' and then: 'Kiss me, Stephen.' So
Stephen must kiss her many times, for the hot blood of youth stirs
quickly, and the mystical sea became Angela's lips that so eagerly
gave and took kisses.</p>

<p>But when they got back to The Grange that evening, Ralph was
there&mdash;he was hanging about in the hall. He said: 'Had a nice
afternoon, you two women? Been motoring Angela round the hills,
Stephen, or what?'</p>

<p>He had taken to calling her Stephen, but his voice just now
sounded sharp with suspicion as his rather weak eyes peered at
Angela, so that for her sake Stephen must lie, and lie
well&mdash;nor would this be the first time either.</p>

<p>'Yes, thanks,' she lied calmly, 'we went over to Tewkesbury and
had another look at the abbey. We had tea in the town. I'm sorry
we're so late, the carburettor choked, I couldn't get it right at
first, my car needs a good overhauling.'</p>

<p>Lies, always lies! She was growing proficient at the glib kind
of lying that pacified Ralph, or at all events left him with
nothing to say, nonplussed and at a distinct disadvantage. She was
suddenly seized with a kind of horror, she felt physically sick at
what she was doing, Her head swam and she caught the jamb of the
door for support&mdash;at that moment she remembered her
father.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Two days later as they sat alone in the garden at Morton,
Stephen turned to Angela abruptly: 'I can't go on like this, it's
vile&mdash;it's beastly, it's soiling us both&mdash;can't you see
that?'</p>

<p>Angela was startled: 'What on earth do you mean?'</p>

<p>'You and me&mdash;and then Ralph. I tell you it's
beastly&mdash;I want you to leave him and come away with me.'</p>

<p>'Are you mad?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm sane. It's the only decent thing, it's the only clean
thing; we'll go anywhere you like, to Paris, to Egypt, or back to
the States. For your sake I'm ready to give up my home. Do you hear
I'm ready to give up even Morton. But I can't go on lying about you
to Ralph, I want him to know how much I adore you&mdash;I want the
whole world to know how I adore you. Ralph doesn't understand the
first rudiments of loving, he's a nagging, mean-minded cur of a
man, but there's one thing that even he has a right to, and that's
the truth. I'm done with these lies&mdash;I shall tell him the
truth and so will you, Angela; and after we've told him we'll go
away, and we'll live quite openly together, you and I, which is
what we owe to ourselves and our love.'</p>

<p>Angela stared at her, white and aghast: 'You are mad,' she said
slowly, 'you're raving mad. Tell him what? Have I let you become my
lover? You know that I've always been faithful to Ralph; you know
perfectly well that there's nothing to tell him, beyond a few
rather schoolgirlish kisses. Can I help it if you're&mdash;what you
obviously are? Oh, no, my dear, you're not going to tell Ralph.
You're not going to let all hell loose around me just because you
want to save your own pride by pretending to Ralph that you've been
my lover. If you're willing to give up your home I'm not willing to
sacrifice mine, understand that, please. Ralph's not much of a man,
but he's better than nothing, and I've managed him so far without
any trouble. The great thing with him is to blaze a false trail,
that distracts his mind, it works like a charm. He'll follow any
trail that I want him to follow&mdash;you leave him to me, I know
my own husband a darned sight better than you do, Stephen, and I
won't have you interfering in my home.' She was terribly
frightened, too frightened to choose her words to consider their
effect upon Stephen, to consider anyone but Angela Crossby who
stood in such dire and imminent peril. So she said yet again, only
now she spoke loudly: 'I won't have you interfering in my
home!'</p>

<p>Then Stephen turned on her, white with passion:
'You&mdash;you&mdash;' she stuttered, 'you're unspeakably cruel.
You know how you make me suffer and suffer because I love you the
way I do; and because you like the way I love you, you drag the
love out of me day after day&mdash;Can't you understand that I love
you so much that I'd give up Morton? Anything I'd give up&mdash;I'd
give up the whole world. Angela, listen; I'd take care of you
always. Angela, I'm rich&mdash;I'd take care of you always. Why
won't you trust me? Answer me&mdash;why? Don't you think me fit to
be trusted?'</p>

<p>She spoke wildly, scarcely knowing what she said; she only knew
that she needed this woman with a need so intense, that worthy or
unworthy, Angela was all that counted at that moment. And now she
stood up, very tall, very strong, yet a little grotesque in her
pitiful passion, so that looking at her Angela trembled&mdash;there
was something rather terrible about her. All that was heavy in her
face sprang into view, the strong line of the jaw, the square
massive brow, the eyebrows too thick and too wide for beauty; she
was like some curious, primitive thing conceived in a turbulent age
of transition.</p>

<p>'Angela, come very far away&mdash;anywhere, only come with me
soon&mdash;tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Then Angela forced herself to think quickly, and she said just
five words: 'Could you marry me, Stephen?'</p>

<p>She did not look at the girl as she said it&mdash;that she could
not do, perhaps out of something that, for her, was the nearest she
would ever come to pity. There ensued a long, almost breathless
silence, while Angela waited with her eyes turned away. A leaf
dropped, and she heard its minute, soft falling, heard the creak of
the branch that had let fall its leaf as a breeze passed over the
garden.</p>

<p>Then the silence was broken by a quiet, dull voice, that sounded
to her like the voice of a stranger: 'No&mdash;' it said very
slowly, 'no&mdash;I couldn't marry you, Angela.' And when Angela at
last gained the courage to look up, she found that she was sitting
there alone.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter Twenty</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>For three weeks they kept away from each other, neither writing
nor making any effort to meet. Angela's prudence forbade her to
write: 'Littera scripta manet'&mdash;a good motto, and one to which
it was wise to adhere when dealing with a firebrand like Stephen.
Stephen had given her a pretty bad scare, she realized the
necessity for caution; still, thinking over that incredible scene,
she found the memory rather exciting. Deprived of her anodyne
against boredom, she looked upon Ralph with unfriendly eyes; while
he, poor, inadequate, irritable devil, with his vague suspicions
and his chronic dyspepsia, did little enough to divert his
wife&mdash;his days and a fairly large part of his nights as well,
were now spent in nagging.</p>

<p>He nagged about Tony who, as ill luck would have it, had decided
that the garden was rampant with moles: 'If you can't keep that
bloody dog in order, he goes. I won't have him digging craters
round my roses!' Then would come a long list of Tony's misdeeds
from the time he had left the litter. He nagged about the large
population of green-fly, deploring the existence of their sexual
organs: 'Nature's a fool! Fancy procreation being extended to that
sort of vermin!' And then he would grow somewhat coarse as he dwelt
on the frequent conjugal excesses of green-fly. But most of all he
nagged about Stephen, because this as he knew, irritated his wife:
'How's your freak getting on? I haven't seen her just lately; have
you quarrelled or what? Damn good thing if you have. She's
appalling; never saw such a girl in my life; comes swaggering round
here with her legs in breeches. Why can't she ride like an ordinary
woman? Good Lord, it's enough to make any man see red; that sort of
thing wants putting down at birth, I'd like to institute state
lethal chambers!'</p>

<p>Or perhaps he would take quite another tack and complain that
recently he had been neglected: 'Late for every damned
meal&mdash;running round with that girl&mdash;you don't care what
happens to me any more. A lot you care about my indigestion! I've
got to eat any old thing these days from cow hide to bricks. Well,
you listen to me, that's not what I pay for; get that into your
head! I pay for good meals to be served on time; <i>on time</i>, do
you hear? And I expect my wife to be in her rightful place at my
table to see that the omelette's properly prepared. What's the
matter with you that you can't go along and make it yourself? When
we were first married you always made my omelettes yourself: I
won't eat yellow froth with a few strings of parsley in it&mdash;it
reminds me of the dog when he's sick; it's disgusting! And I won't
go on talking about it either, the next time it happens I'll sack
the cook. Damn it all, you were glad enough of my help when I found
you practically starving in New York&mdash;but now you're for ever
racing off with that girl. It's all this damned animal's fault that
you met her!' He would kick out sideways at the terrified Tony, who
had lately been made to stand proxy for Stephen.</p>

<p>But worst of all was it when Ralph started weeping, because, as
he said, his wife did not love him any more, and because, as he did
not always say, he felt ill with his painful, chronic dyspepsia.
One day he must make feeble love through his tears: 'Angela, come
here&mdash;put your arms around me&mdash;come and sit on my knee
the way you used to.' His wet eyes looked dejected yet rather
greedy: 'Put your arms around me, as though you cared&mdash;' He
was always insistent when most ineffectual.</p>

<p>That night he appeared in his best silk pyjamas&mdash;the pink
ones that made his complexion look sallow. He climbed into bed with
the sly expression that Angela hated&mdash;it was so pornographic.
'Well, old girl, don't forget that you've got a man about the
house; you haven't forgotten it, have you?' After which followed
one or two flaccid embraces together with much arrogant masculine
bragging; and Angela, sighing as she lay and endured, quite
suddenly thought of Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Pacing restlessly up and down her bedroom, Stephen would be
thinking of Angela Crossby&mdash;haunted, tormented by Angela's
words that day in the garden: 'Could you marry me, Stephen?' and
then by those other pitiless words: 'Can I help it if
you're&mdash;what you obviously are?'</p>

<p>She would think with a kind of despair: What am I, in God's
name&mdash;some kind of abomination?' And this thought would fill
her with a very great anguish, because, loving much, her love
seemed to her sacred. She could not endure that the slur of those
words should come anywhere near her love. So now night after night
she must pace up and down, beating her mind against a blind
problem, beating her spirit against a blank wall&mdash;the
impregnable wall of non-comprehension: 'Why am I as I am&mdash;and
what am I?' Her mind would recoil while her spirit grew faint. A
great darkness would seem to descend on her spirit&mdash;there
would be no light wherewith to lighten that darkness.</p>

<p>She would think of Martin, for now surely she loved just as he
had loved&mdash;it all seemed like madness. She would think of her
father, of his comfortable words: 'Don't be foolish, there's
nothing strange about you.' Oh, but he must have been pitifully
mistaken&mdash;he had died still very pitifully mistaken. She would
think yet again of her curious childhood, going over each detail in
an effort to remember. But after a little her thoughts must plunge
forward once more, right into her grievous present. With a shock
she would realize how completely this coming of love had blinded
her vision; she had stared at the glory of it so long that not
until now had she seen its black shadow. Then would come the most
poignant suffering of all, the deepest, the final humiliation.
Protection&mdash;she could never offer protection to the creature
she loved: 'Could you marry me, Stephen?' She could neither protect
nor defend nor honour by loving; her hands were completely empty.
She who would gladly have given her life, must go empty-handed to
love, like a beggar. She could only debase what she longed to
exalt, defile what she longed to keep pure and untarnished.</p>

<p>The night would gradually change to dawn; and the dawn would
shine in at the open windows, bringing with it the intolerable
singing of birds: 'Stephen, look at us, look at us, we're happy!'
Away in the distance there would be a harsh crying, the wild, harsh
crying of swans by the lakes&mdash;the swan called Peter
protecting, defending his mate against some unwelcome intruder.
From the chimneys of Williams' comfortable cottage smoke would
rise&mdash;very dark&mdash;the first smoke of the morning. Home,
that meant home and two people together, respected because of their
honourable living. Two people who had had the right to love in
their youth, and whom old age had not divided. Two poor and yet
infinitely enviable people, without stain, without shame in the
eyes of their fellows. Proud people who could face the world
unafraid, having no need to fear the world's execration.</p>

<p>Stephen would fling herself down on the bed, completely
exhausted by the night's bitter vigil.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>There was someone who went every step of the way with Stephen
during those miserable weeks, and this was the faithful and anxious
Puddle, who could have given much wise advice had Stephen only
confided in her. But Stephen hid her trouble in her heart for the
sake of Angela Crossby.</p>

<p>With an ever-increasing presage of disaster, Puddle now stuck to
the girl like a leech, getting little enough in return for her
trouble&mdash;Stephen deeply resented this close supervision:
'Can't you leave me alone? No, of course I'm not ill!' she would
say, with a quick spurt of temper.</p>

<p>But Puddle, divining her illness of spirit together with its
cause, seldom left her alone. She was frightened by something in
Stephen's eyes; an incredulous, questioning, wounded expression, as
though she were trying to understand why it was that she must be so
grievously wounded. Again and again Puddle cursed her own folly for
having shown such open resentment of Angela Crossby; the result was
that now Stephen never discussed her, never mentioned her name
unless Puddle clumsily dragged it in, and then Stephen would change
the subject. And now more than ever Puddle loathed and despised the
conspiracy of silence that forbade her to speak frankly. The
conspiracy of silence that had sent the girl forth unprotected,
right into the arms of this woman. A vain, shallow woman in search
of excitement, and caring less than nothing for Stephen.</p>

<p>There were times when Puddle felt almost desperate, and one
evening she came to a great resolution. She would go to the girl
and say: 'I <i>know</i>. I know all about it, you can trust me,
Stephen.' And then she would counsel and try to give courage:
'You're neither unnatural, nor abominable, nor mad; you're as much
a part of what people call nature as anyone else; only you're
unexplained as yet&mdash;you've not got your niche in creation. But
some day that will come, and meanwhile don't shrink from yourself,
but just face yourself calmly and bravely. Have courage; do the
best you can with your burden. But above all be honourable. Cling
to your honour for the sake of those others who share the same
burden. For their sakes show the world that people like you and
they can be quite as selfless and fine as the rest of mankind. Let
your life go to prove this&mdash;it would be a really great
life-work, Stephen.'</p>

<p>But the resolution waned because of Anna, who would surely join
hands with the conspiracy of silence. She would never condone such
fearless plain-speaking. If it came to her knowledge she would turn
Puddle out bag and baggage, and that would leave Stephen alone. No,
she dared not speak plainly because of the girl for whose sake she
should now, above all, be outspoken. But supposing the day should
arrive when Stephen herself thought fit to confide in her friend,
then Puddle would take the bull by the horns: 'Stephen, I
<i>know</i>. You can trust me, Stephen.' If only that day were not
too long in coming&mdash;</p>

<p>For none knew better than this little grey woman, the agony of
mind that must be endured when a sensitive, highly organized nature
is first brought face to face with its own affliction. None knew
better the terrible nerves of the invert, nerves that are always
lying in wait. Super-nerves, whose response is only equalled by the
strain that calls that response into being. Puddle was well
acquainted with these things&mdash;that was why she was deeply
concerned about Stephen.</p>

<p>But all she could do, at least for the present, was to be very
gentle and very patient: 'Drink this cocoa, Stephen, I made it
myself&mdash;And then with a smile, 'I put four lumps of
sugar!'</p>

<p>Then Stephen was pretty sure to turn contrite: 'Puddle&mdash;I'm
a brute&mdash;you're so good to me always.'</p>

<p>'Rubbish! I know you like cocoa made sweet, that's why I put in
those four lumps of sugar. Let's go for a really long walk, shall
we, dear? I've been wanting a really long walk now for weeks.'</p>

<p>Liar&mdash;most kind and self-sacrificing liar! Puddle hated
long walks, especially with Stephen who strode as though wearing
seven league boots and whose only idea of a country walk was to
take her own line across ditches and hedges&mdash;yes, indeed, a
most kind and self-sacrificing liar! For Puddle was not quite so
young as she had been; at times her feet would trouble her a
little, and at times she would get a sharp twinge in her knee,
which she shrewdly suspected to be rheumatism. Nevertheless she
must keep close to Stephen because of the fear that tightened her
heart&mdash;the fear of that questioning, wounded expression which
now never left the girl's eyes for a moment. So Puddle got out her
most practical shoes&mdash;her heaviest shoes which were said to be
damp-proof&mdash;and limped along bravely by the side of her
charge, who as often as not ignored her existence.</p>

<p>There was one thing in all this that Puddle found amazing, and
that was Anna's apparent blindness. Anna appeared to notice no
change in Stephen, to feel no anxiety about her. As always, these
two were gravely polite to each other, and as always they never
intruded. Still, it did seem to Puddle an incredible thing that the
girl's own mother should have noticed nothing. And yet so it was,
for Anna had gradually been growing more silent and more
abstracted. She was letting the tide of life carry her gently
towards that haven on which her thoughts rested. And this blindness
of hers troubled Puddle sorely, so that anger must often give way
to pity.</p>

<p>She would think: 'God help her, the sorrowful woman; she knows
nothing&mdash;why didn't he tell her? It was cruel!' And then she
would think: 'Yes, but God help Stephen if the day ever comes when
her mother does know&mdash;what will happen on that day to
Stephen?'</p>

<p>Kind and loyal Puddle; she felt torn to shreds between those
two, both so worthy of pity. And now in addition she must be
tormented by memories dug out of their graves by
Stephen&mdash;Stephen, whose pain had called up a dead sorrow that
for long had lain quietly and decently buried. Her youth would come
back and stare into her eyes reproachfully, so that her finest
virtues would seem little better than dust and ashes. She would
sigh, remembering the bitter sweetness, the valiant hopelessness of
her youth&mdash;and then she would look at Stephen.</p>

<p>But one morning Stephen announced abruptly: 'I'm going out.
Don't wait lunch for me, will you.' And her voice permitted of no
argument or question.</p>

<p>Puddle nodded in silence. She had no need to question, she knew
only too well where Stephen was going.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>With head bowed by her mortification of spirit, Stephen rode
once more to The Grange. And from time to time as she rode she
flushed deeply because of the shame of what she was doing. But from
time to time her eyes filled with tears because of the pain of her
longing.</p>

<p>She left the cob with a man at the stables, then made her way
round to the old herb-garden; and there she found Angela sitting
alone in the shade with a book which she was not reading.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'I've come back.' And then without waiting: 'I'll
do anything you want, if you'll let me come back.' And even as she
spoke those words her eyes fell.</p>

<p>But Angela answered: 'You had to come back&mdash;because I've
been wanting you, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Then Stephen went and knelt down beside her, and she hid her
face against Angela's knee, and the tears that had never so much as
once fallen during all the hard weeks of their separation, gushed
out of her eyes. She cried like a child, with her face against
Angela's knee.</p>

<p>Angela let her cry on for a while, then she lifted the
tear-stained face and kissed it: 'Oh, Stephen, Stephen, get used to
the world&mdash;it's a horrible place full of horrible people, but
it's all there is, and we live in it, don't wee So we've just got
to do as the world does, my Stephen.' And because it seemed strange
and rather pathetic that this creature should weep, Angela was
stirred to something very like love for a moment: 'Don't cry any
more&mdash;don't cry, honey,' she whispered, 'we're together;
nothing else really matters.'</p>

<p>And so it began all over again.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen stayed on to lunch, for Ralph was in Worcester. He came
home a good two hours before teatime to find them together among
his roses; they had followed the shade when it left the
herb-garden.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's you!' he exclaimed as his eye lit on Stephen; and his
voice was naively disappointed, so full of dismay at her
reappearance, that just for a second she felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>'Yes, it's me&mdash;' she replied, not quite knowing what to
say.</p>

<p>He grunted, and went off for his pruning knife, with which he
was soon amputating roses. But in spite of his mood he remained a
good surgeon, cutting dexterously, always above the leaf-bud, for
the man was fond of his roses. And knowing this, Stephen must play
on that fondness, since now it was her business to cajole him into
friendship. A degrading business, but it had to be done for
Angela's sake, lest she suffer through loving. Unthinkable
that&mdash;'Could you marry me, Stephen?'</p>

<p>'Ralph, look here,' she called, 'Mrs. John Laing's got broken!
We may be in time if we bind her with bass.'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear, has she?' He came hurrying up as he spoke, 'Do go
down to the shed and get me some, will you?'</p>

<p>She got him the bass and together they bound her, the
pink-cheeked full-bosomed Mrs. John Laing.</p>

<p>'There,' he said, as he snipped off the ends of her bandage,
'that ought to set your leg for you, madam!'</p>

<p>Near by grew a handsome Frau Karl Druschki, and Stephen praised
her luminous whiteness, remarking his obvious pleasure at the
praise. He was like a father of beautiful children, always eager to
hear them admired by a stranger, and she made a note of this in her
mind: 'He likes one to praise his roses.'</p>

<p>He wanted to talk about Frau Karl Druschki: 'She's a beauty!
There's something so wonderfully cool&mdash;as you say, it's the
whiteness&mdash;' Then before he could stop himself: 'She reminds
me of Angela, somehow.' The moment the words were out he was
frowning, and Stephen stared hard at Frau Karl Druschki.</p>

<p>But as they passed from border to border, his brow cleared:
'I've spent over three hundred,' he said proudly, 'never saw such a
mess as this garden was in when I bought the place&mdash;had to dig
in fresh soil for the roses just here, these are all new plants; I
motored half across England to get them. See that hedge of York and
Lancasters there? They didn't cost much because they're out of
fashion. But I like them, they're small but rather distinguished I
think&mdash;there's something so armorial about them.'</p>

<p>She agreed: 'Yes, I'm awfully fond of them too,' and she
listened quite gravely while he explained that they dated as far
back as the Wars of the Roses.</p>

<p>'Historical, that's what I mean,' he explained. 'I like
everything old, you know, except women.'</p>

<p>She thought with an inward smile of his newness.</p>

<p>Presently he said in a tone of surprise: 'I never imagined that
you'd care about roses.'</p>

<p>'Yes, why not? We've got quite a number at Morton. Why don't you
come over tomorrow and see them?'</p>

<p>'Do your William Allen Richardsons do well?' he inquired.</p>

<p>'I think so.'</p>

<p>'Mine don't. I can't make it out. This year of course they've
been damaged by green-fly. Just come here and look at these
standards, will you? They're being devoured alive by the brutes!'
And then as though he were talking to a friend who would understand
him: 'Roses seem good to me&mdash;you know what I mean, there's
virtue about them&mdash;the scent and the feel and the way they
grow. I always had some on the desk in my office, they seemed to
brighten up the whole place, no end.'</p>

<p>He started to ink in the names on the labels with a gold
fountain-pen which he took from his pocket. 'Yes,' he murmured, as
he bent his face over the labels, 'yes, I always had three or four
on my desk. But Birmingham's a foul sort of place for roses.'</p>

<p>And hearing him, Stephen found herself thinking that all men had
something simple about them; something that took pleasure in the
things that were blameless, that longed, as it were, to contact
with Nature. Martin had loved huge, primitive trees; and even this
mean little man loved his roses.</p>

<p>Angela came strolling across the lawn: 'Come, you two,' she
called gaily, 'tea's waiting in the hall!'</p>

<p>Stephen flinched: 'Come, you two&mdash;' the words jarred on
her; and she knew that Angela was thoroughly happy, for when Ralph
was out of earshot for a moment she whispered:</p>

<p>'You were clever about his roses!'</p>

<p>At tea Ralph relapsed into sulky silence; he seemed to regret
his erstwhile good humour. And he ate quite a lot, which made
Angela nervous&mdash;she dreaded his attacks of indigestion, which
were usually accompanied by attacks of bad temper.</p>

<p>Long after they had all finished tea he lingered, until Angela
said: 'Oh, Ralph, that lawn mower. Pratt asked me to tell you that
it won't work at all; he thinks it had better go back to the
makers. Will you write about it now before the post goes?'</p>

<p>'I suppose so&mdash;' he muttered; but he left the room
slowly.</p>

<p>Then they looked at each other, and drew close together,
guiltily, starting at every sound: 'Stephen&mdash;be careful for
God's sake&mdash;Ralph&mdash;'</p>

<p>So Stephen's hands dropped from Angela's shoulders, and she set
her lips hard, for no protest must pass them any more; they had no
right to protest.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter Twenty-one</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>That autumn the Crossbys went, up to Scotland, and Stephen went
to Cornwall with her mother. Anna was not well, she needed a
change, and the doctor had told them of Watergate Bay, that was why
they had gone to Cornwall. To Stephen it mattered very little where
she went, since she was not allowed to join Angela in Scotland.
Angela had put her foot down quite firmly: 'No, my dear, it
wouldn't do. I know Ralph would make hell. I can't let you follow
us up to Scotland.' So that there, perforce, the matter had
ended.</p>

<p>And now Stephen could sit and gloom over her trouble while Anna
read placidly, asking no questions. She seldom worried her daughter
with questions, seldom even evinced any interest in her
letters.</p>

<p>From time to time Puddle would write from Morton, and then Anna
would say, recognizing the writing: 'Is everything all right?'</p>

<p>And Stephen would answer: 'Yes, Mother, Puddle says everything's
all right.' As indeed it was&mdash;at Morton.</p>

<p>But from Scotland news seemed to come very slowly. Stephen's
letters would quite often go unanswered; and what answers she
received were unsatisfactory, for Angela's caution was a very
strict censor. Stephen herself must write with great care, she
discovered, in order to pacify that censor.</p>

<p>Twice daily she visited the hotel porter, a kind, red-faced man
with a sympathy for lovers.</p>

<p>'Any letters for me?' she would ask, trying hard to appear
rather bored at the mere thought of letters.</p>

<p>'No, miss.'</p>

<p>'There's another post in at seven?'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;thank you.'</p>

<p>She would wander away, leaving the porter to think to himself:
'She don't look like a girl as would have a young man, but you
never can tell. Anyhow she seems anxious&mdash;I do hope it's all
right for the poor young lady.' He grew to take a real interest in
Stephen, and would sometimes talk to his wife about her: 'Have you
noticed her, Alice? A queer-looking girl, very tall, wears a collar
and tie&mdash;you know, mannish. And she seems just to change her
suit of an evening&mdash;puts on a dark one&mdash;never wears
evening dress. The mother's still a beautiful woman; but the
girl&mdash;I dunno, there's something about her&mdash;anyhow I'm
surprised she's got a young man; though she must have, the way she
watches the posts, I sometimes feel sorry for her.'</p>

<p>But her calls at his office were not always fruitless: 'Any
letters for me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss, there's just one.'</p>

<p>He would look at her with a paternal expression, glad enough to
think that her young man had written; and Stephen, divining his
thoughts from his face, would feel embarrassed and angry. Snatching
her letters she would hurry to the beach, where the rocks provided
a merciful shelter, and where no one seemed likely to look
paternal, unless it should be an occasional sea-gull.</p>

<p>But as she read, her heart would feel empty; something sharp
like a physical pain would go through her: 'Dear Stephen. I'm sorry
I've not written before, but Ralph and I have been fearfully busy.
We're having a positive social orgy up here, I'm so glad he took
this large shoot...' That was the sort of thing Angela wrote these
days&mdash;perhaps because of her caution.</p>

<p>However, one morning an unusually long letter arrived, telling
all about Angela's doings: 'By the way, we've met the Antrim boy,
Roger. He's been staying with some people that Ralph knows quite
well, the Peacocks, they've got a wonderful old castle; I think I
must have told you about them.' Here followed an elaborate
description of the castle, together with the ancestral tree of the
Peacocks. Then: 'Roger has talked quite a lot about you; he says he
used to tease you when you were children. He says that you wanted
to fight him one day&mdash;that made me laugh awfully, it's so like
you, Stephen! He's a good-looking person and rather a nice one. He
tells me that his regiment's stationed at Worcester, so I've asked
him to come over to The Grange when he likes. It must be pretty
dreary, I imagine, in Worcester...</p>

<p>Stephen finished the letter and sat staring at the sea for a
moment, after which she got up abruptly. Slipping the letter into
her pocket she buttoned her jacket; she was feeling cold. What she
needed was a walk, a really long walk. She set out briskly in the
direction of Newquay.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>During those long, anxious weeks in Cornwall, it was borne in on
Stephen as never before how wide was the gulf between her and her
mother, how completely they two must always stand divided. Yet
looking at Anna's quiet ageing face, the girl would be struck
afresh by its beauty, a beauty that seemed to have mollified the
years, to have risen triumphant over time and grief. And now as in
the days of her childhood, that beauty would fill her with a kind
of wonder; so calm it was, so assured, so complete&mdash;then her
mother's deep eyes, blue like distant mountains, and now with that
far-away look in their blueness, as though they were gazing into
the distance. Stephen's heart would suddenly tighten a little; a
sense of great loss would descend upon her, together with the sense
of not fully understanding just what she had lost or why she had
lost it&mdash;she would stare at Anna as a thirsty traveller in the
desert will stare at a mirage of water.</p>

<p>And one evening there came a preposterous impulse&mdash;the
impulse to confide in this woman within whose most gracious and
perfect body her own anxious body had lain and quickened. She
wanted to speak to that motherhood, to implore, nay, compel its
understanding. To say, 'Mother, I need you. I've lost my
way&mdash;give me your hand to hold in the darkness.' But good God,
the folly, the madness of it! The base betrayal of such a
confession! Angela delivered over, betrayed&mdash;the unthinkable
folly, the madness of it.</p>

<p>Yet sometimes as Anna and she sat together looking out at the
misty Cornish coast-line, hearing the dull, heavy throb of the sea
and the calling of sea-gulls the one to the other&mdash;as they sat
there together it would seem to Stephen that her heart was so full
of Angela Crossby, all the bitterness, all the sweetness of her,
that the mother-heart beating close by her own must surely, in its
turn, be stirred to beat faster, for had she not once sheltered
under that heart? And so extreme was her need becoming, that now
she must often find Anna's cool hand and hold it a moment or two in
her own, trying to draw from it some consolation.</p>

<p>But the touch of that cool, pure hand would distress her,
causing her spirit to ache with longing for the simple and upright
and honourable things that had served many simple and honourable
people. Then all that to some might appear uninspiring, would seem
to her very fulfilling and perfect. A pair of lovers walking by arm
in arm just a quiet engaged couple, neither comely nor clever nor
burdened with riches; just a quiet, engaged couple&mdash;would in
her envious eyes be invested with a glory and pride passing all
understanding. For were Angela and she those fortunate lovers, they
could stand before Anna happy and triumphant. Anna, the mother,
would smile and speak gently, tolerant because of her own days of
loving. Wherever they went older folk would remember, and
remembering would smile on their love and speak gently. To know
that the whole world was glad of your gladness, must surely bring
heaven very near to the world.</p>

<p>One night Anna looked across at her daughter: 'Are you tired, my
dear? You seem a bit fagged.'</p>

<p>The question was unexpected, for Stephen was supposed not to
know what it meant to feel fagged, her physical health and strength
were proverbial. Was it possible then that her mother had divined
at long last her utter weariness of spirit? Quite suddenly Stephen
felt shamelessly childish, and she spoke as a child who wants
comforting.</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm dreadfully tired.' Her voice shook a little; 'I'm
tired out&mdash;I'm dreadfully tired,' she repeated. With amazement
she heard. herself making this weak bid for pity, and yet she could
not resist it. Had Anna held out her arms at that moment, she might
soon have learnt about Angela Crossby.</p>

<p>But instead she yawned: 'It's this air, it's too woolly. I'll be
very glad when we get back to Morton. What's the time? I'm almost
asleep already&mdash;let's go up to our beds, don't you think so,
Stephen?'</p>

<p>It was like a cold douche; and a good thing too for the girl's
self-respect. She pulled herself together: 'Yes, come on, it's past
ten. I detest this soft air.' And she flushed, remembering that
weak bid for pity.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen left Cornwall without a regret; everything about it had
seemed to her depressing. Its rather grim beauty which at any other
time would have deeply appealed to her virile nature, had but added
to the gloom of those interminable weeks spent apart from Angela
Crossby. For her perturbation had been growing apace, she was
constantly oppressed by doubts and vague fears; bewildered,
uncertain of her own power to hold; uncertain, too, of Angela's
will to be held by this dangerous yet bloodless loving. Her
defrauded body had been troubling her sorely, so that she had
tramped over beach and headland, cursing the strength of the youth
that was in her, trying to trample down her hot youth and only
succeeding in augmenting its vigour.</p>

<p>But now that the ordeal had come to an end at last, she began to
feel less despondent. In a week's time Angela would get back from
Scotland; then at least the hunger of the eyes could be
appeased&mdash;a terrible thing that hunger of the eyes for the
sight of the well-loved being. And then Angela's birthday was
drawing near, which would surely provide an excuse for a present.
She had sternly forbidden the giving of presents, even humble
keepsakes, on account of Ralph&mdash;still, a birthday was
different, and in any case Stephen was quite determined to risk it.
For the impulse to give that is common to all lovers, was in her
attaining enormous proportions, so that she visualized Angela
decked in diadems worthy of Cleopatra; so that she sat and stared
at her bank book with eyes that grew angry when they lit on her
balance. What was the good of plenty of money if it could not be
spent on the person one loved? Well, this time it should be so
spent, and spent largely; no limit was going to be set to this
present!</p>

<p>An unworthy and tiresome thing money, at best, but it can at
least ease the heart of the lover. When he lightens his purse he
lightens his heart, though this can hardly be accounted a virtue,
for such giving is perhaps the most insidious form of
self-indulgence that is known to mankind.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen had said quite casually to Anna: 'Suppose we stay three
or four days in London on our way back to Morton? You could do some
shopping.' Anna had agreed, thinking of her house linen which
wanted renewing; but Stephen had been thinking of the jewellers'
shops in Bond Street.</p>

<p>And now here they actually were in London, established at a
quiet and expensive hotel; but the problem of Angela's birthday
present had, it seemed, only just begun for Stephen. She had not
the least idea what she wanted, or what Angela wanted, which was
far more important; and she did not know how to get rid of her
mother, who appeared to dislike going out unaccompanied. For three
days of the four Stephen fretted and fumed; never had Anna seemed
so dependent. At Morton they now led quite separate lives, yet here
in London they were always together. Scheme as she might she could
find no excuse for a solitary visit to Bond Street. However, on the
morning of the fourth and last day, Anna succumbed to a devastating
headache.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'I think I'll go and get some air, if you really
don't need me&mdash;I'm feeling energetic!'</p>

<p>'Yes, do&mdash;I don't want you to stay in,' groaned Anna, who
was longing for peace and an aspirin tablet.</p>

<p>Once out on the pavement Stephen hailed the first taxi she met;
she was quite absurdly elated. 'Drive to the Piccadilly end of Bond
Street,' she ordered, as she jumped in and slammed the door. Then
she put her head quickly out of the window: 'And when you get to
the corner, please stop. I don't want you to drive along Bond
Street, I'll walk. I want you to stop at the Piccadilly
corner.'</p>

<p>But when she was actually standing on the corner&mdash;the
left-hand corner&mdash;she began to feel doubtful as to which side
of Bond Street she ought to tackle first. Should she try the right
side or keep to the left? She decided to try the right side.
Crossing over, she started to walk along slowly. At every
jeweller's shop she stood still and gazed at the wares displayed in
the window. Now she was worried by quite a new problem, the problem
of stones, there were so many kinds. Emeralds or rubies or perhaps
just plain diamonds? Well, certainly neither emeralds nor
rubies&mdash;Angela's colouring demanded whiteness.
Whiteness&mdash;she had it! Pearls&mdash;no, one pearl, one
flawless pearl and set as a ring. Angela had once described such a
ring with envy, but alas, it had been born in Paris.</p>

<p>People stared at the masculine-looking girl who seemed so intent
upon feminine adornments. And someone, a man, laughed and nudged
his companion: 'Look at that! What is it?'</p>

<p>'My God! What indeed?'</p>

<p>She heard them and suddenly felt less elated as she made her way
into the shop.</p>

<p>She said rather loudly: 'I want a pearl ring.'</p>

<p>'A pearl ring? What kind, madam?'</p>

<p>She hesitated, unable now to describe what she did want: 'I
don't quite know&mdash;but it must be a large one.'</p>

<p>'For yourself?' And she thought that the man smiled a
little.</p>

<p>Of course he did nothing of the kind; but she stammered:
'No&mdash;oh, no&mdash;it's not for myself, it's for a friend.
She's asked me to choose her a large pearl ring: To her own ears
the words sounded foolish and flustered.</p>

<p>There was nothing in that shop that fulfilled her requirements,
so once more she must face the guns of Bond Street. Now she
quickened her steps and found herself striding; modifying her pace
she found herself dawdling; and always she was conscious of people
who stared, or whom she imagined were staring. She felt sure that
the shop assistants looked doubtful when she asked for a large and
flawless pearl ring; and catching a glimpse of her reflection in a
glass, she decided that naturally they would look
doubtful&mdash;her appearance suggested neither pearls nor their
price. She slipped a surreptitious hand into her pocket, gaining
courage from the comforting feel of her cheque book.</p>

<p>When the east side of the thoroughfare had been exhausted, she
crossed over quickly and made her way back towards her original
corner. By now she was rather depressed and disgruntled. Supposing
that she did not find what she wanted in Bond Street? She had no
idea where else to look&mdash;her knowledge of London was far from
extensive. But apparently the gods were feeling propitious, for a
little further on she paused in front of a small, and as she
thought, quite humble shop. As a matter of fact it was anything but
humble, hence the bars half-way up its unostentatious window. Then
she stared, for there on a white velvet cushion lay a pearl that
looked like a round gleaming marble, a marble attached to a slender
circlet of platinum&mdash;some sort of celestial marble! It was
just such a ring as Angela had seen in Paris, and had since never
ceased to envy.</p>

<p>The person behind this counter was imposing. He was old, and
wore glasses with tortoiseshell rims: 'Yes, madam, it's a very fine
specimen indeed. The setting's French, just a thin band of
platinum, there's nothing to detract from the beauty of the
pearl.'</p>

<p>He lifted it tenderly off its cushion, and as tenderly Stephen
let it rest on her palm. It shone whiter than white against her
skin, which by contrast looked sunburnt and weather-beaten.</p>

<p>Then the dignified old gentleman murmured the price, glancing
curiously at the girl as he did so, but she seemed to be quite
unperturbed, so he said: 'Will you try the effect of the ring on
your finger?'</p>

<p>At this, however, his customer flushed: 'It wouldn't go anywhere
near my finger!'</p>

<p>'I can have it enlarged to any size you wish.'</p>

<p>'Thanks, but it's not for me&mdash;it's for a friend.'</p>

<p>'Have you any idea what size your friend takes, say in gloves?
Is her hand large or small do you think?'</p>

<p>Stephen answered promptly: 'It's a very small hand,' then
immediately looked and felt rather self-conscious.</p>

<p>And now the old gentleman was openly staring: 'Excuse me,' he
murmured, 'an extraordinary likeness...' Then more boldly: 'Do you
happen to be related to Sir Philip Gordon of Morton Hall, who
died&mdash;it must be about two years ago&mdash;from some accident?
I believe a tree fell&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I'm his daughter,' said Stephen.</p>

<p>He nodded and smiled: 'Of course, of course, you couldn't be
anything but his daughter.'</p>

<p>'You knew my father?' she inquired, in surprise.</p>

<p>'Very well, Miss Gordon, when your father was young. In those
days Sir Philip was a customer of mine. I sold him his first pearl
studs while he was at Oxford, and at least four scarf pins&mdash;a
bit of a dandy Sir Philip was up at Oxford. But what may interest
you is the fact that I nude your mother's engagement ring for him;
a large half-hoop of very fine diamonds&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Did you make that ring?'</p>

<p>'I did, Miss Gordon. I remember quite well his showing me a
miniature of Lady Anna&mdash;I remember his words. He said: "She's
so pure that only the purest stones are fit to touch her finger."
You see, he'd known me ever since he was at Eton, that's why he
spoke of your mother to me&mdash;I felt deeply honoured. Ah,
yes&mdash;dear, dear&mdash;your father was young then and very much
in love...'</p>

<p>She said suddenly: 'Is this pearl as pure as those diamonds?'
And he answered: 'It's without a blemish.'</p>

<p>Then she found her cheque book and he gave her his pen with
which to write out the very large cheque.</p>

<p>'Wouldn't you like some reference?' she inquired, as she glanced
at the sum for which he must trust her.</p>

<p>But at this he laughed: 'Your face is your reference, if I may
be allowed to say so, Miss Gordon.'</p>

<p>They shook hands because he had known her father, and she left
the shop with the ring in her pocket. As she walked down the street
she was lost in thought, so that if people stared she no longer
noticed. In her ears kept sounding those words from the past, those
words of her father's when long, long ago he too had been a young
lover: She's so pure that only the purest stones are fit to touch
her finger.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>When they got back to Morton there was Puddle in the hall, with
that warm smile of hers, always just a little mocking yet pitiful
too, that queer composite smile that made her face so arresting.
And the sight of this faithful little grey woman brought home to
Stephen the fact that she had missed her. She had missed her, she
found, out of all proportion to the size of the creature, which
seemed to have diminished. Coming back to it after those weeks of
absence, Puddle's smallness seemed to be even smaller, and Stephen
could not help laughing as she hugged her. Then she suddenly lifted
her right off her feet with as much ease as though she had been a
baby.</p>

<p>Morton smelt good with its log fires burning, and Morton looked
good with the goodness of home. Stephen sighed with something very
like contentment: 'Lord! I'm so glad to be back again, Puddle. I
must have been a cat in my last incarnation; I hate strange
places&mdash;especially Cornwall.'</p>

<p>Puddle smiled grimly. She thought that she knew why Stephen had
hated Cornwall.</p>

<p>After tea Stephen wandered about the house, touching first this,
then that, with affectionate fingers. But presently she went off to
the stables with sugar for Collins and carrots for Raftery; and
there in his spacious, hay-scented loose box, Raftery was waiting
for Stephen. He made a queer little sound in his throat, and his
soft Irish eyes said: 'You're home, home, home. I've grown tired
with waiting, and with wishing you home.'</p>

<p>And she answered: 'Yes, I've come back to you, Raftery.'</p>

<p>Then she threw her strong arm around his neck, and they talked
together for quite a long while&mdash;not in Irish or English but
in a quiet language having very few words but many small sounds and
many small movements, that meant much more than words.</p>

<p>'Since you went I've discovered a wonderful thing,' he told her,
'I've discovered that for me you are God. It's like that sometimes
with us humbler people, we may only know God through His human
image.'</p>

<p>'Raftery,' she murmured, 'oh, Raftery, my dear&mdash;I was so
young when you came to Morton. Do you remember that first day out
hunting when you jumped the huge hedge in our big north paddock?
What a jump! It ought to go down to history. You were splendidly
cool and collected about it. Thank the Lord you were&mdash;I was
only a kid, all the same it was very foolish of us, Raftery.'</p>

<p>She gave him a carrot, which he took with contentment from the
hand of his God, and proceeded to munch. And she watched him munch
it, contented in her turn, hoping that the carrot was succulent and
sweet; hoping that his innocent cup of pleasure might be full to
the brim and overflowing. Like God indeed, she tended his needs,
mixing the evening meal in his manger, holding the water bucket to
his lips while he sucked in the cool, clear, health-giving water. A
groom came along with fresh trusses of straw which he opened and
tossed among Raftery's bedding; then he took off the smart blue and
red day clothing, and buckled him up in a warm night blanket.
Beyond in the far loose box by the window, Sir Philip's young
chestnut kicked loudly for supper.</p>

<p>'Woa horse! Get up there! Stop kicking them boards!' And the
groom hurried off to attend to the chestnut.</p>

<p>Collins, who had spat out his two lumps of sugar, was now busy
indulging his morbid passion. His sides were swollen well night to
bursting&mdash;blown out like an air balloon was old Collins from
the evil and dyspeptic effects of the straw, plus his own woeful
lack of molars. He stared at Stephen with whitish-blue eyes that
saw nothing, and when she touched him he grunted&mdash;a
discourteous sound which meant: 'Leave me alone!' So after a mild
reproof she left him to his sins and his indigestion.</p>

<p>Last but not least, she strolled down to the home of the
two-legged creature who had once reigned supreme in those princely
but now depleted stables. And the lamplight streamed out through
uncurtained windows to meet her, so that she walked on lamplight. A
slim streak of gold led right up to the porch of old Williams'
comfortable cottage. She found him sitting with the Bible on his
knees, peering crossly down at the Scriptures through his glasses.
He had taken to reading the Scriptures aloud to himself&mdash;a
melancholy occupation. He was at this now. As Stephen entered she
could hear him mumbling from Revelation: 'And the heads of the
horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued
fire and smoke and brimstone.'</p>

<p>He looked up, and hastily twitched off his glasses: 'Miss
Stephen!'</p>

<p>'Sit still&mdash;stop where you are, Williams.'</p>

<p>But Williams had the arrogance of the humble. He was proud of
the stern traditions of his service, and his pride forbade him to
sit in her presence, in spite of their long and kind years of
friendship. Yet when he spoke he must grumble a little, as though
she were still the very small child who had swaggered round the
stables rubbing her chin, imitating his every expression and
gesture.</p>

<p>'You didn't ought to have no 'orses, Miss Stephen, the way you
runs off and leaves them,' he grumbled. Raftery's been off 'is feed
these last days. I've been talkin' to that Jim what you sets such
store by! Impudent young blight, 'e answered me back like as though
I'd no right to express me opinion. But I says to 'im: "You just
wait, lad," I says, "You wait until I gets 'old of Miss
Stephen!"'</p>

<p>For Williams could never keep clear of the stables, and could
never refrain from nagging when he got there. Deposed he might be,
but not yet defeated even by old age, as grooms knew to their cost.
The tap of his heavy oak stick in the yard was enough to send Jim
and his underling flying to hide curry-combs and brushes out of
sight. Williams needed no glasses when it came to disorder.</p>

<p>'Be this place 'ere a stable or be it a pigsty, I wonder e' was
now his habitual greeting.</p>

<p>His wife came bustling in from the kitchen: Sit down, Miss
Stephen,' and she dusted a chair.</p>

<p>Stephen sat down and glanced at the Bible where it lay, still
open, on the table.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Williams, dourly, as though she had spoken, 'I'm
reduced to readin' about 'eavenly 'orses. A nice endin' that for a
man like me, what's been in the service of Sir Philip Gordon,
what's 'ad 'is legs across the best 'unters as ever was seen in
this county or any! And I don't believe in them lion-headed beasts
breathin' fire and brimstone, it's all agin nature. Whoever it was
wrote them Revelations, can't never have been inside of a stable. I
don't believe in no 'eavenly 'orses neither&mdash;there won't be no
'orses in 'eaven; and a good thing too, judgin' by the
description.'</p>

<p>'I'm surprised at you, Arth-thur, bein' so disrespectful to The
Book!' his wife reproached him gravely.</p>

<p>'Well, it ain't no encyclopaedee to the stable, and that's a
sure thing,' grinned Williams.</p>

<p>Stephen looked from one to the other. They were old, very old,
fast approaching completion. Quite soon, their circle would be
complete, and then Williams would be able to tackle Saint John on
the points of those heavenly horses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams glanced apologetically at her: 'Excuse 'im, Miss
Stephen, 'e's gettin' rather childish. 'E won't read no pretty
parts of the Book; all e'll read is them parts about chariots and
such-like. All what's to do with 'orses 'e reads; and then 'e's so
unbelievin'&mdash;it's aw-ful!' But she looked at her mate with the
eyes of a mother, very gentle and tolerant eyes.</p>

<p>And Stephen, seeing those two together, could picture them as
they must once have been, in the halcyon days of their youthful
vigour. For she thought that she glimpsed through the dust of the
years, a faint flicker of the girl who had lingered in the lanes
when the young man Williams and she had been courting. And looking
at Williams as he stood before her twitching and bowed, she thought
that she glimpsed a faint flicker of the youth, very stalwart and
comely, who had bent his head downwards and sideways, as he walked
and whispered and kissed in the lanes. And because they were old
yet undivided, her heart ached; not for them but rather for
Stephen. Her youth seemed as dross when compared to their
honourable age; because they were undivided.</p>

<p>She said: 'Make him sit down, I don't want him to stand.' And
she got up and pushed her own chair towards him.</p>

<p>But old Mrs. Williams shook her white head slowly: 'No, Miss
Stephen, 'e wouldn't sit down in your presence. Beggin' your
pardon, it would 'urt Arth-thur's feelin's to be made to sit down;
it would make 'im feel as 'is days of service was really over.'</p>

<p>'I don't need to sit down,' declared Williams.</p>

<p>So Stephen wished them both a good night, promising to come
again very soon; and Williams hobbled out to the path which was now
quite golden from border to border, for the door of the cottage was
standing wide open and the glow from the lamp streamed over the
path. Once more she found herself walking on lamplight, while
Williams, bareheaded, stood and watched her departure. Then her
feet were caught up and entangled in shadows again, as she made her
way under the trees.</p>

<p>But presently came a familiar fragrance&mdash;logs burning on
the wide, friendly hearths of Morton. Logs burning&mdash;quite soon
the lakes would be frozen&mdash;'and the ice looks like slabs of
gold in the sunset, when you and I come and stand here in the
winter...and as we walk back we can smell the log fires long before
we can see them, and we love that good smell because it means home,
and our home is Morton...because it means home and our home is
Morton...</p>

<p>Oh, intolerable fragrance of log fires burning!</p>

<h3><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter Twenty-three</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Angela did not return in a week, she had decided to remain
another fortnight in Scotland. She was staying now with the
Peacocks, it seemed, and would not get back until after her
birthday. Stephen looked at the beautiful ring as it gleamed in its
little white velvet box, and her disappointment and chagrin were
childish.</p>

<p>But Violet Antrim, who had also been staying with the Peacocks,
had arrived home full of importance. She walked in on Stephen one
afternoon to announce her engagement to young Alec Peacock. She was
so much engaged and so haughty about it that Stephen, whose nerves
were already on edge, was very soon literally itching to slap her.
Violet was now able to look down on Stephen from the height of her
newly gained knowledge of men&mdash;knowing Alec she felt that she
knew the whole species.</p>

<p>'It's a terrible pity you dress as you do, my dear,' she
remarked, with the manner of sixty, 'a young girl's so much more
attractive when she's soft&mdash;don't you think you could soften
your clothes just a little? I mean you do want to get married,
don't you! No woman's complete until she is married. After all, no
woman can really stand alone, she always needs a man to protect
her.'</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'I'm all right&mdash;getting on nicely, thank
you!'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, but you can't be!' Violet insisted. 'I was talking to
Alec and Roger about you, and Roger was saying it's an awful
mistake for women to get false ideas into their heads. He thinks
you've got rather a bee in your bonnet; he told Alec that you'd be
quite a womanly woman if you'd only stop trying to ape what you're
not.' Presently she said, staring rather hard: 'That Mrs.
Crossby&mdash;do you really like her? Of course I know you're
friends and all that&mdash;But why are you friends? You've got
nothing in common. She's what Roger calls a thorough man's woman. I
think myself she's a bit of a climber. Do you want to be used as a
scaling ladder for storming the fortifications of the county? The
Peacocks have known old Crossby for years, he's a wonderful shot
for an ironmonger, but they don't care for her very much I
believe&mdash;Alec says she's man-mad, whatever that means, anyhow
she seems desperately keen about Roger.'</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'I'd rather we didn't discuss Mrs. Crossby,
because, you see, she's my friend.' And her voice was as icy cold
as her hands.</p>

<p>'Oh, of course if you're feeling like that about it&mdash;'
laughed Violet, 'no, but honest, she is keen on Roger.'</p>

<p>When Violet had gone, Stephen sprang to her feet, but her sense
of direction seemed to have left her, for she struck her head a
pretty sharp blow against the side of a heavy bookcase. She stood
swaying with her hands pressed against her temples. Angela and
Roger Antrim&mdash;those two&mdash;but it couldn't be, Violet had
been purposely lying. She loved to torment, she was like her
brother, a bully, a devil who loved to torment&mdash;it couldn't
be&mdash;Violet had been lying.</p>

<p>She steadied herself and leaving the room and the house, went
and fetched her car from the stables. She drove to the telegraph
office at Upton: 'Come back, I must see you at once,' she wired,
taking great care to prepay the reply, lest Angela should find an
excuse for not answering.</p>

<p>The clerk counted the words with her stump of a pencil, then she
looked at Stephen rather strangely.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The next morning came Angela's frigid answer: 'Coming home
Monday fortnight not one day sooner please no more wires Ralph very
much upset.'</p>

<p>Stephen tore the thing into a hundred fragments and then hurled
it away. She was suddenly shaking all over with uncontrollable
anger.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Right up to the moment of Angela's return that hot anger
supported Stephen. It was like a flame that leapt through her
veins, a flame that consumed and yet stimulated, so that she
purposely fanned the fire from a sense of self-preservation.</p>

<p>Then came the actual day of arrival. Angela must be in London by
now, she would certainly have travelled by the night express. She
would catch the 12.47 to Malvern and then motor to Upton&mdash;it
was nearly twelve. It was afternoon. At 3.17 Angela's train would
arrive at Great Malvern&mdash;it had arrived now&mdash;in about
twenty minutes she would drive past the very gates of Morton.
Half-past four. Angela must have got home; she was probably having
tea in the parlour&mdash;in the little oak parlour with its piping
bullfinch whose cage always stood near the casement window. A long
time ago, a lifetime ago, Stephen had blundered into that parlour,
and Tony had barked, and the bullfinch had piped a sentimental old
German tune&mdash;but that was surely a lifetime ago. Five o'clock.
Violet Antrim had obviously lied; she had lied on purpose to
torment Stephen&mdash;Angela and Roger&mdash;it couldn't be; Violet
had lied because she liked to torment. A quarter-past five. What
was Angela doing now? She was near, just a few miles
away&mdash;perhaps she was ill, as she had not written; yes, that
must be it, of course Angela was ill. The persistent, aching hunger
of the eyes. Anger, what was it? A folly, a delusion, a weakness
that crumbled before that hunger. And Angela was only a few miles
away.</p>

<p>She went up to her room and unlocked a drawer from which she
took the little white case. Then she slipped the case into her
jacket pocket.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Sim found Angela helping her maid to unpack; they appeared to be
all but snowed under by masses of soft, inadequate garments. The
bedroom smelt strongly of Angela's scent, which was heavy yet
slightly pungent.</p>

<p>She glanced up from a tumbled heap of silk stockings: 'Hallo,
Stephen!' Her greeting was casually friendly.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'Well, how are you after all these weeks? Did you
have a good journey down from Scotland?'</p>

<p>The maid said: 'Shall I wash your new crepe de Chine nightgowns,
ma'am? Or ought they to go to the cleaners?'</p>

<p>Then, somehow, they all fell silent.</p>

<p>To break this suggestive and awkward silence, Stephen inquired
politely after Ralph.</p>

<p>'He's in London on business for a couple of days; he's all
right, thanks,' Angela answered briefly, and she turned once more
to sorting her stockings.</p>

<p>Stephen studied her. Angela was not looking well, her mouth had
a childish droop at the corners; there were quite new shadows, too,
under her eyes, and these shadows accentuated her pallor. And as
though that earnest gaze made her nervous, she suddenly bundled the
stockings together with a little sound of impatience.</p>

<p>'Come on, let's go down to my room!' And turning to her maid:
'I'd rather you washed the new nightgowns, please.'</p>

<p>They went down the wide oak stairs without speaking, and into
the little oak-panelled parlour. Stephen closed the door; then they
faced each other.</p>

<p>'Well, Angela?'</p>

<p>'Well, Stephen?' And after a pause: 'What on earth made you send
that absurd telegram? Ralph got hold of the thing and began to ask
questions. You are such an almighty fool sometimes&mdash;you knew
perfectly well that I couldn't come back. Why will you behave as
though you were six, have you no common sense? What's it all about?
Your methods are not only infantile&mdash;they're dangerous.'</p>

<p>Then taking Angela firmly by the shoulders, Stephen turned her
so that she faced the light. She put her question with youthful
crudeness: 'Do you find Roger Antrim physically attractive&mdash;do
you find that he attracts you that way more than I do?' She waited
calmly, it seemed, for her answer.</p>

<p>And because of that distinctly ominous calm, Angela was scared,
so she blustered a little: 'Of course I don't! I resent such
questions; I won't allow them even from you, Stephen. God knows
where you get your fantastic ideas! Have you been discussing me
with that girl Violet? If you have, I think it's simply outrageous!
She's quite the most evil-minded prig in the county. It was not
very gentlemanly of you, my dear, to discuss my affairs with our
neighbours, was it?'</p>

<p>'I refused to discuss you with Violet Antrim,' Stephen told her,
still speaking quite calmly. But she clung to her point: 'Was it
all a mistake? Is there no one between us except your husband?
Angela, look at me&mdash;I will have the truth.'</p>

<p>For answer Angela kissed her.</p>

<p>Stephen's strong but unhappy arms went round her, and suddenly
stretching out her hand she switched off the little lamp on the
table, so that the room was lit only by firelight. They could not
see each other's faces very clearly any more, because there was
only firelight. And Stephen spoke such words as a lover will speak
when his heart is burdened to breaking; when his doubts must bow
down and be swept away before the unruly flood of his passion.
There in that shadowy, firelit room, she spoke such words as lovers
have spoken ever since the divine, sweet madness of God flung the
thought of love into Creation.</p>

<p>But Angela suddenly pushed her away: 'Don't, don't&mdash;I can't
bear it&mdash;it's too much, Stephen. It hurts me&mdash;I can't
bear this thing&mdash;for you. It's all wrong, I'm not worth it,
anyhow it's all wrong. Stephen, it's making me&mdash;can't you
understand? It's too much&mdash;' She could not, she dared not
explain. 'If you were a man&mdash;' She stopped abruptly, and burst
into uncontrollable weeping.</p>

<p>And somehow this weeping was different from any that had gone
before, so that Stephen trembled. There was something frightened
and desolate about it; it was like the sobbing of a terrified
child. The girl forgot her own desolation in her pity and the need
that she felt to comfort. More strongly than ever before she felt
the need to protect this woman, and to comfort.</p>

<p>She said, grown suddenly passionless and gentle: 'Tell
me&mdash;try to tell me what's wrong, beloved. Don't be afraid of
making me angry&mdash;we love each other, and that's all that
matters. Try to tell me what's wrong, and then let me help you;
only don't cry like this&mdash;I can't endure it.'</p>

<p>But Angela hid her face in her hands: 'No, no, it's nothing; I'm
only so tired. It's been a fearful strain these last months. I'm
just a weak, human creature, Stephen&mdash;sometimes I think we've
been worse than mad. I must have been mad to have allowed you to
love me like this&mdash;one day you'll despise and hate me. It's my
fault, but I was so terribly lonely that I let you come into my
life, and now&mdash;oh, I can't explain, you wouldn't understand;
how could you understand, Stephen?'</p>

<p>And so strangely complex is poor human nature, that Angela
really believed in her feelings. At that moment of sudden fear and
remorse, remembering those guilty weeks in Scotland, she believed
that she felt compassion and regret for this creature who loved
her, and whose ardent loving had paved the way for another. In her
weakness she could not part from the girl, not yet&mdash;there was
something so strong about her. She seemed to combine the strength
of a man with the gentler and more subtle strength of a woman. And
thinking of the crude young animal Roger, with his brusque, rather
brutal appeal to the senses, she was filled with a kind of
regretful shame, and she hated herself for what she had done, and
for what she well knew she would do again, because of that urge to
passion.</p>

<p>Feeling humble, she groped for the girl's kind hand; then she
tried to speak lightly: 'Would you always forgive this very
miserable sinner, Stephen?'</p>

<p>Stephen said, not apprehending her meaning, 'If our love is a
sin, then heaven must be full of such tender and selfless sinning
as ours.'</p>

<p>They sat down close together. They were weary unto death, and
Angela whispered: 'Put your arms around me again&mdash;but gently,
because I'm so tired. You're a kind lover, Stephen&mdash;sometimes
I think you're almost too kind.'</p>

<p>And Stephen answered: 'It's not kindness that makes me unwilling
to force you&mdash;I can't conceive of that sort of love.'</p>

<p>Angela Crossby was silent.</p>

<p>But now she was longing for the subtle easement of confession,
so dear to the soul of woman. Her self-pity was augmented by her
sense of wrong-doing&mdash;she was thoroughly unstrung, almost ill
with self pity&mdash;so that lacking the courage to confess the
present, she let her thoughts dwell on the past. Stephen had always
forborne to question, and therefore that past had never been
discussed, but now Angela felt a great need to discuss it. She did
not analyse her feelings; she only knew that she longed intensely
to humble herself, to plead for compassion, to wring from the
queer, strong, sensitive being who loved her, some hope of ultimate
forgiveness. At that moment, as she lay there in Stephen's arms,
the girl assumed an enormous importance. It was strange, but the
very fact of betrayal appeared to have strengthened her will to
hold her, and Angela stirred, so that Stephen said softly:</p>

<p>'Lie still&mdash;I thought you were fast asleep.'</p>

<p>And Angela answered: 'No, I'm not asleep, dearest. I've been
thinking. There arc some things I ought to tell you. You've never
asked me about my past life&mdash;why haven't you, Stephen?'</p>

<p>'Because,' said Stephen, 'I knew that some day you'd tell me.'
Then Angela began at the very beginning. She described a Colonial
home in Virginia. A grave, grey house, with a columned entrance,
and a garden that looked down on deep, running water, and that
water had rather a beautiful name&mdash;it was called the Potomac
River. Up the side of the house grew magnolia blossoms, and many
old trees gave their shade to its garden. In summer the fire-flies
lit lamps on those trees, shifting lamps that moved swiftly among
the branches. And the hot summer darkness was splashed with
lightning, and the hot summer air was heavy with sweetness.</p>

<p>She described her mother who had died when Angela was
twelve&mdash;a pathetic, inadequate creature; the descendant of
women who had owned many slaves to minister to their most trivial
requirements: 'She could hardly put on her own stockings and
shoes,' smiled Angela, as she pictured that mother.</p>

<p>She described her father, George Benjamin Maxwell&mdash;a
charming, but quite incorrigible spendthrift. She said: 'He lived
in past glories, Stephen. Because he was a Maxwell&mdash;a Maxwell
of Virginia&mdash;he wouldn't admit that the Civil War had deprived
us all of the right to spend money. God knows, there was little
enough of it left&mdash;the War practically ruined the old Southern
gentry! My grandma could remember those days quite well; she
scraped lint from her sheets for our wounded soldiers. If Grandma
had lived, my life might have been different&mdash;but she died a
couple of months after Mother.'</p>

<p>She described the eventual cataclysm, when the home had been
sold up with everything in it, and she and her father had set out
for New York&mdash;she just seventeen and he broken and
ailing&mdash;to rebuild his dissipated fortune. And because she was
now painting a picture of real life, untinged by imagination, her
words lived, and her voice grew intensely bitter.</p>

<p>'Hell&mdash;it was hell! We went under so quickly. There were
days when I hadn't enough to eat. Oh, Stephen, the filth, the
unspeakable squalor&mdash;the heat and the cold and the hunger and
the squalor. God, how I hate that great hideous city! It's a
monster, it crushes you down, it devours&mdash;even now I couldn't
go back to New York without feeling a kind of unreasoning terror.
Stephen, that damnable city broke my nerve. Father got calmly out
of it all by dying one day&mdash;and that was so like him! He'd had
about enough, so he just lay down and died; but I couldn't do that
because I was young&mdash;and I didn't want to die, either. I
hadn't the least idea what I could do, but I knew that I was
supposed to be pretty and that good-looking girls had a chance on
the stage, so I started out to look for a job. My God! Shall I ever
forget it!'</p>

<p>And now she described the long, angular streets, miles and miles
of streets; miles and miles of faces all strange and
unfriendly&mdash;faces like masks. Then the intimate faces of
would-be employers, too intimate when they peered into her
own&mdash;faces that had suddenly thrown off their masks.</p>

<p>Stephen, are you listening? I put up a fight, I swear it! I
swear I put up a fight&mdash;I was only nineteen when I got my
first job&mdash;nineteen's not so awfully old, is it, Stephen?'</p>

<p>Stephen said: Go on,' and her voice sounded husky.</p>

<p>Oh, my dear&mdash;it's so dreadfully hard to tell you. The pay
was rotten, not enough to live on&mdash;I used to think that they
did it on purpose, lots of the girls used to think that way
too&mdash;they never gave us quite enough to live on. You see, I
hadn't a vestige of talent, I could only dress up and try to look
pretty. I never got a real speaking part, I just danced, not well,
but I'd got a good figure.' She paused and tried to look up through
the gloom, but Stephen's face was hidden in shadow. Well then,
darling&mdash;Stephen, I want to feel your arms, hold me
closer&mdash;well then I&mdash;there was a man who wanted
me&mdash;not as you want me, Stephen, to protect and care for me;
God no, not that way! And I was so poor and so tired and so
frightened; why sometimes my shoes would let in the slush because
they were old and I hadn't the money to buy myself new
ones&mdash;try to think of that, darling. And I'd cry when I washed
my hands in the winter because they'd be bleeding from broken
chilblains. Well, I couldn't stay the course any longer, that's
all...</p>

<p>The little gilt dock on the desk ticked loudly. Tick, tick!
Tick, tick! An astonishing voice to come from so small and fragile
a body. Somewhere out in the garden a dog barked&mdash;Tony,
chasing imaginary rabbits through the darkness.</p>

<p>'Stephen!'</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear?'</p>

<p>'Have you understood me?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;oh, yes, I've understood you. Go on.'</p>

<p>'Well then, after a while he turned round and left me, and I
just had to drag along as I had done, and I sort of crocked
up&mdash;couldn't sleep at night, couldn't smile and look happy
when I went on to dance&mdash;that was how Ralph found me&mdash;he
saw me dance and came round to the back, the way some men do. I
remember thinking that Ralph didn't look like that sort of man; he
looked&mdash;well, just like Ralph, not a bit like that sort of
man. Then he started sending me flowers; never presents or anything
like that, just flowers with his card. And we had lunch together a
good few times, and he talked about that other man who'd left me.
He said he'd like to go out with a horse-whip&mdash;imagine Ralph
trying to horse-whip a man! They knew each other quite well, I
discovered; you see, they were both in the hardware business. Ralph
was out after some big contract for his firm, that was why he
happened to be in New York&mdash;and one day he asked me to marry
him, Stephen. I suppose he was really in love with me then, anyhow
I thought it was wonderful of him&mdash;I thought he was very
broadminded and noble. Good God! He's had his pound of flesh since;
it gave him the hold over me that he wanted. We were married before
we sailed for Europe. I wasn't in love, but what could I do? I'd
nowhere to turn and my health was crocking; lots of our girls ended
up in the hospital wards&mdash;I didn't want to end up that way.
Well, so you see why I've got to be careful how I act; he's
terribly and awfully suspicious. He thinks that because I took a
lover when I was literally down and out, I'm likely to do the same
thing now. He doesn't trust me, it's natural enough, but sometimes
he throws it all up in my face, and when he does that, my God, how
I hate him! But oh, Stephen, I could never go through it all
again&mdash;I haven't got an ounce of fight left in me. That's why,
although Ralph's no cinch as a husband, I'd be scared to death if
he really turned nasty. He knows that, I think, so he's not afraid
to bully&mdash;he's bullied me many a time over you&mdash;but of
course you're a woman so he couldn't divorce me&mdash;I expect
that's really what makes him so angry. All the same, when you asked
me to leave him for you, I hadn't the courage to face that either.
I couldn't have faced the public scandal that Ralph would have
made; he'd have hounded us down to the ends of the earth, he'd have
branded us, Stephen. I know him, he's revengeful, he'd stop at
nothing, that weak sort of man is often that way. It's as though
what Ralph lacks in virility, he tries to make up for by being
revengeful. My dear, I couldn't go under again&mdash;I couldn't be
one of those apologetic people who must always exist just under the
surface, only coming up for a moment, like fish&mdash;I've been
through that particular hell. I want life, and yet I'm always
afraid. Every time that Ralph looks at me I feel frightened,
because he knows that I hate him most when he tries to make
love&mdash;' She broke off abruptly.</p>

<p>And now she was crying a little to herself, letting the tears
trickle down unheeded. One of them splashed on to Stephen's coat
sleeve and lay there, a small, dark blot on the cloth, while the
patient arms never faltered.</p>

<p>'Stephen, say something&mdash;say you don't hate me!'</p>

<p>A log crashed, sending up a bright spurt of flame, and Stephen
stared down into Angela's face. It was marred by weeping; it looked
almost ugly, splotched and reddened as it was by her weeping. And
because of that pitiful, blemished face, with the pitiful weakness
that lay behind it, the unworthiness even, Stephen loved her so
deeply at that moment, that she found no adequate words.</p>

<p>'Say something&mdash;speak to me, Stephen!'</p>

<p>Then Stephen gently released her arms, and she found the little
white box in her pocket: 'Look, Angela, I got you this for your
birthday&mdash;Ralph can't bully you about it, it's a birthday
present.'</p>

<p>'Stephen&mdash;my dear!'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;I want you to wear it always, so that you'll remember
how much I love you. I think you forgot that just now when you
talked about hating&mdash;Angela, give me your hand, the hand that
used to bleed in the winter.'</p>

<p>So the pearl that was pure as her mother's diamonds were pure,
Stephen slipped on to Angela's finger. Then she sat very still,
while Angela gazed at the pearl wide-eyed, because of its beauty.
Presently she lifted her wondering face, and now her lips were
quite close to Stephen's, but Stephen kissed her instead on the
forehead. You must rest,' she said, 'you're simply worn out. Can't
you sleep if I keep you safe in my arms?'</p>

<p>For at moments such is the blindness and folly, yet withal the
redeeming glory of love.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter Twenty-four</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Ralph said very little about the ring. What could he say? A
present given to his wife by the daughter of a neighbour&mdash;an
unusually costly present of course&mdash;still, after all, what
could he say? He took refuge in sulky silence. But Stephen would
see him staring at the pearl, which Angela wore on her right-hand
third finger, and his weak little eyes would look redder than
usual, perhaps with anger&mdash;one could never quite tell from his
eyes whether he was tearful or angry.</p>

<p>And because of those eyes with their constant menace, Stephen
must play her conciliatory role; and this she must do in spite of
his rudeness, for now he was openly rude and hostile. And he
bullied. It was almost as though he took pleasure in bullying his
wife when Stephen was present; her presence seemed to arouse in the
man everything that was ill-bred, petty and cruel. He would make
thinly-veiled allusions to the past, glancing sideways at Stephen
the while he did so; and one day when she flushed to the roots of
her hair with rage to see Angela humble and fearful, he laughed
loudly: 'I'm just a plain tradesman, you know; if you don't like my
ways then you'd better not come here.' Catching Angela's eye,
Stephen tried to laugh too.</p>

<p>A soul-sickening business. She would feel degraded; she would
feel herself gradually losing all sense of pride, of common decency
even, so that when she returned in the evening to Morton she would
not want to look the old house in the eyes. She would not want to
face those pictures of Gordons that hung in its hall, and must turn
away, lest they by their very silence rebuke this descendant of
theirs who was so unworthy. Yet sometimes it seemed to her that she
loved more intensely because she had lost so much&mdash;there was
nothing left now but Angela Crossby.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Watching this deadly decay that threatened all that was fine in
her erstwhile pupil, Puddle must sometimes groan loudly in spirit;
she must even argue with God about it. Yes, she must actually argue
with God like Job; and remembering his words in affliction, she
must speak those words on behalf of Stephen: 'Thine hands have made
me and fashioned me together round about; yet Thou dost destroy
me.' For now in addition to everything else, she had learnt of the
advent of Roger Antrim. Not that Stephen had confided in her, far
from it, but gossip has a way of travelling quickly. Roger spent
most of his leisure at The Grange. She had heard that he was always
going over from Worcester. So now. Puddle, who had not been much
given to prayer in the past, must argue with God, like Job. And
perhaps, since God probably listens to the heart rather than to the
lips, He forgave her.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Stupid with misery and growing more inept every day, Stephen
found herself no match for Roger. He was calm, self-assured,
insolent and triumphant, and his love of tormenting had not waned
with his manhood. Roger was no fool; he put two and two together
and his masculine instinct deeply resented this creature who might
challenge his right of possession. Moreover that masculine instinct
was outraged. He would stare at Stephen as though she were a horse
whom he strongly suspected of congenital unsoundness, and then he
would let his eyes rest on Angela's face. They would be the eyes of
a lover, possessive, demanding, insistent eyes&mdash;if Ralph did
not happen to be present. And into Angela's eyes there would come
an expression that Stephen had seen many times. A mist would slowly
cloud over their blueness; they would dim, as though they were
hiding something. Then Stephen would be seized with a violent
trembling, so that she could not stand any more but must sit with
her hands clasped tightly together, lest those trembling hands
betray her to Roger. But Roger would have seen already, and would
smile his slow, understanding, masterful smile.</p>

<p>Sometimes he and Stephen would look at each other covertly, and
their youthful faces would be marred by a very abominable thing;
the instinctive repulsion of two human bodies, the one for the
other, which neither could help&mdash;not now that those bodies
were stirred by a woman. Then into this vortex of secret emotion
would come Ralph. He would stare from Stephen to Roger and then at
his wife, and his eyes would be red&mdash;one never knew whether
from tears or from anger. They would form a grotesque triangle for
a moment, those three who must share a common desire. But after a
little the two male creatures who hated each other, would be
shamefully united in the bond of their deeper hatred of Stephen;
and divining this, she in turn would hate.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>It could not go on without some sort of convulsion, and that
Christmas was a time of recriminations. Angela's infatuation was
growing, and she did not always hide this from Stephen. Letters
would arrive in Roger's handwriting, and Stephen, half-crazy with
jealousy by now, would demand to see them. She would be refused,
and a scene would ensue.</p>

<p>'That man's your lover! Have I gone starving only for
this&mdash;that you should give yourself to Roger Antrim? Show me
that letter!'</p>

<p>'How dare you suggest that Roger's my lover! But if he were it's
no business of yours.'</p>

<p>'Will you show me that letter?'</p>

<p>'I will not.'</p>

<p>'It's from Roger.'</p>

<p>'You're intolerable. You can think what you please.'</p>

<p>'What am I to think?' Then because of her longing. 'Angela, for
God's sake don't treat me like this&mdash;I can't bear it. When you
loved me it was easier to bear&mdash;I endured it for your sake,
but now&mdash;listen, listen...' Stark naked confessions dragged
from lips that grew white the while they confessed: 'Angela,
listen...</p>

<p>And now the terrible nerves of the invert, those nerves that are
always lying in wait, gripped Stephen. They ran like live wires
through her body, causing a constant and ruthless torment, so that
the sudden closing of a door or the barking of Tony would fall like
a blow on her shrinking flesh. At night in her bed she must cover
her ears from the ticking of the clock, which would sound like
thunder in the darkness.</p>

<p>Angela had taken to going up to London on some pretext or
another&mdash;she must see her dentist; she must fit a new dress.
'Well then, let me come with you.'</p>

<p>'Good heavens, why? I'm only going to the dentist!'</p>

<p>'All right, I'll come too.'</p>

<p>'You'll do nothing of the kind.' Then Stephen would know why
Angela was going.</p>

<p>All that day she would be haunted by insufferable pictures.
Whatever she did, wherever she went, she would see them together,
Angela and Roger...She would think: 'I'm going mad! I can see them
as clearly as though they were here before me in the room.' And
then she would cover her eyes with her hands, but this would only
strengthen the pictures.</p>

<p>Like some earth-bound spirit she would haunt The Grange on the
pretext of taking Tony for a walk. And there, as likely as not,
would be Ralph wandering about in his bare rose garden. He would
glance up and see her perhaps, and then&mdash;most profound shame
of all&mdash;they would both look guilty, for each would know the
loneliness of the other, and that loneliness would draw them
together for the moment; they would be almost friends in their
hearts.</p>

<p>'Angela's gone up to London, Stephen.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know. She's gone up to fit her new dress.'</p>

<p>Their eyes would drop. Then Ralph might say sharply: 'If you're
after the dog, he's in the kitchen,' and turning his back, he might
make a pretence of examining his standard rose-trees.</p>

<p>Calling Tony, Stephen would walk into Upton, then along the
mist-swept bank of the river. She would stand very still staring
down at the water, but the impulse would pass, and whistling the
dog, she would turn and go hurrying back to Upton.</p>

<p>Then one afternoon Roger came with his car to take Angela for a
drive through the hills. The New Year was slipping into the spring,
and the air smelt of sap and much diligent growing. A warm February
had succeeded the winter. Many birds would be astir on those hills
where lovers might sit unashamed&mdash;where Stephen had sat
holding Angela clasped in her arms, while she eagerly took and gave
kisses. And remembering these things Stephen turned and left them,
unable just then to endure any longer. Going home, she made her way
to the lakes, and there she quite suddenly started weeping. Her
whole body seemed to dissolve itself in weeping; and she flung
herself down on the kind earth of Morton, shedding tears as of
blood. There was no one to witness those tears except the white
swan called Peter.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Terrible, heart-breaking months. She grew gaunt with her
unappeased love for Angela Crossby. And now she would sometimes
turn in despair to the thought of her useless and unspent money.
Thoughts would come that were altogether unworthy, but nevertheless
those thoughts would persist. Roger was not rich; she was rich
already and some day she would be even richer.</p>

<p>She went up to London and chose new clothes at a West End
tailor's; the man in Malvern who had made for her father was
getting old, she would have her suits made in London in future. She
ordered herself a rakish red car; a long-bodied, sixty horsepower
M&eacute;tallurgique. It was one of the fastest cars of its year,
and it certainly cost her a great deal of money. She bought twelve
pairs of gloves, some heavy silk stockings, a square sapphire scarf
pin and a new umbrella. Nor could she resist the lure of pyjamas
made of white cr&ecirc;pe de Chine which she spotted in Bond
Street. The pyjamas led to a man's dressing-gown of
brocade&mdash;an amazingly ornate garment. Then she had her nails
manicured but not polished and from that shop she carried away
toilet water and a box of soap that smelt of carnations and some
cuticle cream for the care of her nails. And last but not least,
she bought a gold bag with a clasp set in diamonds for Angela.</p>

<p>All told she had spent a considerable sum, and this gave her a
fleeting satisfaction. But on her way back in the train to Malvern,
she gazed out of the window with renewed desolation. Money could
not buy the one thing that she needed in life; it could not buy
Angela's love.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>6</b>
</p>

<p>That night she stared at herself in the glass; and even as she
did so she hated her body with its muscular shoulders, its small
compact breasts, and its slender flanks of an athlete. All her life
she must drag this body of hers like a monstrous fetter imposed on
her spirit. This strangely ardent yet sterile body that must
worship yet never be worshipped in return by the creature of its
adoration. She longed to maim it, for it made her feel cruel; it
was so white, so strong and so self-sufficient; yet withal so poor
and unhappy a thing that her eyes filled with tears and her hate
turned to pity. She began to grieve over it, touching her breasts
with pitiful fingers, stroking her shoulders, letting her hands
slip along her straight thighs&mdash;Oh, poor and most desolate
body!</p>

<p>Then she, for whom Puddle was actually praying at that moment,
must now pray also, but blindly; finding few words that seemed
worthy of prayer, few words that seemed to encompass her
meaning&mdash;for she did not know the meaning of herself: But she
loved, and loving groped for the God who had fashioned her, even
unto this bitter loving.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter Twenty-five</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen's troubles had begun to be aggravated by Violet, who was
always driving over to Morton, ostensibly to talk about Alec, in
reality to collect information as to what might be happening at The
Grange. She would stay for hours, very skilfully pumping while she
dropped unwelcome hints anent Roger.</p>

<p>'Father's going to cut down his allowance,' she declared, 'if he
doesn't stop hanging about that woman. Oh, I'm sorry! I always
forget she's your friend&mdash;' Then looking at Stephen with
inquisitive eyes: 'But I can't understand that friendship of yours;
for one thing, how can you put up with Crossby?' And Stephen knew
that yet once again county gossip was rife about her.</p>

<p>Violet was going to be married in September, they would then
live in London, for Alec was a barrister. Their house, it seemed,
was already bespoken: 'A perfect duck of a house in Belgravia,'
where Violet intended to entertain largely on the strength of the
bountiful parent Peacock. She was in the highest possible fettle
these days, invested with an enormous importance in her own eyes,
as also in those of her neighbours. Oh, yes, the whole world smiled
broadly on Violet and her Alec: 'Such a charming young couple,'
said the world, and at once proceeded to shower them with presents.
Apostle tea-spoons arrived in their dozens, so did coffee-pots,
cream-jugs and large fish slices; to say nothing of a heavy silver
bowl from the Hunt, and a massive salver from the grateful Scottish
tenants.</p>

<p>On the wedding day not a few eyes would be wet at the sight of
so youthful a man and maiden 'joined together in an honourable
estate, instituted of God in the time of man's innocency,' For such
ancient traditions&mdash;in spite of the fact that man's innocency
could not even survive one bite of an apple shared with a
woman&mdash;are none the less apt to be deeply moving. There they
would kneel, the young newly wed, ardent yet sanctified by a
blessing, so that all, or at least nearly all, they would do, must
be considered both natural and pleasing to a God in the image of
man created. And the fact that this God, in a thoughtless moment,
had created in His turn those pitiful thousands who must stand for
ever outside His blessing, would in no way disturb the large
congregation or their white surpliced pastor, or the couple who
knelt on the gold-braided, red velvet cushions. And afterwards
there would be plentiful champagne to warm the cooling blood of the
elders, and much shaking of hands and congratulating, and many kind
smiles for the bride and her bridegroom. Some might even murmur a
fleeting prayer in their hearts, as the two departed: 'God bless
them!'</p>

<p>So now Stephen must actually learn at first hand how straight
can run the path of true love, in direct contradiction to the
time-honoured proverb. Must realize more clearly than ever, that
love is only permissible to those who are cut in every respect to
life's pattern; must feel like some ill-conditioned pariah, hiding
her sores under lies and pretences. And after those visits of
Violet Antrim's, her spirits would be at a very low ebb, for she
had not yet gained that steel-bright courage which can only be
forged in the furnace of affliction, and which takes many weary
years in the forging.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The splendid new motor arrived from London, to the great delight
and excitement of Burton. The new suits were completed and worn by
their owner, and Angela's costly gold bag was received with
apparent delight, which seemed rather surprising considering her
erstwhile ban upon presents. Yet could Stephen have known it, this
was not so surprising after all, for the bag infuriated Ralph,
thereby distracting his facile attention for the moment from
something that was far more dangerous.</p>

<p>Filled with an ever-increasing need to believe, Stephen listened
to Angela Crossby: 'You know there's nothing between me and
Roger&mdash;if you don't, then you above all people ought to,' and
her blue, childlike eyes would look up at Stephen, who could never
resist the appeal of their blueness.</p>

<p>And as though to bear out the truth of her words, Roger now came
to The Grange much less often; and when he did come he was quietly
friendly, not at all lover-like if Stephen was present, so that
gradually her need to believe had begun to allay her worst fears.
Yet she knew with the true instinct of the lover, that Angela was
secretly unhappy. She might try to appear light-hearted and
flippant, but her smiles and her jests could not deceive
Stephen.</p>

<p>'You're miserable. What is it?'</p>

<p>And Angela would answer: 'Ralph's been vile to me again&mdash;'
But she would not add that Ralph was daily becoming more suspicious
and more intolerant of Roger Antrim, so that now her deadly fear of
her husband was always at war with her passion.</p>

<p>Sometimes it seemed to the girl that Angela used her as a whip
wherewith to lash Ralph. She would lead Stephen on to show signs of
affection which would never have been permitted in the past.
Ralph's little red eyes would look deeply resentful, and getting up
he would slouch from the room. They would hear the front door being
closed, and would know that he had gone for a walk with Tony. Yet
when they were alone and in comparative safety, there would be
something crude, almost cruel in their kisses; a restless,
dissatisfied, hungry thing&mdash;their lips would seem bent on
scourging their bodies. Neither of them would find deliverance nor
ease from the ache that was in them, for each would be kissing with
a well-nigh intolerable sense of loss, with a passionate knowledge
of separation. After a little they would sit with bent heads, not
speaking because of what might not be spoken; not daring to look
each other in the eyes nor to touch each other, lest they should
cry out against this preposterous lovemaking.</p>

<p>Completely confounded, Stephen racked her brains for anything
that might give them both a respite. She suggested that Angela
should see her fence with a celebrated London fencing master whom
she had bribed to come down to Morton. She tried to arouse an
interest in the car, the splendid new car that had cost so much
money. She tried to find out if Angela had an ungratified wish that
money could fulfil.</p>

<p>'Only tell me what I can do,' she pleaded, but apparently there
was nothing.</p>

<p>Angela came several times to Morton and dutifully attended the
fencing lessons. But they did not go well, for Stephen would
glimpse her staring abstractedly out of the window; then the sly,
agile foil with its blunt-tipped nose, would slip in under
Stephen's guard and shame her.</p>

<p>They would sometimes go far afield in the car, and one night
they stopped at an inn and had dinner&mdash;Angela ringing up her
husband with the old and now threadbare excuse of a breakdown. They
dined in a quiet little room by themselves; the scents of the
garden came in through the window&mdash;warm, significant scents,
for now it was May and many flowers multiplied in that garden.
Never before had they done such a thing as this, they had never
dined all alone at a wayside inn miles away from their homes, just
they two, and Stephen stretched out her hand and covered Angela's
where it rested very white and still on the table. And Stephen's
eyes held an urgent question, for now it was May and the blood of
youth leaps and strains with the sap in early summer. The air
seemed breathless, since neither would speak, afraid of disturbing
the thick, sweet silence&mdash;but Angela shook her head very
slowly. Then they could not eat, for each was filled with the same
and yet with a separate longing; so after a while they must get up
and go, both conscious of a sense of painful frustration.</p>

<p>They drove back on a road that was paved with moonlight, and
presently Angela fell fast asleep like an unhappy child&mdash;she
had taken her hat off and her head lay limply against Stephen's
shoulder. Seeing her thus, so helpless in sleep, Stephen felt
strangely moved, and she drove very slowly, fearful of waking the
woman who slept like a child with her fair head against her
shoulder. The car climbed the steep hill from Ledbury town, and
presently there lay the wide Wye valley whose beauty had saddened a
queer little girl long before she had learnt the pain of all
beauty. And now the valley was bathed in whiteness, while here and
there gleamed a roof or a window, but whitely, as though all the
good valley folk had extinguished their lamps and retired to their
couches. Far away, like dark clouds coming up out of Wales, rose
range upon range of the old Black Mountains, with the tip of
Gadrfawr peering over the others, and the ridge of Pen-cerrig-calch
sharp against the skyline. A little wind ruffled the bracken on the
hillsides, and Angela's hair blew across her closed eyes so that
she stirred and sighed in her sleep. Stephen bent down and began to
soothe her.</p>

<p>Then from out of that still and unearthly night, there crept
upon Stephen an unearthly longing. A longing that was not any more
of the body but rather of the weary and home-sick spirit that
endured the chains of that body. And when she must drive past the
gates of Morton, the longing within her seemed beyond all bearing,
for she wanted to lift the sleeping woman in her arms and carry her
in through those gates; and carry her in through the heavy white
door; and carry her up the wide, shallow staircase, and lay her
down on her own bed, still sleeping, but safe in the good care of
Morton.</p>

<p>Angela suddenly opened her eyes. Where am I?' she muttered,
stupid with sleep. Then after a moment her eyes filled with tears,
and there she sat all huddled up, crying.</p>

<p>Stephen said gently: 'It's all right, don't cry.'</p>

<p>But Angela went on crying.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter Twenty-six</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Like a river that has gradually risen to flood, until it sweeps
everything before it, so now events rose and gathered in strength
towards their inevitable conclusion. At the end of May Ralph must
go to his mother, who was said to be dying at her house in
Brighton. With all his faults he had been a good son, and the
redness of his eyes was indeed from real tears as he kissed his
wife good-bye at the station on his way to his dying mother. The
next morning he wired that his mother was dead, but that he could
not get home for a couple of weeks. As it happened, he gave the
actual day and hour of his return, so that Angela knew it.</p>

<p>The relief of his unexpectedly long absence went to Stephen's
head; she grew much more exacting, suggesting all sorts of intimate
plans. Supposing they went for a few days to London? Supposing they
motored to Symond's Yat and stayed at the little hotel by the
river? They might even push on to Abergavenny and from there motor
up and explore the Black Mountains&mdash;why not? It was glorious
weather.</p>

<p>'Angela, please come away with me, darling&mdash;just for a few
days&mdash;we've never done it, and I've longed to so often. You
can't refuse, there's nothing on earth to prevent your coming.'</p>

<p>But Angela would not make up her mind, she seemed suddenly
anxious about her husband: 'Poor devil, he was awfully fond of his
mother. I oughtn't to go, it would look so heartless with the old
woman dead and Ralph so unhappy&mdash;'</p>

<p>Stephen said bitterly: 'What about me? Do you think I'm never
unhappy?'</p>

<p>So the time slipped by in heartaches and quarrels, for Stephen's
taut nerves were like spurs to her temper, and she stormed or
reproached in her dire disappointment:</p>

<p>'You pretend that you love me and yet you won't come&mdash;and
I've waited so long&mdash;oh, my God, how I've waited! But you're
utterly cruel. And I ask for so little, just to have you with me
for a few days and nights just to sleep with you in my arms; just
to feel you beside me when I wake up in the morning&mdash;I want to
open my eyes and see your face, as though we belonged to each
other. Angela, I swear I wouldn't torment you&mdash;we'd be just as
we are now, if that's what you're afraid of. You must know, after
all these months, that you can trust me&mdash;'</p>

<p>But Angela set her lips and refused: 'No, Stephen, I'm sorry,
but I'd rather not come.'</p>

<p>Then Stephen would feel that life was past bearing, and
sometimes she must ride rather wildly for miles&mdash;now on
Raftery, now on Sir Philip's young chestnut. All alone she would
ride in the early mornings, getting up from a sleepless night
unrefreshed, yet terribly alive because of those nerves that
tortured her luckless body. She would get back to Morton still
unable to rest, and a little later would order the motor and drive
herself across to The Grange, where Angela would usually be
dreading her coming.</p>

<p>Her reception would be cold: 'I'm fairly busy, Stephen&mdash;I
must pay off all these bills before Ralph gets home'; or: 'I've got
a foul headache, so don't scold me this morning; I think if you did
that I just couldn't bear it!' Stephen would flinch as though
struck in the face; she might even turn round and go back to
Morton.</p>

<p>Came the last precious day before Ralph's return, and that day
they did spend quite peaceably together, for Angela seemed bent
upon soothing. She went out of her way to be gentle to Stephen, and
Stephen, quick as always to respond, was very gentle in her turn.
But after they had dined in the little herb garden&mdash;taking
advantage of the hot, still weather&mdash;Angela developed one of
her headaches.</p>

<p>Oh, my Stephen&mdash;oh, darling, my head's too awful. It must
be the thunder&mdash;it's been coming on all day. What a perfectly
damnable thing to happen, on our last evening too&mdash;but I know
this kind well; I'll just have to give in and go to my bed. I'll
take a cachet and then try to sleep, so don't ring me up when you
get back to Morton. Come to-morrow&mdash;come early. I'm so
miserable, darling, when I think that this is our last peaceful
evening&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know. But are you all right to be left?'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course. All I need is to get some sleep. You won't
worry, will you? Promise, my Stephen!'</p>

<p>Stephen hesitated. Quite suddenly Angela was looking very ill,
and her hands were like ice. Swear you'll telephone to me if you
can't get to sleep, then I'll come back at once.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but don't do that, will you, unless I ring up&mdash;I
should hear you, of course, and that would wake me and start my
head throbbing.' Then as though impelled, in spite of herself by
the girl's strange attraction, she lifted her face: 'Kiss me...oh,
God...Stephen!'</p>

<p>'I love you so much&mdash;so much&mdash;' whispered Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>It was past ten o'clock when she got back to Morton: 'Has Angela
Crossby rung up?' she inquired of Puddle, who appeared to have been
waiting in the hall.</p>

<p>'No, she hasn't!' snapped Puddle, who was getting to the stage
when she hated the mere name of Angela Crossby. Then she added:
'You look like nothing on earth; in your place I'd go to bed at
once, Stephen.'</p>

<p>'You go to bed, Puddle, if you're tired&mdash;where's
Mother?'</p>

<p>'In her bath. For heaven's sake do come to bed! I can't bear to
see you looking as you do these days.'</p>

<p>'I'm all right.'</p>

<p>'No, you're not, you're all wrong. Go and look at your
face.'</p>

<p>'I don't very much want to, it doesn't attract me,' smiled
Stephen.</p>

<p>So Puddle went angrily up to her room, leaving Stephen to sit
with a book in the hall near the telephone bell, in case Angela
should ring. And there, like the faithful creature she was, she
must sit on all through the night, patiently waiting. But when the
first tinges of dawn greyed the window and the panes of the
semicircular fanlight, she left her chair stiffly to pace up and
down, filled with a longing to be near this woman, if only to stand
and keep watch in her garden&mdash;Snatching up a coat she went out
to her car.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>She left the motor at the gates of The Grange, and walked up the
drive, taking cart to tread softly. The air had an indefinable
smell of dew and of very newly born morning. The tall, ornate Tudor
chimneys of the house stood out gauntly against a brightening sky,
and as Stephen crept into the small herb garden, one tentative bird
had already begun singing&mdash;but his voice was still rather
husky from sleep. She stood there and shivered in her heavy coat;
the long night of vigil had devitalized her. She was sometimes like
this now&mdash;she would shiver at the least provocation, the least
sign of fatigue, for her splendid physical strength was giving,
worn out by its own insistence.</p>

<p>She dragged the coat more closely around her, and stared at the
house which was reddening with sunrise. Her heart beat anxiously,
fearfully even, as though in some painful anticipation of she knew
not what&mdash;every window was dark except one or two that were
fired by the sunrise. How long she stood there she never knew, it
might have been moments, it might have been a life-time; and then
suddenly there was something that moved&mdash;the little oak door
that led into that garden. It moved cautiously, opening inch by
inch, until at last it was standing wide open, and Stephen saw a
man and a woman who turned to clasp as though neither of them could
endure to be parted from the arms of the other; and as they clung
there together and kissed, they swayed unsteadily&mdash;drunk with
loving.</p>

<p>Then, as sometimes happens in moments of great anguish, Stephen
could only remember the grotesque. She could only remember a
plump-bosomed housemaid in the arms of a coarsely amorous footman,
and she laughed and she laughed like a creature
demented&mdash;laughed and laughed until she must gasp for breath
and spit blood from, her tongue, which had somehow got bitten in
her efforts to stop her hysterical laughing; and some of the blood
remained on her chin, jerked there by that agonized laughter.</p>

<p>Pale as death, Roger Antrim stared out into the garden, and his
tiny moustache looked quite black&mdash;like an ink stain smeared
above his tremulous mouth by some careless schoolboy finger.</p>

<p>And now Angela's voice came to Stephen, but faintly. She was
saying something&mdash;what was she saying? It soundly absurdly as
though it were a prayer&mdash;' Christ!' Then
sharply&mdash;razor-sharp it sounded as it cut through the air:
'<i>You</i>, Stephen!'</p>

<p>The laughter died abruptly away, as Stephen turned and walked
out of the garden and down the short drive that led to the gates of
the Grange, where the motor was waiting. Her face was a mask, quite
without expression. She moved stiffly, yet with a curious
precision; and she swung up the handle and started the powerful
engine without any apparent effort.</p>

<p>She drove at great speed but with accurate judgment, for now her
mind felt as clear as spring water, and yet there were strange
little gaps in her mind&mdash;she had not the least idea where she
was going. Every road for miles around Upton was familiar, yet she
had not the least idea where she was going. Nor did she know how
long she drove, nor when she stopped to procure fresh petrol. The
sun rose high and hot in the heavens; it beat down on her without
warming her coldness, for always she had the sense of a dead thing
that lay close against her heart and oppressed it. A
corpse&mdash;she was carrying a corpse about with her. Was it the
corpse of her love for Angela? If so that love was more terrible
dead&mdash;oh, far more terrible dead than living.</p>

<p>The first stars were shining, but as yet very faintly, when she
found herself driving through the gates of Morton. Heard Puddle's
voice calling: 'Wait a minute. Stop. Stephen!' Saw Puddle barring
her way in the drive, a tiny yet dauntless figure.</p>

<p>She pulled up with a jerk: 'What's the matter What is it?'
'Where have you been?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;don't know, Puddle.'</p>

<p>But Puddle had clambered in beside her: 'Listen, Stephen,' and
now she was talking very fast, 'listen, Stephen&mdash;is
it&mdash;is it Angela Crossby It is. I can see the thing in your
face. My God, what's that woman done to you, Stephen?'</p>

<p>Then Stephen, in spite of the corpse against her heart, or
perhaps because of it, defended the woman: 'She's done nothing at
all&mdash;it was all my fault, but you wouldn't understand&mdash;I
got very angry and then I laughed and couldn't stop
laughing&mdash;' Steady, go steady! She was telling too much:
'No&mdash;it wasn't that exactly. Oh, you know my vile temper, it
always goes off at half cock for nothing. Well, then I just drove
round and round the country until I cooled down. I'm sorry, Puddle,
I ought to have rung up, of course you've been anxious.'</p>

<p>Puddle gripped her arm: 'Stephen, listen, it's your
mother&mdash;she thinks that you started quite early for Worcester,
I lied&mdash;I've been nearly distracted, child. If you hadn't come
soon, I'd have had to tell her that I didn't know where you were.
You must never, <i>never</i> go off without a word like this
again&mdash;But I do understand, oh, I do indeed, Stephen.'</p>

<p>But Stephen shook her head: 'No, my dear, you couldn't&mdash;and
I'd rather not tell you, Puddle.'</p>

<p>'Some day you must tell me,' said Puddle, 'because&mdash;well,
because I do understand, Stephen.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>That night the weight against Stephen's heart, with its icy
coldness, melted; and it flowed out in such a torrent of grief that
she could, not stand up against that torrent, so that drowning
though she was she found pen and paper, and she wrote to Angela
Crossby.</p>

<p>What a letter! All the pent-up passion of months, all the
terrible, rending, destructive frustrations must burst forth from
her heart: 'Love me, only love me the way I love you. Angela, for
God's sake, try to love me a little&mdash;don't throw me away,
because if you do I'm utterly finished. You know how I love you,
with my soul and my body; if it's wrong, grotesque,
unholy&mdash;have pity. I'll be humble. Oh, my darling, I am humble
now; I'm just a poor, heart-broken freak of a creature who loves
you and needs you much more than its life, because life's worse
than death, ten times worse without you. I'm some awful
mistake&mdash;God's mistake&mdash;I don't know if there are any
more like me, I pray not for their sakes, because it's pure hell.
But oh, my dear, whatever I am, I just love you and love you. I
thought it was dead, but it wasn't. It's alive&mdash;so terribly
alive tonight in my bedroom...' And so it went on for page after
page.</p>

<p>But never a word about Roger Antrim and what she had seen that
morning in the garden. Some fine instinct of utterly selfless
protection towards this woman had managed to survive all the
anguish and all the madness of that day. The letter was a terrible
indictment against Stephen, a complete vindication of Angela
Crossby.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Angela went to her husband's study, and she stood before him
utterly shaken, utterly appalled at what she would do, yet utterly
and ruthlessly determined to do it from a primitive instinct of
self-preservation. In her ears she could still hear that terrible
laughter&mdash;that uncanny, hysterical, agonized laughter. Stephen
was mad, and God only knew what she might do or say in a moment of
madness, and then&mdash;but she dared not look into the future.
Cringing in spirit and trembling in body, she forgot the girl's
faithful and loyal devotion, her will to forgive, her desire to
protect, so clearly set forth in that pitiful letter.</p>

<p>She said: 'Ralph, I want to ask your advice. I'm in an awful
mess&mdash;it's Stephen Gordon. You think I've been carrying on
with Roger&mdash;good Lord, if you only knew what I've endured
these past few months! I have seen a great deal of Roger, I
admit&mdash;quite innocently of course&mdash;still, all the same,
I've seen him&mdash;I thought it would show her that I'm
not&mdash;that I'm not&mdash;' For one moment her voice seemed
about to fail her, then she went on quite firmly: 'that I'm not a
pervert; that I'm not that sort of degenerate creature.'</p>

<p>He sprang up: 'What?' he bellowed.</p>

<p>'Yes, I know, it's too awful. I ought to have asked your advice
about it, but I really did like the girl just at first, and after
that, well&mdash;I set out to reform her. Oh, I know, I've been
crazy, worse than crazy if you like; it was hopeless right from the
very beginning. If I'd only known more about that sort of thing I'd
have come to you at once, but I'd never met it. She was our
neighbour, too, which made it more awkward, and not only
that&mdash;her position in the county&mdash;oh, Ralph, you
<i>must</i> help me, I'm completely bewildered. How on earth does
one answer this sort of thing? It's quite mad&mdash;I believe the
girl's half mad herself.'</p>

<p>And she handed him Stephen's letter.</p>

<p>He read it slowly, and as he did so his weak little eyes grew
literally scarlet&mdash;puffy and scarlet all over their lids, and
when he had finished reading that letter he turned and spat on the
ground. Then Ralph's language became a thing to forget; every
filthy invective learnt in the slums of his youth and later on in
the workshops, he hurled against Stephen and all her kind. He
called down the wrath of the Lord upon them. He deplored the
non-existence of the stake, and racked his brains for indecent
tortures. And finally: 'I'll answer this letter, yes, by God I
will! You leave her to me, I know how I'm going to answer this
letter!'</p>

<p>Angela asked him, and now her voice shook: 'Ralph, what will you
do to her&mdash;to Stephen?'</p>

<p>He laughed loudly: 'I'll hound her out of the county before I've
done&mdash;and with luck out of England; the same as I'd hound you
out if I thought that there'd ever been anything between you two
women. It's damned lucky for you that she wrote this letter, damned
lucky, otherwise I might have my suspicions. You've got off this
time, but don't try your reforming again&mdash;you're not cut out
to be a reformer. If there's any of that Lamb of God stuff wanted
I'll see to it myself and don't you forget it!' He slipped the
letter into his pocket, 'I'll sec to it myself next time&mdash;with
an axe!'</p>

<p>Angela turned and went out of the study with bowed head. She was
saved through this great betrayal, yet most strangely bitter she
found her salvation, and most shameful the price she paid for her
safety. So, greatly daring, she went to her desk and with trembling
fingers took a sheet of paper. Then she wrote in her large, rather
childish handwriting: 'Stephen&mdash;when you know what I've done,
forgive me.'</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter Twenty-seven</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Two days later Anna Gordon sent for her daughter. Stephen found
her sitting quite still in that vast drawing-room of hers, which as
always smelt faintly of orris-root, beeswax and violets. Her thin,
white hands were folded in her lap, closely folded over a couple of
letters; and it seemed to Stephen that all of a sudden she saw in
her mother a very old woman&mdash;a very old woman with terrible
eyes, pitiless, hard and deeply accusing, so that she could but
shrink from their gaze, since they were the eyes of her mother.</p>

<p>Anna said: 'Lock the door, then come and stand here.'</p>

<p>In absolute silence Stephen obeyed her. Thus it was that those
two confronted each other, flesh of flesh, blood of blood, they
confronted each other across the wide gulf set between them.</p>

<p>Then Anna handed her daughter a letter: 'Read this,' she said
briefly. And Stephen read:</p>

<blockquote>DEAR LADY ANNA,<br>
<br>
With deep repugnance I take up my pen, for certain things won't
bear thinking about, much less being written. But I feel that I owe
you some explanation of my reasons for having come to the decision
that I cannot permit your daughter to enter my house again, or my
wife to visit Morton. I enclose a copy of your daughter's letter to
my wife, which I feel is sufficiently dear to make it unnecessary
for me to write further, except to add that my wife is returning
the two costly presents given her by Miss Gordon.<br>
<br>
I remain, Yours very truly,<br>
RALPH CROSSBY.</blockquote>

<p>Stephen stood as though turned to stone for a moment, not so
much as a muscle twitched; then she handed the letter back to her
mother without speaking, and in silence Anna received it.
'Stephen&mdash;when you know what I've done, forgive me.' The
childish scrawl seemed suddenly on fire, it seemed to scorch
Stephen's fingers as she touched it in her pocket&mdash;so this was
what Angela had done. In a blinding flash the girl saw it all; the
miserable weakness, the fear of betrayal, the terror of Ralph and
of what he would do should he learn of that guilty night with
Roger. Oh, but Angela might have spared her this, this last wound
to her loyal and faithful devotion; this last insult to all that
was best and most sacred in her love&mdash;Angela had feared
betrayal at the hands of the creature who loved her!</p>

<p>But now her mother was speaking again: 'And this&mdash;read this
and tell me if you wrote it, or if that man's lying.' And Stephen
must read her own misery jibing at her from those pages in Ralph
Crossby's stiff and clerical handwriting.</p>

<p>She looked up: 'Yes, Mother, I wrote it.'</p>

<p>Then Anna began to speak very slowly as though nothing of what
she would say must be lost; and that slow, quiet voice was more
dreadful than anger: All your life I've felt very strangely towards
you', she was saying, 'I've felt a kind of physical repulsion, a
desire not to touch or to be touched by you&mdash;a terrible thing
for a mother to feel&mdash;it has often made me deeply unhappy.
I've often felt that I was being unjust, unnatural&mdash;but now I
know that my instinct was right; it is you who are unnatural, not
I...'</p>

<p>'Mother&mdash;stop!'</p>

<p>'It is you who are unnatural, not I. And this thing that you are
is a sin against creation. Above all is this thing a sin against
the father who bred you, the father whom you dare to resemble. You
dare to look like your father, and your face is a living insult to
his memory, Stephen. I shall never be able to look at you now
without thinking of the deadly insult of your face and your body to
the memory of the father who bred you. I can only thank God that
your father died before he was asked to endure this great shame. As
for you, I would rather see you dead at my feet than standing
before me with this thing upon you&mdash;this unspeakable outrage
that you call love in that letter which you don't deny having
written. In that letter you say things that may only be said
between man and woman, and coming from you they are vile and filthy
words of corruption&mdash;against nature, against God who created
nature. My gorge rises; you have made me feel physically
sick&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mother&mdash;you don't know what you're saying&mdash;you're my
mother&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am your mother, but for all that, you seem to me like a
scourge. I ask myself what I have ever done to be dragged down into
the depths by my daughter. And your father&mdash;what had he ever
done? And you have presumed to use the word love in connection with
this&mdash;with these lusts of your body; these unnatural cravings
of your unbalanced mind and undisciplined body&mdash;you have used
that word. I have loved&mdash;do you heart I have loved your
father, and your father loved me. That was <i>love</i>.'</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Stephen knew that unless she could, indeed, drop
dead at the feet of this woman in whose womb she had quickened,
there was one thing that she dared not let pass unchallenged, and
that was this terrible slur upon her love. And all that was in her
rose up to refute it; to protect her love from such unbearable
soiling. It was part of herself, and unless she could save it, she
could not save herself any more. She must stand or fall by the
courage of that love to proclaim its right to toleration.</p>

<p>She held up her hand, commanding silence; commanding that slow,
quiet voice to cease speaking, and she said: 'As my father loved
you, I loved. As a man loves a woman, that was how I
loved&mdash;protectively, like my father. I wanted to give all I
had in me to give. It made me feel terribly strong...and gentle. It
was good, good, <i>good</i>&mdash;I'd have laid down my life a
thousand times over for Angela Crossby. If I could have I'd have
married her and brought her home&mdash;I wanted to bring her home
here to Morton. If I loved her the way a man loves a woman, it's
because I can't feel that I am a woman. All my life I've never felt
like a woman, and you know it&mdash;you say you've always disliked
me, that you've always felt a strange physical repulsion...I don't
know what I am; no one's ever told me that I'm different and yet I
know that I'm different&mdash;that's why, I suppose, you've felt as
you have done. And for that I forgive you, though whatever it is,
it was you and my father who made this body&mdash;but what I will
never forgive is your daring to try to make me ashamed of my love.
I'm not ashamed of it, there's no shame in me.' And now she was
stammering a little wildly, 'Good and&mdash;and fine it was,' she
stammered, 'the best part of myself&mdash;I gave all and I asked
nothing in return&mdash;I just went on hopelessly loving&mdash;'
she broke off, she was shaking from head to foot, and Anna's cold
voice fell like icy water on that angry and sorely tormented
spirit.</p>

<p>'You have spoken, Stephen. I don't think there's much more that
needs to be said between us except this, we two cannot live
together at Morton&mdash;not now, because I might grow to hate you.
Yes, although you are my child I might grow to hate you. The same
roof mustn't shelter us both any more; one of us must
go&mdash;which of us shall it bet' And she looked at Stephen and
waited.</p>

<p>Morton! They could not both live at Morton. Something seemed to
catch hold of the girl's heart and twist it. She stared at her
mother, aghast for a moment, while Anna stared back&mdash;she was
waiting for her answer.</p>

<p>But quite suddenly Stephen found her manhood and she said: 'I
understand. I'll leave Morton.'</p>

<p>Then Anna made her daughter sit down beside her, while she
talked of how this thing might be accomplished in a way that would
cause the least possible scandal: 'For the sake of your father's
honourable name, I must ask you to help me, Stephen.' It was
better, she said, that Stephen should take Puddle with her, if
Puddle would consent to go. They might live in London or somewhere
abroad, on the pretext that Stephen wished to study. From time to
time Stephen would come back to Morton and visit her mother, and
during those visits they two would take care to be seen together
for appearances' sake, for the sake of her father. She could take
from Morton whatever she needed, the horses, and anything else she
wished. Certain of the rent-roll would be paid over to her, should
her own income prove insufficient. All things must be done in a way
that was seemly&mdash;no undue haste, no suspicion of a breach
between mother and daughter: 'For the sake of your father I ask
this of you, not for your sake or mine, but for his. Do you consent
to this, Stephen?'</p>

<p>And Stephen answered: 'Yes, I consent.'</p>

<p>Then Anna said: 'I'd like you to leave me now&mdash;I feel tired
and I want to be alone for a little&mdash;but presently I shall
send for Puddle to discuss her living with you in the future.'</p>

<p>So Stephen got up, and she went away, leaving Anna Gordon
alone.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>As though drawn there by some strong natal instinct, Stephen
went straight to her father's study; and she sat in the old
arm-chair that had survived him; then she buried her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>All the loneliness that had gone before was as nothing to this
new loneliness of spirit. An immense desolation swept down upon
her, an immense need to cry out and claim understanding for
herself, an immense need to find an answer to the riddle of her
unwanted being. All around her were grey and crumbling ruins, and
under those ruins her love lay bleeding; shamefully wounded by
Angela Crossby, shamefully soiled and defiled by her mother&mdash;a
piteous, suffering, defenceless thing, it lay bleeding under the
ruins.</p>

<p>She felt blind when she tried to look into the future, stupefied
when she tried to look back on the past. She must go&mdash;she was
going away from Morton: 'From Morton&mdash;I'm going away from
Morton,' the words thudded drearily in her brain: 'I'm going away
from Morton.'</p>

<p>The grave, comely house would not know her any more, nor the
garden where she had heard the cuckoo with the dawning
understanding of a child, nor the lakes where she had kissed Angela
Crossby for the first time&mdash;full on the lips as a lover. The
good, sweet-smelling meadows with their placid cattle, she was
going to leave them; and the hills that protected poor, unhappy
lovers&mdash;the merciful hills; and the lanes with their sleepy
dog-roses at evening; and the little, old township of
Upton-on-Severn with its battle-scarred church and its yellowish
river; that was where she had first seen Angela Crossby...</p>

<p>The spring would come sweeping across Castle Morton, bringing
strong, clean winds to the open common. The spring would come
sweeping across the whole valley, from the Cotswold Hills right up
to the Malverns; bringing daffodils by their hundreds and
thousands, bringing bluebells to the beech wood down by the lakes,
bringing cygnets for Peter the swan to protect; bringing sunshine
to warm the old bricks of the house&mdash;but she would not be
there any more in the spring. In summer the roses would not be her
roses, nor the luminous carpet of leaves in the autumn, nor the
beautiful winter forms of the beech trees: 'And on evenings in
winter these lakes are quite frozen, and the ice looks like slabs
of gold in the sunset, when, you and I come and stand here in the
winter...' No, no, not that memory, it was too much&mdash;'when you
and I come and stand here in the winter...</p>

<p>Getting up, she wandered about the room, touching its kind and
familiar objects; stroking the desk, examining a pen, grown rusty
from long disuse as it lay there; then she opened a little drawer
in the desk and took out the key of her father's locked book-case.
Her mother had told her to take what she pleased&mdash;she would
take one or two of her father's books. She had never examined this
special book-case, and she could not have told why she suddenly did
so. As she slipped the key into the lock and turned it, the action
seemed curiously automatic. She began to take out the volumes
slowly and with listless fingers, scarcely glancing at their
titles. It gave her something to do, that was all&mdash;she thought
that she was trying to distract her attention. Then she noticed
that on a shelf near the bottom was a row of books standing behind
the others; the next moment she had one of these in her hand, and
was looking at the name of the author: Krafft Ebing&mdash;she had
never heard of that author before. All the same she opened the
battered old book, then she looked more closely, for there on its
margins were notes in her father's small, scholarly hand and she
saw that her own name appeared in those notes&mdash;She began to
read, sitting down rather abruptly. For a long time she read; then
went back to the book-case and got out another of those volumes,
and another...The sun was now setting behind the hills; the garden
was growing dusky with shadows. In the study there was little light
left to read by, so that she must take her book to the window and
must bend her face closer over the page; but still she read on and
on in the dusk.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she had got to her feet and was talking
aloud&mdash;she was talking to her father: 'You knew! All the time
you knew this thing, but because of your pity you wouldn't tell me.
Oh, Father&mdash;and there are so many of us&mdash;thousands of
miserable, unwanted people, who have no right to love, no right to
compassion because they're maimed, hideously maimed and
ugly&mdash;God's cruel; He let us get flawed in the making.'</p>

<p>And then, before she knew what she was doing, she had found her
father's old, well-worn Bible. There she stood demanding a sign
from heaven&mdash;nothing less than a sign from heaven she
demanded. The Bible fell open near the beginning. She read: 'And
the Lord set a mark upon Cain...</p>

<p>Then Stephen hurled the Bible away, and she sank down completely
hopeless and beaten, rocking her body backwards and forwards with a
kind of abrupt yet methodical rhythm: 'And the Lord set a mark upon
Cain, upon Cain...' she was rocking now in rhythm to those words,
'And the Lord set a mark upon Cain&mdash;upon Cain&mdash;upon Cain.
And the Lord set a mark upon Cain...'</p>

<p>That was how Puddle came in and found her, and Puddle said:
'Where you go, I go, Stephen. All that you're suffering at this
moment I've suffered. It was when I was very young like
you&mdash;but I still remember.'</p>

<p>Stephen looked up with bewildered eyes: 'Would you go with Cain
whom God marked?' she said slowly, for she had not understood
Puddle's meaning, so she asked her once more: 'Would you go with
Caine?'</p>

<p>Puddle put an arm round Stephen's bowed shoulders, and she said:
'You've got work to do&mdash;come and do it! Why, just because you
are what you are, you may actually find that you've got an
advantage. You may write with a curious double insight&mdash;write
both men and women from a personal knowledge. Nothing's completely
misplaced or wasted, I'm sure of that&mdash;and we're all part of
nature. Some day the world will recognize this, but meanwhile
there's plenty of work that's waiting. For the sake of all the
others who are like you, but less strong and less gifted perhaps,
many of them, it's up to you to have the courage to make good, and
I'm here to help you to do it, Stephen.'</p>

<h2>BOOK THREE</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter Twenty-eight</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>A pale glint of sunshine devoid of all warmth lay over the wide
expanse of the river, touching the funnel of a passing tug that
tore at the water like a clumsy harrow; but a field of water is not
for the sowing and the river closed back in the wake of the tug,
deftly obliterating all traces of its noisy and foolish passing.
The trees along the Chelsea Embankment bent and creaked in a sharp
March wind. The wind was urging the sap in their branches to flow
with a more determined purpose, but the skin of their bodies was
blackened and soot-clogged so that when touched it left soot on the
fingers, and knowing this they were always disheartened and
therefore a little slow to respond to the urge of the
wind&mdash;they were city trees which are always somewhat
disheartened. Away to the right against a toneless sky stood the
tall factory chimneys beloved of young artists&mdash;especially
those whose skill is not great, for few can go wrong over factory
chimneys&mdash;while across the stream Battersea Park still looked
misty as though barely convalescent from fog.</p>

<p>In her large, long, rather low-ceilinged study whose casement
windows looked over the river, sat Stephen with her feet stretched
out to the fire and her hands thrust in her jacket pockets. Her
eyelids drooped, she was all but asleep although it was early
afternoon. She had worked through the night, a deplorable habit and
one of which Puddle quite rightly disapproved, but when the spirit
of work was on her it was useless to argue with Stephen.</p>

<p>Puddle looked up from her embroidery frame and pushed her
spectacles on to her forehead the better to see the drowsy Stephen,
for Puddle's eyes had grown very long-sighted so that the room
looked blurred through her glasses.</p>

<p>She thought: 'Yes, she's changed a good deal in these two
years&mdash;' then she sighed half in sadness and half in
contentment. 'All the same she is making good,' thought Puddle,
remembering with a quick thrill of pride that the long-limbed
creature who lounged by the fire had suddenly sprung into something
like fame thanks to a fine first novel.</p>

<p>Stephen yawned, and readjusting her spectacles Puddle resumed
her wool-work.</p>

<p>It was true that the two long years of exile had left their
traces on Stephen's face; it had grown much thinner and more
determined, some might have said that the face had hardened, for
the mouth was less ardent and much less gentle, and the lips now
drooped at the corners. The strong rather massive line of the jaw
looked aggressive these days by reason of its thinness. Faint
furrows had come between the thick brows and faint shadows showed
at times under the eyes; the eyes themselves were the eyes of a
writer, always a little tired in expression. Her complexion was
paler than it had been in the past, it had lost the look of wind
and sunshine&mdash;the open-air look&mdash;and the fingers of the
hand that slowly emerged from her jacket pocket were heavily
stained with nicotine&mdash;she was now a voracious smoker. Her
hair was quite short. In a mood of defiance she had suddenly walked
off to the barber's one morning and had made him crop it dose like
a man's. And mightily did the fashion become her, for now the fine
shape of her head was unmarred by the stiff clumpy plait in the
nape of her neck. Released from the torment imposed upon it the
thick auburn hair could breathe and wave freely, and Stephen had
grown fond and proud of her hair&mdash;a hundred strokes must it
have with the brush every night until it looked burnished. Sir
Philip also had been proud of his hair in the days of his youthful
manhood.</p>

<p>Stephen's life in London had been one long endeavour, for work
to her had become a narcotic. Puddle it was who had found the flat
with the casement windows that looked on the river, and Puddle it
was who now kept the accounts, paid the rent, settled bills and
managed the servants; all these details Stephen calmly ignored and
the faithful Puddle allowed her to do so. Like an ageing and
anxious Vestal Virgin she tended the holy fire of inspiration,
feeding the flame with suitable food&mdash;good grilled meat, light
puddings and much fresh fruit, varied by little painstaking
surprises from Jackson's or Fortnum &amp; Mason. For Stephen's
appetite was not what it had been in the vigorous days of Morton;
now there were times when she could not eat, or if she must eat she
did so protesting, fidgeting to go back to her desk. At such times
Puddle would steal into the study with a tin of Brand's
Essence&mdash;she had even been known to feed the recalcitrant
author piecemeal, until Stephen must laugh and gobble up the jelly
for the sake of getting on with her writing.</p>

<p>Only one duty apart from her work had Stephen never for a moment
neglected, and that was the care and the welfare of Raftery. The
cob had been sold, and her father's chestnut she had given away to
Colonel Antrim, who had sworn not to let the horse out of his hands
for the sake of his life-long friend, Sir Philip&mdash;but Raftery
she had brought up to London. She herself had found and rented his
stable with comfortable rooms above for Jim, the groom she had
taken from Morton. Every morning she rode very early in the Park,
which seemed a futile and dreary business, but now only thus could
the horse and his owner contrive to be together for a little.
Sometimes she fancied that Raftery sighed as she cantered him round
and round the Row, and then she would stoop down and speak to him
softly:</p>

<p>'My Raftery, I know, it's not Castle Morton or the hills or the
big, green Severn Valley&mdash;but I love you.'</p>

<p>And because he had understood her he would throw up his head and
begin to prance sideways, pretending that he still felt very
youthful, pretending that he was wild with delight at the prospect
of cantering round the Row. But after a while these two sorry
exiles would droop and move forward without much spirit. Each in a
separate way would divine the ache in the other, the ache that was
Morton, so that Stephen would cease to urge the beast forward, and
Raftery would cease to pretend to Stephen. But when twice a year at
her mother's request, Stephen must go back to visit her home, then
Raftery went too, and his joy was immense when he felt the good
springy turf beneath him, when he sighted the red brick stables of
Morton, when he rolled in the straw of his large, airy loose box.
The years would seem to slip from his shoulders, he grew sleeker,
he would look like a five-year-old&mdash;yet to Stephen these
visits of theirs were anguish because of her love for Morton. She
would feel like a stranger within the gates, an unwanted stranger
there only on sufferance. It would seem to her that the old house
withdrew itself from her love very gravely and sadly, that its
windows no longer beckoned, invited: 'Come home, come home, come
inside quickly, Stephen!' And she would not dare to proffer her
love, which would burden her heart to breaking.</p>

<p>She must now pay many calls with her mother, must attend all the
formal social functions&mdash;this for the sake of appearances,
lest the neighbours should guess the breach between them. She must
keep up the fiction that she found in a city the stimulus necessary
to her work, she who was filled with a hungry longing for the green
of the hills, for the air of wide spaces, for the mornings and the
noontides and the evenings of Morton. All these things she must do
for the sake of her father, aye, and for the sake of Morton.</p>

<p>On her first visit home Anna had said very quietly one day:
'There's something, Stephen, that I think I ought to tell you
perhaps, though it's painful to me to reopen the subject. There has
been no scandal&mdash;that man held his tongue&mdash;you'll be glad
to know this because of your father. And Stephen&mdash;the Crossbys
have sold The Grange and gone to America, I believe&mdash;' she had
stopped abruptly, not looking at Stephen, who had nodded, unable to
answer.</p>

<p>So now there were quite different folk at The Grange, folk very
much more to the taste of the county&mdash;Admiral Carson and his
apple-checked wife who, childless herself, adored Mothers'
Meetings. Stephen must sometimes go to The Grange with Anna, who
liked the Carsons. Very grave and aloof had Stephen become; too
reserved, too self-assured, thought her neighbours. They supposed
that success had gone to her head, for no one was now allowed to
divine the terrible shyness that made social intercourse such a
miserable torment. Life had already taught Stephen one thing, and
that was that never must human beings be allowed to suspect that a
creature fears them. The fear of the one is a spur to the many, for
the primitive hunting instinct dies hard&mdash;it is better to face
a hostile world than to turn one's back for a moment.</p>

<p>But at least she was spared meeting Roger Antrim, and for this
she was most profoundly thankful. Roger had gone with his regiment
to Malta, so that they two did not see each other. Violet was
married and living in London in the 'perfect duck of a house in
Belgravia'. From time to time she would blow in on Stephen, but not
often, because she was very much married with one baby already and
another on the way. She was somewhat subdued and much less maternal
than she had been when first she met Alec.</p>

<p>If Anna was proud of her daughter's achievement she said nothing
beyond the very few words that must of necessity be spoken: 'I'm so
glad your book has succeeded, Stephen.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, mother&mdash;'</p>

<p>Then as always these two fell silent. Those long and eloquent
silences of theirs were now of almost daily occurrence when they
found themselves together. Nor could they look each other in the
eyes any more, their eyes were for ever shifting, and sometimes
Anna's pale cheeks would flush very slightly when she was alone
with Stephen&mdash;perhaps at her thoughts.</p>

<p>And Stephen would think: 'It's because she can't help
remembering.'</p>

<p>For the most part, however, they shunned all contact by common
consent, except when in public. And this studied avoidance tore at
their nerves; they were now wellnigh obsessed by each other, for
ever secretly laying their plans in order to avoid a meeting. Thus
it was that these obligatory visits to Morton were a pretty bad
strain on Stephen. She would go back to London unable to sleep,
unable to eat, unable to write, and with such a despairing and
sickening heartache for the grave old house the moment she had left
it, that Puddle would have to be very severe in order to pull her
together.</p>

<p>'I'm ashamed of you, Stephen; what's happened to your courage?
You don't deserve your phenomenal success; if you go on like this,
God help the new book. I suppose you're going to be a one-book
author!'</p>

<p>Scowling darkly, Stephen would go to her desk&mdash;she had no
wish to be a one-book author.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Yet as everything comes as grist to the mill of those who arc
destined from birth to be writers&mdash;poverty or riches, good or
evil, gladness or sorrow, all grist to the mill&mdash;so the pain
of Morton burning down to the spirit in Stephen had kindled a
bright, hot flame, and all that she had written she had written by
its light, seeing exceedingly clearly. As though in a kind of
self-preservation, her mind had turned to quite simple people,
humble people sprung from the soil, from the same kind soil that
had nurtured Morton. None of her own strange emotions had touched
them, and yet they were part of her own emotions; a part of her
longing for simplicity and peace, a part of her curious craving for
the normal. And although at this time Stephen did not know it,
their happiness sprung from her moments of joy; their sorrows from
the sorrow she had known and still knew; their frustrations from
her own bitter emptiness; their fulfilments from her longing to be
fulfilled. These people had drawn life and strength from their
creator. Like infants they had sucked at her breasts of
inspiration, and drawn from them blood, waxing wonderfully strong;
demanding, compelling thereby recognition. For surely thus only are
fine books written, they must somehow partake of the miracle of
blood&mdash;the strange and terrible miracle of blood, the giver of
life, the purifier, the great final expiation.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>But one thing there was that Puddle still feared, and this was
the girl's desire for isolation. To her it appeared like a weakness
in Stephen; she divined the bruised humility of spirit that now
underlay this desire for isolation, and she did her best to
frustrate it. It was Puddle who had forced the embarrassed Stephen
to let in the Press photographers, and Puddle it was who had given
the details for the captions that were to appear with the pictures:
'If you choose to behave like a hermit crab I shall use my own
judgment about what I say!'</p>

<p>'I don't care a tinker's darn what you say! Now leave me in
peace do, Puddle.'</p>

<p>It was Puddle who answered the telephone calls: 'I'm afraid Miss
Gordon will be busy working&mdash;what name did you say? Oh, <i>The
Literary Monthly</i>! I see&mdash;well suppose you come on
Wednesday.' And on Wednesday there was old Puddle waiting to waylay
the anxious young man who had been commanded to dig up some copy
about the new novelist, Stephen Gordon. Then Puddle had smiled at
the anxious young man and had shepherded him into her own little
sanctum, and had given him a comfortable chair, and had stirred the
fire the better to warm him. And the young man had noticed her
charming smile and had thought how kind was this ageing woman, and
how damned hard it was to go tramping the streets in quest of
erratic, unsociable authors.</p>

<p>Puddle had said, still smiling kindly: 'I'd hate you to go back
without your copy, but Miss Gordon's been working overtime lately,
I dare not disturb her, you don't mind, do you? Now if you could
possibly make shift with me&mdash;I really do know a great deal
about her; as a matter of fact I'm her ex-governess, so I really do
know quite a lot about her.'</p>

<p>Out had come notebook and copying pencil; it was easy to talk to
this sympathetic woman: 'Well, if you could give me some
interesting details&mdash;say, her taste in books and her
recreations, I'd be awfully grateful. She hunts, I believe?'</p>

<p>'Oh, not now!'</p>

<p>'I see&mdash;well then, she <i>did</i> hunt. And wasn't her
father Sir Philip Gordon who had a place down in Worcestershire and
was killed by a falling tree or something? What kind of a pupil did
you find Miss Gordon? I'll send her my notes when I've worked them
up, but I really would like to see her, you know.' Then being a
fairly sagacious young man: 'I've just read <i>The Furrow</i>, it's
a wonderful book!'</p>

<p>Puddle talked glibly while the young man scribbled, and when at
last he was just about going she let him out on to the balcony from
which he could look in Stephen's study.</p>

<p>'There she is at her desk! What more could you ask?' she said
triumphantly, pointing to Stephen whose hair was literally standing
on end, as is sometimes the way with youthful authors. She even
managed occasionally to make Stephen see the journalists
herself:</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen got up, stretched, and went to the window. The sun had
retreated behind the clouds; a kind of brown twilight hung over the
Embankment, for the wind had now dropped and a fog was threatening.
The discouragement common to all fine writers was upon her, she was
hating what she had written. Last night's work seemed inadequate
and unworthy; she decided to put a blue pencil through it and to
rewrite the chapter from start to finish. She began to give way to
a species of panic; her new book would be a ludicrous failure, she
felt it, she would never again write a novel possessing the quality
of <i>The Furrow</i>. <i>The Furrow</i> had been the result of
shock to which she had, strangely enough, reacted by a kind of
unnatural mental vigour. But now she could not react any more, her
brain felt like over-stretched elastic, it would not spring back,
it was limp, unresponsive. And then there was something else that
distracted, something she was longing to put into words yet that
shamed her so that it held her tongue-tied. She lit a cigarette and
when it was finished found another and kindled it at the stump.</p>

<p>'Stop embroidering that curtain, for God's sake, Puddle. I
simply can't stand the sound of your needle; it makes a booming
noise like a drum every time you prod that tightly stretched
linen.'</p>

<p>Puddle looked up: 'You're smoking too much.'</p>

<p>'I dare say I am. I can't write any more.'</p>

<p>'Since when?'</p>

<p>'Ever since I began this new book.'</p>

<p>'Don't be such a fool!'</p>

<p>'But it's God's truth, I tell you&mdash;I feel flat, it's a kind
of spiritual dryness. This new book is going to be a failure,
sometimes I think I'd better destroy it.' She began to pace up and
down the room, dull-eyed yet tense as a tightly-drawn bow
string.</p>

<p>'This comes of working all night,' Puddle murmured.</p>

<p>'I must work when the spirit moves me,' snapped Stephen.</p>

<p>Puddle put aside her wool work embroidery. She was not much
moved by this sudden depression, she had grown quite accustomed to
these literary moods, yet she looked a little more closely at
Stephen and something that she saw in her face disturbed her.</p>

<p>'You look tired to death; why not lie down and rest?'</p>

<p>'Rot! I want to work.'</p>

<p>'You're not fit to work. You look all on edge, somehow. What's
the matter with you?' And then very gently: Stephen, come here and
sit down by me, please, I must know what's the matter.'</p>

<p>Stephen obeyed as though once again they two were back in the
old Morton schoolroom, then she suddenly buried her face in her
hands: 'I don't want to tell you&mdash;why must I, Puddle?'</p>

<p>'Because,' said Puddle, 'I've a right to know; your career's
very dear to me, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Then suddenly Stephen could not resist the blessed relief of
confiding in Puddle once more, of taking this great new trouble to
the faithful and wise little grey-haired woman whose hand had been
stretched out to save in the past. Perhaps yet again that hand
might find the strength that was needful to save her.</p>

<p>Not looking at Puddle, she began to talk quickly: 'There's
something I've been wanting to tell you, Puddle&mdash;it's about my
work, there's something wrong with it. I mean that my work could be
much more vital; I feel it, I know it, I'm holding it back in some
way, there's something I'm always missing. Even in <i>The
Furrow</i> I feel I missed something&mdash;I know it was fine, but
it wasn't complete because I'm not complete and I never shall
be&mdash;can't you understand? I'm not complete...' She paused,
unable to find the words she wanted, then blundered on again
blindly: 'There's a great chunk of life that I've never known, and
I want to know it, I ought to know it if I'm to become a really
fine writer. There's the greatest thing perhaps in the world, and
I've missed it&mdash;that's what's so awful, Puddle, to know that
it exists everywhere, all round me, to be constantly near it yet
always held back&mdash;to feel that the poorest people in the
streets, the most ignorant people, know more than I do. And I dare
to take up my pen and write, knowing less than these poor men and
women in the street! Why haven't I got a right to it, Puddle? Can't
you understand that I'm strong and young, so that sometimes this
thing that I'm missing torments me, so that I can't concentrate on
my work any more? Puddle, help me&mdash;you were young yourself
once.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Stephen&mdash;a long time ago I was young...</p>

<p>'But can't you remember back for my sake?' And now her voice
sounded almost angry in her distress: 'It's unfair, it's unjust.
Why should I live in this great isolation of spirit and
body&mdash;why should I, why? Why have I been afflicted with a body
that must never be indulged, that must always be repressed until it
grows much stronger than my spirit because of this unnatural
repression? What have I done to be so cursed? And now it's
attacking my holy of holies, my work&mdash;I shall never be a great
writer because of my maimed and insufferable body&mdash;' She fell
silent, suddenly shy and ashamed, too much ashamed to go on
speaking.</p>

<p>And there sat Puddle as pale as death and as speechless, having
no comfort to offer&mdash;no comfort, that is, that she dared to
offer&mdash;while all her fine theories about making good for the
sake of those others; being noble, courageous, patient, honourable,
physically pure, enduring because it was right to endure, the
terrible birthright of the invert&mdash;all Puddle's fine theories
lay strewn around her like the ruins of some false and flimsy
temple, and she saw at that moment but one thing clearly&mdash;true
genius in chains, in the chains of the flesh, a fine spirit subject
to physical bondage. And as once before she had argued with God on
behalf of this sorely afflicted creature, so now she inwardly cried
yet again to the Maker whose will had created Stephen: 'Thine hands
have made me and fashioned me together and round about; yet Thou
dost destroy me.' Then into her heart crept a bitterness very hard
to endure: 'Yet Thou dost destroy me&mdash;'</p>

<p>Stephen looked up and saw her face: 'Never mind,' she said
sharply, 'it's all right, Puddle&mdash;forget it!'</p>

<p>But Puddle's eyes filled with tears, and seeing this, Stephen
went to her desk. Sitting down she groped for her manuscript: 'I'm
going to turn you out now, I must work. Don't wait for me if I'm
late for dinner.'</p>

<p>Very humbly Puddle crept out of the study.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter Twenty-nine</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Soon after the New Year, nine months later, Stephen's second
novel was published. It failed to create the sensation that the
first had created, there was something disappointing about it. One
critic described this as: 'A lack of grip,' and his criticism, on
the whole, was a fair one. However, the Press was disposed to be
kind, remembering the merits of <i>The Furrow</i>.</p>

<p>But the heart of the Author knoweth its own sorrows and is
seldom responsive to false consolation, so that when Puddle said:
'Never mind, Stephen, you can't expect every book to be <i>The
Furrow</i>&mdash;and this one is full of literary merit.' Stephen
replied as she turned away: I was writing a novel, my dear, not an
essay.'</p>

<p>After this they did not discuss it any more, for what was the
use of fruitless discussion? Stephen knew well and Puddle knew also
that this book fell far short of its author's powers. Then
suddenly, that spring, Raftery went very lame, and everything else
was forgotten.</p>

<p>Raftery was aged, he was now eighteen, so that lameness in him
was not easy of healing. His life in a city had tried him sorely,
he had missed the light, airy stables of Morton, and the cruel-hard
bed that lay under the tan of the Row had jarred his legs
badly.</p>

<p>The vet shook his head and looked very grave: 'He's an aged
horse, you know, and of course in his youth you hunted him pretty
freely&mdash;it all counts. Everyone comes to the end of their
tether, Miss Gordon. Yes, at times I'm afraid it is painful.' Then,
seeing Stephen's face: 'I'm awfully sorry not to give a more
cheerful diagnosis.'</p>

<p>Other experts arrived. Every good vet in London was consulted,
including Professor Hobday. No cure, no cure, it was always the
same, and at times, they told Stephen, the old horse suffered; but
this she well knew&mdash;she had seen the sweat break out darkly on
Raftery's shoulders.</p>

<p>So one morning she went into Raftery's loosebox, and she sent
the groom Jim out of the stable, and she laid her check against the
beast's neck, while he turned his head and began to nuzzle. Then
they looked at each other very quietly and gravely, and in
Raftery's eyes was a strange, new expression&mdash;a kind of
half-anxious, protesting wonder at this thing men call pain: 'What
is it, Stephen?'</p>

<p>She answered, forcing back her hot tears: 'Perhaps, for you, the
beginning, Raftery...'</p>

<p>After a while she went to his manger and let the fodder slip
through her fingers; but he would not eat, not even to please her,
so she called the groom back and ordered some gruel. Very gently
she readjusted the clothing that had slipped to one side, first the
under-blanket, then the smart blue rug that was braided in
red&mdash;red and blue, the old stable colours of Morton.</p>

<p>The groom Jim, now a thick-set stalwart young man, stared at her
with sorrowful understanding, but he did not speak; he was almost
as dumb as the beasts whom his life had been passed in
tending&mdash;even dumber, perhaps, for his language consisted of
words, having no small sounds and small movements such as Raftery
used when he spoke with Stephen, and which meant so much more than
words.</p>

<p>She said: 'I'm going now to the station to order a horse-box for
to-morrow, I'll let you know the time we start, later. And wrap him
up well; put on plenty of clothing for the journey, please, he
mustn't feel cold.'</p>

<p>The man nodded. She had not told him their destination, but he
knew it already; it was Morton. Then the great clumsy fellow must
pretend to be busy with a truss of fresh straw for the horse's
bedding, because his face had turned a deep crimson, because his
coarse lips were actually trembling&mdash;and this was not really
so very strange, for those who served Raftery loved him.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Raftery stepped quietly into his horse-box and Jim with great
deftness secured the halter, then he touched his cap and hurried
away to his third-class compartment, for Stephen herself would
travel with Raftery on his last journey back to the fields of
Morton. Sitting down on the seat reserved for a groom she opened
the little wooden window into the box, whereupon Raftery's muzzle
came up and his face looked out of the window. She fondled the
soft, grey plush of his muzzle. Presently she took a carrot from
her pocket, but the carrot was rather hard now for his teeth, so
she bit off small pieces and these she gave him in the palm of her
hand; then she watched him eat them uncomfortably, slowly, because
he was old, and this seemed so strange, for old age and Raftery
went very ill together.</p>

<p>Her mind slipped back and back over the years until it
recaptured the coming of Raftery&mdash;grey-coated and slender, and
his eyes as soft as an Irish morning, and his courage as bright as
an Irish sunrise, and his heart as young as the wild, eternally
young heart of Ireland. She remembered what they had said to each
other. Raftery had said: 'I will carry you bravely, I will serve
you all the days of my life.' She had answered: 'I will care for
you night and day, Raftery&mdash;all the days of your life.' She
remembered their first run with the hounds together&mdash;she a
youngster of twelve, he a youngster of five. Great deeds they had
done on that day together, at least they had seemed like great
deeds to them&mdash;she had had a kind of fire in her heart as she
galloped astride of Raftery. She remembered her father, his
protective look, so broad, so kind, so patiently protective; and
towards the end it had stooped a little as though out of kindness
it carried a burden. Now she knew whose burden that back had been
bearing so that it stooped a little. He had been very proud of the
fine Irish horse, very proud of his small and courageous rider:
'Steady, Stephen!' but his eyes had been bright like Raftery's.
'Steady on, Stephen, we're coming to a. stiff one!' but once they
were over he had turned round and smiled, as he had done in the
days when the impudent Collins had stretched his inadequate legs to
their utmost to keep up with the pace of the hunters.</p>

<p>Long ago, it all seemed a long time ago. A long road it seemed,
leading where? She wondered. Her father had gone away into its
shadows, and now after him, limping a little, went Raftery; Raftery
with hollows above his eyes and down his grey neck that had once
been so firm; Raftery whose splendid white teeth were now yellowed
and too feeble to bite up his carrot.</p>

<p>The train jogged and swayed so that once the horse stumbled.
Springing up, she stretched out her hand to soothe him. He seemed
glad of her hand: 'Don't be frightened, Raftery. Did that hurt you
Raftery acquainted with pain on the road that led into the
shadows.</p>

<p>Presently the hills showed over on the left, but a long way off,
and when they came nearer they were suddenly very near on the
right, so near that she saw the white houses on them. They looked
dark; a kind of still, thoughtful darkness brooded over the hills
and their low white houses. It was always so in the later
afternoons, for the sun moved across to the wide Wye
Valley&mdash;it would set on the western side of the hills, over
the wide Wye Valley. The smoke from the chimney-stacks bent
downwards after rising a little and formed a blue haze, for the air
was heavy with spring and dampness. Leaning from the window she
could smell the spring, the time of mating, the time of fruition.
When the train stopped a minute outside the station she fancied
that she heard the singing of birds; very softly it came but the
sound was persistent&mdash;yes, surely, that was the singing of
birds...</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>They took Raftery in an ambulance from Great Malvern in order to
spare him the jar of the roads. That night he slept in his own
spacious loosebox, and the faithful Jim would not leave him that
night; he sat up and watched while Raftery slept in so deep a bed
of yellow-gold straw that it all but reached his knees when
standing. A last inarticulate tribute this to the most gallant
horse, the most courteous horse that ever stepped out of
stable.</p>

<p>But when the sun came up over Bredon, flooding the breadth of
the Severn Valley, touching the slopes of the Malvern Hills that
stand opposite Bredon across the valley, gilding the old red bricks
of Morton and the weather-vane on its quiet stables, Stephen went
into her father's study and she loaded his heavy revolver.</p>

<p>Then they led Raftery out and into the morning; they led him
with care to the big north paddock and stood him beside the mighty
hedge that had set the seal on his youthful valour. Very still he
stood with the sun on his flanks, the groom, Jim, holding the
bridle.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'I'm going to send you away, a long way away, and
I've never left you except for a little while since you came when I
was a child and you were quite young&mdash;but I'm going to send
you a long way away because of your pain. Raftery, this is death;
and beyond, they say, there's no more suffering.' She paused, then
spoke in a voice so low that the groom could not hear her: 'Forgive
me, Raftery.'</p>

<p>And Raftery stood there looking at Stephen, and his eyes were as
soft as an Irish morning, yet as brave as the eyes that looked into
his. Then it seemed to Stephen that he had spoken, that Raftery had
said: 'Since to me you are God, what have I to forgive you,
Stephen?'</p>

<p>She took a step forward and pressed the revolver high up against
Raftery's smooth, grey forehead. She fired, and he dropped to the
ground like a stone, lying perfectly still by the mighty hedge that
had set the seal on his youthful valour.</p>

<p>But now there broke out a great crying and wailing: 'Oh, me! Oh,
me! They've been murderin' Raftery! Shame, shame, I says, on the
'and what done it, and 'im no common horse but a Christian...' Then
loud sobbing as though some very young child had fallen down and
hurt itself badly. And there in a small, creaky, wicker bath-chair
sat Williams, being bumped along over the paddock by a youthful
niece, who had come to Morton to take care of the old and now
feeble couple; for Williams had had his first stroke that
Christmas, in addition to which he was almost childish. God only
knew who had told him this thing; the secret had been very
carefully guarded by Stephen, who, knowing his love for the horse,
had taken every precaution to spare him. Yet now here he was with
his face all twisted by the stroke and the sobs that kept on
rising. He was trying to lift his half-paralysed hand which kept
dropping back on to the arm of the bath-chair; he was trying to get
out of the bath-chair and run to where Raftery lay stretched out in
the sunshine; he was trying to speak again, but his voice had grown
thick so that no one could understand him. Stephen thought that his
mind had begun to wander, for now he was surely not screaming
'Raftery' any more, but something that sounded like: 'Master!' and
again, 'Oh, Master, Master!'</p>

<p>She said: 'Take him home,' for he did not know her; 'take him
home. You'd no business to bring him here at all&mdash;it's against
my orders, Who told him about it?'</p>

<p>And the young girl answered: 'It seemed 'e just knowed&mdash;it
was like as though Raftery told 'im...</p>

<p>Williams looked up with his blurred, anxious eyes. 'Who be you?'
he inquired. Then he suddenly smiled through his tears. 'It be good
to be seein' you, Master&mdash;seems like a long while...' His
voice was now clear but exceedingly small, a small, far-away thing.
If a doll had spoken, its voice might have sounded very much as the
old man's did at that moment.</p>

<p>Stephen bent over him. 'Williams, I'm Stephen&mdash;don't you
know me? It's Miss Stephen. You must go straight home and get back
to bed&mdash;it's still rather cold on these early spring
mornings&mdash;to please me, Williams, you must go straight home.
Why, your hands are frozen!'</p>

<p>But Williams shook his head and began to remember. 'Raftery,' he
mumbled, 'something's 'appened to Raftery.' And his sobs and his
tears broke out with fresh vigour, so that his niece, frightened,
tried to stop him.</p>

<p>'Now uncle be qui-et I do be-seech 'e! It's so bad for 'e
carryin' on in this wise. What will auntie say when she sees 'e all
mucked up with weepin', and yer poor nose all red and dir-ty? I'll
be takin' e' 'ome as Miss Stephen 'ere says. Now, uncle dear, do be
qui-et!'</p>

<p>She lugged the bath-chair round with a jolt and trundled it,
lurching, towards the cottage. All the way back down the big north
paddock Williams wept and wailed and tried to get out, but his
niece put one hefty young hand on his shoulder; with the other she
guided the lurching bath-chair.</p>

<p>Stephen watched them go, then she turned to the groom. 'Bury him
here,' she said briefly.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Before she left Morton that same afternoon, she went once more
into the large, bare stables. The stables were now completely
empty, for Anna had moved her carriage horses to new quarters
nearer the coachman's cottage.</p>

<p>Over one loosebox was a warped oak board bearing Collin's
studbook title, 'Marcus,' in red and blue letters; but the paint
was dulled to a ghostly grey by encroaching mildew, while a spider
had spun a large, purposeful web across one side of Collins'
manger. A cracked, sticky wine bottle lay on the floor; no doubt
used at some time for drenching Collins, who had died in a fit of
violent colic a few months after Stephen herself had left Morton.
On the window-sill of the farthest loosebox stood a curry comb and
couple of brushes; the comb was being eaten by rust, the brushes
had lost several clumps of bristles. A jam pot of hoof-polish, now
hard as stone, clung tenaciously to a short stick of firewood which
time had petrified into the polish. But Raftery's loosebox smelt
fresh and pleasant with the curious dry, clean smell of new straw.
A deep depression towards the middle showed where his body had lain
in sleep, and seeing this Stephen stooped down and touched it for a
moment. Then she whispered: 'Sleep peacefully, Raftery.'</p>

<p>She could not weep, for a great desolation too deep for tears
lay over her spirit&mdash;the great desolation of things that pass,
of things that pass away in our lifetime. And then of what good,
after all, are our tears, since they cannot hold back this passing
away&mdash;no, not for so much as a moment? She looked round her
now at the empty stables, the unwanted, uncared for stables of
Morton. So proud they had been that were now so humbled; and they
had the feeling of all disused places that have once teemed with
life, they felt pitifully lonely. She closed her eyes so as not to
see them. Then the thought came to Stephen that this was the end,
the end of her courage and patient endurance&mdash;that this was
somehow the end of Morton. She must not see the place any more; she
must, she would, go a long way away. Raftery had gone a long way
away&mdash;she had sent him beyond all hope of recall&mdash;but she
could not follow him over that merciful frontier, for her God was
more stern than Raftery's; and yet she must fly from her love for
Morton. Turning, she hurriedly left the stables.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Anna was standing at the foot of the stairs. 'Are you leaving
now, Stephen?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;I'm going, Mother.'</p>

<p>'A short visit!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I must get back to work.'</p>

<p>'I see...' Then after a long, awkward pause: 'Where would you
like him buried?'</p>

<p>'In the large north paddock where he died&mdash;I've told
Jim.'</p>

<p>'Very well, I'll see that they carry out your orders.' She
hesitated, as though suddenly shy of Stephen again, as she had been
in the past; but after a moment she went on quickly: 'I
thought&mdash;I wondered, would you like a small stone with his
name and some sort of inscription on it, just to mark the
place?'</p>

<p>'If you'd care to put one&mdash;I shan't need any stone to
remember.'</p>

<p>The carriage was waiting to drive her to Malvern. 'Good-bye,
Mother.'</p>

<p>Good-bye&mdash;I shall put up that stone.'</p>

<p>'Thanks, it's a very kind thought of yours.'</p>

<p>Anna said: 'I'm so sorry about this, Stephen.'</p>

<p>But Stephen had hurried into the brougham&mdash;the door dosed,
and she did not hear her mother.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter Thirty</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>At an old-fashioned, Kensington luncheon party, not very long
after Raftery's death, Stephen met and renewed her acquaintance
with Jonathan Brockett, the playwright. Her mother had wished her
to go to this luncheon, for the Carringtons were old family
friends, and Anna insisted that from time to time her daughter
should accept their invitations. At their house it was that Stephen
had first seen this young man, rather over a year ago. Brockett was
a connection of the Carringtons; had he not been Stephen might
never have met him, for such gatherings bored him exceedingly, and
therefore it was not his habit to attend them. But on that occasion
he had not been bored, for his sharp, grey eyes had lit upon
Stephen; and as soon as he well could, the meal being over, he had
made his way to her side and had remained there. She had found him
exceedingly easy to talk to, as indeed he had wished her to find
him.</p>

<p>This first meeting had led to one or two rides in the Row
together, since they both rode early. Brockett had joined her quite
casually one morning; after which he had called, and had talked to
Puddle as if he had come on purpose to see her and her
only&mdash;he had charming and thoughtful manners towards all
elderly people. Puddle had accepted him while disliking his
clothes, which were always just a trifle too careful; moreover she
had disapproved of his cuff-links&mdash;platinum links set with
tiny diamonds. All the same, she had made him feel very welcome,
for to her it had been any port in a storm just then&mdash;she
would gladly have welcomed the devil himself, had she thought that
he might rouse Stephen.</p>

<p>But Stephen was never able to decide whether Jonathan Brockett
attracted or repelled her. Brilliant he could be at certain times,
yet curiously foolish and puerile at others; and his hands were as
white and soft as a woman's&mdash;she would feel a queer little
sense of outrage creeping over her when she looked at his hands.
For those hands of his went so ill with him somehow; he was tall,
broad-shouldered, and of an extreme thinness. His clean-shaven face
was slightly sardonic and almost disconcertingly clever; an
inquisitive face too&mdash;one felt that it pried into everyone's
secrets without shame or mercy. It may have been genuine liking on
his part or mere curiosity that had made him persist in thrusting
his friendship on Stephen. But whatever it had been it had taken
the form of ringing her up almost daily at one time; of worrying
her to lunch or dine with him, of inviting himself to her flat in
Chelsea, or what was still worse, of dropping in on her whenever
the spirit moved him. His work never seemed to worry him at all,
and Stephen often wondered when his fine plays got written, for
Brockett very seldom if ever discussed them and apparently very
seldom wrote them; yet they always appeared at the 'critical moment
when their author had run short of money.</p>

<p>Once, for the sake of peace, she had dined with him in a species
of glorified cellar. He had just then discovered the queer little
place down in Seven Dials, and was very proud of it; indeed he was
making it rather the fashion among certain literary people. He had
taken a great deal of trouble that evening to make Stephen feel
that she belonged to these people by right of her talent, and had
introduced her as 'Stephen Gordon, the author of <i>The
Furrow</i>.' But all the while he had secretly watched her with his
sharp and inquisitive eyes. She had felt very much at ease with
Brockett as they sat at their dimly-lit table, perhaps because her
instinct divined that this man would never require of her more than
she could give&mdash;that the most he would ask for at any time
would be friendship.</p>

<p>Then one day he had casually disappeared, and she heard that he
had gone to Paris for some months, as was often his custom when the
climate of London had begun to get on his nerves. He had drifted
away like thistledown, without so much as a word of warning. He had
not said good-bye nor had he written, so that Stephen felt that she
had never known him, so completely did he go out of her life during
his sojourn in Paris. Later on she was to learn, when she knew him
better, that these disconcerting lapses of interest, amounting as
they did to a breach of good manners, were highly characteristic of
the man, and must of necessity be accepted by all who accepted
Jonathan Brockett.</p>

<p>And now here he was back again in England, and sitting next to
Stephen at the Carringtons' luncheon. And as though they had met
but a few hours ago, he took her up calmly just where he had left
her.</p>

<p>'May I come in tomorrow?'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;I'm awfully busy.'</p>

<p>'But I want to come, please; I can talk to Puddle.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid she'll be out.'</p>

<p>'Then I'll just sit and wait until she comes in; I'll be quiet
as a mouse.'</p>

<p>Oh, no, Brockett, please don't; I should know you were there and
that would disturb me.'</p>

<p>'I see. A new book?'</p>

<p>'Well, no&mdash;I'm trying to write some short stories; I've got
a commission from <i>The Good Housewife</i>.'</p>

<p>Sounds thrifty. I hope you're getting well paid.' Then after a
rather long pause: 'How's Raftery?'</p>

<p>For a second she did not answer, and Brockett, with quick
intuition, regretted his question. 'Not...not...' he stammered.</p>

<p>Yes,' she said slowly, 'Raftery's dead&mdash;he went lame. I
shot him.' He was silent. Then he suddenly took her hand and, still
without speaking, pressed it. Glancing up, she was surprised by the
look in his eyes, so sorrowful it was, and so understanding. He had
liked the old horse, for he liked all dumb creatures. But Raftery's
death could mean nothing to him; yet his sharp, grey eyes had now
softened with pity because she had had to shoot Raftery.</p>

<p>She thought: 'What a curious fellow he is. At this moment I
suppose he actually feels something almost like grief&mdash;it's my
grief he's getting&mdash;and tomorrow, of course, he'll forget all
about it.'</p>

<p>Which was true enough. Brockett could compress quite a lot of
emotion into an incredibly short space of time; could squeeze a
kind of emotional beef-tea from all those with whom life brought
him into contact&mdash;a strong brew, and one that served to
sustain and revivify his inspiration.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>For ten days Stephen heard nothing more, of Brockett; then he
rang up to announce that he was coming to dinner at her flat that
very same evening.</p>

<p>You'll get awfully little to eat,' warned Stephen, who was tired
to death and did not want him.</p>

<p>'Oh, all right, I'll bring some dinner along,' he said blithely,
and with that he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>At a quarter-past eight he arrived, late for dinner and loaded
like a pack-mule with brown paper parcels. He looked cross; he had
spoilt his new reindeer gloves with mayonnaise that had oozed
through a box containing the lobster salad.</p>

<p>He thrust the box into Stephen's hands. 'Here, you take
it&mdash;it's dripping. Can I have a wash rag?' But after a moment
he forgot the new gloves. 'I've raided Fortnum &amp;
Mason&mdash;such fun&mdash;I do love eating things out of cardboard
boxes. Hullo, Puddle darling! I sent you a plant. Did you get it? A
nice little plant with brown bobbles. It smells good, and it's got
a ridiculous name like an old Italian dowager or something. Wait a
minute&mdash;what's it called? Oh, yes, a baroniait's so humble to
have such a pompous name! Stephen, do be careful&mdash;don't rock
the lobster about like that. I told you the thing was
dripping&mdash;</p>

<p>He dumped his parcels on to the hall table.</p>

<p>'I'll take them along to the kitchen,' smiled Puddle.</p>

<p>'No, I will,' said Brockett, collecting them again, 'I'll do the
whole thing; you leave it to me. I adore other people's
kitchens.'</p>

<p>He was in his most foolish and tiresome mood&mdash;the mood when
his white hands made odd little gestures, when his laugh was too
high and his movements too small for the size of his
broad-shouldered, rather gaunt body. Stephen had grown to dread him
in this mood; there was something almost aggressive about it; it
would seem to her that he thrust it upon her, showing off like a
child at a Christmas party.</p>

<p>She said sharply: 'If you'll wait, I'll ring for the maid.' But
Brockett bad already invaded the kitchen.</p>

<p>She followed, to find the cook looking offended.</p>

<p>'I want lots and lots of dishes,' he announced. Then
unfortunately he happened to notice the parlourmaid's washing, just
back from the laundry.</p>

<p>'Brockett, what on earth are you doing?'</p>

<p>He had put on the girl's ornate frilled cap, and was busily
tying on her small apron. He paused for a moment. 'How do I look?
What a perfect duck of an apron!'</p>

<p>The parlourmaid giggled and Stephen laughed. That was the worst
of Jonathan Brockett, he could make you laugh in spite of
yourself&mdash;when you most disapproved you found yourself
laughing.</p>

<p>The food he had brought was the oddest assortment; lobster,
caramels, p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras, olives, a tin of
rich-mixed biscuits and a Camembert cheese that was smelling
loudly. There was also a bottle of Rose's lime-juice and another of
ready-made cocktails. He began to unpack the things one by one,
clamouring for plates and entr&eacute;e dishes. In the process he
made a great mess on the table by upsetting most of the lobster
salad.</p>

<p>He swore roundly. 'Damn the thing, it's too utterly bloody! It's
ruined my gloves, and now look at the table!' In grim silence the
cook repaired the damage.</p>

<p>This mishap appeared to have damped his ardour, for he sighed
and removed his cap and apron. 'Can anyone open this bottle of
olives? And the cocktails? Here, Stephen, you can tackle the
cheese; it seems rather shy, it won't leave its kennel.' In the end
it was Stephen and the cook who must do all the work, while
Brockett sat down on the floor and gave them ridiculous orders.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Brockett it was who ate most of the dinner, for Stephen was too
overtired to feel hungry; while Puddle, whose digestion was not
what it had been, was forced to content herself with a cutlet. But
Brockett ate largely, and as he did so he praised himself and his
food between mouthfuls.</p>

<p>Clever of me to have discovered the p&acirc;t&eacute;&mdash;I'm
so sorry for the geese though, aren't you, Stephen? The awful thing
is that it's simply delicious&mdash;I wish I knew the esoteric
meaning of these mixed emotions!' And he dug with a spoon at the
side that appeared to contain the most truffles.</p>

<p>From time to time he paused to inhale the gross little
cigarettes he affected. Their tobacco was black, their paper was
yellow, and they came from an unpropitious island where, as
Brockett declared, the inhabitants died in shoals every year of
some tropical fever. He drank a good deal of the Rose's lime-juice,
for this strong, rough tobacco always made him thirsty. Whisky went
to his head and wine to his liver, so that on the whole he was
forced to be temperate; but when he got home he would brew himself
coffee as viciously black as his tobacco.</p>

<p>Presently he said with a sigh of repletion: 'Well, you two, I've
finished&mdash;let's go into the study.'</p>

<p>As they left the table he seized the mixed biscuits and the
caramel creams, for he dearly loved sweet things. He would often go
out and buy himself sweets in Bond Street, for solitary
consumption.</p>

<p>In the study he sank down on to the divan. 'Puddle dear, do you
mind if I put my feet up? It's my new boot-maker, he's given me a
corn on my right little toe. It's too heart-breaking. It was such a
beautiful toe,' he murmured; 'quite perfect&mdash;the one toe
without a blemish!'</p>

<p>After this he seemed disinclined to talk. He had made himself a
nest with the cushions, and was smoking, and nibbling rich-mixed
biscuits, routing about in the tin for his favourites. But his eyes
kept straying across to Stephen with a puzzled and rather anxious
expression.</p>

<p>At last she said: 'What's the matter, Brockett? Is my necktie
crooked?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;it's not your necktie; it's something else.' He sat up
abruptly. 'As I came here to 'say it, I'll get the thing over!'</p>

<p>'Fire away, Brockett.'</p>

<p>'Do you think you'll hate me if I'm frank?'</p>

<p>'Of course not. Why should I hate you?'</p>

<p>'Very well then, listen.' And now his voice was so grave that
Puddle put down her embroidery. 'You listen to me, you, Stephen
Gordon. Your last book was inexcusably bad. It was no more like
what we all expected, had a right to expect of you after <i>The
Furrow</i>, than that plant I sent Puddle is like an oak
tree&mdash;I won't even compare it to that little plant, for the
plant's alive; your book isn't. Oh, I don't mean to say that it's
not well written; it's well written because you're just a born
writer&mdash;you feel words, you've a perfect ear for balance, and
a very good all-round knowledge of English. But that's not enough,
not nearly enough; all that's a mere suitable dress for a body. And
this time you've hung the dress on a dummy&mdash;a dummy can't stir
our emotions, Stephen. I was talking to Ogilvy only last night. He
gave you a good review, he told me, because he's got such a respect
for your talent that he didn't want to put on the damper. He's like
that&mdash;too merciful I always think&mdash;they've all been too
merciful to you, my dear. They ought to have literally skinned you
alive&mdash;that might have helped to show you your danger. My God!
and you wrote a thing like <i>The Furrow</i>! What's happened?
What's undermining your work? Because whatever it is, it's deadly!
it must be some kind of horrid dry rot. Ah, no, it's too bad and it
mustn't go on&mdash;we've got to do something, quickly.'</p>

<p>He paused, and she stared at him in amazement. Until now she had
never seen this side of Brockett, the side of the man that belonged
to his art, to all art&mdash;the one thing in life he
respected.</p>

<p>She said: 'Do you really mean what you're saying?'</p>

<p>'I mean every word,' he told her.</p>

<p>Then she asked him quite humbly: 'What must I do to save my
work?' for she realized that he had been speaking the stark, bitter
truth; that indeed she had needed no one to tell her that her last
book had been altogether unworthy&mdash;a poor, lifeless thing,
having no health in it.</p>

<p>He considered. 'It's a difficult question, Stephen. Your own
temperament is so much against you. You're so strong in some ways
and yet so timid&mdash;such a mixture&mdash;and you're terribly
frightened of life. Now why? You must try to stop being frightened,
to stop hiding your head. You need life, you need people. People
are the food that we writers live on; get out and devour them,
squeeze them dry, Stephen!'</p>

<p>'My father once told me something like that&mdash;not quite in
those words&mdash;but something very like it.'</p>

<p>'Then your father must have been a sensible man,' smiled
Brockett. 'Now I had a perfect beast of a father. Well, Stephen,
I'll give you my advice for what it's worth&mdash;you want a real
change. Why not go abroad somewhere? Get right away for a bit from
your England. You'll probably write it a damned sight better when
you're far enough off to see the perspective. Start with
Paris&mdash;it's an excellent jumping-off place. Then you might go
across to Italy or Spain&mdash;go anywhere, only do get a move on!
No wonder you're atrophied here in London. I can put you wise about
people in Paris. You ought to know Val&eacute;rie Seymour, for
instance. She's very good fun and a perfect darling; I'm sure you'd
like her, every one does. Her parties are a kind of human
bran-pie&mdash;you just plunge in your fist and see what happens.
You may draw a prize or you may draw blank, but it's always worth
while to go to her parties. Oh, but good Lord, there are so many
things that stimulate one in Paris.'</p>

<p>He talked on about Paris for a little while longer, then he got
up to go. 'Well, good-bye, my dears, I'm off. I've given myself
indigestion. And do look at Puddle, she's blind with fury; I
believe she's going to refuse to shake hands! Don't be angry,
Puddle&mdash;I'm very well-meaning.'</p>

<p>Yes, of course,' answered Puddle, but her voice sounded
cold.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>After he had gone they stared at each other, then Stephen said,
What a queer revelation. Who would have thought that Brockett could
get so worked up? His moods are kaleidoscopic.' She was
purposefully forcing herself to speak lightly.</p>

<p>But Puddle was angry, bitterly angry. Her pride was wounded to
the quick for Stephen. The man's a perfect fool!' she said gruffly.
'And I didn't agree with one word he said. I expect he's jealous of
your work, they all are. They're a mean-minded lot, these writing
people.'</p>

<p>And looking at her Stephen thought sadly, She's tired&mdash;I'm
wearing her out in my service. A few years ago she'd never have
tried to deceive me like this&mdash;she's losing courage.' Aloud
she said: 'Don't be cross with Brockett, he meant to be friendly,
I'm quite sure of that. My work will buck up&mdash;I've been
feeling slack lately, and it's told on my writing&mdash;I suppose
it was bound to.' Then the merciful lie, 'But I'm not a bit
frightened!'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen rested her head on her hand as she sat at her
desk&mdash;it was well past midnight. She was heartsick as only a
writer can be whose day has been spent in useless labour. All that
she had written that day she would destroy, and now it was well
past midnight. She turned, looking wearily round the study, and it
came upon her with a slight sense of shock that she was seeing this
room for the very first time, and that everything in it was
abnormally ugly. The flat had been furnished when her mind had been
too much afflicted to care in the least what she bought, and now
all her possessions seemed clumsy or puerile, from the small,
foolish chairs to the large, roll-top desk there was nothing
personal about any of them. How had she endured this room for so
long? Had she really written a fine book in it? Had she sat in it
evening after evening and come back to it morning after morning t
Then she must have been blind indeed&mdash;what a place for any
author to work in! She had taken nothing with her from Morton but
the hidden books found in her father's study; these she had taken,
as though in a way they were hers by some intolerable birthright;
for the rest she had shrunk from depriving the house of its ancient
and honoured possessions.</p>

<p>Morton&mdash;so quietly perfect a thing, yet the thing of all
others that she must fly from, that she must forget; but she could
not forget it in these surroundings; they reminded by contrast.
Curious what Brockett had said that evening about putting the sea
between herself and England...In view of her own half-formed plan
to do so, his words had come as a kind of echo of her thoughts; it
was almost as though he had peeped through a secret keyhole into
her mind, had been spying upon her trouble. By what right did this
curious man spy upon her&mdash;this man with the soft, white hands
of a woman, with the movements befitting those soft, white hands,
yet so ill-befitting the rest of his body? By no right; and how
much had the creature found out when his eye had been pressed to
that secret keyhole? Clever&mdash;Brackett was fiendishly
clever&mdash;all his whims and his foibles could not disguise it.
His face gave him away, a hard, clever face with sharp eyes that
were glued to other people's keyholes. That was why Brockett wrote
such fine plays, such cruel plays; he fed his genius on live flesh
and blood. Carnivorous genius. Moloch, fed upon live flesh and
blood! But she, Stephen, had tried to feed her inspiration upon
herbage, the kind, green herbage of Morton. For a little while such
food had sufficed, but now her talent had sickened, was dying
perhaps&mdash;or had she too fed it on blood, her heart's blood
when she had written <i>The Furrow</i> If so, her heart would not
bleed any more&mdash;perhaps it could not&mdash;perhaps it was dry.
A dry, withered thing; for she did not feel love these days when
she thought of Angela Crossby&mdash;that must mean that her heart
had died within her. A gruesome companion to have, a dead
heart.</p>

<p>Angela Crossby&mdash;and yet there were times when she longed
intensely to see this woman, to hear her speak, to stretch out her
arms and clasp them around the woman's body&mdash;not gently, not
patiently as in the past, but roughly, brutally even.
Beastly&mdash;it was beastly! She felt degraded. She had no love to
offer Angela Crossby, not now, only something that, lay like a
stain on the beauty of what had once been love. Even this memory
was marred and defiled, by herself even more than by Angela
Crossby.</p>

<p>Came the thought of that unforgettable scene with her mother. 'I
would rather see you dead at my feet.' Oh, yes&mdash;very easy to
talk about death, but not so easy to manage the dying. 'We two
cannot live together at Morton...One of us must go, which of us
shall it be?' The subtlety, the craftiness of that question which
in common decency could have but one answer! Oh, well she had gone
and would go even farther. Raftery was dead, there was nothing to
hold her, she was free&mdash;what a terrible thing could be
freedom. Trees were free when they were uprooted by the wind; ships
were free when they were torn from their moorings; men were free
when they were cast out of their homes&mdash;free to starve, free
to perish of cold and hunger.</p>

<p>At Morton there lived an ageing woman with sorrowful eyes now a
little dim from gazing for so long into the distance. Only once,
since her gaze had been fixed on the dead, had this woman turned it
full on her daughter; and then her eyes had been changed into
something accusing, ruthless, abominably cruel. Through looking
upon what had seemed abominable to them, they themselves had become
an abomination. Horrible! And yet how dared they accuse? What right
had a mother to abominate the child that had sprung from her own
secret moments of passion? She the honoured, the fulfilled, the
fruitful, the loving and loved, had despised the fruit of her love.
Its fruit? No, rather its victim.</p>

<p>She thought of her mother's protected life that had never had to
face this terrible freedom. Like a vine that clings to a warm
southern wall it had clung to her father&mdash;it still clung to
Morton. In the spring had come gentle and nurturing rains, in the
summer the strong and health-giving sunshine, in the winter a deep,
soft covering of snow&mdash;cold yet protecting the delicate
tendrils. All, all she had had. She had never gone empty of love in
the days of her youthful ardour; had never known longing, shame,
degradation, but rather great joy and great pride in her loving.
Her love had been pure in the eyes of the world, for she had been
able to indulge in it with honour. Still with honour, she had borne
a child to her mate&mdash;but a child who, unlike her, must go
unfulfilled all her days, or else live in abject dishonour. Oh, but
a hard and pitiless woman this mother must be for all her soft
beauty; shamelessly finding shame in her offspring. 'I would rather
see you dead at my feet...' 'Too late, too late, your love gave me
life. Here am I the creature you made through your loving; by your
passion you created the thing that I am. Who are you to deny me the
right to love? But for you I need never have known existence.'</p>

<p>And now there crept into Stephen's brain the worst torment of
all, a doubt of her father. He had known and knowing he had not
told her; he had pitied and pitying had not protected; he had
feared and fearing had saved only himself. Had she had a coward for
a father? She sprang up and began to pace the room. Not
this&mdash;she could not face this new torment. She had stained her
love, the love of a lover&mdash;she dared not stain this one thing
that remained, the love of the child for the father. If this light
went out the engulfing darkness would consume her, destroying her
entirely. Man could not live by darkness alone, one point of light
he must have for salvation&mdash;one point of light. The most
perfect Being of all had cried out for light in His
darkness&mdash;even He, the most perfect Being of all. And then as
though in answer to prayer, to some prayer that her trembling lips
had not uttered, came the memory of a patient, protective back,
bowed as though bearing another's burden. Came the memory of
horrible, soul-sickening pain: 'No&mdash;not that&mdash;something
urgent&mdash;I want&mdash;to say. No drugs&mdash;I know
I'm&mdash;dying&mdash;Evans.' And again a heroic and tortured
effort: 'Anna&mdash;it's Stephen&mdash;listen.' Stephen suddenly
held out her arms to this man who, though dead, was still her
father.</p>

<p>But even in this blessed moment of easement, her heart hardened
again at the thought of her mother. A fresh wave of bitterness
flooded her soul so that the light seemed all but extinguished;
very faintly it gleamed like the little lantern on a buoy that is
tossed by tempest. Sitting down at her desk she found pen and
paper.</p>

<p>She wrote: 'Mother, I am going abroad quite soon, but I shall
not see you to say good-bye, because I don't want to come back to
Morton. These visits of mine have always been painful, and now my
work is beginning to suffer&mdash;that I cannot allow; I live only
for my work and so I intend to guard it in future. There can now be
no question of gossip or scandal, for everyone knows that I am a
writer and as such may have occasion to travel. But in any case I
care very little these days for the gossip of neighbours. For
nearly three years I have borne your yoke&mdash;I have tried to be
patient and understanding. I have tried to think that your yoke was
a just one, a just punishment, perhaps, for my being what I am, the
creature whom you and my father created; but now I am going to bear
it no longer. If my father had lived he would have shown pity,
whereas you showed me none, and yet you were my mother. In my hour
of great need you utterly failed me; you turned me away like some
unclean thing that was unfit to live any longer at Morton. You
insulted what to me seemed both natural and sacred. I went, but now
I shall not come back any more to you or to Morton. Puddle will be
with me because she loves me; if I'm saved at all it is she who has
saved me, and so for as long as she wishes to throw in her lot with
me I shall let her. Only one thing more; she will send you our
address from time to time, but don't write to me, Mother, I am
going away in order to forget, and your letters would only remind
me of 'Morton.'</p>

<p>She read over what she had written, three times, finding nothing
at all that she wished to add, no word of tenderness, or of regret.
She felt numb and then unbelievably lonely, but she wrote the
address in her firm handwriting: 'The Lady Anna Gordon,' she wrote,
'Morton Hall, Near Upton-on-Severn.' And when she wept, as she
presently must do, covering her face with her large, brown hands,
her spirit felt unrefreshed by this weeping, for the hot, angry
tears seemed to scorch her spirit. Thus was Anna Gordon baptized
through her child as by fire, unto the loss of their mutual
salvation.</p>

<h3><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter Thirty-one</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>It was Jonathan Brockett who had recommended the little hotel in
the Rue St. Roch, and when Stephen and Puddle arrived one evening
that June, feeling rather tired and dejected, they found their
sitting-room bright with roses&mdash;roses for Puddle&mdash;and on
the table two boxes of Turkish cigarettes for Stephen. Brockett,
they learnt, had ordered these things by writing specially from
London.</p>

<p>Barely had they been in Paris a week, when Jonathan Brockett
turned up in person: 'Hallo, my dears, I've come over to see you.
Everything all right? Are you being looked after?' He sat down in
the only comfortable chair and proceeded to make himself charming
to Puddle. It seemed that his flat in Paris being let, he had tried
to get rooms at their hotel but had failed, so had gone instead to
the Meurice. 'But I'm not going to take you to lunch there,' he
told them, 'the weather's too fine, we'll go to Versailles.
Stephen, ring up and order your car, there's a darling! By the way,
how is Burton getting on? Does he remember to keep to the right and
to pass on the left?' His voice sounded anxious. Stephen reassured
him good-humouredly, she knew that he was apt to be nervous in
motors.</p>

<p>They lunched at the H&ocirc;tel des Reservoirs, Brockett taking
great pains to order special dishes. The waiters were zealous, they
evidently knew him: Oui, monsieur, tout de suite&mdash;&agrave;
l'instant, monsieur!' Other clients were kept waiting while
Brackett was served, and Stephen could see that this pleased him.
All through the meal he talked about Paris with ardour, as a lover
might talk of a mistress.</p>

<p>'Stephen, I'm not going back for ages. I'm going to make you
simply adore her. You'll see, I'll make you adore her so much that
you'll find yourself writing like a heaven-born genius. There's
nothing so stimulating as love&mdash;you've got to have an affair
with Paris!' Then looking at Stephen rather intently, 'I suppose
you're capable of falling in love?'</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, ignoring his question, but she
thought: 'He's putting his eye to the keyhole. His curiosity's
positively childish at times,' for she saw that his face had
fallen.</p>

<p>Oh, well, if you don't want to tell me&mdash;' he grumbled.</p>

<p>'Don't be silly! There's nothing to tell,' smiled Stephen. But
she made a mental note to be careful. Brockett's curiosity was
always most dangerous when apparently merely childish.</p>

<p>With quick tact he dropped the personal note. No good trying to
force her to confide, he decided, she was too damn clever to give
herself away, especially before the watchful old Puddle. He sent
for the bill and when it arrived, went over it item by item,
frowning.</p>

<p>'Maitre d'h&ocirc;tel!'</p>

<p>'Oui, monsieur?'</p>

<p>'You've made a mistake; only one liqueur brandy&mdash;and here's
another mistake, I ordered two portions of potatoes, not three; I
do wish to God you'd be careful!' When Brockett felt cross he
always felt mean. 'Correct this at once, it's disgusting!' he said
rudely. Stephen sighed, and hearing her Brockett looked up
unabashed: 'Well, why pay for what we've not ordered?' Then he
suddenly found his temper again and left a very large tip for the
waiter.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>There is nothing more difficult to attain to than the art of
being a perfect guide. Such an art, indeed, requires a real artist,
one who has a keen perception for contrasts, and an eye for the
large effects rather than for details, above all one possessed of
imagination; and Brockett, when he chose, could be such a
guide.</p>

<p>Having waved the professional guides to one side, he himself
took them through a part of the palace, and his mind re-peopled the
place for Stephen so that she seemed to see the glory of the
dancers led by the youthful Roi Soleil; seemed to hear the rhythm
of the throbbing violins, and the throb of the rhythmic dancing
feet as they beat down the length of the Galerie des Glaces; seemed
to see those other mysterious dancers who followed step by step, in
the long line of mirrors. But most skilfully of all did he recreate
for her the image of the luckless queen who came after; as though
for some reason this unhappy woman must appeal in a personal way to
Stephen. And true it was that the small, humble rooms which the
queen had chosen out of all that vast palace, moved Stephen
profoundly&mdash;so desolate they seemed, so full of unhappy
thoughts and emotions that were even now only half forgotten.</p>

<p>Brockett pointed to the simple garniture on the mantelpiece of
the little salon, then he looked at Stephen: 'Madame de Lamballe
gave those to the queen,' he murmured softly.</p>

<p>She nodded, only vaguely apprehending his meaning.</p>

<p>Presently they followed him out into the gardens and stood
looking across the Tapis Vert that stretches its quarter mile of
greenness towards a straight, lovely line of water.</p>

<p>Brockett said, very low, so that Puddle should not hear him:
'Those two would often come here at sunset. Sometimes they were
rowed along the canal in the sunset&mdash;can't you imagine it,
Stephen? They must often have felt pretty miserable, poor souls;
sick to death of the subterfuge and pretences. Don't you ever get
tired of that sort of thing? My God, I do!' But she did not answer,
for now there was no mistaking his meaning.</p>

<p>Last of all he took them to the Temple d'Amour, where it rests
amid the great silence of the years that have long lain upon the
dead hearts of its lovers; and from there to the Hameau, built by
the queen for a whim&mdash;the tactless and foolish whim of a
tactless and foolish but loving woman&mdash;by the queen who must
play at being a peasant, at a time when her downtrodden peasants
were starving. The cottages were badly in need of repair; a
melancholy spot it looked, this Hameau, in spite of the birds that
sang in its trees and the golden glint of the afternoon
sunshine.</p>

<p>On the drive back to Paris they were all very silent. Puddle was
feeling too tired to talk, and Stephen was oppressed by a sense of
sadness&mdash;the vast and rather beautiful sadness that may come
to us when we have looked upon beauty, the sadness that aches in
the heart of Versailles. Brockett was content to sit opposite
Stephen on the hard little let-down seat of her motor. He might
have been comfortable next to the driver, but instead he preferred
to sit opposite Stephen, and he too was silent, surreptitiously
watching the expression of her face in the gathering twilight.</p>

<p>When he left them he said with his cold little smile: 'Tomorrow,
before you've forgotten Versailles, I want you to come to the
Conciergerie. It's very enlightening&mdash;cause and effect.'</p>

<p>At that moment Stephen disliked him intensely. All the same he
had stirred her imagination.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed, Brockett showed Stephen just as much
of Paris as he wished her to see, and this principally consisted of
the tourist's Paris. Into less simple pastures he would guide her
later on, always provided that his interest lasted. For the
present, however, he considered it wiser to tread delicately like
Agag. The thought of this girl had begun to obsess him to a very
unusual extent. He who had prided himself on his skill in ferreting
out other people's secrets, was completely baffled by this youthful
abnormal. That she was abnormal he had no doubt whatever, but what
he was keenly anxious to find out was just how her own abnormality
struck her&mdash;he felt pretty sure that she worried about it. And
he genuinely liked her. Unscrupulous he might be in his vivisection
of men and women; cynical too when it came to his pleasures,
himself an invert, secretly hating the world which he knew hated
him in secret; and yet in his way he felt sorry for Stephen, and
this amazed him, for Jonathan Brockett had long ago, as he thought,
done with pity. But his pity was a very poor thing at best, it
would never defend and never protect her; it would always go down
before any new whim, and his whim at the moment was to keep her in
Paris.</p>

<p>All unwittingly Stephen played into his hands, while having no
illusions about him. He represented a welcome distraction that
helped her to keep her thoughts off England. And because under
Brockett's skilful guidance she developed a fondness for the
beautiful city, she felt tolerant of him at moments, almost
grateful she felt, grateful too towards Paris. And Puddle also felt
grateful.</p>

<p>The strain of the sudden complete rupture with Morton had told
on the faithful little grey woman. She would scarcely have known
how to counsel Stephen had the girl come to her and asked for her
counsel. Sometimes she would lie awake now at nights thinking of
that ageing and unhappy mother in the great silent house, and then
would come pity, the old pity that had come in the past for
Anna&mdash;she would pity until she remembered Stephen. Then Puddle
would try to think very calmly, to keep the brave heart that had
never failed her, to keep her strong faith in Stephen's
future&mdash;only now there were days when she felt almost old,
when she realized that indeed she was ageing. When Anna would write
her a calm, friendly letter, but with never so much as a mention of
Stephen, she would feel afraid, yes, afraid of this woman, and at
moments almost afraid of Stephen. For none might know from those
guarded letters what emotions lay in the heart of their writer; and
none might know from Stephen's set face when she recognized the
writing, what lay in her heart. She would turn away, asking no
questions about Morton.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Puddle felt old and actually frightened, both of which
sensations she deeply resented; so being what she was, an
indomitable fighter, she thrust out her chin and ordered a tonic.
She struggled along through the labyrinths of Paris beside the
untiring Stephen and Brockett; through the galleries of the
Luxembourg and the Louvre; up the Eiffel Tower&mdash;in a lift,
thank heaven; down the Rue de la Paix, up the hill to
Montmartre&mdash;sometimes in the car but quite often on foot, for
Brockett wished Stephen to learn her Paris&mdash;and as likely as
not, ending up with rich food that disagreed badly with the tired
Puddle. In the restaurants people would stare at Stephen, and
although the girl would pretend not to notice, Puddle would know
that in spite of her calm, Stephen was inwardly feeling resentful,
was inwardly feeling embarrassed and awkward. And then because she
was tired, Puddle too would feel awkward when she noticed those
people staring.</p>

<p>Sometimes Puddle must really give up and rest, in spite of the
aggressive chin and the tonic. Then all alone in the Paris hotel,
she would suddenly grow very homesick for England&mdash;absurd of
course, and yet there it was, she would feel the sharp tug of
England. At such moments she would long for ridiculous things; a
penny bun in the train at Dover; the good red faces of English
porters&mdash;the old ones with little stubby side-whiskers;
Harrods Stores; a properly upholstered armchair; bacon and eggs;
the sea front at Brighton. All alone and via these ridiculous
things, Puddle would feel the sharp tug of England.</p>

<p>And one evening her weary mind must switch back to the earliest
days of her friendship with Stephen. What a lifetime ago it seemed
since the days when a lanky colt of a girl of fourteen had been
licked into shape in the schoolroom at Morton. She could hear her
own words: 'You've forgotten something, Stephen; the books can't
walk to the bookcase, but you can, so suppose that you take them
with you,' and then: 'Even my brain won't stand your complete lack
of method.' Stephen fourteen&mdash;that was twelve years ago. In
those years she, Puddle, had grown very tired, tired with trying to
see some way out, some way of escape, of fulfilment for Stephen.
And always they seemed to be toiling, they two, down an endless
road that had no turning; she an ageing woman herself unfulfilled;
Stephen still young and as yet still courageous&mdash;but the day
would come when her youth would fail, and her courage, because of
that endless toiling.</p>

<p>She thought of Brockett, Jonathan Brockett, surely an unworthy
companion for Stephen; a thoroughly vicious and cynical man, a
dangerous one too because he was brilliant. Yet she, Puddle, was
actually grateful to this man; so dire were their straits that she
was grateful to Brockett. Then came the remembrance of that other
man, Martin Hallam&mdash;she had had such high hopes. He had been
very simple and honest and good&mdash;Puddle felt that there was
much to be said for goodness. But for such as Stephen men like
Martin Hallam could seldom exist; as friends they would fail her,
while she in her turn would fail them as lover. Then what remained?
Jonathan Brockett? Like to like. No, no, an intolerable thought!
Such a thought as that was an outrage on Stephen. Stephen was
honourable and courageous; she was steadfast in friendship and
selfless in loving; intolerable to think that her only companions
must be men and women like Jonathan Brockett&mdash;and
yet&mdash;after all what else? What remained? Loneliness, or worse
still, far worse because it so deeply degraded the spirit, a life
of perpetual subterfuge, of guarded opinions and guarded actions,
of lies of omission if not of speech, of becoming an accomplice in
the world's injustice by maintaining at all times a judicious
silence, making and keeping the friends one respected, on false
pretences, because if they knew they would turn aside, even the
friends one respected.</p>

<p>Puddle abruptly controlled her thoughts; this was no way to be
helpful to Stephen. Sufficient unto the day was the evil thereof.
Getting up she went into her bedroom where she bathed her face and
tidied her hair.</p>

<p>'I look scarcely human,' she thought ruefully, as she stared at
her own reflection in the glass; and indeed at that moment she
looked more than her age.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>It was not until nearly the middle of July that Brockett took
Stephen to Val&eacute;rie Seymour's. Val&eacute;rie had been away
for some time, and was even now only passing through Paris en route
for her villa at St. Tropez.</p>

<p>As they drove to her apartment on the Quai Voltaire, Brockett
began to extol their hostess, praising her wit, her literary
talent. She wrote delicate satires and charming sketches of Greek
maeurs&mdash;the latter were very outspoken, but then
Val&eacute;rie's life was very outspoken&mdash;she was, said
Brockett, a kind of pioneer who would probably go down to history.
Most of her sketches were written in French, for among other things
Val&eacute;rie was bilingual; she was also quite rich, an American
uncle had had the foresight to leave her his fortune; she was also
quite young, being just over thirty, and according to Brockett,
good-looking. She lived her life in great calmness of spirit, for
nothing worried and few things distressed her. She was firmly
convinced that in this ugly age one should strive to the top of
one's bent after beauty. But Stephen might find her a bit of a
free-lance, she was libre penseuse when it came to the heart; her
love affairs would fill quite three volumes, even after they had
been expurgated. Great men had loved her, great writers had written
about her, one had died, it was said, because she refused him, but
Val&eacute;rie was not attracted to men&mdash;yet as Stephen would
see if she went to her parties, she had many devoted friends among
men. In this respect she was almost unique, being what she was, for
men did not resent her. But then of course all intelligent people
realized that she was a creature apart, as would Stephen the moment
she met her.</p>

<p>Brockett babbled away, and as he did so his voice took on the
effeminate timbre that Stephen always hated and dreaded: 'Oh, my
dear!' he exclaimed with a high little laugh. 'I'm so excited about
this meeting of yours, I've a feeling it may be momentous. What
fun!' And his soft, white hands grew restless making their foolish
gestures.</p>

<p>She looked at him coldly, wondering the while how she could
tolerate this young man&mdash;why indeed, she chose to endure
him.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>The first thing that struck Stephen about Val&eacute;rie's flat
was its large and rather splendid disorder. There was something
blissfully unkempt about it, as though its mistress were too much
engrossed in other affairs to control its behaviour. Nothing was
quite where it ought to have been, and much was where it ought not
to have been, while over the whole lay a faint layer of
dust&mdash;even over the spacious salon. The odour of somebody's
Oriental scent was mingling with the odour of tuberoses in a
sixteenth-century chalice. On a divan, whose truly regal
proportions occupied the best part of a shadowy alcove, lay a box
of Fuller's peppermint creams and a lute, but the strings of the
lute were broken.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie came forward with a smile of welcome. She was not
beautiful nor was she imposing, but her limbs were very perfectly
proportioned, which gave her a fictitious look of tallness. She
moved well, with the quiet and unconscious grace that sprang from
those perfect proportions. Her face was humorous, placid and
worldly; her eyes very kind, very blue, very lustrous. She was
dressed all in white, and a large white fox skin was clasped round
her slender and shapely shoulders. For the rest she had masses of
thick fair hair, which was busily ridding itself of its hairpins;
one could see at a glance that it hated restraint, like the flat it
was in rather splendid disorder.</p>

<p>She said: 'I'm so delighted to meet you at last, Miss Gordon, do
come and sit down. And please smoke if you want to,' she added
quickly, glancing at Stephen's tell-tale fingers.</p>

<p>Brockett said: 'Positively, this is too splendid! I feel that
you're going to be wonderful friends.'</p>

<p>Stephen thought: 'So this is Val&eacute;rie Seymour.'</p>

<p>No sooner were they seated than Brockett began to ply their
hostess with personal questions. The mood that had incubated in the
motor was now become extremely aggressive, so that he fidgeted
about on his chair, making his little inadequate gestures.
'Darling, you're looking perfectly lovely! But do tell me, what
have you done with Polinska? Have you drowned her in the blue
grotto at Capri? I hope so, my dear, she <i>was</i> such a bore and
so dirty! Do tell me about Polinska. How did she behave when you
got her to Capri? Did she bite anybody before you drowned her? I
always felt frightened; I loathe being bitten!'</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie frowned: 'I believe she's quite well.'</p>

<p>'Then you have drowned her, darling!' shrilled Brockett.</p>

<p>And now he was launched on a torrent of gossip about people of
whom Stephen had never even heard: 'Pat's been deserted&mdash;have
you heard that, darling? Do you think she'll take the veil or
cocaine or something One never quite knows what may happen next
with such an emotional temperament, does one? Arabella's skipped
off to the Lido with Jane Grigg. The Grigg's just come into pots
and pots of money, so I hope they'll be deliriously happy and silly
while it lasts&mdash;I mean the money...Oh, and have you heard
about Rachel Morris? They say...' He flowed on and on like a brook
in spring flood, while Val&eacute;rie yawned and looked bored,
making monosyllabic answers.</p>

<p>And Stephen as she sat there and smoked in silence, thought
grimly: 'This is all being said because of me. Brockett wants to
let me see that he knows what I am, and he wants to let
Val&eacute;rie Seymour know too&mdash;I suppose this is making me
welcome.' She hardly knew whether to feel outraged or relieved that
here, at least, was no need for pretences.</p>

<p>But after a while she began to fancy that Val&eacute;rie's eyes
had become appraising. They were weighing her up and secretly
approving the result, she fancied. A slow anger possessed her.
Val&eacute;rie Seymour was secretly approving, not because her
guest was a decent human being with a will to work, with a
well-trained brain, with what might some day become a fine talent,
but rather because she was seeing before her all the outward
stigmata of the abnormal&mdash;verily the wounds of One nailed to a
cross&mdash;that was why Val&eacute;rie sat there approving.</p>

<p>And then, as though these bitter thoughts had reached her,
Val&eacute;rie suddenly smiled at Stephen. Turning her back on the
chattering Brockett, she started to talk to her guest quite gravely
about her work, about books in general, about life in general; and
as she did so Stephen began to understand better the charm that
many had found in this woman; a charm that lay less in physical
attraction than in a great courtesy and understanding, a great will
to please, a great impulse towards beauty in all its
forms&mdash;yes, therein lay her charm. And as they talked on it
dawned upon Stephen that here was no mere libertine in love's
garden, but rather a creature born out of her epoch, a pagan
chained to an age that was Christian, one who would surely say with
Pierre Louys: 'Le monde moderne succombe sous un envahissement de
laideur.' And she thought that she discerned in those luminous
eyes, the pale yet ardent light of the fanatic.</p>

<p>Presently Val&eacute;rie Seymour asked her how long she would be
remaining in Paris.</p>

<p>And Stephen answered: 'I'm going to live here,' feeling
surprised at the words as she said them, for not until now had she
made this decision.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie seemed pleased: 'If you want a house, I know of
one in the Rue Jacob; it's a tumbledown place, but it's got a fine
garden. Why not go and see it? You might go tomorrow. Of course
you'll have to live on this side, the Rive Gauche is the only
possible Paris.</p>

<p>'I should like to see the old house,' said Stephen.</p>

<p>So Val&eacute;rie went to the telephone there and then and
proceeded to call up the landlord. The appointment was made for
eleven the next morning. 'It's rather a sad old house,' she warned,
'no one has troubled to make it a home for some time, but you'll
alter all that if you take it, because I suppose you'll make it
your home.'</p>

<p>Stephen flushed: 'My home's in England,' she said quickly, for
her thoughts had instantly flown back to Morton.</p>

<p>But Val&eacute;rie answered: 'One may have two homes&mdash;many
homes. Be courteous to our lovely Paris and give it the privilege
of being your second home&mdash;it will feel very honoured, Miss
Gordon.' She sometimes made little ceremonious speeches like this,
and coming from her, they sounded strangely old-fashioned.</p>

<p>Brockett, rather subdued and distinctly pensive as sometimes
happened if Val&eacute;rie had snubbed him, complained of a pain
above his right eye: 'I must take some phenacetin,' he said sadly,
'I'm always getting this curious pain above my right eye&mdash;do
you think it's the sinus?' He was very intolerant of all pain.</p>

<p>His hostess sent for the phenacetin, and Brockett gulped down a
couple of tablets: 'Val&eacute;rie doesn't love me any more,' he
sighed, with a woebegone look at Stephen. 'I do call it hard, but
it's always what happens when I introduce my best friends to each
other&mdash;they forgather at once and leave me in the cold; but
then, thank heaven, I'm very forgiving.'</p>

<p>They laughed and Val&eacute;rie made him get on to the divan
where he promptly lay down on the lute.</p>

<p>'Oh God!' he moaned, 'now I've injured my spine&mdash;I'm so
badly upholstered.' Then he started to strum on the one sound
string of the lute.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie went over to her untidy desk and began to write
out a list of addresses: 'These may be useful to you, Miss
Gordon.'</p>

<p>Stephen!' exclaimed Brockett. 'Call the poor woman Stephen!'
'May I?'</p>

<p>Stephen acquiesced: 'Yes, please do.'</p>

<p>Very well then, I'm Val&eacute;rie. Is that a bargain?'</p>

<p>'The bargain is sealed,' announced Brockett. With extraordinary
skill he was managing to strum 'O Sole Mio' on the single string,
when he suddenly stopped: 'I knew there was something&mdash;your
fencing Stephen, you've forgotten your fencing. We meant to ask
Val&eacute;rie for Buisson's address; they say he's the finest
master in Europe.'</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie looked up: 'Does Stephen fence, then?'</p>

<p>'Does she fence! She's a marvellous, champion fencer.'</p>

<p>'He's never seen me fence,' explained Stephen, 'and I'm never
likely to be a champion.'</p>

<p>'Don't you believe her, she's trying to be modest. I've heard
that she fences quite as finely as she writes,' he insisted. And
somehow Stephen felt touched, Brockett was trying to show off her
talents.</p>

<p>Presently she offered him a lift in the car, but he shook his
head: 'No, thank you, dear one, I'm staying.' So she wished them
goodbye; but as she left them she heard Brockett murmuring to
Val&eacute;rie Seymour, and she felt pretty sure that she caught
her own name.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>6</b>
</p>

<p>Well what did you think of Miss Seymour?' inquired Puddle, when
Stephen got back about twenty minutes later.</p>

<p>Stephen hesitated: 'I'm not perfectly certain. She was very
friendly, but I couldn't help feeling that she liked me because she
thought me&mdash;oh, well, because she thought me what I am,
Puddle. But I may have been wrong&mdash;she was awfully friendly.
Brockett was at his very worst though, poor devil! His environment
seems to go to his head.' She sank down wearily on to a chair: Oh,
Puddle, Puddle, it's a hell of a business.'</p>

<p>Puddle nodded.</p>

<p>Then Stephen said rather abruptly: 'All the same, we're going to
live here in Paris. We're going to look at a house tomorrow, an old
house with a garden in the Rue Jacob.'</p>

<p>For a moment Puddle hesitated, then she said: 'There's only one
thing against it. Do you think you'll ever be happy in a city?
You're so fond of the life that belongs to the country.'</p>

<p>Stephen shook her head: 'That's all past now, my dear; there's
no country for me away from Morton. But in Paris I might make some
sort of a home, I could work here&mdash;and then of course there
are people...</p>

<p>Something started to hammer in Puddle's brain: 'Like to like!
Like to like! Like to like!' it hammered.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter Thirty-two</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen bought the house in the Rue Jacob, because as she walked
through the dim, grey archway that led from the street to the
cobbled courtyard, and saw the deserted house standing before her,
she knew at once that there she would live. This will happen
sometimes, we instinctively feel in sympathy with certain
dwellings.</p>

<p>The courtyard was sunny and surrounded by walls. On the right of
this courtyard some iron gates led into the spacious, untidy
garden, and woefully neglected though this garden had been, the
trees that it still possessed were fine ones. A marble fountain
long since choked with weeds, stood in the centre of what had been
a lawn. In the farthest corner of the garden some hand had erected
a semicircular temple, but that had been a long time ago, and now
the temple was all but ruined.</p>

<p>The house itself would need endless repairs, but its rooms were
of careful and restful proportions. A fine room with a window that
opened on the garden would be Stephen's study; she could write
there in quiet; on the other side of the stone-paved hall was a
smaller but comfortable salle a manger; while past the stone
staircase a little round room in a turret would be Puddle's
particular sanctum. Above there were bedrooms enough and to spare:
there was also the space for a couple of bathrooms. The day after
Stephen had seen this house, she had written agreeing to
purchase.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie rang up before leaving Paris to inquire how
Stephen had liked the old house, and when she heard that she had
actually bought it, she expressed herself as being delighted.</p>

<p>We'll be quite close neighbours now,' she remarked, 'but I'm not
going to bother you until you evince, not even when I get back in
the autumn. I know you'll be literally snowed under with workmen
for months, you poor dear, I feel sorry for you. But when you can,
do let me come and see you&mdash;meanwhile if I can help you at
all...' And she gave her address at St. Tropez.</p>

<p>And now for the first time since leaving Morton, Stephen turned
her mind to the making of a home. Through Brockett she found a
young architect who seemed anxious to carry out all her
instructions. He was one of those very rare architects who refrain
from thrusting their views on their clients. So into the ancient,
deserted house in the Rue Jacob streamed an army of workmen, and
they hammered and scraped and raised clouds of dust from early
morning, all day until evening&mdash;smoking harsh caporal as they
joked or quarrelled or idled or spat or hummed snatches of song.
And amazingly soon, wherever one trod one seemed to be treading on
wet cement or on dry, gritty heaps of brick dust and rubble, so
that Puddle would complain that she spoilt all her shoes, while
Stephen would emerge with her neat blue serge shoulders quite grey,
and with even her hair thickly powdered.</p>

<p>Sometimes the architect would come to the hotel in the evening
and then would ensue long discussions. Bending over the little
mahogany table, he and Stephen would study the plans intently, for
she wished to preserve the spirit of the place intact, despite
alterations. She decided to have an Empire study with grey walls
and curtains of Empire green, for she loved the great roomy writing
tables that had come into being with the first Napoleon. The walls
of the salle &agrave; manger should be white and the curtains
brown, while Puddle's round sanctum in its turret should have walls
and paintwork of yellow, to give the illusion of sunshine. And so
absorbed did Stephen become in these things, that she scarcely had
time to notice Jonathan Brockett's abrupt departure for a mountain
top in the Austrian Tyrol. Having suddenly come to the end of his
finances, he must hasten to write a couple of plays that could be
produced in London that winter. He sent her three or four picture
postcards of glaciers, after which she heard nothing more from
him.</p>

<p>At the end of August, when the work was well under way, she and
Puddle fared forth in the motor to visit divers villages and towns
in quest of old furniture, and Stephen was surprised to find how
much she enjoyed it. She would catch herself whistling as she drove
her car, and when they got back to some humble auberge in the
evening, she would want to eat a large supper. Every morning she
diligently swung her dumb-bells; she was getting into condition for
fencing. She had not fenced at all since leaving Morton, having
been too much engrossed in her work while in London; but now she
was going to fence before Buisson, so she diligently swung her
dumb-bells. During these two months of holiday-making she grew fond
of the wide-eyed, fruitful French country, even as she had grown
fond of Paris. She would never love it as she loved the hills and
the stretching valleys surrounding Morton, for that love was
somehow a part of her being, but she gave to this France, that
would give her a home, a quiet and very sincere affection. Her
heart grew more grateful with every mile, for hers was above all a
grateful nature.</p>

<p>They returned to Paris at the end of October. And now came the
selecting of carpets and curtains; of fascinating blankets from the
Magasin de Blanc&mdash;blankets craftily dyed to match any bedroom;
of fine linen, and other expensive things, including the copper
batterie de cuisine, which latter, however, was left to Puddle. At
last the army of workmen departed, its place being taken by a
Breton menage&mdash;brown-faced folk, strong-limbed and capable
looking&mdash;a mother, father and daughter. Pierre, the butler,
had been a fisherman once, but the sea with its hardness had
prematurely aged him. He had now been in service for several years,
having contracted rheumatic fever which had weakened his heart and
made him unfit for the strenuous life of a fisher. Pauline his
wife, was considerably younger, and she it was who would reign in
the kitchen, while their daughter Ad&egrave;le, a girl of eighteen,
would help both her parents and look after the housework.</p>

<p>Ad&egrave;le was as happy as a blackbird in springtime; she
would often seem just on the verge of chirping. But Pauline had
stood and watched the great storms gather over the sea while her
men were out fishing; her father had lost his life through the sea
as had also a brother, so Pauline smiled seldom. Dour she was, with
a predilection for dwelling in detail on people's misfortunes. As
for Pierre, he was stolid, kind and pious, with the eyes of a man
who has looked on vast spaces. His grey stubbly hair was cut short
to his head en brosse, and he had an ungainly figure. When he
walked he straddled a little as though he could never believe in a
house without motion. He liked Stephen at once, which was very
propitious, for one cannot buy the goodwill of a Breton.</p>

<p>Thus gradually chaos gave place to order, and on the morning of
her twenty-seventh birthday, on Christmas Eve, Stephen moved into
her home in the Rue Jacob on the old Rive Gauche, there to start
her new life in Paris.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>All alone in the brown and white salle &agrave; manger, Stephen
and Puddle ate their Christmas dinner. And Puddle had bought a
small Christmas tree and had trimmed it, then hung it with coloured
candles. A little wax Christ-child bent downwards and sideways from
His branch, as though He were looking for His presents&mdash;only
now there were not any presents. Rather clumsily Stephen lit the
candles as soon as the daylight had almost faded. Then she and
Puddle stood and stared at the tree, but in silence, because they
must both remember. But Pierre, who like all who have known the
sea, was a child at heart, broke into loud exclamations. Oh, comme
c'est beau, l'arbre de Noel!' he exclaimed, and he fetched the dour
Pauline along from the kitchen, and she too exclaimed; then they
both fetched Ad&egrave;le and they all three exclaimed: 'Comme
c'est beau, l'arbre de Noel!' So, that after all the little wax
Christ-child did not very much miss His presents.</p>

<p>That evening Pauline's two brothers arrived&mdash;they were
Poilus stationed just outside Paris&mdash;and they brought along
with them another young man, one Jean, who was ardently courting
Ad&egrave;le. Very soon came the sound of singing and laughter from
the kitchen, and when Stephen went up to her bedroom to look for a
book, there was Ad&egrave;le quite flushed and with very bright
eyes because of this Jean&mdash;in great haste she turned down the
bed and then flew on the wings of love back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>But Stephen went slowly downstairs to her study where Puddle was
sitting in front of the fire, and she thought that Puddle sat there
as though tired; her hands were quite idle, and after a moment
Stephen noticed that she was dozing. Very quietly Stephen opened
her book, unwilling to rouse the little grey woman who looked so
small in the huge leather chair, and whose head kept guiltily
nodding. But the book seemed scarcely worth troubling to read, so
that presently Stephen laid it aside and sat staring into the
flickering logs that hummed and burnt blue because it was frosty.
On the Malvern Hills there would probably be snow; deep snow might
be capping the Worcestershire Beacon. The air up at British Camp
would be sweet with the smell of winter and open
spaces&mdash;little lights would be glinting far down in the
valley. At Morton the lakes would be still and frozen, so Peter the
swan would be feeling friendly&mdash;in winter he had always fed
from her hand&mdash;he must be old now, the swan called Peter.
Coup! C-o-u-p! and Peter waddling towards her. He, who was all
gliding grace on the water, would come awkwardly waddling towards
her hand for the chunk of dry bread that she held in her fingers.
Jean with his Ad&egrave;le along in the kitchen&mdash;a
nice-looking boy he was, Stephen had seen him&mdash;they were
young, and both were exceedingly happy, for their parents approved,
so some day they would marry. Then children would come, too many,
no doubt, for Jean's slender purse, and yet in this life one must
pay for one's pleasures&mdash;they would pay with their children,
and this appeared perfectly fair to Stephen. She thought that it
seemed a long time ago since she herself had been a small child,
romping about on the floor with her father, bothering Williams down
at the stables, dressing up as young Nelson and posing for Collins
who had sometimes been cross to young Nelson. She was nearly
thirty, and what had she done? Written one good novel and one very
bad one, with a few mediocre short stories thrown in. Oh, well, she
was going to start writing again quite soon&mdash;she had an idea
for a novel. But she sighed, and Puddle woke up with a start.</p>

<p>'Is that you, my dear a Have I been asleep?'</p>

<p>Only for a very few minutes, Puddle.'</p>

<p>Puddle glanced at the new gold watch on her wrist; it had been a
Christmas present from Stephen. 'It's past ten o'clock&mdash;I
think I'll turn in.'</p>

<p>'Do. Why not? I hope Ad&egrave;le's filled your hot-water
bottle; she's rather light-headed over her Jean.'</p>

<p>'Never mind, I can fill it myself,' smiled Puddle.</p>

<p>She went, and Stephen sat on by the fire with her eyes half
dosed and her lips set firmly. She must put away all these thoughts
of the past and compel herself to think of the future. This
brooding over things that were past was all wrong; it was futile,
weak-kneed and morbid. She had her work, work that cried out to be
done, but no more unworthy books must be written. She must show
that being the thing she was, she could climb to success over all
opposition, could climb to success in spite of a world that was
trying its best to get her under. Her mouth grew hard; her
sensitive lips that belonged by rights to the dreamer, the lover,
took on a resentful and bitter line which changed her whole face
and made it less comely. At that moment the striking likeness to
her father appeared to have faded out of her face.</p>

<p>Yes, it was trying to get her under, this world with its mighty
self-satisfaction, with its smug rules of conduct, all made to be
broken by those who strutted and preened themselves on being what
they considered normal. They trod on the necks of those thousands
of others who, for God knew what reason, were not made as they
were; they prided themselves on their indignation, on what they
proclaimed as their righteous judgments. They sinned grossly; even
vilely at times, like lustful beasts&mdash;but yet they were
normal! And the vilest of them could point a finger of scorn at
her, and be loudly applauded.</p>

<p>'God damn them to hell!' she muttered.</p>

<p>Along in the kitchen there was singing again. The young men's
voices rose tuneful and happy, and with them blended Ad&egrave;le's
young voice very sexless as yet, like the voice of a choirboy.
Stephen got up and opened the door, then stood quite still and
listened intently. The singing soothed her overstrained nerves as
it flowed from the hearts of these simple people. For she did not
begrudge them their happiness; she did not resent young Jean with
his Ad&egrave;le, or Pierre who had done a man's work in his time,
or Pauline who was often aggressively female. Bitter she had grown
in these years since Morton, but not bitter enough to resent the
simple. And then as she listened they suddenly stopped for a little
before they resumed their singing, and when they resumed it the
tune was sad with the sadness that dwells in the souls of most men,
above all in the patient soul of the peasant.</p>

<blockquote>'Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abb&eacute;,<br>
Ma Dou&eacute;?'</blockquote>

<p>She could hear the soft Breton words quite clearly.</p>

<blockquote>'Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abb&eacute;,<br>
Pour nous dire la Messe<br>
Quand la nuit sera bien tomb&eacute;e<br>
Je tiendrai ma promesse.'<br>
<br>
Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abb&eacute;,<br>
Ma Dou&eacute;,<br>
Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abb&eacute;,<br>
Sans nappe de fine toile?'<br>
'Notre Doux Seigneur poserai<br>
Sur un morceau de voile.'<br>
<br>
'Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abb&eacute;,<br>
Ma Dou&eacute;,<br>
Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abb&eacute;,<br>
Sans chandelle et sans cierge?'<br>
'Les astres seront allum&eacute;s<br>
Par Madame la Vierge.'<br>
<br>
Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abbe,<br>
Ma Dou&eacute;,<br>
Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abb&eacute;,<br>
Sans orgue r&eacute;sonnante?'<br>
'Jesus touchera le clavier<br>
Des vagues mugissantes.'<br>
<br>
Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abb&eacute;,<br>
Ma Dou&eacute;,<br>
Mais comment ferez vous, l'Abb&eacute;,<br>
Si l'Ennemi nous trouble?'<br>
Une seule fois je vous b&eacute;nirai,<br>
Les Bleus b&eacute;nirai double!'</blockquote>

<p>Closing the study door behind her, Stephen thoughtfully climbed
the stairs to her bedroom.</p>

<h3><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>Chapter Thirty-three</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>With the New Year came flowers from Val&eacute;rie Seymour, and
a little letter of New Year's greeting. Then she paid a rather
ceremonious call and was entertained by Puddle and Stephen. Before
leaving she invited them both to luncheon, but Stephen refused on
the plea of her work.</p>

<p>'I'm hard at it again.'</p>

<p>At this Val&eacute;rie smiled. Very well then, a bient&ocirc;t.
You know where to find me, ring up when you're free, which I hope
will be soon.' After which she took her departure.</p>

<p>But Stephen was not to see her again for a very considerable
time, as it happened. Val&eacute;rie was also a busy
woman&mdash;there are other affairs beside the writing of
novels.</p>

<p>Brockett was in London on account of his plays. He wrote seldom,
though when he did so he was cordial, affectionate even; but now he
was busy with success, and with gathering in the shekels. He had
not lost interest in Stephen again, only just at the moment she did
not fit in with his brilliant and affluent scheme of existence.</p>

<p>So once more she and Puddle settled down together to a life that
was strangely devoid of people, a life of almost complete
isolation, and Puddle could not make up her mind whether she felt
relieved or regretful. For herself she cared nothing, her anxious
thoughts were as always centred in Stephen. However, Stephen
appeared quite contented&mdash;she was launched on her book and was
pleased with her writing. Paris inspired her to do good work, and
as recreation she now had her fencing&mdash;twice every week she
now fenced with Buisson, that severe but incomparable master.</p>

<p>Buisson had been very rude at first: 'Hideous, affreux,
horriblement English!' he had shouted, quite outraged by Stephen's
style. All the same he took a great interest in her. 'You write
books; what a pity! I could make you a fine fencer. You have the
man's muscles, and the long, graceful lunge when you do not
remember that you are a Briton and become&mdash;what you say? ah,
mais oui, self-conscious. I wish that I had find you out
sooner&mdash;however, your muscles are young still, pliant.' And
one day he said: 'Let me feel the muscles,' then proceeded to pass
his hands down her thighs and across her strong loins: Tiens,
tiens!' he murmured.</p>

<p>After this he would sometimes look at her gravely with a puzzled
expression; but she did not resent him, nor his rudeness, nor his
technical interest in her muscles. Indeed, she liked the cross
little man with his bristling black beard and his peppery temper,
and when he remarked a propos of nothing: 'We are all great
imbeciles about nature. We make our own rules and call them la
nature; we say she do this, she do that&mdash;imbeciles! She do
what she please and then make the long nose.' Stephen felt neither
shy nor resentful.</p>

<p>These lessons were a great relaxation from work, and thanks to
them her health grew much better. Her body, accustomed to severe
exercise, had resented the sedentary life in London. Now, however,
she began to take care of her health, walking for a couple of hours
in the Bois every day, or exploring the tall, narrow streets that
lay near her home in the Quarter. The sky would look bright at the
end of such streets by contrast, as though it were seen through a
tunnel. Sometimes she would stand gazing into the shops of the
wider and more prosperous Rue des Saints P&egrave;res; the old
furniture shops; the crucifix shop with its dozens of crucified
Christs in the window&mdash;so many crucified ivory Christs! She
would think that one must surely exist for every sin committed in
Paris. Or perhaps she would make her way over the river, crossing
by the Pont des Arts. And one morning, arrived at the Rue des
Petits Champs, what must she suddenly do but discover the Passage
Choiseul, by just stepping inside for shelter, because it had
started raining.</p>

<p>Oh, the lure of the Passage Choiseul, the queer, rather gawky
attraction of it. Surely the most hideous place in all Paris, with
its roof of stark wooden ribs and glass panes&mdash;the roof that
looks like the vertebral column of some prehistoric monster. The
chocolate smell of the patisserie&mdash;the big one where people go
who have money. The humbler, student smell of Lavrut, where one's
grey rubber bands are sold by the gramme and are known as:
'Bracelets de caoutchouc.' Where one buys premi&egrave;re
qualit&eacute; blotting paper of a deep ruddy tint and the
stiffness of cardboard, and thin but inspiring manuscript books
bound in black, with mottled, shiny blue borders. Where pencils and
pens are found in their legions, of all makes, all shapes, all
colours, all prices; while outside on the trustful trays in the
Passage, lives Gomme Onyx, masquerading as marble, and as likely to
rub a hole in your paper. For those who prefer the reading of books
to the writing of them there is always Lemerre with his splendid
display of yellow bindings. And for those undisturbed by
imagination, the taxidermist's shop is quite near the
corner&mdash;they can stare at a sad and moth-eaten flamingo, two
squirrels, three parrots and a dusty canary. Some are tempted by
the cheap corduroy at the draper's, where it stands in great rolls
as though it were carpet. Some pass on to the little stamp
merchant, while a few dauntless souls even enter the
chemist's&mdash;that shamelessly anatomical chemist's, whose wares
do not figure in school manuals on the practical uses of
rubber.</p>

<p>And up and down this Passage Choiseul, pass innumerable idle and
busy people, bringing in mud and rain in the winter, bringing in
dust and heat in the summer, bringing in God knows how many
thoughts, some of which cannot escape with their owners. The very
air of the Passage seems heavy with all these imprisoned
thoughts.</p>

<p>Stephen's thoughts got themselves entrapped with the others, but
hers, at the moment, were those of a schoolgirl, for her eye had
suddenly lit on Lavrut, drawn thereto by the trays of ornate
india-rubber. And once inside, she could not resist the 'Bracelets
de caoutchouc,' or the blotting paper as red as a rose, or the
manuscript books with the mottled blue borders. Growing reckless,
she gave an enormous order for the simple reason that these things
looked different. In the end she actually carried away one of those
inspiring manuscript books, and then got herself driven home by a
taxi, in order the sooner to fill it.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>That spring, in the foyer of the Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise, Stephen stumbled across a link with the past in
the person of a middle-aged woman. The woman was stout and wore
pince-nez; her sparse brown hair was already greying; her face,
which was long, had a double chin, and that face seemed vaguely
familiar to Stephen. Then suddenly Stephen's two hands were seized
and held fast in those of the middle-aged woman, while a voice
grown loud with delight and emotion was saying: 'Mais oui, c'est ma
petite St&eacute;venne!'</p>

<p>Back came a picture of the schoolroom at Morton, with a battered
red book on its ink-stained table&mdash;the Biblioth&eacute;que
Rose&mdash;'Les Petites Files Modeles', 'Les Bons Enfants', and
Mademoiselle Duphot.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'To think&mdash;after all these years!'</p>

<p>Ah, quelle joie! Quelle joie!' babbled Mademoiselle Duphot.</p>

<p>And now Stephen was being embraced on both cheeks, then held at
arm's length for a better inspection. 'But how tall, how strong you
are, ma petite St&eacute;venne. You remember what I say, that we
meet in Paris? I say when I go, "But you come to Paris when you
grow up bigger, my poor little baby!" I keep looking and looking,
but I knowed you at once. I say, "Oui certainement, that is ma
petite St&eacute;venne, no one 'ave such another face what I love,
it could only belong to St&eacute;venne," I say. And now voila! I
am correct and I find you.'</p>

<p>Stephen released herself firmly but gently, replying in French
to calm Mademoiselle, whose linguistic struggles increased every
moment.</p>

<p>'I'm living in Paris altogether,' she told her; 'you must come
and see me&mdash;come to dinner tomorrow; 35, Rue Jacob.' Then she
introduced Puddle who had been an amused spectator.</p>

<p>The two ex-guardians of Stephen's young mind shook hands with
each other very politely, and they made such a strangely contrasted
couple that Stephen must smile to see them together. The one was so
small, so quiet, and so English; the other so portly, so tearful,
so French in her generous, if somewhat embarrassing emotion.</p>

<p>As Mademoiselle regained her composure, Stephen was able to
observe her more closely, and she saw that her face was excessively
childish&mdash;a fact which she, when a child, had not noticed. It
was more the face of a foal than a horse&mdash;an innocent,
new-born foal.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle said rather wistfully: 'I will dine with much
pleasure tomorrow evening, but when will you come and see me in my
home? It is in the Avenue de la Grande Arm&eacute;e, a small
apartment, very small but so pretty&mdash;it is pleasant to have
one's treasures around one. The bon Dieu has been very good to me,
St&eacute;venne, for my Aunt Clothilde left me a little money when
she died; it has proved a great consolation.'</p>

<p>'I'll come very soon,' promised Stephen.</p>

<p>Then Mademoiselle spoke at great length of her aunt, and of
Maman who had also passed on into glory; Maman, who had had her
chicken on Sunday right up to the very last moment, Dieu merci!
Even when her teeth had grown loose in the gums, Maman had asked
for her chicken on Sunday. But alas, the poor sister who once made
little bags out of beads for the shops in the Rue de la Paix, and
who had such a cruel and improvident husband&mdash;the poor sister
had now become totally blind, and therefore dependent on
Mademoiselle Duphot. So after all Mademoiselle Duphot still worked,
giving lessons in French to the resident English; and sometimes she
taught the American children who were visiting Paris with their
parents. But then it was really far better to work; one might grow
too fat if one remained idle.</p>

<p>She beamed at Stephen with her gentle brown eyes. 'They are not
as you were, ma ch&egrave;re petite St&eacute;venne, not clever and
full of intelligence, no; and at times I almost despair of their
accent. However, I am not at all to be pitied, thanks to Aunt
Clothilde and the good little saints who surely inspired her to
leave me that money.'</p>

<p>When Stephen and Puddle returned to their stalls, Mademoiselle
climbed to a humbler seat somewhere under the roof, and as she
departed she waved her plump hand at Stephen.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'She's so changed that I didn't know her just at
first, or else perhaps I'd forgotten. I felt terribly guilty,
because after you came I don't think I ever answered her letters.
It's thirteen years since she left...</p>

<p>Puddle nodded. 'Yes, it's thirteen years since I took her place
and forced you to tidy that abominable schoolroom!' And she
laughed. All the same, I like her,' said Puddle.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duphot admired the house in the Rue Jacob and she
ate very largely of the rich and excellent dinner. Quite regardless
of her increasing proportions, she seemed drawn to all those things
that were fattening.</p>

<p>'I cannot resist,' she remarked with a smile, as she reached for
her fifth marron glace.</p>

<p>They talked a Paris, of its beauty, its charm. Then Mademoiselle
spoke yet again of her Maman and of Aunt Clothilde who had left
them the money, and of Julie, her blind sister.</p>

<p>But after the meal she quite suddenly blushed. 'Oh,
St&eacute;venne, I have never inquired for your parents! What must
you think of such great impoliteness? I lose my head the moment I
see you and grow selfish. I want you to know about me and my Maman;
I babble about my affairs. What must you think of such great
impoliteness? How is that kind and handsome Sir Philip? And your
mother, my dear, how is Lady Anna?'</p>

<p>And now it was Stephen's turn to grow red. 'My father died...She
hesitated, then finished abruptly, 'I don't live with my mother any
more, I don't live at Morton.'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle gasped. 'You no longer live...' she began, then
something in Stephen's face warned her kind but bewildered guest
not to question. 'I am deeply grieved to hear of your father's
death, my dear,' she said very gently.</p>

<p>Stephen answered: 'Yes&mdash;I shall always miss him.'</p>

<p>There ensued a long, rather painful silence, during which
Mademoiselle Duphot felt awkward. What had happened between the
mother and daughter? It was all very strange, very disconcerting.
And Stephen, why was she exiled from Morton? But Mademoiselle could
not cope with these problems, she knew only that she wanted Stephen
to be happy, and her kind brown eyes grew anxious, for she did not
feel certain that Stephen was happy. Yet she dared not ask for an
explanation, so instead she clumsily changed the subject.</p>

<p>'When will you both come to tea with me, St&eacute;venne?'</p>

<p>'We'll come tomorrow if you like,' Stephen told her.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duphot left rather early; and all the way home to
her apartment her mind felt exercised about Stephen.</p>

<p>She thought: She was always a strange little child, but so dear.
I remember her when she was little, riding her pony astride like a
boy; and how proud he would seem, that handsome Sir
Philip&mdash;they would look more like father and son, those two.
And now&mdash;is she not still a little bit strange?'</p>

<p>But these thoughts led her nowhere for, Mademoiselle Duphot was
quite unacquainted with the bypaths of nature. Her innocent mind
was untutored and trustful; she believed in the legend of Adam and
Eve, and no careless mistakes had been made in their garden!</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>The apartment in the Avenue de la Grande Arm&eacute;e was as
tidy as Val&eacute;rie's had been untidy. From the miniature
kitchen to the miniature salon, everything shone as though recently
polished, for here in spite of restricted finances, no dust was
allowed to harbour.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duphot beamed on her guests as she herself opened
the door to admit them. 'For me this is very real joy,' she
declared. Then she introduced them to her sister Julie, whose eyes
were hidden behind dark glasses.</p>

<p>The salon was literally stuffed with what Mademoiselle had
described as her 'treasures'. On its tables were innumerable
useless objects which appeared for the most part to be mementoes.
Coloured prints of Bouguereaus hung on the walls, while the chairs
were upholstered in a species of velvet so hard as to be rather
slippery to sit on, yet that when it was touched felt rough to the
fingers. The woodwork of these inhospitable chairs had been coated
with varnish until it looked sticky. Over the little inadequate
fireplace smiled a portrait of Maman when she was quite young.
Maman, dressed in tartan for some strange reason, but in tartan
that had never hob-nobbed with the Highlands&mdash;a present this
portrait had been from a cousin who had wished to become an
artist.</p>

<p>Julie extended a white, groping hand. She was like her sister
only very much thinner, and her face had the closed rather blank
expression that is sometimes associated with blindness.</p>

<p>'Which is St&eacute;venne?' she inquired in an anxious voice; 'I
have heard so much about St&eacute;venne!'</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'Here I am,' and she grasped the hand, pitiful of
this woman's affliction.</p>

<p>But Julie smiled broadly. 'Yes, I know it is you from the
feel,'&mdash;she had started to stroke Stephen's
coat-sleeve&mdash;'my eyes have gone into my fingers these days. It
is strange, but I seem to see through my forgers.' Then she turned
and found Puddle whom she also stroked. 'And now I know both of
you,' declared Julie.</p>

<p>The tea when it came was that straw-coloured liquid which may
even now be met with in Paris.</p>

<p>'English tea bought especially for you, my St&eacute;venne,'
remarked Mademoiselle proudly. 'We drink only coffee, but I said to
my sister, St&eacute;venne likes the good tea, and so, no doubt,
does Mademoiselle Puddle. At four o'clock they will not want
coffee&mdash;you observe how well I remember your England!'</p>

<p>However, the cakes proved worthy of France, and Mademoiselle ate
them as though she enjoyed them. Julie ate very little and did not
talk much. She just sat there and listened, quietly smiling; and
while she listened she crocheted lace as though, as she said, she
could see through her fingers. Then Mademoiselle Duphot explained
how it was that those delicate hands had becomes so skilful,
replacing the eyes which their ceaseless labour had robbed of the
bless&egrave;d privilege of sight&mdash;explained so simply yet
with such conviction, that Stephen must marvel to hear her.</p>

<p>'It is all our little Ther&egrave;se,' she told Stephen. 'You
have heard of her? Ah, but what a pity! Our Ther&egrave;se was a
nun at the Cannel at Lisieux, and she said: "I will let fall a
shower of roses when I die." She died not so long ago, but already
her Cause has been presented at Rome by the Very Reverend Father
Rodrigo! That is very wonderful, is it not, St&eacute;venne? But
she does not wait to become a saint; ah, but no, she is young and
therefore impatient. She cannot wait, she has started already to do
miracles for all those who ask her. I asked that Julie should not
be unhappy through the loss of her eyes&mdash;for when she is idle
she is always unhappy&mdash;so our little Ther&egrave;se has put a
pair of new eyes in her fingers.'</p>

<p>Julie nodded. 'It is true,' she said very gravely; 'before that
I was stupid because of my blindness. Everything felt very strange,
and I stumbled about like an old blind horse. I was terribly
stupid, far more so than many. Then one night V&eacute;ronique
asked Ther&egrave;se to help me, and the next day I could find my
way round our room. From then on my fingers saw what they touched,
and now I can even make lace quite well because of this sight in my
fingers.' Then turning to the smiling Mademoiselle Duphot: 'But why
do you not show her picture to St&eacute;venne?</p>

<p>So Mademoiselle Duphot went and fetched the small picture of
Ther&egrave;se, which Stephen duly examined, and the face that she
saw was ridiculously youthful&mdash;round with youth it still was,
and yet very determined. Seem Ther&egrave;se looked as though if
she really intended to become a saint, the devil himself would be
hard put to it to stop her. Then Puddle must also examine the
picture, while Stephen was shown some relics, a piece of the habit
and other things such as collect in the wake of sainthood.</p>

<p>When they left, Julie asked them to come again; she said: 'Come
often, it will give us such pleasure.' Then she thrust on her
guests twelve yards of coarse lace which neither of them liked to
offer to pay for.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle murmured: 'Our home is so humble for
St&eacute;venne; we have very little to offer.' She was thinking of
the house in the Rue Jacob, a grand house, and then too she
remembered Morton.</p>

<p>But Julie, with the strange insight of the blind, or perhaps
because of those eyes in her fingers, answered quickly: 'She will
not care, V&eacute;ronique, I cannot feel that sort of pride in
your St&eacute;venne.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>After their first visit they went very often to Mademoiselle's
modest little apartment, Mademoiselle Duphot and her quiet blind
sister were indeed their only friends now in Paris, for Brockett
was in America on business, and Stephen had not rung up
Val&eacute;rie Seymour.</p>

<p>Sometimes when Stephen was busy with her work, Puddle would make
her way there all alone. Then she and Mademoiselle would get
talking about Stephen's childhood, about her future, but guardedly,
for Puddle must be careful to give nothing away to the kind, simple
woman. As for Mademoiselle, she too must be careful to accept all
and ask no questions. Yet in spite of the inevitable gaps and
restraints, a real sympathy sprang up between them, for each sensed
in the other a valuable ally who would fight a good fight on behalf
of Stephen. And now Stephen would quite often send her car to take
the blind Julie for a drive beyond Paris, Julie would sniff the air
and tell Burton that through smelling their greenness she could see
the trees; he would listen to her broken and halting English with a
smile&mdash;they were a queer lot these French. Or perhaps he would
drive the other Mademoiselle up to Montmartre for early Mass on a
Sunday. She belonged to something to do with a heart; it all seemed
rather uncanny to Burton. He thought of the Vicar who had played
such fine cricket, and suddenly felt very homesick for Morton.
Fruit would find its way to the little apartment, together with
cakes and large marron glac&eacute;s. Then Mademoiselle Duphot
would become frankly greedy, eating sweets in bed while she studied
her booklets on the holy and very austere Th&eacute;r&egrave;se,
who had certainly not eaten marrons glac&eacute;s.</p>

<p>'Thus the spring, that gentle yet fateful spring of 1914,
slipped into the summer. With the budding of flowers and the
singing of birds it slipped quietly on towards great disaster;
while Stephen, whose book was now nearing completion, worked harder
than ever in Paris.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter Thirty-four</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>War. The incredible yet long predicted had come to pass. People
woke in the morning with a sense of disaster, but these were the
old who, having known war, remembered. The young men of France, of
Germany, of Russia, of the whole world, looked round them amazed
and bewildered; yet with something that stung as it leapt in their
veins, filling them with a strange excitement&mdash;the bitter and
ruthless potion of war that spurred and lashed at their
manhood.</p>

<p>They hurried through the streets of Paris, these young men; they
collected in bars and cafes; they stood gaping at the ominous
government placards summoning their youth and strength to the
colours.</p>

<p>They talked fast, very fast, they gesticulated: 'C'est la
guerre! C'est la guerre!' they kept repeating.</p>

<p>Then they answered each other: 'Oui, c'est la guerre.'</p>

<p>And true to her traditions the beautiful city sought to hide
stark ugliness under beauty, and she decked herself as though for a
wedding; her flags streamed out on the breeze in their thousands.
With the paraphernalia and pageantry of glory she sought to
disguise the true meaning of war.</p>

<p>But where children had been playing a few days before, troops
were now encamped along the Champs Elys&eacute;es. Their horses
nibbled the bark from the trees and pawed at the earth, making
little hollows; they neighed to each other in the watches of the
night, as though in some fearful anticipation. In by-streets the
unreasoning spirit of war broke loose in angry and futile actions;
shops were raided because of their German names and their wares
hurled out to lie in the gutters. Around every street corner some
imaginary spy must be lurking, until people tilted at shadows.</p>

<p>'C'est la guerre,' murmured women, thinking of their sons.</p>

<p>Then they answered each other: 'Oui, c'est la guerre.'</p>

<p>Pierre said to Stephen: 'They will not take me because of my
heart!' And his voice shook with anger, and the anger brought tears
which actually splashed the jaunty stripes of his livery
waistcoat.</p>

<p>Pauline said: 'I gave my father to the sea and my eldest
brother. I have still two young brothers, they alone are left and I
give them to France. Bon Dieu! It is terrible being a woman, one
gives all!' But Stephen knew from her voice that Pauline felt proud
of being a woman.</p>

<p>Ad&egrave;le said: 'Jean is certain to get promotion, he says
so, he will not long remain a Poilu. When he comes back he may be a
captain&mdash;that will be fine. I shall marry a captain! War, he
says, is better than piano-tuning, though I tell him he has a fine
ear for music. But Mademoiselle should just see him now in his
uniform! We all think he looks splendid.'</p>

<p>Puddle said: 'Of course England was bound to come in, and thank
God we didn't take too long about it!'</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'All the young men from Morton will go&mdash;every
decent man in the country will go.' Then she put away her
unfinished novel and sat staring dumbly at Puddle.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>England, the land of bountiful pastures, of peace, of mothering
hills, of home. England was fighting for her right to existence.
Face to face with dreadful reality at last, England was pouring her
men into battle, her army was even now marching across France.
Tramp, tramp; tramp, tramp; the tread of England whose men would
defend her right to existence.</p>

<p>Anna wrote from Morton. She wrote to Puddle, but now Stephen
took those letters and read them. The agent had enlisted and so had
the bailiff Old Mr. Percival, agent in Sir Philip's lifetime, had
come back to help with Morton. Jim the groom, who had stayed on
under the coachman after Raftery's death, was now talking of going;
he wanted to get into the cavalry, of course, and Anna was using
her influence for him. Six of the gardeners had joined up already,
but Hopkins was past the prescribed age limit; he must do his small
bit by looking after his grape vines&mdash;the grapes would be sent
to the wounded in London. There were now no men-servants left in
the house, and the home farm was short of a couple of hands. Anna
wrote that she was proud of her people, and intended to pay those
who had enlisted half wages. They would fight for England, but she
could not help feeling that in a way they would be fighting for
Morton. She had offered Morton to the Red Cross at once, and they
had promised to send her convalescent cases. It was rather isolated
for a hospital, it seemed, but would be just the place for
convalescents. The Vicar was going as an army chaplain; Violet's
husband, Alec, had joined the Flying Corps; Roger Antrim was
somewhere in France already; Colonel Antrim had a job at the
barracks in Worcester.</p>

<p>Came an angry scrawl from Jonathan Brockett, who had rushed back
to England post-haste from the States: 'Did you ever know anything
quite so stupid as this war? It's upset my apple-cart
completely&mdash;can't write jingo plays about St. George and the
dragon, and I'm sick to death of "Business as usual!" Ain't going
to be no business, my dear, except killing, and blood always makes
me feel faint.' Then the postscript: 'I've just been and gone and
done it! Please send me tuck-boxes when I'm sitting in a trench; I
like caramel creams and of course mixed biscuits.' Yes, even
Jonathan Brockett would go&mdash;it was fine in a way that he
should have enlisted.</p>

<p>Morton was pouring out its young men, who in their turn might
pour out their life-blood for Morton. The agent, the bailiff; in
training already. Jim the groom, inarticulate, rather stupid, but
wanting to join the cavalry&mdash;Jim who had been at Morton since
boyhood. The gardeners, kindly men smelling of soil, men of peace
with a peaceful occupation; six of these gardeners had gone
already, together with a couple of lads from the home farm. There
were no men servants left in the house. It seemed that the old
traditions still held, the traditions of England, the traditions of
Morton.</p>

<p>The Vicar would soon play a sterner game than cricket, while
Alec must put away his law books and take unto himself a pair of
wings&mdash;funny to associate wings with Alec. Colonel Antrim had
hastily got into khaki, and was cursing and swearing, no doubt, at
the barracks. And Roger&mdash;Roger was somewhere in France
already, justifying his manhood. Roger Antrim, who had been so
intolerably proud of that manhood&mdash;well, now he would get a
chance to prove it!</p>

<p>But Jonathan Brockett, with the soft white hands, and the
foolish gestures, and the high little laugh&mdash;even he could
justify his existence, for they had not refused 'him when he went
to enlist. Stephen had never thought to feel envious of a man like
Jonathan Brockett.</p>

<p>She sat smoking, with his letter spread out before her on the
desk, his absurd yet courageous letter, and somehow it humbled her
pride to the dust, for she could not so justify her existence.
Every instinct handed down by the men of her race, every decent
instinct of courage, now rose to mock her so that all that was male
in her make-up seemed to grow more aggressive, aggressive perhaps
as never before, because of this new frustration. She felt appalled
at the realization of her own grotesqueness; she was nothing but a
freak abandoned on a kind of no-man's-land at this moment of
splendid national endeavour. England was calling her men into
battle, her women to the bedsides of the wounded and dying, and
between these two chivalrous, surging forces she, Stephen, might
well be crushed out of existence&mdash;of less use to her country,
she was, than Brockett. She stared at her bony masculine hands,
they had never been skilful when it came to illness; strong they
might be, but rather inept; not hands wherewith to succour the
wounded. No, assuredly her job, if job she could find, would not
lie at the bedsides of the wounded. And yet, good God, one must do
something!</p>

<p>Going to the door she called in the servants: 'I'm leaving for
England in a few days,' she told them, 'and while I'm away you'll
take care of this house. I have absolute confidence in you.'</p>

<p>Pierre said: 'All things shall be done as you would wish,
Mademoiselle.' And she knew that it would be so.</p>

<p>That evening she told Puddle of her decision, and Puddle's face
brightened: 'I'm so glad, my dear, when war comes one ought to
stand by one's country.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid they won't want my sort...' Stephen muttered.</p>

<p>Puddle put a firm little hand over hers: 'I wouldn't be too sure
of that, this war may give your sort of woman her chance. I think
you may find that they'll need you, Stephen.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>There were no farewells to be said in Paris except those to
Buisson and Mademoiselle Duphot.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duphot shed a few tears: 'I find you only to lose
you, St&eacute;venne. Ah, but how many friends will be parted,
perhaps for ever, by this terrible war&mdash;and yet what else
could we do? We are blameless!'</p>

<p>In Berlin people were also saying: 'What else could we do? We
are blameless.'</p>

<p>Julie's hand lingered on Stephen's arm: 'You feel so strong,'
she said, sighing a little, 'it is good to be strong and courageous
these days, and to have one's eyes&mdash;alas, I am quite
useless.'</p>

<p>'No one is useless who can pray, my sister,' reproved
Mademoiselle almost sternly.</p>

<p>And indeed there were many who thought as she did, the churches
were crowded all over France. A great wave of piety swept through
Paris, filling the dark confessional boxes, so that the priests had
now some ado to cope with such shoals of penitent people&mdash;the
more so as every priest fit to fight had been summoned to join the
army. Up at Montmartre the church of the Sacr&eacute; Coeur echoed
and re-echoed with the prayers of the faithful, while those prayers
that were whispered with tears in secret, hung like invisible
clouds round its altars.</p>

<p>'Save us, most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Have pity upon us, have
pity upon France. Save us, O Heart of Jesus!'</p>

<p>So all day long must the priests sit and hear the time-honoured
sins of body and spirit; a monotonous hearing because of its
sameness since nothing is really new under the sun, least of all
our manner of sinning. Men who had not been to Mass for years, now
began to remember their first Communion; thus it was that many a
hardy blasphemer, grown suddenly tongue-tied and rather sheepish,
clumped up to the altar in his new army boots, having made an
embarrassed confession.</p>

<p>Young clericals changed into uniform and marched side by side
with the roughest Poilus, to share in their hardships, their hopes,
their terrors, their deeds of supremest valour. Old men bowed their
heads and gave of the strength which no longer animated their
bodies, gave of that strength through the bodies of their sons who
would charge into battle shouting and singing. Women of all ages
knelt down and prayed, since prayer has long been the refuge of
women. 'No one is useless who can pray, my sister.' The women of
France had spoken through the lips of the humble Mademoiselle
Duphot.</p>

<p>Stephen and Puddle said good-bye to the sisters, then went on to
Buisson's Academy of Fencing, where they found him engaged upon
greasing his foils.</p>

<p>He looked up, Ah, it's you. I must go on greasing. God knows
when I shall use these again, tomorrow I join my regiment.' But he
wiped his hands on a stained overall and sat down, after clearing a
chair for Puddle. 'An ungentlemanly war it will be,' he grumbled.
Will I lead my men with a sword? Ah, but no! I will lead my men
with a dirty revolver in my hand. Parbleu! Such is modern warfare!
A machine could do the whole cursed thing better&mdash;we shall all
be nothing but machines in this war. However, I pray that we may
kill many Germans.'</p>

<p>Stephen lit a cigarette while the master glared, he was
evidently in a very vile temper: 'Go on, go on, smoke your heart to
the devil, then come here and ask me to teach you fencing! You
smoke in lighting one from the other, you remind me of your
horrible Birmingham chimneys&mdash;but of course a woman
exaggerates always,' he concluded, with an evident wish to annoy
her.</p>

<p>Then he made a few really enlightening remarks about Germans in
general, their appearance, their morals, above all their personal
habits&mdash;which remarks were more seemly in French than they
would be in English. For, like Val&eacute;rie Seymour, this man was
filled with a loathing for the ugliness of his epoch, an ugliness
to which he felt the Germans were just now doing their best to
contribute. Buisson's heart was not buried in Mitylene, but rather
in the glories of a bygone Paris, where a gentleman lived by the
skill of his rapier and the graceful courage that lay behind
it.</p>

<p>'In the old days we killed very beautifully,' sighed Buisson,
'now we merely slaughter or else do not kill at all, no matter how
gross the insult.'</p>

<p>However, when they got up to go, he relented: 'War is surely a
very necessary evil, it thins down the imbecile populations who
have murdered their most efficacious microbes. People will not die,
very well, here comes war to mow them down in their tens of
thousands. At least for those of us who survive, there will be more
breathing-space, thanks to the Germans&mdash;perhaps they too are a
necessary evil.'</p>

<p>Arrived at the door Stephen turned to look back. Buisson was
once more greasing his foils, and his fingers moved slowly yet with
great precision&mdash;he might almost have been a beauty doctor
engaged upon massaging ladies' faces.</p>

<p>Preparations for departure did not take very long, and in less
than a week's time Stephen and Puddle had shaken hands with their
Breton servants and were driving at top speed en route for Havre,
from whence they would cross to England.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Puddle's prophecy proved to have been correct, work was very
soon forthcoming for Stephen. She joined The London Ambulance
Column, which was well under way by that autumn; and presently
Puddle herself got a job in one of the Government departments. She
and Stephen had taken a small service flat in Victoria, and here
they would meet when released from their hours of duty. But Stephen
was obsessed by her one idea, which was, willy-nilly, to get out to
the front, and many and varied were the plans and discussions that
were listened to by the sympathetic Puddle. An ambulance had
managed to slip over to Belgium for a while and had done some very
fine service. Stephen had hit on a similar idea, but in her case
the influence required had been lacking. In vain did she offer to
form a Unit at her own expense; the reply was polite but always the
same, a monotonous reply: England did not send women to the
front-line trenches. She disliked the idea of joining the throng
who tormented the patient passport officials with demands to be
sent to France at once, on no matter how insufficient a pretext.
What was the use of her going to France unless she could find there
the work that she wanted? She preferred to stick to her job in
England.</p>

<p>And now quite often while she waited at the stations for the
wounded, she would see unmistakable figures&mdash;unmistakable to
her they would be at first sight, she would single them out of the
crowd as by instinct. For as though gaining courage from the terror
that is war, many a one who was even as Stephen, had crept out of
her hole and come into the daylight, come into the daylight and
faced her country: 'Well, here I am, will you take me or leave me?'
And England had taken her, asking no questions&mdash;she was strong
and efficient, she could fill a man's place, she could organize
too, given scope for her talent. England had said: 'Thank you very
much. You're just what we happen to want...at the moment.'</p>

<p>So, side by side with more fortunate women, worked Miss Smith
who had been breeding dogs in the country; or Miss Oliphant who had
been breeding nothing since birth but a litter of hefty complexes;
or Miss Tring who had lived with a very dear friend in the humbler
purlieus of Chelsea. One great weakness they all had, it must be
admitted, and this was for uniforms&mdash;yet why not? The good
workman is worthy of his Sam Browne belt. And then too, their
nerves were not at all weak, their pulses beat placidly through the
worst air raids, for bombs do not trouble the nerves of the invert,
but rather that terrible silent bombardment from the batteries of
God's good people.</p>

<p>Yet now even really nice women with hairpins often found their
less orthodox sisters quite useful. It would be: 'Miss Smith, do
just start up my motor&mdash;the engine's so cold I can't get the
thing going'; or: 'Miss Oliphant, do glance through these accounts,
I've got such a rotten bad head for figures'; or 'Miss Tring, may I
borrow your British Warm? The office is simply arctic this
morning!'</p>

<p>Not that those purely feminine women were less worthy of praise,
perhaps they were more so, giving as they did of their best without
stint&mdash;for they had no stigma to live down in the war, no need
to defend their right to respect. They rallied to the call of their
country superbly, and may it not be forgotten by England. But the
others&mdash;since they too gave of their best, may they also not
be forgotten. They might look a bit odd, indeed some of them did,
and yet in the streets they were seldom stared at, though they
strode a little, perhaps from shyness, or perhaps from a slightly
self-conscious desire to show off, which is often the same thing as
shyness. They were part of the universal convulsion and were being
accepted as such, on their merits. And although their Sam Browne
belts remained swordless, their hats and their caps without
regimental badges, a battalion was formed in those terrible years
that would never again be completely disbanded. War and death had
given them a right to life, and life tasted sweet, very sweet to
their palates. Later on would come bitterness, disillusion, but
never again would such women submit to being driven back to their
holes and corners. They had found themselves&mdash;thus the
whirligig of war brings in its abrupt revenges.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Time passed; the first year of hostilities became the second
while Stephen still hoped, though no nearer to her ambition. Try as
she might she could not get to the front; no work at the actual
front seemed to be forthcoming for women.</p>

<p>Brockett wrote wonderfully cheerful letters. In every letter was
a neat little list telling Stephen what he wished her to send him;
but the sweets he loved were getting quite scarce, they were no
longer always so easy to come by. And now he was asking for
Houbigant soap to be included in his tuck-box.</p>

<p>'Don't let it get near the coffee fondants or it may make them
taste like it smells,' he cautioned, 'and do try to send me two
bottles of hair-wash, "Eau Ath&eacute;nienne", I used to buy it at
Truefitt's.' He was on a perfectly damnable front, they had sent
him to Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Violet Peacock, who was now a V.A.D. with a very imposing Red
Cross on her apron, occasionally managed to catch Stephen at home,
and then would come reams of tiresome gossip. Sometimes she would
bring her over-fed children along, she was stuffing them up like
capons. By fair means or foul Violet always managed to obtain
illicit cream for her nursery&mdash;she was one of those mothers
who reacted to the war by wishing to kill off the useless aged.</p>

<p>'What's the good of them? Eating up the food of the nation!' she
would say, 'I'm going all out on the young, they'll be needed to
breed from.' She was very extreme, her perspective had been upset
by the air raids.</p>

<p>Raids frightened her as did the thought of starvation, and when
frightened she was apt to grow rather sadistic, so that now she
would want to rush off and inspect every ruin left by the German
marauders. She had also been the first to applaud the dreadful
descent of a burning Zeppelin.</p>

<p>She bored Stephen intensely with her ceaseless prattle about
Alec, who was one of London's defenders, about Roger, who had got
the Military Cross and was just on the eve of becoming a major,
about the wounded whose faces she sponged every morning, and who
seemed so pathetically grateful.</p>

<p>From Morton came occasional letters for Puddle; they were more
in the nature of reports now these letters. Anna had such and such
a number of cases; the gardeners had been replaced by young women;
Mr. Percival was proving very devoted, he and Anna were holding the
estate well together; Williams had been seriously ill with
pneumonia. Then a long list of humble names from the farms, from
among Anna's staff or from cottage homesteads, together with those
from such houses as Morton&mdash;for the rich and the poor were in
death united. Stephen would read that long list of names, so many
of which she had known since her childhood, and would realize that
the stark arm of war had struck deep at the quiet heart of the
Midlands.</p>

<h2>BOOK FOUR</h2>

<h3><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>Chapter Thirty-five</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>A stump of candle in the neck of a bottle flickered once or
twice and threatened to go out. Getting up, Stephen found a fresh
candle and lit it, then she returned to her packing-case upon which
had been placed the remnants of a chair minus its legs and
arms.</p>

<p>The room had once been the much prized salon of a large and
prosperous villa in Compi&egrave;gne, but now the glass was gone
from its windows; there remained only battered and splintered
shutters which creaked eerily in the bitter wind of a March night
in 1918. The walls of the salon had fared little better than its
windows, their brocade was detached and hanging, while a recent
rainstorm had lashed through the roof making ugly splotches on the
delicate fabric&mdash;a dark stain on the ceiling was perpetually
dripping. The remnants of what had once been a home, little broken
tables, an old photograph in a tarnished frame, a child's wooden
horse, added to the infinite desolation of this villa that now
housed the Breakspeare Unit&mdash;a Unit composed of Englishwomen,
that had been serving in France just over six months, attached to
the French Army Ambulance Corps.</p>

<p>The place seemed full of grotesquely large shadows cast by
figures that sat or sprawled on the floor. Miss Peel in her Jaeger
sleeping-bag snored loudly, then choked because of her cold. Miss
Delm&eacute;-Howard was gravely engaged upon making the best of a
difficult toilet&mdash;she was brushing out her magnificent hair
which gleamed in the light of the candle. Miss Bless was sewing a
button on her tunic; Miss Thurloe was peering at a half-finished
letter; but most of the women who were herded together in this, the
safest place in the villa and none too safe at that be it said,
were apparently sleeping quite soundly. An uncanny stillness had
descended on the town; after many hours of intensive bombardment,
the Germans were having a breathing-space before training their
batteries once more upon Compi&egrave;gne.</p>

<p>Stephen stared down at the girl who lay curled up at her feet in
an army blanket. The girl slept the sleep of complete exhaustion,
breathing heavily with her head on her arm; her pale and rather
triangular face was that of someone who was still very young, not
much more than nineteen or twenty. The pallor of her skin was
accentuated by the short black lashes which curled back abruptly,
by the black arched eyebrows and dark brown hair&mdash;sleek hair
which grew to a peak on the forehead, and had recently been bobbed
for the sake of convenience. For the rest her nose was slightly
tip-tilted, and her mouth resolute considering her youth; the lips
were well-modelled and fine in texture, having deeply indented
corners. For more than a minute Stephen considered the immature
figure of Mary Llewellyn. This latest recruit to the Breakspeare
Unit had joined it only five weeks ago, replacing a member who was
suffering from shell-shock. Mrs. Breakspeare had shaken her head
over Mary, but in these harassed days of the German offensive she
could not afford to remain shorthanded, so in spite of many
misgivings she had kept her.</p>

<p>Still shaking her head she had said to Stephen: 'Needs must when
the Boches get busy, Miss Gordon! Have an eye to her, will your She
may stick it all right, but between you and me I very much doubt
it. You might try her out as your second driver.' And so far Mary
Llewellyn had stuck it.</p>

<p>Stephen looked away again, dosing her eyes, and after a while
forgot about Mary. The events that had preceded her own coming to
France began to pass through her brain in procession. Her chief in
The London Ambulance Column, through whom she had first met Mrs.
Claude Breakspeare&mdash;a good sort, the chief, she had been a
staunch friend. The great news that she, Stephen, had been accepted
and would go to the front as an ambulance driver. Then Puddle's
grave face: 'I must write to your mother, this means that you will
be in real danger.' Her mother's brief letter: 'Before you leave I
should very much like you to come and see me,' the rest of the
letter mere polite empty phrases. The impulse to resist, the
longing to go, culminating in that hurried visit to Morton. Morton
so changed and yet so changeless. Changed because of those
blue-clad figures, the lame, the halt and the partially blinded who
had sought its peace and its kindly protection. Changeless because
that protection and peace belonged to the very spirit of Morton.
Mrs. Williams a widow; her niece melancholic ever since the groom
Jim had been wounded and missing&mdash;they had married while he
had been home on leave, and quite soon the poor soul was expecting
a baby. Williams now dead of his third and last stroke, after
having survived pneumonia. The swan called Peter no longer gliding
across the lake on his white reflection, and in his stead an
unmannerly offspring who struck out with his wings and tried to
bite Stephen. The family vault where her father lay
buried&mdash;the vault was in urgent need of repair&mdash;' No men
left, Miss Stephen, we're that short of stonemasons; her ladyship's
bin complainin' already, but it don't be no use complainin' these
times.' Raftery's grave a slab of rough granite: 'In memory of a
gentle and courageous friend, whose name was Raftery, after the
poet.' Moss on the granite half effacing the words; the thick hedge
growing wild for the want of clipping. And her mother&mdash;a woman
with snow-white hair and a face that was worn almost down to the
spirit; a woman of quiet but uncertain movements, with a new trick
of twisting the rings on her fingers. 'It was good of you to come.'
'You sent for me, Mother.' Long silences filled with the
realization that all they dared hope for was peace between
them&mdash;too late to go back&mdash;they could not retrace their
steps even though there was now peace between them. Then those last
poignant moments in the study together&mdash;memory, the old room
was haunted by it&mdash;a man dying with love in his eyes that was
deathless&mdash;a woman holding him in her arms, speaking the words
such as lovers will speak to each other. Memory&mdash;they're the
one perfect thing about me. Stephen, promise to write when you're
out in France, I shall want to hear from you.' 'I promise, Mother.'
The return to London; Puddle's anxious voice: 'Well, how was she?'
'Very frail, you must go to Morton.' Puddle's sudden and almost
fierce rebellion: 'I would rather not go, I've made my choice,
Stephen.' 'But I ask this for my sake. I'm worried about
her&mdash;even if I weren't going away, I couldn't go back now and
live at Morton&mdash;our living together would make us remember.'
'I remember, too, Stephen, and what I remember is hard to forgive.
It's hard to forgive an injury done to someone one loves...'
Puddle's face, very white, very stern&mdash;strange to hear such
words as these on the kind lips of Puddle. 'I know, I know, but
she's terribly alone, and I can't forget that my father loved her.'
A long silence, and then: 'I've never yet failed you&mdash;and
you're right&mdash;I must go to Morton.'</p>

<p>Stephen's thoughts stopped abruptly. Someone had come in and was
stumping down the room in squeaky trench boots. It was Blakeney
holding the time-sheet in her hand&mdash;funny old monosyllabic
Blakeney, with her curly white hair cropped as close as an Uhlan's,
and her face that suggested a sensitive monkey.</p>

<p>'Service, Gordon; wake the kid!
Howard&mdash;Thurloe&mdash;ready?' They got up and hustled into
their trench coats, found their gas masks and finally put on their
helmets.</p>

<p>Then Stephen shook Mary Llewellyn very gently: 'It's time.' Mary
opened her clear, grey eyes: 'Who? What?' she stammered. 'It's
time. Get up, Mary.'</p>

<p>The girl staggered to her feet, still stupid with fatigue.
Through the cracks in the shutters the dawn showed faintly.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The grey of a bitter, starved-looking morning. The town like a
mortally wounded creature, torn by shells, gashed open by bombs.
Dead streets&mdash;streets of death&mdash;death in streets and
their houses; yet people still able to sleep and still
sleeping.</p>

<p>'Stephen.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mary?'</p>

<p>'How far is the Poste?'</p>

<p>'I think about thirty kilometres; why?'</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing&mdash;I only wondered.'</p>

<p>The long stretch of an open country road. On either side of the
road wire netting hung with pieces of crudely painted rag&mdash;a
camouflage to represent leaves. A road bordered by rag leaves on
tall wire hedges. Every few yards or so a deep shell-hole.</p>

<p>'Are they following, Mary? Is Howard all right?'</p>

<p>The girl glanced back: 'Yes, it's all right, she's coming.'</p>

<p>They drove on in silence for a couple of miles. The morning was
terribly cold; Mary shivered. 'What's that?' It was rather a
foolish question for she knew what it was, knew only too well!</p>

<p>'They're at it again,' Stephen muttered.</p>

<p>A shell burst in a paddock, uprooting some trees. 'All right,
Mary?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;look out! We're coming to a crater!' They skimmed it
by less than an inch and dashed on, Mary suddenly moving nearer to
Stephen.</p>

<p>'Don't joggle my arm, for the Lord's sake, child!'</p>

<p>'Did I? I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;don't do it again,' and once more they drove forward
in silence. Farther down the road they were blocked by a farm cart:
'Militaires! Militaires! Militaires!' Stephen shouted.</p>

<p>Rather languidly the farmer got down and went to the heads of
his thin, stumbling horses. 'Il faut vivre,' he explained, as he
pointed to the cart, which appeared to be full of potatoes.</p>

<p>In a field on the right worked three very old women; they were
hoeing with a diligent and fatalistic patience. At any moment a
stray shell might burst and then, presto! little left of the very
old women. But what will you? There is war&mdash;there has been war
so long&mdash;one must eat, even under the noses of the Germans;
the bon Dieu knows this. He alone can protect&mdash;so meanwhile
one just goes on diligently hoeing. A blackbird was singing to
himself in a tree, the tree was horribly maimed and blasted; all
the same he had known it the previous spring and so now, in spite
of its wounds, he had found it. Came a sudden lull when they heard
him distinctly.</p>

<p>And Mary saw him: 'Look,' she said, 'there's a blackbird!' Just
for a moment she forgot about war.</p>

<p>Yet Stephen could now very seldom forget, and this was because
of the girl at her side. A queer, tight feeling would come round
her heart, she would know the fear that can go hand in hand with
personal courage, the fear for another.</p>

<p>But now she looked down for a moment and smiled: 'Bless that
blackbird for letting you see him, Mary.' She knew that Mary loved
little wild birds, that indeed she loved all the humbler
creatures.</p>

<p>They turned into a lane and were comparatively safe, but the
roar of the guns had grown much more insistent. They must be
nearing the Poste de Secours, so they spoke very little because of
those guns, and after a while because of the wounded.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The Poste de Secours was a ruined auberge at the crossroads,
about fifty yards behind the trenches. From what had once been its
spacious cellar, they were hurriedly carrying up the wounded,
maimed and mangled creatures who, a few hours ago, had been young
and vigorous men. None too gently the stretchers were lowered to
the ground beside the two waiting ambulances&mdash;none too gently
because there were so many of them, and because there must come a
time in all wars when custom stales even compassion.</p>

<p>The wounded were patient and fatalistic, like the very old women
back in the field. The only difference between them being that the
men had themselves become as a field laid bare to a ruthless and
bloody hoeing. Some of them had not even a blanket to protect them
from the biting cold of the wind. A Poilu with a mighty wound in
the belly, must lie with the blood congealing on the bandage. Next
to him lay a man with his face half blown away, who, God alone knew
why, remained conscious. The abdominal case was the first to be
handled, Stephen herself helped to lift his stretcher. He was
probably dying, but he did not complain inasmuch as he wanted his
mother. The voice that emerged from his coarse, bearded throat was
the voice of a child demanding its mother. The man with the
terrible face tried to speak, but when he did so the sound was not
human. His bandage had slipped a little to one side, so that
Stephen must step between him and Mary, and hastily readjust the
bandage.</p>

<p>'Get back to the ambulance! I shall want you to drive.' In
silence Mary obeyed her.</p>

<p>And now began the first of those endless journeys from the Poste
de Secours to the Field Hospital. For twenty-four hours they would
ply back and forth with their light Ford ambulances. Driving
quickly because the lives of the wounded might depend on their
speed, yet with every nerve taut to avoid, as far as might be, the
jarring of the hazardous roads full of ruts and shell-holes.</p>

<p>The man with the shattered face started again, they could hear
him above the throb of the motor. For a moment they stopped while
Stephen listened, but his lips were not there...an intolerable
sound.</p>

<p>'Faster, drive faster, Mary!'</p>

<p>Pale, but with firmly set, resolute mouth, Mary Llewellyn drove
faster.</p>

<p>When at last they reached the Field Hospital, the bearded Poilu
with the wound in his belly was lying very placidly on his
stretcher; his hairy chin pointing slightly upward. He had ceased
to speak as a little child&mdash;perhaps, after all, he had found
his mother.</p>

<p>The day went on and the sun shone out brightly, dazzling the
tired eyes of the drivers. Dusk fell, and the roads grew
treacherous and vague. Night came&mdash;they dared not risk having
lights, so that they must just stare and stare into the darkness.
In the distance the sky turned ominously red, some stray shells
might well have set fire to a village, that tall column of flame
was probably the church; and the Roches were punishing
Compi&egrave;gne again, to judge from the heavy sounds of
bombardment. Yet by now there was nothing real in the world but
that thick and almost impenetrable darkness, and the ache of the
eyes that must stare and stare, and the dreadful, patient pain of
the wounded&mdash;there had never been anything else in the world
but black night shot through with the pain of the wounded.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>On the following morning the two ambulances crept back to their
base at the villa in Compi&egrave;gne. It had been a tough job,
long hours of strain, and to make matters worse the reliefs had
been late, one of them having had a breakdown. Moving stiffly, and
with red rimmed and watering eyes, the four women swallowed large
cups of coffee; then just as they were they lay down on the floor,
wrapped in their trench coats and army blankets. In less than a
quarter of an hour they slept. Though the villa shook and rocked
with the bombardment.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>Chapter Thirty-six</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>There is something that mankind can never destroy in spite of an
unreasoning will to destruction, and this is its own idealism, that
integral part of its very being. The ageing and the cynical may
make wars, but the young and the idealistic must fight them, and
thus there are bound to come quick reactions, blind impulses not
always comprehended. Men will curse as they kill, yet accomplish
deeds of self-sacrifice, giving their lives for others; poets will
write with their pens dipped in blood, yet will write not of death
but of life eternal; strong and courteous friendships will be born,
to endure in the face of enmity and destruction. And so persistent
is this urge to the ideal, above all in the presence of great
disaster, that mankind, the wilful destroyer of beauty, must
immediately strive to create new beauties, lest it perish from a
sense of its own desolation; and this urge touched the Celtic soul
of Mary.</p>

<p>For the Celtic soul is the stronghold of dreams, of longings
come down the dim paths of the ages; and within it there dwells a
vague discontent, so that it must for ever go questing. And now as
though drawn by some hidden attraction, as though stirred by some
irresistible impulse, quite beyond the realms of her own
understanding, Mary turned in all faith and all innocence to
Stephen. Who can pretend to interpret fate, either his own fate or
that of another? Why should this girl have crossed Stephen's path,
or indeed Stephen hers, if it came to that matter? Was not the
world large enough for them both? Perhaps not&mdash;or perhaps the
event of their meeting had already been written upon tablets of
stone by some wise if relentless recording finger.</p>

<p>An orphan from the days of her earliest childhood, Mary had
lived with a married cousin in the wilds of Wales; an unwanted
member of a none too prosperous household. She had little education
beyond that obtained from a small private school in a neighbouring
village. She knew nothing of life or of men and women; and even
less did she know of herself, of her ardent, courageous, impulsive
nature. Thanks to the fact that her cousin was a doctor, forced to
motor over a widely spread practice, she had learnt to drive and
look after his car by filling the post of an unpaid
chauffeur&mdash;she was, in her small way, a good mechanic. But the
war had made her much less contented with her narrow life, and
although at its outbreak Mary had been not quite eighteen, she had
felt a great longing to be independent, in which she had met with
no opposition. However, a Welsh village is no field for endeavour,
and thus nothing had happened until by a fluke she had suddenly
heard of the Breakspeare Unit via the local parson, an old friend
of its founder&mdash;he himself had written to recommend Mary. And
so, straight from the quiet seclusion of Wales, this girl had
managed the complicated journey that had finally got her over to
France, then across a war-ravaged, dislocated country. Mary was
neither so frail nor so timid as Mrs. Breakspeare had thought
her.</p>

<p>Stephen had felt rather bored just at first at the prospect of
teaching the new member her duties, but after a while it came to
pass that she missed the girl when she was not with her. And after
a while she would find herself observing the way Mary's hair grew,
low on the forehead, the wide setting of her slightly oblique grey
eyes, the abrupt sweep back of their heavy lashes; and these things
would move Stephen, so that she must touch the girl's hair for a
moment with her fingers. Fate was throwing them continually
together, in moments of rest as in moments of danger; they could
not have escaped this even had they wished to, and indeed they did
not wish to escape it. They were pawns in the ruthless and
complicated game of existence, moved hither and thither on the
board by an unseen hand, yet moved side by side, so that they grew
to expect each other.</p>

<p>'Mary, are you there?'</p>

<p>A superfluous question&mdash;the reply would be always the same.
'I'm here, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Sometimes Mary would talk of her plans for the future while
Stephen listened, smiling as she did so.</p>

<p>'I'll go into an office, I want to be free.'</p>

<p>'You're so little, you'd get mislaid in an office.'</p>

<p>'I'm five foot five!'</p>

<p>Are you really, Mary? You feel little somehow.'</p>

<p>That's because you're so tall. I do wish I could grow a
bit!'</p>

<p>'No, don't wish that, you're all right as you are&mdash;it's
you, Mary.'</p>

<p>Mary would want to be told about Morton, she was never tired of
hearing about Morton. She would make Stephen get out the
photographs of her father, of her mother whom Mary thought lovely,
of Puddle, and above all of Raftery. Then Stephen must tell her of
the life in London, and afterwards of the new house in Paris; must
talk of her own career and ambitions, though Mary had not read
either of her novels&mdash;there had never been a library
subscription.</p>

<p>But at moments Stephen's face would grow clouded because of the
things that she could not tell her; because of the little untruths
and evasions that must fill up the gaps in her strange
life-history. Looking down into Mary's clear, grey eyes, she would
suddenly flush through her tan, and feel guilty; and that feeling
would reach the girl and disturb her, so that she must hold
Stephen's hand for a moment.</p>

<p>One day she said suddenly: 'Are you unhappy?'</p>

<p>'Why on earth should I be unhappy?' smiled Stephen.</p>

<p>All the same there were nights now when Stephen lay awake even
after her arduous hours of service, hearing the guns that were
coming nearer, yet not thinking of them, but always of Mary. A
great gentleness would gradually engulf her like a soft sea mist,
veiling reef and headland. She would seem to be drifting quietly,
serenely towards some blessed and peaceful harbour. Stretching out
a hand she would stroke the girl's shoulder where she lay, but
carefully in case she should wake her. Then the mist would lift:
'Good God! What am I doing?' She would sit up abruptly, disturbing
the sleeper.</p>

<p>'Is that you, Stephen?'</p>

<p>Yes, my dear, go to sleep.'</p>

<p>Then a cross, aggrieved voice: 'Do shut up, you two. It's rotten
of you, I was just getting off! Why must you always persist in
talking!'</p>

<p>Stephen would lie down again and would think: 'I'm a fool, I go
out of my way to find trouble. Of course I've grown fond of the
child, she's so plucky, almost anyone would grow fond of Mary. Why
should I have affection and friendship? Why should I have a real
human interest? I can help her to find her feet after the war if we
both come through&mdash;I might buy her a business.' That gentle
mist, hiding both reef and headland; it would gather again blurring
all perception, robbing the past of its crude, ugly outlines.
'After all, what harm can it do the child to be fond of me?' It was
so good a thing to have won the affection of this young
creature.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The Germans got perilously near to Compi&egrave;gne, and the
Breakspeare Unit was ordered to retire. Its base was now at a
ruined ch&acirc;teau on the outskirts of an insignificant village,
yet not so very insignificant either&mdash;it was stuffed to the
neck with ammunition. Nearly all the hours that were spent off duty
must be passed in the gloomy, damp-smelling dug-outs which
consisted of cellars, partly destroyed but protected by sandbags on
heavy timbers. Like foxes creeping out of their holes, the members
of the Unit would creep into the daylight, their uniforms covered
with mould and rubble, their eyes blinking, their hands cold and
numb from the dampness&mdash;so cold and so numb that the starting
up of motors would often present a real problem.</p>

<p>At this time there occurred one or two small mishaps; Bless
broke her wrist while cranking her engine; Blakeney and three
others at a Poste de Secours, were met by a truly terrific
bombardment and took cover in what had once been a brick-field,
crawling into the disused furnace. There they squatted for
something over eight hours, while the German gunners played hit as
hit can with the tall and conspicuous chimney. When at last they
emerged, half stifled by brick-dust, Blakeney had got something
into her eye, which she rubbed; the result was acute
inflammation.</p>

<p>Howard had begun to be irritating, with her passion for tending
her beautiful hair. She would sit in the corner of her dug-out as
calmly as though she were sitting at a Bond Street hairdresser's;
and having completed the ritual brushing, she would gaze at herself
in a pocket mirror. With a bandage over her unfortunate eye,
Blakeney looked more like a monkey than ever, a sick monkey, and
her strictly curtailed conversation was not calculated to enliven
the Unit. She seemed almost entirely bereft of speech these days,
as though reverting to species. Her one comment on life was: Oh, I
dunno...' always said with a jaunty rising inflexion. It meant
everything or nothing as you chose to take it, and had long been
her panacea for the ills of what she considered a stupid Creation.
'Oh, I dunno...' And indeed she did not; poor, old, sensitive,
monosyllabic Blakeney. The Poilu who served out the Unit's
rations&mdash;cold meat, sardines, bread and sour red
Pinard&mdash;was discovered by Stephen in the very act of
attempting to unload an aerial bomb. He explained with a smile that
the Germans were sly in their methods of loading: 'I cannot
discover just how it is done.' Then he showed his left
hand&mdash;it was minus one of the fingers: 'That,' he told her,
still smiling, 'was caused by a shell, a quite little shell, which
I was also unloading.' And when she remonstrated none too gently,
he sulked: 'But I wish to give this one to Maman!'</p>

<p>Everyone had begun to feel the nerve strain, except perhaps
Blakeney, who had done with all feeling. Shorthanded by two, the
remaining members of the Unit must now work like veritable
niggers&mdash;on one occasion Stephen and Mary worked for seventy
hours with scarcely a respite. Strained nerves are invariably
followed by strained tempers, and sudden, hot quarrels would break
out over nothing. Bless and Howard loathed each other for two days,
then palled up again, because of a grievance that had recently been
evolved against Stephen. For everyone knew that Stephen and
Blakeney were by far the best drivers in the Breakspeare Unit, and
as such should be shared by all the members in turn; but poor
Blakeney was nursing a very sore eye, while Stephen still continued
to drive only with Mary. They were splendidly courageous and
great-hearted women, every one of them, glad enough as a rule to
help one another to shoulder burdens, to be tolerant and kind when
it came to friendships. They petted and admired their youngest
recruit, and most of them liked and respected Stephen, all the same
they had now grown childishly jealous, and this jealousy reached
the sharp ears of Mrs. Breakspeare.</p>

<p>Mrs. Breakspeare sent for Stephen one morning; she was sitting
at a Louis Quinze writing-table which had somehow survived the
wreck of the ch&acirc;teau and was now in her gloomy, official
dug-out. Her right band reposed on an ordnance, map, she looked
like a very maternal general. The widow of an officer killed in the
war, and the mother of two large sons and three daughters, she had
led the narrow, conventional life that is common to women in
military stations. Yet all the while she must have been filling her
subconscious reservoir with knowledge, for she suddenly blossomed
forth as leader with a fine understanding of human nature. So now
she looked over her ample bosom not unkindly, but rather
thoughtfully at Stephen.</p>

<p>Sit down, Miss Gordon. It's about Llewellyn, whom I asked you to
take on as second driver. I think the time has now arrived when she
ought to stand more on her own in the Unit. She must take her
chance like everyone else, and not cling quite so close&mdash;don't
misunderstand me, I'm most grateful for all you've done for the
girl&mdash;but of course you are one of our finest drivers, and
fine driving counts for a great deal these days, it may mean life
or death, as you yourself know. And&mdash;well&mdash;it seems
scarcely fair to the others that Mary should always go out with
you. No, it certainly is not quite fair to the others.'</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'Do you mean that she's to go out with every one
in turn&mdash;with Thurloe for instance?' And do what she would to
appear indifferent, she could not quite keep her voice from
trembling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Breakspeare nodded: 'That's what I do mean.' Then she said
rather slowly: 'These are strenuous times, and such times are apt
to breed many emotions which are purely fictitious, purely mushroom
growths that spring up in a night and have no roots at all, except
in our imaginations. But I'm sure you'll agree with me, Miss
Gordon, in thinking it our duty to discourage anything in the
nature of an emotional friendship, such as I fancy Mary Llewellyn
is on the verge of feeling for you. It's quite natural of course, a
kind of reaction, but not wise&mdash;no, I cannot think it wise. It
savours a little too much of the schoolroom and might lead to
ridicule in the Unit. Your position is far too important for that;
I look upon you as my second in command.'</p>

<p>Stephen said quietly: 'I quite understand. I'll go at once and
speak to Blakeney about altering Mary Llewellyn's time-sheet.'</p>

<p>'Yes, do, if you will,' agreed Mrs. Breakspeare; then she
stooped and studied her ordnance map, without looking again at
Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>If Stephen had been fearful for Mary's safety before, she was
now ten times more so. The front was in a condition of flux and the
Postes de Secours were continually shifting. An Allied ambulance
driver had been fired on by the Germans, after having arrived at
the spot where his Poste had been only the previous evening. There
was very dose fighting on every sector; it seemed truly amazing
that no grave casualties had so far occurred in the Unit. For now
the Allies had begun to creep forward, yard by yard, mile by mile,
very slowly but surely; refreshed by a splendid transfusion of
blood from the youthful veins of a great child-nation.</p>

<p>Of all the anxieties on Mary's account that now beset Stephen,
Thurloe was the gravest; for Thurloe was one of those irritating
drivers who stake all on their own inadequate judgment. She was
brave to a fault, but inclined to show off when it came to a matter
of actual danger. For long hours Stephen would not know what had
happened, and must often leave the base before Mary had returned,
still in doubt regarding her safety.</p>

<p>Grimly, yet with unfailing courage and devotion, Stephen now
went about her duties. Every day the risks that they all took grew
graver, for the enemy, nearing the verge of defeat, was less than
ever a respecter of persons. Stephen's only moments of comparative
peace would be when she herself drove Mary. And as though the girl
missed some vitalizing force, some strength that had been hitherto
hers to draw on, she flagged and Stephen would watch her flagging
during their brief spell together off duty, and would know that
nothing but her Celtic pluck kept Mary Llewellyn from a breakdown.
And now, because they were so often parted, even chance meetings
became of importance. They might meet while preparing their cars in
the morning, and if this should happen they would draw close
together for a moment, as though finding comfort in nearness.</p>

<p>Letters from home would arrive for Stephen, and these she would
want to read to Mary. In addition to writing, Puddle sent food,
even luxuries sometimes of a pre-war nature. To obtain them she
must have used bribery and corruption, for food of all kinds had
grown scarce in England. Puddle, it seemed, had a mammoth war map
into which she stuck pins with gay little pennants. Every time the
lines moved by so much as a yard, out would come Puddle's pins to
go in at fresh places; for since Stephen had left her to go to the
front, the war had become very personal to Puddle.</p>

<p>Anna also wrote, and from her Stephen learnt of the death of
Roger Antrim. He had been shot down while winning his V.C. Through
saving the life of a wounded captain. All alone he had gone over to
no-man's-land and had rescued his friend where he lay unconscious;
receiving a bullet through the head at the moment of flinging the
wounded man into safety. Roger&mdash;so lacking in understanding,
so crude, so cruel and remorseless a bully&mdash;Roger had been
changed in the twinkling of an eye into something superb because
utterly selfless. Thus it was that the undying urge of mankind
towards the ideal had come upon Roger. And Stephen as she sat there
and read of his passing, suddenly knew that she wished him well,
that his courage had wiped one great bitterness out of her heart
and her life for ever. And so by dying as he had died, Roger, all
unknowing, had fulfilled the law that must be extended to enemy and
friend alike&mdash;the immutable law of service.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Events gathered momentum. By the June of that year 700,000
United States soldiers, strong and comely men plucked from their
native prairies, from their fields of tall corn, from their farms
and their cities, were giving their lives in defence of freedom on
the blood-soaked battlefields of France. They had little to gain
and much to lose; it was not their war, yet they helped to fight it
because they were young and their nation was young, and the ideals
of youth are eternally hopeful.</p>

<p>In July came the Allied counter-offensive, and now in her moment
of approaching triumph France knew to the full her great
desolation, as it lay revealed by the retreating armies. For not
only had there been a holocaust of homesteads, but the country was
strewn with murdered trees, cut down in their hour of most perfect
leafing; orchards struck to the ground, an orgy of destruction, as
the mighty forces rolled back like a tide, to recoil on
themselves&mdash;incredulous, amazed, maddened by the outrage of
coming disaster. For mad they must surely have been, since no man
is a more faithful lover of trees than the German.</p>

<p>Stephen as she drove through that devastated country would find
herself thinking of Martin Hallam&mdash;Martin who had touched the
old thorns on the hills with such respectful and pitiful fingers:
'Have you ever thought about the enormous courage of trees? I have
and it seems to me amazing. The Lord dumps them down and they've
just got to stick it, no matter what happens&mdash;that must need
some courage.' Martin had believed in a heaven for trees, a forest
heaven for all the faithful; and looking at those pitiful, leafy
corpses, Stephen would want to believe in that heaven. Until lately
she had not thought of Martin for years, he belonged to a past that
was better forgotten, but now she would sometimes wonder about him.
Perhaps he was dead, smitten down where she stood, for many had
perished where they stood, like the orchards. It was strange to
think that he might have been here in France, have been fighting
and have died quite near her. But perhaps he had not been killed
after all&mdash;she had never told Mary about Martin Hallam.</p>

<p>All roads of thought seemed to lead back to Mary; and these
days, in addition to fears for her safety, came a growing distress
at what she must see&mdash;far more terrible sights than the
patient wounded. For everywhere now lay the wreckage of war,
sea-wrack spewed up by a poisonous ocean&mdash;putrefying,
festering in the sun; breeding curruption to man's seed of folly.
Twice lately, while they had been driving together, they had come
upon sights that Stephen would have spared her. There had been that
shattered German gun-carriage with its stiff, dead horses and its
three dead gunners&mdash;horrible death, the men's faces had been
black like the faces of negroes, black and swollen from gas, or was
it from putrefaction? There had been the deserted and wounded
charger with its fore-leg hanging as though by a rag. Near by had
been lying a dead young Uhlan, and Stephen had shot the beast with
his revolver, but Mary had suddenly started sobbing: Oh, God! Oh,
God! It was dumb&mdash;it couldn't speak. It's so awful somehow to
see a thing suffer when it can't ask you why!' She had sobbed a
long time, and Stephen had not known how to console her.</p>

<p>And now the Unit was creeping forward in the wake of the
steadily advancing Allies. Billets would be changed as the base
moved on slowly from devastated village to village. There seldom
seemed to be a house left with a roof, or with anything much beyond
its four walls, and quite often they must lie staring up at the
stars, which would stare back again, aloof and untroubled. At about
this time they grew very short of water, for most of the wells were
said to have been poisoned; and this shortage of water was a very
real torment, since it strictly curtailed the luxury of washing.
Then what must Bless do but get herself hit while locating the
position of a Poste de Secours which had most inconsiderately
vanished. Like the Allied ambulance driver she was shot at, but in
her case she happened to stop a bullet&mdash;it was only a flesh
wound high up in the arm, yet enough to render her useless for a
moment. She had had to be sent back to hospital, so once again the
Unit was short-handed.</p>

<p>It turned hot, and in place of the dampness and the cold, came
days and nights that seemed almost breathless; days when the
wounded must lie out in the sun, tormented by flies as they waited
their turn to be lifted into the ambulances. And as though
misfortunes attracted each other, as though indeed they were
hunting in couples, Stephen's face was struck by a splinter of
shell, and her right cheek cut open rather badly. It was neatly
stitched up by the little French doctor at the Poste de Secours,
and when he had finished with his needle and dressings, he bowed
very gravely: 'Mademoiselle will carry an honourable scar as a mark
of her courage,' and he bowed yet again, so that in the end Stephen
must also bow gravely. Fortunately, however, she could still do her
job, which was all to the good for the short-handed Unit.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>On an autumn afternoon of blue sky and sunshine, Stephen had the
Croix de Guerre pinned on her breast by a white-haired and
white-moustached general. First came the motherly Mrs. Claude
Breakspeare, whose tunic looked much too tight for her bosom, then
Stephen and one or two other members of that valiant and untiring
Unit. The general kissed each one in turn on both cheeks, while
overhead hovered a fleet of Aces; troops presented arms, veteran
troops tried in battle, and having the set look of war in their
eyes&mdash;for the French have a very nice taste in such matters.
And presently Stephen's bronze Croix de Guerre would carry three
miniature stars on its ribbon and, each star would stand for a
mention in despatches.</p>

<p>That evening she and Mary walked over the fields to a little
town not very far from their billets. They paused for a moment to
watch the sunset, and Mary stroked the new Croix de Guerre; then
she looked straight up into Stephen's eyes, her mouth shook, and
Stephen saw that she was crying. After this they must walk hand in
hand for a while. Why not? There was no one just then to see
them.</p>

<p>Mary said: 'All my life I've been waiting for something.'</p>

<p>'What was it, my dear?' Stephen asked her gently.</p>

<p>And Mary answered: 'I've been waiting for you, and it's seemed
such a dreadful long time, Stephen.'</p>

<p>The barely healed wound across Stephen's cheek flushed darlky,
for what could she find to answer?</p>

<p>'For me?' she stammered.</p>

<p>Mary nodded gravely: 'Yes, for you. I've always been waiting for
you; and after the war you'll send me away.' Then she suddenly
caught hold of Stephen's sleeve: 'Let me come with you&mdash;don't
send me away, I want to be near you...I can't explain...but I only
want to be near you, Stephen. Stephen&mdash;say you won't send me
away...</p>

<p>Stephen's hand closed over the Croix de Guerre, but the metal of
valour felt cold to her fingers; dead and cold it felt at that
moment, as the courage that had set it upon her breast. She stared
straight ahead of her into the sunset, trembling because of what
she would answer.</p>

<p>Then she said very slowly: 'After the war&mdash;no, I won't send
you away from me, Mary.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>The most stupendous and heartbreaking folly of our times drew
towards its abrupt conclusion. By November the Unit was stationed
at St. Quentin in a little hotel, which although very humble,
seemed like paradise after the dug-outs.</p>

<p>A morning came when a handful of the members were together in
the coffee-room, huddled round a fire that was principally composed
of damp brushwood. At one moment the guns could be heard
distinctly, the next, something almost unnatural had
happened&mdash;there was silence, as though death had turned on
himself, smiting his own power of destruction. No one spoke, they
just sat and stared at each other with faces entirely devoid of
emotion; their faces looked blank, like so many masks from which
had been sponged every trace of expression&mdash;and they
waited&mdash;listening to that silence.</p>

<p>The door opened and in walked an untidy Poilu; his manner was
casual, his voice apathetic: 'Eh bien, mesdames, c'est
l'Armistice.' But his shining brown eyes were not at all apathetic.
'Oui, c'est l'Armistice,' he repeated coolly; then he shrugged, as
a man might do who would say: 'What is all this to me?' After which
he grinned broadly in spite of himself, he was still very young,
and turning on his heel he departed.</p>

<p>Stephen said: So it's over,' and she looked at Mary, who had
jumped up, and was looking in her turn at Stephen.</p>

<p>Mary said: This means...' but she stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>Bless said: 'Got a match, anyone? Oh, thanks!' And she groped
for her white-metal cigarette case.</p>

<p>Howard said: 'Well, the first thing I'm going to do is to get my
hair properly shampooed in Paris.'</p>

<p>Thurloe laughed shrilly, then she started to whistle, kicking
the recalcitrant fire as she did so.</p>

<p>But funny, old, monosyllabic Blakeney with her curly white hair
cropped as close as an Uhlan's&mdash;Blakeney who had long ago done
with emotions&mdash;quite suddenly laid her arms on the table and
her head on her arms, and she wept, and she wept.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen stayed with the Unit right up to the eve of its
departure for Germany, then she left it, taking Mary Llewellyn with
her. Their work was over; remained only the honour of joining the
army's triumphal progress, but Mary Llewellyn was completely worn
out, and Stephen had no thought except for Mary.</p>

<p>They said farewell to Mrs. Claude Breakspeare, to Howard and
Blakeney and the rest of their comrades. And Stephen knew, as
indeed did they also, that a mighty event had slipped into the
past, had gone from them into the realms of history&mdash;something
terrible yet splendid, a oneness with life in its titanic struggle
against death. Not a woman of them all but felt vaguely regretful
in spite of the infinite blessing of peace, for none could know
what the future might hold of trivial days filled with trivial
actions. Great wars will be followed by great discontents&mdash;the
pruning knife has been laid to the tree, and the urge to grow
throbs through its mutilated branches.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The house in the Rue Jacob was en fete in honour of Stephen's
arrival. Pierre had rigged up an imposing flagstaff', from which
waved a brand new tricolour commandeered by Pauline from the
neighbouring baker; flowers had been placed in the study vases,
while Ad&egrave;le had contrived to produce the word 'welcome' in
immortelles, as the piece de resistance, and had hung it above the
doorway.</p>

<p>Stephen shook hands with them all in turn, and she introduced
Mary, who also shook hands. Then Ad&egrave;le must start to gabble
about Jean, who was quite safe although not a captain; and Pauline
must interrupt her to tell of the neighbouring baker who had lost
his four sons, and of one of her brothers who had lost his right
leg&mdash;her face very dour and her voice very cheerful, as was
always the way when she told of misfortunes. And presently she must
also deplore the long straight scar upon Stephen's cheek: 'Oh, la
pauvre! Pour une dame c'est un vrai d&eacute;sastre!' But Pierre
must point to the green and red ribbon in Stephen's lapel: 'C'est
la Croix de Guerre!' so that in the end they all gathered round to
admire that half-inch of honour and glory.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, this home-coming was as friendly and happy as goodwill
and warm Breton hearts could make it. Yet Stephen was oppressed by
a sense of restraint when she took Mary up to the charming bedroom
overlooking the garden, and she spoke abruptly.</p>

<p>'This will be your room.'</p>

<p>'It's beautiful, Stephen.'</p>

<p>After that they were silent, perhaps because there was so much
that might not be spoken between them:</p>

<p>The dinner was served by a beaming Pierre, an excellent dinner,
more than worthy of Pauline; but neither of them managed to eat
very much&mdash;they were far too acutely conscious of each other.
When the meal was over they went into the study where, in spite of
the abnormal shortage of fuel, Ad&egrave;le had managed to build a
huge fire which blazed recklessly half up the chimney. The room
smelt slightly of hothouse flowers, of leather, of old wood and
vanished years, and after a while of cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>Then Stephen forced herself to speak lightly: 'Come and sit over
here by the fire,' she said, smiling.</p>

<p>So Mary obeyed, sitting down beside her, and she laid a hand
upon Stephen's knee; but Stephen appeared not to notice that hand,
for she just let it lie there and went on talking.</p>

<p>'I've been thinking, Mary, hatching all sorts of schemes. I'd
like to get you right away for a bit, the weather seems pretty
awful in Paris. Puddle once told me about Teneriffe, she went there
ages ago with a pupil. She stayed at a place called Orotava; it's
lovely, I believe&mdash;do you think you'd enjoy it? I might manage
to hear of a villa with a garden, and then you could just slack
about in the sunshine.'</p>

<p>Mary said, very conscious of the unnoticed hand: 'Do you really
want to go away, Stephen? Wouldn't it interfere with your writing?'
Her voice, Stephen thought, sounded strained and unhappy.</p>

<p>Of course I want to go,' Stephen reassured her, 'I'll work all
the better for a holiday. Anyhow, I must see you looking more fit,'
and she suddenly laid her hand over Mary's.</p>

<p>The strange sympathy which sometimes exists between two human
bodies, so that a touch will stir many secret and perilous
emotions, closed down on them both at that moment of contact, and
they sat unnaturally still by the fire, feeling that in their
stillness lay safety. But presently Stephen went on talking, and
now she talked of purely practical matters. Mary must go for a
fortnight to her cousins, she had better go almost at once, and
remain there while Stephen herself went to Morton. Eventually they
would meet in London and from there motor straight away to
Southampton, for Stephen would have taken their passages, and if
possible found a furnished villa, before she went down to Morton.
She talked on and on, and as she did so her fingers tightened and
relaxed abruptly on the hand that she had continued to hold, so
that Mary imprisoned those nervous fingers in her own, and Stephen
made no resistance.</p>

<p>Then Mary, like many another before her, grew as happy as she
had been downhearted; for the merest trifles are often enough to
change the trend of mercurial emotions such as beset the heart in
its youth; and she looked at Stephen with gratitude in her eyes,
and with something far more fundamental of which she herself was
unconscious. And now she began to talk in her turn. She could type
fairly well, was a very good speller; she would type Stephen's
books, take care of her papers, answer her letters, look after the
house, even beard the lugubrious Pauline in her kitchen. Next
autumn she would write to Holland for bulbs&mdash;they must have
lots of bulbs in their city garden, and in summer they ought to
manage some roses&mdash;Paris was less cruel to flowers than
London. Oh, and might she have pigeons with wide, white tails? They
would go so well with the old marble fountain.</p>

<p>Stephen listened, nodding from time to time. Yes, of course she
could have her white fan-tail pigeons, and her bulbs and her roses,
could have anything she pleased, if only she would get quite well
and be happy.</p>

<p>At this Mary laughed: 'Oh, Stephen, my dear&mdash;don't you know
that I'm really terribly happy?'</p>

<p>Pierre came in with the evening letters; there was one from Anna
and another from Puddle. There was also a lengthy epistle from
Brockett who was praying, it seemed, for demobilization. Once
released, he must go for a few weeks to England, but after that he
was coming to Paris.</p>

<p>He wrote: 'I'm longing to see you again and Val&eacute;rie
Seymour. By the way, how goes it? Val&eacute;rie writes that you
never rang her up. It's a pity you're so unsociable, Stephen;
unwholesome, I call it, you'll be bagging a shell like a hermit
crab, or growing hairs on your chin, or a wart on your nose, or
worse still a complex. You might even take to a few nasty habits
towards middle life&mdash;better read Ferenczi! Why were you so
beastly to Val&eacute;rie, I wonder. She is such a darling and she
likes you so much, only the other day she wrote: "When you see
Stephen Gordon give her my love, and tell her that nearly all
streets in Paris lead sooner or later to Val&eacute;rie Seymour."
You might write her a line, and you might write to me&mdash;already
I'm finding your silence suspicious. Are you in love? I'm just
crazy to know, so why deny me that innocent pleasure? After all,
we're told to rejoice with those who rejoice&mdash;may I send my
congratulations? Vague but exciting rumours have reached me. And by
the way, Val&eacute;rie's very forgiving, so don't feel shy about
telephoning to her. She's one of those highly developed souls who
bob up serenely after a snubbing, as do I, your devoted
Brockett.'</p>

<p>Stephen glanced at Mary as she folded the letter: 'Isn't it time
you went off to bed?'</p>

<p>'Don't send me away.'</p>

<p>'I must, you're so tired. Come on, there's a good child, you
look tired and sleepy.'</p>

<p>'I'm not a bit sleepy!'</p>

<p>'All the same it's high time.'</p>

<p>'Are you coming?'</p>

<p>'Not yet, I must answer some letters.'</p>

<p>Mary got up, and just for a moment their eyes met, then Stephen
looked away quickly: 'Good night, Mary.'</p>

<p>'Stephen...won't you kiss me good night? It's our first night
together here in your home. Stephen, do you know that you've never
kissed me?'</p>

<p>The clock chimed ten, a rose on the desk fell apart, its
overblown petals disturbed by that almost imperceptible vibration.
Stephen's heart brat thickly.</p>

<p>'Do you want me to kiss you?'</p>

<p>'More than anything else in the world,' said Mary.</p>

<p>Then Stephen suddenly came to her senses, and she managed to
smile: 'Very well, my dear,' She kissed the girl quietly on her
cheek. 'And now you really must go to bed, Mary.'</p>

<p>After Mary had gone she tried to write letters; a few lines to
Anna, announcing her visit; a few lines to Puddle and to
Mademoiselle Duphot&mdash;the latter she felt that she had
shamefully neglected. But in none of these letters did she mention
Mary. Brockett's effusion she left unanswered. Then she took her
unfinished novel from its drawer, but it seemed very dreary and
unimportant, so she laid it aside again with a sigh, and locking
the drawer put the key in her pocket.</p>

<p>And now she could no longer keep it at bay, the great joy, the
great pain in her heart that was Mary. She had only to call and
Mary would come, bringing all her faith, her youth and her ardour.
Yes, she had only to call, and yet&mdash;would she ever be cruel
enough to call Mary? Her mind recoiled at that word; why cruel? She
and Mary loved and needed each other. She could give the girl
luxury, make her secure so that she need never fight for her
living; she should have every comfort that money could buy. Mary
was not strong enough to fight for her living. And then she,
Stephen, was no longer a child to be frightened and humbled by this
situation. There was many another exactly like her in this very
city, in every city; and they did not all live out crucified lives,
denying their bodies, stultifying their brains, becoming the
victims of their own frustrations. On the contrary, they lived
natural lives&mdash;lives that to them were perfectly natural. They
had their passions like everyone else, and why not? They were
surely entitled to their passions? They attracted too, that was the
irony of it, she herself had attracted Mary Llewellyn&mdash;the
girl was quite simply and openly in love. 'All my life I've been
waiting for something...' Mary had said that, she had said: 'All
my' life I've been waiting for something...I've been waiting for
you.'</p>

<p>Men&mdash;they were selfish, arrogant, possessive. What could
they do for Mary Llewellyn? What could a man give that she could
not? A child? But she would give Mary such a love as would be
complete in itself without children. Mary would have no room in her
heart, in her life, for a child, if she came to Stephen. All things
they would be the one to the other, should they stand in that
limitless relationship; father, mother, friend, and lover, all
things&mdash;the amazing completeness of it; and Mary, the child,
the friend, the beloved. With the terrible bonds of her dual
nature, she could bind Mary fast, and the pain would be sweetness,
so that the girl would cry out for that sweetness, hugging her
chains always closer to her. The world would condemn but they would
rejoice; glorious outcasts, unashamed, triumphant!</p>

<p>She began to pace restlessly up and down the room, as had ever
been her wont in moments of emotion. Her face grew ominous, heavy
and brooding; the fine line of her mouth was a little marred; her
eyes were less clear, less the servants of her spirit than the
slaves of her anxious and passionate body; the red scar on her
cheek stood out like a wound. Then quite suddenly she had opened
the door, and was staring at the dimly lighted staircase. She took
a step forward and then stopped; appalled, dumb-founded at herself,
at this thing she was doing. And as she stood there as though
turned to stone, she remembered another and spacious study, she
remembered a lanky colt of a girl whose glance had kept straying
towards the windows; she remembered a man who had held out his
hand: Stephen, come here...What is honour, my daughter?'</p>

<p>Honour, good God! Was this her honour? Mary, whose nerves had
been strained to breaking! A dastardly thing it would be to drag
her through the maze of passion, with no word of warning. Was she
to know nothing of what lay before her, of the price she would have
to pay for such love? She was young and completely ignorant of
life; she knew only that she loved, and the young were ardent. She
would give all that Stephen might ask of her and more, for the
young were not only ardent but generous. And through giving all she
would be left defenceless, neither forewarned nor forearmed against
a world that would turn like a merciless beast and rend her. It was
horrible. No, Mary must not give until she had counted the cost of
that gift, until she was restored in body and mind, and was able to
form a considered judgment.</p>

<p>Then Stephen must tell her the cruel truth, she must say: 'I am
one of those whom God marked on the forehead. Like Cain, I am
marked and blemished. If you come to me, Mary, the world will abhor
you, will persecute you, will call you unclean. Our love may be
faithful even unto death and beyond&mdash;yet the world will call
it unclean. We may harm no living creature by our love; we may grow
more perfect in understanding and in charity because of our loving;
but all this will not save you from the scourge of a world that
will turn away its eyes from your noblest actions, finding only
corruption and vileness in you. You will see men and women defiling
each other, laying the burden of their sins upon their children.
You will see unfaithfulness, lies and deceit among those whom the
world views with approbation. You will find that many have grown
hard of heart, have grown greedy, selfish, cruel and lustful; and
then you will turn to me and will say: "You and I are more worthy
of respect than these people. Why does the world persecute us,
Stephen?" And I shall answer: "Because in this world there is only
toleration for the so-called normal." And when you come to me for
protection, I shall say: "I cannot protect you, Mary, the world has
deprived me of my right to protect; I am utterly helpless, I can
only love you."'</p>

<p>And now Stephen was trembling. In spite of her strength and her
splendid physique, she must stand there and tremble. She felt
deathly cold, her teeth chattered with cold, and when she moved her
steps were unsteady. She must climb the wide stairs with infinite
care, in case she should inadvertently stumble; must lift her feet
slowly, and with infinite care, because if she stumbled she might
wake Mary.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Ten days later Stephen was saying to her mother: 'I've been
needing a change for a very long time. It's rather lucky that girl
I met in the Unit is free and able to go with me. We've taken a
villa at Orotava, it's supposed to be furnished and they're leaving
the servants, but heaven only knows what the house will be like, it
belongs to a Spaniard; however, there'll be sunshine.'</p>

<p>'I believe Orotava's delightful,' said Anna.</p>

<p>But Puddle, who was looking at Stephen, said nothing.</p>

<p>That night Stephen knocked at Puddle's door: 'May I come
in?'</p>

<p>'Yes, come in do, my dear. Come and sit by the fire&mdash;shall
I make you some cocoa?'</p>

<p>'No, thanks.'</p>

<p>A long pause while Puddle slipped into her dressing-gown of
soft, grey Viyella. Then she also drew a chair up to the fire, and
after a little: 'It's good to see you&mdash;your old teacher's been
missing you rather&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Not more than I've been missing her, Puddle.' Was that quite
true? Stephen suddenly flushed, and both of them grew very
silent.</p>

<p>Puddle knew quite well that Stephen was unhappy. They had not
lived side by side all these years, for Puddle to fail now in
intuition; she felt certain that something grave had happened, and
her instinct warned her of what this might be, so that she secretly
trembled a little. For no young and inexperienced girl sat beside
her, but a woman of nearly thirty-two, who was far beyond the reach
of her guidance. This woman would settle her problems for herself
and in her own way&mdash;had indeed always done so. Puddle must try
to be tactful in her questions.</p>

<p>She said gently: 'Tell me about your new friend. You met her in
the Unit?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;we met in the Unit,' as I told you this
evening&mdash;her name's Mary Llewellyn.'</p>

<p>'How old is she, Stephen?'</p>

<p>'Not quite twenty-two.'</p>

<p>Puddle said: 'Very young&mdash;not yet twenty-two...' then she
glanced at Stephen, and fell silent.</p>

<p>But now Stephen went on talking more quickly: 'I'm glad you
asked me about her, Puddle, because I intend to give her a home.
She's got no one except some distant cousins, and as far as I can
see they don't want her. I shall let her have a try at typing my
work, as she's asked to, it will make her feel independent;
otherwise, of course, she'll be perfectly free&mdash;if it's not a
success she can always leave me&mdash;but rather hope it will be a
success. She's companionable, we like the same things, anyhow
she'll give me an interest in life...</p>

<p>Puddle thought: 'She's not going to tell me.'</p>

<p>Stephen took out her cigarette case from which she produced a
clear little snapshot: 'It's not very good, it was done at the
front.' But Puddle was gazing at Mary Llewellyn. Then she looked up
abruptly and saw Stephen's eyes&mdash;without a word she handed
back the snapshot.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'Now I want to talk about you. Will you go to
Paris at once, or stay here until we come home from Orotava? It's
just as you like, the house is quite ready, you've only got to send
Pauline a postcard; they're expecting you at any moment.' And she
waited for Puddle's answer.</p>

<p>Then Puddle, that small but indomitable fighter, stood forth all
alone to do battle with herself, to strike down a sudden hot
jealousy, a sudden and almost fierce resentment. And she saw that
self as a tired old woman, a woman grown dull and tired with long
service; a woman who had outlived her reason for living, whose
companionship was now useless to Stephen. A woman who suffered from
rheumatism in the winter and from lassitude in the summer; a woman
who when young had never known youth, except as a scourge to a
sensitive conscience. And now she was old and what had life left
her? Not even the privilege of guarding her friend&mdash;for Puddle
knew well that her presence in Paris would only embarrass while
unable to hinder. Nothing could stay fate if the hour had struck;
and yet, from the very bottom of her soul, she was fearing that
hour for Stephen. And&mdash;who shall presume to accuse or
condemn?&mdash;she actually found it in her to pray that Stephen
might be granted some measure of fulfilment, some palliative for
the wound of existence: 'Not like me&mdash;don't let her grow old
as I've done.' Then she suddenly remembered that Stephen was
waiting.</p>

<p>She said quietly: 'Listen, my dear, I've been thinking; I don't
feel that I ought to leave your mother, her heart's not very
strong&mdash;nothing serious, of course&mdash;still, she oughtn't
to live all alone at Morton; and quite apart from the question of
health, living alone's a melancholy business. There's another thing
too. I've grown tired and lazy, and I don't want to pull up my
roots if I can help it. When one's getting on in years, one gets
set in one's ways, and my ways fit in very well with Morton. I
didn't want to come here, Stephen, as I told you, but I was all
wrong, for your mother needs me&mdash;she needs me more now than
during the war, because during the war she had occupation. Oh, but
good heavens! I'm a silly old woman&mdash;did you know that I used
to get homesick for England? I used to get homesick for penny buns.
Imagine it, and I was living in Paris! Only&mdash;' And now her
voice broke a little: 'Only, if ever you should feel that you need
me, if ever you should feel that you want my advice or my help,
you'd send for me, wouldn't you, my dear? Because old as I am, I'd
be able to run if I thought that you really needed me,
Stephen.'</p>

<p>Stephen held out her hand and Puddle grasped it. 'There are some
things I can't express,' Stephen said slowly; 'I can't express my
gratitude to you for all you've done&mdash;I can't find any words.
But&mdash;I want you to know that I'm trying to play straight.'</p>

<p>'You'd always play straight in the end,' said Puddle.</p>

<p>And so, after nearly eighteen years of life together, these two
staunch friends and companions had now virtually parted.</p>

<h3><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>Chapter Thirty-eight</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>The Villa del Cipr&eacute;s at Orotava was built on a headland
above the Puerto. It had taken its name from its fine cypress
trees, of which there were many in the spacious garden. At the
Puerto there were laughter, shouting and singing as the oxen wagons
with their crates of bananas came grating and stumbling down to the
wharf. At the Puerto one might almost have said there was commerce,
for beyond the pier waited the dirty fruit steamers; but the Villa
del Cipr&eacute;s stood proudly aloof like a Spanish grandee who
had seen better days&mdash;one felt that it literally hated
commerce.</p>

<p>The villa was older than the streets of the Puerto, though much
grass grew between their venerable cobbles. It was older than the
oldest villas on the hill, the hill that was known as old Orotava,
though their green latticed shutters were bleached by the sun of
innumerable semitropical summers. It was so old indeed, that no
peasant could have told you precisely when it had come into being;
the records were lost, if they had ever existed&mdash;for its
history one had to apply to its owner. But then its owner was
always in Spain, and his agent who kept the place in repair, was
too lazy to bother himself over trifles. What could it matter when
the first stone was laid, or who laid it? The villa was always well
let&mdash;he would yawn, roll a cigarette in his fingers, lick the
paper with the thick, red tip of his tongue, and finally go to
sleep in the sunshine to dream only of satisfactory
commissions.</p>

<p>The Villa del Cipr&eacute;s was a low stone house that had once
been, tinted a lemon yellow. Its shutters were greener than those
on the hill, for every ten years or so they were painted. All its
principal windows looked over the sea that lay at the foot of the
little headland. There were large, dim rooms with rough mosaic
floors and walls that were covered by ancient frescoes. Some of
these frescoes were primitive but holy, others were primitive but
distinctly less holy; however, they were all so badly defaced, that
the tenants were spared what might otherwise have been rather a
shock at the contrast. The furniture, although very good of its
kind, was sombre, and moreover it was terribly scanty, for its
owner was far too busy in Seville to attend to his villa at
Orotava. But one glory the old house did certainly possess; its
garden, a veritable Eden of a garden; obsessed by a kind of
primitive urge towards all manner of procreation. It was hot with
sunshine and the flowing of sap, so that even its shade held a
warmth in its greenness, while the virile growth of its flowers and
its trees gave off a strangely disturbing fragrance. These trees
had long been a haven for birds, from the crested hoopoes to the
wild canaries who kept up a chorus of song in the branches.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen and Mary arrived at the Villa del Cipr&eacute;s, not
very long after Christmas. They had spent their Christmas Day
aboard ship, and on landing had stayed for a week at Santa Cruz
before taking the long, rough drive to Orotava. And as though the
fates were being propitious, or unpropitious perhaps&mdash;who
shall say?&mdash;the garden was looking its loveliest, almost
melodramatic it looked in the sunset. Mary gazed round her
wide-eyed with pleasure; but after a while her eyes must turn, as
they always did now, to rest upon Stephen; while Stephen's
uncertain and melancholy eyes must look back with great love in
their depths for Mary.</p>

<p>Together they made the tour of the villa, and when this was over
Stephen laughed a little: 'Not much of anything is there, Mary?'
'No, but quite enough. Who wants tables and chairs?'</p>

<p>'Well, if you're contented. I am,' Stephen told her. And indeed,
so far as the Villa del Cipr&eacute;s went, they were both very
well contented.</p>

<p>They discovered that the indoor staff would consist of two
peasants; a plump, smiling woman called Concha, who adhered to the
ancient tradition of the island and tied her head up in a white
linen kerchief, and a girl whose black hair was elaborately
dressed, and whose cheeks were very obviously
powdered&mdash;Concha's niece she was, by name Esmeralda. Esmeralda
looked cross, but this may have been because she squinted so
badly.</p>

<p>In the garden worked a handsome person called Ramon, together
with Pedro, a youth of sixteen. Pedro was light-hearted, precocious
and spotty. He hated his simple work in the garden; what he liked
was driving his father's mules for the tourists, according to
Ramon. Ramon spoke English passably well; he had picked it up from
the numerous tenants and was proud of this fact, so while bringing
in the luggage he paused now and then to impart information. It was
better to hire mules and donkeys from the father of Pedro&mdash;he
had very fine mules and donkeys. It was better to take Pedro and
none other as your guide, for thus would be saved any little
ill-feeling. It was better to let Concha do all the
shopping&mdash;she was honest and wise as the Blessed Virgin. It
was better never to scold Esmeralda, who was sensitive on account
of her squint and therefore inclined to be easily wounded. If you
wounded the heart of Esmeralda, she walked out of the house and
Concha walked with her. The island women were often like this; you
upset them and per Dios, your dinner would burn! They would not
even wait to attend to your dinner.</p>

<p>'You come home,' smiled Ramon, 'and you say, "What burns? Is my
villa on fire?" Then you call and you call. No answer...all gone!'
And he spread out his hands with a wide and distressingly empty
gesture.</p>

<p>Ramon said it was better to buy flowers from him: 'I cut fresh
from the garden when you want,' he coaxed gently. He spoke even his
broken English with the soft, rather sing-song drawl of the local
peasants.</p>

<p>'But aren't they our flowers?' inquired Mary, surprised.</p>

<p>Ramon shook his head: 'Yours to see, yours to touch, but not
yours to take, only mine to take&mdash;I sell them as part of my
little payment. But to you I sell very cheap, Se&ntilde;orita,
because you resemble the santa noche that makes our gardens smell
sweet at night. I will show you our beautiful santa noche.' He was
thin as a lath and as brown as a chestnut, and his shirt was quite
incredibly dirty; but when he walked he moved like a king on his
rough bare feet with their broken toenails. 'This evening I make
you a present of my flowers; I bring you a very big bunch of
tabachero,' he remarked.</p>

<p>Oh, you mustn't do that,' protested Mary, getting out her purse.
But Ramon looked offended: 'I have said it. I give you the
tabachero.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Their dinner consisted of a local fish fried in oil&mdash;the
fish had a very strange figure, and the oil, Stephen thought,
tasted slightly rancid; there was also a small though muscular
chicken. But Concha had provided large baskets of fruit; loquats
still warm from the tree that bred them, the full flavoured little
indigenous bananas, oranges sweet as though dripping honey, custard
apples and guavas had Concha provided, together with a bottle of
the soft yellow wine so dearly beloved of the island Spaniards.</p>

<p>Outside in the garden there was luminous darkness. The night had
a quality of glory about it, the blue glory peculiar to Africa and
seen seldom or never in our more placid climate. A warm breeze
stirred the eucalyptus trees and their crude, harsh smell was
persistently mingled with the thick scents of heliotrope and
datura, with the sweet but melancholy scent of jasmine, with the
faint, unmistakable odour of cypress. Stephen lit a cigarette:
Shall we go out, Mary?'</p>

<p>They stood for a minute looking up at the stars, so much larger
and brighter than stars seen in England. From a pond on the farther
side of the villa, came the queer, hoarse chirping of innumerable
frogs singing their prehistoric love songs. A star fell, shooting
swiftly earthward through the darkness.</p>

<p>Then the sweetness that was Mary seemed to stir and mingle with
the very urgent sweetness of that garden; with the dim, blue glory
of the African night, and with all the stars in their endless
courses, so that Stephen could have wept aloud as she stood there,
because of the words that must not be spoken. For now that this
girl was returning to health, her youth was becoming even more
apparent, and something in the quality of Mary's youth, something
terrible and ruthless as an unsheathed sword, would leap out at
such moments and stand between them.</p>

<p>Mary slipped a small, cool hand into Stephen's, and they walked
on towards the edge of the headland. For a long time they gazed out
over the sea, while their thoughts were always of one another. But
Mary's thoughts were not very coherent, and because she was filled
with a vague discontent, she sighed and moved even nearer to
Stephen, who suddenly put an arm round her shoulder.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'Are you tired, you little child?' And her husky
voice was infinitely gentle, so that Mary's eyes filled with sudden
tears.</p>

<p>She answered: 'I've waited a long, long time, all my
life&mdash;and now that I've found you at last, I can't get near
you. Why is it? Tell me.'</p>

<p>'Aren't you near? It seems to me you're quite near!' And Stephen
must smile in spite of herself.</p>

<p>'Yes, but you feel such a long way away.'</p>

<p>'That's because you're not only tired out but foolish!'</p>

<p>Yet they lingered; for when they returned to the villa they
would part, and they dreaded these moments of parting. Sometimes
they would suddenly remember the night before it had fallen, and
when this happened each would be conscious of a very great sadness
which their hearts would divine, the one from the other.</p>

<p>But presently Stephen took Mary's arm: 'I believe that big
star's moved over more than six inches I It's late&mdash;we must
have been out here for ages.' And she led the girl slowly back to
the villa.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>The days slipped by, days of splendid sunshine that gave bodily
health and strength to Mary. Her pale skin was tanned to a
healthful brown, and her eyes no longer looked heavy with
fatigue&mdash;only now their expression was seldom happy.</p>

<p>She and Stephen would ride far afield on their mules; they would
often ride right up into the mountains, climbing the hill to old
Orotava where the women sat at their green postigos through the
long, quiet hours of their indolent day and right on into the
evening. The walls of the town would be covered with flowers,
jasmine, plumbago and bougainvillea. But they would not linger in
old Orotava; pressing on they would climb always up and up to the
region of heath and trailing arbutus, and beyond that again to the
higher slopes that had once been the home of a mighty forest. Now,
only a few Spanish chestnut trees remained to mark the decline of
that forest.</p>

<p>Sometimes they took their luncheon along, and when they did this
young Pedro went with them, for he it was who must drive the mule
that carried Concha's ample lunch-basket. Pedro adored these
impromptu excursions, they made an excuse for neglecting the
garden. He would saunter along chewing blades of grass, or the stem
of some flower he had torn from a wall; or perhaps he would sing
softly under his breath, for he knew many songs of his native
island. But if the mule Celestino should stumble, or presume, in
his turn, to tear flowers from the wall, then Pedro would suddenly
cease his soft singing and shout guttural remarks to old Celestino:
Vaya, burro! Celestino, arre! Arre&mdash;boo!' he would shout with
a slap, so that Celestino must swallow his flowers in one angry
gulp, before having a sly kick at Pedro.</p>

<p>The lunch would be eaten in the cool upland air, while the
beasts stood near at hand, placidly grazing. Against a sky of
incredible blueness the Peak would gleam as though powdered with
crystal&mdash;Teide, mighty mountain of snow with the heart of fire
and the brow of crystal. Down the winding tracks would come goats
with their herds, the tinkle of goat-bells breaking the stillness.
And as all such things have seemed wonderful to lovers throughout
the ages, even so now they seemed very wonderful to Mary and
Stephen.</p>

<p>There were days when, leaving the uplands for the vale, they
would ride past the big banana plantations and the glowing acres of
ripe tomatoes. Geraniums and agaves would be growing side by side
in the black volcanic dust of the roadway. From the stretching
Valley of Orotava they would see the rugged line of the mountains.
The mountains would look blue, like the African nights, all save
Teide, clothed in her crystalline whiteness.</p>

<p>And now while they sat together in the garden at evening, there
would sometimes come beggars, singing; ragged fellows who played
deftly on their guitars and sang songs whose old melodies hailed
from Spain, but whose words sprang straight from the heart of the
island:</p>

<blockquote>A-a-a-y! Before I saw thee I was at peace,<br>
But now I am tormented because I have seen thee.<br>
Take away mine eyes, oh, enemy! Oh, beloved!<br>
Take away mine eyes, for they have turned me to fire.<br>
My blood is as the fire in the heart of Teide.<br>
A-a-a-y! Before I saw thee I was at peace.'</blockquote>

<p>The strange minor music with its restless rhythms, possessed a
very potent enchantment, so that the heart beat faster to hear it,
and the mind grew mazed with forbidden thoughts, and the soul grew
heavy with the infinite sadness of fulfilled desire; but the body
knew only the urge towards a complete fulfilment...A-a-a-y! Before
I saw thee I was at peace.'</p>

<p>They would not understand the soft Spanish words, and yet as
they sat there they could but divine their meaning, for love is no
slave of mere language. Mary would want Stephen to take her in her
arms, so must rest her cheek against Stephen's shoulder, as though
they two had a right to such music, had a right to their share in
the love songs of the world. But Stephen would always move away
quickly.</p>

<p>'Let's go in,' she would mutter; and her voice would sound
rough, for that bright sword of youth would have leapt out between
them.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>There came days when they purposely avoided each other, trying
to find peace in separation. Stephen would go for long rides alone,
leaving Mary to idle about the villa; and when she got back Mary
would not speak, but would wander away by herself to the garden.
For Stephen had grown almost harsh at times, possessed as she now
was by something like terror, since it seemed to her that what she
must say to this creature she loved would come as a death-blow,
that all youth and all joy would be slain in Mary.</p>

<p>Tormented in body and mind and spirit, she would push the girl
away from her roughly: 'Leave me alone, I can't bear any more!'
'Stephen&mdash;I don't understand. Do you hate me?'</p>

<p>'Hate your Of course you don't understand&mdash;only, I tell you
I simply can't bear it.'</p>

<p>They would stare at each other pale-faced and shaken.</p>

<p>The long nights became even harder to endure, for now they would
feel so terribly divided. Their days would be heavy with
misunderstandings, their nights filled with doubts, apprehensions
and longings. They would often have parted as enemies, and therein
would lie the great loneliness of it.</p>

<p>As time went on they grew deeply despondent, their despondency
robbing the sun of its brightness, robbing the little goat-bells of
their music, robbing the dark of its luminous glory. The songs of
the beggars who sang in the garden at the hour when the santa noche
smelt sweetest, those songs would seem full of a cruel jibing:
A-a-a-y! Before I saw thee I was at peace, but now I am tormented
because I have seen thee.'</p>

<p>Thus were all things becoming less good in their sight, less
perfect because of their own frustration.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>6</b>
</p>

<p>But Mary Llewellyn was no coward and no weakling, and one night,
at long last, pride came to her rescue. She said: 'I want to speak
to you, Stephen.'</p>

<p>'Not now, it's so late&mdash;tomorrow morning.'</p>

<p>'No, now.' And she followed Stephen into her bedroom.</p>

<p>For a moment they avoided each other's eyes, then Mary began to
talk rather fast: 'I can't stay. It's all been a heart-breaking
mistake. I thought you wanted me because you cared. I
thought&mdash;oh, I don't know what I thought&mdash;but I won't
accept your charity, Stephen, not now that you've grown to hate me
like this&mdash;I'm going back home to England. I forced myself on
you. I asked you to take me. I must have been mad; you just took me
out of pity; you thought that I was ill and you felt sorry for me.
Well, now I'm not ill and not mad any more, and I'm going. Every
time I come near you you shrink or push me away as though I
repelled you. But I want us to part quickly because...' Her voice
broke: 'because it torments me to be always with you and to feel
that you've literally grown to hate me. I can't stand it; I'd
rather not see you, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Stephen stared at her, white and aghast. Then all in a moment
the restraint of years was shattered as though by some mighty
convulsion. She remembered nothing, was conscious of nothing except
that the creature she loved was going.</p>

<p>'You child,' she gasped, 'you don't understand, you can't
understand&mdash;God help me, I love you!' And now she had the girl
in her arms and was kissing her eyes and her mouth:
'Mary...Mary...They stood there lost to all sense of time, to all
sense of reason, to all things save each other, in the grip of what
can be one of the most relentless of all the human emotions.</p>

<p>Then Stephen's arms suddenly fell to her side: 'Stop, stop for
God's sake&mdash;you've got to listen.'</p>

<p>Oh, but now she must pay to the uttermost farthing for the
madness that had left those words unspoken&mdash;even as her father
had paid before her. With Mary's kisses still hot on her lips, she
must pay and pay unto the uttermost farthing. And because of an
anguish that seemed past endurance, she spoke roughly; the words
when they came were cruel. She spared neither the girl who must
listen to them, nor herself who must force her to stand there and
listen.</p>

<p>'Have you understood? Do you realize now what it's going to mean
if you give yourself to me?' Then she stopped abruptly...Mary was
crying.</p>

<p>Stephen said, and her voice had grown quite toneless: 'It's too
much to ask&mdash;you're right; it's too much. I had to tell
you&mdash;forgive me, Mary.'</p>

<p>But Mary turned on her with very bright eyes: 'You can say
that&mdash;you, who talk about loving! What do I care for all
you've told me? What do I care for the world's opinion? What do I
care for anything but you, and you just as you are&mdash;as you
are, I love you! Do you think I'm crying because of what you've
told me? I'm crying because of your dear, scarred face...the misery
on it...Can't you understand that all that I am belongs to you,
Stephen?' Stephen bent down and kissed Mary's hands very humbly,
for now she could find no words any more...and that night they were
not divided.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>A strange, though to them a very natural thing it seemed, this
new and ardent fulfilment; having something fine and urgent about
it that lay almost beyond the range of their wills. Something
primitive and age-old as Nature herself, did their love appear to
Mary and Stephen. For now they were in the grip of Creation, of
Creation's terrific urge to create; the urge that will sometimes
sweep forward blindly alike into fruitful and sterile channels.
That wellnigh intolerable life force would grip them, making them a
part of its own existence; so that they who might never create a
new life, were yet one at such moments with the fountain of
living...Oh, great and incomprehensible unreason!</p>

<p>But beyond the bounds of this turbulent river would lie gentle
and most placid harbours of refuge; harbours in which the body
could repose with contentment, while the lips spoke low, indolent
words, and the eyes beheld a dim, golden haze that blinded the
while it revealed all beauty. Then Stephen would stretch out her
hand and touch Mary where she lay, happy only to feel her nearness.
The hours would slip by towards dawn or sunset; flowers would open
and dose in the bountiful garden; and perhaps, if it should chance
to be evening, beggars would come to that garden, singing; ragged
fellows who played deftly on their guitars and sang songs whose old
melodies hailed from Spain, but whose words sprang straight from
the heart of the island:</p>

<blockquote>'Oh, thou whom I love, thou art small and
guileless;<br>
Thy lips are as cool as the sea at moonrise.<br>
But after the moon there cometh the sun;<br>
After the evening there cometh the morning.<br>
The sea is warmed by the kiss of the sun,<br>
Even so shall my kisses bring warmth to thy lips,<br>
Oh, thou whom I love, thou art small and guileless.'</blockquote>

<p>And now Mary need no longer sigh with unrest, need no longer lay
her cheek against Stephen's shoulder; for her rightful place was in
Stephen's arms and there she would be, overwhelmed by the peace
that conies at such times to all happy lovers. They would sit
together in a little arbour that looked out over miles upon miles
of ocean. The water would flush with the after-glow, then change to
a soft, indefinite purple; then, fired anew by the African night,
would gleam with that curious, deep blue glory for a space before
the swift rising of the moon. Thy lips are as cool as the sea at
moonrise; but after the moon there cometh the sun.'</p>

<p>And Stephen as she held the girl in her arms, would feel that
indeed she was all things to Mary; father, mother, friend and
lover, all things; and Mary all things to her&mdash;the child, the
friend, the beloved, all things. But Mary, because she was perfect
woman, would rest without thought, without exultation, without
question; finding no need to question since for her there was now
only one thing&mdash;Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Time, that most ruthless enemy of lovers, strode callously
forward into the spring. It was March, so that down at the noisy
Puerto the bougainvilleas were in their full glory, while up in the
old town of Orotava bloomed great laden bushes of white camellias.
In the garden of the villa the orange trees flowered, and the
little arbour that looked over the sea was covered by an ancient
wistaria vine whose mighty trunk was as thick as three saplings.
But in spite of a haunting shadow of regret at the thought of
leaving Orotava, Stephen was deeply and thankfully happy. A
happiness such as she had never conceived could be hers now
possessed her body and soul&mdash;and Mary also was happy.</p>

<p>Stephen would ask her: 'Do I content you? Tell me, is there
anything you want in the world?'</p>

<p>Mary's answer was always the same; she would say very gravely:
'Only you, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Ramon had begun to speculate about them, these two Englishwomen
who were so devoted. He would shrug his shoulders&mdash;Dios! What
did it matter? They were courteous to him and exceedingly generous.
If the elder one had an ugly red scar down her cheek, the younger
one seemed not to mind it. The younger one was beautiful though, as
beautiful as the santa noche...some day she would get a real man to
love her.</p>

<p>As for Concha and the cross-eyed Esmeralda, their tongues were
muted by their ill-gotten gains. They grew rich, thanks to
Stephen's complete indifference to the price of such trifles as
sugar and candles.</p>

<p>Esmeralda's afflicted eyes were quite sharp, yet she said to
Concha: 'I see less than nothing.'</p>

<p>And Concha answered: 'I also see nothing; it is better to
suppose that there is nothing to see. They are wealthy and the big
one is very careless&mdash;she trusts me completely and I do my
utmost. She is so taken up with the amighita that I really believe
I could easily rob her! Quien saber They are certainly queer those
two&mdash;however, I am blind, it is better so; and in any case
they are only the English!'</p>

<p>But Pedro was very sorely afflicted, for Pedro had fallen in
love with Mary, and now he must stay at home in the garden when she
and Stephen rode up to the mountains. Now they wished to be all
alone it seemed, and what food they took would be stuffed into a
pocket. It was spring and Pedro was deeply enamoured, so that he
sighed as he tended the roses, sighed and stubbed the hard earth
with his toes, and made insolent faces at the good-tempered Ramon,
and killed flies with a kind of grim desperation, and sang songs of
longing under his breath: 'A-a-a-y! Thou art to me as the mountain.
Would I could melt thy virginal snows...</p>

<p>'Would I could kick thy behind!' grinned Ramon.</p>

<p>One evening Mary asked Pedro to sing, speaking to him in her
halting Spanish. So Pedro went off and got his guitar; but when he
must stand there and sing before Mary he could only stammer a
childish old song having in it nothing of passion and longing:</p>

<blockquote>'I was born on a reef that is washed by the sea;<br>
It is a part of Spain that is called Teneriffe.<br>
I was born on a reef...</blockquote>

<p>sang the unhappy Pedro.</p>

<p>Stephen felt sorry for the lanky boy with the lovesick eyes, and
so to console him she offered him money, ten pesetas&mdash;for she
knew that these people set much store by money. But Pedro seemed to
have grown very tall as he gently but firmly refused consolation.
Then he suddenly burst into tears and fled, leaving his little
guitar behind him.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The days were too short, as were now the nights&mdash;those
spring nights of soft heat and incredible moonlight. And because
they both felt that something was passing, they would turn their
minds to thoughts of the future. The future was drawing very near
to the present; in less than three weeks they must start for
Paris.</p>

<p>Mary would suddenly cling to Stephen: 'Say that you'll never
leave me, beloved!'</p>

<p>'How could I leave you and go on living?'</p>

<p>Thus their talk of the future would often drift into talk of
love, that is always timeless. On their lips, as in their hearts,
would be words such as countless other lovers had spoken, for love
is the sweetest monotony that was ever conceived of by the
Creator.</p>

<p>'Promise you'll never stop loving me, Stephen.'</p>

<p>'Never. You know that I couldn't, Mary.'</p>

<p>Even to themselves their vows would sound foolish, because so
inadequate to compass their meaning. Language is surely too small
to contain those emotions of mind and body that have somehow
awakened a response in the spirit.</p>

<p>And now when they climbed the long hill to the town of old
Orotava on their way to the mountains, they would pause to examine
certain flowers minutely, or to stare down the narrow, shadowy
by-streets. And when they had reached the cool upland places, and
their mules were loosed and placidly grazing, they would sit hand
in hand looking out at the Peak, trying to impress such pictures on
their minds, because all things pass and they wished to remember.
The goat-bells would break the lovely stillness, together with the
greater stillness of their dreaming. But the sound of the bells
would be lovely also, a part of their dreaming, a part of the
stillness; for all things would seem to be welded together, to be
one, even as they two were now one.</p>

<p>They no longer felt desolate, hungry outcasts; unloved and
unwanted, despised of the world. They were lovers who walked in the
vineyard of life, plucking the warm, sweet fruits of that vineyard.
Love had lifted them up as on wings of fire, had made them
courageous, invincible, enduring. Nothing could be lacking to those
who loved&mdash;the very earth gave of her fullest bounty. The
earth seemed to come alive in response to the touch of their
healthful and eager bodies&mdash;nothing could be lacking to those
who loved.</p>

<p>And thus in a cloud of illusion and glory, sped the last
enchanted days at Orotava.</p>

<h2>BOOK FIVE</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>Chapter Forty</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Early in April Stephen and Mary returned to the house in Paris.
This second home-coming seemed wonderfully sweet by reason of its
peaceful and happy completeness, so that they turned to smile at
each other as they passed through the door, and Stephen said very
softly:</p>

<p>'Welcome home, Mary.'</p>

<p>And now for the first time the old house was home. Mary went
quickly from room to room humming a little tune as she did so,
feeling that she saw with a new understanding the inanimate objects
which filled those rooms&mdash;were they not Stephen's? Every now
and again she must pause to touch them because they were Stephen's.
Then she turned and went into Stephen's bedroom; not timidly,
dreading to be unwelcome, but quite without fear or restraint or
shyness, and this gave her a warm little glow of pleasure.</p>

<p>Stephen was busily grooming her hair with a couple of brushes
that had been dipped in water. The water had darkened her hair in
patches, but had deepened the wide wave above her forehead. Seeing
Mary in the glass she did not turn round, but just smiled for a
moment at their two reflections. Mary sat down in an arm-chair and
watched her, noticing the strong, thin line of her thighs; noticing
too the curve of her breasts&mdash;slight and compact, of a certain
beauty. She had taken off her jacket and looked very tall in her
soft silk shirt and her skirt of dark serge.</p>

<p>Tired?' she inquired, glancing down at the girl.</p>

<p>'No, not a bit tired,' smiled Mary.</p>

<p>Stephen walked over to the stationary basin and proceeded to
wash her hands under the tap, spotting her white silk cuffs in the
process. Going to the cupboard she got out a clean shirt, slipped
in a pair of simple gold cuff-links, and changed; after which she
put on a new necktie.</p>

<p>Mary said: 'Who's been looking after your clothes&mdash;sewing
on buttons and that sort of thing?'</p>

<p>'I don't know exactly&mdash;Puddle or Ad&egrave;le. Why?'</p>

<p>'Because I'm going to do it in future. You'll find that I've got
one very real talent, and that's darning. When I darn the place
looks like a basket, criss-cross. And I know how to pick up a
ladder as well as the Invisible Mending people! It's very important
that the darns should be smooth, otherwise when you fence they
might give you a blister.'</p>

<p>Stephen's lips twitched a little, but she said quite gravely:
'Thanks awfully, darling, we'll go over my stockings.'</p>

<p>From the dressing-room next door came a series of thuds; Pierre
was depositing Stephen's luggage. Getting up, Mary opened the
wardrobe, revealing a long, neat line of suits hanging from heavy
mahogany shoulders&mdash;she examined each suit in turn with great
interest. Presently she made her way to the cupboard in the wall;
it was fitted with sliding shelves, and these she pulled out one by
one with precaution. On the shelves there were orderly piles of
shirts, cr&ecirc;pe de Chine pyjamas&mdash;quite a goodly
assortment, and the heavy silk masculine underwear that for several
years now had been worn by Stephen. Finally she discovered the
stockings where they lay by themselves in the one long drawer, and
these she proceeded to unfurl deftly, with a quick and slightly
important movement. Thrusting a fist into toes and heels she looked
for the holes that were non-existent.</p>

<p>'You must have paid a lot for these stockings, they're
hand-knitted silk,' murmured Mary gravely.</p>

<p>'I forget what I paid&mdash;Puddle got them from England.'</p>

<p>Who did she order them from; do you know?'</p>

<p>'I can't remember; some woman or other.'</p>

<p>But Mary persisted: 'I shall want her address.'</p>

<p>Stephen smiled: 'Why? Are you going to order my stockings?'
'Darling! Do you think I'll let you go barefoot? Of course I'm
going to order your stockings.'</p>

<p>Stephen rested her elbow on the mantelpiece and stood gazing at
Mary with her chin on her hand. As she did so she was struck once
again by the look of youth that was characteristic of Mary. She
looked much less than her twenty-two years in her simple dress with
its leather belt&mdash;she looked indeed little more than a
schoolgirl. And yet there was something quite new in her face, a
soft, wise expression that Stephen had put there, so that she
suddenly felt pitiful to see her so young yet so full of this
wisdom; for sometimes the coming of passion to youth, in spite of
its glory, will be strangely pathetic.</p>

<p>Mary rolled up the stockings with a sigh of regret; alas, they
would not require darning. She was at the stage of being in love
when she longed to do womanly tasks for Stephen. But all Stephen's
clothes were discouragingly neat; Mary thought that she must be
very well served, which was true&mdash;she was served, as are
certain men, with a great deal of nicety and care by the
servants.</p>

<p>And now Stephen was filling her cigarette case from the big box
that lived on her dressing-table; and now she was strapping on her
gold wrist watch; and now she was brushing some dust from her coat;
and now she was frowning at herself in the glass for a second as
she twitched her immaculate necktie. Mary had seen her do all this
before, many times, but to-day somehow it was different, for to-day
they were in their own home together, so that these little intimate
things seemed more dear than they had done in Orotava. The bedroom
could only have belonged to Stephen; a large, airy room, very
simply furnished&mdash;white walls, old oak, and a wide, bricked
hearth on which some large, friendly logs were burning. The bed
could only have been Stephen's bed; it was heavy and rather austere
in pattern. It looked solemn as Mary had seen Stephen look, and was
covered by a bedspread of old blue brocade, otherwise it remained
quite guiltless of trimmings. The chairs could only have been
Stephen's chairs; a little reserved, not conducive to lounging. The
dressing-table could only have been hers, with its tall silver
mirror and ivory brushes. And all these things had drawn into
themselves a species of life derived from their owner, until they
seemed to be thinking of Stephen with a dumbness that made their
thoughts more insistent, and their thoughts gathered strength and
mingled with Mary's so that she heard herself cry out: 'Stephen!'
in a voice that was not very far from tears, because of the joy she
felt in that name.</p>

<p>And Stephen answered her: Mary&mdash;'</p>

<p>Then they stood very still, grown abruptly silent. And each of
them felt a little afraid, for the realization of great mutual love
can at times be so overwhelming a thing, that even the bravest of
hearts may grow fearful. And although they could not have put it
into words, could not have explained it to themselves or to each
other, they seemed at that moment to be looking beyond the
turbulent flood of earthly passion; to be looking straight into the
eyes of a love that was changed&mdash;a love made perfect,
discarnate.</p>

<p>But the moment passed and they drew together...</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The spring they had left behind in Orotava overtook them quite
soon, and one day there it was blowing softly along the old streets
of the Quarter&mdash;the Rue de Seine, the Rue des Saints Peres,
the Rue Bonaparte and their own Rue Jacob. And who can resist the
first spring days in Paris? Brighter than ever looked the patches
of sky when glimpsed between rows of tall, flat-bosomed houses.
From the Pont des Arts could be seen a river that was one wide,
ingratiating smile of sunshine; while beyond in the Rue des Petits
Champs, spring ran up and down the Passage Choiseul, striking
gleams of gold from its dirty glass roof&mdash;the roof that looks
like the vertebral column of some prehistoric monster.</p>

<p>All over the Bois there was bursting of buds&mdash;a positive
orgy of growth and greenness. The miniature waterfall lifted its
voice in an effort to roar as loud as Niagara. Birds sang. Dogs
yapped or barked or bayed according to their size and the tastes of
their owners. Children appeared in the Champs Elys&eacute;es with
bright coloured balloons which tried to escape and which, given the
ghost of a chance, always did so. In the Tuileries Gardens boys
with brown legs and innocent socks were hiring toy boats from the
man who provided Bateaux de Location. The fountains tossed clouds
of spray into the air, and just for fun made an occasional rainbow;
then the Arc de Triomphe would be seen through an arc that was,
thanks to the sun, even more triumphal. As for the very old lady in
her kiosk&mdash;the one who sells bocks, groseille, limonade, and
such simple food-stuffs as brioches and croissants&mdash;as for
her, she appeared in a new frilled bonnet and a fine worsted shawl
on one memorable Sunday. Smiling she was too, from ear to ear, in
spite of the fact that her mouth was toothless, for this fact she
only remembered in winter when the east wind started her empty gums
aching.</p>

<p>Under the quiet, grey wings of the MAd&egrave;leine the
flower-stalls were bright with the glory of God&mdash;anemones,
jonquils, daffodils, tulips; mimosa that left gold dust on the
fingers, and the faintly perfumed ascetic white lilac that had come
in the train from the Riviera. There were also hyacinths, pink, red
and blue, and many small trees of sturdy azalea.</p>

<p>Oh, but the spring was shouting through Paris! It was in the
hearts and the eyes of the people. The very dray-horses jangled
their bells more loudly because of the spring in their drivers. The
debauched old taxis tooted their horns and spun round the corners
as though on a race track. Even such glacial things as the diamonds
in the Rue de la Paix, were kindled to fire as the sun pierced
their facets right through to their entrails; while the sapphires
glowed as those African nights had glowed in the garden at
Orotava.</p>

<p>Was it likely that Stephen could finish her book&mdash;she who
had Paris in springtime with Mary? Was it likely that Mary could
urge her to do so&mdash;she who had Paris in springtime with
Stephen? There was so much to see, so much to show Mary, so many
new things to discover together. And now Stephen felt grateful to
Jonathan Brockett who had gone to such pains to teach her her
Paris.</p>

<p>Idle she was, let it not be denied, idle and happy and utterly
carefree. A lover, who, like many another before her, was under the
spell of the loved one's existence. She would wake in the mornings
to find Mary beside her, and all through the day she would keep
beside Mary, and at night they would lie in each other's
arms&mdash;God alone knows who shall dare judge of such matters; in
any case Stephen was too much bewitched to be troubled just then by
hair-splitting problems.</p>

<p>Life had become a new revelation. The most mundane things were
invested with glory; shopping with Mary who needed quite a number
of dresses. And then there was food that was eaten
together&mdash;the careful perusal of wine-card and menu. They
would lunch or have dinner at Lap&eacute;rouse; surely still the
most epicurean restaurant in the whole of an epicurean city. So
humble it looks with its modest entrance on the Quai des Grands
Augustins; so humble that a stranger might well pass it by
unnoticed, but not so Stephen, who had been there with
Brockett.</p>

<p>Mary loved Prunier's in the Rue Duphot, because of its galaxy of
sea-monsters. A whole counter there was of incredible
creatures&mdash;Our sins, black armoured and covered with prickles;
Bigornaux, serpent-like Anguilles Fum&eacute;es; and many other
exciting things that Stephen mistrusted for English stomachs. They
would sit at their own particular table, one of the tables upstairs
by the window, for the manager came very quickly to know them and
would smile and bow grandly: 'Bon jour, mesdames.' When they left,
the attendant who kept the flower-basket would give Mary a neat
little bouquet of roses: 'Au revoir, mesdames. Merci
bien&mdash;&agrave; bient&ocirc;t!' For everyone had pretty manners
at Prunier's.</p>

<p>A few people might stare at the tall, scarred woman in her
well-tailored clothes and black slouch hat. They would stare first
at her and then at her companion: 'Mais regardez moi &ccedil;a!
Elle est belle, la petite; comme c'est rigolo There would be a few
smiles, but on the whole they would attract little notice&mdash;ils
en ont vu bien d'autres&mdash;it was post-war Paris.</p>

<p>Sometimes, having dined, they would saunter towards home through
streets that were crowded with others who sauntered&mdash;men and
woman, a couple of women together&mdash;always twos&mdash;the fine
nights seemed prolific of couples. In the air there would be the
inconsequent feeling that belongs to the night life of most great
cities, above all to the careless night life of Paris, where
problems are apt to vanish with sunset. The lure of the brightly
lighted boulevards, the lure of the dim and mysterious by-streets
would grip them so that they would not turn homeward for quite a
long while, but would just go on walking. The moon, less clear than
at Orotava, less innocent doubtless, yet scarcely less lovely,
would come sailing over the Place de la Concorde, staring down at
the dozens of other white moons that had managed to get themselves
caught by the standards. In the caf&eacute;s would be crowds of
indolent people, for the French who work hard know well how to
idle; and these caf&eacute;s would smell of hot coffee and sawdust,
of rough, strong tobacco, of men and women. Beneath the arcades
there would be the shop windows, illuminated and bright with
temptation. But Mary would usually stare into Sulka's, picking out
scarves or neckties for Stephen.</p>

<p>'That one! We'll come and buy it tomorrow. Oh, Stephen, do
wait&mdash;look at that dressing-gown!'</p>

<p>And Stephen might laugh and pretend to be bored, though she
secretly nurtured a weakness for Sulka's.</p>

<p>Down the Rue de Rivoli they would walk arm in arm, until turning
at last, they would pass the old church of St. Germain&mdash;the
church from whose Gothic tower had been rung the first call to a
most bloody slaying. But now that tower would be grim with silence,
dreaming the composite dreams of Paris&mdash;dreams that were heavy
with blood and beauty, with innocence and lust, with joy and
despair, with life and death, with heaven and hell; all the curious
composite dreams of Paris.</p>

<p>Then crossing the river they would reach the Quarter and their
house, where Stephen would slip her latchkey into the door and
would know the warm feeling that can come of a union between door
and latchkey. With a sigh of contentment they would find themselves
at home once again in the quiet old Rue Jacob.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>They went to see the kind Mademoiselle Duphot, and this visit
seemed momentous to Mary. She gazed with something almost like awe
at the woman who had had the teaching of Stephen.</p>

<p>'Oh, but yes,' smiled Mademoiselle Duphot, 'I teached her. She
was terribly naughty over her dict&eacute;e; she would write
remarks about the poor Henri&mdash;tr&egrave;s impertinente she
would be about Henri! St&eacute;venne was a queer little child and
naughty&mdash;but so dear, so dear&mdash;I could never scold her.
With me she done everything her own way.'</p>

<p>'Please tell me about that time,' coaxed Mary.</p>

<p>So Mademoiselle Duphot sat down beside Mary and patted her hand:
'Like me, you love her. Well now, let me recall&mdash;She would
sometimes get angry, very angry, and then she would go to the
stables and talk to her horse. But when she fence it was
marvellous&mdash;she fence like a man, and she only a baby but
extr&ecirc;mement strong. And then...</p>

<p>The memories went on and on, such a store she possessed, the
kind Mademoiselle Duphot.</p>

<p>As she talked her heart went out to the girl, for she felt a
great tenderness towards young things: 'I am glad that you come to
live with our St&eacute;venne now that Mademoiselle Puddle is at
Morton. St&eacute;venne would be desolate in the big house. It is
charming for both of you this new arrangement. While she work you
look after the m&eacute;nage, is it not so? You take care of
St&eacute;venne, she take care of you. Oui, oui, I am glad you have
come to Paris.'</p>

<p>Julie stroked Mary's smooth young cheek, then her arm, for she
wished to observe through her fingers. She smiled: 'Very young,
also very kind. I like so much the feel of your kindness&mdash;it
gives me a warm and so happy sensation, because with all kindness
there must be much good.'</p>

<p>Was she quite blind after all, the poor Julie?</p>

<p>And hearing her Stephen flushed with pleasure, and her eyes that
could see turned and rested on Mary with a gentle and very profound
expression in their depths&mdash;at that moment they were calmly
thoughtful, as though brooding upon the mystery of life&mdash;one
might almost have said the eyes of a mother.</p>

<p>A happy and pleasant visit it had been; they talked about it all
through the evening.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>Chapter Forty-one</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Burton, who had enlisted in the Worcesters soon after Stephen
had found work in London, Burton was now back again in Paris,
loudly demanding a brand-new motor.</p>

<p>'The car looks awful! Snub-nosed she
looks&mdash;peculiar&mdash;all tucked up in the bonnet,' he
declared.</p>

<p>So Stephen bought a touring Renault and a smart little
landaulette for Mary. The choosing of the cars was the greatest
fun; Mary climbed in and out of hers at least six times while it
stood in the showroom.</p>

<p>'Is it comfortable?' Stephen must keep on asking. 'Do you want
them to pad it out more at the back? Are you perfectly sure you
like the grey whip-cord? Because if you don't it can be
re-upholstered.'</p>

<p>Mary laughed: 'I'm climbing in and out from sheer swank, just to
show that it's mine. Will they send it soon?'</p>

<p>'Almost at once, I hope,' smiled Stephen.</p>

<p>Very splendid it seemed to her now to have money, because of
what money could do for Mary; in the shops they must sometimes
behave like two children, having endless things dragged out for
inspection. They drove to Versailles in the new touring car and
wandered for hours through the lovely gardens. The Hameau no longer
seemed sad to Stephen, for Mary and she brought love back to the
Hameau. Then they drove to the forest of Fontainebleau, and
wherever they went there was singing of birds&mdash;challenging,
jubilant, provocative singing: 'Look at us, look at us! We're
happy, Stephen!' And Stephen's heart shouted back: 'So are we. Look
at us, look at us, look at us. We're happy!'</p>

<p>When they were not driving into the country, or amusing
themselves by ransacking Paris, Stephen would fence, to keep
herself fit&mdash;would fence as never before with Buisson, so that
Buisson would sometimes say with a grin:</p>

<p>'Mais voyons, voyons! I have done you no wrong, yet it almost
appears that you wish to kill me!'</p>

<p>The foils laid aside, he might turn to Mary, still grinning:
'She fence very well, eh, your friend? She lunge like a man, so
strong and so graceful.' Which considering all things was generous
of Buisson. But suddenly Buisson would grow very angry: 'More than
seventy francs have I paid to my cook and for nothing! Bon Dieu! Is
this winning the war? We starve, we go short of our butter and
chickens, and before it is better it is surely much worse. We are
all imbeciles, we kind-hearted French; we starve ourselves to
fatten the Germans. Are they grateful? Sacr&eacute; Nom! Mais oui,
they are grateful&mdash;they love us so much that they spit in our
faces!' And quite often this mood would be vented on Stephen.</p>

<p>To Mary, however, he was usually polite: 'You like our Paris? I
am glad&mdash;that is good. You make the home with Mademoiselle
Gordon; I hope you prevent her injurious smoking.'</p>

<p>And in spite of his outbursts Mary adored him, because of his
interest in Stephen's fencing.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>One evening towards the end of June, Jonathan Brockett walked in
serenely: 'Hallo, Stephen! Here I am, I've turned up
again&mdash;not that I love you, I positively hate you. I've been
keeping away for weeks and weeks. Why did you never answer my
letters? Not so much as a line on a picture postcard! There's
something in this more than meets the eye. And where's Puddle? She
used to be kind to me once&mdash;I shall lay my head down on her
bosom and weep...' He stopped abruptly, seeing Mary Llewellyn, who
got up from her deep arm-chair in the corner.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'Mary, this is Jonathan Brockett&mdash;an old
friend of mine; we're fellow writers. Brockett, this is Mary
Llewellyn.' Brockett shot a swift glance in Stephen's direction,
then he bowed and gravely shook hands with Mary.</p>

<p>And now Stephen was to see yet another side of this strange and
unexpected creature. With infinite courtesy and tact he went out of
his way to make himself charming. Never by so much as a word or a
look did he once allow it to be inferred that his quick mind had
seized on the situation. Brockett's manner suggested an innocence
that he was very far from possessing.</p>

<p>Stephen began to study him with interest; they two had not met
since before the war. He had thickened, his figure was more robust,
there was muscle and flesh on his wide, straight shoulders. And she
thought that his face had certainly aged; little bags were showing
under his eyes, and rather deep lines at the sides of his
mouth&mdash;the war had left its mark upon Brockett. Only his hands
remained unchanged; those white and soft-skinned hands of a
woman.</p>

<p>He was saying: 'So you two were in the same Unit. That was a
great stroke of luck for Stephen; I mean she'd be feeling horribly
lonely now that old Puddle's gone back to England. Stephen's
distinguished herself I see&mdash;the Croix de Guerre and a very
becoming scar. Don't protest, my dear Stephen, you know it's
becoming. All that happened to me was a badly sprained ankle'; he
laughed, 'fancy going out to Mesopotamia to slip on a bit of orange
peel! I might have done better than that here in Paris. By the way,
I'm in my own flat again now; I hope you'll bring Miss Llewellyn to
luncheon.'</p>

<p>He did not stay embarrassingly late, nor did he leave
suggestively early; he got up to go just at the right moment. But
when Mary went out of the room to call Pierre, he quite suddenly
put his arm through Stephen's.</p>

<p>'Good luck, my dear, you deserve it,' he murmured, and his sharp
grey eyes had grown almost gentle: 'I hope you'll be very, very
happy.'</p>

<p>Stephen quietly disengaged her arm with a look of surprise:
'Happy? Thank you, Brockett,' she smiled, as she lighted a
cigarette.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>They could not tear themselves away from their home, and that
summer they remained in Paris. There were always so many things to
do, Mary's bedroom entirely to refurnish for instance&mdash;she had
Puddle's old room overlooking the garden. When the city seemed to
be growing too airless, they motored off happily into the country,
spending a couple of nights at an auberge, for France abounds in
green, pleasant places. Once or twice they lunched with Jonathan
Brockett at his flat in the Avenue Victor Hugo, a beautiful flat
since his taste was perfect, and he dined with them before leaving
for Deauville&mdash;his manner continued to be studiously guarded.
The Duphots had gone for their holiday and Buisson was away in
Spain for a month&mdash;but what did they want that summer with
people? On those evenings when they did not go out, Stephen would
now read aloud to Mary, leading the girl's adaptable mind into new
and hitherto unexplored channels; teaching her the joy that can lie
in books, even as Sir Philip had once taught his daughter. Mary had
read so little in her life that the choice of books seemed
practically endless, but Stephen must make a start by reading that
immortal classic of their own Paris, Peter Ibbetson, and Mary
said:</p>

<p>'Stephen&mdash;if we were ever parted, do you think that you and
I could dream true?'</p>

<p>And Stephen answered: 'I often wonder whether we're not dreaming
true all the time&mdash;whether the only truth isn't in dreaming.'
Then they talked for a while of such nebulous things as dreams,
which will seem very concrete to lovers.</p>

<p>Sometimes Stephen would read aloud in French, for she wanted the
girl to grow better acquainted with the lure of that fascinating
language. And thus gradually, with infinite care, did she seek to
fill the more obvious gaps in Mary's none too complete education.
And Mary, listening to Stephen's voice, rather deep and always a
little husky, would think that words were more tuneful than music
and more inspiring, when spoken by Stephen.</p>

<p>At this time many gentle and friendly things began to bear
witness to Mary's presence. There were flowers in the quiet old
garden for instance, and some large red carp in the fountain's
basin, and two married couples of white fan-tail pigeons who lived
in a house on a tall wooden leg and kept up a convivial cooing.
These pigeons lacked all respect for Stephen; by August they were
flying in at her window and landing with soft, heavy thuds on her
desk, where they strutted until she fed them with maize. And
because they were Mary's and Mary loved them, Stephen would laugh,
as unruffled as they were, and would patiently coax them back into
the garden with bribes for their plump little circular crops. In
the turret room that had been Puddle's sanctum, there were now
three cagefuls of Mary's rescues&mdash;tiny bright-coloured birds
with dejected plumage, and eyes that had filmed from a lack of
sunshine. Mary was always bringing them home from the terrible bird
shops along the river, for her love of such helpless and suffering
things was so great that she in turn must suffer. An ill-treated
creature would haunt her for days, so that Stephen would often
exclaim half in earnest:</p>

<p>'Go and buy up all the animal shops in Paris...anything,
darling, only don't look unhappy!'</p>

<p>The tiny bright-coloured birds would revive to some extent
thanks to Mary's skilled treatment; but since she always bought the
most ailing, not a few of them left this disheartening world for
what we must hope was a warm, wild heaven&mdash;there were several
small graves already in the garden.</p>

<p>Then one morning, when Mary went out alone because Stephen had
letters to write to Morton, she chanced on yet one more desolate
creature who followed her home to the Rue Jacob, and right into
Stephen's immaculate study. It was large, ungainly and appallingly
thin; it was coated with mud which had dried on its nose, its back,
its legs and all over its stomach. Its paws were heavy, its ears
were long, and its tail, like the tail of a rat, looked hairless,
but curved up to a point in a miniature sickle. Its face was as
smooth as though made out of plush, and its luminous eyes were the
colour of amber.</p>

<p>Mary said: 'Oh, Stephen&mdash;he wanted to come. He's got a sore
paw; look at him, he's limping!'</p>

<p>Then this tramp of a dog hobbled over to the table and stood
there gazing dumbly at Stephen, who must stroke his anxious,
dishevelled head: 'I suppose this means that we're going to keep
him.'</p>

<p>'Darling, I'm dreadfully afraid it does&mdash;he says he's sorry
to be such a mongrel.'</p>

<p>'He needn't apologize,' Stephen smiled, 'he's all right, he's an
Irish water-spaniel, though what he's doing out here the Lord
knows; I've never seen one before in Paris.'</p>

<p>They fed him, and later that afternoon they gave him a bath in
Stephen's bathroom. The result of that bath, which was
disconcerting as far as the room went, they left to Ad&egrave;le.
The room was a bog, but Mary's rescue had emerged a mass of
chocolate ringlets, all save his charming plush-covered face, and
his curious tail, which was curved like a sickle. Then they bound
the sore pad and took him downstairs; after which Mary wanted to
know all about him, so Stephen unearthed an illustrated dog book
from a cupboard under the study book-case.</p>

<p>'Oh, look!' exclaimed Mary, reading over her shoulder, 'He's not
Irish at all, he's really a Welshman: "We find in the Welsh laws of
Howell Dda the first reference to this intelligent spaniel. The
Iberians brought the breed to Ireland..." Of course, that's why he
followed me home; he knew I was Welsh the moment he saw me!'</p>

<p>Stephen laughed: 'Yes, his hair grows up from a peak like
yours&mdash;it must be a national failing. Well, what shall we call
him? His name's important; it ought to be quite short.'</p>

<p>'David,' said Mary.</p>

<p>The dog looked gravely from one to the other for a moment, then
he lay down at Mary's feet, dropping his chin on his bandaged paw,
and dosing his eyes with a grunt of contentment. And so it had
suddenly come to pass that they who had lately been two, were now
three. There were Stephen and Mary&mdash;there was also David.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>Chapter Forty-two</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>That October there arose the first dark cloud. It drifted over
to Paris from England, for Anna wrote, asking Stephen to Morton but
with never a mention of Mary Llewellyn. Not that she ever did
mention their friendship in her letters, indeed she completely
ignored it; yet this invitation which excluded the girl seemed to
Stephen an intentional slight upon Mary. A hot flush of anger
spread up to her brow as she read and re-read her mother's brief
letter:</p>

<p>'I want to discuss some important points regarding the
management of the estate. As the place will eventually come to you,
I think we should try to keep more in touch...' Then a list of the
points Anna wished to discuss; they seemed very trifling indeed to
Stephen.</p>

<p>She put the letter away in a drawer and sat staring darkly out
of the window. In the garden Mary was talking to David, persuading
him not to retrieve the pigeons.</p>

<p>'If my mother had invited her ten times over I'd never have
taken her to Morton,' Stephen muttered.</p>

<p>Oh, but she knew, and only too well, what it would mean should
they be there together; the lies, the despicable subterfuges, as
though they were little less than criminals. It would be: 'Mary,
don't hang about my bedroom&mdash;be careful...of course while
we're here at Morton...it's my mother, she can't understand these
things; to her they would seem an outrage, an insult...And then the
guard set upon eyes and lips; the feeling of guilt at so much as a
hand-touch; the pretence of a careless, quite usual
friendship&mdash;'Mary, don't look at me as though you cared! you
did this evening&mdash;remember my mother.'</p>

<p>Intolerable quagmire of lies and deceit! The degrading of all
that to them was sacred&mdash;a very gross degrading of love, and
through love a gross degrading of Mary, Mary...so loyal and as yet
so gallant, but so pitifully untried in the war of existence.
Warned only by words, the words of a lover, and what were mere
words when it came to actions? And the ageing woman with the
far-away eyes, eyes that could yet be so cruel, so
accusing&mdash;that they might turn and rest with repugnance on
Mary, even as once they had rested on Stephen: 'I would rather see
you dead at my feet...' A fearful saying, and yet she had meant it,
that ageing woman with the far-away eyes&mdash;she had uttered it
knowing herself to be a mother. But that at least should be hidden
from Mary.</p>

<p>She began to consider the ageing woman who had scourged her but
whom she had so deeply wounded, and as she did so the depth of that
wound made her shrink in spite of her bitter anger, so that
gradually the anger gave way to a slow and almost reluctant pity.
Poor, ignorant, blind, unreasoning woman; herself a victim, having
given her body for Nature's most inexplicable whim. Yes, there had
been two victims already&mdash;must there now be a third&mdash;and
that one Mary? She trembled. At that moment she could not face it,
she was weak, she was utterly undone by loving. Greedy she had
grown for happiness, for the joys and the peace that their union
had brought her. She would try to minimize the whole thing; she
would say: 'It will only be for ten days; I must just run over
about this business,' then Mary would probably think it quite
natural that she had not been invited to Morton and would ask no
questions&mdash;she never asked questions. But would Mary think
such a slight was quite natural? Fear possessed her; she sat there
terribly afraid of this cloud that had suddenly risen to
menace&mdash;afraid yet determined not to submit, not to let it
gain power through her own acquiescence.</p>

<p>There was only one weapon to keep it at bay. Getting up she
opened the window: 'Mary!'</p>

<p>All unconscious the girl hurried in with David: 'Did you
call?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;come close. Closer...closer, sweetheart...</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Shaken and very greatly humbled, Mary had let Stephen go from
her to Morton. She had not been deceived by Stephen's glib words,
and had now no illusions regarding Anna Gordon. Lady Anna,
suspecting the truth about them, had not wished to meet her. It was
all quite clear, cruelly clear if it came to that matter&mdash;but
these thoughts she had mercifully hidden from Stephen.</p>

<p>She had seen Stephen off at the station with a smile: 'I'll
write every day. Do put on your coat, darling; you don't want to
arrive at Morton with a chill. And mind you wire when you get to
Dover.'</p>

<p>Yet now as she sat in the empty study, she must bury her face
and cry a little because she was here and Stephen in England...and
then of course, this was their first real parting.</p>

<p>David sat watching with luminous eyes in which were reflected
her secret troubles; then he got up and planted a paw on the book,
for he thought it high time to have done with this reading. He
lacked the language that Raftery had known&mdash;the language of
many small sounds and small movements&mdash;a clumsy and
inarticulate fellow he was, but unrestrainedly loving. He nearly
broke his own heart between love and the deep gratitude which he
felt for Mary. At the moment he wanted to lay back his ears and
howl with despair to see her unhappy. He wanted to make an enormous
noise, the kind of noise wild folk make in the jungle&mdash;lions
and tigers and other wild folk that David had heard about from his
mother&mdash;his mother had been in Africa once a long time ago,
with an old French colonel. But instead he abruptly licked Mary's
cheek&mdash;it tasted peculiar, he thought, like sea water.</p>

<p>'Do you want a walk, David?' she asked him gently.</p>

<p>And as well as he could, David nodded his head by wagging his
tail which was shaped like a sickle. Then he capered, thumping the
ground with his paws; after which he barked twice in an effort to
amuse her, for such things had seemed funny to her in the past,
although now she appeared not to notice his capers. However, she
had put on her hat and coat; so, still barking, he followed her
through the courtyard.</p>

<p>They wandered along the Quai Voltaire, Mary pausing to look at
the misty river.</p>

<p>'Shall I dive in and bring you a rat?' inquired David by lunging
wildly backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'Do stop, David; be good!' Then she sighed
again and stared at the river; so David stared too, but he stared
at Mary.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly Paris had lost its charm for her. After all, what
was it? Just a big, foreign city&mdash;a city that belonged to a
stranger people who cared nothing for Stephen and nothing for Mary.
They were exiles. She turned the word over in her
mind&mdash;exiles; it sounded unwanted, lonely. But why had Stephen
become an exile? Why had she exiled herself from Morton? Strange
that she, Mary, had never asked her&mdash;had never wanted to until
this moment.</p>

<p>She walked on not caring very much where she went. It grew dusk,
and the dusk brought with it great longing&mdash;the longing to
see, to hear, to touch&mdash;almost a physical pain it was, this
longing to feel the nearness of Stephen. But Stephen had left her
to go to Morton...Morton that was surely Stephen's real home, and
in that real home there was no place for Mary.</p>

<p>She was not resentful. She did not condemn either the world, or
herself, or Stephen. Hers was no mind to wrestle with problems, to
demand either justice or explanation; she only knew that her heart
felt bruised so that all manner of little things hurt her. It hurt
her to think of Stephen surrounded by objects that she had never
seen&mdash;tables, chairs, pictures, all old friends of Stephen's,
all dear and familiar, yet strangers to Mary. It hurt her to think
of the unknown bedroom in which Stephen had slept since the days of
her childhood; of the unknown schoolroom where Stephen had worked;
of the stables, the lakes and the gardens of Morton. It hurt her to
think of the two unknown women who must now be awaiting Stephen's
arrival&mdash;Puddle, whom Stephen loved and respected; Lady Anna,
of whom she spoke very seldom, and who, Mary felt, could never have
loved her. And it came upon Mary with a little shock that a long
span of Stephen's life was hidden; years and years of that life had
come and gone before they two had finally found each other. How
could she hope to link up with a past that belonged to a home which
she might not enter? Then, being a woman, she suddenly ached for
the quiet, pleasant things that a home will stand
for&mdash;security, peace, respect and honour, the kindness of
parents, the goodwill of neighbours; happiness that can be shared
with friends, love that is proud to proclaim its existence. All
that Stephen most craved for the creature she loved, that creature
must now quite suddenly ache for.</p>

<p>And as though some mysterious cord stretched between them,
Stephen's heart was troubled at that very moment; intolerably
troubled because of Morton, the real home which might not be shared
with Mary. Ashamed because of shame laid on another, compassionate
and suffering because of her compassion, she was thinking of the
girl left alone in Paris&mdash;the girl who should have come with
her to England, who should have been welcomed and honoured at
Morton. Then she suddenly remembered some words from the past, very
terrible words: 'Could you marry me, Stephen?'</p>

<p>Mary turned and walked back to the Rue Jacob. Disheartened and
anxious, David lagged beside her. He had done all he could to
distract her mind from whatever it was that lay heavy upon it. He
had made a pretence of chasing a pigeon, he had barked himself
hoarse at a terrified beggar, he had brought her a stick and
implored her to throw it, he had caught at her skirt and tugged it
politely; in the end he had nearly got run over by a taxi in his
desperate efforts to gain her attention. This last attempt had
certainly roused her: she had put on his lead&mdash;poor,
misunderstood David.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Mary went into Stephen's study and sat down at the spacious
writing-table, for now all of a sudden she had only one ache, and
that was the ache of her love for Stephen. And because of her love
she wished to comfort, since in every fond woman there is much of
the mother. That letter was full of many things which a less
privileged pen had best left unwritten&mdash;loyalty, faith,
consolation, devotion; all this and much more she wrote to Stephen.
As she sat there, her heart seemed to swell within her as though in
response to some mighty challenge.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Mary met and defeated the world's first
tentative onslaught upon them.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch43" id="ch43"></a>Chapter Forty-three</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>There comes a time in all passionate attachments when life, real
life, must be faced once again with its varied and endless
obligations, when the lover knows in his innermost heart that the
halcyon days are over. He may well regret this prosaic intrusion,
yet to him it will usually seem quite natural, so that while loving
not one whit the less, he will bend his neck to the yoke of
existence. But the woman, for whom love is an end in itself, finds
it harder to submit thus calmly. To every devoted and ardent woman
there comes this moment of poignant regretting; and struggle she
must to hold it at bay. 'Not yet, not yet&mdash;just a little
longer'; until Nature, abhorring her idleness, forces on her the
labour of procreation.</p>

<p>But in such relationships as Mary's and Stephen's, Nature must
pay for experimenting; she may even have to pay very
dearly&mdash;it largely depends on the sexual mixture. A drop too
little of the male in the lover, and mighty indeed will be the
wastage. And yet there are cases&mdash;and Stephen's was
one&mdash;in which the male will emerge triumphant; in which
passion combined with real devotion will become a spur rather than
a deterrent; in which love and endeavour will fight side by side in
a desperate struggle to find some solution.</p>

<p>Thus it was that when Stephen returned from Morton, Mary
divined, as it were by instinct, that the time of dreaming was over
and past; and she clung very dose, kissing many times&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do you love me as much as before you went? Do you love me?' The
woman's eternal question.</p>

<p>And Stephen, who, if possible, loved her more, answered almost
brusquely: 'Of course I love you.' For her thoughts were still
heavy with the bitterness that had come of that visit of hers to
Morton, and which at all costs must be hidden from Mary.</p>

<p>There had been no marked change in her mother's manner. Anna had
been very quiet and courteous. Together they had interviewed
bailiff and agent, scheming as always for the welfare of Morton;
but one topic there had been which Anna had ignored, had refused to
discuss, and that topic was Mary. With a suddenness born of
exasperation, Stephen had spoken of her one evening. 'I want Mary
Llewellyn to know my real home; some day I must bring her to Morton
with me.' She had stopped, seeing Anna's warning
face&mdash;expressionless, closed; while as for her answer, it had
been more eloquent far than words&mdash;a disconcerting,
unequivocal silence. And Stephen, had she ever entertained any
doubt, must have known at that moment past all hope of doubting,
that her mother's omission to invite the girl had indeed been meant
as a slight upon Mary. Getting up, she had gone to her father's
study.</p>

<p>Puddle, who had held her peace at the time, had spoken just
before Stephen's departure. 'My dear, I know it's all terribly hard
about Morton&mdash;about...' She had hesitated.</p>

<p>And Stephen had thought with renewed bitterness: 'Even she jibs,
it seems, at mentioning Mary.' She had answered: 'If you're
speaking of Mary Llewellyn, I shall certainly never bring her to
Morton, that is as long as my mother lives&mdash;I don't allow her
to be insulted.'</p>

<p>Then Puddle had looked at Stephen gravely. You're not working,
and yet work's your only weapon. Make the world respect you, as you
can do through your work; it's the surest harbour of refuge for
your friend, the only harbour&mdash;remember that&mdash;and it's up
to you to provide it, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Stephen had been too sore at heart to reply; but throughout the
long journey from Morton to Paris, Puddle's words had kept
hammering in her brain: 'You're not working, and yet work's your
only weapon.'</p>

<p>So while Mary lay sleeping in Stephen's arms on that first
blessed night of their reunion, her lover lay wide-eyed with
sleeplessness, planning the work she must do on the morrow, cursing
her own indolence and folly, her illusion of safety where none
existed.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>They soon settled down to their more prosaic days very much as
quite ordinary people will do. Each of them now had her separate
tasks&mdash;Stephen her writing, and Mary the household, the paying
of bills, the filing of receipts, the answering of unimportant
letters. But for her there were long hours of idleness, since
Pauline and Pierre were almost too perfect&mdash;they would smile
and manage the house in their own way, which it must be admitted
was better than Mary's. As for the letters, there were not very
many; and as for the bills, there was plenty of money&mdash;being
spared the struggle to make two ends meet, she was also deprived of
the innocent pleasure of scheming to provide little happy
surprises, little extra comforts for the person she loved, which in
youth can add a real zest to existence. Then Stephen had found her
typing too slow, so was sending the work to a woman in Passy;
obsessed by a longing to finish her book, she would tolerate
neither let nor hindrance. And because of their curious isolation,
there were times when Mary would feel very lonely. For whom did she
know? She had no friends in Paris except the kind Mademoiselle
Duphot and Julie. Once a week, it is true, she could go and see
Buisson, for Stephen continued to keep up her fencing; and
occasionally Brockett would come strolling in, but his interest was
centred entirely in Stephen; if she should be working, as was often
the case, he would not waste very much time over Mary.</p>

<p>Stephen often called her into the study, comforted by the girl's
loving presence. 'Come and sit with me, sweetheart, I like you in
here.' But quite soon she would seem to forget all about her.
'What...what?' she would mutter, frowning a little. 'Don't speak to
me just for a minute, Mary. Go and have your luncheon, there's a
good child; I'll come when I've finished this bit&mdash;you go on!'
But Mary's meal might be eaten alone; for meals had become an
annoyance to Stephen.</p>

<p>Of course there was David, the grateful, the devoted. Mary could
always talk to David, but since he could never answer her back the
conversation was very one-sided. Then too, he was making it obvious
that he, in his turn, was missing Stephen; he would hang around
looking discontented when she failed to go out after frequent
suggestions. For although his heart was faithful to Mary, the
gentle dispenser of all salvation, yet the instinct that has dwelt
in the soul of the male, perhaps ever since Adam left the Garden of
Eden, the instinct that displays itself in club windows and in
other such places of male segregation, would make him long for the
companionable walks that had sometimes been taken apart from Mary.
Above all would it make him long intensely for Stephen's strong
hands and purposeful ways; for that queer, intangible something
about her that appealed to the canine manhood in him. She always
allowed him to look after himself, without fussing; in a word, she
seemed restful to David.</p>

<p>Mary slipping noiselessly out of the study, might whisper: We'll
go to the Tuileries Gardens.'</p>

<p>But when they arrived there, what was there to do? For of course
a dog must not dive after goldfish&mdash;David understood this;
there were goldfish at home&mdash;he must not start splashing about
in ponds that had tiresome stone rims and ridiculous fountains. He
and Mary would wander along gravel paths, among people who stared
at and made fun of David: 'Quel dr&ocirc;le de chien, mais regardez
sa queue!' They were like that, these French; they had laughed at
his mother. She had told him never so much as to say: 'Wouf!' For
what did they matter? Still, it was disconcerting. And although he
had lived in France all his life&mdash;having indeed known no other
country&mdash;as he walked in the stately Tuileries Gardens, the
Celt in his blood would conjure up visions: great beetling
mountains with winding courses down which the torrents went roaring
in winter; the earth smell, the dew smell, the smell of wild things
which a dog might hunt and yet remain lawful&mdash;for of all this
and more had his old mother told him. These visions it was that had
led him astray, that had treacherously led him half starving to
Paris; and that, sometimes, even in these placid days, would come
back as he walked in the Tuileries Gardens. But now his heart must
thrust them aside&mdash;a captive he was now, through love of
Mary.</p>

<p>But to Mary there would come one vision alone, that of a garden
at Orotava; a garden lighted by luminous darkness, and filled with
the restless rhythm of singing.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The autumn passed, giving place to the winter, with its short,
dreary days of mist and rain. There was now little beauty left in
Paris. A grey sky hung above the old streets of the Quarter, a sky
which no longer looked bright by contrast, as though seen at the
end of a tunnel. Stephen was working like someone possessed,
entirely re-writing her pre-war novel. Good it had been, but not
good enough, for she now saw life from a much wider angle; and,
moreover, she was writing this book for Mary. Remembering Mary,
remembering Morton, her pen covered sheet after sheet of paper; she
wrote with the speed of true inspiration, and at times her work
brushed the hem of greatness. She did not entirely neglect the girl
for whose sake she was making this mighty effort&mdash;that she
could not have done even had she wished to, since love was the
actual source of her effort. But quite soon there were days when
she would not go out, or if she did go, when she seemed abstracted,
so that Mary must ask her the same question twice&mdash;then as
likely as not get a nebulous answer. And soon there were days when
all that she did apart from her writing was done with an effort,
with an obvious effort to be considerate.</p>

<p>'Would you like to go to a play one night, Mary?'</p>

<p>If Mary said yes, and procured the tickets, they were usually
late, because of Stephen who had worked right up to the very last
minute.</p>

<p>Sometimes there were poignant if small disappointments, when
Stephen had failed to keep a promise. 'Listen, Mary
darling&mdash;will you ever forgive me if I don't come with you
about those furs? I've a bit of work here I simply must finish. You
do understand?'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course I do.' But Mary, left to choose her new furs
alone, had quite suddenly felt that she did not want them.</p>

<p>And this sort of thing happened fairly often.</p>

<p>If only Stephen had confided in her, had said: 'I'm trying to
build you a refuge; remember what I told you in Orotava!' But no,
she shrank from reminding the girl of the gloom that surrounded
their small patch of sunshine. If only she had shown a little more
patience with Mary's careful if rather slow typing, and so given
her a real occupation&mdash;but no, she must send the work off to
Passy, because the sooner this book was finished the better it
would be for Mary's future. And thus, blinded by love and her
desire to protect the woman she loved, she erred towards Mary.</p>

<p>When she had finished her writing for the day, she frequently
read it aloud in the evening. And although Mary knew that the
writing was fine, yet her thoughts would stray from the book to
Stephen. The deep, husky voice would read on and on, having in it
something urgent, appealing, so that Mary must suddenly kiss
Stephen's hand, or the scar on her cheek, because of that voice far
more than because of what it was reading.</p>

<p>And now there were times when, serving two masters, her passion
for this girl and her will to protect her, Stephen would be torn by
conflicting desires, by opposing mental and physical emotions. She
would want to save herself for her work; she would want to give
herself wholly to Mary.</p>

<p>Yet quite often she would work far into the night. 'I'm going to
be late&mdash;you go to bed, sweetheart.'</p>

<p>And when she herself had at last toiled upstairs, she would
steal like a thief past Mary's bedroom, although Mary would nearly
always hear her.</p>

<p>'Is that you, Stephen?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Why aren't you asleep? Do you realize that it's three in
the morning?'</p>

<p>'Is it? You're not angry, are you, darling? I kept thinking of
you alone in the study. Come here and say you're not angry with me,
even if it is three o'clock in the morning!'</p>

<p>Then Stephen would slip off her old tweed coat and would fling
herself down on the bed beside Mary, too exhausted to do more than
take the girl in her arms, and let her lie there with her head on
her shoulder.</p>

<p>But Mary would be thinking of all those things which she found
so deeply appealing in Stephen&mdash;the scar on her cheek, the
expression in her eyes, the strength and the queer, shy gentleness
of her&mdash;the strength which at moments could not be gentle. And
as they lay there Stephen might sleep, worn out by the strain of
those long hours of writing. But Mary would not sleep, or if she
slept it would be when the dawn was paling the windows.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>One morning Stephen looked at Mary intently. 'Come here. You're
not well! What's the matter? Tell me.' For she thought that the
girl was unusually pale, thought too that her lips drooped a little
at the corners; and a sudden fear contracted her heart. 'Tell me at
once what's the matter with you!' Her voice was rough with anxiety,
and she laid an imperative hand over Mary's.</p>

<p>Mary protested. 'Don't be absurd; there's nothing the matter,
I'm perfectly well&mdash;you're imagining things.' For what could
be the matter? Was she not here in Paris with Stephen? But her eyes
filled with tears, and she turned away quickly to hide them,
ashamed of her own unreason.</p>

<p>Stephen stuck to her point. 'You don't look a bit well. We
shouldn't have stayed in Paris last summer.' Then because her own
nerves were on edge that day, she frowned. 'It's this business of
your not eating whenever I can't get in to a meal. I know you don't
eat&mdash;Pierre's told me about it. You mustn't behave like a
baby, Mary! I shan't be able to write a line if I feel you're ill
because you're not eating.' Her fear was making her lose her
temper. 'I shall send for a doctor,' she finished brusquely.</p>

<p>Mary refused point-blank to see a doctor. What was she to tell
him? She hadn't any symptoms. Pierre exaggerated. She ate quite
enough&mdash;she had never been a very large eater. Stephen had
better get on with her work and stop upsetting herself over
nothing.</p>

<p>But try as she might, Stephen could not get on&mdash;all the
rest of the day her work went badly.</p>

<p>After this she would often leave her desk and go wandering off
in search of Mary. 'Darling, where are you?'</p>

<p>'Upstairs in my bedroom!'</p>

<p>'Well, come down; I want you here in the study.' And when Mary
had settled herself by the fire: 'Now tell me exactly how you
feel&mdash;all right?'</p>

<p>And Mary would answer, smiling: 'Yes, I'm quite all right; I
swear I am, Stephen!'</p>

<p>It was not an ideal atmosphere for work, but the book was by now
so well advanced that nothing short of a disaster could have
stopped it&mdash;it was one of those books that intend to get born,
and that go on maturing in spite of their authors. Nor was there
anything really alarming about the condition of Mary's health. She
did not look very well, that was all; and at times she seemed a
little downhearted, so that Stephen must snatch a few hours from
her work in order that they might go out together. Perhaps they
would lunch at a restaurant; or drive into the country, to the
rapture of David; or just wander about the streets arm in arm as
they had done when first they had returned to Paris. And Mary,
because she would be feeling happy, would revive for these few
hours as though by magic. Yet when she must once more find herself
lonely, with nowhere to go and no one to talk to, because Stephen
was back again at her desk, why then she would wilt, which was not
unnatural considering her youth and her situation.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve Brockett arrived, bringing flowers. Mary had
gone for a walk with David, so Stephen must leave her desk with a
sigh. 'Come in, Brockett. I say! what wonderful lilac!'</p>

<p>He sat down, lighting a cigarette. 'Yes, isn't it fine? I
brought it for Mary. How is she?'</p>

<p>Stephen hesitated a moment. 'Not awfully well...I've been
worried about her.'</p>

<p>Brockett frowned, and stared thoughtfully into the fire. There
was something that he wanted to say to Stephen; a warning that he
was longing to give, but he did not feel certain how she would take
it&mdash;no wonder that wretched girl was not fit, forced to lead
such a deadly dull existence! If Stephen would let him he wanted to
advise, to admonish, to be brutally frank if need be. He had once
been brutally frank about her work, but that had been a less
delicate matter.</p>

<p>He began to fidget with his soft, white hands, drumming on the
arms of the chair with his fingers. Stephen, I've been meaning to
speak about Mary. She struck me as looking thoroughly depressed the
last time I saw her&mdash;when was it? Monday. Yes, she struck me
as looking thoroughly depressed.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but surely you were wrong...' interrupted Stephen.</p>

<p>'No, I'm perfectly sure I was right,' he insisted. Then he said:
'I'm going to take a big risk&mdash;I'm going to take the risk of
losing your friendship.'</p>

<p>His voice was so genuinely regretful, that Stephen must ask him:
'Well&mdash;what is it, Brockett?'</p>

<p>'You, my dear. You're not playing fair with that girl; the life
she's leading would depress a mother abbess. It's enough to give
anybody the hump, and it's going to give Mary neurasthenia!'</p>

<p>'What on earth do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Don't get ratty and I'll tell you. Look here, I'm not going to
pretend any more. Of course we all know that you two are lovers.
You're gradually becoming a kind of legend&mdash;all's well lost
for love, and that sort of thing...But Mary's too young to become a
legend; and so are you, my dear, for that matter. But you've got
your work, whereas Mary's got nothing&mdash;not a soul does that
miserable kid know in Paris. Don't please interrupt. I've not
nearly finished; I positively must and will have my say out! You
and she have decided to make a m&eacute;nage&mdash;as far as I can
see it's as bad as marriage! But if you were a man it would be
rather different; you'd have dozens of friends as a matter of
course. Mary might even be going to have an infant. Oh, for God's
sake, Stephen, do stop looking shocked. Mary's a perfectly normal
young woman; she can't live by love alone, that's all
rot&mdash;especially as I shrewdly suspect that when you're working
the diet's pretty meagre. For heaven's sake let her go about a bit!
Why on earth don't you take her to Val&eacute;rie Seymour's? At
Val&eacute;rie's place she'd meet lots of people; and I ask you,
what harm could it possibly do? You shun your own ilk as though
they were the devil! Mary needs friends awfully badly, and she
needs a certain amount of amusement. But be a bit careful of the
so-called normal.' And now Brockett's voice grew aggressive and
bitter. 'I wouldn't go trying to force them to be friends&mdash;I'm
not thinking so much of you now as of Mary; she's young and the
young are easily bruised...</p>

<p>He was perfectly sincere. He was trying to be helpful, spurred
on by his curious affection for Stephen. At the moment he felt very
friendly and anxious; there was nothing of the cynic left in
him&mdash;at the moment. He was honestly advising according to his
lights&mdash;perhaps the only lights that the world had left
him.</p>

<p>And Stephen could find very little to say. She was sick of
denials and subterfuges, sick of tacit lies which outraged her own
instincts and which seemed like insults thrust upon Mary; so she
left Brockett's bolder statements unchallenged. As for the rest,
she hedged a little, still vaguely mistrustful of Val&eacute;rie
Seymour. Yet she knew quite well that Brockett had been
right&mdash;life these days must often be lonely for Mary. Why had
she never thought of this before? She cursed herself for her lack
of perception.</p>

<p>Then Brockett tactfully changed the subject; he was far too wise
not to know when to stop. So now he told her about his new play,
which for him was a very unusual proceeding. And as he talked on
there came over Stephen a queer sense of relief at the thought that
he knew...Yes, she actually felt a sense of relief because this man
knew of her relations with Mary; because there was no longer any
need to behave as if those relations were shameful&mdash;at all
events in the presence of Brockett. The world had at last found a
chink in her armour.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>6</b>
</p>

<p>'We must go and sce Val&eacute;rie Seymour one day,' Stephen
remarked quite casually that evening. 'She's a very well-known
woman in Paris. I believe she gives rather jolly parties. I think
it's about time you had a few friends.'</p>

<p>'Oh, what fun! Yes, do let's&mdash;I'd love it!' exclaimed
Mary.</p>

<p>Stephen thought that her voice sounded pleased and excited and
in spite of herself she sighed a little. But after all nothing
really mattered except that Mary should keep well and happy. She
would certainly take her to Val&eacute;rie Seymour's&mdash;why not?
She had probably been very foolish. Selfish too, sacrificing the
girl to her cranks&mdash;</p>

<p>'Darling, of course we'll go,' she aid quickly. 'I expect we'll
find it awfully amusing.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>7</b>
</p>

<p>Three days later, Val&eacute;rie, having seen Brockett, wrote a
short but cordial invitation: 'Do come in on Wednesday if you
possibly can&mdash;I mean both of you, of course. Brockett's
promised to come, and one or two other interesting people. I'm so
looking forward to renewing our acquaintance after all this long
time, and to meeting Miss Llewellyn. But why have you never been to
see me? I don't think that was very friendly of you! However, you
can make up for past neglect by coming to my little party on
Wednesday...</p>

<p>Stephen tossed the letter across to Mary. 'There you arc!' 'How
ripping&mdash;but will you go?'</p>

<p>'Do you want to?'</p>

<p>Yes, of course. Only what about your work?'</p>

<p>'It will keep all right for one afternoon.'</p>

<p>Are you sure?'</p>

<p>Stephen smiled. 'Yes, I'm quite sure, darling.'</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch44" id="ch44"></a>Chapter Forty-four</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie's rooms were already crowded when Stephen and
Mary arrived at her reception, so crowded that at first they could
not see their hostess and must stand rather awkwardly near the
door&mdash;they had not been announced; one never was for some
reason, when one went to Val&eacute;rie Seymour's. People looked at
Stephen curiously; her height, her clothes, the scar on her face,
had immediately riveted their attention.</p>

<p>'Quel type!' murmured Dupont the sculptor to his neighbour, and
promptly decided that he wished to model Stephen. 'It's a wonderful
head; I adore the strong throat. And the mouth&mdash;is it chaste,
is it ardent? I wonder. How would one model that intriguing mouth?'
Then being Dupont, to whom all things were allowed for the sake of
his art, he moved a step nearer and stared with embarrassing
admiration, combing his greyish beard with his fingers.</p>

<p>His neighbour, who was also his latest mistress, a small
fair-haired girl of a doll-like beauty, shrugged her shoulders. 'I
am not very pleased with you, Dupont, your taste is becoming
peculiar, mon ami&mdash;and yet you arc still sufficiently
virile...</p>

<p>He laughed. 'Be tranquil, my little hen, I am not proposing to
give you a rival.' Then he started to tease. 'But what about you? I
dislike the small horns that are covered with moss, even although
they are no bigger than thimbles. They are irritating, those mossy
horns, and exceedingly painful when they start to grow&mdash;like
wisdom teeth, only even more foolish. Ah, yes, I too have my
recollections. What is sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose,
as the English say&mdash;such a practical people!'</p>

<p>'You are dreaming, mon pauvre bougre,' snapped the lady.</p>

<p>And now Val&eacute;rie was making her way to the door. 'Miss
Gordon! I'm most awfully glad to see you and Miss Llewellyn. Have
you had any tea? No, of course not, I'm an abominable hostess! Come
along to the table&mdash;where's that useless Brockett? Oh, here he
is. Brockett, please be a man and get Miss Llewellyn and Miss
Gordon some tea.'</p>

<p>Brockett sighed. 'You go first then, Stephen darling, you're so
much more efficient than I am.' And he laid a soft, white hand on
her shoulder, thrusting her gently but firmly forward. When they
reached the buffet, he calmly stood still. 'Do get me an
ice&mdash;vanilla?' he murmured.</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to know everyone else, the atmosphere was
familiar and easy. People hailed each other like intimate friends,
and quite soon they were being charming to Stephen, and equally
charming and kind to Mary.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie was introducing her new guests with tactful
allusions to Stephen's talent: 'This is Stephen Gordon&mdash;you
know, the author; and Miss Llewellyn.'</p>

<p>Her manner was natural, and yet Stephen could not get rid of the
feeling that everyone knew about her and Mary, or that if they did
not actually know, they guessed, and were eager to show themselves
friendly.</p>

<p>She thought: 'Well, why not? I'm sick of lying.'</p>

<p>The erstwhile resentment that she had felt towards
Val&eacute;rie Seymour was fading completely. So pleasant it was to
be made to feel welcome by all these clever and interesting
people&mdash;and clever they were there was no denying; in
Val&eacute;rie's salon the percentage of brains was generally well
above the average. For together with those who themselves being
normal, had long put intellects above bodies, were writers,
painters, musicians and scholars, men and women who, set apart from
their birth, had determined to hack out a niche in existence. Many
of them had already arrived, while some were still rather painfully
hacking; not a few would fall by the way, it is true, but as they
fell others would take their places. Over the bodies of prostrate
comrades those others must fall in their turn or go on
hacking&mdash;for them there was no compromise with life, they were
lashed by the whip of self-preservation. There was Pat who had lost
her Arabella to the golden charms of Grigg and the Lido. Pat, who,
originally hailing from Boston, still vaguely suggested a New
England schoolmarm. Pat, whose libido apart from the flesh, flowed
into entomological channels&mdash;one had to look twice to discern
that her ankles were too strong and too heavy for those of a
female.</p>

<p>There was Jamie, very much more pronounced; Jamie who had come
to Paris from the Highlands; a trifle unhinged because of the music
that besieged her soul and fought for expression through her stiff
and scholarly compositions. Loose-limbed, raw-boned and
shortsighted she was; and since she could seldom afford new
glasses, her eyes were red-rimmed and strained in expression, and
she poked her head badly, for ever peering. Her tow-coloured mop
was bobbed by her friend, the fringe being only too often
uneven.</p>

<p>There was Wanda, the struggling Polish painter; dark for a Pole
with her short, stiff black hair, and her dusky skin, and her
colourless lips; yet withal not unattractive, this Wanda. She had
wonderful eyes that held fire in their depths, hell-fire at times,
if she had been drinking; but at other times a more gentle flame,
although never one that it was safe to play with. Wanda saw
largely. All that she envisaged was immense: her pictures, her
passions, her remorses. She craved with a wellnigh insatiable
craving, she feared with a wellnigh intolerable terror&mdash;not
the devil, she was brave with him when in her cups, but God in the
person of Christ the Redeemer. Like a whipped cur she crawled to
the foot of the Cross, without courage, without faith, without hope
of mercy. Outraged by her body she must ruthlessly scourge
it&mdash;no good, the lust of the eye would betray her. Seeing she
desired and desiring she drank, seeking to drown one lust in
another. And then she would stand up before her tall easel, swaying
a little but with hand always steady. The brandy went into her
legs, not her hands; her hands would remain disconcertingly steady.
She would start some gigantic and heart-broken daub, struggling to
lose herself in her picture, struggling to ease the ache of her
passion by smearing the placid white face of the canvas with
ungainly yet strangely arresting forms&mdash;according to Dupont,
Wanda had genius. Neither eating nor sleeping she would grow very
thin, so that everybody would know what had happened. They had seen
it before, oh, but many times, and therefore for them the tragedy
was lessened.</p>

<p>'Wanda's off again!' someone might say with a grin. 'She was
tight this morning; who is it this time?'</p>

<p>But Val&eacute;rie, who hated drink like the plague, would grow
angry; outraged she would feel by this Wanda.</p>

<p>There was Hortense, Comtesse de Kerguelen; dignified and
reserved, a very great lady, of a calm and rather old-fashioned
beauty. When Val&eacute;rie introduced her to Stephen, Stephen
quite suddenly thought of Morton. And yet she had left all for
Val&eacute;rie Seymour; husband, children and home had she left;
facing scandal, opprobrium, persecution. Greater than all these
most vital things had been this woman's love for Val&eacute;rie
Seymour. An enigma she seemed, much in need of explaining. And now
in the place of that outlawed love had come friendship; they were
close friends, these one-time lovers.</p>

<p>There was Margaret Roland, the poetess, a woman whose work was
alive with talent. The staunchest of allies, the most fickle of
lovers, she seemed likely enough to end up in a workhouse, with her
generous financial apologies which at moments made pretty large
holes in her savings. It was almost impossible not to like her,
since her only fault lay in being too earnest; every fresh love
affair was the last while it lasted, though of course this was apt
to be rather misleading. A costly business in money and tears; she
genuinely suffered in heart as in pocket. There was nothing
arresting in Margaret's appearance, sometimes she dressed well,
sometimes she dressed badly, according to the influence of the
moment. But she always wore ultra feminine shoes, and frequently
bought model gowns when in Paris: One might have said quite a
womanly woman, unless the trained ear had been rendered suspicious
by her voice which had something peculiar about it. It was like a
boy's voice on the verge of breaking.</p>

<p>And then there was Brockett with his soft white hands; and
several others there were, very like him. There was also Adolphe
Blanc, the designer&mdash;a master of colour whose primitive tints
had practically revolutionized taste, bringing back to the eye the
joy of the simple. Blanc stood in a little niche by himself, which
at times must surely have been very lonely. A quiet, tawny man with
the eyes of the Hebrew, in his youth he had been very deeply
afflicted. He had spent his days going from doctor to doctor: 'What
am I?' They had told him, pocketing their fees; not a few had
unctuously set out to cure him. Cure him, good God! There was no
cure for Blanc, he was, of all men the most normal abnormal. He had
known revolt, renouncing his God; he had known despair, the despair
of the godless; he had known wild moments of dissipation; he had
known long months of acute self-abasement. And then he had suddenly
found his soul, and that finding had brought with it resignation,
so that now he could stand in a niche by himself, a pitiful
spectator of what, to him, often seemed a bewildering scheme of
creation. For a living he designed many beautiful
things&mdash;furniture, costumes and scenery for ballets, even
women's gowns if the mood was upon him, but this he did for a
physical living. To keep life in his desolate, long-suffering soul,
he had stored his mind with much profound learning. So now many
poor devils went to him for advice, which he never refused though
he gave it sadly. It was always the same: 'Do the best you can, no
man can do more&mdash;but never stop fighting. For us there is no
sin so great as despair, and perhaps no virtue so vital as
courage.' Yes, indeed, to this gentle and learned Jew went many a
poor baptized Christian devil.</p>

<p>And such people frequented Val&eacute;rie Seymour's, men and
women who must carry God's mark on their foreheads. For
Val&eacute;rie, placid and self-assured, created an atmosphere of
courage, everyone felt very normal and brave when they gathered
together at Val&eacute;rie Seymour's. There she was, this charming
and cultured woman, a kind of lighthouse in a storm-swept ocean.
The waves had lashed round her feet in vain; winds had howled;
clouds had spewed forth their hail and their lightning; torrents
had deluged but had not destroyed her. The storms, gathering force,
broke and drifted away, leaving behind them the shipwrecked, the
drowning. But when they looked up, the poor spluttering victims,
why what should they see but Val&eacute;rie Seymour! Then a few
would strike boldly out for the shore, at the sight of this
indestructible creature.</p>

<p>She did nothing, and at all times said very little, feeling no
urge towards philanthropy. But this much she gave to her brethren,
the freedom of her salon, the protection of her friendship; if it
eased them to come to her monthly gatherings they were always
welcome provided they were sober. Drink and drugs she abhorred
because they were ugly&mdash;one drank tea, iced coffee sirops and
orangeade in that celebrated flat on the Quai Voltaire.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, a very strange company indeed if one analysed it for
this or that stigma. Why, the grades were so numerous and so fine
that they often defied the most careful observation. The timbre of
a voice, the build of an ankle, the texture of a hand, a movement,
a gesture&mdash;since few were as pronounced as Stephen Gordon,
unless it were Wanda, the Polish painter. She, poor soul, never
knew how to dress for the best. If she dressed like a woman she
looked like a man, if she dressed like a man she looked like a
woman!</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>And their love affairs, how strange, how bewildering&mdash;how
difficult to classify degrees of attraction. For not always would
they attract their own kind, very often they attracted quite
ordinary people. Thus Pat's Arabella had suddenly married, having
wearied of Grigg as of her predecessor. Rumour had it that she was
now blatantly happy at the prospect of shortly becoming a mother.
And then there was Jamie's friend Barbara, a wisp of a girl very
faithful and loving, but all woman as far as one could detect, with
a woman's clinging dependence on Jamie.</p>

<p>These two had been lovers from the days of their childhood, from
the days when away in their Highland village the stronger child had
protected the weaker at school or at play with their boisterous
companions. They had grown up together like two wind-swept saplings
on their bleak Scottish hill-side so starved of sunshine. For
warmth and protection they had leaned to each other, until with the
spring, at the time of mating, their branches had quietly
intertwined. That was how it had been, the entwinings of saplings,
very simple, and to them very dear, having nothing mysterious or
strange about it except inasmuch as all love is mysterious.</p>

<p>To themselves they had seemed like the other lovers for whom
dawns were brighter and twilights more tender. Hand in hand they
had strolled down the village street, pausing to listen to the
piper at evening. And something in that sorrowful, outlandish music
would arouse the musical soul in Jamie, so that great chords would
surge up through her brain, very different indeed from the wails of
the piper, yet born of the same mystic Highland nature.</p>

<p>Happy days; happy evenings when the glow of the summer lingered
for hours above the grim hills, lingered on long after the
flickering lamps had been lit in the cottage windows of Beedles.
The piper would at last decide to go home, but they two would
wander away to the moorland, there to lie down for a space side by
side among the short, springy turf and the heather.</p>

<p>Children they had been, having small skill in words, or in life,
or in love itself for that matter. Barbara, fragile and barely
nineteen; the angular Jamie not yet quite twenty. They had talked
because words will ease the full spirit; talked in abrupt, rather
shy broken phrases. They had loved because love had come naturally
to them up there on the soft, springy turf and the heather. But
after a while their dreams had been shattered for such dreams as
theirs had seemed strange to the village. Daft, the folk had
thought them, mouthing round by themselves for hours, like a couple
of lovers.</p>

<p>Barbara's grand-dame, an austere old woman with whom she had
lived since her earliest childhood&mdash;Barbara's grand-dame had
mistrusted this friendship. 'I dinna richtly unnerstan' it,' she
had frowned; 'her and that Jamie's unto throng. It's no richt for
lass-bairns, an' it's no proaper!'</p>

<p>And since she spoke with authority, having for years been the
village post-mistress, her neighbours had wagged their heads and
agreed 'It's no richt; ye hae said it, Mrs. MacDonald!'</p>

<p>The gossip had reached the minister, Jamie's white-haired and
gentle old father. He had looked at the girl with bewildered
eyes&mdash;he had always been bewildered by his daughter. A poor
housewife she was, and very untidy; if she cooked she mucked up the
pots and the kitchen, and her hands were strangely unskilled with
the needle; this he knew, since his heels suffered much from her
darning. Remembering her mother he had shaken his head and sighed
many times as he looked at Jamie. For her mother had been a soft,
timorous woman, and he himself was very retiring, but their Jamie
loved striding over the hills in the teeth of a gale, an uncouth,
boyish creature. As a child she had gone rabbit stalking with
ferrets; had ridden a neighbour's farm-horse astride on a sack,
without stirrup, saddle or bridle; had done all manner of
outlandish things. And he, poor lonely, bewildered man, still
mourning his wife, had been no match for her.</p>

<p>Yet even as a child she had sat at the piano and picked out
little tunes of her own inventing. He had done his best; she had
been taught to play by Miss Morrison of the next-door village,
since music alone seemed able to tame her. And as Jamie had grown
so her tunes had grown with her, gathering purpose and strength
with her body. She would improvise for hours on the winter
evenings, if Barbara would sit in their parlour and listen. He had
always made Barbara welcome at the manse; they had been so
inseparable, those two, since childhood&mdash;and now? He had
frowned, remembering the gossip.</p>

<p>Rather timidly he had spoken to Jamie. 'Listen, my dear, when
you're always together, the lads don't get a chance to come
courting, and Barbara's grandmother wants the lass married. Let her
walk with a lad on Sabbath afternoons&mdash;there's that young
MacGregor, he's a fine, steady fellow, and they say he's in love
with the little lass...</p>

<p>Jamie had stared at him, scowling darkly. 'She doesn't want to
walk out with MacGregor!'</p>

<p>The minister had shaken his head yet again. In the hands of his
child he was utterly helpless.</p>

<p>Then Jamie had gone to Inverness in order the better to study
music, but every week-end she had spent at the manse, there had
been no real break in her friendship with Barbara; indeed they had
seemed more devoted than ever, no doubt because of these forced
separations. Two years later the minister had suddenly died,
leaving his little all to Jamie. She had had to turn out of the
old, grey manse, and had taken a room in the village near Barbara.
But antagonism, no longer restrained through respect for the gentle
and childlike pastor, had made itself very acutely
felt&mdash;hostile they had been, those good people, to Jamie.</p>

<p>Barbara had wept. 'Jamie, let's go away...they hate us. Let's go
where nobody knows us. I'm twenty-one now, I can go where I like,
they can't stop me. Take me away from them, Jamie!' Miserable,
angry, and sorely bewildered, Jamie had put her arm round the girl.
Where can I take you, you poor little creature? You're not strong,
and I'm terribly poor, remember.'</p>

<p>But Barbara had continued to plead. 'I'll work, I'll scrub
floors, I'll do anything, Jamie, only let's get away where nobody
knows us!' So Jamie had turned to her music master in Inverness,
and had begged him to help her. What could she do to earn her
living? And because this man believed in her talent, he had helped
her with advice and a small loan of money, urging her to go to
Paris and study to complete her training in composition.</p>

<p>'You're really too good for me,' he had told her; 'and out there
you could live considerably cheaper. For one thing the exchange
would be in your favour. I'll write to the head of the
Conservatoire this evening.'</p>

<p>That had been shortly after the Armistice, and now here they
were together in Paris.</p>

<p>As for Pat, she collected her moths and her beetles, and when
fate was propitious an occasional woman. But fate was so seldom
propitious to Pat&mdash;Arabella had put this down to the beetles.
Poor Pat, having recently grown rather gloomy, had taken to quoting
American history, speaking darkly of blood-tracks left in the snow
by what she had christened 'The miserable army.' Then, too, she
seemed haunted by General Custer, that gallant and very unfortunate
hero. 'It's Custer's last ride, all the time,' she would say. 'No
good talking, the whole darned world's out to scalp us!'</p>

<p>As for Margaret Roland, she was never attracted to anyone young
and whole-hearted and free&mdash;she was, in fact, a congenital
poacher. While as for Wanda, her loves were so varied that no rule
could be discovered by which to judge them. She loved wildly,
without either chart or compass. A rudderless barque it was,
Wanda's emotion, beaten now this way, now that, by the gale veering
first to the normal, then to the abnormal; a thing of torn sails
and stricken masts, that never came within sight of a harbour.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>These, then, were the people to whom Stephen turned at last in
her fear of isolation for Mary; to her own kind she turned and was
made very welcome, for no bond is more binding than that of
affliction. But her vision stretched beyond to the day when happier
folk would also accept her, and through her this girl for whose
happiness she and she alone would have to answer; to the day when
through sheer force of tireless endeavour she would have built that
harbour of refuge for Mary.</p>

<p>So now they were launched upon the stream that flows silent and
deep through all great cities, gliding on between precipitous
borders, away and away into no-man's-land&mdash;the most desolate
country in all creation. Yet when they got home they felt no
misgivings, even Stephen's doubts had been drugged for the moment,
since just at first this curious stream will possess the balm of
the waters of Lethe.</p>

<p>She said to Mary: 'It was quite a good party; don't you think
so?'</p>

<p>And Mary answered naively: 'I loved it because they were so nice
to you. Brockett told me they think you're the coming writer. He
said you were Val&eacute;rie Seymour's lion; I was bursting with
pride&mdash;it made me so happy!'</p>

<p>For answer, Stephen stooped down and kissed her.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch45" id="ch45"></a>Chapter Forty-five</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>By February Stephen's book was rewritten and in the hands of her
publisher in England. This gave her the peaceful, yet exhilarated
feeling that comes when a writer has given of his best and knows
that that best is not unworthy. With a sigh of relief she
metaphorically stretched, rubbed her eyes and started to look about
her. She was in the mood that comes as a reaction from strain, and
glad enough of amusement; moreover the spring was again in the air,
the year had turned, there were sudden bright days when the sun
brought a few hours of warmth to Paris.</p>

<p>They were now no longer devoid of friends, no longer solely
dependent upon Brockett on the one hand, and Mademoiselle Duphot on
the other; Stephen's telephone would ring pretty often. There was
now always somewhere for Mary to go; always people who were anxious
to see her and Stephen, people with whom one got intimate quickly
and was thus saved a lot of unnecessary trouble. Of them all,
however, it was Barbara and Jamie for whom Mary developed a real
affection; she and Barbara had formed a harmless alliance which at
times was even a little pathetic. The one talking of Jamie, the
other of Stephen, they would put their young heads together very
gravely. 'Do you find Jamie goes off her food when she's working?'
'Do you find that Stephen sleeps badly? Is she careless of her
health? Jamie's awfully worrying sometimes.'</p>

<p>Or perhaps they would be in a more flippant mood and would sit
and whisper together, laughing; making tender fun of the creatures
they loved, as women have been much inclined to do ever since that
rib was demanded of Adam. Then Jamie and Stephen would pretend to
feel aggrieved, would pretend that they also must hang together,
must be on their guard against feminine intrigues. Oh, yes, the
whole business was rather pathetic.</p>

<p>Jamie and her Barbara were starvation-poor, so poor that a
square meal came as a godsend. Stephen would feel ashamed to be
rich, and, like Mary, was always anxious to feed them. Being idle
at the moment Stephen would insist upon frequently taking them out
to dinner, and then she would order expensive
viands&mdash;copper-green oysters straight from the Marennes,
caviare and other such costly things, to be followed by even more
sumptuous dishes&mdash;and since they went short on most days in
the week, these stomachic debauches would frequently upset them.
Two glasses of wine would cause Jamie to flush, for her head had
never been of the strongest, nor was it accustomed to such golden
nectar. Her principal beverage was creme-de-menthe because it kept
out the cold in the winter, and because, being pepperminty and
sweet, it reminded her of the bulls-eyes at Beedles.</p>

<p>They were not very easy to help, these two, for Jamie,
pride-galled, was exceedingly touchy. She would never accept gifts
of money or clothes, and was struggling to pay off the debt to her
master. Even food gave offence unless it was shared by the donors,
which though very praiseworthy was foolish. However, there it was,
one just had to take her or leave her, there was no compromising
with Jamie.</p>

<p>After dinner they would drift back to Jamie's abode, a studio in
the old Rue Visconti. They would climb innumerable dirty stone
stairs to the top of what had once been a fine house but was now
let off to such poor rats as Jamie. The concierge, an unsympathetic
woman, long soured by the empty pockets of students, would peer out
at them from her dark ground-floor kennel, with sceptical eyes.</p>

<p>'Bon soir, Madame Lambert.'</p>

<p>'Bon soir, mesdames,' she would growl impolitely.</p>

<p>Jamie's studio was large, bare and swept by draughts. The stove
was too small and at times it smelt vilely. The distempered grey
walls were a mass of stains, for whenever it hailed or rained or
snowed the windows and skylight would always start dripping. The
furniture consisted of a few shaky chairs, a table, a divan and a
hired grand piano. Nearly everyone seated themselves on the floor,
robbing the divan of its moth-eaten cushions. From the studio there
led off a tiny room with an eye-shaped window that would not open.
In this room had been placed a narrow camp-bed to which Jamie
retired when she felt extra sleepless. For the rest, there was a
sink with a leaky tap; a cupboard in which they kept
creme-de-menthe, what remnants of food they possessed at the
moment, Jamie's carpet-slippers and blue jean jacket&mdash;minus
which she could never compose a note&mdash;and the pail, cloths and
brushes with which Barbara endeavoured to keep down the
accumulating dirt and confusion. For Jamie with her tow-coloured
head in the clouds, was not only short-sighted but intensely
untidy. Dust meant little to her since she seldom saw it, while
neatness was completely left out of her make-up; considering how
limited were her possessions, the chaos they produced was truly
amazing. Barbara would sigh and would quite often scold&mdash;when
she scolded she reminded one of a wren who was struggling to
discipline a large cuckoo.</p>

<p>'Jamie, your dirty shirt, give it to me&mdash;leaving it there
on the piano, whatever!' Or, 'Jamie, come here and look at your
hair-brush; if you haven't gone and put it next-door to the
butter!'</p>

<p>Then Jamie would peer with her strained, red-rimmed eyes and
would grumble: 'Oh, leave me in peace, do, lassie!'</p>

<p>And when Barbara laughed, as she must do quite often at the
outrageous habits of the great loose-limbed creature, why then
these days she would usually cough, and when Barbara started to
cough she coughed badly. They had seen a doctor who had spoken
about lungs and had shaken his head; not strong, he had told them.
But neither of them had quite understood, for their French had
remained very embryonic, and they could not afford the smart
English doctor. All the same when Barbara coughed Jamie sweated,
and her fear would produce an acute irritation.</p>

<p>'Here, drink this water! Don't sit there doing nothing but rack
yourself to bits, it gets on my nerves. Go and order another bottle
of that mixture. God, how can I work if you will go on coughing!'
She would slouch co the piano and play mighty chords, pressing down
the loud pedal to drown that coughing. But when it had subsided she
would feel deep remorse. 'Oh, Barbara, you're so
little&mdash;forgive me. It's all my fault for bringing you out
here, you're not strong enough for this damnable life, you don't
get the right food, or anything proper.'</p>

<p>In the end it would be Barbara who must console. 'We'll be rich
some day when you've finished your opera&mdash;anyhow my cough
isn't dangerous, Jamie.'</p>

<p>Sometimes Jamie's music would go all wrong, the opera would
blankly refuse to get written. At the Conservatoire she would be
very stupid, and when she got home she would be very silent,
pushing her supper away with a frown, because coming upstairs she
had heard that cough. Then Barbara would fed even more tired and
weak than before, but would hide he, weakness from Jamie. After
supper they would undress in front of the stove if the weather was
cold, would undress without speaking. Barbara could get out of her
clothes quite neatly in no time, but Jamie must always dawdle,
dropping first this then that on the floor, or pausing to fill her
little black pipe and to light it before putting on her
pyjamas.</p>

<p>Barbara would fall on her knees by the divan and would start to
say prayers like a child, very simply. 'Our Father,' she would say,
and other prayers too, which always ended in: 'Please God, bless
Jamie.' For believing in Jamie she must needs believe in God, and
because she loved Jamie she must love God also&mdash;it had long
been like this, ever since they were children. But sometimes she
would shiver in her prim cotton nightgown, so that Jamie, grown
anxious, would speak to her sharply:</p>

<p>'Oh, stop praying, do. You and all your prayers! Are you daft to
kneel there when the room's fairly freezing? That's how you catch
cold; now tonight you'll cough!'</p>

<p>But Barbara would not so much as turn round; she would calmly
and earnestly go on with her praying. Her neck would look thin
against the thick plait which hung neatly down between her bent
shoulders; and the hands that covered her face would look
thin&mdash;thin and transparent like the hands of a consumptive.
Fuming inwardly, Jamie would stump off to bed in the tiny room with
its eye-shaped window, and there she herself must mutter a prayer,
especially if she heard Barbara coughing.</p>

<p>At times Jamie gave way to deep depression, hating the beautiful
city of her exile. Homesick unto death she would suddenly feel for
the dour little Highland village of Beedles. More even than for its
dull bricks and mortar would she long for its dull and respectable
spirit, for the sense of security common to Sabbaths, for the kirk
with its dull and respectable people. She would think with a
tenderness bred by forced absence of the greengrocer's shop that
stood on the corner, where they sold, side by side with cabbages
and onions, little neatly tied bunches of Scottish heather, little
earthenware jars of opaque heather honey. She would think of the
vast, stretching, windy moorlands; of the smell of the soil after
rain in summer; of the piper with his weather-stained, agile
fingers, of the wail of his sorrowful, outlandish music; of Barbara
as she had been in the days when they strolled side by side down
the narrow high street. And then she would sit with her head in her
hands, hating the sound and the smell of Paris, hating the
sceptical eyes of the concierge, hating the bare and unhomely
studio. Tears would well up from heaven alone knew what abyss of
half-understood desolation, and would go splashing down upon her
tweed skirt, or trickling back along her red wrists until they had
wetted her frayed flannel wrist-bands. Coming home with their
evening meal in a bag, this was how Barbara must sometimes find
her.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Jamie was not always so full of desolation; there were days when
she seemed to be in excellent spirits, and on one such occasion she
rang Stephen up, asking her to bring Mary round after dinner.
Everyone was coming, Wanda and Pat, Brockett, and even
Val&eacute;rie Seymour; for she, Jamie, had persuaded a couple of
negroes who were studying at the Conservatoire to come in and sing
for them that evening&mdash;they had promised to sing Negro
Spirituals, old slavery songs of the Southern plantations. They
were very nice negroes, their name was Jones&mdash;Lincoln and
Henry Jones, they were brothers. Lincoln and Jamie had become great
friends; he was very interested in her opera. And Wanda would bring
her mandolin&mdash;but the evening would be spoilt without Mary and
Stephen.</p>

<p>Mary promptly put on her hat; she must go and order them in some
supper. As she and Stephen would be there to share it, Jamie's
sensitive pride would be appeased. She would send them a very great
deal of food so that they could go on eating and eating.</p>

<p>Stephen nodded: 'Yes, send them in tons of supper!'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>At ten o'clock they arrived at the studio; at ten-thirty Wanda
came in with Brockett, then Blanc together with Val&eacute;rie
Seymour, then Pat wearing serviceable goloshes over her house shoes
because it was raining, then three or four fellow students of
Jamie's, and, finally the two negro brothers.</p>

<p>They were very unlike each other, these negroes; Lincoln, the
elder, was paler in colour. He was short and inclined to be rather
thick-set with a heavy but intellectual face&mdash;a strong face,
much lined for a man of thirty. His eyes had the patient,
questioning expression common to the eyes of most animals and to
those of all slowly evolving races. He shook hands very quietly
with Stephen and Mary. Henry was tall and as black as a coal, a
fine upstanding, but coarse-lipped young negro, with a roving
glance and a self-assured manner.</p>

<p>He remarked: Glad to meet you, Miss Gordon&mdash;Miss
Llewellyn,' and plumped himself down at Mary's side, where he
started to make conversation, too glibly.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie Seymour was soon talking to Lincoln with a
friendliness that put him at his ease&mdash;just A first he had
seemed a little self-conscious. But Pat was much more reserved in
her manner, having hailed from abolitionist Boston.</p>

<p>Wanda said abruptly: 'Can I have a drink, Jamie!' Brockett
poured her out a stiff brandy and soda.</p>

<p>Adolphe Blanc sat on the floor hugging his knees; and presently
Dupont the sculptor strolled in&mdash;being minus his mistress he
migrated to Stephen.</p>

<p>Then Lincoln seated himself at the piano, touching the keys with
firm, expert fingers, while Henry stood beside him very straight
and long and lifted up his voice which was velvet smooth, yet as
dear and insistent as the call of a clarion:</p>

<blockquote>'Deep river, my home is over Jordan.<br>
Deep river&mdash;Lord, I want to cross over into camp ground,<br>
Lord, I want to cross over into camp ground,<br>
Lord, I want to cross over into camp ground,<br>
Lord, I want to cross over into camp ground...</blockquote>

<p>And all the hope of the utterly hopeless of this world, who must
live by their ultimate salvation, all the terrible, aching,
homesick hope that is born of the infinite pain of the spirit,
seemed to break from this man and shake those who listened, so that
they sat with bent heads and clasped hands&mdash;they who were also
among the hopeless sat with bent heads and clasped hands as they
listened...Even Val&eacute;rie Seymour forgot to be pagan.</p>

<p>He was not an exemplary young negro; indeed he could be the
reverse very often. A crude animal Henry could be at times, with a
taste for liquor and a lust for women&mdash;just a primitive force
rendered dangerous by drink, rendered offensive by civilization.
Yet as he sang his sins seemed to drop from him, leaving him pure,
unashamed, triumphant. He sang to his God, to the God of his soul.
Who would some day blot out all the sins of the world, and make
vast reparation for every injustice: 'My home is over Jordan, Lord,
I want to cross over into camp ground.'</p>

<p>Lincoln's deep bass voice kept up a low sobbing. From time to
time only did he break into words; but as he played on he rocked
his body: 'Lord, I want to cross over into camp ground. Lord, I
want to cross over into camp ground.'</p>

<p>Once started they seemed unable to stop; carried away they were
by their music, drunk with that desperate hope of the
hopeless&mdash;far drunker than Henry would get on neat whisky.
They went from one spiritual into another, while their listeners
sat motionless, scarcely breathing. While Jamie's eyes ached from
unshed tears quite as much as from her unsuitable glasses; while
Adolphe Blanc, the gentle, the learned, grasped his knees and
pondered many things deeply; while Pat remembered her Arabella and
found but small consolation in beetles; while Brockett thought of
certain brave deeds that he, even he had done out in
Mespot&mdash;deeds that were not recorded in dispatches, unless in
those of the recording angel; while Wanda evolved an enormous
canvas depicting the wrongs of all mankind; while Stephen suddenly
found Mary's hand and held it in hers with a painful pressure;
while Barbara's tired and childish brown eyes turned to rest rather
anxiously on her Jamie. Not one of them all but was stirred to the
depths by that queer, half defiant, half supplicating music.</p>

<p>And now there rang out a kind of challenge; imperious, loud,
almost terrifying. They sang it together, those two black brethren,
and their voices suggested a multitude of shouting. They seemed to
be shouting a challenge to the world on behalf of themselves and of
all the afflicted:</p>

<blockquote>'Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel,<br>
Daniel, Daniel!<br>
Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel,<br>
Then why not every man?'</blockquote>

<p>The eternal question, as yet unanswered for those who sat there
spellbound and listened...'Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel, then why
not every man?'</p>

<p>Why not?...Yes, but how long, O Lord, how long?</p>

<p>Lincoln got up from the piano abruptly, and he made a small bow
which seemed strangely foolish, murmuring some stilted words of
thanks on behalf of himself and his brother Henry: 'We are greatly
obliged to you for your patience; we trust that we have satisfied
you,' he murmured.</p>

<p>It was over. They were just two men with black skins and
foreheads beaded with perspiration. Henry sidled away to the
whisky, while Lincoln rubbed his pinkish palms on an elegant white
silk handkerchief. Everyone started to talk at once, to light
cigarettes, to move about the studio.</p>

<p>Jamie said: 'Come on, people, it's time for supper,' and she
swallowed a small glass of creme-de-menthe; but Wanda poured
herself out some more brandy.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly they had all become merry, laughing at nothing,
teasing each other; even Val&eacute;rie unbent more than was her
wont and did not look bored when Brockett chaffed her. The air grew
heavy and stinging with smoke; the stove went out, but they
scarcely noticed.</p>

<p>Henry Jones lost his head and pinched Pat's bony shoulder, then
he rolled his eyes: 'Oh, boy! What a gang! Say, folks, aren't we
having the hell of an evening? When any of you folk decide to come
over to my little old New York, why, I'll show you around. Some
burg!' and he gulped a large mouthful of whisky.</p>

<p>After supper Jamie played the overture to her opera, and they
loudly applauded the rather dull music&mdash;so scholarly, so dry,
so painfully stiff, so utterly inexpressive of Jamie. Then Wanda
produced her mandolin and insisted upon singing them Polish love
songs; this she did in a heavy contralto voice which was rendered
distinctly unstable by brandy. She handled the tinkling instrument
with skill, evolving some quite respectable chords, but her eyes
were fierce as was also her touch, so that presently a wire snapped
with a ping, which appeared completely to upset her balance. She
fell back and lay sprawled out upon the floor to be hauled up again
by Dupont and Brockett.</p>

<p>Barbara had one of her bad fits of coughing: 'It's nothing...'
she gasped, 'I swallowed the wrong way; don't fuss,
Jamie...darling...I tell you it's...nothing.'</p>

<p>Jamie, flushed already, drank more creme-de-menthe. This time
she poured it into a tumbler, tossing it off with a dash of soda.
But Adolphe Blanc looked at Barbara gravely.</p>

<p>The party did not disperse until morning; not until four o'clock
could they decide to go home. Everybody had stayed to the very last
moment, everybody, that is, except Val&eacute;rie Seymour&mdash;she
had left immediately after supper. Brockett, as usual, was
cynically sober, but Jamie was blinking her eyes like an owl, while
Pat stumbled over her own goloshes. As for Henry Jones, he started
to sing at the top of his lungs in a high falsetto:</p>

<blockquote>'Oh, my, help, help, ain't I nobody's baby?<br>
Oh, my, what a shame, I ain't nobody's baby.'</blockquote>

<p>Shut your noise, you poor mutt!' commanded his brother, but
Henry still continued to bawl: 'Oh, my, what a shame, I ain't
nobody's baby.'</p>

<p>They left Wanda asleep on a heap of cushions&mdash;she would
probably not wake up before midday.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch46" id="ch46"></a>Chapter Forty-six</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen's book, which made its appearance that May, met with a
very sensational success in England and in the United States, an
even more marked success than <i>The Furrow</i>. Its sales were
unexpectedly large considering its outstanding literary merit; the
critics of two countries were loud in their praises, and old
photographs of Stephen could be seen in the papers, together with
very flattering captions. In a word, she woke up in Paris one
morning to find herself, for the moment, quite famous.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie, Brockett, indeed all her friends were
whole-hearted in their congratulations; and David's tail kept up a
great wagging. He knew well that something pleasant had happened:
the whole atmosphere of the house was enough to inform a sagacious
person like David. Even Mary's little bright-coloured birds seemed
to take a firmer hold on existence; while out in the garden there
was much ado on the part of the proudly parental
pigeons&mdash;fledglings with huge heads and bleary eyes had
arrived to contribute to the general celebration. Ad&egrave;le went
singing about her work, for Jean had recently been promised
promotion, which meant that his savings, perhaps in a year, might
have grown large enough for them to marry.</p>

<p>Pierre bragged to his friend, the neighbouring baker, anent
Stephen's great eminence as a writer, and even Pauline cheered up a
little.</p>

<p>When Mary impressively ordered the meals, ordered this or that
delicacy for Stephen, Pauline would actually say with a smile:
'Mail oui, un grand genie doit nourrir le cerveau!'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duphot gained a passing importance in the eyes of
her pupils through having taught Stephen. She would nod her head
and remark very wisely: 'I always declare she become a great
author.' Then because she was truthful she would hastily add: 'I
mean that I knowed she was someone unusual.'</p>

<p>Buisson admitted that perhaps, after all, it was well that
Stephen had stuck to her writing. The book had been bought for
translation into French, a fact which had deeply impressed Monsieur
Buisson.</p>

<p>From Puddle came a long and triumphant letter: 'What did I tell
you? I knew you'd do it!...</p>

<p>Anna also wrote at some length to her daughter. And wonder of
wonders, from Violet Peacock there arrived an embarrassingly
gushing epistle. She would look Stephen up when next she was in
Paris; she was longing, so she said, to renew their old
friendship&mdash;after all, they two had been children
together.</p>

<p>Gazing at Mary with very bright eyes, Stephen's thoughts must
rush forward into the future. Puddle had been right, it was work
that counted&mdash;clever, hard-headed, understanding old
Puddle!</p>

<p>Then putting an arm round Mary's shoulder: 'Nothing shall ever
hurt you,' she would promise, feeling wonderfully self-sufficient
and strong, wonderfully capable of protecting.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>That summer they drove into Italy with David sitting up proudly
beside Burton. David barked at the peasants and challenged the dogs
and generally assumed a grand air of importance. They decided to
spend two months on Lake Como, and went to the Hotel Florence at
Bellagio. The hotel gardens ran down to the lake&mdash;it was all
very sunny and soothing and peaceful. Their days were passed in
making excursions, their evenings in drifting about on the water in
a little boat with a gaily striped awning, which latter seemed a
strange form of pleasure to David. Many of the guests at the
Florence were English, and not a few scraped an acquaintance with
Stephen, since nothing appears to succeed like success in a world
that is principally made up of failure. The sight of her book left
about in the lounge, or being devoured by some engrossed reader,
would make Stephen feel almost childishly happy; she would point
the phenomenon out to Mary.</p>

<p>'Look,' she would whisper, 'that man's reading my book!' For the
child is never far to seek in the author.</p>

<p>Some of their acquaintances were country folk and she found that
she was in sympathy with them. Their quiet and painstaking outlook
on life, their love of the soil, their care for their homes, their
traditions were after all a part of herself, bequeathed to her by
the founders of Morton. It gave her a very deep sense of pleasure
to see Mary accepted and made to feel welcome by these grey-haired
women and gentlemanly men; very seemly and fitting it appeared to
Stephen.</p>

<p>And now, since to each of us come moments of respite when the
mind refuses to face its problems, she resolutely thrust aside her
misgivings, those misgivings that whispered: 'Supposing they
knew&mdash;do you think they'd be so friendly to Mary?'</p>

<p>Of all those who sought them out that summer, the most cordial
were Lady Massey and her daughter. Lady Massey was a delicate
elderly woman who, in spite of poor health and encroaching years,
was untiring in her search for amusement&mdash;it amused her to
make friends with celebrated people. She was restless,
self-indulgent and not over sincere, a creature of whims and
ephemeral fancies; yet for Stephen and Mary she appeared to evince
a liking which was more than just on the surface. She would ask
them up to her sitting-room, would want them to sit with her in the
garden, and would sometimes insist upon communal meals, inviting
them to dine at her table. Agnes, the daughter, a jolly, red-haired
girl, had taken an immediate fancy to Mary, and their friendship
ripened with celerity, as is often the way during idle summers. As
for Lady Massey she petted Mary, and mothered her as though she
were a child, and soon she was mothering Stephen also.</p>

<p>She would say: 'I seem to have found two new children,' and
Stephen, who was in the mood to feel touched, grew quite attached
to this ageing woman. Agnes was engaged to a Colonel Fitzmaurice
who would probably join them that autumn in Paris. If he did so
they must all forgather at once, she insisted&mdash;he greatly
admired Stephen's book and had written that he was longing to meet
her. But Lady Massey went further than this in her enthusiastic
proffers of friendship&mdash;Stephen and Mary must stay with her in
Cheshire; she was going to give a house party at Branscombe Court
for Christmas; they must certainly come to her for Christmas.</p>

<p>Mary, who seemed elated at the prospect, was for ever discussing
this visit with Stephen: 'What sort of clothes shall I need, do you
think? Agnes says it's going to be quite a big party. I suppose
I'll want a few new evening dresses?' And one day she inquired:
'Stephen, when you were younger, did you ever go to Ascot or
Goodwood?'</p>

<p>Ascot and Goodwood, just names to Stephen; names that she had
despised in her youth, yet which now seemed not devoid of
importance since they stood for something beyond
themselves&mdash;something that ought to belong to Mary. She would
pick up a copy of <i>The Tatler</i> or <i>The Sketch</i>, which
Lady Massey received from England, and turning the pages would
stare at the pictures of securely established, self-satisfied
people&mdash;Miss this or that sitting on a shooting-stick, and
beside her the man she would shortly marry; Lady so-and-so with her
latest offspring; or perhaps some group at a country house. And
quite suddenly Stephen would feel less assured because in her heart
she must envy these people. Must envy these commonplace men and
women with their rather ridiculous shooting-sticks; their smiling
fiances; their husbands; their wives; their estates, and their
well-cared-for, placid children.</p>

<p>Mary would sometimes look over her shoulder with a new and
perhaps rather wistful interest. Then Stephen would close the paper
abruptly: 'Let's go for a row on the lake,' she might say, 'it's no
good wasting this glorious evening.'</p>

<p>But then she would remember the invitation to spend Christmas
with Lady Massey in Cheshire, and would suddenly start to build
castles in the air; supposing that she herself bought a small place
near Branscombe Court&mdash;near these kind new friends who seemed
to have grown so fond of Mary? Mary would also have her thoughts,
would be thinking of girls like Agnes Massey for whom life was
tranquil, easy and secure; girls to whom the world must seem
blessedly friendly. And then, with a little stab of pain, she would
suddenly remember her own exile from Morton. After such thoughts as
these she must hold Stephen's hand, must always sit very close to
Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>That autumn they saw a good deal of the Masseys, who had taken
their usual suite at the Ritz, and who often asked Mary and Stephen
to luncheon. Lady Massey, Agnes and Colonel Fitzmaurice, a pleasant
enough man, came and dined several times at the quiet old house in
the Rue Jacob, and those evenings were always exceedingly friendly,
Stephen talking of books with Colonel Fitzmaurice, while Lady
Massey enlarged upon Branscombe and her plans for the coming
Christmas party. Sometimes Stephen and Mary sent flowers to the
Ritz, hot-house plants or a large box of special roses&mdash;Lady
Massey liked to have her rooms full of flowers sent by friends, it
increased her sense of importance. By return would come loving
letters of thanks; she would write: 'I do thank my two very dear
children.'</p>

<p>In November she and Agnes returned to England, but the
friendship was kept up by correspondence, for Lady Massey was
prolific with her pen, indeed she was never more happy than when
writing. And now Mary bought the new evening dresses, and she
dragged Stephen off to choose some new ties. As the visit to
Branscombe Court drew near it was seldom out of their thoughts for
a moment&mdash;to Stephen it appeared like the first fruits of
toil; to Mary like the gateway into an existence that must be very
safe and reassuring.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen never knew what enemy had prepared the blow that was
struck by Lady Massey. Perhaps it had been Colonel Fitzmaurice who
might all the time have been hiding his suspicions; he must
certainly have known a good deal about Stephen&mdash;he had friends
who lived in the vicinity of Morton. Perhaps it had merely been
unkind gossip connected with Brockett or Val&eacute;rie Seymour,
with the people whom Mary and Stephen knew, although, as it
happened, Lady Massey had not met them. But after all, it mattered
so little; what did it matter how the thing had come about? By
comparison with the insult itself, its origin seemed very
unimportant.</p>

<p>It was in December that the letter arrived, just a week before
they were leaving for England. A long, rambling, pitifully tactless
letter, full of awkward and deeply wounding excuses:</p>

<p>'If I hadn't grown so fond of you both,' wrote Lady Massey,
'this would be much less painful&mdash;as it is the whole thing has
made me quite ill, but I must consider my position in the county.
You see, the county looks to me for a lead&mdash;above all I must
consider my daughter. The rumours that have reached me about you
and Mary&mdash;certain things that I don't want to enter
into&mdash;have simply forced me to break off our friendship and to
say that I must ask you not to come here for Christmas. Of course a
woman of my position with all eyes upon her has to be extra
careful. It's too terribly upsetting and sad for me; if I hadn't
been so fond of you both&mdash;but you know how attached I had
grown to Mary...' and so it went on; a kind of wail full of
self-importance combined with self-pity.</p>

<p>As Stephen read she went white to the lips, and Mary sprang up.
What's that letter you're reading?'</p>

<p>'It's from Lady Massey. It's about...it's about...' Her voice
failed.</p>

<p>Show it to me,' persisted Mary.</p>

<p>Stephen shook her head: No&mdash;I'd rather not.'</p>

<p>Then Mary asked: 'Is it about our visit?'</p>

<p>Stephen nodded: 'We're not going to spend Christmas at
Branscombe. Darling, it's all right&mdash;don't look like
that...</p>

<p>'But I want to know why we're not going to Branscombe.' And Mary
reached out and snatched the letter.</p>

<p>She read it through to the very last word, then she sat down
abruptly and burst out crying. She cried with the long, doleful
sobs of a child whom someone has struck without rhyme or reason:
Oh...and I thought they were fond of us...' she sobbed, 'I thought
that perhaps...they understood, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Then it seemed to Stephen that all the pain that had so far been
thrust upon her by existence, was as nothing to the unendurable
pain which she must now bear to hear that sobbing, to see Mary thus
wounded and utterly crushed, thus shamed and humbled for the sake
of her love, thus bereft of all dignity and protection.</p>

<p>She felt strangely helpless: 'Don't&mdash;don't,' she implored;
while tears of pity blurred her own eyes and went trickling slowly
down her scarred face. She had lost for the moment all sense of
proportion, of perspective, seeing in a vain, tactless woman a kind
of gigantic destroying angel; a kind of scourge laid upon her and
Mary. Surely never before had Lady Massey loomed so large as she
did in that hour to Stephen.</p>

<p>Mary's sobs gradually died away. She lay back in her chair, a
small, desolate figure, catching her breath from time to time,
until Stephen went to her and found her hand which she stroked with
cold and trembling fingers&mdash;but she could not find words of
consolation.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>That night Stephen took the girl roughly in her arms.</p>

<p>'I love you&mdash;I love you so much...' she stammered; and she
kissed Mary many times on the mouth, but cruelly so that her kisses
were pain&mdash;the pain in her heart leapt out through her lips:
'God! It's too terrible to love like this&mdash;it's
hell&mdash;there are times when I can't endure it!'</p>

<p>She was in the grip of strong nervous excitation; nothing seemed
able any more to appease her. She seemed to be striving to
obliterate, not only herself, but the whole hostile world through
some strange and agonized merging with Mary. It was terrible
indeed, very like unto death, and it left them both completely
exhausted.</p>

<p>The world had achieved its first real victory.</p>

<h3><a name="ch47" id="ch47"></a>Chapter Forty-seven</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Their Christmas was naturally overshadowed, and so, as it were
by a common impulse, they turned to such people as Barbara and
Jamie, people who would neither despise nor insult them. It was
Mary who suggested that Barbara and Jamie should be asked to share
their Christmas dinner, while Stephen who must suddenly pity Wanda
for a misjudged and very unfortunate genius, invited her
also&mdash;after all why note Wanda was more sinned against than
sinning. She drank, oh, yes, Wanda drowned her sorrows; everybody
knew that, and like Val&eacute;rie Seymour, Stephen hated drink
like the plague&mdash;but all the same she invited Wanda.</p>

<p>An ill wind it is that blows no one any good. Barbara and Jamie
accepted with rapture; but for Mary's most timely invitation, their
funds being low at the end of the year, they two must have gone
without Christmas dinner. Wanda also seemed glad enough to come, to
leave her enormous, turbulent canvas for the orderly peace of the
well-warmed house with its comfortable rooms and its friendly
servants. All three of them arrived a good hour before dinner,
which on this occasion would be in the evening.</p>

<p>Wanda had been up to Midnight Mass at the Sacr&eacute; Coeur,
she informed them gravely; and Stephen, reminded of Mademoiselle
Duphot, regretted that she had not offered her the motor. No doubt
she too had gone up to Montmartre for Midnight Mass&mdash;how
queer, she and Wanda. Wanda was quiet, depressed and quite sober;
she was wearing a straight-cut, simple black dress that somehow
suggested a species of cassock. And as often happened when Wanda
was sober, she repeated herself more than when she was drunk.</p>

<p>'I have been to the Sacr&eacute; Coeur,' she repeated, 'for the
Messe de Minuit; it was very lovely.'</p>

<p>But she did not reveal the tragic fact that her fear had
suddenly laid hold upon her at the moment of approaching the altar
rails, so that she had scuttled back to her seat, terrified of
receiving the Christmas Communion. Even a painfully detailed
confession of intemperance, of the lusts of the eyes and the mind,
of the very occasional sins of the body; even the absolution
accorded by a white-haired old priest who had spoken gently and
pitifully to his penitent, directing her prayers to the Sacred
Heart from which his own heart had derived its
compassion&mdash;even these things failed to give Wanda courage
when it came to the Christmas Communion. And now as she sat at
Stephen's table she ate little and drank but three glasses of wine;
nor did she ask for a cognac brandy when later they went to the
study for coffee, but must talk of the mighty temple of her faith
that watched day and night, night and day over Paris.</p>

<p>She said in her very perfect English: 'Is it not a great thing
that France has done? From every town and village in France has
come money to build that church at Montmartre. Many people have
purchased the stones of the church, and their names are carved on
those stones for ever. I am very much too hard up to do
that&mdash;and yet I would like to own a small stone. I would just
say: "From Wanda," because of course one need not bother about the
surname; mine is so long and so difficult to spell&mdash;yes, I
would ask them to say: "From Wanda."'</p>

<p>Jamie and Barbara listened politely, yet without sympathy and
without comprehension; while Mary must even smile a little at what
seemed to her like mere superstition. But Stephen's imagination was
touched, and she questioned Wanda about her religion. Then Wanda
turned grateful eyes upon Stephen and suddenly wanted to win her
friendship&mdash;she looked so reassuring and cairn sitting there
in her peaceful, book-lined study. A great writer she was, did not
everyone say so? And yet she was surely even as Wanda...Oh, but
Stephen had got the better of her fate, had wrestled with her fate
so that now it must serve her; that was fine, that was surely true
courage, true greatness! For that Christmas none save Mary might
know of the bitterness that was in Stephen's heart, least of all
the impulsive, erratic Wanda.</p>

<p>Wanda needed no second invitation to talk, and very soon her
eyes were aglow with the fire of the born religious fanatic as she
told of the little town in Poland, with its churches, its bells
that were always chiming&mdash;the Mass bells beginning at early
dawn, the Angelus bells, the Vesper bells&mdash;always calling,
calling, they were, said Wanda. Through the years of persecution
and strife, of wars and the endless rumours of wars that had
ravaged her most unhappy country, her people had clung to their
ancient faith like true children of Mother Church, said Wanda. She
herself had three brothers, and all of them priests; her parents
had been pious people, they were both dead now, had been dead for
some years; and Wanda signed her breast with the Cross, having
regard for the souls of her parents. Then she tried to explain the
meaning of her faith, but this she did exceedingly badly, finding
that words are not always easy when they must encompass the things
of the spirit, the things that she herself knew by instinct; and
then, too, these days her brain was not clear, thanks to brandy,
even when she was quite sober. The details of her coming to Paris
she omitted, but Stephen thought she could easily guess them, for
Wanda declared with a curious pride that her brothers were men of
stone and of iron. Saints they all were, according to Wanda,
uncompromising, fierce and relentless, seeing only the straight and
narrow path on each side of which yawned the fiery chasm.</p>

<p>'I was not as they were, ah, no!' she declared, 'Nor was I as my
father and mother; I was&mdash;I was...' She stopped speaking
abruptly, gazing at Stephen with her burning eyes which said quite
plainly: 'You know what I was, you understand.' And Stephen nodded,
divining the reason of Wanda's exile.</p>

<p>But suddenly Mary began to grow restless, putting an end to this
dissertation by starting the large, new gramophone which Stephen
had given her for Christmas. The gramophone blared out the latest
foxtrot, and jumping up, Barbara and Jamie started dancing, while
Stephen and Wanda moved chairs and tables, rolled back rugs and
explained to the barking David that he could not join in, but
might, if he chose, sit and watch them dance from the divan. Then
Wanda slipped an arm around Mary and they glided off; an
incongruous couple, the one clad as sombrely as any priest, the
other in her soft evening dress of blue chiffon. Mary lay gently
against Wanda's arm, and she seemed to Stephen a very perfect
dancer&mdash;lighting a cigarette, she watched them. The dance
over, Mary put on a new record; she was flushed and her eyes were
considerably brighter.</p>

<p>'Why did you never tell met' Stephen murmured.</p>

<p>'Tell you what?'</p>

<p>'Why, that you danced so well.'</p>

<p>Mary hesitated, then she murmured back: 'You didn't dance, so
what was the good?'</p>

<p>'Wanda, you must teach me to foxtrot,' smiled Stephen.</p>

<p>Jamie was blundering round the room with Barbara clasped to her
untidy bosom; then she and Barbara started to sing the harmless,
but foolish words of the foxtrot&mdash;if the servants were singing
their old Breton hymns along in the kitchen, no one troubled to
listen. Growing hilarious, Jamie sang louder spinning with Barbara,
gyrating wildly, until Barbara, between laughing and coughing, must
implore her to stop, must beg for mercy.</p>

<p>Wanda said: 'You might have a lesson now, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Putting her hands on Stephen's shoulders, she began to explain
the more simple steps, which did not appear at all hard to Stephen.
The music seemed to have got into her feet so that her feet must
follow its rhythm. She discovered to her own very great amazement
that she liked this less formal modern dancing, and after a while
she was clasping Mary quite firmly, and they moved away together
while Wanda stood calling out her instructions:</p>

<p>'Take much longer steps! Keep your knees
straight&mdash;straighter! Don't get so much to the
side&mdash;look, it's this way&mdash;hold her this way; always
stand square to your partner.'</p>

<p>The lesson went on for a good two hours, until even Mary seemed
somewhat exhausted. She suddenly rang the bell for Pierre, who
appeared with the tray of simple supper. Then Mary did an unusual
thing&mdash;she poured herself out a whisky and soda.</p>

<p>'I'm tired,' she explained rather fretfully in answer to
Stephen's look of surprise; and she frowned as she turned her back
abruptly. But Wanda shied away from the brandy as a frightened
horse will shy from fire; she drank two large glasses of
lemonade&mdash;an extremist she was in all things, this Wanda.
Quite soon she announced that she must go home to bed, because of
her latest picture which required every ounce of strength she had
in her; but before she went she said eagerly to Stephen:</p>

<p>'Do let me show you the Sacr&eacute; Coeur. You have seen it of
course, but only as a tourist; that is not really seeing it at all,
you must come there with me.'</p>

<p>'All right,' agreed Stephen.</p>

<p>When Jamie and Barbara had departed in their turn, Stephen took
Mary into her arms: 'Dearest...has it been a fairly nice Christmas
after all?' she inquired almost timidly.</p>

<p>Mary kissed her: 'Of course it's been a nice Christmas.' Then
her youthful face suddenly changed in expression, the grey eyes
growing hard, the mouth resentful: 'Damn that woman for what she's
done to us, Stephen&mdash;the insolence of it! But I've learnt my
lesson; we've got plenty of friends without Lady Massey and Agnes,
friends to whom we're not moral lepers.' And she laughed, a queer,
little joyless laugh.</p>

<p>Stephen flinched, remembering Brockett's warning.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Wanda's chastened and temperate mood persisted for several
weeks, and while it was on her she clung like a drowning man to
Stephen, haunting the house from morning until night, dreading to
be alone for a moment. It cannot be said that Stephen suffered her
gladly, for now with the New Year she was working hard on a series
of articles and short stories; unwilling to visualize defeat, she
began once again to sharpen her weapon. But something in Wanda's
poor efforts to keep sober, in her very dependence, was deeply
appealing, so that Stephen would put aside her work, feeling loath
to desert the unfortunate creature.</p>

<p>Several times they made a long pilgrimage on foot to the church
of the Sacr&eacute; Coeur; just they two, for Mary would never go
with them; she was prejudiced against Wanda's religion. They would
climb the steep streets with their flights of steps, grey streets,
grey steps leading up from the city. Wanda's eyes would always be
fixed on their goal&mdash;pilgrim eyes they would often seem to
Stephen. Arrived at the church she and Wanda would stand looking
down between the tall, massive columns of the porch, on a Paris of
domes and mists, only half revealed by the fitful sunshine. The air
would seem pure up there on the height, pure and tenuous as a thing
of the spirit. And something in that mighty temple of faith, that
amazing thrust towards the sublime, that silent yet articulate cry
of a nation to its God, would awaken a response in Stephen, so that
she would seem to be brushing the hem of an age-old and rather
terrible mystery&mdash;the eternal mystery of good and evil.</p>

<p>Inside the church would be brooding shadows, save where the wide
lakes of amber fire spread out from the endless votive candles.
Above the high altar the monstranced Host would gleam curiously
white in the light of the candles. The sound of praying,
monotonous, low, insistent, would come from those who prayed with
extended arms, with crucified arms, all day and all night for the
sins of Paris.</p>

<p>Wanda would make her way to the statue of the silver Christ with
one hand on His heart, and the other held out in supplication.
Kneeling down she would sign herself with His Cross, then cover her
eyes and forget about Stephen. Standing quietly behind her Stephen
would wonder what Wanda was saying to the silver Christ, what the
silver Christ was saying to Wanda. She would think that He looked
very weary, this Christ Who must listen to so many supplications.
Queer, unbidden thoughts came to her at such moments; this Man Who
was God, a God Who waited, could He answer the riddle of Wanda's
existence, of her own existence? If she asked, could He answer?
What if she were suddenly to cry out loudly: 'Look at us, we are
two yet we stand for many. Our name is legion and we also are
waiting, we also are tired, oh, but terribly tired...Will You give
us some hope of ultimate release? Will You tell us the secret of
our salvation?'</p>

<p>Wanda would rise from her prayers rather stiffly to purchase a
couple of votive candles, and when she had stuck them into the
sconce she would touch the foot of the silver Christ as she bade
Him farewell&mdash;a time-honoured custom. Then she and Stephen
might turn again to the lake of fire that flowed round the
monstrance.</p>

<p>But one morning when they arrived at the church, the monstrance
was not above the high altar. The altar had just been garnished and
swept, so the Host was still in the Lady Chapel. And while they
stood there and gazed at the Host, came a priest and with him a
grey-haired server; they would bear their God back again to His
home, to the costly shrine of His endless vigil. The server must
first light his little lantern suspended from a pole, and must then
grasp his bell. The priest must lift his Lord from the monstrance
and lay Him upon a silken cover, and carry Him as a man carries a
child&mdash;protectively, gently, yet strongly withal, as though
some frustrated paternal instinct were finding in this a divine
expression. The lantern swung rhythmically to and fro, the bell
rang out its imperative warning; then the careful priest followed
after the server who cleared his path to the great high altar. And
even as once very long ago, such a bell had been the herald of
death in the putrefying hand of the leper: 'Unclean! Unclean!'
death and putrefaction&mdash;the warning bell in the dreadful hand
that might never again know the clasp of the healthful&mdash;so now
the bell rang out the approach of supreme purity, of the Healer of
lepers, earthbound through compassion; but compassion so vast, so
urgent, that the small, white disc of the Host must contain the
whole suffering universe. Thus the Prisoner of love Who could never
break free while one spiritual leper remained to be healed, passed
by on His patient way, heavy-laden.</p>

<p>Wanda suddenly fell to her knees, striking her lean and
unfruitful breast, for as always she very shamefully feared, and
her fear was a bitter and most deadly insult. With downcast eyes
and trembling hands she cowered at the sight of her own salvation.
But Stephen stood upright and curiously still, staring into the
empty Lady Chapel.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch48" id="ch48"></a>Chapter Forty-eight</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>That spring they made their first real acquaintance with the
garish and tragic night life of Paris that lies open to such people
as Stephen Gordon.</p>

<p>Until now they had never gone out much at night except to
occasional studio parties, or occasional caf&eacute;s of the milder
sort for a cup of coffee with Barbara and Jamie; but that spring
Mary seemed fanatically eager to proclaim her allegiance to Pat's
miserable army. Deprived of the social intercourse which to her
would have been both natural and welcome, she now strove to stand
up to a hostile world by proving that she could get on without it.
The spirit of adventure that had taken her to France, the pluck
that had steadied her while in the Unit, the emotional, hot-headed
nature of the Celt, these things must now work together in Mary to
produce a state of great restlessness, a pitiful revolt against
life's injustice. The blow struck by a weak and thoughtless hand
had been even more deadly than Stephen had imagined; more deadly to
them both, for that glancing blow coming at a time of apparent
success, had torn from them every shred of illusion.</p>

<p>Stephen, who could see that the girl was fretting, would be
seized with a kind of sick apprehension, a sick misery at her own
powerlessness to provide a more normal and complete existence. So
many innocent recreations, so many harmless social pleasures must
Mary forego for the sake of their union&mdash;and she still young,
still well under thirty. And now Stephen came face to face with the
gulf that lies between warning and realization&mdash;all her
painful warnings anent the world had not served to lessen the blow
when it fell, had not served to make it more tolerable to Mary.
Deeply humiliated Stephen would fed, when she thought of Mary's
exile from Morton, when she thought of the insults this girl must
endure because of her loyalty and her faith&mdash;all that Mary was
losing that belonged to her youth, would rise up at this time to
accuse and scourge Stephen. Her courage would flicker like a lamp
in the wind, and would all but go out; she would feel less
steadfast, less capable of continuing the war, that ceaseless war
for the right to existence. Then the pen would slip from her
nerveless fingers, no longer a sharp and purposeful weapon. Yes,
that spring saw a weakening in Stephen herself&mdash;she felt
tired, and sometimes very old for her age, in spite of her vigorous
mind and body.</p>

<p>Calling Mary, she would need to be reassured; and one day she
asked her: 'How much do you love me?'</p>

<p>Mary answered: So much that I'm growing to hate...' Bitter words
to hear on such young lips as Mary's.</p>

<p>And now there were days when Stephen herself would long for some
palliative, some distraction; when her erstwhile success seemed
like Dead Sea fruit, her will to succeed a grotesque presumption.
Who was she to stand out against the whole world, against those
ruthless, pursuing millions bent upon the destruction of her and
her kind? And she but one poor, inadequate creature. She would
start to pace up and down her study; up and down, up and down, a
most desolate pacing; even as years ago her father had paced his
quiet study at Morton. Then those treacherous nerves of hers would
betray her, so that when Mary came in with David&mdash;he a little
depressed, sensing something amiss&mdash;she would often turn on
the girl and speak sharply.</p>

<p>'Where on earth have you been e'</p>

<p>Only out for a walk. I walked round to Jamie's, Barbara's not
well; I sent her in a few tins of Brand's jelly.'</p>

<p>'You've no right to go off without letting me know where you're
going&mdash;I've told you before I won't have it!' Her voice would
be harsh, and Mary would flush, unaware of those nerves that were
strained to breaking.</p>

<p>As though grasping at something that remained secure, they would
go to see the kind Mademoiselle Duphot, but less often than they
had done in the past, for a feeling of guilt would come upon
Stephen. Looking at the gentle and foal-like face with its innocent
eyes behind the strong glasses, she would think: 'We're here under
false pretences. If she knew what we were, she'd have none of us,
either. Brockett was right, we should stick to our kind.' So they
went less and less to see Mademoiselle Duphot.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle said with mild resignation: 'It is natural for now
our St&eacute;venne is famous. Why should she waste her time upon
us? I am more than content to have been her teacher.'</p>

<p>But the sightless Julie shook her head sadly: 'It is not like
that; you mistake, my sister. I can feel a great desolation in
St&eacute;venne&mdash;and some of the youngness has gone from Mary.
What can it be? My fingers grow blind when I ask them the cause of
that desolation.'</p>

<p>'I will pray for them both to the Sacred Heart which comprehends
all things,' said Mademoiselle Duphot.</p>

<p>And indeed her own heart would have tried to
understand&mdash;but Stephen had grown very bitterly
mistrustful.</p>

<p>And so now, in good earnest they turned to their kind, for as
Puddle had truly divined in the past, it is 'like to like' for such
people as Stephen. Thus when Pat walked in unexpectedly one day to
invite them to join a party that night at the Ideal Bar, Stephen
did not oppose Mary's prompt and all too eager acceptance.</p>

<p>Pat said they were going to do the round. Wanda was coming and
probably Brockett. Dickie West the American aviator was in Paris,
and she also had promised to join them. Oh, yes, and then there was
Val&eacute;rie Seymour&mdash;Val&eacute;rie was being dug out of
her hole by Jeanne Maurel, her most recent conquest. Pat supposed
that Val&eacute;rie would drink lemon squash and generally act as a
douche of cold water, she was sure to grow sleepy or disapproving,
she was no acquisition to this sort of party. But could they rely
upon Stephen's car? In the cold, grey dawn of the morning after,
taxis were sometimes scarce up at Montmartre. Stephen nodded,
thinking how absurdly prim Pat looked to be talking of cold, grey
dawns and all that they stood for up at Montmartre. After she had
left, Stephen frowned a little.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>The five women were seated at a table near the door when Mary
and Stephen eventually joined them. Pat, looking gloomy, was
sipping light beer. Wanda, with the fires of hell in her eyes, in
the hell of a temper too, drank brandy. She had started to drink
pretty heavily again, and had therefore been avoiding Stephen just
lately. There were only two new faces at the table, that of Jeanne
Maurel, and of Dickie West, the much-discussed woman aviator.</p>

<p>Dickie was short, plump and very young; she could not have been
more than twenty-one and she still looked considerably under
twenty. She was wearing a little dark blue beret; round her neck
was knotted an Apache scarf&mdash;for the rest she was dressed in a
neat serge suit with a very well cut double-breasted jacket. Her
face was honest, her teeth rather large, her lips chapped and her
skin much weather-beaten. She looked like a pleasant and
nice-minded schoolboy well soaped and scrubbed for some gala
occasion. When she spoke her voice was a little too hearty. She
belonged to the younger, and therefore more reckless, more
aggressive and self-assured generation; a generation that was
marching to battle with much swagger, much sounding of drums and
trumpets, a generation that had come after war to wage a new war on
a hostile creation. Being mentally very well clothed and well shod,
they had as yet left no blood-stained foot-prints; they were
hopeful as yet, refusing point-blank to believe in the existence of
a miserable army. They said: 'We are as we are; what about it, We
don't care a damn, in fact we're delighted!' And being what they
were they must go to extremes, must quite often outdo men in their
sinning; yet the sins that they had were the sins of youth, the
sins of defiance born of oppression. But Dickie was in no way
exceptionally vile&mdash;she lived her life much as a man would
have lived it. And her heart was so loyal, so trustful, so kind
that it caused her much shame and much secret blushing. Generous as
a lover, she was even more so when there could not be any question
of loving. Like the horseleech's daughter, her friends cried:
'Give! Give!' and Dickie gave lavishly, asking no questions. An
appeal never left her completely unmoved, and suspecting this, most
people went on appealing. She drank wine in moderation, smoked
Camel cigarettes till her fingers were brown, and admired stage
beauties. Her greatest defect was practical joking of the kind that
passes all seemly limits. Her jokes were dangerous, even cruel at
times&mdash;in her jokes Dickie quite lacked imagination.</p>

<p>Jeanne Maurel was tall, almost as tall as Stephen. An elegant
person wearing pearls round her throat above a low cut white satin
waistcoat. She was faultlessly tailed and faultlessly barbered; her
dark, severe Eton crop fitted neatly. Her profile was Greek, her
eyes a bright blue&mdash;altogether a very arresting young woman.
So far she had had quite a busy life doing nothing in particular
and everything in general. But now she was Val&eacute;rie Seymour's
lover, attaining at last to a certain distinction.</p>

<p>And Val&eacute;rie was sitting there calm and aloof, her glance
roving casually round the caf&eacute;, not too critically, yet as
though she would say: 'Enfin, the whole world has grown very ugly,
but no doubt to some people this represents pleasure.'</p>

<p>From the stained bar counter at the end of the room came the
sound of Monsieur Pujol's loud laughter. Monsieur Pujol was affable
to his clients, oh, but very, indeed he was almost paternal. Yet
nothing escaped his cold, black eyes&mdash;a great expert he was in
his way, Monsieur Pujol. There are many collections that a man may
indulge in; old china, glass, pictures, watches and bibelots; rare
editions, tapestries, priceless jewels. Monsieur Pujol snapped his
fingers at such things, they lacked life&mdash;Monsieur Pujol
collected inverts. Amazingly morbid of Monsieur Pujol, and he with
the face of an ageing dragoon, and he just married en secondes
notes, and already with six legitimate children. A fine, purposeful
sire he had been and still was, with his young wife shortly
expecting a baby. Oh, yes, the most aggressively normal of men, as
none knew better than the poor Madame Pujol. Yet behind the bar was
a small, stuffy sanctum in which this strange man catalogued his
collection. The walls of the sanctum were thickly hung with signed
photographs, and a good few sketches. At the back of each frame was
a neat little number corresponding to that in a locked leather
notebook&mdash;it had long been his custom to write up his notes
before going home with the milk in the morning. People saw their
own faces but not their numbers&mdash;no client suspected that
locked leather notebook.</p>

<p>To this room would come Monsieur Pujol's old cronies for a bock
or a petit verre before business; and sometimes, like many another
collector, Monsieur Pujol would permit himself to grow prosy. His
friends knew most of the pictures by heart; knew their histories
too, almost as well as he did; but in spite of this fact he would
weary his guests by repeating many a threadbare story.</p>

<p>'A fine lot, n'est-ce pas?' he would say with a grin. 'See that
man e Ah, yes&mdash;a really great poet. He drank himself to death.
In those days it was absinthe&mdash;they liked it because it gave
them courage. That one would come here like a scared white rat, but
Cr&eacute;nom! when he left he would bellow like a bull&mdash;the
absinthe, of course&mdash;it gave them great courage.' Or: 'That
woman over there, what a curious head! I remember her very well,
she was German. Else Weining, her name was&mdash;before the war she
would come here with a girl she'd picked up here in Paris, just a
common whore, a most curious business. They were deeply in love.
They would sit at a table in the corner&mdash;I can show you their
actual table. They never talked much and they drank very little; as
far as the drink went those two were bad clients, but so
interesting that I did not much mind&mdash;I grew almost attached
to Else Weining. Sometimes she would come all alone, come early.
"Pu," she would say in her hideous French; "Pu, she must never go
back to that hell." Hell! Sacr&eacute;nom&mdash;she to call it
hell! Amazing they are, I tell you, these people. Well, the girl
went back, naturally she went back, and Else drowned herself in the
Srine. Amazing they are&mdash;ces invertis, I tell you!'</p>

<p>But not all the histories were so tragic as this one; Monsieur
Pujol found some of them quite amusing. Quarrels galore he was able
to relate, and light infidelities by the dozen. He would mimic a
manner of speech, a gesture, a walk&mdash;he was really quite a
good mimic&mdash;and when he did this his friends were not bored;
they would sit there and split their sides with amusement.</p>

<p>And now Monsieur Pujol was laughing himself, cracking jokes as
he covertly watched his clients. From where she and Mary sat near
the door, Stephen could hear his loud, jovial laughter.</p>

<p>'Lord,' sighed Pat, unenlivened as yet by the beer; 'some people
do seem to feel real good this evening.'</p>

<p>Wanda, who disliked the ingratiating Pujol, and whose nerves
were on edge, had begun to grow angry. She had caught a
particularly gross blasphemy, gross even for this age of stupid
blaspheming. 'Le salaud!' she shouted, then, inflamed by drink, an
epithet even less complimentary.</p>

<p>'Hush up, do!' exclaimed the scandalized Pat, hastily gripping
Wanda's shoulder.</p>

<p>But Wanda was out to defend her faith, and she did it in
somewhat peculiar language.</p>

<p>People had begun to turn round and stare; Wanda was causing
quite a diversion. Dickie grinned and skilfully egged her on, not
perceiving the tragedy that was Wanda. For in spite of her tender
and generous heart, Dickie was still but a crude young creature,
one who had not yet learnt how to shiver and shake, and had thus
remained but a crude young creature. Stephen glanced anxiously at
Mary, half deciding to break up this turbulent party; but Mary was
sitting with her chin on her hand, quite unruffled, it seemed, by
Wanda's outburst. When her eyes met Stephen's she actually smiled,
then took the cigarette that Jeanne Maurel was offering; and
something in this placid, self-assured indifference went so ill
with her youth that it startled Stephen. She in her turn must
quickly light a cigarette, while Pat still endeavoured to silence
Wanda.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie said with her enigmatic smile: 'Shall we now go
on to our next entertainment?'</p>

<p>They paid the bill and persuaded Wanda to postpone her abuse of
the ingratiating Pujol. Stephen took one arm, Dickie West the
other, and between them they coaxed her into the motor; after which
they all managed to squeeze themselves in&mdash;that is, all except
Dickie, who sat by the driver in order to guide the innocent
Burton.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>At Le Narcisse they surprised what at first appeared to be the
most prosaic of family parties. It was late, yet the mean room was
empty of clients, for Le Narcisse seldom opened its eyes until
midnight had chimed from the church docks of Paris. Seated at a
table with a red and white cloth were the Patron and a lady with a
courtesy tide. 'Madame,' she was called. And with them was a girl,
and a handsome young man with severely plucked eyebrows. Their
relationship to each other was...well...all the same, they
suggested a family party. As Stephen pushed open the shabby swing
door, they were placidly engaged upon playing belote.</p>

<p>The walls of the room were hung with mirrors thickly painted
with cupids, thickly sullied by flies. A faint blend of odours was
wafted from the kitchen which stood in proximity to the toilet. The
host rose at once and shook hands with his guests. Every bar had
its social customs, it seemed. At the Ideal one must share Monsieur
Pujol's lewd jokes; at Le Narcisse one must gravely shake hands
with the Patron.</p>

<p>The Patron was tall and exceedingly thin&mdash;a clean-shaven
man with the mouth of an ascetic. His cheeks were delicately tinted
with rouge, his eyelids delicately shaded with kohl; but the eyes
themselves were an infantile blue, reproachful and rather surprised
in expression.</p>

<p>For the good of the house, Dickie ordered champagne; it was warm
and sweet and unpleasantly heady. Only Jeanne and Mary and Dickie
herself had the courage to sample this curious beverage. Wanda
stuck to her brandy and Pat to her beer, while Stephen drank
coffee; but Val&eacute;rie Seymour caused some confusion by gently
insisting on a lemon squash&mdash;to be made with fresh lemons.
Presently the guests began to arrive in couples. Having seated
themselves at the tables, they quickly became oblivious to the
world, what with the sickly champagne and each other. From a hidden
recess there emerged a woman with a basket full of protesting
roses. The stout vendeuse wore a wide wedding ring&mdash;for was
she not a most virtuous persona But her glance was both calculating
and shrewd as she pounced upon the more obvious couples; and
Stephen watching her progress through the room, felt suddenly
ashamed on behalf of the roses. And now at a nod from the host
there was music; and now at a bray from the band there was dancing.
Dickie and Wanda opened the ball&mdash;Dickie stodgy and firm,
Wanda rather unsteady. Others followed. Then Mary leant over the
table and whispered:</p>

<p>'Won't you dance with me, Stephen?'</p>

<p>Stephen hesitated, but only for a moment. Then she got up
abruptly and danced with Mary.</p>

<p>The handsome young man with the tortured eyebrows was bowing
politely before Val&eacute;rie Seymour. Refused by her, he passed
on to Pat, and to Jeanne's great amusement was promptly
accepted.</p>

<p>Brockett arrived and sat down at the table. He was in his most
prying and cynical humour. He watched Stephen with coldly observant
eyes, watched Dickie guiding the swaying Wanda, watched Pat in the
arms of the handsome young man, watched the whole bumping, jostling
crowd of dancers.</p>

<p>The blended odours were becoming more active. Brockett lit a
cigarette. 'Well, Val&eacute;rie, darling? You look like an
outraged Elgin marble. Be kind, dear, be kind; you must live and
let live, this is life...' And he waved his soft, white hands.
'Observe it&mdash;it's very wonderful, darling. This is life, love,
defiance, emancipation!'</p>

<p>Said Val&eacute;rie with her calm little smile: 'I think I
preferred it when we were all martyrs!'</p>

<p>The dancers drifted back to their seats and Brockett manoeuvred
to sit beside Stephen. 'You and Mary dance well together,' he
murmured. 'Are you happy? Are you enjoying yourselves?'</p>

<p>Stephen, who hated this inquisitive mood, this mood that would
feed upon her emotions, turned away as she answered him, rather
coldly: 'Yes, thanks&mdash;we're not having at all a bad
evening.'</p>

<p>And now the Patron was standing by their table; bowing slightly
to Brockett he started singing. His voice was a high and sweet
baritone; his song was of love that must end too soon, of life that
in death is redeemed by ending. An extraordinary song to hear in
such a place&mdash;melancholy and very sentimental. Some of the
couples had tears in their eyes&mdash;tears that had probably
sprung from champagne quite as much as from that melancholy
singing. Brockett ordered a fresh bottle to console the Patron.
Then he waved him away with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>There ensued more dancing, more ordering of drinks, more
dalliance by the amorous couples. The Patron's mood changed, and
now he must sing songs of the lowest boites in Paris. As he sang he
skipped like a performing dog, grimacing, beating time with his
hands, conducting the chorus that rose from the tables.</p>

<p>Brockett sighed as he shrugged his shoulders in disgust, and
once again Stephen glanced at Mary; but Mary, she saw, had not
understood that song with its inexcusable meaning. Val&eacute;rie
was talking to Jeanne Maurel, talking about her villa at St.
Tropez; talking of the garden, the sea, the sky, the design she had
drawn for a green marble fountain. Stephen could hear her charming
voice, so cultured, so cool&mdash;itself cool as a fountain; and
she marvelled at this woman's perfect poise, the genius she
possessed for complete detachment; Val&eacute;rie had closed her
ears to that song, and not only her ears but her mind and
spirit.</p>

<p>The place was becoming intolerably hot, the room too
over-crowded for dancing. Lids drooped, mouths sagged, heads lay
upon shoulders&mdash;there was kissing, much kissing at a table in
the corner. The air was foetid with drink and all the rest;
unbreathable it appeared to Stephen. Dickie yawned an enormous
uncovered yawn; she was still young enough to feel rather sleepy.
But Wanda was being seduced by her eyes, the lust of the eye was
heavy upon her, so that Pat must shake a lugubrious head and begin
to murmur anent General Custer.</p>

<p>Brockett got up and paid the bill; he was sulky, it seemed,
because Stephen had snubbed him. He had not spoken for quite half
an hour, and refused point-blank to accompany them further. 'I'm
going home to my bed, thanks&mdash;good morning,' he said crossly,
as they crowded into the motor.</p>

<p>They drove to a couple more bars, but at these they remained for
only a few minutes. Dickie said they were dull and Jeanne Maurel
agreed&mdash;she suggested that they should go on to Alec's.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie lifted an eyebrow and groaned. She was terribly
bored, she was terribly hungry. 'I do wish I could get some cold
chicken,' she murmured.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>As long as she lived Stephen never forgot her first impressions
of the bar known as Alec's&mdash;that meeting-place of the most
miserable of all those who comprised the miserable army. That
merciless, drug-dealing, death-dealing haunt to which flocked the
battered remnants of men whom their fellow-men had at last stamped
under; who, despised of the world, must despise themselves beyond
all hope, it seemed, of salvation. There they sat, closely herded
together at the tables, creatures shabby yet tawdry, timid yet
defiant&mdash;and their eyes, Stephen never forgot their eyes,
those haunted, tormented eyes of the invert.</p>

<p>Of all ages, all degrees of despondency, all grades of mental
and physical ill-being, they must yet laugh shrilly from time to
time, must yet tap their feet to the rhythm of music, must yet
dance together in response to the band&mdash;and that dance seemed
the Dance of Death to Stephen. On more than one hand was a large,
ornate ring, on more than one wrist a conspicuous bracelet; they
wore jewellery that might only be worn by these men when they thus
gathered together. At Alec's they could dare to give way to such
tastes&mdash;what was left of themselves they became at Alec's.</p>

<p>Bereft of all social dignity, of all social charts contrived for
man's guidance, of the fellowship that by right divine should
belong to each breathing, living creature; abhorred, spat upon,
from their earliest days the prey to a ceaseless persecution, they
were now even lower than their enemies knew, and more hopeless than
the veriest dregs of creation. For since all that to many of them
had seemed fine, a fine selfless and at times even noble emotion,
had been covered with shame, called unholy and vile, so gradually
they themselves had sunk down to the level upon which the world
placed their emotions. And looking with abhorrence upon these men,
drink-sodden, doped as were only too many, Stephen yet felt that
some terrifying thing stalked abroad in that unhappy room at
Alec's; terrifying because if there were a God His anger must rise
at such vast injustice. More pitiful even than her lot was theirs,
and because of them mighty should be the world's reckoning.</p>

<p>Alec the tempter, the vendor of dreams, the dispenser of
illusions whiter than snow; Alec, who sold little packets of
cocaine for large bundles of notes, was now opening wine, with a
smile and a flourish, at the next-door table.</p>

<p>He set down the bottle: 'Et voil&agrave;, mes filles!'</p>

<p>Stephen looked at the men; they seemed quite complacent.</p>

<p>Against the wall sat a bald, flabby man whose fingers crept over
an amber chaplet. His lips moved; God alone knew to whom he prayed,
and God alone knew what prayers he was praying&mdash;horrible he
was, sitting there all alone with that infamous chaplet between his
fingers.</p>

<p>The band struck up a one-step. Dickie still danced, but with
Pat, for Wanda was now beyond dancing. But Stephen would not dance,
not among these men, and she laid a restraining hand upon Mary.
Despite her sense of their terrible affliction, she could not dance
in this place with Mary.</p>

<p>A youth passed with a friend and the couple were blocked by the
press of dancers in front of her table. He bent forward, this
youth, until his face was almost on a level with Stephen's&mdash;a
grey, drug-marred face with a mouth that trembled incessantly.</p>

<p>'Ma soeur,' he whispered.</p>

<p>For a moment she wanted to strike that face with her naked fist,
to obliterate it. Then all of a sudden she perceived the eyes and
the memory came of a hapless creature, distracted, bleeding from
bursting lungs, hopelessly pursued, glancing this way, then that,
as though looking for something, some refuge, some hope&mdash;and
the thought: 'It's looking for God who made it.'</p>

<p>Stephen shivered and stared at her tightly clenched hands; the
nails whitened her flesh. 'Mon fr&egrave;re,' she muttered.</p>

<p>And now someone was making his way through the crowd, a quiet,
tawny man with the eyes of the Hebrew; Adolphe Blanc, the gentle
and learned Jew, sat down in Dickie's seat beside Stephen. And he
patted her knee as though she were young, very young and in great
need of consolation.</p>

<p>'I have seen you for quite a long time, Miss Gordon. I've been
sitting just over there by the window.' Then he greeted the others,
but the greeting over he appeared to forget their very existence;
he had come, it seemed, only to talk to Stephen.</p>

<p>He said: 'This place&mdash;these poor men, they have shocked
you. I've been watching you in between the dances. They are
terrible, Miss Gordon, because they are those who have fallen but
have not risen again&mdash;there is surely no sin so great for
them, so unpardonable as the sin of despair; yet as surely you and
I can forgive...</p>

<p>She was silent, not knowing what she should answer.</p>

<p>But he went on, in no way deterred by her silence. He spoke
softly, as though for her ears alone, and yet as a man might speak
when consumed by the flame of some urgent and desperate mission. 'I
am glad that you have come to this place, because those who have
courage have also a duty.'</p>

<p>She nodded without comprehending his meaning.</p>

<p>'Yes, I am glad that you have come here,' he repeated. 'In this
little room, tonight, every night, there is so much misery, so much
despair, that the walls seem almost too narrow to contain
it&mdash;many have grown callous, many have grown vile, but these
things in themselves are despair, Miss Gordon. Yet outside there
are happy people who sleep the sleep of the so-called just and
righteous. When they wake it will be to persecute those who,
through no fault of their own, have been set apart from the day of
their birth, deprived of all sympathy, all understanding. They are
thoughtless, these happy people who sleep&mdash;and who is there to
make them think, Miss Gordon?'</p>

<p>'They can read,' she stammered, 'there are many books...'</p>

<p>But he shook his head. 'Do you think they are students? Ah, but
no, they will not read medical books; what do such people care for
the doctors? And what doctor can know the entire truth? Many times
they meet only the neurasthenics, those of us for whom life has
proved too bitter. They are good, these doctors&mdash;some of them
very good; they work hard trying to solve our problem, but half the
time they must work in the dark&mdash;the whole truth is known only
to the normal invert. The doctors cannot make the ignorant think,
cannot hope to bring home the sufferings of millions; only one of
ourselves can some day do that...It will need great courage but it
will be done, because all things must work toward ultimate good;
there is no real wastage and no destruction.' He lit a cigarette
and stared thoughtfully at her for a moment or two. Then he touched
her hand. 'Do you comprehend? There is no destruction.'</p>

<p>She said: 'When one comes to a place like this, one feels
horribly sad and humiliated. One feels that the odds are too
heavily against any real success, any real achievement. Where so
many have failed who can hope to succeed? Perhaps this is the
end.'</p>

<p>Adolphe Blanc met her eyes. 'You are wrong, very
wrong&mdash;this is only the beginning. Many die, many kill their
bodies and souls, but they cannot kill the justice of God, even
they cannot kill the eternal spirit. From their very degradation
that spirit will rise up to demand of the world compassion and
justice.'</p>

<p>Strange&mdash;this man was actually speaking her thoughts, yet
again she fell silent, unable to answer.</p>

<p>Dickie and Pat came back to the table, and Adolphe Blanc slipped
quietly away; when Stephen glanced round his place was empty, nor
could she perceive him crossing the room through the press and maze
of those terrible dancers.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Dickie went sound asleep in the car with her head against Pat's
inhospitable shoulder. When they got to her hotel she wriggled and
stretched. 'Is it...is it time to get up?' she murmured.</p>

<p>Next came Val&eacute;rie Seymour and Jeanne Maurel to be dropped
at the flat on the Quai Voltaire; then Pat who lived a few streets
away, and last but not least the drunken Wanda. Stephen had to lift
her out of the car and then get her upstairs as best she could,
assisted by Burton and followed by Mary. It took quite a long time,
and arrived at the door, Stephen must hunt for a missing
latchkey.</p>

<p>'When they finally got home, Stephen sank into a chair. 'Good
Lord, what a night&mdash;it was pretty awful.' She was filled with
the deep depression and disgust that are apt to result from such
excursions.</p>

<p>But Mary pretended to a callousness that in truth she was very
far from feeling, for life had not yet dulled her finer instincts;
so far it had only aroused her anger. She yawned. 'Well, at least
we could dance together without being thought freaks; there was
something in that. Beggars can't be choosers in this world,
Stephen!'</p>

<h3><a name="ch49" id="ch49"></a>Chapter Forty-nine</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>On a fine June day Ad&egrave;le married her Jean in the church
of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires&mdash;the shrine of innumerable candles
and prayers, of the bountiful Virgin who bestows many graces. From
early dawn the quiet old house in the Rue Jacob had been in a
flutter&mdash;Pauline preparing the d&eacute;jeuner de noces,
Pierre garnishing and sweeping their sitting-room, and both of them
pausing from time to time to embrace the flushed cheeks of their
happy daughter.</p>

<p>Stephen had given the wedding dress, the wedding breakfast and a
sum of money; Mary had given the bride her lace veil, her white
satin shoes and her white silk stockings; David had given a large
gilt clock, purchased for him in the Palais Royal; while Burton's
part was to drive the bride to the church, and the married pair to
the station.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock the whole street was agog, for Pauline and
Pierre were liked by their neighbours; and besides, as the baker
remarked to his wife, from so grand a house it would be a fine
business.</p>

<p>'They are after all generous, these English,' said he; 'and if
Mademoiselle Gordon is strange in appearance, one should not forget
that she served la France and must now wear a scar as well as
ribbon.' Then remembering his four sons slain in the war, he
sighed&mdash;sons are sons to a king or a baker.</p>

<p>David, growing excited, rushed up and downstairs with offers to
help which nobody wanted, least of all the flustered and anxious
bride at the moment of putting on tight satin slippers.</p>

<p>'Va donc! Tu ne peux pas m'aider, mon chou, veux to to taire,
alors!' implored Ad&egrave;le.</p>

<p>In the end Mary had had to find collar and lead and tie David up
to the desk in the study, where he brooded and sucked his white
satin bow, deciding that only the four-legged were grateful. But at
long last Ad&egrave;le was arrayed to be wed, and must show herself
shyly to Mary and Stephen. She looked very appealing with her good
honest face; with her round, bright eyes like those of a blackbird.
Stephen wished her well from the bottom of her heart, this girl who
had waited so long for her mate&mdash;had so patiently and so
faithfully waited.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>In the church were a number of friends and relations; together
with those who will journey for miles in order to attend a funeral
or wedding. Poor Jean looked his worst in a cheap dress suit, and
Stephen could smell the pomade on his hair; very greasy and warm it
smelt, although scented. But his hand was unsteady as he groped for
the ring, because he was feeling both proud and humble; because,
loving much, he must love even more and conceive of himself as
entirely unworthy. And something in that fumbling, unsteady hand,
in that sleekly greased hair and those ill-fitting garments,
touched Stephen, so that she longed to reassure, to tell him how
great was the gift he offered&mdash;security, peace, and love with
honour.</p>

<p>The young priest gravely repeated the prayers&mdash;ancient,
primitive prayers, yet softened through custom. In her mauve silk
dress Pauline wept as she knelt; but Pierre's handkerchief was
spread out on the stool to preserve the knees of his new grey
trousers. Next to Stephen were sitting Pauline's two brothers, one
in uniform, the other retired and in mufti, but both wearing medals
upon their breasts and thus worthily representing the army. The
baker was there with his wife and three daughters, and since the
latter were still unmarried, their eyes were more often fixed upon
Jean in his shoddy dress suit than upon their Missals. The
greengrocer accompanied the lady whose chickens it was Pauline's
habit to prod on their breastbones; while the cobbler who mended
Pierre's boots and shoes sat ogling the buxom and comely young
laundress.</p>

<p>The Mass drew to its close. The priest asked that a blessing
might be accomplished upon the couple; asked that these two might
live to behold, not only their own but their children's children,
even unto the third and fourth generation. Then he spoke of their
duty to God and to each other, and finally moistened their bowed
young heads with a generous sprinkling of holy water. And so in the
church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires&mdash;that bountiful Virgin who
bestows many graces&mdash;Jean and his Ad&egrave;le were made one
flesh in the eyes of their church, in the eyes of their God, and as
one might confront the world without flinching.</p>

<p>Ann in arm they passed out through the heavy swing doors and
into Stephen's waiting motor. Burton smiled above the white favour
in his coat; the crowd, craning their necks, were also smiling.
Arrived back at the house, Stephen, Mary and Burton must drink the
health of the bride and bridegroom. Then Pierre thanked his
employer for all she had done in giving his daughter so splendid a
wedding. But when that employer was no longer present, when Mary
had followed her into the study, the baker's wife lifted quizzical
eyebrows.</p>

<p>'Quel type! On dirait plut&ocirc;t un homme; ce n'est pas
celle-l&agrave; qui trouvera un mari!'</p>

<p>The guests laughed. 'Mais oui, elle est joliment bizarre'; and
they started to make little jokes about Stephen.</p>

<p>Pierre flushed as he leaped to Stephen's defence. 'She is good,
she is kind, and I greatly respect her and so does my
wife&mdash;while as for our daughter, Ad&egrave;le here has very
much cause to be grateful. Moreover she gained the Croix de Guerre
through serving our wounded men in the trenches.'</p>

<p>The baker nodded. 'You are quite right, my
friend&mdash;precisely what I myself said this morning.'</p>

<p>But Stephen's appearance was quickly forgotten in the
jollification of so much fine feasting&mdash;a feasting for which
her money had paid, for which her thoughtfulness had provided.
Jokes there were, but no longer directed at her&mdash;they were
harmless, well meant if slightly broad jokes made at the expense of
the bashful bridegroom. Then before even Pauline had realized the
time, there was Burton strolling into the kitchen, and Ad&egrave;le
must rush off to change her dress, while Jean must change also, but
in the pantry.</p>

<p>Burton glanced at the clock. Faut d&eacute;p&ecirc;cher vous,
'urry, if you're going to catch that chemin de fer,' he announced
as one having authority. 'It's a goodish way to the Guard de
Lions.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>That evening the old house seemed curiously thoughtful and
curiously sad after all the merry-making. David's second white bow
had come untied and was hanging in two limp ends from his collar.
Pauline had gone to church to light candles; Pierre, together with
Pauline's niece who would take Ad&egrave;le's place, was preparing
dinner. And the sadness of the house flowed out like a stream to
mingle itself with the sadness in Stephen. Ad&egrave;le and Jean,
the simplicity of it...they loved, they married, and after a while
they would care for each other all over again, renewing their youth
and their love in their children. So orderly, placid and safe it
seemed, this social scheme evolved from creation; this guarding of
two young and ardent lives for the sake of the lives that might
follow after. A fruitful and peaceful road it must be. The same
road had been taken by those founders of Morton who had raised up
children from father to son, from father to son until the advent of
Stephen; and their blood was her blood&mdash;what they had found
good in their day seemed equally good to their descendant. Surely
never was outlaw more law-abiding at heart than this, the last of
the Gordons.</p>

<p>So now a great sadness took hold upon her, because she perceived
both dignity and beauty in the coming together of Ad&egrave;le and
Jean, very simply and in accordance with custom. And this sadness
mingling with that of the house, widened into a flood that
compassed Mary and through her David, and they both went and sat
very close to Stephen on the study divan. As the twilight gradually
merged into dusk, these three must huddle even closer
together&mdash;David with his head upon Mary's lap, Mary with her
head against Stephen's shoulder.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch50" id="ch50"></a>Chapter Fifty</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Stephen ought to have gone to England that summer; at Morton
there had been a change of agent, and once again certain questions
had arisen which required her careful personal attention. But time
had not softened Anna's attitude to Mary, and time had not lessened
Stephen's exasperation&mdash;the more so as Mary no longer hid the
bitterness that she felt at this treatment. So Stephen tackled the
business by writing a number of long and wearisome letters,
unwilling to set foot again in the house where Mary Llewellyn would
not be welcome. But as always the thought of England wounded,
bringing with it the old familiar longing&mdash;homesick she would
feel as she sat at her desk writing those wearisome business
letters. For even as Jamie must crave for the grey, wind-swept
street and the wind-swept uplands of Beedles, so Stephen must crave
for the curving hills, for the long green hedges and pastures of
Morton. Jamie openly wept when such moods were upon her, but the
easement of tears was denied to Stephen.</p>

<p>In August Jamie and Barbara joined them in a villa that Stephen
had taken at Houlgate. Mary hoped that the bathing would do Barbara
good; she was not at all well. Jamie worried about her. And indeed
the girl had grown very frail, so frail that the housework now
tried her sorely; when alone she must sit down and hold her side
for the pain that was never mentioned to Jamie. Then too, all was
not well between them these days; poverty, even hunger at times,
the sense of being unwanted outcasts, the knowledge that the people
to whom they belonged&mdash;good and honest people&mdash;both
abhorred and despised them, such things as these had proved very
bad housemates for sensitive souls like Barbara and Jamie.</p>

<p>Large, helpless, untidy and intensely forlorn, Jamie would
struggle to finish her opera; but quite often these days she would
tear up her work, knowing that what she had written was unworthy.
When this happened she would sigh and peer round the studio,
vaguely conscious that something was not as it had been, vaguely
distressed by the dirt of the place to which she herself had helped
to contribute&mdash;Jamie, who had never before noticed dirt, would
feel aggrieved by its noxious presence. Getting up she would wipe
the keys of the piano with Barbara's one clean towel dipped in
water.</p>

<p>'Can't play,' she would grumble, 'these keys are all sticky.'
'Oh, Jamie&mdash;my towel&mdash;go and fetch the duster!'</p>

<p>The quarrel that ensued would start Barbara's cough, which in
turn would start Jamie's nerves vibrating. Then compassion,
together with unreasoning anger and a sudden uprush of
sex-frustration, would make her feel wellnigh beside
herself&mdash;since owing to Barbara's failing health, these two
could be lovers now in name only. And this forced abstinence told
on Jamie's work as well as her nerves, destroying her music, for
those who maintain that the North is cold, might just as well tell
us that hell is freezing. Yet she did her best, the poor uncouth
creature, to subjugate the love of the flesh to the pure and more
selfless love of the spirit&mdash;the flesh did not have it all its
own way with Jamie.</p>

<p>That summer she made a great effort to talk, to unburden herself
when alone with Stephen; and Stephen tried hard to console and
advise, while knowing that she could help very little. All her
offers of money to ease the strain were refused pointblank,
sometimes almost with rudeness&mdash;she felt very anxious indeed
about Jamie.</p>

<p>Mary in her turn was deeply concerned; her affection for Barbara
had never wavered, and she sat for long hours in the garden with
the girl who seemed too weak to bathe, and whom walking
exhausted.</p>

<p>'Let us help,' she pleaded, stroking Barbara's thin hand, 'after
all, we're much better off than you are. Aren't you two like
ourselves? Then why mayn't we help?'</p>

<p>Barbara slowly shook her head: 'I'm all right&mdash;please don't
talk about money to Jamie.'</p>

<p>But Mary could see that she was far from all tight; the warm
weather was proving of little avail, even care and good food and
sunshine and rest seemed unable to ease that incessant
coughing.</p>

<p>'You ought to see a specialist at once,' she told Barbara rather
sharply one morning.</p>

<p>But Barbara shook her head yet again: 'Don't, Mary&mdash;don't
please...you'll be frightening Jamie.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>After their return to Paris in the autumn, Jamie sometimes
joined the nocturnal parties; going rather grimly from bar to bar,
and drinking too much of the cr&ecirc;me-de-menthe that reminded
her of the bull's-eyes at Beedles. She had never cared for these
parties before, but now she was clumsily trying to escape, for a
few hours at least, from the pain of existence. Barbara usually
stayed at home or spent the evening with Stephen and Mary. But
Stephen and Mary would not always be there, for now they also went
out fairly often; and where was there to go to except the bars?
Nowhere else could two women dance together without causing comment
and ridicule, without being looked upon as freaks, argued Mary. So
rather than let the girl go without her, Stephen would lay aside
her work&mdash;she had recently started to write her fourth
novel.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is true, their friends came to them, a less sordid
and far less exhausting business; but even at their own house the
drink was too free: 'We can't be the only couple to refuse to give
people a brandy and soda,' said Mary. 'Val&eacute;rie's parties are
awfully dull; that's because she's allowed herself to grow
cranky!'</p>

<p>And thus, very gradually just at first, Mary's finer perceptions
began to coarsen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The months passed, and now more than a year had slipped by, yet
Stephen's novel remained unfinished; for Mary's face stood between
her and her work&mdash;surely the mouth and the eyes had
hardened?</p>

<p>Still unwilling to let Mary go without her, she dragged wearily
round to the bars and caf&eacute;s, observing with growing anxiety
that Mary now drank as did all the others&mdash;not too much
perhaps, but quite enough to give her a cheerful outlook on
existence.</p>

<p>The next morning she was often deeply depressed, in the grip of
a rather tearful reaction: 'It's too beastly&mdash;why do we do
it?' she would ask.</p>

<p>And Stephen would answer: 'God knows I don't want to, but I
won't let you go to such places without me. Can't we give it all
up? It's appallingly sordid!'</p>

<p>Then Mary would flare out with sudden anger, her mood changing
as she felt a slight tug on the bridle. Were they to have no
friends? she would ask. Were they to sit still and let the world
crush them? If they were reduced to the bars of Paris, whose fault
was that? Not hers and not Stephen's. Oh, no, it was the fault of
the Lady Annas and the Lady Masseys who had closed their doors, so
afraid were they of contamination.</p>

<p>Stephen would sit with her head on her hand, searching her
sorely troubled mind for some ray of light, some adequate
answer.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>That winter Barbara fell very ill. Jamie rushed round to the
house one morning, hatless, and with deeply, tormented eyes: 'Mary,
please come&mdash;Barbara can't get up, it's a pain in her side.
Oh, my God&mdash;we quarrelled...' Her voice was shrill and she
spoke very fast: 'Listen&mdash;last night&mdash;there was snow on
the ground, it was cold&mdash;I was angry...I can't remember...but
I know I was angry&mdash;I get like that. She went out&mdash;she
stayed out for quite two hours, and when she came back she was
shivering so. Oh, my God, but why did we quarrel, whatever? She
can't move; it's an awful pain in her side...</p>

<p>Stephen said quietly: 'We'll come almost at once, but first I'm
going to ring up my own doctor.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>5</b>
</p>

<p>Barbara was lying in the tiny room with the eye-shaped window
that would not open. The stove had gone out in the studio, and the
air was heavy with cold and dampness. On the piano lay some
remnants of manuscript music torn up on the previous evening by
Jamie.</p>

<p>Barbara opened her eyes: 'Is that you, my bairn?'</p>

<p>They had never heard Barbara call her that before&mdash;the
great, lumbering, big-boned, long-legged Jamie.</p>

<p>'Yes, it's me.'</p>

<p>'Come here close...' The voice drifted away.</p>

<p>'I'm here&mdash;oh, I'm here! I've got hold of your hand. Look
at me, open your eyes again&mdash;Barbara, listen, I'm
here&mdash;don't you feel me?'</p>

<p>Stephen tried to restrain the shrill, agonized voice: 'Don't
speak so loud, Jamie, perhaps she's sleeping,' but she knew very
well that this was not so; the girl was not sleeping now, but
unconscious.</p>

<p>Mary found some fuel and lighted the stove, then she started to
tidy the disordered studio. Flakes of flue lay here and there on
the floor; thick dust was filming the top of the piano. Barbara had
been waging a losing fight&mdash;strange that so mean a thing as
this dust should, in the end, have been able to conquer. Food there
was none, and putting on her coat Mary finally went forth in quest
of milk and other things likely to come in useful. At the foot of
the stairs she was met by the concierge; the woman looked glum, as
though deeply aggrieved by this sudden and very unreasonable
illness. Mary thrust some money into her hand, then hurried away
intent on her shopping.</p>

<p>When she returned the doctor was there; he was talking very
gravely to Stephen: 'It's double pneumonia, a pretty bad
case&mdash;the girl's heart's so weak. I'll send in a nurse. What
about the friend, will she be any good?'</p>

<p>'I'll help with the nursing if she isn't,' said Mary.</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'You do understand about the bills&mdash;the nurse
and all that?'</p>

<p>The doctor nodded.</p>

<p>They forced Jamie to eat: 'For Barbara's sake...Jamie, we're
with you, you're not alone, Jamie.'</p>

<p>She peered with her red-rimmed, short-sighted eyes, only half
understanding, but she did as they told her. Then she got up
without so much as a word, and went back to the room with the
eye-shaped window. Still in silence she squatted on the floor by
the bed, like a dumb, faithful dog who endured without speaking.
And they let her alone, let her have her poor way, for this was not
their Calvary but Jamie's.</p>

<p>The nurse arrived, a calm, practical woman: 'You'd better lie
down for a bit,' she told Jamie, and in silence Jamie lay down on
the floor.</p>

<p>'No, my dear&mdash;please go and lie down in the studio.'</p>

<p>She got up slowly to obey this new voice, lying down, with her
face to the wall, on the divan.</p>

<p>The nurse turned to Stephen: 'Is she a relation?'</p>

<p>Stephen hesitated, then she shook her head.</p>

<p>'That's a pity, in a serious case like this I'd like to be in
touch with some relation, someone who has a right to decide things.
You know what I mean&mdash;it's double pneumonia.'</p>

<p>Stephen said dully: 'No&mdash;she's not a relation.'</p>

<p>'Just a friend?' the nurse queried.</p>

<p>'Just a friend,' muttered Stephen.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>6</b>
</p>

<p>They went back that evening and stayed the night. Mary helped
with the nursing; Stephen looked after Jamie.</p>

<p>'Is she a little&mdash;I mean the friend&mdash;is she mental at
all, do you know?' The nurse whispered, 'I can't get her to
speak&mdash;she's anxious, of course; still, all the same, it
doesn't seem natural.'</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'No&mdash;it doesn't seem natural to you.' And she
suddenly flushed to the roots of her hair. Dear God, the outrage of
this for Jamie!</p>

<p>But Jamie seemed quite unconscious of outrage. From time to time
she stood in the doorway peering over at Barbara's wasted face,
listening to Barbara's painful breathing, and then she would turn
her bewildered eyes on the nurse, on Mary, but above all on
Stephen.</p>

<p>'Jamie&mdash;come back and sit down by the stove; Mary's there,
it's all right.'</p>

<p>Came a queer, halting voice that spoke with an effort:
'But...Stephen...we quarrelled.'</p>

<p>'Come and sit by the stove&mdash;Mary's with her, my dear.'</p>

<p>'Hush, please,' said the nurse, 'you're disturbing my
patient.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>7</b>
</p>

<p>Barbara's fight against death was so brief that it hardly seemed
in the nature of a struggle. Life had left her no strength to repel
this last foe&mdash;or perhaps it was that to her he seemed
friendly. Just before her death she kissed Jamie's hand and tried
to speak, but the words would not come&mdash;those words of
forgiveness and love for Jamie.</p>

<p>Then Jamie flung herself down by the bed, and she clung there,
still in that uncanny silence. Stephen never knew how they got her
away while the nurse performed the last merciful duties.</p>

<p>But when flowers had been placed in Barbara's hands, and Mary
had lighted a couple of candles, then Jamie went back and stared
quietly down at the small, waxen face that lay on the pillow; and
she turned to the nurse:</p>

<p>'Thank you so much,' she said, 'I think you've done all that
there is to do&mdash;and now I suppose you'll want to be
going?'</p>

<p>The nurse glanced at Stephen.</p>

<p>'It's all right, we'll stay. I think perhaps&mdash;if you don't
mind, nurse...</p>

<p>'Very well, it must be as you wish, Miss Gordon.'</p>

<p>When she had gone Jamie veered round abruptly and walked back
into the empty studio. Then all in a moment the floodgates gave way
and she wept and she wept like a creature demented. Bewailing the
life of hardship and exile that had sapped Barbara's strength and
weakened her spirit; bewailing the cruel dispensation of fate that
had forced them to leave their home in the Highlands; bewailing the
terrible thing that is death to those who, still loving, must look
upon it. Yet all the exquisite pain of this parting seemed as
nothing to an anguish that was far more subtle: 'I can't mourn her
without bringing shame on her name&mdash;I can't go back home now
and mourn her,' wailed Jamie; 'oh, and I want to go back to
Beedles, I want to be home among our own people&mdash;I want them
to know how much I loved her. Oh God, oh God! I can't even mourn
her, and I want to grieve for her home there in Beedles.'</p>

<p>What could they speak but inadequate words: 'Jamie, don't,
don't! You loved each other&mdash;isn't that something? Remember
that, Jamie.' They could only speak the inadequate words that are
given to people on such occasions.</p>

<p>But after a while the storm seemed to pass, Jamie seemed to grow
suddenly calm and collected: 'You two,' she said gravely, 'I want
to thank you for all you've been to Barbara and me.'</p>

<p>Mary started crying.</p>

<p>'Don't cry,' said Jamie.</p>

<p>The evening came. Stephen lighted the lamp, then she made up the
stove while Mary laid the supper. Jamie ate a little, and she
actually smiled when Stephen poured her out a weak whisky.</p>

<p>'Drink it, Jamie&mdash;it may help you to get some sleep.'</p>

<p>Jamie shook her head: 'I shall sleep without it&mdash;but I want
to be left alone tonight, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Mary protested but Jamie was firm: 'I want to be left alone with
her, please&mdash;you do understand that, Stephen, don't you?'</p>

<p>Stephen hesitated, then she saw Jamie's face; it was full of a
new and calm resolution: 'It's my right,' she was saying, 'I've a
right to be alone with the woman I love before they&mdash;take
her.'</p>

<p>Jamie held the lamp to light them downstairs&mdash;her hand,
Stephen thought, seemed amazingly steady.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>8</b>
</p>

<p>The next morning when they went to the studio quite early, they
heard voices coming from the topmost landing. The concierge was
standing outside Jamie's door, and with her was a young man, one of
the tenants. The concierge had tried the door; it was locked and no
one made any response to her knocking. She had brought Jamie up a
cup of hot coffee&mdash;Stephen saw it, the coffee had slopped into
the saucer. Either pity or the memory of Mary's large tips, had
apparently touched the heart of this woman.</p>

<p>Stephen hammered loudly: 'Jamie!' she called, and then again and
again: 'Jamie! Jamie!'</p>

<p>The young man set his shoulder to a panel, and all the while he
pushed he was talking. He lived just underneath, but last night he
was out, not returning until nearly six this morning. He had heard
that one of the girls had died&mdash;the little one&mdash;she had
always looked fragile.</p>

<p>Stephen added her strength to his; the woodwork was damp and
rotten with age, the lock suddenly gave and the door swung
inwards.</p>

<p>Then Stephen saw: 'Don't come here&mdash;go back, Mary!' But
Mary followed them into the studio.</p>

<p>So neat, so amazingly neat it was for Jamie, she who had always
been so untidy, she who had always littered up the place with her
large, awkward person and shabby possessions, she who had always
been Barbara's despair...Just a drop or two of blood on the floor,
just a neat little hole low down in her left side. She must have
fired upwards with great foresight and skill&mdash;and they had not
even known that she owned a revolver!</p>

<p>And so Jamie who dared not go home to Beedles for fear of
shaming the woman she loved, Jamie who dared not openly mourn lest
Barbara's name be defiled through her mourning, Jamie had dared to
go home to God&mdash;to trust herself to His more perfect mercy,
even as Barbara had gone home before her.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch51" id="ch51"></a>Chapter Fifty-one</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>The tragic deaths of Barbara and Jamie cast a gloom over
everyone who had known them, but especially over Mary and Stephen.
Again and again Stephen blamed herself for having left Jamie on
that fatal evening; if she had only insisted upon staying, the
tragedy might never have happened, she might somehow have been able
to impart to the girl the courage and strength to go on living. But
great as the shock undoubtedly was to Stephen, to Mary it was even
greater, for together with her very natural grief, was a new and
quite unexpected emotion, the emotion of fear. She was suddenly
afraid, and now this fear looked out of her eyes and crept into her
voice when she spoke of Jamie.</p>

<p>'To end in that way, to have killed herself; Stephen, it's so
awful that such things can happen&mdash;they were like you and me.'
And then she would go over every sorrowful detail of Barbara's last
illness, every detail of their finding of Jamie's body.</p>

<p>'Did it hurt, do you think, when she shot herself? When you shot
that wounded horse at the front, he twitched such a lot, I shall
never forget it&mdash;and Jamie was all alone that night, there was
no one there to help in her pain. It's all so ghastly; supposing it
hurt her!'</p>

<p>Useless for Stephen to quote the doctor who had said that death
had been instantaneous; Mary was obsessed by the horror of the
thing, and not only its physical horror either, but by the mental
and spiritual suffering that must have strengthened the will to
destruction.</p>

<p>Such despair,' she would say, 'such utter despair...and that was
the end of all their loving. I can't bear it!' And then she would
hide her face against Stephen's strong and protective shoulder.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, there was now little room for doubt, the whole business
was preying badly on Mary.</p>

<p>Sometimes strange, amorous moods would seize her, in which she
must kiss Stephen rather wildly: 'Don't let go of me,
darling&mdash;never let go. I'm afraid; I think it's because of
what's happened.'</p>

<p>Her kisses would awaken a swift response, and so in these days
that were shadowed by death, they dung very desperately to life
with the passion they had felt when first they were lovers, as
though only by constantly feeding the flame could they hope to ward
off some unseen disaster.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>At this time of shock, anxiety and strain, Stephen turned to
Val&eacute;rie Seymour as many another had done before her. This
woman's great calm in the midst of storm was not only soothing but
helpful to Stephen, so that now she often went to the flat on the
Quai Voltaire; often went there alone, since Mary would seldom
accompany her&mdash;for some reason she resented Val&eacute;rie
Seymour. But in spite of this resentment Stephen must go, for now
an insistent urge was upon her, the urge to unburden her weary mind
of the many problems surrounding inversion. Like most inverts she
found a passing relief in discussing the intolerable situation; in
dissecting it ruthlessly bit by bit, even though she arrived at no
solution; but since Jamie's death it did not seem wise to dwell too
much on this subject with Mary. On the other hand, Val&eacute;rie
was now quite free, having suddenly tired of Jeanne Maurel, and
moreover she was always ready to listen. Thus it was that between
them a real friendship sprang up&mdash;a friendship founded on
mutual respect, if not always on mututal understanding.</p>

<p>Stephen would again and again go over those last heart-rending
days with Barbara and Jamie, railing against the outrageous
injustice that had led to their tragic and miserable ending. She
would clench her hands in a kind of fury. How long was this
persecution to continue? How long would God sit still and endure
this insult offered to His creation? How long tolerate the
preposterous statement that inversion was not a part of nature? For
since it existed what else could it be? All things that existed
were a part of nature!</p>

<p>But with equal bitterness she would speak of the wasted lives of
such creatures as Wanda, who, beaten down into the depths of the
world, gave the world the very excuse it was seeking for pointing
at them an accusing finger. Pretty bad examples they were, many of
them, and yet&mdash;but for an unforeseen accident of birth, Wanda
might even now have been a great painter.</p>

<p>And then she would discuss very different people whom she had
been led to believe existed; hard-working, honourable men and
women, but a few of them possessed of fine brains, yet lacking the
courage to admit their inversion. Honourable, it seemed, in all
things save this that the world had forced on them&mdash;this
dishonourable lie whereby alone they could hope to find peace,
could hope to stake out a claim on existence. And always these
people must carry that lie like a poisonous asp pressed against
their bosoms; must unworthily hide and deny their love, which might
well be the finest thing about them.</p>

<p>And what of the women who had worked in the war&mdash;those
quiet, gaunt women she had seen about London? England had called
them and they had come; for once, unabashed, they had faced the
daylight. And now because they were not prepared to slink back and
hide in their holes and corners, the very public whom they had
served was the first to turn round and spit upon them; to cry:
'Away with this canker in our midst, this nest of unrighteousness
and corruption!' That was the gratitude they had received for the
work they had done out of love for England!</p>

<p>And what of that curious craving for religion which so often
went hand in hand with inversion? Many such people were deeply
religious, and this surely was one of their bitterest problems.
They believed, and believing they craved a blessing on what to some
of them seemed very sacred&mdash;a faithful and deeply devoted
union. But the Church's blessing was not for them. Faithful they
might be, leading orderly lives, harming no one, and yet the Church
turned away; her blessings were strictly reserved for the
normal.</p>

<p>Then Stephen would come to the thing of all others that to her
was the most agonizing question. Youth, what of youth? Where could
it turn for its natural and harmless recreations? There was Dickie
West and many more like her, vigorous, courageous and kind-hearted
youngsters; yet shut away from so many of the pleasures that
belonged by right to every young creature&mdash;and more pitiful
still was the lot of a girl who, herself being normal, gave her
love to an invert. The young had a right to their innocent
pleasures, a right to social companionship; had a right, indeed, to
resent isolation. But here, as in all the great cities of the
world, they were isolated until they went under; until, in their
ignorance and resentment, they turned to the only communal life
that a world bent upon their destruction had left them; turned to
the worst elements of their kind, to those who haunted the bars of
Paris. Their lovers were helpless, for what could they do?
Empty-handed they were, having nothing to offer. And even the
tolerant normal were helpless&mdash;those who went to
Val&eacute;rie's parties, for instance. If they had sons and
daughters, they left them at home; and considering all things, who
could blame them While as for themselves, they were far too
old&mdash;only tolerant, no doubt because they were ageing. They
could not provide the frivolities for which youth had a perfectly
natural craving.</p>

<p>In spite of herself, Stephen's voice would tremble, and
Val&eacute;rie would know that she was thinking of Mary.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie would genuinely want to be helpful, but would
find very little to say that was consoling. It was hard on the
young, she had thought so herself, but some came through all right,
though a few might go under. Nature was trying to do her bit;
inverts were being born in increasing numbers, and after a while
their numbers would tell, even with the fools who still ignored
Nature. They must just bide their time&mdash;recognition was
coming. But meanwhile they should all cultivate more pride, should
learn to be proud of their isolation. She found little excuse for
poor fools like Pat, and even less for drunkards like Wanda.</p>

<p>As for those who were ashamed to declare themselves, lying low
for the sake of a peaceful existence, she utterly despised such of
them as had brains; they were traitors to themselves and their
fellows, she insisted. For the sooner the world came to realize
that fine brains very frequently went with inversion, the sooner it
would have to withdraw its ban, and the sooner would cease this
persecution. Persecution was always a hideous thing, breeding
hideous thoughts&mdash;and such thoughts were dangerous.</p>

<p>As for the women who had worked in the war, they had set an
example to the next generation, and that in itself should be a
reward. She had heard that in England many such women had taken to
breeding dogs in the country. Well, why not? Dogs were very nice
people to breed. 'Plus je commis les hommes, plus j'aime les
chiens.' There were worse things than breeding dogs in the
country.</p>

<p>It was quite true that inverts were often religious, but
churchgoing in them was a form of weakness; they must be a religion
unto themselves if they felt that they really needed religion. As
for blessings, they profited the churches no doubt, apart from
which they were just superstition. But then of course she herself
was a pagan, acknowledging only the god of beauty; and since the
whole world was so ugly these days, she was only too thankful to
let it ignore her. Perhaps that was lazy&mdash;she was rather lazy.
She had never achieved all she might have with her writing. But
humanity was divided into two separate classes, those who did
things and those who looked on at their doings. Stephen was one of
the kind that did things&mdash;under different conditions of
environment and birth she might very well have become a
reformer.</p>

<p>They would argue for hours, these two curious friends whose
points of view were so widely divergent, and although they seldom
if ever agreed, they managed to remain both courteous and
friendly.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie seemed wellnigh inhuman at times, completely
detached from all personal interest. But one day she remarked to
Stephen abruptly: 'I really know very little about you, but this I
do know&mdash;you're a bird of passage, you don't belong to the
life here in Paris.' Then as Stephen was silent, she went on more
gravely: 'You're rather a terrible combination; you've the nerves
of the abnormal with all that they stand for&mdash;you're
appallingly over-sensitive, Stephen&mdash;well, and then we get le
revers de la m&eacute;daille; you've all the respectable county
instincts of the man who cultivates children and acres&mdash;any
gaps in your fences would always disturb you; one side of your mind
is so aggressively tidy. I can't see your future, but I feel you'll
succeed; though I must say, of all the improbable people...But
supposing you could bring the two sides of your nature into some
sort of friendly amalgamation and compel them to serve you and
through you your work&mdash;well then I really don't see what's to
stop you. The question is can you ever bring them together?' She
smiled. 'If you climb to the highest peak, Val&eacute;rie Seymour
won't be there to see you. It's a charming friendship that we two
have found, but it's passing, like so many charming things;
however, my dear, let's enjoy it while it lasts, and...remember me
when you come into your kingdom.'</p>

<p>Stephen said: 'When we first met I almost disliked you. I
thought your interest was purely scientific or purely morbid. I
said so to Puddle&mdash;you remember Puddle, I think you once met
her. I want to apologize to you now; to tell you how grateful I am
for your kindness. You're so patient when I come here and talk for
hours, and it's such a relief: you'll never know the relief it is
to have someone to talk to.' She hesitated. You see it's not fair
to make Mary listen to all my worries&mdash;she's still pretty
young, and the road's damned hard...then there's been that horrible
business of Jamie.'</p>

<p>'Come as often as you feel like it,' Val&eacute;rie told her;
'and if ever you should want my help or advice, here I am. But do
try to remember this: even the world's not so black as it's
painted.'</p>

<p>One morning a very young cherry-tree that Mary herself had
planted in the garden was doing the must delightful things&mdash;it
was pushing out leaves and tight pink buds along the whole length
of its childish branches. Stephen made a note of it in her diary:
'Today Mary's cherry-tree started to blossom.' This is why she
never forgot the date on which she received Martin Hallam's
letter.</p>

<p>The letter had been redirected from Morton; she recognized
Puddle's scholastic handwriting. And the other writing&mdash;large,
rather untidy but with strong black down-strokes and firmly crossed
t's&mdash;she stared at it thoughtfully, puckering her brows,
Surely that writing, too, was familiar? Then she noticed a Paris
postmark in the corner&mdash;that was strange. She tore open the
envelope.</p>

<p>Martin wrote very simply: Stephen, my dear. After all these
years I am sending you a letter, just in case you have not
completely forgotten the existence of a man called Martin
Hallam.</p>

<p>'I've been in Paris for the past two months. I had to come
across to have my eye seen to; I stopped a bullet with my head here
in France&mdash;it affected the optic nerve rather badly. But the
point is: if I Ely over to England as I'm thinking of doing, may I
come and see you? I'm a very poor hand at expressing
myself&mdash;can't do it at all when I put pen to paper&mdash;in
addition to which I'm feeling nervous because you've become such a
wonderful writer. But I do want to try and make you understand how
desperately I've regretted our friendship&mdash;that perfect early
friendship of ours seems to me now a thing well worth regretting.
Believe me or not I've thought of it for years; and the fault was
all mine for not understanding. I was just an ignorant cub in those
days. Well, anyhow, please will you see me, Stephen? I'm a lonely
sort of fellow, so if you're kind-hearted you'll invite me to motor
down to Morton, supposing you're there; and then if you like me,
we'll take up our friendship just where it left off. We'll pretend
that we're very young again, walking over the hills and jawing
about life. Lord, what splendid companions we were in those early
days&mdash;like a couple of brothers!</p>

<p>'Do you think it's queer that I'm writing all this? It does seem
queer, yet I'd have written it before if I'd ever come over to stay
in England; but except when I rushed across to join up, I've pretty
well stuck to British Columbia. I don't even know exactly where you
are, for I've not met a soul who knows you for ages. I heard of
your father's death of course, and was terribly sorry&mdash;beyond
that I've heard nothing; still, I fancy I'm quite safe in sending
this to Morton.</p>

<p>'I'm staying with my aunt, the Comtesse de Mirac; she's English,
twice married and once more a widow. She's been a perfect angel to
me. I've been staying with her ever since I came to Paris. Well, my
dear, if you've forgiven my mistake&mdash;and please say you have,
we were both very young&mdash;then write to me at Aunt Sarah's
address, and if you write don't forget to put "Passy." The posts
are so erratic in France, and I'd hate to think that they'd lost
your letter. Your very sincere friend, MARTIN HALLAM.'</p>

<p>Stephen glanced through the window. Mary was in the garden still
admiring her brave little cherry-tree; in a minute or two she would
feed the pigeons&mdash;yes, she was starting to cross the lawn to
the shed in which she kept pigeon-mixture&mdash;but presently she
would be coming in. Stephen sat down and began to think
quickly.</p>

<p>Martin Hallam&mdash;he must be about thirty-nine. He had fought
in the war and been badly wounded&mdash;she had thought of him
during that terrible advance, the smitten trees had been a
reminder...He must often have been very near her then; he was very
near now, just out at Passy, and he wanted to see her; he offered
his friendship.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes the better to consider, but now her mind
must conjure up pictures. A very young man at the Antrims'
dance&mdash;oh, but very young&mdash;with a bony face that glowed
when he talked of the beauty of trees, of their goodness...a tall,
loose-limbed young man who slouched when he walked, as though from
much riding. The hills...winter hills rust-coloured by
bracken...Martin touching the ancient thorns with kind fingers.
'Look, Stephen&mdash;the courage of these old fellows!' How clearly
she remembered his actual words after all these years, and her own
she remembered; 'You're the only real friend I've ever had except
Father&mdash;our friendship's so wonderful somehow...' And his
answer: 'I know, a wonderful friendship.' A great sense of
companionship, of comfort&mdash;it had been so good to have him
beside her; she had liked his quiet and careful voice, and his
thoughtful blue eyes that moved rather slowly. He had filled a real
need that had always been hers and still was, a need for the
friendship of men&mdash;how very completely Martin had filled it,
until...But she resolutely closed her mind, refusing to visualize
that last picture. He knew now that it had been a ghastly
mistake&mdash;he understood&mdash;he practically said so. Could
they take up their friendship where they had left it? If only they
could...</p>

<p>She got up abruptly and went to the telephone on her desk.
Glancing at his letter, she rang up a number.</p>

<p>'Hallo&mdash;yes?'</p>

<p>She recognized his voice at once.</p>

<p>'Is that you, Martin? It's Stephen speaking.'</p>

<p>Stephen...oh, I'm so glad! But where on earth are you?' 'At my
house in Paris-35, Rue Jacob.'</p>

<p>'But I don't understand, I thought...</p>

<p>'Yes, I know, but I've lived here for ages&mdash;since before
the war. I've just got your letter, sent back from England. Funny
isn't it? Why not come to dinner to-night if you're
free&mdash;eight o'clock.'</p>

<p>'I say! May I really?'</p>

<p>'Of course...come and dine with my friend and me.' 'What
number?'</p>

<p>'Thirty-five&mdash;3 5, Rue Jacob.'</p>

<p>'I'll be there on the actual stroke of eight!'</p>

<p>'That's right&mdash;good-bye, Martin.'</p>

<p>'Good-bye, and thanks, Stephen.'</p>

<p>She hung up the receiver and opened the window.</p>

<p>Mary saw her and called: 'Stephen, please speak to David. He's
just bitten off and swallowed a crocus! Oh, and do come here: the
scyllas are out, I never saw anything like their blueness. I think
I shall go and fetch my birds, it's quite warm in the sun over
there by the wall. David, stop it; <i>will</i> you get off that
border!'</p>

<p>David wagged a bald but ingratiating tail. Then he thrust out
his nose and sniffed at the pigeons. Oh, hang it all, why should
the coming of spring be just one colossal smell of temptation! And
why was there nothing really exciting that a spaniel might do and
yet remain lawful?</p>

<p>Sighing, he turned amber eyes of entreaty first on Stephen, and
then on his goddess, Mary.</p>

<p>She forgave him the crocus and patted his head. 'Darling, you
get more than a pound of raw meat for your dinner; you mustn't be
so untruthful. Of course you're not hungry&mdash;it was just pure
mischief.'</p>

<p>He barked trying desperately hard to explain. 'It's the spring;
it's got into my blood, oh, Goddess! Oh, Gentle Purveyor of all
Good Things, let me dig till I've rooted up every damned crocus;
just this once let me sin for the joy of life, for the ancient and
exquisite joy of sinning!'</p>

<p>But Mary shook her head. 'You must be a nice dog; and nice dogs
never look at white fantail pigeons, or walk on the borders, or
bite off the flowers&mdash;do they, Stephen?'</p>

<p>Stephen smiled. 'I'm afraid they don't, David.' Then she said:
'Mary, listen&mdash;about this evening. I've just heard from a very
old friend of mine, a man called Hallam that I knew in England.
He's in Paris; it's too queer. He wrote to Morton and his letter
has been sent back by Puddle. I've rung him up, and he's coming to
dinner. Better tell Pauline at once, will you, darling?'</p>

<p>But Mary must naturally ask a few questions. What was he like?
Where had Stephen known him?&mdash;she had never mentioned a man
called Hallam&mdash;where had she known him, in London or at
Morton?</p>

<p>And finally: 'How old were you when you knew him?'</p>

<p>'Let me think&mdash;I must have been just eighteen.'</p>

<p>'How old was he?'</p>

<p>'Twenty-two&mdash;very young&mdash;I only knew him for quite a
short time; after that he went back to British Columbia. But I
liked him so much&mdash;we were very great friends&mdash;so I'm
hoping that you're going to like him too, darling.'</p>

<p>'Stephen, you are strange. Why haven't you told me that you once
had a very great friend&mdash;a man? I've always thought that you
didn't like men.'</p>

<p>'On the contrary, I like them very much. But I haven't seen
Martin for years and years. I've hardly ever thought about him
until I got his letter this morning. Now, sweetheart, we don't want
the poor man to starve&mdash;you really must go off and try to find
Pauline.'</p>

<p>When she had gone Stephen rubbed her chin with thoughtful and
rather uncertain fingers.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>He came. Amazing how little he had changed. He was just the same
clean-shaven, bony-faced Martin, with the slow blue eyes and the
charming expression, and the loose-limbed figure that slouched from
much riding; only now there were a few faint lines round his eyes,
and the hair had gone snow-white on his temples. Just beside the
right temple was a deep little scar&mdash;it must have been a near
thing, that bullet.</p>

<p>He said: 'My dear, it is good to see you.' And he held Stephen's
hand in his own thin brown ones.</p>

<p>She felt the warm, friendly grip of his fingers, and the years
dropped away. 'I'm so glad you wrote, Martin.'</p>

<p>'So am I. I can't tell you how glad I am. And all the time we
were both in Paris, and we never knew. Well, now that I've found
you, we'll cling like grim death, if you don't mind, Stephen.'</p>

<p>As Mary came into the room they were laughing.</p>

<p>She looked less tired, Stephen thought with satisfaction, or
perhaps it was that her dress became her&mdash;she was always at
her best in the evening.</p>

<p>Stephen said quite simply: 'This is Martin, Mary.'</p>

<p>They shook hands, and as they did so they smiled. Then they
stared at each other for a moment, almost gravely.</p>

<p>He proved to be wonderfully easy to talk to. He did not seem
surprised that Mary Llewellyn was installed as the mistress of
Stephen's home; he just accepted the thing as he found it. Yet he
let it be tacitly understood that he had grasped the exact
situation.</p>

<p>After dinner Stephen inquired about his sight: was it badly
injured? His eyes looked so normal. Then he told them the history
of the trouble at full length, going into details with the
confidence displayed by most children and lonely people.</p>

<p>He had got his knock-out in 1918. The bullet had grazed the
optic nerve. At first he had gone to a base hospital, but as soon
as he could he had come to Paris to be treated by a very celebrated
man. He had been in danger of losing the sight of the right eye; it
had scared him to death, he told them. But after three months he
had had to go home; things had gone wrong on some of his farms
owing to the mismanagement of a bailiff. The oculist had warned him
that the trouble might recur, that he ought to have remained under
observation. Well, it had recurred about four months ago. He had
got the wind up and rushed back to Paris. For three weeks he had
lain in a darkened room, not daring to think of the possible
verdict. Eyes were so tiresomely sympathetic: if the one went the
other might easily follow. But, thank God, it had proved to be less
serious than the oculist had feared. His sight was saved, but he
had to go slow, and was still under treatment. The eye would have
to be watched for some time; so here he was with Aunt Sarah at
Passy.</p>

<p>'You must see my Aunt Sarah, you two; she's a darling. She's my
father's sister. I know you'll like her. She's become very French
since her second marriage, a little too Faubourg St. Germain
perhaps, but so kind&mdash;I want you to meet her at once. She's
quite a well-known hostess at Passy.'</p>

<p>They talked on until well after twelve o'clock&mdash;very happy
they were together that evening, and he left with a promise to ring
them up on the following morning about lunch with Aunt Sarah.
'Well,' said Stephen, 'what do you think of my friend?'</p>

<p>'I think he's most awfully nice,' said Mary.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah lived in the palatial house that a grateful second
husband had left her. For years she had borne with his
peccadilloes, keeping her temper and making no scandal. The result
was that everything he possessed apart from what had gone to her
stepson&mdash;and the Comte de Mirac had been very
wealthy&mdash;had found its way to the patient Aunt Sarah. She was
one of those survivals who look upon men as a race of especially
privileged beings. Her judgment of women was more severe,
influenced no doubt by the ancien r&eacute;gime, for now she was
even more French than the French whose language she spoke like a
born Parisian.</p>

<p>She was sixty-five, tall, had an aquiline nose, and her
iron-grey hair was dressed to perfection; for the rest she had
Martin's slow blue eyes and thin face, though she lacked his
charming expression. She bred Japanese spaniels, was kind to young
girls who conformed in all things to the will of their parents, was
particularly gracious to good-looking men, and adored her only
surviving nephew. In her opinion he could do no wrong, though she
wished he would settle down in Paris. As Stephen and Mary were her
nephew's friends, she was pre-disposed to consider them charming,
the more so as the former's antecedents left little or nothing to
be desired, and her parents had shown great kindness to Martin. He
had told his aunt just what he wished her to know and not one word
more about the old days at Morton. She was therefore quite
unprepared for Stephen.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah was a very courteous old dame, and those who broke
bread at her table were sacred, at all events while they remained
her guests. But Stephen was miserably telepathic, and before the
d&eacute;jeuner was half-way through she was conscious of the deep
antagonism that she had aroused in Martin's Aunt Sarah. Not by so
much as a word or a look did the Comtesse de Mirac betray her
feelings; she was gravely polite, she discussed literature as being
a supposedly congenial subject, she praised Stephen's books, and
asked no questions as to why she was living apart from her mother.
Martin could have sworn that these two would be friends&mdash;but
good manners could not any more deceive Stephen.</p>

<p>And true it was that the Comtesse de Mirac saw in Stephen the
type that she most mistrusted, saw only an unsexed creature of
pose, whose cropped head and whose dress were pure affectation; a
creature who aping the prerogatives of men, had lost all the charm
and grace of a woman. An intelligent person in nearly all else, the
Comtesse would never have admitted of inversion as a fact in
nature. She had heard things whispered, it is true, but had
scarcely grasped their full meaning. She was innocent and stubborn;
and this being so, it was not Stephen's morals that she suspected,
but her obvious desire to ape what she was not&mdash;in the
Comtesse's set, as at county dinners, there was firm insistence
upon sex-distinction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, she took a great fancy to Mary, whom she
quickly discovered to be an orphan. In a very short time she had
learnt quite a lot about Mary's life before the war and about her
meeting with Stephen in the Unit; had learnt also that she was
quite penniless&mdash;since Mary was eager that everyone should
know that she owed her prosperity entirely to Stephen.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah secretly pitied the girl who must surely be living a
dull existence, bound, no doubt, by a false sense of gratitude to
this freakish and masterful-looking woman&mdash;pretty girls should
find husbands and homes of their own, and this one she considered
excessively pretty. Thus it was that while Mary in all loyalty and
love was doing her best to extol Stephen's virtues, to convey an
impression of her own happiness, of the privilege it was to serve
so great a writer by caring for her house and her personal needs,
she was only succeeding in getting herself pitied. But as good luck
would have it, she was blissfully unconscious of the sympathy that
her words were arousing; indeed, she was finding it very pleasant
at Aunt Sarah's hospitable house in Passy.</p>

<p>As for Martin, he had never been very subtle, and just now he
must rejoice in a long-lost friendship&mdash;to him it appeared a
delightful luncheon. Even after the guests had said good-bye, he
remained in the very highest of spirits, for the Comtesse was
capable of unexpected tact, and while praising Mary's prettiness
and charm, she was careful in no way to disparage Stephen.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, undoubtedly a brilliant writer, I agree with you,
Martin.' And so she did. But books were one thing and their scribes
another; she saw no reason to change her opinion with regard to
this author's unpleasant affectation, while she saw every reason to
be tactful with her nephew.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>On the drive home Mary held Stephen's hand. 'I enjoyed myself
awfully, didn't you? Only&mdash;' and she frowned; 'only will it
last? I mean, we mustn't forget Lady Massey. But he's so nice, and
I liked the old aunt...'</p>

<p>Stephen said firmly: Of course it will last.' Then she lied. 'I
enjoyed it very much too.'</p>

<p>And even as she lied she came to a resolve which seemed so
strange that she flinched a little, for never before since they had
been lovers, had she thought of this girl as apart from herself.
Yet now she resolved that Mary should go to Passy again&mdash;but
should go without her. Sitting back in the car she half closed her
eyes; just at that moment she did not want to speak lest her voice
should betray that flinching to Mary.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch53" id="ch53"></a>Chapter Fifty-three</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>With Martin's return Stephen realized how very deeply she had
missed him; how much she still needed the thing he now offered, how
long indeed she had starved for just this&mdash;the friendship of a
normal and sympathetic man whose mentality being very much her own,
was not only welcome but reassuring. Yes, strange though it was,
with this normal man she was far more at ease than with Jonathan
Brockett, far more at one with all his ideas, and at times far less
conscious of her own inversion; though it seemed that Martin had
not only read, but had thought a great deal about the subject. He
spoke very little of his studies, however, just accepting her now
for the thing that she was, without question, and accepting most of
her friends with a courtesy as innocent of patronage as of any
suspicion of morbid interest. And thus it was that in these first
days they appeared to have achieved a complete reunion. Only
sometimes, when Mary would talk to him freely as she did very often
of such people as Wanda, of the night life of the caf&eacute;s and
bars of Paris&mdash;most of which it transpired he himself had been
to&mdash;of the tragedy of Barbara and Jamie that was never very
far from her thoughts, even although a most perfect spring was
hurrying forwards towards the summer&mdash;when Mary would talk to
him of these things, Martin would look rather gravely at
Stephen.</p>

<p>But now they seldom went to the bars, for Martin provided
recreations that were really much more to Mary's liking. Martin the
kindly, the thoroughly normal, seemed never at a loss as to what
they should do or where they should go when in search of pleasure.
By now he knew Paris extremely well, and the Paris he showed them
during that spring came as a complete revelation to Mary. He would
often take them to dine in the Bois. At the neighbouring tables
would be men and women; neat, well tailored men; pretty, smartly
dressed women who laughed and talked very conscious of sex and its
vast importance&mdash;in a word, normal women. Or perhaps they
would go to Claridge's for tea or to Ciro's for dinner, and then on
to supper at an equally fashionable restaurant, of which Mary
discovered there were many in Paris. And although people still
stared a little at Stephen, Mary fancied that they did so much
less, because of the presence of Martin.</p>

<p>At such places of course, it was out of the question for a
couple of women to dance together, and yet everyone danced, so that
in the end Mary must get up and dance with Martin.</p>

<p>He had said: 'You don't mind, do you, Stephen?'</p>

<p>She had shaken her head: 'No, of course I don't mind.' And
indeed she had been very glad to know that Mary had a good partner
to dance with.</p>

<p>But now when she sat alone at their table, lighting one
cigarette after another, uncomfortably conscious of the interest
she aroused by reason of her clothes and her isolation&mdash;when
she glimpsed the girl in Martin's arms, and heard her laugh for a
moment in passing, Stephen would know a queer tightening of her
heart, as though a mailed fist had closed down upon it. What was
it? Good God, surely not resentment? Horrified she would feel at
this possible betrayal of friendship, of her fine, honest
friendship for Martin. And when they came back, Mary smiling and
flushed, Stephen would force herself to smile also.</p>

<p>She would say: 'I've been thinking how well you two
dance&mdash;'</p>

<p>And when Mary once asked rather timidly: Are you sure you're not
bored, sitting there by yourself?'</p>

<p>Stephen answered: 'Don't be so silly, darling; of course I'm not
bored&mdash;go on dancing with Martin.'</p>

<p>But that night she took Mary in her arms&mdash;the relentless,
compelling arms of a lover.</p>

<p>On warm days they would all drive into the country, as Mary and
she had so frequently done during their first spring months in
Paris. Very often now it would be Barbizon, for Martin loved to
walk in the forest. And there he must start to talk about trees,
his face glowing with its curious inner light, while Mary listened
half fascinated.</p>

<p>One evening she said: 'But these trees are so small&mdash;you
make me long to see real forests, Martin.'</p>

<p>David loved these excursions&mdash;he also loved Martin, not
being exactly disloyal to Stephen, but discerning in the man a more
perfect thing, a more entirely fulfilling companion. And this
little betrayal, though slight in it self; had the power to wound
out of all proportion, so that Stephen would feel very much as she
had done when ignored years ago by the swan called Peter. She had
thought then: 'Perhaps he thinks I'm a freak,' and now she must
sometimes think the same thing as she watched Martin hurling huge
sticks for David&mdash;it was strange what a number of ridiculous
trifles had lately acquired the power to hurt her. And yet she
clung desperately to Martin's friendship, feeling herself to be all
unworthy if she harboured so much as a moment's doubt; indeed they
both loyally clung to their friendship.</p>

<p>He would beg her to accept his aunt's invitations, to accompany
Mary when she went to Passy:</p>

<p>'Don't you like the old thing? Mary likes her all
right&mdash;why won't you come? It's so mean of you, Stephen. It's
not half as much fun when you're not there.' He would honestly
think that he was speaking the truth, that the party or luncheon or
whatever it might be, was not half as much fun for him without
Stephen.</p>

<p>But Stephen always made her work an excuse: 'My dear, I'm trying
to finish a novel. I seem to have been at it for years and years;
it's growing hoary like Rip Van Winkle.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>There were times when their friendship seemed well-nigh perfect,
the perfect thing that they would have it to be, and on such a day
of complete understanding, Stephen suddenly spoke to Martin about
Morton.</p>

<p>They two were alone together in her study, and she said: There's
something I want to tell you&mdash;you must often have wondered why
I left home.'</p>

<p>He nodded: 'I've never quite liked to ask, because I know how
you loved the place, how you love it still...</p>

<p>'Yes, I love it,' she answered.</p>

<p>Then she let every barrier go down before him, blissfully
conscious of what she was doing. Not since Puddle had left her had
she been able to talk without restraint of her exile. And once
launched she had not the least wish to stop, but must tell him all,
omitting no detail save one that honour forbade her to
give&mdash;she withheld the name of Angela Crossby.</p>

<p>'It's so terribly hard on Mary,' she finished; 'think of it,
Mary's never seen Morton; she's not even met Puddle in all these
years! Of course Puddle can't very well come here to stay&mdash;how
can she and then go back to Morton? And yet I want her to live with
my mother...But the whole thing seems so outrageous for Mary.' She
went on to talk to him of her father: 'If my father had lived, I
know he'd have helped me. He loved me so much, and he
understood&mdash;I found out that my father knew all about me,
only&mdash;' She hesitated, and then: 'Perhaps he loved me too much
to tell me.'</p>

<p>Martin said nothing for quite a long time, and when he did speak
it was very gravely: 'Mary&mdash;how much does she know of all
this?'</p>

<p>'As little as I could possibly tell her. She knows that I can't
get on with my mother, and that my mother won't ask her to Morton;
but she doesn't know that I had to leave home because of a woman,
that I was turned out&mdash;I've wanted to spare her all I
could.'</p>

<p>'Do you think you were right?'</p>

<p>'Yes, a thousand times.'</p>

<p>'Well, only you can judge of that, Stephen.' He looked down at
the carpet, then he asked abruptly: 'Does she know about you and
me, about...</p>

<p>Stephen shook her head: 'No, she's no idea. She thinks you were
just my very good friend as you are to-day. I don't want her to
know.'</p>

<p>'For my sake?' he demanded.</p>

<p>And she answered slowly: Well, yes, I suppose so...for your
sake, Martin.'</p>

<p>Then an unexpected, and to her very moving thing happened; his
eyes filled with pitiful tears: 'Lord,' he muttered, 'why need this
have come upon you&mdash;this incomprehensible dispensation? It's
enough to make one deny God's existence!'</p>

<p>She felt a great need to reassure him. At that moment he seemed
so much younger than she was as he stood there with his eyes full
of pitiful tears, doubting God, because of his human compassion:
'There are still the trees. Don't forget the trees,
Martin&mdash;because of them you used to believe.'</p>

<p>'Have you come to believe in a God then?' he muttered.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she told him, 'it's strange, but I know now I
must&mdash;lots of us feel that way in the end. I'm not really
religious like some of the others, but I've got to acknowledge
God's existence, though at times I still think: "Can He really
exist?" One can't help it, when one's seen what I have here in
Paris. But unless there's a God, where do some of us find even the
little courage we possess?'</p>

<p>Martin stared out of the window in silence.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Mary was growing gentle again; infinitely gentle she now was at
times, for happiness, makes for gentleness, and in these days Mary
was strangely happy. Reassured by the presence of Martin Hallam,
reestablished in pride and self-respect, she was able to
contemplate the world without her erstwhile sense of isolation, was
able for the moment to sheathe her sword, and this respite brought
her a sense of well-being. She discovered that at heart she was
neither so courageous nor so defiant as she had imagined, that like
many another woman before her, she was well content to feel herself
protected; and gradually as the weeks went by, she began to forget
her bitter resentment.</p>

<p>One thing only distressed her, and this was Stephen's refusal to
accompany her when she went to Passy; she could not understand it,
so must put it down to the influence of Val&eacute;rie Seymour who
had met and disliked Martin's aunt at one time, indeed the dislike,
it seemed, had been mutual. Thus the vague resentment that
Val&eacute;rie had inspired in the girl, began to grow much less
vague, until Stephen realized with a shock of surprise that Mary
was jealous of Val&eacute;rie Seymour. But this seemed so absurd
and preposterous a thing, that Stephen decided it could only be
passing, nor did it loom very large in these days that were so
fully taken up by Martin. For now that his eyesight was quite
restored he was talking of going home in the autumn, and every free
moment that he could steal from his aunt, he wanted to spend with
Stephen and Mary. When he spoke of his departure, Stephen sometimes
fancied that a shade of sadness crept into Mary's face, and her
heart misgave her, though she told herself that naturally both of
them would miss Martin. Then too, never had Mary been more loyal
and devoted, more obviously anxious to prove her love by a thousand
little acts of devotion. There would even be times when by contrast
her manner would appear abrupt and unfriendly to Martin, when she
argued with him over every trifle, backing up her opinion by
quoting Stephen&mdash;yes, in spite of her newly restored
gentleness, these were times when she would not be gentle with
Martin. And these sudden and unforeseen changes of mood would leave
Stephen feeling uneasy and bewildered, so that one night she spoke
rather anxiously: 'Why were you so beastly to Martin this
evening?'</p>

<p>But Mary pretended not to understand her: 'How was I beastly? I
was just as usual.' And when Stephen persisted, Mary kissed her
scar: 'Darling, don't start working now, it's so late, and
besides...</p>

<p>Stephen put away her work, then she suddenly caught the girl to
her roughly: 'How much do you love me? Tell me quickly, quickly!'
Her voice shook with something very like fear.</p>

<p>'Stephen, you're hurting me&mdash;don't, you're hurting! You
know how I love you&mdash;more than life.'</p>

<p>'You are my life...all my life,' muttered Stephen.</p>

</p>

<p>FATE, which by now had them well in its grip, began to play the
game out more quickly. That summer they went to Pontresina since
Mary had never seen Switzerland; but the Comtesse must make a
double cure, first at Vichy and afterwards at Bagnoles de l'Orne,
which fact left Martin quite free to join them. Then it was that
Stephen perceived for the first time that all was not well with
Martin Hallam.</p>

<p>Try as he might he could not deceive her, for this man was
almost painfully honest, and any deception became him so ill that
it seemed to stand out like a badly fitting garment. Yet now there
were times when he avoided her eyes, when he grew very silent and
awkward with Stephen, as though something inevitable and unhappy
had obtruded itself upon their friendship; something, moreover,
that he feared to tell her. Then one day in a blinding flash of
insight she suddenly knew what this was&mdash;it was Mary.</p>

<p>Like a blow that is struck full between the eyes, the thing
stunned her, so that at first she groped blindly. Martin, her
friend...But what did it mean? And Mary...The incredible misery of
it if it were true. But was it true that Martin Hallam had grown to
love Mary? And the other thought, more incredible still&mdash;had
Mary in her turn grown to love Martin?</p>

<p>The mist gradually cleared; Stephen grew cold as steel, her
perceptions becoming as sharp as daggers&mdash;daggers that thrust
themselves into her soul, draining the blood from her innermost
being. And she watched. To herself she seemed all eyes and ears, a
monstrous thing, a complete degradation, yet endowed with an almost
unbearable skill, with a subtlety passing her own
understanding.</p>

<p>And Martin was no match for this thing that was Stephen. He, the
lover, could not hide his betraying eyes from her eyes that were
also those of a lover; could not stifle the tone that crept into
his voice at times when he was talking to Mary. Since all that he
felt was a part of herself, how could he hope to hide it from
Stephen? And he knew that she had discovered the truth, while she
in her turn perceived that he knew this, yet neither of them
spoke&mdash;in a deathly silence she watched, and in silence he
endured her watching.</p>

<p>It was rather a terrible summer for them all, the more so as
they were surrounded by beauty, and great peace when the evening
came down on the snows, turning the white, unfurrowed peaks to
sapphire and then to a purple darkness; hanging out large,
incredible stars above the wide slope of the Roseg Glacier. For
their hearts were full of unspoken dread, of clamorous passions, of
bewilderment that went very ill with the quiet fulfilments, with
the placid and smiling contentment of nature&mdash;and not the
least bewildered was Mary. Her respite, it seemed, had been
pitifully fleeting; now she was torn by conflicting emotions;
terrified and amazed at her realization that Martin meant more to
her than a friend, yet less, oh, surely much less than Stephen.
Like a barrier of fire her passion for the woman flared up to
forbid her love of the man; for as great as the mystery of
virginity itself, is sometimes the power of the one who has
destroyed it, and that power still remained in these days, with
Stephen.</p>

<p>Alone in his little bare hotel bedroom, Martin would wrestle
with his soul-sickening problem, convinced in his heart that but
for Stephen, Mary Llewellyn would grow to love him, nay more, that
she had grown to love him already. Yet Stephen was his
friend&mdash;he had sought her out, had all but forced his
friendship upon her; had forced his way into her life, her home,
her confidence; she had trusted his honour. And now he must either
utterly betray her or through loyalty to their friendship, betray
Mary.</p>

<p>And he felt that he knew, and knew only too well, what life
would do to Mary Llewellyn, what it had done to her already; for
had he not seen the bitterness in her, the resentment that could
only lead to despair, the defiance that could only lead to
disaster? She was setting her weakness against the whole world, and
slowly but surely the world would close in until in the end it had
utterly crushed her. In her very normality lay her danger. Mary,
all woman, was less of a match for life than if she had been as was
Stephen. Oh, most pitiful bond so strong yet so helpless; so
fruitful of passion yet so bitterly sterile; despairing,
heart-breaking, yet courageous bond that was even now holding them
ruthlessly together. But if he should break it by taking the girl
away into peace and security, by winning for her the world's
approbation so that never again need her back feel the scourge and
her heart grow faint from the pain of that scourging&mdash;if he,
Martin Hallam, should do this thing, what would happen, in that day
of his victory, to Stephen? Would she still have the courage to
continue the fight? Or would she, in her turn, be forced to
surrender? God help him, he could not betray her like this, he
could not bring about Stephen's destruction&mdash;and yet if he
spared her, he might destroy Mary.</p>

<p>Night after night alone in his bedroom during the miserable
weeks of that summer, Martin struggled to discover some ray of hope
in what seemed a wellnigh hopeless situation. And night after night
Stephen's masterful arms would enfold the warm softness of Mary's
body, the while she would be shaken as though with great cold.
Lying there she would shiver with terror and love, and this torment
of hers would envelop Mary so that sometimes she wept for the pain
of it all, yet neither would give a name to that torment.</p>

<p>'Stephen, why are you shivering?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, my darling.'</p>

<p>'Mary, why are you crying?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, Stephen.'</p>

<p>Thus the bitter nights slipped into the days, and the anxious
days slipped back into the nights, bringing to that curious trinity
neither helpful counsel nor consolation.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>It was after they had all returned to Paris that Martin found
Stephen alone one morning.</p>

<p>He said: 'I want to speak to you&mdash;I must.'</p>

<p>She put down her pen and looked into his eyes: Well, Martin,
what is it?' But she knew already.</p>

<p>He answered her very simply: 'It's Mary.' Then he said: 'I'm
going because I'm your friend and I love her...I must go because of
our friendship, and because I think Mary's grown to care for
me.'</p>

<p>He thought Mary cared...Stephen got up slowly, and all of a
sudden she was no more herself but the whole of her kind out to
combat this man, out to vindicate their right to possess, out to
prove that their courage was unshakable, that they neither admitted
of nor feared any rival.</p>

<p>She said coldly: 'If you're going because of me, because you
imagine that I'm frightened&mdash;then stay. I assure you I'm not
in the least afraid; here and now I defy you to take her from me!'
And even as she said this she marvelled at herself, for she was
afraid, terribly afraid of Martin.</p>

<p>He flushed at the quiet contempt in her voice, which roused all
the combative manhood in him: 'You think that Mary doesn't love me,
but you're wrong.'</p>

<p>'Very well then, prove that I'm wrong!' she told him.</p>

<p>They stared at each other in bitter hostility for a moment, then
Stephen said more gently: 'You don't mean to insult me by what you
propose, but I won't consent to your going, Martin. You think that
I can't hold the woman I love against you, because you've got an
advantage over me and over the whole of my kind. I accept that
challenge&mdash;I must accept it if I'm to remain at all worthy of
Mary.'</p>

<p>He bowed his head: 'It must be as you wish.' Then he suddenly
began to talk rather quickly: Stephen, listen, I hate what I'm
going to say, but by God, it's got to be said to you somehow!
You're courageous and fine and you mean to make good, but life with
you is spiritually murdering Mary. Can't you see it? Can't you
realize that she needs all the things that it's not in your power
to give her? Children, protection, friends whom she can respect and
who'll respect her&mdash;don't you realize this, Stephen? A few may
survive such relationships as yours, but Mary Llewellyn won't be
among them. She's not strong enough to fight the whole world, to
stand up against persecution and insult; it will drive her down,
begun to already&mdash;already she's been forced to turn to people
like Wanda. I know what I'm saying, I've seen the thing&mdash;the
bars, the drinking, the pitiful defiance, the horrible, useless
wastage of lives&mdash;well, I tell you it's spiritual murder for
Mary. I'd have gone away because you're my friend, but before I
went I'd have said all this to you; I'd have begged and implored
you to set Mary free if you love her. I'd have gone on my knees to
you, Stephen...</p>

<p>He paused, and she heard herself saying quite calmly: 'You don't
understand, I have faith in my writing, great faith; some day I
shall climb to the top and that will compel the world to accept me
for what I am. It's a matter of time, but I mean to succeed for
Mary's sake.'</p>

<p>'God pity you!' he suddenly blurted out. 'Your triumph, if it
comes, will come too late for Mary.'</p>

<p>She stared at him aghast: 'How dare you!' she stammered. 'How
dare you try to undermine my courage! You call yourself my friend
and you say things like that...</p>

<p>'It's your courage that I appeal to,' he answered. He began to
speak very quietly again: 'Stephen, if I stay I'm going to fight
you. Do you understand? We'll fight this thing out until one of us
has to admit that he's beaten. I'll do all in my power to take Mary
from you&mdash;all that's honourable, that is&mdash;for I mean to
play straight, because whatever you may think I'm your friend,
only, you see&mdash;I love Mary Llewellyn.'</p>

<p>And now she struck back. She said rather slowly, watching his
sensitive face as she did so: 'You seem to have thought it all out
very well, but then of course, our friendship has given you
time...</p>

<p>He flinched and she smiled, knowing how she could wound:
'Perhaps,' she went on, 'you'll tell me your plans. Supposing you
win, do I give the wedding? Is Mary to marry you from my house, or
would that be a grave social disadvantage? And supposing she should
want to leave me quite soon for love of you&mdash;where would you
take her, Martin? To your aunt's for respectability's sake?'</p>

<p>'Don't Stephen!'</p>

<p>'But why not? I've a right to know because, you see, I also love
Mary, I also consider her reputation. Yes, I think on the whole
we'll discuss your plans.'</p>

<p>'She'd always be welcome at my aunt's,' he said firmly.</p>

<p>'And you'll take her there if she runs away to your One never
knows what may happen, does one? You say that she cares for you
already...</p>

<p>His eyes hardened: 'If Mary will have me, Stephen, I shall take
her first to my aunt's house in Passy.'</p>

<p>'And then?' she mocked.</p>

<p>'I shall marry her from there.'</p>

<p>'And then?'</p>

<p>'I shall take her back to my home.'</p>

<p>'To Canada&mdash;I see&mdash;a safe distance of course.'</p>

<p>He held out his hand: 'Oh, for God's sake, don't! It's so
horrible somehow&mdash;be merciful, Stephen.'</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly: 'Why should I be merciful to you? Isn't it
enough that I accept your challenge, that I offer you the freedom
of my house, that I don't turn you out and forbid you to come here?
Come by all means, whenever you like. You may even repeat our
conversation to Mary; I shall not do so, but don't let that stop
you if you think you may possibly gain some advantage.'</p>

<p>He shook his head: 'No. I shan't repeat it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, that must be as you think best, I propose to behave
as though nothing had happened&mdash;and now I must get along with
my work.'</p>

<p>He hesitated: 'Won't you shake hands?'</p>

<p>'Of course,' she smiled; 'aren't you my very good friend? But
you know, you really must leave me now, Martin.'</p>

</p>

<p>After he had gone she lit a cigarette; the action was purely
automatic. She felt strangely excited yet strangely numb&mdash;a
most curious synthesis of sensations; then she suddenly felt
deathly sick and giddy. Going up to her bedroom she bathed her
face, sat down on the bed and tried to think, conscious that her
mind was completely blank. She was thinking of nothing&mdash;not
even of Mary.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch55" id="ch55"></a>Chapter Fifty-five</h3>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>A bitter and most curious warfare it was that must now be waged
between Martin and Stephen, but secretly waged, lest because of
them the creature they loved should be brought to suffer; not the
least strange aspect being that these two must quite often take
care to protect each other, setting a guard upon eyes and lips when
they found themselves together with Mary. For the sake of the girl
whom they sought to protect, they must actually often protect each
other. Neither would stoop to detraction or malice, though they
fought in secret they did so with honour. And all the while their
hearts cried out loudly against this cruel and insidious thing that
had laid its hand upon their doomed friendship&mdash;verily a
bitter and most curious warfare.</p>

<p>And now Stephen, brought suddenly face to face with the menace
of infinite desolation, fell back upon her every available weapon
in the struggle to assert her right to possession. Every link that
the years had forged between her and Mary, every tender and
passionate memory that bound their past to their ardent present,
every moment of joy&mdash;aye, and even of sorrow, she used in
sheer self-defence against Martin. And not the least powerful of
all her weapons was the perfect companionship and understanding
that constitutes the great strength of such unions. Well armed she
was, thanks to both present and past&mdash;but Martin's sole weapon
lay in the future.</p>

<p>With a new subtlety that was born of his love, he must lead the
girl's thoughts very gently forward towards a life of security and
peace; such a life as marriage with him would offer. In a thousand
little ways must redouble his efforts to make himself indispensable
to her, to surround her with the warm, happy cloak of protection
that made even a hostile world seem friendly. And although he
forbore to speak openly as yet, playing his hand with much skill
and patience&mdash;although before speaking he wished to be certain
that Mary Llewellyn, of her own free will, would come when he
called her, because she loved him&mdash;yet nevertheless she
divined his love, for men cannot hide such knowledge from
women.</p>

<p>Very pitiful Mary was in these days, torn between the two
warring forces; haunted by a sense of disloyalty if she thought
with unhappiness of losing Martin, hating herself for a treacherous
coward if she sometimes longed for the life he could offer, above
all intensely afraid of this man who was creeping in between her
and Stephen. And the very fact of this fear made her yield to the
woman with a new and more desperate ardour, so that the bond held
as never before&mdash;the days might be Martin's, but the nights
were Stephen's. And yet, lying awake far into the dawn, Stephen's
victory would take on the semblance of defeat, turned to ashes by
the memory of Martin's words: Your triumph, if it comes will come
too late for Mary.' In the morning she would go to her desk and
write, working with something very like frenzy, as though it were
now a neck to neck race between the world and her ultimate
achievement. Never before had she worked like this; she would feel
that her pen was dipped in blood, that with every word she wrote,
she was bleeding!</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Christmas came and went, giving place to the New Year, and
Martin fought on but he fought more grimly. He was haunted these
days by the spectre of defeat, painfully conscious that do what he
might, nearly every advantage lay with Stephen. All that he loved
and admired most in Mary, her frankness, her tender and loyal
spirit, her compassion towards suffering of any kind, these very
attributes told against him, serving as they did to bind her more
firmly to the creature to whom she had given devotion. One thing
only sustained the man at this time, and that was his conviction
that in spite of it all, Mary Llewellyn had grown to love him.</p>

<p>So careful she was when they were together, so guarded lest she
should betray her feelings, so pitifully insistent that all was yet
well&mdash;that life had in no way lessened her courage. But Martin
was not deceived by these protests, knowing how she clung to what
he could offer, how gladly she turned to the simple things that so
easily come to those who are normal. Under all her parade of
gallantry he divined a great weariness of spirit, a great longing
to be at peace with the world, to be able to face her fellow-men
with the comforting knowledge that she need not fear them, that
their friendship would be hers for the asking, that their laws and
their codes would be her protection. All this Martin perceived; but
Stephen's perceptions were even more accurate and far-reaching, for
to her there had come the despairing knowledge that the women she
loved was deeply unhappy. At first she had blinded herself to this
truth, sustained by the passionate stress of the battle, by her
power to hold in despite of the man, by the eager response that she
had awakened. Yet the day came when she was no longer blind, when
nothing counted in all the world except this grievous unhappiness
that was being silently borne by Mary.</p>

<p>Martin, if he had wished for revenge, might have taken his fill
of it now from Stephen. Little did he know how, one by one, Mary
was weakening her defences; gradually undermining her will, her
fierce determination to hold, the arrogance of the male that was in
her. All this the man was never to know; it was Stephen's secret,
and she knew how to keep it. But one night she suddenly pushed Mary
away, blindly, scarcely knowing what she was doing; conscious only
that the weapon she thus laid aside had become a thing altogether
unworthy, an outrage upon her love for this girl. And that night
there followed the terrible thought that her love itself was a kind
of outrage.</p>

<p>And now she must pay very dearly indeed for that inherent
respect of the normal which nothing had ever been able to destroy,
not even the long years of persecution&mdash;an added burden it
was, handed down by the silent but watchful founders of Morton. She
must pay for the instinct which, in earliest childhood, had made
her feel something akin to worship for the perfect thing which she
had divined in the love that existed between her parents. Never
before had she seen so clearly all that was lacking to Mary
Llewellyn, all that would pass from her faltering grasp, perhaps
never to return, with the passing of Martin&mdash;children, a home
that the world would respect, ties of affection that the world
would hold sacred, the bless&egrave;d security and the peace of
being released from the world's persecution. And suddenly Martin
appeared to Stephen as a creature endowed with incalculable bounty,
having in his hands all those priceless gifts which she, love's
mendicant could never offer. Only one gift could 'she offer to
love, to Mary, and that was the gift of Martin.</p>

<p>In a kind of dream she perceived these things. In a dream she
now moved and had her being; scarcely conscious of whither this
dream would lead, the while her every perception was quickened. And
this dream of hers was immensely compelling, so that all that she
did seemed clearly predestined; she could not have acted otherwise,
nor could she have made a false step, although dreaming. Like those
who in sleep tread the edge of a chasm unappalled, having lost all
sense of danger, so now Stephen walked on the brink of her fate,
having only one fear; a nightmare fear of what she must do to give
Mary her freedom.</p>

<p>In obedience to the mighty but unseen will that had taken
control of this vivid dreaming, she ceased to respond to the girl's
tenderness, nor would she consent that they two should be lovers.
Ruthless as the world itself she became, and almost as cruel in
this ceaseless wounding. For in spite of Mary's obvious misgivings,
she went more and more often to see Val&eacute;rie Seymour, so that
gradually, as the days slipped by, Mary's mind became a prey to
suspicion. Yet Stephen struck at her again and again, desperately
wounding herself in the process, though scarcely feeling the pain
of her wounds for the misery of what she was doing to Mary. But
even as she struck the bonds seemed to tighten, with each fresh
blow to bind more securely. Mary now clung with every fibre of her
sorely distressed and outraged being; with every memory that
Stephen had stirred; with every passion that Stephen had fostered;
with every instinct of loyalty that Stephen had aroused to do
battle with Martin. The hand that had loaded Mary with chains was
powerless, it seemed, to strike them from her.</p>

<p>Came the day when Mary refused to see Martin, when she turned
upon Stephen, pale and accusing: 'Can't you understand? Are you
utterly blind&mdash;have you only got eyes now for Val&eacute;rie
Seymour?'</p>

<p>And as though she were suddenly smitten dumb, Stephen's lips
remained closed and she answered nothing.</p>

<p>Then Mary wept and cried out against her: 'I won't let you
go&mdash;I won't let you, I tell you! It's your fault if I love you
the way I do. I can't do without you, you've taught me to need you,
and now...In half-shamed, half-defiant words she must stand there
and plead for what Stephen withheld, and Stephen must listen to
such pleading from Mary. Then before the girl realized it she had
said: 'But for you I could have loved Martin Hallam!'</p>

<p>Stephen heard her own voice a long way away: But for me, you
could have loved Martin Hallam.'</p>

<p>Mary flung despairing arms round her neck: 'No, no! Not that, I
don't know what I'm saying.'</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>The first faint breath of spring was in the air, bringing
daffodils to the flower-stalls of Paris. Once again Mary's young
cherry tree in the garden was pushing out leaves and tiny pink buds
along the whole length of its childish branches.</p>

<p>Then Martin wrote: Stephen, where can I see you? It must be
alone. Better not at your house, I think, if you don't mind,
because of Mary.'</p>

<p>She appointed the place. They would meet at the Auberge du Vieux
Logis in the Rue Lepic. They two would meet there on the following
evening. When she left the house without saying a word, Mary
thought she was going to Val&eacute;rie Seymour.</p>

<p>Stephen sat down at a table in the corner to await Martin's
coming&mdash;she herself was early. The table was gay with a new
check cloth&mdash;red and white, white and red, she counted the
squares, tracing them carefully out with her finger. The woman
behind the bar nudged her companion: 'En voila une
originals&mdash;et quelle cicatrice, bon Dieu!' The scar across
Stephen's pale face stood out livid.</p>

<p>Martin came and sat quietly down at her side, ordering some
coffee for appearances' sake. For appearances' sake, until it was
brought, they smiled at each other and made conversation. But when
the waiter had turned away, Martin said: 'It's all
over&mdash;you've beaten me, Stephen...The bond was too
strong.'</p>

<p>Their unhappy eyes met as she answered: 'I tried to strengthen
that bond.'</p>

<p>He nodded: 'I know...Well, my dear, you succeeded.' Then he
said: 'I'm leaving Paris next week,' and in spite of his effort to
be calm his voice broke, 'Stephen...do what you can to take care of
Mary.'</p>

<p>She found that she was holding his hand. Or was it someone else
who sat there beside him, who looked into his sensitive, troubled
face, who spoke such queer words?</p>

<p>'No, don't go&mdash;not yet.'</p>

<p>'But I don't understand...</p>

<p>'You must trust me, Martin.' And now she heard herself speaking
very gravely: 'Would you trust me enough to do anything I asked,
even though it seemed rather strange? Would you trust me if I said
that I asked it for Mary, for her happiness?'</p>

<p>His fingers tightened: 'Before God, yes. You know that I'd trust
you!'</p>

<p>'Very well then, don't leave Paris&mdash;not now.'</p>

<p>'You really want me to stay on, Stephen?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I can't explain.'</p>

<p>He hesitated, then he suddenly seemed to come to a decision: All
right...I'll do whatever you ask me.'</p>

<p>They paid for their coffee and got up to leave: 'Let me come as
far as the house,' he pleaded.</p>

<p>But she shook her head: 'No, no, not now. I'll write to
you...very soon...Good-bye, Martin.'</p>

<p>She watched him hurrying down the street, and when he was
finally lost in its shadows, she turned slowly and made her own way
up the hill, past the garish lights of the Moulin de la Galette.
Its pitiful sails revolved in the wind, eternally grinding out
petty sins&mdash;dry chaff blown in from the gutters of Paris. And
after a while, having breasted the hill, she must climb a dusty
flight of stone steps, and push open a heavy slow-moving door; the
door of the mighty temple of faith that keeps its anxious but
tireless vigil.</p>

<p>She had no idea why she was doing this thing, or what she would
say to the silver Christ with one hand on His heart and the other
held out in a patient gesture of supplication. The sound of
praying, monotonous, low, insistent, rose up from those who prayed
with extended arms, with crucified arms&mdash;like the tides of an
ocean it swelled and receded and swelled again, bathing the shores
of heaven.</p>

<p>They were calling upon the Mother of God: 'Sainte Marie, Mere de
Dieu, priez pour nous, pauvres p&ecirc;cheurs, maintenant et
&agrave; l'heure de notre mort.'</p>

<p>'Et &agrave; l'heure de notre mort,' Stephen heard herself
repeating.</p>

<p>He looked terribly weary, the silver Christ: 'But then He always
looks tired,' she thought vaguely; and she stood there without
finding anything to say, embarrassed as one so frequently is in the
presence of somebody else's sorrow. For herself she felt nothing,
neither pity nor regret; she was curiously empty of all sensation,
and after a little she left the church, to walk on through the
wind-swept streets of Montmartre.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie stared at Stephen in amazement: 'But...it's such
an extraordinary thing you're asking! Are you sure you're right to
take such a step? For myself I care nothing; why should I care: If
you want to pretend that you're my lover, well, my dear, to be
quite frank, I wish it were true&mdash;I feel certain you'd make a
most charming lover. All the same,' and now her voice sounded
anxious, 'this is not a thing to be done lightly, Stephen. Aren't
you being absurdly self-sacrificing? You can give the girl a very
great deal.'</p>

<p>Stephen shook her head: 'I can't give her protection or
happiness, and yet she won't leave me. There's only one way...'</p>

<p>Then Val&eacute;rie Seymour, who had always shunned tragedy like
the plague, flared out in something very like temper: 'Protection!
Protection! I'm sick of the word. Let her do without it; aren't you
enough for her? Good heavens, you're worth twenty Mary Llewellyns!
Stephen, think it over before you decide&mdash;it seems mad to me.
For God's sake keep the girl, and get what happiness you can out of
life.'</p>

<p>'No, I can't do that,' said Stephen dully.</p>

<p>Val&eacute;rie got up: 'Being what you are, I suppose you
can't&mdash;you were made for a martyr! Very well, I agree'; she
finished abruptly, 'though of all the curious situations that I've
ever been in, this one beats the lot!'</p>

<p>That night Stephen wrote to Martin Hallam.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Two days later as she crossed the street to her house, Stephen
saw Martin in the shadow of the archway. He stepped out and they
faced each other on the pavement. He had kept his word; it was just
ten o'clock.</p>

<p>He said: 'I've come. Why did you send for me, Stephen?' She
answered heavily: 'Because of Mary.'</p>

<p>And something in her face made him catch his breath, so that the
questions died on his lips: 'I'll do whatever you want,' he
murmured.</p>

<p>'It's so simple,' she told him, 'it's all perfectly simple. I
want you to wait just under this arch just here where you can't be
seen from the house. I want you to wait until Mary needs you, as I
think she will...it may not be long...Can I count on your being
here if she needs you?'</p>

<p>He nodded: 'Yes&mdash;yes!' He was utterly bewildered, scared
too by the curious look in her eyes; but he allowed her to pass him
and enter the courtyard.</p>

<p class="cp"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>She let herself into the house with her latchkey. The place
seemed full of articulate silence that leapt out shouting from
every corner&mdash;a jibing, grimacing, vindictive silence. She
brushed it aside with a sweep of her hand, as though it were some
sort of physical presence.</p>

<p>But who was it who brushed that silence aside? Not Stephen
Gordon...oh, no, surely not...Stephen Gordon was dead; she had died
last night: 'A l'heure de notre mort...' Many people had spoken
those prophetic words quite a short time ago&mdash;perhaps they had
been thinking of Stephen Gordon.</p>

<p>Yet now someone was slowly climbing the stairs, then pausing
upon the landing to listen, then opening the door of Mary's
bedroom, then standing quite still and staring at Mary. It was
someone whom David knew and loved well; he sprang forward with a
sharp little bark of welcome. But Mary shrank back as though she
had been struck&mdash;Mary pale and red-eyed from
sleeplessness&mdash;or was it because of excessive weeping?</p>

<p>When she spoke her voice sounded unfamiliar: 'Where were you
last night?'</p>

<p>'With Val&eacute;rie Seymour. I thought you'd know
somehow...It's better to be frank...we both hate lies...'</p>

<p>Came that queer voice again: 'Good God&mdash;and I've tried so
hard not to believe it! Tell me you're lying to me now; say it,
Stephen!'</p>

<p>Stephen&mdash;then she wasn't dead after all; or was she? But
now Mary was clinging&mdash;clinging.</p>

<p>'Stephen, I can't believe this thing&mdash;Val&eacute;rie! Is
that why you always repulse me...why you never want to conic near
me these days? Stephen, answer me; are you her lover? Say
something, for Christ's sake! Don't stand there dumb...'</p>

<p>A mist dosing down, a thick black mist. Someone pushing the girl
away, without speaking. Mary's queer voice coming out of the gloom,
muffled by the folds of that thick black mist, only a word here and
there getting through: 'All my life I've given...you've killed...I
loved you...Cruel, oh, cruel! You're unspeakably cruel...'Then the
sound of rough and pitiful sobbing.</p>

<p>No, assuredly this was not Stephen Gordon who stood there
unmoved by such pitiful sobbing. But what was the figure doing in
the mist? It was moving about, distractedly, wildly. All the while
it sobbed as it was moving about: 'I'm going...'</p>

<p>Going? But where could it go Somewhere out of the mist,
somewhere into the light? Who was it that had said...wait, what
were the words? 'To give light to them that sit in darkness...'</p>

<p>No one was moving about any more&mdash;there was only a dog, a
dog called David. Something had to be done. Go into the bedroom,
Stephen Gordon's bedroom that faced on the courtyard...just a few
short steps and then the window. A girl hatless, with the sun
falling full on her hair...she was almost running...she stumbled a
little. But now there were two people down in the courtyard&mdash;a
man had his hands on the girl's bowed shoulders. He questioned her,
yes, that was it, he questioned; and the girl was telling him why
she was there, why she had fled from that thick, awful darkness. He
was looking at the house, incredulous, amazed; hesitating as though
he were coming in; but the girl went on and the man turned to
follow...They were side by side, he was gripping her arm...They
were gone; they had passed out under the archway.</p>

<p>Then all in a moment the stillness was shattered: 'Mary, come
back! Come back to me, Mary!'</p>

<p>David crouched and trembled. He had crawled to the bed, and he
lay there watching with his eyes of amber; trembling because such
an anguish as this struck across him like the lash of a whip, and
what could he do, the poor beast, in his dumbness?</p>

<p>She turned and saw him, but only for a moment, for now the room
seemed to be thronging with people. Who were they, these strangers
with the miserable eyes? And yet, were they all strangers? Surely
that was Wanda? And someone with a neat little hole in her
side&mdash;Jamie clasping Barbara by the hand; Barbara with the
white flowers of death on her bosom. Oh, but they were many, these
unbidden guests, and they called very softly at first and then
louder. They were calling her by name, saying: 'Stephen, Stephen!'
The quick, the dead, and the yet unborn&mdash;all calling her,
softly at first and then louder. Aye, and those lost and terrible
brothers from Alec's, they were here, and they also were calling:
'Stephen, Stephen, speak with your God and ask Him why He has left
us forsaken!' She could see their marred and reproachful faces with
the haunted, melancholy eyes of the invert&mdash;eyes that had
looked too long on a world that lacked all pity and all
understanding: 'Stephen, Stephen, speak with your God and ask Him
why He has left us forsaken!' And these terrible ones started
pointing at her with their shaking, white-skinned, effeminate
fingers: 'You and your kind have stolen our birthright; you have
taken our strength and have given us your weakness!' They were
pointing at her with white shaking fingers.</p>

<p>Rockets of pain, burning rockets of pain&mdash;their pain, her
pain, all welded together into one great consuming agony. Rockets
of pain that shot up and burst, dropping scorching tears of fire on
the spirit&mdash;her pain, their pain...all the misery at Alec's.
And the press and the clamour of those countless others&mdash;they
fought, they trampled, they were getting her under. In their
madness to become articulate through her, they were tearing her to
pieces, getting her under. They were everywhere now, cutting off
her retreat; neither bolts nor bars would avail to save her. The
walls fell down and crumbled before them; at the cry of their
suffering the walls fell and crumbled: 'We are coming,
Stephen&mdash;we are still coming on, and our name is
legion&mdash;you dare not disown us!' She raised her arms, trying
to ward them off, but they closed in and in: 'You dare not disown
us!'</p>

<p>They possessed her. Her barren womb became fruitful&mdash;it
ached with its fearful and sterile burden. It ached with the fierce
yet helpless children who would clamour in vain for their right to
salvation. They would turn first to God, and then to the world, and
then to her. They would cry out accusing: 'We have asked for bread;
will you give us a stone? Answer us: will you give us a stone? You,
God, in Whom we, the outcast, believe; you, world, into which we
are pitilessly born; you, Stephen, who have drained our cup to the
dregs&mdash;we have asked for bread; will you give us a stone?'</p>

<p>And now there was only one voice, one demand; her own voice into
which those millions had entered. A voice like the awful, deep
rolling of thunder; a demand like the gathering together of great
waters. A terrifying voice that made her ears throb, that made her
brain throb, that shook her very entrails, until she must stagger
and all but fall beneath this appalling burden of sound that
strangled her in its will to be uttered.</p>

<p>'God,' she gasped, we believe; we have told You we believe...We
have not denied You, then rise up and defend us. Acknowledge us, oh
God, before the whole world. Give us also the right to our
existence!'</p>
