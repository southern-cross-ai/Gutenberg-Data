  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; THE FIRST MAGNUM</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, December
  1903</h3>

  <p class="first">THE year 1902 drew to a close, and Delhi was swarming thrice
  its common size in preparation for the Great Durbar, whereat the accession of
  the first English Emperor of India was to be proclaimed. Northward, beyond
  the historic Ridge, a new and an even more wonderful Delhi had sprung up in
  the course of weeks; At Delhi of ten thousand tents, with more than thirty
  miles of streets between them; a city that it would take a man seven or eight
  hours of continuous smart marching to walk round.</p>

  <p>For weeks the tramp of elephants and horses had filled the air day by day,
  and had rarely ceased at night. The camps of the native princes lay in
  carefully-planned order, and the comings and goings of the princes
  themselves&mdash;emulous, proud, jealous in trifles&mdash;were announced
  punctiliously by the proper number of guns, from twenty-one downward, the
  envied and eagerly-sought salute that grades Indian princes by absolute
  mathematical scale.</p>

  <p>Under the frail canvas of that camp lay the ransom of a hundred kings in
  gems and gold and precious stuffs. Diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls, in
  strings, in dozens and in scores, each stone a marvel even among the rest,
  were brought together there in an assemblage impossible to make in any other
  part of the globe. Even the lesser rajahs, thakores, and nawabs had brought
  for their adornment many gems of great name, such as singly would stand
  heirlooms in the royal houses of Europe.</p>

  <p>Not the least renowned among these was the Eye of Deccan, the wonderful
  green diamond belonging to the Rajah of Goona. Indeed, amid that assembly of
  marvellous gems the Eye of Deccan took rank among the very greatest&mdash;far
  higher rank than the Rajah took among the princes; for he could claim only a
  nine-gun salute, which placed him merely in the seventh grade, with the
  eleven-gun, the thirteen-gun, the fifteen-gun, the seventeen-gun, and the
  nineteen-gun degrees between it and the topmost rank of twenty-one guns,
  reserved for the three greatest native princes of all India.</p>

  <p>The Eye of Deccan was the more ancient name of the jewel, which nowadays
  was more commonly called the Eye of Goona. It was famous alike for its
  colour, its size, and its history. Of coloured diamonds, the green are the
  rarest, and this was not only of a gloriously brilliant emerald tint, but of
  extraordinary size, being nearly three times the weight of the renowned
  pale-green diamond kept at Dresden, as well as of incomparably finer colour.
  In shape it was an oval brilliant fully an inch and a half long and a shade
  more than an inch wide. When this amazing stone had left the mine no man
  could tell, for it had been known all over India as the envy and contention
  of kings for nearly a thousand years. Purchase, spoliation, murder,
  treachery, theft, and war had passed it from hand to hand till at last it had
  rested in the treasure house of Akbar the Great, and there remained till the
  death of his descendant Aurungzebe. In the fall of the dynasty of Akbar early
  in the eighteenth century and the general disruption which followed it, the
  Eye of Deccan disappeared, and it was only on the establishment of safe and
  steady government under British domination that it was allowed to
  appear&mdash;this time in possession of the Rajah of Goona, ancestor of the
  present Rajah now camping at Delhi to do homage to the new Emperor
  represented by his Viceroy.</p>

  <p>One after another through the last weeks of the year the trumpeting,
  trampling processions rolled into camp till the tents were full of princes
  and their retinues; and then on a cool, clear night, the customary noises of
  tethered elephants and waking horses were broken upon by a riot of human
  shouts and yells.</p>

  <p>The disturbance was over in a very few minutes, and the rumour ran round
  the camp that a thief had entered the tents of the Rajah of Goona, and had
  been cut down by the Rajah's Chief Minister as he was crawling away. And in
  the morning more was known. The thief was dead, and his body, black, naked,
  and oiled from top to toe, had been identified; he was a thief by trade, of a
  family of thieves. He had entered the tent in the dead of night, had effected
  his robbery, and was escaping silently, when he was observed by Mehta Singh,
  the Chief Minister, and cut down, two blows of a heavy tulwar putting an end
  to his thieving for all time. And the plunder which he was carrying away was
  no other than the Eye of Goona itself!</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-01.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>This last news kept the camp talking from end to end. The audacity of the
  thief was great enough, but the wonder was how, having entered the tent
  without being seen by the guards, he was able to put his hand directly on the
  great jewel, or to pick the lock of the case in which it was doubtless kept.
  The thing carried a smell of treachery; it seemed clear that somebody in the
  Rajah's train had betrayed his trust and sold information to the thief. This
  was agreed on all hands; but at any rate the plot had been frustrated, and by
  the faithful vigilance of Mehta Singh the jewel had been restored; that was
  enough. More, the great ceremony was now coming on, so the camp turned to the
  business before it, and talked little more of the attempt on the Eye of
  Goona.</p>

  <p>Talked little of it, that is to say, till after the great
  Durbar&mdash;even later. For it was not till the whole programme of the
  splendid fortnight had been worked through, and the Viceroy had departed in
  state, that the rumour&mdash;the news, for it was proclaimed a
  certainty&mdash;hummed through the breaking camp that the stone which had
  been taken from the hands of the dead thief was now found to be a mere
  coloured crystal, and that the Eye of Goona was gone after all!</p>

  <p>Brought out into the light of day amid other great jewels, the supposed
  Eye had seemed curiously dull and lacking in fire. The Rajah grew suspicious,
  and when opportunity served he sent for his own lapidary, who condemned the
  imposture at sight.</p>

  <p>What did it mean? At first it seemed probable that there must have been
  two thieves, with a plan to substitute the imitation stone for the real; that
  they had been interrupted in the very act of the robbery, and that one had
  escaped in the darkness with the jewel, while the other had been pounced on
  by Mehta Singh before he had "planted" the imitation. But then another and a
  simpler possibility grew apparent. Might not the Eye of Goona have been
  stolen already, before the Rajah's train came to Delhi, and the imitation
  left in its place? It might have been months before&mdash;even years; and
  while the slain thief had lost his life in an unwitting attempt to steal the
  sham gem, the real jewel might lie safely in the hands of another.</p>

  <p>Of the two possibilities this last seemed the more likely, and grew into
  more general acceptance as the efforts of the police and of the Rajah's
  secret agents proved futile. The camps broke up and scattered throughout
  India, carrying with them to every corner the news of the loss of the Eye of
  Deccan.</p>

  <p>Bazaar rumour said this and that, telling lies and truth in good
  admixture. And at last there came in whispers a strange tale, told now in one
  way and then in another; but the substance of it was that there was no more
  Mehta Singh in Goona. Dark things are done in the smaller native states,
  which the British Residents hear less of than is whispered in the vernacular
  in the streets. Mehta Singh had vanished, that all the whisperers agreed; but
  how he had vanished was a matter of doubt and mystery. It would have been no
  new or strange thing for a rajah in his own palace, enraged at the loss of a
  favourite jewel, to take vengeance on the officer whose duty it had been to
  keep it safe, or who had failed to recover it, once it had gone, no matter
  how faithfully he had tried; and such a thing would be done with secrecy and
  hidden with great care in these days of the British Raj. The same fate might
  have befallen any member of the household suspected of complicity in the
  theft. However that might be, the fate of Mehta Singh, who had struck down
  the thief in the Durbar camp, remained as much a mystery as that of the Eye
  of Goona itself.</p>

  <p>Among the many Europeans attracted to the great spectacle at Delhi were a
  good few who came on business. There were travellers from firms in Europe and
  in Calcutta, as well as many traders on their own accounts. For instance,
  there was Hahn, of Europe in general, who bought and sold whatever was to be
  bought cheap and sold dear all over the world, from old Italian masters to
  domestic machinery. Hahn spoke English for the most past, and called himself
  Frank, though there were those who called him Franz, and there was a trifling
  accent in his excellent English that seemed to give them reason. Hahn had
  effected a trade here and there, had sold on his own account and on
  commission some sporting guns among the rajahs, and some new European
  furniture: and he had picked up a curious bargain in the shape of a dozen
  magnums of old Tokey, which had been lying forgotten in some great Delhi
  cellar since early in the nineteenth century; and in the middle of the
  celebrations he had been laid up with a bad touch of fever. It was while he
  had been so laid up that he sent to beg a call from Mr. Harvey Crook, who was
  himself a visitor on business.</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook was not what one would call a dealer, although it was a fact
  that he made his living by deals in strange things&mdash;deals few and far
  between, but each sufficiently profitable to keep him going in the way of
  life he loved best, travelling the world through, and taking adventures as
  they came. He was a wiry man of about the middle size or a trifle under, dark
  because of his constant travel, though naturally of the complexion of the
  average Englishman; keen of eye and active as a cat; and his age was
  thirty-five.</p>

  <p>He received Hahn's message with some surprise, for his acquaintance with
  the man was very slight. But on reflection he could not remember that anybody
  else about Delhi just then was any more intimate with Hahn than he was
  himself; so with no particular enthusiasm, he lit another cigar and strolled
  into the Delhi streets.</p>

  <p>He found the dealer lying in a darkened room, in a house which had been
  hired temporarily as an annexe to an hotel. There was not much sickness
  about, it was an uncommon time of year for fever, and Crook wondered to find
  the room kept so dark unless the case were very bad indeed. It scarcely
  seemed that it was, for Hahn greeted him with great friendliness.</p>

  <p>"Good-day, my dear Crook," he said; "you are an angel of light here in the
  dark room. It is good of you to come." There was a faint likeness to "goot"
  and "gom" in two of the words, and "angel" sounded a little like "anchel;"
  but not enough to notice.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Crook replied civilly. "What can I do for you? Not very bad,
  I hope? Wrong time of year for fever, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, but I am very subject. I am better now&mdash;just for an hour.
  I take it like that; presently I shall be much worse. When will you be going
  back home? Soon, I expect?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;the next boat from Bombay when the shindy's over. It's lucky my
  passage was booked&mdash;they're pretty well crowded up."</p>

  <p>"That's the <i>Rajapur</i>, isn't it? Not a mail boat?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right. The P. &amp; O. mail's a week after. The <i>Rajapur's</i> a
  slower boat, but all I could get, and quite good enough. Want me to do
  anything for you aboard?"</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook was sitting by the bed, and Hahn took him by the wrist. "I
  want you to take a case," he said, "a case of wine. Will you? I'll do as much
  for you some day. It's valuable stuff."</p>

         alt="Illustration"

  </div><br>

  <p>Harvey Crook's home-going baggage was small enough, for he was carrying
  nothing but his personal belongings. "All right," he said. "I daresay I can.
  Want me to take it to a customer at home?"</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;not to a customer; only to take it and see it isn't damaged.
  If you will, of course I'll pay expenses, and I'm good for a commission when
  the stuff's sold. I don't see why I shouldn't get a hundred for it if I wait
  a bit. It's a dozen magnums of Imperial Tokay&mdash;eighty years in bottle!
  It's been lying lost for three-quarters of a century and I picked it up for
  next to nothing, on a deal for something else. No doubt it was part of some
  present&mdash;perhaps to the old Mogul. You'll take it for me, won't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I'll take it. But what shall I do with it when I get it home? I
  shan't be wanting to sit still, you know."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, thank you, my dear Crook&mdash;that will be all right. If I
  don't let you know before you start I will by the time you reach
  England&mdash;the mail will be some days ahead of you, of course, though it
  starts a week later; and if necessary I'll cable. You may be assured, my dear
  Crook, that it shan't hamper you in the least&mdash;not in the least; I
  should like to get if off my mind at once. Will you take it with you
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you like. Where is it? I'll get an ekka."</p>

  <p>"Will you? There's a good chap. I wouldn't trouble you, but there's nobody
  I can trust, you know&mdash;I wouldn't ask any of them rascally Germans."</p>

  <p>Here again the word was a little like "Chermance," but only a very
  little.</p>

  <p>"I thought to myself," Hahn went on, "that I'd ask you to do it, if you
  didn't mind, being a man I'd trust with anything, of course, my dear
  Crook."</p>

  <p>"All right," Crook answered with an embarrassed laugh. "Not that I've met
  a great many people who say that!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but I know I could trust you anywhere, my dear Crook," the other went
  on, with his eyes intent on the younger man's face; for Hahn was a man of
  very near fifty, with a short grey beard. "I knew I could trust you,
  especially as you know it's an important thing for me, with a wife and family
  at home. Things have been very bad lately, and a clear hundred
  pounds&mdash;if I can get as much&mdash;or even eighty or ninety would mean a
  good deal more to me than you might think. Where will you stay in
  London?"</p>

  <p>"At Standish's Hotel. Letters will find me either there or at the
  Aborigine Club."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, thank you ever so much, my dear Crook," concluded Hahn,
  gripping Crook's hand with fervour. "Have they got your ekka? I won't keep
  you any longer&mdash;so good of you to come and all. Good-bye! They will be
  bringing my medicine. Good-bye! You'll be sure to take particular care none
  of the bottles are broken, won't you? That would be terrible&mdash;it's one
  of the reasons I'm asking you to do it, care being so important, you know.
  Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook went off a little amused. Hahn was a thrifty soul, and had
  made an enormous great fuss about eight or a hundred pounds' worth of old
  wine; no doubt a sick man's fancy had something to do with the matter. As for
  things having been bad with Hahn of late, that seemed very unlikely. But, of
  course, he reflected, a wife and family must make a good deal of difference;
  though&mdash;no doubt owing to his slight acquaintance&mdash;he had never
  head of Hahn's wife and family before.</p>

  <p>The voyage home on the <i>Rajapur</i> was pleasant enough, the cooler
  season making its influence felt to some extent even in the Red Sea. Among
  Harvey Crook's fellow passengers he came much in contact with Mr. Lyman W.
  Merrick, a wealthy American and a very good fellow, who was taking his first
  holiday for many years in the shape of a tour round the world with his
  daughter, Daisy, and, of course, had made the Delhi Durbar his chief
  objective. Harvey Crook's many tales of his experiences by land and sea
  vastly entertained Mr. Merrick, and went all the way to reconcile him to the
  necessity, repugnant to his habits of "hustle," of travelling in a slower
  vessel than the mail ship because of the impossibility of obtaining berths in
  anything faster.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Crook," said the American, as they sat smoking in deck-chairs
  on an early day of the voyage, "Mr. Henry Crook, I believe?" Mr. Merrick
  paused, for there chanced to be two Crooks aboard.</p>

  <p>"Not Henry&mdash;Harvey Crook's my name. That other passenger is Mr. Henry
  Crook&mdash;a stranger to me; the stout man, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;jesso. Well, say, Mr. Harvey Crook, you've had a pretty
  advent'rous life, anyway, though it hasn't been so long a one as mine; a
  vurry advent'rous life, I'd say. Might a man ask what's your callin'
  anyway?"</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook laughed. "My trade," he said, "is&mdash;but I don't think it
  has any name of its own; unless you like to call me a carrier!"</p>

  <p>"A carrier, Mr. Crook?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, a carrier for profit, you might say. You see, I'm a man who's
  very much alone in the world, so far as relations go, and I've a great taste
  for moving about the earth in search of whatever may turn up. I don't need a
  great deal of money for that, but I need some, and, like other men, I like to
  have enough. My trade depends wholly on the fact that what may be cheap in
  one part of the world may be dear in another. So I buy in the cheapest market
  and sell in the dearest, according to the divine laws of Manchester. But I'm
  not always buying and selling, you understand, like a dealer&mdash;though
  perhaps that is what I am, after all. I am a specialist in things
  sufficiently profitable to make steady trading unnecessary&mdash;even
  impracticable. For instance, I have bought orchids in South America for
  shillings and sold them in London for hundreds of pounds. Though, of course,
  orchid-hunting is a pretty regular trade in the hands of some."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I've heard of that caper; and a good trade, too. So you're a
  judge of orchids, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Orchids and&mdash;other things. I was after orchids in South America when
  I got a rough diamond from an aborigine&mdash;a Botacudo, and a very shy sort
  they are, and treacherous&mdash;for a good, large hunting-knife. It wasn't a
  great diamond, you understand, but it was worth a few hundreds&mdash;pounds,
  you know, not dollars&mdash;and that was a good deal more than the knife
  cost&mdash;though it was a good one!"</p>

  <p>"I don't always bring things home to sell, of course; sometimes I take
  them out. I remember I once bought a very old Chinese manuscript roll in
  London for ten shillings, on speculation. I hadn't ghost of a notion what it
  was all about, I admit&mdash;I haven't now&mdash;and it was pure luck; but
  the next time I was in China&mdash;I got there as soon as I could after the
  relief of the Legation at Pekin, of course&mdash;I found some old pundit who
  made no difficulty in bringing out a thousand trade dollars for
  it&mdash;about a hundred pounds on the exchange&mdash;so that I've a
  suspicion it was worth a good bit more. And this trip to India, too, I took
  something. I found some absurd clockwork figures in Switzerland that a
  watchmaker had made to amuse himself&mdash;little dolls that walked about on
  a platform and bowed and fanned themselves, and struck the hour with their
  fists on a bell. They were a bit out of order and tarnished, but a very small
  job put that right, and I got my price, and a very good one it was, from a
  Maharajah. An Indian prince with money to spend is like a child for
  toys."</p>

  <p>"And are you bringing anything good back with you?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing of my own. There's something rather interesting
  belonging to another man, however; a dozen magnums of Tokay&mdash;the sweet
  Imperial, I believe, the real stuff, and most amazingly old."</p>

  <p>"Old?" queried Lyman W. Merrick, who had a proper respect for the antique.
  "What would you call old, now, in Imperial Tokay?"</p>

  <p>"The exact vintage of this I don't know," Crook answered; "but the owner
  tells me it's eighty years in bottle, and that's something very special in
  any wine, I think."</p>

  <p>"Eighty years! You don't say! And what might it have cost?"</p>

  <p>"That I can't tell you either. I believe he came on it very cheap in a
  deal&mdash;he's a dealer in everything, a man named Hahn. But he expects to
  get a hundred pounds for the case, or pretty near it."</p>

  <p>"That's very near eight and a half pounds a bottle, as I figure it.
  Forty-two dollars, any way; no bad price for a bottle of wine."</p>

  <p>"They're magnums, of course."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and Tokay isn't slopping around every day, even new, I guess. Come
  to think of it, I don't ever remember to have as much as seen a bottle of
  Tokay."</p>

  <p>"Very few have; and fewer still have tasted it. More, nine-tenths of the
  few who have tasted it&mdash;or think they have&mdash;have only tried the
  adulterated stuff expanded by the wine merchants from the inferior brands of
  Tokay."</p>

  <p>"Is that so!" commented Mr. Merrick, absently. Then he added, "Say, is
  that case of wine in the hold?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I've got it in my cabin. I don't carry much with me, as a
  rule&mdash;a good deal less than most people take for a week's
  journey&mdash;and so there was no difficulty."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick returned to the subject later. He had told his daughter of
  this case of the renowned and mysterious Imperial Tokay, and Daisy was all
  agog with the romance of the thing. Imperial Tokay was a thing she had read
  about, vaguely and mysteriously, but never seen&mdash;like wampum and bird's
  nest soup, and haunted houses. She had read of the wonderful first quality of
  this rare Hungarian wine, and of how it was the produce of the grape-juice
  exuded by the mere pressure of the piled weight of the ripe fruit itself; of
  how even the lower qualities were bought by great favour among a narrow
  circle of Hungarian notables, and of how throughout Europe the name and
  little else was known; and she longed to peep inside the case, and at the
  very least, gaze upon the venerable bottles.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Merrick referred to the Tokay again, he wanted to know how such a
  wine would be sold. "They'd scarcely put it up in one lot, would they?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;probably a bottle at a time, in the case of a great curiosity
  like this."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Harvey Crook, here is business. Your friend expects, with
  luck, to make an average eight pounds and a half a bottle out of this wine,
  selling them separately. Now I'm mighty cur'ous about this wine, and I offer
  ten pounds for a bottle&mdash;fifty dollars, right here! And we'll try the
  liquor together; there!"</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook shook his head. "Sorry," he said, "but can't do it, possibly.
  The wine isn't mine, and I'm under engagement to take it to England safely,
  and then do with it what the owner tells me."</p>

  <p>"But he's a dealer, and he only wants his money, I guess!"</p>

  <p>"Very likely, but that's his business," replied Crook. "Mine is to see it
  safely to England as it is."</p>

  <p>"I'll give fifteen pounds&mdash;seventy-five dollars. There!"</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook shook his head again, with a smile. "Very sorry," he said,
  "but I really can't! It isn't as though this stuff were mine, you see. It's
  given me in trust. No doubt Hahn would be ready enough to take the money, but
  he isn't here to do it. And of course I'd be glad to oblige you if I
  could&mdash;indeed I should much like to try the wine myself, as you so
  hospitably suggest&mdash;but I can't, you see!"</p>

  <p>The days went on, and by dint of having nothing to do but think about the
  Tokay, Lyman W. Merrick began to desire it more urgently than ever.</p>

  <p>"Come now, Mr. Harvey Crook," he exclaimed one long afternoon, "I'll
  speculate! I'll buy that case of wine for one thousand dollars! One thousand
  dollars is two hundred pounds of English money&mdash;just twice what the
  owner expected. I'll buy the case and we'll try a bottle; and if our
  curiosity's satisfied with that, I'll put up the other eleven to auction as
  soon as ever we get ashore, and just see what comes of the little gamble. Is
  it a deal?"</p>

  <p>This certainly seemed a more likely offer than the other. True, Crook had
  no authority to sell the wine, but he knew it was to be sold, and he had
  Hahn's word that he would be glad to take a hundred pounds for it. This was
  not an offer to break into the dozen, like the other, but one of double the
  dealer's price for the lot; yet Crook hesitated, in view of his
  instructions.</p>

  <p>That evening Daisy Merrick took the matter up, and Daisy was an extremely
  persuasive young lady. Her father was so awfully set on tasting real old
  Imperial Tokay for once in his life that it would be real mean for anybody on
  earth to thwart him. Surely Mr. Crook didn't want to be thought real mean?
  And the dealer with his wife and family&mdash;why, he would be real mad if he
  found that Mr. Crook had refused an offer of actually double his price.
  Surely Mr. Crook didn't want the poor dealer to be real mad?</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>That decided Harvey Crook&mdash;that argument and Miss Daisy Merrick's
  persuasions; though it is only fair to say that the argument gathered a deal
  of weight from what Crook remembered of Hahn and his habits of business. Hahn
  would do anything for a shade of extra profit, and the man who stood in the
  way of a deal which would give Hahn double price for anything would be Hahn's
  enemy for life. On the other hand, he pictured Hahn's delight on receiving
  that double price without turning a hand himself to get it. He was in charge
  of Hahn's interests in the matter of that case of wine, and he would be
  neglecting them to refuse such an offer as this. So he took the
  responsibility and the two hundred pounds, and the case of magnums of
  Imperial Tokay, eighty years at least in bottle and an indefinite number in
  wood beforehand, became the property of Lyman W. Merrick, of Merricksville,
  Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p>The case was taken into his cabin and the boards lifted from the top. Hahn
  had gone to a vast deal of trouble in packing, and there was a deal of
  sawdust and chips to be shifted before the muddy old seal of one of the big
  bottles showed itself. The bottle was carefully withdrawn, and the packing
  replaced, with another bottle, empty, to fill out the space.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-05.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>After dinner next day the bottle of Tokay was produced in full state. With
  great care the seal was removed and the soddened old cork withdrawn. The wine
  was of a fine rich green colour, sweet and curious; but both to Merrick and
  Crook it seemed to have suffered from over-age; though from the unfamiliarity
  of the wine it was not easy to be certain.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"
     name="pic6"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-06.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Mr. Merrick was hospitable with his precious wine, and two or three other
  passengers tried it and made their comments; and then the rest of the big
  bottle was carefully decanted.</p>

  <p>"Now if I was like some parties I've met," said Merrick, "I'd h' gone
  advertising myself with that wine, and playin' the coruscatin' millionaire,
  dealin' out all there is to the passengers, whether they wanted my blamed
  wine or not, and getting it in the papers when I go ashore. But that's not
  quite my style. Here's enough for a glass after dinner when I want it, or any
  friend of mine&mdash;though I must say, after all, I'd as well take a
  Chartreuse, or rather&mdash;and the rest goes into the sale-rooms, and then
  we'll just see how I come out for the bottle."</p>

  <p>So the voyage went, and as Southampton was neared, Mr. Merrick's interest
  began to be transferred from the case of Tokay to the tour before him, since
  this was his first visit to England. He and Daisy, between them, "fixed up" a
  most amazing programme, in which the British Isles, show places, scenery and
  everything, were to be got over at the rate of about two thousand square
  miles a day; so that in the end the auction was squeezed into the first few
  hours ashore at Southampton.</p>

  <p>And there, indeed, it took place, as soon as the wine could be got through
  the Customs, with a disastrous end to Lyman W. Merrick's little gamble. For
  the bottles, duly divided into eleven lots, were "starred" into the catalogue
  of the handiest sale, and would there have gone for a shilling or two apiece,
  were it not that some of the <i>Rajapur</i> passengers, who had heard of the
  speculation, turned up and bid for a bottle here and there; and a
  wine-merchant's traveller of some enterprise took four lots at ten shillings
  a lot.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"
     name="pic7"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-07.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>So that Mr. Merrick got back nearly five pounds of his two hundred, which,
  he said, would pay the duty, anyway, and leave him with the eternal glory of
  having consumed a bottle of wine costing nine hundred and seventy-five
  dollars. And with that consolation, such as it was, he and Daisy bade Harvey
  Crook good-bye.</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook had scarcely disposed his luggage in his rooms at Standish's
  Hotel, when he was brought a card which filled him with amazement, for it was
  the card of Mr. Frank Hahn.</p>

  <p>"Show him up," said Crook, in blank wonder.</p>

  <p>Hahn it was, sure enough.</p>

  <p>"Ha! My dear Crook," he exclaimed effusively, offering his hand, "how are
  you? You're surprised to see me, of course. But the fact is I pulled round so
  quickly that I was able to catch the mail-boat, and I came overland with the
  mails from Brindisi; so I've been in London some days, you see. I've been
  here to-day once before, and I've been to the docks&mdash;didn't know whether
  you'd get out at Southampton or come right on, you see. I'm eternally obliged
  to you, my dear chap, about the Tokay, you know, though as it turns out I
  needn't have bothered you after all. I'll clear it out of you way. Where is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't got it; it's sold."</p>

  <p>"Sold?" Such a look of blank horror fell across Hahn's face that Harvey
  Crook started where he stood. "Sold? What d'ye mean?"</p>

  <p>"I had a big offer for it on the voyage&mdash;double your best
  price&mdash;so of course I closed for you. Two hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"What! Two hundred pounds? Heavens,
  you&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;I&mdash;I'm ruined!"</p>

  <p>Hahn sank into a chair, white and gasping.</p>

  <p>"Ruined?" retorted Crook. "Skittles! You put the outside price at a
  hundred yourself!"</p>

  <p>Hahn sat starting and distraught.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I won't have it!" he said. "You&mdash;you're responsible!
  I&mdash;I demand my property&mdash;you're responsible, I tell you!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic8"
     name="pic8"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-08.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose I am," Crook replied, getting angry. "Very well, here's
  the money&mdash;the very notes I took for it; and now my responsibility is at
  an end. Two hundred. I took the stuff for you as a favour, when the most you
  hoped to get out of it was a hundred&mdash;for your wife and children, you
  remember; and I get you two hundred for it, and you howl about my
  responsibility!"</p>

  <p>"It's a robbery!" cried Hahn wildly. "A robbery! I want it back! You
  sha'n't do me like that!"</p>

  <p>"Get out before I do you with my boot!" Crook retorted angrily. "Get
  out!"</p>

  <p>"No, Crook&mdash;no, of course I didn't mean that. It ain't for me to call
  it a robbery, perhaps you think, but it was sharp practice, wasn't it now,
  Crook? It was sharp practice, and you're a deal cuter than I took you for,
  Crook. But come now, we can arrange this. I'll take you into it, and we'll
  see about it together. Do the fair thing with a pal, Crook. Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Where is it? All over the place by now. I sold it to an American on the
  boat, and we drank a bottle. Then he put the rest up to auction at
  Southampton, and it ought to be a consolation to you to know that it fetched
  about a fiver, all the eleven bottles. Take your money and clear
  out&mdash;I'm a bit tired of you."</p>

  <p>"Who sold it?" Hahn asked eagerly, gathering his faculties again. "Who was
  the auctioneer?"</p>

  <p>"A man named Lawson&mdash;up by the Memorial Hall."</p>

  <p>Hahn started up, seized the notes and took his hat. Then he paused and
  said, with a curiously intent expression, "You and the American tried a
  bottle. How did you find it? Anything unusual, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Old Tokay's always unusual, isn't it?" Crook answered. "It's a green
  wine, and very sweet."</p>

  <p>"And you emptied it, quite to the bottom?" Still Hahn regarded Crook with
  the same intent gaze.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;we decanted it."</p>

  <p>Hahn's steady look persisted for a few seconds and then he turned and
  hurried out.</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook sat mightily astonished for about ten minutes. Then he began
  to think the thing out. "Ruined&mdash;plenty for both&mdash;take me into
  it&mdash;anything unusual&mdash;what was he driving at?" he mused.</p>

  <p>Certain things were quite plain. This wine, the value of which Hahn had
  put at a hundred pounds, was clearly, for some mysterious reason or other,
  worth a very great deal more&mdash;to Hahn. Also, it was pretty obvious that
  Hahn's "touch of fever" at Delhi had been all a sham. Its object was not very
  difficult to divine. For some reason or another Hahn had wished to have that
  case of Tokay brought home by another person&mdash;wished it to be in some
  other person's possession even during the later part of his stay in
  India&mdash;and yet to be in perfectly safe keeping. Why, seeing that he
  regarded it as so valuable a possession? There could only be one reason for
  that&mdash;fear of the consequences if it were found in his possession. But
  why, again? He had bought or traded for the wine openly, it was plain, or he
  would not have talked of it so readily and unreservedly. From these
  considerations and from Hahn's unguarded expressions it became clear to
  Harvey Crook that there must have been something in that case more valuable
  than wine, however rare and costly.</p>

  <p>And with that a thought struck him like a bullet. The Eye of Goona!</p>

  <p>Hahn was notoriously quite a well-to-do man; that talk of the importance
  of a hundred pounds to his wife and family was pure gammon, as was very plain
  from his indifference to the two hundred the wine had fetched. The wife and
  family themselves were also gammon, probably. But the Eye of Goona&mdash;that
  would be a prize for the richest man alive.</p>

  <p>The notion seemed a trifle extravagant at first, but as he thought it out
  every consideration confirmed his suspicions. What else should Hahn be afraid
  to have in his belongings in Delhi? It would be a portable sort of thing,
  easily carried about in a waistcoat pocket, anywhere. But the hue and cry was
  up, and anybody might have been searched. More, the ways of Indian princes
  and their retainers were apt to be subtle and unconventional. If a thief
  could be got to creep undetected into a Rajah's guarded tent, another, who
  might also be an assassin, could be commissioned to get into a European
  dealer's quarters with the like secrecy.</p>

  <p>Then the obvious practicability of the thing was to be considered.
  Assuming, to begin with, that the stolen green diamond had found its way into
  Hahn's possession, what course of action could possibly be more natural than
  the one he had adopted? To carry it about with him among invisible emissaries
  of the Rajah, who might have unsuspected clues to its whereabouts, would have
  been to risk its loss&mdash;very probably to risk death. To hide it would be
  the obvious expedient&mdash;to hide it in some movable object which might go
  out of the country unsuspected. What more likely place of concealment than in
  a dark bottle of old wine? And here a significant fact presented itself. The
  Eye of Goona was of oval shape, and just a trifle more than an inch wide.
  That would never have passed the neck of an ordinary wine bottle&mdash;but
  these were magnums. The neck of a magnum would be large enough just to let
  such a jewel slip comfortably through. Then the cork might be replaced, the
  old seal carefully counterfeited, and all made snug in that innocent case of
  a dozen magnums.</p>

  <p>Plainly something of the sort had been done, and plainly the concealed
  object must be a jewel of some sort. What else of so great value could be
  kept in such a bottle? For if any one thing was certain in this astonishing
  business, it was that it was in a bottle, and not loose in the case, that the
  valuable object was concealed. Hahn's pointed inquiries as to the bottle that
  had been opened were sufficient assurance of that. And he had gone off in a
  hurry to find the auctioneer, and no doubt so trace the dispersed
  bottles.</p>

  <p>So much being assumed, and so much proved, Hahn's trick in putting on him
  the danger and responsibility of getting the plunder home was easy enough to
  understand. Hahn had shammed fever, but waited till he was safely off in the
  <i>Rajapur</i>, and then had hastened to get ahead of him by mail boat and
  overland route, to receive the prize safely in London.</p>

  <p>Everything pointed to the Eye. What other great jewel had been lost? And
  at any rate, Eye of Goona or not, the gem must be one of extraordinary value,
  from all the evidence. The exact circumstances of the robbery must still
  remain in some doubt; there was, at present, no telling how the jewel had
  reached Hahn's hands, nor what was the explanation of the dummy stone found
  in the hands of the slain thief. But putting these doubts aside for the
  moment, the bare fact seemed to emerge very clearly in Harvey Crook's mind;
  there was a jewel of fabulous value in one of those eleven bottles of wine,
  now dispersed by sale. Hahn had tricked him&mdash;had subjected him to the
  whole risk of transporting his plunder into safe quarters, and was not in
  agonised pursuit of that same plunder by way of the auctioneer. Harvey Crook
  resolved to join in the chase himself, and get ahead of Hahn if he could.</p>

  <p>"My trade," he thought to himself; "plainly it is in my trade. That rascal
  has stolen the stone, and if I can get hold of it, it should cost me very
  little here in England. But carried to India, it should bring a pretty
  handsome sum from the Rajah of Goona. I don't want the jewel, for it isn't
  mine. But neither is it Hahn's; and since I brought it here to please him, I
  see no reason why I shouldn't take it back to please myself&mdash;and the
  Rajah. Come&mdash;there should be a considerable amount of fun in it, as well
  as money!"</p>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>II. &mdash; MR. NORIE'S MAGNUM</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, January
  1904</h3>

  <p class="first">HARVEY CROOK pulled out his watch with one hand, and with
  the other he pressed the electric bell. In two minutes he was comparing his
  watch with the tables of a railway guide. There would be a train from
  Waterloo for Southampton at three precisely, and with any reasonable luck
  that train would enable him to reach the auctioneer's office before it closed
  at six. Twenty-five minutes was all he had to catch this train. And he
  realised that he must hurry. He sent the waiter for a hansom and selected a
  kit-bag from his luggage. In this bag he commonly kept all he needed for his
  immediate wants, and now a glance showed him that it was sufficient. He took
  out a carefully-tied roll rather less than two feet long, and glanced about
  him as if doubtful where to leave it. Finally he put it back in the bag. It
  was almost the only rarity&mdash;the only piece of stock&mdash;he happened to
  have with him, and it had originally come from China. For the moment he could
  not think of a suitable place in which to stow it, so, since it was a light
  matter enough, he resolved to carry it with him. Indeed, since, in a search
  after the Tokay, he would probably have to deal with persons interested in
  rarities, this particular article might serve as a convenient introduction,
  and, in any extreme event, possibly as an object of trade or barter.</p>

  <p>The waiter made a lucky choice with the hansom, and all fear of losing the
  train vanished in the first five minutes of the trot; though it was plain
  that every cab-rider at that moment was not so fortunate, for in Cranborne
  Street Crook passed another hansom which had come to grief. The cabman was
  unbuckling the traces from his fallen horse, while his unfortunate fare was
  desperately collecting a number of articles which had scattered from a burst
  portmanteau&mdash;a portmanteau that had evidently fallen endwise from the
  roof. The man looked up as Crook's cab passed a little gratified&mdash;to
  perceive that it was Hahn himself who was thus being delayed at the beginning
  of the race.</p>

  <p>Waterloo was gained with a margin of four minutes, and all was so far
  satisfactory&mdash;for Crook. Not so for Hahn, however, for as the train left
  the platform Crook saw him once again, running his hardest, with his broken
  portmanteau tied round with string, while a galloping porter ran at his heels
  to prevent him risking his life. The porter, having nothing to carry, ran the
  faster, and seized Hahn by the arms from behind; and Crook's last view of him
  comprised a heap, whereof the broken portmanteau formed the base, the zealous
  porter the apex, with the baffled Hahn sprawling between them.</p>

  <p>Having thus scored the first trick, Harvey Crook sat back well content.
  Two other men were in the carriage, both younger than himself, in animated
  conversation. For some while Crook paid no attention to this, but turned over
  the evening paper he had brought with him. Presently, however, he threw this
  aside, and then he could no longer avoid hearing.</p>

  <p>He had set the young men down as artists from the beginning, and now it
  grew plain that he had been right. One was a sculptor and the other a
  painter, and much of their talk had reference to another painter, familiarly
  referred to as "Charley." Charley, it would seem, was something of a
  practical wag&mdash;a character which Crook had himself met among painters
  more than once.</p>

  <p>"I'm a score behind with Charley," said the sculptor, "and I must make it
  even somehow. Did you hear about the awful row at my little show?"</p>

  <p>"Something about a drunken model, wasn't it? Tell me."</p>

  <p>"Drunken model? I believe you. But it was Charley that worked the thing.
  Ha! Ha! But it really wasn't so bad, while it lasted, though it gave awful
  jumps to some of my respected patrons. You should have been there."</p>

  <p>"Always keep out of show days&mdash;except my own. Can't help being there,
  you know."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I sympathise; the sort of people that go round on show Sundays
  and such&mdash;well there, that's enough&mdash;never mind 'em now. I was
  showing that thing of mine for the new park, open space, or whatever it
  is&mdash;you know, the alderman in his robes; that and the bust of the Mayor
  of Dumbledore. Well, all the friends of the alderman and the mayor turned up,
  as I expected they would, and they brought their sisters and their cousins,
  though I should judge that the larger part of the female visitors were
  aunts&mdash;fat ones. I did all I could to make things comfortable&mdash;not
  to say splendid. Hired a carpet and two dozen chairs, and got in the
  necessary tuck from the pastry-cook's. And I thought I'd have Boaler to wait,
  in an eighteenth century dress and wig. Know Boaler?"</p>

  <p>"Know of him; never employed him. Big model, for muscles and all that,
  isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"That's the fellow&mdash;an uncommon fine old chap for anything of that
  sort, though he is getting a trifle old and he drinks a lot. He's been posing
  to me for the Prehistoric Man I'm on for the next Academy, and mighty well he
  does it, with a bearskin hearthrug tied round him and a cow's jaw-bone in his
  hand. Well, you know, I thought he'd look rather fine in silk stockings and
  velvet breeches, with a gold-laced coat and a powdered wig, announcing people
  from the door and handing round a tray afterwards. And so he would&mdash;if
  he'd done it; but the old wretch didn't." Here the young sculptor flung
  himself back against the cushions with a burst of laughter.</p>

  <p>"I got a capital suit for him," he went on presently, "fitted
  excellently&mdash;borrowed it from Haslam. I impressed on him that he must be
  up to time&mdash;dressed and ready by half-past three. He promised he would,
  but he didn't." The sculptor laughed again.</p>

  <p>"He didn't," he repeated. "I had to go out, and didn't get back till
  nearly four. There was the gold-laced suit hanging up in the little room at
  the back, but Boaler wasn't in it&mdash;wasn't there at all, in fact. The
  result was I had to meet the people at the door myself, and skip the
  announcing. They came crowding in, and&mdash;well you know the sort of thing
  that happens on these occasions; women in fine dresses all doing the haughty
  and superfine, and the man the place belongs to doing the humble and
  complaisant. I kept looking and longing for the nefarious Boaler, but he
  didn't come, and I had to go dancing about with tea and macaroons, and try to
  do the whole thing myself. In the middle of the agony Charley came in.</p>

  <p>"'It's all right' he whispered, 'Boaler's here&mdash;I met him. He's gone
  in the back way and he's getting into his uniform. I'll go and hurry him up.'
  And off he went; and he did hurry him up!"</p>

  <p>"He did hurry him up. Lord! He did! The people had left off walking about,
  and all the two dozen chairs were full of supercilious old aldermanesses and
  mayoresses with tea-cups, when the inner door opened, and, with a shove from
  behind, in staggered the infamous Boaler, full as a barrel, in the uniform of
  prehistoric man, bear-skin rug and cow's jawbone complete! And
  worse&mdash;while he waved the jawbone in one hand he carried a pewter pot in
  the other, and a clay pipe in his mouth, and he smiled and smiled and swayed
  and swayed till he came down in a heap! Heavens! The row! The mayoresses and
  the aldermanesses and the haughty and the superfine! It beat everything!"</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"Broke up the show, of course."</p>

  <p>"Broke it up? Broke up's too mild a term. I never saw anything like it;
  the place might have been on fire! They're the sort of people that never see
  the humour of anything, and because I laughed&mdash;who wouldn't?&mdash;I
  believe they thought I'd done the whole thing on purpose!"</p>

  <p>"And it was Charley, was it?"</p>

  <p>"Chiefly, though certainly Boaler himself gave him the idea. You see, the
  old ruffian had given way to his usual failing, and when he began to change,
  by force of habit he got into the prehistoric rig instead of the proper
  dress. Charley, going in to hurry him up, found him like that and rather
  liked the idea, so he added the pipe and pot by way of final touches and
  shoved him into the studio. Says he intended it as a lesson for Boaler
  against the sin of intemperance! Tells me I ought to be nearly as grateful as
  Boaler himself, because it was such a fine preliminary advertisement for the
  Prehistoric Man at the Academy!"</p>

  <p>The two young men laughed loud and long, and lit their pipes; and then
  their talk drifted off into more immediately professional matters. And so two
  hours more went, and at last the train pulled up at Southampton.</p>

  <p>It was a little late&mdash;more than a quarter of an hour late, in
  fact&mdash;and Crook had only a few minutes in which to reach the office of
  Lawson the auctioneer. He got a fly, but it crawled as that sort of fly does,
  and the clocks had finished striking six ere the office drew in sight.
  Lawson's clerk, in fact, was in the act of locking the front door, and when
  he turned away he met Harvey Crook as he jumped from the fly.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," said Crook; "I'm afraid I'm a bit late. I want to ask
  about a few lots you sold last Thursday."</p>

  <p>The clerk looked uncomfortably up the street.</p>

  <p>"I've shut the office," he said. "Can't you come in the morning?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it's past office hours," Crook replied; "but I suppose you're
  open to do work on your own account after office hours? Suppose we say at a
  guinea an hour?"</p>

  <p>The clerk opened his eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," he said, "I should think so; at a guinea an hour." But there
  was a deal of doubt in his voice.</p>

  <p>"That's what I mean," answered Crook, "and here's a guinea in advance for
  the first hour, though I shan't keep you so long."</p>

  <p>And he handed over a sovereign and a shilling.</p>

  <p>"Well," the clerk answered, still rather distrustfully, "what is it you
  want me to do? Nothing against the office interests, mind!"</p>

  <p>"Of course not&mdash;nothing at all. Mr. Lawson would do it himself if he
  were here, but he isn't. In Thursday's sale there were eleven magnums of
  Tokay wine, put in by a travelling American gentleman named Merrick. I want
  to know who bought them."</p>

  <p>"Let's see," said the clerk thoughtfully. "They were 'starred' into the
  catalogue, weren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Mr. Merrick only brought them in on the morning of sale."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can tell you one buyer from memory. That was Mr. Norie, the
  artist. He had one bottle."</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;everybody about here knows him; his father belonged to
  Southampton."</p>

  <p>"And the others?"</p>

  <p>"That won't be so easy. You see, they were mostly bids for money down from
  strangers, and the buyers took them straight away. But come into the
  office."</p>

  <p>The clerk pulled out his key again, and unlocked the door. He was a quick
  young man with dark little eyes, and a smiling, though not handsome, face. He
  carefully shut the door behind him, pushed up the lid of a desk, and brought
  out an inter-leaved and marked catalogue.</p>

  <p>"Mind you," he said, "I'm not doing any more than we'd do for almost
  anybody who came and asked&mdash;in office hours. I'm not doing anything that
  Lawson would disapprove of, and I won't. Here you are. Lot 87 star, one
  magnum real old Imperial Tokay, reputed eighty years in bottle. Lot 88 star,
  ditto; lot 89 star, ditto; and so on to lot 97 star, ditto, the last of 'em.
  There's prices and all: 87 star, money paid down, no name; 88 star,
  Smith-might as well be no name at all; 89 star, Smith also&mdash;and Smith's
  the name to the next two."</p>

  <p>Crook remembered those lots, and he knew that they were all bought by the
  same Smith&mdash;the wine merchant's traveller. But he said nothing, and the
  clerk went on.</p>

  <p>"Ninety-two star is Allen, eight shillings."</p>

  <p>Allen was a passenger on the "<i>Rajapur</i>," Crook remembered, though
  again he said nothing. This would give him another advantage over Hahn.</p>

  <p>"Ninety-three star, no name, money paid. By the way, you know," the clerk
  pursued, "all the money was paid down for these lots, as I can tell by the
  ticks, but some people gave their names and some didn't. Ninety-four
  star&mdash;that was Mr. Norie's. He took it away with him under his arm."</p>

  <p>"An artist, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but if you're thinking of buying of him&mdash;was that what you
  wanted?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes; that was it."</p>

  <p>"Well I don't suppose he'll sell. He isn't poor, although he's an artist,
  and he buys things for his own fancy. He bought an old pair of candlesticks
  at the same sale, and took them away, too, in his pocket."</p>

  <p>"Very well. He lives here, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I'll show you the way, if you like. He has rooms in London,
  too, but his studio's here. Ninety-five star is Curtice, ten shillings; and
  the last two have no names."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;that'll do. And now where is Mr. Norie's studio?"</p>

  <p>The clerk shut his desk and came into the street again, carefully locking
  the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Keep along past the bend in the road," he said, "till the road forks, and
  then keep to the right. The road will lead you out of the town past some new
  villas with a row of old trees&mdash;elms&mdash;in front of them. In the
  middle of the villas there is a short turning&mdash;a lane&mdash;and the only
  house in that turning is Mr. Norie's studio, just behind the villas."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Harvey Crook, as he turned to go. "And now perhaps
  you'll give me your private address. If I have anything else for you&mdash;on
  the same terms&mdash;I suppose you won't mind my calling and saying so,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. My name's Symons, and 14, Waterview Terrace is my address. Is
  that all?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, at present. Will you be at home all the evening?"</p>

  <p>"At home! Oh yes, I shall be at home if you want me. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>Crook returned to his fly and drove to the Royal Hotel for dinner. This he
  took at once, and then made the best of his way to Mr. Norie's studio.</p>

  <p>It was still light, though the dusk of a summer's evening was visible in
  the west. The next train from London had been in some little time, and it was
  reasonable to suppose that Hahn was now in Southampton. What would he do? The
  auctioneer's office was shut; probably he would have to be content with his
  dinner for that evening's work.</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook walked smartly in the direction of the villas with the row of
  elms before them, and was not long in getting clear of the town. He passed a
  market garden or two and a small meadow, and so reached the elms and the
  villas they shadowed. There was no possibility of mistake in the matter of
  Mr. Norie's studio&mdash;there it stood, as the auctioneer's clerk had said,
  alone in the little lane that divided the villas into two rows.</p>

  <p>It looked as though it might be a good studio. There was a long, sloping
  roof on the north side, with a row of skylights, and roomy-looking blocks on
  the opposite side that seemed to be comfortable living and sleeping rooms.
  There was nothing but a door in the front wall of the studio, and that wall
  extended left and right to make a boundary for a little garden. Harvey Crook
  knocked at the door.</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He repeated the knock, louder, and after a minute or
  two more discovered a bell, and knocked and rang furiously. It grew plain
  that Mr. Norie was out.</p>

  <p>Now it would never do to go back without another attempt. There was a
  chance&mdash;eleven to one against, certainly, but that is no bad chance as
  things go&mdash;that the Eye of Goona itself lay in that modest little brick
  building. Hahn was in Southampton, and by aid of judicious inquiry he might
  learn of the situation of this particular magnum of Tokay at any minute. He
  might even contrive to get hold of Norie himself in some club or
  billiard-room in the town. Harvey Crook resolved to watch the building all
  night, if necessary.</p>

  <p>Beyond the villas the road rose on a hill, which overlooked the studio and
  the town beyond. Crook went on up the hill, turning an occasional glance back
  toward the studio as he went. Dusk was dimming the outlines of the town and
  the water beyond, and lights twinkled in greater numbers from moment to
  moment. Turning to look at the studio once again, he clearly descried some
  dark object moving before the white frame of the skylight. What was this?
  Burglary? Could it be possible that Hahn was taking this short cut to the
  bottle of Tokay? He hurried down the hill at top speed.</p>

  <p>He turned the corner by the villas, and approached the studio by springing
  strides on tip-toe. Plainly enough in the half-light he could see not one,
  but two men, mounting the skylight, the hindmost man with his leg hanging
  over the boundary wall. This was lucky. What better introduction to the owner
  than to seize burglars as they were entering the place? Busy at their work,
  the man seized the dangling leg with both hands.</p>

  <p><a id="pic10"
     name="pic10"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-10.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>There was a hasty exclamation from above, and the owner of the leg made a
  quick grab at the skylight frame to save himself from falling. "Who's that?"
  he cried indignantly, peering back over his shoulder. "What are you
  after?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if it comes to that," replied Crook, holding on his tightest, "who
  are you and what are you after?" Though, indeed, he rather fancied he
  recognised the voice.</p>

  <p>The man on the wall changed hands, turned round and peered down closer.
  "Why, hullo!" he said. "Don't I know you somewhere?" And Crook thought it
  very likely, for he recognised one of the young men who had travelled with
  him in the train.</p>

  <p>"Have you come to see Charlie Norie?" continued the young man on the wall;
  "because he's out."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have. But you don't expect I'm going away leaving two men breaking
  into his house, do you? Just because one of the burglars tells me he's
  out?"</p>

  <p>The young man burst into a grin. "I say, Jack," he called to his
  companion, who seemed to be half-way in the skylight, "he thinks we're
  burglars!"</p>

  <p>There was a stifled laugh from the direction of the skylight, and another
  head came poking over the shoulder of the man whose leg Crook was
  grasping.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said the head; "it's only a bit of a plant on Charley."
  And by the voice Crook knew that the head belong to the young sculptor of
  Prehistoric Man.</p>

  <p>"Look here," the sculptor went on, after a moment's pause, "you come in
  yourself, if you want to see it's all right. We're both friends of
  Charley's&mdash;just as much as you are. We're only chalking up a score on
  him!"</p>

  <p>The thing was plain enough now. This Norie, who had bought the magnum of
  Tokay, was the Charley of the railway-carriage conversation, and the raid now
  in progress was by way of reprisal for the Boaler outrage. An idea struck
  Harvey Crook.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "I'll come. You drop in through the skylight, or
  we'll be attracting attention." And with that he released the other's
  leg.</p>

  <p>The sculptor dropped through the skylight and struck a match within, and
  his companion, after giving Crook a hand up, speedily followed.</p>

  <p>"What were you thinking of doing?" asked Crook, when they were all three
  safe on the studio floor.</p>

  <p>"Well, we didn't quite know," replied Jack, the sculptor, looking about
  him after striking a light. "We rather trusted to what we might find, not
  having been down here for some time. By the way&mdash;I say, you know, you're
  the man that came down in the same carriage!"</p>

  <p>"Quite right&mdash;I know! And I didn't let on. But I wasn't to know you
  meant the same Charley, was I? But don't waste time, or he'll be back.
  There's one sell I can put you up to. He's just bought a magnum of old
  Imperial Tokay."</p>

  <p>"Imperial Tokay? Exorbitant sybarite! Come, that certainly ought not to be
  allowed. A whole magnum of real Tokay for Charley Norie, while far more
  deserving persons like ourselves have never even smelt the divine tipple! As
  freeborn Britons we must see into this. Come, I know where he keeps his
  liquor, anyhow!"</p>

  <p>The studio was handsomely furnished, though somewhat sparsely. Jack made
  straight for a fine old Dutch standing cupboard close by the door, wide and
  high, with a pair of large painted doors. He swung the doors open and
  disclosed many shelves of many bottles, intermingled with glasses and
  soda-syphons. Conspicuous among them all, lying on its side because of its
  height, was the magnum of Tokay. Crook picked it up and passed it to the
  others.</p>

  <p>"There it is," he said simply.</p>

  <p>Jack Knowles regarded it thoughtfully. "Problem is," he said, "to open it
  without ruining the seal. Not that the seal isn't pretty well ruined
  already." And, indeed, the old yellow seal was cracked and rubbed out of all
  distinctive shape.</p>

  <p>"Not difficult," observed Crook, taking the bottle back. "I'll try. We can
  make it all right with a lighted match if you want to shut it up afterward.
  Do you?"</p>

  <p>"I think," remarked Jack Knowles, sagely, "that the obvious course
  dictated by justice and humanity is that we remove from our dear friend's
  reach&mdash;from this bottle, in fact&mdash;the temptation to excessive
  drinking which has proved so fatal in the case of the unhappy Boaler. I will
  undertake to find two or three empty bottles in which the removal may be
  accomplished&mdash;he always keeps 'em on the bottom shelf. This being
  effected, in order to prevent the shock our dear friend might experience on
  discovering his great bottle absolutely empty, we will proceed to fill it up
  with a judicious admixture of more wholesome but less expensive liquors
  selected from the other bottles in this cupboard. Vinegar, for instance, and
  rum, with a little sauterne to give it paleness, and a modicum of mustard to
  give it body. Then, when our friend has been disgusted with his luxurious
  indulgence by taking a sample, we will restore him to a proper frame of mind
  by inviting him to our rooms, to try our real old Imperial Tokay! I think
  that's the proper&mdash;not to say the moral&mdash;course?"</p>

  <p>His friend assented heartily, and Crook proceeded to remove the cork with
  great care to avoid breaking it up. He had already, with a sharp, broad blade
  of his pocket-knife, cut away the top of the seal in a single slice, and
  carefully laid it aside. With a little humouring the old cork came away
  whole, though with a bad crack across it; and now Crook stood with the opened
  bottle in his hand, and a rather ticklish task before him. Whether or not
  that bottle contained the Green Eye of Goona would be decided in a few
  minutes&mdash;seconds, rather; and it was his task to ascertain the fact
  without the knowledge of the two rattle-brained humorists before him, both
  with their eyes intently fixed on that big bottle, with never a suspicion in
  the world of what an enormous matter it might carry in its depths.</p>

  <p>"Steady!" he said; "this wine has been in bottle eighty years, as I happen
  to know. It would be a pity to run the risk of spoiling it in the decanting.
  You are much too mercurial for the job. My hand is particularly
  steady&mdash;you rout out the empty bottles and bring them."</p>

  <p>In a moment a bottle was thrust into his hand. He turned evenly towards
  the light and slowly elevated the bottle between his eye and the gas-jet.
  Holding it by the neck, he very slowly and steadily tilted the magnum till
  its lip clinked on the lip of the smaller bottle, and the precious liquid
  began to trickle from one to the other. In this position if the great green
  stone came rolling toward the mouth of the magnum he would probably be able
  to see it through the dark glass of the neck, where both glass and wine were
  thinner.</p>

  <p><a id="pic11"
     name="pic11"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-11.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Slowly and steadily the green wine rose in the small bottle till it
  reached the neck. Crook ceased pouring and held it out. "Another bottle!" he
  demanded, keeping the magnum still tilted in the air. "Cork that one
  carefully&mdash;don't shake it!"</p>

  <p>A second bottle was thrust into his left hand, and again he began to pour,
  slowly and warily. Nothing chinked in the magnum, nothing came sliding into
  the tapering neck to check the free flow of the wine. Probably it would not
  till the magnum was nearly emptied. So the second bottle was filled.</p>

  <p>"Another!" cried Crook. "This will about empty it, I think. There should
  be a trifle under half-a-gallon."</p>

  <p>And still he kept his eye fixed on the dim light that came through the
  neck of the magnum.</p>

  <p>The wine rose gradually in the third bottle, and when it was about half
  full Crook cast his eye back along the magnum. At this angle, he judged, the
  jewel must come rolling forward now, if it were there at all. Still, he would
  rather it kept back till the bottle could be emptied. Higher and higher it
  went, and higher the wine rose in the small bottle, till at last the dregs
  ran out, and the third bottle was full. The thing was settled; the Eye of
  Goona was not there. "Here you are," remarked Crook, calmly; "that's the lot.
  Mark that third bottle&mdash;you must let it stand longer than the others.
  I'm afraid I poured a trifle too far, and there's sediment in it. Now select
  your varied poisons."</p>

  <p>The young men turned to the cupboard, and Crook took the occasion to make
  assurance doubly sure. He up-ended the empty magnum on his palm and shook it,
  then lifted it to the light again and shook it once more. There was no doubt
  of it; no diamond was there.</p>

  <p>"Come," cried Jack Knowles, impatiently, "we've wasted too much time
  already&mdash;we mustn't bother too much about what goes into the empty
  bottle; that would be pampering Charley, and running risks ourselves. This is
  vinegar, anyhow, by the label, and here is a spoonful of mustard and some
  rum. There are plenty of other liquids here, and we'll leave the rest to
  luck&mdash;Charley's luck is always wonderful. In it all goes. Thoughtful of
  him to provide a funnel, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>In it all went, indeed, and the old cork was forced down over the horrible
  mixture. After which the seal was carefully replaced and melted down at the
  cut edges with a match.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Jack Knowles, when the magnum had been replaced where it
  had been found, "we will away. We did think of standing his lay-figure
  against the police station and getting it locked up as drunk and incapable,
  but we mustn't disturb anything now&mdash;that would arouse unworthy
  suspicions. We will away, and do our awaying without a moment's delay. Up
  through the skylight, Sewell! Quick, before I turn out the light."</p>

  <p>They left the studio as they had entered it, one at a time through the
  window, and Jack Knowles, coming last, handed out the three bottles with
  loving care. Then the skylight was shut down, and they all stood in the open
  lane.</p>

  <p>"Beautiful arrangement, those skylights," commented Jack Knowles. "Perfect
  dispensation of Providence for a burglar. Easy to get at, and nothing to hold
  'em down but the brass arm, which Charley never fastens. Some day he will
  positively be robbed!"</p>

  <p>Crook, having ascertained the direction in which the others were going,
  instantly discovered that he must go the opposite way. And so he waited in
  the dark a little way beyond the elms, while the two young fellows went off
  laughing toward the town.</p>

  <p>"Lucky they never thought of asking my name," he thought to himself.
  "Well, here's an end to the prospects of that magnum, at any rate, so far as
  I'm concerned. But there's no reason why it shouldn't occupy Hahn's attention
  for a bit longer&mdash;it would give me a start for the next. I think I'll
  see that auctioneer's clerk again before I go to bed."</p>

  <p>So that as soon as the two friends were quite out of sight and hearing he
  set off for Waterview Terrace. He found it to be a row of neat little houses
  with gardens in front, and he was saved any trouble in making a quest for No.
  14 by observing Symons, in his shirtsleeves, with a lantern, industriously
  hunting for snails in his garden.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you, is it, sir?" said Symons when he had ascertained his visitor's
  identity. "I'm on a snail-hunt; the only way to keep 'em down is to go for
  them after dark. What is it now?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take up a little more of your out-of-office time, if you
  don't mind, on the usual terms. It's private."</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;I'll come and take a turn along the terrace, if you don't
  mind the shirtsleeves." And Mr. Symons put down his lantern and came out of
  his little green gate.</p>

  <p>"About those magnums of Tokay, now," said Crook, as they walked along
  before the little gardens. "I want to buy them all; and I want to enlist your
  help. Never mind about Mr. Norie's&mdash;I've been there. But if you can get
  hold of any of the others I'll pay you five pounds a bottle for them, cash on
  the nail."</p>

  <p>"Whew! You must be very fond of that wine?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;yes; as a collector, you see. I want to collect that lot. But
  there's another collector in the field, and it's that I came to speak about.
  I expect he'll be round to the office first thing in the morning."</p>

  <p>"Um!" said Symons. "Of course I can't break office rules."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't want you to do it. You can tell him what the office
  records show&mdash;which is precious little. More, you can tell him about Mr.
  Norie, and give him his address&mdash;I want you to do it, in fact; he can't
  get the bottle, and it will delay him. Understand?"</p>

  <p>"I think I do. I'll tell him all about Mr. Norie; but I'll give him as
  little about the other things as I can manage; always with due regard to
  office rules, of course."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I see you understand. And to make things plainer, I'll tell
  you this. Not only will I give you five pounds for any bottle of that lot you
  may bring me, but I'll pay you five for every one I can get myself, with your
  aid. That's satisfactory, I hope?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Symons' quick little eyes positively sparkled amid the darkness.
  "Satisfactory?" he said. "Rather! Handsome&mdash;handsome, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, I hope I shall see you again soon. Meantime, to carry
  out the principle of cash in advance, here's a fiver for the first magnum,
  and I chance whether we get it or not!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Charles Norie, painter of marine subjects, was a tall young man of
  wide shoulders and rather handsome, but more good-humoured, face. He was not
  dependent on his work for his livelihood, for his father, who had been a
  shipbuilder at Southampton, had left him quite a decent competence. His
  friends, Jack Knowles the sculptor and Harry Sewell the painter, had also
  connections in or about Southampton, and had come down for a week or two's
  holiday. Norie was in the habit of walking down into the town to take his
  dinner at an hotel, and his friends had taken advantage of this habit to raid
  his studio in his absence. But on the night following they all three dined
  together at the Dolphin, with another friend, one Kirk, a young surgeon of
  the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>"No," interposed Norie, when dinner was finished, "don't have
  liqueurs&mdash;I've got a treat for you at the studio. I picked up a magnum
  of real old Imperial Tokay the other day, at a sale down here. Never saw a
  bottle before in my life. We'll light up cigars and stroll along to the
  studio and open it. They tell me it's eighty years old, and you mustn't go
  spoiling your mouths with liqueurs first."</p>

  <p>Jack Knowles and Harry Sewell chuckled inwardly, and avoided each other's
  eyes for fear of open laughter.</p>

  <p>"That's a rarity," observed Kirk. "How did it come here?"</p>

  <p>"Some fellow brought it ashore from a P. &amp; O. boat, I believe, and put
  it in a sale at Lawson's. I shouldn't have known of it but I went in after a
  pair of Sheffield candlesticks&mdash;I'll show 'em to you presently, they're
  capital. There were eleven magnums of Tokay, and I wish I'd bought more now,
  for it seems they were dirt cheap. I've had a fellow after mine to-day,
  offering a tenner for it, and almost begging me to take his money; and it
  only cost me half-a-sovereign!"</p>

  <p>"I'd have taken it," remarked the practical Jack Knowles; not without an
  inward chuckle at the remembrance of what the speculator would have got for
  his money. "Was he a dealer?"</p>

  <p>"Some sort of chap of that sort, I think. Name of Hahn. Half German, or
  all German, I should judge, though he spoke English wonderfully. He's been
  absolutely pestering me all the morning, and I very nearly had to kick him
  out. And then he came prowling about again when I had gone out, the charwoman
  tells me, and she almost had to kick him out. But anyhow, come along and try
  it. We'll call for Fields on the way&mdash;and Castle, if we can find him
  in."</p>

  <p>The party set out forthwith, Norie and Kirk walking in front, and Knowles
  and Sewell, bursting with hilarious anticipation, behind them. Castle was
  out, and so was abandoned to his fate, but Field was found, and made up the
  party of five. And so the five, puffing their cigars in comfortable
  expectation&mdash;though of different things&mdash;left the lighted streets
  and took the dark road out towards the studio.</p>

  <p>They reached and passed the first group of villas and turned into the
  lane; and, as they did so, Norie was startled to observe his skylight
  suddenly lit up from within.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Look at that! And the end skylight's open! Hooray! Burglars at
  last!"</p>

  <p>And he sprang off at a run, feeling for his key as he went, with the rest
  at his heels.</p>

  <p>Jack Knowles sprang on the boundary wall to cut off retreat by the
  skylight, and Norie turned the key and flung open the door in a single
  movement. There was a bang and a scramble within, and there hung the
  terrified Hahn, by the frame of the open skylight, struggling to climb out,
  with one foot on a chair below, while above him appeared the grinning face of
  Jack Knowles!</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"Hullo, Misder Hahn! Don't you got no petter vays to gollect your vines as
  dis?" cried Norie, with a vile attempt at a German accent. "Gom down dere,
  Misder Hahn!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, forgive me, Mr. Norie, sir!" the captive pleaded, almost at a
  whisper, his mouth dry with terror. "I have done nothing, nothing at all,
  really!&mdash;and I will pay anything&mdash;anything you like! I will!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you said that this morning, you know," replied Norie. "But in
  mine guntry you bays six months hard for into oder beeble's houses glimbing,
  Mister Hahn, don't id? Sit down on der floors mit yoursels, Mister Hahn,
  while I my friends entertain."</p>

  <p>"Come now," Norie went on to the rest of the company, "here's more
  amusement than I expected to be able to give you. We'll resolve ourselves
  into a committee to sit on Mr. Hahn, before Mr. Hahn goes to sit in Black
  Maria. But first the drinks."</p>

  <p>Norie went to the cupboard and brought out the magnum, and then the
  glasses. Knowles and Sewell, with a joyful hope of what this new complication
  might bring forth, laughed loud and along, now that the burglar's plight gave
  some excuse for their hilarity.</p>

  <p>Norie drew the cork in a broken mass, and began pouring the stuff into the
  glasses.</p>

  <p>"Come along, you fellows," cried Norie, hospitably. "Catch hold, and we'll
  drink Mr. Hahn's very good health, hoping the treadmill will do his liver
  good."</p>

  <p>Knowles and Sewell discreetly procrastinated, but Norie, Fields, and Kirk,
  suspecting nothing, took simultaneous gulps, and instantly went in a jostling
  rush for the fireplace, spitting and splurting the horrible mixture over the
  hearth. Knowles and Sewell shrieked aloud.</p>

  <p><a id="pic13"
     name="pic13"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-13.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Heavens! What abomination is this?" roared Norie; and as he said it his
  eye fell on the cowering Hahn. "Oh!" he cried, the wrong explanation dawning
  on him suddenly, "this is your game, is it? Eh? Where's my bottle? What have
  you done with the bottle you changed this for, eh?"</p>

  <p>Hahn protested and pleaded, vowing he had made no exchange, and that the
  bottle then before them was the one Norie had bought.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Norie, with judicial decision. "Then in that case, since
  you were so anxious to buy it, you shall have some for nothing&mdash;in a
  mug. Jack&mdash;give me that quart jug out of the cupboard!"</p>

  <p>The mug was brought, and filled to the brim, and since the miserable Hahn
  would not take it at Norie's polite invitation, he was seized from behind by
  the elbows, and the riotous mixture of vinegar, rum, mustard, salad oil, and
  other fluids was poured into his mouth, over his face and down his neck.</p>

  <p>But through it all, Hahn's mind was never far from the cause of his
  presence in Norie's studio. It struck him that Norie must have emptied the
  magnum, and perhaps found the jewel. So as soon as the mug was emptied, and
  he was momentarily released, he staggered to Norie's side and whispered
  hoarsely, "Share it and I won't say anything! You know what I could do, but
  if you'll go halves I'll say nothing about it!"</p>

  <p>"Go halves?" cried the amazed Norie. "He says he wants to go halves! Why,
  you can have the lot, and welcome! Jack, give him some more Tokay!"</p>

  <p>And he got some more. And straightway, on the motion of Jack Knowles, he
  was hauled into the street and started on the way to the police-station. The
  actual distance might have been a mile and a quarter, but the distance for
  Hahn was made one of galloping leagues, by reason of his captors, taking
  turns in pairs, rushing him up and down the road at top speed before them, as
  an instalment of prison exercise in advance.</p>

  <p>So his torture endured, till at last, in the lighted streets, Knowles and
  Sewell had charge of him well ahead of the rest, and not far from the
  police-station. They, knowing the secret of the "Tokay," were inclined to be
  merciful.</p>

  <p>And so they let him go at the next corner, with a shove and a view halloa,
  which brought the rest of the party on their heels.</p>

  <p>"Gone away!" cried Jack Knowles. "But if you'll come to my place I'll give
  you a glass of Tokay that I prefer even to yours, Norie. Come along!"</p>

  <p>And Harvey Crook, on his way to call on Symons at Waterview Terrace,
  stepped aside a moment as a panting fugitive hurried past him, and then stood
  to let pass a laughing group of young men, among whose voices he clearly
  recognised two, which were joined in a promise to the rest that the real
  Tokay should repair all the disappointments of the evening.</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>III. &mdash; MR. CLIFTON'S MAGNUM</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, February
  1904</h3>

  <p class="first">ON the evening when Hahn suffered at the hands of Mr. Norie
  and his friends, Mr. Symons, the auctioneer's clerk, looked out eagerly from
  his garden gate in Waterview Terrace, in expectation of a visit from Mr.
  Harvey Crook.</p>

  <p>He was a business-like young man, this Symons, destined, no doubt, to a
  future partnership with his present employer. The business was growing, and
  more than once Symons had stopped at the opposite side of the road to judge
  the effect which large gilt letters would give to the style and title,
  "Lawson and Symons," on the office window; and no doubt it would have been a
  great improvement to that same window. Meantime the assiduous Symons lost no
  opportunity of business, and his pleasures were few and cheap. The slaughter
  of snails in his little front garden and an occasional air on the flute could
  not be called expensive amusements, even by the very businesslike and frugal
  wife who abetted his ambitions. And among the opportunities of business which
  he was resolved not to lose, this opportunity brought him by Harvey Crook was
  chiefly occupying his attention just now. Something had occurred to his mind
  during the day, and that something had led to cogitation and inquiry; and the
  sum of it was that he sent a note to Crook's hotel, to ask him to call at
  Waterview Terrace in the evening. And there he stood at the garden gate in
  the dark, looking out.</p>

  <p>Crook came, a few minutes late.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, sir," said Symons. "Would you like to step inside? My
  wife's out."</p>

  <p>"Ah," replied Crook, "that sounds ungallant, now. I should have been
  delighted to make Mrs. Symons's acquaintance. As it is, perhaps the terrace
  would be as pleasant a place as anywhere&mdash;since we are to talk
  business."</p>

  <p>For Crook had no desire to take risks, even remote risks, and a listening
  little maid-of-all-work was as likely a part of Mr. Symons' household
  equipment as anything.</p>

  <p>"It can't be called a cold night," he added.</p>

  <p>"Very well," Symons responded, "I don't mind. Of course you'll understand
  I haven't told the wife anything about this affair."</p>

  <p>Symons was one of those men who always speak of <i>the</i> wife; it is a
  particular sort of man, quite easy to recognise after a little
  experience.</p>

  <p>"No?" replied Crook. "Don't talk to her of business matters, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;in a general way; but not in detail. She doesn't want it, you
  see. She has plenty of detail of her own to look after. I may tell her about
  this after it's all over, but not till then."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps that will be best. I got your note. Have you had that other
  collector round at the office yet?"</p>

  <p>"Rather!" Mr. Symons chuckled joyously. "Foreigner, I should think, but
  talks wonderful English. Found him waiting at the door when I got there in
  the morning. He wanted particulars of the sale of those magnums of Tokay, of
  course, just as you did. I pulled out the marked catalogue, as in duty bound,
  and told him what there was in it&mdash;which wasn't much good to him, as you
  know. And then, as a special favour, I told him that I happened to know,
  privately, the address of one buyer, and I gave him Mr. Norie's."</p>

  <p>"Did that satisfy him?"</p>

  <p>"Satisfy him? Well, I hardly know; but he rushed out of the office without
  another word, and when I got to the street door to look after him he was very
  nearly at the corner&mdash;going to Mr. Norie's!"</p>

  <p>"Well, he won't be very successful there, I expect. But was that all you
  wanted to tell me? Or have you got some of the magnums for me?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not quite that. But I've found out who has one. It's old Mr.
  Clifton."</p>

  <p>"And who is he?"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;of course you wouldn't know, not living hereabout. He's a queer
  old card&mdash;a regular collector and a rare hermit. I'm pretty sure he
  won't sell, any more than Mr. Norie would. He buys things often
  enough&mdash;books and pictures, and china and bronzes to any amount, but I
  never heard of him selling anything yet. He had one bottle&mdash; No. 96 star
  in the catalogue, one of those I put no name to. He usually pays cash."</p>

  <p>"And you remembered the circumstance to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, in a sort of way. Thinking it over, I had a kind of recollection
  that a porter got into trouble with one buyer through trying to be obliging
  and rolling up his bottle in a curious, dirty old hanging picture he'd bought
  earlier in the sale&mdash;Japanese, I think, or Chinese. A
  kick&mdash;kack&mdash;I forget what it is called."</p>

  <p>"Kakemono?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's it. A dusty old thing with a tarnished gold brocade
  border&mdash;figure of a god or something, brown with age and smoke. You see
  the porters are always anxious to see to Mr. Clifton's lots of him, because
  he's always good for a handsome tip for any little service of that sort. But
  this unlucky chap got a rare rating&mdash;though I must say the picture was
  dirty and ragged enough already, and most people wouldn't have given two
  pence for it."</p>

  <p>"That's quite possible&mdash;and yet Mr. Clifton may have got a prize.
  Rolled up in my bag at this moment there is another old kakemono which you
  wouldn't buy for a hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir? Well, remembering what I tell you, I turned up the marked
  catalogue and found that it was Mr. Clifton who had bought the kakemono. It
  was rather odd I didn't remember that, because he is often in at the sales.
  But if you are clerk of the sale you have to keep your wits on your work, and
  you easily forget little things like that. But the porter remembered at once
  when I spoke to him."</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Clifton a very keen buyer of rare wines?"</p>

  <p>"Well-no, I haven't noticed that he is. But books&mdash;rare
  ones&mdash;china, bronzes, all things of that sort he is keen on. I have
  never been in his house&mdash;nobody has, scarcely&mdash;but they say it's
  piled from floor to ceiling, and still he goes on buying. Japanese and
  Chinese things he's very great on, they say. We don't have a great deal of
  that sort of stuff through our hands, of course, but whenever we catalogue a
  single piece he's always down to look at it. Now, as I said, I don't think
  he's at all likely to sell anything he has once bought, but I'll write and
  ask him about that magnum of Tokay, if you like."</p>

  <p>"No," Crook replied very decidedly, "you'd better not do that. That is the
  very worst way in the world to approach a man of that sort. I think the
  kakemono I have will be the bet possible introduction to Mr. Clifton. Where
  does he live?"</p>

  <p>"The name of the house is Downs Lodge&mdash;if you've got a pocket-book or
  anything, I'll write the address down for you. That's the name of the house,
  but you won't see it stuck up anywhere. He took down the name as soon as he
  came to the house, years ago&mdash;he'll go to any lengths for privacy." Mr.
  Symons laughed suddenly. "By Jove," he added, "you'll see that by the
  windows&mdash;you wouldn't think the house was inhabited at all!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Dirt&mdash;dirt half an inch thick. That game began about seven or eight
  years ago. You see when he took Downs Lodge&mdash;bought it, in fact&mdash;it
  stood all alone in the lane. There were fields opposite, fields behind, and
  fields on each side, and that suited his solitary notions. It isn't a very
  big house, but still it is of a pretty decent size, and it's planted much
  nearer the roadway than you usually see so large a house, except in the
  middle of a town. He was quite happy in his solitude, till, as I say, about
  seven or eight years ago, when somebody bought the field opposite and built a
  row of villas on it, and then he got very angry. Wanted to buy the villas and
  pull 'em down, but the chap wouldn't sell. So the old gentleman, swearing he
  wouldn't be pried on, gave orders that the windows weren't to be cleaned any
  more&mdash;at any rate outside&mdash;and they haven't been. Take a good look
  at the windows if you go, just for curiosity. They are a curiosity, I can
  assure you. You'd never believe such a lot of dirt could gather on a window
  and stick there, unless it was slapped on with a trowel. It's a licker where
  it all came from! It must be pretty dark inside, but nobody can see in,
  that's certain enough. And doesn't it just scandalise the villa residents,
  too. So mighty genteel! Quite destroys the 'select' character of the spot,
  they say!" And Mr. Symons laughed again.</p>

  <p>Crook and the auctioneer's clerk walked a few yards in silence. "I think I
  know just the sort of old gentleman Mr. Clifton is," Crook remarked, at
  length. "Now I'd wager with all this desire for solitude, and all his other
  eccentricities, he's a very pleasant old fellow to speak to?"</p>

  <p>"If you did, sir, you'd win. He's a real old gentleman&mdash;when he isn't
  put out. Very dignified&mdash;very&mdash;but treats even the office boy as
  courteously as you please. Even when he let out at the porter for rolling up
  the bottle in the picture he didn't slang him, you know&mdash;not a bit; but
  the poor chap looked as though he'd like to be safely in his grave!"</p>

  <p>"Not married, I take it&mdash;remembering the dirty windows?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no&mdash;or, at any rate, got no wife living. No, there's nobody in
  the house beside himself but an old cook-housekeeper and one housemaid to
  help her."</p>

  <p>"Very good&mdash;I'll send him a note to-night, by hand. Mind, if that
  other collector calls he isn't to have this address&mdash;at any rate, not
  till I've done with it. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, of course not. He shall have no more than he's got already.
  Good-night!"</p>

  <p>This was Harvey Crook's note to Mr. Clifton, despatched by messenger
  immediately after his return to the Royal Hotel:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;I am staying for
  a few days in Southampton, and I have chanced to hear that you are much
  interested in Oriental art, and a collector of fine specimens. I am only
  lately from the East, and I happen to have with me now a very fine and rare
  specimen which I think you would like to see. It is a kakemono, an authentic
  piece of work of the great Chinese painter of the eleventh century, Muh Ki,
  usually called by Europeans Mokkei, that being, as you are aware, the
  Japanese form of the name. I cannot say whether or not any other specimen of
  Mokkei's work exists in Europe, but I should think probably not. In any case,
  if you would care to inspect it I shall be very glad to show it you, and, if
  you like, bring it to your house for that purpose. I suggest this because I
  think it probable that you may have copies of Mokkei's works in your
  possession&mdash;even good copies being greatly prized, as, of course, you
  know&mdash;and may like to compare them. But if you would prefer to come to
  my hotel I will gladly keep any appointment you may make. I am, dear sir,
  yours faithfully,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Harvey Crook</span>.</p><br>

  <p>It was past nine o'clock when the messenger set out with this letter, but
  the distance was not great, and he was back in an hour&mdash;with an
  answer:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;I am, indeed,
  your debtor for so welcome a piece of kindness as that you offer. I have
  never with my own eyes beheld an original piece of work from the hand of the
  divine genius Mokkei, though, as you conjecture, I have in my collection
  several copies of works of his executed by eminent Chinese and Japanese
  painters of later days, reverent followers of his great traditions; and I
  have seen photographs. I need scarcely say that I shall hail the opportunity
  of actually seeing and handling Mokkei's work with delight and with gratitude
  to yourself. Is the picture certified in any way?</p>

  <p class="letter">I trust I am not treading on delicate ground, but if you
  should at any time think of disposing of the specimen, I should much esteem
  an opportunity of possessing so great a prize. If I am indiscreet in
  suggesting this, I trust you will pardon the natural eagerness of an ardent
  collector.</p>

  <p class="letter">Your conjecture that there may not be another specimen of
  Mokkei's work in Europe is near to being correct, but not quite. There is one
  picture in a private collection in this country, but I have never had an
  opportunity of seeing it, though I am told it is very fine.</p>

  <p class="letter">How long do you stay in Southampton? I am prevented from
  seeing you early to-morrow, but if you can conveniently call here at
  half-past six I shall be delighted to welcome you. As you suppose, I should
  greatly desire to compare the Mokkei with my copies, and this is my excuse
  for troubling you, instead of waiting on you myself, as I should have been so
  glad to do. Perhaps you will let me have a note in course of to-morrow,
  telling me if I may expect you.</p>

  <p class="letter">Renewing my thanks for your kindness, I am, dear sir, yours
  very truly,</p>

  <p class="letter">Basil Clifton.</p><br>

  <p>So much was very satisfactory, and Harvey Crook slept with the
  consciousness that he had done all that prudence would allow to bring him to
  the third magnum of Tokay and its possibly priceless contents. The chances,
  of course, were increasing with each magnum. The eleven to one chance against
  the Eye of Goona being in the bottle opened on the <i>Rajapur</i> had been
  decided in favour of the odds, and the one chance in eleven&mdash;ten to one
  against&mdash;in the case of Mr. Norie's magnum had also failed to come off.
  The chances now, in regard to Mr. Clifton's magnum, were nine to one against,
  which was no such desperate chance after all. But the thing would have to be
  done with a great deal of care. Mr. Clifton would probably be in a far calmer
  mood than were the two wild young artists, Knowles and Sewell, the night
  before. More, he would be a punctilious host, which would make a vast
  difference.</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook despatched his note accepting Mr. Clifton's invitation early
  the next morning. Mr. Clifton had said nothing about dinner, but doubtless
  there would be dinner, and for a moment Crook wondered whether or not the old
  collector would expect him to dress. Perhaps not, since the time fixed was so
  early; and in any case the matter settled itself, for Crook had brought no
  dress clothes.</p>

  <p>He kept within walls for the best part of the day, since Hahn must be
  somewhere in the neighbourhood, and he saw no reason for giving that
  speculator notice that his erstwhile tool was a rival in the hunt. He heard
  of Hahn, nevertheless, for in the lunch-hour Symons came to the hotel to
  report that he had called at the office again.</p>

  <p>"He looked a bit used up," Symons observed; "a bit pale and wild, and he
  seemed to walk stiffly. He wanted to see the marked catalogue again, so I put
  on the slightly offended. 'I thought I showed it to you yesterday,' I said.
  'But you can see it again, of course, if you like. Hadn't you better take a
  copy this time?' He said he would, and he did. Then he began to pester me for
  addresses again. 'I told you the only one I knew yesterday,' I said. 'That
  was Mr. Norie's. Do you want that again?' But no, he didn't want
  that&mdash;the mention of it seemed to give him a sort of jump; I don't know
  why. So I said, 'Well, the only other names are Smith, Allen, and Curtice,
  and I don't know their addresses. You can find Smiths all over the town if
  you want 'em, and there's an Allen I can give you the address of, though
  whether it's the right one or not I can't say.' So I gave him the address of
  the only Allen I know&mdash;not the buyer, of course&mdash;and he rushed off
  <i>there</i>. I expect he'll have a warm reception. Allen's generally mad
  drunk, and always thinks a stranger is a bailiff!"</p>

  <p>As the time neared for starting, Harvey Crook took from his hit-bag the
  carefully-tied roll which he had brought from London with him, and spread it
  out on the table before him. It was an ancient and much-damaged piece of
  silk, so carefully mended and reinforced between itself and its tough paper
  backing that it presented a perfect network of innumerable patches when held
  to the light. The silk was brown with age, but on it, in Chinese ink,
  appeared a perfectly startling representation of a wild goose, flying, with
  outstretched neck, over a bed of rushes wherein its mate stood. The whole
  thing was done in a few bold sweeps of the brush, but, notwithstanding its
  faded condition and the many mendings of the nine-hundred-year-old silk, the
  picture gave a most amazing impression of life, vigour, and movement, and
  affected the mind like some living presence.</p>

  <p>Crook dusted it carefully and re-rolled it, folding in its outer turn,
  where the bordering brocade came, the ancient paper certificate of
  authenticity. Having done which, he sent for a cab.</p>

  <p>The cab took the same way that Crook had taken on his walk to Norie's
  studio, two nights before, as far as the fork in the road. There it turned
  off to the left, and ran some little way among groups of small houses
  separated by gardens and an occasional field, before it took another turn and
  pulled up.</p>

  <p>Crook stepped out, and found himself before a detached house of moderate
  size, standing scarcely a dozen yards back from its front railings and the
  road. Such small part of the garden as was visible seemed to be in very bad
  order; but what gave the house its distinctive look&mdash;and a very desolate
  look it was&mdash;were the windows. Truly Symons had not exaggerated, and it
  would have been difficult to believe that the house was inhabited were it not
  that the doorsteps, the door, the knocker, and its other fittings were clean
  and bright, in almost uncanny contrast to the rest of the
  house-front&mdash;like a smiling eye in a dead face.</p>

  <p>Crook paid his fare, pushed through the iron gate, which creaked aloud,
  mounted the steps, and placed his hand on the bell-pull. He did not ring, for
  at that moment the door opened.</p>

  <p>The contrast of the door with the grimy windows was more than maintained
  by the hall. It was large, and clean, and cheerful, furnished with old oak,
  and spread with a Persian rug. On the rug stood a thin, grizzled man of about
  fifty five, bowing and smiling.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr. Crook?" asked the smiling man, extending his hand. "I
  am Mr. Clifton. I heard your cab, and I came to the door myself. Pray come
  in. My housekeeper, unfortunately, is just taken rather unwell, and the
  housemaid, my only other servant, has her evening out. Let me take your hat.
  The absence of the housemaid, I fear, is wholly due to my own carelessness. I
  said nothing to my housekeeper about your visit till an hour ago, when the
  housemaid was already gone. But no doubt you will pardon any little
  inconvenience&mdash;you are so very kind to come. And is this the precious
  parcel?"</p>

  <p>It was growing dark outside, and here in the hall a lamp was necessary. It
  had been already lighted when Crook entered, and now his host took it up and
  led the way past the staircase end.</p>

  <p>"The library is rather in confusion, and I fear the fire is out," he said.
  "I think we shall be more comfortable in the dining-room. There is just one
  step here&mdash;be careful."</p>

  <p>Everywhere the house was most handsomely furnished, and the walls were
  hung close and thick with pictures. The dining-room looked large and sombre
  in the single light of the lamp, but very speedily candles were lit on the
  mantelpiece, and in a large chandelier, and a very handsome room was
  disclosed. A set of early Georgian chairs, with elegantly carved backs, stood
  about a many-legged dining table of the same period, and elsewhere the room
  was a medley of books, pictures, and bric-a-brac.</p>

  <p>"It's really almost the only decently-habitable room I have," said the
  master of the house, as he set down the lamp at last. "True, there is
  confusion enough here; but in the other rooms a stranger could not step
  without causing some terrible damage."</p>

  <p>"I have heard that your collections are very large," Crook remarked.</p>

  <p>"Enormous! Enormous&mdash;I mean, of course, for the size of the house.
  And all in the most admired disorder, I give you my word, Mr. Crook. You may
  observe that I say 'admired disorder' and not 'admired confusion,' as the
  words are so commonly misquoted. I cannot bear to hear a classic misused. But
  there, that is not our business to-night, after all! I need not say I am all
  impatience to see the&mdash;ah&mdash;the specimen!"</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook took the wrappings from his precious roll and spread out the
  ancient picture tenderly on the polished table. Looking up suddenly as he did
  so, he was not a little surprised to note that his host's eyes, instead of
  being directed eagerly on the spread silk, were turned toward the door of the
  room, rather with the expression of a man who intently listens than that of
  one who looks.</p>

  <p>"There it is, Mr. Clifton," Crook said; "and this is the certificate I had
  with it."</p>

  <p>The other's eyes came quickly back to the table. "Ah, precisely," he said.
  "Precisely. A very wonderful and interesting specimen, to be sure. And the
  certificate also&mdash;Chinese, I see. I am really infinitely obliged to you,
  Mr. Crook&mdash;quite infinitely obliged to you."</p>

  <p>This connoisseur's manner puzzled Harvey Crook. Where was the passionate
  enthusiasm, the delighted wonder, that Mr. Clifton's letter had led him to
  expect as a matter of course? The words were the polite words of one who is
  expected to admire something that fails to interest him; though certainly
  they were delivered with much emphasis and a tone of great warmth.</p>

  <p>"I got it in China," Crook explained, "at Soochow. It was an exchange for
  some manuscript that I knew I couldn't sell anywhere else. A Japanese expert
  thought a vast deal of it. You know, of course, that in Japan the work of the
  ancient Chinese painters is more highly prized than in China itself."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? Oh yes, of course&mdash;yes, certainly, so it is. Very
  extraordinary, isn't it? You know I can't tell you how immensely obliged I am
  to you for showing me this, Mr. Crook, really!"</p>

  <p>"You mentioned some copies you had, which you wished to compare.
  Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;of course, so I did. I had almost forgotten. We'll
  just&mdash;what was that?"</p>

  <p>He stood stock still, his face pallid, his palm raised, his eyes directed
  toward the door, listening intently. There was a faint stir somewhere in the
  house&mdash;below.</p>

  <p>"It must be the cat," he said, with an obvious effort. "Yes, the cat must
  have come in. Will you excuse me for one moment? I feel sure it was the
  cat."</p>

  <p>He took the lamp and went out. Truly this rusty, grizzled man was a great
  oddity, a person of curious moods. All the enthusiasm of yesterday seemed to
  have vanished, and even his memory of his own letter seemed defective. Crook
  wondered how best he might bring the conversation to the matter of the Tokay.
  As yet nothing had been said about dinner&mdash;a thing which might give
  opportunities.</p>

  <p>The grey man was gone for some little time, and returned at last with a
  more composed countenance.</p>

  <p>"It was the cat," he said, "as I supposed. You were
  saying&mdash;something&mdash;oh yes, something about my copies. Well now, I
  think we shall find them somewhere in the drawing-room&mdash;or what would be
  the drawing-room, if I kept such a place. Will you come? Perhaps you will
  bring the&mdash;the specimen with you."</p>

  <p>He took up the lamp once more, and Crook followed him with the old
  kakemono. The drawing-room was large, and far fuller of
  everything&mdash;furniture, pictures, china, bronzes&mdash;than the
  dining-room. The grey man turned to a large cabinet, and pulled open its
  doors.</p>

  <p>"Unlocked, fortunately," he said. "As a matter of fact I was having a
  little hunt for my keys when you arrived, and I am particularly anxious to
  find them soon, for other reasons. Here are the&mdash;well, the specimens,
  you know."</p>

  <p>The cabinet drawers were full of rolled pictures, Chinese and Japanese,
  and the grey man wandered among them, unrolling first one and then another,
  but never coming upon anything that might be considered a copy of Mokkei.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid my things are in sad confusion," he said. "Though, of course,
  this is nothing to the confusion I should suffer from if I kept more
  servants. I find it a great advantage to keep the establishment so low that
  they have barely time to do the necessary work of the household, without
  interfering with my beloved litter. But the windows are a sad affliction to
  my excellent housekeeper! You noticed the windows? Of course you
  did&mdash;everybody does. By the by, speaking of my housekeeper, if you will
  pardon me once more, I should much like to see how the worthy soul is getting
  on. She has these little attacks sometimes, but she usually recovers before
  long. Do you mind? Perhaps you can amuse yourself with the&mdash;specimens
  till I return."</p>

  <p>He was gone a little longer this time. The carpets were soft, but Crook's
  ears were sharp, and he fancied that his host had gone no farther than to a
  door a few yards away.</p>

  <p>As Crook sat and waited in the dimly-lit room, a large black cat came
  purring in at the door, stared at him full-eyed for some few moments, and
  then retreated behind a pile of portfolios. Just then there was a sound from
  some neighbouring room&mdash;slight, but noticeable in that still house. It
  might have been the sound of a breaking stick.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately the smiling grey man came back.</p>

  <p>"I really must beg a thousand pardons," he said. "But you understand my
  awkward situation, don't you? The poor old soul is a little better, but still
  far from well. You didn't hear any unusual noise, did you?"</p>

  <p>Crook was beginning to answer when a shadow crossed the door-opening at
  the grey man's side, and he turned with a gasp of terror.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what's that?" he exclaimed, almost in a whisper. "The
  cat&mdash;it <i>is</i> the cat!"</p>

  <p>And, indeed, it was the cat, which, encouraged to emerge from its retreat
  by his more familiar presence, had approached him from behind. The grey man
  seized one of the precious rolls of painted silk and struck savagely at the
  creature, which dodged and turned and sprang off into the dark corridor. The
  grey man turned to Crook again.</p>

  <p>"I am growing sadly nervous of late," he said, "and a very little thing
  affect me. You must forgive my little eccentricities. I was speaking of my
  housekeeper&mdash;the good soul insisted that something must be done to offer
  you refreshment. I have to ask your pardon for so many things to-night that I
  am sure you will overlook any shortcomings in this respect. There is a cold
  fowl in the larder, and if you will return to the dining-room I think I will
  do myself the pleasure of acting host and waiter together."</p>

  <p>It seemed that this odd person had already ceased to be interested in the
  painting which Crook had brought, so now nothing remained but to approach the
  matter of the Tokay, just as dinner might give the opportunity. So Crook made
  the feeblest possible protest that common politeness would permit, and
  followed his host back into the dining-room.</p>

  <p>There he sat in the brilliant light of the many candles while the grey man
  carried the lamp to and fro between dining-room and kitchen, and so set
  before him the materials of a very decent cold dinner.</p>

  <p>"As to wine now," asked the grey man presently, "what are your
  preferences? I think I can give you almost anything you may fancy, including
  some exceptionally rare vintages. I do not collect wines with the same
  assiduity which I devote to other things, but I have had some pieces of luck
  now and again."</p>

  <p>Here was an opportunity. "Yes," assented Crook, "I heard of one such piece
  of luck when I was told of your liking for oriental art. They told me that
  you bought a kakemono at Lawson's the other day, and at the same sale were
  lucky enough to secure one magnum of very old Imperial Tokay."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;the Tokay!" The grey man's eyes lighted up as from the
  sudden suggestion of a valuable idea. "The Tokay! How lucky you should remind
  me. We will open it, Mr. Crook. Come, I will bring it at once!"</p>

  <p>Here was another curious thing. This connoisseur of Eastern art, yesterday
  learned and enthusiastic on the subject of ancient Chinese paintings and
  to-day almost ignorant of them, careful even to avoid their very names, was
  now betraying a curious ignorance as a connoisseur of wines. For who would
  think of drinking old Imperial Tokay with his food, instead of after? But
  Brook had his object to gain, and was not disposed to be critical.</p>

  <p>Presently his new acquaintance returned with the magnum&mdash;not carrying
  it tenderly at a proper slope, as one who understood wines, but grasping it
  upright by the neck.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," he said, putting it down on the table with a jar that would
  have torn the nerves of a true judge of old wines; "and since it pleases you,
  I am sorry I did not get more, for it was quite cheap."</p>

  <p>He took a corkscrew from the sideboard, and essayed to open the bottle.
  But now Crook was surprised to perceive that his hands, steady enough for
  less exact work, were trembling so that he stabbed seal and corkscrew
  together half-a-dozen times without hitting the centre.</p>

  <p>"Let me try," suggested Crook, jumping at the opportunity. "My hands are
  particularly steady, and an old wine like this needs especially careful
  handling."</p>

  <p>His host yielded bottle and corkscrew gladly, and crook saw that the seal
  was old and dirty and quite unbroken. He screwed and pulled the tender old
  cork with the greatest care, and just managed to fetch it away entire, though
  crumbling.</p>

  <p>"Such an old cork needs a very steady hand," Crook said. "Have you some
  spare decanters?"</p>

  <p>Decanters were found, and here, in far different circumstances, Crook
  began to repeat his performance of two nights ago in Norie's studio. He
  turned his back towards where the grey man was sitting, lifted the magnum to
  the light, and poured slowly.</p>

  <p>The decanters were fairly large, and two sufficed to hold the contents of
  the magnum. Steadily, slowly, Crook filled the first, and saw no sign of the
  great jewel that was leading his quest. Slowly and steadily he filled the
  second, watching and watching, and no Green Eye came to the neck. The matter
  was settled. The Green Eye of Goona was not in Mr. Clifton's magnum.</p>

  <p>Crook put the second decanter on the table, and turned to make the best of
  his dinner. He found a large hock glass by his plate, and no other.</p>

  <p>"This is indeed a generous glass for Tokay," he said, and half filled
  it.</p>

  <p>Indeed the wine was far too sweet for a dinner wine, but Crook made the
  best of it. Surely no man would be so ungracious as to grumble at this lavish
  use of so noble and rare a liquor in his honour, and Crook, his turn served
  and his work done, applied himself to the meal. His freakish host was
  agreeable and sedulous, though through it and with it all Crook felt the
  discomfort of some off prepossession, some inexplicable constraint. Truly
  this was an odd fellow, and for all his politeness, in some strange way not
  altogether an agreeable fellow.</p>

  <p>"Bless me!" he exclaimed presently, "I thought I had remembered
  everything, but I observe I have forgotten the cheese. Odd I should have
  forgotten the cheese! I have a Stilton of which I really think you will
  approve." He rose and turned about, and then added suddenly, "No, no, I am
  wrong&mdash;here it is on the console table. Come, I hope you will like the
  Stilton. Meantime, as I do not take cheese, is it asking too much to beg you
  to excuse me once more? I am really anxious about that good soul, my
  housekeeper. Pray do not spare the wine."</p>

  <p>Again Crook was left alone, and he turned to the cheese, which was, in
  fact, excellent. The house was still&mdash;curiously still. But as he sat he
  presently heard again that same slight cracking noise, as of a stick or some
  wooden thing broken and splintered, away in some far room, behind thick doors
  and curtains. And in a few minutes more the sound was repeated.</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook sat in solitude, sipping his wine and listening for the
  return of his host. But the silence of that strange house was unbroken. Once
  he fancied he heard a slight creak from the outer gate&mdash;possible caused
  by the wind.</p>

  <p>Presently the black cat came in, cautiously, tentatively, waiting for a
  moment to gaze hard at him from the door, and so judge of what reception to
  expect. Crook took a fragment from his plate to tempt the animal, and it
  came, cautiously still, stood a yard away, and mewed. Crook dropped the
  fragment, and the cat ate it and came closer.</p>

  <p>Still he sat solitary, and there was no sound from end to end of the
  house. Some of the candles began to gutter down, and he rose and blew these
  out. The cat followed him.</p>

  <p>It began to grow late. What should he do? Politeness dictated that he
  should wait for his host, but everything earthly has its limit. He stood and
  looked at a picture on the wall, and the cat rubbed against his legs,
  purring.</p>

  <p>The picture hung on the wall opposite the door, which stood ajar. Crook
  fancied some cold waft of wind from without, walked to the door, opened it,
  and peered into the dark beyond. The cat came after him again, purring.</p>

  <p>The house beyond the dining-room was black and silent, but a cool fresh
  wind came along the corridor as though an outer door were open. Should he do
  anything to remind his host of his presence? If the housekeeper were worse,
  perhaps he might be of use, to call a doctor, or the like. He ventured a loud
  cough.</p>

  <p>The sound went through the house with startling clearness, and through the
  tense quiet a dozen tiny echoes came whispering back. But that was all.</p>

  <p>He stepped into the corridor, and pronounced aloud the name of the master
  of the house; and again there was no answer but the whispering echoes.</p>

  <p>He returned to the dining-room and took a candle from the mantelpiece.
  Right or wrong, he would see what this thing meant.</p>

  <p>Candle in hand, he strode along the corridor, the cat trotting at his
  heels. As he came into the hall, his light met a gust of air which nearly
  blew it out. The front door was open!</p>

  <p>He pushed it to, stood by the stair-foot and called aloud, "Mr. Clifton!
  Mr. Clifton!" And again the house gave back no living voice.</p>

  <p>Behind the main staircase a smaller staircase descended, half hidden by a
  curtain which seemed to have lately been partly torn from its rings. The torn
  curtain thus having taken his eye, Crook stepped toward it and descended the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>It was a short flight, for the basement floor was low-ceiled. At the
  bottom he could see the kitchen door, half shut, and jammed against some
  indistinct object&mdash;a bundle of clothes, perhaps&mdash;on the floor.</p>

  <p>Crook held the light aloft and pushed the door wide open, and there lay
  the bundle of clothes&mdash;a woman; a stout, neatly-dressed woman with her
  head beaten out of human recognition!</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"
     name="pic14"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-14.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>What was this&mdash;the housekeeper? The housekeeper of whose welfare her
  master had been so solicitous? The cat looked up from between Crook's legs
  and mewed plaintively.</p>

  <p>He turned and dashed up the stairs, for it came on him overwhelmingly that
  this was not the bottom of the mystery. He pushed open one door and another,
  and found all dark and silent. Then a third, and light streamed
  out&mdash;lamplight and firelight: the library.</p>

  <p>Books&mdash;the books were everywhere, from floor to ceiling and over the
  floor. But to Harvey Crook's eyes the room seemed even less full of books
  than of blood&mdash;dripping, sticking, smeared, and ghastly. And in the
  midst of it all, lolling horribly in a chair, from which only the table's
  edge kept him from sliding, was a man, a handsome, white-haired old man,
  dabbled and terrible, with his head back, and a fearful gash across his
  throat.</p>

  <p>A small safe, let into the wall, was standing open, and the little iron
  drawers from within it were tumbled on the floor. Across the room stood a
  writing-table, of which all the drawers but two had been forced open; and, as
  he saw this, Crook remembered the cracking noises he had heard, and
  remembered how the grey man had complained of the loss of his keys. While
  here, he knew now, lay Mr. Basil Clifton, dead in his blood, while he, Crook,
  had been sitting at table with his murderer!</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook ran out at the front door, and beat at the knockers of the
  villas opposite. What followed he never afterwards remembered with much
  distinctness. Women fainted, men were white in the face, and after a time
  there was a returning servant girl, hysterical and screaming. Then the police
  came, and he was told that for the present he must consider himself in
  custody; and that cleared his faculties. Harvey Crook's arrest was not a long
  one, and after certain explanations and an hour or two's detention he was
  allowed to return to his hotel, though he had more than a suspicion that he
  was still under observation. But at the inquest the whole matter was made
  plain, partly by the testimony of the housemaid, partly by other evidence.
  The vanished murderer was one James Pritchard, a friend of Mr. Clifton's in
  early youth. In middle life affairs had gone ill with him, he had made
  efforts to repair them in which the practice of forgery was involved, and
  penal servitude was his punishment. Mr. Clifton had strongly upheld his
  innocence, and, now that he was released, had begun to employ him temporarily
  to catalogue his library, while some more permanent employment might be
  looked for; and this was the end of it all. The ungrateful wretch had
  murdered his benefactor and the housekeeper, the only other person in the
  place, for the sake of whatever he might find in the safe.</p>

  <p>It was not so very much, after all&mdash;sixty or seventy pounds in notes
  and gold, so far as could be ascertained. It became plain that the crime must
  have been committed just before Harvey Crook's arrival, and that it was only
  on turning over his victim's paper that the murderer learned that Crook was
  expected, and became acquainted with the reason of his call. Before he cold
  find the keys with which the safe might be opened Crook arrived, and in order
  to gain time to gather his plunder unmolested, Pritchard had adopted the
  expedient of himself posing as Mr. Clifton. Harvey Crook was young, strong,
  and alert, or possibly the wretch might have made a further attempt on him.
  As it was he contrived to escape from his guest's company from time to time,
  break open the drawers of the writing-table till he had found the safe keys,
  and at last decamp with what plunder he could secure. It turned out,
  afterward, that the keys which would have enabled him to open the
  writing-table without trouble were in a pocket of a waistcoat of Mr.
  Clifton's hanging under a heap of other clothes in a press in his
  dressing-room.</p>

  <p>So much Harvey Crook learned, with the rest of the world, at the inquest.
  But he had not learned all, nor even all that concerned himself and his
  search.</p>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE STEWARD'S MAGNUM&mdash;AND ANOTHER</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, March 1904</h3>

  <p class="first">SO far we have followed Harvey Crook in his quest of the
  scattered magnums of Tokay and what some one of them might contain beside the
  wine. We now return to the scatterer of those magnums&mdash;Mr. Lyman W.
  Merrick, of Merricksville, Pennsylvania&mdash;and his daughter Daisy.</p>

  <p>When he&mdash;and his daughter, quite as important as her father in other
  beside his own fatherly eyes&mdash;had bid goodbye to Harvey Crook; when the
  sale was over, and Mr. Merrick had calculated that his one bottle of Tokay
  had cost him nine hundred and seventy-five dollars, while he had sold eleven
  other bottles at two or three dollars apiece; and when he had slept over the
  adventure, father and daughter spent a day in seeing what could be seen in
  the time from Southampton&mdash;Portsmouth and the <i>Victory</i> in
  particular. And at the end of that day they dined together in a private room
  of the hotel which was to cater for their one remaining night in
  Southampton.</p>

  <p>Somehow, it was not an extremely lively dinner. In point of fact both were
  a little dull. It is possible that Mr. Merrick somewhat regretted the Tokay.
  He was lavish enough with his money, but he had a considerable dislike to
  looking foolish, and he had something more than a vague idea that he looked a
  little foolish over this transaction of the wine&mdash;at any rate to
  himself. He rather wished, now, that he had kept it. There would have been
  drawbacks, of course. A great case of a dozen magnums of precious wine would
  have been a sad encumbrance in the pursuit of the express-rate tour which he
  and Daisy designed for themselves; there would have been constant anxiety as
  to breakages&mdash;and probably there would have been the actual breakages
  also. Still, he wished he had kept, at any rate, a single magnum for himself,
  and put some sort of reserve price on the rest.</p>

  <p>As for Daisy, she also was a trifle less vivacious than usual. Perhaps
  when one has been in daily acquaintance with a few pleasant people in the
  narrow confines of a steamship for best part of a month, it is a little
  depressing to lose them all suddenly, and find oneself in an hotel where
  everybody is strange; perhaps one is none the less dull when one of the
  friends who have gone is a pleasant and entertaining man of
  thirty-five&mdash;Harvey Crook was entertaining and pleasant; also
  thirty-five. Thirty-five is quite young, nowadays, for a man. Not that that
  mattered, of course. Why should it?</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick alluded to the subject of his own thoughts; Daisy said nothing
  about the subject of hers. Coffee was brought, and Mr. Merrick lit a
  cigar.</p>

  <p>"Well, Daisy," he said, "I guess I shall have to do without a glass of
  Tokay this time."</p>

  <p>"Are you only just beginning to regret your speculation, father?" asked
  Daisy. You will observe that, although she was an American young lady, she
  did not say "popper," or "pop," or "paw." That was because she had a sense of
  humour, and saw no reason for making both herself and her father
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"Well," that gentleman answered, "I suppose no man would be over and above
  high-and-mighty satisfied with a speculation that lost him thirty-nine
  fortieths of his stake, <i>as</i> a speculation. But I was thinking it might
  ha' been as well to keep one magnum anyway&mdash;just as a curiosity. It
  mightn't have been altogether a mistake to ha' kept the lot. It would ha'
  come in pretty handy for presents when we got back&mdash;a bottle here and
  there of such a wine as that would ha' been thought considerable of, I
  believe&mdash;'specially if I let the price leak out sort of accidental. But,
  anyway, I don't mind confessing, right here, that I do wish I'd kept one
  bottle."</p>

  <p>"Well, father," suggested Daisy with something of a twinkle, "perhaps
  there wouldn't be any great difference between dropping thirty-nine fortieths
  of that thousand dollars and dropping all the forty?"</p>

  <p>"No, there wouldn't. A bottle of wine costs nine hundred and seventy-five
  dollars or a thousand&mdash;no such mighty difference. But why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I think it's pretty likely you can get a bottle back for the
  other twenty-five dollars. That would bring the price down to five hundred
  dollars each for the pair, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing the matter with the arithmetic," her father answered
  doubtfully, "but the wine's pretty well out of reach by this time, I
  guess."</p>

  <p>"But <i>surely</i> you remember who bought the very first magnum put up
  for sale?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, of course&mdash;the steward of the <i>Rajapur</i>; and pretty
  much of a startler I got when I heard the price he got it for."</p>

  <p>"Well, father, if you were in the habit of watching people as closely as I
  do, you'd guess that McNab didn't buy that wine to drink himself. He
  speculated; but he's a pretty hard-headed sort of Scotchman, and he'll make
  more of his speculation than you did, father! But you can buy his bottle, I'm
  sure, if he hasn't sold it already."</p>

  <p>"Come," cried her father, "that's a notion! We'll send and find him." And
  he rang for the waiter.</p>

  <p>Duncan McNab, chief steward of the <i>Rajapur</i>, was a methodical man of
  business, and he was not difficult to find that evening. The <i>Rajapur</i>,
  because of its accident, was to stay at Southampton for repairs before
  proceeding to London. Mr. McNab had seen the passengers off, and collected
  whatever contributions were forthcoming, the day before, and had also found
  time to come ashore and make his little speculation. He had rather expected
  to see the Tokay go cheap. All this following day he had not been idle, and
  he was busy with his accounts when he received Mr. Merrick's message. He
  curbed some natural resentment at being disturbed by a person who was no
  longer a passenger, and consequently no concern of his, by the reflection
  that possibly Merrick had repented of his disastrous transaction in wine, and
  now wished to recover at least one of his lost magnums; a perfectly accurate
  conjecture, as we have seen. For some hours the frugal soul of McNab had been
  troubled by a fear that perhaps he had foolishly risked his money&mdash;the
  magnum had cost him nine shillings&mdash;after all, and that he might wait
  for long ere he found anybody sufficiently daft to pay him a profit on his
  purchase. But at the hint of the message he took his hat, tightened his lips,
  and set his face toward the hotel.</p>

  <p>"Ou ay," quoth the McNab doubtfully, when he had listened to Mr. Merrick's
  explanation of his message. The steward spoke with a sourly thoughtful air,
  as though the suggestion of selling his property struck him as an unwelcome
  encroachment on his rights. "Ou ay; ha&mdash;hum; hum. A'm thinkin' ye'll ken
  that buyin' an' sellin' is aye twa deeferent things."</p>

  <p>"That," said Mr. Merrick, "is a piece of wisdom which this wine
  transaction would have taught me already, I guess, if I had never heard of it
  before."</p>

  <p>"Ou ay. Weel, an' what might ye be thinkin' of offering for the bottle of
  wine? 'Tis a muckle big bottle."</p>

  <p>"The same size as the others, of course. You gave nine shillings for it; I
  guess it's your business to say what profit you want on that."</p>

  <p>"Ha, hum. 'Twas circulatit aboard that ye paid twa hoondred poond for the
  twal' bottles. Noo, that wad mak' the bottle ye drinkit come to ower a
  hoondred an' ninety-five poond. Weel, noo, I'll no ask ye as much as that for
  mine."</p>

  <p>"I'd call that a mighty wise judgment, steward," replied Mr. Merrick
  solemnly. "Unless you want to keep it for yourself?"</p>

  <p>No; McNab obviously did not want to keep the magnum for himself. But his
  notion of the price was presently seen to be just the very highest sum that
  cold be squeezed out of the purchaser, and his opinion of his present
  customer's squeezability was a very exalted one, to begin with. But it sank
  gradually, as it became plain to the steward that the American would stand no
  more big figures; and, in the end, with much protest, the magnum became Mr.
  Merrick's again for five pounds. Whereupon it became plain that the
  business-like McNab had come prepared to clinch the bargain on the spot, and
  so give the purchaser no time for repentance, for he fetched the bottle from
  the hotel office downstairs, where it had been lying during the
  interview.</p>

  <p>So McNab went back to his ship much relieved in mind, while Mr. Merrick
  carefully packed away the magnum in the middle of a trunk, surrounded by
  clothes.</p>

  <p>From Southampton the Merricks made straight for London by an early train
  the next morning; and almost the first place they visited, as soon as they
  had gained the Langham Hotel and their luncheon, was the <i>Times</i>
  newspaper office, where Daisy's father paid for this advertisement:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">If Mr. Basil Clifton will communicate his present address to
  Lyman W. Merrick, Langham Hotel, London, he will give the advertiser the
  opportunity of renewing an old acquaintance, and of personally expressing his
  gratitude for a great act of kindness done him twenty-six years ago, in
  America. Any information of Mr. Clifton's whereabouts will be gratefully
  received.</p><br>

  <p>"I'm easier in my mind after that," Merrick observed to his daughter as
  their cab drove away from the office. "I've tried considerable before, and I
  think that's about the only thing left to do. Very likely I shan't hear, but
  if I don't hear to-morrow, every paper in London shall have that
  advertisement the next day."</p>

  <p>"I think, perhaps," Daisy suggested, looking sidelong at her father, "Mr.
  Clifton may not want to see you. You've written before."</p>

  <p>"Often; but I owe him all I have, all the same, and I'm missing no chances
  if I can help it. Perhaps he's dead, of course&mdash;he was as old as I am
  now twenty-six years ago. But perhaps he isn't, and perhaps <i>his</i> luck
  has gone down while mine has gone up. If it has&mdash;well I'm here to sort
  of make things even. It's all his, I reckon, in a way of speakin'&mdash;all
  from the beginning. I did nothing but sit and take what came of it."</p>

  <p>"He lent you the money to start, didn't he, father?"</p>

  <p>"He did&mdash;and he was a stranger. It was rather an odd trade
  altogether, and it was a rare piece of gall on my part to put it to him. I
  never told you, I think, but your poor mother knew it all, and she never let
  up on urging me to pay back somehow. You see, he was a great collector of all
  sorts of strange and curious things, and&mdash;hey gee! Why, that's just the
  thing!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the Tokay; I was just thinking. If I find him, that bottle of
  Tokay's just the sort of little present that 'ud please him! I ought to ha'
  thought o' that before! What a fool thing it was to sell the others&mdash;one
  magnum's no sort of a present for such a man, even a magnum of old
  Tokay!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he'd appreciate it, whatever it was, father, if he's the sort of
  man you say."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, he would; he was a white man right through and up an' down an'
  all. Well, as I was saying, he was a great collector of all sorts of
  rarities, and at that time I had a complete Indian's rig-out of
  wampum&mdash;the real shell stuff&mdash;that I had brought from West when I
  was a boy. Your gran'-father traded an old gun for it. Well, at that time,
  although it was a sort of curio, there was no particular big money in such a
  thing&mdash;a few dollars, perhaps&mdash;and it was about all I had in the
  world after what clothes I stood up in. But I was a hustling young fellow,
  and I had my eye&mdash;both eyes&mdash;hard on some land&mdash;the land where
  Merricksville is now, my dear. The land was cheap enough, but cheapness ain't
  much good to a man without a cent, anyway, and I was most powerful set on
  having that land. You can guess why, now, knowing what you do. They'd been
  drawing oil in Pennsylvania for some few years then, but there wasn't a well
  within sixty miles of this place. I knew oil was there, though, and there I
  tuck, pretty considerable dancin' mad to think that here was my fortune being
  lost for a matter of five hundred dollars or so. You see, it was no good a
  slouch like me going around to borrow five hundred dollars without security,
  and if I let on what I was after, well, anyone that believed my judgment
  would get the land for himself, of course. Well, that was how it was when I
  ran up against Mr. Basil Clifton."</p>

  <p>"He was just travelling, you see&mdash;been round the world, like
  ourselves now, but doing it a deal slower. He wanted to see some good
  wampum&mdash;wanted to buy it; and somehow somebody remembered me&mdash;I was
  doing odd chores on a farm. He saw the set, and, as I say, he offered to buy
  it. Well, the only money that was any use to me just then was five hundred
  dollars, and the few dollars that wampum was worth&mdash;then&mdash;would ha'
  been no use at all. I was pretty desp'rate for that five hundred dollars,
  knowing what it meant, and I went in baldheaded on this chance, without much
  hope of getting it. 'Stranger,' I said, 'here's the stuff, as you see, but it
  ain't for sale. Not for sale, you see, but I'll give it for interest on a
  loan. I want five hundred dollars for a start in life, and I'll give this in
  advance for interest.'"</p>

  <p>"He opened his eyes a bit at this, but he was quite English and quiet
  about it. 'How long do you want that loan for?' he asked. 'Six months,' I
  said, 'though I guess I could pay in three.' 'I expect to be in England long
  before the end of three months,' he said. 'Then I should have to mail it on,'
  I answered. 'Any security?' he asked. 'No,' says I. He seemed considerable
  amused in his quiet sort of way&mdash;he was a man twice my age at that time,
  you see&mdash;and he looked from me to the wampum and back again several
  times. 'Well,' he said at last, 'I'll speculate on your honour, young man.
  Come to my hotel and you shall have the money.' And I had it; and in two
  months the oil was coming up in millions of gallons, and Merricksville was
  begun. He'd left his banker's address, and there the money went, under the
  three months, with a letter for him. I got an answer on plain notepaper,
  headed care of the bankers&mdash;a very kind answer, full of
  congratulations&mdash;but he wouldn't take a cent more than his due; the
  speculation was my own idea, he said, and he'd already got more than the loan
  was worth. And then&mdash;well then I married your mother, and got took up
  with one thing and another, and it was ten years before I wrote again. And
  then he'd changed his bankers, and so I lost track of him. But I felt sort o'
  guilty about it somehow, not having written for ten years, and having made
  such a pile on his money, and I tried and tried again but got no nearer. I
  was over here once, as you know, and I chanced to meet an old friend of his,
  but he hadn't seen him for years&mdash;ever since he lost his wife and shut
  himself away in the country, he said. Of course, after all this time, it's
  likely he's dead&mdash;he'd be pretty late in the seventies by this time, I
  guess. But I'd like to see him once again, and that's a fact!"</p>

  <p>Now it was no more than twenty-four hours since Merrick <i>had</i> seen
  Mr. Basil Clifton, as we have seen, when that collector bought a magnum of
  the very wine he was selling. But the purchase was for cash and no name was
  given, neither man was thinking of the other at the moment, and even if this
  had not been the case the twenty-six years which had elapsed since their one
  and only meeting had sufficiently disguised both to prevent anything like
  recognition. It was one of the narrow chances that mock man's wishes a score
  of times in a life.</p>

  <p>The rest of the day went in the sights of London, and the day after that.
  There was no answer to the advertisement.</p>

  <p>Just before dinner on this second day in London Merrick telephoned to an
  advertising agency to have the notice repeated in every London paper on the
  following morning. And if, as Daisy Merrick sat at dinner in the Langham
  Hotel, she gave a thought to Harvey Crook (which she did) not her wildest
  dream could have pictured him as and where he was. For this was the evening
  of his visit to Downs Lodge.</p>

  <p>At breakfast in the morning Merrick examined the newspapers with some
  interest, for he had felt some doubt as to whether his order for the
  advertisement had not been given too late in the day. He was reassured to
  perceive that his message duly had its place in each paper, and turned the
  news pages of the last he had examined. One thing and another he passed
  casually till he came to a paragraph which set him positively gasping. This
  was the paragraph:</p><br>

  <p class="headline"><b>Ghastly Double Murder at Southampton.</b><br></p>

  <p class="quote">A double murder of an unusually horrible character was
  committed last night at Downs Lodge, near Southampton, a detached house in
  the occupation of Mr. Basil Clifton, the victims being Mr. Clifton himself
  and his housekeeper, Mary Carr. Robbery appears to have been the motive of
  the crime, as the drawers of a writing-table in Mr. Clifton's library were
  found broken, and a small safe had been opened. Mr. Clifton's body was found
  in this room, with the throat cut so deeply as almost to sever the head from
  the body. The housekeeper's body was found in the kitchen doorway, the
  unfortunate woman having evidently been killed by repeated blows on the head
  from some blunt instrument, probably after the attack on her master. The
  housemaid, the only other servant, was out for the evening when the crime was
  committed. A man of gentlemanly appearance, a stranger in the district,
  giving the name of Harvey Crook, is in custody in connection with the
  affair.</p><br>

  <p>Here, indeed, was something to make Merrick gasp, and more. His
  benefactor, his once-seen friend of twenty-six years ago, long sought since,
  was discovered at last, butchered in his chair&mdash;and Harvey Crook was
  charged with the murder! They had bidden good-bye to Crook four days before,
  and he had started, ostensibly, for London. But here he was in Southampton
  again and&mdash;!</p>

  <p>But if the effect of the news was startling on Mr. Lyman Merrick, on his
  daughter it was infinitely distressing. She broke into vehement protests that
  Crook must be innocent, insisted that they must go instantly and support his
  defence somehow&mdash;and then fainted while dressing to go. The end of it
  was that they missed the 10.15 train and went by the eleven o'clock. A
  fortunate circumstance after all, for, before the train left, Waterloo
  station was fluttering with the halfpenny evening papers which come out in
  the morning; the placards flamed the Southampton murders in the biggest
  capitals; and in the papers themselves, which Mr. Merrick bought by the
  handful, it was reported that Harvey crook had been released and that search
  was being made for somebody else. The effect of this intelligence on Daisy
  Merrick, albeit tranquillising in the end, was at first such that Lyman W.
  Merrick began to regard his daughter as a very eccentric young woman.</p>

  <p>No young lady could have been more properly self-possessed than Daisy
  Merrick by the time Southampton was reached, and when her father began to
  "hustle around" in that town in search of Harvey Crook and whatever
  information was to be obtained, she hustled with him, every yard. It was not
  a very difficult thing to find Crook&mdash;everybody was full of the tale of
  the murders, and the police directed the searchers to his hotel at once.</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook was in the last stages of lunch when his visitors arrived,
  and Merrick rushed at him with both hands outstretched.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Crook," he cried, "tell me what all this means! Who did it? How was
  it? Where were you in it? Did you know him? How&mdash;But there, I guess you
  think I'm flighty under the hat. Here, look at that&mdash;it's quicker'n
  telling you!"</p>

  <p>He snatched a newspaper from his pocket and pointed to his own
  advertisement in the "agony" column. "Do you happen to have seen that?" he
  asked. "My advertisement, Mr. Crook&mdash;mine!"</p>

  <p>Crook had not seen it, and was vastly astonished to read it now. Daisy
  watched him with shining eyes as he read it, but she was quiet and
  self-possessed enough by this time.</p>

  <p>"Why," said Crook, "this is amazing! The poor old gentleman was a friend
  of yours, then?"</p>

  <p>"The friend I owe my bottom cent to, and my top cent, and all the cents in
  between!" exclaimed Merrick. "And I only saw him once in my life."</p>

  <p>"That's odder still. I had a letter from him after I left you, and dined
  at his house last night, and yet I never saw him till he was dead! It seems
  to me that we are all in a strange adventure together. Sit down. We must
  compare notes."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick told his side of the tale sufficiently clearly in a dozen
  hurried sentences, and was urgent to know what Harvey Crook had to tell.</p>

  <p>"My tale will take a trifle longer to explain," Crook began. "You and I
  and poor old Mr. Clifton are a little more tangled up together than you
  think. Now listen. When I sold you that dozen magnums of old Tokay on board
  the <i>Rajapur</i>, you paid two hundred pounds, and thought it a high price.
  So did I."</p>

  <p>"It was an almighty high price, I guess."</p>

  <p>"No, it wasn't. It may not have been quite so cheap as your hundred
  pounds' worth of land in Pennsylvania, twenty-six years ago, but it was the
  next best bargain of your life. In that case, Mr. Merrick, you bought, for
  two hundred pounds, a few gallons of old Tokay worth&mdash;well, that's
  difficult to guess, and doesn't matter; you bought a few gallons of old Tokay
  and a diamond worth all the Tokay in the world a dozen times over!"</p>

  <p>"<i>A</i> diamond!" ejaculated Lyman W. Merrick.</p>

  <p>And, "<i>A</i> diamond!" cried Daisy, forgetting her English accent for
  the moment.</p>

  <p>"Not only a diamond," Crook went on with a slight smile, "but the
  diamond&mdash;the green diamond. You remember the shindy about the Green Eye
  of Goona?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," exclaimed father and daughter together, breathlessly, "at the
  Durbar!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that is the jewel that was in that case of wine, and that is the
  jewel that you sold by auction here at Lawson's, for eight or ten shillings
  or so, bottle of wine included!"</p>

  <p>"But what&mdash;why&mdash;was it in the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"In one of the bottles&mdash;which bottle I am trying to find out. That is
  my business just at present, and I am very nearly as keen about that as you
  were about the five-hundred-dollar lot of land twenty-six years ago; for it
  probably means a little fortune if I am successful."</p>

  <p>"A <i>little</i> fortune? Well, I'd guess&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes&mdash;the thing itself is worth something enormous, of
  course&mdash;king's ransom, Jew's eye, mint of money&mdash;just whatever
  phrase you like to use. The only difficulty would be to find a customer for
  such a thing. But it's stolen property, you know."</p>

  <p>"Stolen property? Well, yes, I guess that's about the size of it. But then
  it's a bit above likely that it's been stolen property any time these
  thousand years&mdash;stolen one way or another. That's the way with those
  Indian diamonds, I guess?"</p>

  <p>"You are right, no doubt, but no matter how long it may have been stolen
  property, I think I'd rather not be one of the thieves. No; if I find this,
  it goes back to the Rajah of Goona&mdash;on terms, of course. That's where I
  expect to find my little fortune&mdash;just the pursuit of my trade, you see,
  Mr. Merrick! I find something here cheap and I sell it dear in India&mdash;or
  rather, I charge for risk and carriage!"</p>

  <p>"But now I don't know&mdash;how did&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How it got to the bottle, exactly, I can't tell yet; but it's pretty
  certain that the man who put it in was Hahn, the fellow I told you of, who
  got me to bring the wine to England&mdash;to save the risk he feared, as I
  see well enough now. And, to add another interest to the chase, he's after
  the bottles now, in competition with me! Lord! what a taking he was in when
  he found I'd sold the wine!"</p>

  <p>"And to think!&mdash;Great Scott, Mr. Crook&mdash;to think of the fool
  thing I did when I shoved off them magnums at a couple o' dollars each or so!
  But I've got one back; I didn't tell you that. I changed my mind and bought
  one back the very same night!"</p>

  <p>"Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"It's in London at the 'Langham'&mdash;safe enough in the middle of a
  trunk, locked tight. Great thunder! The diamond may be in that! And
  McNab&mdash;" but here Merrick broke into a fit of laughter in the midst of
  his wonder.</p>

  <p>"McNab? What? The chief steward? What&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, Mr. Crook, it's the very greatest sort of an amusement to think of
  the face of McNab, if ever he hears he has sold that diamond for five pounds!
  The very greatest!" And Merrick told the story of the recovery of the first
  magnum sold.</p>

  <p>Crook took a little note from his pocket. "That," he said, "was lot 87
  star then, with no name. I had no idea the steward was a buyer. That accounts
  for four magnums altogether, including the one we drank. If you have the
  lucky bottle, Mr. Merrick, the sooner we see it the better; the sooner the
  better, in fact, in any case. But there's the inquest, and they want me here.
  Which brings me back to my story. I was visiting your old friend Mr. Clifton
  on this very matter of the Tokay. He had a magnum himself."</p>

  <p>"What? No! You don't say!"</p>

  <p>"Yes I do. And more&mdash;he bought it himself at the sale, so that you
  and he must have been in the room together here at Lawson's, four days
  ago&mdash;rubbed shoulders, as likely as not!"</p>

  <p>Lyman W. Merrick rose and tramped agitatedly about the room.</p>

  <p>"I've reckoned myself a hustler," he said as he went, with his fingers in
  the hair over each of his ears&mdash;"I've reckoned myself a hustler most o'
  my life, and I've been called a hustler by them that can hustle a few on
  their own; but these hustlings are getting a shade too jumpy for me. Getting
  older, I s'pose. What I've seen and heard since I opened that paper at
  breakfast this morning is enough to hustle the senses out of any man's head,
  and I'm not sure whether I've got any of 'em or not now. I say," he added,
  turning suddenly to Crook, "I s'pose I really <i>am</i> awake? Do you 'low
  I'm quite awake, Mr. Crook?"</p>

  <p>"Quite awake, Mr. Merrick," Crook answered with a smile, "and waiting to
  hear about my last night's adventure, I've no doubt."</p>

  <p>Merrick sat down, and Crook told his story in detail. He produced Mr.
  Clifton's letter inviting him to Downs Lodge to exhibit the old Chinese
  kakemono; he told of how he had learned Mr. Clifton's name and address from
  Symons, the auctioneer's clerk; he described the curious house and his more
  curious reception; and last, dropping his voice with something of a furtive
  look towards Daisy Merrick, he described the disappearance of his false host,
  and his ghastly discoveries in kitchen and library.</p>

  <p>Merrick rose again, and walked about as he had done before.</p>

  <p>"Poor old fellow," he said, with genuine distress in his voice; "poor old
  man. A splendid old gentleman like him&mdash;for he <i>was</i> splendid, up
  an' down, though I only saw him once, barrin' the other day, when I may have
  seen him or not, but didn't know. To be cut an' killed like that, after all,
  in his own chair, an' me as near as I was, an' not near enough to stop it!
  Mr. Crook, it's&mdash;it's&mdash;" the words came rather like
  sobs&mdash;"it's pretty tough, I 'low!"</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;then they arrested you, Mr. Crook?" Daisy asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and a very natural thing for them to do. There was I, a
  stranger, in the house, the housemaid out, and the master and the housekeeper
  both murdered. But it didn't last long, of course. They brought me back here
  before midnight, and now they're out all over the country after
  Pritchard&mdash;the man who really is guilty, without much doubt, I should
  say." And Crook went on to tell what he had heard of the history of the
  fugitive.</p>

  <p>"Poor old friend!" mused Merrick, once again, sitting now with his hands
  on his knees. "Helping a man over a snag again, too&mdash;just like him!
  Helping somebody again, and this is what he got for it! Cut this throat for
  three hundred dollars in the safe! Come!" he added more briskly, jumping to
  his feet, "this ain't no sort of a way for a live man to hoe this row!
  Sittin' and grievin' is no way to catch Mr. Pritchard. And it's him that's to
  be caught, and will be, if my bottom dollar will catch him! Can't we see the
  police?"</p>

  <p>"Of course we can. But the inquest is this afternoon&mdash;quite soon, in
  fact. The coroner seems to be what you would call a hustler, and apparently
  his work is a little slack just now. But have you lunched? There is barely
  time."</p>

  <p>The inquests were held in the hall of Downs Lodge, the bodies having been
  removed to the coach-house. As many of the public as could squeeze into the
  hall were there, and the front steps and forepart of the grounds were
  crowded. Mr. Merrick and his daughter were given favoured places in the hall
  on the representations of Harvey Crook, and proceedings were begun with exact
  punctuality, the business-like coroner using a combined procedure which
  enabled the two inquiries to be conducted with as little repetition of form
  and evidence as possible.</p>

  <p>The police gave evidence of having been called to the spot, and of what
  they found when they got there. The divisional surgeon described the
  condition of the bodies and the positions in which they had been found, and
  stated his scientific opinion on the causes of death in each
  case&mdash;opinions given purely formally, of course, since it was plain to
  everybody that no man could live with his throat cut as Mr. Clifton's had
  been, nor anybody, man or woman, with such injuries to the head as the
  housekeeper had suffered.</p>

  <p>But, of course, the chief witness was Harvey Crook. He produced the letter
  of invitation which he had received from Mr. Clifton, his own reply to which,
  as well as his own first letter, was in the hands of the police. He told of
  his reception at the house, and described, as closely as possible, the person
  of the man who had entertained him, and whom he had supposed to be Mr.
  Clifton. In short, he retold, with more particular detail, the story Merrick
  and Daisy had already heard. This in every particular but one. For, of
  course, he said nothing of the Tokay, beyond the simple fact, which was all
  that was needed, that the man who had entertained him had brought in cold
  food and a bottle of wine. He had come to exhibit his old Chinese painting,
  and the wine, Tokay or other, was no business for this jury&mdash;or, at any
  rate, so it seemed to Crook at the time.</p>

  <p>Then there was the evidence of the housemaid&mdash;largely a description
  of the missing Mr. James Pritchard, tallying exactly with the description of
  his host already given by Crook; how long Pritchard had been at the house,
  what he had done, and so forth. The evidence, also, of Mr. Clifton's
  solicitor, who knew something of Pritchard's earlier career, and had letters
  and other papers in the matter. And in the end the jury gave their verdicts,
  as everybody knew they must: in each case it was "Wilful murder by James
  Pritchard."</p>

  <p>Now, although Crook had a general reason of prudence for not mentioning
  the matter of the Tokay in his evidence, and no reason at all for mentioning
  it, he had, in addition, one very particular and immediate reason for acting
  as he did. For, as he began his testimony, his eyes wandered toward the door,
  and there, behind the rest of the people who had found standing room, was
  Hahn, eyes and ears wide open, noting every word. And when his examination
  was over, and Crook was at liberty to move about as he pleased, Hahn was
  gone.</p>

  <p>Now here was a point in the game for Hahn. For though there might have
  been nothing suspicious in Crook's visit to Mr. Clifton as he had told it,
  and as, in fact, it had occurred, there remained the simple fact that he had
  returned to Southampton from London quicker than Hahn could get there, and it
  was from a Southampton hotel that his letters to Mr. Clifton were dated. That
  was quite enough for a man like Hahn. He knew that he was not alone in his
  search for the Green Eye of Goona&mdash;had perhaps even begun to suspect the
  inner meaning of his reception in Mr. Norie's studio.</p>

  <p>So the crowd broke up, and Lyman W. Merrick, in company with Crook, sought
  the chief constable, eager to do what might be done to bring the murderer to
  justice. Crook explained in a few words the relation in which Merrick stood
  to the murdered man, and Merrick opened business straight away.</p>

  <p>"See here, Mr. Chief Constable," he said, "I want to offer a reward for
  the apprehension of this fellow. There's nothing against that, is there?"</p>

  <p>No, it seemed there was no particular law against it. The police no longer
  offered rewards themselves, but there was nothing to prevent a private person
  doing so.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. Then I will give five thousand dollars&mdash;one thousand
  pounds, that is&mdash;to the man who arrests the murderer of Mr. Basil
  Clifton. Is five thousand enough? If not, don't mind telling me. I can double
  it."</p>

  <p>"Quite enough&mdash;plenty," answered the chief constable. "Even too much,
  I think I should say."</p>

  <p>"Then that's a good fault, sir, and we'll let it stand. And beyond that
  I'll give more. I'll give one thousand dollars to any other man whom you
  think deserves it for his work on the case&mdash;one man or more, just as
  many as you tell me. And now, if it's no way against the rules, I'd like to
  take a look over the house with my friend Mr. Harvey Crook, to see just how
  it all happened."</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty about that, especially as the more unpleasant
  traces of the tragedies had been now removed by the police,</p>

  <p>"Everything else has been left as it was," said the chief constable, "and,
  of course, if either of you gentlemen sees anything suggestive or
  interesting, in view of your own knowledge of the poor old gentleman, and of
  the circumstances, I hope you'll mention it."</p>

  <p>They went first to the dining-room, where the table jay just as Crook had
  left it, and the guttered candles were hanging over the silver candlesticks.
  There lay the remains of the dinner, and on the sideboard stood the two
  decanters of Tokay, with the empty magnum by their side.</p>

  <p>"Here is the magnum you sold," said Crook, turning to Merrick. "It was
  opened especially for me&mdash;or rather, I opened it myself. Mr. Merrick
  sold some bottles of Tokay by auction when he arrived in England," Crook
  explained to the chief constable, "and Mr. Clifton bought one, without
  knowing who the seller was."</p>

  <p>The chief constable nodded pleasantly, as though the matter were a very
  interesting one for the parties concerned, but of no particular moment to
  him; and Mr. Merrick lifted the empty magnum, tilted it and shook it. But
  Crook had already told him that this magnum had been drawn a blank, and he
  acted in mere curiosity.</p>

  <p>Crook led the way along the corridor and down the stairs, repeating as he
  went the story of his questing and calling for his host in the dark stillness
  of last night. The kitchen door stood wide open now, but the floor was still
  wet from the recent scrubbing that had been so necessary.</p>

  <p>"He must have stepped over the woman's body here," exclaimed the chief
  constable, "each time he came downstairs for plates or what not for the
  dinner he gave you, Mr. Crook." And Daisy, clinging tight to her father's
  arm, shuddered at the thought.</p>

  <p>They came up from the lower floor, and as they gained the landing Merrick
  chanced to glance up the staircase, and saw a flat glass case hanging on the
  wall at the next landing.</p>

  <p>"Why," he exclaimed, "look there! If there ain't my old wampum!"</p>

  <p>They climbed the intervening flight of stairs, and there the wampum hung,
  sure enough, displayed to advantage against the wall behind the glass. Tears
  stood in Merrick's eyes as he gazed at it. "There it is, Daisy," he repeated,
  in a curious sort of half-pleased voice. "There it is. That's it!"</p>

  <p>"It's the only thing I ever gave him," he went on again, after a pause;
  "and it don't seem much for what he did for me and trusting me, too, a
  stranger. But I'm mighty pleased to see he took care of it&mdash;mighty
  pleased to see that, I am. Yes; it's a comfort, now, to see he thought
  something of it&mdash;perhaps more than I did. You'd say, gentlemen, looking
  at that glass case and all that, he did think something of it, wouldn't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course," answered Crook. "Didn't you see the numberless valuable
  things lying about below loose? And then, look at this glass case!"</p>

  <p>"Ah," the American answered, "I'm might glad to see that case, and to know
  you think he thought something of that wampum. It's sort of lifted a load off
  my mind, gentlemen, in a foolish sort o' way."</p>

  <p>And now they turned to the library where Merrick's old friend had met his
  death. Just as when Crook had first seen it the night before, there lay books
  and books everywhere, high and low. But now the blood-stains were gone, and
  the poor torn body had been carried away from the chair in which Crook had
  found it. The door of the little safe still stood open, the little sheet-iron
  drawers were still tumbled on the floor, and the drawers of the writing-table
  were splintered and gaping just as they had been left; and the chief
  constable explained the meaning of all these things as he pointed them
  out.</p>

  <p>"Nothing else seems to have been touched," he concluded, casually pushing
  open the cupboard under an old glazed bookcase. "Here you are, everything
  seems in order; and there's a bottle of wine like the other."</p>

  <p>And in truth there was; for there before their eyes stood another magnum
  of Tokay, the fellow to the one that Crook had opened the night before, and
  one of the dozen without a possible doubt!</p>

  <p>"But," said Merrick&mdash;"but&mdash;he only bought one?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Crook replied, "that is certain. I have it from the auctioneer's
  clerk that he only bought one. That is certain."</p>

  <p>"Had another already, I expect," observed the chief constable
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>Crook lifted the great bottle and saw that the cork had been drawn; also
  some of the wine was gone&mdash;three or four glasses, perhaps. He took the
  magnum to the light of the window, held the cork fast, and slowly tilted it.
  Nothing was there&mdash;nothing but the wine. No diamond came tumbling from
  the bottom into the neck.</p>

  <p>Merrick and Crook looked one at the other, and put the bottle back. What
  did it mean? The bottle had been opened, certainly.</p>

  <p>They made toward the door, and the chief constable marched into the
  corridor. Merrick turned to Crook and whispered.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" he said. "That scoundrel knew what was in the house,
  and yet he opened a new magnum for you! Why? How did this one get here?
  <i>Was</i> it only for sixty or seventy pounds that he did murder&mdash;or
  was it for something more? Something in that bottle of wine?"</p>

  <p>The two men looked each in the other's face and passed out in the wake of
  the chief constable.</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>V. &mdash; MR. POOLEY'S MAGNUM</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, April 1904</h3>

  <p class="first">"I GUESS this little holiday of ours is likely to be a
  hustlin'er sort of holiday than we allowed," observed Mr. Lyman W. Merrick.
  "And we <i>did</i> allow to hustle some, too."</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook smiled. He remembered the sanguine programme arranged by his
  American friend and his daughter on board the <i>Rajapur</i>, with its two
  thousand square miles or so of Great Britain per diem. Daisy Merrick smiled,
  too; which was a pleasant thing in itself, and interesting to any person who
  might have been noticing the fact that she and Crook were getting into a
  habit of smiling together.</p>

  <p>"However," Mr. Merrick pursued, "there's to be no holiday-making till
  we've introduced ourselves to Mr. Pritchard, and I'll see that man arrested
  if I have to stay in England the rest of my life. You and I'll see about
  that, Mr. Crook."</p>

  <p>"Anything I can do, of course, I will," Crook said. "But I doubt if either
  of us can do as much as the police, who are organised specially for such
  work. Moreover"&mdash;Crook smiled again&mdash;"I have a little hunt of my
  own in progress, as you know, Mr. Merrick. There's that green diamond! That
  to me is very much what your five hundred dollars' worth of land was
  twenty-six years ago. Though of course I don't expect so much out of this as
  you have derived from your own little speculation!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;the green diamond," Mr. Merrick answered thoughtfully.
  "There's such a deal of excitement about today that I was clean forgetting
  that; though it isn't the sort of thing you'd think one would forget easily,
  either. Well, what's your next move with that?"</p>

  <p>They had returned to the hotel after the inquest, and were refreshing
  themselves with tea. It was a little late for tea, but the inquest was
  responsible for that, and it still lacked some hour or two to dinnertime.</p>

  <p>"My next move," said Crook slowly, "I can't pretend to prophesy. Except,
  of course, that I want to examine&mdash;or want you to examine&mdash;that
  bottle of Tokay you have in London."</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;that's the first thing. Why, I have had such a
  day&mdash;finding Mr. Clifton, and finding him dead, and getting hustled up
  and down this way and that, that I positively began to forget buying that
  bottle of McNab. Snakes! What a piece of luck if the diamond should be in
  that!"</p>

  <p>"Well," Crook responded, "it's an eight-to-one-chance against, of
  course&mdash;which otherwise mathematically expressed, is a chance of one in
  nine. There were a dozen magnums to begin with, and it's certain that the
  diamond was in one of them. The first we opened and drank on the
  <i>Rajapur</i>. It wasn't in that. The second got to Mr. Norie the
  artist&mdash;it certainly wasn't in that, since I poured every drop from it
  myself. Then there was the magnum that poor Mr. Clifton bought&mdash;the one
  brought me in the course of that amazing dinner last night. As to that I can
  certify also&mdash;I decanted it myself. That leaves nine of the dozen
  unaccounted for, and one of those is the mysterious bottle we ourselves
  discovered this afternoon, opened, in Mr. Clifton's bookcase&mdash;a very
  mysterious bottle that."</p>

  <p>"Mysterious it is." Mr. Merrick slapped his knee and nodded vehemently.
  "Mysterious it is, I say, and it may supply a bigger motive for those murders
  than the few hundred dollars that are gone."</p>

  <p>"Quite likely," Crook responded, "but the solution of that mystery must
  wait till the murderer is caught&mdash;even if we reach it then. Meantime, we
  mustn't neglect the other magnums, for after all we have nothing but the
  wildest conjecture as to this. I must waste no time, for the very magnum
  containing that great green diamond may be being uncorked at this very
  moment! I must waste no time, as I say, and yet for the life of me I can't
  see how next to employ it, or where to look now. At any rate, we'll have a
  look at your bottle as soon as we are in London again. Meantime, I might go
  and see the auctioneer's clerk again; though if he had anything to tell me he
  would have been round here with it."</p>

  <p>"It was he who gave you the names of some of the buyers, wasn't it?" Daisy
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, as far as he could. Though that wasn't very far, as I have told
  you."</p>

  <p>"Well, now, Mr. Crook," Daisy said, with a whimsical smile, "I wonder it
  has never occurred to you to ask anybody else who was present at the sale,
  beside the auctioneer's clerk&mdash;me, for instance!"</p>

  <p>"You! Why, of course&mdash;if you can remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes"&mdash;Daisy laughed&mdash;"I <i>can</i> remember more than father
  can, anyway, I'm sure! I don't remember much that can be of use perhaps, but
  I do remember that two of the passengers on the <i>Rajapur</i> bought
  magnums&mdash;two passengers at least. There were Mr. Pooley and Mr.
  Allen."</p>

  <p>"I knew Allen bought one," Crook observed. "He gave his name, and the
  clerk had it down on the marked catalogue. Come&mdash;we'll try for Allen
  next. I should be able to get at him somehow through the steamship office, no
  doubt. But who was Pooley?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I expect you wouldn't have heard his name. He was a very quiet
  passenger, and we only knew it through an accident. A box of his was put into
  father's cabin by mistake, and he came round with the steward after it. He
  was a clean-shaven, rather overdressed man, but quiet in his ways, and he
  kept very much in his own quarters. Perhaps you don't remember him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I do."</p>

  <p>"Well, at any rate, he bought one of the magnums. Let me recollect, now.
  When the first lot was put up there was a long pause&mdash;nobody seemed to
  want the wine, or to know what to bid. It began low, and McNab, the steward,
  got the magnum for nine shillings. Father remembers that&mdash;the price
  startled him, I tell you!"</p>

  <p>"It did!" Mr. Merrick assented.</p>

  <p>"A funny little man bought the next lot&mdash;a very carefully brushed and
  oiled little man, with very loud clothes He bought four magnums one after
  another for ten shillings each, and gave the name of Smith. He was a wine
  merchant's traveller, they said. And then Mr. Allen bought a bottle, and then
  Mr. Pooley."</p>

  <p>Crook was consulting the copy he had made of this part of Symons's marked
  catalogue. "Yes," he said, "and then a bottle was sold to the artist, Mr.
  Norie. The next was number ninety-five star, and the name Curtice is against
  that. But stay&mdash;there <i>is</i> something I can do now&mdash;before
  dinner, even. The shipping office is in London, but the ship must still be
  here. I'll go and knock up McNab, the steward."</p>

  <p>The <i>Rajapur</i> carried cargo of a superior kind, as well as
  passengers, and was still discharging pending repairs. McNab, the chief
  steward, might have obtained leave to come to London by rail, leaving his
  assistant in charge, since the passengers had all left the ship. But the
  thought of such an extravagance would have appalled his thrifty mind. By
  sticking to his post as long as possible, he not only saved his railway fare,
  but also lived at the expense of his employers; and nothing short of an
  obvious pecuniary balance on the other side could have induced him to forego
  such advantages. So that Crook reached the steward's pantry of the
  <i>Rajapur</i> to find McNab still in it.</p>

  <p>McNab, dour and distrustful, waited while Crook explained that he was
  anxious to find the addresses of Mr. Allen and Mr. Pooley, late passengers on
  the <i>Rajapur</i>, and would be glad of any help to that end. Then the
  steward cleared his throat and said: "Ha, hum. Ye'll ken it's nae pairt o' my
  duties to gie addresses, or assist in getting addresses, o' passengers that
  hae left the ship an' are no any further concern of mine?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, of course. If you are able to give me any help, of course I shall
  be very grateful"&mdash;here McNab looked sourer than ever&mdash;"and, of
  course, I'll pay whatever you think is right for your trouble."</p>

  <p>At this the McNab no longer looked sour, but rather disappointed. "Oh ay,"
  he said, "that's weel enough, but I'm thinkin' I can do naething for ye. I
  ken nae mair o' their addresses than ye ken yersel'! But I'll remember what
  ye say, if ye'll let me hae your ain address."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Though I wanted the information without delay."</p>

  <p>McNab shook his head. Then he said, looking curiously in Crook's face,
  "There's a curious thing about they names, Mr. Crook. Mr. Allen and Mr.
  Pooley each bought one o' they muckle big bottles o' Tokay at the
  sale&mdash;the same that ye sold Mr. Merrick; an' I bought one myself!"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Weel, Mr. Merrick bought mine back frae me. Now you come yersel' and want
  the addresses of twa ither buyers; and I've had ither inquiries. I suspeecion
  I've sold Mr. Merrick that bottle too cheap!"</p>

  <p>Plainly the shrewd McNab smelt a rat somewhere.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Crook observed carelessly.</p>

  <p>"And as to the other inquiries, I expect some of them came from a man
  named Hahn, didn't they? A man of near about fifty, not so tall as me, with a
  short, grey beard. Speaks excellent English, but is a foreigner?"</p>

  <p>"Weel, Mr. Crook, I won't deny but what you seem to ken him. And I've guid
  reason to believe I could have done better with my bottle with him than with
  Mr. Merrick. But it's no' him alone has been makin' inquiries."</p>

  <p>"Who else?"</p>

  <p>"The police! Ay, the police have been here for Mr. Pooley's address!"</p>

  <p>"The police!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, the police. I couldna tell them more than I could tell you, o'
  course, and equally o' course they told me naethin', and for why they came I
  ken naethin'. But it was the police, an' a plain-clothes policeman at
  that!"</p>

  <p>So with this information&mdash;and it was surprising enough&mdash;Harvey
  Crook was fain to return to his dinner. The steward watched him as he left
  the ship, and returned to his pantry with many wise shakes of the head.
  Plainly, Mr. McNab was convinced that big things were afoot; and even though
  he had not a ghost of a notion what the big things were, he was resolved to
  squeeze a profit from them if any profit were to be squeezed.</p>

  <p>To Harvey Crook the puzzle before him became multiplied by a hundred. What
  did this mean&mdash;the police? Was it possible that Hahn and his tricks had
  been betrayed, and that the police were in as eager search of those dispersed
  magnums of Tokay as he himself was? In that case he felt he might as well
  give up the chase on his own account and turn to more profitable business.
  The police, with all their elaborate machinery, their armies of trained
  detectives, their command of every source of information, could do more in an
  hour than he could attempt in a week. But the true explanation of the matter
  came in a very little while.</p>

  <p>Crook made no delay on his way from the dock, but went straight back to
  the hotel. True, he would be too early for dinner, but why not just as well
  wait in the company of Mr. Merrick and Daisy&mdash;for it would be futile to
  pretend that she had nothing to do with the matter&mdash;as not?</p>

  <p>He found his friends in their private sitting-room with visitors. One
  visitor was a youngish-looking man, clean-shaven, broad-framed but bony, who
  looked rather like a prize-fighter a little over-trained, and with an
  exceptionally intelligent head; the other was the chief constable who had
  accompanied them over Mr. Clifton's house only an hour or two ago.</p>

  <p>"Here's my friend Mr. Crook," Merrick said as Crook entered. "Though I
  doubt if he can tell you more than we can. This gentleman," he said, turning
  to Crook, "is a detective of the London force, Sergeant Wickes. It seems
  we've been travelling in bad company. That Mr. Pooley, the quiet passenger in
  the loud clothes, is wanted by the police!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;the police would like to know where he is&mdash;that's all,"
  the chief constable said. "He's a notorious character, you see, and one of
  the sort the police must keep track of if they can, you know, or they'll be
  in serious mischief and away again before they can be stopped. The Scotland
  Yard authorities lost track of him some little while back, and only just
  received information that he had been to the great Durbar in India. He is a
  great swell in his way, you see, and that is just the sort of place he'd go
  to, and make it pay him, somehow, too. It is discovered now that he returned
  in the <i>Rajapur</i> and landed a few days back, with you; but where he's
  gone they can't tell, and that is what the sergeant here is trying to find
  out. He has been to the ship, and he has seen the passenger-list, but that
  tells nothing. He came to the Southampton police also, of course, and I,
  knowing that you came over in the same boat, brought him here. I'm sure
  you'll tell him anything you may have noticed on the voyage?"</p>

  <p>"I would willingly, of course," Crook replied, "but really, I noticed
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"Never spoke to him, I suppose?" the detective asked keenly.</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"This lady and gentleman here tell me that he had very little luggage,
  kept very much to himself during the voyage, and they saw nothing of him
  after he landed except that he went to a local auction room and bought some
  wine. Is there anything you can remember to add to that, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No," Crook replied; "nothing whatever."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," replied Wickes, rising promptly. "Sorry to trouble you, of
  course, but police duty's very necessary, as you will understand. I must make
  inquiries in other directions. Buying wine would look rather like staying in
  Southampton, at least for a bit, but it's pretty certain he isn't here. Gone
  to London in all probability. Good evening!"</p>

  <p>When their visitors had gone Mr. Merrick looked across at Crook and
  clicked his tongue suggestively.</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?" he observed. "Not the police inquiries, of
  course&mdash;they're natural enough, I guess&mdash;but why does a dead sharp
  like that, a well-known tough of the highest circles in scoundrelism, anxious
  to come into the country without attracting notice from the police&mdash;why
  does that sort of man stop to buy himself a magnum of Tokay? A big hefty lump
  of a bottle to lug around, too, for a man with nothing else but a portmanteau
  of clothes, and anxious to dance around flying light. It seems to me that a
  tough like that don't buy the bottle for the sake of the wine, anyway?"</p>

  <p>It was certainly very suggestive, and Crook said so.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible," he added, "that he could have known of Hahn's little
  game, and cut into it by buying the bottle containing the jewel? It might
  almost seem like it at first. But did you hear any more about this fellow
  Pooley? Anything before I came in, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes&mdash;in a general sort of way. The detective wasn't tellin' much
  about him, but the chief constable 'lowed he was a rare tough in the heavy
  swindle way, with miscellaneous abilities. A big bill forgery, a bank
  robbery, or a gamble with stocked cards&mdash;they are all very much in his
  line, it seems, if the boodle's big enough. He isn't above bunco-steering if
  the plunder's likely to be large. He's strictly honest, they 'low, in any
  matter that there's not much to be made out of, and he only condescends to
  touch big things. Now, just you think of this. Ain't it mighty likely he's in
  this diamond ramp, and came over in the same steamer to keep an eye on you,
  while you, all innocent, took the risk of bringing the plunder over? Now,
  don't that strike you as a pretty probable guess? And if that's so, that
  green diamond was in that magnum that Mr. Pooley bought and walked off
  with!"</p>

  <p>Crook was thoughtful for a few moments before replying. Then he said, "No,
  I don't agree. It looks right enough at first sight, but not after. For how
  should he know which particular magnum that diamond was concealed in? Hahn
  himself doesn't know, plainly. He is dancing about distractedly trying to get
  hold of any of the bottles he can, and enduring all sorts of trouble in the
  search. Plainly, he depended on getting the case intact and so finding the
  jewel where he left it with no trouble. And even if he knew, and if Pooley
  knew, in what part of the case the bottle stood which contained the stone,
  how should he know the bottle when it was one among eleven, put up one after
  another at a sale? He didn't bid for any other bottles, did he?"</p>

  <p>Daisy Merrick shook her head. "I don't think he did," she said. "At any
  rate, that is the only one he bought."</p>

  <p>"Just so; and if it was impossible that he could know which of those
  bottles held the diamond, the assumption is that he didn't know that a
  diamond was in any one of them, else he would have bought the lot&mdash;or
  tried to buy them, at any rate. And if that is so, why did he buy the
  one?"</p>

  <p>But that was a conundrum that nobody could answer. After a few random
  speculations, Mr. Merrick wound up with this dictum: "Guessin's and
  wonderin's won't hoe this row. There's a great diamond in one of a few
  bottles of wine, and a dead sharp, with a natural instinct for plunder, has
  gone off with one of those bottles. That's enough. Mr. Pooley's the victim to
  go for next!"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Crook assented with a smile, "unless we find the stone in
  <i>your</i> magnum! But what I'm mostly concerned about now is where to go
  for Mr. Pooley!"</p>

  <p>With this the waiter began to lay the cloth for dinner, and there was
  silence, save for the little noise the waiter made at his work. Crook sat
  deep in thought, gazing into the fire. Presently he stood up and spoke.</p>

  <p>"Waiter," he said, "You have the London papers here, I know. Can you get
  me those London papers for the last three days or so? I suppose they'll be
  kept somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir; no, sir; not kept, sir; not very long, I should say, sir," the
  man answered. "I don't quite know what 'ud become of 'em, sir, but I'll
  inquire, if you like."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Crook answered. "If you can bring me all your London papers
  for the past three days, and bring them in half an hour, I'll give you five
  shillings."</p>

  <p>At this the waiter started off with a bounce, and there was danger of
  delay in the dinner preparations. The papers came, however, and as the
  preparations for the meal were completed, Crook examined their advertisement
  columns carefully, comparing one with another, returning to a paper already
  examined, and then comparing again. At length he selected one paper from the
  bunch, kicked the others aside, and sent the waiter for a London Directory. A
  single reference to this mighty tome satisfied him, and he rose, ready for
  dinner.</p>

  <p>"I shall make a shot in the dark," he said, "or pretty nearly in the dark,
  seeing that there's no other course left open. Wish me luck! That's my
  selection."</p>

  <p>He pointed to an advertisement nearly at the top of the "agony" column of
  the <i>Standard</i> of the day before, and Merrick, greatly mystified, read
  this:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><i>Zag</i>&mdash;Come back here again, either at one thirty
  or eight o'clock. <i>Meldon.</i></p><br>

  <p>"That your selection?" repeated Merrick doubtfully. "Well, you might tell
  me of twenty such selections without excitin' me any. What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"I won't be sure, but it may mean one thing, and that's my shot. It may
  mean an address, and that address may be Pooley's!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick shook his head. "I give that up," he said.</p>

  <p>They sat to dinner, and Crook explained in fragmentary bursts, at such
  times as the waiter was out of the room. The explanation, pieced together,
  being to this effect:</p>

  <p>"Any attempt to get at this fellow Pooley must begin with some sort of a
  guess as to what he would do first on landing quietly in England, as he has
  done. Now, such a fellow, of course, always works with confederates&mdash;the
  sort of crime he lives on is committed by accomplished gangs, invariably.
  Consequently, it strikes me that the first thing he would do would be to put
  himself in communication with his friends. How? Naturally, you would say, by
  letter; and if that is what he has done, I am off the track, and I don't see
  what to do. But there would almost certainly be objections to communication
  by letter. That sort of person doesn't stay longer in one place than he can
  help, for obvious reasons. Pooley has been out of the country for some time,
  and any attempt to communicate with his 'pals' by post would probably lead to
  a miscarriage of the letter, the falling of that letter into dangerous hands,
  and all sorts of complication. What other expedient is open to him? Obviously
  one&mdash;and one notoriously known to be used for the communications of
  persons of this kind&mdash;the 'agony' columns of the newspapers. I'm not
  sure it wasn't your own advertisement that turned my mind in that direction.
  At any rate, I resolved to look at the London papers of the last few days and
  examine any suspicious-looking advertisement. Well, here is one&mdash;the
  only really suspicious one I can see."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick took another look at it.</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to suspicion it yet," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it look a little redundant? These advertisements are paid for
  according to the number of words, I believe, and that is why they are usually
  expressed in the briefest possible language. Very good. Then why not say,
  'Come back at one thirty or eight'? That would be quite enough if the message
  meant what it seems to mean. 'Here,' 'again,' 'either,' and 'o'clock' are
  redundant. That is the first peculiarity that struck me. Then I saw another.
  Now read every other word of that advertisement, beginning with 'Zag' and
  skipping the alternate words. Then you get this message: 'Zag&mdash;Back
  again at thirty-eight, Meldon,' Now isn't that very suspicious? Meldon, of
  course, might be an assumed name, but it isn't likely. If it were a new
  assumed name the confederate would fail to recognise it, and if it were an
  old one the police would spot it; and in any case it would be unnecessary,
  for it is plain that 'Zag' in the beginning must be the identification word,
  by which the gang recognise their communications. Why shouldn't it mean an
  address? Thirty-eight, Meldon Street, or Road, or what not? And here, sure
  enough, is a Meldon Street in the London Directory, and all alone. No Meldon
  Square, or Road, or anything but this one Meldon Street. It is near Euston,
  you see, and there is a thirty-eight in the street (though the particular
  house is not entered here), for you will perceive that the 'Bell' public
  house is No. 40!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick's eyes began to sparkle.</p>

  <p>"This gets positively interesting!" he said. "Here's an adventure, or
  something mighty like it. Clear enough <i>somebody</i> has 'come back' and
  taken lodgings in London, and somebody who wishes to keep pretty close and
  secret; and the police sagaciate that Pooley must ha' gone straight to London
  after buyin' that magnum of wine. It's a chance, and I allow it's an
  adventure! Mr. Crook, I feel young again&mdash;I do! I haven't had an
  adventure&mdash;not properly to be called an adventure&mdash;for twenty-five
  years. I'm on this one if you'll let me in. Come, Daisy, d'you think you're
  equal to runnin' up to London again to-night? Isn't there a train?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Crook answered; "the last goes at nine-thirty."</p>

  <p>"Then we're on the nine-thirty to London, aren't we, Daisy? I want to take
  a look at that bottle of my own, and we'll do that to-night. And tomorrow
  we'll investigate the architectural attractions of that venerable pile,
  thirty-eight, Meldon Street, near Euston Station, London! That is, Mr. Crook,
  if that's your plan, and if I'm not intermeddlin'?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I'm delighted to have a friend at hand, of course. But you
  mustn't be disappointed if we draw a dead blank. As I said, it's something of
  a shot in the dark, though there should be something like a fair chance for
  us."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick's magnum of Tokay, late the property of McNab, being carefully
  unswathed that night from the middle of the clothes in a portmanteau, was
  found to be&mdash;just a magnum of Tokay and nothing else. It was not
  necessary to open the bottle. Carefully wiped clean with a towel and held
  against a strong electric light, the Eye of Goona, if it had been there,
  would have been detected by the keen eyes in search of it, even though it
  might have escaped the vision of a person not in the secret. Tilted on end,
  no jewel came rolling toward the thinner neck&mdash;nothing. The great green
  diamond was still to be found.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Merrick seemed rather pleased at his failure than otherwise, since
  it gave zest to the adventure he promised himself. It seemed that he would
  have been almost disappointed to find the jewel in his own bottle.</p>

  <p>"Nothing there," he said. "No! That dead sharp Pooley didn't buy that
  other magnum to play skittles with, you bet! No, sir! He's a mile deeper than
  we guess, and a fathom or two under that! Thirty-eight, Meldon Street, near
  Euston, to-morrow morning!"</p>

  <p>"Very well, we'll be there."</p>

  <p>"And disguised! Disguised, my boy! No good two passengers fresh from the
  <i>Rajapur</i>&mdash;and us especially, seeing it's the Tokay biz&mdash;no
  good us goin' cavortin' around after Mr. Pooley in boiled shirts an' new
  store clothes! Geewhiz! I'll have red whiskers!"</p>

  <p>"I think we'd better avoid the whiskers," Crook observed. "We should be
  some time getting them, and they are apt to come off at the wrong moment.
  No&mdash;we'd better waste no time disguising. We'll wear inconspicuous
  things&mdash;tweeds or the like. I've an idea that people unused to disguises
  are apt to fail to play up to them and so attract attention. I think we must
  leave that alone."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick assented on his better judgment, though with regret. Plainly
  he was feeling young again, and a disguise would have been an addition to the
  fun.</p>

  <p>The morning found the two early afoot and strolling along Portland Place,
  and so, by Park Crescent, to the Euston Road. Merrick would have had a cab,
  such was his elderly impetuosity, but the more cautious Crook dissuaded
  him.</p>

  <p>"No good getting there too soon," he said. "I expect it's the sort of
  street where strangers, so very early in the day, might be noticed; and a cab
  would cause a particular stir. A little walk will do us good."</p>

  <p>So they walked, and with no haste. They passed the Hampstead Road, took a
  turning to the left, and then another; and so came to Meldon Street.</p>

  <p>It was a decent enough street of its sort&mdash;not exactly dirty, and not
  exactly Belgravian. The houses had areas and front steps, and in more than
  one window a card with the word "Apartments" was displayed. They soon
  perceived that No. 38 must be on the left hand at the far end, and that it
  was probably the very last house before the "Bell," the public-house to which
  the Post Office Directory had already introduced Crook.</p>

  <p>"I think we should stroll casually past and turn into the pub," Crook
  suggested.</p>

  <p>No. 38 offered no information on its face. Dusty curtains, a chair-back
  visible through the first-floor window, more dusty curtains below, in the
  area-window, and that was all. Next door the "Bell" stood; and it was a
  tavern with a yard-entry at its side, and, indeed, under some part of its
  upper floors. One entrance to the bar was in this yard-entry, and it was
  clear that the yard led back into an adjoining street. Into the yard they
  turned, and looked about them.</p>

  <p>"Best to learn the ground first," observed Crook; and as the words left
  his lips Merrick snatched at his shoulder and pulled him back into the
  archway from which they were emerging.</p>

  <p>"There he is!" he exclaimed, in an excited whisper. "On him! We're on
  him!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic15"
     name="pic15"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Crook had been looking straight ahead down the yard, but Merrick had
  turned his head as they emerged from under the shadow of the passage.</p>

  <p>"He's at the window, shaving," he said. "Be careful how you show, and
  you'll see him."</p>

  <p>Crook advanced with great care and peeped. Sure enough, at the first-floor
  window of the next-door house a man was shaving at a glass suspended on the
  window frame, and as he removed his head to wipe his razor Crook saw his late
  fellow-passenger Pooley.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't seen us," Crook said; "he was intent on his work. See here,
  now. If that is a billiard-room on the first floor of this place, we are
  going to play at billiards. We should be able to see in at that window."</p>

  <p>The room Crook spoke of stood out at a right angle from the hinder face of
  the public-house building. They entered the side door of the house, ordered
  drinks, and discovered that though there was no billiard-table in the room in
  question, there was a bagatelle-board. In the circumstances billiards and
  bagataelle were all one to them; so they carried their drinks upstairs. The
  boy who would have otherwise attended them was busy with pots, and as it was
  impossible for the visitors to leave the floor above without coming under the
  eye of the landlord, they were allowed to have the room to themselves.</p>

  <p>And so they sat down to a spell of wearisome and seemingly aimless
  watching that told sadly on Merrick's patience. Pooley soon left the window
  and carried his mirror with him, and for some little while they saw nothing
  of him. The suspicion began to grow upon them that Pooley must have left the
  house, when suddenly, as they crouched, one at each side of the window,
  watching, they were amazed to see placed on the table that stood before the
  window an unmistakable big bottle. It was the magnum of Tokay, with the cork
  drawn!</p>

  <p>And now they became aware that Pooley had a visitor. For the bottle was
  taken up and set down again once or twice, and by different hands. And at
  length two heads and their pairs of shoulders bent suddenly before the
  window. Clearly Pooley and his visitor were intently examining some small
  object.</p>

  <p>What it was they could not see, though Merrick strained his neck a dozen
  ways in the attempt. The visitor's back was turned to the near side of the
  window, and shut out all possible view of the centre of interest. So the two
  remained for some little while, and then withdrew from the window as suddenly
  as they had appeared at it, leaving the bottle standing on the table.</p>

  <p>There was a pause of a few minutes, and then Pooley, now wearing a hat,
  appeared again at the table, and began, with great care, to re-cork the
  magnum.</p>

  <p>"A fresh cork," Crook observed. "I expect the other crumbled."</p>

  <p>The cork driven well home, Pooley produced sealing-wax and a candle, and
  soon had covered the cork with a broken smear that might well have passed for
  an old seal. Then he lifted a hand-bag from under the table, put the bottle
  in it, and instantly whisked the bag off into the obscurity of the room.</p>

  <p>"Enough, I think," said Crook. "They're going out with it, I believe. Our
  game of bagatelle is finished."</p>

  <p>They descended to the bar, and while Crook settled with the landlord
  Merrick watched from the entry.</p>

  <p>"They're off," he repeated excitedly, as Crook joined him. "There they
  go!" And Crook could see that Pooley and his visitor were already half-way
  down the street, Pooley carrying the bag.</p>

  <p>Then came an exciting chase through the streets leading to Euston Road.
  Crook held Merrick back till the pair ahead had turned the first corner, and
  then a run was necessary in order to get a view of them before they took a
  fresh turn. In the Euston Road Pooley called a cab; and here, in this great
  busy thoroughfare, it was easy enough to follow in another without attracting
  the notice of the enemy.</p>

  <p>The cab ahead made for Tottenham Court Road, and turned south through that
  thoroughfare, with the cab behind in close chase.</p>

  <p>"We're on it!" cried Merrick exultingly, "&mdash;or on something,
  anyway!"</p>

  <p>"Something, certainly," Crook answered thoughtfully. "But what it is I
  can't guess. I'm not sure, even though the magnum of Tokay is in it, why we
  are following that cab, except that it seems the only thing we can do just
  now."</p>

  <p>Along Tottenham Court Road, across Oxford Street, and down Charing Cross
  Road the leading hansom went, with its follower never far away. Indeed, a
  short block of traffic by the Palace Theatre brought the two into touching
  distance, and so they went the rest of the way.</p>

  <p>Across Trafalgar Square the route lay to the part of Charing Cross by
  Whitehall, and there, scarcely beyond the corner, the cab ahead swung into a
  narrow turning and pulled up. Crook's cabman was plainly a man of ready
  resource, for he refrained from following further than the mouth of the
  alley, across which he drew up his cab.</p>

  <p>"This'll be best, sir, won't it?" asked the cabman, through the
  roof-trap.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Crook answered. "You shall have an extra shilling for that.
  Wait a moment."</p>

  <p>Through the near-side window of the hansom they saw Pooley and his
  companion alight, pay their cabman, and enter a door.</p>

  <p>"Come, we're after them!" cried Crook, springing from the cab, and
  thrusting a half-crown into the driver's hand.</p>

  <p>They hurried along the passage, and saw that the building into which the
  chase had disappeared was a new one&mdash;the newest in the row; and a glance
  was enough to show that half the offices it contained were still unlet. A
  lift-cage stood before the door, but apparently there was nobody to work it,
  and up the stone staircase footsteps could be heard. A glance up the well
  showed that Pooley and his companion were ascending, a flight or two up.
  Merrick and Crook followed, getting as near as they dared without exhibiting
  themselves.</p>

  <p>The men ahead went on, flight after flight, to the very top landing. Then
  there was a knock, a door opened, and after a few indistinct words it was
  closed again. A cautious approach showed that the door bore the words,
  "Isaacs, Agent," and nothing more.</p>

  <p>All remained quiet within. Crook and Merrick looked this way and that, but
  this building offered no friendly observation point.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Crook, "here we are, and what have we gained by coming? There
  is the bottle of wine we are after, behind that door, after having been
  opened and corked again at Meldon Street."</p>

  <p>"The name is Isaacs," observed Merrick. "The sort of name you might expect
  at a place where they would come to sell a big diamond, I guess?"</p>

  <p>"But why the bottle? And so carefully re-sealed? Besides, a man like
  Pooley wouldn't come here to sell such a stone as the Eye of Goona. He'd take
  it to the Continent&mdash;to Amsterdam. He could deal more freely there, and
  get a better price. No, I don't understand this move at all. There is an
  empty office just below&mdash;under Isaacs's. If we are to wait, we may as
  well wait there, where we can get out of sight if necessary."</p>

  <p>They went to the room Crook had indicated, and waited. There was no sound
  from above; they waited and still they waited, and ere long waiting grew
  tiresome.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Crook at last, "I want my lunch, and I vote we put an end to
  this. The police want Pooley, and we have found him. New Scotland Yard is
  close by, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>From the room above came a long-drawn human sound that was neither a sigh,
  nor a sob, nor a shriek, but which had something of the character of each.
  Then silence. Then a loud burst of ear-piercing laughter&mdash;mad, screaming
  laughter&mdash;that continued in paroxysm after paroxysm, till it would seem
  that human lungs could hold out no longer. After that there was silence
  again.</p>

  <p>Crook and Merrick stared at each other, puzzled and amazed. Then suddenly
  came from above a flood of rapid, incoherent and high-pitched words, not one
  of which could be clearly distinguished; and again the loud sobbing sigh that
  had first startled them. And through it all there was a strange, unpleasant,
  almost unbearable tone of demoniac hilarity.</p>

  <p>"Like all the yells in an insane asylum squeezed into one," whispered
  Merrick; and even as he spoke the laughter came again&mdash;in choking,
  uproarious fits&mdash;horrible, ghastly fits.</p>

  <p>"What's this doing up above?" Merrick exclaimed, awe-stricken. "We can't
  stop and hear such sounds. Shall we knock?"</p>

  <p>Crook laid his hand on his companion's arm, and listened again. There came
  a long ripple of chuckles, growing louder and louder, and in the end changing
  into a burst of high, tuneless singing&mdash;such singing as might come from
  a man on the rack, in his delirium.</p>

  <p>"There must be at least three men in there," said Crook; "but that is all
  one voice, and the others are silent. We'd better not wait any longer. What
  the matter is I can't guess, but even if it is the diamond we must risk it.
  I'll stay. You go downstairs at your hardest and bring Wickes from New
  Scotland Yard. Jump into the first cab&mdash;it's close by, but lose no
  time&mdash;and bring more than one man. Say we've got Pooley here, of
  course."</p>

  <p>Another burst of laughter came as Merrick started on his mission, and the
  sound hastened his steps. Crook stayed behind to listen, while from above
  sounds succeeded sounds of unnatural hilarity, punctuated by dead silences.
  Crook began to wonder why the other tenants were not disturbed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick hustled as he had never hustled before, and though the time
  seemed long to Crook he was back in less than ten minutes, with Wickes and
  two assistants. Crook met them on the stairs, and together they ascended the
  top flight.</p>

  <p>Even as they did so, the door before them opened, and Pooley stood before
  them, bag in hand. He sprang back instantly, but Wickes sprang too, and held
  the door open.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Wickes heartily, "good-morning, Robb&mdash;or Pooley, which you
  please! And Wide James, too&mdash;I think we must take you both along. And
  who is the happy old party?"</p>

  <p>In an easy-chair before a table a short man, with a distinctly Jewish
  face, rolled and lolled and chuckled, his eyes wide open, but his brain
  unconscious of all that passed. On the table stood the magnum of Tokay, with
  three glasses; and a safe in the corner stood open, with papers spilt before
  it. Once again the man in the chair burst into his screaming laugh, and then
  relapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>"That's the game, is it?" said Wickes, pointing to the bottle. "All right.
  I must trouble you for your wrists. Reeves&mdash;you'd better fetch a
  doctor."</p>

  <p>The state of the case began to dawn on Crook and Merrick. This was the use
  to which the Tokay was to be put&mdash;to drug a man into helplessness while
  his safe was rifled with his own keys. And Crook saw at once why Pooley had
  bought the Tokay as an instrument of business, for a drug that would be
  detected in more familiar drink would be taken readily in so rare and
  unaccustomed a wine as Tokay, whose flavour would probably be unknown to the
  victim.</p>

  <p>Presently the doctor arrived, and after a sniff or two at a glass
  pronounced the words "Indian hemp&mdash;and something else with it."</p>

  <p>That told more. Pooley had brought the drug from India, and it was a drug
  in which the famous Indian hemp&mdash;<i>bhang</i> or
  <i>hashisch</i>&mdash;had the chief part; the drug that brings on laughing,
  yelling, happy delirium, and leaves its victims broken and exhausted. It grew
  plain, in fact, that it was the need of some likely drink in which to
  administer the stuff that led Pooley to speculate in the Tokay.</p>

  <p>At first it seemed difficult to understand how the three could have drunk
  together and only one suffer from the drug. But a further discovery made that
  plain. For the stuff was contained in a little rubber ball with a protruding
  spout, which Pooley could hide in his palm, and so doctor a glass of wine or
  not, as he pleased, while he poured it out. The experiments which Crook had
  witnessed through the window were no more than the tasting and testing that
  were necessary to judge of the practicability of the scheme. Isaacs had
  readily assented to the suggestion to try a glass of the rare wine which
  Pooley had with him, and so the thing was done.</p>

  <p>No diamond was found in the bottle, nor anywhere about Pooley and his new
  lodgings. He had got to work quickly enough after his return, and on a likely
  victim. For, indeed, when Isaacs came to himself, very sick and wretched, he
  was as terrified at his predicament as was Pooley himself. For, as a matter
  of fact, the bonds which the scoundrels were about to carry away were stolen
  bonds already! So that Isaacs's troubles only begun with the robbery; and as
  the law is usually severe on a receiver, they are not quite finished yet.</p>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; A BOX OF ODDMENTS</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, May 1904</h3>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">AFTER the adventure which made it plain that the mystery of
  Mr. Pooley's magnum had nothing to do with the missing green diamond, some
  little time was consumed by Harvey Crook and Mr. Merrick in unsuccessful
  attempts in different directions. Harvey Crook returned to Southampton, and,
  with the aid of Mr. Symons, the auctioneer's clerk, succeeded in wasting some
  days in a futile pursuit of the magnums of Tokay still left unaccounted for.
  Merrick also went to Southampton, but it was for a shorter time, and his
  object was to learn what had been done by the police toward the apprehension
  of Pritchard, the murderer of his old friend, Mr. Clifton.</p>

  <p>Crook left Southampton and regained London, with an idea of finding Smith,
  the wine-merchant's traveller who had bought the four magnums of Tokay, or
  his employers. Crook was by no means certain that the firm belonged to
  London, but he could see no better way of setting to work than to make
  persistent inquiries at the offices of the principal firms, by the aid of the
  London Directory. He made his list and began what promised to be a very
  wearisome search. The first day was almost wholly wasted in a tedious pursuit
  of the wrong Smith. For, in fact, one of the first firms he tried chanced to
  employ a traveller of that name, who, being discovered after a hunt of
  several hours, was found not only to be a total stranger to Southampton,
  which was not in his district, but also a total stranger to Imperial Tokay, a
  liquid of which he knew nothing except by repute. The probability had already
  struck Crook that there might be several wine-merchants' travellers about of
  the name of Smith, and now he realized the difficulty to the full.</p>

  <p>He ended his day's search in the vicinity of Euston Station, and he was
  emerging into the main road when he felt himself caught by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Well, and what's your luck with the Eye of Goona?" asked a voice at his
  elbow.</p>

  <p>The speaker was a tall man in a rather curious combination of garments. He
  wore a new tie-over coster's cap, an old bobtail coat, and excellent new
  trousers and boots. He had a blue choker where his collar should have been,
  and in his hand he carried a brown paper parcel. It was a disguise, no doubt,
  of a sort, but it did not serve for an instant to conceal from Crook the
  identity of Lyman W. Merrick, of Merricksville, Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" answered Crook. "Luck? None at all&mdash;none. But why this
  get-up?"</p>

  <p>"That's the disguise," replied Merrick, with some pride. "Rather a neat
  idea, I reckon, eh? I did try the red whiskers at first&mdash;got 'em put on
  at a theatrical place at Covent Garden&mdash;but they made my face itch
  stampin'-mad, and I just dragged 'em off as soon as I could get to hot water.
  Yes&mdash;crape-hair they called it, and I don't want any more of it,
  sir&mdash;not me. But see&mdash;you'll come and dine with us, won't you?
  We'll call a cab, and I'll undisguise."</p>

  <p>The cab was called, and Mr. Merrick positively beamed as he revealed the
  inner cunning of his disguise.</p>

  <p>"There's pretty considerable of a difficulty you see," he explained, "in
  using a disguise when you're livin' at an hotel. You attract suspicion goin'
  in an' out dressed like a tough, with varyin' colours in the whiskers. So
  I've just fixed it up like this. See?"</p>

  <p>He cut open the brown-paper parcel, and took therefrom a neat light
  overcoat and a crush hat. He put on the light coat over the old bobtail,
  buttoned it, stuffed the cap into a pocket, opened the crush hat and planted
  it on his head. Then he turned triumphantly to Crook.</p>

  <p>"How's that?" he asked. "The brown paper and the string I contribute
  toward the support of the cabman by stampin' it down on the floor and leavin'
  it there. You'd never allow I'd been disguised now, would you?"</p>

  <p>Crook was tempted to tell his friend that as a matter of fact he hadn't
  been disguised before, but Merrick's delight in his idea was so obviously
  sincere that Crook refrained from spoiling it. Instead he asked for news.</p>

  <p>"I've told you I've had no luck," he said, "and I begin to despair of it.
  I seem to be wasting my time. But as to you&mdash;why this mysterious
  disguise? After Pritchard, I suppose? Can you report better luck than I?"</p>

  <p>Merrick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," he said. "I can't. Not yet. I must admit that what's been done
  as yet the police have done. They've traced Pritchard to London&mdash;or they
  think so."</p>

  <p>"Come, this is news to me. Tell me about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, they've been pretty active, and it seems that on the night of the
  murder, when he escaped from the house, he must have bolted out into the
  country, away from Southampton. They could find no trace of him at
  Southampton, but, after a good deal of inquiry, they found that a man
  corresponding to his description took a ticket for London at Shawford, a
  little station nine or ten miles from Southampton, early the next morning,
  and travelled up by the first train, leaving Shawford at 6.32. What he'd been
  doing in the meantime they can't guess, but they haven't found that he took a
  bed anywhere, so that it seems very likely he was out all night. Well, that
  was all they could get at for a little while. Of course, all the ports are
  being watched, and so forth. But after our little adventure with 'Wide James'
  and Robb&mdash;or Pooley as he was called on the <i>Rajapur</i>&mdash;after
  that little scramble in the alley near Charing Cross, Sergeant Wickes came
  unexpectedly on what looked like a trace. But they've got no further with it,
  nor have I."</p>

  <p>"What was the trace?"</p>

  <p>"Well, of course you remember that when the police had rescued Isaacs from
  the other two, they discovered that he was just about as tough a subject as
  they were themselves. All the bonds, in fact, that they had planned to steal
  were stolen bonds already. Now the police followed up that matter, and it
  grew plain that Isaacs had been carrying on a pretty big trade in stolen
  bonds and other valuable property&mdash;about the biggest in London, in fact.
  They made inquiries of some fellow in their pay&mdash;what they call a
  'nark,' I think&mdash;who told them the names of several people who had been
  frequenting Isaacs's office, besides the two who had gone to rob him. And
  some of those whose names he didn't know he described. One of them was quite
  a new arrival, and it struck Sergeant Wickes that it sounded a bit like the
  description of Pritchard. So he communicated with Southampton, and they sent
  up a photograph of Pritchard that they had managed to root out somewhere, and
  when their spy saw that he identified it positively!"</p>

  <p>"Phew! Come, this looks like business!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, so it seemed. But it's led no farther as yet. The police won't tell
  me what they are doing&mdash;they seem to think I may spoil their game, I
  believe!"</p>

  <p>"And you haven't had any luck on your own account?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;no, I can't say I have. But I can't sit and do nothing, you
  see, so I'm watching about generally all day in this disguise. I've watched
  about the place at Charing Cross, but that don't seem very useful&mdash;the
  place is blown on now, you see. So this afternoon I came along here, and
  looked about the neighbourhood where we saw those two toughs dosing up their
  bottle of Tokay; I wondered if <i>they</i> might be connected any way with
  Pritchard. It's slow work, and I don't seem to be doin' much, I allow. But
  I'm going to do my little best, foolish as it may be, and I'm watchin'
  out!"</p>

  <p>Crook was thoughtful for a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"There is something in all this," he said at length. "Why should Pritchard
  go to Isaacs? We know all that he was supposed to have taken from Mr.
  Clifton's safe&mdash;sixty or seventy pounds' worth of notes and gold. He
  wouldn't need to go to Isaacs to sell <i>that</i>, would he?"</p>

  <p>"No, he wouldn't. You're thinking of that green diamond, I guess."</p>

  <p>"I am. It was in one of those dozen bottles, and I have already seen some
  of them opened without finding it. Also, it is not in the bottle you have.
  But we both found an unaccounted-for bottle already opened at Mr. Clifton's
  after the murder. I really think this is worth following up."</p>

  <p>"Better than your own tack?"</p>

  <p>"My own tack leads me nowhere just now. And I doubt if it's worth
  following much farther, in any case. You see, the odds are that by this time
  the rest of those bottles have been opened. People who buy a single magnum of
  such a rare old wine as that don't keep it very long before opening it, and I
  think it's more than likely that somebody has discovered that green diamond
  before now. If it is some unknown person, it is of little use for me to carry
  my search farther. If Pritchard has had it, there may be a chance."</p>

  <p>"Even if he has already parted with it to Isaacs?"</p>

  <p>"Even then, perhaps. But here we are at the hotel."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick gave an extra stamp on the brown paper, and emerged from the
  cab in most respectable guise, to the astonishment of the driver; and in two
  minutes Harvey Crook was shaking hands with Daisy Merrick, who was no doubt
  quite as glad to see him as she looked&mdash;perhaps even more so. Though,
  after all, a few days is not so long to be parted from a friend&mdash;an
  ordinary friend&mdash;is it? Daisy pushed across the table to her father a
  small square parcel-post packet, which he took and examined with some little
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"It came soon after lunch," she explained.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said. "I wasn't expecting anything, and I didn't suppose I had
  any friend in this country to send me little presents&mdash;unless some
  sportsman who bought a magnum of my wine should think it only the fair thing
  to send me back the green diamond, eh?"</p>

  <p>He tore away the paper cover and came on a small wooden box. This he
  opened, and tumbled out on the table an odd little assortment of seeds,
  cloves, pieces of glass, a cork, and similar rubbish.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" asked Merrick, staring.</p>

  <p>"This is just a fool parcel. If it was the first of April I'd understand
  it, though I don't know who'd go to the trouble of fooling me that way in
  this country, anyhow. But it <i>isn't</i> the first of April, and here is the
  fool parcel all the same!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't there a letter." asked Daisy.</p>

  <p>"No sort of a letter at all."</p>

  <p>He turned over the brown wrapping paper and shook the little box. "Nothing
  but this stuff."</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook bent over the table.</p>

  <p>"May I look at it." he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;if it will amuse you. There it is&mdash;a chip of marble,
  a cork, a bit of green glass, a bit of brass, a dead tulip flower, and the
  seeds. What do you make of that?"</p>

  <p>Crook looked closely over the strange collection, and then picked up the
  little box and smelt it.</p>

  <p>"Sandalwood," he said, laconically. "This is Indian."</p>

  <p>"Indian?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;let me count those seeds. Have you got a newspaper, or
  something white?"</p>

  <p>Daisy brought a napkin from the sideboard and spread it out on the table.
  Crook transferred to its white surface the contents of the sandalwood box,
  being especially careful not to leave behind as much as a single seed. Then
  he began arranging the various objects before him, grouping each of its kind
  together.</p>

  <p>"First," he said, "we have a piece of green glass. Then a cork from a
  bottle. Then the tulip; a red tulip, you see&mdash;blood red. Then there are
  ten cloves and eighteen other seeds, all the eighteen of one sort; they look
  like hemp seeds, though perhaps they are something else. And to end up we
  have a chip of marble, such as you might pick up in any mason's yard, and a
  little piece of brass pipe. Mr. Merrick, you said there was no letter in this
  packet, but you were wrong. This is a letter!"</p>

  <p>"A letter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a letter. An Indian object-letter, though, as you see from the
  postmark, it has been sent from a London post-office in the West Central
  district. What is more, unless I am vastly mistaken, it is concerned with the
  Green Eye of Goona! Come&mdash;this gives furiously to think, as the French
  say."</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand. What&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment. I don't understand either, just yet. But I think perhaps I
  can learn a little, with consideration."</p>

  <p>"But if these things mean a letter, and a letter about that green diamond,
  why does it come to me?"</p>

  <p>"There's a bottle of that Tokay in your luggage. Perhaps the sender thinks
  the stone is there. As to the things meaning a letter, I think that's pretty
  plain. This is a well-known means of communication among the natives in
  India, when they have anything to say that it wouldn't be safe to put into
  plain words. But I must think this over."</p>

  <p>At this moment Daisy turned to shut the drawer in the sideboard, and Crook
  seized the occasion to make a quick signal to her father. He pointed to the
  door, and then downward; and Merrick understood at once that he wished to
  speak to him out of Daisy's hearing.</p>

  <p>"Dinner's at half-past seven," said Mr. Merrick. "and there's nearly an
  hour. Daisy'll want to dress, I reckon, and I know I want a shave. If you
  want to think over that boxful of notions I guess you can do your thinking
  pretty well anywhere?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll come with you," Crook answered, "of course. We'll put the
  things back in the box, if you like&mdash;I know what they are. But these
  object-letters require a rare exercise of the imagination before their
  meaning is to be got at."</p>

  <p>Once they were well clear of Merrick's suite of rooms the American turned
  and said:</p>

  <p>"Well! And what is it all?"</p>

  <p>"What it seems to mean, in the first place, is that more people are after
  this diamond than I had supposed. There are Indian natives after it, and they
  have followed the clue pretty closely. Now who are they? Are they sent by the
  rajah to recover it, or are they men who are in the secret of its
  disappearance, and wish to get it for themselves? Does Hahn know about them,
  and if so, are they working with him or against him? All these questions are
  matters of doubt. What is no matter of doubt, however, is that these fellows
  seem disposed to go to great lengths to get the jewel. That letter, as I read
  it, is something very much&mdash;or quite&mdash;like a threat of murder!"</p>

  <p>Merrick whistled and stopped.</p>

  <p>"<i>Me</i>?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," Crook replied, "I'm afraid it looks like it, since the packet was
  addressed to you&mdash;and that is why I wouldn't offer my translation before
  your daughter. It is likely they may have learned of your second purchase of
  that magnum you have, by inquiries of McNab, the steward. But as to the
  package, just go over those objects in your mind, now. There was the piece of
  green glass&mdash;broken from a stopper, I should think. That must mean the
  diamond&mdash;I see no other meaning for it, if the letter deals with the
  diamond at all. And the cork means that they know it is in a bottle of
  wine&mdash;by implication, also, that they know you have one of the bottles.
  Then there is the red tulip. Now in India, in such messages as these, a red
  flower means danger or death, if the sense of the accompanying article
  permits of it. There may be other secondary meanings, if the flower appears
  in conjunction with certain other things, or with other flowers. But here it
  is alone, and it must bear its primary meaning. After that there are the
  seeds of two sorts; cloves, and those others that look like hemp seed. Now
  these seeds may have meanings of their own when they appear
  singly&mdash;probably they have. But when a number of such things are pitched
  in together they must always be counted&mdash;they mean nothing but figures.
  You will remember there were ten of the cloves and eighteen of the seeds.
  There we get the figures ten and eighteen. Do they suggest anything to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No, they don't. Unless it is&mdash;well, today is the eighteenth of the
  month."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. And that is just what I believe those eighteen seeds mean,
  from the context. Just consider, now. They begin by suggesting that you have
  the green diamond&mdash;the Eye of Goona&mdash;in your bottle, and that
  something unpleasant will happen to you in consequence. In other words, they
  want you to give it up. But how are you to give it up, and to whom? They must
  fix time and place. I believe those cloves and seeds represent the time, and
  since the eighteen seeds cannot represent an hour, they probably mean a day
  of the month; especially, remember, as these people are no doubt in a hurry,
  and to-day is the eighteenth. That being so, the cloves would tell the
  hour&mdash;ten. In fact, now I think of it, I am certain that I have heard of
  cloves being used before to indicate the hour in these letters. There you
  have it, then. You are to give up the Green Eye of Goona at ten o'clock
  to-night. Not very long notice, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick turned away from the barber's door and walked out of the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>"This is all square?" he asked. "You ain't pulling my leg?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I'm not. The thing seems grotesque enough to you, no doubt. But in
  India the object-letter is a matter pretty well known among those at all
  acquainted with native ways. The idea has been used here, that is all."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Then I understand that they want the diamond&mdash;which I
  haven't got&mdash;and they threaten me unless I hand it over at ten to-night.
  Where?"</p>

  <p>"That brings us to what seems in some ways the oddest part of the message.
  There is a grotesque incongruity about it, as I read it, which is quite
  fantastic. And yet that very fact tells us something about the person who
  made up the letter. See now, we have dealt with every object in the package
  but two&mdash;a chip of marble and an inch of thin brass pipe. Perhaps, as a
  stranger, you are 'gnorant of some of the later Cockney slang
  terms&mdash;more so than the person who sent this package. But surely you can
  guess something of the meaning of those two little objects? The piece of
  marble, now; doesn't that suggest a notable spot in London?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless&mdash;why, you don't mean the Marble Arch?"</p>

  <p>"I do, and that is what I think the sender of this letter means, too,
  especially when the thing is considered in conjunction with the other object
  going with it. What is it? A tube. Haven't you heard the new Central London
  Electric Railway called the Tube? And on that line is the Marble Arch
  Station. That is the place meant&mdash;the Marble Arch Station on the
  Tubel"</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick stared for a moment, and then laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Crook assented, "it sounds a little odd, no doubt, but there it is,
  and, if you can think of a better interpretation of the letter, I wish you
  would; I can't. For the thing is a letter, without a doubt. And note this,
  also. This chip of marble and the little piece of brass tube would scarcely
  be used as a direction by a person unfamiliar with London, would they?
  Inference: the Indian native who wants that diamond is either himself
  familiar with London, or is in confederation with another who is."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;why shouldn't they write an ordinary letter? The
  address is written well enough and clearly enough in English. Why not the
  letter?"</p>

  <p>"Again I think that tells us something. That letter, written in plain
  English, would be a demand with threats&mdash;a thing the police could and
  would take action on, if you brought it before their notice. As it is, it is
  a mere jumble of odds and ends, which no police officer or magistrate would
  bother to look at twice. If you were to complain of a threat contained in
  such a form as that you would be regarded as a lunatic. It is an artfully
  protected intimation. Now this suggests that the sender knows something about
  the English law in this matter, and means to avoid risk."</p>

  <p>"But how are they to know I would tumble to all their hocus-pocus?
  Because, without your help, I should never have guessed what the stuff
  meant."</p>

  <p>"Not as matters are, perhaps. But suppose you <i>had</i> found that great
  green diamond in your magnum of Tokay, don't you think you would have
  suspected the meaning of the message then? I think you would. With the worry
  of that enormous possession on your mind, your doubts as to what to do with
  it and what measures some unknown person might be taking to recover it, I
  think the receipt of that packet would strike you as a very significant
  thing, and you would have at least arrived at some vague idea of its
  purport."</p>

  <p>"And if I didn't, then somebody would kill me, eh? As I suppose they will
  try to do now?"</p>

  <p>Harvey Crook shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not that," he said, "at any rate, just yet. I think if they got
  no satisfactory reply to this letter, they'd probably follow it up with
  another a little more explicit&mdash;a few sketches, perhaps, designed to
  make their meaning plain to the meanest intelligence, so to speak. This is
  little more than a hint&mdash;a hint being safer than anything more explicit.
  But these hints seem pretty plain to me, and I think we had better answer
  this letter."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"That is not over easy. It is a far simpler thing to decipher one of these
  letters, if you have a guiding clue or two, than to devise one which shall be
  clearly understood by others&mdash;especially if you are not in the habit of
  conducting your correspondence in that way. I think we will turn up at the
  Marble Arch Station at ten and hand back the box to who ever applies for it.
  Inside the box we will put a little half-ounce bottle&mdash;we can get one at
  a chemist's&mdash;tightly corked and empty. Outside the box, though inside
  the enclosing paper, we will put their little bit of green glass. That ought
  to express the fact that the jewel is not only not in your bottle, but it is
  quite outside your knowledge. And you shall write it in words if you like, as
  well. We haven't any particular reason for secrecy, you know, except that the
  more we tell them about where the diamond is not the nearer they may be
  getting to where it is."</p>

  <p>"Well," observed Merrick, as he turned toward the barber's at last. "here
  is an adventure, at any rate; and that's what I've been asking for!"</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">DINNER went pretty quietly, and Daisy Merrick was anxious to
  know what so fully occupied the minds of her father and his guest. She was
  told readily enough that the object-letter was supposed to be a demand for
  the Green Eye of Goona, which the sender obviously imagined might be in
  Merrick's possession; but nothing was said about any implied threat. And,
  dinner finished, the return parcel was made up as Crook had suggested.</p>

  <p>"So much for the fool puzzle," observed Merrick. "and now, if they can
  read English, here is a piece of it for them."</p>

  <p>And he took a sheet of note-paper and inscribed on it in large
  letters:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Mr. Lyman W. Merrick begs leave to inform the gentleman
  who mailed him this box that he carries no jewels that do not belong to him,
  and that the only bottle of wine he has in this country contains nothing but
  the wine, if that is what the gentleman is driving at. Mr. Merrick has
  pleasure in giving the gentleman full permission to go and chase
  himself."</p><br>

  <p>The note was packed into the box with the little phial, and the whole
  thing neatly sealed. Then the two men left for die Marble Arch Station.</p>

  <p>"We shall look a rare fool pair if nobody turns up to ask for this
  packet," Merrick observed, with a laugh, as they crossed Cavendish Square.
  "The thing seems a shade ridiculous, after all, here in Cavendish Square,
  London. Don't it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we shall see," Crook replied. "If nobody comes there's no harm
  done, and nobody to laugh at us but ourselves. I think, when we come to
  Oxford Street, we had better walk apart. You take the packet and keep on this
  side of the way, and I'll cross to the other. It's pretty certain they know
  you by sight, since they know where you are staying, and, if anybody dogs or
  watches you, I can watch him, unobserved."</p>

  <p>So they walked along Oxford Street, Merrick on the north side, Crook on
  the south. They had purposely delayed their departure till the last moment,
  and ten o'clock struck as Merrick was crossing the end of Portman Street. As
  the American strolled leisurely into the light of the station, Crook crossed
  the road, with his eyes wide open for what might happen. There, sure enough,
  in the middle of the door to the booking-office stood a short, muffled man, a
  native of India, unmistakably. Merrick walked calmly past him, and the man
  turned, with a quick, nervous glance, and followed him into the
  booking-office. A cab was standing by the kerb, and Crook took a position in
  its shadow and watched. Merrick turned sharply and confronted the Hindoo, who
  instantly made a nervous bow, looking inquiringly into his face.</p>

  <p>"My name," said the American. "is Lyman W. Merrick, stayin' at the
  Langham. Did you come here to see me?"</p>

  <p>The man bowed again, more nervously than before, with a quick glance over
  his shoulder. Plainly he was a timid conspirator, and from that nervous
  glance Crook inferred that he must have a confederate near at hand. Might
  that confederate be Hahn?</p>

  <p>"Expectin' to receive a parcel, maybe?" asked Merrick.</p>

  <p>The man bowed once more, with a low-voiced assent. And then at last Crook
  saw the confederate. It was not Hahn, but an other Indian, bigger in build
  than the man in the booking-office, and clearly of another and stronger race.
  He stood in shadow near the door, an unregarded newspaper crushed in his
  hand, and his face thrust eagerly forward to watch. Crook had seen the man
  when he first crossed the road, but he had feigned to read his paper, and it
  was only now that his excited movement had allowed his dark, aquiline face
  and bristling moustache to become visible. It was a face, too, that somehow
  seemed oddly familiar to Crook, though he could in no way associate it in his
  memory with the frock coat and tall hat which the man now wore.</p>

  <p>"There's the parcel," said Merrick, placing it in the hand of the small
  man before him; and Crook saw the other Indian start visibly. "There's the
  parcel, with a note in it. I don't know what you mean, but, if you mean what
  I guess you mean, you'll know what <i>I</i> mean when you open that parcel.
  Savvy? I haven't got what you're after, Sonny Snowball, and you'd better try
  the next store."</p>

  <p>The small man scarcely stopped to bow again, but scuttled out hurriedly.
  As he passed the watcher by the door the latter snatched eagerly at the
  parcel in his hand, and the two together vanished into the night. Crook came
  from his lurking-place and rejoined Merrick.</p>

  <p>"The man," he said, thoughtfully, "the other man&mdash;there was another
  outside whom I've certainly seen somewhere. Where? Probably at Delhi, but
  there I saw thousands. Still, I remember him in particular, and&mdash;why,
  yes! I know! It was! It was Mehta Singh, who was chief minister to the Rajah
  of Goona!"</p>

  <p>"The same that was said to have cut down the thief who had almost got away
  with the green diamond?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the same! He did cut him down, in fact. Now just consider that! The
  stone found in the dead thief's hand was found to be a mere worthless
  crystal. Now, did Mehta Singh kill his own confederate, or tool, as soon as
  he had succeeded in getting the jewel, and did he make the exchange when the
  wretched creature was dead? Was that his plan for stealing the diamond and at
  the same time gaining credit for faithful vigilance? And was Hahn at his back
  through the whole transaction? Do the facts suggest anything
  else&mdash;<i>can</i> they suggest anything else, indeed?"</p>

  <p>The two men walked back along Oxford Street, in deep thought. Presently
  Crook burst into a laugh.</p>

  <p>"There's fun in it, after all," he said. "I saw the way Mehta Singh
  snatched at that package, and I verily believe he thought the Green Eye of
  Goona was in it! He couldn't hear your talk, of course, any more than I could
  myself. And, even if he could, he may not understand English. It will fall to
  the lot of that poor little Babu, his employee, to inform him that you have
  politely told him to&mdash;chase himself! I should dearly like to hear his
  rendering of that phrase in their vernacular!"</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">HARVEY CROOK was curious, and something more than curious,
  to know if any reply would be vouchsafed to Merrick's packet-message, and for
  that reason he called at the Langham Hotel the next morning, at about
  eleven&mdash;as, indeed, he had arranged to do, before parting with Merrick
  at night. Nothing whatever had been received, and Mr. Merrick showed some
  signs of restlessness at the break in his daily hunts through London. Daisy
  Merrick was making preparations for a shopping walk, and her father was
  discussing the question as to whether he should go with her or not, when a
  message did arrive for Merrick&mdash;not at all of the sort they had been
  looking for. For it was a telegram, in these words:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"CAN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR FRIEND CROOK TO COME
  IMMEDIATELY, 8 REDWAY STREET, GRAY'S INN ROAD, POSSIBLY IDENTIFY PRITCHARD.
  &mdash; WICKES."</p><br>

  <p>"Got him!" shouted Merrick, pushing the telegram into Crook's hands and
  rushing for his hat. "Come! You're the man, Crook! What could have been
  better!"</p>

  <p>Crook read the words with some excitement himself, but scarcely with
  Merrick's enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"We won't be sure just yet," he said, as he prepared to follow his friend,
  "but we'll see. At any rate, I think I can identify him if they <i>have</i>
  got him. My memory of that night at poor old Clifton's house is certainly
  strong enough for that!"</p>

  <p>No cab in London could have been fast enough for Merrick that day. The one
  they employed was really quite a brisk turnout, but it took something almost
  like force on Crook's part to restrain his friend from getting out and
  hailing some other cab half a dozen times.</p>

  <p>"The odds are we'll only get into a slower cab," Crook protested, "and we
  shall lose time changing. This horse is really smart, and, after all,
  <i>if</i> they've got Pritchard, you may be pretty sure they won't let him go
  before we come."</p>

  <p>And so in the end Merrick was persuaded to sit still, if not quiet.</p>

  <p>Redway Street, Gray's Inn Road, might almost have been another part of
  Meldon Street, Euston, to which their last adventure had led
  them&mdash;except that Redway Street seemed to have reached a shade lower
  level in the down grade from complete respectability. At one or two houses
  children played on the steps, and the cards announcing "Apartments" were as
  often as not home-inscribed, in ill-assorted capital letters. At number eight
  a little wondering group stood by the area railings, and a policeman was on
  the top front step, guarding the door. Plainly a rumour of "something up" was
  pervading Redway Street, though nobody knew quite what. Matrons with brooms
  stopped to talk and stare at number eight, and straggler after straggler
  stopped to increase the group at the gate.</p>

  <p>"We'll keep the cab in case we want it again," Crook said, and the two men
  sprang out and up the steps of the house.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Wickes?" asked Merrick, hurriedly, and the policeman at the door
  stood aside to let them pass.</p>

  <p>Wickes met them in the passage, bony, square, clean-shaven, and matter of
  fact as ever.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, gentlemen," he said; "you've been quick. I didn't expect
  you so soon. I haven't been here much over an hour or so myself. I suppose
  you'd have no difficulty, Mr. Crook, in identifying Pritchard if you saw
  him?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I think not."</p>

  <p>"Even if he were dead?"</p>

  <p>"Dead?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dead. Whether the man we have here is Pritchard or not I can't say,
  though it's likely; but dead he is, Pritchard or not. His throat's cut."</p>

  <p>Crook and Merrick stared in amaze.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd mention it, you see," the detective said, with businesslike
  cheerfulness, "in case it gave you a shock when you went into the room. These
  things do shock some people, you know. Come this way."</p>

  <p>They walked, with involuntarily hushed footsteps, to a back room, where,
  on a common iron-framed bed, a dead man lay, dabbled and terrible. The last
  time Crook had stood before such a sight was in Mr. Clifton's house, where
  this man's double crime had been committed. For Pritchard it was, as Crook
  could see at a glance. Gray and grisly he, lay there, but scarcely grayer
  than he had been when Crook first saw him in the hall of Downs Lodge; and his
  face seemed strangely commonplace and peaceful&mdash;almost grotesquely so by
  contrast with the fearful wound that lay below, and the dabbled bedclothes
  that lay about it.</p>

  <p>"Been dead since about three or four this morning, the doctor says,"
  Wickes remarked.</p>

  <p>"You <i>do</i> identify him, then? Quite positively?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;there's no doubt," Crook answered. "That is the man who
  received me that night at Mr. Clifton's house. Of that I am quite
  certain."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I thought so," Wickes replied.</p>

  <p>"Not merely from the description, you see, which wouldn't be so much to go
  on for a man like me, who had never seen him alive, but because we have found
  one or two banknotes with numbers corresponding to those missing from Mr.
  Clifton's safe. Mr. Clifton's bank people were able to do that for us, you
  see&mdash;a list of the notes."</p>

  <p>"But who has done this." Merrick asked.</p>

  <p>Wickes shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Can't say," he said. "Not yet, at any rate. The landlady found him like
  this when she came to do the bed. Thought he'd gone out. He's been going by
  the name of Neville here, it seems. The place hasn't been robbed, so far as I
  can see&mdash;we found the banknotes, as I told you. We've searched the place
  pretty closely, but everything seems quite ordinary, except two rather odd
  little packets that seem to have come by post. The odd thing about 'em is the
  way the address has been put on. See&mdash;here they are. Addresses made up
  of printed letters cut out of a newspaper."</p>

  <p>The addresses on both packets were certainly strange. They were built up
  just as Wickes described, by capital letters cut from paragraph headings in
  newspapers, and pasted in proper order to make the words.</p>

  <p>"Done to avoid betraying a handwriting, obviously," said Crook. "Anybody
  missing from the house?"</p>

  <p>Wickes looked a little oddly at Crook.</p>

  <p>"You're not slow at these things," he said.</p>

  <p>"One lodger is out&mdash;an Indian, named Jatterji."</p>

  <p>"Now look here," cried Crook, suddenly, with a curious excitement. "One of
  those postal packets is flat and the other is square&mdash;a box, probably.
  See if I can guess what you found in that box. A piece of green glass; a red
  flower; perhaps a cork&mdash;perhaps not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," interrupted Wickes, quickly, "no cork!"</p>

  <p>"No cork then, but a chip of marble, some cloves, some seeds, and a bit of
  brass tube!" Wickes was plainly amazed. "So we did," he said. "But it seems
  to me you know more about this case than I guessed, Mr. Crook. We shall want
  to know all that!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;of course you shall know," Crook replied. "But first let me
  see the things for myself. You haven't lost any, of course. See, here are the
  cloves, Merrick&mdash;ten! And here are the seeds. Let us count. You had
  eighteen!"</p>

  <p>They counted together. There were only seventeen seeds.</p>

  <p>"That was a summons for the seventeenth!" exclaimed Crook. "And see the
  postmark&mdash;it was received on the morning of the seventeenth&mdash;a day
  before you got yours. Now let us see the other packet. That, you see, was
  delivered yesterday, the eighteenth, just as yours was. What is it?"</p>

  <p>The second and smaller packet contained a sheet of paper with a rough
  drawing of a diamond on it, coloured green. Underneath were the words, again
  spelled out in letters cut from newspapers.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">"BRING IT TO TUBE STATION, MARBLE ARCH,<br>
  TO-NIGHT AT NINE, IF YOU WISH TO SAVE YOURSELF."</p><br>

  <p>"This is the second demand," Crook said.</p>

  <p>"More explicit, you see. What I said you would probably have received if
  you had taken no notice of the first. I should guess that Pritchard must have
  been terribly frightened at receiving the first, but he didn't quite tumble
  to its full meaning, and didn't know what to do. Then came the second, and he
  neglected that, too&mdash;no doubt trying to invent some way of escape, and
  thinking to keep safe by staying at home. You see, the time is just an hour
  before <i>your</i> appointment. They tried you, in the meantime, on the
  chance of the stone possibly being in your possession, and both shots
  failing&mdash;this was the result."</p>

  <p>And Crook pointed to the figure in the bed. They turned away, and Wickes
  came after them.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't go, gentlemen," he said. "I must have an explanation of all
  this before you go. In another room, of course, if you don't like this, but I
  must have an explanation."</p>

  <p>"Quite right&mdash;you shall," Crook replied.</p>

  <p>"Come into another room, and I'll tell you. But first do anything you
  can&mdash;wire or send or what not&mdash;to find Mr. Jatterji, the lodger
  here. The odds are," he continued, turning to Merrick. "he's the man you met
  last night&mdash;Mehta Singh's assistant. You see, he addressed <i>your</i>
  packet in his own handwriting&mdash;it didn't matter. But here, his writing
  might have been recognized, so he fell back on the printed letters. We'll
  explain, sergeant, as soon as you please. But first, does the landlady give
  you any information of value?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much. Pritchard has been here, under the name of Neville, ever
  since he reached London, I should say. He kept altogether to himself and had
  no visitors. This last day or two he shut himself completely up in his
  room."</p>

  <p>"Those packets were the reason for that," Crook replied, "and I think we
  can explain why. But it will take a little time."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, it took about twenty minutes, at the end of which
  time Sergeant Wickes had the heads of the matter at command sufficiently well
  to write a very complete "docket" that evening. And the resources of Scotland
  Yard were turned to the tracing of Mr. Jatterji.</p>

     name="story7"></a>VII. &mdash; MR. SMITH'S MAGNUMS</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, June 1904</h3>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">DUNCAN MCNAB, chief steward of the <i>Rajapur</i>, was a man
  who, as we have seen, never allowed to pass an opportunity of making or
  saving a penny, or even the half of that sum. The thrifty care which kept him
  at his post on the ship at Southampton when he might have obtained leave,
  because leave would have meant not only a railway fare out of his own pocket,
  but payment for his own board and lodging, while remaining on duty would save
  both&mdash;that same thrifty care caused him rather to welcome than otherwise
  the delay in the repair of the <i>Rajapur</i>. For it meant a few more days'
  free board and a few more days' pay to take&mdash;unless he were paid off
  summarily, which was not unlikely. But days went, and he still remained, to
  his very great content.</p>

  <p>It had been an uncommonly good voyage on the whole for McNab. Tips had
  been more plentiful and larger than usual, for it was not often that the
  <i>Rajapur</i> carried so many passengers of a well-to-do sort as she had
  carried on this last voyage, thanks to the Durbar and the overfilling of the
  mail-ships. And now, after profiting from the ship's good fortune in this
  respect, McNab was making a trifle more out of her misfortunes. Truly
  everything seemed going very well with McNab, and there was only one thing
  with which he was inclined to reproach himself&mdash;his lack of boldness in
  speculating in Tokay. Plainly that had been a great chance lost. He had only
  ventured so far as to speculate on a single magnum at the sale&mdash;and that
  with much misgiving that he was wasting his money. But this bottle, although
  it had only cost him nine shillings, had sold readily for five pounds, and
  McNab was consumed with angry regrets on two accounts&mdash;first, because he
  had not bought more magnums when he might have had them, and second that he
  had not made Mr. Merrick pay more than five pounds for the one he had sold
  him.</p>

  <p>What it could be that made the magnums of wine so valuable McNab could not
  imagine; indeed he did not try, for he was far from being a man of
  imagination&mdash;he would have repelled that imputation with scorn.
  Certainly he never dreamed of such a reason as the concealment of a priceless
  jewel in one of the bottles. It was sufficient for McNab that here was quite
  a little crowd of people inquiring for those particular bottles of wine, and
  ready to pay a high price for them, too. In the first place, Mr. Merrick had
  given two hundred pounds for the dozen. That, figured the brooding McNab, was
  at the rate of 16 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. a magnum.</p>

  <p>True, he had immediately afterward sold off eleven of the dozen at about
  nine or ten shillings apiece, but there was no accounting for the
  eccentricities of American millionaires, who could afford that sort of thing.
  Indeed, had not that same millionaire been glad soon afterward to pay five
  pounds to get back one of the bottles? He ought to have been made to pay
  more&mdash;certainly he should have paid more, reflected McNab. There had
  been all sorts of people after that bottle since then, and he might have made
  his own price.</p>

  <p>Mr. Crook had been one of them&mdash;the man who had originally sold the
  dozen for two hundred pounds; clearly <i>he</i> knew the value of the wine.
  Then there was a mysterious man&mdash;a foreigner, McNab supposed&mdash;the
  man whom Crook had afterward described, and whom he had called Hahn. He had
  made higher offers than anybody&mdash;spoke casually of giving eight or nine
  pounds a magnum, for any that he could get, and spoke in such a way that the
  shrewd McNab guessed very well that he would easily go higher. Lastly, the
  very auctioneer's clerk himself, one Symons, had found him out, and had
  offered first a sovereign, and then two, for the magnum he supposed he still
  had, or any others.</p>

  <p>Of course this offer McNab laughed to scorn, but it served, at any rate,
  to prove that the t great value of this wine had become known to the clerk,
  who was anxious to make a profit out of his knowledge. Duncan McNab grew
  gloomy and savage. Why hadn't he had the enterprise of that fellow Smith, the
  man who had bought the next four lots after the first? He had paid ten
  shillings for each, and it was only that extra shilling that had choked McNab
  off the lot following the one he had actually bought.</p>

  <p>Now early on the morning of Merrick and Crook's adventure at the late
  Pritchard's lodgings in Redway Street, in London, McNab was taking an airing
  in Southampton, cogitating on these things, when he suddenly became aware of
  Hahn himself, standing on the steps of an hotel, smoking a cigar, and smiling
  and nodding recognition.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. McNab, how do you do?" cried Hahn, with a very elaborate
  cordiality. "You don't remember me, do you? I called on you on your ship to
  inquire about some wine&mdash;you remember now, don't you? You had sold it,
  you know. My name is Hahn, and I came back to my hotel&mdash;this is my
  hotel&mdash;yesterday morning. Will you have a drink, Mr. McNab?"</p>

  <p>This was an invitation to which McNab never failed to respond. Indeed, if
  it were not for such invitations, it would have been cheaper to have been a
  teetotaler. So Hahn and McNab went into the bar, and McNab drank whiskey.</p>

  <p>"Yes," pursued Hahn, who seemed uncommonly&mdash;even
  feverishly&mdash;communicative, "yes, I came here early yesterday morning,
  and registered in the office just before twelve. I&mdash;I took a
  sitting-room, as well as a bedroom, and told them to book it from that time;
  and I had lunch here. I've been in the place, in fact, ever since. By the
  way, what's the day of the month?"</p>

  <p>"Nineteenth," replied McNab.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, Thursday the nineteenth. I might have known. I shouldn't
  have expected to find you in Southampton so long, Mr. McNab!"</p>

  <p>McNab explained the reason of the delay.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;yes, most unfortunate," Hahn commented. "Most unfortunate. And
  yet if it had not been for that little accident I should not have had the
  pleasure of meeting you here, Mr. McNab, on the nineteenth&mdash;Thursday the
  nineteenth&mdash;after being at this hotel since midday yesterday, which was
  the eighteenth. So if you'll finish your glass, Mr. McNab, we will have it
  refilled! It all goes down in my bill, you see; I'm staying here, since
  yesterday morning&mdash;the eighteenth."</p>

  <p>McNab did not wholly understand Hahn's frequent references to the date and
  time of his arrival at the hotel, but he quite appreciated the whiskey, not
  to mention the comforting reflection that he was a shilling ahead as a
  consequence of the encounter.</p>

  <p>"I think you remember me now, Mr. McNab," Hahn resumed. "I offered you a
  good price for that bottle of wine, you know, didn't I? Eight or nine pounds
  I'd have given, or even a bit more, for that magnum of wine, or any others
  like it. You've neyer seen any since, have you?"</p>

  <p>McNab shook his head gloomily. "I have not, Mr. Hahn," he said. "Not a
  bottle whatever. You'll be vairy fond of that Tokay wine, I'm thinkin'?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, of course," Hahn replied. "As a collector, of course. I'd give
  high prices for that particular case of Tokay, as a collector. I'm sorry you
  haven't been able to get any for me, Mr. McNab. I don't think I should have
  refused ten pounds a magnum, Mr. McNab. As it is, I'm sorry, both for your
  sake and mine. You might have made a good profit, and I should have been very
  glad to get the wine."</p>

  <p>This roused all the bitter regrets that the I whiskey had tended to
  mollify; and presently, after listening to a few more reminders that Hahn had
  been at the hotel since yesterday morning, and was very sorry to have missed
  the Tokay, McNab took his departure. He walked through the town toward the
  dock, and scarcely two streets from Hahn's hotel he found himself in luck
  again. For, emerging from the private bar of a public house he saw another
  person whom he recognized.</p>

  <p>It was a little man, round, oiled, and brushed, with a red, polished face,
  and large triangular checks all over his clothes. His body seemed positively
  globular on his neat little legs, his face was round, his cheeks were I
  round, his low-crowned hat, perched aside, was all brimmy curves and curls
  and high polish, and his general fulness and roundness suggested that a very
  slight accident would cause him to burst like an overripe gooseberry. And in
  this nobby little man, McNab, with a shock of astonishment, recognized Smith,
  the wine-merchant's traveller, who had bought four magnums of Tokay at the
  sale!</p>

  <p>The nobby little man went strutting along the street, and McNab went after
  him&mdash;not strutting, but galloping. Three seconds was time enough for
  McNab to recover from his surprise, three more to realize that here, within
  half a mile of each other, were the two men between whom a large profit was
  to be made, and&mdash;to catch Smith.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Hullo!" ejaculated the little man, seized by the shoulder. "What's
  up?"</p>

  <p>"Mornin', Mr. Smith! Ye'll no be rememberin' me, but I saw ye at the sale
  here at Lawson's a whiles ago, when ye bought four magnums of Tokay. I'm
  thinkin' maybe you're lookin' for a customer for they four magnums."</p>

  <p>"No," answered Smith; "I ain't."</p>

  <p>McNab's face fell.</p>

  <p>"Maybe they're sold?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"No," Smith replied, "barrin' one. I did sell one. But I've got the
  others&mdash;an' got 'em 'ere in Southampton, too. As I said, I ain't lookin'
  for a customer. But I'm open to an offer. What'll ye give?"</p>

  <p>"Fifteen shillin' a magnum," said McNab, with a wrench at his
  heart-strings.</p>

  <p>For indeed, this man had bought them at ten shillings, and it was
  positively agonizing to have to offer him more.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen shillin' a magnum; and that's a clear profit o' feefty per cent,
  for you," the steward added, with something like a groan.</p>

  <p>"<i>That's</i> no go," said Smith, decisively, with a cock of the hat and
  a turn in the direction of his journey. "I can do a lump better than that
  with 'em."</p>

  <p>"Weel&mdash;don't go&mdash;ah'm no sayin' but what I might revise the
  offer a trifle," urged McNab. "Say twa pun' ten for the three, then."</p>

  <p>"That's a five bob advance on the lot," replied Smith, whose arithmetic
  was as ready as McNab's. "Not a bit o' good&mdash;it's wastin' time. Ten
  pound for the three."</p>

  <p>"Impawsible, Mr. Smith, quite impawsible!" gasped McNab, in agony. "Such
  an awfu' sum is unreasonable!"</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;don't pay it," answered the implacable Smith. "You
  needn't, you know. <i>I</i> didn't ask you. But if you want them three
  magnums that's the price, without a penny of discount. Barring enough to pay
  for a drink," he added, liberally. "I'm willing enough to stand that."</p>

  <p>Poor McNab was shocked and amazed. That anybody but himself should
  contemplate making a large profit out of those magnums of Tokay seemed a
  wicked and deplorable thing. The notion of paying ten pounds for those three
  bottles racked him to the soul. And yet&mdash;he could make thirty pounds of
  them at the least, merely by carrying them down the street to Hahn's hotel.
  He made one last desperate attempt to secure an abatement, and then, finding
  that nothing would shake the adamantine Smith, he agreed.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the nobby little man, calmly. "They're not far off. Got
  the money with you?"</p>

  <p>Yes, McNab had the money. It was not McNab's habit to leave money or other
  valuables about in his cabin while the ship lay in dock. He was ready to
  complete the bargain.</p>

  <p>"All right, we'll go straight along," Smith said. "I'm stopping at
  Nottidge's&mdash;always do. I left the magnums there when I bought 'em,
  knowing I'd be back in a little while before I went to London. It ain't
  far."</p>

  <p>They walked together to Nottidge's Hotel, Mr. Smith humming gaily as he
  went. The little man was on Bob and Sarah terms with the entire household of
  Nottidge's, and the transaction was completed with very little ceremony.
  McNab had his three big bottles, and Smith had his ten pounds.</p>

  <p>"That's settled, signed, and sealed," said Smith, as he dropped the
  sovereigns into his pocket. "Now we'll go to the bar and get that drink I
  promised you. I'll get Bob to do those bottles up in straw and brown paper,
  if you like, so that you can carry them. What'll you have?"</p>

  <p>McNab glanced round the bar and saw a list of American drinks, the topmost
  of which was priced at eighteen pence. So he had that. Whiskey would have
  pleased him a great deal better, but would not have torn away half as much of
  Smith's ten pounds.</p>

  <p>But Smith was quite cheerful. He paid for the drinks gaily and sent the
  pot-boy to pack the magnums.</p>

  <p>"That's no bad deal for me," Smith said.</p>

  <p>"Those four bottles cost me two pound, and I got the money back before I
  left the auction rooms. Remember that murder the other day over there behind
  the town? Old gentleman named Clifton? Well, he bought one magnum of me. He
  bought one himself at the sale, and afterwards, as I was going out, he said
  he wished he'd bought another, and asked if I could spare one o' mine. 'Yes,'
  says I, 'at a price, o' course!' 'How much?' says he. 'Two pound,' says I;
  and he paid it without another word, though I fancy he looked a bit sour at
  being rooked. So I stood on velvet, you see. Them three o' yours cost me
  nothing."</p>

  <p>This was a cruel rubbing of it in to McNab. Mr. Clifton had looked sour at
  paying two pounds for a magnum&mdash;and now he, McNab the frugal, had paid
  ten pounds for three!</p>

  <p>"So that between the two of you," Smith pursued, "I did very well. Very
  well, indeed. All your ten quid's found money, you see, old chap! Not that
  I'd a let 'em go for much less; not very much less, anyhow. I might ha'
  knocked off a quid or two if you'd stood out, but, as you didn't, that's
  neither here nor there."</p>

  <p>McNab's inward writhings began to show in his face. Hahn should be made to
  pay for all this. No ten pounds a magnum from Hahn now!</p>

  <p>The expensive American drink being finished, and the bottles tied up in a
  straw-packed parcel, McNab went off for Hahn's hotel with no delay. Smith
  strolled as far as the corner of the street with him, and there stood
  watching his progress. As the little man stood there, Symons, the
  auctioneer's clerk, entered the hotel he had just left.</p>

  <p>Now, Symons had for some days been in pursuit of Smith by systematic
  means. A wine-merchant's traveller, he argued, visiting Southampton, probably
  had customers there. Therefore, steady inquiry at Southampton public-houses
  would probably yield information. Steady inquiry he began, therefore, and
  this morning he had learned that Mr. Smith, when in Southampton, usually
  stayed at Nottidge's. Smith had had four bottles of that Tokay, and, since
  Symons could count on a profit of five pounds a bottle from Crook, even if he
  paid five pounds a bottle for the wine, the businesslike Symons hoped to make
  twenty pounds at least by an interview with Smith.</p>

  <p>So that presently, as the triumphant Smith saw McNab disappear in the
  entrance of another hotel, he was touched on the shoulder, and turned to
  confront Symons.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Smith," said Symons.</p>

  <p>"My name's Symons. You don't know me, but I think we can do a stroke of
  business together. Shall we go back to Nottidge's?"</p>

  <p>So the nobby little traveller and the auctioneer's clerk went back to
  Nottidge's.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">MCNAB, with the parcel of precious magnums hugged under his
  arm, found Hahn, with a fluttering telegram in his hand, busy at the hotel
  office. Turning away hastily, he almost knocked McNab and his weighty burden
  over.</p>

  <p>"Ay, Mr. Hahn," said McNab, "ye see I'm no so long awa'. You hae luck, Mr.
  Hahn&mdash;I've three magnums o' the Tokay here!"</p>

  <p>Hahn was curiously preoccupied and excited, but he controlled himself by
  an effort.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said. "You don't say so, Mr. McNab! Three magnums?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ay, sir, three hail magnums o' the lot that was roupit at Lawson's.
  Ye shall hae 'em as reasonable as pawsible, Mr. Hahn&mdash;though I paid
  cruel dear for 'em mysel'!"</p>

  <p>Hahn looked at his watch. "And how much shall we say, then, Mr. McNab," he
  said, "for the three magnums?"</p>

  <p>"I'll juist tak' aff the wrappers," said McNab, fencing the question for
  the moment.</p>

  <p>"I'll juist tak' aff, and ye shall see the bottles yersel'&mdash;fine an'
  great bottles as they are; fine great bottles."</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," Hahn answered, impatiently. "Don't bother about
  unpacking them. How much for the lot?"</p>

  <p>McNab drew a long breath and looked hard in his customer's eye.</p>

  <p>"Feefty pun'," he said.</p>

  <p>"Right!" Hahn answered, hurriedly. "That'll do. I must run out to the bank
  and get the money. Sit down here in the hall, Mr. McNab, and wait. I may be
  gone a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes&mdash;perhaps a little more. But
  you'll be sure to wait, Mr. McNab, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ay, I'll wait," answered McNab, readily enough, and he found a seat
  while Hahn hurried out at the door.</p>

  <p>It was a noble profit, but he was angry with himself nevertheless. He
  never expected Hahn to jump so willingly at such a demand, and now he was
  consumed with vexation not to have asked more. He might as well have said a
  hundred&mdash;at worst Hahn could only have offered less. But how could any
  one have guessed that Hahn would pay such a sum? And at any rate fifty pounds
  for the three was the equivalent of the rate Merrick had paid for the whole
  case on the ship. But the consolation to be drawn from this fact was marred
  by the reflection that he, McNab, had sold this same Merrick a bottle for
  five pounds.</p>

  <p>It was a wicked thing, thought McNab, for a rich man to take advantage of
  him like that.</p>

  <p>Hahn was a long time gone to the bank, but a prospective profit of four
  hundred per cent, made McNab patient. And he had the satisfaction of scoring
  over Smith, too. For the steward had not long occupied his seat when Smith
  came puffing and hurrying in.</p>

  <p>"Ah, here you are!" cried the nobby little man. "I thought this was where
  you came. I've come to do a deal. I'll give you a profit on your bargain over
  them magnums."</p>

  <p>"Verra kind of ye, Mr. Smith," replied McNab, sweetly. "What amount of
  profit would ye be disposed to offer?"</p>

  <p>"I'll give," said Smith, "four quid a bottle."</p>

  <p>McNab shook his head with quiet enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"Na, na, Mr. Smith," he answered. "It's no go, in your ain worrds. Twenty
  pun' a bottle might do it, now."</p>

  <p>"Twenty? Pooh, nonsense! Look here, here you are, twelve
  sovereigns&mdash;no, I'll make it thirteen. Here you are, thirteen quid for
  the three!" and he shook the money in his hand.</p>

  <p>But McNab only shook his head again, and enjoyed the action. Clearly Smith
  had come to some sort of knowledge of the real value of this wonderful, this
  marvellous wine in the last half-hour. Perhaps&mdash;who could tell?&mdash;he
  had met Hahn outside, and Hahn had sent him to try to get the bottles
  cheaper. But that game wouldn't do with McNab. Hahn would have to come
  himself and pay the full fifty. No, no!</p>

  <p>"Won't take it?" queried Smith, shortly.</p>

  <p>"I sha'n't offer a cent more&mdash;I can't; wouldn't get anything out of
  it for myself if I did. You'll make more out of it than I shall, at that
  price. For the last time then, will you take the thirteen?"</p>

  <p>"For the last time, Mr. Smith," answered McNab, with a smile of amused
  superiority, "I will not!"</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;keep 'em. No harm done!" And Smith slapped the money back
  into his pocket and strutted out.</p>

  <p>Really, Hahn was a long time at the bank&mdash;a very long time. McNab
  waited and waited. He had been there more than an hour now, and the hotel
  servants were beginning to take an inquisitive interest in him. Presently one
  of the porters, after taking instructions at the office, came across and
  said, respectfully:</p>

  <p>"Was you a-waiting for anybody, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Ay," answered McNab. "For Mr. Hahn."</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Hahn's been gone an hour and more."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ay, I ken that verra weel. I'm just waiting till he comes back."</p>

  <p>The man looked surprised. "But he's gone away, sir," he said. "Gone by
  train. He sent his luggage before you came."</p>

  <p>"Eh? What? Gone by train? No, he's no gone by train. He tell't me he'd be
  back."</p>

  <p>The man looked a little doubtful at this.</p>

  <p>"I'll send and ask the boots, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"He took the luggage to the station."</p>

  <p>The boots came, and testified not only that he had carried Hahn's bag to
  the station, but that he had waited there and seen him go off by the 12.10
  train for London. There was no doubt whatever about that, the man said with
  decision.</p>

  <p>"He got a telegram," explained the porter, "and ordered his bag down at
  once, sir. The boots went off with the bag just afore you came in, and left
  Mr. Hahn payin' his bill. I see him a-talkin' to you and a-lookin' at his
  watch, an' then he ran out an' caught the train. Leastways, Boots 'ere says
  he caught it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," corroborated Boots, with all the affirmation he could muster, "he
  caught the train&mdash;I see him catch it. I see him catch it, certain I did,
  with my own eyes, myself!"</p>

  <p>There was no getting beyond this, and the speculative McNab began to
  experience an awful sinking in the stomach. The telegram&mdash;he remembered
  seeing the telegram in Hahn's hand. And now he remembered that Hahn had been
  rather oddly preoccupied, and, certainly, he had been in a great hurry to get
  away&mdash;to the bank, as McNab had fondly supposed. The two hotel servants
  stood stolidly looking into the steward's pallid face, till presently McNab
  gasped:</p>

  <p>"The bank&mdash;which is Mr. Hahn's bank in the town?" The porter looked
  at the boots, and the boots looked at the porter. Then they shook their heads
  together.</p>

  <p>"No bank, sir; not here, I should say. You see, he don't live 'ere. He's
  only been 'ere once before&mdash;a little while back. But I'll ask at the
  office, if you like."</p>

  <p>The man went over to the office and left McNab a few quiet moments wherein
  to absorb the appalling conviction that in some mysterious, wholly
  unaccountable fashion he had been&mdash;done&mdash;done. Then the porter came
  back, shaking his head once more.</p>

  <p>"He always pays his bills in cash, sir," he said, "and did to-day, with a
  note from a roll of 'em. They don't think, in the office, as he has any bank
  'ere."</p>

  <p>"Notes?" gasped poor McNab. "A roll of notes? Was't a big roll of
  notes?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say that, sir," the man answered.</p>

  <p>"They might know over at the office."</p>

  <p>Over to the office McNab went, with the porter close by his elbow, and
  asked his question about the roll of notes, explaining that Hahn owed him
  money. The young lady in the office said that the roll of notes seemed a
  pretty large one&mdash;a hundred pounds or more, she felt certain. And at
  that information&mdash;that proof that Hahn could have paid on the nail if he
  had wished to do so&mdash;the heart of McNab sank into his very boots. He
  suffered himself, unresisting, to be gently shepherded into the street, and
  there he walked up and down, hugging his hateful parcel in a daze of anger
  and despair.</p>

  <p>No wonder Hahn had been so ready to agree to a price he never meant to
  pay. But then&mdash;why come after the wine in the first place? What did it
  all mean? And surely the whole thing could not be delusion? It was not only
  Hahn who wanted the wine&mdash;there was quite a crowd after it, all willing
  to pay well. And at that thought McNab's wits came back. There was
  Smith&mdash;he had offered thirteen pounds to buy the bottles back. Come,
  there would be some profit in this thing, anyhow.</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">THAT morning, in London, after the return from the scene of
  the tragedy in Redway Street, Harvey Crook found this telegram awaiting
  him:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"THREE MAGNUMS TOKAY HERE, BUT MAY HAVE TO PAY LONG
  PRICE. HOW HIGH MAY I GO? HAHN HERE. &mdash; SYMONS."</p><br>

  <p>The Tokay interested Harvey Crook no more. The great green diamond had
  left its lurking-place in the bottle bought by poor old Mr. Clifton, and was
  now in the hands of Mehta Singh, leaving a track of murder behind it. Of that
  Crook was certain enough; the tale he had heard of Pritchard's behaviour upon
  his receipt of the mysterious object-letter, of his shutting himself up in
  his room, obviously frightened, but clinging to the stolen jewel still, his
  previous visits to Isaacs's office, and the rest of the whole
  matter&mdash;these things left no doubt in Crook's mind.</p>

  <p>So that he resolved to instruct Symons to trouble no more about the wine.
  But the tail of the message was significant. Hahn was in
  Southampton&mdash;apparently, since Symons mentioned the fact, still trying
  to buy the wine. Indeed, there seemed no reason for Symons's mentioning his
  name in connection with the possibility that a high price might have to be
  paid for the Tokay, except to suggest that Hahn's competition might raise the
  price. This would seem to indicate that Hahn was not in league with Mehta
  Singh, knew nothing of the actual situation of the Green Eye, nothing of the
  murder in Redway Street.</p>

  <p>The reflection gave Crook an odd sense of relief for which he would have
  found it difficult to give a reason. The man was a scoundrel, and Crook had
  no reason to love him; yet it was in some way a comfort to believe that he
  was not an accomplice in murder. So Crook replied to Symons thus:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"BUY NO MORE TOKAY OF THAT LOT. I WILL COME DOWN AND
  EXPLAIN. &mdash;CROOK."</p><br>

  <p>Crook felt that some compensation was due to Symons for this sudden
  rescission of his orders, and for the trouble to which he had been put. So he
  decided to run down to Southampton and settle, while he had a few unoccupied
  hours. It was because of Symons's receipt of this telegram from Crook that
  further tribulation fell on the head of McNab. When that Napoleon of commerce
  at last abandoned his forlorn perambulations before the door of the hotel
  which Hahn had abandoned, he made his best pace for Nottidge's. Smith was
  there, smoking a cigar half a foot too long for a man of his size, and
  writing a letter in the commercial room.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Smith," cried McNab, "I've changed my mind, I'll tak' your thirteen
  pun'."</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith turned round in his chair and looked up at McNab, with the cigar
  cocked up as though it were a pea-shooter directed at the steward's head. So
  he surveyed McNab for a moment, and then shook his head, solemnly.</p>

  <p>"It's no go&mdash;in my own words, as you said. No go, my cute
  friend!"</p>

  <p>"No go! But surely ye stand by your offer, man?"</p>

  <p>"I made my offer once, and you wouldn't have it. 'He that will not when he
  may'&mdash;you know that pretty little verse, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"The twal' pun' then&mdash;surely ye'll gie twal' pun'?"</p>

  <p>Smith's round, sleek head began shaking steadily again.</p>

  <p>"I'm quite sure I won't give you twelve pennies," he answered,
  deliberately. "When I made you that offer, it wasn't for the sake of the
  wine, you may be sure, else I shouldn't ha' sold it you for what I did. I
  made that offer because I had a better one, and I could ha' made a quid or
  two out of it&mdash;and so could you. But that better offer's withdrawn
  now&mdash;it's off. Consequence, I don't want the wine, and I'm perfectly
  satisfied with the transaction as it stands. <i>I've</i> done all right out
  of it!"</p>

  <p>McNab was plumbing the very deeps of despair.</p>

  <p>"But ye'll no leave 'em on my hands like this, Mr. Smith," he pleaded.
  "Ye'll relieve me of some pairt of the loss, conseederin' the
  circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"Considerin' the circumstances I'll see you blowed first. Why should I
  take any of your loss? You'd ha' made a gain if you'd taken my
  offer&mdash;and you grinned in my face when I made it! No, my boy. I'll tell
  you who it was made me the higher offer, if you like&mdash;the offer that's
  withdrawn. You can try him; go and give him a turn before I begin to get
  tired of you!"</p>

  <p>"What's his address, Mr. Smith?"</p>

  <p>"Symons, the clerk at Lawson's, auctioneer's&mdash;up by the Memorial
  Hall. Where the stuff came from first."</p>

  <p>McNab waited no more, but tore away to Symons with the fateful parcel in
  his arms. Symons was as tough as Smith. He had had an order for the wine, and
  now the order was countermanded; that was all. He wouldn't buy the three
  magnums, nor two, nor even one, at any price whatever. And he was most
  exasperatingly cheerful over the whole transaction; so that now at last,
  driven to utter madness, the unhappy McNab ranted and swore and danced on the
  office door-step, and proclaimed his wrongs aloud to all the world.</p>

  <p>"It's a conspeeracy!" he cried. "A rank, creeminal conspeeracy among the
  hail gang o' ye, sendin' me frae one to t'ither! A wicked conspeeracy to rob
  me o' my money! I'm robbit&mdash;robbit o' ten pun' by a hail gang o'
  thieving conspeerators!"</p>

  <p>So that in the end, for the credit of the office, it grew necessary to
  call a policeman to propel the vociferous victim on his way. And so at last
  he went, and Symons saw him no more. But McNab's talk of conspirators sending
  him from one to another, and the other glimpses of the day's doings which had
  been vouchsafed Symons, sufficiently aroused his curiosity to induce him to
  spend an hour in tracing the steward's adventures from Nottidge's to the
  other hotel and back again. So that when Crook arrived in Southampton that
  evening Symons was able not only to explain how Mr. Clifton came by his
  second magnum, but also to give him a pretty clear idea of the course of
  events during the day.</p>

  <p>"Hahn came into the office twice&mdash;I don't know why," said Symons.
  "Once yesterday and once early this morning. He made casual inquiries about
  that Tokay each time, but didn't seem to care what I told him, or whether I
  told him or not. Not a bit so keen on it as he was before. But he seemed very
  anxious to bring himself to my recollection, and asked me each time if I
  remembered him. And he was particular, also, to tell me each time where he
  was staying, and that he'd been there since yesterday morning&mdash;the
  eighteenth, as he was careful to say. I don't know why he thought I wanted to
  know about his movements!"</p>

  <p>Crook also could not account for it till an idea struck him. And then the
  idea was that perhaps Hahn was not innocent of complicity in the murder of
  Pritchard after all. For what could it mean, this anxiety to impress on a
  stranger his identity, the date, and the time of his stay in Southampton?
  What but a careful preparation for a later proof, if it were necessary, of
  his absence from London on the night of the eighteenth? In short, an
  <i>alibi</i>?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE GREEN EYE</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, July 1904</h3>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">HARVEY CROOK returned to London by the early morning train,
  busy with many thoughts. From what he had learned at Southampton it seemed
  probable&mdash;indeed, it grew clear&mdash;that beyond himself there was only
  one party of searchers after the great green diamond, and that Mehta Singh
  and Hahn were acting in alliance. Before the night when it had been planned
  that the wretched criminal Pritchard should be murdered for the sake of the
  jewel he carried, Hahn had been careful to travel to a place eighty miles
  distant from the scene of the tragedy, to remain there over the fatal night
  at an hotel where he was known, and to bring himself to the notice of anybody
  who could identify him. The object&mdash;to make ready for an <i>alibi</i>,
  should it be necessary&mdash;was apparent. Then on the following day, on
  receipt of a telegram, he had returned to London by the next available train.
  He had been waiting for that telegram, it seemed, from the first thing in the
  morning, and had inquired for it several times. So much Crook learned by
  boldly inquiring for him at the hotel, and then, on being told that he had
  gone to London, asking if he had received a telegram.</p>

  <p>Now, what could have been the purport of that telegram, and from whom
  could it have come? From whom but Mehta Singh, advising him of the successful
  accomplishment of the crime? Everything pointed in the same direction. Hahn
  had called at the auctioneer's office with inquiries as to the bottles of
  wine, in one of which the jewel had formerly been concealed; but, as Symons,
  the clerk, had said, it was plainly more with the object of making his
  presence in Southampton known than in any eagerness after the Tokay, about
  which, in fact, he seemed strangely indifferent by contrast with his earlier
  anxiety. So that, on the whole, the thing was plain enough. The murder was
  Mehta Singh's, with the aid of the docile Jatterji, and, once it was well
  over, and his own absence from the scene established in case of future
  trouble, Hahn had hastened off to share in its profits.</p>

  <p>The police must know this, Crook reflected, as soon as he could convey the
  information to Inspector Wickes. And with that reflection came
  another&mdash;that he must give up the notion of himself recovering and
  restoring the Green Eye to its lawful owner, the rajah. For, if the criminals
  escaped, the diamond would go with them; and, if they were taken, the police
  would seize the jewel. And clearly Crook's energies, if they were to be
  exerted in the matter, must be exerted on the side of the law. On the whole,
  Crook was not altogether disappointed; for, if he recovered the stone
  himself, and opened negotiations from England for its return, he would be in
  the not wholly worthy position of an unlawful possessor demanding something
  like blackmail; and, if he carried it into India, he would at best be
  dependent on the rajah's whim for his profit, and probably for his life, if
  he ventured into the snug little native state of Goona with that stone in his
  possession and no particular proof&mdash;what proof could there
  be?&mdash;that he had not himself been implicated in the original theft.</p>

  <p>Now it is just possible that the risk of this adventure might have
  attracted Crook six months ago. But something had occurred meantime which had
  caused Harvey Crook to look on many things with changed eyes. Possibly the
  reader may not have noticed it. Small blame be his if he has not. Even Mr.
  Merrick had not noticed it, in fact; but&mdash;and this was all that really
  mattered&mdash;Mr. Merrick's daughter had. More, her own view had undergone
  just so much modification that, whatever view she took of anything, Mr.
  Harvey Crook occupied the central and most important space in that view. So
  that, while for Harvey Crook a journey East, of doubtful profit, every mile
  of which would carry him farther from Daisy Merrick, presented a singularly
  unattractive aspect, that young lady's own private inclinations, had any
  supernatural means of penetrating them been available, might have been found
  ready to offer obstacles of their own.</p>

  <p>So Crook, well reconciled to the prospect of losing a profit on the
  straying diamond, came to London with none the less desire to see it
  recovered from Hahn's clutches. For Hahn, it was plain, must have been the
  moving spirit in the theft from the beginning. He it was who had tricked
  Crook into accepting the risk of its transport to Europe, and there could be
  no doubt that it was he also who had devised the plan for its abstraction
  from the Goona treasures in the Durbar camp, and had supplied Mehta Singh
  with the false crystal found in the hand of their accomplice-victim, the
  professional thief, after Mehta Singh had cut him down.</p>

  <p>Arrived in London while the morning was still young, Crook called a cab,
  with the idea of an instant visit to Sergeant Wickes at Scotland Yard. All
  down Whitehall his cab followed another, which turned into the yard first,
  and, as Crook alighted, he was surprised to perceive Mr. Merrick paying the
  driver of this first cab.</p>

  <p>"I've come to worry Sergeant Wickes," explained Merrick. "I've got tangled
  up in this adventure so far, and I want to see it right through. I haven't
  seen Sergeant Wickes since we left him at Redway Street yesterday, and I want
  news, if there is any. He won't mind, will he?"</p>

  <p>"Probably not," Crook answered, "especially as I have brought some
  information for him."</p>

  <p>Wickes, by chance, was on the premises&mdash;in the act of leaving, in
  fact. He heard all Crook had to tell him with great interest. Yesterday's
  inquiries after the Hindoos, he admitted, had led to nothing as yet, and he
  saw readily enough that Hahn might well supply another clue leading in this
  direction, if his movements after leaving Southampton could but be
  traced.</p>

  <p>"We know the train he came by," Wickes said, thoughtfully, "and, if he
  took a cab at Waterloo, we can find that, too. I am immensely obliged to you,
  Mr. Crook. Meantime, gentlemen, I think, in confidence, I may show you this.
  It arrived by post, as you see, just now. Rather odd, I think."</p>

  <p>He pushed an envelope across the table, addressed simply, "Police, New
  Scotland Yard, S. W." The address itself was laconic enough, but that was not
  what startled Merrick and Crook together, but the fact that the address was
  built up with capital letters, cut from newspaper headings, and pasted on the
  envelope&mdash;just as had been done with the envelopes found in Pritchard's
  room. Crook took the envelope and opened it. Within was a sheet of paper
  inscribed in precisely the same way, in capital letters, cut from a
  newspaper, thus:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">"REDWAY STREET MURDERERS, TWO INDIANS HIDING<br>
  IN OLD HOUSE, CORNER OF LARTER STREET AND<br>
  ROOK STREET, LAMBETH. CAPTURE QUICKLY."</p><br>

  <p>"That is where I am going at once," Wickes said, rising. "If you gentlemen
  are interested, there's nothing to prevent you coming,
  too&mdash;independently, of course. You have seen the men, and may be able to
  identify them, if they are there. I have just been making arrangements in the
  matter, or you would have missed me."</p>

  <p>Wickes and a brother officer went in a hansom, and Crook and Merrick
  followed in another, perplexed and expectant. What was the meaning of this
  odd communication to the police, and who could have sent it? Was it a mere
  blind? That would soon be proved one way or the other. And yet it seemed
  wholly unlikely. If the guilty persons were using such a communication to put
  the police off the scent they would scarcely give away the important fact
  that they were Indians; that, at any rate, would be anything but a safeguard.
  And, in any case, who could have sent the note?</p>

  <p>The curious manner in which it was built up in printed letters of course
  suggested the Babu Jatterji&mdash;it was precisely the expedient he had
  adopted a day or two ago to prevent the identification of his handwriting.
  But, although it was possible&mdash;even likely&mdash;that he might denounce
  Mehta Singh to save himself, would he denounce himself at the same time?
  There was no distinction made&mdash;the note spoke of two murderers.</p>

  <p>Further, if Mehta Singh and Jatterji were together, how could the Babu
  have found an opportunity to paste up this elaborate note unobserved? This
  consideration led to another conjecture. Could it be possible that there were
  three Indians altogether, two beside Jatterji, concerned in the crime? The
  postmark gave no help at all; that was merely "London, W.C."</p>

  <p>The ride was a short one. Once over Westminster Bridge, the cab ahead
  traversed the main road for a little more than a quarter of a mile, then
  turned once to the left and again to the right, and then pulled up. Wickes
  paid the cabman and walked back to Crook.</p>

  <p>"This will be near enough," he said.</p>

  <p>"You can follow on foot. Of course, the place is watched from outside
  already&mdash;I saw to that at once."</p>

  <p>Wickes and his companion walked smartly off, and Crook and Merrick
  followed. The district was one which seemed to be in course of changing its
  character. Large manufacturing buildings were taking the place of small
  cottage-dwellings; such as remained being now squalid enough, though plainly
  at one time semi-rural, clean, and even sometimes picturesque. Here and there
  among the cottages a larger detached house stood, now either devoted to some
  sort of manufacturing purpose or standing blank and derelict. Through two or
  three such streets as these Wickes led the way, and stopped at the farther
  end of the last, where a stout hoarding enclosed a small piece of ground,
  vacant, except for a house at the extreme corner.</p>

  <p>Much demolition was going on hereabout, and the street was almost bare of
  passengers. Wickes stepped back into the road, and his companion turned the
  corner; and at once, as in response to a signal, two or three
  men&mdash;unmistakably police in plain clothes&mdash;appeared from adjoining
  corners and collected at the door of the hoarding.</p>

  <p>The door was fastened with a padlock. One of the men lifted this padlock,
  peeped into it, and then looked inquiringly at Wickes, who nodded. This done,
  the man gave a gentle rap at the door and straightway produced something from
  his pocket, applied it to the lock and opened it instantly.</p>

  <p>"Not strictly regular, perhaps," Wickes remarked to Crook, who was now
  close behind him; "but we mustn't be overceremonious in a case like
  this."</p>

  <p>The ground was waste, and choked with bricks and rubbish. The house was
  fairly sound, though plainly it had not been inhabited for many years. The
  ground next the side street was bounded, not by a hoarding, but by a fairly
  high wall, and a short covered way led from the rear part of the house to
  this wall&mdash;evidently to a door which Wickes's companion had gone to
  guard.</p>

  <p>Wickes ascended the half-dozen steps and rapped smartly at the front door
  of the house.</p>

  <p>There was no response. Wickes beckoned and pointed, and the man who had
  opened the padlock now came forward and broke a pane in the window of a small
  room close by the door, inserted his arm, unfastened the catch, and, with a
  good deal of trouble, for it was long since the window had been opened,
  succeeded at last in forcing up the sash. This done, he climbed in, and
  presently, with a deal of creaking and wrenching and pulling, and much
  shuddering opposition from the old woodwork, the door stood open.</p>

  <p>"Look out there!" Wickes said, quietly, with a glance at his assistants
  waiting in the open.</p>

  <p>And at once, followed by Crook and Merrick, he entered the house. In the
  hall they paused a moment to listen. There was not a sound of any sort. They
  went a few steps farther, and listened again. Still not a sound. Wickes
  started up the stairs, followed by the others.</p>

  <p>"If they've common sense," he observed, "they'll be up-stairs in the
  daytime for the sake of the lookout&mdash;if they're here at all, of
  course."</p>

  <p>It grew plain either that the quarry had no common sense or were not in
  the house; for room after room was entered, and room after room had nothing
  for the eye but dust and grime; nothing for the ear but the sound of the
  searchers' own footsteps.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been here," observed Wickes&mdash;"and lately. You notice
  that feet have disturbed the dust a little in every room. But I fancy we're
  too late. If they were below, they must have made a bolt before this, and my
  fellows would have had them. But we'll see."</p>

  <p>Down-stairs they went, to the kitchen floor; and here it grew plain that
  the house had been tenanted recently. For crumbs littered the floor, and
  sheets of newspaper were spread, one at each end of the room, and on one of
  these lay a broken part of a loaf, still quite fresh.</p>

  <p>"See there," observed Wickes, "somebody has been sitting on each of these
  sheets of newspaper with his heels drawn up in front of him&mdash;see the
  marks? And the sheets are at opposite ends of the room, too! Now, Mr. Crook,
  you know about Indian manners and customs. What does that suggest to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Mehta Singh and Jatterji!" replied Crook promptly. "Mehta Singh would
  never sit to eat with Jatterji; even when they were not eating, he would make
  Jatterji keep the lower end of the room. These fellows might show themselves
  very civil to each other before Europeans; but leave them alone, even in such
  an awkward situation as this, and the pride of race asserts itself at
  once."</p>

  <p>But it was plain, whatever might have been, that neither Mehta Singh nor
  Jatterji were now on the premises, nor anybody else beyond the searchers. The
  front door had not been opened lately&mdash;that was plain enough&mdash;and
  the grimy windows were fast in their frames, even as the one had been through
  which Wickes's man had entered.</p>

  <p>There remained the back door into Rook Street, and an examination showed
  that that had been used, apparently, for both entrance and exit. The thick
  dust in the passage in the short covered way was trodden with footmarks in
  both directions, and the lock of the door into the street had lately been
  oiled.</p>

  <p>"We've drawn blank," said Wickes at last, "but they've been here, for
  certain. They've eaten nothing but bread&mdash;an Englishman would have
  brought in more than that, to say nothing of beer. Tramps wouldn't have
  troubled to put down newspaper to sit on, and Englishmen wouldn't have sat at
  opposite ends of the room. They've gone now, anyhow; and the next thing is to
  find how they got here. They've come with a key. We must find out how they
  got it."</p>

  <p>They turned back once more, and took a final look at the kitchen, Wickes
  and Crook narrowly examining every corner in search of further traces. In the
  drawer of the dresser they found another loaf, cut in two for convenience of
  stowage, but otherwise untouched, and wrapped in a piece of clean white
  muslin cloth; and by its side lay a bottle, less than half full of water.
  Clearly the fugitives had been making no luxurious picnic.</p>

  <p>As they turned to leave the kitchen again, Crook perceived, in a dark
  angle behind the door, what at first he took to be a scrap of white paper. He
  reached and turned it over, and so found it to be only a similar piece of
  similar muslin cloth to that in which the bread was wrapped. Something seemed
  to be in it, and, as he pulled it toward him by a corner of the muslin that
  something rolled out.</p>

  <p>And it was a green stone&mdash;a brilliant green stone, an oval-cut stone
  an inch and a half long!</p>

  <p>"Look! look at that!" cried Crook, springing to his feet with the jewel
  extended in his hand. "Look! In this muslin! On the floor!"</p>

  <p>"Gee-willikins!" cried Mr. Merrick, mouth and eyes at their widest. "The
  Green Eye of Goona!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic16"
     name="pic16"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-16.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>All three men stood aghast, and even the stolid lock-breaking policeman
  was startled out of his habitual serenity, and exhibited signs of lively
  interest in the discovery.</p>

  <p>"I think I must take charge of that," Wickes said, presently. "It must go
  to the Yard as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth should they leave it behind them?" asked Merrick.</p>

  <p>Wickes shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Impossible to guess," he said. "No matter how much of a sudden bolt they
  may have made, this would be easy enough to carry. And more than that, I
  should have expected one of them to keep it somewhere securely about him, not
  to leave it lying anywhere loose on the floor like this. But that we shall
  find out&mdash;perhaps. This is satisfactory enough as far as it goes, but
  what we want is to put our hands on the men. This is merely lost
  property&mdash;immensely valuable, no doubt, but not what we started
  after."</p>

  <p>The discovery was so wholly unaccountable that Wickes at once began
  another complete search through the house, including cellars, cupboards,
  outhouses, and every possible place wherein a man might hide. It seemed
  incredible that the stone should have been left thus. But their second search
  ended even as the first. Not a living thing beside themselves was in that
  house or about it.</p>

  <p>And so they left the derelict house, perplexed and bewildered. The place
  was made fast again, and the men were put unobtrusively on the watch once
  more; for, since the jewel had been left behind, it seemed all the more
  likely that the fugitives would return to the place to recover it.</p>

  <p>A few inquiries in the neighbourhood revealed the fact that the site had
  been bought by the local authority for a block of new offices, and an inquiry
  at the present offices of that body led to the further information that a
  local house-breaker had contracted to erect the hoarding and leave the site
  clear in a month.</p>

  <p>It was not far from midday when at length the house-breaker was
  found&mdash;a large, smudgy, and now rather anxious and apologetic person. He
  hoped there wouldn't be any trouble over it, he protested anxiously. He had
  the place in hand for the next month, and, as long as he got cleared in time,
  he didn't think there'd be any harm in making an extra few pounds out of the
  loan of the key to a gentleman&mdash;leastways, he seemed a gentleman, quite
  a gentleman. Reassured as to his own immunity from serious tribulation in the
  matter, the house-breaker was communicative enough.</p>

  <p>A gentleman had come to him a few days ago, just as he was going off after
  finishing the hoarding. The gentleman was well-dressed and civil, and said he
  was the agent of a firm of hide merchants who were changing their warehouse,
  and wanted a place for a fortnight or so in which to stow a few bales till
  the new premises were ready.</p>

  <p>He was ready to pay five pounds down, if he could be given the key for the
  two weeks, and the house-breaker had seen no harm in closing with the
  bargain. There would be plenty of time to do his wrecking after the bales had
  been taken away, and five pounds made a handsome addition to his profit. The
  gentleman had not had the key of the hoarding, but the key of the door in the
  side wall; and that was all that the housebreaking contractor could say.</p>

  <p>In reply to other questions it appeared that the gentleman had called
  himself Mr. Turner, though, as nearly as the man could describe him, he would
  seem to have borne an uncommon resemblance to Hahn. And so at last the
  house-breaker was let go about his business, to his great relief. Wickes went
  off to make fresh mysterious arrangements of his own, and Crook and Merrick
  went off, too&mdash;to lunch.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">TWO days passed, and until the afternoon of the second day
  nothing more was heard from Wickes. Crook had business of his own to attend
  to, but found time to call once or twice at Scotland Yard&mdash;without
  finding Wickes in. As for Lyman W. Merrick, he passed those two days in
  hurrying about in hansoms, with a wild notion of helping, or at any rate, of
  seeing something of the progress of the adventure, by pure dint of rushing
  over as much of London as possible between meals. Each evening Crook dined
  with him and Daisy; and all three were equally puzzled to account for the
  doings at the old house at Lambeth; more especially, on the second evening,
  for something which Crook had learned from Wickes that afternoon.</p>

  <p>The detective called at Crook's hotel soon after four, and wished to know,
  first, if he had heard or seen anything of any of the three men they were
  after, since the visit to Lambeth. Crook had seen none of them, of course,
  nor heard news; in his turn he asked if Wickes or his men had been more
  fortunate.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," the detective replied; "I can't claim that we have had any
  very great luck. By the way, you're on the telephone here, aren't you, Mr.
  Crook?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course&mdash;in the office downstairs."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll take the number as I leave. Perhaps you'll be good enough
  to leave a message in the office when you go out, so that we can get in
  communication with you without any undue waste of time. It's identification
  I'm thinking about, you know. We're watching the docks and certain other
  places, and I quite expect one of my fellows will be arresting the wrong
  Hindoos sooner or later. Of course, we've got the landlady of the house in
  Redway Street; but she only knows Jatterji, and we haven't anybody at all who
  knows the others except you."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll do anything you like, of course."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Crook. And now see here. Here's the stone you found at the
  old house."</p>

  <p>He took the muslin packet from his pocket, unfolded it, and displayed the
  great green gem. "Here it is. Looks brilliant, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course it does!"</p>

  <p>"Precisely. So it did when we first saw it in that dirty old kitchen. So
  it did when I had another look at it myself after I left you. So it did all
  along, in fact, till this afternoon, when I put it beside a real one!"</p>

  <p>"A real one?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a real one&mdash;at Wetherby's, in Bond Street. This is a coloured
  crystal, and nothing else!"</p>

  <p>"A coloured crystal! Nonsense! Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If it's nonsense, it's Wetherby's nonsense, Mr. Crook, not mine. But
  Wetherby's the first man in the trade, and I think you'll allow him to know.
  He says it's no more a diamond than that window-glass!"</p>

  <p>Here was surprise on surprise. Could it mean that Hahn had stolen a mere
  counterfeit, after all? That all this trouble&mdash;these midnight murders,
  everything&mdash;all had been done for a valueless imitation of the real
  stone? A counterfeit, he knew, had been left behind when first the stone had
  been taken from the rajah's tent. But this&mdash;how to account for this?</p>

  <p>There could be no doubt about it, Wickes insisted. Information of any sort
  was always worth having in the service, and it struck him that no harm could
  be done by showing the stone to Wetherby; and Wetherby had declared the thing
  false at once. More, he put it among other gems of all sorts of colours,
  sizes, and qualities, and then the fact was made plain to any eye. It was the
  dullest thing in all Wetherby's shop.</p>

  <p>"That's all, Mr. Crook," Wickes concluded, rising briskly. "Of course, all
  you hear is in strict confidence. And you won't forget about leaving a
  message in the office when you go out, will you?"</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was on the morning of the next day that another visitor
  called on Crook at his hotel; a visitor whom he had very little reason to
  expect. Crook had finished his breakfast, and had risen from the table, when
  a waiter approached and said:</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman asking to see you, sir. Name of Hahn."</p>

  <p>"What name?" Crook demanded, astonished and incredulous.</p>

  <p>"Hahn, sir. Leastways, that's what it seemed to me."</p>

  <p>"Show him up!" Crook replied, as the shortest way of ending the doubt.</p>

  <p>Hahn it was, though Hahn vastly altered; a great change from the Hahn who
  had visited him so short a time ago on his first arrival from Southampton.
  The man stood a picture of broken nerves and of absolutely gray funk; twenty
  years older to the view than he had seemed before. He stood silent till the
  waiter had gone, and then, plainly with an effort, he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I've come," he said, "to make an&mdash;an arrangement. Let us settle this
  matter between us."</p>

  <p>"What matter is this?"</p>

  <p>Hahn made a faint gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"We needn't waste time," he said. "You know what I mean. The green
  diamond&mdash;the Eye. We've both been after it, and I've got it. But I'm
  going to share with you&mdash;fairly."</p>

  <p>"Have you got it here?"</p>

  <p>"No; but I know where it can be got. You can get it. I'll trust your
  honour, if you'll give me your word. And we'll share."</p>

  <p>"Why are you willing to share?"</p>

  <p>"Simple enough reason. I'm in trouble, and I want a partner. And so I'll
  share."</p>

  <p>"In trouble with the police?"</p>

  <p>"The police? No, of course not. Not the police."</p>

  <p>"Then you will be presently. They are after you. They are after you and
  Mehta Singh, and Jatterji. For murder!"</p>

  <p>Hahn made another faint sweep of the hand, and sat down.</p>

  <p>"That's nothing," he said. "I've made provision for all that&mdash;I can't
  be touched. So far from it, indeed, that I half thought of going straight to
  the police myself to get out of my trouble; but I prefer to give you a share,
  and you shall have it; half of what we can make of the Green Eye. Come, again
  I say we mustn't waste time, and to show I mean what I say, I'll put every
  card I have on the table, openly. The diamond came over&mdash;you know how,
  in the Tokay. The wine was dispersed&mdash;never mind about details now. The
  magnum with the stone in it went to the old man Clifton, and he found the
  diamond when he opened the bottle. He must have shown it to
  Pritchard&mdash;probably talked about it&mdash;and the result was that
  Pritchard killed him to get it. That you know about. Mehta Singh was with me
  in the business&mdash;that you must have guessed before this. He got the
  diamond, though the contrivance was mine&mdash;that and the plan for getting
  it to England without risk to ourselves. Mehta Singh came over with me; but,
  if I could have got the diamond for myself, of course, I would have left him
  in the lurch. You remember, don't you, that I offered to divide with you
  before&mdash;when you told me you had sold the bottles, and I thought you had
  the stone?"</p>

  <p>"I do remember, quite well. A very pleasant scoundrel you are, too, my
  respectable Hahn, even by your own showing."</p>

  <p>Hahn shook his head and his hand again impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about all that," he said. "Scoundrel, rascal, anything you
  please. This is business I'm talking, and, to put my cards on the table, as I
  said I would, I must tell you it all. If I could have got the diamond, as I
  have said, I would have made it my own. But Pritchard got it, and I couldn't
  find Pritchard. I was following the bottles just as you were, and, when I
  heard of that murder, I saw the meaning of it&mdash;guessed it, if you like;
  at any rate, I knew that Pritchard had got the stone. But it was Mehta Singh
  who found Pritchard&mdash;through Jatterji, almost by chance, I believe. He
  managed to set artful inquiries going in the Indian colony&mdash;it's a small
  one, all in touch together&mdash;and he found that this fellow Jatterji was
  actually lodging in the same house as Pritchard. Well, he told me, and he
  made his own plans. But just about that time I discovered the whereabouts of
  another magnum&mdash;the one your friend Merrick has&mdash;and, as even Mehta
  Singh had no occasion to waste a murder, he arranged with Jatterji to test
  the off-chance thus offered as well, before making the definite plunge on
  what I felt to be the moral certainty of Pritchard. What happened you know
  well enough. Mehta Singh got the diamond. But I tell you I had nothing to do
  with Mehta Singh's crime&mdash;I was many miles away at the time&mdash;I
  arranged to be&mdash;and I can prove it. I had nothing to do with
  it&mdash;planning or execution."</p>

  <p>"Nothing except to take the profits?"</p>

  <p>"That, of course, if I could get them," replied the unabashed Hahn. "Why
  not? Moreover, I have another card with the police. Not only was I far away
  when the crime was committed, not only did I have nothing to do with it, but
  I took steps to have the murderers arrested; gave the police information,
  which again I can prove."</p>

  <p>"How prove it? By describing your letter of information?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right."</p>

  <p>"A note built out of capital letters cut from a newspaper? In an envelope
  addressed in the same way?"</p>

  <p>Hahn started slightly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know it, do you?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes&mdash;that was it."</p>

  <p>"Hahn, you grow a bigger scoundrel with every sentence."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut! what does it matter? Mehta Singh had done his work, and he
  could be dispensed with; safer out of the way. I am putting my cards on the
  table, I tell you. There is nobody here but you, and that doesn't matter. You
  are my partner, or will be&mdash;for you'll accept my offer, of course. I
  arranged for an empty house in which Mehta Singh and Jatterji could hide, and
  in which they could be taken by the police&mdash;after I had got the diamond
  from Mehta Singh, of course."</p>

  <p>"Oh! you did that before you sent your precious printed and pasted letter,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. That was the proper way, you see."</p>

  <p>"And how did you get the diamond?"</p>

  <p>"Simple stratagem. You remember that when it originally vanished from the
  rajah's tent, a neat imitation took its place? Well, I had had that prepared
  beforehand. But I had another made also. Mehta Singh didn't know that, but I
  thought it might prove useful on some later occasion, as it has done. I had a
  telegram from him while I was away&mdash;a telegram can be dropped into a
  letter-box, you know, at the cost of a little delay, and nobody can identify
  the sender. Well, I came up and went to the old house at Lambeth, in the
  evening, and there, in the dark, the simplest possible bit of sleight-of-hand
  did the trick. Mehta Singh produced the diamond, and he thought he got it
  back; but what he got was the other thing. I left him and sent to the police
  the little note that you know of. It might have turned out inconvenient,
  after all, if things had gone well, to have my writing recognized, so I used
  the printed letters.</p>

  <p>"But things didn't go quite as well as they might have done. Mehta Singh
  must have discovered what had happened very early the next morning. For when
  I went that morning to Liverpool Street to get my ticket for Holland and to
  see when my train would start, there were Mehta Singh and Jatterji waiting
  for me in the booking-office! It must have been Jatterji who advised that
  move. He would know that Holland would be the place anybody in Europe would
  make for with a stolen diamond to deal with. He knows European ways
  thoroughly, and though I believe he's been acting in mere terror of Mehta
  Singh all along, he wasn't so frightened as to forget that.</p>

  <p>"Well, that was three days ago, Crook&mdash;three days ago exactly, now;
  and from that moment they have never left me, day or night. They are watching
  for me now, somewhere outside. Will you send for a drop of brandy, Crook? I
  am nearly breaking down."</p>

  <p>Crook sent for the brandy and watched Hahn take it at a gulp. Then the
  tale went on.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go back to where I was staying," Hahn said, "because the stone
  is there&mdash;hidden. I had no luggage with me when I went to Liverpool
  Street, and I believe that is why I haven't been murdered yet. Mehta Singh
  wants to get me with all my movables together, so as to be sure of getting
  the stone. I know where the diamond is, but it's death for me to get it.
  Crook, it has been awful! Three days and nights I have been dogged and
  watched everywhere, and I don't believe they've slept once&mdash;I haven't,
  though I've taken beds at lodging-houses, just as I stand. I've tried all
  sorts of dodges&mdash;hansoms, offices with doors at the back,
  everything&mdash;but they've stuck to me through it all, and now I feel about
  run down; and, besides, the money I had about me is nearly gone. So I've made
  up my mind to sacrifice half, and to take you for partner; so my misfortune's
  your luck. As I said, I half thought of going to the police, seeing how safe
  I've made myself, but I don't want to risk their turning over everything
  where I'm staying, and, perhaps, coming on the diamond. That would need a
  deal of explanation, you see. So on the whole, I'm going to let you have
  half, and we'll do it like this, and put Mehta Singh safely into the hands of
  the police at the same time. First of all, I'll remain here while you go off
  to where I've been staying, and get the diamond. See?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Hahn," said Crook, standing before him with his hands in
  his pockets; "I think I've heard about enough of your confidences, and I
  don't want any more. I'll make no such arrangement as you seem to
  expect."</p>

  <p>"What? Won't you? What? Not take half? How much do you want, then?"</p>

  <p>"I want none at all, incomprehensible as it may seem to you. You
  may&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it's straight, I tell you! Really, it's straight! You shall hold the
  stone yourself all the time&mdash;I'll trust you, if you don't trust me.
  We'll go to Holland together, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no, we won't," Crook interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I'll have nothing to do with the business, I tell you; not if you give me
  the whole diamond twice over. Now, see here. You've come here and made
  yourself my guest, though you weren't asked, and you've made me your
  confidant, though I didn't want that either. But as it stands, you've taken
  me into your confidence, and, though you are a repulsively foul rascal, I
  sha'n't betray that confidence of my own motion. Understand, I'll have
  nothing whatever to do with you or the diamond you have stolen, and I
  recommend you strongly to go to the police before they come to you. Now,
  here's your choice. Come voluntarily to the nearest police-station with me,
  in which case I will pledge myself to do nothing but see you safely there,
  and leave you to tell your own tale; or sit where you are, and I will send
  for the police and have you arrested&mdash;you and your Indian friends
  together. Now which will you do?"</p>

  <p>Hahn was astonished, wholly lacking comprehension of any man who would
  refuse such an offer as he had made. But he understood well enough that Crook
  meant what he said, and presently, after a sullen pause, he rose,
  heavily.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "If that's how you put it, I'll come. I'm safe
  enough, anyway, and I simply go with information of those two fellows."</p>

  <p>They went down-stairs together, and at the door Crook hailed a distant
  cab. But now Hahn, standing moodily and suspiciously by his side, changed his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"I won't go with you," he said. "Why should I? I'll go my own way; you go
  yours."</p>

  <p>He turned away, but instantly Crook sprang after him and seized his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"No," Crook said, "that's not so easily done. You know my conditions.
  Porter, bring that policeman!"</p>

  <p>Hahn made the beginnings of a feeble struggle; but the policeman from the
  corner reached the spot in a few strides, and Hahn struggled no more.</p>

  <p>"This man is Hahn," said Crook, "wanted in connection with the Redway
  Street murder. You know the name, don't you?"</p>

  <p>The constable had read the name in the <i>Police Gazette</i> only that
  morning, and he scented credit for an important arrest.</p>

  <p>"You'd best come quiet," he said, "and remember anything you say
  will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The man never finished the sentence. Crook felt a violent drive at his
  side, and, as he recovered, he turned and saw Hahn fall forward groaning in
  the policeman's arms; and, even as he fell, Mehta Singh stabbed again twice,
  with lightning strokes, under the left arm.</p>

  <p><a id="pic17"
     name="pic17"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403211h-images/Goona-17.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Then Mehta Singh, hatless, eyes and nostrils wide with rage, flung down
  his long knife and stepped back. Crook ran at him and seized him with both
  hands. At the clasp the Indian gave one angry wrench and then stood
  still.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "all right!" with the short, clipped accent of a
  foreigner who has learned a phrase or two by ear alone. And, as he spoke, his
  disengaged hand passed across his lips twice, forward and back. But he made
  no other sign.</p>

  <p>People came running, and more policemen. Hahn was stretched, pale and
  dripping, on the pavement, and a doctor was dragged hurriedly from within the
  hotel. The doctor ripped open the prostrate man's waistcoat, and called for
  wet cloths; but he looked up at the policeman and shook his head. For lung
  and heart were pierced, and Hahn lay dying.</p>

  <p>Mehta Singh, pushed to and fro between two policemen, swung unresistingly,
  and slowly grew pale and sweaty. His legs failed, and, before a four-wheeled
  cab could come, he, too, was laid on the paving-stones. And then Crook, at
  first puzzled, remembered how the Indian's hand had passed across his lips
  twice, forward and back. And at once it struck Crook that he should have
  known that a man of his race would almost certainly have made preparation to
  forestall the ignominy of death by hanging. Which, in fact, Mehta Singh had
  done most effectually; for both he and his victim were carried away dead.</p>

  <p>Jatterji was not to be seen, either then or later. He had fled, doubtless,
  at the first sign of Mehta Singh's attack. That attack was not difficult to
  understand. He had dogged Hahn for three days, and now he saw his prey,
  diamond and all, on the point of being snatched from his grasp by arrest. He
  had lost the diamond, but he could still take his revenge; and he took
  it.</p>

  <p>It cost Sergeant Wickes some little trouble, and it took some little time,
  to discover Hahn's late lodgings. They were found at last, however&mdash;in a
  quiet turning out of Baker Street. He had called himself Turner there also,
  it appeared. But at that point Wickes's success came to a singularly complete
  stop; for not one trace of the Green Eye of Goona was he able to
  discover.</p>

  <p>Where Hahn had actually hidden that extraordinary gem: whether or not it
  still lies there: or, if not, who has it: are mysteries as yet wholly
  unpenetrated. Certainly not for lack of search in the house near Baker
  Street, for indeed that respectable structure was almost pulled to pieces by
  Wickes's energetic assistants. But hidden or lost, found or not, nobody knows
  where now lies the Green Eye, and the Rajah of Goona still lacks the pride of
  his treasure-house.</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick was among those who were most energetic in the search for the
  lost jewel, and I believe he still harbours designs of buying up the entire
  street in which Hahn's lodgings stood, pulling it down, and analyzing every
  brick.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, it is certain that his immediate excitement at the time
  was interrupted by a serious interview with Harvey Crook on a matter wholly
  unconnected with the Green Eye of Goona; and that the interview ended in a
  perfectly satisfactory manner, and earned Lyman W. Merrick several kisses
  from his daughter Daisy.</p>

  <p>After which Mr. Merrick turned to Harvey Crook, and said:</p>

  <p>"Well, my boy, there's that last magnum of Tokay lying in the middle of my
  biggest trunk, and it seems to me that this is about the right occasion to
  open it!"</p>
