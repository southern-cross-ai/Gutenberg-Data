  <h2><a name="ch-0"
     id="ch-0"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

  <p class="first">No one in the history of the British Isles has aroused more
  interest and controversy than Mary, Queen of Scots; a good-sized library
  would be needed to house all the volumes, pamphlets and letters that have
  been written on the subject of the famous woman who reigned in Scotland for
  six years and who ended a captivity of nineteen years by the violent death
  then the penalty for political failure. Moreover, the original sources on
  which all these histories and studies are based are extremely large in
  number; it is a well-documented story. State records, private and public
  correspondence, the reports of ambassadors and spies, contemporary accounts,
  compiled by men who lived through the events they described, and satires,
  pasquinades and ballads afford such abundant data for the life of Queen Mary
  Stewart that it might well seem astonishing that there should be any doubt as
  to either her character or her career.</p>

  <p>She was, however, what she has always remained, 'the daughter of debate'.
  This name, given her by Elizabeth Tudor, aptly describes the mystery and
  confusion obscuring her story. The more closely the vast amount of material
  available for a biography of Queen Mary Stewart is studied the more insoluble
  appear the problems that for more than three hundred and fifty years have
  provoked disputes often bitter and ferocious. Yet this unfortunate woman
  lived in the public eye, surrounded by crowds of courtiers, informers,
  enemies, jailors and foolish friends. She could not eat, drink, amuse herself
  or change her gown without a dozen reports of her behaviour being circulated
  in all the Courts of Europe, and numberless conclusions drawn from her least
  action. Few lives could be subjected to this keen and constant appraisal
  without revealing some fault or folly, and much that seems of sinister import
  in Mary's story would pass unnoticed in that of a woman of less
  importance.</p>

  <p>How then did she, so surrounded and spied upon, contrive to leave behind
  her any doubt as to the merits of her doleful career? The answer appears to
  be, first, that no espionage, however skilful, no reports, however minute,
  can surprise the secrets of love and crime, always so closely kept and always
  hidden behind locked doors or in secret places; second, we have to treat with
  fallible human nature. Adept as these enemies of Mary were, experienced as
  were the foreign envoys at her Court, devious as were their means of
  obtaining information, they were often deceived and misled. As they were
  baffled by perpetual intrigues and false rumours, so those who search their
  findings are baffled, for they do not agree. Again, the contemporary
  histories of Mary's actions are far from impartial; they are extremely
  vulnerable to charges of malice, deliberate distortion of the facts, and, in
  some cases, the writers hardly pretended to write more than polemics or
  political propaganda. Moreover, with all the paper covered and all the ink
  spilled in reports and comments on Mary and her Court, we search in vain for
  the work of a trained reporter. Dramatic scenes, effective touches abound,
  but no one thought to provide some simple facts that would have helped in
  probing these exasperating mysteries. We do not know the age or appearance,
  for example, of David Rizzio; accounts vary strongly as to the personality of
  this man who was the cause of Mary's first troubles. He may have been an
  unlettered hunchback of fifty years or a handsome and accomplished young
  courtier. It is the same with Lord Bothwell; if there can be little question
  as to his character, there is much question as to what manner of man he
  was&mdash;a decadent youth or a hardy ruffian; a coarse moss trooper or a
  cynical noble trained at the vicious French Court. These are but two of the
  smaller puzzles that hamper the understanding of Mary, Queen of Scots, and
  make a straightforward narrative of her life impossible to write.</p>

  <p>The larger puzzles are those that concern the very heart of the matter;
  they are those of Mary's alleged complicity in the murder of her second
  husband, with which is bound the mystery of the 'casket letters' and the
  suffered abduction of the Queen by Lord Bothwell.</p>

  <p>No more need be written here as to the mystery of Mary Stewart. The
  following pages deal with such facts as are either proved or generally
  accepted, and, when there is conflicting evidence, or gaps in the records,
  with the probabilities suggested by common-sense reading. The tracing of the
  Queen's travels is not compatible with a minute discussion on the thorny
  points of her career; nor was it advisable to halt the narrative with
  'perhaps', 'it maybe', 'it is said', etc., that are proper to the precise
  historian. To put forward the evidence this side and that on every disputed
  incident would take several volumes the size of this. Any reader who
  mistrusts the account offered here can easily check it from the voluminous
  labours of experts. We have also to deal with two interwoven disputes; the
  first, that rent Europe, was between the Old Faith and the New Faith,
  recently established at what is known as the Reformation. No one, great or
  small, then living could escape entirely the effects of this gigantic
  struggle that included wars, persecutions, massacres, private murders,
  judicial murders, that carried famine, endemic diseases, the sacking of
  cities, the laying waste of countries, the most virulent feuds between
  families and every kind of crime. Against this lurid background was fought
  out the second dispute, that of Mary of Scotland and Elizabeth of England,
  for the sovereignty of the British Isles.</p>

  <p>This is about all the history we need have in mind when tracing the
  journeyings of this Queen who moved in a manner at once abrupt and restless,
  up and down her Northern Kingdom during her brief, distracted reign, and who
  then remained, confined in one prison after another for the rest of her life,
  thus giving herself and the follower in her steps much pause for meditation
  and reflection.</p>

  <p>The illustrations have been chosen to show, as near as possible, the
  aspect of the places Mary stayed at when she knew them. Most are taken before
  the industrial age and the immense changes that followed the expansion of
  trade and the increase in the population. The Edinburgh so carefully depicted
  by Thomas Shepherd in 1830 was not very different from the Edinburgh of Mary
  Stewart; but it has also disappeared. These charming engravings have
  therefore a considerable interest of their own. Some of the other
  reproductions are earlier in date and crude in style; some show Mary's
  castles in ruins, a hundred and fifty years ago; but ruins in far better
  preservation than the pitiful remains we see today. In centuries that had but
  few antiquarians and no public money to spend on public monuments, these
  splendid castles and palaces were either destroyed for their materials, razed
  by fire, or left to fall into decay, while any treasures they may have
  contained are scattered, either sold or looted. A very large number of these
  treasures have, however, been piously preserved and may be yet seen, either
  in national collections or at those exhibitions, held from time to time,
  where private owners generously show their priceless possessions. The relics
  of Mary, carefully guarded in this safe keeping, form an unusually large and
  rich legacy from the past to the present. Not many famous people have such a
  magnificent memorial as this dispersed, yet often brought together,
  collection of personal relics once belonging to Mary Stewart.</p>

  <p>Finally the present writer would add one more explanation; if some
  familiar incidents in Mary's story are omitted, for example, the touching
  <i>Farewell to France</i> anecdote, it is because these stories have now been
  proved to be inventions of a later age than that in which Mary Stewart
  lived.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-1"
     id="ch-1"></a><i>Part I.</i><br>
  SCOTLAND 1542-1548</h2>

  <p class="first">There is no question as to the time and place of Mary
  Stewart's birth. Mary of Guise, wife of James V, was in residence at
  Linlithgow Castle in December 1542, and there, on the eighth day of that
  month, her daughter was born; and it is in this fine palace, praised by Sir
  Walter Scott as 'far excelling' all other royal residences in Scotland, that
  our journey begins.</p>

  <p>Linlithgow is under eighteen miles from Edinburgh and the capital must be
  the starting point for most travellers. The size of the country means that
  all these famous places, so closely linked with the story of Queen Mary, are
  not far apart and it is more convenient to make excursions from Edinburgh,
  Stirling and other large centres than to endeavour to follow the complicated
  journeyings of Mary, especially as these cross and recross one another in a
  manner now extremely difficult to retrace without continually revisiting the
  same places. A diligent and erudite writer, Dr. Hay Fleming, composed an
  itinerary of Mary's travels across her small kingdom, from her arrival at
  Leith to her flight across the Solway, and this may be consulted for those
  who have a mind to follow literally in the footsteps of the restless and
  harassed Queen.</p>

  <p>But most people would prefer to content themselves with making excursions
  from some headquarters to places where a few hours' stay will satisfy all but
  the most enthusiastic curiosity. Of the many ways in which Scotland may be
  reached, all of them of interest, air travel is, given the right weather, the
  most interesting, surpassing even the fascination of the North Road. Nothing
  could be more exciting than the view of the Border from the air, on a cloudy
  day, with the night coming on and the moon coming up. The hills and hollows
  glimpsed between the drifts of vapour give one the character of the country
  at a glance. On the other hand, there is a considerable charm in taking the
  road and proceeding slowly, with leisure to absorb every detail of the
  changing scene as England changes into the Marches, a no man's land in Mary's
  time, and then into her Northern Kingdom.</p>

  <p>However the traveller gets there, we will suppose he is at Edinburgh and
  proceeding at once to Linlithgow. We shall, even in these few miles, pass
  places associated with Mary, the River Almond, scene of the fatal abduction
  of her person by Earl Bothwell, and Niddry Castle, her refuge after her
  escape from Loch Leven. But these must be left until later and no pause made
  until Linlithgow if we are to follow Mary's career in chronological
  order.</p>

  <p>Linlithgow is in every way a pleasant town. It consists of the one
  irregular street, stately church and the Palace or Castle that is a familiar
  design both in reality and legend. It is the setting of a fairy tale if we
  can trace, behind the palimpsest, the scene as it was in the year that Mary
  was born. It satisfies many dreams and visions and evokes that nostalgia for
  the past roused by ancient, silent dwellings and ancient, quiet churches.</p>

  <p>We know that had we lived in those mid years of the sixteenth century we
  should have found them as we find our own, sometimes terrible and squalid,
  sometimes glorious and lovely. It is not easy, even in Linlithgow, to forget
  the pressure of our own times, and to feel the immensity of the story of Mary
  Stewart. It requires a strong effort of the imagination to forget, today, the
  Scotland of Burns and Scott, the Scotland of the Jacobite risings, the
  Scotland of the age of industry. But if we can retreat into the past anywhere
  we can do so in this stately palace. It is in excellent repair and part of
  the west wing has escaped both the restoration by James I and VI and the
  destruction by the troops of the English in the '45.</p>

  <p>Here Mary was born and her mother's rooms are still intact. The Palace
  looks on to a courtyard where there is a rich drinking fountain, erected by
  Mary's father, James V, and this courtyard is cut across by the simple but
  noble bulk of the church dedicated to St Michael. The situation is beautiful;
  the Palace is on the site of an ancient peel tower for long used as a royal
  hunting lodge, for the surrounding park was famous for deer. It was that
  energetic hunter King David I, founder of Holyrood, who built St. Michael's
  church. A fair loch is close to the Palace, and when this noble residence was
  handsomely furnished and royally equipped it could have lacked nothing in
  comfort and luxury.</p>

  <p>But if Mary Stewart was born in splendid surroundings she was also born
  heiress to a ruined family. Her father, worthy descendant of a race
  unrivalled for brilliant qualities, died when she was a few days old, so that
  she became, in her first swaddling-clothes, Queen of Scotland. Her mother had
  been married less than five years and had already given birth to two sons who
  had died. James V had greatly hoped that this last child would be a Prince
  who could uphold the power of the House of Stewart. He was ill at Falkland
  when the news of Mary's birth reached him and this disappointment increased
  his melancholy. A gifted and sensitive man, he was overwhelmed by the
  disorders of his kingdom and struck to the heart by the defeat at Solway Moss
  inflicted on him by the English. Sighing and smiling together, he referred to
  the marriage of Margery Bruce with Walter Stewart that had brought the Scots
  throne to his ancestors and remarked that this splendid prize had 'come with
  a lass (alas) and will go with a lass', the pun glancing at the disasters of
  his House that had, the dying man believed, now been brought to ruin. His
  courtiers thought he was 'strangulated' with melancholy; some whispered
  'poison', but this accusation was a commonplace at the death of all important
  personages.</p>

  <p>James V had added to the confusion he left behind by his own reckless love
  affairs. Though Mary was his sole legitimate child, he had several
  acknowledged sons, of noble birth on the mothers' side, some of whom were
  likely to make trouble enough. One of them, James Stewart, though a child of
  seven years, was already Prior of St. Andrews; his mother was the proud
  Margaret, daughter of Lord Erskine, who made little concealment of her claim
  to have been secretly married to James V.</p>

  <p>Mary of Guise had, then, to confront a situation full of danger. The
  English were on the Border and the temper of Henry VIII was known to be
  violent and reckless; intrigues for the Regency had begun before the death of
  the Scots king and the arrogant Cardinal Beaton had a forged will in
  readiness that left him and his followers in charge of the realm. He was,
  however, violently opposed by the Earl of Arran, head of the great House of
  Hamilton, of royal descent through the marriage of his grandfather with the
  Princess Mary, daughter of James II and connected with Cardinal Beaton by
  marriage.</p>

  <p>There was a lull, however, in these tumults. The Warden of the Marches
  stayed his progress into Scotland on learning of the death of the Scots king;
  even had he not been inclined to chivalry, he could have done nothing in view
  of the weather, one word severe even for a Scots winter. Linlithgow was cut
  off by the snow-drifts that blocked the rough roads to Edinburgh and
  Stirling, and Mary of Guise had a brief leisure in which to gather her
  resources, which were considerable, for she was a woman of courage and wit,
  stately, prudent and well informed. She was then twenty-seven years of age
  and had already been married to the Duc de Longueville before she came to
  Scotland as a widow to espouse James V. She was tall, graceful, accomplished
  and pleasant. If she could feel no enthusiasm for her husband's kingdom,
  disturbed by invasions and heretics, and little for her weak and faithless
  husband himself, there was no fault to be found with her conduct. The
  insolent pasquinades hurled against her were not based on a spark of truth.
  The grossest of these, that alleged Mary Stewart to be the child of Cardinal
  Beaton, merely repeated a routine slander usually flung by the disaffected at
  the issue of great families.</p>

  <p>The frost was intense. It was not easy to keep mother and child warm in
  Linlithgow; frozen snow lay deep in the deer park and ice coated the loch,
  while such news as came through to the widowed Queen beleaguered by winter
  told of weather so harsh that the ships were icebound in Newcastle
  harbour.</p>

  <p>She had much serious matter on her hands. Already the Warden of the
  Marches, after his decorous pause, was suggesting to Henry VIII that the
  incessant war between the two kingdoms might be ended by a union between the
  infant Queen and the English Prince, a proposal far too wise to be acceptable
  in times so turbulent. Mary of Guise detested both the religion and the
  policy of the Tudor king. Naturally she turned to her own country, long
  sympathetic to Scotland; the 'auld alliance' had always been popular and the
  Lorraine Princess resolved to use all her strength to save her daughter from
  the English heretic.</p>

  <p>Her first objective was the coronation of Mary, but the 'suckling child'
  could not be moved from Linlithgow and her mother had to intrigue as best she
  might between Cardinal Beaton and the Earl of Arran, a crowd of minor but
  powerful nobles, the spying envoys from foreign Courts, and the might of
  England.</p>

  <p>Arran, weak, inconstant and simple, was a poor match for the Tudor king,
  whose aim was to obtain not only the person of the infant Queen, but the
  principal strongholds of her country. He intended to annex Scotland and was
  reckless as to the means he employed: both the Governor Arran and Beaton were
  in his way; the Earl hoped for Mary's hand for his son, and the Cardinal
  represented Rome, hateful to Henry VIII. It was not, however, easy to
  dislodge these men, or to deal with the bold and warlike chieftains who
  surrounded them. One of these, Lennox, had himself a strong claim to the
  Northern throne, he had married Lady Margaret Douglas and thus was descended
  directly from Margaret Tudor. How to use, and then how to break, these
  ambitious and turbulent men was Henry VIII's main concern. He largely
  overlooked one of his most formidable obstacles, the intense and haughty
  patriotism of the Scots.</p>

  <p>Lennox was one of those who hoped to gain power by marrying the Queen
  Dowager and was supported by the French. Indeed so intricate was the
  double-crossing that even Henry was baffled. Arran imprisoned Beaton, who
  was, however, soon set at liberty. He declared he was perfectly satisfied
  with the proposed marriage treaties between England and Scotland, but had
  entered into a secret plot, termed 'a Bond' or 'Band' by the Scots, to thwart
  Henry VIII by preventing Mary from being delivered into his hands. The Scots
  Parliament wasted time considering the terms offered, and his envoy, Sir
  Ralph Sadleyr, waited on Mary of Guise at Linlithgow. He was already
  suspicious of a plot against England. His opinion, duly put before his
  master, was that the Scots were false and crafty and easily inflamed against
  one another and against the English.</p>

  <p>Mary of Guise used craftiness herself when she received Sadleyr; she
  declared she was very content with the proposals of his master and showed him
  Mary in her nurse's arms. The clothes of the little child were removed that
  the Englishman might see that she was perfectly made. Sadleyr reported that
  she was 'goodly' and 'like to live'.</p>

  <p>It was March when Sadleyr saw the babe and the bickerings over the
  marriage debates were still violent, but on July 1st the double treaty of
  marriage and peace was signed at Greenwich Palace and sent to be ratified in
  the name of the infant Queen at Holyrood House. Roused by this, Cardinal
  Beaton increased his secret activities against Henry VIII, whose spies
  reported much anti-English feeling among the Scots. Mary was teething in July
  and still could not be moved from Linlithgow. Moreover, she had smallpox, to
  the dismay of her governor, Arran, who was permanently agitated about the
  health of his precious ward. This setback was considered, however, of little
  importance, dirt diseases being endemic. By the end of July Mary travelled to
  Stirling, a mighty stronghold, more ancient than Edinburgh and the former
  capital of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The situation of Stirling, an easy journey from Linlithgow, is splendid
  and carefully chosen for defence. Its warlike importance is shown by the
  sites of battles in the neighbourhood. Mary passed, with her nurses and
  servants, her guards and gentlemen, close to the scenes of Falkirk,
  Bannockburn and Stirling Bridge. The formidable Castle on a rock rising from
  this plain enriched by the bones of her defenders and assailants, close to
  the Forth, haunted by memories of the Bruce and Wallace, was an imposing
  citadel and a magnificent royal dwelling when Mary was brought there for
  safety. There had been rumours of a possible kidnapping from Linlithgow, a
  place not easy to defend, but Mary of Guise, always prudent, declared that
  the air of Stirling was excellent for the infant, and graciously received
  Sadleyr on his second visit. Again he was allowed to see the royal child. He
  found she was much grown, and likely to be as tall as her tall mother, and
  his report was that she was still 'right fair and goodlye'.</p>

  <p>Stirling is extremely attractive. A considerable time might be very
  pleasantly spent exploring the streets, still laid out on the ancient plan,
  with many old houses and round towers with spiral staircases, but there are
  but few relics of the early reign of Mary. Even the ruin known as 'Mares
  Work' is that of a house built in 1570, though the stones were taken from
  Camberskenneth Abbey. Much else of interest in Stirling was not there when
  the procession from Linlithgow ascended from one terrace to another to the
  Castle on the heights.</p>

  <p>This fortress on the rocks overlooking the river occupies a position
  crowned by a defensive building from earliest recorded time. Altered,
  enlarged, taken by the English and retaken by the Scots, it was the scene of
  many of the tragedies that had darkened the annals of the House of Stewart
  and therefore hardly a place of good omen for the infant Queen. The newly
  built palace was, however, not only well guarded, but commodious and
  splendidly decorated. Four of the Jameses had been born here and James V had
  come here when two years of age. It was he who had erected the modern
  residence in the French taste, where his widow and daughter were lodged in
  the summer of 1543.</p>

  <p>Much of this Palace still remains. The nobly situated fort now houses a
  garrison, and conveys a sense of implacable power, but from any vantage point
  a view is obtained, on a fine day, of a pleasant, peaceful country and the
  grandeur of the distant hills. Dating from Mary's time is the royal garden,
  the 'treading' hill, or place of punishment by death, the churchyard and many
  apartments in the much defaced and much restored Castle. Among the hideous
  deeds that took place here were the murder of the Douglas, his guest, by
  James II; the revenge of the murder of James I, on the persons of Sir Robert
  Graham and his band; and the putting to death of Murdoch of Albany and his
  sons for supposed complicity in another Stewart tragedy, the murder of the
  gay Duke of Rothesay by starvation.</p>

  <p>The double churches, East and West, still stand, and are considered among
  the finest ancient churches in a country where the Reformers diligently
  destroyed all the buildings consecrated to the old faith they could lay their
  hands on. In the days when Mary of Guise brought her daughter to Stirling
  these churches were magnificent with all the rich pomp and glorious ritual of
  the Roman Catholics. The West church was then several centuries old and the
  East church had been erected two generations before Mary's birth, by an uncle
  of Cardinal Beaton, The present state of these famous churches reveals the
  dignified beauty of the simple yet massive architecture, the transition to
  the Pointed style of Beaton's church, and the ante-chamber making two
  buildings out of what was intended for one, gives an air of fantasy to this
  impressive edifice.</p>

  <p>Stirling can show a bridge, old when Mary Stewart lodged in the Castle,
  where, in 1297, Wallace defeated the English, and close by is the ravine of
  the Bannock where this same hero secured the hotly disputed independence of
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>For this same independence Mary of Guise, a Frenchwoman, cared nothing.
  Her design to send her daughter to the protection of her own country, or, at
  least, to secure the French alliance, remained steadfast; she had little
  intention of taking seriously the treaty of peace with England proclaimed in
  Edinburgh soon after her safe arrival within the defences of Stirling. Vexed
  by Mary's retreat into a strong fortress, the English king at once set on
  foot various plans for her capture and the seizure of her kingdom. These
  included schemes to bribe her guardians, which, however, failed. A few days
  after the ratification of the treaty and the ceremonies at the Abbey Church
  at Holyrood to celebrate it, Henry was gathering together an army in order to
  invade Scotland. He quickly raised nearly twenty thousand men, who, under the
  Earl of Suffolk, set out in the traditional manner for the Border. The
  punishment of some lawless lords was the reason given for this display of
  force, but Suffolk had instructions to surprise Edinburgh, to capture the
  Cardinal and Arran, and, failing this, to lay waste the town.</p>

  <p>Henry VIII had already inflamed the Scots by seizing some of their
  merchant shipping at Newcastle, and, reports of his invasion soon leaking
  out, the citizens of Edinburgh became so excited that Sadleyr feared to have
  his lodgings burnt about him. Mary of Guise, however, was not without
  resources; a French fleet arrived at Dumbarton, bringing not only a Papal
  Legate and two Envoys from Francis I but the more material assistance of a
  number of soldiers well supplied with ammunition.</p>

  <p>At this juncture Mary was crowned in Stirling by Cardinal Beaton. The
  ceremony was simple, as befitted the poverty of the country and the perils of
  the moment. There were still those in Scotland willing to act as agents of
  England and kidnap the little Queen, and there were still others who were
  ready to take her to the Highlands for safety.</p>

  <p>During the next four years the situation remained unchanged. Lennox,
  heavily bribed, went over to Henry VIII, but most of the Scots remained
  loyal, and the English king sent two invading forces against them.</p>

  <p>Lord Hertford, the English general, brother-in-law to Henry VIII, advanced
  across the Border in May 1544. His instructions were&mdash;'put all to fire
  and sword, burn Edinburgh, after it has been looted, without tarrying over
  the Castle, sack Holyrood House, and as many towns and villages about
  Edinburgh as you may conveniently; sack Leith and put man, woman, and child
  to the sword'. This accomplished, Hertford was to lay waste Fife, and advance
  on St. Andrews&mdash;'the Cardinal's town'&mdash;and to raze it to the
  ground, leaving 'no creature alive'. The Scots, Henry VIII stated, might
  consider this as 'God's hands lighting on them' for their falsehoods.
  Hertford carried out his orders promptly. He reported that the country was
  'laid waste' to within a few miles of Stirling, but he did not press far
  beyond the Borders where the Scots Parliament had set a thousand horsemen as
  guard. Henry VIII's envoys to Scotland still protested that his invasions
  were but earnest of his love for Mary Stewart and his desire to secure her as
  his son's wife, an argument that failed to impress the Scots, whose proud
  patriotism was exasperated into fury. They declared that 'the wives with
  their distaffs' would march on 'the old enemy' rather than surrender.</p>

  <p>In September 1545 Hertford again raided Scotland, burning, slaying and
  creating with ruthless efficiency the 'devastation' his master had
  ordered.</p>

  <p>Mary of Guise continued to intrigue with France. She belonged to a family
  rapidly becoming as powerful as the royal House of Valois and she centred all
  her hopes for the future on her daughter's marriage to the Dauphin, heir to
  the French throne, but while thus engaged her immediate care was the little
  Queen, who was brought up in quiet elegance, surrounded by gentlewomen,
  children of her own age and the delicate refinements her mother had brought
  from her own country. Mary Stewart was a charming child, good natured, bold
  and already showing an 'alluring grace'. Her oval face, her sleepy eyes, her
  clear complexion and her light and fine auburn hair combined the stately
  beauty of Mary of Guise with the traditional fascination of the Stewarts. She
  was precocious and readily learned the easy arts her mother put within her
  reach. While Hertford was burning her realm and slaughtering her subjects,
  Mary was learning her letters, how to thread a needle, how to pluck a lute
  string, how to throw a ball and how to hold herself in a dance measure.</p>

  <p>Henry VIII died without having conquered Scotland, but Hertford, now
  Somerset and Lord Protector of England, still urged the match with Edward VI.
  Not satisfied with the response to his overtures, Somerset again invaded
  Scotland, September 1547. The result was the sending out of the Fiery Cross,
  and the gathering of twenty thousand Scots to meet him at Pinkie Cleugh, six
  miles outside Edinburgh, the battle taking place on the thirty-fourth
  anniversary of Flodden.</p>

  <p>The defeat of the Scots was overwhelming. Arran, their commander, was no
  more effective in the field than he had been in the Cabinet. He left a safe
  position in order to attack the enemy led by Somerset, who might be termed a
  second 'Hammer of the Scots', and the battle soon became a rout. The road to
  Edinburgh was marked by the corpses of her defenders, flung back to the very
  suburbs. The victors, stripping the slain, remarked with surprise the stature
  and beauty of the Northerners, their white skins, their bright hair, their
  girth. As in other battles with the Scots, the English had been confused by
  the plainness of the noblemen's attire; they wore 'white' (undressed or
  partly dressed) leather, with no mark of rank, whereas in other countries men
  wore the price of their lives about their necks when going into battle, their
  gold chains and glittering insignia proving that they were worth saving for
  their ransom money. But at Pinkie, as at Flodden, many noblemen were slain by
  the English in mistake for their followers. Somerset's forces included savage
  Irish.</p>

  <p>The Scots had rallied together, setting aside their internecine quarrels,
  for the protection of their country. After the defeat at Pinkie, they rallied
  again to put their Queen in a place even safer than the great fortress on the
  Forth. Shortly after the battle Mary was sent to the island of Inchmahome (or
  holm), 'the isle of peace', in the quiet water of the lake of Menteith. There
  stood a Priory and to this lovely retreat Mary was moved in September 1547,
  she being then nearly five years of age.</p>

  <p>One way from Stirling to Inchmahome leads to Aberfelds, hence to the lake
  of Menteith with the two islands. At the port of Menteith a boat may be hired
  and Inchmahome approached, as Mary approached it on that distant day of early
  autumn The trees on the island were planted a century ago to replace those
  destroyed by the zeal of Mary Stewart's partisans, who stripped them for
  'keepsakes'. Inchmahome Priory had the legendary aspect of the two places
  where Mary had already resided; it seemed out of the world. The majority of
  refined, sensitive and intelligent men and women took the vows required by
  the Church of Rome and escaped from an age of violence to such refuges as
  this isle in the lake; among these vows was that of celibacy, with the result
  that those who loved learning, art, science and meditation were barren, while
  the gross materialists, the stupid, the vicious, flourished in unchecked
  offspring.</p>

  <p>Mary was happy at Inchmahome. She had with her companions of her own age,
  especially chosen as her most intimate attendants, all bearing her name, and
  all of noble families, Mary Beaton, Mary Seton, Mary Fleming and Mary
  Livingstone. With them she played at gentle games, continued her first
  lessons and began to speak both French and Scots. Her time was passed in the
  agreeable and well-furnished guest rooms of the Priory, in the precisely kept
  gardens, under the tall trees in the uncultivated parts of the island, or
  beneath the sweet box hedges.</p>

  <p>Mary of Guise was left to face a political situation that daily worsened
  for her. Somerset, short of supplies, had withdrawn to England after the
  battle of Pinkie Cleugh; he was unable to attempt the capture of Edinburgh
  with the winter coming on and contented himself with leaving, as it was
  reckoned, fourteen thousand Scots dead on the field, or drowned in the River
  Esk. Against this deliverance Mary of Guise had to set the defection of
  Mathew Lennox, who had gone over to the English, and the continued threats of
  the Lord Protector. She appealed, in her desperation, to the Pope, as well as
  to the King of France.</p>

  <p>The persecution of the Reformers had roused a fury of revenge among their
  friends; in particular the martyrdom of George Wishart, as notable in its
  results as that of Patrick Hamilton, had inflamed the Protestants, who
  loathed Cardinal Beaton as bitterly as did the English king. At the hands of
  some of these the Cardinal was violently put to death in his Castle of St.
  Andrews. Thus Mary of Guise lost a close and powerful friend and felt at the
  same time the encroachment of the heretics, already being encouraged by the
  ferocious eloquence of a dissenting priest, one John Knox. The tragedy at St.
  Andrews was the first of the political murders to mark the reign of Mary
  Stewart; others beside the soothsayers declared that it was of ill omen.</p>

  <p>Scotland was, for the time, exhausted. Arran's rule was feeble, and his
  defeat in battle made him despised by a warlike people. The assassins of the
  Cardinal, encouraged by the English, held out in St. Andrews Castle; no mass
  could be held in Scotland while this act of sacrilege was unavenged. Even the
  coming of a French fleet to oust the heretics from their stronghold did not
  help Mary of Guise, though the French success meant that John Knox, that
  enthusiastic preacher so dangerous to the Old Faith, was sent to the French
  galleys. The Queen Dowager, indeed, between the English, the claims of
  Lennox, Hamilton, the illegitimate sons of James V, and the rise of the
  Protestants in Scotland, saw little hope for her daughter as queen of her
  father's realm. She made the bold decision to send her out of the kingdom she
  was supposed to rule and to marry her to the French prince, though such a
  step was likely enough to end in Scotland's becoming an apanage of
  France.</p>

  <p>On June 24th, 1548, the Estates sanctioned the French alliance. Mary of
  Guise agreed, willingly, to the request of Henry II, the successor to Francis
  I, that her daughter should be educated in his country under the care of her
  own mother, Antoinette of Bourbon, Duchess of Guise. In France was Mary of
  Guise's own son by her first marriage, the Duke of Longueville. All family
  ties, affectionate memory and native inclination bound the dowager Queen of
  Scotland to her native land; besides the danger from England, where the arch
  enemy of Scotland, the victor of Pinkie Cleugh, Lord Somerset, still ruled in
  the name of his nephew, the feeble son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour.</p>

  <p>Mary of Guise feared that the English, or the pirates, who often had
  letters of marque from England, allowing them to attack Scots vessels, might
  intercept the French ships sent to fetch her daughter to France. Before she
  had hidden Mary Stewart in Inchmahome English spies had thought the little
  Queen was at Dumbarton or Duneld; it was to the former place that she was now
  taken, with a princely train of Scots nobility, attendants and servants.
  Among these were Lord Erskine and Lord Livingstone and the four Marys. These
  little girls were, like the mistress whose lessons they had shared at
  Inchmahome, already for their years accomplished in the refined arts suitable
  for gentlefolk. They knew the rudiments of the polite languages, of music,
  embroidery and dancing; their deportment was already grave yet amiable. The
  first likeness of Mary Stewart is that of a small Scots coin of base metal
  struck the previous year; it shows a child with arched brows and a bare
  neck.</p>

  <p>Henry II's force now arrived in the four French galleys under the command
  of Admiral Villegaignon that had anchored at Leith. This army consisted of
  six thousand men, seasoned troops, French and mercenaries. Their leader was
  Lieutenant-General d'Essé; it was he who put his master's proposals before
  the Scots Parliament assembled at the Abbey of Haddington, close to the town
  of that name, held by the English.</p>

  <p>Arran, the nominal regent, was in favour of France, and the Queen Dowager
  had gained over to her daring plan many of the Scots lords and bishops, by
  bribery and flattery as the Reformers declared. Although the Scots Parliament
  showed an anxious and zealous regard for their ancient liberties, it
  accepted, despite the discouraging experience with Henry VIII, the French
  king's assurance that he was animated solely by horror at the outrages
  committed by the English in Scotland. Not only did the Parliament allow
  itself to be persuaded of these friendly intentions&mdash;they were willing
  to offer fortresses as guarantee of their good faith. The French had never
  infused Scotland; the fragile daughter of the late King, Francis I, had been
  the first wife of James V and had left a sweet memory, while many Scots had
  resided at the French Court.</p>

  <p>Leaving the French army to its task of driving the English out of
  Haddington, Admiral Villegaignon sailed his four galleys with martial
  splendour down the Firth of Forth, then, to avoid the English, turned north,
  rounded Scotland by the Pentland Firth, then, sailing west, made Dumbarton,
  where the two Queens were awaiting him. The Frenchman, however, gave himself
  these pains for nothing; the Protector Somerset, whose intelligence service
  was extremely efficient, knew all the French plans and did not choose to risk
  a battle. Mary of Guise received the French envoys in stately audience at
  Dumbarton and gave her daughter and train into the charge of M. de Brézé. It
  was one of the few agreeable incidents in her sad and troubled life and
  marred only by the illness of her little daughter, again struck by a feverish
  infection that the physicians disputed over. It was another attack of
  smallpox or measles.</p>

  <p>Dumbarton (or Dunbarton) on the Clyde is marked by an impressive rock,
  jutting into two peaks named after the national hero, William Wallace, at one
  time a prisoner in the fortress. On this rock there grows the wild and rare
  variety of thistle that is the emblem of Scotland. Like Stirling, Dumbarton
  was very ancient even in Queen Mary's time; there had long been
  fortifications on this fine site and its history goes beyond records. It is
  credited with being a stronghold of the primitive tribes who seized the
  valley of the Clyde after the Roman legions had abandoned the North. From the
  reign of William the Lion the great castle had been in the possession of the
  Lennox family whose power was dominant in this part of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Mary Stewart's journey from Inchmahome was short, but troublesome, owing
  to rough roads, or tracks, and the heat of summer increased the discomforts
  of the rude litters and coaches. Now the journey is easy; Linlithgow,
  Stirling, Inchmahome, Dumbarton, the four places associated with Mary's
  childhood, lie within close distance of one another, by modern conceptions of
  distance. No relics of Mary Stewart are to be discovered at Dumbarton, but
  the castle, now much altered, rests on mighty foundations on the rocks that
  are earlier than her time and the sympathetic eye can visualize the
  appearance of the splendid fortress, flying the beautiful banner of the
  Stewarts, as it rose along the waters of the Clyde where the French ships,
  with chained galley slaves, furled sails, and martial pomp lay at anchor.</p>

  <p>The weather was fair at the end of July, yet before the ships had left the
  river Lady Fleming, the little Queen's aunt, was so seasick that she begged
  to be set ashore; but the captain, mindful of the English fleet possibly
  giving chase, refused harshly, remarking that she must proceed to France or
  drown on the way. The little fleet made for the coast of Brittany, making for
  Brest or Roscoff, as the winds might allow, for the calm day was soon broken
  by storms. Most members of the little Queen's retinue were ill in the
  handsome, small and dark cabins, but this distress was softened by the
  knowledge that their precious charge was safely out of the rapacious hands of
  the English and the mounting power of the zealous Reformers.</p>

  <p>Mary Stewart's lodging was to be at the royal palace of St.
  Germain-en-Laye, outside Paris but the nearest port the captain of her vessel
  could make was Roscoff in Brittany. There Mary Stewart landed, at this small
  haven on a dangerous coast, on the 13th of August, the troublesome voyage,
  despite the skill of the French seamen, having taken a fortnight. In the name
  of the sick and exhausted child, a chapel, dedicated to St. Ninian, was
  ordered by the Scots in thanksgiving for their safety. One of them drew an
  imprint of her tiny foot on the rock.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-2"
     id="ch-2"></a><i>Part II.</i><br>
  FRANCE 1548-1561</h2>

  <p class="first">The little Queen, who had made a jest of the illnesses of
  those in her train for whom the tossing of the galleys had been intolerable,
  was lodged in the Dominican convent at Morlaix. She was received by M. de
  Rohan, chief of the Breton nobility, whose presence of mind quelled trouble
  among the suspicious Scots when the town drawbridge broke under the pressure
  of the jostling horsemen and sent them in the river.</p>

  <p>Morlaix still shows the ancient houses, the fishing fleet that Mary saw,
  and there is yet the memory of the defeat of the English in 1522 when the
  native lion facing the English leopard was added to the arms of the town with
  the motto: <i>If they bite you, you bite them</i>.</p>

  <p>Henry II was occupied in touring the Eastern defences of France, with an
  eye to the possible activities of the Emperor, Charles V, but he had given
  precise instructions as to the royal honours that must be shown to the Queen
  of Scots. After a few days' rest at Morlaix the train broke up; some of
  Mary's retinue proceeded in small parties overland to Paris. This horseback
  journey took about a fortnight with good 'nags' and weather. Mary, who
  continued in high spirits, was carefully conducted in easy stages to Nantes,
  ancient capital of Brittany, a pleasant town, once the scene of furious
  combats between the Bretons and the 'Sea-Dragons' or Norman pirates finally
  dispersed by a local hero, Alain Barbe-Porte, who created himself Duke of
  Brittany. In the splendid royal residence, the usual fortress palace, then
  something over a century old, Mary lodged with her train while her mother in
  Scotland and her grandmother in France exchanged nervous letters about her
  safety, her health and her progress towards the guardianship of her maternal
  kin.</p>

  <p>Antoinette de Bourbon, Duchess of Guise, travelled from Tours to Illiers,
  then to Chartres, and Mary went to meet her by taking barge at Nantes and
  proceeding to Orléans, where again the party took horses, litters, waggons
  and moved slowly, ponderously through the autumn days towards their
  destination. The Scots had recovered their health. The only loss was that of
  'Young Seton', who died 'of a flux'; but the complex and anxious arrangements
  of Henry II included the dismissal of most of the Scots servants. Only the
  nobles and more important attendants were allowed to remain about Mary's
  person; the French men and women were to surround the child as if she had
  been a Queen consort only. The first description of Mary, whose praises had
  preceded her, was given by the Duchess of Guise, who received the
  grand-daughter with a kingdom (it was hoped) for her dowry, with real
  tenderness.</p>

  <p>Antoinette de Bourbon was extremely pleased with 'Reinette', as the French
  named the child, but she was not beguiled into flattery. The 'grace and
  assurance' of the well-trained child, not yet six years of age, delighted her
  grandmother's fastidious taste; for the rest, the Duchess of Guise noted
  brown hair, a pale complexion, a face too long, small, deep-set brown eyes:
  all the materials for the beauty most admired at the French Court. It was
  November before the party arrived at St. Germain-en-Laye; the journey from
  Scotland had, owing to leisurely progress, taken nearly five months. The
  traveller of today who cares to take as long can make an exhaustive study of
  Brittany, the Loire and such famous towns and cities as Morlaix, Nantes and
  Chartres.</p>

  <p>Henry II had been at considerable cost and pains in order to make his
  Palace of St. Germain-en-Laye fit for the reception of Mary of Scotland. His
  wife, Catherine de Medici, was alarmed by reports of infectious diseases in
  Paris; these were endemic, but this summer had increased in severity. The
  King, sharing his wife's anxiety, gave orders that the Palace was to be
  carefully cleaned, and all workmen and servitors inspected for traces of some
  possible contagious or infectious malady. He was fond of children, though a
  sombre and taciturn prince, and showed a constant watchfulness over the
  safety and comfort of Mary that was shared by the House of Guise. To Henry II
  she was not only a charming little Princess, worthy of love and respect, she
  was the pledge that one day his family would rule in Scotland, while to her
  maternal relations she was the culmination of their immense ambition. Through
  her they might attain the longed-for glory of complete control of the affairs
  of France, for already the House of Guise was in a remarkable position.
  Regarded by the ancient nobility as <i>parvenu</i>, their power was yearly
  increasing, and so were the perils that surrounded them.</p>

  <p>Claude, Duke of Guise, was a cadet of the House of Lorraine, being fifth
  son of René II. His military successes against the peasants' revolt in 1527
  had been rewarded by a dukedom, the name being taken from the town of Guise.
  Claude had married Antoinette de Bourbon, their daughter Mary had married
  into the House of Orléans before becoming the wife of James V of Scotland and
  the granddaughter, the little Mary, now arrived in their domain, was not only
  Queen of Scotland but was soon to be Queen of France. In the letters that
  Antoinette de Bourbon wrote to her elder son, Francis of Aumale, about her
  meeting with her grand-daughter she touched warmly on the prospect of his
  marriage with the daughter of the Duke of Ferrara, who was descended from
  Louis XII of France. In the same letter she begged for clemency towards the
  defeated peasants of the South.</p>

  <p>This Princess was an example of the dilemma in which a nervous, sensitive
  and virtuous woman was placed in these surroundings of violence, corruption
  and unabashed vice. While not abating an iota of worldly pride and constantly
  occupied with schemes for the advancement of her family, she was secretly
  terrified into religious mania and strove to win divine forgiveness and even
  favour by the most rigid conduct. She wore a serge robe, forswore all petty
  vanities and kept her coffin constantly in her sight; she was a lay member of
  the Dominicans, the Carmelites and the Cistercians; she had, together with
  her husband, founded a Benedictine Monastery on their princely estates at
  Joinville and three of her daughters were abbesses at Rheims, at Fontremault
  and at Formentier. Moreover, her second son Charles was a Cardinal of the
  Church of Rome and had thus increased both the worldly and the heavenly power
  and prestige of the House of Guise&mdash;or so his mother hoped.</p>

  <p>Her Court resembled a religious establishment and her time was spent
  between intrigues to assist the dazzling fortunes of her family and labours
  in the cause of charity. These fortunes were further secured by the almost
  continuous presence in Rome of the elder Guise Cardinal, John of Lorraine,
  brother of Claude, Duke of Guise, and great-uncle to Queen Mary. This
  unscrupulous worldling shared the one virtue of the male members of his
  House, loyalty to his relations. This tenacity of affection was one of the
  causes of their success; he had hopes of the Papal tiara.</p>

  <p>Antoinette de Bourbon's younger sons, youths of spirit and talent, by no
  means kept in the background of the family's triumphs. They were added
  support to the family ambition and if Claude, Duke of Guise, 'the Butcher of
  Alsace' to the Protestants, was suspected of designs on the crown of France,
  these sons might be counted on for valuable help in the design.</p>

  <p>The House of Valois, then holding this same crown, was not so well
  buttressed. Henry II, much ruled by the Constable of France, often misled and
  not popular in manner, had then one son, Francis the Dauphin, Mary's
  affianced husband, and three daughters by his wife, Catherine de Medici. This
  Italian, of the Florentine bankers' family, was plain, effaced, and meekly
  shared the King's favours and the government of his household with his
  mistress, Diane de Poitiers, Duchess of Valentinois. Her hold on her royal
  lover was absolute. She had brains, taste, wit and a ruthless strength of
  character to add to her famous beauty that remained unchanged so long that
  she was supposed to employ magic arts. This accusation did not sound strange
  in an age when every Court in Europe added the terrors of Hell to the terrors
  of Heaven. In France Nostradamus, the Wizard astrologer, held a position as
  high as that of any priest, and those who countenanced the darkest crimes
  while murmuring prayers also listened to soothsayers and witches while
  indulging in pagan pleasures and cynical philosophies.</p>

  <p>Diane de Poitiers concerned herself at once in the upbringing of Mary, who
  was placed with the royal children under the care of M. d'Humières.</p>

  <p>Henry II informed the Estates of Scotland of the safety of their sovereign
  and instructed his Ambassador in London to announce to the Lord Protector
  Somerset that he&mdash;'held the place of King of Scotland'. To a neutral
  power, Turkey, he boasted of his triumph over the English 'who wished to
  usurp Scotland' under pretence of a marriage; the English, however, were
  still intriguing for this same marriage.</p>

  <p>Mary's life was happy in the newly cleaned château with her little
  companions, her future husband, the King's son, his three sisters and her
  half brother, the Duc de Longueville. On the surface all was comfortable, gay
  and very magnificent for these royal children; nor did they lack discipline
  and religious training. The long and gracious traditions of the French Courts
  surrounded them; they early were accustomed to excellent music, dancing and
  to a magnificent taste that decorated every detail of life.</p>

  <p>The men of the House of Guise were scholars and patrons of the arts; Diane
  de Poitiers was the goddess of a school of painting, poetry and sculpture, of
  the most exquisite minor arts, a genius in making life gracious, elegant and
  enjoyable. With superb egotism she ignored everything but the gratification
  of her own faultless taste, and, with the royal fortune at her disposal, she
  never lacked the means to indulge her least caprice. As she was a widow she
  affected black and white in her apparel: as her name was Diane, she affected
  the garb and crescent of the goddess of chastity; these cunning devices
  placed her beyond competition and perfectly suited her elegant yet robust
  beauty. Completely amoral, she yet exacted all the fascinating rituals of the
  chivalry of the Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>It was on the model of this accomplished woman that the little Mary was
  formed. She, too, was elegant, tall, with classic features and faultless
  manners and was easily trained in the school of the reigning favourite. It
  did not then appear that she was far more passionate and much less able than
  the Frenchwoman, and not suited, by temperament, to be a Diane de Poitiers.
  There was another influence, that of the pious Antoinette of Guise, with her
  driving ambition and her relentless bigotry. From the first there was a
  scarcely perceptible struggle between the House of Valois, dominated by Diane
  de Poitiers, and the House of Guise, dominated by the Cardinal Charles, for
  the rulership of Mary of Scotland. The Cardinal, from a distance as yet,
  supervised Mary's education and saw to it that she was thoroughly instructed
  in her duty to the Church and to the House of Guise; his brother, Francis,
  Duke of Aumale, was equally interested.</p>

  <p>A short stay in St. Germain-en-Laye will suffice to discover what remains
  of the period when Mary of Scotland walked the terraces, played in the
  gardens and learned her lessons in the handsome apartments. Much has changed,
  much disappeared, but the curious will still find some relics of the reign of
  Henry II.</p>

  <p>Paris then becomes the centre of Mary's life and to stay there is the
  easiest way of following her movements in France, as to stay in Edinburgh is
  the easiest way of following her movements in Scotland. She travelled from
  one royal palace to another, from one Guise possession to another, so
  frequently that it would be tedious to attempt to follow her exactly as to
  time and place. One visit to each town, city or castle will suffice to see
  what is left of the scenes she once knew. As the manner of her education has
  been so often disputed and as it has such a vital bearing on her story, it is
  needful to consider what this education exactly was; nor is it difficult to
  discover what Mary learned and who taught her learning and the arts.</p>

  <p>Her first lesson was her own royalty and the glories of her Stewart and
  Lorraine descent; this was one she never forgot. Her second lesson was
  complete obedience to the Church of Rome, then sadly perplexed and menaced by
  the spread of a heresy of the most malicious kind. After these lessons came
  personal accomplishments: a little fashionable learning, all the feminine
  graces, the refinements and delicacies of a decadent Court. There was nothing
  of statecraft, nothing of patriotism, nothing of the history, the needs, the
  wishes of her native country, nothing of the condition of Europe beyond the
  religious position, nothing of morals. As to discretion or tact, she was
  considered above the need for diplomacy, but she was taught to employ the
  natural cunning, the natural charm of youth, to conceal her feelings and gain
  her ends. It was the upbringing of a Court lady, not that of a sovereign.</p>

  <p>Mary was not gifted; she could copy her master's commonplace maxims, their
  routine exercises, she could follow their instructions and turn a few
  sentences in Latin, play a little, sing a little and ride a horse reasonably
  well for a woman. Where her liking lay she was quick and clever; her dancing
  was accurate and stately; her taste in all the decorative arts was well in
  tune with the fashions of her day; she could compose a set of mechanical
  verses at need, and she enjoyed needlework, her patterns being provided by
  professional draughtsmen. She soon spoke French, which her mother had first
  taught her, with ease, and her Scots became halting through infrequent use.
  It was not possible for her to recall Scotland very distinctly. The Scots
  were not regarded with much favour by the French. Antoinette of Guise found
  them all plain, save Lady Fleming; this fair and witty daughter of James V
  had some of the fatal beauty of the Stewarts and soon 'tarnished' her good
  name.</p>

  <p>With all their exertions and all their power, neither the Guises nor the
  Valois could give the royal children good health. No 'cleansing' of St.
  Germain-en-Laye, the village and the park could rid the place of infection;
  foul air, lack of even elementary sanitation, unhealthful clothes, bad food,
  overheated, or over-chilly, draughty rooms, the constant association with
  people who were, despite all precautions, dirty and diseased, caused frequent
  and serious illnesses. Faintings, toothache, fevers, skin eruptions, pains,
  aches and nervous depressions afflicted young and old alike; a dread of
  sudden death (completely justified) lent terror to every enjoyment; the span
  of life was short and might end any moment. Poison was much feared and often
  experienced, but it came from the cesspool or the tainted food as often as
  from the hand of an enemy. Not that murder was not employed as means to any
  end of self-aggrandizement by these princes and nobles who considered
  themselves above any law of man, and who trusted they could buy off God's
  vengeance by conforming to the rules of the Church of Rome. Everyone of any
  note went armed and protected by guards; greed or fanaticism could inspire
  many a man to attempt secret slaying, terrible as the penalties were for such
  crimes, nor were there ever wanting ruffians who could be hired to commit a
  deed of violence.</p>

  <p>The two men who influenced Mary more than any others during these years of
  girlhood were her uncles the Cardinal Charles, the great Churchman, and
  Francis of Aumale, the great soldier. They were then approaching the height
  of that power which all the aristocracy grudged them and their pretensions
  were immense; had their ambitions been realized they would have ruled Europe
  between them by means of members of their House. Though descended from a
  fifth son they assumed the rank of foreign sovereign princes, although they
  were French when that suited their purpose. On the strength of the marriages
  of their ancestors they quartered the royal arms of Anjou, Hungary, Sicily
  and Naples; the Cardinal Charles coveted this latter crown for his brother.
  If the Cardinal John could have been elected Pope, and Mary of Scotland could
  have secured the English throne, as well as keeping the French throne, the
  House of Guise, already with a foothold in Italy through the marriage of Duke
  Francis, would have become the most powerful factor in Europe. As ferocious
  opponents of the heretical movement&mdash;afterwards known as the
  Reformation&mdash;they could count on the ultimate support of the Vatican,
  the Emperor and Spain, by reason of marriages, treaty or common aims.</p>

  <p>These schemes were so vast, and so nearly successful, that these two able
  men might have paused to consider the possible approach of Nemesis; but
  ambition blinded them if not to the perils of their position at least to the
  chance of any failure. Francis of Aumale was far more popular among the
  people than his father had ever been. He was genial, the friend of the common
  soldier, a famous captain, a superb personality held to reflect glory on
  France. If the Cardinal Charles was not liked, he was respected. He spent
  much of his revenues in helping the Roman Catholic refugees from the
  Protestant countries, in building seminaries, libraries and monasteries; he
  was a notable scholar, orator and philosopher, quick and subtle. He also made
  a splendid appearance in his person and his household. His faults, however,
  were not those most easily overlooked by ordinary people. Son and brother of
  soldiers of genius, he was cowardly; a Prince of the Church and nephew of the
  Cardinal of Lorraine who aspired to the Papacy, he was suspected of heresy,
  atheism and known to be a hypocrite. Worst of all, he was so false and
  faithless that no one could trust a word he said.</p>

  <p>But all the Guises had fascinating manners and towards the Queen of Scots
  their intentions were chivalrous and tender. They regarded her with a deep
  affection and she responded warmly, with a child's candour, as she did to the
  boundless love and care of her grandmother, Antoinette de Bourbon. Mary was
  also passionately attached to her mother&mdash;her father she had never
  known&mdash;so she was, and always remained, a daughter of the House of
  Guise. She resembled them physically; only her long, oval face was a Stewart
  characteristic. Because she was their kin, she inclined towards them and
  their tastes were similar.</p>

  <p>At St.-Germain-en-Laye there were pet dogs, horses, birds, exotic animals
  and live boars taken in the net on show; there were singers, jesters and
  clowns, poets, musicians and puppets, and there was an immense variety of
  gorgeous clothes in which the little Queen took a considerable pride. Her
  closest companions were her future husband, Francis, and his sister,
  Elizabeth of Valois, a child of a sweet and gay disposition, whose hand in
  marriage was already being bargained for by England and Spain. In thus
  amusing, protecting and training their charge, the Guises combined with the
  King and his two favourites, Anne Montmorency, the Constable of France, a
  stern, ignorant, cruel, narrow soldier but a loving father, delighting in
  children, and the ever-powerful Diane de Poitiers. Henry II, dull, sombre, a
  fine athlete, fond of an outdoor life, gave all his trust and affection to
  these two people, a generation older than he was himself.</p>

  <p>So far neither the King, his favourites, nor the Bourbons, first Princes
  of the Blood, had challenged the House of Guise. The superb Diane, the meek
  Queen Catherine, detested by her husband and the mother of many sickly
  children, and the pious Antoinette, met in anxious council and tender care
  over the affairs of Mary of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Henry II wrote to Mary of Guise in Scotland, informing her of the triumph
  of her House, the jealousy of the English Ambassador and that Henry fomented
  with tactless praise of Mary and the Dauphin. This child, always sickly, had
  lately shown some spirit; he wished to discard his 'girl's' or 'baby's'
  clothes and to dress as a man. He was keen, too, to imitate his elders, to
  have a horse, arms and armour. A severe attack of smallpox in his infancy had
  left him weakly and his illnesses were even more frequent than were those of
  the other royal children. He attached himself to Mary, who treated him with
  considerate kindness.</p>

  <p>The following summer (1549) Catherine de Medici was crowned and Mary made
  a public appearance. A month of gay and costly festivities in Paris did not
  mean a cessation of the ruthless persecution of the Protestants. During the
  sumptuous rejoicings the death by torture of those whose sole offence was
  their religious opinions took place, without respite, in the capital, and in
  view of those going to and from the Palace of the Tournelles. The next year,
  while Mary was growing in graces in her sheltered, guarded Palace of St.
  Germain-en-Laye, her grandfather, Claude, Duke of Guise, died at his castle
  in Joinville, aged fifty-four years, already supplanted by his sons. He
  suffered from an apoplexy or of poison, as he himself believed, and as was
  stated on his coffin. His sons being absent his widow postponed his funeral
  until they could gather at Joinville, where the Duke Claude was buried in
  June 1550. This ceremony lasted for eight days and was an affirmation of the
  power and pretences of the House of Guise. Foreign envoys were received and
  Henry II permitted this display of royal rites, the Duke Claude being 'the
  son of a king'.</p>

  <p>It was Francis of Aumale, now second Duke of Guise, who organized this
  elaborate funeral; the Cardinal Charles was in Rome. Cardinal John of
  Lorraine died soon after his brother, and the Princes, their successors,
  divided the inheritance of the last generation. They were more able, more
  vigorous, more popular than their predecessors. Charles took John's title of
  Cardinal of Lorraine and inherited his valuable property, including his
  costly personal possessions of furniture, books and jewels. Francis, 'the
  glorious soldier' surnamed the 'Balafré' from a wound in the face, became
  head of the family. The younger brothers, worthy to sustain the credit of the
  House of Guise, were the Grand Prior of France, General of the Galleys, the
  Duke of Aumale, son-in-law of Diane de Poitiers, and the Marquis d'Elbceuf.
  The Duke Claude, so austere, pious and devoted to his wife, had acknowledged
  twelve natural children, one of whom at least, a scoundrel who had entered
  the Church, survived him.</p>

  <p>Henry II, in order to strengthen the French influence in Scotland, schemed
  to bribe Arran to resign the Regency and hand over his office to Mary of
  Guise. The price offered was the French dukedom of Châtelherault. The French
  soldiers had been too long in a country where the Protestants were in the
  ascendancy for the 'auld alliance' to flourish; their excesses had disgusted
  the Scots, who were uneasy at the new power conferred on the French Princess.
  She was the only person in Scotland on whose loyalty the Guises and their
  little Queen could confidently count. John Knox, the formidable preacher
  whose career was watched by the Roman Catholics with hate and dread, declared
  that the Regency fitted the Queen Dowager 'as a saddle might fit an old
  cow'.</p>

  <p>Mary of Guise sailed from Scotland in the August of the year her father
  died (1550). Her brother, the new Duke of Guise, met her at Dieppe; her
  reception was splendid&mdash;even the galley slaves and sailors of her ship
  had been attired in white damask and she was escorted like a reigning Queen
  to Rouen. Here the Scots in her train fell to fighting and brawling in a
  highhanded manner that gave the French a taste of their spirit. Mary of
  Scotland was then dangerously ill of 'the flux'; she was eight years old and
  had seldom been in good health, despite constant doctoring. She rallied,
  however, to write a dutiful 'copy book' letter to her grandmother, and to
  travel with Henry II and his wife to Rouen, to greet her mother. With them
  was the charming little Duc de Longueville, Mary of Guise's son by her first
  marriage and Mary's amiable playmate. He also was ailing; all the royal
  children appeared pinched and wan, dim eyed and dull in the stiff, boned
  clothes of heavy material, the mighty ornaments, the masses of feathers (a
  passion with the House of Guise), chains and ruffs suitable to their rank but
  not to their age.</p>

  <p>Mary greeted her mother with touching affection and the two were regarded
  with much sympathy by the crowds that gathered in the streets of the ancient
  capital of Normandy to see the costly pageantry of the royal entry. The
  citizens of Rouen provided the usual classic set pieces, one of which showed
  Hercules crushing the hydra. On the river was an artificial whale, while in
  the port a number of 'Brazilian savages' were encouraged to burn a ship.
  Diane de Poitiers, as always in black velvet, with the crown jewels, and
  ermine, 'dazzled' the beholders.</p>

  <p>Henry II was very civil to the Scots lords, who responded by falling into
  'a foul rout', to the disgust of the jealous English envoy, Sir John
  Mason.</p>

  <p>Mary was not long in the noble city, where she heard mass at the
  Cathedral, and dined with the royal party at the Abbey of Saint Ouen. From
  Rouen the Court moved to Blois where the winter was spent in merrymaking.
  Henry II had, urged on by the Cardinal of Lorraine and his sister, Mary of
  Guise, decided to back the Scots in a war with England. Mary of Guise was to
  return to her post with sufficient French troops to hold the Protestants down
  and to attack the English on the Border, but Edward VI sent Lord Northampton
  with the Garter for Henry II, which somewhat delayed these designs and was
  the occasion of more junketings, tournaments, processions, feasts as well as
  all the games and sports in which the Valois King delighted.</p>

  <p>The English were still after the marriage of Mary of Scotland and Edward
  VI; but on being refused 'in round, plain terms' by the Constable they put in
  an offer for Mary's friend, Elizabeth of Valois.</p>

  <p>Mary of Guise held many consultations with the Cardinal of Lorraine as to
  the future of her daughter. She left with him a casket of her jewels and
  entreated that he would personally keep a close watch over the little Queen.
  The Court was now becoming weary of the supplicant's stately gravity, her
  troubles, her importunity for money. She was ill and ageing before her time
  and the twice widowed woman was by no means a joyous figure at the continuous
  entertainments at Blois.</p>

  <p>The last weeks of her stay were troubled by an abortive plot to poison
  Mary of Scotland. The attempt, made by an archer of the Scots Guard, failed,
  and the man, one Robert Stewart, escaped to Scotland. No one knew much of
  this obscure affair which some supposed was engineered by the English. A
  worse tragedy befell Mary of Guise in the death of her eldest child, the Duc
  de Longueville, shortly before her departure for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Mary of Guise parted sadly and tenderly from her daughter, for whose sake
  she was returning to her thankless task of holding the Scots throne and the
  Roman Catholic religion against England and the heretics, headed by John Knox
  and the Lords of the Congregation. She was escorted by ten ships of war and
  made so bold as to land at Portsmouth. She travelled to London, and at
  Hampton Court was received by the young King who had been so long and so
  persistently proposed as her daughter's husband. Edward VI was as sickly, as
  mentally feeble, as the Dauphin. Mary of Guise refused once more appeals to
  her to break off the French match and returned to Scotland, there to endure,
  in Stirling and Edinburgh, loneliness and a bitter sense of defeat.</p>

  <p>The departure of this distressed woman was Mary of Scotland's first deep
  grief. Her warm heart, her childish loyalty, the fact that her mother was
  sacrificing everything for her interests held Mary's complete allegiance to
  her sole parent. There was, too, complete agreement between mother and child;
  they were, before everything, princesses of the House of Guise, and all Mary
  of Lorraine's instructions, warnings and advice were exactly in tune with
  everything that Mary had heard before from her uncles and her grandparents.
  She must never forget who she was, by right divine, twice a Queen, and by
  right divine also the champion of the old, true Faith. The sensitive child
  was eager to pledge eternal loyalty and complete obedience to the Church to
  which all those she loved belonged, and loyalty and obedience to the great
  Cardinal of Lorraine, her generous and loving protector and uncle.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this date, Mary, who was never portrayed by a first-class
  painter, was sketched by Francis Clouet in red crayon. The little Queen in
  this slight drawing shows nothing of the brilliancy, vivacity and beauty on
  which all who met her remarked. The face might be that of a woman of twenty
  years; it is sad and pinched, the lips compressed, the eyes sunk (one smaller
  than the other), while all natural charms are concealed; the hair is dragged
  back under a lace cap edged with jewels, the narrow body compressed into a
  tight bodice, the chest flattened, with braids and gems, lace and more jewels
  hiding the throat; the ears are pierced and hung with heavy ornaments. Even
  at that age of nine years Mary had learned how to carry a Court dress heavy
  as a suit of armour and how to compose her face to an expressionless mask.
  She knew, from infancy, how to keep a secret; often her uncles had warned her
  that there were spies in her household. She knew that she was watched,
  criticized and reported upon, and though this concerned her very little,
  happy as she was with her loving relations, friends and flatterers, this
  knowledge gave her a stateliness beyond her years and a reserve that was not
  in her nature.</p>

  <p>But she was still in the schoolroom, if no longer in the nursery, and,
  apart from such brilliant episodes as the visits to Rouen and Blois, she
  remained at St. Germain-en-Laye, now and then visiting her grandmother at
  Joinville, where she was very content. Mary knew little of Paris at this
  date, but her mother's country was early familiar to her and remembered with
  affection and longing all her life.</p>

  <p>Joinville, in which Mary was so happy in this feminine establishment where
  discipline, quiet and leisure divided the pleasant hours, can be the next
  place for the present-day traveller to visit after St. Germain-en-Laye. It
  fits best into the story of her childhood, before, at twelve years of age,
  she was permitted her own household and her infancy, childhood and even
  youth, were already over.</p>

  <p>Joinville remains one of those places that retain most of their one-time
  distinction. The town is finely placed on a little arm of the Marne and the
  site is charmingly set in a gentle valley. On one of the protecting hills
  stood the ruins of the Guises' feudal castles; the 'pleasure' house remains.
  Joinville was raised, in 1552, into a principality and became one of the
  honours of this family already replete with honours. This castle has long
  since been demolished, but a portion of the gracious park remains, as does
  the church, and the hospital of St. Croix, dating from the period of Mary of
  Scotland (1567). In her time Joinville was a walled town, with many spires;
  it is still surrounded by delightful woods and a countryside of a gentle
  pastoral nature. In the hospital are numerous relics of the House of Guise,
  including portraits of several of its famous members that, although not
  contemporary with the subjects, long adorned the vanished château.</p>

  <p>In the adjoining graveyard lie what is left of the once sumptuous
  memorials of the House of Guise, in the form of a black marble slab that
  covers their bones, disinterred in revolutionary excesses, then piously
  gathered together. This spot once bore the soothing inscription&mdash;'It is
  here one finds repose,' altered to a grimmer statement&mdash;'It is
  here.'</p>

  <p>A delicate prospect can be enjoyed from the summit where the castle stood.
  The site is now covered by vineyards, meadows and gardens, and only careful
  search will discover the supposed outline of the tennis court used by the
  Guises during their eighty years of power. In the old park, however, is the
  'pleasure house' delightfully 'embosked' with elms and chestnuts. This lordly
  retreat is 'a talking house' like the Palace of the Huntlys in Edinburgh. It
  is lavishly adorned with those mottoes of a boasting or melancholy nature so
  fashionable in that epoch of bigotry, ambition and superstition. In the
  spring the gaiety of wild flowers that grow here in profusion helps to
  re-create that flourishing time when Mary of Scotland lived happily in the
  princely establishment of Antoinette de Bourbon, guarded as she was never to
  be guarded again, by love, respect and power. This <i>Maison de l'amour
  repenti</i>, as it was named after some legendary love story, had been built
  by the Duke Claude as a retreat from the troubles of the world and the
  splendours of his castle. It was carefully constructed after the style of the
  Italian architects then employed on the glories of the Diane de Poitiers
  château at Annet, and on the royal palaces of the Loire. There were
  fishponds, fountains, and parterres; indeed, these gardens were as faithful a
  representation of Paradise as the yearnings, the skill and the wealth of the
  sixteenth century could create.</p>

  <p>Here Mary of Scotland learned her lessons. Few of them were from books;
  her academic achievements were mediocre, but she was quick to catch every
  tone and inflection of the instructions given her by her pious grandmother
  and her splendid uncles. So early and so deeply impressed by one point of
  view, it was not possible for Mary to be either tolerant or meek, nor could
  the praised and cherished child ever know of anything save a world in which
  one 'lived joyously'.</p>

  <p>In her twelfth year Mary was given her own household. The Dauphin had
  already been separated from her lessons and games and given his own
  gentleman's establishment and Mary was eager to exert her regal authority.
  Her governesses had not lately been successful. One was always ill, another
  arrogant, a third pilfered her clothes, to the girl's sharp vexation. Always
  lavish, she wished to give away some garment and found it had gone&mdash;the
  governess was dismissed. It was noted that Mary hated 'nothing so much as
  meanness'. It was easy for her to be generous since she could dispose of
  goods and money that appeared to her limitless, but she was naturally
  openhearted and delighted in giving presents that were not only costly but
  thoughtful, for they were selected with a sensitive understanding of the
  recipient's tastes and enriched with mottoes of her own choosing.</p>

  <p>At this time Mary possessed a famous collection of jewels including the
  contents of the casket left her by her mother, to be used 'for State
  affairs'. These were jealously kept, precisely noted in inventories and
  constantly overhauled by goldsmiths. Mary was much interested in these lists
  of gems, that filled three brass chests, and knew to the last detail what she
  owned. A gift from Diane de Poitiers was contemptuous in its simplicity as
  coming from a royal favourite to a Queen. This was a set of buttons shaped
  like Diane's device, the crescent moon, and enamelled in her colours, black
  and white.</p>

  <p>Mary of Scotland's hundred and twenty gowns were made from the choicest
  products of the world; damask of gold and silver thread, French and Italian
  velvets, satins and brocades, taffetas, or interchangeable silk, sables,
  ermine and ostrich feathers enriched her wardrobe; holland, cambric and lace
  were used in the underclothes and every item of gloves, pins, combs, caps,
  shoes, and stockings was of the richest possible quality. Mary, when 'out of
  tutelage', naturally gave as much time to these vanities as she did to her
  Latin exercises, her prayers and her dull little essays.</p>

  <p>The affairs of the House of Guise continued to flourish. The Duke Francis
  returned from saving the great barrier fortress of Metz to be the hero of the
  Court and the people. His youngest brother, Louis, was made a Cardinal; his
  sister was, at least nominally, Regent of Scotland. These successes balanced
  the unpleasant fact of the spread of a Protestantism that had become so
  formidable that Henry II, a ferocious persecutor of heretics in France, had
  been obliged to ally himself with Edward VI and the German Lutherans.
  Scotland, too, was 'over run' with the followers of John Knox, a man who so
  exactly suited the movement he led that it seemed as if he had formed it
  after his own character. The death of the English King (1553), however, and
  the accession of Mary Tudor brightened the political scene for the Roman
  Catholics and for Mary of Scotland. She could no longer be pestered by
  English demands for her hand. Somerset, the ruthless enemy of Scotland, had
  gone to the block; the new queen might prove barren and that would make Mary
  of Scotland&mdash;in the opinion of all save the heretics&mdash;heiress to
  the English throne.</p>

  <p>At this bright period of her youth Mary frequently resided in Paris, and
  often visited the magnificent royal châteaux, built in the environs of the
  capital in the midst of beautiful parks and gardens, equally suitable for
  hunting, that passion of the nobility, and for games and all the pleasures of
  idleness.</p>

  <p>The Paris of this time was increasing so rapidly in size that further
  expansion was forbidden. It was a mediaeval city, dark, beautiful, centred
  once upon the Court, once upon the Church, once upon the University, three
  cities in one superbly set on the Seine and crowned by the majestic cathedral
  on the river island. It was badly policed, crowded with those drawn to the
  Court, to learning, to religion, or to trade, and with ruffians and
  opportunists who exploited citizens and foreigners alike. Crimes and violent
  deeds were continuous and mostly unchecked; every kind of vice was freely
  practised, sorcery that embraced all the 'black arts' throve in the crooked,
  narrow streets; the taverns were the meeting places of every possible type of
  agitator, scoundrel and spy. But learning flourished also, as did the
  humanities, the arts and the crafts to a high degree of accomplishment and
  skill. The Palace of the Louvre on the site of a fort built by Philip
  Augustus was being rebuilt. The royal family mostly resided in the Tournelles
  that stood on the site of the modern <i>Place Royale</i>. This was an ancient
  building&mdash;once the headquarters of the Duke of Bedford when he was
  Regent for Henry VI of England. In this dark, straggling and inconvenient
  dwelling Mary passed many days of her first youth. The air of the capital was
  foul; the stenches in the royal hotel continual; the royal children were all
  struck with 'fluxes' and 'tertian agues' (malaria), shivering from one fit to
  another for weeks on end.</p>

  <p>Mary of Scotland did not escape severe illnesses. Although the Guises
  indignantly denied that she was sickly, her own doctors frequently predicted
  that she would not live long and her health seemed as precarious as that of
  her future husband, who continued to be so mentally and physically feeble
  that it was doubted if he would ever come to the throne.</p>

  <p>Mary's illnesses consisted of recurrent malaria, that scourge of Europe,
  dysentery, indigestion, toothache and blood poisoning. These ailments reduced
  her to a state of weakness revealed by vomiting, fainting fits and nervous
  prostration. She over-ate the heavy, spiced, rich food so abundantly supplied
  that was often, under the pungent flavouring, putrid or tainted. Her anxious
  physicians recommended 'change of air' and she was in better health when away
  from the Tournelles, foul with the filth of centuries, and Paris, hotbed of
  every known disease.</p>

  <p>There is little left from Mary's time at Meudon, where she attended the
  triumphant ritual of the Church at Easter in 1554 when the second son of the
  Duke of Guise was baptized. The château the Cardinal of Lorraine was then
  building for himself has gone. Only the church of Lower Meudon remains. But
  at Fontainebleau there remains in the château much that is exactly as Mary
  saw it. Here are the massive rooms, overwhelming in their heavy ornament with
  the deep coffered ceilings bearing the famous interlaced H and D that stood
  for Henry and Diane; this audacity was too much even for the servility of the
  Court and the D was declared to be a C for Catherine. No one, however, was
  deceived by the insolent excuse.</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1558 Mary and Francis were betrothed with every
  circumstance of pomp the Court of France could command The mighty favourite,
  Diane, whose daughter was married to a Guise, the Duke of Aumale, lent her
  support to the hastening on of the nuptials. The Estates of Scotland,
  reminded of their obligations by Henry II, sent a party of Commissioners to
  attend the marriage. There were the Archbishop of Glasgow, the Bishops of
  Ross and Orkney, the Lords Fleming and Seton, John Erskine, and most
  important of all to Mary, her half-brother, the son of James V, now known as
  the Lord James, Commendator of St. Andrews. The Scots had raised fifteen
  thousand English pounds to pay for this formal visit.</p>

  <p>The ceremonies that united the frail girl and the sickly youth, both
  barely recovered from long illnesses, were routine in their tedious
  splendour. The betrothal took place in one of the newly completed galleries
  of the Louvre. The Cardinal of Lorraine, as the presiding genius, joined the
  hands of the bedizened couple on Friday, April 22nd, and on the following
  Sunday the marriage that Henry II wished to be 'the most famous ever held'
  took place in the Cathedral of Notre Dame.</p>

  <p>Nothing was omitted that could add to the splendour and prestige of the
  House of Guise. Not only the members of the triumphant family and the Valois
  were present, but also those of the opposing royal group, the Bourbons,
  headed by the King of Navarre. Mary, the bride, was escorted by the King and
  the Duke of Guise. She was then in her sixteenth year and so decked out in
  fantastic clothes and jewels as to appear more like an idol than a human
  being; the blazing carbuncle on her diadem was particularly remarked as being
  of fabulous value. Her beauty and grace were much admired; the courage and
  self-control, the rigid training that enabled her to put through these
  exhausting rituals, feasts, processions and pageants, were unremarked. Such
  feats of endurance were expected of princes.</p>

  <p>The bride showed her excellent training by her first political act which
  she made under the direct control of the Guises. This was a secret deed she
  signed on April 5th that gave her Scots crown and her prospects of the
  English crown, in the event of her dying childless, to Henry II. These
  prospects were then bright. The barren Mary Tudor was ill, and not expected
  to outlast the year; her husband Philip II of Spain was in his own country
  and not unlikely to be able to seize England; Elizabeth Tudor, Henry VIII's
  other daughter and only surviving child, was considered illegitimate by the
  Roman Catholics; Mary of Scotland was the next claimant.</p>

  <p>The intelligent girl knew well what she was doing; she was obeying the
  Cardinal of Lorraine, on whose advice she had always relied, and whose
  interests were her own. The facts that the Commissioners had arrived in Paris
  provided with instructions to maintain the rights of Scotland, and that these
  had been readily granted, did not trouble Mary. She had never been taught
  candour and the plighting of her royal word, April 15th, to the Scots was no
  more to her than a convenient formula. These three secret deeds were signed
  at Fontainebleau shortly before the marriage. The first did not mention the
  Guises, the second truthfully acknowledged their influence, and referred to
  the hoodwinked Commissioners as traitors trying to deprive the Queen of her
  rights.</p>

  <p>Henry II alleged that his reason for procuring these deeds was his desire
  to save Scotland from the English and to recoup himself for the money spent
  on Mary since her arrival in France. Legal experts had left no chance of a
  quibble. Scotland was, in the event of the Queen dying without issue, to
  transfer herself to the French king or pay him 'a million in gold'. Francis
  signed this deed as well as Mary. The Scots had no suspicion of this
  treachery; nor did the English spies get wind of it&mdash;there was no shrewd
  Englishman at the French Court, since diplomatic relations had been broken
  off a year before Mary's marriage.</p>

  <p>The Guises were the more anxious to strengthen their hold on Mary and her
  kingdom, since, at last, beneath the outward cordiality, Henry II was
  beginning to become restive under the rule of the arrogant brothers. He had
  bestowed the royal dukedom of Anjou on one of his own sons to prevent this
  title being assumed by the Guises. The Duke, the hero of Calais, was
  Lieutenant-Governor of France, the Cardinal the Treasurer. They were popular
  with the people; the Duke in particular was admired and loved, the Cardinal
  respected, if feared.</p>

  <p>Besides, the King was wearying for his only friend, the Constable, who had
  been taken prisoner by the Imperialists at the battle of St. Quentien, and
  the Guises, quick and well informed, sensed his mood. The three secret deeds
  that Mary signed were cleverly contrived to please and flatter Henry II and
  secure their own power. If it had been possible the Cardinal would have
  concealed his mounting arrogance, but this he could not do, and he, even in
  showing the King the clever documents that sold Scotland, could not forbear
  flourishing that he held the Queen of Scots in the hollow of his hand, thus
  further estranging Henry II.</p>

  <p>On one point the Scots lords were successful; they had not obeyed the
  French demands for 'the honours of Scotland'. The regalia was not to leave
  the country and the French had to accept this refusal. On the other hand, the
  Commissioners willingly agreed to acknowledge Francis as King of Scotland
  during the lifetime of his wife, or the 'continuance of the marriage'.</p>

  <p>The Scots remained in France for several months, without coming upon any
  hint of the secret deeds. Mary knew how to keep silent, how to deceive with
  smiles, witty sallies, caressing glances. Even her brother, the astute Lord
  James, never suspected her accomplished treachery. Only a few even of the
  French knew how they had been fooled and betrayed. Mary herself, soon after
  her marriage, wrote to her mother, warmly praising the Commissioners whom she
  had secretly denounced as traitors working to obtain the crown for the Duke
  of Châtelherault (Arran). In the autumn the Scots proceeded to Dieppe where
  they were struck down by one of the infections endemic at the ports. In a few
  days the Bishop of Orkney, Fleming, Rothes and Cassilis were dead; poison was
  instantly suspected though there was no one who had any interest in murdering
  men already defeated by secret treachery.</p>

  <p>Mary's life was not greatly changed by her marriage, since it was not
  possible to enlarge much on the state and power that had always surrounded
  her. As Dauphiness she was head of a large household and foremost in all the
  Court pageantry; and she keenly followed politics then centering on a peace
  with the Emperor. The Guises wished to prolong the war, the King to end it,
  mainly that he might have the Constable again at his side. Mary wrote
  contemplatingly of 'a prisoners' peace'; negotiations were opened and in the
  midst of them Mary Tudor died (Nov. 1558).</p>

  <p>The Guises and Henry II with the consent of Mary then made the second
  serious political error of her sojourn in France. She at once displayed the
  arms of England, even her engraved plate being altered, thus publishing her
  belief that she was Queen of England (as grand-daughter of Henry VII) after
  Mary Tudor, without dispute.</p>

  <p>A year after Mary's marriage the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis was signed, to
  the disgust of that great soldier, Francis of Guise. Henry II surrendered all
  the Italian conquests of the last eighty years that had been so costly to
  France in lives, treasure and resources; but he kept Calais and gained Spain
  by the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth, the childhood friend of Mary, with
  Philip II, late husband to Mary Tudor. Moreover, the Constable returned to
  his master.</p>

  <p>Now that peace was signed, an English ambassador was in Paris and Mary
  came under the skilled and relentless scrutiny of Sir Nicolas Throckmorton,
  who was for some years to observe and report on her actions, but to act, all
  the same, as a wise and friendly adviser. Throckmorton was a relative of
  Queen Catherine Parr. He had been actively engaged in Court politics since
  his youth, had narrowly escaped many perils, had enjoyed the confidence of
  many rulers and princes and was now, at the age of forty-five years, a
  convinced Protestant, an adroit diplomat, a self-assured courtier and a
  pleasant, amiable, well-liked English gentleman, who had decided to throw in
  his lot with that hope of the Reformation, Elizabeth Tudor, now firmly
  occupying the throne of England. His visit was of a special nature. Sir John
  Mason had returned to Paris as English envoy and Throckmorton was to assist
  him in watching the Queen of Scots and her husband and in protesting against
  her assumption of the royal arms, a direct challenge and insult to the
  English Queen.</p>

  <p>Mason had already reported on the ill health of Queen Mary and
  Throckmorton's keen eye noted, when he presented his letters of credit, that
  the girl looked 'very ill' and 'pale, green and short breathed'. She was
  unfit for business and spoke to him for a short time only; the Dauphin was
  suffering from the effects of the campaign, in which, however, he had not
  taken an active part. The Constable warned the Englishmen that the Scots
  Queen was 'very weak'. Mason hoped 'God would take her as soon as maybe'. The
  envoys ratified the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis and pressed the question of the
  assumption of the English arms; the unsatisfactory answer was that Elizabeth
  quartered France ancient, a begging of the question that was foolishly
  flippant and insolent. Mary was in miserable health during the summer of
  1559. Throckmorton reported she was 'evil at ease' in church and given wine
  from the altar.</p>

  <p>Jean Clouet's second drawing of Mary now in existence shows her as
  Dauphiness, or 'Dolphiness', of France&mdash;this pretty title was used
  seriously by the English and Scots and Dolphins were the symbols (to them) of
  the royal couple. This sketch, also in red crayon, shows Mary of Scotland
  already mature. The long, smooth oval face resembles the melancholy
  countenances of the royal Stewarts; the features are well formed, classic in
  outline, the eyes heavy lidded, the hair drawn away from a very high forehead
  and plaited round a stiff jewelled cap; her neck is concealed by ruffled
  lawn, clasped by enormous pearls. So little is there of youth and gaiety that
  the drawing seems rather that of some sad, grave matron.</p>

  <p>Instigated by the Guises and humiliated by the recent treaty, Henry II
  planned an even more ferocious persecution of the heretics. News from
  Scotland told of John Knox and his followers inciting the people to
  rebellion; at Perth churches had been sacked and the Queen Regent did not
  know which way to turn. Henry II wrote to the Pope, Paul IV, promising
  energetic reprisals on this 'wretched pest of ruffians' who was to be
  exterminated by French soldiers. Since, however, he was facing an empty
  treasury, yet still spending lavishly on pomp and show, he had not the means
  to fulfil these threats, yet his ferocious attitude fomented the long, uneasy
  strife into the wars of religion. It was no longer a question of extirpating
  'infidels'; the Reformation had taken a strong hold on Germany, England,
  Scotland, Switzerland and Scandinavia. It was not lightly to be put down, nor
  the clock easily to be set back. Henry II might and did turn fire and sword,
  death and torture, on his own subjects but he could do little against the
  Protestants of Europe.</p>

  <p>The Constable's son was sent to England, where there were more fruitless
  bickerings over Mary's assumption of the royal arms. She continued to blazon
  these at the costly pageantry that celebrated the wedding of the Valois
  Princess with Philip II's proxy, the Duke of Alva, and that of the Duke of
  Savoy with Margaret de Valois. The Constable, in opposition to the Guises,
  had been always flattering to Throckmorton and his son was smooth and
  obliging towards Elizabeth Tudor, but the cause of offence was not removed
  and the English Queen never forgave the Scots Queen. The Parisians, glutted
  with pageantry, were once more entertained sumptuously for the Spanish
  marriage. Reckless display hid the poverty, the disorder, the growing
  rebellion of France. Philip II, himself financially straitened, sent lavish
  presents to the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Constable, as well as
  magnificent gifts for the bride. Alva was a hostage for the fulfilment of the
  Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis with him was a German noble, William of Nassau,
  and a Flemish grandee, Lamoral Egmont, also a subject of Philip II, and also
  to be held as hostage. While Alva and the Constable were discussing schemes
  for raising money and punishing the arrogance of the Reformers, especially
  John Knox and his fellow Scots, Nassau and Egmont conferred cautiously with
  Gaspard de Coligny as to the position in Europe and the chances of Jean
  Calvin and John Knox against the tyrants. Coligny's wife was a Protestant and
  in touch with the reformer at Geneva.</p>

  <p>Mary of Scotland was again lodged in the gloomy old Palace of the
  Tournelles. She was ailing and no longer the centre of attention. Her slight
  figure, overloaded with finery, moved with stately grace among the incessant
  feasts and pageants. She was sad at losing her playfellow, Elizabeth of
  Valois, and the news her mother sent from Scotland was not good. She was,
  also, becoming faded with these long, exhausting and dazzling amusements
  where all the senses were violently assailed at once and her inscrutable face
  was wan and overshadowed. Some of the envoys thought she was consumptive and
  not likely to live longer than her infirm husband.</p>

  <p>But the poets who were constantly at Court, Ronsard, Marot, and <i>La
  Pléiade</i>, found in her their Egeria, a rosebud, a pearl, a creature of
  fabulous fascination. In particular, the ease and elegance of her movements,
  skilfully adapted to her ponderous dresses, and her long white hand, excited
  admiration.</p>

  <p>Among the Scots who came to and from Paris on business between the two
  Queens, Mary of Guise and Mary of Scotland, was an important personage whose
  loyalty to his sovereign was the more remarkable since he was a
  Protestant&mdash;'the worst thought of commented Throckmorton, observing him
  carefully.</p>

  <p>James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, or 'Erie Bothweille', came of a famous
  Border family and was in possession of many dignities that had descended from
  his grandfather, Lord Patrick Hepburn; among these was the title of Lord High
  Admiral of Scotland. He ruled like a prince on Liddesdale and Lothian and was
  the owner of the most splendid castle in the South of Scotland, Castle
  Bothwell, rising above the Clyde&mdash;the famous 'Bothwell bank' of the
  ballads. Bothwell had been educated in France, which was one of the reasons
  why Mary of Guise had chosen him to represent to her kinsfolk her forlorn and
  almost desperate position. He was also magnificent in his bearing and
  retinue, of a resolute hardihood and attractive manners. In character he was
  amoral, making no pretence at any virtue and credited, even by his friends,
  with all the vices. He was in the prime of his youth, accomplished in the
  courtly graces of music, poetry, dance and elaborate compliment, elegant and
  suave; yet he was at heart essentially the ferocious, ruthless Border
  chieftain who knew neither fear nor pity. This combination of brutal
  qualities and courtly manners made him extremely attractive to women and his
  amorous successes were as numerous as they were discreditable. He had already
  been 'handfasted' to a niece of Cardinal Beaton, and had forsaken her, but
  these dubious matrimonial ventures were the confusion and plague of the
  nobility and even of royalty. No one knew precisely what was and what was not
  a binding contract. Some plightings were without witnesses yet might be
  marriages under Scots law; other vows, again, undertaken publicly before a
  crowd might be worthless if a remote relationship was discovered between
  groom and bride. The Church of Rome did not permit divorce, but the Vatican
  could annul marriages and the acceptance of Protestantism by many noble
  families made the confusion worse.</p>

  <p>The result of this unsettled state of the law caused endless trouble and
  disputes from generation to generation since these unions afterward declared
  illicit frequently produced children who bitterly upheld their right to be
  considered legitimate. This was the case with the Lord James, son of James V;
  he was unable to prove any marriage between his parents, yet believed there
  had been some secret ceremony that saved his mother's honour and fired his
  own ambition.</p>

  <p>Lord Bothwell had repudiated a second lady met in Denmark and solemnly
  bound to him by the laws of her country. She was a considerable heiress and
  it was believed in Scotland that Bothwell had abandoned the prize only in the
  audacious hope of some even more advantageous match. His father was supposed
  to have courted Mary of Guise, while other ambitious forbears had endeavoured
  to obtain the hands of other widowed Queens: Jane Beaufort married to James I
  and Mary of Guelders married to James II. Like most highly placed Scots, the
  Hepburns were for ever hankering after the crown.</p>

  <p>James Hepburn, the fourth Earl of Bothwell, had more honours than any
  other Protestant subject possessed. He held the fortresses of Hales and
  Crichton, was Keeper of Hermitage Castle that defended the Southern Marches
  and in defence of his country had committed 'great damage' to the English on
  these wild and undefined Borders; Throckmorton, who had named him 'the
  worst', had also named him 'the stoutest'. Save for the Hamiltons and the
  Lennox Stewarts with their claims on the crown, Bothwell had no equal in
  Scotland and he far outshone Châtelherault (Arran), head of the Hamiltons,
  and Mathew Lennox, head of the Stewarts, in all strong qualities and in a
  most formidable boldness, arrogance and audacity. He was nearly ten years
  older than Mary of Scotland, well shaped, skilful in all knightly exercises,
  healthy, active and gay, with the comeliness of early athletic manhood.</p>

  <p>The Queen saw him frequently and commended the abilities that had won him
  so high a place in her mother's counsels. Both these Princesses needed all
  the help they could get in Scotland, for Elizabeth was intriguing there with
  unscrupulous skill, using the weak, erratic Châtelherault (Arran) and his
  feeble son as her puppet pretenders against Mary. Another catspaw of the
  English Queen was Mathew Lennox, who had once deserted to Henry VIII. His
  young son, Henry Stewart, showed the good looks and manly bearing so highly
  prized among princes and with his claims on both the island thrones he was
  important. Elizabeth kept her eye on the Lennox family, who, though possessed
  of large estates on the Clyde at Glasgow, frequently resided in England.</p>

  <p>On the surface the Spanish marriage and that of the King's sister, the
  famous Margaret of Valois, with the Duke of Savoy were celebrated by smoothly
  contrived and joyous amusements; underneath the feasting and jousts, the
  shows and the balls, intrigues wove a complicated pattern round the central
  passion, the struggle between the Church of Rome and the Reformation. The
  ageing Constable viewed with uneasy distrust the increasing power of the
  Guises; he even secretly lent an ear to the Protestant party in the person of
  their fickle leader in France, Antoine, King of Navarre, and set himself
  against persecution for its own sake. He desired a solid peace and was
  inclined to allow the Scots their own faith if they were obedient subjects to
  Mary and Francis. He advised a drastic reduction in expenditure on such
  idleness as the royal weddings, which one after the other had exhausted the
  treasury. In brief he was inclined to temperate measures in order to settle
  the country after long wars, fruitless save for the capture of Calais, and
  continual rebellions that could, he considered, be met by religious
  toleration and a sympathetic consideration of the peasants' case.</p>

  <p>The marriage of the King's sister was fixed for July 18th (1559) and Paris
  was in a state of riotous excitement. All classes hoped for peace and
  prosperity from the Spanish alliance and the extravagant ceremonies: the
  gorgeous Mass for the Treaty, the Spanish marriage, the marriage of the Duke
  of Bouillon with Mademoiselle of Montpensier to be followed by the Savoy
  nuptials, the free sights, wine, food, the constant spectacles, the warm
  summer, all combined to lift the spirits of the Parisians. Few of them knew
  that after all the rejoicings were over, Henry II had resolved to march to
  Guyenne and Poictou, there to put down the heretics with 'extremest
  persecution, as Throckmorton on receiving his agents' reports noted, adding,
  'and the like in Scotland'.</p>

  <p>Nor could many of them have heard the news from the North. War had broken
  out against Mary of Guise and her Frenchmen. In temporary alliance with
  Châtelherault she faced with five thousand soldiers the army of Argyll and
  twenty thousand Scots roused in defence of their preachers.</p>

  <p>The royal women of France were nervous from exhaustion; the perpetual
  blaze of sunshine, lamps, candles, fireworks, the perpetual noise of singing,
  shouting, bells, chanting, the sickly perfumes, the rancid smells and gutter
  stenches, the weight of their clothes, their jewels, and private anxieties
  made them dizzy, light headed and a prey to superstition. Crowded into the
  gloomy, ancient Tournelles (the Louvre not being yet ready for more than
  ceremonies) they listened to soothsayers, witches and necromancers. Catherine
  de Medici was especially perturbed; she had fearful dreams that foretold, she
  declared, some shocking disaster.</p>

  <p>But the princesses rallied in full magnificence for the tournament to be
  held on June 30th. These so-called tournaments were anachronisms, based on
  the fictions that affected to describe the chivalry of the Middle Ages; they
  aped a state of society, of manners, ideals and fancies that were dead; they
  were mere feats of arms and displays of pageantry where both combatants and
  spectators were really maskers, playing an elaborate game, possible only to
  kings and princes.</p>

  <p>Catherine, still overcast by her dream, sent twice to Henry II begging him
  not to enter the lists again; the tournament was nearly over and had been
  successful, but the King wished to break a lance with Montgomery, captain of
  the Scots Guard. In vain Catherine implored the Duke of Savoy to dissuade the
  King from this intention. Wearing the black and white favours of Diane de
  Poitiers he insisted on meeting Montgomery, who did not wish to accept the
  challenge. Henry II was then middle-aged, stately, heavy, in good condition,
  but subject to fits of giddiness. One of these overcame him as he rode his
  charger at his opponent; he swerved in the saddle and Montgomery's lance
  splintered on the royal cuirass. A fragment of wood flew into Henry II's
  right eye and he fell from his horse.</p>

  <p>Amid fervent and alarmed lamentations the King was carried to the
  Tournelles. In a few days he was dead; he had never regained consciousness.
  The grief of the aristocrats was sincere, and in the opinion of many of his
  subjects he had been a good ruler and a likeable man; but Throckmorton
  cautiously noted that the poorer sort, in town and country,
  'rejoiced'&mdash;adding openly that the King's 'dissolute life' and
  persecution of the Protestants had provoked 'God's fast vengeance'.</p>

  <p>The Guises stepped at once into supreme power, for Mary and Francis were
  now Queen and King. The Cardinal took his royal charges and the widowed
  Queen, Catherine, to the hastily prepared, incomplete new apartments at the
  Louvre. Mary Stewart at once sent to Diane de Poitiers to demand the crown
  jewels&mdash;with an inventory. (The fallen favourite had behaved with the
  same promptitude towards Madame d'Estampes, mistress of Francis I.) Accepting
  her expected eclipse with dignity, Diane de Poitiers surrendered the jewels
  and the château of Chenonceaux in exchange for Chaumont and retired from the
  Court. She was well provided for. The Cardinal dismissed her friends from
  their offices and soon instructed Francis II to dismiss the Constable, his
  father's one friend. The Guises took no warning from the fact that a large
  number of nobles followed Montmorency into retirement rather than serve under
  them; they carried matters with a high hand and ruled the country between
  them. Mary, now Queen of France, went to St. Germain-en-Laye, Francis to
  Meudon, where he proved incapable of attending to affairs. Catherine, so long
  effaced, showed an unexpected interest in matters of State but flattered the
  Guises and offered no opposition to their ambitions.</p>

  <p>Mary was again ill. Throckmorton, still hammering on the coat-of-arms
  affront, saw her when she was able to attend to business. She fainted at
  table and stimulants were needed to bring her to her senses and he reported
  that she 'looked very evil' and in 'a dangerous case'. Malcontent Bourbons
  were meeting at Vendome, but their head, the King of Navarre, joined the
  Guises; the Cardinal was 'Pope and King', indeed without question one of the
  greatest men in Europe. Francis II at the age of fifteen and a half years had
  attained his majority, but there was no pretence on anyone's part that he was
  anything but a puppet of his wife's uncle. The young couple, both in ill
  health, spent the autumn of 1559 at Villiers-Cotterets, in the Valois château
  of that name.</p>

  <p>Villiers-Cotterets is near Soissons and Compiègne, in a country closely
  associated with the Valois Kings. It is not far from Paris and deserves a
  visit on its own account, though the castle where the fragile King and Queen
  revived in the fresh air after the stenchs of Paris has long since
  disappeared and new public buildings are on the site. This was a favourite
  seat of the Valois Kings and appointed with all the luxuries to which Mary
  was accustomed. Two magnificent staircases and a chapel in the present-day
  <i>Maison de Retraite</i> remain as relics of the one-time pomp that
  surrounded their Court. There yet stands, also, the forest encircling the
  town on all sides where Mary rode or walked, accompanied by her ladies, her
  retinue, and by her husband, when he was well enough to leave the château.
  She treated him with an invariable kindness and consideration, which he,
  naturally affectionate and docile, gratefully returned. Sometimes the royal
  party rode through the woods of Villiers-Cotterets to the ancient Cistercian
  Abbey of Longport and reposed themselves in the nearby château.</p>

  <p>Languid and suffering as Mary was she had to rouse herself in order to
  accompany the King to Rheims for their coronation. Francis II had to travel
  in slow stages, resting at Longport, the abbey in the forest of
  Villiers-Cotterets, at La Fére and at Fismes, so the journey to Rheims took
  three days. Rheims was then a city of considerable pride and importance and
  some of the features of this period survive apart from the famous Cathedral.
  There is the Roman gate, the church of Saint Remi, ancient houses in the rue
  de Tambour and the place des Marches. The street behind the Cathedral and the
  Archbishops' Palace is named after the great Cardinal of Lorraine, who held
  the Archbishopric among his many benefices. Rheims possessed a singularly
  rich treasury; the offering of Francis II was a gold statue of his namesake,
  St. Francis.</p>

  <p>Rheims had prepared for the coronation for two months and the city had
  lent the Chapter money to cover the costs of the ceremonies. Once again
  costly pageantry celebrated the might and glory of the House of Guise when
  the Cardinal met the King in the beautifully decorated street, where the wind
  and rain of the first autumn storms battered and soaked tapestries, the
  herald's plumes and mantles, the litters where Mary and Elizabeth Valois, the
  Queen of Spain, reposed. The Court was, however, still in mourning for Henry
  II and there was a check on display. Mary alone did not wear some sign of
  mourning; the others, though subdued in splendour were allowed some
  relaxation for one day, but afterwards full mourning was resumed. The French
  set Mary's arms, quartered with England, over the Gates of Rheims, and at the
  banquet Throckmorton had to eat off a plate with similar bearings engraved
  thereon.</p>

  <p>Not only mourning, but the King's state of health, cast some gloom over
  the long, stately and exhausting ceremonies; yet the Guises abated nothing of
  their arrogance. The Cardinal was placed next to the King, and his brothers
  equated themselves with the royal Bourbons&mdash;thereby causing an
  undercurrent of hostile murmurings of which they were aware, but disdainful.
  If any men have ever committed the mistake of <i>hubris</i> they did, as
  intoxicated by success they freely indulged their pride and insolence.</p>

  <p>After the coronation the wearied sovereigns retired to Bar-le-Duc,
  residence of the young Duke of Lorraine, head of the elder branch of the
  family, of which the Duke of Guise was a cadet, and his Danish wife. The
  weather had cleared and the last pale sunshine of autumn embellished the
  noble château of the Lorraine princes, the scene of much of their former
  grandeur and the repository of many treasures, including the famous
  collection of that brilliant patron of the arts, King René I of Sicily.</p>

  <p>This ancient capital of the Duchy of Bar, situated on the River Ornain, is
  partly a delightful <i>ville haute</i> or 'old town'; for the rest, a centre
  of varied industry. The clock tower, the church of St. Etienne, containing
  the macabre tomb of René de Chalons, Prince of Orange, the house, No. 21 on
  the <i>place de la Hanes</i>, now a museum, the old houses in the <i>rue des
  Ducs-de-Bar</i> all date from before Mary's time. The avenue of limes leads
  to what is left of the château&mdash;some of the foundation stones and a
  Gothic doorway. It is still possible to ascend the terraces here and see the
  view over the valley of the shallow and sparkling river, bordered now as
  always with delicate trees. The height of these terraces, once 'hanging
  gardens', the houses, each of individual design, bearing famous Barrois
  names, giving a rock-like appearance to the town, have caused Bar-le-Duc to
  be compared to Edinburgh; but the resemblance is extremely superficial.</p>

  <p>The news from Scotland became worse with every dispatch. Mary of Guise had
  been deposed from the Regency by the Scots and was in wretched health and a
  desperate situation; the Guises, while affecting a tolerant attitude,
  secretly retaliated by urging on renewed religious persecutions. Mary
  Stewart's illness returned; she again fainted on public occasions and had to
  be carried to her chamber.</p>

  <p>From Bar-le-Duc the Court moved to Paris; here there were more ceremonies
  for the departure of Elizabeth Valois for Spain, and when she was preparing
  to go on her long, sumptuous journey, the King and Queen moved to Blois,
  since the harassed medical advisers could think of no better cure for their
  continual ill health than constant 'change of air'. By November the royal
  arms, still quartering England, was set up over the gates of the Château of
  Blois. Throckmorton, a deeply interested observer, once again remarked that
  Mary was extremely ill; her bloodless look was notable and she was often
  enclosed in her chamber.</p>

  <p>Catherine was frightened by the growing lassitude of Francis II. Rumours
  as to the nature of his disease were spreading among the common folk and when
  he rode abroad in the country of the Loire he was avoided, even the wood
  cutters flying at his approach. Fearing a plot, the King ordered the arming
  of the Scots Guard. The common belief, however, was that he suffered from
  leprosy and as the cure of this was the blood of young children the peasants
  were hastening home to protect their families. The story arose because of the
  history of Queen Catherine. Her parents had died of the same malady within a
  year of their marriage, and this malady was thought to be leprosy that had
  been transmitted through Catherine to her sickly offspring. Both the Guises
  and the Bourbons were suspected of spreading these rumours, but the truth was
  that popular hatred of the mounting arrogance of the House of Guise extended
  to its puppet. The people grew bold, rescued heretics on their way to
  punishment, and if a child was missing an angry party would follow and stone
  the royal train so that the King gave up his sad amusement of the hunt.</p>

  <p>Catherine was told by the physicians that he could not live long and he
  could not have an heir. In November the Court was near Poitiers, to take
  final leave of Elizabeth of Spain. Mary and Francis had meant to accompany
  her as far as Bayonne, but there was a delay in the arrival of some of the
  dresses from Paris. The winter closed in and the Court returned to Blois. The
  pale and beautiful town rises above the river, backed by the forest, with
  steep streets leading to the Cathedral, and the Castle remains one of the
  most unspoiled of Mary's royal residences, as well as one of the most
  celebrated for the grandeur and grace of the main buildings. The tower of the
  one-time mansion of the Guises still remains; now, as at Bar-le-Duc, there
  are terrace views over a river valley. The scenery of the Loire is some of
  the most refined, decorative and peaceful in Europe, a fitting background to
  this noble residence that bore the imprint of the taste of Diane de Poitiers,
  whose likeness is preserved in the slender, cold and entrancing statues of
  Jean Goujon.</p>

  <p>Mary ascended the staircase, one of the most beautiful ever constructed,
  she walked along the exquisite open galleries, she slept, amused herself,
  mourned over Scotland, and consulted with the Cardinal of Lorraine in the
  light and airy rooms of the Italian pleasure house built by Francis I. She
  visited the nursery in the elaborate panelled and decorated chambers where
  Queen Catherine governed her younger children, she looked down on each of the
  four courts, and she went with her mother-in-law to hear sermons in the
  chapel. Francis II was nervously restless; he left Blois for Chambord after
  Christmas 1560, having written six letters in one day to Mary of Guise,
  anxiously inquiring after her health.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal of Lorraine had bought the Château Gaillard at Amboise and
  planned for the Court to move to that town for Lent. Disregarding medical
  opinion as to the health of the King, and the seething discontent of France,
  he prepared for a long continuance of power. He intended to deal with State
  business as regent (or dictator) in Château Gaillard, while Mary and
  Catherine diverted themselves in the Castle and Francis spent his time in a
  succession of hunting parties and visits to the neighbouring seats of the
  nobility and gentry.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal's main difficulty was money. The wars had to be paid for; he
  was obliged to outrage his brothers' veterans by refusing promised rewards.
  There were the Swiss, the Bankers, the Venetians pursuing him for the
  repayment of loans; there were still unpaid accounts for the reckless
  expenditure on the royal weddings. Disappointed soldiers and creditors joined
  the opposition to the Cardinal headed by the Bourbons and the Montmorencys,
  and the country was thrown into further discontent by the royal edicts
  against the Protestants. Coligny was writing to Calvin, and by February
  (1560) a group of conspirators against the Guises had met at Nantes. The
  ringleader was one La Renaerdie, believed by the plotters to be an agent of
  the Prince de Condé. The intention was to free France of the brothers and to
  put to death the Cardinal. A vague uneasiness, based on confused reports and
  the cautious gloom of soothsayers, troubled the Court at Amboise, but the
  Cardinal's vigilance could not discover any tangible danger; the country
  seemed quiet. The Court was as safe as they could be in any part of the
  country in the massive fortress of Amboise on the sharp rock above the town,
  with the great towers facing one way the wood and one way the forest, the
  long galleries overlooking the Loire between the sandy banks.</p>

  <p>Throckmorton saw the two Queens here in March. Mary spoke in flattering
  terms of Elizabeth who would, she said, find her a better neighbour in
  Scotland than ever 'the rebels' could be. This month the Guises received
  repeated warnings that a conspiracy had been formed against them and the
  brothers became considerably alarmed. They were even frightened into
  proclaiming an amnesty for all malcontents, provided they lived 'as good
  Catholics'. A traitor in his party revealed the Nantes plot to the Cardinal;
  the Duke of Lorraine put the Castle of Amboise in a state of defence and
  rounded up some of La Renaerdie's men already advancing through the woods;
  Condé threw himself into Amboise, thus dissociating himself from the
  conspirators; the peasants and traders who had been encouraged to appear
  before the Castle to plead for religious toleration found themselves
  abandoned; the Duke, now Lieutenant-General of France, was in possession of
  the situation. Despite the edict that had promised pardon to all who went
  home quietly, another was issued excepting those who had taken part in the
  rebellion, and arrests instantly followed. The revenge taken by the Guises
  for their alarms and fears was ferocious; there were so many prisoners that
  the prison vaults of the Castle could not contain them and they were bound
  and flung into the Loire.</p>

  <p>The tumult of Amboise cost four hundred and sixty lives. These victims of
  the Guises were put to death by torture, and Throckmorton reported that they
  'died very constantly singing of psalms'. Another large number were sent to
  the galleys. The massacre of the prisoners took place in the courtyard of
  Amboise; the Court watched from the windows, the Cardinal gloating over the
  scenes of blood as if these had been part of a merrymaking. The ladies also
  watched; one was the daughter-in-law of the Constable and the details of the
  torture, unexpected by this young girl, struck her with such horror that she
  fell dead among her companions. One of the courtiers was taken ill and died
  shortly afterwards, muttering: 'Cardinal, Cardinal, thou has damned us
  all!'</p>

  <p>Antoinette de Bourbon lamented when she heard of the excess of cruelty;
  she feared that it would react on the House of Guise. Mary could not escape
  knowing what was happening, but she made no attempt to interfere. She went
  frequently to Chenonceaux, the lovely Palace over the river, and there joined
  the dancing, the songs, the puppet shows and the gossip that amused the
  idleness of the Court. Wherever she went she displayed the arms of England.
  On her return visits to Amboise she saw traces of the recent martyrdoms and
  the rows of heads decaying on the Castle walls.</p>

  <p>Passion Week was held at Marmontiers, near Tours, and the Cardinal
  preached while revolt gathered in Dauphiné. A war of pamphlets began; the
  Paris rioters tried to burn the Guise hotels; the Cardinal went armed; all
  members of the royal family feared assassination. Mary and Francis hunted,
  day after day, round Chartres and Chateaudun, but bad news from Scotland
  pursued them. The Lords had entered Edinburgh, their leaders being Argyll,
  Glencairn and the Lord James. The followers of John Knox were, as a
  whirlwind, pulling down abbeys and churches. John Knox had come much to the
  front and his influence was used violently against the Queen Regent. To Mary
  he was the symbol of all she feared and hated.</p>

  <p>In the June of 1560 Mary nearly lost her Scots crown, and her best friend,
  her mother. Elizabeth Tudor, with a fierce challenge to the House of Guise,
  persecutors of the Reformation that held her on the English throne, attacked
  Scotland by land and sea. The Regent withdrew to Edinburgh Castle but the
  Scots drove the invaders back at Leith and on the Borders. One of the Guise
  brothers, René, Marquis d'Elbceuf, made ready to set sail to fetch the dying
  woman back to France; storms delayed his departure. Mary of Guise died, worn
  out by the toils and miseries of her thankless tasks, and the Protestant
  Lords, though moved by her sad and pious end, hastened to conclude with
  Elizabeth Tudor the Treaty of Edinburgh, July 6th (1560). This bitter 'bone
  of contention', as it proved to be, was signed by the Lords, without
  reference to Mary and her husband.</p>

  <p>The terms were a triumph for the Reformation. Mary Stewart was to resign
  her claims on the English crown, all Scots offices were to be in Scots hands,
  the French were to withdraw from Scotland. The harder terms that Elizabeth
  Tudor demanded, the return of Calais, they refused, but the French
  Commissioners signed the Treaty at this time. To add to the slights she put
  on Mary Stewart, Elizabeth had sheltered Arran, son of the Duke of
  Châtelherault, who had escaped from France in female disguise and who even
  hoped to marry the Queen of England and thus unite their claims to the two
  thrones. Lady Catherine Grey was the heiress presumptive, in Protestant eyes,
  to Elizabeth who, however, ignored her claims and kept her in disgrace
  because of a secret marriage.</p>

  <p>Mary Stewart's distress on hearing of the death of her mother was so acute
  as to bring on another severe illness; the intrigues of Elizabeth disturbed
  her as well as her grief. This encouragement of Arran was a special cause of
  furious vexation to the Guises, and to Mary Stewart. The young Queen's
  prostration alarmed her uncles; so frequent were her fainting fits that some
  observers thought she suffered from <i>petit mal</i> or epilepsy; her tears
  and passions were often followed by long spells of unconsciousness; forecasts
  that she 'would not live long' were constantly made; she 'passed from one
  agony to another'.</p>

  <p>In August (1560) a funeral service was held for Mary of Guise in Notre
  Dame, Paris, and arrangements were made for bringing her body to France. In
  August also Throckmorton saw Mary at Fontainebleau. She appeared anxious for
  the friendship of Elizabeth, for a peaceful settlement of all political and
  religious questions; her conventional remarks were made 'in Scottish'.</p>

  <p>The English envoy pressed for the ratification of the Treaty of Edinburgh.
  The apt pupil of the Guises evaded this sore point; she had, she said, to
  defer to her husband. On his second interview Throckmorton listened to Mary
  praising Elizabeth as 'a fair, sweet lady' and suggesting that they exchange
  portraits. Mary wondered why Throckmorton should have admired a portrait of
  her in mourning, adding that she liked herself better when she looked merry.
  The Englishman's reply was gracious; he had wanted the miniature showing Mary
  in mourning (for Henry II) as she had spoken to him so kindly when wearing
  that attire. That same month Mary and her husband were present at an assembly
  named a meeting of <i>The Notables</i> in the great hall at Fontainebleau.
  The affairs of France were so desperate that the Guises had been forced to
  agree to this gathering of the great ones of France, but they had an
  unexpected enemy in a woman they had overlooked, even despised. Catherine de
  Medici had a growing influence over Francis II, and her natural cleverness,
  prudence and skill in intrigue had quickly made her a formidable opponent to
  the Guises.</p>

  <p>Mary had no influence over the feeble Francis; with his mother he was
  still a sick child and relied on her for all his comfort. Mary, impelled by
  her pride of birth, had murmured that the Queen Dowager was 'the daughter of
  traders', thereby only repeating the common gibe flung at the Medici
  princess. Both the women were lonely, far from their native countries and
  held themselves warily against enemies; both were driven on by a restless
  ambition that neither the despondency caused by perpetual illnesses nor the
  perils of their situations could deter. Neither Catherine, the matron of
  early middle age, nor Mary, the young girl, was willing to abate one jot of
  her pretensions to absolute power, even though these cost her all her ease
  and the sacrifice of her natural affections. In her chair of state, seated in
  the regal apartments of Catherine in the château of Fontainebleau, Mary
  watched and listened in silence while the struggle that was to convulse her
  reign and torment her private life was opened.</p>

  <p>The Guises, whose arrogance had lost them all aristocratic support and
  whose cruelties had estranged the nation, were obliged to attend this
  assembly in order to give an account of their actions. They wished to avoid a
  meeting of the States General and they were embittered at being forced to
  defend themselves before a hostile gathering. This affront they attributed to
  the influence of Catherine de Medici. After a routine opening speech by
  Francis, the Queen Mother spoke; she asked the assembly for advice as to
  means of pacifying her son's realm.</p>

  <p>The Guises had nothing but bad news to give. The Cardinal admitted the
  ruinous state of the country's finances. On the second sitting Mary witnessed
  a dramatic scene: Coligny presented the petitions to the King from the
  Protestants of France in which they asked for religious tolerance. Coligny
  stood in danger of arrest, perhaps of instant death, in thus defying the
  butchers of Amboise; but their wrath was restrained by the knowledge that
  Coligny's uncle, the Constable, had eight hundred soldiers outside the
  château. Coligny had also the secret encouragement of Catherine, who was
  using him as a counterpoise to the Guises. A second petition was addressed to
  her 'to take pity on the Lord's people'.</p>

  <p>The learned, adroit and dissolute lay Bishop of Valence replied with
  moderation and with wise counsels to the appeals of Coligny. Under the glare
  of the Guises he dared to blame the Roman Church for the success of the
  Reformation, not even sparing the Popes. He also glanced at the reckless
  frivolity and foolish licence of the Court and begged the two Queens to set
  an example of religious observances and austere lives. He loathed the recent
  persecutions; he had recently returned from Scotland and knew that the
  country had been nearly (if not quite) lost to Rome through the cruel
  excesses of bishops and priests; he warned the Pope (glancing the while at
  the Cardinal) that France, if His Holiness refused to call a General Council,
  would summon a National Council. Another lay Churchman, the sick and anxious
  Archbishop of Vienne, a man of a noble personal character, wise and liberal,
  added his warning to that of Valence: 'France could not persecute in order to
  please the Pope'. He, too, urged the holding of a National Council, at which
  in this state of crisis all parties might be represented.</p>

  <p>The Guises felt these words of enlightened advice to be personal affronts.
  Coligny's assertion that fifty thousand signatures lay behind his petitions
  the Duke accepted as a challenge&mdash;the King (the Guises) could retort
  with 'a million' names. The Cardinal spoke with artful composure; he was, in
  order to gain time, for half measures. He agreed to the National Council, but
  not to the convocation of the States General. He regretted the rigours of the
  persecutions, he desired the 'poor erring ones' to be argued into a return to
  the fold, but he resisted religious toleration; he fell back on his poor
  puppet, Francis; 'the King could not give it without fear of damnation'.</p>

  <p>The meetings marked the beginning of the political defeat of the Guises.
  The Cardinal had bent, but no one believed a man so essentially false; the
  Duke had not bent, but had revealed the temperament of a born persecutor;
  both had refused to listen to the noble common sense of their fellow
  Catholics, Valence and Vienne; both had refused to heed the warnings of the
  petitions, to take heed of the attitude of Coligny, once their friend, of
  that of the Bourbons. They had one reaction to the temper of the Assembly of
  Notables, that of revenge.</p>

  <p>Mary listened with interest and intelligence; she was unmoved by anything
  save the speeches of the brothers. The bigotry in which she had been so
  carefully bred was unshaken, but she had already learned to conceal both
  anger and boredom under an impassive courtesy. She smiled on Catherine, while
  fully understanding her malicious treachery.</p>

  <p>While the Court was yet at Fontainebleau the Guises had a chance to strike
  at their enemies, the Princes of the Blood who had cautiously kept away from
  the Assembly of Notables. A courier in the service of the King of Navarre was
  arrested, and letters of doubtful meaning found in his dispatch bag. Under
  torture he confessed to the existence of another plot against the Guises.
  Condé was again 'the hidden leader' as he had been, the Guises and the
  Protestants believed, in the tumult at Amboise. Duke and Cardinal resolved to
  make an end of Condé, and summoned the Bourbon Princes to join the Court at
  Orléans, where it moved after a short residence at St. Germain-en-Laye.</p>

  <p>The King was to visit Orléans because it was full of discontent. He went
  with a show of force and made a State entry, celebrated by the reluctant
  citizens with lavish pageantry. Queen Mary, riding a white horse, made the
  usual impression of charm and dignity. No one knew anything of her character.
  The praises of the courtier poets were mechanical; they sang of improbable
  beauties and impossible virtues. This was the strain they were used to employ
  about all the royal ladies.</p>

  <p>Mary exactly filled the part of idol of a luxurious and dissolute Court,
  elegant, decadent and bigoted. She had learned to bear herself like Diane de
  Poitiers and to think like the Guises. She was now a tall girl, lithe and
  graceful, refined and subtle. All the arts of the toilet emphasized her
  fashionable beauty; cosmetics as well as illness kept her complexion pearl
  pale, her brown hair was touched into gold, curled and plaited, elaborate
  gowns and the crown jewels of France concealed all of her person save her
  long hands, her calm face. Much of her fascination lay in her apparent
  candour. She was so intensely proud that she did not trouble to be haughty.
  Too great to be easily offended, she, once her royal state was allowed,
  smiled on all with a pleasing boldness, free from any condescension, and her
  smile, only slightly moving the fine lips and slightly narrowing the heavy
  eyes, was entrancing. Her frivolity had no trace of silliness. If her
  accomplishments were slight, her taste was perfect, and, despite constant
  illness and, lately, anxiety, the excessive formality of her attire and
  movements, her glance, her whisper, her delicate laughter hinted at vitality
  and zest for life. None of those who openly or secretly spied on her reported
  any scandal attached to her name; only the corrupt Bothwell, often at the
  Court, often in her train, made a brutal reference as to her relations with
  her uncle the Cardinal that told his measure, not hers; he served, for his
  own ends, the exquisite Queen he neither respected nor admired.</p>

  <p>Orléans was not only a refuge for Calvinists but was also the residence of
  a powerful body of University students, German and Dutch, who enjoyed ancient
  privileges as members of the old Frankish nation.</p>

  <p>The church of St. Croix, the new <i>hôtel de Ville</i> (modern in Mary's
  time) yet remain, the old <i>hôtel de Ville</i> is now a museum; the long
  <i>rue royale</i> leading to the Loire and <i>la rue du Tabour</i> contain
  some houses that existed at the time of the death of Mary's husband. The once
  rich church of St. Aignan is now a ruin, though it remains imposing. The
  Loire, even more familiar to Mary than the Seine, runs pleasantly through
  Orléans, but here is often no more than a trickle along the centre of the
  bed, though when full agreeable for boating. The country here, with much
  wood, is pleasant if without the unique beauties of the other reaches of the
  river by the other royal châteaux that Mary knew so well, Amboise and
  Chenonceaux.</p>

  <p>The royal pair were welcomed by the Bishop of Orléans in the Cathedral,
  and were afterwards lodged in the house of the provost, then in eclipse as a
  Protestant. The King, apt pupil of the Guises, could hardly be civil to him.
  Though well protected by thousands of their armed soldiery, the Guises were
  fearful of assassination, and did not join the royal processions. Arms were
  forbidden to the citizens; all suspected of Protestant sympathies were cast
  into the strengthened jails. By the end of the month (October) the Bourbon
  Princes, incredibly, arrived at Orléans. Condé was at once arrested; his
  brothers in vain humbled themselves in order to obtain his release.</p>

  <p>With affairs at this high, pitch of bitterness, Throckmorton again
  approached Mary to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh. Her answer was that of the
  Cardinal; she knew how to evade an issue, also how to show her hand Her words
  were full of menace; the Scots 'must be taught to know their duties&mdash;I
  am their Queen and must so be used'.</p>

  <p>A hunt was fixed for November. The King was no longer needed to over-awe
  Orléans; he could go to Chambord and Chenonceaux. He was, however, too ill to
  move and the perpetually repeated forecasts of the astrologers seemed likely
  to be justified.</p>

  <p>Francis, rapidly sinking into the final lethargy, showed symptoms beyond
  any cure known to any physician of the Court. His rigors and fevers, his
  'flux' and 'catarrh' were held to be inherited miseries from his Medici
  grandfather but not dangerous. The sudden cold of November was blamed for the
  severity of the attack. A running sore in the right ear was cured, only to
  cause the dammed-up poison to afflict jaw and teeth with agony and to the
  breaking out of abscesses. Catherine sent hex son to bed; the sick chamber
  was guarded from all but the nearest relatives. Mary, kind and self-effacing,
  stayed by the tormented boy and supervised the nursing; she was already
  accustomed to the most revolting illnesses and disorders, having almost daily
  experienced them herself or in the persons of Catherine and the royal
  children.</p>

  <p>The alarmed Guises hurried on the date for the execution of the death
  sentence on Condé; this was fixed for December loth, which was also that of
  the opening of the States General. The people believed that the Guises
  intended to force allegiance to the Catholic Faith from every member of this
  assembly; a darker rumour was that all the Protestants in Orleans were to be
  massacred in a desperate bid by the brothers for power before the death of
  Francis. The diplomats canvassed the prospects for Mary's second marriage;
  Catherine, in between visits of intercession to the churches, plotted for the
  future; the gloom in Orleans was intense; no one felt secure.</p>

  <p>Neither the brothers nor their niece could expect much from France after
  the death of the catspaw King. Mary's choice would lie between the heretic
  Scotland and a second marriage to Austria or Spain. The private tears so
  pitifully in contrast to her public serenity were not all for the dying
  boy.</p>

  <p>Even as he lay half unconscious the King was urged by the Cardinal to make
  a vow to all the Saints that if he recovered he would persecute the
  Protestants with renewed zeal. In the evening, December 5th (1560), Francis
  died. While the courtiers pressed to acknowledge his brother Charles, a
  weakling child of ten years, his mother was receiving the Constable,
  cunningly summoned by her secretly when she was certain Francis could not
  long survive. Pressing on from his exile, Montmorcency arrived in Orléans in
  time to forestall the Guises in seizing the town. He disarmed their soldiers
  and assumed military command of France. Condé was released. His brother, the
  King of Navarre, was Governor of the Realm under Catherine, now Regent for
  Charles IX. The Cardinal gave up the royal seal, and Mary the crown
  jewels.</p>

  <p>The young widow arrayed herself again in mourning and closed herself in a
  darkened chamber, lit only by tapers for the forty days of her official
  grief. She was treated with respect; the demand for the crown jewels was
  routine; the inventories were carefully checked and receipts given. Mary,
  against the advice of the Cardinal, retained some jewels as part of her
  dowry, and all those once belonging to Mary of Guise. In the same
  business-like manner the question of her future revenues was settled; she was
  to have a yearly income of 60,000 <i>livres tournois</i> drawn from the
  revenues of Touraine and Poitou.</p>

  <p>Throckmorton, himself ill, partly from home sickness, and smarting under
  the scandals caused by the highlong passion of Elizabeth Tudor for a married
  man, Robert Dudley, praised with strained hyperbole the 'high minded' conduct
  of Mary, so faithful, sorrowful, dignified and noble, buried with her grief
  'as if in a sepulchre'.</p>

  <p>Here, in this black-hung chamber, Mary received her uncles and the new
  power, in the person of the King of Navarre. The Guises had now fallen from
  all influence and credit; the Cardinal was not even chosen as spokesman of
  the Three Estates; his life was in danger from the fury of the people, so
  hated was he. Catherine was definitely Mary's enemy; she only wanted her out
  of the way, in Scotland, if possible, for the Regent did not want her married
  in Spain or Austria.</p>

  <p>When Mary left her seclusion, her wan beauty, her heavy weeds, her
  touching dignity moved all to pity and admiration.</p>

  <p>Throckmorton, in his dispatches home, cunningly dwelt on the decorum of
  Mary's behaviour and the gravity of her demeanour. He hoped that contrasts
  would continue to be drawn between this queenly dignity and the reckless
  folly of Elizabeth, still compromising herself with Robert Dudley, for whose
  sake, she hinted, she had refused one of Mary's potential suitors, the
  Austrian Archduke. The strange end of Sir Robert's wife, found dead at the
  bottom of the staircase in her home, Cummor. Hall, Oxfordshire, had cast even
  a worse slur on the character of the Tudor Queen; it was commonly believed
  that she had, at least, 'winked' at murder in order to marry the undesirable
  Dudley. Throckmorton was much troubled by this scandal and continually
  praised Mary for moving in a corrupt Court without incurring any blame. Even
  the spies in her establishment, those who listened to the gossip of chamber
  women and servants, heard nothing against her. She showed great courage also,
  for she was already tormented by the question of her second marriage. That
  which was most in her own interest was with Carlos, heir to Philip II, but
  Catherine and Elizabeth Tudor were resolutely against a union that would have
  so considerably strengthened the power of Spain. A proposal even more
  revolting to Catherine was that Mary should wait until Charles IX was a
  little older and marry him. As the Regent intended to rule her feeble-minded,
  diseased son herself all his life, she vehemently opposed putting him under
  the influence of the seductive widow of his brother and she eagerly pursued
  all means of driving Mary from France.</p>

  <p>Thus surrounded by heartless intrigues and treated harshly Mary went to
  Rheims for her Easter (1561). She was there joined by the Cardinal, who
  affected to find 'sweetness and rest' in his forced retirement from public
  affairs and to be wholly occupied in 'edifying his little flock'.</p>

  <p>Throckmorton, well informed by skilful secret agents, thought that Mary
  had retired to her family (her only friends) in order to arrange her second
  marriage. One of the Emperor's sons was supposed to be hoped for by the
  Cardinal; other suggestions were the King of Sweden, who was equally willing
  to marry Elizabeth Tudor, and William of Nassau, now Prince of Orange. Mary
  had other interests. She looked to her beauty, her clothes and her jewels,
  with careful inspection. Her grandmother and four of her brothers met Mary at
  Rheims; this party lodged in the Abbey of St. Pierre des Dames that was under
  the rule of one of Mary's aunts. The Cardinal's sermons to the 'little flock'
  were delivered in the church of the Abbey.</p>

  <p>The Abbey has gone, but a portion of the guest house remains and there we
  can see the first of those rooms still shown as 'said' to have been occupied
  by Mary, Queen of Scots. This is reached by a gloomy staircase. The only
  other relics of her time are some fine panels in some other rooms of the
  guest houses and&mdash;no doubt as to authenticity here&mdash;Mary's Book of
  Hours in the Library of Rheims; this, in a binding in the style made famous
  by the celebrated Jean Grolier, the magnificent bibliophile, then alive,
  shows the arms of Mary as Queen of France and Scotland. She gave it as a
  present to her aunt, Renée of Lorraine, the Abbess of St. Pierre des
  Dames.</p>

  <p>Mary, surrounded by friends and supporters, listened earnestly to the
  loving advice, to her so wise and agreeable, offered in these family
  councils, held in the Abbey or the Cardinal's hotel&mdash;the Archbishop's
  Palace. The Lord James, her half-brother, was coming to France, and the
  Lorrainers recognized an important force in this able, ambitious man who
  might so easily have been born heir to Mary's throne and who would obviously
  have made an excellent King. They thought he might yet be detached from the
  Protestant party and they were prepared to offer him a Cardinal's hat if he
  would return to the fold. The Lord James was already a favourite with
  Elizabeth Tudor who encouraged him, as she encouraged Arran and the Lennox
  Stewarts, with the object of fomenting trouble in Scotland for Mary.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal advised Mary to secure this formidable relative by any means
  in her power.</p>

  <p>Sentiment inclined Mary to accept this proposal. The Cardinal advised her
  also that she must rule over the whole of Scotland; the heretics were to be
  defeated ('expirated' if possible) by delayed and subtle means. At first they
  must, being so powerful, be spoken fairly and softly; besides, Huntly 'Cock
  o' the North' and head of Clan Gordon, in the opinion of the Lorrainers was,
  like most of the Scots, of doubtful loyalty to his Queen. The Scots Lords
  were, indeed, much entangled in their views and their relationships. The Lord
  James had dispensed with the priestly vows that had entitled him to handsome
  revenues, but kept the latter. Mary's half-sister, her father's daughter,
  Jane Stewart, had married Argyll, head of Clan Campbell and most powerful of
  the Protestant lords. It was probable that many of them besides the Lord
  James trafficked with Elizabeth, and the Lorrainers urged Mary to go very
  warily. Huntly's spokesman, Lesley, was to be refused; Mary would not head a
  rising in the Highlands, though the Northern nobles offered twenty thousand
  men.</p>

  <p>Sir James Melville, who had urged Mary's return to Scotland, had strongly
  advised her to trust most those counsellors who were of the Reformed Faith.
  He suggested the Lord James and Argyll as fitting friends and recommended
  Lethington and Grange as trustworthy advisers. The Cardinal agreed with
  Melville; it was wise 'to serve the time' even if this meant the highly
  distasteful expedient of seeming to tolerate the heretics.</p>

  <p>After carefully absorbing all this good advice Mary proceeded to
  Joinville, by way of Châlons and Saint-Dizier. She saw Lesley the Scots
  Catholic at Vitry-le-Francois in Champagne and gave him the answer that the
  Cardinal had told her to give. On the same advice she replied in friendly
  terms to the Lord James at Saint-Dizier and afterwards at Joinville, where
  the Guises entertained and measured wits with the brilliant Scot, who was as
  shrewd as they were and as ambitious, though neither so cruel nor so
  unscrupulous.</p>

  <p>The first loyalty of the Lord James was to the Reformation; he was
  prepared to serve Mary&mdash;and no man could serve her better&mdash;as long
  as she was true to her promises of religious toleration. He wished to keep
  the Guises out of Scotland; for that reason he fostered a diplomatic
  friendship with Elizabeth Tudor. He wanted England as a balance to France in
  Scotland affairs. His pride was affronted, and his suspicions aroused, by the
  behaviour of the Guises at Joinville. Mary tried to persuade the Lord James
  to accept a Cardinal's hat; the bribe disgusted the arrogance of a man who
  felt he should be a king. He sternly told the Queen (and so wrote to her
  after he had left Joinville): For the love of God, Madame, do not press
  matters of religion'&mdash;not 'glancing at the Cardinal on the advice of any
  man on earth.' He also warned Mary that her French relations knew nothing of
  Scotland and could net understand the strength of the feeling of the Scots
  for Protestantism.</p>

  <p>But Mary was too deeply imbued with the doctrines of the Guises to take
  any need of the moderate words of her half-brother as opposed to the bigotry
  of the Cardinal, and resorted to the dissimulation by then habitual to her.
  The Lord James was outspoken in his condemnation of the Scottish adventurers
  who, travelling to and from France and their own country, had continually
  made mischief. He boldly denounced the 'idle vagabonds who were never able to
  live quietly in a settled commonwealth', and this was taken as a hint at the
  restless Bothwell and others of his like. Mary outwardly accepted the
  distasteful advice. 'not to mell with religion'; and the Lord James, after
  long conferences with the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Cardinal Louis at
  Joinville, departed for Scotland.</p>

  <p>After he had left, Mary went to Nancy to stay with the Duke of Lorraine
  and his Duchess. Here she was received with the usual costly entertainments,
  hunts, games, plays, dances and concerts. But Mary was not long at Nancy; her
  health failed again. Over-exercise in the hunting field was blamed for the
  attack of tertian fever that laid her prostrate and made it impossible for
  her to attend the coronation of Charles IX on May 15th (1561).</p>

  <p>Nancy, the capital of Lorraine, has little to show that is associated with
  Mary's brief sojourn there, but it is a city so important and so rich in
  charm and varied interest that any excuse may serve for a visit. As it was
  from the twelfth century the chief residence of the Dukes of Lorraine it was
  a flourishing city when Mary went there, troubled, ill and despondent, after
  seeing Lesley and the Lord James, in the spring of 1561. Between the gates
  <i>Porte de la Graffe</i> and <i>Porte Royale</i> are the remains of the old
  town and the first residence of the Dukes of Lorraine, known as the Ducal
  Palace. In this building is an exhaustive collection of objects once
  belonging to, or celebrating the exploits of members of the House of
  Lorraine. But there is nothing that has any connection with the Queen of
  Scotland, who once raised the ambitious hopes of the cadet branch of the
  Lorrainers to the highest pitch. The magnificent monuments in the church of
  the Cordeliers were there at the time of Mary's visit and there are various
  ancient buildings that help the imagination to reconstruct this town of many
  memories as she knew it.</p>

  <p>Mary's health failing desperately, she soon returned to Joinville and the
  care of her beloved grandmother, Antoinette de Bourbon. At Nancy she had been
  vexed by the importunities of one Somers, sent by Throckmorton to insist on
  Elizabeth Tudor's two famous points: ratification of the Treaty of Edinburgh
  and assurance that Ma would not accept the Spanish marriage. Mary had
  promised answers at Rheims but remained, sick and melancholy, in the charming
  seclusion of Joinville.</p>

  <p>By June (1561) she had recovered and was obliged to return to Paris. She
  had to face again Throckmorton's importunities. These were as tiresome to him
  as to her, but he was not allowed home until he had obtained the ratification
  of the Treaty and the promise about the Spanish marriage. He was also ill and
  most impatient to have these tedious matters settled. Mary, composed and
  courteous, was still evasive. Now she fell back on the Estates of
  Scotland&mdash;she was 'soon returning home and must ask their advice'. She
  changed the subject by asking Throckmorton for a passport from Elizabeth; she
  might have to sail near the English fleet; she might have to put into an
  English port, by reason of the weather, and proceed overland.</p>

  <p>Throckmorton eagerly offered the passport in return for acceptance of his
  mistress's demands; he also made a suggestion that if listened to would have
  spared much bitter trouble, not only for Mary but for the world in general
  and the British islands in particular; he urged Mary to adopt the Reformed
  Faith. She at once rejected this politely wise advice. Throckmorton repeated
  the rumours that her uncle was secretly a heretic, but Mary, unmoved,
  answered that she ought to know his views and that she had always clearly
  understood his meaning. She promised toleration but declared that sooner than
  forsake her faith she would be 'the sole Catholic in Scotland'.</p>

  <p>Here spoke, not only the bigot, but the inexperienced girl she declared
  herself to be; she knew nothing of what it would be like to rule a Protestant
  country according to the views of the Cardinal of Lorraine; and she knew very
  little of the Scots.</p>

  <p>As Throckmorton had proved useless in the matter of the passport, the
  Guises sent Mary's uncle, M. d'Oysel, and Catherine sent a letter in the name
  of Charles IX to Elizabeth Tudor formally demanding this safe conduct. Both
  the opposing parties were now eager for Mary to leave France, the Guises that
  she might stake her claim to Scotland, Catherine in order to be rid of her as
  soon as possible. The passport was a routine business; it was never refused
  save in states of war. Humanity as well as courtesy demanded that the perils
  of long voyages should not be added to by danger from foreign shipping and
  the closing of foreign ports.</p>

  <p>M. d'Oysel was not successful with Elizabeth who at once, haggling, set
  the passport against the Treaty ratification. She herself wrote to Catherine,
  Mary and Charles IX, covering her harsh terms with flowery expressions of
  goodwill that deceived no one. Afraid that even her friends in France would
  find her conduct surprising, she sent the hard-driven Throckmorton to explain
  matters (that were already clear enough) to the King of Navarre and the
  Constable. No one supposed that Elizabeth would hold out about the passport,
  and arrangements were begun for Mary's departure from France.</p>

  <p>Throckmorton hurried to and fro; among those whom he anxiously interviewed
  was Bothwell, then paying one of his flying visits to France. The Englishman
  picked up rumours and gossip and reported Mary's wrath against John Knox. For
  all her protested toleration she showed her hand by imprudently talking of
  schemes to banish the dangerous Reformer, since she could not live in the
  same realm with him, and to make matters more difficult sent Elizabeth a copy
  of Knox's book written against 'the monstrous regiment (rule) of Women'.
  Throckmorton tried to explain away this unfortunate diatribe against Queens
  by writing to Elizabeth that Knox greatly admired her, and excepted her from
  his charges. He was most useful to England while in Scotland and must not be
  driven out.</p>

  <p>The passport did not arrive and when M. D'Oysel returned without it Mary
  was ill with anxiety and chagrin. She knew, however, that dignity and
  restraint would turn this defeat to her advantage. It was plain to
  Throckmorton that she was angry when he next waited on her but she was calm
  and drew him aside in order to speak with him privately, in contrast, she
  said, to Elizabeth, who had refused M. d'Oysel before a number of people.</p>

  <p>But, though Mary was stately and spirited, her defiance of the powerful
  Elizabeth showed none of that shrewd diplomacy she was credited with
  displaying. Pride of birth lay behind her sharp regret that she had ever
  asked Elizabeth for what she did not require; she could go to her own realm
  without the licence of Elizabeth. Mary then brought up old grievances. King
  Henry had tried to capture her when she went to France, but she had escaped;
  she was not without friends, though doubtless Elizabeth thought so, and,
  personally, considered herself in every way the equal of Elizabeth. As to the
  oft-demanded ratification, there was a disingenuous excuse; she, Mary, could
  not ratify the Treaty unless she was allowed to go to Scotland to consult the
  Estates.</p>

  <p>The interview ended in arguments, courteous on both sides, leading
  nowhere. Throckmorton spoke to Catherine, but the Regent, who wanted nothing
  but the departure of Mary, upheld her in her refusal to comply with
  Elizabeth's demands. Seeing that he could not move these women, both as
  obstinate as his own mistress, he took his leave. Mary's tone was now one of
  reproachful melancholy; she felt herself obliged to risk the voyage and if
  Elizabeth captured her and 'made a sacrifice' of her, it might be 'better
  than for me to live&mdash;God's will be done'. She knew, however, that
  Elizabeth had not the least excuse for violence, and that the Scots were far
  more dangerous to her safety than the English Queen. She was also very much
  in love with life, as those usually are who offer so cheerfully to surrender
  it, provided they will never be taken at their word.</p>

  <p>In all her indignation against Elizabeth Mary forgot the deadly offence
  she had given in assuming the royal arms. Faithful to her plan of always
  blaming someone else for her actions, she now lightly declared that this step
  had been taken on the advice of others; as an inexperienced girl she knew
  nothing about it. She frequently got behind her youth and ignorance, yet when
  Elizabeth referred to these two drawbacks in a Queen, Mary was hotly
  indignant and contrived to hold her own with Throckmorton, who was still
  impressed by her skill in debate and her quick mind.</p>

  <p>She was again residing at 'St. Germains', as the English termed St.
  Germain-en-Laye, and the French Court took the opportunity of holding jousts
  in the tilt-yard of the Abbey and festivals on the Seine. Mary's constant
  amusements, the gay and heedless air of her Court, had already been adversely
  commented upon by the Roman Catholic Bishops of Valence and Vienne and
  reports of her ill-timed gaiety were coldly received by the Reformed party in
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>In July she moved towards Calais, with a sumptuous train of personal
  attendants, the Guises and an escort of several notables. At
  St.-Germain-en-Laye she had said farewell to many who had been her constant
  companions for the thirteen years she had been in France. Vows of everlasting
  friendship had been exchanged, even with the Regent who was willing to swear
  confirmation of 'the ancient land and league' between France and Scotland as
  long as Mary was moving from the path of her ruthless ambition.</p>

  <p>Mary stayed at the Constable's house at Manly. There both the Cardinal and
  the Duke of Guise were overcome by an endemic infection; the King of Navarre
  also succumbed. A warning given by Nostradamus as to the danger of poison for
  the House of Guise was instantly recalled. But the Cardinal and the King
  quickly recovered, and though the Duke was still unwell he accompanied Mary
  to Beauvais and Abbeville, where she received Throckmorton for the last time
  on French soil. Mary used her familiar arguments regarding ratification of
  the Treaty of Edinburgh. Her uncles, she declared, were not advising her in
  this matter, but, being so 'young and inexperienced' she was obliged to
  consult her Scots subjects. With this obvious untruth, and concealing under
  her pleasant manner her knowledge of the secret treaty she had signed upon
  the advice of the Guises, the treaty that sold Scotland to France, Mary
  dismissed Throckmorton.</p>

  <p>Had he known this, his hand would have been greatly strengthened in
  denying the pathetic 'unarmed widow' her passport. There was talk of Mary
  'stealing away from Calais' (so lately captured by the Duke of Guise from
  England), of her sailing to a Flemish port and so avoiding the English coast;
  but on August 14th she embarked at Calais for Leith. She was herself in 'a
  great ship' and escorted by another of equal size, while accompanying these
  vessels were two galleys. Despite her protests that the House of Guise was
  not meddling in her affairs, she took with her three of her maternal uncles,
  Claude, Duke of Aumale, the Grand Prior, and René, the Marquis d'Elboeuf;
  those she said her sorrowful farewells to on the beach were the Duke of
  Guise, the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Cardinal Louis.</p>

  <p>The four Manes who had left Scotland with their mistress returned with
  her, all unwed. Among her train of French singing boys, musicians, pages,
  dressmakers, milliners, dwarfs, jesters, puppet masters, apothecaries and
  perfumers were Pierre de Boscohel de Chastelard, a verse-writing page in the
  household of one of Mary's gentlemen, the Marshal Damville, and Pierre de
  Bourdeilles, Sieur de Brantôme, a secular abbé and an accomplished courtier.
  These two men were in their twenty-first years, both were already finished
  productions of the Court of France. Chastelard wrote flattering verses in the
  style of Ronsard, Du Bellay and Maisonfleur, Marot and the Pleiades, those
  poets who had made a deity of Mary of Scotland. Brantôme was collecting
  gossip and scandal for memoirs in which famous names would be attached to
  old, idle and licentious tales. Some grains of truth, and a lively study of
  his own times, are to be found in these cynical and cold studies of
  'Illustrious Dames' 'Gallant Dames' and 'Great Captains', but accuracy was
  not much regarded by Brantôme when he, his own adventures over, described the
  scandalous lives of the beautiful ladies and the grave men who had been
  Mary's companions at the French Court.</p>

  <p>Mary also brought home with her (if Scotland could be termed her home) a
  magnificent collection of costly jewels, set with the utmost skill of the
  goldsmiths' art, a treasury of vessels for sacred and secular use in gold and
  silver, adorned with enamels and precious stones, a sumptuous array of
  personal and toilet articles of exquisite workmanship and costly materials,
  sets of priceless church embroideries and a wardrobe of hundreds of dresses,
  each a work of art in cut, style and adornment. Furs, hats, gloves, shoes,
  stockings were of rare material and beautifully made. Each garment had sets
  of veils, collars, ruffs and chemisettes in fine hand-made lace, together
  with the needful crimping pins, brooches and tags; these were carefully
  listed and in the charge of competent women. In close alliance with them were
  the laundresses with their knowledge of ironing, pleating, clear starching
  and perfuming linen, silk, muslin and gauze.</p>

  <p>French cooks and scullions attended to the royal table and brought with
  them to Scotland recipes for many elaborate dishes and sweetmeats, among them
  a famous conserve of oranges, known as marmalade; in fact, no article of use
  or luxury that could contribute to the comfort and enjoyment of life was
  omitted from Mary's baggage. The lords and ladies who accompanied her were
  also richly fitted out with appointments far finer than those ever seen in
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>These displays came naturally to Mary and her train. She had never seen
  anything but the superb luxury of a refined and decadent Court, where the
  resources of a nation at the disposal of the perfect taste of Diane de
  Poitiers had been lavished on extravagance that had produced the flower of
  the French renaissance, translated from Italy. Mary's own taste was sure, but
  she indulged in no novelties. Her appearance was that of any Court lady
  carefully following fashions that had changed little for the past century.
  What made her notable among her train was the ease and grace with which she
  wore her heavy clothes, for she had now left her mourning and was arrayed
  with royal splendour. The witty animation of her speech and the zest with
  which she threw herself into all the amusements her Court provided were much
  admired. Her character was scarcely revealed. She had, because of affection
  and conviction, been a willing accomplice in the ambitions of the Guises. She
  had shown herself ambitious, jealous of her rank and firmly attached to the
  Church of Rome. She was frivolous yet chaste; her accomplishments were slight
  but she had the art of making the most of them; save in her outburst to
  Throckmorton on the refusal of the passport she had shown herself discreet.
  The evasions, the cunning she had learned from the Guises, passed for a
  precocious knowledge of diplomacy. She had lived in an atmosphere of
  continual adulation, been likened to a goddess, her beauty, her gifts
  extolled to hyperbole, her wishes, her whims, her inclinations had all been
  studied and gratified. During her childhood she had been surrounded by love;
  the suddenly revealed hostility of Catherine de Medici and Elizabeth's
  refusal of the passport had been the first rebuffs she had received and she
  had responded to them with, first, the petulance of a pampered child,
  'wishing she were dead', and then by a prudence strictly enjoined on her by
  the Guises.</p>

  <p>In public Mary had always shown composure, gaiety and, when the need was,
  courage. She had picked herself up cheerfully after a fall from her horse in
  the hunting field; she had borne with dignity the shocks of the deaths of
  Henry II and Francis I, but she had been overcome by the death of her mother.
  In private her emotional displays were so violent as to suggest epilepsy; she
  suffered from convulsive fits and long spells of unconsciousness that often
  alarmed her attendants into thinking she was dead or could not live long.</p>

  <p>One reason for her wretched health was that, moving in a corrupt society
  where sensuous love was the only theme of poets, where Court scandals and
  gossip all turned round the same theme, where the King was ruled by his
  mistress, and her own aunt and 'governante' bore a child to the King, where
  her uncle, the Cardinal, had at least one illegitimate daughter, and her
  grandfather twelve natural children, Mary herself had had no experience of
  either romantic or sensual love. Her marriage was null; she had felt nothing
  but compassion for her sickly boy husband who never lived to manhood. She had
  to listen to highflown compliments from numberless 'adorers' and her regal
  place did not permit her to reply by more than a gracious word. The
  frustrating of her natural instincts had helped to produce the bouts of
  tears, the swoons, the trances, the hysterical outbursts accentuated by
  constant physical illnesses.</p>

  <p>She was kind to the extent that she liked all about her to be cheerful,
  she was generous in her gifts, her praise, to those who served her. She
  detested 'meanness'; everything had to be lavish. She was impatient of
  control; at the age of twelve years she had commanded her own household with
  easy assurance. For the rest, she did not trouble herself with what went on
  beyond her ken. Her admiration and love for the Cardinal was not shaken by
  the atrocities of Amboise that took place practically in her presence. When
  the two moderate men of her own faith pleaded for religious toleration before
  her at the Assembly of Fontainebleau she did not support them. She was not
  moved by pity for the persecuted people whose cause Coligny put forward. As
  she told Throckmorton afterwards, she remained 'convinced' by the bigotry of
  the Cardinal loathed in France for his fanatic cruelty.</p>

  <p>But some had found her tender hearted because she did not put herself
  forward to watch the tortures of heretics and because she had been heard to
  express concern at the condition of the overdriven galley slaves. How cruel,
  callous and heartless she might be no one knew. Her youth, her pretty ways,
  her royal dignity concealed possible faults; her melancholy alternating with
  her gaiety concealed her intense egotism; her well-trained, well-bred dignity
  concealed her immaturity; she confounded Throckmorton by falling back on her
  'inexperience' without meaning what she said, for she considered herself
  perfectly able to rule a kingdom of which she knew nothing. In truth, she was
  inexperienced in everything save the intrigues of the Court of France and the
  duplicity taught her by the Guises.</p>

  <p>The traveller who has followed Mary's career during her stay in France
  will find himself full circle on her departure for Calais; it was to
  St.-Germain-en-Laye she came as a child, travelling from Roscoff, and it was
  from the same Abbey Palace that she departed, a widow, thirteen years
  later.</p>

  <p>The journey from Roscoff to Nantes and then by water to Paris is very
  agreeable. St.-Germain-en-Laye makes a pleasant place from which to visit
  Paris. Here is still the Louvre (since so greatly altered) that was new when
  Mary was betrothed there and afterwards taken to the unfinished apartments
  upon the horrible accident to Henry II that made her Queen of France. The
  Tournelles has gone, but Notre Dame remains, with very different
  surroundings. Pleasure boats are still on the Seine and the capital never
  lacks pageantry.</p>

  <p>The royal châteaux round Paris, which Mary visited for the 'fresh air'
  rather desperately ordered by her physicians, for the most part remain. The
  first for fame and splendour is Fontainebleau, the scene of many dramatic
  incidents in Mary's girlhood. Further field, but not far by any mode of
  travel, are the Valois châteaux; Villiers-Cotterets is, in particular,
  associated with Mary. A journey to Lorraine brings us to Joinville, which saw
  her most peaceful hours in the care of her grandmother, the woman who loved
  her better than any other ever did. At Nancy there are memories of more
  festivals at which the young Queen shone. At Rheims the coronation, clouded
  by mourning, can be invoked. At Orleans, the gloomy threats of insurrection,
  as the Court came to overawe the suspected rebellion of the Huguenots. The
  Loire châteaux and Blois are in themselves some of the most highly prized
  glories of France. Mary amused herself at Chenonceaux, Diane de Poitiers'
  château built over the Loire; at Amboise she lived amid the excitement and
  horror of 'the tumult'; in the gloomy massiveness of Chambord she spent
  listless days of illness and over the lovely fields and through the graceful
  forests that spread either side of the Loire she hunted, day after day, week
  after week, following the Court routine, sometimes resting at villages or
  country houses that have long since disappeared, sometimes avoided even by
  the woodcutters because of the rumour of her husband's leprosy, always on
  guard for possible ambuscades.</p>

  <p>Other places that Mary briefly visited, such as Manly, Meudon, Bordeaux,
  Abbeville, may be included in this romantic pilgrimage, but if the principal
  cities and castles as given here be studied an excellent idea of Mary's
  sojourn in France will be obtained, nor will it be difficult to forget the
  centuries between our time and hers, and to see her with her numerous and
  rich retinue, riding her white horse, or in her luxurious litter, passing
  along the rough roads of France, a Queen with no power, daughter of a Scot
  with a French education, a child with a brief childhood, a girl widowed at
  nineteen years after a marriage that was a form only, an alien in France for
  whom there was no welcome waiting in her own country, a sovereign bred a
  bigoted Roman Catholic who had to rule a country that had accepted the
  Reformation, a woman whose second marriage must be for policy to secure
  another crown; and, after all, only a tall girl, now sad, now gay, riding a
  white horse from one castle to another, envied, praised, spied upon, feared,
  the focus of intrigues, of jealousies, of desires, by name a Stewart, by
  nature a Guise.</p>

  <p>Mary 'stole' past the English coasts in a heavy fog that her astrologers
  instantly decided had been sent by supernatural powers for her protection.
  Under this cover she arrived at Leith, where the familiar 'haar' lay over
  Edinburgh and her port. John Knox, waiting with impatient bitterness for the
  Queen he intended to ruin, found another interpretation of this thick mist;
  it was too usual to provoke comment, but the Reformer, also credited with
  wizardry, declared that the rain and the darkness had been sent as a warning
  of the misfortunes that Mary would bring on Scotland.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-3"
     id="ch-3"></a><i>Part III.</i><br>
  SCOTLAND 1561-1568</h2>

  <p class="first">Neither Queen Mary nor her French entourage arrived in
  Scotland with any friendly feeling towards the Scots. France had been
  defeated in her struggles with England in Scotland; the Roman Catholics had
  been defeated by the Reformers; the Guise policy advised caution, but not
  submission. Mary had ceased to quarter the arms of England, but she still
  hoped to succeed to the English crown. She had promised religious toleration
  but she still hoped to re-establish the ancient Faith in her ancient realm;
  nor did these tasks seem especially arduous to her because she relied on her
  own gifts and charms, her power of intriguing, the support of the Guises; and
  because she knew so little of the difficulties that lay before her and
  because she had never faced the temper of the Scots Reformers.</p>

  <p>On one point she had no intention of giving way. Her manner of life was to
  continue exactly as it had always been as far as the amenities of Scotland
  allowed. She had her own dowry, her own friends and servants, her own private
  splendour; she was, and always would be, apart from the Scots.</p>

  <p>On their side the Scots were divided. The Lords, as upholders of the
  Reformation, regarded the Queen's arrival with suspicion; the Calvinist
  preachers, with John Knox at their head, regarded her with loathing; she
  represented all they detested. On the other hand, the Roman Catholic minority
  saw in her a bright hope for the future, while the common people, as usual,
  felt the relief of the ignored, the helpless and the downtrodden at a change
  of scene in the Government. Mary's arrival meant to them a chance of peace,
  of better conditions, of possible gain and prosperity. In all classes there
  was a revived tenderness for the once brilliant glories of the House of
  Stewart now displayed in the person of a young and charming woman. But, to
  counterbalance this popular goodwill, there were active in Scotland a number
  of self-seeking adventurers who thought of nothing but how they might serve
  their own advantage by stirring up trouble both for Mary and her
  subjects.</p>

  <p>After stepping ashore in Leith, Mary reposed herself in the house of one
  Andrew Lambis, and then proceeded to Holyrood Palace with her train. She had
  surprised the citizens of Edinburgh in the midst of their preparations for
  her reception but cannons were hastily fired. Crowds pressed about her
  cavalcade, shouting and cheering and, at night, a large band of indifferent
  musicians with violins and rebecks played beneath the windows of her Palace.
  Mary graciously praised the serenade that consisted of psalm singing;
  Brantôme found the concert wretched and woefully out of tune; this
  cat-calling of sacred music by Protestants had a hint of charivari. If the
  French found an insult to themselves and to Mary in this grotesque howling
  and scraping they were not, possibly, wrong; they also considered the
  welcoming Scots ill-clad, plain and boisterous. By the second of September
  the elaborate pageantry was ready, and the Queen of Scots for the first time
  rode in state from Holyrood to the Castle, where she held a stately banquet,
  then returned down Castle Hill to the Tolbooth, her progress being
  interrupted by pageantry, set pieces and groups of masks that compared fairly
  with the displays of this kind to which she was accustomed in France.</p>

  <p>But the offering of the keys of the city given at the Tolbooth was
  accompanied by a Protestant Bible and Psalm Book; hymn singing of the kind
  that had vexed Brantôme mingled with the sound of the artillery from the
  Castle and, at last, when she had reached Holyrood again, a group of children
  'made some speech about the putting away of the mass'.</p>

  <p>Edinburgh was the scene of the most important episodes of Mary's life and
  remains the city in which there are more relics of her period than any other
  place where she lived can show; as the famous views by Shepherd engraved in
  1830 reveal, Edinburgh was mostly unchanged from the city Mary knew until
  well into the eighteenth century. The buildings of the fine new town, the
  coming of the railway, the spreading of the suburbs then altered the city
  considerably, the character being, also, much changed, by the erection of
  classic buildings and monuments. But it is still possible to ignore all these
  and, by concentrating on the royal mile, Holyrood and the Castle, to revive
  memories of Mary's day and to recover the mediaeval city she knew.</p>

  <p>Leith had no pleasant associations for Mary. It was from there that her
  mother, as Regent, with the French Army, had issued her angry proclamations
  while John Knox's followers were burning the churches and convents of
  Edinburgh, and at the Tolbooth Knox himself was preaching furiously to the
  Lords of the Congregation. When Mary arrived John Knox was still preaching,
  triumphantly installed in St. Giles, formerly the Roman Catholic so-called
  cathedral and now the headquarters of the Reformers. This splendid church,
  now so mutilated, with the Tolbooth, then the Parliament House, was the
  centre of the life of the city, and the beautiful crown spire rose then as
  now, over the jutting, towering 'lands' of old Edinburgh. The situation of
  the capital was determined by the fortress Castle on the rock; beneath this
  is a valley through which ran a stream broadening into a lake, the Nor'Loch
  adorned with swans. On the banks was a chapel built by a former Stewart
  Queen. The Castle rose steeply above. It was taken by the English, retaken by
  the Scots, demolished and rebuilt many times.</p>

  <p>Edinburgh was once a Border town, when Lothian belonged to England, and
  ceded to Scotland only after the victory of Carham (1018). Since 1436 it had
  been the capital of Scotland, though at least four other towns, Stirling, so
  similar in situation, Aberdeen, Perth and Inverness were richer and more
  important. At the foot of the rock and the citadel the town was crowded into
  terraces, rising along the base of the rock that represented the whole of
  Edinburgh until 1770.</p>

  <p>In Mary's day beyond the valley and the Nor'Loch was open ground avoided
  because of the dangers of the time. The citizens pressed together under the
  shelter of the Castle and as they could not expand outwards they built
  upwards adding storey on storey to their crooked houses, thus erecting the
  curious 'wynds', the tall fantastic-looking houses being packed together over
  narrow alleys or flights of steps. These were broken by market square,
  churches, palaces and religious establishments. Many nobles lived in the
  Castle itself. On leaving it for the city (the old town that was walled after
  Flodden) they would descend by way of the Lawnmarket, High Street and
  Canongate to the Abbey Palace of Holyrood, set in a deer park, the old
  hunting ground of the early kings, with another curious rock, Arthur's seat,
  overlooking two sheets of water.</p>

  <p>A number of the houses and closes, flats or wynds in the old town are, if
  not of the actual date of Mary's reign, built shortly after that period, or
  in that style. Many have fallen into decay, but several have been restored;
  the finest single specimen is that in which John Knox is supposed to have
  lodged. St. Giles, only by courtesy 'a cathedral', was a collegiate church;
  it stands on the site of the ancient edifice burnt by the English in 1385.
  Shops and booths were once built against the exterior walls. The Reformers
  had defaced the interior but Mary saw a noble building. More of the old
  'lands' led to the Netherbow Gate, at the junction of the High Street and the
  Canongate. The once handsome houses in this district are of considerable
  interest but are later than the sixteenth century. Mary saw red-tiled houses
  with jutting gables, outside staircases and balconies. From the Canongate
  (residence of the Canons of the abbey) 'the Palace of Holyrood house' can be
  seen in flat parkland, backed by Salisbury crags.</p>

  <p>This was, like so many other royal residences, a religious foundation with
  a palace attached. The abbey belonged to the Canons of St. Augustine, who
  there treasured a piece of the Holy Rood or Cross. The establishment was
  founded by King David, son of Queen Margaret, who left him the relic, and the
  monks had jurisdiction as far as the Netherbow. A flat facade, or screen,
  French-Italian in style, connects two towers. This was largely the original
  design. One of the towers and the ruins of the abbey chapel are the oldest
  parts of Holyrood. The miniature Palace was built on part of the abbey
  grounds by Mary's father. Only her rooms remain of this residence. When she
  first came there in 1561 the building had been restored from the burning of
  the English nearly twenty years before. These rooms, with those beneath them,
  are undoubtedly of her time, but description of them belongs to a later
  episode in her story. All that is left of the monastic buildings is the Royal
  Chapel, a delicate and impressive ruin. The Kings of Scotland stayed in the
  abbey before the building of the Palace by James IV under French influence,
  and here he and his son attended the gorgeous rituals of the Church of Rome.
  Two Stewart Kings, James II and James III, were married here and here were
  buried David II, James II and Mary's father, James V.</p>

  <p>St. Margaret's well and St. Margaret's loch perpetuate the memory of Queen
  Margaret who gave the holy relic to the Abbey. A chapel (now in ruins) is
  dedicated to St. Anthony. On the east is Dunsappie loch, on the south
  Duddingston loch, bordered by flags and the resorts of swans. Beyond in the
  sixteenth century was open country, broken here and there by castles, country
  houses, churches and convents, these last in ruins from the zeal of the
  preachers (as the Reformed clergy were then named) that had been served as
  St. Giles was served, stripped of ornament, burnt and 'clanged down'. St.
  Giles had been left for the service of the Reformers, but the other churches
  had been abandoned to the bat, the owl and the weed.</p>

  <p>Holyrood had a pleasant history. The rude hunting box of the early kings
  had been, with increasing culture, enlarged to this gracious place for
  prayers and meditation; for a pause in the warlike days and disturbed nights
  of the harassed rulers of Scotland. Very different was the story of Holyrood,
  where Kings of Scotland lay buried, from that of the Castle, also a royal
  residence, scene of many a fearful crime, desperate escape, dastardly
  treachery or pitiful death. But never at any time, even when occupied by a
  busy crowd, could Holyrood have been cheerful. Even in sunshine the park, the
  rocks, the lochs give no impression of gaiety, and when half concealed by sea
  mist, or under lowering clouds of rain or snow, they are gloomy indeed.</p>

  <p>An intense fog&mdash;a 'haar' such as citizens of Edinburgh had never seen
  before&mdash;and the hoarse serenade from six hundred uncouth heretics
  beneath her windows on the first night of her arrival was depressing to Mary.
  The contrast with the exquisite galleries of Amboise and Chenonceaux, the
  sumptuous chambers of Fontainebleau, the lovely open country of the Loire,
  the pleasure gardens of Joinville and Nancy, the comfort of St.
  Germain-en-Laye, also a palace and an abbey, was sharp.</p>

  <p>Nineteen years of age, and still suffering from her last attack of tertian
  ague and the long sea voyage, she saw her new capital with dismay. Her
  childish memories of Scotland were mainly those of her mother's care and
  lovely presence. This city of dark rocks, narrow streets, and noisy
  independent people who, though loyal and enthusiastic, had already thrust
  their religion on her, was a Scotland she did not know, and nostalgia for
  France, for her youth already gone, deepened her melancholy fit. She
  resolved, however, to challenge her destiny, and gave orders to prepare the
  chapel in Holyrood for the celebrating of the mass on the first Sunday after
  her arrival in Edinburgh. This was not the abbey church&mdash;then used by
  the parish of the Canongate&mdash;but the small private chapel attached to
  the royal apartments in Holyrood.</p>

  <p>Mary knew what she was about in thus directly affronting the newly
  established Kirk of Scotland. She had given the Bible presented to her during
  her progress to a 'Papist' and she had taken the meaning of the pageant that
  showed the burning of 'idolators'. Only a last-minute discretion and the
  protests of Huntly had prevented these puppet victims from wearing the
  canonicals of Roman Catholic priests. Mary knew, too, that she was being
  watched by the Lords of the Congregation, Protectors of the preachers and the
  Kirk. These were about her, ostensibly to do her honour but also to be on the
  spot to judge her behaviour and that of her Guise uncles, who were most
  unwelcome in Edinburgh. Argyll, her brother-in-law, was there, with the Lord
  James, newly come from England, Lord Eskine, and the Northern Chieftain,
  Huntly, the Roman Catholic whose suggestion of a rising in the North she had
  refused. There, too, were Athol, Crawford and the Earl Marischal, with many
  other nobles.</p>

  <p>These lords 'looked grittumlie annoyit' when they saw the trappings going
  up in the little chapel and some gentlemen from 'the Kingdom of Fife' in the
  courtyard began to shout that they 'would not see the idoll [the mass] again
  in the realm'.</p>

  <p>The crowd, quickly gathering as the news spread, maltreated a man going in
  with candles. Some altar furnishings were 'trodden in the mire', but mass was
  celebrated, with the Lord James holding the chapel door, and the priest
  frightened into nervous trembling. Only Mary, the Guise uncles and her
  household were in the chapel, and by the afternoon the crowds in the abbey
  grounds were so threatening that any further celebrations had to be
  forgone.</p>

  <p>Mary acted promptly. Next day she issued a proclamation declaring
  religious toleration&mdash;not to be broken under pain of death. This applied
  only to the Roman Catholics as no one was likely to molest the dominant
  Protestants on account of their faith. Her own household was expressly
  mentioned; 'the pain of death' was threatened anyone interfering with the
  religion of the Queen or her followers, thus reviving the ancient sanctuary
  of Holyrood, for anyone residing there was immune from the law.</p>

  <p>Arran, with his father, then in Edinburgh, protested in vain. Mary coaxed
  the angry Lords and kept her mass. People all noticed her charm; to some it
  was 'an enchantment', to others 'cunning'. John Knox took the worst possible
  view of her and declared she was not to be trusted in anything, but was a
  mere agent of the Pope and the Guises sent to destroy the Kirk in Scotland A
  number of her subjects sent Mary a petition, ingenuously imploring her to
  join the Kirk or leave Scotland. The joy shown on her arrival was over with
  the pageantry.</p>

  <p>Mary was in no doubt of the importance of Knox. She sent for him, meaning
  to overcome him with her wit and guile. The position she took was simple. God
  had taught subjects to obey their princes; Knox in setting up a religion
  princes did not like had behaved as a traitor to his sovereign&mdash;'Rome
  was the true Kirk'. Knox was ready for the struggle; whatever she had been he
  would have loathed her, and what he saw of her and her train increased his
  wrath. He left her presence convinced (and for ever) that she had a crafty
  wit, a proud mind and a heart hardened against God's truth.</p>

  <p>Mary was vexed, but hardly knew how dangerous he was. The revived
  sanctuary of Holyrood drew into the precincts many of the doubtful characters
  of Edinburgh, who knew themselves protected by the immunity given to the
  Queen's household. Knox marked this and held forth against the harlots,
  adulterers, pimps and murderers who got 'shelter under the Queen's wing',
  adding forcibly that 'now the Devil began to see daylight again, who formerly
  had not dared to venture on the common streets'.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Mary, hitherto so sheltered and flattered, had
  come upon such stern opposition. Knox had not spoken to her with any
  particular harshness, but he had spoken boldly and it was the first time Mary
  had been addressed in any language save that of Courts, but her training
  enabled her to conceal her deep offence. She believed she had beguiled the
  Lords, who became more moderate; she won over the Lord James to protect her
  and her priests, but in all she did the three Guise uncles secretly advised
  her. She took no heed of the intense resentment of the Scots, who grumbled
  that, though the French had been thrown out of Scotland and Mary of Guise
  defeated, now the French and the Guises had crept back again and were close
  about the throne.</p>

  <p>Mary remained three weeks in Holyrood, then went to her birthplace for two
  days, and from there to Stirling, where she intended to hear mass in the
  chapel royal. But the Lords were no longer under her 'enchantment'. Argyll
  and the Lord James tried to stay a riot in the choir, but were themselves
  drawn into a <i>melée</i> of broken heads and bloody bones, while Mary went
  on to Perth.</p>

  <p>This noble city, just over forty miles from Edinburgh and near some of the
  finest scenery in Scotland, was for a long time the capital of Scotland and
  is near Scone, the place where the ancient Kings of Scotland were crowned. No
  place that the traveller may see when following Mary is more beautiful than
  Perth on the River Tay. It had already withstood eight sieges when Mary
  visited it and was rightly known as 'the fair city'. The citizens presented
  the Queen with a golden heart full of gold pieces, but she was angered and
  distressed by some of the pageantry that glanced maliciously at idolatry and
  she became so faint that the progress had to be stopped while she was borne
  into a neighbouring house. There she fell into one of those fits or
  convulsions to which she had always been subject; they were termed by some
  'passions' caused by grief, and were indeed hysterical fits relieving
  anxiety, frustration and the furies of injured pride.</p>

  <p>She hastened on to Dundee but here, too, her reception went awry.
  Complaining of the stenches of the city, she fled to St. Andrews, seat of the
  old Scottish Archbishopric, where Cardinal Beaton had been slain. Here there
  were more religious riots and Mary, angry, disheartened and sick, went as far
  north as Inverness. As she rode she saw on every hand ruined churches,
  convents, monasteries and chapels. The experience was as new as it was
  terrible. The contrast with France was bitter to Mary and the
  Guises&mdash;they recalled the slaughter at Amboise where the victims had
  gone to torture and death singing psalms. There was psalm singing in
  Scotland, but it was triumphant. Despite herself, Mary remembered the plea of
  Coligny at Fontainebleau, the moderate counsels of Vienne and Valence, but
  this did not alter the intentions of her Guise relations. The mass was to be
  forced on the Scots.</p>

  <p>On her return to Holyrood there was no Scot on whom Mary felt she could
  rely. Even the most liberal minded, like the Lord James or Sir William
  Maitland, were sternly in favour of the Kirk and the preachers. Huntly and
  the other Roman Catholics she still regarded with suspicion. Her
  brother-in-law, Argyll, was a hot follower of John Knox.</p>

  <p>Knox was the greatest power in the land. Reputed a wizard, a sorcerer, a
  saint, a prophet, he was undoubtedly a man of great force of character,
  impressive personality and intense belief in himself. He had all the driving
  power that an obsession gives and possessed a mighty voice, commanding a
  stream of eloquence and invective, largely taken from the Old Testament,
  unequalled even in that time of furious polemics. All in all, this crude,
  unlettered man of no remarkable birth or education, self-appointed founder of
  the Kirk of Scotland, was, as the Cardinal of Lorraine had long since
  foreseen, the greatest enemy Mary had in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In several ways he suited the national character. His vitality, his sense
  of drama, his boldness, his scorn of kings' and princes, his virtues of the
  common man, his professed austerity and large manner of dealing with God,
  appealed to the Scots. But there was a dark side to the mighty preacher that
  made him many enemies. Like all who consider themselves the mouthpiece of
  God, his haughty egotism was excessive, his manners as harsh as his aspect,
  his outlook narrow, his heart cold and cruel. He dwelt in a twilight of gloom
  and foreboding; he was truly a prophet of evil; he knew neither toleration
  nor mercy, his sense of sin so acute that he could smell it everywhere. On
  his visit to Geneva he had quarrelled with John Calvin, his mental superior,
  but he held largely to the Frenchman's sombre doctrines. He was very ready to
  think everyone damned; he proclaimed incessantly and loudly that all Roman
  Catholics were of the Devil. Effectively using his trenchant Scots speech, he
  declared that when Mary heard mass on her progress 'she defiled everywhere
  she went with her idolatry'. His private life was cumbered with hysterical
  women whom he permitted to follow him about, pestering him as to the
  salvation of their souls. His reputation as a wizard was dark; he was a
  Nostradamus in reverse, a soothsayer of the people instead of a soothsayer of
  the Court. In truth the magnetism of his personality might easily seem
  magical, and he had a deep influence over his congregations. Sir Thomas
  Randolph, the English envoy, wrote home that the voice of John Knox was worth
  more than 'five hundred trumpets' to rouse the people.</p>

  <p>There was one side of the Scots character of which John Knox knew nothing.
  The essential poetry and spiritual emotions that expressed themselves in the
  most moving ballads, prose tales, folklore and mythology in the world were
  mere rubbish to the grim prophet. He and his followers even took some of the
  most poignant of the native songs and their haunting melodies and used them
  for religious verse and squibs. He was quite as unscrupulous as the Guises in
  paper warfare and never hesitated to slander and libel his enemies. This
  formidable man had resolved to ruin Mary long before she came to Scotland;
  even in the first weeks of her residence in her kingdom she had played into
  his hands, and he had the majority of the Scots behind him, a fact which lent
  a fine bravado to his insulting challenges. His courage was not that of the
  martyrs; a personal spite was added to his hatred of the Queen and her French
  relatives because of his sufferings in the French galleys. In 1561 John Knox
  was aged fifty-seven years. Mary was nineteen years of age but they were not,
  as far as personal qualities went, ill matched. She had been trained to deal
  with men like the Reformer since she had been told by the Cardinal of
  Lorraine how Knox's party were foremost in rebellion against the mother she
  loved so well.</p>

  <p>When Mary returned to Holyrood at the beginning of the northern autumn the
  small royal apartments had been arranged with all the taste and luxury her
  French attendants could muster. These rooms can still be seen; they are on
  the north side of the Palace and must always have been gloomy. There is the
  private dining room, an audience chamber where Knox was received, a bedroom
  and a dressing room, while a small spiral staircase leads to the apartments
  below, known as the Hamilton or Darnley rooms. In Queen Mary's day there was
  a long gallery or set of rooms <i>enfilade</i> running from her suite to the
  entrance to the royal chapel or chapel of the Augustines with the Stewart
  vaults at the far end. There was also a council chamber, now the picture
  gallery, and on the opposite side of the courtyard the State apartments where
  Mary held her banquets, balls and other entertainments. Save, however, on
  these public occasions she resided in the modest apartments that have
  acquired as melancholy an air as any spot in Scot-. land.</p>

  <p>Wonder and compassion have often been expressed at the size of the rooms
  that Mary occupied, not only in Holyrood but in several other palaces and
  castles. It seems to be supposed that these were given her in neglect or
  insult; this is obviously untrue since she was able, while Queen, to choose
  her own apartments. The chambers and the exits were designed for protection
  against surprise. A small room or closet was easily guarded by one person at
  the door; a dark back staircase, taking only one person at a time on each
  step, was easily defended and also admirable for escape and intrigue; a low
  door meant that anyone entering the room would have to bend, and would be at
  a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>The entire Palace was very richly furnished. To the appointments left by
  her predecessors Mary added all the costly and beautiful objects, tapestries,
  carpets, furniture, pictures, mirrors, she had brought with her from France,
  and these were not only far more luxurious than anything the untravelled
  Scots had seen before, but of a different style. There was little of native
  art or craft save the gifts, pride of the Scots gold- and silver-smiths, Mary
  had received on her formal welcome to her realm. Her wardrobe and her jewels
  astonished those Scots who had not been to France; they were as impressive as
  'the stately beauty' that all who saw her remarked upon. Mary's official
  attire changed little during the whole of her life and she was never seen in
  any but <i>robe de parade</i> save by her intimates. This very heavy, stiff
  and unbecoming dress, so closely associated with her name, consisted of
  foundation garments that never varied. These were a tight bodice, whaleboned
  or stiffened with steel and much compressed so that the figure to the waist
  resembled a kite, then a wide inner skirt supported on steel hoops and worn
  over a number of petticoats, and over that an outer skirt, open in front. The
  sleeves were full and completely covered the arms; the bodice was cut low,
  the breast being either bare or concealed by a light gauze. The hair was
  hidden save for a cluster of curls either side the forehead and a
  close-peaked cap clasped the head; the front hair, brushed back, made the
  forehead appear very high. Ruffs of different styles, usually held out like a
  plate on which the head seemed to rest, encircled the neck and were often
  held out by steel rods in the pleats; cuffs to match were often worn. The
  dress was high at the back and from it was hung a long mantle, usually
  forming a train on the gown. From the head-dress depended a long gauze veil,
  or, most fantastic detail of all this fantastic attire and very popular with
  Mary, a gauze mantle with two large wired wings standing up high above the
  head.</p>

  <p>No dress could have been more uncomfortable, more sumptuous, more
  calculated for display. Only an idle woman could wear it, only a rich woman
  afford it. Unhealthful, difficult to manipulate and really ugly, this bizarre
  attire lent itself to an endless variety of adornment; it could be made in a
  number of costly materials, in many colours and it could be ornamented from
  head to foot with gems, embroidery, and all the quirks of fashion. One outfit
  could easily carry a treasury of jewels. Mary's dress when she went abroad
  differed little from the rich indoor attire. There were no hoops, the bodice
  was closed to the neck and the cap was changed for a steeple crown hat with
  feathers.</p>

  <p>All the details of her toilet were very extravagant and beautiful. She
  possessed hundreds of costly trifles and often wore them. Fans, mirrors,
  <i>etui</i>, perfume bottles, scented gloves and little toys, watches and
  pomanders. She had Italian silk stockings and her shoes were square-toed and
  of soft leather made after the pattern introduced by her mother and known as
  Guise shoes.</p>

  <p>This highly artificial dress required an artificial beauty; there was
  little that was natural in Mary's charms, even at this age. Her cosmetics
  were costly and skilfully applied; the pearl-like complexion was whitened and
  carefully tinted in lips and cheeks; the brown hair either bleached and dyed
  gold, or hidden under various perukes so that she appeared now dark, now
  chestnut, now ash blonde. Her regular features, the delicate oval of her
  face, her graceful bearing alone owed nothing to art. The long, sleepy brown
  eyes were delicately darkened on the lids, her eyebrows were shaven into fine
  lines. Fastidious in all her senses, she used a quantity of perfumes, herbal
  waters and toilet essences in an attempt to disguise the foul odours that
  constantly surrounded her exquisite elegance. Such a woman as this those
  Scots who had not left Scotland had never seen. At first she seemed
  entrancing, but on consideration she might well seem one of her own decked
  'idols' or John Knox's Jezebel&mdash;who 'painted her face and tired her
  head'. The Queen's ladies, foremost among whom were the four Marys, dressed
  after the pattern of their mistress. Her Guise uncles set the Paris fashions
  in fantastic extravagant male clothes; the only Scots who could vie with them
  were those familiar with France, like Bothwell and Arran, who, for no purpose
  save their own advancement, were now in Mary's train.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Queen had returned to Holyrood she met with new vexations.
  The authorities of Edinburgh had countered her proclamation about the
  sanctuary at Holyrood by re-issuing one they had made in her name six months
  before. This banished all rogues, vagabonds, criminals, 'filthy persons' and
  monks, priests, friars and nuns out of the town within twenty-five days. The
  punishment for disobedience would be carting, branding in the cheek and
  banishment. There was some colour given to this by the fact that so many of
  the riff-raff of the town had taken shelter in the Palace.</p>

  <p>Mary was very 'commovit' and struck back immediately at the bold
  burgesses. They were deprived of their offices and on All Hallows Eve she
  held her first High Mass. It might as well have been the black mass for the
  fury it roused in Edinburgh, a fury inflamed and guided by John Knox
  preaching in St. Giles. He considered that the Lords had been far too lenient
  with Mary and they were convened to a meeting at the Clerk Register's House
  to debate this matter of the mass. Lords and Preachers agreed that it was
  rank idolatry, but they could not agree as to their right to oblige Mary to
  give up her religion.</p>

  <p>The feeling of the people, more virile, bold and headstrong than any Mary
  had ever known, found vent in riots and pasquinades, coarse, forcible and
  witty, reflecting pungently on those 'mumbling the mes'.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Mary's name had been remotely tarnished; it
  was now openly associated with the pack of rascals, loose women and
  'nuisances' who were harbouring in Holyrood through no fault of hers. Mary
  would have been well advised to have got rid of them; but they professed to
  be Roman Catholics and they claimed the ancient sanctuary, so she felt
  herself obliged to protect them to her own great harm and the advantage of
  her enemies, who cried up the foul company she kept. So the 'unblemished'
  reputation of Mary that had so impressed Sir Nicolas Throckmorton and been so
  cherished in France began to be blown upon when she had been but a few weeks
  in Scotland. It was John Knox who seized this weapon with the greatest zeal.
  He was willing to use any pretext to ruin the Queen, who, as the prophet
  noted, not only was giving herself over to gaiety among the Papist French,
  but was encouraging such known dissolute scoundrels as Earl Bothwell. The
  ferocious intolerance of John Knox wrought on the superstition of the people
  to such an extent that they were in a mood to believe that the black fog in
  which she had arrived at Leith did indeed presage evil for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Lord James persisted in the part of the liberal man. He admitted that
  public mass was an abomination but advised that the Queen should be allowed
  it in her private chapel. But John Knox reminded him sternly that before
  Mary's coming a 'pestilent Papist' or 'Mass Monger' dare not show his face in
  the Lowlands of Scotland, whereas now there was an insolent swarm of them.
  Nor could the implacable preacher agree that there was a chance that Mary
  might be converted to the Kirk. He declared that she had learned the lessons
  of the Cardinal of Lorraine so well that they would remain with her to her
  death. The Lord James privately thought so too, but he kept his counsel and
  went to Jedburgh, where he assisted at the Courts of Justice then trying
  rebellious Borderers who were duly hanged. Tumults increased in Edinburgh.
  The lively and impatient apprentices brawled in the streets; they were soon
  out of hand, and fighting on the causeways and up and down the steep, crowded
  passages round the Castle rock took place on the slightest provocation; but
  there was little serious damage done to the Roman Catholics. Mary's
  influence, stretched to the utmost, saved her co-religionists from violence,
  much to the disgust of John Knox who continued to thunder at the Lords for
  their laxity towards the Queen.</p>

  <p>Mary, at this time, benefited from the support and advice of the most
  liberal-minded man who was ever to influence her; this was the learned,
  intelligent and attractive Sir William Maitland of Lethington, termed in rude
  Scot wit&mdash;'Mr. Michael Wylie' for Machiavelli in reference to his
  reputation for skilful diplomacy. This serene, austere and cultured gentleman
  was then thirty-five years of age and had changed his politics and his
  religion since he had been secretary to Mary of Guise. He understood Mary;
  without being deceived by her charming ways he liked them. Mary found him
  fascinating; they were similar in a superficial manner, particularly in
  worldly sophistication. Maitland turned Mary to some seriousness, such as
  reading Latin with the famous scholar George Buchanan, listening to political
  discussions and studying the conditions of the times. Maitland, like the Lord
  James, his rival in Mary's counsels, who detested him, was a double-dealer
  and had 'looked through his fingers' at many dubious actions, but he was a
  statesman, not a politician, and as wise and honest a man as there was in
  Scotland. He treated Mary with respect and consideration but not with gross
  flattery. She responded by giving him all the confidence she could give to
  one who was not a Roman Catholic. He was always of importance to her, and as
  his second wife he married Mary Fleming, one of the four Marys, which union
  brought him into the Queen's most intimate circle.</p>

  <p>The persistent fight in Edinburgh&mdash;the citizens against 'that wicked
  rabble of Anti-Christ the Pope' urged on by John Knox's calumniations against
  the boldness of Satan and the 'levity and dulciness' of the Court&mdash;was
  increased by a brawl that involved one of the Queen's uncles. The young
  Marquis d'Elbceuf had already been rebuked by the Church Assembly for
  disorder in the streets. He did not mend his indiscreet behaviour, but,
  together with Bothwell, made a determined attempt to enter the house of one
  Cuthbert Ramsey by night. In the resultant struggle ten men were hardly able
  to hold the excited French Prince.</p>

  <p>This and similar episodes spread alarm through the city. There were
  rumours of attacks on Holyrood; the watch was doubled, extra guards set; the
  great nobles, Argyll, Huntly and the Lord James, in vain tried to keep order;
  the trains of chieftains mingled with the apprentices and the French from
  Holyrood in scuffles and fights on the causeways.</p>

  <p>So passed that winter, with considerable uneasiness and no progress
  towards any settlement. The most notable episode was the visit of the wild
  yet young Bothwell to John Knox. The Earl declared he was weary of his sinful
  life and wished to begin better things by reconciling himself with his enemy,
  Arran. The flattered preacher effected this, and brought the two young men
  together in his house and they departed in seeming amity. Mary was suspicious
  of this move. Bothwell had been brawling in front of a house in which he
  swore Arran kept a woman Bothwell had favoured. The Marquis d'Elbceuf had
  been his companion, and this had been to the Queen's 'miscontent'. Mary did
  not think that he would be a good influence on the weak and excitable Arran,
  who had been rejected both by herself and Elizabeth Tudor as a husband. She
  had the pair watched.</p>

  <p>Arran suddenly appeared at Holyrood in a frenzy, babbling a wild tale.
  Bothwell, he declared, whose pride of birth had been puffed up by his
  sister's recent marriage to the Lord John, half-brother of the Lord James,
  had suggested to him, Arran, that Maitland and the Lord James should be
  murdered and the Queen kidnapped and taken to the Hamilton's Castle at
  Dumbarton. This plot had been hatched in the new mansion of the Hamilton
  outside Edinburgh in a piece of ground named Kirk O'Field because of a ruined
  church that stood there. Arran and Bothwell were then&mdash;the Queen
  abducted and her guardians slain&mdash;to rule Scotland between them. Acting
  on the wise counsel of her advisers, her brother and Maitland, Mary 'put to
  ward' both Arran and Bothwell and seized Dumbarton Castle from the former's
  father, Châtelherault. Arran soon after this obscure episode gave signs of
  unmistakable mental disorder and was confined. There were no enquiries into
  the affair that was passed over as a prankish invention of the crazy Arran,
  and this though Bothwell had confessed to some manner of plot.</p>

  <p>Mary was at Falkland when Bothwell was brought before her to answer the
  charge made by Arran. She had gone there with hawk and hound to hunt on the
  plains and in the woods of Fife, the ancient preserves of the Kings of
  Scotland. She was taking her old remedy for her old complaint, the 'fresh
  air' advised by the French physicians for her hysterical melancholy and
  various maladies. Bothwell, adroit and charming, met Mary's fascination with
  his own. This time it was the beguiling Queen who was beguiled; affecting to
  believe the whole affair a fantasy she allowed the dangerous Bothwell to
  remain loosely guarded in Edinburgh Castle.</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas Randolph, the English envoy, was obliged to follow Mary to
  Falkirk. He complained of the roughness of the roads and the poverty of the
  country town's accommodation; it was, he declared, 'hardship for man and
  beast'. The Queen, however, lived luxuriously according to her whim.
  Sometimes she lay in her silks and down pillows for days together in an idle
  languor; sometimes she showed feverish activity, spending hours in the
  saddle. She was much easier when away from Edinburgh and the dark little
  Palace in the King's Park. The Lord James, Maitland and her three Guise
  uncles were agreed as to her main policy; this was to be conciliation of
  Elizabeth Tudor and the Protestants as a means to the throne of England and
  the re-establishment of Roman Catholicism in the British Isles. The deadly
  insult of the quartering of the English arms and the refusal (even now this
  question was pressed by Cecil) to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh were wisely
  forgotten by Mary and the Guises. She exchanged compliments and costly
  presents with the English Queen and overlooked the vexation of the refused
  passport.</p>

  <p>Mary's hopes seemed well founded; she was considerably younger than
  Elizabeth, who had made and was making such an open scandal with Robert
  Dudley that a valuable marriage for her seemed unlikely; moreover, her health
  was precarious and Court spies affirmed that it was impossible for her to
  have children. Indeed, so good were Mary's prospects in England that for them
  she was prepared to give up a marriage with France or Spain that would ruin
  her chances in England. This was the advice of the Lord James, who assured
  Mary that she would never re-convert Scotland. All the Reformed Lords were
  firm on this point. Not only were some of them at least convinced Protestants
  but most of them were gorged with Church lands and by no means inclined to
  give them up. Maitland, the most far-sighted of them all, was working for an
  honourable object, the union of England and Scotland on equal terms; the
  Guise brothers saw the hopelessness of fighting Protestantism and John Knox,
  and joined Mary's Scottish counsellors in advising this long slow policy of
  patiently waiting for her rights to the English crown to be acknowledged.</p>

  <p>She was prepared to do everything to this end&mdash;save to sacrifice her
  Faith&mdash;and that was the one thing needful. The Lord James and Maitland,
  however, thought that even this considerable stumbling-block might be got
  over by caution and discretion, and a limited toleration be obtained for
  Mary's household. They both disliked John Knox, and they both saw the dangers
  of men like Bothwell and Arran, Huntly and his followers. Mary listened
  dutifully. It was easy for her to flatter Elizabeth and cajole Sir Thomas
  Randolph. The language of courtly compliment was her natural speech; nothing
  could have been more insincere than her protestations of friendship,
  admiration and affection for the rival Queen. She did not know Elizabeth and
  could not have liked the heretic who occupied the throne she thought she
  ought to hold. There was nothing in the reports of Elizabeth's character to
  evoke affection in anyone and there were the old unsettled grievances between
  her and Mary. Elizabeth returned the gifts and flatteries and pursued her own
  policies with the advice of her own counsellors, as wary and as wise as the
  Scots. Randolph was deceived in nothing; he continued to send home honest and
  shrewd reports on Mary and her Court.</p>

  <p>Falkland, where, during her first spring after her return to Scotland,
  Mary recovered some health and spirits, is one of the most enchanting places
  in Scotland, not so well known as some other towns and on that account not to
  be missed. Although Mary possessed a carriage (or waggon) and litters she
  usually rode, and Randolph complained of the rude ways from Edinburgh to
  Falkland. Now it is an easy and interesting journey and may be visited on the
  route from the capital to St. Andrews. Near by are places made famous by
  legend and ballad and by some later episodes in Mary's stay: Aberdour, once a
  castle belonging to Earl Morton; Doneybristle, scene of the murder of the
  'bonny Earl of Moray' (1592); Rossend, belonging to the gallant Kirkcaldy of
  Grange; Kinghorn, where Alexander III was killed by a fall from his horse
  (1286), and Wemyss Castle.</p>

  <p>Falkland (the former Kilgour) is supposed to derive the name from the
  royal falconry; it was from ancient times a hunting seat and the town is
  small and without pretence, partly industrialized but still retaining
  considerable fascination. From its highest point is a wide view over the
  pastoral scenery of the Home of Fife; the Palace overwhelms all other
  buildings by the unexpected splendour and romantic aspect both of the
  restored portion and the grey ruins.</p>

  <p>Falkland Palace was, as usual, built on the site of a castle&mdash;a
  stronghold of the Earls of Fife, dating back to the thirteenth century. It
  became a royal possession in the reign of Robert III and a horrible, but
  uncertain, legend relates that here his brother bearing the title of Albany,
  fatal to the Kings of Scotland, imprisoned and starved to death the King's
  son, the gay and popular Duke of Rothesay. A grim revenge was taken in
  Stirling Castle for this supposed crime, though Albany had been acquitted of
  guilt and Falkland became crown property. The immense deer forests attracted
  James I and James II to build a residence close to the Castle and James IV
  lived there with considerable pomp. Afterwards it was neglected, but James V
  had repaired and refurnished it for a residence for his bride, Mary of Guise,
  who had often stayed there. It was at Falkland that James V had heard of the
  rout at Solway and the birth of Mary, and there he had died.</p>

  <p>The royal apartments are in ruin but the gorgeous facade of the south side
  remains. A corridor and the chapel together with an odd priest's room have
  been restored to something of their former design. Fires, due not to the
  English but to domestic carelessness, have destroyed the rooms where once the
  Stewarts lived, but the melancholy charm of the broken masonry, set with wild
  flowers, is a fitting memorial to their vanished sorrows and glories.</p>

  <p>In pursuance of her policy Mary took two steps in direct contradiction to
  each other. To please the Protestants she issued a proclamation punishing
  with death anyone attending mass, reserving to herself the right to hold this
  ceremony in Holyrood private chapel only; and she received secretly the Papal
  Nuncio, who was smuggled in disguise into Mary's presence while Maitland kept
  guard at the door.</p>

  <p>Randolph, however, who had excellent spies, was soon reporting the episode
  to Elizabeth, who was fomenting trouble in France by underhand help to the
  Huguenots under Condé. Maitland tried to bring about a meeting between the
  two Queens in the hope that feminine tact might find some way of settling the
  vexed question of the English succession. Mary, confident of her own charms,
  much wished for this interview; she believed that she could enchant Elizabeth
  as she had enchanted so many others. But Elizabeth held off. Her implacable
  policy was that of 'yea' and 'nay'; she was exasperating everyone by her
  dallyings with Robert Dudley and her endless hesitations, self
  contradictions, delays and caprices, and her heartless skill was more than a
  match for Mary's charming duplicity. But extravagant flatteries continued to
  pass between the two women. Mary offered a gold-set diamond, with a copy of
  verses from her Latin reader, George Buchanan. Elizabeth returned a famous
  rock crystal, shaped like a heart. Randolph thought that Mary was a mere
  catspaw of the Guises who hoped to induce Elizabeth to withdraw her help from
  the Huguenots.</p>

  <p>The Lord James married Agnes Keith, daughter of the Earl of Marischal, and
  Mary created him Earl of Mar. The Queen was at Holyrood for the marriage
  festival and toasted Elizabeth in a golden goblet she afterwards gave to
  Randolph. On the rise to power of their enemy, Mar, Huntly and his clan, the
  Gordons, sullenly withdrew to the North; his third son, however, Sir John
  Gordon of Findlater, returned to the capital and brawled with his Highlanders
  in the rocky streets and steep causeways.</p>

  <p>The season (1562) was wretched, and the foul weather, the crops ruined by
  floods, the desperate uncertainty of public affairs, gave the wise men
  abundant material for the most dismal prophecies. A 'contagion' was over the
  earth and from this came a number of 'monstrous births' horrible enough to
  inspire the most exacting of wizards; some women gave birth to skeletons
  'entirely without flesh'; others came into the world with limbs missing or
  with 'heads belonging to other creatures'. Nor were domestic animals behind
  in producing similar deformities.</p>

  <p>Amid these 'sad presages' Mary continued to lead the life that to her was
  normal. She had her public banquets, her private suppers, her puppet shows,
  her cards and billiards, her readings with Buchanan, her perpetual change of
  costume for one gaiety or another. She played golf on the sands at Leith,
  watched jousts and ridings at the ring, and set off the nobles (as she
  thought) one against the other. Among these was the sinister, outlawed
  Douglas, who was of royal descent through Archibald, Earl of Angus, second
  husband to Margaret Tudor, by marriage Earl of Morton. When Mary swore him a
  member of her Privy Council he was of vast influence in the Reformed party,
  but a dissolute, rude, surly and wholly unattractive man whose sombre,
  puritanical attire, fox-coloured hair and pale face gave a fair indication of
  his false, gloomy and sour character. He was, however, an able politician,
  outwardly at Mary's service but leaning secretly to England: Constantly in
  his company was his kinsman and jackal, the adroit and unscrupulous Archibald
  Douglas. Of the same kidney was John Wood, secretary to Mar (the Lord James);
  and these two underlings made themselves the mouthpieces of the Protestant
  outcries against Mary's pastimes, frivolities and extravagances. They spied
  and eavesdropped and busily recounted gossip and scandal where it was eagerly
  received&mdash;by John Knox and his followers.</p>

  <p>Everything that Mary did was sharply criticized by these spies and those
  whom they 'crammed with intelligence'. Mary's zest for life was condemned as
  a sin. It was wrong for her to celebrate Twelfth Day; it was wrong for her to
  shoot at the butts, to listen to music or poetry, to bring needlework to the
  council chamber, to play chess, to dance, to have 'mirth upon the sands of
  Leith'.</p>

  <p>Mary gave some cause for these malicious strictures. She was now out of
  tutelage and lacked the prudent counsels of the Cardinal of Lorraine and the
  restraining influence of her pious grandmother. She showed herself headstrong
  and wilful and recklessly outraged public opinion, holding herself above
  reproof or even suspicion. She broke the Scots Sunday with her games and
  merry-making; she was very familiar with those she liked, and ardently
  encouraged the fantastic frivolity against which her well-wishers had often
  warned her. She took no interest whatever in the miseries of Scotland caused
  by the weather and the bad harvest. The splendour of the royal establishment
  and Mary's headlong pursuit of pleasure were in painful contrast to the
  sufferings of a poor and stricken country. Worst charge of all in Puritan
  eyes, she smiled too often and on too many, and the smile, in eyes and on
  lips, was sidelong and promised far too much. Among those she was said to
  lure with her fascinating grace was the Frenchman, Chastelard, the poet who
  was often her partner in the dance, and Huntly's son, Sir John Gordon, who
  was believed to have returned from the safety of the North to look on his
  Queen again.</p>

  <p>Mary knew of these rumours and despised them. So far she showed a gallant
  disdain for advice and reproof alike, but some of her actions would have been
  foolish in any time or place. The most imprudent of these was the wild frolic
  of dressing herself in male attire and venturing in the Edinburgh streets at
  night, with no more protection than the company of one of her women. The
  escapade, though she believed it was kept private, was instantly known, and
  the remote, almost heraldic figure of the stately Queen in her sumptuous gown
  and jewels was at once slightly tarnished. The dignified, chaste, almost
  austere Princess that Throckmorton had held up as an example to Elizabeth was
  not to be recognized in the slight cavalier who was only a tall girl in
  disguise, mischievously savouring the coarse sights, smells and sounds of the
  noisy High Street, Vennel, Lawnmarket and Cow Gate.</p>

  <p>The Edinburgh that Mary investigated with curious eyes peering through her
  mask was even more filthy than most Scots cities. Her continual moving from
  place to place was partly caused by the need of some cleaning of her houses,
  the emptying of cesspools, the fumigating of rooms, enclosed for months, the
  removal of accumulated garbage and refuse. Mary had noticed the stench at
  Perth, but 'the fair city' gave place to Edinburgh in this respect. Even the
  hardened noses and stomachs of the Scots remarked on the filth of the
  capital. Apart from the ordinary 'nuisances' of a crowded town, with
  close-packed houses, narrow alleys and no drainage, various trades were
  carried on in Edinburgh without the least regard to health or decency.
  Tanners, butchers, tailors, fishmongers, cobblers and sundry others
  contributed to the midden heaps and the con tents of the choked gutters. In
  the time of Mary's grandfather, Dunbar, the poet, had roundly rebuked the
  burgesses of Edinburgh for the disgraceful state of their town:</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>One cannot enter your gates<br>
  But there is stink&mdash;of haddocks and of skates&mdash;</i></p>

  <p>And worse, no doubt. John Knox made his way to St. Giles to preach the
  wrath of God through offal and decaying filth up to the very walls of the
  church. Sundry efforts had been made to effect some clearance in the filthy
  streets, but these availed nothing. Mary was justified in her dislike of a
  city not only disloyal but indescribably revolting and in her desire to
  escape whenever she could to the sands of Leith or to Falkland, or even to a
  Castle, such as Craigmillar, not far from Edinburgh but in purer air.</p>

  <p>In August (1562) Mary decided, reluctantly, to make a second and more
  extensive progress to the North. She had lingered four months for the
  long-deferred interview with Elizabeth and was now informed that she must
  wait a year before indulging in even a hope of seeing the English Queen.
  Huntly was in the North. His quarrel with Mar had come to a climax and he was
  supposed to be prepared to undertake on his own the Roman Catholic rebellion
  he had urged on Mary before she left France. On the other hand, there were
  those who suspected that Mar wanted to get rid of Huntly in order to secure
  his lands.</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas Randolph, who had to accompany Mary on this 'terrible journey',
  dreaded this expedition into what to him was a savage country&mdash;'poor and
  victuals so scarce' he lamented. He was not alone in considering the
  Highlands of Scotland uncivilized. One of Mary's many masquerades at the
  French Court had been that of a Highland savage; she had worn a tartan or
  Scots cloth woven in many camouflage heather tints, a green jacket and a blue
  bonnet and the whole costume, fanciful as it was, had been as outlandish to
  the French as the garb of the Moorish or Eastern maskers so popular at their
  pageants. Randolph was also afraid of 'garboils'; he thought that Mar had
  resolved on a punitive expedition against the turbulent North and that the
  Queen, resolved as she was on her compromise with Elizabeth, was obliged to
  accompany him and his train even against the Roman Catholic minority. Nor was
  the English envoy satisfied about his own work. Mary, despite tedious
  negotiations, would not ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh, Elizabeth would not
  see her unless she did, and all the fine-spun flatteries between the two
  women could not disguise from Randolph their inevitable rivalries resulting
  in unmistakable hatred, the deeper for being so carefully concealed behind
  fulsome compliments.</p>

  <p>Mary's route to the North is known. She went first to Stirling, where a
  Privy Council was held, then to Coupar Angus, Perth, Edzell, Glamis, and by
  the end of the month was at Aberdeen. Randolph noted the unripe, rotting
  corn, the dear food, 'the extreme cold and foul weather', and found the whole
  journey 'cumbersome, painful and marvellously long'.</p>

  <p>Aberdeen was then a small town. Part of it had been burnt in 1305, but it
  was the seat of the famous colleges, Kings and Marischals, founded by Mary's
  grandfather, James IV, and Bishop Elphinstone, and now joining the
  University, and of an ancient bishopric. The massive and venerable Cathedral
  dates from 1430 and is built on the site of a church, now lost, founded by
  St. Machar, a disciple of St. Columba, who had received divine commands to
  raise a church where the river formed a pastoral crook, here traced by a
  curve of the Dee. King's College was there when Mary came to break the power
  of the Gordons, and the tomb of Bishop Elphinstone in the chapel is unchanged
  save for the loss of the brass.</p>

  <p>It was at Aberdeen that the Earl and Countess of Huntly came to humble
  themselves before the Queen, begging a pardon for their son, Sir John, who
  had escaped from prison in Edinburgh, where he had been sentenced for
  brawling in the streets. Mary promised this if the young man would surrender
  himself, which he did, but finding himself in the ward of Mar's uncle, Lord
  Erskine, he escaped again. Mary thereupon refused to rest in Huntly's mansion
  though it was the finest in the neighbourhood and he had made elaborate
  preparations for her entertainment. She proceeded to Rothiemay, Elgin and
  Darnaway where she lodged at the Castle that was Mar's strong hold. There she
  held a council and completed the formalities for her half-brother's
  investiture with the title of Moray. This council also accused John Gordon of
  assaulting Ogilvy and twice escaping from justice. He was ordered to give up
  his Castle and houses of Findlater and Auchendeene.</p>

  <p>The weather continued cold, gloomy and wet. The High lands possessed no
  roads; the Queen and her train had to proceed along tracks, paths or across
  the moors, but her spirits were high. Her health had improved in the keen air
  and action was relief to her anxieties. Her brilliant charm won the High
  landers whom she flattered by declaring that she wished she were a man that
  she might sleep on the heather and wear a sword and buckler.</p>

  <p>It was now clear that Moray meant to break the Gordons, and the
  Highlanders divided their loyalties, some for the Queen, some for Huntly.
  John Gordon's brothers refused Mary admission to Inverness Castle and she had
  to take lodgings in the town. This, the capital of the Highlands, on the
  River Ness, that divides the town, at the head of the Moray Firth, was then,
  as now, small in size and built of grey stone. The Castle had been first
  built by Macbeth, who was Marmaor of Moray, and rebuilt by Malcolm Canmore,
  subduer of the Highlands.</p>

  <p>Moray (the Lord James and Mar) instantly attacked the Castle, which had a
  garrison of twelve men, captured it, hanged Alexander Gordon (the governor)
  and set his head on the ramparts. The Queen, refused admission to Castle
  Findlater, rode to Spynie, where the Bishop of Moray, Bothwell's dissolute
  uncle, sheltered her. The Gordons were 'put to the horn', i.e. proclaimed as
  traitors and outlaws, and Moray attacked Findlater and Strathbogie. Huntly
  gathered together five hundred of the Gordons and offered to surrender
  himself if promised an impartial trial, which Mary refused, and Lady Huntly
  in vain tried to obtain an audience of the Queen, who showed a gay
  light-heartedness in the whole affair and left it in the hands of the
  implacable Moray.</p>

  <p>Randolph reported that few took Huntly's part and that the Queen was well
  attended, both with horse and foot. John Gordon's attempt to intercept her
  army at the passage of the Spey failed and he retired to the woods.</p>

  <p>Mary returned to Aberdeen where the autumn days were enlivened by plays,
  games and pageantry. She received gifts of wine, wax, coals and a cup of
  double gilt silver containing five hundred merks. Huntly sent a humble
  message, imploring pardon for the offences of his sons, and his wife openly
  put the blame of the trouble on the Protestants about the Queen who could not
  move Huntly from the old Faith. Mary and her friends found in these appeals
  'much pastime', and she refused to see Lady Huntly again.</p>

  <p>In October Huntly, with seven hundred men, was brought to bay at
  Corrichie, the action being short and decisive. He fell dead from his horse,
  either in an apopletic seizure or from a dagger blow in the back. Sir John
  Gordon was dragged through the streets of Aberdeen, like a criminal, and,
  with six other Gordons, beheaded. Mary watched this spectacle and turned
  faint when it came to the quartering of the victims. That was, for the time,
  the end of Clan Gordon, though Huntly's youngest son, Adam, was spared. His
  eldest, Lord Gordon, was married to Arran's sister and had nothing to do with
  the revolt. He was, however, tried and sentenced to death. He was pardoned
  and, now the ruined, landless Earl of Huntly, became Moray's secret enemy and
  joined forces with another reckless man, Bothwell, who had escaped so easily
  from Edinburgh Castle that it was commonly believed that the Queen wished him
  to be set at liberty.</p>

  <p>Knox busily spread this report and Bothwell retired to Castle Hermitage in
  Liddesdale, where he gathered together his 'Minions of the Moon', Hepburns,
  Hayes and Armistons. Randolph wrote of him contemptuously as 'a very
  stark-naked naughty beggar'. Bothwell, the English envoy gossiped, had no
  money 'saving a Portugal piece sent out of the north by a gentlewoman, who,
  if ever she be a widow, should never be my wife'. Bothwell was not pursued as
  he was believed to be on parole but he did not feel safe and made a dash for
  France. A storm threw him into the power of Elizabeth, who was greatly
  pleased with 'this rash, glorious and hazardous young man'. Mary, however,
  begged that he might be allowed to proceed to France, and on arrival in Paris
  he was given the honourable post of Captain of the Scots Guard.</p>

  <p>Mary's position at this time, the end of the year 1562, seemed good. The
  uncertain Gordons had been finally crushed, the mischievous Bothwell was out
  of the country, the dangerous Arran locked up as a lunatic and her affairs in
  the hands of two of the wisest men in her Kingdom, Moray and Maitland. If
  Elizabeth was still 'driving time', Mary's affairs abroad were promising.
  Spain and France were still offering alliances that seemed to goad Elizabeth,
  even if Mary did not accept them, but preferred to concentrate on schemes for
  the English throne. But Maitland favoured the Spanish alliance with Don
  Carlos, now as insane as Arran, and Mary, too, had moods when she was
  'thinking highly' of her second marriage.</p>

  <p>The first anniversary of the death of Francis I was celebrated by Mary
  with dutiful masses, but she pretended no grief; the frivolity of her Court
  was remarked upon even by the French ambassador, M. de Foix, and she 'greatly
  offended the puritans'. One of their most bitter complaints was voiced
  against her habit of constantly appearing, in mask and play, in masculine
  attire, a costume well suited to her height and slenderness and comfortable
  after her heavy robes, yet one judged by the Scots as quite incompatible with
  queenly and womanly dignity. Her dancing was also detested, John Knox
  inveighing against it with fierce invective. As he knew nothing of Courts it
  has been assumed that he imagined Mary twirling in noisy merriment in the
  jigs and reels familiar to him, but as he darkly glanced at her 'dancing
  alone' in Holyrood it seems more likely that what he had in mind was some
  sinister ritual, akin to that of the black mass, a dancing about an idol, a
  dancing of witches about the cauldron, the prancing and leap ing round the
  devil on St. John's Eve. The stately French measures trodden in the halls of
  Holyrood where Mary bore herself with such admired grace and dignity gave no
  colour to these black surmises, but the puritans found evil even in these.
  The Queen leaned on the breast of her partner, touched his hair, clasped his
  hand, caressed his neck; but as yet there was little scandal attached to her
  name, and George Buchanan continued to write her panegyrics.</p>

  <p>This year (1562) an inventory was made of Mary's ward robe and of her
  jewels, considered to be of fabulous value and the most famous in Europe.</p>

  <p>Among the entries are sixty State gowns; cloth of gold, of silver, of
  velvet, silk and satin; there were fourteen cloaks, five in the Spanish
  fashion, and two royal mantles. Altogether there are one hundred and thirty
  one entries, small articles, simpler gowns and masking or fanciful costumes
  not being included, nor is there any mention of masculine garments. The list
  of jewels contains one hundred and eighty entries. Chief of these was one of
  the crown jewels of France that Mary, saying it was a gift, had contrived to
  bring out of that country. This was the Great Harry and bore the cypher of
  <i>Henri II</i>. It consisted of a remarkably fine diamond, set in gold, to
  which was attached a ruby. Among the other jewels were two of special note,
  the Papal Golden Rose, sent to James IV, and a miniature of James V in a gold
  case. There was, too, the cross of gold, diamonds and rubies that Mary of
  Guise had pawned and that Mary had redeemed for a thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>Among other articles listed is a litter covered with velvet and fringed
  with gold and silk; this was drawn by mules. There were also a coach, hunting
  gear, hunting costumes, the famous 'Spanish furs' of Mary of Guise, a
  head-dress of silver and a velvet glove for shooting at the butts.</p>

  <p>Not only did Mary's policy of conciliating the Protestants stop short of
  forgoing any of the amusements that so scandalized them; she was imprudent
  enough to allow too many gracious kindnesses to one of the poets of her
  Court, an idler of the very type most loathed by the puritans. This was
  Ronsard's pupil, Pierre de Boscohel de Chastelard; a Huguenot, a descendant
  of Bayard, an elegant, comely and charming courtier, who was Mary's partner
  in the dance, at cards, and in her games. She indulged him in a courtly
  coquetry and he wrote her courtly verses.</p>

  <p>During one of the periodical cleanings of Holyrood the Court went to
  Bruntislaw (Bruntisland) and Mary with her train stayed in the Castle of
  Rossend belonging to Kirkcaldy of Grange. This edifice is on the fine coast
  of the Forth, not far from Falkland; and from here, Maitland was sent on an
  embassy to Elizabeth. Shortly before the Court had left Holyrood the grooms
  had discovered Chastelard asleep under the Queen's bed. This incident was not
  told to the Queen until the morning, when she banished the daring poet from
  her presence, but he had contrived to hide among the crowd in Rossend, and
  Mary, entering her bedchamber, saw him standing before her. She called Moray
  from her antechamber and told him to put his dagger through the intruder, but
  Moray considered the scandal such an action would cause and Chastelard was
  arrested, tried for his offence and beheaded near Holyrood House while Mary
  watched at the window. He refused any religious rites and held a copy of
  Ronsard's verses in his hand as he mounted the scaffold.</p>

  <p>The affair passed for the tragedy of a love-crazed poet, but Maitland told
  Quadra, the Spanish envoy, a strange story that related how Chastelard had
  first tried to pass off his escapades as a joke and then confessed that he
  was a spy sent by the French Huguenots to discredit Mary. His intention had
  been to escape to France where he would have been handsomely recompensed for
  smirching the honour of the Queen.</p>

  <p>John Knox had a third version. Chastelard was the Queen's lover. They had
  been discovered and she had sacrificed him that her 'secret might not be
  betrayed'. It was natural for Mary, gay and longing for love, to smile in
  sheer light-hearted courtesy on many men, and the malice of John Knox was
  capable of putting his own meaning into the most innocent actions. Mary was
  much smirched by the Chastelard incident and this greatly troubled the
  prudent Moray.</p>

  <p>All was, however, splendid on the surface as Mary rode to the Parliament
  House in the Tolbooth (once part of St. Giles) soon after the death of
  Chastelard. The first Prince of the Blood, Châtelherault, carried the Crown,
  Moray the sword and Argyll the sceptre. The Queen, robed and crowned, was
  followed by the four Marys and a gorgeous train. She spoke in Scots with a
  French accent. Randolph thought it as fair a sight as ever was seen, and
  found her speech very pretty, but the puritans considered it but 'a painted
  oration'. They were grimly deter mined to find no good in anything that Mary
  did; her grace, her charm, her enchantment had no effect on John Knox or his
  followers.</p>

  <p>Knox, indeed, soon broke out again, thundering from his pulpit that the
  Queen must not marry a Papist. Mary sent for the stern preacher; there was
  another fruitless interview. Knox refused to be moved by what he termed 'the
  pleasing face of a gentlewoman', and when Mary, keeping her temper admirably,
  rebuked him for his freedom of speech he told her roundly he was God's
  mouthpiece, as she would know if fret from the bondage of her errors, and no
  flatterer.</p>

  <p>Mary replied that she did not want flattery but to know by what right he
  interfered in her affairs. The rude answer of Knox was that if the nobles did
  not realize their duty a plain citizen must teach them. Still cool, Mary
  ordered him from her presence.</p>

  <p>When Parliament rose Mary went to Inverary Castle and stayed there with
  her half-sister, Jane Stewart, Countess of Argyll, the closest woman friend
  she had in Scotland after the four Marys. Inverary Castle, on the banks of
  the Loch Fyne, is in one of the most agreeable situations in the West
  Highlands. As the chief town in Argyllshire it was the head quarters of Clan
  Campbell. The old castle has gone; a nineteenth-century mansion has taken its
  place, but the strange and attractive appearance of the little town, with the
  broad quays, arched bridges and view over the lake, remains.</p>

  <p>Mary stayed several weeks in these peaceful solitudes, proceeded to
  Glasgow, a small red-roofed town of many spires, the seat of the Lennox
  Stewarts, then to Kirkcudbright, a town unique in its pleasant and rather odd
  atmosphere. The Castle where Mary rested stood on the long spit of land known
  as St. Mary's Isle and was that belonging to the Earl of Selkirk. From there
  Mary travelled, always on horseback and with a cumbrous train, to Drummond
  Castle and Glenfinlas The first of these is on the road between Crieff and
  Edinburgh and part of it is still in repair and inhabited. For strength and
  majesty it has few equals and the ruins of the superb ancient building, the
  beauty of the leafy park, the two rich gates leading to the remains of the
  great fortress, built out of the living rock, and the situation, far from
  noise and crowds, impress the traveller with a deep sense of grandeur and
  elegant melancholy.</p>

  <p>When Mary stayed there the Castle belonged to the famous family of
  Drummond and was associated with a gloomy tragedy of which her grandfather,
  James IV, was the hero.</p>

  <p>The Prince was early betrothed to Margaret Tudor but had to wait until she
  attained the age of sixteen years. Meanwhile he had fallen in love with
  another Margaret, daughter of the house of Drummond which had already given a
  Queen to Scot land in the person of Annabella, wife to Robert III. James
  formed with this lady one of those dubious unions that caused so much
  bitterness and confusion. She was supposed to be secretly married to him, but
  he never recognized her as Queen; they lived happily together for fifteen
  years and then when the Tudor Princess was ready for marriage James was
  warned he must give up Margaret Drummond. On his refusal, his nobles, who
  wanted the English union, saw to it that Margaret and her two sisters, her
  equals in beauty, were poisoned at a meal they took together at Castle
  Drummond. Two years later</p>

  <p>James VI (sic)* married Margaret Tudor, from whom Mary derived her claim
  to the English throne. When Mary returned to Edinburgh to celebrate her
  twenty-first birthday she found that in her absence John Knox had incited the
  citizens to violate the sanctuary of Holyrood. They had broken into the
  Palace during the celebration of mass, driven the priests from the altar in
  the private chapel and scattered the members of the Queen's household
  gathered there. The preacher was summoned to answer for himself in the
  presence of the Queen and a gathering of notables. Not only had he encouraged
  the lawless Protestants&mdash;he was raising riots against the Judges who
  were trying the ringleaders of the outrages. The Queen sat at the head of the
  Council Chamber, Knox at the foot. Maitland, newly returned from England,
  prosecuted. Mary at once demanded that the charge should be one of high
  treason, but Patrick, Lord Ruthven, put in rudely '<i>We</i> think it no
  treason.' which caused Mary to retort&mdash;'Hold your peace and let him
  answer for himself.'</p>

  <p>[* In fact, James IV. <i>ebook editor.</i>]</p>

  <p>There was a sharp exchange between the Queen and Knox in which she held
  her ground and kept her temper admirably. In the end the preacher was
  pardoned in accordance with the wishes of the Lords. The Queen maintained her
  silent dignity as Knox, on leaving the chamber, said he would pray for her
  heart to be purged of Papistry and her councils of flatterers.</p>

  <p>Mary assured the anxious Randolph that she was not thinking of a second
  marriage, but in fact her suitors were many. Among the names mentioned were
  one of Catherine de Medici's sons, Charles IX and the Duke of Orleans, the
  Duke of Ferrara, the Prince of Condé, the young Duke of Guise, the Cardinal
  of Bourbon and the Duke of Norfolk. Maitland continued to favour the
  ambitious Spanish marriage. He wrote to the King of Spain reciting the
  beauty, chastity and prudence of Mary, of her property in France, large
  revenue from her dowry and her mother's property, and of her treasure and
  jewels 800,000 crowns more. Maitland told Philip II that by such a marriage
  he could 'with no trouble whatever' make himself master of Scotland, England
  and Ireland.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal of Lorraine had sent an envoy, M. du Croc, to Scotland, to
  negotiate a marriage with the Archduke Charles, son of the Emperor, but Mary
  preferred the Spanish match. She was weary of Elizabeth's shifts and evasions
  and her repeated refusal of an interview, and leaned impatiently towards the
  project of asserting her rights in England by means of Philip's army. These
  Spanish negotiations were conducted very secretly. With the most careful
  precautions the Scots and English Roman Catholics were sounded as to the part
  they might play in placing Mary on Elizabeth's throne. Maitland received
  large promises of help, but De Quadra, Bishop of Aguila, the Spanish envoy,
  died at this delicate point, and despite all his prudence the English agents
  had already discovered that the Pope and the Cardinal of Lorraine were
  wishful of giving England as a dowry to Mary and Carlos or the Archduke and,
  despite the emphatic denials of Maitland, the rumour reached Scotland and
  gave John Knox a text for one of his violent trumpetings against the Pope,
  the Cardinal and the Queen. Mary instantly summoned him to Holyrood. He went
  in his most thunderous mood and found her in a 'vehement fume'.</p>

  <p>She told Knox that she had taken much from him and patiently borne his
  tirades against herself and her uncles, that she had reasoned with him and
  tried to gain his favour&mdash;'And yet I cannot be quit of you. I vow to God
  I shall be avenged.'</p>

  <p>Mary sobbed and wept with exasperation, but John Knox was not moved. He
  had his usual excuse ready&mdash;he was the mouthpiece of God. Mary demanded,
  interrupting:</p>

  <p>'What have you to do with my marriage?' Knox answered that as all her
  nobles were flatterers he had to point out their duty, and on Mary again
  angrily asking&mdash;'What have you to do with my marriage?'
  adding&mdash;'And what are you in this commonwealth?' the preacher made the
  answer so popular among the common folk&mdash;'A subject born within the
  same, Madam.'</p>

  <p>Erskine of Dunn then tried to coax and flatter Mary, who could not
  restrain her tears or compose herself, but Knox refused to unbend. He
  increased the Queen's wrath by likening her weeping to the tears of his own
  sons when he chastized them and she ordered him from the room. But Knox did
  not depart without reproving the Queen's ladies who, arrayed in Paris
  fashions, were in the ante-chamber. He took a grave view of their frivolity,
  remarked on their trains ('targeted tails') and reminded them of the certain
  appearance, one day, of 'the knave death'.</p>

  <p>In February 1563 the Duke of Guise was assassinated at Orléans, a severe
  political and personal loss for Mary. The same year saw the death of the
  Grand Prior, from fatigues and chills taken at the battle of Dreux. The
  Marquis d'Elboeuf also died young, and in a short time Mary was deprived of
  all her Guise uncles save the two Cardinals; she still relied entirely on the
  advice of the first of these, the Cardinal of Lorraine.</p>

  <p>Mary's angry interview with Knox was in May. The rest of that summer she
  spent hunting in Argyllshire and Atholl, filling in the intervals between the
  chase and the hawking with the amusements and games that so disgusted the
  Puritans. By September she had returned to Edinburgh. Randolph had arrived
  from London and she received him not in Holyrood but in Craigmillar Castle, a
  splendid residence on the outskirts of the capital.</p>

  <p>Craigmillar is now a ruin in a built-over area. In Mary's time it was in
  the open country, far from the foul smells of Edinburgh and the stenches in
  the small rooms at Holyrood. Craigmillar was once a fortress and had been the
  scene of the death in captivity of that splendid young athlete John, Earl of
  Mar, youngest brother of James III&mdash;it was difficult for Mary to find a
  residence in Scotland not associated with some tragedy of the Stewarts. The
  ruin still has an unusual feature, part of the outer defence standing and one
  of Mary's rooms is still shown. The ramparts, rising from the rock on which
  the ruin stands, afford interesting walks; near by is a group of cottages
  known as Little France and supposed to be named from accommodation once built
  here for the members of Mary's numerous household who could not find room in
  the Castle.</p>

  <p>Randolph and Mary continued their courteous fencing. Randolph said that
  the goodwill of Elizabeth depended on Mary making a marriage that would not
  cause trouble to England. She referred him to Moray and Maitland. He had a
  secret mission to these advisers of the Queen and that was to propose as
  Mary's husband Lord Robert Dudley, the man with whom Elizabeth had created so
  lively a scandal. Elizabeth had already made this proposal to Maitland when
  he was in England, adding great praise of Dudley 'so dearly prized by
  herself' and whom if 'she wished to marry she would prefer to all the princes
  in the world'. Maitland had answered that his Queen would not take away from
  Elizabeth one whose companionship she so valued, but here was the suggestion
  again. Maitland thought it a bait to keep Mary off the Spanish marriage.
  Elizabeth was so set against this that the new Spanish ambassador, De Guzman,
  thought that Elizabeth would marry Carlos herself rather than see him married
  to Mary.</p>

  <p>Mary became extremely depressed. Fits of melancholy weeping were
  alternated with long collapses. At Christmas-time (1563) she was very ill
  with a pain in her side, and once more not expected to live. The problem of
  her marriage was tearing at her nerves: it seemed impossible either to
  conciliate Elizabeth and win England that way or to find the means of ousting
  her by force. Not only were the majority of the Scots against a foreign
  marriage, Catherine de Medici had become her open enemy and determined to
  thwart any schemes for a marriage either with one of her own sons or any
  other French prince&mdash;her impossible candidate for Mary's hand was the
  lunatic Arran.</p>

  <p>Finally, after several months in Scotland, Randolph offered Mary
  Elizabeth's choice&mdash;Dudley. Mary was startled, but compromised; she
  suggested a meeting of Scots and English at Berwick for the summer (1564).
  Randolph tried once more to arrange an interview between the two Queens, but
  in vain. Elizabeth wrote to Mary asking that the exiled Lord Lennox and his
  sons might return to Scotland and Mary gave permission. She went on another
  (her second) progress to the North, and by September (1564) had returned to
  Holyrood in better health and spirits. She then sent an accomplished
  courtier, Sir James Melville, to sound Elizabeth, who wasted his time with
  crooked courtesies, inquisitive questions and idle conversations about
  feminine fashions, together with a good deal of coquetry relating to Dudley's
  picture and the question of her looks and charms compared with those of Mary.
  As regards the return of Lennox to Scotland she had changed her mind and told
  Mary so but, despite all the flatteries, Mary wrote a stiff reply stating
  that Lennox should come home. Melville saw this nobleman and his son, Darnley
  or Darley, at the investiture of Dudley as the Earl of Leicester where the
  young man, as nearest Prince of the Blood, bore the sword of honour.
  Elizabeth pointed him out, asking if Melville did not like him better than
  Dudley.</p>

  <p>Melville spoke slightingly of Darnley, remarking that no woman of spirit
  would choose one so lusty, beardless and baby-faced who was 'liker a woman
  than a man'.</p>

  <p>There had been several rumours to the effect that Darnley might marry
  Mary. In his favour he had his royal blood, his descent, his strong claim to
  the two thrones. A union between him and the Scots Queen would save many
  dynastic disputes; then, as he was poor and helpless, he could not cause the
  trouble a foreign prince with foreign armies might. Besides, for all
  Melville's scorn, Darnley's beauty, grace, height and athletic
  accomplishments were considered to be much in his favour. He was eighteen
  years of age and nothing was known. of his character. Elizabeth outdid
  herself in compliments to Mary, and Leicester, on hearing Mary's rejection of
  his suit, excused himself very humbly, and put the blame of the impudent
  proposal on to Cecil, his secret enemy who had made it only to shame him.
  Melville returned with all this news to Mary who was half persuaded that she
  had a friend in Elizabeth; but Melville was of the opinion that the English
  Queen was showing great dissimulation, and acting under fear of losing her
  kingdom to Mary.</p>

  <p>In the autumn (1564) Randolph was ready to arrange the meeting of
  politicians at Berwick to discuss Mary's marriage. Lennox had reached the
  Scots Court and was well received; his wife and Darnley were to follow. Moray
  and Maitland tried to come to some terms with Elizabeth but she, with the
  help of Cecil, continued to evade them. The King of Spain had withdrawn the
  offer of the hand of Carlos and Catherine de Medici was still thwarting the
  Cardinal of Lorraine's effort to marry Mary in France. There seemed, both to
  the Queen and her advisers, no hope but in the old policy of conciliating
  Elizabeth and waiting patiently for her death. Mary blandly declared she was
  entirely in the hands of the English Queen&mdash;she might even be willing to
  take Leicester, if that match would please Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>The winter (1564-65) was extremely severe. The sufferings of the
  poverty-scourged people were terrible; many deadly illnesses became endemic;
  even Scotland, used to such evils, had never within living memory been so
  stricken, and never had Mary's Court been merrier.</p>

  <p>After the Christmas celebrations in Edinburgh the Court went to Fife and
  Mary lodged in a house built by one Hugh Scrymgeour in St. Andrews. This
  building is still shown under the name of Queen Mary's House and in it she
  had several rooms and an oratory looking on to the chapel of St. Leonards.
  From St. Andrews Mary moved to Wemyss Castle. There Lord Darnley, on his way
  to see his father at Dunkeld, presented himself. The Queen thought well of
  him and made civil remarks about his appearance; he had been carefully
  trained as befitted a prince. He returned from a short visit to his father
  and travelled south. His first days in Edinburgh were spent in hearing Knox
  preach, in dining with Moray and Randolph and in dancing a 'galiarde' with
  the Queen. Everyone liked him for his youth, beauty and fine manners.</p>

  <p>When Mary had given way, in the hopes of pleasing Elizabeth, on the
  question of the Dudley match she had expected to receive in return the
  long-coveted acknowledgement of her right as heiress to the English throne;
  but now (March 1565) Elizabeth, through Randolph, told Mary that if she
  married Leicester (Dudley) or not, she, Elizabeth, could not even examine
  Mary's right to the succession until either she, Elizabeth, had decided to
  marry or to remain single. At this news Mary was bitterly moved and 'wept her
  fill'. She felt fooled and frustrated, and had difficulty in constraining her
  disappointment and anger. Maitland gave up trying to come to terms with
  Elizabeth; he and others thought that Leicester had been offered only to keep
  other suitors off, and suspicions began to be roused as to Elizabeth's
  reasons in sending the brilliant Darnley to Mary's Court. Compared with those
  of her suitors she had seen or heard described, the lunatic Arran, the
  quasi-imbecile Valois Princes, the crazy Don Carlos, the young Lennox
  Stewart, English by training, was comely, lively and splendid indeed. He
  entered with ease and zest into all her sports and pleasures and when, during
  a stay of the Court at Stirling Castle, he fell ill with measles Mary
  carefully supervised his nursing.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth now recalled Lennox and his son, a move calculated to make Mary
  retain them, since they were her subjects. Mary's headlong resolve to marry
  Darnley was now formed; she would not listen to Moray, Maitland or Randolph,
  all of whom were against the match. Mary's reasons were the hopelessness of
  waiting either for the Spanish marriage or any decision from Elizabeth, and
  the advantages Darnley offered as being a Stewart and the next after herself
  in succession to the crown. She moved rapidly. Charles IX readily agreed, the
  Cardinal of Lorraine was willing to give way, Philip II promised his
  protection and added that he would, if occasion rose, help the royal pair to
  assert their claims to the English throne. But the marriage speedily became
  unpopular with the Protestant Scots. The Lennox Stewarts, exiles and
  traitors, had always been disliked and Darnley, once assured of his high
  fortunes, began to show the immaturity of his character in an arrogance the
  other Scots Lords found intolerable.</p>

  <p>Moray stood out boldly against the marriage. He had several interviews
  with Mary, stormy on her part, steadfast on his. She accused him of wanting
  to set the crown on his own head and gave him 'many sore words'. Moray based
  his objections on Darnley's religion; he had others he was not so plain
  about. He dreaded seeing Mary and Scotland in the power of this unknown but
  obviously inexperienced and haughty stripling; this feeling was shared by the
  Lords.</p>

  <p>Randolph reported the intense dislike of the match and of the Queen's
  behaviour in forcing it&mdash;'They think their nation dishonoured, the Queen
  shamed, their country undone...she is now held in open contempt of her
  people'.</p>

  <p>Mary, on Darnley's behalf, quarrelled with Châtelherault and Argyll. Her
  behaviour was so reckless that those about her thought she was bewitched.
  Elizabeth sent an official warning against the marriage and Mary flippantly
  replied that Elizabeth had objected to all her foreign suitors and Darnley
  was of the blood royal. However, she promised to stay her hand in granting
  Darnley further honours (she had already created him Earl of Ross) and to
  consider 'the man and the matter'.</p>

  <p>But she was unable to consider anything. Throckmorton, who had joined
  Randolph in Scotland, wrote with pain and pity of the Queen, hitherto so
  wise, so worthy, so honourable, now so lost in transports of love, and
  predicted that the marriage would bring disaster on both England and
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>Mary, who had had so much, had never had love. She had been tormented
  about the question of her marriage, thwarted and pestered about her religion,
  confounded in her politics, and it was inevitable that she should, sooner or
  later, indulge her longing for tenderness, sympathy, passion, and endeavour
  to assuage her essential loneliness with a dear companion. Darnley, by coming
  into her life at this moment, with his beauty, grace and his easy falling
  into her courtly ways, became the embodiment of her dreams. In her ecstasy
  she threw aside all restraint, all decorum, all pride, and moved to
  compassion all who surrounded her. They were embarrassed by this display of
  naked passion, the more so as Darnley was no ardent lover.</p>

  <p>The wilful and wayward boy thought only of ambition and quickly lost his
  head, outraging all who came near him by his pride and insolence. Once he
  drew a dagger on a messenger from the Queen, and he took no heed of her
  entreaties to abate his temper and suspicion. His closest ally in the Court
  was another hated and despised by the Lords, one David Rizzio, then Mary's
  French secretary and employed on her correspondence with Spain and France.
  Melville had already warned Mary that she was showing too much favour to this
  foreigner but she had put him off lightly and Rizzio continued in his office,
  one that kept him about the Queen. He was a singer in the chapel of the envoy
  of the Duke of Savoy, of no particular qualifications, wit, charm or looks,
  nor did he bear his high office with meekness, but flaunted himself before
  the high born Lords. Eager to please Mary and to curry favour from the rising
  star, he now helped on the Darnley marriage by all the means in his power,
  i.e. backstairs intrigues; but this employment of the low-born Italian
  dangerously exasperated Moray and Maitland, now out of favour and put aside
  from Court and counsels.</p>

  <p>Excited by her love, Mary defied Elizabeth. She quite well understood that
  Darnley had been sent to Scotland to degrade her, but that mattered not at
  all. She had done with all of them, their caution, their advice, their
  delays, and now she would please herself. Her main excuse for this
  recklessness was in the person of Darnley; even Randolph noted his 'fair
  face', others found his presence 'worthy of an emperor', 'a comely prince of
  a large and fair stature'. For athletic prowess he was considered the first
  prince of the age; as an expert horseman, tennis player, lutanist and dancer
  he had all the accomplishments that could take the eye. Despite his arrogance
  and rages he could assume a soft and insinuating address and all his
  appointments were magnificent. Elizabeth, with a keen eye for masculine
  attractions, had judged well when she sent Darnley to Scotland.</p>

  <p>So familiar did Darnley become with the Queen that it was rumoured they
  were married secretly, in April or in July. The banns were proclaimed on the
  22nd of July (1565), Darnley, already Earl of Ross, being created Duke of
  Albany, a royal title that never had fortunate associations for the House of
  Stewart. Darnley, however, was never known by these two titles, but always
  referred to as Darnley, or, as he was, on his marriage, proclaimed King (not
  with the crown matrimonial), the King or King Henry. Mary wished that 'Prince
  Henry' should be named King during the continuance of the marriage.</p>

  <p>There were none of the splendid ceremonies held when she was united to the
  Dauphin repeated at her second marriage in the chapel of Holyrood House. Mary
  wore a widow's mourn ing and the spectators were gloomy; it was commonly
  believed that the bride had been the groom's mistress since some invalid
  ceremony at Stirling and everyone disapproved of the recent development of
  her character. Under the influence of her suddenly aroused passion she had
  shown herself wilful, head strong, ambitious to an extent no one expected in
  the prudent pupil of the Guises&mdash;'All things now grow libertine and the
  Queen taketh upon her to do as she pleases' noted Randolph, who thought that
  Moray was a loyal friend to the Queen and would have served her faithfully
  had she not thrown him over in her infatuation for Darnley. Mary was observed
  to bear a personal spite against the counsellor to whose advice she had
  hitherto so gravely listened. It was believed, not only among the Court
  observers but among the people, that the Protestant Moray had spoken severely
  to Mary on the subject of Rizzio, giving her that good advice that is always
  resented. Randolph thought that Moray had 'surprised her secret', which was
  that she was the mistress of the eager, vivacious and cunning Italian. This
  suggestion made the Queen, hitherto 'unblemished' in reputation, dishonour
  herself with a base-born foreigner while indulging a headlong passion for a
  strange youth. Darnley had his own reasons for wishing to overthrow Moray.
  Looking at a map of Scotland and seeing all the Church lands Moray possessed,
  Darnley had said: 'It is too much.' So for this offence alone Moray must go,
  and with him and Maitland went all the stability, order and prestige of
  Mary's government.</p>

  <p>The beautiful Darnley had come like Asmodeus, the angel of mischief, into
  Wemyss Castle. The Protestant Lords were already deeply affronted by the
  favouritism shown to 'Seigneur Davie' (Rizzio) and would not on any account
  tolerate this Lennox Stewart, despised as a boy, an Englishman (by education)
  and a haughty upstart. He had no sober adviser, no settled plan of conduct or
  of politics; his father, Mathew, Earl of Lennox, was a mere opportunist of no
  ability, his mother was hotly ambitious but prudent and discreet; it was
  supposed that had she been in Scotland she would have restrained Darnley,
  who, once he was secure of Mary, played for power and power only, using no
  judgment, tact, feeling or discretion. It did not need an acute observer to
  prophesy that if Mary had gone headlong to her marriage, he was going
  headlong to his doom. When he was proclaimed King at the Mercat Cross only
  his father cried: 'God save His Grace!'</p>

  <p>Mary had begged Melville to show friendship for Rizzio&mdash;'hated
  without reason'. She might have asked the same for her husband, for he was
  soon as loathed in Scotland as the Italian, his jackal and toady. But Mary
  was unheeding; she cared nothing for the isolation of her position, the
  drawing away of the Lords, the offended aloofness of Elizabeth, the fact that
  even the Cardinal of Lorraine was dubious in his support. When the mourning
  robes had been unpinned after her marriage and she had stepped from crape
  veils revealing brilliant holiday attire, she had no longer been the wise,
  prudent pupil of the Guises whom Throckmorton had held up as an example to
  Elizabeth Tudor. She had asserted her own character, revealed her own
  personality. She showed herself as a vindictive, reckless, woman, cunning in
  small deceit, using duplicity as her only statecraft, and for pleasure,
  careless of her reputation, impulsive and capable of cruelty and violence. In
  Darnley she believed she had found her happiness; between them they would
  carry out the project which she had cherished when she had come
  home&mdash;the scheme of the Guises for a counter-Reformation in
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>Obliged to temporize by proclamations in favour of the Reformers, and even
  going to the length of listening to an exposition of their doctrines, Mary
  was secretly dictating letters to Rizzio that assured the Pope of her
  unfaltering intention to reintroduce Catholicism in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The behaviour of the Queen caused John Knox to be regarded with redoubled
  awe as a prophet, a wizard, a man of God. Mary and her crew were behaving as
  he had always grimly foretold they would behave and bringing on Scotland
  those disasters&mdash;including civil war&mdash;he had always foreseen. Her
  perilous position was observed with relish by the preacher; he had never
  ceased to fight against her with every weapon on which he could lay his hand
  She did not deceive him; without any knowledge of European politics he
  guessed her design to follow the lessons of the Guises. He had sensed the
  force of Philip II behind the Spanish marriage project, he guessed that
  'Seigneur Davie' was secretly writing to the Pope, he noted the foolish
  marriage, the character of Darnley, the reaction of the Lords and the people;
  he continued to prophesy disaster.</p>

  <p>Nor was he the only gloomy augur. Randolph, viewing the new King,
  remarked: 'It is greatly to be feared he can have no long life among this
  people.' The Englishman found Darnley 'proud, disdainful and suspicious',
  while the Queen continued to behave 'without princely majesty or fear of
  God'. Mary's luxury was even more unbounded than before. The 'merriment' was
  considered scandalous. Witchcraft was openly spoken of, the crystal ornaments
  exchanged between members of the Queen's household were known to be charms,
  the toys that Mary loved passed from hand to hand in extravagant profusion;
  and when she and her friends played at billiards, watches, rings and brooches
  were the stakes. Lennox gave Mary a jewel notable even among her collection.
  There were also curious gifts to the four Marys; the seven hundred pounds he
  had brought from England was spent in this way; and the returned exile thus
  tried to bribe his way back into favour.</p>

  <p>Knox never ceased to keep a hard eye on these, to him, not only wasteful
  but unholy junketings. He pointed to such episodes as the public hanging of
  one of the Queen's French servants, who had murdered her love-born child, as
  evidence of the corruption of the Queen's Court, and hinted at worse horrors
  taking place in Holyrood than illicit intrigues. This episode was the basis
  of a very famous ballad, 'Mary Hamilton', that greatly smirched the Queen's
  Marys, all of them above reproach, by altering names and dates. There was no
  'Mary Hamilton', 'Mary Carmichael', among these ladies, nor was there 'a
  King' when the servant was hanged (1563), but the beautiful verse was
  extremely popular and not easily detected as a libellous pasquinade. The
  Protestants constantly put about such attacks on the Queen and her following.
  As the ballads were sung they reached a public that could neither read nor
  write and who had no means of checking the names of those about the
  Court.</p>

  <p>In the summer of her second marriage Mary glittered with a feverish
  brilliance; she had had her own way and the Protestant Lords had fled before
  her. In the midst of the rumours of plots and counter-plots she kept her
  head; her intention was to show a strong front. Hatred was between her and
  the Lords, a hatred not always there with Moray, not there with Maitland who
  regarded her diminished beauty, her uneasiness under bravado, her reckless
  gaiety, with compassion. The worst of her misfortunes was that Darnley did
  not love her; he regarded her with no more than a gust of liking soon ended.
  To Mary, used from early childhood to praise, to the hyperbole of Ronsard and
  Marot, to the flatteries of the Guises, to the chivalrous adoration of such
  men as Chastelard, Darnley had nothing to offer. To him she was not an object
  of either passion or tender regard. He had one strong trait&mdash;ambition;
  for the rest, he was interested in the athletics and games in which he
  excelled.</p>

  <p>Soon after their marriage he was defiant to Mary, as violent, as reckless,
  as headstrong as she had become for his sake. He showed no gratitude for what
  his marriage had done for him. Not satisfied with the law title of King, he
  wanted the crown matrimonial; it was the most poignant aspect of Mary's
  dilemma that her impetuous passion had been roused by this shallow, immature
  youth. Bothwell resigned his position as Captain of the Scots Guard in Paris,
  returned to Scotland and waited in his Border castle; he had received an
  invitation from the Queen. Mary asked Darnley to wait until he was twenty-one
  years of age before he was made legally King but 'he, in no case, would have
  it deferred one day and either then or never'. Mary had few men to rely upon
  in the approaching crisis; to the husband, to the Italian, she had added 'the
  lewd minded Bothwell, crazy with ambition'.</p>

  <p>On hearing of an alleged plot to kidnap herself and Darnley, and that
  Moray was implicated, Mary asked him to return to Edinburgh with eighty
  friends, to clear himself. On his refusal he was 'put to the horn'&mdash;this
  meant a state of civil war. Mary decided to make a throw for complete power.
  She put Bothwell in command of her armies, she called up her lieges to fight
  for her, she proceeded with determination and force, she thwarted Darnley by
  giving the Border command to Bothwell instead of to Lennox. By September
  (1565) she had driven the discontented Lords from pillar to post in 'the
  chase about raid'. In vain they had appealed to Elizabeth who disliked Mary's
  behaviour but did not approve of rebellion. Rizzio increased in favour with
  Mary, to the scandal even of her well-wishers. She showed herself vindictive;
  she wanted revenge for all her mother and herself had endured at the hands of
  the Lords. In particular she wanted revenge on Moray for daring to meddle in
  her love affairs. She pardoned the Earl of Huntly and promised him his
  estates again; he marched with her from Edinburgh to meet the rebels at
  Dumfries. Mary wore scarlet and gold over mail, a steel helmet and carried
  pistols. Darnley also wore armour. The rest of the army were without mail, in
  'jacks'. Mary had but one woman with her and had pawned some of her jewels to
  pay the troops, but she had written a haughty letter to Elizabeth on the
  subject of the English Border raids and the harbouring of 'the traitors'.</p>

  <p>Everyone remarked on her gallant bearing, her courage, her boldness, her
  personal hatred of Moray; 'here is the mischief, here is the grief' wrote
  Randolph, who noted sadly that 'a more wilful woman and none more wedded to
  her own opinion without reason, order or discretion, I never did know or hear
  of. He observed also that Mary had all the most despised of the Scots with
  her, men 'so ill spoken of that worst cannot be thought than is common in
  men's mouths'.</p>

  <p>Cornered at Dumfries the rebels escaped into England where Moray was
  publicly rebuked by Elizabeth, who sent the usual false protestations of
  friendship to Mary. Philip II sent money to help Mary but the ship was
  wrecked off the English coast and the bullion seized by the Earl of
  Northumberland, who kept it, despite claims by England and Scotland.</p>

  <p>In this energetic, spirited and successful assault on the rebel Lords Mary
  visited several places that, although they contain nothing of her time, have
  still something of the aspect they wore in the sixteenth century. As they are
  easily reached they may well be included in the itinerary of the traveller
  following Mary of Scotland across, up and down, about and along her native
  country. Such a journey will show how frequently, how rapidly, she moved and
  how short a time she stayed in each place.</p>

  <p>Although it was August (1564) when the Queen left Edinburgh, the weather
  was wild and the ways foul. The march over the rough tracks was difficult and
  often dangerous; even Knox admired 'the man-like courage of the Queen', who
  rode foremost. The first stop was at Callendar in the lovely valley of the
  Treith, still unspoiled and a convenient gateway to the Trossachs. Here, at
  Callendar House, Mary issued her proclamation stating her movements and,
  after one night, moved into Kilsyth, many of her soldiers deserting by reason
  of the roughness of the ways. But the main body pushed on to Glasgow,
  stronghold of Darnley's father, next to St. Andrews, then to Stirling, which
  she reached on the 30th September (1564). Dundee and Perth stood out for the
  Lords; if Mary had had the means she would have sacked the former city, but
  she was in want of money and Dundee was let off with a fine. St. Andrews and
  Perth also paid levies. But the Lords had no money at all, nor any arms; when
  Mary was at Dumfries they were already at Newcastle.</p>

  <p>Mary left a strong body of men under Bothwell at Dumfries and returned by
  Lochmaben to Edinburgh in the middle of October with a hundred and forty
  horse. Her progress had been most disorderly, the men unwilling and
  untrained. They pillaged as they went, and a small body of disciplined troops
  could have easily dispersed them. They were triumphant because they had never
  been opposed.</p>

  <p>Dumfries is a most attractive place&mdash;Queen of the South&mdash;and not
  looking now like a setting for the bold, vindictive Mary at the head of her
  ragged army. A ruin then marked the site of the Grayfriars Monastery where
  Robert the Bruce had murdered Red Comyn; now there is a church, but the
  atmosphere of cobbled streets, narrow and twisting, of grey houses, is the
  same, especially on a day of tempest and rain. The country about is sombre
  and melancholy, little changed from the days when the Lords fled from Mary's
  floundering troops.</p>

  <p>When the Queen returned to Edinburgh her affairs seemed in good trim. Her
  direct action, her example of personal stead fastness, the wavering policies
  of Elizabeth, had made her mistress of Scotland. She had no open opposition
  to face, no tutelage to fear. The wise counsellors, the prudent supporters
  were defeated. Moray, the object of her hatred, was a ruined man, a
  supplicant at the English Court; Châtelherault, first Prince of the Blood,
  submitted and went into exile. Moray, Argyll, Glencairn, Rothes, Ochiltree,
  Boyd, Kirkcaldy of Grange and other of the Lords were summoned from the
  Market Cross to appear before Parliament and answer for their faults, and in
  March (1566) only Morton, the false Puritan, with a foot in either camp,
  remained in Mary's Council. For the rest, she had at last her own choice,
  Darnley, Bothwell, Rizzio, all men hated by the people, condemned by the
  mighty Knox, all men of whom no good had ever been said. Mary's habits
  changed. There were no more Latin readings with Buchanan; the famous scholar
  left the Court in disdain. There were no more studies of history or serious
  books; the Queen's handsome and well-furnished library was neglected. All she
  did of business lay in the French and Italian letters Seigneur Davie wrote
  when they were closeted together in her little apartments at Holyrood;
  letters written to the Pope, to Philip II, to the Cardinal of Lorraine, to
  any who might help her to gain the English throne and re-establish
  Catholicism in the British Isles.</p>

  <p>That winter (1565-66) was the climax of Mary's political career and of her
  personal life. Outwardly she seemed secure, victorious, mistress at last of
  her own fortunes, married to a man of about her own age and choice, with
  claims next to hers to the English throne, a man as beautiful, strong and
  brilliant as her first husband had been plain, feeble and dull, and that
  winter it was known that she would have a child the following summer, the
  long-awaited heir who might unite the two kingdoms.</p>

  <p>This, then, may be a proper moment for pausing to regard with some
  philosophical detachment Mary's stay and in particular her position in this
  winter when she was 'merry making' in Holyrood, twenty-four years of age and
  in the ascendant. A visit to the miniature Palace in the winter, a clear
  twilight with snow fallen but not flying, will afford a fitting scene for the
  background of these thoughts. If it is possible to enter the Park a fine view
  of the Palace and ruined chapel, dark against the whitened hills, will give a
  clear idea of what Mary's most famous dwelling looked like when her story was
  played out there. By this light the alterations the centuries have brought
  are not noticeable. The deer park seems to stretch indefinitely. Arthur's
  seat, with the suggestion of the couchant lion, rises majestically into a
  sombre sky. Fences, low bushes, a mass of small houses, cottages and hovels
  form the sanctuary where the rabble of Edinburgh took shelter. Further on,
  the Canon's quarters are round the entrance to the grounds and through them
  is the main street of Edinburgh, 'the royal mile' that leads to Knox's house
  in the High Street, past St. Giles, through the Lawnmarket to the Castle on
  the rock. Holyrood Road, also branching from the Park, leads to the Cowgate,
  the Grassmarket to the West Port. This roughly accounts for the whole of
  Mary's capital. When she went to Leith, to play golf or shoot at the butts on
  the sands, she would take a country track (now Calton Road) and reach Leith
  Street, riding over the open fields.</p>

  <p>Now this would be a melancholy visit, for the Palace is (save rarely)
  closed and remains a black outline, set, defenceless, in the ancient
  Augustine territory. But in this famous winter of 1565-66 all the windows
  would be lit, smoke would be rising from the clustered chimney pots and a
  glow of colour would come from the monks' chapel where the Stewart Kings lay
  buried. There would be the continual sound of music; not only did Mary have a
  band of trained musicians of rare quality, she played herself, delicately, on
  the virginals. Darnley was an expert lutanist and Rizzio a professional
  singer with a rich bass voice.</p>

  <p>If we could&mdash;a time-honoured game&mdash;when musing here, this winter
  night, enter Holyrood and find it as it was four hundred years ago we should
  come upon a scene of crowded luxury impossible to exaggerate in the
  description.</p>

  <p>The greater part of Mary's treasure was housed here; all the small rooms
  and galleries were hung with tapestries, mostly of silk, gold and silver
  thread, cloth of the same material covered the floors, the heavy furniture
  was golden oak, not yet blackened, and the ornaments, vases, mirrors,
  candelabra and paintings were of costly materials and curious workmanship.
  Curtains of Venetian damask or cut velvet hung at the windows and round the
  beds; even the servants' quarters were finely furnished. As the Court was so
  often absent from Holyrood it was frequently cleaned and therefore fairly
  free of objectionable stenches, but everywhere were perfumes even to essences
  scattered on the logs of the wood fires. The Queen's immense wardrobe was
  hung in great presses, her jewels were kept in huge chests. She had a
  bath-house where she tended her beauty, lately so haggard, with lotions,
  unguents and creams, all carefully compounded by her private apothecary. In
  her tiring room her perukes were set on stands. In the laundry were piles of
  the lawn, cambric, lace and gauze garments she wore once only before the deft
  Frenchwomen re-starched, goffered and ironed them. There was a cabinet of
  sweetmeats and another for the Queen's embroideries, for she found a nervous
  release in sorting the colours of the knotted silks and in stitching the
  designs drawn by the Court draughtsman. Everything she touched was rare,
  costly and chosen by an exquisite and luxurious taste; everyone about her was
  gorgeously dressed. Even the low-born knave Davie went clad in the Queen's
  lavish gifts; on her marriage she had given him yards of satin, brocade and
  damask. She had presented him with jewels from her unrivalled store.</p>

  <p>This Palace, so dark outside, set in the lovely, sombre park, backed by
  the remote, melancholy mountains, had an interior like a box of spice and
  gems; the contrast to the town, a crowded mass of houses, desecrated
  churches, convents and monasteries, the rough market places, the rude shops,
  the causeways packed with hawkers, the vast Castle on the rock, was poignant.
  More emphatic still was the contrast with the rest of Scotland, so wild, so
  remote from Europe, so sparsely populated, so sombre in landscape, so gloomy
  in weather. The desperate imitation of French Court life, the attempt to
  revive the glories of Fontainebleau, Joinville or Chenonceaux in Scotland was
  gallant and touching, but, against the character of the country and the
  temper of the people, it was doomed to a terrible failure.</p>

  <p>Why were all these people, young, brilliant, fortunate, going headlong to
  their doom? They had had their lessons; the Tudor education was superb. They
  had heard of Nemesis; the priests had warned them 'vanity of
  vanities'&mdash;they had many fearful examples before them. Yet we are told
  they were all 'crazed with ambition'. It is not easy to understand this same
  ambition. Why did Mary, twice a queen, exhaust herself scheming for a third
  throne? Why did Darnley, extremely lucky to be so 'perked up' in his early
  youth, risk all to gain further honour? Why did Bothwell, already one of the
  great ones of his own country, long to be greater still? They all desired
  absolute power, yet they knew the history of kings and queens, regents and
  rulers. None of them had a settled policy like Elizabeth, whose ambition was
  guided by Cecil and other steadfast men and bound up with the very existence
  of England, a poor, struggling country, or like Maitland or Moray, whose aim
  was the union of North and South. Mary wanted her religion supreme but only
  in order that she might reign over three kingdoms. She never considered if
  the ancient Faith suited the Scots or the English; she took no warning from
  the murder of Cardinal Beaton, the murder of the Duke of Guise, the dangerous
  defiance of that dangerous man, Knox. And what was it to be King&mdash;to be
  Queen? To have the cringing of underlings, the finest palaces, retinues,
  houses, hunting parks, garments, jewels, to go on progresses and receive
  gifts, to have the power of life, death, banishment&mdash;these are childish
  wishes. They represent a very crude conception of the power of the Prince of
  the Air, but they were, in these mid years of the sixteenth century,
  irresistible lures for Mary and the men she had drawn into her circle.</p>

  <p>The lives of the Stewart Kings had been 'nasty, brutish and short'; they
  had&mdash;most of them&mdash;died by horrid violence, yet here was this young
  woman, their descendant, who might, in retirement, have enjoyed all the
  delights of civilization, exerting every nerve to be a third time Queen. It
  was indeed like an enchantment; the <i>ignus fatuus</i> danced over perilous
  swamps where all, even life itself, might be lost. None of those in Holyrood
  that winter day heeded prudence or even common sense. They engaged in a
  struggle for a phantom power with a deep ferocity, at first concealed but
  soon to be most horribly revealed.</p>

  <p>Mary continued to favour 'Davie', who came to be the chief influence at
  her Court. His whilom patron Darnley, who had found him so useful as a
  go-between, soon turned against him and his exactions. It was insolence
  meeting insolence; the Prince and titular King, himself intolerably haughty,
  found the airs of the upstart plebeian foreigner insufferable; he echoed
  Moray in asking Mary to get rid of the man. Mary refused. Her passion had
  speedily exhausted itself, and she preferred the company of the Italian, who
  was suave, flattering, adroit, useful, interested in her views, eager in her
  service, to the royal youth who, once he was sure of her, was hardly civil,
  spending his time away from her save when he was pestering for the crown
  matrimonial.</p>

  <p>Throckmorton, seeing that Scotland was sinking under this frivolous and
  unstable government, advised the recall of the banished Lords. Elizabeth did
  not want anarchy in the North. Rizzio, the all-powerful favourite, began 'to
  mell' in the matter, considering that a friend like Moray might be useful.
  Moray wrote to him privately, sending a fine diamond, offering friendship.
  Darnley also turned to the man he had helped to drive into exile, saying he
  would assist Moray to return if Moray would assist him to the crown
  matrimonial, and at the same time he schemed with his father, Lennox. The
  watchful Randolph thought they wanted to seize the crown for themselves, 'to
  cut the throat' of Rizzio and 'dispose' of Mary. This was in February (1566).
  He wrote that the young husband believed she was 'false' with the Italian.
  She had been (publicly) married seven months and Darnley had been the object
  of a vehement passion that had scandalized Europe. The Queen who had been so
  'unblemished' had very rapidly lost her reputation, both as Queen and woman.
  Darnley's ready suspicions were partly due to her own extreme easiness with
  himself and the fact that he had never loved her or even descried her; save
  for her possession of the crown she did not interest him in the least.</p>

  <p>On the 12th of March the Lords were due in Edinburgh to purge themselves
  of the crime of <i>Lèse Majesté</i>. Darnley had new grievances against his
  wife; she had had an iron stamp made with his signature so that she need not
  show him State papers and she would not settle his revenues; the Lords were
  conferring with Cecil and agreeing that there must he a blow at 'the root of
  things'&mdash;David Rizzio; Lennox did his worst to inflame his son against
  the Italian who was rumoured to be going to receive the Chancellorship taken
  from Morton, Moray's friend.</p>

  <p>Even the French envoy sent to her kin in France scandalous stories of her
  conduct, and Randolph committed himself to the statement that her coming
  child, if male, would be 'a son of David'. As it was obviously not to the
  interest of the Lennox faction that this child should be a son of David,
  Darnley must have believed this tale; the husband of a year's standing was
  prepared to repudiate his wife's infant. He entered into a 'Bond' or 'Band'
  in which he gave as reason for conspiring against Mary his conviction that
  Rizzio was her lover. Those with whom Darnley made this Band were the
  rebellious Lords, the men whom he had the most cause to fear and hate. As the
  price for murdering Rizzio the group were to be pardoned; they were also to
  assist Darnley to the crown matrimonial. The Band was signed on March 1st and
  a week later the English envoys (Bedford, Governor of Berwick, had joined
  Randolph) knew of it and reported it to England, together with the reports
  that Mary's affair with the Italian was common property and was not held as
  any ordinary lapse, since the circumstances were considered atrocious. The
  unrestrained passion for Darnley, indulged regardless of prudence, followed
  by such a swift revulsion and a <i>liaison</i> flaunted before Scotland was
  held to be behaviour beyond pardon. Nor was it to go unpunished. Rizzio was
  to be slain in Mary's presence in the hope that both she and her child might
  perish from the shock, or she, if she survived, be for ever shamed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the festivities at Holyrood were enlivened by the marriage of
  Bothwell with Jane Gordon, sister to the Earl of Huntly newly taken into
  favour by Mary, and to John Gordon, hacked to death by Mary's orders and in
  her presence at Inverness. Huntly had turned Protestant but Jane Gordon
  remained a Catholic, and the marriage took place in the old church of
  Holyrood, in the Canongate, then used by the Protestants, for Bothwell would
  not stomach the mass in the royal chapel. The Queen had made the match and
  she gave the twenty-year-old bride, whose family she had ruined, a handsome
  wedding gown. Bothwell, who had had so many amorous entanglements, was a
  little, at least, in love with Jane Gordon; she cared nothing for display and
  wrote poetry.</p>

  <p>Rizzio, while ignorant of the Band formed against him, was yet nervous. He
  stayed very late in the Queen's closet and sometimes passed the night, for
  safety's sake, in 'the outer closet' so that he did not have to go through
  the gardens after dark to his own wing. Sometimes he slept in his brother
  Guiseppe's cabinet, sometimes in his own. He had back doors, back windows and
  staircases always open ready for an escape. But he abated nothing of his
  insolence and Mary nothing of her favouritism. It was estimated that she had
  given him twenty thousand pounds' worth of jewels, clothes and gold. The
  Lords began to be suspicious of Darnley; he was too immature, violent and
  fickle for their liking They drew up another Band, in order to protect
  themselves against a youth they despised. With a keen insight into character
  they believed that Darnley might be, after the murder, won by Mary's
  blandishments to betray them, his fellow conspirators, and this second Band
  that they induced Darnley to sign was an undertaking on his part to protect
  and stand by them if the conspiracy was discovered, or, after the murder had
  been accomplished.</p>

  <p>Darnley wished to have Rizzio slain in his wife's presence and this was
  decided upon, though the Lords thought the proceeding brutal. Darnley drew up
  the plan of the murder and the second Band was signed March 1st (1565). Mary
  had for some time suspected that there was some mischief afoot and had tried
  to coax the truth out of Darnley, but her husband had resisted her 'subtle
  means' and daily urged on Lord Ruthven, always Mary's enemy and one of the
  chief conspirators, to take action. He added the threat that if Rizzio was
  not soon disposed of he, Darnley, would slay him himself, even in the Queen's
  chamber.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Randolph was not in Edinburgh at this crisis, having been banished to
  Berwick, where he had joined Bedford, Governor of that town, for his secret
  dealings with the banished Lords.</p>

  <p>On March 9th (1565) Mary was seated at supper with a party of friends in
  the small closet next to her bedroom. This closet is in one of the
  <i>tourelles</i> of the north-west tower, that overlooking the park; the
  closet in the other <i>tourelle</i> served as a dressing room. The tower
  itself formed the bedroom; beyond was the audience chamber where the Queen
  had received John Knox, and beyond that the galley, or <i>enfilade</i> rooms,
  leading to the entrance to the chapel royal. Part of this chamber is in the
  main building and gives into a lobby that has an entrance into the inner
  courtyard. Immediately below these rooms were those occupied by Darnley;
  these communicated with the bedchamber of the Queen by means of a private
  well staircase. The supping closet is about twelve feet by twelve, or was
  then. The staircase could easily be defended by one person, as it was not
  possible for a full-grown, armed man to use it when in an upright position.
  The Queen and her friends therefore felt secure and the door to the bedroom
  and the little door to the staircase were not bolted. Supper was served on a
  flap table held to the wall. Candles were lit. The guests were Jane Stewart
  (who had recently divorced her husband, Archibald, Earl of Argyll), Robert
  Stewart, her brother and half-brother to the Queen, Arthur Erskine of Grange,
  considered by Knox 'the most pestilent Papist in the realm', who was Master
  of Mary's household, the Lord High Steward, Robert Beaton, Earl of Creich and
  David Rizzio. These six people almost filled the closet.</p>

  <p>Darnley entered the bedroom by the private staircase, came into the closet
  and took a seat beside his wife. Immediately behind him came Lord Ruthven, a
  sick man, but in armour and carrying a drawn sword. On the Queen's demanding
  his errand, he replied that no harm was intended to her but only to 'that
  poltroon David'. Mary asked what was the Italian's fault and Ruthven referred
  her to her husband, but Darnley merely said: 'I know nothing of the
  matter.'</p>

  <p>The three men at Mary's table rose and advanced on Ruthven, but he held
  them off with his sword, while Mary spread out her skirts and stood in front
  of David, who hid behind her. But Darnley, putting his arms round her waist,
  dragged her aside and the conspirators, who had pressed into the closet from
  the bedroom, seized the shrieking Italian and forced him through the audience
  room into the lobby. They had intended to hang him publicly, but once he was
  in their power they could not restrain their violence and stabbed him to
  death. After he had been dispatched with fifty-six wounds they threw him out
  of the lobby window into the courtyard. The porter took the body into his
  lodge, stripped it and laid it on a chest, remarking: 'This was his first bed
  when he came here and here he lies again, a very ingrate and misknowing
  knave.'</p>

  <p>The Queen sent a chamber woman to inquire what had become of Rizzio, and
  on learning that he was dead, and that the messenger had seen him dead, she
  ceased sobbing and said: 'No more tears; I shall think upon revenge.' After
  this she became calm.</p>

  <p>There were twenty conspirators, all of whom had helped in the murder.
  Morton, who had been in Mary's confidence, but who was Moray's man, and
  Lindsay held the gates of Holyrood with five hundred followers and the Queen
  was in considerable danger of arrest, or of her life. Some of her supporters,
  including Bothwell, Huntly, Atholl, Caithness and Sutherland, hearing the
  tumult, rushed out, and engaged in skirmishes with Morton's men in the
  courtyard. They were first beaten off, then spoken fair. At a meeting in
  Bothwell's rooms in the Palace Ruthven talked over these Queen's men,
  assuring them that the murder was by the King's (Darnley's) command and that
  the banished Lords would be in Edinburgh by daybreak. Bothwell and Huntly,
  however, did not feel secure, and as soon as Ruthven had left them escaped by
  a low window from the Palace and fled through the garden.</p>

  <p>By now the city had been roused. The alarm bell was ringing, and a crowd
  of armed men, the Provost leading them, came to the Palace outer court by
  flambeau light. Without giving Mary a chance to appeal for help Darnley
  appeared at one of the windows and bid the crowd disperse, adding that he and
  the Queen were both safe. Ruthven returned to the Queen's chamber and found
  her still bitterly quarrelling with her husband. She was already exaggerating
  the atrocity of the deed, declaring that a pistol had been thrust into her
  side and that the daggers intended for Rizzio had passed over her shoulder
  and even been held at her throat. She added that if she or her child perished
  Ruthven should answer for it, and asked the ferocious noble why he conspired
  with Moray, who was his enemy, then reminded him that he, Ruthven, had once
  given her a diamond that was an antidote against poison, yet now he would
  have her life another way. Ruthven took this up, remarking that he did not
  believe in magic and the ring had been merely to quiet the Queen's fears. He
  noticed that Mary was 'weary' and drew away 'the King and all his
  company'.</p>

  <p>Before her husband left her Mary asked him where his dagger was; he
  answered he did not know. It was sticking in David Rizzio's side. This dagger
  was that beautiful and costly weapon with the sapphire in the head, listed in
  Mary's inventory as once belonging to her father.</p>

  <p>After a restless night Darnley again went to his wife's room and the
  fierce recriminations began again 'one grating on the other for two hours'.
  It was Sunday morning. Darnley sent his proclamations dispersing the Lords
  gathered for the Parliament, to be read at the Mercat Cross, and soon after
  Moray and 'the banished Lords' arrived at Holyrood, where he received them
  thankfully. Mary greeted Moray with affection; he was moved by her forlorn
  position and excused himself from any knowledge of the murder of Rizzio. The
  conspirators feared the Queen might try to escape from the Palace as many
  women were passing in and out. To satisfy them Darnley ordered that no one
  was to leave Holyrood muffled or masked.</p>

  <p>During that Sunday the high words between Darnley and his wife ceased;
  they were shut in her chamber and the Lords feared a reconciliation between
  the royal pair. When Darnley appeared the Lords warned him to be careful as
  to 'what action' he took; and in order to keep a watch on him Ruthven slept
  in the King's closet. Mary was expecting her husband in her chamber but he
  fell heavily asleep until six o'clock on the Monday morning. He then went up
  to the Queen's room, where he found her on her bed, feigning sleep. When she
  roused he pleaded for the pardon of the banished Lords. As he had dissolved
  Parliament they could not appear to answer the charge of treason on March
  12th. Mary seemed to be placated and even to have forgotten the murder of
  Rizzio. Darnley went out into the audience chamber and very merrily told his
  fellow conspirators this good news, but they reminded him that Mary had been
  bred in the French Court and was well versed in affairs of intrigue. Darnley
  then returned to his wife and argued with her for another two hours; when he
  left her he blithely assured Ruthven and Lindsay 'that all was well and the
  Queen would forgive them'. They were still unsatisfied and the bickerings
  continued until dinner-time, when Mary sent for her doctor and midwife. Both
  told Darnley that his wife would have a miscarriage unless moved to fresher
  air. The Lords dismissed this as a trick, but Darnley swore that Mary was 'a
  true princess' and that he would stake his life on her keeping her word.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon Darnley took Moray, Morton and Ruthven into the Queen's
  audience room. She received them graciously and said she would give them all
  the security they asked for, adding that she was 'never blood thirsty or
  greedy'. She took Moray by an arm, and Darnley by an arm, and walked up and
  down the room while the articles pardoning the Lords were engrossed for her
  signature. Ruthven was disgusted. He repeatedly told Darnley that it was all
  a deceit and that Mary meant to escape, taking her husband with her. Darnley
  as repeatedly offered his word that he and his wife were to be trusted. The
  conspirators, Ruthven still protesting, left Holyrood for Earl Morton's
  house, where they had supper. When they had eaten they sent Archibald Douglas
  back to the Palace to ask if Mary had signed the articles. Darnley replied
  that she had gone to bed, feeling unwell, and would sign in the morning.</p>

  <p>Mary then sent for Maitland and asked that the guards might be removed.
  Always courteous and considerate, he obeyed. Mary attired herself in a riding
  habit and met Darnley in her antechamber. She had already persuaded him that
  the conspirators were really his enemies and that his sole hope lay with her;
  she now reminded him again of the hatred and likely vengeance of Moray, and
  Darnley urged their instant flight. He had already arranged with Arthur
  Erskine, the Captain of the Guard, to have horses at the postern gate of the
  Palace. There husband and wife hastened through the darkened corridors and
  the wine cellar, passing through the vaults of the chapel royal and the
  graveyard where Rizzio had been hastily interred. It was a cold but calm
  night. Two horses were waiting. Captain Erskine rode one, with the Queen
  mounted behind him holding on to his leather belt, while Darnley mounted the
  other.</p>

  <p>The party of three rode for five hours across country, past the sands of
  Leith, along the coast to Musselburgh, then inland to Haddington and then on
  to Dunbar on the coast. Mary and her husband went directly to the Castle, one
  of the most strongly fortified in Scotland. She was ill and exhausted, yet
  had already written a cool account of Rizzio's murder to Archbishop Beaton,
  her ambassador in Paris and her loyal friend, and to Charles IX and Catherine
  de Medici. This skilful account was for publication, intended to put her own
  case and to cast odium on the Lords. She enlivened it with personal
  touches&mdash;Lady Argyll snatched up a candle, the supper fell when the flap
  table was knocked down. She wrote without seeming emotion in a collected
  manner as she emphasized the danger that she and her child had been in. She
  did not even hint at any indiscretion of her own that might have hastened the
  doom of David Rizzio. Well she knew how to put a gloss on the behaviour that
  had provoked the murder. Ruthven, a dying man, wrote another account of the
  death of the Italian contradicting Mary in many details, while in Holyrood
  the servants were trying to rub the bloodstains out of the floor boards in
  the antechamber.</p>

  <p>Once safely in Dunbar, Mary behaved as Ruthven had predicted: she threw
  off the disguise with which she had gained sufficient time to win over her
  husband and issued a ban of fire and sword against Morton, Lindsay, Ruthven
  and their accomplices. She called her subjects to arms and ordered them to
  gather at Haddington, and sent to the Captain of Edinburgh Castle to close
  the town unless the Lords departed. The conspirators fled into England. John
  Knox, heartily approving of the murder of Rizzio, departed into Ayrshire.
  Lord Semphill, who had hurried to Dunbar with the unsigned articles, was
  dismissed without the Queen's signature.</p>

  <p>It was not Darnley alone who had contrived the difficult escape from
  Holyrood. Bothwell and his brother-in-law Huntly had had a hand in it. Mary
  was deeply grateful, particularly to Bothwell. She wrote to Archbishop Beaton
  of his boldness and resource; she would, she declared, never forget this
  service. Bothwell, excellent at escapes, had promised to get Mary out of
  Holyrood, if he had to lower her out of a window with ropes and a basket.</p>

  <p>The Queen remained five days in the great fortress of Dunbar and increased
  her influence over her husband, using adroit cajoleries; 'he [Darnley] is
  known to be a fool', Randolph had written. She persuaded him to swear that he
  had known nothing of the Rizzio murder. This was to save her honour, which
  would have been tarnished had it been publicly believed that her husband had
  thought she had a lover; she wished the crime to have a political colour
  only. By this betrayal of the Lords, who possessed his two Bands, one for the
  murder, the other to hold them scatheless, Darnley inevitably decided his own
  fate.</p>

  <p>On her return to Edinburgh Mary did not go back to the bloodstained rooms
  of Holyrood but lodged at the Earl of Home's house, lately owned by the
  Bishop of Dunkeld, in the High Street, near the Salt Tron. She had many
  thousand armed men with her, the result of her call to muster at Haddington.
  Her position was now triumphant; with skill and boldness she consolidated her
  success. The Lords had departed from Edinburgh, there being no one to hear
  them when they came to answer to the charge of treason on March 12th. Many
  detached themselves from the conspirators. She pardoned Morton and Argyll on
  condition they kept from the Court; she was gracious to Moray and asked his
  help against the murderers&mdash;which he refused to give; she was friendly
  towards Maitland, who had connived at the crime but also at her escape from
  Holyrood; she kept on good terms with as many of the neutral Lords as she
  could and she persuaded her husband to issue a proclamation in which he vowed
  'on his honour, fidelity and word of a prince' that he knew nothing of 'any
  part of the late treasonable conspiracy, whereof he is slanderously accused'.
  Mary felt that her honour was saved by this championship; the conspirators
  retorted by sending her copies of the two Bands that Darnley had signed. She
  remained cool and pleasant; she was acting as Ruthven had advised: 'The more
  Your Grace shall show yourself offended, the world will judge the worst.'
  Mary did not appear offended.</p>

  <p>The Queen was resolved to save the appearances of which hitherto she had
  been so reckless and to safeguard the birthright of her child. She affected
  to be on cordial terms with her husband and to regard the Rizzio murder as a
  purely political affair, but she had his body removed secretly to the
  interior, where it was reinterred between the tombs of her father and his
  first wife, Magdalene de Valois. This was speedily known in Edinburgh and
  increased the scandal that, despite Darnley's declaration, gathered round the
  Queen. Her one-time tutor, George Buchanan, joined the most vehement of her
  detractors. Captain Carew, the English secret agent, reported the affair to
  Randolph and Bedford in Berwick. Randolph, sending a dispatch to London based
  on Carew's report, mentioned the base and foolish treachery of Darnley, who
  had 'utterly forsaken' his fellow conspirators, even giving the Queen a list
  of their names, among them that of Maitland. Mary had ordered him to
  Inverness and given his lands to Bothwell, Randolph wrote; he added details,
  picked up in Edinburgh, that helped to tarnish Mary's credit. The chamber of
  the murdered man had been raided and found to be packed with the Queen's
  gifts; gossip said two thousand pounds in gold had been discovered, much
  armour, twenty-two swords and fourteen pairs of velvet hose; there were many
  jewels that he had worn 'hanging about his neck'. Carew had reported that
  when the Italian was murdered he was wearing a damask nightgown, furred (a
  chamber robe), a satin doublet and hose of russet velvet. Soon after Randolph
  wrote this letter from Berwick, Ruthven, having given his own long account of
  the murder, died (in the Border town) of the internal inflammation that had
  long afflicted him.</p>

  <p>Persistently trying to save her honour, Mary had written from Dunbar a
  bold letter to Elizabeth, describing the murder of 'our most special servant'
  and her own dangers and fatigues. This letter was, in fact, a warning that
  Mary would not tolerate any further English support of her rebellious
  subjects. Elizabeth did not wish to do this; she thought the Scots were
  showing an evil example in their constant rebellions and she expressed
  disgust at the murder. If she had been in Mary's place, she declared, she
  would have snatched Darnley's dagger and 'used it on him'</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was herself vexed by many troubles and in bad health; she was
  still debating the question of her marriage and much concerned at the rumour
  of a Catholic League to stamp out Protestantism which she feared Mary had
  joined. Guided by Cecil, her policy was still 'fast and loose'. Bedford
  reported that Mary, seeing a picture of Elizabeth in Edinburgh and being told
  it was the Queen of England, had answered 'No&mdash;I am the Queen of
  England.' The position between the two women was what it had been when Mary
  had quartered the English arms; jealousy, mistrust, dislike raged between
  them under cover of fair words and diplomatic courtesies.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's fears were not groundless. If there was no Catholic League,
  Pius V was anxious to form one. Mary sent the Bishop of Dunblane to Rome; the
  Cardinal of Lorraine sent an envoy to Scotland; one Italian Bishop suggested
  a massacre of all the Scottish Protestants; the Pope sent Mary twenty
  thousand crowns with words of praise. On Elizabeth's side were more
  sympathetic compliments and another courtier, Sir Robert Melville, to bring
  Mary assurances of the English Queen's countenance and friendship Ignoring
  ugly gossip, Elizabeth took a dignified tone and supported the woman she
  affected to regard as outraged by sending warnings both to Darnley and Moray
  to be circumspect in their dealings with their sovereign lady. Mary sent a
  grateful letter to Elizabeth April 4th (1565) and kept up appearances with
  Darnley. But Bothwell was 'all in all' at her Court, and on April 29th she
  made Rizzio's brother, Guiseppe, her private secretary. But she showed some
  prudence; she declined the Italian scheme for a massacre of the Protestants
  and she went through a form of reconciliation with Moray, the strong, cool,
  able counsellor. She wished to have him, as well as her husband, on her side
  at the birth of her child.</p>

  <p>The places associated with the movements of Mary at this crisis are, after
  Holyrood, Dunbar, where the once massive Castle is a ruin; Seton, a small
  town and port not far from Preston Pans where Mary paused to change horses on
  her flight; and Haddington, where her lieges mustered after her call from
  Dunbar. Haddington, the native town of John Knox, was chiefly known for the
  ancient Franciscan monastery and church, once named 'the lamp of Lothian'. A
  comfortable market town, in the midst of pleasant country, Haddington is
  somewhat featureless. Near is Lennoxlove, once Maitland's early home; the
  background of the town is formed by the southern declines of the Lammermuirs
  and the northern range of the Garleton hills. Though the route is not, in
  itself, of any particular interest it is an unusual journey to follow Mary's
  flight from Edinburgh to Leith, then to Musselburgh, and on to Seton, to
  Haddington and thence to Dunbar.</p>

  <p>As the birth of her child approached Mary retreated into the fastness of
  Edinburgh Castle. This was the traditional stronghold of whoever felt in
  danger in the town and had been, when Mary went there, for long the most
  famous of the many famous rock castles in Scotland. It had been in existence
  when Dunfermline was the chief royal residence, and, among many sieges,
  assaults, crimes, treacheries, murders, escapes, imprisonments, burnings and
  torturings, there was at least one pleasant memory attached to the fortress
  on the rock: that of Margaret, wife of Malcolm Canmore, Queen and Saint, who
  died here and whose chapel still remains, the most ancient portion of this
  medley of buildings.</p>

  <p>Mary, in her mule litter, went up the winding road, across the drawbridge,
  under the raised portcullis, past the small yet massive chapel of the royal
  saint, past the terraces with the batteries and the guard rooms into the
  state apartments. She occupied two of these, an outer room or audience
  chamber, and a small bedchamber, for safety's sake no larger than a closet,
  There were other and more splendid rooms in the Castle, notably those that
  had been embellished for the use of Margaret Tudor Mary's grandmother,
  through whom her claim to the English crown rested. These are still intact;
  nor is it difficult to ignore later alterations, additions and restorations
  and to imagine the Castle as it was when Mary took refuge there in the summer
  of 1566. She could, when taking her exercise on rampart or terrace, look down
  as we can look down on the tall houses, then gabled and red tiled, on the
  squalid narrow alleys, the High Street where she had lately lodged herself,
  running from the Lawnmarket to the Canongate, to Holyrood, where Rizzio was
  slain and now lay buried, 'almost in the arms of Magdalene de Valois'. Mary
  could look upon the West Bow, by the Lawn-market, to the Netherbow, to the
  house where John Knox lodged, to the closes and Wynds, the mansions of the
  nobles, the Palace of Mary of Guise, St. Giles, with booths built round the
  walls, the Tolbooth, Parliament House and Prison, the Mercat Cross, where
  Darnley's proclamation, made at Mary's request, had stamped him as a liar and
  announced his doom; the huddle of shops, stalls, the causeways raised above
  the open gutters of the streets, and, here and there, ruins of monasteries,
  splendid but yesterday.</p>

  <p>This view is little changed if the observer keeps his gaze on what was
  then the one street of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Mary looked forward with foreboding to the birth of her child. She had not
  only survived the tragedy of March 9th; she had, by detaching Darnley from
  his fellows; turned the tables on her enemies and, by a belated prudence, had
  silenced, if she had not killed, scandal that might have been fatal to her
  position as Queen and woman. But she was melancholy and low in health. Seated
  in the little closet under a ceiling yet intact, she wrote out her will in
  careful detail.</p>

  <p>Darnley was remembered&mdash;most poignantly&mdash;in the red ring with
  which he had married her; a gift from Rizzio to herself, a tortoise formed of
  rubies, was for his brother; there were legacies for the Cardinal of Lorraine
  and her French relatives; for the Marys, still her friends, two married and
  one betrothed to Maitland; to Darnley's parents; to Huntly and to
  Bothwell.</p>

  <p>On June 9th (1566) Mary was delivered of a son. At two o'clock the next
  day Darnley visited her; she showed him the child before witnesses and swore
  that he was his son and 'no other man's'. This desperate declaration she
  repeated, referring to the near escape of herself and the boy at the murder
  of Rizzio. Darnley put this aside impatiently, and Mary said again that the
  boy was so much Darnley's son that she feared it would be the worse for him
  hereafter. Her husband did not publicly accept her vows but he afterwards
  wrote to the Cardinal of Lorraine announcing the birth without any hint of
  scandal&mdash;although there were few in Scotland who did not doubt the
  paternity of the child. Mary suffered greatly during childbirth, but never
  forgot her ambition&mdash;the infant was to her the Prince who would 'unite
  the two crowns'. She sent James Melville to Elizabeth with the news of the
  heir and an appeal for the recognition of his claims. After a jealous
  outburst the English Queen calmly stated that she would probably marry
  herself, the Archduke Charles she believed, once more dashing Mary's hopes.
  She would not acknowledge the child as second heir to her throne but she
  consented to be godmother, and wrote to congratulate Mary, adding, however,
  in the same letter complaints of the English and Irish rebels Mary was
  harbouring in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Mary's position was not improved by the birth of her son. She still could
  not flatter Elizabeth into granting her desire; she still could not obtain
  the foreign aid with which to dethrone Elizabeth; Darnley, though won over,
  was unaccountable and unreliable; Moray and Maitland, though outwardly
  friendly, were no longer in her confidence or her service; many of the Lords
  were estranged; many were hostile; Knox continued to be her ferocious enemy;
  John Craig, his deputy in Edinburgh, was the same type of iron
  Protestant.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's envoy waited on Mary in the Castle and saw the five-day-old
  child, healthy and 'goodly'. Mary, however, was pale and weak with a hollow
  cough and spoke faintly soon after she returned to the newly cleansed rooms
  at Holyrood. Bedford reported that Bothwell, the most hated man in Scotland
  and so insolent that he was loathed more than Rizzio had ever been, then
  'carried all the credit' at the Court.</p>

  <p>The prudence that Mary had shown when she beguiled her husband into
  countenancing her soon vanished. Not only was there the reckless favour shown
  to Bothwell&mdash;she easily fell into a trap set by Cecil. A man she
  supposed an English rebel, one Christopher Rokesby, was in truth one of
  Cecil's spies. He gained Mary's confidence and in the headlong fashion that
  went oddly beside her cunning she confided to him her heart's dearest
  desire&mdash;her hopes of the English throne. To gain this end she would stir
  up mischief in Ireland and among the Roman Catholics in England. She ran over
  the names of her potential allies: Norfolk, Derby, Westmorland, Shrewsbury,
  Northumberland and Cumberland. She asked Rokesby for other likely names and
  disclosed to him her plans for an invasion of England and seizure of the
  throne. She added that her astrologers had told her that Elizabeth would not
  outlive the year. Rokesby sent an account of these rash confidences to Cecil
  and added that Bothwell was the man deepest in Mary's secrets. Elizabeth saw
  the report but made no outward change in her prudent behaviour and secret
  policy towards Mary.</p>

  <p>Mary stayed only briefly at Holyrood. She had left Edinburgh Castle before
  'her month was over' and her child also&mdash;he was placed with a wet-nurse
  in the care of the Earl of Mar, Governor of Edinburgh Castle&mdash;and Mary,
  as soon as she had settled her household in Holyrood, went on a visit to
  Alloa, the seat of this faithful and worthy nobleman. She was taken in a
  small sailing vessel manned by some of Bothwell's men, from Newhaven, up the
  Firth to Alloa. She went on this diversion with the better heart as she had
  drawn Moray into her circle again, offered to give him her confidence, and
  she believed that she could rely on the steady support of this once trusty
  counsellor. She was not concerned at Darnley's jealousy, now as fiercely
  directed against Moray as it had ever been directed against Rizzio. As soon
  as Mary left the Castle her little room was painted with the arms of Scotland
  and a verse appealing to the Almighty to allow the infant who had been born
  there to reign long in the land.</p>

  <p>Alloa now has no trace of the agreeable seat in rich country that Mary
  visited; the house of the Earls of Mar where she stayed is a ruin, but the
  modern mansion of the present holder of the title is near. In this clean air
  Mary lost her cough and recovered her colour; her melancholy vanished with
  her pallor and her languor and she threw herself again into those merriments
  so loathed by the Puritans, for Mar's household provided masks, pageants and
  sports for his royal guest. Darnley followed her, riding by way of Stirling,
  but was so coldly received that he stayed for a few hours only. The
  combination now was Bothwell and Darnley against Moray. Mary having used her
  husband to help her escape from Holyrood and to acknowledge her child,
  troubled no longer to please him. Darnley and the small Lennox faction were
  rapidly becoming isolated; he had outraged or offended almost everyone. The
  conspirators were gradually slipping back into Edinburgh. Moray, who knew
  everything, had the Queen's ear; Darnley's fear and hatred of this man was
  fanned by Bothwell, always ready for mischief.</p>

  <p>Early in August Mary returned to Holyrood. Darnley broke out against Moray
  and threatened to murder him as he had murdered Rizzio. Mary humiliated him
  by forcing him to ask Moray's pardon for the rash threat, then went on a
  hunting tour to Megotland, with Moray, Bothwell and Mar. Afterwards she
  joined Darnley at Traquair, where her cool and disdainful conduct towards him
  was noted, and by September she was again in Holyrood. In these journeys Mary
  visited some Scots places for the first time. Megotland, or Megget, was
  afterwards annexed to Lyne. Negath water falls into St. Mary's Loch. Some
  distance up the valley stood the Castle of Gramalt, where Mary stayed; it was
  a large hunting lodge with a tower, but the inhabitants of Peebleshire had
  been too free with their poaching and Mary found there was lack of game and
  poor sport. On August 19th she was still writing from Gramond, and arranging
  for her son to be brought to Stirling for his baptism.</p>

  <p>One of her first acts after returning to the capital was to send for
  Maitland, with whom she was speedily reconciled. Both Bothwell and Moray were
  at once jealous of the renewed ascendancy of this cool and intelligent
  statesman. In spite of this able man's addition to her Councils Mary returned
  to her former indiscretions. She treated Darnley coolly and showed a daily
  increasing favour to Bothwell; she constantly repaired to her Exchequer
  House, close to the Cowgate, and even lodged there for the purpose of
  arranging her revenues and those her son would require for his newly
  appointed household. Darnley meanwhile had very little money or goods, nor
  could he induce Mary to settle his affairs. Her withdrawal into the 'checker
  house' caused a considerable increase in the scandal that had darkened her
  name since she first had taken Rizzio into favour. It was believed that
  Bothwell had access to the Exchequer House through the dwelling next door,
  put at his disposal by a former mistress, and that in this manner he was able
  to be with the Queen privately whenever he wished. This behaviour was held to
  be the more inexcusable since Mary had issued from Stirling (August 31st,
  1566) a Proclamation ordering the magistrates of Edinburgh to search out and
  punish without exception all those guilty of 'adultery, fornication, open
  harlotry and other such lusts of the flesh'.</p>

  <p>A further cause of offence was the use of David Chalmers, Bothwell's man,
  of evil repute, at whose house Bothwell was living with his wife. Mary
  created this jackal and go-between who 'served Bothwell in his naughty
  practices and pleasures' Common Clerk of Edinburgh and then a Lord of
  State.</p>

  <p>By October Darnley had broken into open defiance of his wife. Mary's
  advisers drew up a skilful <i>apologia</i> for their mistress that they sent
  to Catherine de Medici. This was an attempt to hush up scandal and to lay all
  the blame for Mary's domestic troubles on the intolerable behaviour of her
  husband. But it was difficult, even for Moray and Maitland, to save the
  reputation of a woman so reckless and headstrong as the Queen. She, however,
  was alarmed at Darnley's suddenly expressed resolution to leave Scotland; if
  he did so it would mean a repudiation of the paternity of her child, and when
  she received a letter from Lennox, written at Glasgow, his son being at
  Stirling, telling her of this decision, and adding there was a ship ready to
  take Darnley beyond the seas, she took the letter in alarm to her
  Council.</p>

  <p>All her advisers pretended to be much shocked and surprised at Darnley's
  threat. They knew perfectly well, however, that not only was Darnley in a
  wretched, almost penniless position, without support or credit, but that he
  was in grave peril from the vengeance of the conspirators he had betrayed.
  That same evening Darnley arrived in Edinburgh, but refused to enter
  Holyrood. Mary went to the courtyard to receive him graciously and conducted
  him to her apartments; where he remained all night. In the morning some of
  the Lords, and the French ambassador, waited on him and added their
  flatteries and blandishments to those of the Queen. Dwelling on the beauty,
  wisdom and virtue of Mary, they tried to persuade her husband that he was
  extremely ill-advised to abandon such a wife and so noble a realm. Darnley,
  however, was not persuaded. He left Holyrood for Stirling and from there sent
  Mary a letter of trivial complaints. Mary retorted by stating that it was not
  her fault if he was neither honoured nor advanced and by reminding him that
  she had been very generous in forgiving him for the murder of Rizzio.</p>

  <p>Both Moray and the Lords took a serious view of the position. Mary, always
  adroit and bold when in danger, helped them to try to save her credit. The
  letter to Catherine de Medici was her case, as she wished it to be put before
  Europe; both she and her advisers thought that Darnley's withdrawal from
  Scotland was intended to shame her before the world. Darnley, the French
  Ambassador had observed, was in 'a sort Of desperation' and might do
  anything. He sulked at Stirling, and news arrived in Edinburgh daily that he
  'held to his resolution' of leaving the country.</p>

  <p>Mary's health, which had been so improved by the visits to Alloa and
  Peebleshire, now began to fail. Her old complaint, a pain in the side,
  troubled her, and she was pale and thin; the bloom and freshness had already
  gone from her beauty but the seductive charm remained. She prudently sent
  Bothwell to check affrays on the Border. He took up his residence in
  Hermitage Castle while Mary went to Jedburgh to preside at a Border session;
  between them they were 'to ride the Border'.</p>

  <p>Jedburgh, then the chief town of the Border, is an ancient royal burgh,
  lying in a hollow of the hills on the banks of the Jed Water; it constantly
  changed hands, from the Scots to the English, and back again. The magnificent
  Augustinian Abbey of red sandstone was sacked by Henry VIII's troops and in
  Mary's time was a ruin; today it still can show some splendid doors and
  windows. It has royal memories. Here was married for the second time
  Alexander III, the wedding feast being spoilt by a spectre who drifted among
  the guests warning them of the approaching death of the bridegroom. Jedburgh
  once possessed a castle; that has disappeared. Mary did not reside there but
  in a house standing off the High Street, still known as Queen Mary's
  House.</p>

  <p>It is a fine mansion with massive walls and towers, in the midst of one of
  the orchards for which the neighbourhood is famous. Mary was lodged in a
  small room, part of a suite occupied by her household.</p>

  <p>Her enemies thought that the Border sessions was but an excuse for the
  Queen to be near Bothwell; but thirty miles separates Jedburgh from Hermitage
  Castle.</p>

  <p>Jedburgh is celebrated not only for the pleasant orchards but for the
  forest that once surrounded it for miles. 'Jedburgh Justice' (to hang a man,
  then try him) and 'a Jedburgh axe' were sayings that bore testimony to the
  bold and aggressive character of the Jedburgh men.</p>

  <p>When Mary had been a short while at Jedburgh news was brought her that
  Bothwell had been wounded in a skirmish with his old enemies, the Elliots,
  and was lying ill in Hermitage Castle. Under the excuse of wishing to consult
  him on Border affairs, Mary set out, eight days after receiving the news,
  with a small following that included Moray, across the wild moorland roads.
  She chose to go by Hawick, and then across country to Dod Burn. She then
  crossed Langside Burn, where her white horse nearly sank in a bog, rode over
  the wild Elliot country, Liddesdale, and arrived at Hermitage Castle,
  spattered with mud, exhausted but tenacious of her purpose.</p>

  <p>Castle Hermitage is still one of the loneliest and most sinister-looking
  ruins in Scotland. It was built to withstand the sieges and assaults so
  frequent in the Border, and the imposing architecture is peculiar; the walls
  are cut by arches and the gloomy pile overhangs Hermitage Water, crossed by
  drawbridges. The Lords of Soulis had once owned this grim fortress and one of
  them was a wizard of extreme cruelty and formidable power who frequently
  entertained 'auld Clootie' at Hermitage. For long he successfully defied the
  King but at last his outraged tenants took the Castle by storm, wrapped
  Soulis in lead and boiled him and his magic books together. This ceremony did
  not entirely rid Liddesdale of the infernal Lord; his familiar, named Redcap,
  for long haunted the spot where Soulis had been burnt and a circle of
  prehistoric stones on 'Name Stone Rig' is shown as the favourite ground of
  this malicious spectre who, by frightening away chance travellers, added to
  the loneliness of the solitude. Hermitage afterwards came into the hands of
  the Douglases, who darkened its reputation still more by many crimes; these
  included the starving to death in the deep dungeons of Sir Alexander Ramsay,
  Sheriff of Teviotdale.</p>

  <p>When Mary reached this mighty fortalice she learned that Bothwell had been
  thrice wounded: in the head, the side and the hand. Wasting no time with Lady
  Bothwell, she went into Bothwell's room. Though fatigued by the weather,
  which was stormy, the rough ride and her own agitation, Mary, after seeing
  for herself that Bothwell was out of danger, returned at once to Jedburgh.
  This was a ride of sixty miles in one day under considerable difficulties and
  stresses. As soon as she had regained her house Mary collapsed; the most
  severe of the many illnesses that had clouded her youth now threatened her
  life. It was a dangerous hysterical attack brought on by fatigue, vexation
  and an imperfect recovery from childbirth. An 'effusion of blood into the
  stomach' brought on alarming vomiting and subsequent exhaustion; she lay for
  so long in one of the death-like trances usual to her that she was believed
  to have no hope of life and the news of her probable decease was sent to
  Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Maitland and Moray began to impound her papers and her attendants to pack
  up her valuables; but Mary recovered to return at once to the cause of her
  chagrin&mdash;Darnley. She complained, with her first recovered feeble
  health, to Maitland about the base ingratitude of her husband, adding that it
  was a heartbreak for her to be tied to him, but 'how to be free of him, she
  saw no outgait'.</p>

  <p>After this statement she passed into another crisis of her illness and on
  the 25th October (1566) she appeared to be dead; her eyes closed, her teeth
  clenched, her body was stiff and cold. Her recovery was credited to the
  devotion and ability of her French physician. Darnley, though told of her
  desperate condition, remained with his hawks and hounds hunting on the Lennox
  estates at Glasgow. On October 21st Bothwell arrived in a horse litter at
  Jedburgh; he was fast recovering from his wounds and soon moved into the
  Queen's House, occupying rooms beneath Mary's, and when, on the 29th October,
  Darnley arrived he was coldly received and soon departed. A fire in Mary's
  residence forced her into other lodgings and ten days later she left Jedburgh
  and the pleasant orchards and travelled rapidly to Kelso, Werk, Hume, Langdon
  and Wedderburn, thence to Harldon Hill, Coldingham, Dunbar and Tantallon to
  Craigmillar, the journey taking twenty days. During this time she was in low
  spirits, constant pain and weakness; her physicians were always about her and
  those who advised her thought that her disease was, in the words of the
  French Ambassador, 'a deep grief and sorrow'.</p>

  <p>Darnley visited her at Craigmillar and was again coldly received. Mary,
  who had taken the Jedburgh illness meekly, now 'wished she were dead' in a
  mood of angry repining that nothing would solace. She was no longer absorbed
  in politics, no longer concerned even with her prospect of the English crown
  or the restoration of the Roman Catholic Faith. She was obsessed by the
  problem of Darnley. She wanted to get rid of him, but she did not want him to
  leave her; she was exasperated by his haughty manner; he would not humble
  himself. Whenever she saw him speak to anyone she imagined a plot; she could
  not forget the murder of Rizzio. Hearing rumours that Darnley had written
  abroad, putting his case before the Pope and France, she suggested a divorce
  to her advisers, but they told her that such a step might injure her son's
  heritage. A divorce would have been easy; it was only a question of obtaining
  a reversal of the Papal consent to a marriage that had been made within the
  prohibited degrees of kinship, but once Mary had understood that such an
  annulment would make her James illegitimate she refused even to consider the
  matter. At Jedburgh she had, during the convulsions of her illness, seen 'no
  way out'. Now, at Craigmillar, she had decided that a way must be found, cost
  what it might, save only her son's claim to the two crowns.</p>

  <p>Five of her one-time counsellors were gathered round her in that autumn of
  1566&mdash;Huntly, Argyll, Moray, Maitland and Bothwell; the Lords had to
  tolerate the last named as they could not separate him from the Queen's
  friendship. He had left Darnley and joined them because they were in the
  ascendancy; the Queen's husband, forsaken by all save his father's small
  party, had nothing to offer anyone.</p>

  <p>These five men had excellent reasons for wishing to get rid of Darnley,
  besides their desire to please the Queen. He was a person impossible to work
  with, since he was weak, false and suspicious; he was a stumbling-block to
  anyone who wished to influence the Queen and obtain power through her favour;
  he was a danger to the peace of the realm, since he would, though without
  followers, always cause as much mischief as possible; he was a danger to
  Mary's reputation, since he might deny the paternity of her son, and that of
  any other child she might have. For this reason it was most important that he
  did not leave Scotland; besides, the Lords, all of whom had at least connived
  at the murder of Rizzio, were determined on revenge for their betrayal in
  this affair.</p>

  <p>Maitland led the Queen on gently. He asked for a pardon for Morton,
  Lindsay and the other murderers and promised to find a means of divorcing
  Darnley without prejudice to her son. Mary still refusing this project,
  Maitland said that the Lords would find means to rid the Queen of her husband
  without damage to the child. He added that Moray, her political mainstay,
  would help him. Mary answered cautiously that the matter must abide God's
  good time, and that she desired them to do nothing by which any 'spot might
  be laid on her honour or conscience'. Maitland took this statement, coming
  from a woman who had so recklessly jeopardized her good name, for what it was
  worth, and assured his mistress that she might leave the disposal of Darnley
  to them, the Lords, that nothing but good would come out of their plans and
  that, in the end, they would be approved by Parliament.</p>

  <p>At Craigmillar, in the convenient position in the clean air, three miles
  south of Edinburgh, Mary waited for the preparation at Stirling for the
  baptism of her child. She was still in the hands of her physicians and in a
  despondent mood. The gay high spirits she had shown that summer at Alloa and,
  gossip said, in dancing round the Mercat Cross in male attire, had left her
  after the Border journey and the wild ride to Castle Hermitage. Elizabeth was
  obdurate, though friendly, on the question of the succession. There was no
  favourable response to the long and involved plea Mary had sent, after her
  severe illness, from Dunbar, for the recognition of herself and her son as
  heirs of England.</p>

  <p>The baptism, delayed in order that foreign envoys might be present, took
  place on December 12th at Stirling Castle and was part of the Christmas
  celebrations.</p>

  <p>The pageantry was splendid, the guests numerous and important. Mary
  exerted herself to play the charming hostess; all her graces were exquisitely
  displayed. She provided sumptuously for the entertainment of the crowds that
  thronged the Castle and the town and everything for the ceremony was superb
  and carefully devised by herself. Elizabeth sent Bedford, the Governor of
  Berwick, with a font of gold and jewels, weighing three hundred and thirty
  three ounces; the Countess of Argyll was her proxy as godmother, the winter
  journey from England being impossible for a woman, and the Duke of Savoy and
  Charles IX were godfathers. A dark side to the gorgeous entertainment was
  provided by the presence of the forsaken Darnley. He wore the collar of the
  Order of St. Michael lately sent to him by the King of France, but was
  slighted by everyone and passed most of his time in his apartments. The
  French ambassador saw Mary when she was not smiling at the public pageantry;
  in his private moments he found her 'weeping sore' and ill in bed, with the
  pain in her side gnawing at her strength. There were discordances also over
  the religious question, for the baptism took place according to Roman
  Catholic rites. Bedford would not enter the chapel and bribed the Countess of
  Argyll to take his place, for which she afterwards had to do penance Mary,
  though so eager to avoid any 'spot on her honour', appointed Bothwell to
  receive the ambassadors, though he was a staunch Protestant. Darnley, a Roman
  Catholic, refused to countenance the ceremony. Bothwell was among those she
  distinguished by gifts of gold-edged stuff, the others being those who had
  been at the Craigmillar Conference&mdash;Huntly, Moray, Maitland and Argyll.
  The festivities were marred by a dangerous disturbance. The English in
  Bedford's train were offended by a masque of satyrs; the tails of these
  creatures were taken as a Scots insult, since the English were supposed to
  have 'short tails, like stags'. These riots were with difficulty quieted by
  the Queen and Bedford.</p>

  <p>Shortly before the baptismal ceremony Mary had restored, illegally, the
  powers of the Archbishop of St. Andrews that had been for long in abeyance.
  He performed the rites that made the six-month-old infant, James Stewart, a
  member of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>

  <p>During the formal rejoicings Moray had his way; Mary signed the pardons of
  his friends, Morton, Lindsay and their accomplices in the Rizzio murder. As
  soon as he heard of this action, Darnley swiftly left Stirling and proceeded
  to the one place in Scotland where he felt secure, his father's Glasgow
  stronghold, while Mary, leaving Moray to represent her among the lingering
  guests, went to Castle Drummond, where she spent Christmas Day (1566).</p>

  <p>She employed her time in writing one of her skilful <i>apologias</i> to
  Archbishop Beaton in Paris, setting forth all her grievances against her
  husband. This letter crossed with one from Beaton warning her of rumours in
  France of some plot against her person, vague but alarming. Maitland's long
  courtship of Mary Fleming ended in his marriage to her this winter. Three of
  the Queen's Marys were now wed, Mary Livingstone to John, Master of Semphill,
  and Mary Beaton to Alexander Ogilvy of Boyne; the maiden Mary Seaton alone
  remained in attendance on Mary.</p>

  <p>The Lords entered into a Band for the removal of Darnley; as they had to
  work with Bothwell, because he was the Queen's favourite, though they loathed
  him as bitterly as they loathed their proposed victim, they resolved to make
  use of him. He was to do the dangerous part of the business and to bear the
  blame afterwards. Even if he escaped punishment, by reason of the Queen's
  friendship, the astute Lords felt sure he would soon ruin himself and
  probably Mary as well. The way would then be clear for a rule of Protestants
  with the infant James under a Regency.</p>

  <p>The Lords tried to obtain a sanction and safeguard from Mary as they had
  obtained one from Darnley in the case of the Rizzio murder, but she still
  held the attitude she had maintained at Craigmillar. She would have 'no spot
  upon her honour' and she refused to condone the proposed crime, but she
  received the news of the Band calmly and did not disclose its existence to
  anyone. She had known from the moment she had signed the pardon of the men
  Darnley had betrayed, and from whom he had fled to his father's fastness,
  that these deadly enemies meant to get rid of him&mdash;he was still the man
  of whom she passionately desired to be free.</p>

  <p>Every possible slight was put on Darnley; even his silver plate was
  changed for pewter and his retinue was diminished. Chagrined and passionately
  angry, the young man fell ill when on his way to Glasgow. The sickness was
  imputed to poison taken from the Queen's table, but when he reached Glasgow,
  where an epidemic of measles raged, his physicians stated his disease to be
  that disease or smallpox. Darnley was strong and healthy but he had not
  escaped the endemic maladies of his age; he suffered from tertian ague and
  soon after his first meeting with Mary she nursed him through a severe attack
  that was believed to be measles. At first Mary took no notice of the news of
  her husband's illness; but an apothecary was presently sent from Holyrood and
  later Mary wrote to Darnley suggesting a visit from herself. Darnley replied
  that she must do as she wished, adding that if he had been Bothwell and
  Glasgow the Hermitage, she would soon have been with him. Mary persisted in
  attempting what she termed a reconciliation with her husband, and she set
  out, through the winter weather, for Glasgow, Huntly and Bothwell riding with
  her as far as Callendar, near Falkirk Lennox was alarmed at the approach of
  the Queen, but ordered one of his gentlemen, Thomas Crauford of Gordonhill,
  to meet her in lieu of himself, as he was ill. On receiving her
  father-in-law's excuses, Mary remarked: 'There is no receipt against fear; if
  he were not culpable he would not be afraid.'</p>

  <p>The Glasgow that Mary entered was a small, pleasant town of many spires,
  red-tiled gabled houses and winding streets, surrounded by open fields. Not
  one trace of it remains. She went at once to the room where her husband lay
  sick&mdash;Darnley afterwards reported their conversation to Crauford in
  order that he might inform his father of the Queen's mood. Mary opened the
  quarrel by complaining of her husband's cruelty in threatening to leave the
  country; he retorted that she had provoked this threat and that her behaviour
  was the cause of his illness. He then showed much humility, pleaded his
  youth, asked pardon for past faults and begged for a reconciliation,
  concluding with the conventional flattery that all his errors had risen from
  love of herself. These were the arguments of a desperate, cornered man.
  Darnley was extremely ill; a thick eruption covered his body and a mask of
  silk (taffeta) concealed his disfigured face. Mary continued to bring up her
  grievances and they 'grated' on one another as they had after the murder of
  Rizzio, each accusing the other of plots. Darnley declared that he could not
  credit his wife had a part in the Craigmillar conspiracy and uttered the
  threat that if any tried violence against him they 'should buy it dear unless
  they took him sleeping'.</p>

  <p>Mary put off these attempts at reconciliation; she escaped from the
  noisome sick room as often as possible and retired to her own lodging, though
  the moody and suspicious invalid was constantly asking for her company. She
  spoke to him, finally, in a friendly fashion, and on his telling her that he
  had heard she had brought a litter with her, she replied that this was to
  take him back to Holyrood. Darnley protested that the weather was too cold
  for him to travel; she then suggested that she should go with him to
  Craigmillar, where they would be near to their son at Holyrood, James being
  in the charge of Moray's uncle, Lord Mar.</p>

  <p>Darnley pressed for the reconciliation before he left the safety of the
  Lennox stronghold but Mary, while promising everything for the future and
  declaring that if there had not been perfect peace between them she would not
  have come so far to fetch him, urged again his removal to Craigmillar where
  he might, by medicinal baths, be cleansed of his skin eruption. This done,
  she gave her hand and faith of her body that she would love him and use him
  as her husband'. She then probed him as to the cause of his jealousy but he
  evaded this, naming no man. Mary advised him to keep their reconciliation
  from the Lords; Darnley protested; she continued to upbraid him and to use
  blandishments, while not admitting any faults in herself.</p>

  <p>In the intervals between these interviews, which always covered the same
  ground, Darnley asked his confidential friend, Crauford, what he thought of
  the proposed journey to Edinburgh. Crauford did not like the project; he
  thought the lodging in Craigmillar odd, but Darnley, partly resigned, partly
  beguiled, decided to rely on his wife's promise. The alternative was an open
  breach between them, with himself on the losing side and in an even more
  wretched position than he had been 'took him more as a prisoner than her
  husband'. Darnley agreed, but resolved to put himself in her hands; she might
  cut his throat&mdash;but God would judge between them.</p>

  <p>On January 27th (1567) Mary and her train set out from the Lennox
  fastness, bearing Darnley in the litter she had brought from Holyrood. The
  weather was dark and cold. A halt was made at Callendar and then the party
  proceeded to the capital. Mary had changed her plan; Darnley was not taken to
  Craigmillar but to a house outside the walls of Edinburgh in the open ground
  known as Kirk O'Field, where the new mansion of the Hamiltons, scene of the
  meeting between Bothwell and Arran, stood. This mansion was then occupied by
  Archbishop Hamilton, who had been given illegal powers by Mary shortly
  before. The fields had once belonged to a Dominican monastery, whose
  buildings had been razed by the Reformers, and had formerly been an agreeable
  garden. The collegiate church of St. Mary, then ruined and deserted, gave the
  name to the field that abutted on the walls of a poor quarter of Edinburgh
  where stood some almshouses and wretched dwellings of such ill repute that
  this alley was named 'Thieves Row'.</p>

  <p>The house where Darnley was lodged was the one-time Prebendary and had
  recently been used by Canon Robert Balfour, whose brother, James, had drawn
  up the Band against Darnley. It was on the west side of the Provost's
  lodging. One facade faced the ruined cloisters, the other opened on to the
  town wall in which there was an entrance into 'Thieves Row'. There was a door
  in the house facing this and another on the opposite side leading into the
  quadrangle, so that it was possible to enter through the wall, into the
  house, cross the ground floor and out the other side into the field beyond
  where there was the new Hamilton Palace and the monastic ruins. The Hamiltons
  were enemies of the Lennox clan and when Darnley arrived in Kirk O'Field the
  Bishop had this house full of armed men.</p>

  <p>The old two-storeyed Prebendary was damp and in ill condition but had been
  splendidly furnished from Holyrood. Darnley had the first floor and a bed
  once belonging to Mary of Guise, of violet brown velvet lined with crimson.
  Tapestries were hung on the walls and many luxuries provided, but the key of
  one door was missing and another had to be taken from the hinges to serve as
  a cover for the royal bath. Darnley had a few English servants with him, but
  no retainers, friends or followers. His apartments, besides the bedroom, had
  a toilet closet and a <i>garde robe</i>. His bodyservant, named Taylor, slept
  in his room, three others in a closet on the same floor. Mary lodged in the
  ground-floor rooms, which could be entered from the city walls; the two
  entrances were kept locked. The house rested on arched vaults.</p>

  <p>On her arrival Mary inspected the premises and ordered the costly bed to
  be taken down and returned to Holyrood. A plainer travelling bed in purple
  was set up, her excuse being that the fumes from the medicinal baths would
  destroy the rich materials of the hangings. Darnley was lulled into
  aquiescence with his wife's plans; he agreed with her that the air of Kirk
  O'Field was excellent and wrote to his father that his health was improving
  and that Mary bore herself towards him as 'a natural and loving wife'. He was
  still, however, unable to leave his bed and continued to wear the mask of
  taffeta (sticking plaster). He was not to see his son until the baths had
  freed him of contagion.</p>

  <p>Mary spent two nights in the rooms beneath those of her husband. She had
  for company that Lady Reres detested by Darnley as a suspected go-between
  with Mary and Bothwell. The two women amused themselves with music, singing
  and playing. Their laughter and gay chatter enlivened the dismal old
  house.</p>

  <p>On February 7th (1567) Mary slept for the last time at Kirk O'Field. On
  the ninth of that month one of her celebrated festivities was arranged for
  Holyrood; it was to be a ball and banquet in honour of the marriages of four
  of her servants: Sebastien Pagez, a French cook and Christina Hogg, John
  Stevart and Margaret Carwood. Pagez, a witty jester and deviser of masques,
  as well as a <i>chef de cuisine</i>, was an especial favourite with the
  Queen, who presided at the supper held during these merriments. Bothwell,
  Huntly, Argyll and other of the Lords were in attendance on the Queen, who
  had been with Darnley that day, and about ten o'clock she set out with
  Bothwell and a noble retinue on horseback to visit him again. The night was
  moonless and cold, a winter mist hung over Edinburgh, the riders in the
  cavalcade from Holyrood were wrapped in furs and lit by flambeaux. Mary
  dismounted, went up to the sick man's room, stayed a short while and returned
  to Holyrood, where she joined in the festivities for another hour or so.</p>

  <p>By two o'clock the royal household was in bed; the Queen intended to ride
  to Seton early that morning and her ladies had whispered about the complete
  reconciliation between her and Darnley, to whom she had given a rich ring. He
  had almost recovered and had ordered that his horses should be sent to Kirk
  O'Field, so that he might accompany the Queen on her bizarre journey at five
  o'clock on a winter morning. Mary had agreed to the sick man's whim and at
  his complaints about the travelling bed in which he rested said that 'he
  should lie, with her, she promised, in a richer one the next night'.</p>

  <p>Darnley's chamber was splendidly appointed. There were two state chairs,
  one in purple velvet, the other in the Scots colours, yellow and red, a table
  covered with green velvet, while the despised purple bed was equipped with a
  silk paillasse, down pillows and warm coverlets. After Mary had departed
  Darnley left his bed and engaged his servant in gloomy talk, after drinking
  with him. The solitude and silence of the place, the sense of his isolation,
  again roused the suspicions he had never entirely lost. He remarked that the
  Queen had said that it was nearly a year since the murder of Rizzio; he hoped
  that Mary had forgotten this outrage and her threat that she would have
  revenge within twelve months. To quiet his nerves he asked the English
  servant to read the psalms in his native tongue, familiar to Darnley, who had
  no acquaintance with Scots. The servant, using his own psalter, read some of
  the sombre words of the 55th Psalm, full of menace, a curse on the wrongdoer:
  'The Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and the deceitful man' and 'there
  is no faithfulness in his mouth, their inner hearts are very wickedness,
  their throats are an open sepulchre, they flatter with their tongues'.</p>

  <p>By midnight the young man was in bed. About an hour later fifty men
  surrounded the house, having entered through the door in the city wall from
  'Thieves Row'. Sixteen others, led by Bothwell, followed them; the doors were
  locked but Bothwell was provided with keys. The Earl still wore his festival
  dress of black satin, silk and velvet, and over it a heavy German cavalry
  cloak.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock in the morning the citizens of Edinburgh were awakened by a
  loud explosion (February loth, 1567). The streets were soon crowded with
  anxious people, running about by the light of torches. Bothwell, who, as
  Sheriff of Edinburgh, was responsible for law and order, was knocked up at
  his lodgings; the dwellers in 'Thieves Row' came running into the centre of
  the town with the tale that 'the King's house' had been blown into the air.
  This report was found to be true; barrels of gunpowder had been emptied in
  the vaults under the Prebendary and the powder ignited; only fallen masonry
  showed where Darnley had last lodged. A search by torchlight revealed the
  bodies of Darnley and his servant, Taylor, under a tree in the garden. They
  had been strangled and were not marked by the effect of the explosion. Some
  old women from the almshouses near related that they had heard cries for
  mercy coming through the dark, with appeals addressed to 'kinsmen'; the two
  professional <i>bravi</i>, Archibald and George Douglas, though completely in
  the interest of Morton and Bothwell, were kin to Darnley. The bodies were
  taken to Holyrood and that of Darnley delivered to the embalmers.</p>

  <p>The Queen kept her head. She at once wrote one of her skilful letters to
  Beaton that served as her statements at times of crisis. In this she
  described the crime that had disposed of her husband and gave as her opinion
  that the murderers had intended to blow her into the air also and that she
  had been saved by God, who had put it into her head to attend the masque at
  Holyrood. No one could have shared this view; Mary had not lived with Darnley
  at Kirk O'Field and gone to Holyrood by 'very chance'; she had lived at the
  Palace and visited her husband and returned to the festival so publicly that
  no one could have supposed she was still in Darnley's lodging when he was
  murdered. Her Council supported her by sending an account of the tragedy to
  Catherine de Medici in which they agreed that the plot was against the Queen
  too, and promised vengeance for a crime that if not punished would make
  Scotland odious to the whole of Christendom. Bothwell, Huntly and the
  Archbishop of St. Andrews were among those who signed this letter, and the
  Council, anxious for the good opinion of the French Queen, sent a Frenchman,
  M. de Clarnault, to Paris with the mission to explain the Kirk O'Field affair
  in a manner to exculpate Mary and themselves from any share in the crime.</p>

  <p>Mary retired to her black-hung, candle-lit room for a day; then she and
  two of her ladies spent Good Friday in prayer in the Royal Chapel of
  Holyrood. A Requiem was sung over Darnley's corpse and he was buried quietly
  among the Stewart Kings in the vaults of this same chapel, close to where
  David Rizzio lay. Mary appeared sad and in poor health. Bothwell put about
  the theory that 'thunder' must have struck the house in Kirk O'Field. Robert
  Melville was dispatched to Elizabeth to gloze over the murder as best he
  could; the English Queen, alarmed and astonished, sent Sir Henry Killigrew to
  spy out Mary's affairs. This envoy was received in the mourning chamber that
  was so dark he could not see the widow's face. Shortly after Mary went to
  Seton, a journey not much delayed by the murder of her husband. Bothwell and
  Huntly soon joined her and the royal party amused themselves by shooting at
  the butts, games of pell mell and golf.</p>

  <p>Darnley (King Henry), despised and hated during his life, assumed a
  dreadful power after his violent death. Scotland was appalled by this murder
  that seemed, in the common opinion, to have a peculiar horror. Bothwell was
  at once suspected and it was considered outrageous that Mary should entertain
  him at Seton. There was a popular clamour that she should take steps to bring
  her husband's murderers to justice, but beyond a proclamation offering a
  reward and a free pardon to anyone who would disclose the authors of the
  crime the Queen did nothing. Placards appeared in Edinburgh, accusing
  Bothwell of 'bloody murder'; ballads and lampoons added their denunciations,
  to which the Earl responded by threats of 'washing his hands in the blood of
  the writers' if he could discover them. He had the air of overawing the
  capital when he descended on it in the intervals of his pastimes at Seton,
  for he was protected by five hundred Borderers from Liddesdale, 'pirates and
  cattle thieves', but he showed some nervousness. His 'strange' countenance,
  and his hand for ever on his dagger, were noted; it seemed as if he had soon
  found that his crime had been too recklessly undertaken, and even his bravado
  could not alter, or even silence, public opinion.</p>

  <p>The murder of Darnley indeed made a terrible impression on the Scots, used
  as they were to deeds of violence, partly because it had not been a daylight
  slaying but an assassination in the house of darkness. The use of gunpowder,
  too, was new and horrible and the strong dramatic sense of the nation,
  prepared by the fulminations of John Knox and his warnings of disaster, dwelt
  gloomily on all the strange aspects of the story that had led to Kirk
  O'Field. Foremost in the popular imagination was the sinister and formidable
  figure of Earl Bothwell, who had been so long and so obviously the Queen's
  favourite that it became a mere quibble if he were her lover or no. She had
  flaunted her liking for him before her own people and the foreign envoys, and
  everyone, even in Europe, suspected him of being the ringleader in the murder
  of her husband; but she had not, even for a day, dismissed him from her
  company or shown him the slightest sign of displeasure.</p>

  <p>The tale of the Craigmillar Band had got abroad. Everyone believed that
  Mary knew of it, and that she had gone to Glasgow and lured a sick, reluctant
  man from his father's stronghold into the hands of his enemies; with this
  knowledge, also, she had lodged him in a lonely house easily accessible from
  a street of bad repute, far from help, and overlooked by a mansion full of
  armed men belonging to a faction (the Hamiltons) hostile to him; with this
  knowledge she had visited him, leaving the feast of Holyrood to talk and
  laugh with him while the powder was emptied from the kegs in the vaults below
  his bedchamber, and with this knowledge she had ridden through the winter
  night to return to her masking, ordering one of her train to sound a sackbut
  as she left the meadows as a signal to the murderers. Stories of the manner
  of Darnley's death were rumoured everywhere; he had been choked in bed with a
  handkerchief soaked in vinegar; he had fought for his life: 'thirty men were
  about him' and he had been 'long in dying'; he had been dragged to the
  stables and there strangled with his garters; he had been heard begging for
  pity because of his descent from Henry VII&mdash;that fatal claim for him,
  his kin and for Mary herself, the source of that ambition for the English
  throne that had poisoned their lives.</p>

  <p>These stories showed Mary in a light that appalled her subjects. It was
  adultery and treachery, probably black magic, as well as murder. Mary was
  seen as an embodiment of all the false women of legend; a ballad wrote of her
  as Delilah&mdash;'Double Dallilay'. Darnley's faults were forgiven; only his
  youth, his beauty, his brilliance were remembered. After a headlong marriage
  and an open display of passion Mary had tired of him and slighted him for
  Rizzio 'the low-born foreign knave'. Darnley's murder of the Italian now
  seemed justified; if Rizzio had been Mary's lover and the father of her
  child, the young husband had taken only the usual revenge for his dishonour
  after a few months of wedlock, and afterwards he had been slighted, ignored,
  insulted, humiliated in a manner outrageous enough to cause a wiser man to
  revolt. He had seen Rizzio preferred to himself and then he had seen Bothwell
  actually in his place at the christening of the Prince. All pitied him for
  his end and all condemned the treachery that had beguiled him to his
  miserable death. Mary was not condoned because she might have acted out of
  revenge for Rizzio; it was thought scandalous to shed royal blood to pay for
  base blood and there was disgust that Darnley had been buried hastily, with
  maimed rites, so near to Rizzio, with the Kings of Scotland. He had not
  received any last administrations and, as a Roman Catholic, must have passed
  unshriven to his judgement. All these details increased the compassion felt
  for the youth slain in his twenty-first year and swelled the hatred felt
  towards his widow.</p>

  <p>There had been too many concerned in the murder for all to be for long
  silent. The English servants, save Taylor, had escaped from the doomed house
  on hearing footsteps coming from 'Thieves Row' and had hidden themselves in
  the dark; now they had their tales. Lennox, in Glasgow, beside himself with
  grief and fury, gathered up all these whispers and rumours. He had also
  Crauford's evidence as to the interviews between husband and wife when she
  was persuading him to return to Edinburgh. Lennox wrote firmly and
  respectfully to Mary, entreating her to bring the murderers to justice.</p>

  <p>The advice of Elizabeth Tudor was on the same lines. Elizabeth was in a
  dilemma. She did not wish to encourage the Lords, insofar as they were
  rebels, but she was in full sympathy with their design of ridding Scotland of
  all Roman Catholics. She was horrified by the murder of Darnley, opening up,
  as it did, such terrible prospects of sudden death from gunpowder; yet while
  she affected a considerable disgust at Mary's reckless behaviour she did not
  wish to see her dethroned. The example would be an ill one for the English.
  Under Cecil's guidance she kept to her game of fast and loose; but all the
  counsel she sent to Mary was prudent and useful, and she released Lady Lennox
  from the Tower where she had been sent on her son's marriage. Darnley owed
  his superb accomplishments and noble bearing to the careful training of this
  proud woman; and many wise people thought that had she been allowed to
  accompany him to Scotland she would have saved him from folly and preserved
  his life. Public opinion in France, where Mary had been known and admired as
  a peerless, spotless Princess, was not favourable to her. The French Court
  was startled and shocked; Catherine de Medici took a hostile view and wrote
  severely to Mary stating that if she did not have the King (Darnley) speedily
  avenged 'to clear herself' the House of Valois would not only think her
  dishonoured but consider themselves her enemies. A bold and wise letter came
  from Archbishop Beaton, always Mary's loyal, upright friend. He wrote warmly
  of the horrible rumours current not only in Scotland but in England and
  Europe, as to Mary's part in the tragedy of Kirk O'Field. Deeply moved, he
  exhorted Mary, as so many others had exhorted her, to bring the criminals to
  'a rigorous vengeance'; if she did not, he added, 'it appears to me better in
  this world that you had lost life and all'. Forcibly bringing before Mary's
  notice the evil things said of her all over Europe&mdash;'too odious for me
  to repeat'&mdash;and urging her to retrieve her honour by a bold move against
  the murderers of her husband, Beaton added, 'or I fear this is only the
  beginning and first act of the tragedy where all shall run from evil to
  worse'.</p>

  <p>Mary was without her wisest counsellors when she had to face these
  reproaches and warnings Moray requested a licence to go abroad and went to
  Italy; Maitland stayed in the background; the Lords had accomplished part of
  their plot; they had got rid of Darnley; now they had only to remain effaced
  and wait while Mary and Bothwell ruined themselves. Then Protestantism would
  be triumphant and all their ends gained.</p>

  <p>The Scots joined the Valois, Beaton and Elizabeth. They petitioned Mary
  for a redress of their grievances and 'vengeance on the murderers of the
  King'. Lennox named these in one of his letters to Mary&mdash;Bothwell, James
  Balfour, David Chalmers (in whose establishment Bothwell had lodged at the
  time of the 'checker house' scandal), Black John Spens and some underlings
  including Guiseppe Rizzio, Mary's foreign secretary. Lennox remarked that he
  would have thought the Queen would have been familiar with these names from
  the pasquinades pasted up in Edinburgh, but Mary was evasive. She continued
  her outwardly easy life and no one was brought to judgement for the crime of
  Kirk O'Field.</p>

  <p>The wild tales increased in number. One report was that on the night of
  the murder a dark figure, spectre or human, had violently knocked on the door
  of the good Earl of Atholl's house, as if trying to rouse him to prevent the
  crime. A dying man, that same night, had glimpsed the horrid scene in a
  vision.. Voices were heard in the dark, crying 'Vengeance!'</p>

  <p>Mary continued to favour Bothwell; though straitened as to means, she gave
  him money, lands and many of the rare and costly vestments, heavy with gold
  and silver, she had once brought as booty from the Gordon Castles in the
  North. Lennox accused her of giving Bothwell, also, all the horses, clothes
  and furniture once belonging to his son. One James Murray of Tullibardine
  drew caricatures of Mary and her favourite in so lively a fashion that he had
  to fly to England.</p>

  <p>A mock trial, to blind public opinion, was arranged for Bothwell, to be
  held before the Council on April 12th (1567). He was himself a member of this
  Council and all the others were in awe of him. Lennox appealed to Elizabeth
  on the question of this trial and advanced towards the capital at the head of
  three thousand Lennox Stewarts. Mary also wrote to Elizabeth, complaining of
  the slanders being put about against herself; the English Queen replied in
  kind and dignified terms, repeating the advice of Beaton, and urging Mary to
  postpone Bothwell's trial until it could be held fairly. This letter was
  dated Westminster, April 8th (1567), and sent post haste to Holyrood, the
  messenger taking three days on the journey, but he was denied admission to
  the Queen and finally had to deliver the letter to Bothwell. No answer was
  sent. The messenger saw Bothwell, with a troop of four thousand retainers,
  march off to the Tolbooth, where the trial was held; such a number of armed
  men was sufficient to secure a judgement in his favour. Lennox, after he had
  learned that he would not be allowed more than six followers when he entered
  Edinburgh, feigned sickness and remained in Stirling.</p>

  <p>Bothwell was formally acquitted of any share in the murder of Darnley.
  Among his judges was his brother-in-law, and fellow criminal, Huntly. As a
  sop to public clamour the trial was a failure; the cynicism shown in the
  careless, farcical procedure only increased the scandal that Mary coolly
  ignored. Moray, pausing on his way to Italy, was giving, at this very moment,
  a first-hand account of the Kirk O'Field affair to Elizabeth. He confided to
  her that he had left Scotland because of fear of Bothwell, who held the forts
  of Edinburgh and Dunbar, lately given to him by Mary. He stated that forty
  people had been concerned in the murder and that Bothwell was the ringleader.
  Declaring that it was beneath him to remain in a country where such a deed
  remained unpunished, the stately Moray, biding his time, went on his travels
  'to see Venice and Milan'. He had tried to put a decent face on his sister's
  actions, speaking of her wisdom and 'great virtue' and denying the report
  that she would marry Bothwell as soon as he could obtain a divorce from Jane
  Gordon; he admitted, however, that Huntly was to receive back his forfeited
  estates.</p>

  <p>While Moray went in a leisurely fashion to Italy, Bothwell placarded
  Edinburgh with bills challenging to mortal combat anyone who suspected him of
  complicity in the King's murder. The Parliament, which met soon after the
  mock trial, confirmed the Queen's gift of the great fortress of Dunbar.
  Huntly duly received his estates, so did Morton, and the Reformed Church was
  officially recognized. This last concession did not prevent the fury of the
  people being lashed by the honours given to Bothwell, who was, however, now
  supreme in the Queen's favour. In the full tide of his success he held a
  supper party at Ainslie's Tavern. Most of the nobles were gathered there, and
  some forced to stay against their wills as Bothwell's men surrounded the
  house. Bothwell produced a Band and obliged all those present to sign it. By
  doing this they pledged themselves to assist him to marriage with the Queen
  and to help him against his enemies. Argyll, Cassilis, Huntly, Morton, Ross,
  Sutherland, Glencairn, Caithness and others were either cajoled or threatened
  into signing. The English Marshal of Berwick, Sir William Dury, wrote to
  Elizabeth that Mary (then at Stirling where Mar had the Prince in his
  keeping) had tried to poison her child with an apple and a sugar loaf.
  Grange, a Scot in English pay, reported to Cecil that Mary was 'so shamefully
  enamoured of Bothwell that she had been heard to say she cared not to lose
  France, England and her country for him, and will go with him to the world's
  end in a white petticoat. Whatever is dishonest reigns presently at
  court'.</p>

  <p>Mary put off Lennox, point by point, when he urged, as he did continually,
  punishment of his son's murderers. He was collecting yet more tales of Kirk
  O'Field. Bothwell's body-servant, one Nicolas Herbert, known as French Paris,
  was seen on the night of the crime, powder blackened, and the Queen had said:
  Jesu, Paris, how begrimed you are!' One Captain Cullen was said to have
  confessed to a hand in the matter; he said: 'the King in his strength made
  debate for his life'. Bothwell, though at a wedding feast, had been all in
  black in order that he might not be seen in the dark. Mary, so fond of male
  attire, had been among the murderers dressed as a cavalier.</p>

  <p>Huntly paid the agreed price for his returned estates; he persuaded his
  sister, the learned and fascinating Jane, to divorce Bothwell, with whom she
  had lived in amity for eighteen months. She received her freedom in Scots law
  on her petition of her husband's misconduct with a servant girl; the marriage
  was annulled under canon law by the Archbishop of St. Andrews, who found the
  usual prohibited degrees of kinship. There was no appeal to the Vatican. This
  priest owed his consistory powers entirely to Mary, who was not in her legal
  right in granting them, and he never used them again.</p>

  <p>Jane Gordon was granted, in consideration of her compliancy, some valuable
  estates and Bothwell was now free to marry the Queen. Grange wrote to England
  that he had spied out the news that the Queen and her favourite had arranged
  a mock abduction to take place on her return from Stirling on April 24th
  (1567); and that Bothwell was gathering men in Liddesdale&mdash;'Judge ye if
  the Queen is aware of it or no'.</p>

  <p>The spy's information proved correct. Mary, returning with a small escort
  from Linlithgow to Edinburgh, was met at Almond Bridge by Bothwell with a
  powerful retinue and taken to Dunbar Castle. Huntly, Maitland and Melville
  were with the Queen and taken with her; they were confined in other parts of
  the Castle from the apartments assigned to Mary, who declared she had
  submitted 'in order to save bloodshed'. She arrived at Dunbar at midnight and
  remained enclosed there eight days while the Bothwell divorce was being
  hurried through the Civil and Ecclesiastical courts. There was no attempt to
  rescue the Queen and no protest at her seizure save a gallant offer of help
  from Aberdeen, unanswered. It was commonly believed that the abduction was
  pre-arranged in order to give Mary an excuse for a hasty marriage with her
  captor. The canon law divorce was based on false premises, i.e., that no
  Papal dispensation had been sent for Bothwell's marriage with Jane Gordon; as
  it had, however, been received, the divorce was illegal from the Roman
  Catholic point of view. Jane Gordon always kept this dispensation that
  permitted her marriage. At the time of the mock divorce she was twenty years
  old, a writer of literary love letters and fashionable verse, who had made a
  strong impression on the fickle heart of Bothwell.</p>

  <p>On the May 3rd. (1567) Mary re-entered Edinburgh, Bothwell leading her by
  the bridle of her horse. The Lords were gathering at Stirling round the
  Prince, symbol of royalty. Mary and Bothwell had played into their hands They
  had now the excuse for which they had been waiting, to get rid of their rash
  catspaw, Bothwell, and to disgrace the Queen to a point when it would not be
  possible for her to occupy the throne.</p>

  <p>There is no trace of the scene of the Darnley tragedy, one of the most
  famous and far-reaching in its effects of any crime recorded. 'Thieves Row',
  the cloisters, the Hamilton House, the fields, St. Mary's Church, have all
  gone. What was then the city wall boundary is now well inside the town.
  Edinburgh University stands on the site of Kirk O'Field. It is impossible to
  trace exactly the route by which Bothwell and Mary came from Holyrood; the
  way now is by Holyrood road to the Cow-gate, then by Nicolson Street, the
  University buildings being at the corner of this and Chambers Street. It will
  be noticed how near the scene of the murder was to the then heart of the
  city, St. Giles, the Tolbooth and Parliament House; yet owing to ill roads,
  lack of lights, of police, and the bad vicinity, it appeared dangerously
  lonely and isolated.</p>

  <p>Mary's ride from Linlithgow to Almond Bridge, where Bothwell met her, then
  to Dunbar, is also impossible to follow exactly. Her cavalcade were going on
  the short journey from the Palace at Linlithgow (where she had lately arrived
  from Stirling) to the capital. They reached the River Almond near Cramond
  where it runs into the sea. Bothwell then made a detour by Liberton, avoiding
  Edinburgh, and, passing Dalkeith and Haddington, came out at Dunbar. It was,
  allowing for bad roads and diversions from the direct route, a ride of nearly
  fifty miles for Mary and as much for Bothwell, since he had left Dunbar the
  same day as he met her at Almond Bridge.</p>

  <p>Mary made no lamentation about, or protest at, her captivity. She returned
  quietly to Holyrood but her position was perilous. The Lords gathering at
  Stirling took the attitude that the Queen had been abducted and detained
  against her will by Bothwell and they were determined to set her at liberty;
  by this they meant separating her from the Earl. Events were shaping exactly
  as they had wished and intended them to shape&mdash;that they were all, more
  or less, implicated in the Darnley murder did not trouble them. They held all
  the winning cards. The Black Douglas, the feared and hated Morton, was at
  Stirling, so was Mar, guardian of the infant Prince. Moray watched from
  Italy. John Knox had left Edinburgh after the murder at Kirk O'Field; he did
  not trust Bothwell, though they had once been on friendly terms and Bothwell
  was the preacher's native chieftain. His deputy, John Craig, was as unbending
  as he was himself and when Bothwell, shortly after his return from Dunbar,
  asked Craig to publish his banns of marriage with the Queen the preacher
  refused with bold defiance. The large majority of his countrymen were behind
  him but the Queen sent him a letter declaring that she had been neither
  abducted nor detained in captivity and ordering him to publish the banns.
  Craig did so, but added that he acted under force and loathed the proposed
  union. Called before the Privy Council to answer for this insolence, Craig
  openly accused Bothwell of murdering the King, ravishing the Queen and
  illegally divorcing his innocent wife. Bothwell tried to excuse himself of
  these crimes, but said nothing to satisfy the stern Protestant.</p>

  <p>The Lords sent a warning to the Queen to be careful in her conduct. On
  receiving an evasive reply they wrote again with plain terms. They refused
  obedience unless she disbanded her followers and dismissed her favourites.
  Most of these men had signed the Ainslie Tavern Band, whereby they were to
  assist Bothwell to the royal marriage they were now using as an excuse for
  revolt, but neither Bothwell nor Mary was clever enough for the Lords.
  Bothwell relied on violence; Mary soon reached the end of her political
  intelligence. She was not capable of more than cunning intrigue and desperate
  expedients and even these were often marred by her intense emotionalism.</p>

  <p>Having manoeuvred Bothwell and the Queen into this dangerous position, the
  Lords formed another Band. The first article was directed against Bothwell;
  the Queen was to be 'given her liberty', i.e. Bothwell was to be disposed of;
  secondly, the Prince was to be preserved, i.e. from his mother and the Roman
  Catholics; thirdly, the King's murderers were to be pursued. This Band
  mentioned Bothwell as a 'cruel murderer' though he had been acquitted of the
  Kirk O'Field crime. Mary's gift of Dunbar particularly irked the Lords, for
  besides being a mighty fort it was an arsenal containing nearly all the
  national stock of gunpowder. They moved quickly, declaring that Bothwell
  intended to poison the Prince and seize the kingdom. Grange, the English
  agent, wrote to Bedford in Carlisle for English help. An appeal was made to
  Du Croc, who warned Mary that marriage with Bothwell would mean a break with
  France. As she took no heed he wished to leave her and, as representative of
  Charles IX, to attach himself to the Prince, thus showing that he no longer
  regarded her as Queen of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The country was up; Scotland would have no more of Earl Bothwell. Argyll
  rode to rouse the West, Atholl to the North, Morton to Fife. Huntly, with his
  newly restored estates, the price of his sister's divorce, was a power in the
  Catholic Highlands. Bothwell, with considerable levies of horse and foot but
  little money, withdrew with Mary into Edinburgh Castle, where she ordered the
  melting down of Elizabeth's gift, the golden font. Five thousand crowns were
  obtained in this way. Other supplies were 'reft and borrowed from Edinburgh
  and the men of Lothian'.</p>

  <p>On May 12th (1567) Mary created Bothwell Duke of Orkney and knighted four
  of his men. She was moody and in low spirits; once she was in Bothwell's
  power he showed himself furiously jealous and suspicious. This attitude did
  not arise from passionate love, but from fear. Bothwell lived in dread of the
  fate of Rizzio and Darnley; he knew well enough the capricious temper, the
  cunning treachery, of the Queen. As far as affection went, there was little;
  he kept Jane Gordon at Castle Crichton and often visited her, despite the
  Queen's protests. Gossip had it that he had said: 'Jane Gordon is my
  wife&mdash;the Queen my mistress', but despite these quarrels Mary and
  Bothwell were married in the royal chapel of the Palace of Holyrood House
  before the altar that had been the scene of her second marriage, and close to
  the vaults where Rizzio and Darnley lay. Mary was in deep
  mourning&mdash;gloom was ever associated with her relations with Bothwell. In
  her will she left him a black ring and one of her personal gifts to him had
  been an ornament in the form of a skull, with black tears.</p>

  <p>A few days before her marriage she had convened a full Assembly of nobles
  and judges at the Tolbooth and had appeared before them, formally denying
  that Bothwell had ill-used her. It had been noted then, and was noted again
  at the wedding, that she was looking so much 'changed in her face' that she
  appeared extremely ill. Anguish of mind had effaced her beauty; bloom and
  radiance had vanished, but the seductive grace, the royal poise remained.
  Only one noble of repute attended the ceremony, which was performed by a
  Protestant Bishop, Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney, but no relation to the
  groom. In his sermon he touched on Bothwell's (few used his new title)
  penitence for his past evil life, but Du Croc, Mary's friend, who visited her
  on three occasions at this period, sent accounts of her conduct, couched in
  terms of deep distress, to Catherine de Medici. Mary told the sympathetic
  Frenchman that she wished for nothing but death. He had already been told
  that during a quarrel with Bothwell on her wedding day she had shrieked for a
  knife with which to kill herself. Bothwell was drinking hard and using coarse
  language, and Mary's servants had reported that she might destroy herself. Du
  Croc warned Catherine to take no heed of the Bishop of Dunblane, then being
  sent to France with Mary's excuses for the marriage. He added that the state
  of Mary's affairs was precarious; she had asked the nobles to meet her and
  asked Du Croc to speak to them in the name of the King of France. The
  Frenchman considered this course hopeless and that it would be wiser for him
  to withdraw and 'leave them to play out their game'. He refused to recognize
  Bothwell as the husband of the Queen.</p>

  <p>Maitland was still with the Queen, but without power or influence. As the
  husband of her friend, Mary Fleming, he had continual opportunities of
  observing Mary's pitiful state, her tears and lamentations. He reported to Du
  Croc: 'Bothwell would not allow her to look at, or be looked at, by
  anybody&mdash;yet he knew she loved her pleasure.'</p>

  <p>Even Mary's confessor had advised her against this marriage, reduced to a
  farce by the constant absence of Bothwell in Castle Crichton with Jane
  Gordon. This priest was withdrawn by the Vatican.</p>

  <p>As the Lords gathered strength Mary and Bothwell moved in sinister
  isolation, protected only by the Hepburn followers, Border ruffians, Moss
  troopers and 'minions of the moon'. Morton spoke of the rule of 'a murderer
  and a murderess' while the detested pair held, in bravado, a masque of
  triumph at the end of the month when Bothwell, now 'my lord duke', rode at
  the ring. At this time Mary wrote painful evasions to the faithful Beaton in
  Paris; she tried to justify her marriage but gave no excuses; she must 'make
  the best of it, and so for our respect, must all that love us'.</p>

  <p>She instructed the Bishop of Dunblane to inform Catherine that her own
  nobles thought Bothwell the best husband for her, since they had signed the
  Ainslie's Tavern Band; also, he was to stress her troubles, perils,
  'inconstant and doubtful fate', and so on. She never admitted to any error or
  fault in herself; all her misfortunes were due to the cruelty of others or a
  pitiless destiny. Dunblane was to add the obscure comment that her Protestant
  marriage was brought about by this same 'destiny' rather than her 'free
  choice'.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of European diplomats Mary's marriage to Bothwell utterly
  discredited her both as a Queen and a woman. It was not a question as to
  whether she was innocent or guilty of adultery and murder, but a matter of
  her obvious incapacity to manage either her private or her public affairs.
  She had failed in the two great tasks set her by the policy of the Cardinal
  of Lorraine; she was no nearer than she had ever been to obtaining, either by
  intrigue or violence, a recognition of her claims to the English throne, and,
  far from re-establishing the ancient Faith in Scotland, she had so played
  into the hands of the Lords Protestants that they were the most formidable
  power in her Kingdom. She had come, a lovely girl, to her father's realm and
  been blessed by her subjects for her 'fair face'; now she was held up to
  execration from one end of the kingdom to another and cried out against not
  only as a criminal, but as a witch&mdash;'the curse of Scotland'.</p>

  <p>The Bothwell marriage came as the culmination of reckless follies&mdash;if
  no harsher word was used&mdash;and her one-time allies, the Pope, France,
  Spain, moved coldly away; if no one troubled themselves about her morals,
  these potentates had to concern themselves about her intelligence. All her
  busy intrigues had ended in failure; she had estranged those, like Moray and
  Maitland, who might have saved her, as Cecil and Walsingham had saved
  Elizabeth; she had raised to power men incapable of holding it; she had
  flouted the wishes and opinions of her people by childish 'pleasures' and
  extravagances; she had never shown any interest in the people, poor and
  bitterly afflicted. In five years she had brought murder, disorder, civil
  war, into Scotland. With a handful of ruffians she now faced a country in
  revolt, a neighbour hostile and a Europe where there was no ally.</p>

  <p>Her friends might argue, as she argued herself, that her misfortunes were
  entirely due to others and that all the evil told about her was merely
  slander. Catherine de Medici was not alone in refusing to be impressed by
  this point of view, nor did the ethics of the case matter much to foreign
  politicians. Mary, so brilliant, witty and discreet in France, once praised
  for her intelligent grasp of public affairs, had failed. She was no longer
  any use to anyone; the infant prince, with the Lords and the country behind
  him, was the focus for the envoys' spies and agents in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scots, on the other hand, chiefly resented Mary's domestic life. She
  was to them a Frenchwoman who thought of nothing but her own amusement. They
  argued that she had never done anything for Scotland. She had not even seemed
  interested in the country; she was always surrounded by troops of French
  people. To the Reformers her behaviour had always seemed incredibly wanton.
  The John Gordon scandal, the Chastelard episode, the Rizzio affair, the
  headlong Darnley marriage, the more headlong Bothwell marriage, the gay
  unconcern with which she danced, masked, hunted, played her games,
  alternating with vindictive rages and bouts of hysteria, her lavishness to
  her favourites&mdash;all these traits outraged the Scots. Her alleged sexual
  offences were deeply resented by the stern Puritans, who saw nothing but
  sensual passion in Mary's attachments. The age of chivalry was past, the age
  of sentiment had not arrived. Platonic friendships were not understood among
  the Scots; they were downright speakers and the women had even harsher names
  for Mary's actions than the men. All recalled, with awe, how Knox had warned
  them, when she had landed in a thick fog at Leith, of the disasters she would
  bring upon Scotland.</p>

  <p>The monarch most favourable to Mary was Elizabeth, who thought that her
  rank put her beyond criticism by her subjects. The English Queen haughtily
  rebuked Grange for some vile terms he used of his mistress, protesting that
  Mary could not be condemned like 'any common woman'. She was anxious,
  however, for the downfall of Bothwell, always the enemy of England, and was
  not moved by a flattering letter he sent her on June 5 (1567).</p>

  <p>Maitland had followed Mary into Edinburgh Castle. Bothwell and Huntly had
  fallen foul of the subtle, adroit man so difficult for them to understand and
  put him under guard; but Maitland contrived to send letters to England and to
  escape to Stirling, where the Lords received him coldly as he was believed to
  be Mary's spy. Huntly also wished to leave the Castle but Mary refused him
  permission, saying he intended to do as his father had done, raise the North
  against her authority. The feeling in Edinburgh becoming daily more bitter
  against the Queen, and her followers falling away, Bothwell left the Castle
  on June 7th and took Mary to Borthwick fourteen miles from the capital where
  he was nearer his own glens and tenantry.</p>

  <p>Mary ordered a muster at Muirhead Abbey for June 12th (1567). The levies
  of nobles, knights, esquires, gentlemen and yeomen were to come in full
  armour and weapons, each with six days' provisions.</p>

  <p>Borthwick and Crichton are two fine Castles above a wooded ravine, both
  then strongholds of the Hepburns. Passing inland and following the Esk to
  Dalkeith, Mary's train would soon arrive, in the summer weather, at
  Borthwick, set against the Lammermuirs one side and the Moorfoot Hills the
  other. Some handsome ruins of this once formidable Castle, built for defence,
  yet remain; the walls are of an unusual thickness and there is a double
  tower, the whole giving, even now, an impression of great strength.</p>

  <p>Mary, however, did not feel safe there. The muster was a failure. Few
  obeyed her summons and these few were half hearted and after she had been in
  Borthwick a week it was surrounded by the Lords with a thousand men. She
  appeared at a window and told them that her husband had gone to Dunbar; at
  this they withdrew and marched on Edinburgh, which they took, meeting no
  resistance. They had their case pat; this was not a revolt but an effort to
  achieve the three objects of their last Band; the freedom of the Queen, the
  safety of the Prince, the punishment of the King's murderers, and they
  offered these explanations to the anxious Du Croc whom they found still in
  Edinburgh. Mary escaped from Borthwick, dressed in male attire, and met
  Bothwell a mile from the Castle. They galloped to Dunbar, raised more
  Hepburns and other Borderers, marched to Haddington, then to Seton, places
  already familiar to both of them. Du Croc did not wish to countenance rebels,
  but when the Lords marched out to meet Bothwell he followed in the hopes of
  patching up a peace between them and Mary. After three hours' riding he found
  the two armies halted with about half a league between them and asked the
  Lords to offer terms to the Queen. They replied that she must abandon
  Bothwell, or Bothwell, in order to avoid a battle, must fight out the
  question of his guilt in mortal combat; twelve of the Lords' men would fight
  twelve of the Queen's men.</p>

  <p>After some debate Du Croc was given an escort of fifty horse and allowed
  to go to the Queen's quarters the other side of the brook. Mary was on
  horseback; she wore the costume of a humble citizeness of Edinburgh&mdash;a
  short red petticoat or kilt, a bodice with sleeves tied with laces over a
  skirt, a velvet hat and a muffler (light shawl). She dismounted and sat on a
  boulder while she listened to Du Croc, but the conversation was useless. Mary
  would not accede to the Lords' terms. She repeated her charges that they had
  urged her marriage and acquitted Bothwell; she added that she would forgive
  them if they submitted. Bothwell rode up, carrying the royal banner of
  Scotland, and asked loudly and boldly, so that all might hear, if he was the
  one wanted. In the same loud tone Du Croc said that the Lords were the humble
  servants of the Queen, adding in a whisper: 'But your mortal enemies.'</p>

  <p>Bothwell boasted and swaggered. He declared the Lords were jealous of his
  good fortune and accepted the challenge to mortal combat; he offered the
  usual tag about God protecting his just cause, then, on a more human note,
  referred to 'the extreme suffering' of the Queen.</p>

  <p>Du Croc admired Bothwell on this occasion. He thought that he had a
  gallant bearing and an air of confidence admirable in the circumstances.
  Bothwell knew that there were very few of his followers on whose loyalty he
  could count, but he gave no sign of weakness and was even ready to jest. Mary
  also kept a courageous front and controlled her fatigue, her distress and her
  deep anxiety with admirable fortitude. Du Croc was shocked to see her seated
  on the boulder by the stream, in her humble attire. But he could do nothing
  for her and had to accept Bothwell's laughing suggestion, fortified with an
  inaccurate reference to Ovid, that having failed as a peacemaker he should
  console himself with a good view of the battle.</p>

  <p>There were further fruitless arguments about the trial by combat proposal,
  during which many of Mary's soldiers slipped away to join the Lords and, thus
  encouraged, the forces of the Protestants began to ford the brook. Mary
  mounted and rode among her troops, persuading and encouraging them, but they
  remained half-hearted and she returned to the stone near to the spot where
  the Royal Standard of Scotland was set up.</p>

  <p>The Lords had a banner of a new and sinister design. It showed the corpse
  of Darnley beneath a tree. Near him the infant James knelt and the legend
  was: 'Judge and avenge my cause, O Lord!' As this flag was borne ahead of the
  advancing army, Mary observed the device and remarked that she wished she had
  never seen 'Henry Darnley'. It was then eleven o'clock in the morning, the
  place known as Carberry Hill. The two armies manoeuvred round each other
  until five o'clock in the evening, when Mary's men asked for a parley. The
  question of the single combat was again raised. Bothwell was willing but Mary
  made difficulties and soon the men on both sides were out of hand. Du Croc
  noted that 'they intermingled in great disorder'. Mary, seeing the day was
  lost, asked for Grange, after being refused by Maitland and Lindsay, and on
  his arrival asked how she might secure the safety of her husband. Grange
  could make no promise: 'The Lords are resolved to take him or die'. Bothwell
  did not wish to flee but the Queen urged him to escape until Parliament
  cleared him; she promised fidelity and there was a sad farewell of kisses and
  embraces. Bothwell gave her the Band for the death of Darnley, signed by many
  of the Lords, and galloped off the field, followed by a few desperate men,
  among whom were four outlawed Swedes. There was no pursuit and Mary thought
  that his withdrawal would bring her 'humble servants' back to their
  allegiance.</p>

  <p>This was not the case; she was surrounded and hurried to Edinburgh, the
  two armies, now both in the service of the Lords, following her in a confused
  triumph. Mary surrendered at six o'clock in the evening. It was eleven
  o'clock that same night before she reached her destination, the Provost House
  in Edinburgh. She was exhausted, dishevelled, faint with the horror and
  tedium of the day, during which she had had neither rest nor food. The banner
  showing Darnley's murder was carried in front of her, and fixed beneath her
  window; she had no attendants, no comfort, no privacy; armed guards were at
  the door of her one room. The cries of the people were full of fury against
  her; the shrillest denunciation was: 'Burn the harlot!' No one doubted her
  guilt and the punishment for adultery was the stake, for murder the gallows.
  She was not accused of a political offence for which the axe could have
  provided an honourable death, but of the most sordid of domestic crimes.</p>

  <p>Few queens had ever been so degraded, so utterly forlorn; even sober
  people considered that she could never regain her throne or any measure of
  respect. Once again she had badly miscalculated not only the characters of
  the men with whom she had to deal but the strength of the popular feeling
  against her. Not one friend came forward to stand by her. The Carberry Hill
  encounter ( June 15th, 1567) took place a month after her wedding with
  Bothwell and three months after the murder of Darnley.</p>

  <p>The Provost House was situate near the Nether Bow, close to the gabled
  building where John Knox lodged. The street, since much altered, was then
  cluttered and crowded with booths and stalls and packed tight with sternly
  excited people, shout ing denunciations of their queen. After two hours of
  this torture Mary appeared at her window. She was in a frenzy of rage and
  despair and paced, shrieking, from her guarded door to the window, her humble
  dress torn and open on the bosom, her hair hanging down. Her situation was
  desperate and she knew it. With hoarse cries she called on the people
  gathered below to rescue her, declaring that she had been betrayed. She made
  several of these frantic appearances by the light of the Northern summer
  night and the torches held by the infuriated crowd below, and so woeful was
  the spectacle, so bitter the contrast between the distracted, degraded
  captive and the proud Princess, decked in brilliancy, that Edinburgh was used
  to seeing that the people were mostly silenced, some even moved to pity.
  Retreating from the window, Mary wrote two letters on odd pieces of paper she
  found in the room and gave them, with many wild promises, to one of her
  guards. One was to the Governor of the Castle, ordering him not to surrender
  the citadel to the Lords; the other was for Bothwell&mdash;'calling him her
  dear heart, whom she would never abandon in his absence', telling him that
  she had sent him away only for his own safety and bidding him be on his
  guard. She did not know how this letter was to be delivered to the fugitive,
  nor did the guard concern himself about this point&mdash;he handed the
  letters over to the Lords.</p>

  <p>Returning to the window she shrieked out against the banner with the
  device of the murdered man. The crowd were abashed by the sight of so much
  misery, but there was no attempt at a rescue and some still repeated the
  cries that had greeted her from Tullibardine's men when she had surrendered
  at Carberry Hill&mdash;'Burn the harlot!'</p>

  <p>Du Croc was refused permission to visit Mary, but she saw Maitland passing
  in the street below and implored him to come up. He did so and spoke to her
  coldly, reminding her of Bothwell's fidelity to Jane Gordon and his treatment
  of Mary 'as his concubine'. Mary replied that this was not true, vehemently
  protested against her separation from Bothwell and 'wept bitterly'.
  Maitland's report of this interview, her attempt to smuggle letters out of
  prison and the dangerous state of the populace decided the Lords to move Mary
  from the capital. They had already taken from her the Band Bothwell had given
  her and all the power was in their hands. Moray's friends suggested Lochleven
  as a place of captivity; it belonged to his mother, who had married a Douglas
  and resided sometimes at Lochleven with her son, Sir William Douglas, and
  sometimes near by; Lochleven was a pleasant dwelling familiar to Mary; it was
  also considered impossible for this Castle in the middle of a lake ever to be
  taken; nor was it believed possible for anyone held prisoner there to
  escape.</p>

  <p>Moray had left Italy and was in France, covertly directing the actions of
  the Lords. The choice of Lochleven was favour able to the Queen, since it
  removed her from danger and insult and promised her some dignified abode.
  After her torment had endured until midnight the day after her capture, the
  frantic woman was escorted through the streets of Edinburgh, Atholl one side,
  Morton the other, the murder banner borne before her in the midst of a group
  of arbusiquiers. Despite the hour the narrow streets were packed with people
  whose transient pity had passed; so ugly was their mood that the Lords took
  an unprecedented step. The Trades Guilds of Edinburgh enjoyed the unique
  privilege of a banner, given them by royal grant and ranking with knightly
  honours; this was jealously guarded and universally respected&mdash;Mary's
  son afterwards named it 'The Blue Blanket'. This revered emblem was now
  brought out and carried in front of Mary as she proceeded through her
  capital. She was unmolested but the furious cries demanding the stake and the
  gallows were not hushed, for while many had been implicated in the murder of
  Darnley, at that moment Mary alone was held answerable for the crime.</p>

  <p>She was taken to Holyrood, then quickly removed to Lochleven which she
  reached on June 17th (1567). The Lords gave as their reason for detaining her
  in captivity her obstinate refusal to give up Bothwell and his accomplices in
  the Darnley murder; they considered that the realm would be ruined if she
  were allowed to follow her own inordinate passion'.</p>

  <p>Mary, on arriving at Lochleven Castle, collapsed into a dangerous illness,
  comparable to that she had suffered at Jedburgh. The nine Lords who signed
  the warrant for captivity found her place of confinement agreeable and
  commodious and there was, indeed, nothing gloomy or sinister about Lochleven
  Castle, nor was Lady Douglas a formidable jailor. This woman was of a noble
  family and a high character. Her connection with James V had been more that
  of a left-handed wife than a mistress; he had acknowledged and advanced their
  children, and if she had been of royal birth he would have married her. After
  his death she espoused Sir Robert Douglas, to whom she bore two sons and
  seven daughters. She was respected and admired and many rumours were about
  that some form of marriage had united her to James V.</p>

  <p>Moray had in mind the comfort and safety of his sister when he advised
  that she should be sent to Lochleven. Mary was decently housed in the third
  floor of the second tower of the Castle. Her apartments consisted of a
  bedroom, parlour, dining room, kitchen and an oratory in the recess of one of
  the windows. Some of her women, a cook, and an apothecary were sent from
  Holyrood. Mary remained in bed, hardly speaking or moving and refusing any
  but the lightest food. Her violence in the Provost House had been followed by
  one of the hysteric swoons to which she was liable and for nearly a fortnight
  she was extremely ill.</p>

  <p>A few days after the ruined Queen had been taken in disgrace to her
  prison, George Buchanan arrived in Edinburgh to attend the Assembly of the
  Church of Scotland, held in the Nether Tolbooth. He was then Principal of St.
  Andrew's University and was appointed Moderator 'for eschewing of confusion
  in reasoning'. The Assembly viewed with satisfaction the downfall of the
  foreign Roman Catholic Queen, which was considered as 'the beginning of Satan
  being trodden under foot'. George Buchanan thought so, too; he believed that
  Mary's true nature had been at last revealed and he, who once had been her
  ardent admirer and her Latin tutor, became her vehement enemy and set himself
  to denounce her with all the might of his learning and prestige.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>On the heels of Buchanan came Throckmorton, sent by Elizabeth and Cecil to
  find out the truth of Mary's horrible catastrophe. The English Queen still
  reserved judgement but she was persistent on an old demand: her shrewd and
  experienced envoy was to see if the ruined Mary would now ratify the Treaty
  of Edinburgh. Throckmorton could not obtain per mission to visit Mary in
  Lochleven; he was told that her passion for Bothwell made it needful to keep
  her in strict confinement. But he also carried a menacing letter from his
  mistress to the Lords; she did not at all relish these 'bold rebels' laying
  hands on their sovereign and wished her to be set at liberty, but she also
  pressed for the punishment of the murderers of the King. Throckmorton's
  instructions and précis of the case, drawn up by Cecil, were lucid and
  intelligent, while Sir Thomas Randolph summed up Mary's tragedy
  succinctly:</p>

  <p class="quote">'She governed for four years quietly in Scotland, till a
  change was made through her disorderly behaviour; first with
  Chastelard...next with David...with other such filthy behaviour, whereof I am
  ashamed to speak. Then the murder of Darnley, the marriage with Bothwell,
  etc. This has driven Mary from the throne, not the intrigues or enmity of
  Elizabeth.'</p>

  <p>The Lords, who did not know what to do with Mary, or how to placate
  Elizabeth, urged Moray to return. Bothwell had disappeared, rumour said into
  the Orkneys, where he was believed to be raising a band of pirates. Elizabeth
  was most severe against Bothwell and sternly condemned Mary for this reckless
  marriage, but she remained the only friendly power in Europe. France and
  England were secretly struggling for the custody of Prince James, and the
  prudent Moray, heavily bribed by both sides, was in London by July, telling
  the Spanish Ambassador that he knew Mary had been privy to the murder of
  Darnley. He had seen, he declared, a letter of hers to Bothwell that proved
  her guilt.</p>

  <p>This reference was to a collection of letters in a silver casket found by
  a servant under Bothwell's bed in Holyrood six days after the Queen's
  surrender at Carberry Hill. Lord Morton received the casket, which was
  locked, opened it and offered it for inspection to the Lords&mdash;and not
  only to the confederate Lords who had brought the Queen down, but to such
  moderate men as Mar and Atholl. The contents included eight letters, some
  sonnets and the marriage contracts of Bothwell and the Queen. All these
  documents were in French, but the Lords had several copies made in a Scots
  translation and one of these had been sent to Moray.</p>

  <p>This weapon against Mary was kept secret. She, recovering her spirits with
  her usual resilience, did not suspect the mischief brewing. She began to eat,
  to take exercise, to play cards, to flatter her jailors, one of whom,
  Ruthven, son of the man who had assisted at the murder of Rizzio, had to be
  removed as he was falling under her influence. Throckmorton had heard that
  she had made frantic declarations of love for Bothwell, vowing again that she
  would 'follow him to the end of the world in a white petticoat', but now she
  made no effort to write to him. She sent to Sir Robert Melville, once her
  Lord Chamberlain, and to Servais de Condé, the keeper of her wardrobe, for
  rich clothes, materials for embroidery, satin and silks, bed hangings,
  sheets, shoes and sweetmeats, dried damask plums and pears. She demanded
  these in sharp terms, adding that she needed dresses for her maids&mdash;'for
  they are naked'.</p>

  <p>Near the date of this letter the Lords issued a Proclamation offering a
  thousand crowns for the man who had staked his all on the Queen and lost.
  There were rumours of Bothwell on the Border, with Huntly at Strathbogie,
  again in the Orkneys, and a summons was issued against him. Throckmorton
  smuggled a letter into Mary's prison, assuring her of Elizabeth's friendship
  and advising her to break with Bothwell. She answered saying she could not
  abandon Bothwell since she expected to bear his child and would not disgrace
  herself and her infant by casting any reflection on her marriage. This
  brought a new element into the case, but Throckmorton thought the Queen's
  position hopeless if she did not give up Bothwell; he advised her to do this,
  in order 'to save her own life and that of the child'. It was</p>

  <p>exactly two months since her marriage; one month after that event Bedford
  had written to Elizabeth: 'The Queen is with child'. Elizabeth's letter had
  pointed at Mary's desperate desire to save her honour; if Mary's condition
  had been that of a woman not, as she said herself, 'seven weeks gone with
  child' but 'seven months' a clear light would have been thrown on the hasty
  murder, the hasty divorce, the hasty marriage, for seven months would take us
  back to the first of Mary's vehement demands to be rid of Darnley and the
  first reports that she was Bothwell's mistress.</p>

  <p>The Castle in Lochleven was reached by road to what is now Queensferry
  Bridge, then by boat across the Firth of Forth, then to Inverkeithing, thence
  to Dunfermline, then by a choice of roads and tracks to Kinross that is near
  the large lake on which is an island bearing the Douglas Castle, now a ruin.
  Lochleven is still nearly nine miles in circumference and was once larger.
  The island was smaller, a bare two acres, when Mary was imprisoned there.
  Castle Island was half a mile from the shore, and, then as now, could be
  reached only by rowing boat.</p>

  <p>While Mary was held in this prison, from which, it was generally believed,
  she could never escape, Europe watched her affairs from afar. Charles IX was,
  he declared, eager to see his sister-in-law at liberty, but his mother,
  Catherine, was still the enemy of the Queen of Scots. The French at large
  were indifferent; they 'took water with their wine' as Throckmorton observed,
  and, if the 'auld alliance' might be kept with Scotland, cared not if they
  dealt with Mary or the Lords, acting for the little Prince. Throckmorton
  found his mission impossible to execute; he could not induce the Lords to set
  the Queen free, nor even obtain permission to see her. Knox returned to
  Edinburgh and menaced Scotland with plagues if the murderess and adulteress
  were not punished. But the English envoy believed that his threat of
  Elizabeth's wrath against the rebels had prevented them from delivering Mary
  to the people, thereby saving her life. He found the public feeling against
  her running very high and his appeals to Knox and Craig to preach mercy were
  in vain. Indeed, he had soon fears for himself among the angry Scots, and
  noted that 'a stranger busy among them' had better be prudent. He heard that
  Mary still staunchly refused to give up Bothwell, who had now retreated to
  the Castle of Spynie. Yet the Lords had resolved on a royal divorce and
  Argyll planned to marry Mary to his brother.</p>

  <p>Throckmorton thought Maitland, who had said that 'twelve English thousand
  crowns or so' of bribes might 'do much', the most capable and prudent of the
  Lords who, by July 22nd (1567), had answered Elizabeth's protests, glozing
  over the question of the Queen's guilt and putting all the blame on Bothwell.
  The Queen, they explained, 'was shut up' in a solitary place to keep her
  asunder from Bothwell, whom she loved immeasurably. Throckmorton reported
  that the people were resolved on her punishment and not to be controlled.
  Knox was largely responsible for keeping this public fury at fever heat; he
  pointed in triumph to 'the bloody end to which the stinking pride of woman
  had come'. Other preachers followed his lead; the Queen was abused from every
  pulpit in the country. The placards and ballads were without shame or
  decency.</p>

  <p>Lindsay, Moray's brother-in-law, went to Lochleven with an Act of
  Abdication. Mary was ill; as no more was heard of her second child it was
  supposed that she had miscarried; but a wilder tale was that a live infant
  had been smuggled from Lochleven in a basket and taken to France. She signed
  the Act that formally declared that she resigned the crown to her son and
  gave the regency to Moray until James should be seventeen years of age. In
  case Moray refused this post, and until his return to Scotland, she appointed
  a Committee of the Lords, the head of the Hamiltons, Châtelherault, Lennox,
  Argyll, Mar, Atholl, Morton and Glencairn. The preamble of the document gave
  as her reasons for the abdication the 'long, irksome and tedious travail that
  had so vexed and worried her that body, spirit and senses were no longer able
  to endure'. Mary signed under duress and threats; the Lords had their
  indictments ready had she refused. They were to charge her with tyranny,
  adultery&mdash;with others besides Bothwell&mdash;and murder; they stated
  they had proofs of all these crimes in 'her own writing'.</p>

  <p>Throckmorton was dismayed by this news that he was aware would be
  objectionable to Elizabeth. He wrote a long letter of excuses to his
  mistress, trying to console her with hopes of the capture of Bothwell. An
  English spy, one Rokeby, was with him in Spynie and had promised to hand him
  over to his enemies; not a good scheme, Throckmorton thought, since Bothwell
  was surrounded by the very ruffians who had helped him to murder Darnley.
  Moreover, it was not 'to Elizabeth's honour that he should be slain in a
  brawl; he must be brought to justice'.</p>

  <p>James VI was crowned in Stirling by the Bishop of Orkney. Knox preached
  amid noisy rejoicing. A thousand bonfires lit Edinburgh&mdash;twice as many
  as had blazed for the birth of the new King. This exuberance was partly due
  to a penny fine levied on all who did not light a bonfire. Dancing and
  general joy celebrated the opening of the reign of the first Protestant
  sovereign.</p>

  <p>Mary was extremely ill in her prison and could not leave her bed;
  Throckmorton wondered 'for what continuance' he had saved her life, for she
  had not one friend or champion to speak for her, 'whether it be from fear,
  fury or zeal, I know not' he noted, but it was clear that the Lords were
  still half inclined to yield to the public mood and put Mary on a 'trial' in
  which she would have had no chance. One reason why the count was so black
  against Mary was the suspicion of the bedevilment of black magic. Bothwell
  was believed to be a wizard; whispers of spells, potions, charms, ghosts,
  visions had assailed Mary from her first landing at Leith. Since the Papal
  Bull against sorcerers, in 1484, hundreds of witches, male and female, had
  perished in the flames for far lighter misdemeanours than those imputed to
  the Queen and Bothwell. Her last illness&mdash;'a flux from a mis carriage of
  twins, her issue by Bothwell', as it was plainly stated to be&mdash;did not
  help Mary; such a case fitted too well into the earlier details of her story.
  'The women were more violent than the men,' wrote Throckmorton, 'yet they
  were mad enough.'</p>

  <p>Elizabeth, however, continued to resent the treatment given to Mary and
  declared she would 'revenge it to the uttermost' on the rebels. Moray paused
  at Windsor on his way home and spoke soothingly to his hostess, speaking
  kindly of Mary and trying once more to offer Earl Bothwell as a general
  scapegoat.</p>

  <p>By the middle of August (1567) Moray was at Lochleven. He brought with him
  Morton and Atholl, but Mary drew him apart and there followed a fruitless
  interview of tears and reproaches on her side and cold rebukes on his. On his
  giving her his promise of her life she seemed much eased, begged him to
  accept the Regency and pressed on him the keeping of her jewels, to be saved
  for her son. Moray told her to forget Bothwell and repent her disorderly
  life. This was the last time the Queen spoke of Bothwell; fear, anguish,
  illness had quenched that passion as quickly as her passion for Darnley had
  been quenched. She was out of love. Bothwell was living violently at Castle
  Spynie, a strong bishop's castle near Lossiemouth, where he quarrelled with
  Huntly, and his men killed and brawled among themselves.</p>

  <p>The Lords then replied defiantly to Elizabeth in 'sharp, round
  terms'&mdash;'If you will burn our borders, we will do the like to yours,
  and, whensoever you invade us, we are sure France will aid us, for their
  deeds stand fast.' They sternly reminded her that she had done nothing to
  capture Bothwell and the other murderers or to safeguard the little King, and
  it was a strange interference for her to order those who were no subjects of
  hers to set the Queen at liberty&mdash;would she send a thousand men, or
  three ships, to seize Bothwell?</p>

  <p>The reply of the outraged Elizabeth was to recall Throckmorton. Before he
  left the English envoy heard that Bothwell had taken to the sea and was being
  chased by Grange, whose vessel, however, grounded, while Bothwell fled the
  islands of the North, making for Norwegian waters. Mary recovered her
  spirits. She remained on amiable terms with her warders and kept on a fairly
  friendly basis with Moray. She was even gay and put on weight. Abandoned by
  all, she still had her charms, her pathos, her seductive guile; and George
  Douglas, youngest son of the Lady Margaret, was moved by the Queen's beauty
  and suffering. She encouraged him, with the result that Dury reported yet
  another scandal attached to the Queen's name. Stories of another child born
  in Lochleven went abroad&mdash;there was talk, too, that Douglas might marry
  the Queen, and other suitors were discussed; Argyll's brother, again, and
  Lord Methuen. Mary was much comforted by these plans, but the infatuated
  Douglas was removed from Lochleven and her light coquetry checked. It had not
  been in vain, however. Douglas remained near and had access to the Castle;
  through him Mary sent two wild yet tactful letters of self-justification and
  complaint to Catherine de Medici, begging for troops to set her on the throne
  again.</p>

  <p>Bothwell was still an obstacle, both to Mary's fourth marriage and the
  peace of Scotland. His ship had been wrecked on the Danish coast. Frederick
  II refused, however, to deliver him at Moray's demand and held him prisoner
  at the Castle of Bergham. This was to the Regent's interest, as he had no
  wish for Mary to marry again or for a trial of Bothwell to take place in
  Scotland for the murder of Darnley. Too many had been implicated in that
  crime.</p>

    <p class="caption">Key found in Lochleven identified as that<br>
    dropped by the Queen's party after escape from the Castle</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>George Douglas stayed at Kinross, on the borders of Lochleven, and there
  repaired to him those nobles who were dissatisfied with Moray's rule; the
  restless Huntly, the Hamiltons, Argyll, Seton and Herries. Mary had
  complained to Catherine de Medici&mdash;'so closely am I watched that I have
  no leisure but while they dine, etc.', but a plan for her deliverance was
  easily carried through. She had tried once to get away dressed as a servant,
  but had been discovered by her 'fair, white hands'. Since then she had been
  confined in a tower, but nevertheless she contrived to escape, with the
  connivance of several in the Castle, including Willie Douglas, who stole the
  keys. Mary slipped out with Mary Seton, and Willie rowed them across the
  lake, where she was met by George Douglas and Alexander Hepburn, Bothwell's
  kinsman. Horses were ready and the party set out towards Niddry. After a few
  miles she was met by Lord Seton, always her faithful friend, and then by
  Claud Hamilton. At Niddry was another loyal ally, Lord Herries.</p>

  <p>It was May, of the year 1568. Mary had been in prison nearly a year but
  the kindness of her treatment showed in her renewed health, beauty and high
  spirits. Castle Niddry, near Linlithgow, is now a mere ruin; in Mary's day it
  was a well-equipped Castle. She and her party went on at once to Castle
  Hamilton in the valley of the Clyde. The old building was demolished to make
  way for a grandiose eighteenth-century palace; that in turn went when coal
  was discovered beneath the foundations, so no trace remains of the Hamilton
  Of Mary's day. In this Castle she met the Roman Catholic Prelate, Arch bishop
  Hamilton, who had been in the Kirk O'Field mansion with armed men on the
  night of Darnley's murder, who had christened James VI and divorced Bothwell.
  He and the other nobles acknowledged Mary as Queen and it was tacitly under
  stood that the act of abdication was null through being obtained by force.
  The clans answered the call of their chieftains to Mary's standard and the
  country was divided into King's men and Queen's men, although Mary was only a
  pawn in the hands of the Hamiltons who were poor, greedy and incompetent. She
  had no policy save the one policy of power at any cost, but for the moment
  there was an illusion of triumph, of success. She thought that she would be
  Queen again, and even, as the Roman Catholic clansmen gathered, that she
  might yet re-establish the ancient Faith in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Six thousand men had soon mustered at Hamilton. Mary, gracious, gay,
  gallant, rode among them, using all her royal arts to encourage them. She
  sent David Beaton to his brother, the envoy in Paris, to ask help from
  Charles IX&mdash;'a thousand arbusquiers' at once. She wrote also to the
  beloved mentor, the Cardinal of Lorraine, for once excusing herself for past
  errors and follies and promising amends and to live and die a true daughter
  of the Faith; but for the moment she wanted only help. As ever impulsive and
  imprudent, and feeling safe four miles from Castle Drummond and the coast,
  Mary glowed with the thought of those French galleons coming to her aid.
  Moray, then in Glasgow, had nothing like her number of men; he issued his
  call to arms, in the name of the King and 'for the establishment of
  quietness'.</p>

  <p>Mary retorted by a proclamation, partly drawn up by the Hamilton
  Archbishop, partly by herself. It showed her revengeful, vindictive spirit
  and her total lack of prudence in the manner in which it branded her enemies.
  In particular her fury against Moray was expressed in coarse terms; he was
  'beastly traitor', 'bastard gotten in shameful adultery'&mdash;a cruel
  reference to the lady of Lochleven&mdash;while his supporters were
  'pestiferous factions', 'shameless butchers', and retorting on them their
  accusation of the Darnley murder, Mary proclaimed them 'hellhounds, bloody
  tyrants, cut-throats, not even a barbarous Turk could pardon them'. This
  burnt Mary's boats; she could never hope to come to terms with these men. She
  estranged half her kingdom by this bitter outburst that she afterwards
  repudiated.</p>

  <p>The Hamiltons planned to marry the Queen to one of their family and
  hurried on an engagement with the forces of the Lords. On May 12th (1568),
  ten days after Mary's escape from Lochleven, the two armies met at Langside,
  a field near Dumbarton and Hamilton. Mary had no efficient general; her
  commander, Argyll, was disabled by a fit in the onset of the action. Grange,
  leading for Moray, was an excellent soldier and many Hamiltons were slain in
  the first onslaught. Mary, trying to ride among her troops, found them
  fighting one another, and she withdrew to a slope and watched the battle. The
  action was short and decisive. Scotland was saved from a puppet Queen in the
  hands of the Hamiltons, aided by foreign troops, and Mary lost everything
  save life.</p>

  <p>It was to preserve her mere existence that she turned and fled, escorted
  by Lord Herries and sixteen men. They rode without pause to Dumfries, then,
  changing horses, sixty miles to Dundrennan near Kirkcudbright, an agreeable
  little place now termed Queen's Hill, from this incident. It was at a few
  miles from the Dundrennan, at Burnsfoot, a small village, that the exhausted
  fugitives drew rein. They had neither paused nor eaten since they had seen
  the Queen's forces scattered or surrendered at Langside.</p>

  <p>At Dundrennan Mary took a desperate decision, one that the direction of
  her flight showed had been in her mind during her ride. She intended to
  escape into England. There was nowhere else she could go. At Lochleven she
  had openly yearned for a French convent or asylum with her grandmother at
  Joinville. But Catherine de Medici was hostile, France was in a state of
  civil war, the Guises were no longer in power; there was not even any means
  of getting to France. The faithful Seton had been lost to her at Langside,
  but Herries was still with the Queen and suggested that she should 'remain in
  Scotland and trust to a better fortune'. Mary replied that she could not
  trust anyone; her courage had broken; her second defeat in the field reminded
  her of her first and the night in the Provost House. She wrote an appealing
  letter to Elizabeth, who had championed her against the Lords, and enclosed
  the diamond Elizabeth had once sent her in token of friendship, for some of
  her jewels had been restored to her by the Hamiltons. The little party then
  set out towards Terrgeles, Lord Herries' house, his knowledge of the wild
  country enabling him to act as guide along obscure tracks. Here another hasty
  consultation was held; but a flight to England was the only possible course
  for Mary.</p>

  <p>Moray's troops would be in pursuit and this time, after her proclamation,
  she could not hope even for the leniency shown her by the Lochleven
  imprisonment. The fugitive was in great fear; she refused to go to bed and
  spent the night on a stool in the thickness of wall built as a place of
  concealment. In the morning the Queen and a few followers went to the shores
  of the Solway, where Lord Herries hired a fishing boat, and after a four
  hours' crossing they reached Workington, in England, at six o'clock in the
  evening on May 16th, 1568. Mary herself described the flight from Langside to
  Dumfries, from Dumfries to Dundrennan, in a letter to the Cardinal of
  Lorraine&mdash;'I have endured injuries, calumnies, imprisonment, famine,
  cold, heat, flight, sixty-two miles across country without supping or
  alighting. And then I have had to sleep upon the ground and drink sour milk
  and eat oatmeal without bread and have been three nights, like the owls,
  without a female in this country.'</p>

  <p>There is no clear account of Mary's last journey in Scotland. Langside
  took place on May 12th&mdash;by May 16th (evening) she was across the Solway;
  how she got there and how those four days were spent she herself did not
  know. One account gives Sandquhar as the first halt, after a night ride from
  Langside; from thence to Terrgeles where she 'rested a few days' and then
  embarked at Dundrennan. Others make Dundrennan the first stop after Langside.
  In either case it is difficult to fit in 'the sleep on the ground' and the
  rough food, with the sixty miles (accord ing to some, ninety miles) without
  alighting or supping, and the three nights 'like the owls', i.e. in the open,
  with 'a few days' rest at Terrgeles. There was time to pause at Dundrennan
  Abbey to send on the letter, by one of the party going ahead, to Elizabeth.
  Mary was herself in a confusion as to this wild ride and those who try to
  follow her will find it difficult to do so. Sixty miles was a feat for any
  horse without a pause on rough cross-country ways; the tracks Mary took have
  long since vanished and modern roads are no guides to sixteenth-century
  travel. Moreover, the cavalcade turned and twisted through the dark (as far
  as it is dark in a Scots May) to avoid pursuit. But thirty miles should have
  seen them at Sandquhar and another</p>

  <p>twenty, with fresh horses, at Dumfries; ten miles more to Burnsfoot on the
  banks of the Solway; sixty miles, but not without 'pause or sup'. This might
  take a night and a day. Then a rest at Dundrennan, the letter to England
  written and another night ride to the Herries' house, Terrgeles; then a
  sojourn there (May 14th) of one day only and a return to the banks of the
  Solway for the crossing in the afternoon of May 16th. Still we do not account
  for the three nights in the open, the coarse meals of 'sour milk', etc., or
  the sixty-, or ninety-, mile ride. The modern traveller can find his way by
  various routes from Hamilton, the site of Langside, to Sandquhar, Dumfries
  and Dundrennan. It is now an easy and agreeable journey and includes two
  places' not hitherto visited in this tracing of Mary's journeys.</p>

  <p>Sandquhar, with the ruins of a castle, is on the route from Glasgow to
  Carlisle. Dumfries is already described. Dundrennan is famous for the ruins
  of the abbey that housed Mary during her last night in Scotland; the son of
  her host, Lord Herries, was the last abbot of this twelfth-century Cistercian
  foundation. Much of magnificence remains in ruined transepts, windows,
  doorways and tombs, and an impressive view of the noble, mutilated buildings
  can be seen from the low hills above the valley. The spire that rose at the
  intersection of the cruciform church has gone with much else, but enough
  remains for an impression of grandeur. Mary rested here for a short
  while&mdash;and prayed here, the last time she was to worship in a church of
  her own Faith. For the sake of this association as well as its own Dundrennan
  (The Hill of Thorns) should be visited. Several days could be pleasantly
  spent in following up and down the various ways by which Mary is reported to
  have reached the shores of the Solway; but it was an infernal ride for the
  ruined Queen. If the sixty-ninety miles ride, the sleeping on the ground, and
  so on, were created in her mind from merely trivial incidents, that does not
  lessen the terror that inspired her frantic description. The same
  question&mdash;that of distance from one point to another&mdash;arises when
  considering any of the other famous rides of Mary, Queen of Scots. The roads
  and tracks she travelled have, in almost every case, disappeared. What is now
  an easy afternoon excursion was, in the sixteenth century, a horseback ride
  of many hours. In many instances the going would be rough, over heathery
  moorland, with possibly unreliable guides and without adequate accommodation
  for obtaining relays of horses. Allowance must also be made for tired beasts,
  foul weather and the short northern days. Modern travelling on foot or
  horseback in Scotland is usually undertaken in the brief summer, but some of
  Mary's journeys were made in winter and storm, as was her wild dash to
  Bothwell from Jedburgh to Hermitage. To ride at such a pace over rough,
  unknown country treacherous with obstacles such as swamps and boulders would
  seem incredible if it were not well attested. Mary's sole recorded accident
  is the slipping of her horse in the mud or morass.</p>

  <p>The escape from Lochleven, the muster at Langside and the final confused
  flight to the borders of the Solway were under taken when Mary had recently
  been in a low state of health and barely recovered from the illness,
  miscarriage or abortion, that had afflicted her in prison. Though in good
  spirits, and whether she was twenty, thirty, or forty hours in the saddle,
  and no matter how many nights she spent sleeping on the heather, and how many
  sitting awake in Terrgeles, the journey remains a considerable feat.</p>

  <p>With Edinburgh, St. Andrews and Inverness as head quarters, the places
  that Queen Mary visited, with such toil and pain and in circumstances always
  disturbed and often tragic, may be seen at ease and leisure by any mode of
  travel the curious investigator prefers. A short time would suffice to have
  at least a glance at the scenery, the towns, the castles, the palaces that
  formed the background for Mary's personal life during her reign of six years;
  a long time would allow a close inspection of all that remains connected with
  Mary Stewart, including visits to such museums of relics as that housed in
  the Queen's House, Jedburgh, and some inspection of the rich national
  collections in Edinburgh and other large cities.</p>

  <p>From time to time exhibitions of objects once belonging to Queen Mary, now
  privately owned, are held. Scotland possesses many such treasures; love and
  zeal, loyalty and patriotism gathered together and hoarded a large number of
  the rare and beautiful things in which Mary delighted. Some of them are
  worked by her own hand, and some, such as the toddling reins she made for her
  son, his cradle, a death-head watch, given by her to John Knox, and a prayer
  book held by her on the scaffold, have an extremely poignant interest. The
  portraits also, both of Mary herself and her contemporaries, though few of
  them have any artistic value, are of importance in at least giving us an
  impression of what these personages might have looked like when in full dress
  array. Unfortunately the painter's lack of skill and his concentration on
  costume and ornament instead of character usually defeats curiosity. The
  extreme formality of these portraits, where the humanity of the subject is
  reduced to a symbol of royalty, pomp, power or beauty, is misleading and Mary
  in particular is falsely represented by these stiff, stately portrayals. We
  see nothing of the fascination of the woman with the 'alluring grace' who
  wept, laughed, talked and gesticulated so eagerly and so graciously, with
  that attractive bold freedom that, however, allowed no one to forget her
  obsession with her descent from Henry VII and her position as Queen Regnant
  of Scotland and Queen Dowager of France, as well as self-regarded heiress of
  England.</p>

  <p>But undoubtedly the most impressive way of regaining the atmosphere of
  Mary's reign is by visiting the magnificent rock castles and lake-side
  palaces that were the scenes of her brief dramas, and by travelling at
  leisure over the country, itself still unchanged in atmosphere, and largely
  in appearance, after nearly four centuries. Some cities, such as Glasgow,
  have entirely lost their ancient character; industrialization has altered
  most of the towns and villages Mary knew. Some have gone, but the landscape,
  the climate, remains. Much of Edinburgh and other cities can be
  reconstructed, if sufficient sympathy and patience is employed. The vast deer
  forests, the remote lakes, the hills and the moors look to us as they looked
  to her when she escaped to them for 'clean air'.</p>

  <p>Her superb palaces and mighty fortalices are mostly ruins, but as such
  they have a pathos and majesty they did not possess in the days of their
  glory that were also days of squalor, dirt, crime and ignorance. Linlithgow,
  four-square beside the lake, midway between Edinburgh and Stirling, cannot
  fail to please. Apart from the fact that it was the birthplace of Queen Mary,
  it was the scene of many events in Scots history that have been graced by
  ballad and legend. This was the setting for some of the most brilliant and
  gay of the episodes in the lives of the Stewart Kings, and still, in
  mutilation, shows their splendour and their taste in device of Royal Arms and
  Thistle battlement and chapel. When Mary of Guise was married at Linlithgow
  she declared it was 'the most princely place' she had ever beheld. The modern
  aspect of the room in which she bore her daughter is a sad commentary on this
  remark; this large apartment is now open to the sky.</p>

  <p>A piquant tradition attaches to the black greyhound tied to a tree that is
  the badge of the town of Linlithgow. It is supposed to represent a witch who
  in this disguise haunted the neighbour hood; the common sense of the matter
  is that it is a symbol of the immense royal hunting grounds near by.
  Stirling, much resembling Edinburgh, has not either such a tranquil aspect or
  such a peaceful history as Linlithgow. It is thirty-five miles from the
  capital (Mary's birthplace being but fifteen miles); the name was formerly
  'Stryreling' and as such is often written in the records of Mary's time. Its
  bitter history gained it the name of <i>Mons Dolorum</i>. At one time a
  'Round Table' was kept in this imposing fortress; here Mary of Guise held her
  courts and councils and here her daughter was crowned; here Mary ruined
  Darnley and intrigued for her second marriage, which took place in the
  chapel; here her son was baptized. Stirling looks most impressive viewed from
  the spot known as the Back Walk; from there rock, bastions and Palace rise
  sombrely into the air with a powerful effect of that melancholy inseparable
  from deserted dwellings. More pleasing are the modest ruins of Inchmahome,
  'the island of rest', where witches once flew about on bulrushes and fairies
  planted trees, where the little Queen and her four Marys spent two years of
  happiness.</p>

  <p>Much has been written of Holyrood in the text of this volume; it is
  obvious that even a brief account of the Palace of Holyrood House would
  require and has received the close attention of historians and antiquaries.
  The Abbey Church is one of the most interesting ruins in Europe and the
  collections of portraits, furniture and other articles in Holyrood are best
  examined under the guidance of an expert. Many have more a legendary than a
  historical value.</p>

  <p>Craigmillar, in Mary's time three miles out of the capital, is another
  place of legends. One of these is attached to the memory of a farm on the
  estate that was burned in revenge, the spot being till recently named
  <i>Burnt Dool</i>. It was to Craigmillar that Mary came with Bothwell, as
  High Sheriff of the Border, after her progress from Berwick-on-Tweed to
  Dunbar, and there that the crooked councils were held that led to the murder
  of Darnley. Mary's room, as shown, is in one of the upper turrets. This is a
  small closet such as she usually occupied, but many other rooms in the castle
  now destroyed may have also been hers. The view from this room is still fine,
  but Mary looked over dense woods with hills and Edinburgh Castle in the back
  ground. Craigmillar was always noted for what the nineteenth-century writers
  term 'a truly romantic effect'. Edinburgh Castle is a subject in itself, and,
  although her son was born there, has no great connection with Mary. It was a
  most familiar sight to her and her refuge in times of peril but it is more
  associated with the politics of her reign than her personal history. The
  'Honours of Scotland' kept in the Castle include the crown held over the
  infant Mary.</p>

  <p>Nine miles from the city and a mile from the sea are the ruins of Seton
  (Seaton) on the Firth of Forth and easily visited from Tranent and Long
  Niddry. The foundations are ancient; it was burnt by the English while Mary
  was in France and rebuilt by Lord Seton in the most elegant style of the
  moment, which was that of George Heriot's Hospital in Edinburgh. This house
  was superbly decorated and had galleries filled with paintings and curios in
  the French fashion. There were ramparts, defence towers and a collegiate
  church. On Mary's return to Scotland she went frequently to this splendid
  mansion that much resembled the elegant dwellings of the Valois Kings and she
  allowed it to be named the Palace of Seton. The Queen used Seton much as she
  had used Joinville, for pleasure, sport and a restful retreat. Lord Seton
  helped Mary to escape from Lochleven, fled abroad after Langside and, brought
  to penury for a time, became a waggoner in Flanders.</p>

  <p>Niddry Castle, West Niddry or Seton Niddry, was built by the same noble
  family and only a tower is left. Mary paused here between Lochleven and
  Langside. The ruin is ten miles from Edinburgh and not to be confused with
  Long Niddry in Haddingtonshire.</p>

  <p>Falkland Castle and Palace in Fife, at the foot of East Lomond, was the
  scene of the death of James V at the age of thirty years. Here Mary had a
  hunting park three miles in extent. The ruins have a majestic air of courtly
  magnificence; the audience chamber is well preserved but the forest has gone
  and the gardens are now ploughed land.</p>

  <p>Burntiesland&mdash;Breuntsland, etc.&mdash;was originally a peel tower or
  keep, and belonged in Mary's day to Grange&mdash;Sir William Kirkcaldy of
  Grange who took his patronym from the village of Grange. Here she often
  stayed when making a progress in Fife; here also was long shown the State
  bedchamber that was the scene of the Chastelard episode.</p>

  <p>Dumbarton&mdash;reputed birthplace of Saint Patrick&mdash;is one of the
  most dramatic castles even in Scotland; the rocky situation rising above the
  sea is grimly impressive. Mary was first there before she embarked for
  France; afterwards on many occasions. The scenery round Dumbarton is as
  majestic as the mighty building.</p>

  <p>Mary visited Hermitage once only and for a few hours, but the ruin is so
  extraordinary and the association with her story so poignantly personal that
  it is worth the effort needed to reach this secluded place. James Hepburn,
  Earl Bothwell, inherited Hermitage, together with his titles that made him,
  save for Châtelherault (Hamilton), the most powerful chieftain in the South
  of Scotland; and the Castle became his main residence as Lieutenant of the
  Border.</p>

  <p>Mary's house in Jedburgh is the most charming and domestic of her Scots
  residences; it was once thatched and is vaulted like the fatal Provost House
  in Kirk O'Field. An ancient account of the famous ride from Jedburgh to
  Hermit age gives this itinerary, adding 'it is utterly incredible how she
  contrived it in one day'. The route is not by the Slithercrick road but
  between that and the Teviot, up Priesthaugh swire, between Pencryst and
  Skelfhill, through a long boggy track called Haecklass, along a mountain
  stream to a ridge where Liddesdale begins, then a descent down Braidlieswire
  to a low piece of marshy ground where her horse nearly sank, up and down
  other steep hills and across burns until Hermitage water was reached.
  Following this the Queen arrived at Hermitage after 'one of the most
  impractical and hazardous journeys that ever were achieved' and back the same
  way after a few hours' pause.</p>

  <p>Borthwick is, in contrast, a beautiful Castle of just pro portions, well
  built and pleasantly situate by a small stream. Among the ruined chambers is
  one pointed out as that used by Queen Mary. From Borthwick she escaped,
  dressed as a cavalier, took a path through the glen east of Affeck Hill and
  met Bothwell at Black Castle. This route is nearly that of the first railway.
  Black Castle itself is a lovely tower by a stream not far from the great
  London road and fourteen miles from Edinburgh. When Mary, 'booted and
  spurred' ('butet and spurret'), arrived here the surrounding country was a
  barren waste and she, alone, had had to pass through trackless glens. Black
  Castle shows a room she occupied with a closet in the wall.</p>

  <p>On leaving this retreat Mary proceeded by Fala and the north side of the
  Lammermuirs until she reached Dunbar, then the most important fortalice and
  arsenal in Scotland, situated on a reef, the sea in some places running into
  caverns beneath the Castle. Mary's gift of Dunbar to Bothwell was one of her
  most detested actions; to Dunbar Bothwell took her after her capture at
  Cramond (Almond River) and there Bothwell stayed after Langside until he fled
  to Spynie. Dunbar is now little more than a heap of stones, reddish in
  colour. Traces of an apartment are shown as marking the outlines of Mary's
  room, and the fallen masonry stands on basaltic columns resembling the
  Giants' Causeway in Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>The peaceful ruins of Lochleven Castle are all that is left of the
  agreeable residence of Sir William Douglas, where Mary spent many days of
  holiday repose and where she had her one amiable interview with John Knox.
  There also she was a prisoner, and signed under duress her act of abdication;
  from there she made her futile attempt to escape, disguised as a laundress,
  and from there she did finally escape only to see all lost, without a blow
  being struck in her cause, at Langside.</p>

  <p>Until drained over a century ago, Lochleven water was twelve miles in
  circumference. There are three islands besides that on which the Castle
  stands, a fortress, placed in the lake for purpose of defence, and, owing to
  its isolated position, frequently used as a prison. The scene is lonely but
  there is nothing desolate about this solitude; the barbicans, keeps, gates
  and ancient trees give an air of gentle melancholy to a spot gracefully set
  off by the Lomonds on one side and the tranquil fields of Kinross on the
  other. The ruins of Mary's chamber and chapel can still be seen. Here she
  wrote her piteous letters of complaint, excusing her poor writing because her
  eyes were inflamed from weeping, and here she won over her jailors, including
  the mother of Moray, so that she was able to slip away without much trouble.
  A small enclosure, now weed-grown, represents Mary's garden, and some of the
  keys that Willie Douglas threw into the lake after locking all the doors
  behind him were recovered in 1805, others in 1831. Though much damaged, these
  keys showed exquisite workman ship. A cane with an ivory and silver mount was
  also found in the lake and is believed to be Mary's sceptre.</p>

  <p>Crookston (or Cruxton) Castle, about three miles from Paisley, was one of
  the seats of the Lordship of Darnley, and there Mary went with her second
  husband soon after her marriage. A ballad and a tradition celebrated a yew
  tree under which the lovers met; one of the early medals of Mary and Darnley
  (<i>Maria et Henricus</i>) bears on the reverse a crowned yew tree that
  symbolizes the advancement of the family of Lennox by Darnley's marriage.
  This Crookston yew was of fabulous size and celebrity; it decayed with the
  fall of the House of Stewart and the wood was used to make numerous highly
  prized relics.</p>

  <p>Dundrennan Abbey is the last place where Mary rested in Scotland. It is in
  a bleak position, but the country round is varied and splendid. Short walks
  will disclose different views of the Solway and the Cumberland hills. In the
  extreme distance the Isle of Man and the Mourne Mountains can be seen on a
  clear day. The nearby shore is strange and beautiful. A pleasing and highly
  romantic account of Mary's last ride in Scotland states that on her flight of
  sixty miles from Langside to Dundrennan she passed through the wild country
  of Glenkesis and paused at a cottage at the head of the Vale of Tarff. While
  her followers were cutting down and throwing into the Dee the ancient wooden
  bridge by which she had crossed the Queen accepted bread and milk from the
  cottager, thanking her with gracious humility and asking Lord Herries to give
  the poor woman the cottage as a token of royal gratitude. The Herries family
  long cherished the rose silk reins embroidered with Scots emblems, intended
  for her son, that Mary was said to have left behind at Terrgeles.</p>

  <p>From the Abbey she went along a quiet valley for about a mile and a half
  to a creek set about with rocks. This was long celebrated, in verse and
  prose, as the fatal spot where the misguided Queen, disregarding the advice
  of her friends, decided to throw herself on the chivalry of Elizabeth. The
  truth is more commonplace: Mary was fleeing for her life. She had nowhere to
  go save across the Solway, and she went with mischief as her intention. She
  was quite aware that she had an enemy in the most powerful person in France,
  Catherine de Medici, and that such a dangerous and important person as
  herself could never be allowed to retire into a French convent as she had
  said she wished to do. Nor had she, brilliant, beautiful, passionate, royal
  and twenty-six years of age, the least intention of leaving the world. Her
  journey to England was not only a desperate means of saving her life, it was
  another move in the long game she played with Elizabeth Tudor.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-4"
     id="ch-4"></a><i>Part IV.</i><br>
  ENGLAND 1568-1587</h2>

  <p class="first">Mary arrived at Workington on the coast of Cumberland on May
  16th (1568). Workington, situate a mile from the sea, on the Derwent, was
  then a small fishing village and is now an important centre for coal and
  iron. Lord Herries had sent messengers ahead, announcing her arrival, and she
  was honour ably received by the Curwens whose mansion, Workington Hall, was
  outside the village. Mary, who was without money or a change of clothes, at
  once wrote to Elizabeth, once more stating her case with dignity and pathos,
  requesting an immediate interview: 'I have nothing in the world but what I
  had on my person when I made my escape.'</p>

  <p>Mary did not long remain in this sad condition. The Earl of Northumberland
  announced her arrival in England to the Council of York. That body had
  already received instructions from London: Mary and her Scots were to be used
  honourably but not one of them was to escape. Mary moved to Cockermouth Hall,
  where her host, Henry Fletcher, gave her thirteen yards of crimson velvet and
  treated her with great courtesy. She was still so alarmed that she could not
  sleep but sat up all night, alert, in a closet. She was soon moved, by order
  of the High Sheriff acting on instructions from London, to Carlisle Castle;
  the Governor, the seventh Earl of Northumberland, was believed to be
  over-well disposed towards Mary and she was put in charge of the Deputy
  Governor, Sir Richard Lowther. She was treated with regal honours and Lady
  Scrope, sister of the Duke of Norfolk, sent to wait on her. Several Scots
  supporters soon found her, among them members of the loyal families of
  Livingstone and Fleming, Bishop Lesley and the faithful Mary Seton, the only
  unmarried 'Queen's Mary'; she brought some clothes and feminine appointments
  with her and soon amused the notables who came to wait on the Queen with her
  cleverness in dressing Mary's hair and in devising her perukes, Mary praising
  her as 'the cleverest busker I know'.</p>

  <p>Mary held a Court at Carlisle and freely received those who came to see
  her. Among them was the premier peer of England, Thomas Howard, fourth Duke
  of Norfolk, but the ruined Queen suffered from many handicaps, the most
  severe being that of language. She was fluent in French only; she had learned
  a little Scots, which she spoke haltingly with a marked accent. English she
  hardly knew at all; to those who did not speak French she had to help herself
  out with gestures, broken phrases and the smiles of her expressive face.
  Everyone who saw her was impressed by her courage, her charms and the gaiety
  that could rise above the terrors of her situation. She set herself to please
  and was successful; the Duke of Norfolk in particular was fascinated by this
  woman so lovely, so lively, so fallen and, as he believed, so wronged.</p>

  <p>Mary's arrival in Cumberland put Elizabeth and her advisers in a cruel
  dilemma, nor were their feelings of exasperation eased by learning that she
  was already so popular in the North. In order to gain time Lord Scrope,
  Warden of the West Marches, and Sir Francis Knollys, his vice-chamberlain,
  were sent to watch Mary. Lord Herries met them on their way and loyally
  stressed the misfortunes of his mistress, asserted her innocence of all the
  charges made against her and appealed to them for sympathy and help. But the
  two Englishmen had not come with precise instructions; they were merely to
  observe and report.</p>

  <p>Carlisle Castle was, even in Mary's time, old and famous; it was, like
  most of the royal residences to which Mary was used; a fort, a palace and a
  prison. Her apartments were no more gloomy than those to which she was
  accustomed and they were fitted up with all the luxury available. Mary's
  spirits rose. Within two weeks of her escape from Lochleven and her defeat at
  Langside her ambitions&mdash;never lost sight of&mdash;were again aroused;
  she could play her double game very comfortably from English soil. Her
  life-long plans of coaxing Elizabeth into declaring her heiress of England on
  the one hand, and on the other intriguing with Catholic Europe and Catholic
  Englishmen and Scots to dethrone Elizabeth by force, could very well be
  worked from the south of the Border. Despite her tragic failures she had
  great confidence in her charm, energy, wit and skill. She believed that if
  she could see Elizabeth she could persuade that monarch&mdash;her only friend
  in Europe&mdash;into becoming her champion and then, when Elizabeth had put
  her back on the Scots throne and Mary had wiped out the Protestant Lords,
  there would, on the strength of that success, be a fine opportunity of
  ousting Elizabeth and restoring, with the help of France and Spain, the
  ancient Faith in England as well as Scotland.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth perfectly understood Mary's mind. She relied on wise
  counsellors, Cecil, Walsingham, as Mary had once relied on Moray and
  Maitland. Elizabeth had contrived to keep her favourites and her statesmen
  separate; she had survived the Dudley-Robsart scandal because she had not
  married Leicester; she had kept Cecil (as Mary might have kept Moray) by not
  marrying at all; and she had the enormous strength of patriotism. She and her
  counsellors did consider the interests of England&mdash;save for the small
  Roman Catholic minority&mdash;as Mary had never considered Scotland or the
  interests of her people, and they did have the country behind them. Elizabeth
  followed her usual policy of 'fast and loose'; it was the only policy that
  prudence permitted. She knew Mary was her most dangerous enemy, who had never
  abated the pretensions that went with the assumption of the English royal
  arms, who had never ratified the Treaty of Edinburgh and who had never gone
  beyond fulsome flatteries in the way of friendship. Elizabeth had given Mary
  wise advice that Mary had rejected. Elizabeth had menaced the rebellious
  Lords and expressed anger at their treatment of their Queen, but she had
  never offered Mary an asylum or an army to restore her to her throne. Mary
  had now taken the first and expected the second, or at least a safe conduct
  into France.</p>

  <p>It was out of the question for Elizabeth to attempt to restore a Roman
  Catholic sovereign by force in Scotland. The feeling against Mary and against
  her religion was as strong in England as it was in Scotland, and even if it
  had been possible it was not Elizabeth's policy to have a strong Roman
  Catholic power the other side of the Border. The Protestant Regent and
  Protestant infant James VI suited Elizabeth very well; the first was her
  pensioner, the second might one day be her heir.</p>

  <p>To send Mary to France was to place a weapon in the hands of her enemies..
  The Bothwell marriage (with Bothwell a prisoner in Norway) might easily be
  annulled and Mary married to a French or Spanish prince who would invade
  Scotland to restore her; to keep her in England was not at all to Elizabeth's
  liking. Mary was an obvious danger spot, a focus for plots, rebellions and
  intrigues; particularly so since she was known to be without personal or
  political scruples and to be possessed of an extraordinary fascination. But
  to keep Mary in England and delay action, under one excuse or another, seemed
  the only course, and in order to detain her as a prisoner it was necessary to
  support the charges against her. She must be held to be guilty of the murder
  of Darnley. The first hint that Elizabeth intended to take this view was
  given to Lord Herries by Scrope and Knollys; Elizabeth could not receive Mary
  until she was proved innocent of this crime. This obviously Mary could not be
  unless she was put on trial, and as a sovereign princess 'by the grace of
  God' owing no allegiance to any earthly power she could not be put on trial
  or subjected to any law.</p>

  <p>Scrope and Knollys brought condolences and friendly wishes from Elizabeth,
  and Mary, receiving them in the audience chamber of her apartments in
  Carlisle Castle, put her case with passion, ardour and skill. Knollys, an
  acute observer, reported that Mary had 'an eloquent tongue and a discreet
  head, a stout courage and a liberal heart'.</p>

  <p>Mary, with tears, exclaimed against the cruelty of refusing her an
  interview with Elizabeth; and she added that if Elizabeth would not help her
  against the Lords she would demand a safe conduct to the Continent so that
  she could rouse the King of France or the King of Spain in her cause. On
  sending this report to Elizabeth Knollys added some wise advice. It would not
  look well if Mary was detained against her will. Yet if she stayed she would
  become a centre of sedition; she had charmed too many of Elizabeth's subjects
  already. She did not want to return to Scotland, unless it was to escape
  again to France. Would it not be wise, Knollys hinted, to allow this
  dangerous, unbidden guest to be so loosely kept that by means of some ladders
  or knotted towels she could return to Scotland (<i>en route</i> for France),
  where Moray would, surely, this time make an end of the business?</p>

  <p>A few days later Knollys, writing to Cecil, summed up Mary as 'a notable
  woman'. He reported her boldness, her familiar manners, her constant chatter,
  her love of courage and hardihood, her readiness to affront any peril in the
  hope of victory, her vindictiveness&mdash;she cared for little else, Knollys
  observed, save revenge on her enemies and for that object would spare
  nothing. Knollys repeated his opinion that she should be got rid of, 'not
  nourished in one's own bosom', or else she should be 'halted and disembled
  with', i.e. with such an opponent the only course was to play for time, a
  course on which Cecil had already decided.</p>

  <p>Later Knollys, again to Cecil, emphasized his point. No truce, compromise
  or half-and-half measures would satisfy Mary. She was not to be 'talked over'
  or 'managed', she scorned flattering or glozing speeches, she would not be
  'staid by courtesy or bridled by straw', she had 'a bloody appetite' and 'a
  fiery stomach' for the blood of her enemies.</p>

  <p>Mary was already irking at her detention in Carlisle; she would not go
  further into England. She would raise men with her French dowry; her heir
  apparent, Châtelherault, would be told to use all her treasure in her cause.
  Knollys felt like 'a blind buzzard' in the presence of this royal rage. He
  pointed out, however, to Cecil that Mary was still nominally wealthy and
  powerful and might yet bring the French into Scotland; it would be prudent to
  make her pay her own expenses while in England, thus lessening her reserves.
  Her dowry, Knollys thought, was £12,000 a year.</p>

  <p>Mary, while putting on such a haughty front towards the English
  commissioners, was writing to Charles IX in her usual strain of pitiful
  lamentation at the injustice with which she was being treated. On June 21st
  (1568) an envoy from Charles IX arrived at Carlisle and was received by Mary.
  He went on to London to see Elizabeth; and that same day Knollys wrote again
  to Cecil describing Mary's threatening attitude: have made great wars in
  Scotland and I pray to God that I make no troubles in other realms'&mdash;'I
  shall seek aid at the hands of other Princes, hands that will help
  me'&mdash;'I would have not fair words but deeds'&mdash;'If you keep me a
  prisoner you shall have much ado of me'&mdash;'I can sell my right and there
  be those that will buy it.'</p>

  <p>Mary had other, no less bitter, causes of complaint. Moray had sent three
  chests of her goods from Lochleven to Carlisle, but the only gown was a
  despised taffeta garment; the rest of the stuff was: 'belts, cloaks and
  coverings for saddles and sleeves and partlets and coifs and such trinkets'.
  Knollys sent in haste to Moray for Mary's other clothes; he complained that
  she neither paid the charges of these journeys nor fee'd the messengers.
  Everything had to go to Elizabeth's account while Mary saved her money to
  raise war in Scotland.</p>

  <p>While Mary was thus behaving with bold defiance in Carlisle, Moray's man,
  John Wood, was in London showing Elizabeth the letters and documents found in
  the silver-gilt casket discovered under Bothwell's bed in Edinburgh Castle.
  Moray intended these letters as a counter-blast to Mary's appeals and
  threats. These documents, known as the 'casket letters', are the subject of
  one of the most lively historical controversies existing.</p>

  <p>The 'casket letters', however, are a puzzle and a mystery only if we
  accept them as forgeries. If we allow that Mary wrote them the only strange
  details in the episode are the facts that Bothwell kept such dangerous
  documents and left them behind when he departed from Edinburgh Castle. Such
  apparent carelessness may be accounted for, however, by his wish to keep
  written evidence of Mary's complicity in the murder of Darnley and that he
  forgot the famous 'casket' in the hurry and anxiety of his affairs.</p>

  <p>There had been, from the date of Mary's signing of the Act of abdication,
  rumours that the Lords had 'written evidence' or 'evidence in her own
  handwriting' against her, and that their threat of the exposure of this
  evidence had obliged her to sign away her crown. Mary, on the other hand, had
  declared that Lord Lindsay, supported by his companions, had threatened to
  cut her throat and throw her into the lake and that she had signed on this
  compulsion. Moray had told the Spanish Ambassador in London of this written
  evidence proving Mary to have been a party to the murder of her husband; he
  gave a rough summary of a letter from Mary to Bothwell that agrees with what
  was afterwards known as the Glasgow Letter No. 2. On June 10th, six days
  after the Queen surrendered at Carberry Hill, the casket was brought to
  Morton, who opened and inspected its contents in the presence of the Lords.
  These men included not only those themselves suspected of conniving at the
  murder, but such respectable nobles as Mar and Atholl, (the latter a Roman
  Catholic and both inclined to favour the Queen), who had no reason whatever
  for wishing to blast Mary's reputation. As it is certain that these two
  nobles could not have helped forge or tamper with the letters, any such work
  must have been done in the six days between the departure of Bothwell from
  Edinburgh and the inspection by the Lords. Neither Atholl nor Mar made any
  protest about the letters and they were accepted as genuine and left in the
  custody of Morton. The matter was kept secret as Mary was the King's mother
  and her open disgrace was not desired; the Protestant Lords wished to be rid
  of her with as little scandal as possible.</p>

  <p>When, however, Moray learned that Mary was stirring up all the mischief
  she could in England and trying to rouse Elizabeth to restore her to her
  throne by force, he sent this John Wood to London with Scots copies of the
  French originals. Moray had had bitter experience of the uncertainty of
  Elizabeth's temper and he knew how angry she had been at the treatment a
  'sister queen' had received from her subjects. He therefore wished to sound
  her mind about the 'casket letters' before he made them public. They were his
  sole justification for forcing Mary to abdicate and the only means he had of
  persuading Elizabeth that he was not a rebel, but a statesman who had done
  all that was possible to hush up an intolerable scandal. He could not admit
  that Elizabeth was overlord of Scotland; but he was, on and off, her
  pensioner and on her neutrality, if not on her help, depended his ability to
  keep the infant James on the throne and the Protestant religion dominant in
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>The 'casket letters' were also extremely convenient to Moray and the other
  Lords in that they fastened the guilt of the Darnley murder on Mary and
  Bothwell. Once these documents were accepted as genuine there would be no
  need for awkward inquiries as to who else was implicated in this notorious
  crime. Moray strengthened his position by arresting some underlings who had
  had a hand in the Kirk O'Field tragedy. These men were Hay of Tala, Bowton,
  Powrie and Dalgliesh, Bothwell's servant, who, under threat of torture, had
  told Morton where to find the 'casket letters'. All confessed, but not to the
  actual murder. Powrie had helped carry the powder to the Provost's House,
  Tala had seen it placed in the room (that occupied by Mary) under Darnley's
  chamber. On the scaffold they incriminated not only Mary and Bothwell, but
  Huntly, Argyll and Maitland. Lennox, the vigorous and implacable enemy of
  Mary, supplied a mass of material that George Buchanan, afterwards tutor to
  the little King, put together into a diatribe against the Queen he had once
  so admired, finally entitled <i>Detectio Mariae Reginae</i>, that was a
  powerful weapon in the hands of her enemies, though modern research has
  proved that this great scholar, reformer and humanist not only stated the
  case for the Lords with unbecoming vehemence but that he was inaccurate in
  many of his details. This has much discredited the entire work and so has
  proved of service to Mary's memory.</p>

  <p>It was exactly a year after the Lords had inspected the letters that John
  Wood put copies of them before Elizabeth; they had been viewed in a secret
  session of the Scots Parliament, as is proved by the statement made by the
  Lords at Dumbarton on September 12th (1568). The contents of the casket
  consisted of: a promise (in French) by Mary of marriage to Bothwell (no
  date); a marriage contract in Scots, alleged to have been drawn up by Huntly
  and subscribed by Mary and Bothwell, dated from Seton, seven days before
  Bothwell's mock trial and nineteen days before Mary was abducted; nine
  letters, in French, from Mary to Bothwell and some French verses of a
  commonplace kind such as Court poetasters supplied on demand. The two letters
  that prove Mary to have lured Darnley to his, death, Nos. 1 and 2, were
  written from Glasgow; Nos. 6, 7, and 8 were written from Stirling and prove
  that Mary planned the false abduction and captivity in Dunbar. The others are
  compromising but not to the same extent.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth, on receiving copies of these letters, acted with her usual
  caution and with the advice of Cecil. She suggested to Moray that the next
  meeting of the Scots Parliament (where 'the great matter' of the Queen of
  Scots would be debated) should be suspended and that a commission of Scots
  and English Lords should be appointed to examine the 'casket letters'. Moray
  instructed Wood to show his copies privately to the commissioners and to
  learn from them the mind of Elizabeth. The Conference was arranged to be held
  at York in the last week of October, and on September 16th Moray himself with
  other Lords came to England with the casket, the original French letters and
  other documents.</p>

  <p>Mary had been told of this proceeding and had agreed to the Conference,
  but she had at once declared that if the Lords produced any alleged letters
  of hers that incriminated her&mdash;they were forgeries, adding that there
  were a number of people in Scotland who knew her handwriting and who would be
  quite capable of forging a copy of it if needful. She had passed the summer
  with increasing uneasiness; her greatest hope lay in Norfolk who was becoming
  more infatuated with her every week that passed. She, also, with expectant
  cunning, hoped that there might be a rising in the Roman Catholic North in
  her favour, but she was deeply vexed by the undisguised captivity in which
  she was now held and by Elizabeth's refusal to see her. She wished she 'had
  broken her arm' before she had come into England, and her letters to
  Elizabeth were couched in angry, bold and dignified strains. Her main
  complaints were that Elizabeth had received Moray, 'my bastard brother', and
  would not receive her, and that she had trusted to Elizabeth's professed
  friendship, even sending her diamond as a token, when she had not needed to
  do so, seeing what powerful allies she had elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth could not write such forcible, clever and effective letters but
  she was quite as adroit. She took her stand on the suspicion of murder under
  which Mary lay and repeated that she could not see her until that was
  removed. Mary's own character, clearly displayed at Carlisle and carefully
  noted by Elizabeth's agents, was against her. She was reported to be a
  brilliant woman, dangerous to her enemies and one very likely to win friends
  by her dramatic appeals and her charm, at once brave and touching. She knew
  how to make the most of her youth and loveliness, how to enlarge on the
  pathos of her situation and the splendour of her birth. At the same time
  Elizabeth's men observed that the Queen of Scots was so strong willed, so
  vindictive, so resolute, so eager for action and adventure, that it did not
  seem in the least likely that she had been a passive, or unwilling, tool in
  the hands of Bothwell. She was not the kind of woman to be abducted or
  married against her will without a protest, and her quick wit, her ability in
  plotting and intriguing, her intense and openly expressed fury against her
  enemies fitted only too well into the part she was accused of playing in the
  murder of her second husband. Skilful as Mary was, she was not skilful enough
  to hide her disposition from these acute reporters. Never for one moment did
  she play the gentle, timid, bewildered, overwhelmed creature, the simple girl
  who was the prey and victim of cruel men; in all she said and did she was
  intelligent, bold, accomplished, full of energy and spirit. What she revealed
  of herself and what was revealed in the 'casket letters' went very well
  together; her very brilliancy damaged her own cause. When Cecil learned what
  manner of woman she was, he decided that she should be kept very close and
  given no chance to exercise her arts. She would rather, she told Knollys,
  that she and all her party were 'hanged' than submit to Moray...she would go
  to Turkey rather than not be avenged on him. Knollys, impressed, despite
  himself, by her passionate eloquence, hinted to Cecil that it would be only
  honest to deal openly with the captive instead of deluding her with 'colours
  and cloaks' that deceived no one. Cecil, however, had England to think of; he
  dare not allow Mary to return to Scotland or go to France, he dare not allow
  her at large in England. Elizabeth, obedient to his policy, played for time.
  French ships swarmed at sea and there were bands of Queen's men on the
  Border; foreign troops might land in England in answer to Mary's desperate
  appeals. Lord Herries, in London to put his mistress's case, had a cold
  reception.</p>

  <p>Mary, a most unwilling prisoner, was moved from Carlisle Castle to Bolton
  Castle, near Richmond, Yorkshire, thus being taken, as she had vowed she
  never would be taken, further into England. Soon after her arrival at her new
  abode she received from Moray the clothes and jewels she had had at
  Lochleven.</p>

  <p>In one of her remarkable letters Mary, writing to Elizabeth, had protested
  that she was not 'dangerous and curst', not 'a chameleon' or 'a basilisk',
  but it was precisely because Cecil was afraid of her that Mary was removed to
  Lord Scrope's Castle at Bolton, now definitely a prisoner.</p>

  <p>Much of the ancient grandeur of Carlisle yet remains and it is still
  possible to view from the ramparts the imposing scene that Mary gazed
  on&mdash;the water meadows by the Eden, the level <i>campagne</i> of Penrith,
  the mountains of Bew Castle and those above which Crossfell and Skiddaw rise
  majestically. On the east the agreeable scene is bounded by the
  Northumberland mountains and to the west is the prospect towards which Mary
  most often turned&mdash;that of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Queen was removed to Bolton Castle on July 28th (1568) and Knollys
  reported that she was 'very quiet, very tractable' and kept a pleasant
  countenance. She was also biding her time, hoping that Norfolk would do
  something for her before long. Knollys found Bolton 'stately, fair', and,
  what was more important, 'very strong'; it was surrounded by a high wall and
  was easily guarded, since there was but one entrance. Mary had by now a
  considerable retinue and Knollys was vexed at the expense of hiring
  carriages, horses and baggage waggons. All Mary's charges were at Elizabeth's
  expense; the journey from Carlisle to Bolton cost fifty-four pounds.</p>

  <p>A few days after she arrived at Bolton, Mary sent yet another dignified,
  graceful and moving appeal to Elizabeth. In a postscript that has, like so
  many of her writings, an air of nobility, Mary entreated that Elizabeth would
  prevent the Scots Parliament from selling her jewels; she was willing,
  however, to give them to Elizabeth; 'between you and me I make no
  difference'.</p>

  <p>The Conference was opened in solemn state at York. Elizabeth was
  represented by the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Sussex and Sir Ralph Sadlyer,
  Mary by Bishop Lesley, Lord Herries, Lord Livingstone and Lord Boyd; the
  Regent, Moray, appeared in person, with Morton, Maitland, Lindsay and the
  Bishop of Orkney for the Lords. A truce was called in the Scots civil war
  while the Conference was held. Mary was not allowed to be present but neither
  was Elizabeth; a graver complaint was that Mary was not sent copies of the
  'casket letters' and had difficulty in communicating with her representatives
  on account of bad weather and bad roads. Since, however, she had nothing to
  say save a blank denial of all charges against her, this was not of much
  moment. Her spokesman, Lord Herries, was lukewarm and made the impression of
  not greatly believing in his own cause. None of his men spoke warmly for Mary
  and none of them had anything to say of the 'casket letters' save that they
  were forgeries.</p>

  <p>Norfolk, who presided, was in an impossible position. Not only was he
  biased in Mary's favour, he hoped to marry her and to share with her the
  throne of Scotland; at the same time, as an honourable man, he was much
  disturbed by the 'casket letters'. Mary, who shortly before had been willing
  to 'go to sea with Bothwell in a boat and drift with the wind's will', was
  now eager to accept this new champion, with whom she was in constant
  communication through his sister, Lady Scrope. Norfolk was very different
  from Bothwell and by no means the dashing, resourceful, valiant kind of man
  Mary liked; but Bothwell was in a Norwegian prison and Norfolk was powerful.
  Mary did not find it hard to accept him as a prospective husband and when
  Moray suggested a compromise, suppression of the 'casket letters',
  confirmation of his own title of Regent and an honourable status for Mary as
  Norfolk's wife and mother of the King of Scots, with suitable revenues, she
  was willing to agree. But Norfolk was not satisfied. He could not bring
  himself to let the 'casket letters' go by default and he did not wish Mary to
  lose her right to the throne of Scotland. His honour was not so nice,
  however, that he could not act at once as Mary's judge and as her protector.
  He advised her to defy her half-brother, which she did, declaring that she
  had evidence as to the Darnley murder against the Lords 'in black and white'.
  This threat was mere bravado; Mary had no evidence against her enemies; for
  the Band that Bothwell had given her after Carberry Hill had been taken from
  her and any other dangerous papers the Lords had naturally destroyed. Moray
  did not much want the Norfolk marriage, though he was willing to accept it
  sooner than civil war. Maitland, on the other hand, worked for it. Always
  inscrutable, this able man appeared to be Mary's friend, yet he said nothing
  about the 'casket letters'. The Queen and her representatives always used
  those blank denials employed by children and criminals that are so
  unimpressive.</p>

  <p>The Conference moved from York to Westminster. Copies of the letters in
  English were now put in by the Lords, together with Morton's account of how
  the originals came into his possession. The Commissioners carefully examined
  the letters that were laid before Cecil and his Council. Cecil, a patient
  man, compared the letters with those Mary sent to Elizabeth and had further
  copies taken. A Latin translation of these letters was given at the end of
  Buchanan's <i>Detectio</i> that was afterwards translated into English.</p>

  <p>At Westminster Lord Herries spoke again for Mary but again half-heartedly,
  as did Bishop Lesley. No one made an effective protest, or offered any proof
  of the letters being forgeries. Moray had several interviews with Elizabeth,
  and against his closely argued case backed by documentary evidence Mary had
  nothing to put forward save generalizations and mere denials. The evidence
  against her was black enough without the 'casket letters'. Her actions had
  spoken for themselves and only the very simple or the very generous could
  believe her wholly innocent of the Darnley murder. The best her defenders
  could ever do for her was to suggest that she had known vaguely of the plot
  and had done nothing to warn the victim. To put forward the argument that she
  had been really reconciled with Darnley at Glasgow, and had brought him from
  the safety of his father's care to a place where he was delivered helpless
  into the hands of his enemies, with the intention of either taking up married
  life with him again or arranging amiably an honourable divorce, was to allow
  that she was simple to imbecility, and that no one who knew Mary could
  allow.</p>

  <p>All of the confederate Lords were capable of forging the letters as far as
  lack of scruples went, and Mary was correct when she said that there were a
  number of penmen in Scotland able to imitate her hand, but to imitate her
  mind and heart was not so easy. Besides, the forger would have had to have
  possessed an intimate knowledge of her affairs and her movements; moreover,
  the work, requiring so much skill, must have been done in a very short time.
  Maitland has been suggested as the forger, but he was the Queen's friend, and
  though possessed, possibly, of the insight into human nature and the literary
  skill needful, he had no reason thus to ruin Mary, nor, ambiguous as his
  actions often were, is there any evidence that he was base enough to do work
  like this.</p>

  <p>Buchanan has also been suggested; this is far-fetched. Not only had the
  Latin scholar no gift for this kind of fiction, he obviously believed the
  letters to be genuine when he published them. Though he was too partial in
  his treatment of Mary, and often careless in his charges, he was not the man
  to commit a gross fraud. Yet a third surmise is that the letters were written
  by Mary but not to Bothwell; perhaps to Darnley (who did not know French), or
  that they were put together from scraps of her diaries and other writings
  found at Holyrood.</p>

  <p>If we want to believe any of this the matter becomes most complicated and
  can be argued about indefinitely. An explanation, for instance, must be
  found, as to how it is that the most important letter No. 2 (really No. 1)
  agrees with Crauford's deposition i.e. with the account Crauford gave to his
  master, Lennox, of his meeting with Mary outside Glasgow and his report of
  what Darnley told him as to his (Darnley's) conversations with his wife. The
  explanations given by Mary's defenders is that the forgers wrote the letter
  to fit in with Crauford's statement and/or altered this statement; but this
  would involve Lennox in the forgery and he certainly believed in the
  genuineness of the letters and in the truth of the dying confession of Hay of
  Tala and his accomplices. This is proved by a private letter Lennox wrote to
  his wife, his close friend and adviser.</p>

  <p>The Conference at Westminster was closed by order of Elizabeth. No verdict
  was given publicly, but the facts that the English Government supported the
  Regent and continued to recognize James VI while keeping his mother in prison
  proved that the 'casket letters' were considered genuine and that the Lords
  had proved their case, i.e. that they were justified in depriving Mary of her
  throne. Elizabeth was no more ready than she had ever been to agree to
  rebellion and the forcible deposition of sovereigns, but more unpleasant than
  backing the Lords, whose policy suited her, would have been an open trial of
  the Queen of Scots. She did not wish to create a precedent whereby monarchs
  could be tried by their subjects, neither did she or the Lords wish for the
  scandal of a public examination into the Darnley murder. Certainly Elizabeth
  was guiltless but she found that some of her pensioners, such as Moray, might
  not have been; then, if Mary had been judged innocent, she would have had to
  be freed and all the resultant mischief faced, or, if guilty, put to death
  and all that resultant mischief faced. Nor was it likely that Mary, who had
  fled from the prospect of a trial in Scotland, would submit to one in
  England, or that her complicity in the murder could be proved more clearly
  than it had already been. It would have been impossible for her to establish
  her innocence; she had already shown that her sole defence was a blank denial
  of all the charges. In these complicated and delicate circumstances,
  Elizabeth's advisers acted wisely in their tacit verdict of 'not proven' and
  in keeping Mary under restraint.</p>

  <p>They had no legal right to do this, but their action was covered by the
  plea that they were acting in the best interests of a woman so discredited
  that she could not hope to find an asylum anywhere save in England. There is
  not the least reason to suppose that Elizabeth and Cecil, who had taken great
  care in the business of the 'casket letters', believed that Moray had put in
  forged evidence or that everyone who implicated Mary in the murder was a
  liar; and if they believed that they had a murderess and adultress on their
  hands they were acting not only prudently, but humanely, in refusing to
  investigate the case further and in treating Mary with the respect due to her
  birth. Although suspicious they did not know that she was engaged in rousing
  the North in rebellion or that she was plotting to marry Norfolk; and if she
  was prepared to live quietly they were prepared to grant her every possible
  indulgence.</p>

  <p>Few have recounted the story of Mary of Scotland without casting odium on
  Elizabeth, who is usually represented as acting out of personal spite and
  malice towards a lovely woman, younger and more fascinating than herself.
  There is no evidence of this. Save for her coquetry with Melville, in the
  artificial tone of the period, she showed no personal jealousy of Mary. She
  was glutted with flattery; she had her life-long friendship with Robert
  Dudley (Leicester) and as many personable gallants as she wished. She was far
  more fortunate than Mary; she had kept not only her throne but her
  reputation, and Mary's lovers had not been so attractive that any woman need
  have envied her. Neither would Elizabeth feel jealous at the reports of
  Mary's charms since she (Elizabeth) lived in a cloud of adulation that
  persuaded her she was the most fascinating woman in the world, as well as the
  most brilliant and powerful.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Elizabeth's policy was never entirely her own. In her behaviour
  to Mary she followed the advice of Cecil, Walsingham and other statesmen to
  whom Mary was but a pawn in the very difficult game they played, that of
  preserving the existence of a small, poor country, as England was, in face of
  the hostility of Europe, the enmity of Ireland and the divisions in Scotland.
  Elizabeth Tudor is not an endearing character, but her behaviour to Mary
  Stewart need not be numbered among her sins. The two women were natural
  enemies from the first and both knew it. Mary was fulsome in her attitude
  towards Elizabeth, but she never ratified the Treaty of Edinburgh; she had,
  in her need, fawned on Moray, only to blast him by her furious proclamation
  when she rashly thought she was safe from his power; and, as this
  proclamation had rendered it hopeless for Moray and his sister ever to be
  reconciled, so, with every appeal refused, with every day spent in captivity,
  it became more hopeless to expect any friendship between Mary and her English
  jailors. It was obvious that she would never forgive her detention in
  England; for that reason alone it was impossible to set her free.</p>

  <p>The 'casket letters' are of a nature so startling and dramatic that it is
  not surprising that all who read them were deeply impressed. If they are
  forgeries they are so skilfully done as to dupe the most cautious
  investigator; No. 2 (really No. 1), or the Glasgow letter, has been described
  as worthy only of a rustic wench incoherently setting down her feelings and
  equal to a fiction by Shakespeare; it is nearer the last than the first and
  must be considered as one of the most famous love letters ever written. The
  form is strange as it (the original French) is written on an odd piece of
  paper on which a memorandum had been scribbled and written over with the
  charge to the messenger and Bothwell's name. Assuming that Mary wrote it, she
  dashed it off the evening of the first day she spent in Glasgow and sent it
  to Bothwell by someone deep in the lovers' plot&mdash;either Guiseppe Rizzio
  or Nicolas Herbert (French Paris).</p>

  <p>It is a letter charged with passion. The writer refers to a
  prior-arrangement whereby she is to bring her husband into the power of his
  enemies so that he may be murdered; she relates the victim's penitence, his
  fawning on her, his trust in her, his readiness to leave safety for the sake
  of a reconciliation with her; she impresses on her lover her readiness to
  obey him and her loathing of 'the pocky fellow' she is luring to his doom;
  yet she refers to him with contemptuous pity and states that she would not
  'do it' out of revenge, but only to please Bothwell; in his service her
  'heart is as a diamond'; she is sleepless and passes the terrible hours with
  her usual diversions of needlework; she is making Bothwell a bracelet that
  she entreats him not to show, since she has been seen working at it. This
  curious article has 'a key' and strings or tags; it is difficult to
  understand what it could have been. Since it was made so rapidly (not
  finished as well as it should have been), it was probably of knitted silk
  with laces fastening the band and the 'key' would be one of the symbols then
  so popular that had a hidden meaning. It might have been a design in beads or
  other coloured silks, or a jewel attached; that it was a key in the sense
  that it locked the bracelet seems impossible&mdash;metalwork could not have
  been put together under these conditions and, besides, the bracelet had
  strings. Reference was often made to 'the bracelets' of magic powers whereby
  Bothwell bewitched Mary, and this is a curious touch for a forger to have put
  in. The letter is that of a woman more loving than beloved; she is jealous of
  another, ( Jane Gordon), and of her brother, Huntly, and the writer implores
  news, trust, gratitude and love in return for what she is about to do. She
  mentions the defaced scrap of paper on which she writes and her general hurry
  and agitation, but she is resolute in her task. She notes that Lennox had
  'bled at the nose' and hints that this is an omen of death. It has been
  objected that the tone of the letters is Coarse and even indecent and that,
  therefore, a woman of Mary's refinement could not have written them; or, if
  she did, she was utterly lost to self-respect. This is not so; the letters
  are candid and leave no doubt that the writer was the mistress of the man to
  whom she wrote, but there is nothing gross in them and the only touches of
  indelicacy are those that refer to the details of Darnley's illness, and
  these are but slight.</p>

  <p>It is not the purpose of this narrative to enter into controversy, but it
  has been impossible to avoid all reference to the 'casket letters'. It is
  difficult to avoid the conclusion that they are genuine; if they are to be
  taken as forgeries so many coincidences and strange happenings have to be
  allowed for that credulity is strained to the utmost and one of the most
  striking pieces of evidence of their genuineness is the poor defence put up
  by Mary and her friends. For example, if the letters were really written to
  Darnley or put together from an old diary, with the incriminating portions
  written in, it would have been easy for Mary, or Herries, or Bishop Leslie,
  to have at once discovered this and said so; but they never even put the
  suggestion forward. Nor did they dispute the authenticity of the contracts
  and verse also in the casket, nor did Mary declare an account of her time in
  Glasgow and Stirling proving that she could not have written the letters
  since she was in company or otherwise occupied. For a full and impartial
  history of these documents, which the defenders of Mary have made into a
  puzzle, the reader is referred to <i>The Casket Letters and Mary Queen of
  Scots</i>, by T. F. Henderson. Edinburgh, 1889.</p>

  <p>Mary, naturally, viewed with frustrated fury the, to her, lame conclusion
  of the Westminster Conference. Her particular grievance was that she was not
  allowed to appear in person, or to see Elizabeth, and her rage increased with
  her growing certainty that she was to be kept a prisoner indefinitely. Bolton
  Castle had always been in possession of the noble family of Scrope. It stood
  on the north side of Wensleydale, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, six miles
  from Middelhan and ten miles from Richmond. It was built in the reign of
  Richard II, eighteen years were spent in the erection of the massive
  fortalice, and it was erected to act as a check on the turbulent Nevilles,
  entrenched at Middelhan Castle. The ruins, park, church and village of Bolton
  are themselves of great attraction and interest and the scenery, still
  unmarred, is beautiful.</p>

  <p>Mary was not long at Bolton. Some suspicion arising as to her conspiracy
  with the Duke of Norfolk, she was taken from the charge of his brother-in-law
  and sister, Lord and Lady Scrope, and removed on January 26th (1569) to
  Tutbury. This winter journey was the cause of grave complaint by
  Mary&mdash;she did not choose to recall worse journeys undertaken in Scotland
  for her own ends, in particular the winter ride from Glasgow to Kirk O'Field.
  She was taken by Wetherby, Pontefract and Sheffield; the 'pain in the side'
  (mentioned in the Glasgow letter) afflicted her; she had also a violent
  headache and the procession stopped at Chesterfield, where a Mr. Foljambe
  handsomely provided for the party. Lady Livingstone, Mary's faithful
  attendant, was left behind at Rotherham, too ill to proceed. Tutbury, near
  Burton-on-Trent, is older than Bolton, being originally a Roman fort; in
  Mary's time it was crown property and the Earl of Shrewsbury was Governor. It
  took nine days for the Queen and her retinue to travel from Bolton to
  Tutbury; she was disgusted with her accommodation in what she termed 'a very
  old hunting lodge...on the top of a hill and exposed to all the inclemencies
  of the weather'.</p>

  <p>She kept up her spirits, however, by the hopes of the marriage with
  Norfolk and the Roman Catholic rising that should replace her on the Scots
  throne and gain for her the English throne. Mary was not harshly kept at
  Tutbury; her Scots friends came and went as they chose. She received messages
  from her old counsellor, her uncle of Guise, and her French dowry was sent,
  though this was not regularly paid. Elizabeth was not lavish with her
  expenses, but Mary had thirty persons in her train for whom Shrewsbury was
  allowed forty-five pounds a week. To Tutbury came one of Cecil's men, Sir
  Nicolas White, who gave as his opinion that the captive was so bewitching as
  to be dangerous. He noted that she sat up late and was busy with her needle.
  This work was her constant occupation; she said that the different colours
  prevented the exacting labour from seeming tedious, and she always had a
  professional embroiderer in her household who drew the designs and the heavy
  cutting, mounting and backgrounds.</p>

  <p>Norfolk lent Mary money and she obtained other sums through Bishop Lesley
  from an Italian banker. Norfolk became more deeply involved in her cause and
  Cecil discovered the marriage project. He had no right to object to it, but
  he did not like it; he wanted to be rid of Mary and her affairs but could not
  think how to do this. A private memorandum of his shows his belief in the
  'casket letters': 'Her friends desire to place her on the Scots and English
  thrones...she would not be more scrupulous to take away Queen Elizabeth's
  life than she was to destroy he husband, because his life hindered her
  adulterous marriage with Bothwell. Catholics provided with a Papal Absolution
  would never be scrupulous.'</p>

  <p>In the same tone the Privy Council prayed Elizabeth not to restore Mary;
  it would be a crime to set such an infamous person on a throne; she would
  prove an active, dangerous enemy to England; she would either recall
  Bothwell, who would cancel all her promises because they had been made
  without his consent, or make another marriage equally dangerous to
  England.</p>

  <p>Norfolk was a plain man, of a mean presence and a mediocre character. He
  had much to lose; by his first wife he had an heir; by his second wife five
  daughters; he had lost his third wife the year of Mary's flight across the
  Solway; he was still young and a Protestant; yet ambition and Mary's
  fascination decided him to risk all he possessed&mdash;even his son's
  future&mdash;in her cause. Mary had George Douglas, Moray's half-brother, in
  her train, and Willie Douglas, who had also helped in her escape from
  Lochleven. One or other of these acted as her messenger to Norfolk. She sent
  him warm love letters and a cameo, with her portrait; she accepted from him a
  diamond that she kept in her bosom. She had not seen him since she was at
  Carlisle but he represented her best chance of liberty and revenge.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth charged Norfolk with the intention of marrying Mary. He denied
  this, but she warned him of 'the wooden pillow'. In July (1569) Mary sent
  Lord Boyd to Scotland to try to obtain a divorce for her from Bothwell, her
  excuse being that her first divorce had not been lawful, though she had not
  understood that at the time. This plea was put before the Scots Privy Council
  at Perth and rejected by forty votes to nine. Maitland spoke for the Queen
  and Moray arrested him, Lord Seton and Grange and lodged them in Edinburgh
  Castle; they were charged with being 'art and part' in the murder of
  Darnley.</p>

  <p>Soon after Nicolas Herbert, Bothwell's body-servant, was extradited from
  Norway and made a full confession under fear of torture of how he and
  Bothwell had planned to place the gunpowder in the Queen's room. Bothwell had
  been suffering from dysentery at this time and his servant's evidence was
  marked by sordid details and charges of revolting vices against his master.
  Elizabeth wanted Herbert sent to England, but Moray had him beheaded in
  Edinburgh. Elizabeth sent Norfolk to the Tower, but Maitland contrived to
  send Mary letters of encouragement from Edinburgh Castle and in November
  (1569) the great Northern Earls, Northumberland and Westmorland, rose for
  Mary. Their object was her release and marriage to Norfolk. They took Hexham
  and were advancing on Tutbury when Mary was removed to Wingfield.</p>

  <p>Warwick and Sussex put down the rebellion. Northumberland fled to
  Armstrong, a Border chief who dwelt near Hawick, and Westmorland took refuge
  with Carr of Ferniehurst, near Jedburgh. Armstrong sold Northumberland to
  Moray, who sent him to Lochleven. Carr did not betray the other Earl, but
  heavy punishments in the North quelled the spirit of the unfortunate
  enthusiasts who had tried to espouse the cause of the Queen of Scots.</p>

  <p>Mary was moved back to Tutbury, where she became ill from chagrin and
  frustration; the failure of the Northern rebellion on which she had set such
  high hopes reduced her to an insensibility of grief. She alternately wept and
  swooned for days and was tortured by the pain in her side and violent
  headaches. Her letters to Elizabeth were unanswered. The rising had done her
  great harm, since it had shown how dangerous she was to the English
  government.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth opened negotiations with Moray as to delivering Mary into his
  hands; she wanted to be rid of the Scots Queen, but the bargaining came to
  nothing. Moray, false to his trust, had used the treasures given to him by
  Mary at Lochleven; the gold and silver plate he had melted down and many of
  Mary's jewels he sold at a low price to Elizabeth; a transaction, on both
  sides, of a peculiar meanness.</p>

  <p>In January (1570) Mary, still prostrate from the failure of the Northern
  plot, heard of the murder of Moray. He was riding from Stirling to Edinburgh;
  in passing through Linlithgow he went slowly because of the narrow street and
  was shot from a window. He was taken into a nearby house, where he died of
  his wound. He was thirty-nine years of age. The murderer, one David Hamilton
  of Bothwellhaugh, escaped: his grievance remains obscure. Mary rejoiced
  fiercely at this news and instructed Archbishop Beaton, Steward of her French
  estates, to give the assassin a pension for life. This same month Mary wrote
  to 'mine own lord' Norfolk, still in the Tower, asking him if she should
  enter into more plots for her escape and his own. She reminded him that they
  were bound together and that he had promised 'not to leave her'; she was
  ready to do anything 'for weal or woe' that pleased him; she was ready to
  remain a perpetual prisoner rather than put him in peril; yet she would do
  anything so that they might be free; she was sad that she did not hear from
  him; she hoped God would keep them from deceitful friends, and she was:</p>

  <p class="quote">'Your own faithful to death,<br>
  Mary, Queen of Scots, My Norfolk.'</p>

  <p>The tone is much that of the 'casket letters'.</p>

  <p>Lennox, Mary's most implacable enemy, was elected Regent of Scotland by
  the influence of Elizabeth, who was further hardened against the Roman
  Catholics by the Pope's Bull that excommunicated her. This was the climax of
  the Counter-Reformation and made the conflict in Scotland part of an
  international war of religion.</p>

  <p>In August (1570) Norfolk was released from the Tower on his promise to
  have nothing more to do with Mary. The civil war in Scotland was violently
  renewed; there were more sacrifices to the ghost of Darnley; the Archbishop
  of St. Andrews was hanged at Stirling by order of Lennox for being 'art and
  part' in that murder; Seton fled again to Flanders; Herries had 'a heavy
  heart'; Mary languished, schemed and intrigued at Tutbury after a brief
  period when she was confined in Ashby-de-la-Zouche.</p>

  <p>Mary remained in the North of England for nineteen years and those who are
  following her sad journeys can take their choice of the many pleasant places
  from which her English prisons&mdash;ruins, or in two instances no longer in
  existence&mdash;can be visited. Their sites and surroundings are not much
  altered and still beautiful. Mary was often moved and it is not possible to
  fix the exact times of these changes, nor is it of much importance.</p>

  <p>Maitland stood openly for the Queen in Scotland. This disposes of him as
  the forger of the 'casket letters'; it is impossible to believe that, as
  Mary's partisan, he would not have done her the inestimable favour of
  declaring that he had written these documents. He sent her regular accounts
  of affairs in Scotland despite the paralysis that was disabling him; the
  Hamiltons, Argyll and Huntly wished to wait on Elizabeth to demand the
  release of Mary, but she refused to receive them and the plea of the French
  Ambassador met with no better success.</p>

  <p>Minor distresses vexed Mary; for one, the disposal of her famous
  treasures. When she learned (March 1570) that some of her jewels, and in
  particular the great diamond that was one of the Valois gems, <i>Henri le
  Grand</i>, were in the possession of Moray's widow she wrote demanding the
  return of this hoard. The request was refused.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of that year Norfolk contrived to see Mary again and she
  used all her personal fascination to urge this slow suitor into activity. She
  asked him how she was to smuggle some of her French money into Scotland to
  help her partisans; many of her messengers had been arrested and one of her
  most faithful friends, Bishop Lesley, was in the Tower. Norfolk thought that
  one Banister, a servant of his, could be trusted to take the money to
  Scotland. He sent the sum and a covering letter by a carrier named Brown, who
  took both to Cecil, recently created Lord Burleigh. There were other
  betrayals on the parts of servants and Norfolk was again sent to the Tower,
  while Mary's retinue was reduced to sixteen people, to her great distress.
  With heartfelt anguish she parted from George Gordon and Willie Douglas; for
  she feared for their lives if they were forced to return to Scotland and
  begged them to try to get to France and to keep together. She hoped that
  Beaton, steward of her affairs in France, would do something for these loyal
  friends. She also wrote a desperate letter of personal appeal to the Pope,
  but she was not of sufficient political importance for the Vatican to
  interfere on her behalf.</p>

  <p>Maitland now said: 'The Queen of England would never have freed a woman
  she had so bitterly wronged'. Elizabeth, indeed, showed an increasing
  sternness in her attitude towards Mary. Her letters were intercepted; she was
  not allowed to write to her son; she became extremely ill from a complication
  of diseases. In the autumn of 1571 Lennox, Regent of Scotland, was
  assassinated in a tumult, when Huntly, one of the Hamiltons and other
  turbulent men seized Stirling when Lennox was in residence. It was night-time
  and the Regent was abed. He was captured together with Argyll, and several
  other nobles. These were mounted in order to take them to Edinburgh, but Mar
  came to the rescue and in the brawl Lennox was stabbed in the back. He died
  the same night, in Stirling Castle, and Mar was elected Regent in face of
  Elizabeth's candidate, Morton. Maitland sent a report of this affair to Mary,
  who derived some satisfaction from the death of her father-in-law, one of her
  most relentless enemies.</p>

  <p>His deeds lived after him. Buchanan's book, based on the evidence against
  Mary that Lennox had diligently collected, was published in Latin, the
  <i>Detectio Mariae Reginae</i> as it was named in Buchanan's collected works,
  but in this edition <i>De Maria Scotoram Regina</i>, etc. Soon after appeared
  in London the Scots version, <i>Ane Detection of the duinges of Marie Quene
  of Scottis</i>, etc., and a year later another version appeared at St.
  Andrews. All are without correct dates or names of publishers or printers. To
  the Latin version three of the 'casket letters' were appended; the whole
  eight were given in the Scots version and seven in a French version that
  appeared in 1572. Elizabeth sent Mary a copy of this book that spread so
  widely, in four languages, the charges against her. Mary persisted in her
  firm denials as to the authorship of the letters and the 'calumnies', as she
  termed them, in Buchanan's indictment, but neither she nor her friends said
  or did anything to disprove the genuineness of the letters or the truth of
  Buchanan's tales. The famous Latinist was then Tutor to James VI and educated
  his pupil in the belief that his mother was a woman who had forfeited her
  crown and her honour by incorrigible conduct.</p>

  <p>Bishop Lesley, under duress, turned traitor against Mary and provided
  sufficient evidence for Elizabeth to sign the death warrant of Norfolk. She
  did this with extreme reluctance and twice revoked the sentence; but he had
  been warned; he had been pardoned; he had given his word not to offend again
  and the evidence against him, including correspondence with the Pope and the
  King of Spain, was overwhelming. He had even declared his readiness to become
  a Roman Catholic if the Vatican would sanction his marriage to Mary. But at
  the end he stated he was a Protestant and that his sentence was just; he
  cherished to the last 'a little picture in gold of the Scots Queen' and died
  bravely. He forfeited not only his life but his great titles and magnificent
  estates; the attainder was not reversed until 1664 in favour of Thomas, Earl
  of Arundel.</p>

  <p>About the same time Lord Seton, returning from Flanders with arms and
  money from Alva, was wrecked on the Scots coast and the supplies lost, while
  some of his papers were forwarded to Elizabeth and helped to increase her
  anger against this dangerous captive who would not cease to intrigue.</p>

  <p>Mary was moved to the Manor of Sheffield, where she was still in the
  charge of the Earl of Shrewsbury. On her complaints of her ill lodging,
  Elizabeth sent three commissioners to look into her treatment and, at the
  same time, to accuse her in formal terms of inspiring the Papal Bull against
  Elizabeth, of fomenting plots and of secretly betrothing herself to Norfolk.
  Elizabeth had an excuse for this in the request of her Parliament to attaint
  Mary as a fellow conspirator with Norfolk against the English throne, a
  request she had refused.</p>

  <p>The massacre of Saint Bartholmew (1572) inflamed public opinion among the
  Protestants against Mary. The House of Lords and the Clergy drew up an
  indictment of the Scots Queen in which they detailed her crimes; an anonymous
  pamphlet summed up the common English feeling against the royal captive in
  stating that Elizabeth would never be safe while Mary lived. This bitter work
  underlined a considerable weakness in Mary's case: her betrothal to Norfolk
  when her divorce from Bothwell had been refused. This attitude of hers made
  her extremely dangerous because it showed that she considered Bothwell only
  her 'fornicator' and herself free to contract other alliances now Norfolk was
  dead. The unknown author, employing language that, although violent, is not
  unsuited to the facts of the case, regrets 'so much noble and innocent blood
  has and shall be spilt, so many murders, rapes and robberies, violent and
  laborious slaughters of all sorts, sexes and ages...the damnation of so many
  seduced souls...and all for piteous pity and miserable mercy in sparing one
  horrible woman who carries God's wrath wherever she goes'.</p>

  <p>Mary defended herself with courage and address. She told Elizabeth's
  Commissioners that she was entitled to take what steps she could to secure
  her release, that she had burnt a copy of the Pope's Bull and that she was
  within her rights in betrothing herself to the Duke of Norfolk. The enmity
  between the two Queens, always intense, was yet further embittered by these
  exchanges and it was clear that only force could set Mary free. Abortive
  plots, in one of which Huntly was involved, worsened Mary's position; only
  the will of Elizabeth saved her from death. In 1572 Northumberland, who had
  spent two years in Lochleven, was beheaded at York. Elizabeth bought him for
  two thousand pounds from Mar and Morton; soon after the former noble died
  suddenly and Morton was installed as Regent on the day that Mary's ferocious
  enemy, John Knox, died, November 24th (1572).</p>

  <p>The following year the Pacification of Perth ended the civil war between
  King's men and Queen's men. Morton vigorously besieged Edinburgh Castle where
  Maitland and Grange were still holding out for Mary; and this garrison ('the
  Castalians') surrendered May 29th (1573). Grange and his brother were
  publicly hanged and Maitland cast into prison at Leith, where he soon died.
  He was brought to court in his coffin to receive sentence.</p>

  <p>Mary's treasures had changed hands. Argyll had married Moray's widow and
  so they had come into his charge, but after a long struggle the Regent
  obtained possession of them. He and the country he governed were poor and
  many of Mary's jewels were sold. Morton also retained the original 'casket
  letters' that Elizabeth asked for in vain, since they still constituted her
  most valid excuse for keeping Mary in prison. While the Queen of Scots'
  affairs went from bad to worse so that she no longer, with the fall of
  Edinburgh Castle, had a party in Scotland, she lived in comfort and even
  state. Her health was always poor and she suffered from long illnesses,
  brought on by anguish of mind, lack of fresh air and exercise and through her
  being in the low state that catches all infections. Needlework remained her
  continual pastime. She also always had a Secretary, Rollet, until his death
  in 1574; then Claude Nau; she wrote a good deal. Pet dogs, tame doves and
  Barlay pigeons also helped to while away the time.</p>

    <p class="caption">Chatsworth, a view of the new palace taken in 1775;<br>
    it stands on the site of one of Mary's prisons</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Mary complained, as a matter of routine, of all the places in which she
  was confined. Her real grief was the loss of her freedom; but though she was
  not allowed to hunt or ride abroad she had a certain amount of exercise in
  terrace, battlement or garden. Moreover, the painful monotony of her
  existence was broken by her movements from Bolton to Tutbury, from Tutbury to
  Sheffield, from there to Chartley, Wingfield, Hardwick and Chatsworth. From
  the ruins that remain it is not easy to reconstruct these massive fortresses
  or mansions, full of busy life with a constant coming and going of people and
  trains of baggage waggons and animals&mdash;all the stir and bustle of a
  self-contained community.</p>

  <p>Two of Mary's English prisons, Chatsworth and Hardwick, were pulled down
  and other palaces, in a later more elegant style, erected on the sites; the
  others have suffered the same fate as most mediaeval buildings&mdash;either
  wrecked in civil war or fallen into neglect through the misfortunes of their
  owners, then used as quarries for the building of smaller houses, then
  allowed to become the weed-grown, owl-haunted ruins that the eighteenth and
  nineteenth centuries delighted in and celebrated so often in sketch,
  engraving, verse or prose. These lonely places, visited only by the hawk or
  the fox, with the wildflowers growing on the empty hearths and the once
  splendid halls open to the skies, were the very essence of romanticism to a
  romantic age&mdash;especially when associated with a lovely captive queen,
  who had to be, for the sake of the poetry, 'wronged'. Many versifiers
  indulged in fanciful pictures of the enchanting Queen looking wistfully 'for
  Norfolk and his nuptial train' and many a draughtsman made graceful studies
  of ruins that even a hundred years ago were in good enough repair to evoke
  vivid memories of their one-time splendour. These old drawings show the
  wells, water butts and pipes still in place and smocked farmers' lads
  attending cattle or flocks of sheep on the sward that covered what once had
  been Mary's gardens.</p>

  <p>In the noble grounds of Chatsworth is a small moated enclosure built for
  Mary either as a private raised garden or as the base for a summer house that
  has now disappeared, and in the Church of Edensor (1870) is a brass plate
  from the old church, pulled down to make way for this building, that
  commemorates John Beton (Beaton), Mary's faithful servant, of the famous
  family so prominent in the annals of her reign. This curious plate shows the
  dead man on a mattress and bears a Latin inscription in which Mary is
  referred to as Queen of Scotland and France. She was always firm in her
  repudiation of her Act of Abdication and referred to her son James VI as
  'Lord Darnley' or the 'Duke of Lennox'. She would, she often declared, 'die
  Queen of Scotland' and a royal dais and canopy were always kept in her
  apartments.</p>

  <p>In Tutbury Castle, where Mary was constantly residing, she had State
  apartments, a large hall, 'a great chamber, an outer chamber, and an inner
  chamber' all spacious and handsomely furnished. There were rooms for the
  doctor, the apothecary, the cook, the secretary, private apartments for the
  Queen, suites for her women servants and other suites for her menservants.
  There was also a chapel (Roman Catholic) and gardens for the Queen's use. She
  had a buttery, a pantry, and a room for wood and coals. The surrounding
  scenery was beautiful and the air healthful. (The above description is taken
  from Sir Ralph Sadler's [Sadlier or Sadleyr] state papers; he was one of the
  Governors or Keepers responsible for the safety and comfort of the
  Queen.)</p>

  <p>Mary's own account of Tutbury, however, given in a very long letter she
  wrote to the French ambassador in London, presents a very different picture.
  According to this, the Castle was in a ruinous condition and the ramparts so
  high that no sun and little air could get to the rooms. It was so damp that
  she was crippled with rheumatism and so cold that she had to hang the room in
  tapestries and smother herself in coverlets, while even the doctor was ill
  and everyone else afflicted with chills 'fluxion, colds, or some disorder'.
  For her private use she had only 'two miserable little rooms' and to retire
  into 'two paltry holes, with windows facing the surrounding walls'. As to
  exercise, it was impossible to ride abroad because of the state of the roads,
  and the garden was no better than a pigsty. There were no drains and Mary,
  who had been fleeing from bad smells all her life, had to endure 'a perfume
  not the most agreeable' from the privy beneath her window. Tutbury had
  unpleasant associations, for her. It was a place where she had always been
  treated 'with great harshness, rudeness and indignity'; she feared she might
  be separated from her servants, under the excuse of repairing the rooms and
  then, no doubt, her life would be attempted. Such was Mary's opinion of
  Tutbury, which she certainly did not see with romantic eyes.</p>

  <p>Tutbury (Staffordshire) keeps its secrets; it is impossible now to decide
  whether Sir Ralph Sadler or Mary reported correctly on the condition of the
  massive fort (she termed it a 'hunting lodge') in which she was confined.</p>

  <p>Mary's first visit to Sheffield was as early as 1570. Besides her own
  retinue she had forty retainers of the Earl of Shrewsbury to add to her
  state, and to see she did not escape. Mary was kept sometimes in the Manor
  House and sometimes in the Castle of Sheffield. A century ago the ruins of a
  window were shown as that from which she often gazed; it was here that she
  collapsed after hearing of the beheading of Norfolk, here that she learned of
  the slaughter of the Protestants in Paris that caused her to be more strictly
  guarded.</p>

  <p>Shrewsbury was suspected of succumbing to the charms of his prisoner. The
  usual scandal was spread concerning them and Elizabeth was further angered
  against the Earl because his managing countess, 'Bess of Hardwick', dared to
  marry her daughter to Mary's brother-in-law, Charles Stewart, Earl of Lennox.
  The only issue of this marriage was that unhappy Arabella whose royal blood
  brought her as sad a fate as that of Mary herself.</p>

  <p>Mary had to endure in 1575 the loss of the man who had been her earliest
  friend and adviser, who had shaped her policies and her attitude towards
  life, the Cardinal of Lorraine. Her health became so poor that she was
  allowed to go to Buxton to take the waters. Organic diseases combined with
  nervous ailments to make her a chronic invalid; she no longer had the
  strength even to plot. Buxton, a Roman town on the Wye, has no memorial of
  Mary Queen of Scots. She mentions the place frequently in her letters and the
  partial cures she obtained there helped to establish the famous 'waters'. The
  house in which she stayed on her various visits to the 'Auncient Bathes of
  Buckstones' belonged to the Cavendishes, and was on the site of a hotel known
  as <i>The Hall</i> built, also by a Cavendish, in 1670.</p>

  <p>After her visit to Buxton in 1576 Mary, whose power over the Earl of
  Shrewsbury had aroused the jealousy of his wife and the wrath of Elizabeth,
  was secluded in Sheffield Manor House and the Parret House. Shrewsbury's son,
  Francis Talbot, who lived with his father in Sheffield Castle, told Elizabeth
  that none of his family had seen the Queen of Scots 'for years'.</p>

  <p>It was indeed four years that Mary remained secluded thus, allowed no
  contact with the outer world. For this space of time she disappears from
  history. It is easy to guess at her life; the pets, the needlework, the 'hope
  deferred', the gossip with her faithful servants&mdash;all on the same
  subject, the cruel injustice of her detention&mdash;the bouts of illness,
  pain, sickness, lying abed, insomnia, fear of sudden and secret death.
  Shortly before her seclusion (1574) she had written to the Archbishop of
  Glasgow asking for a portion of 'fine unicorn's horn, as I am in great want
  of it'. The unicorn was the beautiful heraldic beast of Scotland, but Mary
  was not interested in that subject; the fabulous animal carried in his horn
  not bone but the most precious ointment on earth&mdash;it could cure any ill
  and was a certain antidote against poison.</p>

  <p>Foreign powers interceded for Mary and in the spring of 1580 the prisoner
  was allowed to visit Buxton again. She was then thirty-seven and appeared an
  old woman. What remained of her hair was grey and the bright periwigs she
  wore showed up the flattened contours of her face. She had become heavy and
  clumsy through disease and lack of exercise; and on attempting to mount her
  horse she fell and hurt her back. Progress was slow and painful but Mary's
  spirits rose at the prospect of a short relief from the monotony of her
  captivity. She had lost much of her vivacity and had not persevered with the
  English lessons she had begun with Sir Francis Knollys, so that she was much
  handicapped when away from her French attendants.</p>

  <p>Her complication of diseases increased with every year of her life, and
  she began to be crippled down her right side from afflictions that her
  doctor, surgeon and apothecary judged to be of rheumatic origin. The spa of
  Buxton was famed for the relief it brought to sufferers from rheumatism and
  Mary declared that she had gained much help from the clear and sparkling
  waters. The baths and the draughts of this pure saline mineral water were
  also considered excellent for over-excitement, epilepsy, paralysis, and the
  news of the benefits Mary had received from her visits to Buxton had brought
  many celebrated people, including Lord Burleigh, to the clean and attractive
  town that was always cheerful and provided the many visitors with a variety
  of sports and amusements. On her first visit Mary had been allowed to ride
  out to Poole's Hole, one of the curiosities of the neighbourhood; a
  stalagmite in the cave was long known as Mary Queen of Scots' Pillar because
  she was supposed to have paused there and gazed for a while at the gloomy
  grandeur of the cavern, lit by torches and lanterns.</p>

  <p>The surroundings of Buxton are extremely beautiful in the style that was
  formerly termed picturesque, but Mary was not long allowed to enjoy the
  waters, the air and the amusements before she was again removed to the
  handsome Manor House of Sheffield. Here she had everything save liberty. Her
  retinue was large, she had her French dowry, though it was not paid
  regularly, for her own use, and Lord Shrewsbury was responsible for her
  expenses. He was a reasonably kind guardian, who filled his odious post with
  tact towards his prisoner and loyalty towards his mistress. His wife, the
  celebrated 'Bess of Hardwick', did not see much of the captive and did not
  interfere with her comfort or her state after she had been obliged to retract
  some of her complaints about Mary and Shrewsbury.</p>

  <p>Where Mary resided during the fourteen years that she was in the charge of
  this nobleman is not precisely known. Her visits to Buxton are believed to
  have been four in number and on each occasion she resided in the Hall. Her
  visits to Chatsworth, also for health reasons, were frequent. In the massive
  walls of Bolton that still dwarf the village of Castle Bolton in Wensleysdale
  she was imprisoned six or twelve months according to different accounts, but
  she never returned there after the early years of her imprisonment. She also
  resided at another of Shrewsbury's mansions, Hardwick Manor, or
  Hall&mdash;not the present building but one near by now destroyed. She was
  several times taken to Chartley, near Stafford, where she lodged in the now
  vanished houses of various local notables and she was taken also to Worksop
  Manor and Wingfield Manor, both splendid dwellings.</p>

  <p>These moves from one to another of Lord Shrewsbury's mansions were not
  only to puzzle potential deliverers as to her whereabouts but for the usual
  purposes of cleansing these palaces that became, after a few months,
  uninhabitable from accumulated dirt. Mary, like every other person able to
  have more than one house, was used to this routine that had been employed
  even in the gorgeous pleasure palaces of the French Kings, but she never
  ceased to complain. Either she was kept too long in one place or when she was
  moved it was at some inclement season of the year.</p>

  <p>Wingfield Manor, like so many of the English castles or manors in which
  Mary was imprisoned, was dismantled in the civil war, allowed to fall into
  decay and used as a quarry for building stone. In the period when melancholy
  ruins were so much admired (thistles, it was noted, always grew on the sites
  of Mary's English prisons) Wingfield Manor was considered charming and one of
  the most beautiful in Derbyshire. The situation is indeed grand but modern
  care does not allow the graceful briar, the climbing eglantine, the glossy
  ivy to adorn these treasured relics, and they do not appear so opulently sad
  without their garlands of murmuring grasses, their courts full of hawthorn
  and rose as they did to our ancestors, who saw the captive Queen through a
  haze of sentimental legend.</p>

  <p>The number of Mary's household and the retinue kept by the Earl of
  Shrewsbury varied. On one occasion, when at Wingfield, two hundred yeomen
  with their officers were employed in guarding her, while her private
  establishment consisted of a doctor of medicine, a surgeon, an apothecary,
  two secretaries, five gentlemen, fourteen servants, three cooks, four pages,
  three valets and six gentlewomen, while two of the gentlemen had their wives
  with them and there were several children with their nurses and maids. Mary
  usually had an embroiderer with her and there are references to this man's
  family in her letters. She was constantly wishing to change her attendants
  and servants and to have French people sent to her from the Guise household.
  She kept up a correspondence with the French and Spanish ambassadors in
  London, with the Kings of France and Spain and with her French relations. She
  spoke much of her son, for whom, she declared, she felt a warm affection, and
  she was always bitter against those who had come between them. A portrait of
  him hung in her bedroom and she wrote to him and sent him presents, often of
  her own working, though none of these reached him. At the same time her tone
  towards him varied. Sometimes she maintained that if she could get free she
  would have her throne back and he would be only Lord Darnley; sometimes she
  spoke of 'the King, my son' and said she would be content that he should rule
  as long as he would consult her. Always she prayed for his conversion to the
  Roman Catholic Faith.</p>

  <p>On his side James VI moved cautiously; he had been influenced by his
  mother's sharpest enemies, George Buchanan, his tutor; Lennox, his
  grandfather and one-time Regent; and Morton, another Regent. He had been
  educated in strict Protestant tenets and taught to detest his mother's
  religion and to think of her as a woman of a life so scandalous that the only
  dignified course he could follow would be to leave her in her English
  prisons. James VI was a scholarly, shrewd, yet superstitious youth. Plain in
  feature, ungainly in person, he early learned to grasp the supreme importance
  of keeping on good terms with Elizabeth from whom he might, as a Protestant
  and a male, obtain the promise of the English crown for which his mother had
  striven in vain, and the wisdom of hushing up Mary's story, which was, as he
  remarked, 'very strange'. It was not long before he heard from the lips of
  his enemies the sneer 'son of David', a taunt that was to follow him, all his
  life; and it was not to his interest to open up the details of the murder of
  David Rizzio, the murder of Henry Darnley, or the Bothwell marriage. He knew,
  also, that he held the throne only through the Act of Abdication that his
  mother had since repudiated, and that, if she were free, she would try to
  claim the Scots crown. So, on all counts, the cautious youth, though he
  sometimes complained that he was not allowed to communicate with his mother,
  was prepared to sacrifice her interests to his own and match Elizabeth in a
  waiting game.</p>

  <p>He therefore made no attempt to obtain any favours for Mary or to send
  her, save once, any gifts or messages. From an early age he was given to
  sentimental attachments, amounting to obsessions while they lasted, and when
  Mary was allowed, in 1580, from her seclusion in Sheffield Manor to visit
  Buxton, James VI was throwing off the influence of the Regent Morton and
  passing under that of the second of his wayward favourites, Esmé Stewart (the
  Earl of Arran being the first)&mdash;and young Esmé had everything to gain
  from persuading his master that his main policy should consist in
  subservience to Elizabeth Tudor.</p>

  <p>Mary therefore had nothing to hope for from her son, though she found it
  hard to believe that he should entirely overlook her claims as his mother and
  his sovereign. She remained, however, undaunted by her own failures. Disaster
  had overwhelmed her private life, yet she gave herself no blame and she did
  not alter her aims or her views. From the moment she had entered England she
  had flattered Elizabeth while secretly stirring up rebellion against her;
  while persistently and passionately demanding an interview with the English
  Queen so that she could win her over by personal charm and personal promise,
  she was always ready to bring over a French or Spanish army to dethrone the
  woman declared illegitimate by the Pope and put Mary Stewart in her place.
  With that superficial cleverness that is not very useful she maintained to
  the English agents and messengers occasionally sent to her that, as she was
  wrongfully detained and did not admit obedience to the laws of England, she
  was within her rights in trying all means of escape. At the same time, she
  declared that she loved Elizabeth and England and would never do anything to
  injure either.</p>

  <p>The shrewd men with whom she had to deal found this ambiguous attitude
  merely tedious; it was quite obvious that she could not escape without
  foreign or rebel English aid or without ruining Elizabeth. Burleigh, as his
  private memoranda shows, believed that Mary wrote the 'casket letters' and
  was a murderess who would not be checked by any scruple in seeking the life
  of his mistress. The people of England shared this view, as did the people of
  Scotland. Mary's friends were, in both countries, in a minority and consisted
  mostly of Roman Catholics who championed her blindly on account of her Faith,
  or those who were, by some political combination, at odds with their
  governments. Among these may be placed Huntly, Argyll and some other Lords,
  who petitioned the King of France to intervene in his sister-in-law's favour.
  That monarch, much under the influence of his mother, Catherine, whose
  dislike of Mary had not diminished with the years, was not disposed to
  undertake a dangerous war with England for the sake of a ruined and
  discredited woman; nor was Philip of Spain, though he dwelt broodingly on the
  prospect of invasion of England that should restore Mary and the Roman
  Catholic Faith to power.</p>

  <p>Mary's brightest prospect lay in resignation, in accepting a luxurious
  retirement, in clearing her mind of ambitions, plots, intrigues and schemes
  and in striving after the tranquil spirit that alone would have eased her
  bodily ills. Never politically intelligent, she could not see this. She could
  not grasp the powerful motives that kept her son and foreign powers aloof;
  she could not see that she was so dangerous to England that Burleigh and his
  colleagues must always keep her close; she could not grasp the reasons why
  Elizabeth must always refuse to see her; she could not realize how ruined her
  reputation was among high and low; she could not understand the firm grasp
  the Reformation had on at least a large part of Europe and that the constant
  policy of men like Moray and Burleigh&mdash;unification of the two
  crowns&mdash;was succeeding through the education of her son as a Protestant
  and Elizabeth's celibacy. Mary still continued to hope, to watch, to wait, to
  expect that some day, somewhere, a champion would rise to put her where she
  had been when she had landed at Leith with her gay and sumptuous train.</p>

  <p>Although adroit in small intrigues she never understood large issues nor
  how to handle vast affairs, and as the years of monotonous seclusion passed
  she became more and more out of touch with the outside world. Her ideas
  became more and more fixed. She felt no remorse, for she never admitted even
  to herself that she had ever done wrong; she persuaded herself that she had
  been pursued by an evil fate and always hounded by liars, forgers and
  slanderers. In this attitude she was encouraged by her attendants, who always
  treated her with respect, affection and as a queen greatly wronged.</p>

  <p>Gradually the past became blurred to Mary and the present out of focus.
  She dwelt incessantly on a picture of herself as a Queen against whom wicked
  men had rebelled, as a fugitive who, relying on promises from a sister
  sovereign, had placed herself in the hands of one on whom she had been told
  to rely. She imagined that she need not have come to England, since she had a
  large party in Scotland, forgetting the wild ride when she had fled for her
  life; she imagined that, if given permission, she could have retreated to
  France; forgetting the enmity of Catherine de Medici and that she would have
  had no asylum save under the uncertain protection of the Guises, in a convent
  life as dull as any she endured in her English prisons.</p>

  <p>As she was so completely self-centred she never considered for a moment
  the point of view of anyone else or regretted the mischief she had already
  done, or the thousands who had died in 'the great wars' she boasted she had
  'stirred up' in Scotland and England. She was ready to do this again, and,
  though noble sentiments were often on her lips and she was charmingly
  grateful to those in her service, she would, given opportunity, have urged
  any champion to his doom as she had urged Norfolk and the Northern Lords.</p>

  <p>It was nothing to her that England and Scotland were at last at peace, and
  that if her son succeeded Elizabeth they were likely to remain at peace. It
  was nothing to her that a Spanish invasion of England would lead to massacres
  of the Protestants more fearful than the slaughter of St. Bartholmew's Day;
  all that mattered was that Mary Stewart, so pitifully incapable of ruling, so
  pitifully incapable of leading an orderly life, should be returned to the
  power she had misused and forfeited.</p>

  <p>This singleness of aim gave her considerable force in speech and bearing;
  she never faltered a second from the position she had taken up and many
  besides her own devoted attendants were impressed by her resolute
  dignity.</p>

  <p>She no longer thought of Bothwell or Norfolk, but her descent from Henry
  VII was constantly in her mind, and gracious and familiar as she was with her
  intimates no one was allowed to forget that she was Queen Regnant of Scotland
  and Queen Dowager of France.</p>

  <p>She was seldom idle. Her secretaries, the Scot Curle and the Frenchman
  Claude Nau, were kept busy with her futile correspondence; her letters were
  all on one theme&mdash;her wrongs and her hopes of deliverance. She was
  permitted to buy books and had gathered together a fair library, although not
  as considerable as that which she had wished to leave to St. Andrew's
  University but which had been scattered since her downfall. She read French
  books, histories, works on religion, and lives of the Saints, and she dwelt
  continually on her fidelity to her Faith and her astonishment that God had
  permitted the triumph of the heretics. So long as her fingers served she
  played the virginals and worked with her needle, but her right hand became
  gradually crippled and only at intervals could she use her needle or strike
  the keys. She purchased rolls of silk, velvet, cloth, cambric, gauze and lace
  and had these materials made up by her ladies in the style she had always
  affected, that made fashionable by Diane de Poitiers so many years before.
  Mary Seton remained with her for many years 'busking' the periwigs Mary wore,
  until, ill, melancholy and exhausted, the faithful friend retired to a French
  convent.</p>

  <p>Mary was ingenious with small things. She wrote conventional verses and
  was clever at contriving the emblematic devices then fashionable; the rebus,
  the anagram and the pun were freely employed in this amusement that derived
  from heraldry then familiar to everyone gently born. Mary even altered her
  name to the French form, Stuart or Stouart, instead of Stewart, the French
  language being without the letter 'W'.</p>

  <p>One of the best known of her emblems was that of the ancient symbol of
  eternity, the serpent with the tail in its mouth with the motto: <i>In my end
  is my beginning</i>.</p>

  <p>She kept in touch with some of those who had admired her in France when
  she was so brilliant and so lovely. Pierre Ronsard dedicated a volume of his
  poems to her, and Mary, always gracious in these matters, sent him a casket
  of money and a silver vase with the design of Pegasus drinking at the Muses'
  stream.</p>

  <p>While Mary was in her strict seclusion in Sheffield Manor House, Bothwell
  died&mdash;in 1578, according to the most reliable accounts. He had been ten
  years or more a prisoner, for it was in June 1567 that he had left Dunbar,
  sailing north towards his dukedom of Orkney that he held by virtue of Mary's
  patent which he carried with him. Refused shelter by the Bailiff of Orkney,
  Bothwell fled towards Shetland; driven by a storm on the Danish coast, he was
  arrested by Frederick II and was detained at Bergen, where he was well
  treated until Anne Throndsson sued him for breach of promise. After many
  negotiations between Scotland and Denmark and many protests from Bothwell he
  was taken to Malmoe Castle where he was strictly kept, though allowed some
  liberty, and when Lennox came to the Regency he pressed for the surrender of
  the man he regarded as the chief of his son's murderers. The Danes would have
  surrendered Bothwell had it not been for the earnest entreaties of the
  Ambassadors of Charles IX; it was wished to spare a Queen Dowager of France
  the humiliation of having her husband put on trial for the murder of his
  predecessor. 'Nothing in the world,' wrote the French Ambassador in London,
  'would be a greater scandal to the reputation of this poor Princess or a
  greater confusion to her affairs.'</p>

  <p>Until 1573 Bothwell was treated with consideration. There are many
  traditions as to his behaviour during this period and of the intrigues and
  counter-intrigues that centred round his person but none is reliable, and
  after this year his story is obscure. Several reports state that the captive
  became insane; this was as widely believed as Mary's complicity in the
  Darnley murder. Even the name of his prison is not known, and though it is
  believed to have been Dragsholm in Zealand all that is certain is that
  Bothwell was dead in a Danish prison either in 1578 or shortly afterwards. It
  is a fact that Mary in 1576 had heard that Bothwell had made a declaration
  that he alone was guilty of the Kirk O'Field crime, for she wrote to Beaton
  (June 1st, 1576) that her husband had 'testified by his soul's salvation to
  my innocence'. She wished Beaton to send a messenger to Denmark to secure
  this document but the matter had to drop through lack of funds.</p>

  <p>It is now believed that such a testament never existed, the best argument
  for this being that when Mary's son was in Zealand in 1590 with his bride,
  Anne, Frederick's daughter, he made no attempt to discover, nor did any bring
  to his notice, a document that would have been of such importance to his
  mother's reputation. When the death of Bothwell set Mary free she no longer
  needed the divorce for which she had agitated in 1568; since the death of
  Norfolk there had been no suitors for her hand Despairing of finding a
  husband or a champion, and having no hope in France after the Treaty of
  Blois, Mary made a will in which she left her rights to the Scots and English
  crowns to Philip II as she had threatened she would do when first detained in
  Bolton.</p>

  <p>In 1580 Morton, by a palace revolution, was seized and kept a prisoner in
  Dumbarton Castle. In the following year on June 1st 1585, he was tried for
  the murder of Darnley and beheaded at the market cross of Edinburgh for being
  'art and part' in that crime. He confessed that he had known of it and
  concealed his knowledge; beyond that he said nothing that threw any light on
  this mysterious murder or on the puzzle of the 'casket letters'. About this
  period James VI sent a letter and a gift to his mother that raised her hopes
  for a time, but the gesture was meaningless and James did nothing for
  Mary.</p>

  <p>The so-called Sheffield portrait of Mary is dated 1578 and was extensively
  altered and copied for memorial purposes. It is signed 'P. Oudry' and appears
  to be the work of a journeyman painter; it is interesting as being the only
  likeness of Mary made during her imprisonment in England and the last
  portrait of her. Experts believe the original to be now in Hardwick Hall and
  that this is the picture referred to by Claude Nau when writing to the
  Archbishop of Glasgow (Beaton) in August 1577. The portrait may have been
  begun or ordered then and completed the following year or Nau may refer to
  some lost original of which the Sheffield portrait is a copy. It is a poor
  piece of work and shows Mary standing stiffly in the mourning robes she
  usually wore. The face is obviously the same with which we have become
  acquainted in the earlier portraits of Mary, but at thirty-six years of age
  the lovely oval countenance appears shadowless and expressionless and there
  is no hint of her charm and vivacity or of the pathos of her captivity and
  suffering.</p>

  <p>With every year public affairs worsened for Mary. In 1580 was issued 'the
  Bann', formulated by the Pope and Philip II against the great Protestant
  leader, William of Orange. This authorized his assassination and meant that
  the Pope and the King of Spain would encourage and reward any of the faithful
  who would undertake to murder a heretic. Elizabeth feared for herself, and
  with reason; her Roman Catholic subjects took 'the Bann' so seriously that
  some of them sent an Oxford Doctor of Laws, one Humphrey Eli, to the Papal
  Nuncio at Madrid to ask his opinion as to the legality of murdering the
  'illegitimate daughter of Henry VIII'; and received a full approbation of
  such an assassination. Elizabeth heard rumours of this and of other Roman
  Catholic plots. Esmé Stewart, created Duke of Lennox by James VI, meddled in
  a conspiracy to restore Mary and her Faith; Philip II and Mary's cousin, the
  Duke of Guise, were in this plot. Mary, through the Spanish Ambassador in
  London, Mendoza, managed much of the complicated and halfhearted affair. All
  these efforts proved abortive but both Elizabeth and her Council feared that
  sooner or later there would be a Roman Catholic plot that would succeed and
  that as long as Mary lived she would be the focus of, and the inspiration
  for, conspiracies to murder Elizabeth and enslave England.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to send Mary to Scotland or France and so there was
  nothing to ensure the safety of Elizabeth and her realm save the death of
  Mary. The only question was how this was to be done so as to avoid the wrath
  of Spain and France and the odium of putting to death a royal fugitive who
  was also a relative of Elizabeth. It must always be kept in mind that the
  English Queen did not, as is so often stated, move in single-handed malice
  and spite against the Queen of Scots, but that she obeyed, reluctantly, the
  wishes of her Council, of her Parliament and of her people. Elizabeth was no
  friend to Mary; she believed the worst that was told of her and she still
  cherished resentment at Mary's assumption of the English arms, but she did
  not want the responsibility of putting her to death nor to create the
  precedent that sovereigns could be put on trial.</p>

  <p>So she hesitated and delayed until 1584, when the murder of the Prince of
  Range by a Roman Catholic fanatic set all the Protestants in a ferment of
  rage and alarm. A Band of Association for the protection of Elizabeth was at
  once formed; this made death the penalty for the slightest knowledge of any
  plot against the Queen of England. Mary joined the Association that she
  believed was directed against herself. Elizabeth, not deceived, gave a tacit
  consent to the resolve of Burleigh and Walsingham that the Queen of Scots
  must at last be put to death; the laws against the Roman Catholics (the
  famous 'twenty seventh of Elizabeth') left Mary at the mercy of the English
  Government. In 1581 the so-called 'statute of silence' had been passed; this
  was also directed against Mary and made it high treason even to discuss
  Elizabeth's possible successor. It was also, under this law, high treason to
  be the object of any plot to find a successor to Elizabeth; thus an innocent
  person might be put to death merely because some conspirators of whom he had
  never heard had plotted in his favour.</p>

  <p>With the nation and the Queen behind them it only remained for Burleigh
  and Walsingham to discover means as plausible as possible for destroying the
  Queen of Scots. In May 1585 Walsingham intercepted a letter from Mary again
  offering her regal rights to Philip II; that same month James VI finally
  renounced any dallyings with the Roman Catholics and concluded an alliance
  with Elizabeth. When Mary heard of this she wrote a letter to the English
  Queen in which she disowned her son, yet a few months before she had
  gracefully chatted with Somers, one of Elizabeth's Commissioners, about the
  marriage prospects of James. She was then in Wingfield Manor, heavily guarded
  with a retinue of nearly fifty people, and her alluring grace, her
  craftiness, showed in the meek terms she used to Somers. Well she knew that
  all her words and demeanour would be reported to Elizabeth and she affected
  an air of smiling resignation. She was old, she declared, and had done with
  ambition; she only wanted to visit James in Scotland and then to retire to
  France to live on her dowry. Nor had she any desire to marry again, 'seeing I
  have a son who is a man'. But on this same son allying himself with Elizabeth
  all her ambition and rage flared up with no hint of exhaustion or fear,
  though she was often so ill that she would exclaim, 'Would that I had died at
  Jedburgh!'</p>

  <p>The English Government hoped that the captive might make an attempt to
  escape or that some desperate champion would try to rescue her; in either of
  these cases her guards had orders to slay her at once. But no such incident
  saved the counsellors of Elizabeth the complicated pains to which they had to
  resort in order to destroy Mary Stewart. Walsingham's secret service was
  extremely efficient and a vast amount of zeal, patience and skill was used in
  the scheme, popularly known as the Babington Plot, that brought Mary to the
  block. A curious tribute to the competence of Walsingham's service is the
  fact that Mary, working through her two secretaries, Curle and Nau, employed
  over seventy cyphers and Walsingham's officials knew the keys to all of them.
  Moreover, Walsingham and his people knew where to put their hands on spies,
  informers and forgers both in England and on the Continent, for the English
  secret service worked through the underworld of Europe.</p>

  <p>Two Englishmen, George Gifford and William Parry, had been concerned in
  the Duke of Guise's plot for the assassination of Elizabeth in 1583. Though
  they had received an Indulgence from the Pope for this crime, they were men
  who played double games and betrayed the conspiracy to Elizabeth, who at
  first rewarded Parry, then, uncertain of his loyalty, allowed him to be put
  to death under the new laws against the Roman Catholics, and in his last
  moments Parry accused Thomas Morgan of plots against Elizabeth. This man was
  a loyal servant to the Queen of Scots; he had worked for her in transmitting
  her French money to England and in sending her foreign correspondence through
  the diplomatic bags of the French Ambassador in London. Elizabeth demanded
  Morgan, then in Paris, from Henry III, but the French king sent Morgan to the
  Bastille; Walsingham then used Gifford and two other of his spies, one Robert
  Bruce and Robert Pooley (Sweet Robin), to work on Morgan for Mary's ruin.</p>

  <p>Gifford had been in the English College at Rome, from which he had been
  expelled. After a roving life he had been received into the seminary at
  Rheims and soon was involved in the Duke of Guise's plots. His brother,
  William Gifford, was an honourable man who later became Archbishop of Rheims
  and Primate of France. Through his brother George, Gifford got into touch
  with Morgan. William Gifford acted sincerely and believed that he was
  introducing a useful servant to Morgan, who was also deceived and trusted
  George Gifford with the task that he, in the Bastille, was no longer able to
  perform&mdash;that of taking Mary's letters to and from the Continent; he
  also gave George Gifford letters of introduction to Mary and to the French
  Ambassador in London. In order to deceive Mary and her friends, Walsingham
  had George Gifford arrested when he landed at Rye, December loth (1585). He
  was brought before Walsingham who arranged with him the scheme to destroy the
  Queen of Scots, and from then on Gifford's part was that of
  <i>agent-provocateur</i>. His instructions were to gain Mary's confidence, to
  entice her into a plot against Elizabeth and thus to provide the Council with
  evidence against Mary that would cost her her life.</p>

  <p>Both the captive Queen and Morgan were deceived by the arrest of Gifford
  and completed trusted Walsingham's spy who called at the French Embassy for
  Mary's correspondence. The Ambassador, Guillaume de l'Aubespine, Baron de
  Châteauneuf, allowed Mary's letters to come in his bag as far as London and
  then gave them to one of her secret messengers, who took them to the Queen.
  Mary was then at Chartley in one of the houses long since destroyed. She had
  recently had difficulty in receiving her foreign correspondence, to which she
  attached great importance, though these packets of letters, sent so secretly,
  were often months old before she received them.</p>

  <p>Gifford had brought credentials from the Archbishop of Glasgow, Morgan and
  another of Mary's agents, Charles Paget, but Cordaillot, secretary to the
  French Ambassador, thought he looked too young and simple for the dangerous
  work he had undertaken. Also, the Frenchman noted, he was lodging with one of
  Walsingham's servants, one Thomas Phelippes. Gifford allayed these
  suspicions; he appeared to be, he said, at least ten years less than his real
  age, while as to Phelippes, he, Gifford, was picking his secrets for Mary's
  benefit. Moreover, Phelippes was secretly inclined to Roman Catholicism.
  Cordaillot was satisfied but the truth was that Phelippes though a man of bad
  character was scrupulously faithful to Walsingham; and he and Gifford worked
  together. Phelippes was thirty years of age, of a wretched appearance, much
  scarred by smallpox and remarkably proficient in cypher in Latin, French,
  Italian and, a little, in Spanish.</p>

  <p>Shrewsbury, being afflicted by ill health and the rumours that had
  scandalously connected his name with that of his charge, had been replaced by
  Sir Ralph Sadler. He, in his turn, had been thought to be too tender with
  Mary and at this time when she was taken to Chartley she was the ward of Sir
  Amias Paulet (or Amyas Poulet), an austere Puritan, who was not in the least
  moved by her graces or her sufferings, though he was, according to his own
  code, just and humane. As he regarded Mary as a murderess and one eager to
  plot the assassination of Elizabeth he was quite ready to fall in with
  Walsingham's schemes and he received Phelippes at Chartley, while to this
  place also came George Gifford with the excuse of looking after the paternal
  estates near by.</p>

  <p>Mary was closely kept by Paulet, who cut her off from almost all
  communication with the outer world. He carefully supervised her household and
  the sole news he allowed her to receive were letters from the French
  Ambassador that he read first. Mary had lived in this seclusion for nearly a
  year when Paulet connived at the trap for her destruction. She was allowed to
  receive a smuggled letter from Morgan recommending George Gifford, and one
  from Gifford himself offering to be her agent. Mary joyfully accepted in a
  letter to Morgan, sent by way of Gifford who at once gave it to Paulet. This
  man passed on the captive's letter to Phelippes, who opened and deciphered
  it, then sent it to Walsingham from where, after it had been resealed by
  Arthur Gregory, the expert in this department, it was returned to Gifford,
  who gave it to the French Ambassador. This complicated proceeding took place
  with all the letters that Mary entrusted to Gifford. Châteauneuf soon dropped
  his early suspicions and accepted the new agent.</p>

  <p>The business was made yet more intricate by a device thought of by
  Walsingham's spies: the letters were put in a tube that was attached to a
  cork and slipped through the bunghole of the barrel that provided beer for
  Mary's household. The brewer was paid by Paulet and Mary but, not satisfied
  with this, he threatened to tell Mary of the trap unless the price of the
  beer was sent up to an extravagant height, and Paulet had to yield to this
  blackmail.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was advised of all the details of this slow and tortuous plot.
  Her temper prevailed over her caution and she nearly betrayed Walsingham's
  elaborate devices by remarking to Châteauneuf that she knew all that was
  going on in her kingdom and in particular his secret dealings with the Queen
  of Scots&mdash;'besides, I was a prisoner myself in the time of the Queen my
  sister and I know what artifices prisoners use'.</p>

  <p>Châteauneuf thought this comment was a mere generalization and did not
  suspect the carefully baited trap.</p>

  <p>Early in the year 1586 one Thomas Salisbury and two priests, Ballard and
  Kerrill, who had been imprisoned, joined in a loose plot for the liberation
  of Mary, the revolt of the English Roman Catholics and, more vaguely still,
  the assassination of Elizabeth. With these plotters mingled Bernard Maud, one
  of Walsingham's spies, and a genuine plotter who had no suspicion that the
  whole affair was engineered by Elizabeth's secret service. This was Anthony
  Babington after whom the conspiracy was named. He was wealthy, of a good
  Derbyshire family, married with one child. He was gifted and serious minded
  but weak and easily deceived; his romantic disposition was incensed by the
  harsh laws against his co-religionists, the Roman Catholics, and by the
  poignancy of the fate of the captive Queen. His great fault was his
  half-heartedness. By the summer of 1586 he was the leader of the plot and had
  promised to raise a revolt in Derby and agreed to the assassination of
  Elizabeth. There were then thirteen conspirators of whom six, who remain
  nameless, were detailed to assassinate Elizabeth. But Babington blew hot and
  cold; sometimes he considered withdrawing from the conspiracy, sometimes of
  going through with it, sometimes even of putting the whole scheme before
  Walsingham. Meanwhile the Government spies led him on and encouraged him to
  send promises to Mary that only one long shut away from the world could have
  listened to; this was the strongest hope that had come her way for many a
  weary day and she was incapable of judging the importance of Babington and
  his chances of success. She would not consider how little likely it was that
  this 'foreign assistance' so often looked for in vain could be procured by
  this private gentleman. She was excited, joyous and confident; she forgot her
  ill-health, her resignation, her talk of retiring to a French nunnery; she
  saw only a chance of liberty, power, revenge.</p>

  <p>On June 25th (1586) she wrote a letter to Babington that was delivered by
  the usual laborious method to Walsingham and by him put before Elizabeth, who
  ordered the plot to be allowed to develop. In the first week of July
  Babington wrote again to Mary making wild promises. He undertook to deliver
  the captive Queen, to assassinate Elizabeth and to arrange for foreign troops
  to arrive at the English ports. Mary saw nothing crazy in a man like
  Babington undertaking so much, but she thought long over the reply that she
  composed with the aid of her two secretaries, Claude Nau, the Frenchman, and
  Gilbert Curle, the Scot. Both were utterly trusted by their mistress.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately neither of these men knew enough of world affairs to realize
  how poorly supported Babington was. They supposed he must be the agent for
  some huge Spanish-French plot for reinstating Mary and her Faith; but Nau did
  advise that his letter should not be answered and Mary was still shrewd
  enough to see the danger of possible discovery although so much encouraged
  and excited by the startling offers. She remarked that if this attempt was
  made, and failed, it would be a sufficient cause for Elizabeth to imprison
  her rigorously; but she could not forgo what seemed to her a glorious chance
  of obtaining all that she wanted. She no longer had any hope in her
  son&mdash;she knew him to be a pensioner of England. Only from the English
  Romanists and abroad&mdash;from Spain, whose King was her heir&mdash;could
  help come.</p>

  <p>She took one night to consider Babington's letter, then resolved to accept
  his offer. This decision showed remarkable courage and energy, for she was in
  such wretched health that she was often spoken of as dying, lame from an
  ulcerated leg, half paralysed from an infection of the neck and right arm,
  racked with rheumatism and obliged to spend so many hours in bed that she was
  afflicted with sores. Her misery had moved Paulet to send for a down mattress
  for her racked limbs and her guardians believed that she had not many months
  to live. Yet her spirit was unquenched. She overruled the doubts of her
  faithful secretaries and composed the letter for which Walsingham was waiting
  and that was her death warrant. To her gallant recklessness was always joined
  what was so often termed her craftiness; she took the same attitude towards
  Babington as she had taken towards the Lords at Craigmillar when they had
  offered to rid her of Darnley. She wanted the deed done; she wanted the
  benefit of it but she was not to be involved or blamed. There was not to be
  'any speck' on her honour.</p>

  <p>Babington, too, had been cautious; he wrote that six gentlemen were to
  undertake an office of special danger against the person of Elizabeth and
  wished to know what reward Mary would offer these valiant conspirators. Mary
  evaded any definite reply. She would stand aside and allow events to take
  their course, she would 'reward all those who would assist'. In sum she wrote
  approving of Babington's efforts, promising to do her part to make them
  successful and that she would recompense those who 'assisted' her in any way.
  That she was willing for Elizabeth to die was shown by her silence; had she
  wished to draw the line at assassination, she would have disclosed to the
  English Queen the lengths to which Babington was proposing to go.</p>

  <p>The rough outline of the plot was that when the attempt on Elizabeth had
  succeeded Mary should be rescued by force from Chartley or Tutbury and placed
  in safety until her adherents, aided by foreign troops, were sufficiently
  powerful to place her on the English throne. Mary's consent to so impractical
  and desperate a scheme has been put down to mental weakness induced by long
  imprisonment added to her lack of knowledge of European and English affairs;
  but her action was in character&mdash;she had always been imprudent,
  reckless, carried away by the excitement of the moment.</p>

  <p>Only this new hope kept her from complete physical collapse. 'Defluctions
  in the neck' gave her constant anguish; her women were often up with her all
  night; at times she could not use either of her arms. All these maladies she
  imputed to her long imprisonment, but her medical hi story shows that she had
  had the seeds of these diseases in her from early childhood; even had her
  life been free she had not the temperament to make it happy nor the physical
  health to keep it free from suffering, disablement and torment. It was the
  opinion of all about her that she had not, in this summer of 1586, long to
  live.</p>

  <p>But Walsingham could not wait. He continued his intricate plot even after
  Phelippes had sent him a deciphered copy of Mary's fatal letter, with the
  mark of the double gallows on the envelope. Since he wished his victims to
  commit themselves yet further he sent for Babington, with whom he was
  acquainted, and hinted that he knew of the conspiracy, hoping that Babington
  would confess. That young man betrayed nothing, however, but warned his
  friends. For himself, he fell into a desperate agitation and was half-minded
  to attempt the murder of Elizabeth, half-minded to flee from the country. He
  showed more plainly what had been vaguely apparent during the whole crazy
  affair signs of mental unbalance&mdash;the ardour of an exalted fanatic and
  the terror of a man betrayed.</p>

  <p>Soon after he forced money and arms on two of the 'six gentlemen' and had
  bade them carry out the attempt on Elizabeth. Scudamore, one of Walsingham's
  agents, was shadowing Babington and was about to arrest him in a tavern when
  the victim, taking fright, slipped away to Westminster and thence to St.
  John's Wood, where he hid in the forest for ten days with four other of the
  conspirators. Then the five men went to Uxendon, a moated house at Harrow
  where a Roman Catholic family named Bellamy resided. Here they received
  material and spiritual succour, being given the sacraments by a priest in
  hiding. On venturing to leave this shelter, however, they were arrested and
  sent to the Tower, where three members of the Bellamy family suffered death
  for this act of mercy.</p>

  <p>Walsingham then decided to strike at Mary. She had been moved from one
  gentleman's house to another at Chartley, near Stafford (always taking her
  retinue and her papers with her), for the past eight months, when Paulet
  suggested, in August 1585, that she might care to attend a hunt in the
  neighbourhood. Mary eagerly accepted the proffered pleasure and set off with
  her entire household. Her secret hopes and the excitement of the Babington
  conspiracy had improved her health and she was able to mount a horse and
  amble along with her train. As soon as she was well in the forest, Paulet
  raided her apartments and seized all her papers and what money he could find;
  though she had often complained of poverty her hoard was found to be
  considerable. But all was not discovered. Paulet wished to take away from
  Mary the means of bribery; she had, for this reason, been refused permission
  to give alms to the people dwelling near her prisons.</p>

  <p>While Paulet was thus impounding Mary's papers and cash Elizabeth's
  messengers overtook the cavalcade proceeding to the hunt and arrested Nau and
  Curle and ordered the Queen to the Manor of Tyxhall, the property of Edward
  Haston about three miles from Chartley.</p>

  <p>Mary's rage and despair broke into a violent passion. She dismounted and
  taking her stand under a tree refused to move, calling on her servants to
  protect her, while she abused Elizabeth and the English Lords. But Paulet
  forced away the protesting woman whose lamenting attendants followed her and
  all were lodged in Tyxhall while the incriminating papers were forwarded to
  London. Paulet received a grateful letter from Elizabeth, thanking him for
  his 'spotless endeavours and faultless actions' in 'so dangerous and crafty a
  charge'. Elizabeth also told Paulet to bid Mary to ask God's forgiveness for
  her treacherous dealings, adding that she, Elizabeth, had for many a year put
  her own life in peril in order to save Mary's and forgiven her much, yet Mary
  'must fault again so horribly, far passing a woman's thought, much less a
  Princess's'. Elizabeth wrote sincerely and truthfully. She had stood, on
  several occasions, between Mary and the will of the English Council and the
  rage of the English people, whatever her motives, and Mary was prepared to
  'look through her fingers' at the murder of Elizabeth, whatever her excuses.
  Elizabeth's indignation was not feigned, nor was her fear, but she still did
  not know how to dispose of her dangerous prisoner.</p>

  <p>When Mary heard of her rifled cabinets she broke into another storm of
  anguish and revealed her two life-long obsessions by declaring that no one
  could take from her the true Faith and her descent from Henry VII. On seeing
  beggars about the gate of Tyxhall Park she took the opportunity of remarking
  loudly that she, too, was a beggar, since all her money was taken from her.
  Curle's wife gave birth to a daughter and as a priest was now forbidden to
  the captives Mary herself baptized the child, giving her the name she herself
  bore. All the news that Mary was allowed to receive was dismal in the extreme
  to her who so lately had been bouyant with hope.</p>

  <p>While bells and bonfires showed the national relief at the discovery of
  the Roman Catholic plot Mary's secretaries confessed. Nau, after a denial,
  declared before Burleigh that his mistress's letters to Babington were
  genuine and that 'I wrote them from a minute in the Queen's handwriting'.
  Both Nau and Curle admitted that all the papers seized at Chartley were
  authentic; they could not have denied their own hands and cyphers and,
  damning to her as their evidence was, they were faithful to their mistress
  for whom they did their best. Nau, who had advised against answering
  Babington's most dangerous letter, had merely been obeying orders when he put
  Mary's notes into cypher. He owed his life to the fact that he was a French
  subject and lived to write a memorial, or life, of Mary that gives her side
  of her much debated story. In his own words he had spent twelve of the best
  years of his life in 'constant care, labour, trouble and exertion, in
  negotiation in almost every place in Christendom, in order that the Queen
  might gain her liberty, obtain possession of the King her son, and both
  preserve their rights to Great Britain'.</p>

  <p>The one man in England who dared to speak for Mary was Châteauneuf, the
  French Ambassador; he added some complaints of his own as he and his
  household were in danger from the London Anti-Popery crowds. He was told:
  'The people are excited and cannot be restrained' Walsingham adding 'The same
  thing happened in Paris the night of Saint Bartholomew'. Elizabeth was
  equally sharp when Châteauneuf complained of insults offered by the English
  to Henry III. 'No doubt,' she said, 'there are very many in Paris who speak
  ill of me.' Nor would she listen to the Frenchman's pleas for Mary, for she
  imputed the whole plot to her.</p>

  <p>The Ambassador knew nothing of the Babington tangle but had been
  intriguing with Mary and felt uneasy on his own account; he sensed
  Walsingham's trap and declared: 'There can be no other intention but by some
  means or other to effect the ruin of the Queen of Scots'. He stressed, in his
  letters to his master, that Mary was 'a Sovereign Princess and sister-in-law
  to Your Majesty', but considered she was in 'a wretched case'.</p>

  <p>In September (1586) Anthony Babington and the other conspirators were put
  to death with all the barbarity of the age, the last men to die for Mary,
  Queen of Scots. They made a full confession, further implicating Mary, who
  had been returned to her old residence at Chartley and was again seriously
  ill. Many of her servants were dismissed and she feared secret murder, a
  dread that had haunted all her imprisonment. Paulet waited on her to ask if
  she had any more money concealed. She replied in anger that she had none and
  that even the wages of her maids and valets were not paid. She refused to
  hand over the keys of her cabinet and made 'many denials, many exclamations
  and other railings against you and myself,' wrote Paulet to Walsingham. When
  bars were brought and the cabinets smashed in large sums of French money were
  found; in Nau's chamber alone were nearly two thousand pounds. Mary's
  vehement falsehoods on this occasion did not help her credit when she
  exclaimed, as she often did: 'I have never attempted anything against your
  Queen.'</p>

  <p>Elizabeth wrote to Mary on October 16th (1586) stating that as she had
  heard that Mary denied complicity 'in any attempt against our person and
  state' she would allow her to make her defence before 'divers of our chief
  and ancient noble men'. The only question then was under what charges Mary
  should be tried, what her status was, and how she might be brought under the
  English law. Robert Beale, Clerk to the Council, thought that she could be
  given the rank of a peer's wife, that she was not a queen and that she was
  amenable to the laws of the realm. Moreover, if she considered herself a
  prisoner of war she had no right to excite conspiracies. Mary did not so
  consider herself to be in any way answerable to the English crown; she would
  not concede that Scotland was subject to England, that her abdication was
  valid or that she was rightly detained. She held to the old story that she
  had come freely to ask Elizabeth's protection after this had been promised
  and that she had been most shamefully imprisoned without being allowed even
  to state her case or to see her protector. Elizabeth held to her old story
  that she had never invited the Queen of Scots, who had escaped into England
  from certain death at the hands of her subjects, that she, Mary, lay under a
  heavy suspicion of adultery and murder that she had never done anything to
  remove and that she had been given splendid asylum by Elizabeth, who had
  treated her with regal dignity and refused to sacrifice her to the demands of
  Parliament and people or to deliver her to the Scots. In return for this
  generosity, the English Queen argued, Mary had continually plotted to raise
  revolts in England and finally had been party to a conspiracy to assassinate
  Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>Mary was tried under a savage law that was valid in her case. If we admit
  that she had resigned her crown and was under English jurisdiction, she had
  committed by the Babington Letters a crime, the legal punishment of which was
  death; but she herself maintained that she was a sovereign Queen, liable to
  no laws and subject to no power. The case was most complicated and a torment
  to all concerned in it. All Walsingham's intricate scheming that cost so many
  lives and so much time and skill had the one purpose: to give an air of
  legality to the death of the Queen of Scots. All he&mdash;and the English
  Government for which he acted&mdash;achieved was a judicial murder&mdash;it
  can be termed nothing else since Mary's death was decided on before the trap
  was set&mdash;and the creation of another Roman Catholic martyr.</p>

  <p>The trial and death of Mary seems a political mistake, since she could not
  have lived long and her natural death would have robbed her of the chance of
  appearing as a heroine, of washing out her faults with her blood, and
  prevented the odium of her death from resting on Elizabeth and her
  counsellors. On the other hand, there is no doubt that both the English Queen
  and her advisers had their hands forced. It is difficult to realize now the
  acute peril that England was in from Roman Catholic powers and in particular
  from Spain, and the intense popular feeling against the Queen of Scots, the
  serpent on the hearth, always intriguing with England's enemies. She was
  popularly regarded as she is represented in Buchanan's well-circulated books,
  a 'curst' creature steeped in crime, who would murder all those who came in
  her way if she had the power to do so. It was common knowledge that she had
  been 'art and part' in the murder of Darnley, and many other crimes, invented
  by Buchanan and Lennox or repeated by them at second hand, were imputed to
  her. The people of England regarded it as an act of weakness, almost of
  treachery, on the part of their Government to keep the Queen of Scots
  alive.</p>

  <p>In September, 1586, Mary was taken from Chartley to the royal Castle of
  Fotheringhay, where the Castellan was Sir William Fitzwilliam of Milton. The
  captive brought with her a large household. Though she had lost her two
  secretaries and her 'massing priest' Du Preau had been removed, she still had
  a physician, a surgeon, an apothecary, gentlefolk as attendants, servants,
  and many articles of luxury, jewellery, bed furniture, virginals, watches,
  lutes, sets of tapestries and many gowns furred and adorned with intricate
  embroideries, besides three canopies, or 'cloths of State', and a coach and
  horses. Shrewsbury had never spent less on Mary's expenses than the fifty-two
  pounds a week that Elizabeth, both poor and extravagant, grudgingly allowed
  him. Mary's French revenues she had for her own use; they were still often
  overdue and her property was said to be underlet and poorly managed. But she
  often had large sums at her disposal. These she had used, during the first
  years of her imprisonment, to help her Scots friends, and afterwards to
  assist the different agents who conspired in her name. She was never
  frustrated in her desire to employ herself and her ladies in elaborate
  needlework; she took to Fotheringhay two sets of bed hangings she had not
  completed, 'black velvet garnished with blue lace' and 'net work and holland
  intermixed' (from Paulet's inventory). She also brought some of her pets,
  including 'beautiful little dogs'.</p>

  <p>Fotheringhay was a royal castle in Northamptonshire. The original building
  was erected in the reign of William I; that which Mary entered dated from the
  times of Edward Ill and Edward IV. It had passed into royal hands as part of
  the Earldom of Chester and the rich windows of the Manor House, attached to
  the Castle, were decorated with the arms of France and England, those of
  Neville and Mortimer, and those of Leon and Castile for the Spanish Princess
  who had married Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, fifth son of Edward III, at
  one time Lord of Fotheringhay. This royal residence had a notable history. It
  once belonged to the Earl of Rutland who was slain at Agincourt and was the
  birthplace of Richard III. Henry VIII gave the Lordship of Fotheringhay to
  his first wife; Mary Tudor used it as a State prison; Elizabeth gave the
  keeping of Fotheringhay to Sir William Fitzwilliam, whose family estate was
  at Milton. The Castle was large and imposing, built of stone, with a tower,
  double moat and battlements; it contained two chapels and a large hall as
  well as fine chambers and offices. The mansion or Manor House was within the
  Castle precincts. This residence covered ten acres, had two courts and was,
  as were most establishments of this size and period, self-contained; there
  were barns, mills, stables, kitchen well, granaries, storehouses, and a guest
  house named the New Inn. There is now no trace remaining of either castle or
  mansion; although a century ago some of the outbuildings were standing and in
  use as granaries.</p>

  <p>As soon as Mary arrived (September 1586) at Fotheringhay she complained of
  the meanness of the rooms allotted to her; this slight seemed more obvious as
  the Queen and her attendants observed several fine rooms unoccupied, and
  served to increase their nervous suspicions that some trial was
  intended&mdash;as indeed Elizabeth suggested in her curt letter to Mary
  (October 6th 1586). On the 11th of that month Elizabeth's Commissioners
  arrived at Fotheringhay and heard a sermon preached by Dr. Fletcher, Dean of
  Peterborough. The chief of these Commissioners was the Lord Chancellor
  Bromley, supported by the Earls of Oxford, Shrewsbury (summoned, but too ill
  to attend), Kent, Pembroke, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Worcester,
  Northumberland and Warwick, together with Burleigh himself, Walsingham, the
  Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and the Lords Chief Justices of the
  Common Pleas with many other judges and lawyers.</p>

  <p>Mary, who was denied counsel, at first refused to appear before this
  formidable tribunal; she stood upon her rights as a sovereign Queen 'by the
  Grace of God'. On October 1st Paulet had waited on her, advising her of the
  charges about to be brought against her and suggesting that she should
  confess her design against Elizabeth and ask pardon for it, an idea she
  scornfully put aside. She would not make things easier for Elizabeth by a
  confession; she spurned the bribe of mercy. It will never be known if this
  offer was sincere, but soon afterwards Melville had been allowed to join
  Mary's household. He brought with him his daughter and the daughter of
  Sebastien Page. The company of these two young women had given Mary pleasure
  but she had been greatly vexed by the dismissal of her coachmen and several
  other servants.</p>

  <p>A large train accompanied the Commissioners and most of these gentlemen
  and servants were lodged in the village and adjoining farms and cottages. A
  formal deputation waited on Mary and she replied to their haughty terms,
  addressed to 'The Scotish' (<i>sic</i>), with equal formality, going over the
  old ground of her sovereign rights, her refusal to submit to the laws of
  England, and her ill treatment at the hands of Elizabeth. She repeated once
  again that she had come to England, deluded by Elizabeth's promises of
  assistance, and had wrongfully been detained a prisoner. This reply was taken
  to the Commissioners, who were gathered in the room and the great hall of the
  Castle; the gist of her speech was put into writing and taken back to Mary,
  who approved it. The next morning some of the Commissioners again waited on
  her and reminded her that they considered her subject to the laws of England,
  and that unless she attended the tribunal she would be proceeded against in
  her absence. Mary wept but remained firm. She said she would answer for
  herself before a free Parliament, but not before these Commissioners 'who
  have probably condemned me unheard', adding that they should 'look to their
  consciences' and that 'the theatre of the world was wider than the realm of
  England'.</p>

  <p>Burleigh then took the lead and there followed an argument about canon and
  civil law. Mary contended that Protestants could have nothing to do with the
  first and that she was not answerable to the second. Burleigh reminded her
  that Elizabeth had saved her life at the time of the Norfolk rebellion and
  protected her from the fury of her own subjects; Mary made no answer. The
  next two days were spent in quibbles always conducted with elaborate
  ceremony. Mary showed spirit and courage and defended herself with much
  intelligence; Sir Christopher Hatton interrupted and tried to bring the
  argument round to the question of Mary's complicity in the Babington plot; he
  took a reassuring tone towards Mary, promising her that there was no 'danger'
  ahead for her and that she had only to appear before the Commissioners and
  establish her innocence, then Elizabeth would be satisfied. As for the trial
  taking place in the large hall (to which Mary had objected) Sir Christopher
  said that this place had been chosen because it was royal property; the
  chamber over the hall was adjacent to Mary's rooms and therefore convenient
  for her in her poor state of health, while the dais that would be erected
  there 'represents our Queen, as if she were here in person'. Burleigh
  interrupted Hatton by saying that the Council would assemble and proceed with
  their business whether Mary was present or not.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was kept informed of these proceedings and, vexed at Mary's
  refusal to acknowledge the authority of the Commissioners, she sent a
  post-haste courier with a letter to Burleigh ordering him to hold his hand
  until she had a full report of the proceedings, and a harsh note to Mary
  repeating once more that she, Elizabeth, had saved Mary's life while Mary had
  conspired against hers, charging her also to abate her arrogance and to reply
  to the Commissioners. The last line of this letter held out hope to Mary of
  'greater favour' if she would 'answer fully'.</p>

  <p>Mary spent a restless night; she felt it beneath her to appear before the
  Commissioners and yet she dreaded that her refusal to do so might be taken as
  a sign of guilt. In the morning (October 14th 1586) she sent for some of the
  Commissioners and made a long speech composed from notes she had contrived to
  write herself despite her crippled arm. This merely comprised her usual
  defence, and finally she consented to appear in the hall before the
  Commissioners. Pleased at this concession, the Lords, Judges and Knights
  glossed over the whole proceeding, which was undertaken, they declared, only
  that Elizabeth might be satisfied of Mary's innocence.</p>

  <p>Mary asked for a slight delay; she wished to take a little wine as she
  felt ill. At nine o'clock she entered the large apartment where the
  Commissioners were gathered and that was situated over the great hall of the
  Castle. Benches were placed either side of this chamber that was divided by a
  temporary barrier. Beyond this, as spectators, were the attendants of
  Elizabeth's Lords. These last sat either side of a table on which were copies
  of the Babington letters and other documents, and on the benches that were
  placed round three sides of this table. At the end of the room was a dais, an
  empty throne with the arms of England and a canopy, the whole representing.
  Queen Elizabeth. A contemporary drawing and a list of those present at this
  so-called trial enables us to reconstruct the scene. The right-hand benches
  were occupied by Burleigh, Bromley, and the Earls, those on the left by the
  Barons and Knights of the Privy Council. At the table sat the representatives
  of the Crown and two clerks to take notes.</p>

  <p>Mary entered with an escort of halberdiers. She was helped by her
  physician, M. Bourgoing, and Melville, for she could walk only with painful
  difficulty. Her train was held by a Frenchwoman, Renée Beauregard; her
  surgeon, Gervais, and her apothecary, Gorion, followed her together with
  three ladies, Gillis Mowbray, Jane (or Joan) Kennedy and Alice Curie. She was
  conducted to a crimson velvet chair to the left of the dais, with a
  footstool. (In the drawing of this scene Mary is the only woman present; her
  female attendants are withdrawn in the doorway.) The Queen wore a gown of
  black velvet, one of the pointed caps, since given her name, a white gauze
  caul or veils, stiffened with wires in the style that had been for so long
  fashionable, and a deep ruff. She exclaimed with vexation at being seated
  lower than the dais that was, she declared, her proper place and she remarked
  to Melville: 'Here are many lawyers, but none for me.' Sir Amias Paulet stood
  behind her chair and she frequently asked him who such and such a one was
  among the assembled Lords and Judges. Some of the peers had been her
  partisans, but, now that she was ruined, they found it prudent to appear
  among Elizabeth's Commissioners.</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor opened the proceeding. He stated Elizabeth's position,
  then Mary stated hers. There was nothing new in either speech. Bromley,
  replying to the Queen, utterly denied that she had come to England under
  promise of help from Elizabeth and declared that Mary's protest against the
  validity of the Commissioners was null and void. He maintained that Mary was
  subject to the laws of England; she maintained (though she never knew of
  Walsingham's plot) that these had been framed expressly to destroy her.
  Gawdry, the English Queen's Serjeant, came to the heart of the matter when he
  rose and spoke of the Babington plot, Mary's letters to this man and the
  existence of the 'six gentlemen' detailed off to assassinate Elizabeth.
  Mary's defence was that she did not know, had never seen or 'trafficked' with
  Babington. On this another lawyer produced copies of the Babington
  correspondence, his confession and those of Curle and Nau. Mary demanded the
  originals of the letters and to be confronted with her secretaries; she
  protested, as she had protested when faced with some of the letters she had
  written to those implicated in the Norfolk conspiracy, that her cypher had
  been tampered with. She 'formally declared' that she had never written the
  letters produced, or ever sanctioned any attempt against Elizabeth, though
  she had tried to escape from her 'miserable prisons' and to 'improve the lot
  of Catholics'. Babington and his fellows she described as 'a few desperate
  men' whose 'criminal projects' were planned 'without my knowledge or
  participation.'</p>

  <p>On hearing references to those who had suffered through the Babington
  plot, Mary appeared much troubled. She refused to credit Babington's
  confession and declared her belief that he had been hastily put to death in
  order that he might not be confronted with her. These disputes, largely
  technical, went on for hours with a short interval for a mid-day meal. Mary
  played her part with skill, courage and dignity.</p>

  <p>Yet the scene that should have been tragic was almost dull, for the
  conclusion was foregone and Mary was lying; though she valiantly fought point
  after point, often with success, falsehood lay behind all her vehement and
  clever verbal defences. Burleigh's succinct report to Secretary Davison sums
  up the position of the captive Queen clearly and coldly: 'Mary has denied the
  accusations. Her intention was to move pity by long artificial speeches; to
  lay all the blame on the Queen's Majesty, etc. And in these speeches I did so
  encounter her with reasons, out of my knowledge and experience, as she had
  not the advantage that she looked for. And I am assured that the auditory did
  find her case not pitiable, and her allegations untrue.'</p>

  <p>It seems, however, strange that Burleigh, with this boasted 'knowledge and
  experience', should have allowed Mary to be put in a position that posterity,
  if not the 'auditory' at Fotheringhay, might find 'pitiable'. It would not
  have helped her in the least to have had counsel, to have seen the originals
  of the Babington letters and to have been confronted with her secretaries or
  any of the conspirators. The case against her was so carefully arranged that
  Burleigh could well have afforded to have given her all the aid she required;
  her guilt would have been made more manifest by the production of the
  evidence she asked for so defiantly. But the English allowed Mary to exclaim,
  as she had exclaimed when the 'casket letters' were produced, 'several of my
  enemies have brewed this for me' and to pose as a greatly injured woman, as
  indeed she appeared, alone, defenceless, ill and fatigued, with none to speak
  for her and all the might of the English Law and 'ancient nobility' brought
  against her. Yet she aroused no one's compassion even when she 'blubbered a
  good deal'.</p>

  <p>These tears were not the result of fear; everyone who reported on her
  behaviour, and there were many to do so, noticed her courage. Paulet, writing
  to Walsingham (October 24th 1586) stated that Mary preserved her serenity.
  She was careful to have her rooms well kept, hoped and expected to have her
  money returned to her, was free from grief of mind, as far as Sir Amias could
  judge, and took 'pleasure in trifling lies'. She remarked to him that the
  history of England was extremely blood-stained, on which Sir Amias replied
  that Scotland, France and Italy were far worse in this respect. Mary turned
  the subject aside and Paulet did not think she was referring to her own case;
  he considered that she felt secure, 'utterly free of all fear of harm'.</p>

  <p>At this date Mary may have believed that she would escape with her life.
  She showed not only fortitude but cheerfulness and eagerly took up the part
  of persecuted heroine and valiant martyr, an attitude much encouraged by her
  attendants, all of whom were devoted to her and most of whom shared her
  Faith. Unfortunately she made many false statements besides her denial of any
  part in the Babington plot. She declared that she had no ambition, no desire
  to reign, and wished only to spend the few years she was likely to live in
  peace and retirement. When Burleigh reminded her of her first offence against
  Elizabeth, the assumption of the English arms, she put the onus of that
  action on her father-in-law, Henry II. She insisted, however, on her rights
  to the English throne and repeatedly remarked on her descent from Henry VII.
  She stated that the letters produced against her were a contrivance of
  Walsingham's for her destruction and added, yet once more, how easy it was to
  forge cyphers and handwriting. With great emotion she lamented the fate of
  the English Catholics. Burleigh answered that no one in England had suffered
  through religion, but only through treason, and this point was frequently
  brought up. Walsingham was disturbed by the Queen's charges and made the
  defence that whatever he had done it had been his duty as Secretary of State:
  'As a private person I have done nothing unworthy of an honest man'. As
  clever at quibbling as Mary herself, he protested that he bore her no ill
  will and wished no one's death, but had to be ever vigilant concerning the
  safety of his Queen and country.</p>

  <p>Mary admitted, at length, that some of the cyphers produced were hers. She
  agreed that Curle might have written some of the letters, under pressure from
  Nau, when she was ill. She stated she believed their confessions had been
  forced from them under threat of torture and she disavowed them both.</p>

  <p>On the second day of the trial she made a speech to the Assembly in which
  she again stated her position, stressing her weakness and defencelessness.
  Burleigh answered in moderate terms, but declared he had not the power to
  convene another Assembly, as Mary had demanded. The wearisome verbal duel
  continued, Mary disputing every point raised. One of the few dramatic moments
  in the dull proceedings was when Burleigh stated that Parry, one of Mary's
  servants, had been sent by Morgan, her agent, to assassinate Elizabeth, and
  Mary was startled into exclaiming: 'You are indeed my enemy!'</p>

  <p>Mary's letters concerning the proposed Spanish invasion were then read,
  and that giving Philip II her rights to the English throne: Mary declared:
  'On this point I have to answer to no one'. When the details of the Babington
  plot were further unfolded she replied that she knew nothing of them and that
  her name must have been used without her knowledge; her sole fault, she
  declared, had been too much 'gentleness and clemency', which had been abused
  by her Scots subjects. She had never heard of a proposal to burn Chartley,
  and as for any risings of the Roman Catholics they were so cruelly treated
  that they were 'in despair'.</p>

  <p>Burleigh again told her that no one in England was punished for religion;
  Mary again protested. When she was asked to withdraw, she remained seated.
  The Solicitor General then wished to know if she had anything more to say in
  her defence. Mary then rose and once more demanded to be heard in full
  Parliament and to speak with Elizabeth. She then pardoned the Commissioners
  and, rising, spoke to some of them, including Walsingham. Her remarks were
  speculations on the alleged confessions of her two secretaries. She then
  turned to the gathering and stated that she left her cause in the hands of
  God.</p>

  <p>On passing the lawyers Mary reproached them with their harsh handling of
  her case, all the worse as she had 'little knowledge of the laws of
  quibbling'. At this the Englishmen glanced at each other, smiling, and Mary
  smiled also at this silent tribute to her verbal skill.</p>

  <p>The Commissioners were willing to sentence Mary as soon as she had
  withdrawn, but Burleigh gave them the commands of Elizabeth to suspend this
  task until she herself should have read their report. The peers and notables
  then left Fotheringhay, arranging to meet on October 29th (1586) in the Star
  Chamber at Westminster. Walsingham regretted the delay and Elizabeth's
  hesitation; he wrote to Leicester bitterly that 'this accused creature seems
  to have been chosen by God for the punishment of our sins'.</p>

  <p>Paulet now conducted himself courteously towards the captive Queen. He
  rearranged the room above the hall where the trial had been held for her use
  and ordered a large table to be covered with baize so that she might play
  billiards. The extreme danger she was in had raised Mary's spirits; she
  appeared eager to die as a martyr for her Faith, and even once compared her
  sufferings to the Passion of Christ. Yet she held to the hope that Elizabeth
  would save her from death and told Paulet that she had observed compassion in
  the faces of some of the Commissioners. He replied that she was mistaken:
  'Not one of them was favourable to your cause,' and added that everyone
  marvelled to see her so calm&mdash;No living person has ever been accused of
  crimes so frightful and odious as you are'.</p>

  <p>Mary rejoined that her serenity arose from a perfectly clear conscience.
  She took the chance of repeating that she was eager to die for her religion,
  and he took the chance of telling her that it was no question of religion but
  of invasion and murder. This argument took place on All Souls Day. Paulet had
  instructions to try to force a confession out of the Queen who, deprived of a
  chaplain, had been praying alone in her oratory; but Mary refused to make the
  way of her enemies easy. She steadfastly asserted her innocence, even in face
  of 'the facts so clear and evident' that the Commissioners had found, and
  declared that her trial had been a mockery and her fate settled before her
  judges met.</p>

  <p>The interviews were conducted in French and much disliked by Paulet. He
  could endure, he said, Mary's passions and railings, but much of what she
  said was so 'idle' that he often left her while she was still speaking. He
  wrote to Walsingham begging that he might be spared, as much as possible,
  from arguing with Mary. 'I do not see what good can come of it.'</p>

  <p>The Commissioners met in Westminster, examined Nau's and Curie's
  confessions and found Mary guilty of compassing the 'hurt, death and
  destruction of the Queen of England'. There was only one dissentient voice,
  that of Lord Zouch, who was not satisfied that the charge was proved. The
  Commissioners also declared that James VI should not in any way suffer from
  the sentence passed on his mother, either in title, honour, place, degree, or
  right. Both Houses of Parliament then presented an Address to Elizabeth
  praying for the execution of the sentence pronounced on the Queen of Scots.
  The existence of Mary was, they declared, a certain and undoubted danger, not
  only to Elizabeth but to themselves, their posterity and the public state of
  the realm, as well as for the cause of the Gospel and the true religion of
  Christ, and for the peace of the whole realm. The Peers and Commons even
  feared that the heavy displeasure of Almighty God might fall on them if the
  speedy dispatching of Mary was neglected. Elizabeth held back; she asked for
  time. She mentioned that Mary was of her own kin, her own sex, her own rank
  and that if she would confess and repent, she, Elizabeth, would willingly
  pardon her&mdash;save that the good of England was at stake. After a delay of
  twelve days Elizabeth begged Parliament 'to devise some better remedy' to
  secure her own life and spare that of the Queen of Scots.</p>

  <p>Both Houses again earnestly deliberated on this issue and again declared
  that Mary's death was essential to the safety of England; but Elizabeth was
  still evasive.</p>

  <p>On November 13th (1586) Sir Drue Drury arrived at Fotheringhay and later
  Lord Buckhurst, with Beale, Clerk of the Council; their mission was to
  announce to Mary that she had been sentenced to death by the Commissioners
  assembled in Westminster. Buckhurst was known to Mary and had not been
  present at her trial. He had been chosen for his charm, talent and
  moderation, for Elizabeth still hoped to coax or bribe a confession out of
  Mary. Paulet was also instructed to watch his charge carefully and to note
  any 'secret matter' she might disclose. Buckhurst lodged in the village, but
  came to the Castle in order to consult with Paulet. On November 30th (1586)
  these two men and Sir Drue Drury waited on Mary after dinner.</p>

  <p>Lord Buckhurst formally delivered the case for Elizabeth and the English
  Parliament and Mary formally replied giving her usual defence. Both the
  English and Mary had become completely convinced that truth and justice were
  on their side. Even Walsingham, who had staged the Babington conspiracy in
  order to destroy Mary, was able to divorce this public action from his
  private honour and to persuade himself that he had acted honestly; his
  colleagues had no difficulty in taking the same view, while Mary had
  convinced herself that she was innocent and wronged. Mary's general admission
  that she was a sinner before God as was everyone else absolved her in her own
  mind from any individual charge and her own falsehood in denying every crime
  laid to her account.</p>

  <p>Buckhurst urged Mary to confess, saying that the Commissioners had
  condemned her to death and that Elizabeth would not be able to resist the
  pressure put on her to sign the warrant for the execution of this sentence.
  Beale spoke of the trouble she had been since she had been taken to Carlisle
  'for her own safety'. Mary retorted that she had gone there under duress and
  the three retired. Lord Buckhurst did not appear again at Fotheringhay.</p>

  <p>On November 24th (1586) Mary wrote an account of this interview to her
  steward and one-time ambassador in France, the Archbishop of Glasgow. This
  was one of her remarkable letters in which she was able to state her case
  with clarity, confidence and a specious air of detachment. Among the other
  epistles written in the last few months of her life it proves that her
  intelligence was not (as she had claimed) weakened by the tedious years of
  imprisonment and the increasing burden of her physical ills; indeed, so alert
  and shrewd are these letters, and so cleverly does she make herself out as an
  innocent person, persecuted for her religion, that it remains surprising that
  she did not manage her affairs better when she had full control over them.
  Her wits had not declined since she had written her clear account of the
  Rizzio murder to France. Her attendants recorded that her face was
  illuminated with 'an extraordinary joy' when she learned God had chosen her
  to die for the Catholic Faith.</p>

  <p>She was not prepared, however, to endure a paltry affront put on her by
  Paulet, who exceeded his instructions in taking down her canopy. There had
  been some trouble before over this emblem of royalty, but Mary had been
  allowed to retain it until she had heard the sentence that made her, in
  Paulet's opinion, 'only a dead woman, without the dignity or honours of a
  queen'. Mary protested vehemently and her attendants refused to dismantle the
  cloth of State; soldiers were brought in to do the work and the billiard
  table, as yet uncovered, was removed. Yet when Mary, who had been reading
  much history, spoke of the fate of Richard II, Paulet replied that she need
  not fear anything of that kind since she was 'in the charge of a Christian
  gentleman'.</p>

  <p>Mary believed that her death would follow soon on the departure of Lord
  Buckhurst. She summoned all her retinue, repeated once more her fidelity to
  the Roman Catholic Faith and her innocence of all the crimes imputed to her.
  She wrote three more farewell letters and gave them to her servants to
  deliver (they were not able to do this, owing to the restrictions imposed on
  them, until the following autumn); these were on the lines of that she had
  written to the Archbishop of Glasgow. That to the Pope (Sixtus V) might come
  under Paulet's strictures of being 'tedious and artificial', but it shows
  both spiritual and worldly pride. She made a 'general confession' of sin,
  without admitting to any one sin in particular, and implored His Holiness to
  accept her letter as her Viaticum, should she be deprived of a chaplain. She
  asked for prayers to be said for her soul and for the souls of those who had
  died or would die in the same cause. She mentioned her captivity and her long
  illness and the 'perdition' of her 'poor child' James VI, who, she still
  hoped, might be saved by the efforts of the Pope and Philip II. At the end of
  this composed and able letter she excused her writing, poor by reason of her
  crippled arm, warned the Pope of some English spies who were, she had heard,
  in the Vatican, and signed herself 'Marie, Queen of Scotland, Dowager of
  France'.</p>

  <p>The letter to the Spanish Ambassador in London, Bernard de Mendoza, was
  more personal, though parts of it covered the same ground. Mary noted that
  she heard workmen and believed that the scaffolding was being put up for the
  last act of her tragedy. She repeated her wish to make Philip II her heir,
  and informed Mendoza that she would send him the Duke of Norfolk's diamond;
  she referred to the pain she had in writing and to Nau, Curle, and another
  Pasquier, as having 'much hastened my death'. Her comments on her secretaries
  could easily be read as admission of her complicity in the Babington plot and
  of her knowledge that Mendoza was aware of this, so that he would understand
  her meaning when she wrote 'Nau has confessed all, Curle following his
  example' and, later, the comment that Nau had 'kept some papers' and that he
  and Pasquier were 'people who wish to live in both worlds if they can have
  their commodities'. The third letter was to her cousin, the Duke of Guise.
  The material was the same; the bearer was to show a ruby ring in token of
  being indeed a servant of the Queen of Scots. She mentioned that her dais had
  been taken down and stated that 'I showed them the Cross of my Saviour in the
  place where my arms had been on the said dais', but she admitted that
  Elizabeth was not responsible for this attempt to degrade her. These letters
  are dated from Fotheringhay November 24th (1586).</p>

  <p>Elizabeth still refused to sign Mary's death warrant. Burleigh became
  afraid that after all his exertions he would not yet get rid of the Queen of
  Scots. Paulet also wished to see the end of his troublesome charge; he feared
  an attempt at rescue and his garrison was increased to the number of seventy
  infantrymen and fifty archers, The formal protests against Mary's sentence
  sent by Henry III and James VI were ignored by Elizabeth and her counsellors.
  Mary was relieved when she heard that this same sentence had been publicly
  proclaimed, with sound of trumpet, at the market crosses of England.</p>

  <p>Both she and Elizabeth thought much about murder. Mary had long dreaded a
  secret taking off that might be imputed to suicide and followed by a false
  confession or repudiation of her Faith; she wished to make a brave end,
  protesting her innocence and her belief publicly at the last. On her side,
  Elizabeth dwelt on the extreme convenience it would be to her if Mary could
  be privately disposed of, without the odium that would attach to her,
  Elizabeth, if she signed the death warrant.</p>

  <p>On December 15th (1586) Paulet and Sir Drue Drury waited on Mary and
  returned her the money taken from her, less some expenses incurred on her
  behalf. She was in bed in pain from her ulcerated leg but showed no lack of
  alertness or promptitude in at once repeating her requests for permission to
  make a will, the return of her papers and the promise of passports for her
  servants. She also asked again for a priest, and Paulet sent to fetch the
  chaplain who was lodging in a nearby house. This was against his own wish, as
  he feared that 'this ignorant Popish priest' would only strengthen Mary 'in
  all her errors', and he described her fortitude in harsh terms when he wrote
  of her to Walsingham 'as perverse and obstinate', showing 'no sign of
  repentance and no submission. She does not acknowledge her fault, does not
  ask for forgiveness and shows no signs of wishing to live.'</p>

  <p>Soon after the priest, by permission of Walsingham, arrived at
  Fotheringhay. On December 16th (1586) Mary sent Melville to Paulet with a
  message that she wished to send Elizabeth 'a last farewell'. She had before
  said she could not write to the English Queen, as she knew not how to address
  her, being so humbled and deprived of dignity and title, and Paulet was
  suspicious that this letter might be poisoned. Mary satisfied him by showing
  him the open paper, passing it over her face, then closing it with white silk
  and Spanish wax. This famous epistle, written in French and dated December
  19th (1586), consists of yet another denial of the crimes with which Mary was
  charged, her joy in dying for her Faith, her thanks for the return of her
  chaplain and her money and her gratitude to Elizabeth for not ordering the
  removal of her canopy. She asked if her 'sister and cousin' would receive
  'the jewel' Elizabeth had once given her, and if she might send another jewel
  and her blessing to her son. In conclusion, she reminded Elizabeth that the
  time would come when she also would have to face eternity and judgement. She
  signed herself 'Your cousin and sister, wrongfully imprisoned, Marie
  Queen'.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth wept when she received Mary's letter and this alarmed Burleigh,
  who feared that this affair of the Scots Queen would never end before the
  country was invaded and his sovereign assassinated. England was disturbed by
  many rumours and alarms. Every day there was a scare of a new plot or an
  invasion. The Duke of Parma was reported as landing, the Duke of Guise also
  to be on the English coasts and the Scots massing on the Border. A sombre
  Christmas passed at Fotheringhay. Paulet, exhausted and over-strained, took
  to his bed, communicating with Mary by means of servants.</p>

  <p>In the first week of the New Year (1587) Mary, who had had no answer from
  Elizabeth, wrote again; this epistle was more moving than that which had
  drawn tears from the English Queen. Mary begged for her papers, and not to be
  kept in suspense any longer as to her fate, even for the sake of her poor
  servants, who were losing their time and their health in the cruel day-to-day
  waiting. She asked, moreover, if, at the hour of her death, she should have
  some secret that was for the ear of Elizabeth alone, to whom was she to
  confide it? She paid Elizabeth many stately compliments and sent her many
  ornate wishes of goodwill. Paulet made a to-do about sending this letter and
  in the end it never reached Elizabeth. Mary suspected that her correspondence
  was being delayed or interfered with and this added to a distress further
  increased when Melville and the chaplain (though both were allowed to remain
  in Fotheringhay) were forbidden to see her. Mary protested strongly and again
  expressed her fears of assassination; Paulet was outraged by this suspicion
  and assured Mary that she was as safe in his charge as his own wife. More
  bickerings concerned the supply of herbs for the Queen's health and the
  taking away of the rod that Mary's butler (in the absence of Melville)
  carried in before he served her meals. Paulet, though ill, was resolute; he
  had heard all the rumours of attempts to rescue the Queen of Scots and
  assured Walsingham that Mary should not escape him, unless he were slain.</p>

  <p>Secretary Davison held the unsigned death warrant and Elizabeth continued
  to hesitate in gloomy perplexity. At length she gave her counsellors to
  understand, using hints and veiled phrases, that she considered it their duty
  to have Mary murdered secretly, so that no blame or trouble should fall on
  herself. No one acted on these suggestions. All who knew Elizabeth knew that
  if the murder were discovered, that is, if Mary's death could not be put down
  to natural causes, the Tudor Queen would save her own good name by
  sacrificing someone else.</p>

  <p>On February 1st (1587) Elizabeth signed the warrant for the execution of
  the sentence on Mary. This was at Greenwich and Elizabeth put her name to the
  document carelessly, as if she were going to pretend that she had signed it
  among others, without looking at it; but later she made some comments on it
  and directed that Mary was not to be put to death in public, but in the hall
  in Fotheringhay Castle. She wished, she said, to hear no more of the matter,
  but almost at once reminded Davison that she considered the members of the
  Association drawn up for her protection should relieve her of this great
  responsibility by having Mary murdered; loyal subjects, she said, as Paulet
  and Drury claimed to be, should have already seen to this, since, while Mary
  lived, the life of the sovereign they had sworn to protect was in extreme
  danger.</p>

  <p>Davison, after conferring with Burleigh and Walsingham, sent Paulet a
  wordy letter the gist of which was that Elizabeth took it 'unkindly' that
  Paulet did not 'shorten the life' of Mary, since he knew that Elizabeth much
  disliked to shed blood, especially the blood of her own sex, kin and quality.
  Davison made the urgent request that this letter should be burnt; he would
  have been wiser not to have committed such dangerous matter to writing. Thus
  Mary's suspicions were justified, but Paulet kept the promise he had so often
  made her. He showed the letter to Drury and the two men sent an indignant
  reply in which they stated their 'great grief and bitterness of mind' at
  being considered capable of 'shedding blood without law or warrant'. In
  dignified terms they refused to commit murder, while offering their own lives
  to Elizabeth. They saw the trap in Davison's letter but they were, according
  to their own standards, men of honour.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth continued to dally with the warrant and it may be true, as she
  afterwards declared, that she intended it only to be used in the case of an
  invasion or an attempt on her own life. Burleigh, at least, did not trust her
  and showed her signed warrant to the Council, who at once agreed to appoint
  the Earls of Kent and Shrewsbury to see to its execution. Elizabeth received
  Paulet's reply on February 4th (1587). Before that she had sent for Davison,
  telling him, in grim jest, that she had dreamed she was punishing him for the
  death of the Queen of Scots and had told him she did not like 'legal methods'
  of disposing of Mary. On reading Paulet's letter Elizabeth fell into a
  violent rage and abused Sir Amias roundly, adding that she knew of others
  'who would not draw back'. But Burleigh and Walsingham were determined to
  give a legal colour to the death of Mary. The block was the usual penalty for
  political failure and the English have usually preferred judicial murder to
  private assassination; Elizabeth's counsellors, moreover, did not intend to
  give her the chance of getting out of her responsibility and punishing them
  to satisfy the Roman Catholic powers and James VI.</p>

  <p>Yet when Robert Beale arrived at Fotheringhay with the signed warrant he
  found Paulet and Drury still agitated by proposals to smother Mary secretly.
  This advice had been urged on Elizabeth, Beale thought, by the Earl of
  Leicester and the Scots Ambassador, Archibald Douglas, and there was again
  talk of the man Wingfield, mentioned by Elizabeth as a likely assassin. But
  Beale agreed with Paulet and Drury that murder was base and dangerous; it
  seems, also, as if it would have been impossible to have kept it secret,
  since Mary was surrounded by devoted attendants who would have had to have
  been forced away from her. Poison was the only method whereby the Scots Queen
  could have been privately disposed of and even this would have been difficult
  as she had three medical men in her train well versed in the knowledge of
  their profession as it then stood. The expedient of 'smothering' seems
  strangely clumsy.</p>

  <p>On February 7th (1587) Mary, seated at the foot of her bed, received Kent,
  Shrewsbury and Beale. Beale read out the document that Elizabeth had signed
  and informed Mary that her death could not be delayed, greatly reluctant as
  Elizabeth had been to consent to it. Mary behaved with her usual calm dignity
  and the exquisite courtesy she often showed even to her enemies. She answered
  at length, running over her sad story, her main grievance being her unjust
  imprisonment in England. Placing her hand on a copy of the Catholic Bible
  that lay near, she took an oath that she had never desired the death of
  Elizabeth. The Earl of Kent quibbled that the oath was of no value taken on
  this version of the Bible and offered her the services of the Dean of
  Peterborough for a death scene conversion. This Mary proudly rejected and
  asked for her priest. A religious argument then followed that reads strangely
  now; yet both the Englishmen and Mary were sincere in their rigidly held
  beliefs. She was convinced that she was saving her soul by remaining true to
  her Faith and they were convinced that they were trying to save her from
  damnation by forcing on her the learned Dean, Dr. Fletcher.</p>

  <p>On being told she was to die early the next morning Mary said the time was
  short, wondered Elizabeth should have allowed her death and wept a little,
  but not from fear. She could not obtain all her papers that she needed in
  order to make her will complete, nor a promise that she would be buried in
  France&mdash;at St. Denis, or beside her mother in the Church of St. Peter at
  Rheims. She asked if Nau was still alive, and on being told that he was she
  remarked that she had to die for one who had accused her in order to save
  himself. Mary's attendants begged a little delay in the carrying out of the
  sentence, but this was not granted.</p>

  <p>Mary was obsessed with this part of martyr she had taken up. She prayed,
  had supper and divided her money, directing that Nau should have his share.
  She distributed the contents of her wardrobe, her plate and her jewels. Among
  these treasures was a portion of the precious unicorn's horn, two lutes, a
  music book, family portraits, silver boxes, a little gilt bottle of sweet
  water, a gold bodkin with a sapphire at the end, a model cannon on wheels, a
  model bow and arrow, all of gold, a chain of coral and mother o' pearl, a
  little bear enamelled white, the ruby tortoise that had been Rizzio's gift, a
  pair of perfumed bracelets, intermixed with silk (that brings to mind the
  curious bracelet mentioned in the Glasgow letter), a golden jewel set with
  precious stones and a little golden bird enamelled green. Among those to whom
  she left these touching legacies were Sebastien Page and 'Bastien's wife',
  the groom and bride of the wedding feast held at Holyrood on the night of the
  Kirk O'Field murder.</p>

  <p>Those who had lived for so long in close contact with Mary during her
  misfortunes were strongly attached to her and the careful account of her last
  hours left by her physician, Bourgoing, testified to the affection and
  respect in which she was held by her attendants and the remarkable serenity
  she displayed. Her long, pious exhortations to her friends, however, were
  generalizations and revealed nothing of her character; she made no reference
  to any of the strange events that had darkened her life and touched on no
  personal matters. She was like an actress of genius, putting through with
  amazing skill the part of a deeply wronged, saintly woman dying for her
  Faith. She maintained this role to the last, with grace and elegance,
  spending the early hours of the winter day in what seemed an ecstasy of
  silent prayer. Before this final withdrawal she had written to Du Préau, her
  French chaplain, begging for his Absolution, and also drafted a will as well
  as she could without all her papers; the executors were the Bishop of Ross,
  the Duke of Guise, the Archbishop of Glasgow and the Chancellor of her French
  estates. She also found time to write the last of her remarkable letters;
  this was to Henry III and stated her case, for the last time, with dignity,
  clarity and calmness. She hoped Bourgoing would carry this letter and that
  Henry HI would take him into his service; she also implored her
  brother-in-law to look after her servants. It was, when she had finished this
  letter, two o'clock in the morning and Mary gave a glimpse into her secret
  mind by asking Joan Kennedy to read her the life of a saint who had been a
  great sinner; the good thief was chosen and Mary was satisfied. She then lay
  down to compose herself to prayer and, as Joan Kennedy afterwards reported,
  seemed, by the movement of her lips, to be 'laughing with the angels'.</p>

  <p>At six o'clock on the morning of February 8th (1587) Mary rose and was
  dressed in her most regal attire. She wore a skirt and bodice of black satin
  over a petticoat of russet satin, a long black satin mantle, edged with fur,
  the delicate caul of wired crape edged with lace, and a pointed cap over an
  auburn periwig. She had a chain of scented beads with a cross, and a rosary,
  and she carried a prayer book. She had prayed awhile in her ante-chamber that
  was arranged as an oratory and it was on her knees with her women that the
  sheriff found her when, bearing his white wand, he came to summon her to her
  death.</p>

  <p>Bourgoing suggested that the ivory crucifix from the altar should be
  carried before her by Annibal Stewart, her groom of the chamber, and this
  gave her deep pleasure. At the door to the great hall her attendants, weeping
  and protesting, were forced back and Mary, taking the crucifix from the
  servant, proceeded, supported on either side by one of Paulet's soldiers. Her
  weakness proceeded from disease, not fear; she did not change colour or give
  any sign of agitation. Melville was allowed to meet her; affectionate
  greetings were exchanged between them and William Fitzwilliam, Castellan of
  Fotheringhay, also respectfully greeted Mary. She had always been grateful
  for his kindness and courtesy and now she left him the portrait of her son
  that hung above her bed.</p>

  <p>Mary then, with smiling grace, asked that her servants might be admitted
  into the hall; she was most anxious to have friendly witnesses present as she
  feared that her enemies would give garbled accounts of her end, to her
  disadvantage. Kent and Shrewsbury allowed six of the men to enter and Mary
  chose Bourgoing, Gorion, Gervais and Didier. Her request to have some of her
  women was refused as the Lords feared painful scenes, but Mary was insistent.
  She reminded the Earls that their Queen was a maiden Queen and would wish her
  to have women with her, and as a last argument that she, Mary, was descended
  from Henry VII. Finally, Joan Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle were allowed to
  enter the hall that was hung with black, warmed by a large fire and divided
  by a railing. The scaffold was raised two feet from the ground and twelve
  feet square. Paulet and Drury were present as well as the two Earls. There
  was a guard of halberdiers and spectators to the number of about three
  hundred.</p>

  <p>Mary mounted the scaffold with Paulet's assistance and seated herself on
  the black-covered stool prepared for her while Beale read the royal
  commission for her death. She seemed utterly indifferent; some of the
  spectators noted her remarkable charm and beauty, others found her corpulent,
  flat-faced and round-shouldered. It was with 'a bright colour' in her face
  she made her last speech, delivered with perfect dignity and elegance and
  betraying nothing save the sentiments that had now become routine with her.
  She rejected the offices of the Dean of Peterborough and the prayers of the
  Lords and put up her own petitions, in Latin (the penitential psalms) and in
  English. This she did with great vehemence, striking her breast with the
  ivory crucifix. These prayers were long; she recommended many persons by name
  to the Almighty, including the Pope, and her enemies, among them Elizabeth
  Tudor. When she rose from her knees and began to disrobe her two women began
  to lament, on which she reminded them: 'I have answered for you.' Then,
  loyally composing themselves, they helped her to take off her upper garments,
  her collar, mantle and veil.</p>

  <p>She refused the rude help of the executioner and remarked that she knew
  the business better than he did and that never before had she undressed
  before so many people. Her eyes were bandaged with the fine gold embroidered
  chalice veil she had chosen the night before and so she was helped to the
  block, as she once again placed her hopes in her God. Shrewsbury, much
  overcome, raised his wand. At one blow of the axe the sufferings of Mary
  Stewart were ended; at the third blow her head was severed from the body.
  This, freed of coif and wig, now appeared that of an old woman with a grey
  shaven poll, when exhibited to the spectators. It was then placed on a dish
  and shown at a window to the people gathered in the courtyard. A ribald tune,
  usually played during the punishment of witches, had been performed here, but
  to such a slow measure it seemed rather a funeral march. The outer gates of
  the Castle were kept locked and there was no disorder. Everything to do with
  this tragedy that could be thus destroyed was burnt so that there might be no
  hoarding of relics; and one of the Queen's little dogs who had crept out
  under her gown was carefully washed.</p>

  <p>There was no beauty in her dead face or any likeness to what it had been
  in life. Her radiance was quenched suddenly, like a light put out. The body
  was carried by the sheriff and his men into a neighbouring chamber, where it
  was covered with the green baize that had been intended for her billiard
  table; her women were not allowed to attend to her remains but knelt and
  prayed outside the room until Paulet had the keyhole stopped up. By four
  o'clock in the afternoon the body was embalmed, wrapped in a waxed winding
  sheet and placed in a coffin. The next morning Mary's French chaplain was
  allowed to hold a Mass for her soul in the presence of her bereaved
  attendants, but the same day Paulet ordered the altar to be taken down and
  forbade any more Roman Catholic services to be held in Fotheringhay. Here the
  story of Mary, Queen of Scots and the pilgrimage of those who would follow in
  her steps ends, but a few more particulars may be of interest.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth at once tried to cast the blame of the death of Mary on to
  anyone save herself. She wrote to James VI deploring 'the unfortunate
  accident' that had deprived him of his mother and declaring that she was not
  so vile or so basely born that she would not have admitted her share in this
  tragedy if she had had one. James VI accepted these excuses with the same
  cynicism as that with which they were written. He continued to be the
  pensioner of England until he inherited the crown that Mary had all her life
  so keenly envied.</p>

  <p>On June 30th (1589) Mary's body was taken from Fotheringhay to
  Peterborough. The twelve miles journey took place by torchlight between ten
  o'clock at night and half past one in the morning. Full pomp was allowed the
  dead queen, whose body was in a hearse drawn by four black horses and set out
  with escutcheons bearing the arms of Scotland. Heralds accompanied the hearse
  that was followed by Mary's household, still detained in England. The Bishop
  of Peterborough, the Dean and Chapter, received the body, which was placed in
  a vault near to that where Catherine of Aragon lay. One Scarlett had, fifty
  years before, been the grave-digger for this queen and now performed the same
  offices for the Queen of Scots. On the next day a stately ceremony was held
  in the Bishop's palace. The hall was hung with mourning and a throne and
  canopy represented Elizabeth, for whom the Countess of Bedford stood proxy as
  chief mourner. A wax figure of Mary, attired in regal garments, lay on a
  bier, which was carried to the cathedral with great state. The Roman
  Catholics who had been in Mary's service refused to enter the church, which
  was surrounded by a large crowd. The order of the procession, as drawn up by
  Garter King of Arms, shows a handsome gathering that included seventeen
  'Scottes in Cloakes' and a 'Scottish priest' who was, in fact, Mary's former
  French chaplain Six gentlemen carried the body (one is reminded of the 'six
  gentlemen' who formed the darkest part of the Babington conspiracy). Mary's
  effigy was placed on a 'stately hearse...most beautiful to behold', set
  within the choir; it was richly adorned with the arms of Scotland, France and
  Darnley&mdash;no symbol represented Bothwell. The Scottish Unicorn was shown
  under several forms. The Bishop of Lincoln preached the funeral sermon in
  which he tactfully said that he had few remarks to make of Mary's life or
  death, as he knew little of the one and had not assisted at the other. Mary's
  regal coat of mail, helm, sword and shield were presented by Lord Bedford at
  the altar, then hung above her place of burial, where they remained until
  1643.</p>

  <p>Afterwards there was a banquet; Mary's one-time attendants dined and wept
  in a separate room. No inscription marked Mary's resting place until one of
  her followers, Adam Blackwood, contrived to hang there an indignant epitaph,
  that was soon removed. Elizabeth ordered and paid for all this elaborate and
  costly ceremony. She was vexed by the behaviour of Mary's former attendants
  in refusing to enter the Protestant church and delayed their release from
  Fotheringhay until the following October (1587); then they were allowed to go
  about their several missions.</p>

  <p>The Archbishop of Bourges preached Mary's funeral sermon before Henry III
  and his Court in Notre Dame. The eloquent preacher recalled the day of Mary's
  bridal in this same church, covered with jewels so that she shone like the
  sun 'so beautiful, so charming in all as never woman was'.</p>

  <p>Many miniatures and paintings were made as memorials of Mary, Queen of
  Scots; most of them appear to be based on the Sheffield portrait made some
  years before her death. A famous version, believed to have been painted by
  Amyas Cawood, belongs to Blair College, Aberdeen, and shows the Queen in the
  last attire she wore with the crucifix in one hand, the prayer book in the
  other. The work is unskilful, and to the left of the figure is a small
  representation of the Queen having her head struck off; above are the royal
  Stewart arms with the unicorn supporters; on the other side are the figures
  of Joan Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle in deep mourning; above them a Latin
  inscription gives the claims, captivity and death of the Queen of Scotland,
  while beneath the figure of Mary is an even more emphatic account of her
  fate. The face is serene and smooth and bears a considerable likeness to the
  early French portraits of Mary. This picture was painted for Elizabeth Curle
  and by her bequeathed to the English College at Douai. A longstanding
  tradition states that one of the Queen's attendants, the above-mentioned
  Amyas Cawood, painted, probably from memory or from a sketch made on the
  spot, the head of the dead Queen, and that the picture now at Abbotsford,
  signed and dated a year after Mary's death (by error?) is this picture.</p>

  <p>Many of Mary's personal possessions and treasures are still preserved. A
  large number of them, from private collections, were gathered together in the
  Glasgow Exhibition of 1888 that was held in a reproduction of the old
  Bishop's Castle of Glasgow, and among these remarkable relics of great
  interest and beauty were the cuff of one of Darnley's gloves, worked by Mary
  in July 1565; part of the christening robe of James VI, in salmon colour,
  with gold thread, lined with white, all of silk; a workbox with the emblem of
  the Marguerite used by that ancestor through whom Mary held her
  never-forgotten claims to the English throne; a gold, white and red enamelled
  crucifix that Mary used at Fotheringhay; the leading strings she worked for
  James VI and the prayer book she held at the last&mdash;this exquisite piece
  of work was printed at Lyons in 1558 and bound in embossed crimson silk
  velvet&mdash;and a charming glove of light buff leather, embroidered with
  silver, roses of light and pale blue and lined with crimson velvet. The
  catalogue description states that this glove was given by Mary to Marmaduke
  Darell on the morning of the execution of the death sentence; this name is
  among those 'gentlemen in gowns' who accompanied Mary's body from
  Fotheringhay to Peterborough Cathedral.</p>

  <p>In this exhibition was shown a Dutch watercolour drawing of the beheading
  of Mary, the music 'Jumping Joan' said to have been played in the courtyard
  of Fotheringhay Castle and many letters from Mary and her mother, together
  with magnificent specimens of her needlework.</p>

  <p>James VI was long credited with having demolished Fotheringhay Castle and
  mansion; this, however, was not so. The buildings were destroyed by the usual
  enemies of great houses in England, the Civil War and time, until of the
  former nothing was left 'but a few stones and clumps of thistles' and of the
  latter a few scattered barns or so put to mundane uses. Some of the
  materials, arches, columns, stones, including portions of the Great Hall and
  so on, were said to have been taken from Fotheringhay to other places, used
  to build a chapel at Fireside near by, and to repair the banks of the River
  Neu. Some of the stained-glass windows of Fotheringhay Castle were taken to
  the mansion of Obby Milton, belonging to Sir William Fitzwilliam, where he
  kept the portrait of James VI given to him in return for his courtesy by
  Mary, and another of herself, painted in 1582.</p>

  <p>In August 1603 James VI of Scotland, I of England, decided to honour his
  mother's memory and sent a splendid pall to Peterborough Cathedral to be laid
  over her hearse still standing in the choir. In September 1612, nine years
  after, James decided to have Mary's body removed to Westminster Abbey; he had
  remembered this costly pall that he thought the Dean and Chapter might claim
  as a perquisite and directed that they should be paid a fee in order that it
  might be laid over Mary's coffin when this was brought to London. The
  erection of her tomb in Westminster Abbey had been begun in May 1606. Two
  hundred pounds were then' paid to Cornelius Cure, 'Master Mason of his
  Highness' works'; the next payment was made four years later, to his son,
  William. The payments were completed in 1613 and amounted to £825 10s. The
  tomb was painted and gilded in 1616 by James Mauncy, who was paid £265 'in
  full satisfaction'.</p>

  <p>There is no record of the last journey of the body of Mary from
  Peterborough Cathedral to Westminster Abbey. Her alabaster tomb is famous and
  beautiful; the serene face is certainly a likeness taken from one of Mary's
  portraits and the monument is not far from another equally splendid, erected
  to the memory of Elizabeth Tudor, also by order of James VI of Scotland and I
  of England.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-5"
     id="ch-5"></a>NOTES</h2>

  <p class="first">A detailed account of Queen Mary's life when under the care
  of Lord and Lady Shrewsbury can be found in <i>Mary, Queen of Scots in
  Captivity</i> by John Daniel Leader, Sheffield and London, 1880. This
  follows, with minute care, the day-to-day existence of the Queen and gives
  long descriptions of the incessant and complicated plots in which she was
  involved from January 1569 to December 1584 when Shrewsbury was at last
  relieved of the tedious burden that had cost him so much in ease of mind,
  family peace and money. This book also contains much of Mary's correspondence
  and some of that exchanged between Shrewsbury and Walsingham. Though Mary
  wrote several notable letters, famous both for their contents and their
  style, much of her correspondence is as monotonous as her continual
  intriguing; her subject matter is nearly always the same, her attitude
  persistently that of an injured innocent woman, her manner moody and
  garnished with dull generalizations that appear to have been copied from some
  book of devotions or remembered from her schoolroom days. One exception to
  the tedium of the prisoner's tone of suffering resignation is the so-called
  'Scandal Letter' given by J. D. Leader in the original French; it has often
  been reprinted, is preserved among the Cecil papers at Hatfield and was
  accepted as genuine by that warm admirer of Mary, Prince Labanoff. But as its
  authenticity is still in question, as it did not reach Elizabeth, being
  either kept by Mary or intercepted by Burleigh's spies, it has not been
  mentioned in the text of this book. It consists of a bold retaliation against
  the Countess of Shrewsbury for the slanders she was spreading against Mary
  and Shrewsbury, and details all the gossip, wholly unfavourable to Elizabeth,
  that Lady Shrewsbury had recounted to Mary. The date of this letter is not
  known; it was probably the spring of 1584 and it appears to have been written
  from Sheffield and not, as is sometimes stated, from Wingfield or Chartley.
  It is not of importance save in showing the corruption of the times, Mary's
  knowledge of all the scandals of the English Court and the spite with which
  the two Queens and the Countess were involved. If it is a forgery the
  questions arise as to who forged it and why; it would be idle to attempt an
  answer here. Knollys relinquished his charge of Mary Stewart with deep
  gratitude; 'to be rid of her' was the desire of his heart. He declared he
  would 'suffer any punishment' rather than continue in the task of keeping the
  Queen of Scots safely, but his task ended when he delivered his prisoner to
  Shrewsbury in Tutbury Castle, then used as a hunting lodge. At first
  Shrewsbury found the Queen docile, a surprise to Knollys, who had often
  flinched before her mockery and violence. This George Talbot, 6th Earl of
  Shrewsbury, was a man of considerable wealth and importance. He possessed
  huge estates, seven mansions, and two others in the name of his wife. His
  chief seat was at Sheffield, the Castle in the park of magnificent trees that
  also enclosed the Manor House and a Lodge, or Turret House believed to have
  been built by him to secure his prisoner. He held the Manor of Worksop and
  Wingfield, the Abbey of Rufford, the Hall at Buxton, and the lodge or castle
  at Tutbury. Chatsworth belonged to Lady Shrewsbury, through her marriage with
  a Cavendish, and Hardwick had come to her from her father. These splendid
  residences were within easy distance of one another and the country
  surrounding them was part of the Talbot estate. Mary, as has been noted,
  moved from one to another of the Shrewsbury residences. Fourteen years of her
  captivity were spent in Sheffield Castle, Manor House or Lodge. These
  mansions were always handsomely furnished; tapestries and other luxuries for
  Mary's use were even sent from the Tower of London, a storehouse of royal
  possessions. The laborious nature of Mary's journeys from one English castle
  to another and the care with which they were undertaken is shown by several
  itineraries extant. One, reconstructed by Mr. Leader from the letters of
  Knollys to the Privy Council, was from Bolton to Tutbury in January 1569. The
  first stage was to Ripon, sixteen miles; there Mary stayed 'in a gentleman's
  house' while her retinue was housed in Ripon. The next stage was one of ten
  miles to Weatherby, then to Pontefract, then to Rotherham, then to
  Chesterfield, then to Wingfield and Derby and finally to Tutbury. The
  important and attractive city of Sheffield has no trace of the vast park, the
  noble avenues, the three residences so familiar to Mary of Scotland. Even
  when the Talbots owned the land, Sheffield was famous for cutlery, and the
  development of this and other industries destroyed what the Civil War had
  left of the Castle that was demolished, like so many other ancient
  strongholds, during the Commonwealth. The stone, as usual, was taken for
  other buildings and the site of the Castle is covered by streets. The Manor
  House remained, in fair preservation, longer than the Castle. In 1875 the
  considerable ruins of the Lodge or Turret House were restored; a description
  of the then state of the building was given in a paper read by M. Charles
  Hadfield before the Royal Institute of British Architects, quoted by Thomas
  Winder in his pamphlet, <i>The Manor Lodge, Sheffield</i>, 1919. This 'Manor
  Lodge' is the Manor House that stood two miles from the Castle in the
  magnificent park, and not the Lodge built by Shrewsbury and, as is believed,
  especially for Mary's use; this is now known as the Turret House. Old
  drawings of Sheffield Manor show it to have been an impressive building,
  rising from a forest of oaks and near the famous walnut tree avenue that was
  standing as late as 1781. Wingfield Manor House was similar in style. The
  principal remains at Sheffield consist of a few walls and chimney stack and
  the so-called Turret House, the building especially erected by Shrewsbury in
  1574 for, it is believed, the safe keeping of the Queen. It was restored by
  the late Duke of Norfolk in 1872, after it had been discovered among some
  farm buildings. It is square, three storeyed, and stands outside the defences
  of the Castle. Tiles of French origin were discovered here round the
  fireplace of what has long been known as <i>Queen Mary's Room</i>. This
  battlemented Tudor building, with a lead-covered roof, has a turret from
  which it takes its name and three chimney stacks. It faces the main entrance
  to the Manor Lodge or House. A stone stairway leads from the ground floor to
  the turret. Mary would be under constant observation in this compact dwelling
  and also separated from Shrewsbury's household. During the early part of her
  stay in Sheffield she was free of the splendid park, but afterwards took her
  exercise on the leaden roof. The Queen's room is finely decorated with Talbot
  and Shrewsbury mottoes. These details of the only surviving English prison
  inhabited by Mary, Queen of Scots is from M. Winder's pamphlet that gives a
  full account of this fascinating relic. This pamphlet, Mr. Leader's rare
  book, and <i>Sheffield</i> by Mary Walton, 1948, have been kindly brought to
  the notice of the author by M. J. P. Lamb, City Librarian of Sheffield City
  Libraries. Tyxhall (or Tixhall) was recently built when Mary was taken there;
  nothing remains but the gateway. Chartley is a ruin, the bases of two towers.
  Both Tyxhall and Chartley, situated in delightful country, can be visited
  from the charming town of Stafford&mdash;the Stafford rural
  district&mdash;including the northern borders of the famous Cannock Chase
  that sheltered the fallow deer that Mary, pining in confinement, longed to
  hunt. It was here that she was taken, on a false promise of assisting at a
  chase, from Chartley to Tyxhall while her papers were seized, and here, in
  some glade or forest similar to the woods of Cannock Chase, that she stood at
  bay, like the animals she had so often watched being brought down by the
  hounds. Mary, her mind always full of hunting terms, spoke of her own end as
  'my last taking'. The following additional information with regards to Buxton
  is from Mr. Ernest Axon's <i>Historical Notes on Buxton</i>, supplied with
  great courtesy by Mr. John Robinson, Entertainments and Publicity Manager,
  Pavilion Gardens, Buxton. The New Hall, Mr. Axon thinks, was built especially
  for Mary; this opinion is based on a letter written by Lord Shrewsbury in
  which he writes of the 'house not being finished' now, but this might refer
  to repairs and furnishing. This house adjoined Buxton Well and was on the
  site of the Old Hall. This New Hall became the chief Inn of Buxton for
  three-and-a-half centuries; it was sometimes known as 'The Inn of the Sign of
  the Talbot'. Although often altered and repaired, some portions of the 1572
  buildings still remain. Mary found health as well as opportunities for
  plotting in the visits to the pleasant town of Buxton that she helped to make
  famous. She was one of many celebrated visitors who found ease in what she
  termed 'La fontaine de Bogsby' or 'Bookston Well', and the above-mentioned
  pamphlet gives a description of the graceful tribute she paid to Buxton by
  having a design placed on a window that was probably put together by her
  secretary, Nau, or one of his family. This was composed of anagrams, cyphers
  and monograms, verses in Greek and French, phrases in Latin; the celebrated
  testimony to the virtues of Buxton was not on this window but on another.
  Both have long been lost. Mary's visits to Buxton lead one to the question of
  her health, which was such an important factor in her life. It would be a
  curious study to investigate the causes and nature of her continual
  illnesses, but it is doubtful if the science of the sixteenth century was
  sufficiently advanced for the medical opinions available on Mary's case to be
  of much value; we do not even know the nature of the pills that caused her
  such distress, even to convulsions, and eventually relieved her, or if the
  pain in her side was really due to 'an indurated liver'. It has been thought
  that while in England she affected illnesses in order to move Elizabeth and
  make things difficult for her jailors, but her record, from her earliest
  childhood, contradicts this. Her afflictions seem to have been genuine.
  Elizabeth, afraid that Mary would die and she, Elizabeth, be accused of her
  death, sent English physicians to examine her, but they could make little of
  the complication of diseases that tormented her. Malaria was then endemic in
  Europe and she may have suffered from that. The Englishman's diagnosis of
  'the mother' (i.e. hysteria) was undoubtedly correct. The damp rooms, foul
  smells, lack of exercise, frustration and constant disappointment that Mary
  herself so often declared to be the roots of her illnesses were probably part
  of her trouble but part only. It was an unhealthful age. The constant
  sickness of young and old, the short expectation of life, the sudden deaths
  from poison (not maliciously administered) were the result of airless damp
  rooms, draughty passages, over-rich and over-plentiful food, too much
  alcohol, unhealthful clothing, infection everywhere through lack of drainage
  and cleanliness. There were also the endemic ague, malaria, smallpox and
  measles, besides epidemics of cholera and typhus. Lack of dentistry and
  personal hygiene added to the miseries of these short lives. But Mary's case
  was wretched, even for those days, and her death, though seeming so tragic,
  was in reality the conventional 'merciful release' from sufferings that must
  have been almost intolerable. The iconography of Mary Stewart is a subject by
  itself and one that has been dealt with exhaustively; few likenesses of Mary,
  apart from the early French drawings and the statue on her tomb, give any
  idea of her beauty. The last (the sculptor is unknown) is probably taken from
  the wax effigy that lay on the hearse in Peterborough Cathedral. That, in
  turn, was taken from portraits in possession of the Queen's attendants. The
  story that a death-mask was made of her features is most unlikely in view of
  the manner of her death. The Sheffield portrait, painted when Mary was
  thirty-six years old, is so poorly executed that it gives the impression of a
  plain woman with large ugly hands and a squint. In the memorial portrait
  based on this, the appearance of Mary is much improved. In a letter to the
  Archbishop of Glasgow, January 1575, Mary asked for portraits of herself,
  four in number, to be sent to her secretly, for presentation to her friends
  in England. These, made second or third hand, are probably among the many
  curious portraits 'alleged' to be of Mary; they must have been painted from
  an early likeness made while the Queen was in France, or wholly fanciful. It
  is strange that she should have wished to send the ugly Sheffield picture to
  France. There are many versions of this; that at Hardwick it is believed to
  be the original&mdash;it is the only one signed. In <i>Life of the Queen of
  Scots</i>, by Dr. Chalmers, is an account of a composite portrait of Mary,
  made under the direction of Chalmers by a painter named Pailou. He considered
  the sculpture on the tomb to be the best likeness and was confused by the
  different colourings given in different portraits; the hair, now black, now
  auburn, can be accounted for by the use of periwigs, but the eyes, now grey,
  now chestnut-coloured, now hazel, remain a puzzle. Many of these pictures
  must have been painted by men who had never seen Mary. The weight of evidence
  is in favour of her having light auburn hair, often in her youth powdered
  with silver to look ash blonde, and eyes that flattery might term golden.
  Mary had high cheek-bones, a lofty forehead, faintly marked (possibly
  plucked) eyebrows, a thin mouth, a depression in her chin, a long, fine nose
  and an oval face. No catalogue of her features, however, can do justice to
  the 'alluring grace' that must have lain largely in her vivacity, charm of
  manner and elegant splendour. Mary Stewart was the last of those who could be
  considered as being 'art and part' in the Darnley murder, that mysterious and
  well-arranged crime, to suffer a violent death, but a strange echo of Kirk
  O'Field comes in 'Gunpowder Plot', directed, amongst others, against
  Darnley's son, James VI and I. These appear to be the only known instances of
  murder and attempted murder by means of explosives lodged in lower chambers
  or vaults.</p>
