  </div>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">A MAROON sedan bored steadily into the night, its headlights
  picking a deserted, narrow road out of the darkness. It was coming from
  Washington, but it was approaching New York from the north. The Captain of
  Infantry who drove it had changed its license plates three times since its
  stealthy departure. He was in civilian clothes, as were his two grizzled,
  stalwart passengers.</p>

  <p>The hat-brims of all three were pulled low over their brows, their coat
  collars turned up about their jaws to hide their faces even in the auto's
  dark interior.</p>

  <p>The man on the right of the rear seat glanced at the glowing dial of his
  wristwatch. "Eight-thirty, General," he muttered. "We'll be there in half an
  hour, right on time. I, for one, will be damned glad of it."</p>

  <p>"No more than I, Johnson," his companion growled. "This damned secrecy is
  nonsensical. Here we are, the commanders of the Coast Defense Forces and the
  Air Corps, sneaking through our own country like a couple of hunted
  criminals. One would think we were at war and in enemy territory."</p>

  <p>"The Secretary of War's orders, sir. He..."</p>

  <p>"The Secretary's an ass! Strictly between ourselves, of course." The
  speaker swayed as the car started to round a curve that was a dark tunnel
  through thick set, overhanging trees. "The Intelligence outfit's balderdash
  about espionage has him bulldo&mdash;" Abrupt brakes cut him off, jarred him
  forward. The car-horn blared raucously. "What the...?"</p>

  <p>"Unlighted car blocking the road, sir," the chauffeur explained crisply.
  "I'll have to..." Something thumped on the running board. The captain's hand
  darted to his holstered gun. The door crashed open.</p>

  <p>A black figure lurched in, flailed a blackjack against the driver's skull
  before he could draw his weapon. In the same moment, others, springing masked
  and shapeless out of the leafy murk, invaded the rear. Muffled shouts, a
  brief struggle, ended in two meaty thuds. Someone groaned.</p>

  <p>"Work quickly," a guttural voice grunted. "We have no time to lose!"</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">STREET lamps made little impression on the gloom of the
Fourth Avenue
  block that is known as the Port of Missing Books. The atmosphere seemed
  filled with a dusty haze rising from the countless ancient volumes housed in
  the second-hand bookstores that border its dingy walks.</p>

  <p>The drowsy shops were darkened, shut for the night. All but the one whose
  drab sign read, Duane's Second-Hand Bookstore. Through that one's
  dirt-encrusted windows a dim luminance still seeped and in its open doorway an
  alpaca-coated form stood gaunt and tall despite its stoop.</p>

  <p>Ford Duane's silhouette was that of an age-wearied man, worn and languid
  and as nearly ready for the rubbish-heap as the merchandise he purveyed. Had
  the light fallen across his face it would have been revealed as too young for
  one who spent his life in this back-eddy of the Metropolis, its lid-veiled
  eyes too blue and keen... Some peculiar quality there was in that furtive
  keenness. A wary fierceness such as lives in the eyes of a jungle beast that
  is hunter and hunted at once. There was Death in those eyes. Death which
  their owner had dealt and would deal again. Death that inevitably would be
  dealt to him were their ceaseless vigilance even momentarily relaxed.</p>

  <p>A strange bookseller? Strange indeed. An unnamed, unnameable soldier in
  the invisible, endless war that knows no screaming headlines, no marching
  bands. In the war without glory and without honor whose insidious plot and
  counterplot endangers an unknowing nation more virulently than even booming
  cannon and zooming planes.</p>

  <p>A shabby derelict of the night shambled past. A distant, single bong
  vibrated against the city's never-ceasing hum. Duane glanced up at the
  Consolidated Gas Company's tower clock, hanging like a yellow, figured moon
  over Fourteenth Street. Eight-thirty. He sighed, turned to go in.</p>

  <p>The deep purr of a high-powered motor stopped him, the sough of its
  brakes. Imperceptibly Duane tensed, came slowly around again to the street.
  To a sleek limousine from out of which a liveried chauffeur jumped.</p>

  <p>The man opened the rear door. The act turned on a light, and made a small,
  taupe-upholstered room of the car's interior.</p>

  <p>"Come here, please." The voice was high-pitched, querulous. An incredibly
  wrinkled little face peered out at Duane. The old woman was tiny in the big
  seat, was swathed in funereal silk. An ebony cane diagonaled from seat-edge
  to floor and the woman's hand gripping it was gray and shriveled like old
  bone.</p>

  <p>Ford Duane's hand, sliding into his trouser pocket, touched metal. He
  slouched across the sidewalk, halted a foot before he reached the mechanic
  who stood stiffly at attention, holding open the door. Duane's position was
  such that he had man and mistress in range of his vision, could act swiftly
  at any overt move on the part of either.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame," he said quietly. "What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"You can come nearer," she snapped, her tone that of one used to authority
  and its exercise. "Do you expect me to shout my business to the town?" Duane
  saw that there was a flat, square package on the seat beside her. "Pat won't
  let the door slam on you, if that's what you're afraid of. Will you,
  Pat?"</p>

  <p>"No, ma'am." The man touched an extended finger to his cap visor. "I will
  not." But Duane didn't hear him. There had been the slightest of slight
  stresses on the repeated name, <i>Pat.</i> A muscle twitched in the bookman's
  cheek. That name was spelled P-A-T. The three letters had a meaning for
  him... His fingers slipped from the automatic in his pocket and he put a foot
  on the running board, leaning in.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked again, loud enough for any possible eavesdropper in
  the shadows to hear. "You were looking for me?"</p>

  <p>"No. I came to New York to see Laroux, the art dealer at the end of the
  block. But this insane motorcar went mad in Jersey City and by the time Pat
  brought it to its senses it had made us late. I'm selling the evil thing
  tomorrow and putting my brougham back into service. That is if there are any
  decent coach horses left alive. I have a dinner appointment at the Marie
  Antoinette, I haven't time to go hunting for Laroux. Will you take this
  landscape and give it to him in the morning?" She jerked her skeleton hand at
  the package on the seat.</p>

  <p>"Gladly." Duane reached for it. "What shall I tell him?"</p>

  <p>"To send me a check for it and not rob me too much."</p>

  <p>"But who...?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind who. He knows who owns Corot's 'Pastorale au Thiers'." P-A-T
  again! "Thank you. Good-bye." There was another word, breathed so low Duane
  was not quite sure he heard it. "Good luck!" And then, high-pitched and
  peremptory again: "Hurry, Pat. The <i>Médoc</i> is too warm already, I'm
  afraid."</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">THE limousine whispered away. Ford Duane was hesitant for a
moment, the
  wrapped canvas under his arm. He looked up the block at Laroux's art store,
  as if debating whether to rout him out. He shrugged, shambled, without haste,
  across the sidewalk into his own shop. He locked the door, left the lights
  on. Went wearily between the high, gray stacks to the curtained-off backroom
  that was his living quarters and put the package on a table. From outside
  half of it was visible, half was hidden by the tied-back drapes behind which
  Duane slouched.</p>

  <p>He whirled, as the portière hid him, went down on his knees. A keen-bladed
  knife in his hand pried open the end of the flat package that was concealed
  from out front. Wary that his operations should not move the wrappings, he
  slid out an unframed canvas, stood up. Any one peering from outside would
  have been very sure the bundle with which he had been entrusted was
  untouched.</p>

  <p>The picture glowed in the drab light. An ungainly peasant guided a plow
  through a wheat-field whose every blade was distinct, detailed, as though the
  master had spent an hour in limning it. Scattered clouds were fleecy, soft in
  a sun-bright sky.</p>

  <p>Duane's lips set in a thin, grim line. He turns again, faces a
  book-shelved wall. He reaches out, touches a volume, another, a third. The wall
  moves suddenly on well-oiled hinges, swings back again. There is no one, any
  longer, in the cubicle with its rumpled camp cot, its gas burner on an
  up-ended stove, and its hacked table.</p>

  <p>In a cramped, windowless cubicle behind that shelved wall Ford Duane
  clicks on a glaring bulb. He puts the canvas on a narrow ledge jutting from
  an inner wall. He takes down a bottle from a shelf, wets with its limpid,
  colorless contents a wad of absorbent cotton. Brushes the soaked fibres
  across the picture.</p>

  <p>A pungent aroma taints the air. In the pictured wheat-field some of the
  interlaced stalks change color. They make letters, running across the
  landscape. Faint breath hissed from between Duane's teeth. His eyes blaze
  suddenly, and as suddenly are veiled.</p>

  <p>"Williamsbridge Road," he mutters. "At nine. It will take me an
  hour&mdash;They <i>were</i> delayed!"</p>

  <p>The volatile compound to which the pastoral had given up its message
  evaporates. The picture is only a picture again. It is back in its wrappings,
  that all this time have not moved, and the opening through which it was slid
  has been repaired. The lights go out in Duane's Bookshop. No one has been
  seen to go out. But there is no movement in the darkened store. No hint of
  any presence.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">WILLIAMSBRIDGE Road runs through the Borough of the Bronx
of the City of
  New York, but its upper reaches are still largely rural. A weathered old
  house sat far back from the flagstoned sidewalk to which its unkempt lawn
  sloped and even had its windows not been closely shuttered there were no
  neighbors to spy on the curious proceedings within it.</p>

  <p>"Jane!" A squat, thick-set man with a leonine mane of white hair stopped
  pacing, suddenly, in a large room inside that house, lit only by a desk lamp
  near which a girl sat. "What time is it?"</p>

  <p>"Half-past eight, Professor." Jane Adams looked up. "They aren't due here
  till nine." Her tan laboratory cloak did not altogether hide the lissome
  suppleness of her figure. "We shall just have to wait." Tawny lights glinted
  in her russet hair. The small oval of her face was lined with fatigue and
  there were faint blue shadows under her gray eyes.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Kurt Rodney's long, sculptor's fingers plucked nervously at the
  frayed hem of his stained jacket. "I have waited twenty years. Waited and
  worked, since the night I stood on a London Street and stared at the bits of
  scattered flesh and bloody bone that an instant before had been a happy
  family, mother and father and golden-haired child, strolling the war-darkened
  pavement. But now that only thirty minutes remain, I can wait no longer!"</p>

  <p>"You must be patient."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why it is that this fever possesses me now," the old man ran
  on. "A fever of dread. Of fear. <i>Fear!</i> Till you came to my laboratory
  at the University and persuaded me to take myself and my apparatus into
  hiding I did not know what that word meant. There was only my spectroscopes,
  and my dynamometers, and the joy of discovering hitherto unknown forces. You
  made me ask for Sabbatical leave. You made me board the Around-the-World
  liner and then sneak ashore again in disguise. You made me come here to this
  benighted hide-away and remain here a prisoner&mdash;for six months."</p>

  <p>"For your sake&mdash;and for our country's sake, Professor." There was
  compassion in Jane's tone, and firmness. "If the secret of what you were
  doing, have done, were to be learned by America's enemies...?"</p>

  <p>"They would use it against her and my work would be in vain," Rodney broke
  in. "Yes. I know. That was why I consented. Excuse me, Jane. I am a silly old
  man." An endearing smile of apology seemed to light up the craggy, seamed
  countenance.</p>

  <p>"You are a very great scientist, and a greater humanitarian. You have
  saved our cities, their teeming millions, from the nightmare horrors of the
  inevitable Next War. When the Army officers see what you have devised, when
  you demonstrate it to them..."</p>

  <p>"Jane! Suppose something is wrong! Suppose it doesn't work. They will
  laugh at me..."</p>

  <p>"It will work. A hundred times it has worked. There's no reason
  why..."</p>

  <p>"Let's try it again. We have time. We must make sure."</p>

  <p>"Very well." The girl lifted, wearily, moved to a wall. A click and the
  chamber was flooded with light.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">A HUGE cage centered the room, a cage of mosquito
screening. Its floor was
  covered by a miniature hamlet, tiny houses row on row along inch-wide
  streets. Surrounding the toy village, green-painted paper-maché simulated
  rolling country. Studding the line where town and country met were a number
  of small metal contrivances, curiously intricate. They might be models of
  field guns, except that the wee barrels were mounted on boxes out of whose
  surfaces quarter-inch glass lenses glittered. Threadlike, insulated wires
  connected these, coiled out through the wire meshes to a rheostat on a nearby
  cluttered table that in turn was joined to a wall-plug by a metal-covered
  cable.</p>

  <p>On one wall of the cage, just beneath its roof, a row of inch-square cages
  of the same wire netting were fastened. Within each one a common house-fly
  preened itself, and each tiny cage was provided with a small door that could
  be opened from outside to make its occupant free in the larger chamber.</p>

  <p>Rodney peered down into the cage. "Nonsensical, this display," he growled.
  "Unscientific."</p>

  <p>"But practical. The men who are coming here will be more impressed by it
  than by all your careful graphs and charts." Jane gestured to the black face
  of a closed safe recessed into the further wall. "They are practical men, not
  theorists."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps! Let us start!"</p>

  <p>The girl moved the rheostat handle, from switch-point to switch-point.
  Stopped it half-way of its arc. A vague, humming sound was perceptible. That
  was all, but it seemed to fill the room with tenseness, with a
  spine-prickling excitement. Professor Rodney's gray face grew paler, his lips
  colorless.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "Go ahead."</p>

  <p>Jane stepped to the cage, lifted one of the small doors. The fly inside
  stopped preening itself. The girl tapped a sharp finger against the wire and
  the insect took wing.</p>

  <p>It circled momentarily, darted over Toytown. Darted <i>towards</i>
  Toytown. The tiny gun-tubes came alive, jerked upward, spat minuscule, shiny
  pellets. The almost microscopic projectiles struck the fly, fell with it to
  the cage floor.</p>

  <p>"Perfect," Rodney exclaimed. "If that had been an enemy airplane, or a
  fleet of them, raiding the city by day or night, the infra-red rays would
  have aimed and shot the rifles at them, and destroyed them with the same
  efficiency. No matter how high they flew, no matter how silently. Our cities
  are safe from poison gas, from bombs. The same devices on our own planes,
  battleships, tanks, will make their marksmanship perfect. I have made America
  invincible."</p>

  <p>"Invincible! And have insured peace." There was elation in the girl's
  face, overpowering joy. "Professor Rodney! You...!"</p>

  <p>A knock at the outside door checked her. It came again. There was a pause.
  Then the double rap was repeated.</p>

  <p>"They're here," the scientist gasped.</p>

  <p>"At last!"</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">JANE ADAMS almost ran out of the room, into the small foyer
that separated
  it from the entrance. In moments she was back, behind her two tall,
  military-appearing men whose hat-brims were pulled low over their brows,
  whose coat collars were turned up to screen their faces.</p>

  <p>The newcomers looked curiously at the astonishing contrivance in the
  center of the room. Then one turned.</p>

  <p>"Professor Rodney?" His voice was hoarse, guttural.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I am Kurt Rodney. And you are...?"</p>

  <p>"Generals Sloane and Johnson of the United States Army. You have some
  device here you wish to sell to the War Department."</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? We were ordered here to..."</p>

  <p>"Not to sell. To give to the nation. Gentlemen! As you know, there is no
  question that any future declaration of war will at once be accompanied by
  air raids on civilian centers of population."</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt of that. The next war will be directed against the
  non-belligerent populations of the adversary countries. It will be a
  holocaust..."</p>

  <p>"It will not. I have destroyed that fear for the United States for once
  and always."</p>

  <p>"Interesting&mdash;if true."</p>

  <p>The physicist's face darkened with anger. "You doubt me? Here is the
  proof." He thumped the huge cage. "Here." The disturbed flies buzzed.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Rodney thrust a hand inside the breast-opening of his jacket,
  struck his familiar lecture posture. "My device is based on the principle of
  the photoelectric cell that is used in industry to open doors, stop and start
  machinery, inspect and throw out imperfect products, and so on. You are
  familiar with it. Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But I utilize the invisible infra-red rays, which have a penetrative
  power far beyond that of visible light. Searching the sky with these, despite
  darkness or fog, my invention can..."</p>

  <p>"Professor!" the girl broke in. "Just a minute." She was at the
  safe-door, had been manipulating its silvery dial, but had not opened it. Her hand
  remained on its knob.</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;what is it, Jane? Why do you interrupt me?"</p>

  <p>"You've forgotten to ask these gentlemen for their credentials. After all,
  we have only their word for their identity."</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">GENERAL JOHNSON laughed, humorlessly. "Of course. Here they
are." He
  brought a leather folder out of his pocket, flipped it open. Rodney peered
  near-sightedly at it. The seal of the United States was embossed across its
  lines of printing and writing, across a pasted photograph of the man who held
  it.</p>

  <p>"This seems to be correct, Jane." He muttered. "I have no doubt this
  gentleman is whom he represents himself to be."</p>

  <p>"General Johnson!" The girl seemed not yet to be satisfied. "How high does
  an eagle fly?"</p>

  <p>"How high...?" The man stopped. A sudden, brittle silence shut down. Then
  there was a gun in his hand, shouting at the girl. "You are too smart for
  your own good, young lady." The other man's automatic, too, was out, was
  covering the professor. "You caught me with that password question but that
  will not prevent us from getting what we came for."</p>

  <p>Jane twirled the safe knob, stepped away from it. "I didn't catch you with
  that question. The real General Johnson would not have known the answer and
  would have said so. There isn't any answer." She smiled grimly. "What
  betrayed you is the shoes you both are wearing, but I had to make sure."</p>

  <p>"The shoes...! They're dress shoes of the United States army. Regular
  issue. We were careful about that as about everything else."</p>

  <p>"Too careful. Generals in the American army purchase their own shoes. They
  are the same as any civilian's. Yours..."</p>

  <p>"You're an ass, Gorslum." The putative General Sloane, silent till now,
  darted a vicious glare at his comrade. "But we're wasting time. The plans are
  in that safe. Open it, girl."</p>

  <p>The corners of Jane's mouth twitched. "And if I don't?"</p>

  <p>"You will." There was no suavity in his accents, only a hissing threat the
  more horrible because of its low tone. "We have ways of making you and they
  are not&mdash;pleasant."</p>

  <p>"Very well." The girl shrugged. She turned, manipulated the combination
  dial. The painted steel swung open&mdash;and a mass of charred, smoldering
  ashes spilled out. "If you can make anything out of these you're good," Jane
  chuckled. "That last flip I gave the knob detonated a little bomb in here
  that I set for action while Professor Rodney was starting his lecture."</p>

  <p>"You witch!" Gorslum exclaimed. He sprang forward, slammed the side of his
  gun against the girl's cheek, gashing it. "You she-devil...!"</p>

  <p>The blow jolted the girl backward, against the table on which the rheostat
  rested. Her elbow struck the rheostat-handle, jammed it against the terminal
  marked, "<small>HIGH</small>." Sparks coruscated from the miniature
  field-guns within the
  cage and the little boxes glowed cherry-red, white. Melted down into
  shapeless lumps.</p>

  <p>"And that finishes the last trace of Kurt Rodney's secret," Jane Adams
  gritted, through teeth clamped on the pain of her wound. "He knows now why I
  insisted on supplying the rig-up with far more current than it could safely
  take."</p>

  <p>"Jane," the old man groaned. "Jane. You are wiser than I. Far
  wiser..."</p>

  <p>"Destroyed the secret, eh!" Gorslum was white-faced with wrath, but his
  thick mouth was tight and very cruel. <i>"Has</i> she destroyed the secret,
  Trano?"</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">THE other man licked dry lips with a pink tongue. "She has
not. It still
  lives&mdash;in its creator's brain." And then the two men moved, quickly,
  purposefully, as though at an unspoken signal. When they were through both
  the Americans were in chairs, lashed and helpless. "He will tell us, and be
  glad to tell us," Trano continued, as though nothing had intervened, "all
  about it before we are done with him."</p>

  <p>"Never." Rodney had come out of his daze. "I will die before I speak." He
  was somehow majestic, bound as he was, somehow awesome. "And my invention
  will die with me."</p>

  <p>The sound Trano made might have been intended for a laugh, but the girl
  shuddered at its evil implication. "You will pray for death, my dear
  professor," he lipped. "You will think death a blessing."</p>

  <p>"Stop the talk and get to work." Gorslum seemed anxious, jittery. "I don't
  want to keep that car standing out there overlong. We hid those we took it
  from well enough, but there is always the chance that they may be found and
  an alarm broadcast."</p>

  <p>"They will not be found," the other grinned, horribly. "And if they are,
  they will not talk. I changed our friends' instructions slightly. For the
  better, as you now understand. But..." He paused. "Ah! The professor has been
  good enough to provide me with just what I need."</p>

  <p>He darted to the table, snatched up an electric soldering-iron. "This
  develops a quite satisfactory degree of heat." He thumbed its switch, watched
  its swollen end grow dull black, glisten, begin to turn cherry-red. He
  turned, prowled toward Rodney, the long cord trailing behind him. "Take off
  his shoes."</p>

  <p>Gorslum knelt, fumbled at the scientist's laces. Jane watched him with
  dilated pupils, but oddly enough the expression of her eyes was not quite
  hopeless. She seemed to be listening, intently. Not to any sound in the room.
  Not to any sound that existed. Her gaze flickered away from the ominous group
  around the other chair, flitted to the shutter-blinded window...</p>

  <p>And was pulled back by a piercing scream of agony from Rodney's writhing
  mouth. By the acrid tang of burned flesh.</p>

  <p>The scream died down to a moan. "Are you ready to talk?" Gorslum
  questioned. "Or shall my friend proceed?"</p>

  <p>The professor's blue lips quivered. He was an old man, Jane thought. How
  much could he endure? Was he breaking? Already?</p>

  <p>"May you both... go to Hell!" From him, from the cloistered scientist, it
  was not a meaningless oath but a malediction and a terrible curse. <i>"To
  Hell...!"</i> And then he was screaming again, was writhing in anguish. The
  pungent smell of charred meat was nauseating...</p>

  <p>The flies were buzzing, excitedly, in their cages. They smelled carrion,
  battered their wings against the wire, avid to get at it. Nausea retched at
  the girl's stomach, thrust dizzy tentacles into her brain. The shrill sound
  of Rodney's agony beat dully against her swimming ears. It stopped. A
  guttural voice was incoherent, meaningless...</p>

  <p>It ended in a splintering crash&mdash;and a sudden silence. A silence that
  cleared Jane's vision for her, that brought her back to realization of her
  surroundings.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">THE two spies were frozen, statuesque, Gorslum holding
Rodney's bare
  ankles, Trano on his knees, the soldering-iron in his white-knuckled hand.
  The window-shutter was splintered, its aperture gaping. Someone was surging
  in through it. Someone&mdash;or <i>something!</i> The formless bulk that
  dropped lithely to the floor was a swirling mass of dark draperies, a black
  and grisly phantasm. It thudded on the wood, straightened.</p>

  <p>"God!" Gorslum gulped. "Red Finger!"</p>

  <p>The apparition was tall, draped in a long black cloak that obliterated its
  figure. A gray felt hat crowned it, and a gray mask made it faceless except
  for narrow slits behind which there was a blue, dangerous glitter. But that
  which made of it a macabre, fantastic threat was the hand that jabbed a
  revolver point-blank at the torturers. Black, that hand was, black gloved.
  Except for one finger, the finger that curled around the weapon's trigger.
  That was a glaring scarlet as if it had been dipped in fresh blood.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Red Finger!" The masked head nodded and the toneless acknowledgment
  seemed to savor the dread that name inspired among all who moved in the murky
  underworld of international intrigue. "You forgot that New York is my
  district, Gorslum and Trano. Or did you think that you could succeed where so
  many others have failed?"</p>

  <p>The only answer was a whimper from a clamped throat, a whimper of deadly
  fear. These men were brave. None but the brave enlist in the invisible war.
  But the man who stood before them was a whispered legend among their like a
  tradition of supernatural invincibility and relentless doom.</p>

  <p>"Stand up!"</p>

  <p>Gorslum dropped the professor's ankles. Trano straightened, slowly&mdash;
  exploded into lightning action that flung the heated iron he held straight at
  Red Finger's eye-slits.</p>

  <p>The glove-held gun spat orange-yellow flame. The glowing iron clanged,
  smashed, in mid-air, into a hundred pieces that clattered down. But the
  momentary diversion had given the spies time to snatch out their own
  guns.</p>

  <p>The sound of firing was continuous thunder in the room. Fiery jets laced
  the air. A lax body thudded down. Lead plucked at black cloth, sliced a
  fluttering fragment from it. A second body hung limply on the wire-mesh cage,
  sprayed a scarlet rain on Toytown.</p>

  <p>Red Finger swayed, clutched at the window-sill for support. He hung there
  for a long moment. A darker patch spread, glistening, on the dark cloth of
  his cloak, at his side. He fumbled at the fluttering drapes and his gun was
  gone.</p>

  <p>He was coming across the floor to the girl who called herself Jane Adams.
  He was <i>staggering</i> across the floor, clutching at the table, at a
  chair-back, to keep from falling. He got to her, fumbled at the knots that
  tied her.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">HE was mumbling low words to her. "I got here as quickly as
I could. The
  message was delayed."</p>

  <p>"I told you I would see you again."</p>

  <p>Her tone too, was low. But Kurt Rodney would not have heard them had they
  shouted. He had fainted. "When you sent me out of that office on Fifth Avenue
  and out of your life, I told you never to say never to a woman."</p>

  <p><i>"Flower!"</i> Recognition seemed to give him new life, to staunch his
  wound. "You! Who are you, Flower? Who...?"</p>

  <p>"Number six-one-three. Just a number, Red Finger, to the Force. But to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"A girl who has no business in the Force. Get out, Flower. Get out before
  it's too late. Before a bullet finds its billet in your soft, sweet body. Or
  worse happens to it. <i>Worse..."</i></p>

  <p>"And you, Red Finger?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I stay."</p>

  <p>"Then I stay, too. Red Finger! Are we neither of us to know life? Are
  we...?"</p>

  <p>He was gone from her. He was across the room, at the window. She tried to
  rise, but she was still held tight by the lashings he had not finished
  unfastening.</p>

  <p>"It will take you a minute to free yourself." He was out of the window.
  "Will you ever free me?" He vanished into the chilly night, without waiting
  for an answer.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">A WEEK later Ford Duane, still weak and pale from the
automobile accident
  that had sent him to a certain private and very discreet sanitarium in the
  Bronx, unlocked his bookshop. Among the litter of letters and bills that had
  been poked through the slit in this door during his absence was a russet
  rose. Impaled on its stem was a narrow slip of paper, and on that paper one
  word:</p>

  <p class="cp"><i>"Never!"</i></p>
