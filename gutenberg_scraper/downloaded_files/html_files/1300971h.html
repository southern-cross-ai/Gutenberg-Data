  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">"YOU'LL not do it," the big woman said decisively.</p>

  <p>Ethel Carne merely smiled by way of reply. And yet she had lived long
  enough in that wild North West to know that a warning like this was not to be
  disregarded. Perhaps it was the fitful spurts of sunshine which gave her
  courage. Perhaps she derived the strength and inspiration from the steely
  blue of the sky, bent like some metal dome above her head. Already along the
  fainter blue of the horizon a few pallid stars were powdered, shining dimly
  like jewels upon the neck of beauty in the dawn.</p>

  <p>"You'll not do it," the mistress of the stores repeated, with finality.
  "You'll never reach the Spurs before dark. And the snow will be up in an
  hour, happen though it does look so bright and cheerful now. Far best stay
  the night."</p>

  <p>The big woman with the kindly eyes and shrewd face was speaking no more
  than the truth, and very well in her heart of hearts knew it. They stood
  together in the doorway of the log store, looking up the sweeping mountain
  paths which led by zig-zag stages to the Spurs. It was no far cry on a
  summer's day, being a matter merely of a few miles. But when the snow came
  down and the north-easter swept across the valleys, then the swinging pine
  trees spoke of danger and told of disaster dead and gone. Away up to the left
  the dark woods lifted their shoulders high, the great massed battalions of
  the pines stood like grim sentinels watching and warning. Just for a moment
  they lay like a sombre flash against the steely blue, steadfast and
  immaculate, then a flying squadron of the coming gale beat them almost flat
  till they roared again with heads bent over against the fury of the wind. The
  cold, icy breath came down the pass, sweeping in through the open door. A
  million sparks, crimson and purple and gold, roared up the stove through the
  hot chimney.</p>

  <p>Ethel Carne set her little white teeth together. "It's very kind of you,"
  she said, in a low-pitched, modulated voice, so different from the hard,
  nasal tones of her companion. "I know you mean well; but I must get back to
  the Spurs to-night. I am quite alone. My help left me yesterday unexpectedly,
  and my little girl is alone in the house. Oh, I couldn't rest here, knowing
  that she was all by herself, and the Christmas Eve, too. Think of the
  disappointment! And then she might be frightened."</p>

  <p>The speaker touched the square parcel which she carried under her arm. She
  had been down to the Fort making her slender purchases for the festive
  season, for it is a poor heart that never rejoices, and it was one of Ethel
  Carne's boasts that so far she had lost neither her self-respect nor her
  courage.</p>

  <p>Who she was and whence she came people neither knew nor did they seem to
  care. That she was English went without saying. That she was a lady was
  patent to the meanest observer who frittered away his weekly earnings in the
  many saloons which tempted miners to forgetfulness and destruction. All that
  most people knew was that George Carne had vanished mysteriously two years
  before and that he had never been heard of since. He was by way of being a
  gentlemanly adventurer. But, then, they were all adventurers at the Spurs for
  the matter of that, where each man at any moment might "make his pile,"
  alluvial gold mining, or incidentally sweat out the last years of his life
  for a mere pittance of bread and shelter. For the most part the latter was
  the lot of the majority of them, though occasionally one or two, more
  fortunate than the rest, drifted West with their pockets full of money and
  their heads humming with the poison&mdash;miscalled whisky in that remote
  spot.</p>

  <p>There was no scandal or outcry when George Carne was seen and heard of no
  more, for it was part of the unwritten etiquette of the Spurs to ask no
  questions when some gentleman of fortune disappeared as mysteriously as he
  had arrived. Few men there were properly entitled to the names they bore, and
  biography as a pastime or relaxation was sternly frowned upon by the
  community who made up the settlement.</p>

  <p>And so long as Ethel Carne made no sign it was nothing to anybody else.
  There were other women in the settlement, and in their rough, sympathetic way
  they were not unkind to the gentle stranger, whom they recognised as one made
  of far superior clay to themselves. Gradually, and by degrees, Mrs. Carne
  drifted into the position of dressmaker to the settlement. She had good taste
  and a deft needle; also, she was the possessor of a sewing machine, which was
  an object of interest, not to say awe, to her sisterhood at the Spurs. As a
  matter of fact, Ethel Came fitted into the picture. She learnt to shift and
  do for herself. She acquired a strength and reliance which was as unexpected
  as it was pleasing. And if down in her heart she felt all the bitterness and
  grief of a woman deserted in the full floodtide of her beauty she made no
  sign. The blue eyes were as clear and serene now as they had been in the
  early days. The mouth was as sweet and tender. There was just a thin, drawn
  line between the brows and no more: for Ethel had her child, who was growing
  up in that clear mountain air as strong and erect as one of the pines which
  tossed its plumes against the everlasting snows. There were a comfortable
  home and many friends waiting for Ethel in England had she but chosen to hold
  up her little finger. But for the present she preferred to obliterate
  herself. She wanted no sympathy and no pity. Her proud soul would have
  revolted against the slightest touch on the edge of the wound which had never
  yet healed, and never would.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">"I tell you I must go," she said. "I am merely wasting the
  precious moments here, and that child all alone in the cabin... with nothing
  but the light of the stove... And presently it will be dark."</p>

  <p>She turned abruptly away, and grasped the parcel all the more firmly. She
  was not in the least tired. Her stride was free and elastic as she wended her
  way up the path towards the Spurs. It was curiously still in strange weird
  patches. At times she could actually hear the bleat of sheep and catch the
  distant voices. Then for a moment the stinging fury of the gale broke out
  again, like the headlong charge of white cavalry, and she bent her supple
  body, whilst the cold wind seemed almost to stop the beating of her heart. As
  she struggled up the path the intervals of ominous quiet became less and
  less. A thin, filmy powder came in whirling drifts across the steely blue of
  the sky. There was a sting like whip-lashes on her cheek, and behold, here
  and there as if in the twinkling of an eye snowdrifts in the road and white
  caps weighing down the soughing branches of the pines. A few more scuds like
  this and the path would be wiped out, leaving but the sombre fringe of the
  trees on either side. The danger yet was vague and intangible; but Ethel
  Carne had lived there long enough to know how real it was.</p>

  <p>And yet she was not afraid, though she knew that the mile or so would tax
  her strength to the uttermost. But she was not thinking of her child or
  herself now, she was not feeling the weight of the white scud beating freely
  upon her neck and hair. Her mind had gone back into the past. The faint,
  intangible spirit of Christmas was upon her. It was just about this time two
  years ago that George Carne had gone off hotfoot and at a moment's notice,
  westward. He had left a note to say that he had been called away imperiously,
  and that there was no time to be lost. He had hinted vaguely of some good
  fortune looming in the distance which he would keep to discuss with Ethel
  when they met again.</p>

  <p>And from that day to this there had come no sign. It had been very good of
  Raymond Raife to stand by Ethel as he had done, for he had been George's
  chum, who refused to believe anything but the best of his old partner. And
  then, almost unexpectedly, Raife himself had been summoned home, and from
  that moment it seemed to Ethel that she was absolutely alone in the
  world.</p>

  <p>She never stopped to analyse her feelings. She had not dared to ask
  herself whether her prevailing emotion was one of contempt or despair.
  Commonsense told me that she had been deserted, and she was content to let it
  go at that. But she had made no sign. She had known how to take her
  punishment.</p>

  <p>But now everything seemed to be different. Now she caught herself
  wondering for the first time if Raife had not been right. Raymond Raife had
  never told her in as many words that he cared for her. A woman's instinct had
  filled her with that consciousness. But that was a matter that would not bear
  analysis.</p>

  <p>She struggled on and on against the increasing fury of the gale, white and
  battered from head to foot now, breathing slowly and painfully, with a prayer
  on her lips that she might win through and reach the little log cabin at
  last. She thought of its warmth and comfort. She thought of the clear glow of
  the wood stove, of fragrant coffee and hot cakes, of all the pleasant things
  that make the chill blast of the open air a comfort and a consolation. She
  thought, too, of the child waiting so patiently there with her handful of
  cheap toys and wondering how much longer mummy was going to be. Then the
  white fury of the gale came down with a snarl and a roar, and just for the
  moment the woman stood there dazed, beaten and half unconscious. She wiped
  the white stinging powder from her eyes. She beat her chilled hands to her
  breast. She staggered forward again, peering through the thickness for the
  first sight of the dull glow that would show her that home was close at hand.
  Then, just for a moment, the white, howling veil lifted, and the hoarse
  singing roar of the pines ceased. High on the shoulder of the hill a tiny red
  glow shone out; the core of the flame seemed to find its way straight to
  Ethel's heart and warm her as some generous spirit might have done. There was
  a fresh strength in her limbs now, for she knew that she had won through and
  that the goal was reached, She staggered up the narrow path leading to the
  cottage, she fumbled for a moment with the latch then the door gave and she
  stumbled inwards. A moment later the murderous breath of the night was shut
  out, a delicious sense of warmth and drowsiness overcame her. She sat down to
  the table with her head on her hands. She was just conscious of a pair of
  soft arms about her neck.</p>

  <p>"All right, dearie," she said hysterically, "I shall be myself in a minute
  or two. Then we shall have some delicious hot coffee and cakes, and I will
  tell you all my adventures. Do you think you could get the lamp for me?"</p>

  <p>The child came back a moment or two later bearing two lamps in her hands.
  The mother looked at her interrogatively.</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten," the child said gravely. "Surely you have forgotten
  the beacon lamp which we always put out for daddy on Christmas Eve. You light
  the two, mummy."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mrs. Carne whispered, "I'll light the two."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">The beacon light stood in the little window with the curtain
  half drawn. The soft hiss of the snow drifted against the panes, and Ethel
  smiled at her little one's suggestion. After all said and done, it was
  impossible that the beacon light might be of advantage to some belated
  wayfarer struggling up from the Fort, though few of the miners would risk the
  white peril to-night. The stove gave out a cheerful heat. The coffee and
  cakes were things of the past, and already Ethel was busy decorating the
  walls of the little sitting-room with such evergreens as she had gathered the
  day before. She was quite herself again now. There was a deep, abiding
  thankfulness in the knowledge that she was safe at home and that all danger
  had been left behind. The brown-paper parcel had been hidden judiciously away
  with a promise that its many wonders would be displayed on the morrow. It was
  getting late now and the mists were beginning to dance in little Ethel's blue
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Just a little longer," she pleaded at the mother's suggestion of bed. "It
  isn't Christmas Eve every night, and, really, I am not a bit tired. I want to
  wake up in the morning and help you."</p>

  <p>Ethel Carne yielded weakly enough. She felt a strange desire for human
  companionship to-night. She knew how recently she had been face to face with
  death and she could not forget it.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said. "But you mustn't dance about any longer. Come and
  sit on my knee and let me tell you a story." The child came obediently
  enough:</p>

  <p>"Please," she asked. "But let it be a real story&mdash;one of the things
  that used to happen to you when you were a girl at home in England. I like
  those stories better than the book stories."</p>

  <p>And so it came about a few moments later that Ethel Carne in the spirit
  was wandering about English meadows, under the shade of cool trees, and
  picking primroses by the brookside. The story came to an end at length, and
  with it a sound from without as if someone were knocking feebly at the door.
  Just for a moment it occurred to Ethel that her imagination was playing
  tricks with her, then came that uncertain sound again, as if some exhausted
  animal were scratching for admittance. Ethel put the child off her knee and
  drew back the latch. There was a burst of murderous cold air, a rushing whirl
  of snowflakes, which came hissing and spitting as far as the stove, then a
  form half rose from the doorstep and staggered into the room. It all happened
  so quickly, so dramatically, that for a moment Ethel could only stand there,
  the air cutting like knives across her face, her hair dishevelled in the
  wind. Then it was borne in upon her that the place was getting icy cold and
  that the figure of a man lay there on the floor chilled, unconscious, it even
  might be, exhausted to the verge of death. It was a fight to close the door,
  to shoot back the bolts into their places, and draw the heavy portiere of
  bearskin across the panes. The child stood there open-mouthed and waiting,
  but yet not alarmed, for accidents were frequent in the hard life of the
  Spurs, and it was not the first time that Ethel had looked death in the
  face.</p>

  <p>"Get me the brandy bottle, dearie," Ethel murmured, as she raised the
  man's head from the floor. She chafed his cold hands vigorously. She dragged
  him nearer to the stove by sheer personal strength, so that the grateful
  warmth might thaw the cuirass of snow which had frozen on his breast like
  armour. She managed at length to coax a few drops of spirit down the man's
  throat. He shuddered convulsively, and his eyes opened. Then he glanced round
  the room, not vaguely nor confusedly, but with the air of one who had been
  there before.</p>

  <p>"Ethel," he whispered, "that was a close call."</p>

  <p>The woman recognised him. She had recognised him almost before his grey
  eyes were turned to the light. She seemed to take it as coolly and
  collectedly as possible. Now that he was once back again it seemed the most
  natural thing in the world. There was no wild fluttering at her heart, no
  overwhelming joy, no contempt, regret, or any other gamut of emotions which
  ought, by all the rules of the game to have gripped her at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she murmured, mechanically, "How was it?"</p>

  <p>The man had risen to his feet by now. Every passing instant seemed to add
  to his stature and his manhood. The glow crept back to his cheeks now. His
  eyes were clear and bright. He stripped off his furs and stood before the
  stove, the picture and embodiment of perfect humanity. He did not seem to see
  that the child was dancing about his knees now that she had recognised him,
  and that she was calling him by name. Without knowing it he lifted her in his
  strong arms and kissed her tenderly.</p>

  <p>"I always knew you would come back," she said.</p>

  <p>"Of course, dear," he said gravely. "I never meant to do anything else,
  only I have been a little longer than I expected. And now, don't you think
  you had better go to bed. I have much to say to mother, and to-morrow I shall
  show you all the presents I have brought you. Oh, I have heaps and heaps of
  presents for both, only I had to hide them by the wayside or else I should
  never have got here at all. Put the child to bed, Ethel. As for me, I daresay
  I shall know where to find something to eat. I feel as if I hadn't had a meal
  for years."</p>

  <p>The man spoke cheerfully and naturally enough, and yet there was a certain
  constraint in his manner which Ethel did not fail to notice. Her lip curled
  somewhat contemptuously, but she obeyed the suggestion without demur. And
  then, when once the child was between the blankets, a certain demure shyness
  came upon her and it was a long time before she had the courage to return to
  the sitting-room. George Carne was seated by the stove, his head in his
  hands, evidently deeply immersed in thought.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit down," he said. "We have a good deal to say to one another.
  There is so much to explain. And yet I don't think you would blame me if you
  knew everything."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," Ethel said mechanically.</p>

  <p>"No, we had better go back for a bit. You will remember the day I went
  away. You were away from home for the time, and I had not a moment to spare.
  It was Raymond Raife who brought me the news&mdash;- a cablegram from home,
  saying my father was dying and desired to see me without delay. I can never
  understand&mdash;in fact, I shall never understand&mdash;my father's bitter
  opposition to our marriage. I suppose we were both too proud to ask for
  explanations, and that is the real reason why we drifted apart. But when
  Raife brought me that cablegram I began to see hope ahead. It seemed to me
  that I was going to be taken back into favour again, for my father would
  hardly have sent for me all that way if it had not been to give me his
  forgiveness on his deathbed. Then we would go back to England again and renew
  our proper position in society. I was more glad, I think, for your sake and
  the child's sake than my own. I did not hesitate a moment. I went off there
  and then. I made up my mind to say nothing to you till I could send you some
  really good news. My idea was to get matters settled in England and then come
  and fetch you two home again. I hope you won't think I am hard and callous;
  but I have never ceased to regret what I brought you to here, all the more so
  because you were always so brave and uncomplaining."</p>

  <p>Carne paused, but no reply came from Ethel.</p>

  <p>"And when I got home I found, to my surprise, that my father had been dead
  for the last year or more. He had made no sign. He had made no attempt to
  communicate with me, but, at the same time, he had made no alterations in his
  will, so that I found myself master of the whole property. They had been
  advertising for me everywhere, and it was only by pure good fortune that I
  discovered the truth. But the strange part of the whole thing was
  this:&mdash;I could find nobody ready to admit the dispatch of that
  cablegram. I was too busy to write to you. I was saving it all up for a glad
  surprise later on. I never dreamt for a moment that anything was wrong. I
  never dreamed that I was the victim of a false friend who had played the vile
  conspiracy on me. How should I know that the cablegram had been deliberately
  concocted by Raymond Raife to get me out of the way! How could I guess
  it?"</p>

  <p>A sudden, leaping crimson flamed into Ethel Carne's face. In an
  illuminating flash she saw the true inwardness of many things now. Burning
  letters of flame scorched on the arch of memory which had been so many
  trivial words in the twilight of innocent misunderstanding. For the first
  time Ethel saw.</p>

  <p>"Is this true?" she stammered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's true enough. I was to be got out of the way and it was to be
  inferred to you that this action on my part was nothing else than a
  cold-blooded desertion. But Raymond Raife found you impervious. He recognised
  the hopelessness of his ambitions and he came back to England to find me. As
  a matter of fact I found him lying in a hospital with a broken spine, and on
  his deathbed he told me everything.... Well, I forgave him everything, for I
  could do no less. Still, I grudged the wasted years... Ethel, surely there is
  no occasion for me to say any more. You believe me?"</p>

  <p>The woman rose tremblingly from her seat beside the stove. Then she
  crossed the floor, and her arms went like two white wreaths round her
  husband's neck. She wanted no more. She was content to know. And in that
  instant it seemed to her that she had never doubted George Carne's return.
  For a long time there was silence between them, a blissful silence filled
  with a pleasing spirit of the happy Christmastide. Neither wanted more than
  that.</p>

  <p>"My word, it was hard work to get here," Carne said more cheerfully, as he
  stretched his long arms out to the blaze. "They warned me down at the Fort
  that I couldn't do it. But I laughed at them and pushed on my way. I would
  have come to-night if all the powers of darkness had barred my path. But I
  don't mind confessing that I was beaten more than once. In the ordinary way I
  should never have managed it. And I struggled on and on, dazed and
  half-blinded by the snow, until at last the beacon light shone out clear and
  bright, like a guiding star to beckon me on. I tell you it was like new
  blood&mdash;like sparkling champagne in my veins. And yet even then it was a
  close call. But for that light and the grace of God I should be lying out in
  the snow now stark and stiff."</p>

  <p>Ethel Carne colours guiltily.</p>

  <p>"Let me make a confession," she said, in a whisper, her head close down to
  her husband's shoulder. "I had forgotten all about it. For two years I have
  been growing more and more callous and forgetful. For two years I have been
  steadily losing the hope which I tried to stifle. It was little Ethel who
  brought me the lamp, little Ethel who reminded me that I always lighted it on
  Christmas Eve. And now, if you can only forgive me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forgive you what?" Carne asked. "My word! if you can take me back to your
  heart again like this it is little I have to complain of. But, all the same,
  it is going to be a really happy Christmas for us three, sweetheart."</p><br>

  <p class="first">TOM MACEY glanced across the room at his wife from under his
  thick eyebrows as if he were ashamed of something. He was not usually given
  to the things that men regret, and just at that moment his thoughts were none
  the less bitter because he really had done nothing to be ashamed of. And now
  he was actually hesitating at the very time when he ought not to have given
  the matter a single thought. He would have condemned this hesitation in any
  other man, and yet, and yet, and yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>First of all, there was the child to be thought of. She was the only
  one&mdash;a little girl of some four years of age, and the apple of Tom
  Macey's eye. She ought to have been strong and healthy enough, seeing that
  both Macey and his wife were made of the stern stuff which has laid the
  foundation of the British Empire. They were willing and ready enough to share
  privations together, and they had done so more than once before now. But
  somehow the child was different. Most of the youngsters thrive in the keen,
  dry air there beneath the snows of the Colorado Rockies, but somehow or
  another it was not the same with little Vera. And the only doctor for a
  hundred miles around had told Macey that if his daughter was not taken away
  to a milder climate she would die.</p>

  <p>It was easy enough to say this, but how was the matter to be brought
  about? Macey had been mining away up there in One Tree Gulch for the last two
  years with the most execrable luck. He had all the sanguine temperament which
  goes to the gold prospector. He was holding on desperately with a feeling
  that his turn would come at last. The man was not without imagination; he was
  more impressed by local traditions and Indian legends than he would have
  cared to admit. He had studied these until he knew them by heart. There were
  stories to the effect that here and there, on rare occasions in the past,
  diamonds had been found in some of the canyons away under the spurs of those
  everlasting hills. Certainly Macey had found here and there a deposit of blue
  earth which suggested the presence of the most rare of all precious stones.
  And then his luck had changed, and he found them.</p>

  <p>And they were only three, but they were diamonds right enough; Macey knew
  that, for back in the years of his youth he had spent some time in the
  Transvaal, and he knew a diamond when he saw it. He found no more; he had not
  expected any farther dazzling luck like this; but he was well satisfied, for
  here, if he sold his stones to the best advantage, was a matter of twenty
  thousand pounds. It was not a large fortune, but, at any rate, it was big
  enough to ensure luxury and comfort in the future&mdash;big enough to enable
  Macey and his wife to get away farther South and save the life of the child.
  All these things Macey had talked over with Nell in the evenings. Their plans
  were fairly forward now. And then the doctor had stepped in with a peremptory
  command that the child was not to be moved until the weather got warmer.</p>

  <p>Macey heard the news in his tranquil, emotionless way, but it hurt him all
  the same. He knew perfectly well what the doctor meant. It was going to be a
  close call with the little one. If they could tide over the next two or three
  weeks the balmy breath of spring would be here and the terrible danger might
  be averted. The doctor might come along at any time now and utter his final
  verdict.</p>

  <p>But this was not the only trouble. Goodness knows how, but the rumour got
  abroad that Tom Macey had found some diamonds and that they were hidden in
  his hut. The arm of the law in those parts was fitful and feeble enough, and
  more than once during the past two days Macey had had a warning as to the
  danger of keeping those valuables in a log hut amongst the snows miles away
  from the nearest habitation. There were three lawless scamps hanging about
  the neighbourhood, and up to a certain point Macey had said nothing of this
  to his wife. But returning home that night in the dusk a revolver bullet had
  pierced a hole in Macey's fur cap, and he knew now that the time had come
  when he must either run or fight.</p>

  <p>In the ordinary way he would not have hesitated for a moment. There was
  nothing of the coward about him, but he was a married man, and he knew well
  enough when discretion was the better part of valour. Here he was tied by the
  leg by a cruel fate; here he was waiting for the doctor's last words, and his
  life in danger all the time. He might have compromised matters; he might have
  allowed himself to be robbed; but the mere thought of that sent the blood
  boiling through his veins and brought his teeth together.</p>

  <p>He sat there thinking the matter out. He had told his wife. It was almost
  impossible to keep anything from her, and, despite all Macey's assumption of
  cheerfulness, Nell had seen at once that something was radically wrong.</p>

  <p>"And now you know all about it, little girl," Macey said. "It is very
  hard. I can't understand how those chaps got to know."</p>

  <p>"You haven't told me who they are," Mrs. Macey said.</p>

  <p>"Haven't I? I think you can guess. There's Dick Blake and Ned Carson and
  Long Jim. If you searched the whole of the American Continent you couldn't
  find three greater scoundrels than these. And, you see, they have got nothing
  to be afraid of. There's no law here. Why, those three scoundrels might raid
  this hut any time, and murder the lot of us. And they would, too, if they
  weren't just a little bit afraid of my revolver. It isn't for myself that I
  mind; it's you and the kiddie. Of course, I might go down to Dolvertown and
  lodge the stones there. I could get there in a couple of days; but, then,
  suppose the doctor comes when I am away; suppose he wants something in a
  hurry. You can't do it. I tell you when I think of it my blood fairly boils.
  If we could only get away and sell those stones we should have plenty of
  money in future. We could take the child with us away down South, where she
  could grow well and strong again. You see what a dilemma I am in now. If I go
  now, and there is no man about when the doctor comes, little Vera may die. If
  I stay here we may be murdered in our beds by those three ruffians. It is
  maddening to think that health and prosperity are so near and yet so far
  away. I have thought and thought till my head aches. And, so far as I can
  see, there is only one thing to do, and that is to grin and bear it."</p>

  <p>"If you were to hide the stones," Nell suggested.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, what is the good of that? It wouldn't prevent those skunks
  from shooting me on sight, or you either, for the matter of that."</p>

  <p>Macey sank into sullen silence. As his wife watched him anxiously a
  brilliant idea came to her.</p>

  <p>"Tom," she cried, "why shouldn't I go? What is to prevent me from slipping
  away and getting as far as Dolvertown? I know the road well enough; it is
  only a matter of some twenty miles, and I could walk it between now and
  to-morrow evening. You know how strong and hearty I am; you know that nothing
  hurts me, and there is not enough snow to constitute danger. Give me the
  stones. Let me hide them. I suppose those three ruffians are watching the
  house all the time, and if they see you here in the morning they will
  naturally conclude that I am in the hut too. Now, don't say 'No,' Tom. Why, I
  have gone farther than this before now to help a neighbour in trouble, and
  you haven't been in the least anxious about me. Do let me go."</p>

  <p>Macey shook his head resolutely. He would not hear a word of such a mad
  project. Besides, it seemed such a cowardly thing to send his wife away upon
  an errand which he could not or dare not undertake himself. He would have run
  the risk of a journey to Dolvertown and back, but when he thought of the
  child lying there restless and uneasy with the fever upon her, his heart
  turned to water within him and all his manliness vanished, leaving him
  trembling and nervous. And yet he could not find it in his mind to purchase
  life and peace of mind by the sacrifice of those stones for which he had
  toiled so hard and long.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," he said. "Besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no other way," Nell went on, breathlessly. "Think what it all
  means to us. If I am successful in my errand&mdash;and there is no reason why
  I should not be&mdash;we shall be rich, we shall be able to take Vera away,
  we shall be able to turn our backs on this hateful life for ever. And if we
  stay here we shall lose everything. What would it matter to me, what would
  anything matter, if the child were to die? And by this time to-morrow
  everything will be safe. You will be able to go about and say that you have
  banked your diamonds, and those three rascals will be powerless for further
  harm. Oh, you must let me go."</p>

  <p>Once more Macey shook his head, but he was weakening now, as Nell could
  see from the look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," he repeated, dubiously.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room and opened the door and looked out into the night. The
  air was soft and balmy; the cruel, cold breath of it had vanished before the
  oncoming of the spring. The earth smelt warm and damp. There was a subtle
  fragrance in the gently swaying pines. It looked as if no more snow was
  likely to fall. It looked as if the journey to Dolvertown would be safe
  enough, if only those three lurking demons were in bed and asleep. Beyond a
  doubt, if they had seen Nell Macey leave the hut, they would follow her,
  guessing easily enough what her errand was.</p>

  <p>But there was no sign outside, nothing but the breath of the wind
  whispering to the pines that spring was at hand; nothing but the smell of the
  good red earth still crisp and firm under its thin powder of snow. And Nell
  was a good walker, too; she could hold her own in a long day's hunting and
  fishing; she would make light of a tramp as far as Dolvertown.</p>

  <p>"You are going to let me go?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"God forgive me if anything happens to you," Macey said, under his breath.
  "I suppose it is all for the best. You ought to reach the new camp at Byson
  River by eleven o'clock to-morrow morning, and when you get there try and
  find Patrick Walsh. I know he is down there somewhere, and you can trust him,
  too. I met him once some three years ago, and I was in a position to do him a
  bit of a favour. If you do get into any sort of trouble there is no one man
  on the American Continent who can help you as Patrick Walsh can. But you know
  what he is like."</p>

  <p>Nell nodded eagerly. Everybody on the Continent, from the Rockies right
  down to the Pacific Slope, had heard of Patrick Walsh. He was by way of being
  an adventurer, a miner, a prospector, anything where danger lay and trouble
  was to be found first hand. There were spots on the map of America, now
  prosperous towns, which Walsh had actually founded. With all his courage and
  resource, with all his infinite talents, he had remained a poor man, a
  typical instance of the rolling stone that gathers no moss.</p>

  <p>But his reputation was clean enough. He was a terror to evildoers; there
  was not a bully or bravado in half-a-dozen States who would have dared to
  stand up to Pat Walsh single-handed. More than one unspeakable outcast and
  cold-blooded murderer had been tracked down by Walsh for the pure joy of the
  thing. He had broken up gangs with the aid of nothing but his own revolver,
  and with it all he was a quiet, civil-spoken little man, looking the very
  last person in the world to hold a reputation such as his. If Nell Macey
  could find a friend like this, then she was safe indeed.</p>

  <p>The stars were shining overhead in great glittering clusters behind the
  belt of pines as she set out upon her journey. Here and there she could dimly
  make out the snow lying in white battalions above the murmuring belts of
  trees. Here and there was a stirring in the undergrowth, and something like
  fear filled her heart when she thought of her child and her husband. But she
  went on steadily forward through the dim blackness of the night, until at
  length the east began to grow faintly purple, then pink, then burning
  saffron, as the sun climbed over the shoulders of the great snow-clad peaks
  and cast long shadows across the plain.</p>

  <p>It was nearly nine o'clock before Nell came, footsore and weary, to a
  little mining camp by the Byson River. A handful of little huts were dotted
  on the hillside. Some adventurous trader had set up a saloon; here was the
  inevitable 'store' from which the necessities of life could be derived. It
  was getting warmer now&mdash;so warm, indeed, that one or two of the miners
  were sitting outside the house breakfasting in the open. The pine-laden air
  reeked with the smell of frying bacon. They were not a nice-looking lot of
  men, not at all the class that Nell had been accustomed to, for they were
  beyond the borders of civilization here, and the sort of individuals who came
  and went for the most part bore names which would have conveyed nothing to
  their parents before them. It was not the sort of camp where it was safe to
  inquire too closely into the antecedents of one's next-door neighbour. The
  few men gathered there eyed Nell with languid and slightly insolent
  curiosity. She would have moved on, but she was not more than half-way on her
  journey yet, and she knew the necessity of rest and food before she proceeded
  farther.</p>

  <p>It was no nice thing to have to push her way into the store to procure
  bread and biscuits and tinned meat, but it had to be done, and then she sat
  down by the wayside to eat. One or two of the miners gathered round her,
  staring at her in a long, cool deliberation, which brought the blood flaming
  to her cheeks. One, more hardy than the rest, ventured to address her in
  words which brought the blood to her temples again and caused the angry tears
  to rise to her eyes. She was looking round for something in the semblance of
  manhood who might drive these hideous wretches away and give her the
  seclusion which she so much desired. Then out of the saloon opposite came a
  slight, fair man, dressed in a somewhat superior manner to the rest, who took
  off his hat politely and asked in quite a small voice if he could be of any
  assistance. A chorus of raucous laughter greeted this unwonted courtesy. In
  spite of her anger and alarm Nell smiled. It was much as if some boy had
  chosen to defy all the weight and force of authority.</p>

  <p>"You are vastly kind," Nell said. "I am on my way to Dolvertown. I suppose
  those men mean nothing offensive, but if you could persuade them to go away I
  should be obliged to you."</p>

    <img src="1300971h-images/TreasuresThree1.jpg"
         title="Three horsemen came at a trot into the camp.">
  </div><br>

  <p>By way of reply the fair little man took a seat by her side. What he might
  have said Nell had no opportunity of judging, for at that moment there came
  the sound of hoofs beating on the hard road, and three horsemen came at a
  trot into the camp. At the sight of the foremost Nell's face turned ashy
  grey. She gave a little cry of dismay which was not lost upon her
  companion.</p>

  <p>"You are frightened," he murmured, softly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Nell said, hoarsely. "Those men are following me. I hoped that
  I had escaped them; I hoped that they had not guessed why I am on my way to
  Dolvertown. You see, I have valuables in my possession&mdash;diamonds."</p>

  <p>The words slipped from Nell's lips unconsciously. It was madness, perhaps,
  to trust this stranger, but for the life of her she could not help it. And
  what avail would he be against the grinning trio who had already dismounted
  from their horses and stood regarding her with an evil smirk upon three of
  the most infamous countenances that the Continent of America might
  produce?</p>

  <p>"I know," the slim stranger murmured. "You are Tom Macey's wife. Do you
  know, you are the pluckiest woman I have ever come across. So you are going
  to Dolvertown with those stones, are you? I guess a courageous action like
  yours is worth better luck than this. If I were alone I should know what to
  do. As it is&mdash;well, I'll try my best. Now, then!"</p>

  <p>The last two words were flung contemptuously in the direction of the three
  horsemen. They came with a rasping sound from the stranger's lips. They were
  hard and clear and defiant, and so full of a certain concrete courage that
  Nell, despite her alarm, turned to her companion with a glance of
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>The foremost horseman came forward; his long, muscular form seemed to
  tower above the two sitting on the pine-logs there. There was not much to
  choose between those associates, but Nell knew from common report that, if
  one was worse than the others, it was the same Long Jim who was now
  addressing the man by her side.</p>

  <p>"Stranger," he said, with a sneering drawl, "I guess you'll find this
  atmosphere isn't conducive to the health of a little man like you. Now you
  just run away back to mamma and tell her that Long Jim sent you.
  Otherwise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A burst of ribald laughter came from the other two. The slight, fair man
  sitting by Nell's side never so much as changed a line of his
  countenance.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you," he said. "Perhaps you will be so good as to introduce
  me to the other gentlemen. I was told I should find some choice rascality in
  this neighbourhood, and it seems to me that I am not going to be
  disappointed."</p>

  <p>"You do me proud," Long Jim grinned. "This gentleman is Dick Blake, and
  the nobleman masquerading with the black eye is Ned Carson. Perhaps you might
  have heard of us; most people have."</p>

  <p>"Your fame has travelled," the little man said, imperturbably. His eyes
  had narrowed down now to long slits that seemed to emit flashes as if flint
  and steel were struck together. "And now, perhaps, it would be just as well
  if I let you know who I happen to be. But perhaps you are not curious?"</p>

  <p>"It was always a weakness of mine," Long Jim said.</p>

  <p>"It shall be gratified. My name, sirs, is Patrick Walsh. It is just
  possible that you have heard of me!"</p>

  <p>Long Jim displayed the balance of a set of teeth in a snarling grin, like
  a dog worrying a wasp; the other two turned away as if the affair was nothing
  of theirs. It was plain that the three ruffians were taken aback by this
  unexpected announcement. It was not much on the face of the earth that this
  class of bravo feared, but the name of Patrick Walsh was one of them. For
  here was a man who was known right away from the Rockies down to the Pacific
  Slope. Wherever men congregated, especially men of the lawless type, there
  the name of Patrick Walsh was whispered in accents of admiration. There were
  countless stories told about him of his courage and fearlessness, of his
  utter indifference to death. Never once had anybody got the best of him,
  never once had he hesitated when he wanted to mark a point or avenge an
  insult. With it all, it was decidedly in Walsh's favour that his record was
  clean. If he won, as frequently he did, large sums at the gambling-table, his
  methods had never been questioned. That he had questioned the methods of
  others more than one so-called sportsman had found to his cost. Indeed, a
  book might have been written about Patrick Walsh, telling of his exploits and
  performances. There was not a man in that part of the country who did not
  remember the fate of Jake Monson.</p>

  <p>He had been the terror of a whole handful of States&mdash;a man hated, and
  loathed, and feared&mdash;who had wound up his career with a crime beyond all
  words. And yet no hand had been stretched out for him. By sheer force of
  terrorism he would compel honest men to sit and drink with him, until the
  word went out from Patrick Walsh that the wolf must die. Walsh sent this
  message in a courteous letter, and for six months Colorado watched the duel
  with breathless interest. It watched Monson grow from the magnificent
  semblance of exuberant humanity to a trembling, broken wretch whose nerves
  were worn to fiddle-strings. And all this time Monson never saw the man who
  was upon his track. He lost an eye, an ear, the fingers of his right hand,
  whilst his antagonist remained absolutely invisible. And then, finally, after
  a heavy drinking bout up there amongst the hills, Monson turned his revolver
  upon himself and put a bullet through his own heart.</p>

  <p>This, then, was the man that Long Jim and his companions had to contend
  with. He sat there quiet and almost listless, with his hands in his pockets.
  Nobody knew better than himself how tight a place he was in. These were no
  cowards that he had to oppose him, but reckless, desperate men, ready for
  anything. Still they hesitated. If they had turned their revolvers upon him
  simultaneously there would have been an end of Patrick Walsh, but the first
  man that produced a weapon was as good as dead, so that neither of them cared
  to make the first advance. They drew a little on one side and sat down to eat
  their breakfast. What was going to happen Walsh had already guessed. These
  ruffians would wait till he and Nell Macey had entered the long, wooded
  passes leading to Dolvertown, and there the trouble would begin in earnest.
  There was no doubt why Long Jim and the rest were here. They had followed
  Mrs. Macey for the diamonds. They would have owned it freely enough had they
  been asked, for they were three to one, and the Nemesis of the law in those
  parts was no more than a mockery and a shadow.</p>

  <p>Nell looked at her companion with tears in her eyes. She had expected
  something more formidable than this. It seemed almost impossible that the
  little man with the white face and sensitive mouth should be the famous
  Patrick Walsh, but in some strange way she pinned her faith to him. She felt
  perfectly certain that despite the danger he would pull her through.</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best," Walsh said, curtly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am sure you will," Nell replied. "But how do you know what I was
  thinking about?"</p>

  <p>"It wants no great foresight," Walsh murmured. "You are wondering how I am
  going to save your treasures and my own life at the same time. But I shall do
  it. Now, can you trust me&mdash;I mean, can you trust me implicitly?"</p>

  <p>"I am certain of it," Nell said, impulsively.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. In that case I want you to do exactly as you are told.
  Now, you know what those carrion are here for; you know why they followed
  you. Despite their assumed indifference they are watching us as a cat watches
  a mouse. I want you to hand me those diamonds over openly and without any
  attempt at disguise I will see that you are not robbed. And then I want you
  to go right home again and tell your husband all that has happened."</p>

  <p>"But," Nell protested, "it does not seem&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Walsh turned his face in her direction. The features had grown hard and
  firm and merciless; the eyes were long slits of flame.</p>

  <p>"You've got to do what I tell you," Walsh said. "Didn't I give you my
  word, and did any man ever know me to break it? Now hand those stones over.
  Give them to me so that there can be no mistake about those fellows seeing
  what you are doing. If this adventure comes off all right I will laugh those
  three ruffians off the Continent of America. Now, come."</p>

  <p>In a dazed kind of way Nell handed over the jewels. Walsh took them out of
  their little envelope and examined each carefully between his finger and
  thumb. From under his brows he could see how anxiously the three men on the
  ridge were regarding him. Then he turned over on his side as if to light his
  pipe, but in reality he was doing something with the stones. Nell could hear
  a clicking kind of sound and the rustling of paper, but she did not venture
  to move because Walsh, curtly enough, bade her to sit exactly as she was and
  take no notice of what he was doing. At the end of a minute or two she heard
  a chuckle by her side, and when Walsh sat up again there was a grim smile of
  amusement on his thin lips.</p>

  <p>"Now we are ready for the play to begin," he said. "And don't you be
  afraid. But, then, you are not that sort of woman. Go straight back home and
  tell your husband exactly what has happened. Tell him that if I am alive in a
  week's time he shall hear from me, and if I am dead he shall hear from me,
  too. No, you need not thank me. This is just one of the moments in one's life
  that is worth living. I wouldn't have missed a chance like this for ten
  thousand dollars."</p>

         title="He took Nell's fingers and held them to his lips.">
  </div><br>

  <p>There was nothing for it but for Nell to obey. She was ashamed of herself
  in a way, and yet, at the same time, she was carried away by the amazing
  force of this man's will. He rose to his feet. He offered Nell his arm with a
  gesture of almost exaggerated courtesy; he stalked gravely by the three men
  sitting there; he walked up the slope to the top of the bluffs whence they
  could see the long, sinuous road winding away towards One Tree Gulch, like a
  white parting in a head of black hair. And here Walsh held out a hand to his
  companion. He took Nell's fingers and held them to his lips. He swept off his
  big-brimmed soft hat, as one of the cavaliers in the old days might have
  done.</p>

  <p>"There's your way," he said. "Now take it without hesitation. I will stay
  here till you are out of sight. Those three gentlemen down below can see me,
  and so long as I am in sight they will make no effort to follow. If I had a
  horse I should feel equal to the lot of them, but, then, on the other hand,
  the adventure would lose its piquancy. And now, good-bye."</p>

  <p>For a long time Walsh stood there like a graven statue against the blue
  sky. Nell turned and waved her hand to him as she disappeared presently
  amongst the waving pines. Then Walsh strolled back to the camp coolly and
  casually, past the huts and the stores, and so away down the pass which led
  dizzily to Dolvertown. He had no friends there to help him; he was a stranger
  in those parts. Probably if he had mentioned his name people might have
  refused to believe him. His thin lips were pressed tightly together; his eyes
  flickered in a smile of slow amusement. No sooner had he turned the corner
  than he sprang nimbly to the summit of a rock whence he could command a view
  of the camp. The smile widened when he saw that Long Jim and his companions
  had already vanished. He stood there listening for the sound of a broken twig
  or the dull thud of a footstep. He took his soft hat from his head and held
  it above the bushes. There was the quick snap of a revolver shot and the
  sombrero fell at his feet. Walsh laughed softly. The game had begun in
  earnest now. He was ready and eager for the fray. There was nothing to be
  greatly alarmed at as yet. He knew those ruffians were afraid of him; he knew
  perfectly well that they would hesitate a long time before they came to close
  quarters. Of their intentions he had no manner of doubt. Those men meant to
  rob him and they meant to murder him, too.</p><br>

         title=
         "The three men... called simultaneously that the trouble was over.">
  </div><br>

  <p>So the game went on mile after mile, till the centre of the big belt of
  pines was reached. The bluff rose sharply here. Beyond it was a ragged slope
  of undergrowth with a stream of water hurrying along to its foot. Here Walsh
  halted. He knew that the men were on three sides of him now; he could hear
  their footsteps rustling in the dead leaves. And he was taking no risks. He
  knew the class of men he had to deal with. He knew that he was fighting with
  antagonists whose knowledge of woodcraft was almost equal to his own. Then
  just for a moment he exposed himself&mdash;only for an instant, but it was
  sufficient to draw the fire of revolvers from three directions. Then Walsh
  threw up his hands, and from his lips came that horrible bubbling scream
  which tells eloquently enough of a man who has been shot in some vital part.
  He lay prone on his face, his left arm outstretched, his right doubled up
  under him. There was a small ragged hole over his left breast from which the
  blood appeared to be oozing. He lay there so stark and stiff and horrible
  that the three men creeping over the dead leaves from different directions
  whistled and called simultaneously that the trouble was over, and that there
  was an end of Patrick Walsh, save for his glorious and romantic memory. For
  those three men were deadly shots. They wanted no flattery so far as their
  revolver practice was concerned.</p>

  <p>Long Jim grinned as he rose to his feet, the others sniggered. For,
  apparently, Walsh had come to the end of his tether; apparently he had
  allowed himself to be driven into a corner whence there was no escape. He
  could not have doubled on his tracks, and no man really in his senses would
  have dared the leap over the edge of the bluff into those swirling waters
  below.</p>

  <p>"Right through the heart," Long Jim said, hoarsely. "Jehoshaphat, ain't he
  bleeding! Now, then, boys&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They came brutally, callously forward. Then, as if by magic, the prostrate
  figure moved an inch, and three revolver shots rang out in lightning
  succession. Long Jim staggered back with a bullet in his shoulder, screaming
  and blaspheming with pain; his two companions went foaming and writhing and
  holding a pair of trembling hands to the fleshy part of their thighs. It had
  all taken place in the twinkling of an eye, and before the three ruffians
  could recover themselves sufficiently to realize what had happened Walsh was
  rolling swiftly over and over towards the edge of the bluff. With a yell of
  defiance and an outbreak of derisive laughter, he bent himself backwards like
  a bow and flashed headlong into the yellow stream which lay thirty feet
  below.</p>

  <p>He came up presently, gasping and panting and chilled to the very marrow
  by the icy coldness of the water; but his heart was light, and his lips were
  parted in a smile as he bent down and sped through the undergrowth with his
  white face turned in the direction of Dolvertown.</p>

  <p>"That was a close call," he muttered. "I don't know when I have enjoyed
  anything so much. And unless you are greatly mistaken in your calculations,
  Pat Walsh, the next trick is going to be yours."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">IT was getting dusk a week later when Walsh put in an
  appearance at Tom Macey's hut. His welcome was all that he could wish; in
  fact, Tom Macey, in his clumsy way, professed to be half jealous of the way
  in which Nell received her visitor.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we're all right," he said. "And the kid is much better. I dare say we
  shall be able to manage till the end of the summer now. Seems ungrateful,
  don't it, to worry about those diamonds, and the kid's all right again? Guess
  you had to give them up."</p>

  <p>Walsh smiled dryly.</p>

  <p>"Well, not quite in the way you think," he said. "I expected to worry
  through that little trouble, and I did. But I had to take no risks. I wasn't
  going to go under with those stones in my possession, so I hit upon a little
  scheme of my own, which I will explain to you presently. You will laugh when
  you hear it, and you will be all the more amused because the laugh will be on
  your side. And if you want to see your stones again you will have to come
  with me this evening. Slip a brace of revolvers in your pocket. There is no
  great danger, Mrs. Macey. Tom will be home by midnight, and when he comes
  back you will be able to sit up and talk it over, and decide what you are
  going to do with your money. I can't tell you any more at present. I don't
  want to spoil the joke."</p>

  <p>There were a couple of horses outside, and in silence the two men rode
  together up the rocky mountain passes, till they came at length to a little
  camp under the pines below the snow-line. It was a fresh camp, but already it
  boasted its saloon, where a score or more of men sat gambling and drinking.
  Beyond the thick haze of acrid tobacco-smoke Long Jim and his companions sat
  over a game of monte. They appeared to be none the better for their
  adventure. Their faces were pallid and lank under their mask of dirt. Long
  Jim's shoulder appeared to have been strapped up with some rude attempt at
  bandaging; the other two sat on a chair with a leg resting on another one.
  The forbidding assemblage looked up as Patrick Walsh entered. He had a
  revolver in his hand. The big, square frame of Tom Macey loomed behind him,
  his finger crooked on the trigger of another weapon.</p>

  <p>"Now don't any of you move," Walsh commanded, crisply. "My business is
  with those three skunks in the corner yonder. Hands up, there! Now, Mr. Long
  Jim, get a move on you. Ah, that's better. Now let's see you smile."</p>

  <p>An ominous growl went up from the motley assembly. The hand of more than
  one man strayed to his hip pocket, but somehow they hesitated as their
  glances fell upon that white, still face of the man in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"I have warned you," he rasped out. "Perhaps you don't know me. My name is
  Patrick Walsh."</p>

  <p>"By Heaven, it is, too!" a voice growled behind the tobacco-smoke. "Boys,
  this is no affair of ours."</p>

  <p>The effect of the words was electrical. A dead, respectful silence fell
  upon the gamblers as Long Jim and his companions moved forward with their
  hands above their heads. They dragged themselves miserably into the outer
  air, no man following, for Walsh had been emphatic on that point, and he was,
  above all things, a man of his word. He stood there looking grimly on while
  Macey bound the prisoners together with raw hides, and presently they were
  fastened to the saddles of the two adventurers, and so the melancholy
  procession moved slowly down the mountain side. There was no word said, no
  sound but the regular tread of hoofs until the party arrived at length at
  something superior in the way of a ranch in one of the valleys lying there
  below One Tree Gulch. An alert man in spectacles came out and bade them
  welcome. He seemed to be expecting Walsh, for he bade the whole party to come
  inside. Here, laid out on the table, were surgical instruments, sharp-looking
  knives, and other terrors to the uninitiated.</p>

  <p>"Friends of mine," Walsh said, curtly. "I am very anxious about their
  welfare. You see, they all met with a bit of an accident a few days ago. The
  estimable Long Jim has got a bullet in his shoulder, and Mr. Ned Carson and
  Dick Blake are suffering from the same inconvenience in the thick part of the
  thigh. It is a pity you haven't got anything in the way of an anaesthetic,
  but, Lord, what's a few moments' pain to brave chaps like these?"</p>

  <p>"What's the pastime?" Long Jim asked, anxiously.</p>

  <p>By way of reply he was jerked unceremoniously on his back and speedily
  stripped to the skin. He howled and writhed there impotently whilst the man
  in the spectacles probed scientifically in the wound. A moment later at the
  end of a pair of forceps he held up a round object triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Got him," he explained, "touch of dressing and you'll be all right in a
  week, my lad. Now, you others, come along."</p><br>

  <p>Three miserable men sat round the fire presently whilst Walsh held in his
  hand the three pellets which the doctor had so successfully extracted. He
  wiped them with a piece of lint and handed them over to Macey.</p>

  <p>"There you are," he said, quietly. "There are your diamonds back again.
  Now, perhaps, you see my little scheme. It was impossible for your wife to
  get to Dolvertown, and, as there were three of those ruffians to one, I
  wasn't going to take any risks. I couldn't hide the stones because if I had
  gone under you would have lost them, and so I extracted the bullets from
  three of my revolver cartridges and put the diamonds in their place. And for
  the last week or nine days these three beauties have been walking about with
  a diamond apiece under their skin and they none the wiser. I told the doctor
  here all about it. I tracked those chaps to their shanty up in the mountains,
  and the rest you know."</p>

         title="'There you are,' he said, quietly.">
  </div><br>

  <p>A stream of oaths broke from Long Jim's lips. His companions to the best
  of their artistic ability backed him up. Walsh turned upon them with a queer,
  dry smile.</p>

  <p>"That will do," he said. "Now you can go. And the first man I meet within
  a hundred miles of this place I'll shoot on sight. But there's no reason to
  worry about you; you'll never stay here after this. Even the boys would laugh
  at you. Good night, doctor. Now let's get back and tell the story to your
  wife."</p><br>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Mar 1908</h3>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">THE east wind had been blowing all day, and snow was falling
  in a fine powder. It was past twelve o'clock, and the streets in the West End
  were more than usually deserted. Here and there the snow had drifted in
  wreaths and eddies so that, though the pavement was swept, bare here in
  places, an little further on the white drifts of the snow were knee-deep,
  gleaming and sparkling in the lamplight. A wind cold and piercing seemed to
  strike Jameson like a blow us he turned into Rupert Street. He pulled his
  collar up closer about his throat, rejoicing in the fact that he had not far
  to go now to where a warm fire in his library awaited him. On the whole, the
  rising young physician had had rather a busy day. He was beginning to feel
  his feet now, and was ceasing to regret that he had given up a competency in
  the country for the more ambitious uncertainties of the West End
  practice.</p>

  <p>To a certain extent the struggle was over now. He had managed to pay for
  the fitting out of his expensive house; the dread of the recurring
  quarter-days no longer disturbed his rest. Another year like this and he
  would be fairly round the corner.</p>

  <p>He stopped on his own door-step and fumbled for his latchkey. The house
  stood at an angle of two roads and felt the full force of the searching wind.
  The snow in the doorstep was so deep that Jameson had literally to force his
  way to the door. The cold had brought the tears streaming to his eyes. He
  wiped them away now as a sudden fancy occurred to him. Surely there was
  something on the doorstep which was not altogether snow. The black object
  stood out clear and distinct here and there, and Jameson could see something
  that glittered like a diamond. Half idly he stooped to investigate, then he
  drew back with a startled cry.</p>

  <p>There was nothing the matter with his nerves, but, at the same time, it
  was alarming to lay his bare hand upon a cold, frozen arm of a woman in
  evening dress. She might have been dead, for all Jameson knew to the
  contrary, for the arm was as cold as ice. He could see now the outline of a
  pale face in a fringe of jet black hair.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300971h-images/CrossedSwords1.jpg"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>He threw the door open hastily and raised the unconscious form from the
  snowdrift. The warmth of the hall tingled in his veins gratefully. The lights
  were still left on, though the house was quiet enough as Jameson carried his
  burden into the library and laid the girl in an armchair by the side of the
  blazing fire. He could see now that she was dressed in some thin, black
  material which left her arms and gleaming neck bare. The dress was shabby
  enough, though it bore the impress of costliness and fashion; but altogether
  it seemed out of place in connection with the magnificent jewels which the
  stranger was wearing round her neck and in her hair. It was no time to
  fritter away over these details.</p>

  <p>Just for a moment or two it seemed to Jameson that the unfortunate woman
  was past all assistance of his. He chafed the cold hands vigorously. He
  managed to coax a few drops of brandy between the blue lips. He could feel
  the feeble fluttering of the heart now. The long, fringed lashes were lifted,
  and a pair of eyes of the deepest blue unveiled themselves splendidly. They
  seemed to light up the whole face and render it doubly beautiful.</p>

  <p>"You are feeling better now?" Jameson asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so." the stranger said in a faint. whisper. "But where am I? And
  what am I doing here?"</p>

  <p>The last word was hardly audible. The long, purple, fringed lashes dropped
  again, and the stranger seemed to sleep. Jameson stood there looking at her
  absolutely lost in bewildered astonishment. He could see now that he was not
  too late, and that youth and a vigorous constitution would do the rest. The
  blood was beginning to pulsate again over the temples; the stranger's
  breathing was no longer short and irregular. And yet Jameson stood there
  looking at her just as if he had never seen a woman before in her peculiar
  situation. He stole gently from the room and called quietly at the foot of
  the stairs. A moment later and a lady came down. Jameson had few secrets from
  his sister Violet, who acted as his companion and housekeeper. She looked at
  him questioningly now out of her pleasant, grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"You look as if you seen a ghost," she said.</p>

  <p>"I think I have, Vio1et," Jameson responded. "I have had quite an
  adventure. I found an unfortunate woman at the point of death on the
  doorstep, and very naturally I brought her into the house. Whether or not she
  was coming to see me is an open question, The fact remains that she is
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you know who she is?" Miss Jameson asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, I do," Jameson replied. "That is the extraordinary part of it.
  You remember my telling you all about my adventures in Russia during the year
  I was there as assistant-surgeon to the British Embassy. You will recollect
  the romantic story of Princess Ida Stefanoff."</p>

  <p>Violet Jameson nodded her head brightly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't want to make a long story of it, but Princess Ida is here
  at the present moment under our roof, slowly recovering in the library. I
  don't suppose she knows me except by repute, hut. I recognised her
  instantly."</p>

  <p>"It seems almost incredible!" Violet Jameson cried. "But I was under the
  impression that the Princess was dead. Didn't she disappear in a mysterious
  manner about a year ago? I think I remember reading something about it in the
  papers. Didn't her husband suspect that there was foul play, and wasn't he
  supposed to be searching Europe over for his wife?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Jameson said somewhat impatiently. "And there was
  some scandal about a certain Count Glenstein who was some sort of relation of
  the Princess. I believe there was some diplomatic tangle at the bottom of it.
  Anyway, Prince Boris Stefanoff was banished from the Russian Court, and I
  don't think he has been heard of since. But, then, one never hopes to get to
  the bottom of these tangles, especially when the Russian police have the
  matter in hand. But I ought to be ashamed of myself for wasting time here
  like this. I want you to come and give me a helping hand with the Princess,
  and, above all things, I want you to be discreet and cautious. Please ask no
  questions, and don't let it he assumed for an instant that you know who the
  Princess really is."</p>

  <p>Miss Jameson murmured something to the effect that her brother could rely
  on her, and together they returned to the library. The unfortunate stranger
  was sitting up in the chair now. A little colour had returned to her cheeks,
  her great blue eyes were shining like stars. She did not appear to recognise
  anything incongruous in the situation. She did not seem cognisant of the fact
  that her shabby evening dress was out of place with the bewildering jewels
  which she wore. She was just a little hazy and confused, too, just a little
  uncertain of her surroundings.</p>

  <p>"I am so very sorry to trouble you," she said in excellent English. She
  spoke with the suspicion of an effort, as if she were battling against her
  weakness still. "You see, the fact is, I have not been very well lately. I
  have had a good deal of trouble, too. A little time ago I had to leave my
  lodgings hurriedly. I had just had a letter which compelled me to do so.
  Unfortunately I had no money, and so I had to walk. The wind blew my cloak
  away, and I was so dazed with the cold that I could not find it. I suppose I
  fainted on your doorstep. Really, I am very much ashamed of myself. I wonder
  if you would mind doing me a favour?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the doctor replied; "anything you like, Please do not excite
  yourself. You are far from strong yet. And now tell me what I can do for
  you."</p>

  <p>"I was looking for a Dr. Jameson," the stranger said. "I understand he
  lives somewhere near here. I am told that he is a man one can trust. He did a
  great service for a friend of mine once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am the man you are looking for," Jameson replied. "You can command my
  services. Tell me what you want."</p>

  <p>The girl half rose to her feet with a joyous exclamation. Then she fell
  back again, and the blue eyes were hidden for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is great good luck!" she murmured; "far better luck than I
  deserve. I cannot tell you how thankful I am that Providence has guided me
  here to-night. If you can help me now, I think I can see my way to the end of
  my troubles. And here am I wasting time when every moment is precious. You
  are a brave man enough, Mr. Jameson&mdash;I know that. You proved the fact
  more than once when you were in St. Petersburg. And now I want you to trust
  me implicitly. I want you to take my word for everything without asking any
  name. Will you do this for me?"</p>

  <p>The great melting blue eyes were turned imploringly towards Jameson's
  face. They moved him as he had never been moved before, and, in any case, he
  would have found it hard to deny the request.</p>

  <p>"I will do anything you please," he said, "and I will do it as soon as you
  like. Now, what is it that is so troubling you? And is the matter so very
  urgent?"</p>

  <p>"It is a matter of life and death," the stranger went on. "I want you to
  go round to Humber Street, off Leicester Square, and say that that are a
  doctor who has been sent to see Mr. Boris. I am afraid it is not a nice place
  nor a very desirable neighbourhood, but you will he quite safe. Will you do
  this? I am..."</p>

  <p>The pleading voice trailed away in a whisper, the slim figure in the chair
  grew limp once more.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">VIOLET JAMESON glanced anxiously at her brother.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is all right," he said cheerfully. "She will come round in a
  minute or two. She appears to be suffering in her mind as well as body, and
  when she finds I have gone off on her errand, she will pick up fast enough.
  You don't mind being left here alone with her, do you? I know you are as good
  as half-a-dozen doctors in a crisis like this. However, if on
  like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No,no," Miss Jameson said hastily. "I am not in the least afraid. And I
  can manage perfectly well. You had better go at once. Goodness knows what
  harm it will do if you delay!"</p>

  <p>Jameson laid a resolute hand upon his fur coat and buttoned it up tightly
  round his throat. He was chivalrous enough and kind-hearted enough, he was
  quite desperately anxious to serve the pathetic little beauty lying there in
  the armchair; but, all the same, the adventure was not exactly to his taste.
  This kind of thing had been all very well during his Russian experiences,
  when he was in a position of greater freedom and less responsibility. But it
  hardly befitted a rising young physician in Rupert Street who aspired to an
  aristocratic family practice. Still, there was something in the Princess
  which could not be resisted. She was a noted beauty with more or less of a
  European reputation. She had figured brilliantly in politics; moreover, she
  had married one of the handsomest and richest men in Russia. It was a pure
  love match, too, which made the mystery all the more alluring.</p>

  <p>Then, with unexpected swiftness, the crash had come, without a word of
  warning the bolt had fallen from the blue. The Princess had mysteriously
  disappeared. It was whispered that she dare not show her face in Russia
  again. She had gone over to the Nihilist faction, it was said; she had abused
  her position shamefully. Anyway, she had vanished, leaving no trace behind,
  and for the best part of a year Prince Boris Stefanoff had been searching for
  her. It was rumoured that he also had fallen under the ban of the Emperor's
  displeasure, but as to that, no one outside the Court circle knew anything.
  It was all very well for the Society journalists to hint and nod their heads
  wisely, but they were just as ignorant as other people. And now the thing was
  nearly forgotten.</p>

  <p>Jameson was turning these matters over in his mind as he strode in the
  direction of Humber Street. He had a fairly wide and extensive knowledge of
  London, and he knew pretty well where he was going. Unless he was greatly
  mistaken, the address which the Princess had given him was that of a foreign
  night-club, which more than once had come under the observation of the
  police. The establishment had the shadiest of reputations, and probably more
  than one crime of international magnitude had been hatched there. Besides the
  injury to his reputation if the matter became public, Jameson ran a
  considerable personal risk, as he very well knew. But with the glamour of
  that pleading voice and those blue eyes upon him he did not hesitate.
  Besides, the romance of the whole thing appealed to him. And he, too, was
  young.</p>

  <p>He came to the house at 1ength&mdash;an old-fashioned, sombre-looking
  place, which appeared to be in total darkness, except for a feeble gleam of
  gas over the fanlight. But, then, as Jameson knew very well, this apparently
  respectable dullness was very little indication of what was taking place
  inside. He rapped qietly on the door, which presently opened an inch or two,
  and a vile, repulsive face looked out. It was a red and tattered face,
  belonging unmistakably to a broken-down pugilist, just the type of bully and
  plucky ruffian who usually acts as Cerberus to shady haunts of this
  character. In a surly tone of voice he asked Jameson's business.</p>

  <p>"I have come to see Mr. Boris," Jameson said curtly. "Don't keep me
  standing here on the pavement all night."</p>

  <p>The curtness and straightness of the reply seemed to have its effect, for
  the door was opened sufficiently wide to admit Jameson, then was closed to
  and bolted again. Beyond a pair of baize doors was a large, brilliantly
  lighted hall, and again beyond that a glittering-looking bar, where a score
  or two of foreigners were drinking and talking, and to the left of this
  another room, with shaded green lights over the tables, where a grim, silent
  company were indulging in the fascinations of roulette. Jameson saw the
  cicerone glancing at him eagerly askance as he took in these details. A
  devout prayer rose from his lips that the police would refrain from raiding
  the premises so long as he was there. Without a single word said on either
  side, the decayed pugilist conducted him upstairs and pointed with a dirty,
  knotted hand to a closed door.</p>

  <p>"In there," he said. "And when you come out, knock with your heel three
  times on the floor. I'll put you out then."</p>

  <p>Jameson tapped at the door, and a somewhat imperious voice bade him enter.
  He found himself in a long, low apartment, none too clean, and which was
  entirely devoid of furniture, save for a table and a couple of armchairs on
  either side of the fireplace. The windows were closely shattered and barred,
  the whole place was insufficiently lighted by one plain electric lamp which
  hung on its flex naked and unadorned from the ceiling. In one of the
  armchairs sat a man in evening dress&mdash;a tall, distinguished-looking man,
  whose bearing and the cut of whose hair were decidedly military. He had a
  trim moustache turned up at the corners. The hair on his temples was turning
  grey. He had discarded his dress-coat, which he had pitched carelessly on the
  door. He had in his hand a rapier which gleamed in the light of the lamp.</p>

  <p>The other man in the opposite armchair was hardly less
  distinguished-looking, but his features were more sullen, and his eyes less
  clear and steadfast. He, too, had discarded his coat. He, too, had a
  duelling sword in his hand. From the expression of the men's faces as they
  glanced at one another, it was evident that a bitter enmity existed between
  them. Just for a moment Jameson stood contemplating these dramatic
  ingredients of a high tragedy, then he ventured to introduce himself by
  name.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," the man with the slight moustache said. "As a
  matter of fact, I sent for you, Dr. Jameson. You don't know who I am, but I
  know you perfectly well, which is much more to the point. Let us say that I
  am A and my friend yonder is B. Let it be assumed for a. moment that I have
  been looking for B for the pest twelve months, and that at length I have
  found him. He has done me the worst injury one man can do another, and now I
  am going to kill him. At least, that is my programme. Possibly he may kill
  <i>me</i>. But I am going to give him a chance for his life, which is more
  than he deserves. If, unfortunately, I shall get the worst of this encounter,
  I want you to bear witness that the fight was a fair one. In the probable
  event of it being a drawn battle, or one of us being severely wounded, I hope
  you will allow us to place ourselves in your hands, so that you
  may&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But the thing is absurd, your Highness&mdash;I mean sir," Jameson
  stammered. "Such things are not allowed in London."</p>

  <p>The late speaker smiled grimly. As s matter of fact, the situation was
  somewhat extravagant. It was like some chapter from from one of Lever's*
  novels. The man with the slight moustache rose and crossed to the door. He
  turned the key in the lock and put it in his pocket. Then he smiled genially
  on Jameson.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Charles Lever (1806-1872): Anglo-Irish novelist,
  physician, and diplomat. <a href=

  Web</a>.]</p>

  <p>"I quite understand your feelings," he said. "If I were a rising physician
  like yourself, I should take the same view exactly. But if anything serious
  happens, I will see that you are indemnified. Count, I am at your
  service."</p>

  <p>The other man rose from his chair and raised his weapon. He looked more
  pale and less confident than his antagonist. There was something shifty and
  uneasy in his glance. But, then, before Jameson could interfere or protest,
  the two men fell upon one another with incredible fury, the clashing din of
  their swords filled the room.</p>

  <p>In spite of himself, in spite of his prudence, Jameson stood there
  thrilled and fascinated. He was fond of fencing himself. He knew something of
  the art, but he had never witnessed swordsmanship like this before. It seemed
  to him as if those two lithe, glittering blades had been turned to water.
  Round and round they played in waving, liquid circles, blade crashed on
  blade, a little train of sparks shimmered in the uncertain light. It was a
  combat to the death between two masters. They played round one another, light
  of foot and quick of muscle. Jameson could see their faces moistening as if
  both had been sprinkled with water. And yet the play of the blades went on,
  the fierce thrust and parry, as if this had been part of some dazzling
  entertainment designed entirely for Jameson's benefit. He began to wonder,
  too, whether he would wake up in his bed and find that the whole thing been a
  vivid dream.</p><br>

  <p>So closely was he following this outlet for hate and passion that for the
  moment or two he quite failed to hear the sudden din and commotion which
  arose from the rooms below. There was borne in on his ears now cries and
  yells and curses, and the sound of a shot, and then the quick splintering of
  smashing wood. Dimly Jameson began to comprehend that there was a raid on the
  premises just at the dramatic moment when he least desired it. He forgot his
  own danger now. He was conscious of a feeling of disappointment that he would
  not he permitted to see this duel through to its logical conclusion. Already
  someone was tapping imperiously on the door.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the light went out and the room was left in darkness. It
  seemed to make not the slightest effect to the combatants, for Jameson could
  still hear the clash of blades. He saw the little trail of sparks failing
  swiftly. Then a blade clattered, and there was a heavy thud upon the
  floor.</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">JAMESON was thrilling to his finger-tips now. He suddenly
  seemed to realise the peculiar horror of the situation. His practised ear
  told him what the heavy breathing of one of the combatants meant, He knew
  that a yard or two away in the velvet darkness the tragedy was being
  consummated. And still the hammering at the door went on gaining in force
  until the wood began to creak and the framework fell into the room with a
  crash. Almost at the same instant the electric bulb thickened to a tangle of
  flame, into a brilliant white light, and the room was flooded once more with
  illumination.</p>

  <p>The man who has been alluded to as B lay at length on the floor, propping
  himself up on one arm and glaring with malignant fury at his antagonist, who
  stood swaying over him and his hand to his left aide, where a thin red thread
  had commenced to trickle over the white expanse of his shirt. Evidently the
  man on the floor was badly hurt, and, so far as Jameson could see, the victor
  had not escaped scot-free. Before he could interfere, a score of policemen
  were in the room, headed by a natty-looking inspector in plain clothes.</p>

  <p>"You are our prisoners" the inspector said curtly. "Well, what is the
  meaning of this? Surely I know your face, sir. I am certain that we have met
  before."</p>

  <p>The man with his hand of his side smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your memory has not played you false," he said. "You are Inspector Ralli,
  and we have met before. The last time, I think, was in St. Petersburg."</p>

  <p>The inspector's face dropped a little. Evidently was embarrassed and
  inclined to be apologetic.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," he said. "I came here to-night with my men to raid
  this house. The people here have been giving a good deal of trouble lately,
  and we have had them under observation for a long time. By the way, sir, are
  you not Dr. Jameson?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Heaven, yes!" Jameson said disconsolately. "I assure you that I am
  quite an innocent party in this matter, though I don't suppose you will
  believe me."</p>

  <p>"I think he will," the tall duellist said, with a smile. "I fancy I shall
  be able to put matters right with Inspector Ralli. You see, he is a
  fellow-countrymen of mine, and he happens to know perfectly well who I
  am."</p>

  <p>"I know your Imperial Highness," Balli replied. "almost&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who speaks of Imperial Highness?" the tall man said coldly. "I think for
  the moment, at any rate, we had better leave that out of the question. I can
  assure you, Inspector. that we did not come here to gamble; in fact, my
  friend who is lying on the carpet here is for the present hiding in the
  house. To a certain extent he is mixed up with the mysterious disappearance
  of certain State papers and the subsequent mystery which ended in the
  retirement of Princes Stefanoff from society; in fact, as the agent, let us
  say, of the Prince, I have been fighting our friend here for the possession
  of certain papers. I don't think he will decline to tell me now where they
  are; indeed, I am sure he won't."</p>

  <p>"They are in my coat pocket on the chair yonder," the man on the floor
  said sulkily. "What this gentleman has told you is quite right, Inspector. I
  am lodging in the house, though I am bound to confess that I was very foolish
  to come here, especially as I knew the character of the place. But,
  incidentally I may mention that I shall be glad of Dr. Jameson's services. I
  think I am rather more hurt than he supposes."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the tall man had drawn Inspector Ralli on one side and was
  whispering to him in a corner of the room. Presently at a slight sign the
  police disappeared, the noise downstairs subsided, and the house grew still
  once more. It was an hour or so later before the injured man was in a
  condition to be moved, and before Jameson had skillfully bound up the slight
  but flesh wound in the right side of the other combatant. Inspector Ralli was
  still lingering on the pavement when they reached the street.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I had to take your names and addresses," he said. "Believe me,
  gentlemen, it will be your own faults if you hear any more of this matter. No
  doubt his Imperial&mdash;I mean this gentleman here will call at the Russian
  Embassy to-morrow and explain matters. I will ask you to do this, sir, for my
  sake. A discreet silence on the subject, I am sure, will be appreciated.
  Perhaps I have said too much, but his Imperial&mdash; Well, good-night,
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>The inspector disappeared, whilst Jameson and his companion climbed into a
  cab.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there is any reason to explain matters," the Russian said,
  "I am quite certain, Dr. Jameson, that you know everything that is
  essential."</p>

  <p>"I think I do," Jameson said discreetly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, in that case we will say no more about it. I am glad to know
  that a certain lady who shall be nameless&mdash;you know whom I
  mean&mdash;succeeded in finding you. I only knew where she was late this
  evening, when it was impossible to go round to her lodgings. I sent her a
  hurried telegram asking her to call upon you and enlist your services for our
  recent little encounter. You see, I have been on a wrong tack altogether. As
  the agent, let us say, of Prince Boris Stefanoff, I never guessed that that
  poisonous scoundrel whom I called B just now had behaved so badly in the
  matter of the Princess. Being a relation of hers, she never suspected
  anything. The Princess trusted him entirely, so that he had no difficult in
  getting hold of those paper. He managed to explain to the Princess that it
  was her husband who was the traitor, and when the poor lady really discovered
  what had taken place, she was half beside herself with grief, she hardly knew
  what to do. She made the mistake of running away from her husband instead of
  confessing everything to him. She left his house and changed her name and
  started for England with the wild idea of recovering possession of those
  documents. It never seemed to occur to her what a wild tangle she was leaving
  behind. Why, if it had not been for certain circumstances, I should have
  been&mdash;I mean, the Prince would have been sent to Siberia. He got on the
  track of his wife a day or two ago, then he discovered how nobly and
  foolishly she had been acting. But you are a wise man in our day and
  generation, Dr. Jameson, and I know you will want to ask no further
  questions. Perhaps you will be good enough to tell me where the Princess is,
  so that I may&mdash;I mean, so that I can take her back to her husband."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Jameson said gravely. "She is in my house. How she got there
  and what adventures she went through first, she will tell you herself. It
  will be far better, I think, if you see her alone. She has been very much
  upset, and I am sure would prefer not to see either my sister or myself
  again&mdash;at least, not just for the present. We can keep the cab at my
  door till you are ready, and then, if later on she or you desire to see me
  again, I shall he very pleased to come and call upon you."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, that is very good of you!" he cried. "If you are not a
  distinguished doctor, I am sure that you would be an even more distinguished
  courtier. Evidently you were made for diplomacy. And now, doctor, I hope you
  will not be offended at what I am going to say. I- that is, his Imperial
  Highness has a good deal of influence with the wealthy Russians in London,
  and it will be no fault of his if he does not do his best to put a thing or
  two in your way. No thanks, I beg of you. All I ask is for you to be discreet
  and silent. Oh, is this the house? Perhaps you will be good enough to get out
  of the cab first."</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Dr. Jameson was discreet and silent. And even Violet
  Jameson's intimate friends never heard the faintest suggestion of the strange
  adventure of the snowy night, and the fair stranger who had so nearly lost
  her life on the doctor's doorstep. But this did not prevent them talking the
  matter over between themselves, or from following with interest the
  subsequent career of Prince and Princess Stefanoff and their new and
  brilliant prospects at the Russian Court. Apparently the romantic couple had
  not forgotten their promise, for within a short time Jameson found himself
  with all the patients he could do with, drawn from the various rich Russian
  families who had settled in London. He was making a great reputation for
  himself now.</p>

  <p>It was a year or two later, at a reception. at the Russian Embassy, that
  Jameson and his sister met their two distinguished friends again. They had
  remained discreet and silent in the background until Princess Stefanoff,
  leaning on her husband's arm, came forward to greet them.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember us?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"That is for your Imperial Highness to say," Jameson replied. "We are
  prepared to remember or forget, just as either of you choose. But I think
  that your features are familiar, though I don't imagine that my sister has
  ever seen the Prince before."</p>

  <p>The Princess stooped and kissed Violet Jameson heartily on either cheek.
  Her smile was dazzling.</p>

  <p>"You are a model couple," she said gaily, "and we are under a still deeper
  debt of gratitude than ever. And now there is one more favour I would ask of
  you. You must both come over to Russia and see us when the doctor take his
  holiday."</p>

  <p>"I think we should enjoy it," Jameson said; "in fact, I am quite sure we
  should."</p><br>

  <p class="first">RAYBOULD bit savagely into his cigarette. It was hard work
  to choke down the words of passionate contempt that rose to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know," he said, "perhaps it would be better for us to be quite
  candid. I came to you a year ago with a patent for a new electric heating
  apparatus. I proposed to supersede coal altogether at a fifth of the price.
  You have stolen my idea, and now offer me a beggarly sum by way of
  compensation."</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand pounds," the junior partner in the House of Merides said,
  softly. "A pretty price for a little more than a year's work!"</p>

  <p>Raybould could not repress a smile. There was nothing subtle about the
  business at all. This precious pair were millionaires; both of them on the
  verge of the grave, and without kith or kin, were just as keen about this
  piece of robbery as if it had been of vital importance to them, and Raybould
  was perfectly helpless&mdash;he did not need these rascally Greeks to tell
  him that.</p>

  <p>Raybould took another cigarette and sat calmly smoking and taking in the
  beauty of the place in which the interview was proceeding.</p>

  <p>Perhaps their taste had been inherited from a long line of ancestors going
  back to the old days of Praxiteles and the like, for there was no denying the
  exquisite artistic feeling of those choice scoundrels. The house at Staines
  was a variable dream of beauty; not the least attractive portion was the
  Winter Garden, which was situated in the centre of Staines' Court. It was
  like some great glass house, with a huge dome in the centre. The whole had
  been filled with graceful and luxurious ferns gathered from all parts of the
  world. The scheme of decoration was something novel, for, as far as Raybould
  could see, the tender green foliage climbed riotously up the pillars and
  shafts which were raised to the roof, and just for a moment, Raybould could
  not see from whence the ferns derived their nourishment. To all appearances
  the delicate tracery climbed upwards of its own volition. The light from
  outside came filtered through as if the great dome had been covered with a
  diaphanous curtain. Peter Merides seemed to divine what Raybould was thinking
  about, for he began to speak of the Winter Garden in tones of almost tender
  enthusiasm. He must have a heart somewhere under his crust of worldly guile,
  or his little black eyes would not have become so distinctly and favourably
  human.</p>

  <p>"How do those ferns live?" Raybould asked.</p>

  <p>"It is very simple," Merides chuckled. "Our idea was to have a kind of
  bower of glass literally smothered with graceful ferns. If you examine those
  iron columns, you will find they are quite moist. They are hollow and
  slightly porous, so that by forcing water through them it is possible to keep
  the roots of the ferns wet. If you will look into the dome, you will notice
  that the lower surface is concave, thus forming a natural tank of water
  between it and the summit. As for the filtered light that is quite easy,
  seeing that the whole of the outside of the conservatory had been coated with
  paint."</p>

  <p>"Which wants renewing, by the way," the younger Merides said. "The recent
  rains have washed some of the paint from the dome. But we are wasting time,
  Mr. Raybould."</p>

  <p>"Are we?" Raybould said between his teeth. "I will come over here tomorrow
  just before luncheon and let you have my final decision."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">With dogged determination and helpless rage in his heart,
  Raybould made his way the next morning in the direction of Staines Court.
  Those worldly old sinners had been quite right; he had to think of his debts
  and his wife, and after a sleepless night he had made up his mind to accept
  the ten thousand pounds in exchange for an idea that meant a colossal
  fortune.</p>

  <p>Other inventors had suffered at the hands of unscrupulous capitalists, but
  Raybould found small consolation in this reflection. The bitter smile on his
  face deepened as he followed the manservant into a small office where Manfred
  Merides was seated. The latter looked up, and smiled shrewdly in the face of
  his visitor.</p>

  <p>"I felt sure you would think better of our offer," he said. "I will go and
  fetch my brother. He is in the conservatory."</p>

  <p>Raybould nodded as Manfred Merides left the room. The house was very
  silent: no sound could be heard but the twittering of the birds outside. A
  moment later and there arose a loud startled cry that ended in a piercing
  scream. It was worse than the call of a woman in distress, it was the hoarse
  cackling shriek of a strong man beside himself with terror. At the same
  moment the brilliant sunshine was wiped off the face of the landscape by one
  of the passing clouds. Raybould dashed off hurriedly in the direction of the
  unearthly sound. He could hear once again the hideous tumult which seemed to
  him to come from the direction of the Winter Garden. There he could see
  Merides bending over an iron chair, lined with cushions, in which reposed a
  huddled heap of humanity represented by Peter Merides. The whole place was
  filled with a sickening smell of burning flesh, a little cloud of blue vapour
  was curling up to the great dome.</p>

  <p>"In heaven's name, what is the matter?" Raybould asked. "What dreadful
  thing has happened here?"</p>

  <p>Manfred Merides staggered back, and would have fallen if Raybould had not
  caught him. His face was ghastly white, with eyes starting from his head in
  terror.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," he whispered. "I do not know. I cannot tell, but I found
  him like this, my brother. You are a man of science&mdash;tell me what it all
  means."</p>

  <p>Stifling a feeling of physical repulsion, Raybould bent over the body
  lying limp and lifeless in the iron arm-chair. It required no profound
  surgical knowledge to see that Peter Merides was dead. But he had not died in
  any way known to medical science. At the first blush it looked as if he had
  been struck by a flash of lightning, for the great dome-like head had been
  utterly denuded of all fleshy tissue, and the skull lay exposed. There was no
  face to speak of, all that had been burnt away, as was the clothing nearly as
  far down as the waist. If Peter Merides had been plunged headlong into some
  firey furnace he could not have been more horribly burnt and scarred than he
  was.</p>

  <p>Raybould crossed the room and rang the bell. He gave an intimation to the
  servant who answered, saying that Mr. Peter Merides was ill and required a
  doctor without delay. The doctor came presently, but he was utterly unable to
  throw any light upon the manner in which the Greek financier had met his
  death. There was nothing for it, he said, but to remove the body to the
  house, pending the inquest which would have to be held. The doctor was still
  busy making his arrangements, so that Raybould had an opportunity of
  inspecting the scene of the extraordinary catastrophe. So far he could see,
  everything was exactly as it had been on the day before. The iron armchairs
  were scattered about the tiled floor, a pair of small tables stood there with
  cigars and cigarettes upon them. There was nothing here to indicate one of
  the most sickening phenomena that had ever taken place in the history of
  modern fatalities. Very carefully Raybould examined the seat in which the
  dead man had been reclining. So far as he could see, the cushions were
  intact, there was not the slightest sign of singeing or burning about them,
  and yet, the unfortunate man had been burnt to death beyond a shadow of a
  doubt. He had presented the appearance of a body so badly scalded as actually
  to remove the flesh from the bones. Raybould put aside at once the idea of
  personal violence. To begin with, there was no trace of anything whatever on
  the damp tiles. They were perfectly clean, and there was no hint of a
  footmark to be seen. Again, it was impossible to enter the Winter Garden
  except from the house. Raybould glanced up into the dome, but he could see
  nothing there besides the graceful feathery ferns climbing so luxuriously
  upwards. The whole thing was inexplicable, mysterious, horrible&mdash;a
  terrible visitation of God which would probably never be explained.</p>

  <p>"I cannot grasp it at all," the doctor said, as he walked back towards
  Staines with Raybould. "Of course, the inquest to-morrow will only be a
  formal opening of the inquiry to give us time to thoroughly investigate this
  ghastly business. We shall want cleverer heads than mine before the affair is
  explained."</p>

  <p>As Doctor Martin had forecasted, the tragic death of Peter Merides
  occupied public attention to the conclusion of almost everything else. The
  inquest on the body was a formal one, and almost immediately adjourned for
  further inquiries to be made. The Scotland Yard authorities frankly owned
  that they could find no trace of anything criminal in the matter. It appeared
  the Merides' domestic staff had been in the brothers' employ for some
  considerable time, and no possible suspicion could attach to them. The
  footman, who had admitted Raybould to the house gave evidence to the effect
  that he had answered his master's bell not more than five minutes before the
  discovery of the tragedy, and he was emphatically sure that there was nothing
  whatever the matter with his master at that time. He was also quite sure that
  no one besides himself had entered the Winter Garden. This simple and direct
  evidence only tended to deepen the mystery. There was nothing for it, the
  coroner said, but to adjourn the inquiry for a week, and invite the
  assistance of the College of Surgeons and other highly scientific bodies to
  aid in the solution of this terrible calamity.</p>

  <p>"Nothing will be done, and nothing will ever be discovered," Martin said
  to Raybould as the two entered the Winter Garden together. "It seems strange
  to think that so lovely a place as this should be connected with so loathsome
  a tragedy."</p>

  <p>Raybould said nothing. He stood looking upwards watching the play of the
  light filtering through the roof where the spot of paint had been washed off,
  and noting how the spot disappeared with the passing of the fleecy clouds.
  Just for a moment the white spot was almost blinding on the floor, then it
  vanished as quickly as it had come. In a mechanical way, Raybould proceeded
  to pick a handful of the choicer ferns. His wife was very fond of ferns, he
  explained to Dr. Martin, and some of the fronds would be quite new to her. As
  he said this he stood in the centre of the garden holding up the handful of
  graceful foliage, so that the sun might shine upon it.</p>

  <p>"Are they not lovely," he said "Don't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Raybould broke off, suddenly dazed and confused, for quick as a flash the
  great, green, feathery mass vanished, and but a few dried, blackened, stalks
  remained in Raybould's fingers.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he cried. "What devil's work is this? Come out of this,
  Martin&mdash;I don't feel safe here."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">Raybould stood with his hands pressed upon the table and
  glaring at Manfred Merides opposite him. It was strange that both men should
  look as if they had been through come terribly trying crisis. For some time
  neither spoke. They seemed to avoid one another's eyes as if perchance they
  were sharing some guilty secret between them. It was Merides who spoke at
  length.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not come before?" he asked. "It is five days since I wrote
  you a letter imploring you to come and see me, and yet you took no notice
  whatever. Why not?"</p>

  <p>There was a curious hesitation about Raybould. He might have been on the
  verge of a confession by the way in which he averted his eyes from his
  companion. He could see that Merides was haggard and grey; the Greek did not
  fail to note how pinched and worn Raybould's features were.</p>

  <p>'"We will come to that presently," Raybould said at length. "I stayed away
  because I was afraid. A fortnight has elapsed since the tragedy of the Winter
  Garden, and we are no nearer to the solution of the mystery than we were at
  the beginning. You have had the advantage of consulting some of the greatest
  scientists of the day&mdash;men whose opinion carried weight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Scientists," Merides sneered. "Dolts, idiots, fools, they worry me with
  their jargon, they make calculations, and yet they tell me nothing that is
  material. I tell you the thing maddens me. I wake in the night, dripping from
  head to foot. I am giving way to a habit which I have never fallen into
  before. There is only one consolation, and it is there."</p>

  <p>Merides pointed with a shaking hand to the sideboard on which stood a
  half-empty brandy bottle.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is Fate," he said. "Perhaps it is a judgment upon us for the
  way we served you."</p>

  <p>"A conscience," Raybould laughed, bitterly. "Another Daniel come to
  judgment. It is good to know that you realise how shabbily you treated me.
  But that is not why you asked me to come and see you. You have some proposal
  to make to me."</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Merides admitted. "The more I think of it, the more sure am I
  that it is a judgment. I am afraid to move. I am afraid to go into the Winter
  Garden where my brother perished so horribly. I look in there sometimes. I
  pause on the doorstep, and yet I dare not go inside. Mind you, I am no
  coward&mdash;ask any man in the City and he will tell you the same thing.
  Only yesterday I stood there and saw that accursed white spot dancing on the
  floor&mdash;the same white spot that you told me of in the evening of the day
  on which my brother died."</p>

  <p>Raybould looked up with some show of interest. There was just a dash of
  colour on his pale, pinched face.</p>

  <p>"So you noticed that," he said. "Strange that you should have seen it so
  recently. When the thing comes to be explained, that dreaded spot will be
  found to be at the bottom of everything."</p>

  <p>"I believe you," Merides said. "I believe you have found it out. If you
  will name your price&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The price has already been named for me," Raybould interrupted. "Give me
  back the child of my brain, and I will ask no more. But you are to put it in
  writing, or I do not trust you. I would not trust you though you mean every
  word you say for the moment. Take your pen and paper and reassign to me my
  patent."</p>

  <p>With trembling hands, Merides dashed off some sort of a document, which
  apparently satisfied Raybould, for he nodded curtly as he put it in his
  pocket. Merides turned to him with an eagerness that was almost childish.</p>

  <p>"Now, come along," he said. "Come and show me at once how the thing was
  done. Mind you, I am not going to be satisfied with mere explanations&mdash;I
  want a practical demonstration. I shall know no peace till I have seen
  it."</p>

  <p>By way of reply Raybould opened the window and looked out. A long,
  trailing cloud was passing lazily over the sun. With his watch in his hand,
  the scientist seemed to be making some calculation.</p>

  <p>"You are safe for at least five minutes," he said, "probably more, but I
  see you are mystified. Still, there is no danger so long as yonder cloud
  obscures the sun. Now come along."</p>

  <p>Merides seemed to accept the assurance, for he followed Raybould without
  further expostulation. There was nothing in the dim beauty of the Winter
  Garden to indicate the scene of an appalling tragedy. The graceful ferns
  twined upwards round the pillars, the subdued light filtered through on to
  the feathery fronds and trailing sprays. Raybould's quick eye noted a patch
  of brown stain near the centre of the tiled floor.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he asked. "It certainly was not here on the last occasion
  that I visited the place."</p>

  <p>Merides shuddered from head to foot. He swayed like a man who suffers from
  some physical sickness.</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten that," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"It was my brother's dog. He used to sit here at Peter's feet. We could
  not keep him out after his master died. It was the fourth day after the
  tragedy that one of the servants heard the dog suddenly cry out and whine as
  if in pain. A few minutes later and the footman came in to find that there
  was no dog at all&mdash;nothing but a calcined bone or two and a tuft of
  singed hair. As the master had died so the poor dog had perished. It is
  horrors like these that take all the life and soul out of a man. I would give
  half my fortune to know how these things can be avoided in the future."</p>

  <p>Raybould made no reply, he was evidently impressed by Merides' latest
  story, for his hand was shaking, and he looked up furtively from time to time
  as if foreseeing some danger in the dome overhead. Then again he consulted
  his watch and proceeded to measure out a circle in the centre of the floor
  with the aid of a foot rule. Around this circle he drew a thick, black mark
  with a carpenter's pencil. Merides watched with the most intense
  interest.</p>

  <p>"What is that for?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That is the danger zone," Raybould explained. "Inside there is death,
  hideous, and instantaneous, outside you are as safe as if you were in your
  bedroom. But perhaps I had better make the circle a little larger in case of
  accidents. There, I think that is all right. Now I we have only to wait for
  the Sunshine. When the sun comes everything will be cleared before you."</p>

  <p>Gradually and slowly the long trailing clouds began to slide over the face
  of the sun until the brilliant light burst out suddenly and the great glass
  dome changed from a dull pink to a vivid yellow. With the last vestige of
  disappearing cloud there appeared at the feet of the two watchers a great
  dancing white spot some ten inches in diameter which flickered and trembled
  on the tiled floor. It seemed as if the scientist had chained the spot there,
  for it did not move outside the black circle. Merides fairly clung to
  Raybould in his excitement and terror.</p>

  <p>"I have seen that spot often," he whispered. "I mean often during the last
  two or three days, but never before my brother's death. Is it dangerous in
  itself or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is death," Raybould said, "yet so long as you stand even a hair's
  breadth outside that circle there is no danger whatever. In these
  circumstances, the white spot is like a cobra behind a glass case. See
  here."</p>

  <p>Raybould took up an old newspaper from a table hard by and folded it into
  a square. Very cautiously he advanced the sheet in the direction of the
  glaring white, there was a little sobing puff, a pale circle of flame and the
  paper was no more. Just three flakes of white ash rose towards the dome, a
  second later and the white spot had vanished from the charmed circle.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Merides almost screamed. "What does it mean? And why has it
  vanished in that mysterious manner?"</p>

  <p>By the way of reply. Raybould pointed upwards to the dome which had
  changed colour once more, and was now a pallid pink hue.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would have guessed," he said. "The sun has vanished for a
  moment, therefore it is impossible to pursue our experiment until this cloud
  has passed away. Meanwhile, I shall be glad if you will procure me a block of
  wood&mdash;I mean a good-sized log, such as one uses in old-fashioned
  fireplaces. Do you think you could get one for me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Merides replied. His teeth were chattering, he was breathing
  hard with excitement. "There are one or two large logs in the hall fireplace.
  I will get one."</p>

  <p>The log was procured at length and carefully laid by Raybould in the
  centre of the circle. He watched it closely until the sun flashed out again
  and the white disc once more danced and quivered within the prosaic ring of
  blacklead on the floor. Then he gripped Merides arm and pointed to the log of
  wood. As the white, dazzling light struck it, the Winter Garden was full of
  the smell of charcoal, the great log seemed to split and fly asunder, almost
  in the twinkling of an eye it was no more than a heap of powder.</p>

  <p>"There you have it," Raybould said. He was quite himself by this time,
  calm and self-possessed. "There you have the whole thing in a nutshell. As
  you saw for yourself, that heap of black powder was a minute ago a sound
  honest English oak log, fourteen inches in diameter by eighteen inches long.
  It comes under the direct influence of the white spot, and in less than it
  takes to tell, it is reduced to nothingness. That is how your brother died,
  by sheer misfortune his seat was placed where the white spot could fall upon
  him&mdash;he was touched by the devilish thing, and his soul was shrivelled
  out of his body. Precisely the same thing happened in the case of the dog.
  After seeing how that log was wiped out of existence, you can understand not
  only the magnitude of the tragedy, but how it came about. You see how simple
  it all is."</p>

  <p>"But I do not see how simple it all is!" Merides protested. "The effect of
  the thing is before me. As to the cause I know nothing. I told you a
  fortnight ago that this Winter Garden has been built for nearly three years.
  During the whole time there was no suggestion of tragedy, that white spot was
  never once seen. We have had days of sunshine&mdash;many, many of them
  without bringing a curse like this. You say it is necessary that there should
  be sunshine to bring about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and powerful sunshine at that," Raybould interrupted. "You have
  just reminded me of how you described the building of this garden. Let me
  recall to your recollection my query to your brother as to how you get the
  soft, subdued light which is so essential to delicate fern-life. You will
  remember his telling me that the whole place was painted outside. Do you mind
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Merides said. "But I fail to see what that has to do with it. A
  coat or two of paint could make no difference."</p>

  <p>"It makes all the difference in the world," Raybould went on. "If there
  had been more paint there would have been no tragedy, and I should have been
  the poorer by an invention that means a fortune to me. Cast your mind back
  again to that fateful interview. When your brother told me the means by which
  you obtained the subdued light, you reminded him that part of the dome wanted
  re-painting. He demurred to your suggestion on the ground of expense. I
  presume he was a man who never wasted a penny where a halfpenny would
  do."</p>

  <p>"He was very economical," Merides muttered.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. He would rather have risked a score or two of ferns than spend
  a pound or two necessary to repair the damage to the dome, probably caused by
  frost and rain. If you will wait a moment I will show you exactly what I
  mean. Now is the time."</p>

  <p>Once more the sun crept behind the trailing clouds so that it was possible
  to look upwards to the dome from whence the paint had been worn by time and
  stress of weather. The disc was perfectly round and exactly in the centre of
  the dome. It was possible, by looking upward, to see the trailing cloud
  across the sun.</p>

  <p>"Now fix your eye well upon that," Raybould said, "for there is the cause
  of all the mischief. Three pennyworth of paint dabbed on that disc would make
  everything as safe as it was before. So long as the sun does not shine there
  is no peril. But gradually the elements have rubbed that disc smooth and
  clear, so that it forms the eye of a gigantic lens. Don't you see now that
  this black circle here is the focus of one of the strongest burning glasses
  in the world. In other words, the catastrophe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see, I see," Merides cried. "Everything is clear at last. In the dome
  is the concave tank of water which is forced up there to find its way down by
  gravitation to the left hand side of the Garden, and thus feed the pillars
  clinging to the right."</p>

  <p>"That is it," Raybould said. "You have up there a huge lens some six feet
  in diameter and three feet thick. That is a lens about five times the size of
  any one used in modern telescopes. When you come to think of it a lens of
  half an inch diameter is big enough to light a man's pipe. What, then, would
  be the effect of a huge cylinder like the one in the dome? By some means or
  another the paint had worn away from the summit, and there you have your
  focus to concentrate the burning rays on the floor. Mind you, this could only
  happen during certain times in the summer when the sun is high and powerful.
  A month sooner or later and the angle of the sun would be different, and
  therefore, would only cast itself sideways on the big lens, and,
  consequently, would be harmless. It is a good thing, perhaps, that I hit upon
  this solution, for a few days later it would have been impossible to have put
  my theory to the test, and gradually the catastrophe would have been
  forgotten. Even now, so long as you keep the dome properly painted, no danger
  can arise. Still, in my case, I should have that deadly water tank removed
  altogether. And now sir, it seems to me that I have earned my reward. If you
  think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Raybould stepped back suddenly, for the sun had flashed out again, and he
  was standing unthinkingly within the blacklead circle. He shuddered as he
  looked upwards and remembered how near he had been to death himself on the
  day when he had gathered those few ferns. He turned to Merides, but the
  latter had disappeared. The Greek came back a moment later carrying a rifle
  in his hands. His lips were compressed and his eyes determined. Pointing the
  gun upwards, he pressed the trigger. There was a loud report following a
  blinding flash, and then the clattering smash of falling glass followed by a
  deluge of water.</p>

  <p>"It was the best way," Merides said, "the only way to get rid of that
  white spot."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY A.P. BALL</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US edition), Jul 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">HAD Gresson been an imaginative man he would, perhaps, have
  pondered over the mutability of human affairs and tne decree of Fate which
  kept him hiding in a conservatory at the very moment when he had expected to
  play billiards in his favorite public-house. It is on record somewhere that
  the accidental swallowing of a grape seed changed the destiny of the world,
  and thus, in a smaller way, the forgetfulness of an attractive housemaid
  changed the life current of Mr. Gresson, and ended his existence in an
  unexpected and most startling manner. Whether the gods of Chance are
  novelists in embryo or not, it is certain they are remarkably good plotters,
  hence the sudden demise of George Gresson in a manner which would have done
  credit to the most brilliant writer of melodrama, living or dead.</p>

  <p>The story is too good to be lost. It was the housemaid's fault, of course.
  She ought to have told Gresson that her master, Vivian Laycock, had suddenly
  changed his plans and had decided to dispose of his works of art without
  delay. If a master in the predatory art cannot rely upon his information, his
  best-laid schemes are apt to go astray. For a long time past, Gresson had
  made up his mind to possess himself of Vivian Laycock's matchless collection
  of snuff-boxes, and as a precautionary measure he had made the acquaintance
  of one of Mr. Laycock's housemaids, in whose heart he had inspired a tender
  passion mainly by boasting about his little place at Hendon and how happy
  those two were going to be later on. Therefore he was considerably upset and
  annoyed to find, quite at the eleventh hour, that Mr. Laycock had arranged
  for the following morning for his treasure to be fetched away and deposited
  in the interim for safe custody with the famous firm of auctioneers who were
  to dispose of the articles.</p>

  <p>To think with Gresson was to act. This important conversation had taken
  place down the lane by the side of the rose-garden, and within ten minutes of
  that time the housemaid had retired to dream of the little house at Hendon
  and George Gresson was more or less safe in the conservatory. A mimosa bush
  tickled his nose and he was more or less distressed by the overpowering scent
  of the tuberoses. Still, on the whole, these were merely minor vexations, and
  he began to see his way to a successful expedition.</p>

  <p>It was, perhaps, unfortunate for Gresson that Mr. Laycock had been in the
  rose-garden attending to a convalescent flower of distinguished parentage and
  had overheard the whole conversation. He jumped to a natural and logical
  conclusion, and smiled grimly to himself as he picked a green fly off one of
  the salmon-pink leaves.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, he was sorely in need of some mental relaxation.
  People envied Vivian Laycock his beautiful house, his magnificent gardens and
  his priceless collection of art treasures. But the master of it all would
  have cheerfully changed places with any of these envious ones. For Laycock
  went in constant fear of his life. There was always the chance that he would
  be found some morning with a knife through his back, and become another
  victim in the long list of mysteries which the police had never solved. It
  matters nothing for the purpose of the story what Laycock was afraid of. We
  will assume, if you like, that the man had a past. For years he had been
  pursued by a relentless enemy whom he had never seen. The pursuit had begun a
  decade or more before on another continent. Laycock had managed to get away;
  but he knew that, sooner or later, his pursuer would run him down. And the
  strange part of the whole affair was that he had never seen the man who
  would, some time or another, wreak this vengeance upon him. There were
  moments when he almost forgot the whole matter. There were other times when
  they came back to him with vivid force. And now the mysterious punishment was
  upon him,&mdash;the man who meant to take his life was in London; he had
  written to Laycock; he would call upon his victim that evening before
  midnight.</p>

  <p>It sounded absurdly like a chapter from some wild romance; but there the
  letter was, and the writer meant every word he had penned. Laycock might have
  placed the matter in the hands of the police, but he knew that, had he done
  so, the enemy would never appear&mdash;he would be warned in time, and then
  the vengeance would fall in some other, unexpected, direction. Besides, the
  police would probably only have laughed at the story. In any case they could
  have done no more than bind the offender over to keep the peace, which would
  have been tantamount to giving him a free hand to carry out his intentions in
  his own good time and pleasure. He was coming there that night, either to
  take Laycock's life, or lose his own. Therefore the odds were all in favor of
  the stranger: if Laycock had the best of the encounter, he would find it
  exceedingly difficult, not to say impossible, to convince the authorities
  that he had acted only in self-defence. And, besides, in that case, the whole
  disgraceful story would have to be told.</p>

  <p>From this it will be seen that Laycock was between the devil and the deep
  sea when he stood in the rose-garden listening to the piquant little
  conversation on the other side of the fence. Vaguely he began to see that
  here was a gift from the god of Chance, and that possibly there was a way out
  of it for him after all. He was more or less amused. He was more or less
  looking forward to a dramatic encounter with George Gresson later on. He
  marked the intruder down in the conservatory. Then he retired to the library
  and, under the influence of a cigar and a whisky-and-soda, began to elaborate
  his plans.</p>

  <p>It was just before eleven when he retired, somewhat noisily, to bed. Five
  minutes later he crept down to the library again and took his seat in an
  arm-chair by the side of the fireplace, where he could control the electric
  switch. Ten minutes later Gresson came quietly into the room, walking like a
  cat in the dark and making his way quite coolly in the direction of a glass
  case of snuff-boxes which stood on the other side of the fireplace. A moment
  later the switch clicked, the room was flooded with light and the trigger of
  the revolver in Laycock's hand clicked also. It was a persuasive kind of
  sound and brought the burglar up all standing.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gresson, I think," Laycock said. "To be more exact, Mr. George
  Gresson. Glad to see you. Sit down."</p>

  <p><a id="pic8"

    <img src="1300971h-images/AMaskedBattery1.jpg"
         title="'Mr. Gresson, I think' Laycock said.">
  </div><br>

  <p>George Gresson sat down accordingly. It was not for him to force the
  conversation; it was his part to listen politely.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of you," Laycock went on.</p>

  <p>"Only lately, of course&mdash;in fact, I happened to overhear your
  conversation with my housemaid. You are the class of man that poisons life
  for art collectors like myself; we have always to take you into
  consideration. Of course you know what is going to happen."</p>

  <p>Gresson nodded his head and looked longingly in the direction of the
  w:hisky-and-soda. His lips were parched, his throat was peculiarly dry.</p>

  <p>"Help yourself," Laycock went on. "Now, you know perfectly well that if I
  hand you over to the police, you will get at least five years. I don't mind
  telling you that in ordinary circumstances I shouldn't hesitate for a moment.
  But you are in luck to-night, Mr. Gresson. Oh, you may smile, but, in your
  own brilliant metaphor, you never know your luck. I mean it is in your hands
  to walk away from here in an hour's time, a free man with a hundred pounds in
  your pocket. I am sure you will think that is far better than having the
  trouble of disposing of my snuff-boxes, with the chance of being picked up by
  the police at any moment. I should say by the look of you that you are an
  educated man."</p>

  <p>"That is so," Gresson said quietly.</p>

  <p>"And a man of the world, too. Now, suppose I ask you to pass yourself off
  as me for an hour. I am expecting to call at any moment an individual who is
  personally an entire stranger to me. He knows nothing about my life or my
  friends; he has never seen me. He is by way of being a blackmailer of sorts.
  Now, suppose you stay here and personate me, keeping the man as long as you
  can, while I run over to his lodgings in my motor and obtain possession of
  certain incriminating papers of mine which he has. I think I can trust you to
  remain here, because all my works of art are already secure in the safe in my
  bedroom. If you don't believe me, you have only to look at that glass case
  behind; and I take it that even you would be more than an hour getting into
  my safe. Now, if you will do this little service for me, I shall take great
  pleasure in handing you a hundred pounds when I come back."</p>

  <p>Gresson's eyes began to glisten. Here was an adventure after his own
  heart. From a professional point of view he was disappointed; even from a
  business outlook the program was more or less of a failure. But, on the other
  hand, he had saved himself from what he would have termed a "five years'
  stretch," and the fee was out of all proportion to the services rendered. He
  helped himself engagingly to a whisky-and-soda and proclaimed that he was
  game.</p>

  <p>"Better do the thing thoroughly while you are about it," he suggested. "I
  have no doubt I shall be able to draw the feather over the eyes of your
  friend. You see, I was in a pretty good position at one time, and you can see
  for yourself that there is nothing in my appearance which is the least
  objectionable. If you could rig me out in a dress-suit of yours, I think I
  could act my part all the better. It will be agreeable to sit here and feel
  that I am master of this place, if only for an hour."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Laycock agreed. "Come with me as far as my bedroom... There,
  upon my word, you look like a gentleman now. All you have to do is to throw
  dust in the eyes of the man who is coming and treat him as you like. Only
  keep him here for an hour, and the money is yours."</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry about that," Gresson said quietly.</p>

  <p>Left to himself, Gresson glanced complacently around and helped himself
  liberally to another drink. He was enjoying himself by this time. The
  dress-clothes were by no means a bad fit, the single diamond in his glossy
  shirt-front sparkled alluringly. It was easy to imagine himself the master of
  all this wealth and luxury, for Gresson had a lively imagination, and he
  looked forward to playing his part with satisfaction both to himself and his
  employer.</p>

  <p>It was about half an hour before Gresson was aroused by the ripple of an
  electric bell somewhere in the distance. He came rightly enough to the
  conclusion that here was the mysterious stranger, waiting on the doorstep for
  admission. He crossed the hall leisurely and threw back the big door. A tall,
  dark man with a beard and mustache, his eyes hidden behind a pair of
  eye-glasses, lifted a Trilby hat politely. His face was thin and drawn and
  there was a certain nervousness in his manner which was not lost upon
  Gresson. Moreover, the new-comer evidently was a foreigner, although his
  English was correct enough; Gresson mentally put him down as an American.</p>

  <p>"You got my letter, sir?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Go on," Gresson said in non-committal fashion. "I may say that you were
  expected. Won't you come in?"</p>

  <p>The stranger's eyes gleamed behind his glasses.</p>

  <p>"You are a very bold man," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Think so?" Gresson asked complacently.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I am. In a way I have been expecting you. Come in."</p>

  <p>The stranger appeared about to speak, then suddenly changed his mind. With
  an air of almost indifference he followed Gresson into the library. He took
  the proffered seat, but curtly declined anything in the way of refreshment.
  At the mere suggestion, his lips tightened until they were a thin, straight
  thread under his closely clipped mustache. Despite the man's frailness and
  his apparent lack of physical qualities, Gresson recognized that he had all
  the makings of a first-class antagonist; the burglar was a judge in such
  matters, and, consequently, he was not so complacent as a little time before;
  he would have felt more cheerful and reliant had the stranger partaken of the
  suggested whisky-and-soda. This was the kind of fanatic who usually murders
  his victim first and blows out his own brains afterward. Still, Gresson
  himself was not without a weapon, for before answering the bell he had taken
  up Laycock's discarded revolver and slipped it into the pocket of the
  dress-jacket he was wearing.</p>

  <p>"Sorry you won't help yourself," he said. "And now, if you don't mind,
  we'll get to business."</p>

  <p>"I came here for no other purpose," the stranger said, calmly enough. "We
  have never met before, but you know me."</p>

  <p>Gresson nodded his head gravely. Obviously it was his cue to wait for the
  other man to give him a lead.</p>

  <p>"Twelve years ago you did me and mine an irreparable wrong," the stranger
  went on.</p>

  <p>"You did that wrong in cold blood; you calculated the chances to a nicety.
  But for a little act on your part you would be a poor man to-day; you would
  not be leading a life of luxury like this. But your scheme, to a certain
  extent, like most other schemes, was not crowned with complete success. So
  far as the material side is concerned, you were successful enough. But there
  were three people you wanted to get rid of, three people you schemed to get
  out of the way; but two of them lived&mdash;lived long enough to find you
  out. The second man died soon after, but not before he had told the
  third&mdash;myself&mdash; what had happened. It was a story that moved me
  from the first; the more I dwelt upon it, the more did the desire to be even
  with you grow upon me. We led a lonely life out yonder, as you know, and I
  have had little else to think about. The remembrance of your treachery was
  with me day and night until it became a monomania. I swore to myself that if
  ever I had luck enough, or made money enough, to take a year's holiday in
  England, I would come and track you down. I have all the evidence of your
  crime by me, most of it in your own handwriting."</p>

  <p>The speaker paused for a moment and coughed; it was a deep, distressing
  cough, that told of lung trouble behind it. Gresson had his hand on the
  revolver in his pocket. He checked a tendency to whistle; he was feeling
  somewhat annoyed with Laycock. What right, he wondered, had the master of
  this house to put on airs and treat like a dog men who were, at least, as
  honest as himself? Gresson might be a burglar, but he had never knowingly
  wronged any one except in the way of business, and his victims could well
  afford to sustain their losses. Still, Gresson had promised to go through
  with this interview, and he meant to see the play out to the finish. Just for
  the moment he had almost forgotten that he was acting the part of substitute
  to Laycock.</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I want you to do nothing," the stranger replied. "It is too late to talk
  now. The time has come for action. Even if I thought your repentance was deep
  and sincere, I should still pursue the same course. But to allow things to go
  on as they are now&mdash;never. You appear to be rich and prosperous. I am a
  poor man, with barely enough money to pay my passage back home again.
  Besides, I am naturally not of a robust nature; I have lived too fast, and I
  have not many months before me. But, at any rate, when my time does come, it
  will be a satisfaction to me to know that you are out of the way. Now you
  know what I mean."</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a threat," Gresson suggested.</p>

  <p>"A threat! Aye, it is something more than that. After all the warnings you
  have had during these years, you must have learned your lesson very badly if
  you think that one of my family would stop at threats. But I am going to give
  you the chance. I could have come here without warning. I could have taken
  your life with none any the wiser. But I prefer to do the thing openly.
  Physically you are quite a match for me."</p>

  <p>"I should think I was," Gresson said thoughtfully. "Why, Lord love the
  man, I could smother you!"</p>

  <p>The stranger's eyes gleamed again.</p>

  <p>"That is how I expected you to speak," he said. "You are as cool and hard
  and callous as you ever were, just as flippant and artificial. If there had
  remained a gleam of pity in my heart, it would be extinguished now. But we
  are wasting time."</p>

  <p>Gresson glanced uneasily at the clock. Things were progressing a little
  faster than he had expected, and he had promised to detain the stranger for
  at least an hour. It was only fair to Laycock that he should do so. Yet here
  was this bloodthirsty intruder forcing matters along at a breakneck pace, and
  altogether refusing to play the game in a neat and artistic manner. It would
  be an easy matter, Gresson thought, to take the revolver from his pocket and
  drive the stranger off the premises with a threat of an ounce or so of lead
  in his brain if he did not comply forthwith.</p>

  <p>"What's your hurry!" he said. "Do you suppose there is only one side to
  the business? Are you not going to listen to anything that I have got to say?
  Come, be fair."</p>

  <p>A strange laugh broke from the intruder's hps. His face was pale and
  ghastly now. But there was no fear or hesitation in his eyes. He looked round
  the room with a sudden contempt for all its luxury and artistic splendor.</p>

  <p>"What can you have to say?" he asked. "What possible point can you adduce
  in your own favor. Why, of all the poisonous scoundrels who ever lived, of
  all the cold-blooded rascals ever heard of, you are the worst! And yet you
  sit quietly there asking me to argue the point. I have argued it with myself,
  and I have found you guilty. And now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What a beggar it is to talk!" Gresson said thoughtlessly. He was
  forgetting his part for the moment. "You remind me of a dreary play I once
  saw across the water. I think it was called 'The Stranger.' He was the most
  garrulous beggar I ever saw on the stage, and, upon my word, you remind me of
  him. If it is a matter of money, you have only to say the word"</p>

  <p>"Money!" the stranger cried passionately.</p>

  <p>"Do you think money will do everything? Is it omnipotent?"</p>

  <p>"In a general way, yes," Gresson said sapiently. "At least, I find it so.
  Now, my dear man"</p>

  <p>But the stranger was not listening. He had risen to his feet excitedly. He
  was trembling and shaking from head to foot, like a cat about to spring on a
  bird. Before Gresson could realize what had happened, the man had cleared the
  intervening space and was upon him. He pinned Laycock's understudy down in
  the springy depths of his arm-chair. He had him by the throat with a grip
  that could have been inspired only by hatred or malice or both commingled. A
  long knife gleamed in his hand. Gresson could see the red rims of his eyes as
  he bent forward with a knife drawn back as if to strike a final and deadly
  blow.</p>

  <p>"Here, steady on!" Gresson expostulated. "If you are not careful, you will
  be doing&mdash;"</p>

  <p><a id="pic9"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300971h-images/AMaskedBattery2.jpg"
         title="'Here, steady on!' Gresson expostulated.">
  </div><br>

  <p>But it was too late. The knife came down in a swerving glittering circle
  right over the glossy shirt which covered Gresson's heart. At the same time
  Gresson drew his revolver and fired point-blank into the face of his mad
  antagonist.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Vivian Laycock came back slowly and thoughtfully from Blackheath. He was
  driving his car himself. He had many things to dispose of in his mind before
  he reached his residence. His mission had not been altogether unsuccessful,
  for in his breast-pocket was the bundle of papers of which he had been in
  search.</p>

  <p>He put the car away, congratulating himself upon the fact that it had been
  a dry night and that there was not much to be done to the big automobile in
  the way of removing such dust and stains as would have given evidence that
  the car had been on the road. The garage was some distance from the house and
  Laycock's chauffeur was in London on a brief holiday. At the end of half an
  hour not even the astutest detective would have noticed that the motor had
  been out of its stable. Laycock removed his leather suit and hung it
  carefully in its usual place.</p>

  <p>He was quite calm and collected now; it seemed his plans were moving
  smoothly. Then he went back to the house and let himself quietly in with his
  latch-key. He did not proceed directly to the library. On the contrary, after
  he had fastened the front door, he turned to the dining-room. Here he helped
  himself liberally to brandy.</p>

  <p>"I need it," he muttered. "I am afraid my nerves are not quite what I
  thought they were. I wonder what I shall see when I get to the library? It is
  very quiet in there."</p>

  <p>The brandy had steadied him, for Laycock was an abstemious man, so that
  the generous spirit lost no time in getting to work. Yet, as he stood there
  he could hear the beating of his own heart; he could feel the sharp, quick
  flutter of his pulses. And it was still, too, deadly, awfully still, so that
  the scratching of a mouse behind one of the panels sounded like a strident
  voice of accusation shouting from the house-top.</p><br>

  <p><a id="pic10"
     name="pic10"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300971h-images/AMaskedBattery3.jpg"
         title="He could hear the beating of his own heart.">
  </div><br>

  <p>It seemed to Laycock that he could stand it no longer, though at the same
  time he was afraid to move. Tiny beads of perspiration stood out on his
  forehead. With an effort he raised one foot, and put it down on the parquet
  floor a yard nearer the library door. He had control of himself now. He
  pushed the door open and strode into the room.</p>

  <p>Small wonder that the place was deadly still. For Gresson lay back in his
  arm-chair, his limbs relaxed, his head grotesquely and awfully sideways. Over
  his heart a great slash in the glossy shirt-front, from which a thin, beady
  stream of dark red was flowing. It needed no critical glance to see that the
  burglar was dead.</p>

  <p>Stretched at his feet across the hearth-rug the stranger lay, with his
  head in the fireplace. Close by him was a revolver, one chamber only of which
  was discharged. There was a small blue scar on his forehead through which the
  bullet had entered.</p>

  <p>For full five minutes Laycock stood contemplating the scene, then he
  glanced fearfully around him. Something like this he had expected. The only
  fact that he noticed now was the appalling success of his scheme. That the
  burglar would perish in his place he had expected; but that the murderer, who
  had crossed a whole continent to do this thing, should have perished also was
  to jump from the realm of possibility into romance. The man had come all
  these miles to do this deed! In ordinary circumstances he would have gone
  away, feeling that at length vengeance was satisfied and desirous only of
  putting an ocean between himself and possible pursuit. If only the burglar
  had died, then Laycock would have felt himself secure for the future. But
  that both of them should be wiped out of existence was a piece of good
  fortune on which he had not counted for a moment.</p>

  <p>He could see now that he had gone a little too far, that he had been just
  a little too calculating and elaborate. What he needed was an explanation so
  simple that he could have given it without change or variation, even if he
  had been roused in the night to do so. Now there was work before him. He
  regretted from the bottom of his heart that he had gone so far as to fall in
  with Gresson's suggestion that the latter should wear one of his own
  dress-suits. Fortunately, the shirt Gresson was wearing was a new one and
  unmarked. The shot which had slain the stranger had been fired by Laycock's
  own revolver; but that, again, was a detail capable of ready explanation.</p>

  <p>It was not an easy matter to remove Gresson's dress-clothes and substitute
  his own, but it was accomplished at length without any one in that silent,
  slumbering household being any the wiser. Laycock left the coat and waistcoat
  unfastened so that the blow from the knife should look quite natural. Once
  the repulsive work was done, he stepped back to contemplate the picture with
  the eye of an artist who has at last posed his models to his perfect
  satisfaction. Then he started from the room, shouting at the top of his voice
  and thundering upon the bronze gong which stood in the hall. He had discarded
  his own clothes and was in his pajamas and a dressing-gown. The whole place
  re-echoed to the din. The clang of it sounded horrible in Laycock's own ears.
  He was profoundly thankful when the butler and a footman presently appeared,
  followed in the background by a knot of timid women-servants.</p>

  <p>"I thought I should never rouse you," Laycock said. "One of you go round
  to the stables and wake up the coachman. I came down-stairs just now, roused
  by the sound of a shot and found that two burglars were in the library.
  Possibly they had come together, possibly they were strangers to each other
  and had both arranged to raid the house the same night. At any rate, they
  seem to have come in conflict. As far as I can see, they are both dead."</p>

  <p>It was all coolly and naturally done. The whole house was a blaze of light
  now. A little while later and one of the grooms hurried off for the police.
  An inspector arrived presently and listened gravely to all Laycock had to
  say.</p>

  <p>"Bit of a startler for you, sir," the inspector said respectfully. "But
  perhaps I had better go into the library and examine things for myself. If
  you don't care to come along with me, sir"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Laycock asked. "I have already seen the horrors for myself. I
  am not afraid."</p>

  <p>The inspector proceeded to take notes coolly enough. He naturally desired
  to know how these intruders had got into the house. But the open door of the
  conservatory explained that. Then the inspector bent down over the body of
  the man lying in the arm-chair, and a gleam of recognition came into his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I know him, at any rate, sir," he said. "Why, it is George Gresson! Of
  all the artful burglars in London, he is about the sharpest of the lot. We
  have been trying to catch him for years without success. But, you see, he was
  a man of education, and all the time he has been at the game we have never
  been able to lay him by the heels more than once."</p>

  <p>"Do you know the other man?" Laycock asked.</p>

  <p>The inspector shook his head. He had not the least idea who the other man
  was. Assuredly he had never seen him before; neither had he any theory to
  advance.</p>

  <p>"We shall never clear it up, sir," the inspector said. "You mark my words
  if we do. There are certain crimes which always remain mysteries, and you
  will see that this will be one of them."</p>

  <p>Laycock was of the same opinion.</p>

  <p>The collector of curios never explained why he changed his mind about the
  sale of his snuff-boxes, and why they still adorn his beautiful house at Lee.
  But, then, Laycock is a man of few words, and the reticent habit grows on him
  as he gets older.</p><br>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Star</i>, New Zealand, 24 Oct 1908</h3><br>

  <p class="first">KITTY DAVENTRY turned away with a flush of annoyance on her
  pretty face. There were more reasons than one for her anger, perhaps the
  chief of them being the knowledge that the man who was looking so steadfastly
  at her was merely a gamekeeper. It was true that he was a very gentlemanly
  gamekeeper. His manners were excellent, and his English left nothing to be
  desired. In addition to all this, the man was well set-up and distinguished
  looking, though, according to the strict letter of the law, he might not have
  have been called handsome."</p>

  <p>It so happened that this was not the first time that Kitty Daventry had
  met Philip Lancaster. On two previous occasions he had warned her that she
  was trespassing in the woods, and that her ill-timed rambles were having a
  demoralising effect on the young pheasants. Kitty had replied haughtily
  enough that hitherto she had moved in her own sweet way through all the woods
  and pastures for ten miles around, and no one had ventured to say her nay.
  Lancaster had listened politely enough. He had even ventured to insinuate
  that Miss Daventry was getting a little too old for such childish escapades
  as these, and that, so far as he could gather, she had not benefited much by
  three years at a sohool in Germany. Perhaps the girl was not altogether to
  blame, seeing that her home life was so monotonous a one? She lived quite
  alone with an old uncle who was a scholar and a recluse, and so long as Kitty
  did not worry him with any of her troubles, Mr Daventry was quite content to
  leave the girl alone. As to the rest, he knew and cared nothing about his
  neighbours and their gossip; indeed, Kitty was wont to declare that her uncle
  would have been unable to tell the names of his own servants."</p>

  <p>But here was quite an exceptional occasion. For the last four or five days
  it had rained incessantly, so that Kitty was only too glad of a chance to get
  out of the house, to mount her bicycle and skim away from home over the muddy
  roads. She had been warned once or twice on the way not to go too far afield,
  for the River Scour was coming down in flood, and the Scour at that time of
  year had an awkward habit of cutting off pedestrians from their base and
  leaving them stranded in out-of-the-way holes and corners. It was a
  treacherous, quick-rising river, and Kitty knew very well, but she was
  desperate now with the weariness and monotony of life, and she had come a
  great deal further away from home than she had intended."</p>

  <p>And now the rain was coming down again in real royal earnest. A great
  ragged bank of clouds streamed up from the west. The landscape was fairly
  blotted out by the driving deluge, and Kitty, stood, disconsolately under a
  tree, a little uncertain as to what to do next, and quite hazy as to how she
  was to get home. It was, of course, in accordance with the eternal fitness of
  things that Philip Lancaster should put in an appearance at that moment. He
  paused and doffed his cap, much as if Kitty and himself had been on a perfect
  equality. He looked almost as pleased, too."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he demanded."</p>

  <p>"Waiting for the rain to go over," Kitty said haughtily. "I had a
  side-slip and nearly wrenched the front tyre from my machine.""</p>

  <p>"But surely you must know how late it is," Lancaster replied. "It is long
  past five. Still, that is hardly the point. What I should like to know is how
  you propose to get back.""</p>

  <p>Kitty froze the speaker with a glance."</p>

  <p>"Does that really concern you?" she asked frigidly."</p>

  <p>"Well, of course it does," Lancaster went on in the same cool,
  contemptuous manner. "So far as I know there is only one way back to Langdon
  Hall, and that is by way of the road over the great Scour Bridge. It may be
  news to you, of course, but I have just heard that the road is three feet
  under water.""</p>

  <p>Kitty gave a little gasp of dismay. She had forgotten her dignity for the
  moment, nor did she doubt that Lancaster was speaking anything but the truth.
  She knew how quickly the river rose when it came down in flood, and now it
  had been raining for the last five days. Besides, she had had more than one
  warning before she had left home. Of course, it was very dreadful to find
  herself in a position where it became necessary to ask favours of Philip
  Lancaster. But so far as she could see there was no help for it. The rain was
  coming down in a steady, straight desolation, and already the faint spring
  light was beginning to fade. A little longer and a change of clothing would
  become absolutely necessary."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Lancaster asked mercilessly."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know," Kitty faltered. "I am getting horribly wet and
  cold, and there is practically nobody in the neighbourhood whom I know. If
  you could suggest any way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The last remark was made almost meekly. The was the faint suggestion of a
  smile about the corners of Lancaster's mouth. If Kitty saw it she was
  diiscretely silent on the point. Besides, she was very wet and very cold,
  and, like most women at that hour, she was longing for a cup of tea. She made
  little or no protest when Lancaster took the matter in his own hands."</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing for it," he said. "You will have to come along
  with me to my cottage. Now, what is the good of shaking your head in that
  silly way? Do you propose to spend the night under this tree? Oh, I know I am
  all alone yonder. I know it is very shocking and all that kind of thing. But
  for once in a way you will have to make the best of it. I do entirely for
  myself, but I am not quite so slipshod that I can't give you a good cup of
  tea and some bread and butter, to say nothing of a little honey of my own
  growing. A little later on I will go with you as far as the Hall, where, I am
  sure, the housekeeper, who is a great friend of mine, will put you up for the
  night. I don't think I can say any more than that. And now come along, let's
  have no more nonsense about it." "</p>

  <p>Lancaster caught up Kitty's bicycle, and to her own intense astonishment
  she found herself following obediently behind, like an amiable lamb led to
  the slaughter. She found herself presently, too, making herself entirely
  agreeable to this handsome young gamekeeper, and if the truth must be known,
  thoroughly enjoyed her adventure. She was warm and comfortable by this time,
  for a bright wood fire crackled on the old pleasant hearth. She insisted upon
  making the tea and bread and butter, and before the meal was finished it
  seemed to her that she had known Philip Lancaster all her life. Who was he?
  Who could he be? she asked herself. Surely, he must be something out of the
  common, for no gamekeeper of Kitty's acquaintance ever talked like that. She
  was quite certain that not another one had such a collection of books or a
  finer edition of the early Latin poets in the original. Lancaster flushed and
  turned the conversation as Kitty pointed to these. "</p>

  <p>"One half the world doesn't know how the other half lives," he laughed.
  "Besides, if you are destined to be poor and unfortunate, how much better it
  is to live in the country where you can have good food and pure air at a
  nominal cost. Now if you were in my position what would you rather do? Would
  you prefer to be a struggling clerk at a pound a week, or would you be a
  gamekeeper at the same money with a cottage thrown in to the bargain and two
  suits of clothes a year? But I am letting my tongue run too fast. I am
  forgetting that you are Miss Daventry, and I am merely a keeper. See the
  clouds are breaking now. Don't you think we had better run across to the Hall
  while we have the chance?""</p>

  <p>Kitty responded somewhat frigidly that perhaps the speaker was right. All
  the same, she was still puzzled and bewildered. She wondered why the old
  housekeeper at the Hall received Lancaster with such deference and respect,
  and why, in the name of goodness, should she address him as Mr Philip. Kitty
  was not without her fair share of curiosity, and before she slept that night
  she had made up her mind to solve the mystery. Neither was Mrs Hartley in the
  least reticent in gratifying the seeker after knowledge. "</p>

  <p>"Lord bless you, miss, I thought everybody knew. I don't suppose there is
  another young man in the world that is fit to compare with Master Philip."
  "</p>

  <p>"Yes, but who ie he?" Kitty persisted."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" Mrs Hartley echoed. "There, I forgot you have been away to
  school for so long. Don't you know that the late Sir James Lancaster was one
  of the greatest spendthrifts who ever lived? When he died he left the estates
  in a terrible mess, and when the heir came into possession, which was nearly
  ten years ago, when you were quite a little girl, he made a vow to pay off
  every penny before ever he slept under this roof. He let the house for a term
  of years, and he let the shooting to another party; in fact, every farthing
  he oould save towards paying off those mortgages he scraped together. Why, he
  even went so far as to become his own gamekeeper. The people who took the
  shooting were Londoners, who asked no questions, and cared nothing so long as
  they had plenty of sport. Little did they know that the handsome young keeper
  who took care of their game so well was Sir Philip Lancaster, the owner of
  the Hall. Ah, well, it is all right now, and Sir Philip is going to reap the
  reward of all his care and economy. The place has come back into his hands
  now, and it is all going to be done up in the autumn. I don't suppose there
  are a score of people outside the parish who know what I am telling you now.
  When you come here later on you will find the Hall quite a different
  place.""</p>

  <p>Kitty's face turned to a delicate pink as she listened. She was thinking
  of a good many rude speeches she had made to Sir Philip Lancaster from time
  to time in the faint hope that he had forgotten them. For a long time after
  she had been carefully tucked away in one of the principal guest-chambers she
  lay tossing about sleeplessly, wondering how she was going to make her peace
  with Sir Philip, and how he must have laughed at her every time they met.
  "</p>

  <p>"Can you ever forgive me?" she whispered as she and her host stood
  together in the sunshine after breakfast. "I am so glad you came over to see
  how I was getting on. Of course, I had no idea of the truth till Mrs Hartley
  told me last night, and I-I don't think I have ever been so ashamed of myself
  in my life before." "</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion," Lancaster smiled. "Truth to say, I have enjoyed
  our two or three interviews, and I hope a little later on, when things are
  settled down here, that you will induce your uncle to come over here and
  call. I do not want to forget that you were the first of my county neighbours
  with whom I have made acquaintance. Now let us shake hands upon and forget
  all about our past differences." "</p>

  <p>There were something like tears in Kitty's eyes as she held out her hand.
  How could she have taken this man for anything but a gentleman, she wondered?
  Then the absurd side of the situation came uppermost and she laughed
  heartily."</p>

  <p>"It was funny, wasn't it?" she whispered. And to think that I might have
  known nothing about it if I had not met you yesterday.""</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think you would," Lancaster said meaningly. I should have found
  some way to let you know. And now, we are going to be good friends, are we
  not? I see your answer in your eyes."</p><br>

     name="story9">9.&mdash;THE SWORD OF JUSTICE</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY A.P. BALL</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US edition), Oct 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">AFTER all said and done, the expectation was not quite as
  bad as the reality. But, then, it seldom is, as George Shannon told himself
  with a cynical smile. For a business man, he was gifted with a fine
  imagination. Frequently in his after-dinner leisure he had sat there weaving
  it out in his mind as a novelist knits the thread of a story.</p>

  <p>Shannon was glad to be alone. He marveled at his own self-control, he
  almost admired the way in which he was concealing his trouble. For the last
  hour or two he had been gardening, busy among his flowers, as if he knew he
  could look forward with pleasure to the realization of the floral harvest.
  Yet, even while he was bending there among the petunias, or training the
  roses over the pergola, he knew perfectly well that someone else would reap
  the full beauty of the cream and damask blossoms.</p>

  <p>It was hard lines, Shannon told himself. A sentimental man might have shed
  tears over it. It was all the more hard because he had seen this little
  paradise of his expanded in blossom, he himself had turned an arid desert
  into a galaxy of glory. He could recollect the time when the smooth lawns had
  been no more than ragged bare patches, when the house itself had been gaunt
  and stark in its white hideousness. That had been ten years ago. And now
  there was not a trimmer, neater, or more perfect garden within twenty miles
  of the city. It all would have to go. He would have to begin life over again.
  He would be lucky in the future if he had even so much as a cabbage
  patch.</p>

  <p>He had not told anybody yet: even his wife did not know. For the best part
  of an hour they had been standing on the edge of the lawn, planning out a new
  and elaborate border, and Shannon had thrown himself into the matter with a
  zest and enthusiasm which fairly astonished himself. He was glad that his
  wife did not know yet; gradually a little scheme was forming in his mind
  whereby this precious Naboth's vineyard might be retained and the enemy
  clamoring at his gates worsted.</p>

  <p>The scheme would entail the last price that man pays for anything, but,
  then, it would be for the best, and distinctly to the advantage of Mrs.
  Shannon and the children. She had been a good wife to him for twenty odd
  years. He was deeply and profoundly grateful, with the calm, tranquil
  affection of the man who knows that he has found the one woman in the world
  for him. No doubt it would be a terrible shock. But, then, Kate Shannon would
  never know the truth, and in time to come she would tell her children what
  manner of man their father had been, and how they could do no better than
  follow in his footsteps. She would have money, too. There would be no further
  anxiety as to the two boys at Harvard, and Kate could go to Germany to finish
  her education. There was grim satisfaction, too, in the idea of getting upon
  terms with Frederick Bramlay, and thus for the first time in that
  unscrupulous financier's history someone would get the best of him. Shannon
  actually smiled to himself as he pictured the scene up to the final moment
  when&mdash;</p>

  <p>Actually he stood there making up his mind to that stupendous sacrifice
  with a smile on his lips. He noticed a stiff bent of grass rising from the
  velvet lawn. He put back a trail drooping from a rebellious climbing rose and
  fastened it tenderly in its place. Next year his wife would be doing the same
  thing. The savour of life would have come back to her, and she would have her
  children to look after. There were two sets of thoughts occupying Shannon's
  mind&mdash;the one set grim and ghastly, the other tender and romantic.
  Between these two he was arriving at a firm and definite conclusion. The
  argument was crystallized hard and firm before Shannon was interrupted by the
  arrival of a friend in the person of Raymond Clausen. These two had been
  schoolfellows, they had spent the best part of their lives in the city
  together; indeed, if there was one man whom Shannon could trust, it was
  Clausen.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect to see you here," the latter said.</p>

  <p>"Probably not," Shannon smiled. "I ought to be biting my nails in the
  library, I suppose. It is a very odd thing, Raymond, but now the point has
  come, I don't seem to mind at all."</p>

  <p>"Have you told the wife?" Clausen asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, no, I haven't. I hadn't the heart to do so. When I got home
  to-night, I found Kate full of her project for making a new rose-garden. You
  will hardly believe it possible, but I have been throwing myself into the
  scheme just the same as if I had paid off my mortgage and the place belonged
  to me."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand the feeling," Clausen said sympathetically. "It is
  infernally hard upon your wife and children. I suppose you haven't said
  anything to Bramlay about it."</p>

  <p>Shannon shrugged his shoulders almost indifferently.</p>

  <p>"What is the use?" he asked. "The man has no heart and no bowels of
  compassion. Did you ever know him do a good or kindly action in his life?
  There is a man who has thrown over friend after friend directly they have
  ceased to be of use to him. He gives nothing away. He is capable of any
  rascality, so long as he contrives to keep out of reach of the law. I declare
  I can scarcely contain myself when I think of the way in which he has treated
  me. It was I who lent him the money to give him his first start in life. I
  lent him five hundred dollars of my hard savings when I never expected to see
  it again. I pinched myself to give him his opportunity. And now how does he
  treat me? When he bought that fine house of his behind that belt of elms
  yonder, four years ago, he conceived the idea of turning this place of mine
  into a lodge. It never seemed to occur to him that I had an affection for
  this home of mine which cannot be measured by mere money. I refused to sell
  the place, of course; in fact, as you know, it is not altogether mine to
  sell. And what did that scoundrel do? He induced me to leave the old firm
  which I was with for years to become his manager. As true as we are standing
  here, Clausen, that man faithfully promised me a share of the business at the
  end of three years. And now mark the sequel. He dismisses me from his employ
  under the plea that I am slovenly and incompetent. He leaves me at fifty-five
  years of age to face the world again. And why does he do this? Simply because
  he knows that I shall be unable to keep up the payments on my mortgage, and
  that the house must come into the market. It is the old story of Naboth's
  vineyard over again. Fancy this from a man who is looked up to and respected.
  And yet every word I am telling you is absolutely true."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I believe it," Clausen said. "What a pity it is that you can't think
  of some way of getting even with the scoundrel!"</p>

  <p>A peculiar smile came over Shannon's face.</p>

  <p>"I have thought of a way," he said quietly. "It is one of those queer
  ideas that come to all us of sometimes. I believe if I had not been a
  business man, I should have made a respectable poet. Let us walk up and down
  the lawn and talk it over. I wouldn't tell this to any other man but you...
  Now, suppose I am disposed to save all this, and insure the future of my wife
  and family by an act of personal sacrifice. Suppose that I know a thing or
  two about Bramlay which would damage him seriously if it became public. Oh, I
  don't mean blackmail in that sense of the word. Besides, I haven't the nerve
  to fight Bramlay openly, and possibly nobody would believe me. We'll argue,
  for instance, that there is going to be trouble over those copper mines in
  which Bramlay is interested. Mind you, it is by no means a pretty business,
  and the public have yet a good deal to learn about it. But Bramlay will come
  out of it all right, as he always does. And now let us carry the scheme a
  little further. Suppose I were to lose my nerve and take my own life, leaving
  letters behind me hinting that I was afraid of disclosures in connection with
  the Copper Syndicate, and leaving the public to believe that Bramlay was at
  the bottom of the whole thing. Oh, I could manage it easily enough. There
  would be a searching inquiry even beyond the reach of Bramlay's bribery and
  hush money, and after that, with all his wealth, he would become a marked
  man. The class of people he aspires to know would turn their backs upon him.
  What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a modern novel," Clausen said, a bit cynically. "But it
  would be a mere act of timidity and revenge. I fail to see how your wife and
  family could benefit by a course like this. Your program is not
  complete."</p>

  <p>"I am coming to that," Shannon said quietly. "We will suppose I write a
  letter not only to Bramlay, but also to Charlton, his private secretary. I go
  further still and write a letter to the same effect to you. This places the
  matter beyond Bramlay's power so far as burking investigation goes. No doubt
  Bramlay could purchase Charlton's silence, but he couldn't buy yours. After
  the thing is done and I am out of the way, you go straight to Bramlay and
  offer to sell him the letter I have written you for two hundred thousand
  dollars. Oh, you needn't smile, he would buy it fast enough. I tell you, he
  dare not face investigations. And yet, once I have put the knife to my heart
  or the pistol to my head, no power on earth could prevent an investigation if
  you read the letter I wrote you at the inquest. Do you see now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is convincing enough," Clausen replied. "And I would do it for
  you, too. There is nothing I should enjoy more than facing Bramlay with such
  a weapon in my hands. But you are talking absolute nonsense, my dear fellow,
  as you know as well as I do."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>THE hour was getting late now, but Shannon was still in his garden.
  Clausen had been gone for a considerable time, and it was something past ten
  before Shannon crossed over to a nearby office and despatched a long telegram
  to his friend. He seemed easier in his mind now. There was a smile upon his
  face. He whistled a fragment from an operatic tune. As the clock was striking
  eleven he strode out of his own gate down the now deserted road till he came
  to an imposing pair of lodges which guarded the drive leading up to the
  magnificent old house where Bramlay, the great financier, had his home.
  Shannon did not hurry himself. He strolled casually along the drive until he
  stood in front of the house. His mind was not sufficiently distracted to
  blind him to the beauty of the flower-beds and the exquisite savor of the
  roses and the smoothness of the springy lawns. The house was more or less in
  darkness, save for the study, where the electric lights burned brilliantly.
  The long French windows were open, and as Shannon crossed the lawns he saw
  the figure of the financier half buried in an armchair and surrounded by a
  mass of papers in which he appeared to be absorbed. He was in evening dress,
  a slim, spare figure with a plain square face and a prominent jaw. There was
  only one thing which Bramlay lived for, and that was the making of money. It
  was doubtful whether he appreciated all the luxury and beauty of his
  surroundings, except as living evidence that he was a rich man who could
  afford to indulge his fancies.</p>

  <p>Shannon strode into the room with the air of a man who is quite at home.
  Bramlay's hard features knitted in a frown.</p>

  <p>"This is somewhat unexpected," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," Shannon responded. "May I be permitted to sit down for a
  moment? I want to talk matters over with you. It will probably be the last
  opportunity I have."</p>

  <p>"Will you take anything?" Bramlay asked.</p>

  <p>"Presently, yes. But not until I have finished. Then you can ring your
  bell and ask one of the servants to bring me some soda-water. But we would
  better have our explanation first."</p>

  <p>"What explanation?" Bramlay demanded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am not likely to detain you long. I have no desire to stand between
  you and your money-making. If you will look at me, you will see that I am
  quite calm and collected; I am not carried away by trouble or anxiety;
  therefore, I tell you quite coolly that you are, without exception, the
  coldest and most deliberate scoundrel I ever came across in my life. When I
  came here this evening, I debated seriously in my mind as to whether I should
  kill you or hot. Sit still, man&mdash;there is nothing to be afraid of. I
  have too much respect for my family to take the work off the devil's
  shoulders in that way. But I think I can get even with you in another
  form&mdash;not through your heart, but through your beloved money."</p>

  <p>"The man is mad!" Bramlay muttered.</p>

  <p>"No," Shannon went on, "the man was never more sane in his life. You see,
  I have found you out. As a matter of fact, I found you out years ago, only I
  was too blind to see it. It would have appeared incredible to me that you
  could quietly sit down and plan the ruin of a man who helped you to attain
  your present position, simply because he refused to sell you a house and home
  of which he was fond. You built up your wealth by audacious and daring
  speculations. If you had failed, you would have accounted it no dishonor, you
  would have had no sympathy for those whom you ruined&mdash;and indirectly you
  have ruined a good many. Now, I am not concerned with the others, but I
  certainly am with my own flesh and blood. Because I refused to part with my
  little home, you worked out a scheme to obtain possession of it. By
  deliberate lies you induced me to leave my old firm&mdash;you said that if I
  would come to you, I should have a share in the business in three years, and
  that you would make it right for the boys after I was gone. You did this in
  cold blood, so that you could get rid of me at this particular moment, merely
  because you want my little place to turn into a lodge. Ah, you can't
  understand how I built that miniature paradise of mine, inch by inch and step
  by step, and how it became part and parcel of my life. It was enough for you
  that you should get the mortgage into your own hands and force me into such a
  corner that I should be bound to sell to you. Without the least compunction
  or a wink less sleep of nights, you would turn me out at fifty-odd years of
  age to begin the world again. My boys would have to come down from the
  university, and the girl shift as best she can. Mind, I am not reproaching
  you, because you are the kind of man who is beyond the reach of words. But
  you are not going to have my place. Oh, you can smile. Tell me, if you like,
  that the mortgage deeds are at this very moment in your safe. Tell me that it
  is only the matter of a few weeks. Don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," Bramlay said with a sour smile.</p>

  <p>"For once in a way you are wrong. I have nearly done with it now. I am
  practically at the end of my tether. But after I am gone, my dear wife will
  still live happy in the possession of her home. The boys will finish their
  course at Harvard, and the girl will go to Germany. And, what is more to the
  point, every penny of this money will come out of your pocket. Oh, you may
  scheme and trick and lie and cheat, but I have an imagination which goes
  further than anything you can conceive. There are scores of men in the world
  who would make much more efficient scoundrels than you if they would only
  stoop to the muck-rake and the refuse-heap where you make your money. Is my
  meaning plain?"</p>

  <p>Bramlay shuffled about uneasily in his chair. He had never seen his late
  manager in this mood before. There was a calm assurance about him which
  rendered the financier uneasy.</p>

  <p>"What are you driving at?" he asked suilenly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you begin to be uneasy!" Shannon cried. "You will be uneasier still
  before morning. Now, you must know that I am perfectly aware of all that has
  happened in the matter of those copper mines. I know you see your way to come
  out with clean hands, so far as public knowledge is concerned, because you
  can buy silence and choke the throats of your foes with your cheque book. But
  you couldn't choke public inquiry, which will be bound to follow when the
  coroner comes to hold an inquest on my body."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely mad!" Bramlay muttered.</p>

  <p>"No; I am as sane as you are. I have worked the thing out coolly and
  deliberately, just as you plot out your own dirty schemes, and I can see my
  way to the finish. Not for my own sake, but for the sake of my wife and my
  family I am doing this. And even then I should hesitate only I know perfectly
  well that when the thing is done and ended, you will see that no dishonor
  attaches to my name. Oh, you won't do this out of friendship. You will do it
  for the sake of your own miserable hide. But let me get on, because I am
  wasting time. Now he has got my telegram, my friend Clausen will be here at
  any moment. We will assume, if you like, that I have lost my nerve over those
  copper mines. I am afraid of what might come out at the inquiry. That is why
  I have decided to take my own life. But before so doing I wrote a long
  explanatory letter to your private secretary Charlton, and another to my
  friend Clausen, who naturally enough will produce this letter at the inquest.
  Come, your imagination can grasp perfectly well what is likely to follow. The
  thing will be in the hands of the police. The public will demand a thorough
  investigation, and ten thousand cheque books could not save your reputation
  then. I have only to raise my hand and pull a trigger and release half an
  ounce of lead, and that tiny bit of metal will bring all your schemes and all
  your happiness tumbling about your ears. Ah! I touch you now."</p>

  <p>For Bramlay had risen suddenly to his feet. There was a peculiar pallor on
  his hard square face.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, don't talk like that!" he said hoarsely. "But, then,
  of course you are only joking."</p>

  <p>"Joking! I never was more serious in my life."</p>

  <p>"Well, we will talk it over to-morrow," Bramlay said with a forced laugh.
  "You will think better of it then. I dare say we can arrange this matter. Let
  it stand over for a week."</p>

  <p>"And give you time to make your plans accordingly? Oh, no. Do you suppose
  that I should ever trust you again! Besides, the mischief is done, the
  letters are already written. There is only one thing that would induce me to
  draw back now, and that is two hundred thousand dollars in cash counted out
  upon yonder table. I would not even take your cheque."</p>

  <p>"You are not likely to get it," Bramlay said tartly.</p>

  <p>"An answer worthy of the man," Shannon cried. "I might have known that you
  could not part with your money. But what I cannot effect this side of the
  grave I can reach for from the Other. And now ring your bell for my
  soda-water."</p>

  <p>Bramlay was nothing loath to comply with the request. His voice was hard
  and strained as he gave the order. The footman came presently with a syphon
  and glasses on a tray. As Shannon stood up, something glittered in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Your master is a thief and a scoundrel!" he cried. "Bear witness
  to-morrow that I said so. And now..."</p>

  <p>The glittering object was raised to his head. There was a flash and a dull
  report, and Shannon lay on his face on the carpet, shot through the brain.
  With a hoarse cry Bramlay rose to his feet and rushed out into the hall. He
  stood there shaking from head to foot in a perfect ague of terror.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>It was all over and done with. The little house at the corner of the road,
  behind drawn curtains, sheltered lamentation and woe and the tight stretching
  of human misery. There was uneasiness and anxiety, too, under the roof of the
  millionaire as he sat alone in his library an hour later. He had forced
  himself to stay in the library, though there was still that crimson stain
  upon the carpet. It seemed to him that he could still see the shadowy outline
  of Shannon's figure there. The whole scene rose before him. The prostrate
  body, the round-eyed, white-faced footman, and the outline of Clausen
  standing in the window with a telegram in his hand. Then there had been a
  confused blend of figures&mdash;policemen in uniform, a grim-faced inspector,
  and finally the disappeamce of Clausen in the direction of Shannon's house,
  with an intimation that he would be back presently to discuss certain
  important business with the financier. Was the man ever coming back? Bramlay
  wondered. And what did he really know? Had Shannon actually dispatched those
  letters, or did they exist only in his imagination? Finally Bramlay decided
  that the letters had been written. The whole thing had been too cool and
  deliberate to leave much doubt on that score. Inch by inch and link by link
  the plot had been elaborated until the last detail was complete. The letters
  had been sent to Clausen and Charlton. They would know all about it by this
  time. So far as Charlton was concerned, Bramlay knew exactly how to act. But,
  on the other hand, Clausen was a man of great intellect. He was Shannon's
  best friend, and he hated Bramlay from the bottom of his honest and
  independent heart. There would be no squaring him, as Bramlay very well knew.
  Here was a source of deep and abiding anxiety. But there was another thing
  that troubled the millionaire as well. Rack his brains as he would, he could
  not see to the end of Shannon's scheme; it was impossible to fathom his
  meaning when he declared that Bramlay should pay the price of his wife's
  future happiness and the prosperity of his family. What had the man
  meant?</p>

  <p>Bramlay paced up and down the room. The clock on the mantelpiece was
  nearing the hour of one, and as yet Clausen had not kept his promise. He came
  a few minutes later through the still open window. His face was grave and
  set. The look of dislike in his gray eyes broadened and expanded.</p>

  <p>"This is very good of you," Bramlay stammered. "I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not good of me at all," Clausen said sternly. "I am here for no
  benefit of yours. I suppose you know why my poor friend shot himself. Now,
  don't lie and palter and prevaricate with me, because I have the whole thing
  in this letter which I hold in my hand. It was written to me this afternoon,
  so that I should get it by the last post this evening. In the meantime
  Shannon had asked me to go to see him, and while we walked up and down the
  garden after dinner he disclosed his scheme for getting even with you. He was
  so cool and calm about it I thought he was joking&mdash;I know now that he
  spoke in that way so that I should have a clear and comprehensive idea of
  what was passing in his mind. He knew that a small matter of business would
  compel me to get back to meet the last post, and there I found his letter. A
  little later on I received a telegram saying that the thing would be done
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"But why?" Bramlay stammered.</p>

  <p>"Why!" Clausen cried impatiently. "You cold-blooded rascal, just as if you
  don't know! Didn't you, with your lies and deceit, lure poor Shannon away
  from his employment where he was doing so well, and take him into your
  business? Didn't you work this thing all out in your mind so that you could
  rob him of the house he loved so well? Of course you did. And there you stand
  opposite me pretending you know nothing as to the causes which led up to this
  distressing business. Upon my word, if I consulted my own inclination, I
  would take you by the collar and thrash the life out of you. You pass for a
  man of resolution and courage&mdash;if you could see that ghastly face of
  yours in a glass now, you might have reason to doubt even that virtue. But
  you are puzzled and frightened. You want to know what is going to happen in
  the future. Well, you can come to the inquest to-morrow morning and see for
  yourself. You will know then."</p>

  <p>"But those letters?" Bramlay stammered.</p>

  <p>"I will be quite frank with you, Clausen. Shannon told me he had given the
  whole thing away in a letter to you, and another one to Charlton. Of course,
  so far as Charlton is concerned&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you needn't say it," Clausen sneered.</p>

  <p>"I know perfectly well that you can stop Charlton's mouth. But you can't
  close my lips. You see, I have as much money as I happen to want, and if only
  I had known that this was going to happen, I would have lent poor Shannon all
  he needed to get out of your power. But, unfortunately, I didn't know that my
  friend was mad. He was so calm and collected that he would have deceived all
  the doctors in England. What he was discussing with me in grim earnest, I
  took to be no more than a cynical play of fancy. But Shannon had worked it
  all out to the last letter. I suppose he told you how he was going to punish
  you?"</p>

  <p>"There was a threat of making me pay," Bramlay murmured.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. And I am going to see it carried out. Some people might call
  it blackmail, but I don't think so. If I were to take you by the collar and
  thrash you now, you would forget all about it in a week. You would ask me to
  dine with you if you thought you could make two cents by doing so. Oh, I know
  you. Still, the sooner this matter is finished and done with, the better I
  shall be pleased. Shannon told you that he would make you pay, and that,
  moreover, he should go to his grave without any shadow of disgrace upon his
  memory. What you don't know, and what is puzzling and frightening you now, is
  how the thing is to be accomplished. How can Shannon reach you from the other
  side of the grave? How can he compel you to make his wife's old age
  comfortable and assured, so that she can live in her present house and
  educate her children?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Bramlay said feebly.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I'll tell you. Now, I know perfectly well that you have
  already made arrangements in your mind as to the way in which you are going
  to suppress the letter which Shannon wrote to your secretary. But it is no
  use doing that unless you would suppress my letter also. Mind you, I don't
  see how anything is to be gained by public investigation of that kind, so my
  conscience is easy on that score. There will be something for the creditors
  now, but if they go to law over it, nothing will be left. And now let us get
  to business. I am in possession of a certain letter which you badly need. As
  a matter of fact, the letter was sent to me so that I might sell it to you
  for a price, and if you refuse to buy, I am to produce it at the inquest. As
  I said before, nothing could be gained by this course. It is a <i>suppressio
  viri</i> at the worst. Besides, if we maintain a judicious silence on this
  point, the world will believe that poor Shannon went out of his mind in
  consequence of overwork or something of that kind, and thus he will get
  sympathy instead of contempt. Now, is it worth your while to buy that letter,
  to have the inquest settled in an hour, or are you prepared to face the thing
  out to the finish and court an investigation? I'll give you five minutes to
  decide. So far as I am concerned, it is a matter of indifference to me which
  determination you come to."</p>

  <p>Bramlay paced up and down the room, a prey to his own disturbed thoughts.
  He was in a cleft stick, now, and he knew it. Shannon's had been no idle
  boast. He had stretched out a hand from beyond the grave, a hand so powerful
  that Bramlay could see no means of getting away from the grip of it.</p>

  <p>"What do you want for the letter?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Two hundred thousand dollars," Clausen said dryly.</p>

  <p><a id="pic12"
     name="pic12"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300971h-images/TheSwordOfJustice2.jpg"
         title="'Two hundred thousand dollars.'">
  </div><br>

  <p>"The very figure Shannon named!" Bramlay cried.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. Now I think you understand exactly. You are going to give me
  your cheque for two hundred thousand dollars, and in return I will make you a
  present of the letter. I don't know what a good many people would say as to
  the morality of this transaction, but so far as I am concerned I don't feel
  that I am doing anything particularly wrong. And now, let there be no more
  beating about the bush. You may frown and shake your head, but from the very
  first moment you made up your mind to pay, and upon my word, I wonder at my
  own moderation. If I had demanded ten times the sum, you must have paid it. I
  have only one real regret over the matter, and that is my inability to let
  poor Shannon know how perfectly successful his plot has been. There are few
  men who have gone as far as he has for the sake of those dependent upon
  him."</p>

  <p>But Bramlay was not listening. He took his cheque book from a drawer and
  placed on one of the pink slips a signature a great deal less steady than it
  usually was. He passed this across the table to Clausen and held out an eager
  hand for the letter. This he carefully burned with a match, and crushed the
  fragments into an ash-tray.</p>

  <p>Clausen nodded in reply. Then he went out into the darkness and closed the
  French window carefully behind him.</p>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10">10.&mdash;THE FIRST STONE</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR GARRATT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Oct 1908</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE woman sat there, flirting her fan to and fro listlessly,
  her dark eyes bent upon the stage as if she were absolutely lost in the
  brilliant new comedy which was being presented for the first time by the
  great actor-manager of the Comus Theatre. She lay back in her stall, haughty
  and listless and indifferent, as if compelled to admiration in spite of
  herself. She looked every inch the <i>grande dame</i> going through a round
  of pleasure and accepting it all entirely as a matter of course. She was
  beautifully, naturally dressed; diamonds shimmered in her dark hair; there
  was around her that nameless atmosphere which seems to always go with wealth
  and breeding. She might not have had a single care in the world; she might
  have been one of those spoilt darlings of society for whom, presumedly,
  Providence has intended the universe, to the exclusion of all others. Despite
  her coldness and her beauty and her air of absolute aloofness, there was now
  and then a flicker of the delicate nostril and a tightening of the haughty
  mouth which told of pain, either physical or mental. She laid her fan down
  upon the vacant stall on her left and clasped her long-gloved hands
  together.</p>

  <p>There were several people in the theatre who had regarded more or less
  curiously this dark, stately beauty sitting there all alone. It was possible
  to speculate as to the meaning of the empty stall by her side. There was
  admiration as well as envy and sundry glances cast in her direction, and yet
  at that moment Stella Clinash would have been perfectly willing to have
  changed places with the humblest little domestic servant perched up far above
  in the roaring red atmosphere of the gallery.</p>

  <p>She was glad now that her husband had not come. She was fiercely glad that
  Clive Clinash had stayed away. He had meant to come with her, of course, for
  the Clinashes were alone in London. They were only over from Buenos Ayres for
  a short stay. They had intended to get back to South America in the course of
  a day or two. Almost at the last moment there had come a telegram from
  Clinash to the Dominion Hotel, where they were staying, saying that he had
  been detained on important business and would probably join his wife in the
  theatre a little later on.</p>

  <p>She had been rather glad to get this message. Sooth to say, she was a
  little tired of sight-seeing; she would have preferred an evening at home in
  her own sitting-room. But, then, there was the chance that Clinash would go
  straight to the theatre, and he would be greatly disappointed to find his a
  wife absent. Therefore she had gone alone, with that strange feeling upon her
  that something was going to happen. It seemed to her that she had never hated
  London so much as she did at that moment; it seemed to her that it would have
  been far wiser to remain at Buenos Ayres, but Clinash would not hear of it.
  Besides, they had only been married a few months, and Stella Clinash had
  always been a solitary woman, and when she had come to find a home and
  husband she clung to both with a tenacity and passion which, at times, fairly
  frightened her. Like most people who pass for being cold and self-contained,
  she had depths of feeling and emotion of which Clinash, with all his love and
  admiration for her, knew nothing.</p>

  <p>And he had taken her on trust, too. He had found her eighteen months
  before, getting a precarious living in London as an addresser of envelopes.
  He had fallen in love with her on the spot, and had, in his impetuous way,
  asked her to marry him. Just for the moment she had hesitated. There were
  reasons why she should have refused. And yet, when she came to think of the
  drab monotony of the life that lay before her, she hesitated no longer. She
  wanted someone to lavish her affection upon, and here she found him. For
  Clinash was rich and prosperous, he was young and fairly goodlooking,
  and&mdash;well, there was only one end to a struggle like that.</p>

  <p>And now all the misery and unhappiness had gradually faded like an ugly
  landscape blurred in a cloud of mist. The ice had gradually melted from round
  Stella's heart until she could stand there in the sunshine of her own
  happiness and wonder what she had done that God should be so good to her as
  all this.</p>

  <p>That was up to a few moments ago. And then she had seen him standing there
  by the entrance to the stalls, glancing casually round the theatre as if he
  were in some way connected with the management. He stood there neatly dressed
  in a dark frock suit, a glossy hat was perched upon his head, and his round,
  hard face and keen grey eyes seemed to be taking in the whole audience.
  Stella Clinash recognised him at once. She would have recognised him anywhere
  and in any circumstances. There were no delusions in her mind on the score of
  his failing to remember her. She felt his eyes running the measure of the
  rule over her, she saw him turn and say something to a theatre attendant,
  then presently he vanished and another man suspiciously like him took his
  place. There was no facial resemblance between the two, but they were both
  cast in entirely the same mould, both of them trim and clean and reserved,
  both of them speaklng of the Criminal Investigation Department of Scotland
  Yard to anybody who had ever had any contact with that dread institution. And
  although the second man never for one moment looked in Stella Clinash's
  direction she knew perfectly well that he was waiting for her, and that she
  would have to speak to him before the performance was over.</p>

  <p>Well, the thing was finished now. She had had more than a year on the
  other side of the golden gates, and now the barriers of desolation yawned
  before her. And the strange thing was that she was not frightened, she did
  not seem to be in the least alarmed, or angry, or unhappy. She had been the
  sport of Fate too long to accept a blow like this with anything but
  resignation.</p>

  <p>Clive would have to know. Indeed, she blamed herself now for not telling
  him before. But she had been afraid to do so; she had been afraid to risk the
  happiness which had suddenly opened before her in such dazzling splendour.
  She had temporized, and the time was lost, and now it was too late. Still,
  she must let her husband know, she must prepare him for the inevitable. It
  would never do for her to bring disgrace upon his honoured name. He must
  abandon her to her fate, he must never see her again; no one must know that
  guilty secret but themselves. And perhaps, when she had served her sentence
  out, he might be disposed to remember that for over a year she had been a
  good and faithful wife to him. He might be willing to make some provision to
  save her from want in the future. Fortunately, they knew nobody in London; it
  would not be an easy matter to trace her back to the Dominion Hotel, and
  Clive would be clever enough to hide all her tracks. Of course, he would be
  sorry, for she knew how genuinely fond he was of her; but at the same time
  his good name must not suffer, and in that respect she would help him to the
  best of her ability. Why, oh, why had she returned to England at all?
  Clinash's own call had been imperative&mdash;a business crisis that demanded
  his presence in England. Most men have these moments of commercial peril. And
  she had risked it all to be with him&mdash;not to lose a moment of her
  glorious happiness, as a love-sick girl might have done. Oh, the incredible
  folly of it!</p>

  <p>She had thought it out now. She waited till the curtain fell on the third
  act, then she beckoned a programme-seller in her direction. From her purse
  she took out a half-sovereign and placed it in the girl's hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask any questions," she murmured. "Procure me at once a sheet of
  paper, an envelope, and a pencil. I am going to write a note which I want
  delivered at the Dominion Hotel at once. If you can manage this for me the
  halfsovereign is yours. All I ask you to do is to be silent and say nothing
  of this."</p>

  <p>The girl nodded. Perhaps the request did not strike her as being
  particularly strange. She came back presently with writing materials, and
  Stella Clinash wrote her letter. It was characteristic of her that her
  handwriting was firm and neat, that the letter was perfectly coherent and
  collected.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"There," she whispered; "will you take that now?"</p>

  <p>"At once, madam," the girl replied. "You can rely upon me. Besides, I am
  going that way."</p>

  <p>The comedy was drawing to a close now. Stella Clinash looked at the watch
  on her wrist, and saw that it was half-past eleven. No doubt Clive had
  received her letter an hour before. He would have made up his mind by this
  time exactly what to do.</p>

  <p>Already some of the audience had begun to leave the theatre. She rose
  calmly and drew a wrap round her shoulders and over her head. Then she walked
  quite steadily and collectedly through the vestibule up to the folding doors,
  where the man with the hard, keen face appeared to be awaiting someone.
  Stella drew a little quick breath, and her lips quivered as she touched the
  man on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I think you are waiting for me," she said, quietly. "I don't happen to
  know your name, but you recognise me."</p>

  <p>The man turned and smiled good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>"Detective-Sergeant Swift," he said, tentatively. "You are Stella
  Treherne. Rapson asked me to wait here. He recognised you, though, as a
  matter of fact, he was looking for somebody else. Hard luck, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>The man spoke in a friendly enough tone. There was nothing of the
  traditional man-hunter about him. He was merely a machine cut and drilled and
  polished to a diamond hardness. Possibly in private life he was as generous
  and good-natured as other people. But he had his duty to perform, and he
  meant to do it.</p>

  <p>"I don't want any sympathy," Stella said, coldly. "I am quite prepared to
  take the consequences. And yet, if a thousand pounds would be the slightest
  good to you, I am prepared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Swift turned aside apparently unheeding.</p>

  <p>"Don't say that," he whispered. "Because you see, it would make no
  difference. And if I mentioned it to the magistrate tomorrow morning&mdash;
  But perhaps I didn't exactly catch what you said. Would you like a cab?"</p>

  <p>"That is kind of you," Stella said, in the same strangely even voice, "I
  suppose I ought not to blame you so much as the iniquitous system of which
  you are at once the slave and tool. Of course, I must have a cab. I could
  hardly walk through the streets to the police station dressed like this."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Swift agreed. "But wouldn't you like to go anywhere
  first? Would it not be as well to get as far as your hotel or your rooms,
  where you can procure a change of clothing? Of course, it is no business of
  mine to pry into your present position, but, judging from what one can see,
  matters appear to have gone very well with you of late. I presume you are
  married?"</p>

  <p>The blood Hamed into Stella's face.</p>

  <p>"Is that necessary?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course not," Swift said, with some sign of confusion. "But we
  flatter ourselves we can always tell the difference between the woman
  who&mdash;well, you know what I mean."</p>

  <p>"I am obliged for your good opinion," Stella said, calmly. "Married or
  not, at the present moment I am a woman who has to face a trouble entirely
  alone. And I have done no wrong; or, at least, if I have, I have paid for it
  dearly enough, God knows. Why do you hunt us like this? Why don't you give us
  a chance to lead a clean and honest life? Why should we be dragged month by
  month to report ourselves at the nearest police-station? You know it always
  results in the same exposure. Our employers get to hear of it, and the same
  weary struggle begins over again. I am sure that two-thirds of the criminals
  on ticket-of-leave find their way back to jail again simply because of this
  cruel system of yours. It would be far kinder to keep us under lock and key
  till the sentence is worked out. As a sensible man, you must know I am
  speaking the truth."</p>

  <p>Swift shrugged his shoulders. It was not for him to question the
  iconoclast* methods of his department. He was a mere pawn in the game of
  diabolical chess which the police are unceasingly playing with the criminal
  classes. And, besides, he had expected some sort of passionate outburst like
  this. They mostly behaved in the same fashion. The people were beginning to
  pour out of the theatre now. Stella standing there, tall and slim in her
  white dress, was attracting attention. A cab came up, and Swift stood aside
  for Stella to enter.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *"iconoclast" (<i>sic</i>) - perhaps a typographical
  error for "iron-clad." ]</p>

  <p>They drove along silently through the well-lighted streets. They passed
  the portico of the Dominion Hotel, where the porter was standing with his
  hands behind him. As the great front of the building stood out red and bold
  Stella caught her lip between her teeth and blinked the tears from her eyes.
  But she was not going to give way, she was not going to pity herself. She had
  played her game and she had lost it, and she was prepared to pay the price.
  Still, she turned cold and faint and dizzy as the cab pulled up presently
  outside a police&mdash;station. There was something horribly familiar about
  the place, something so repulsive about the whitewashed walls and the bare,
  clanging passages. A couple of policemen sitting there in the charge-room,
  stolidly eating their suppers, looked up with a certain languid curiosity as
  Swift and his prisoner entered. But they were too used to these fiery,
  dramatic entrances and exits to do more than take in the details of the
  woman's dress and the cold, proud frostiness of her face. An inspector
  sitting behind the table glanced interrogatively at Swift.</p>

  <p>"Stella Treherne," he said. "Charged with failing to report herself.
  Released on licence about twenty months ago and only been heard of once
  since."</p>

  <p>The inspector bent over the table and scribbled something on a sheet of
  paper. From his point of view it was all a matter of business. Had Stella
  appeared there either in rags or in silken attire he would have displayed the
  same lack of interest or emotion.</p>

  <p>"Want to send for your friends?" he asked. "You can't appear like that
  to-morrow morning, you know. What is your address?"</p>

  <p>"My address is refused," Stella said, quietly. "You know my name, and that
  is sufficient. As to the rest, I must make the best of it. There are reasons
  why I cannot give you my address&mdash;imperative reasons why my present
  friends must not know what has happened to me. I have money in my purse. I
  suppose I can keep that, and perhaps one of the female warders will get me
  something from one of the adjacent shops in the morning. As there is no
  charge against me, except for failing to report myself, I must ask you to let
  me retain possession of my money."</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300971h-images/TheFirstStone2.jpg"
         title="'My address is refused,' Stella said">
  </div><br>

  <p>The inspector scraped his jaw thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Seems reasonable" he said. "Very well; we will do what you require. Is
  there anything you would like before morning? Perhaps you would like to send
  out for some food?"</p>

  <p>Stella fairly shuddered at the suggestion. The mere notion of food filled
  her with loathing and disgust. There was absolutely nothing she wanted, she
  said. Her one desire was to be alone. In a dreamy kind of way she followed a
  policeman presently along an echoing flagged passage. She heard the quick
  turn of keys in well-oiled locks, she was once more back in those horribly
  suggestive environments where life has lost its savour and where the word
  "hope" becomes no more than a mocking, empty sound. All that banging of doors
  and clicking of keys seemed to be superfluous; such a waste of strength and
  tyrannical grip to hold one so small and crushed and miserable in durance
  vile. She had no inclination to shirk the inevitable. Had all the doors been
  thrown wide before her she would have made no attempt to escape now. For what
  good would such a thing have been? By this time her husband knew everything
  and he would act accordingly. Already she was beginning to think of him less
  now as her husband than as Clive Clinash. She would never see him again. It
  did not seem to her that she wanted to. At all hazards now, she was going
  through with it to the bitter end. She would be sent to one of those dreadful
  convict prisons, there to serve out the rest of her sentence. But, at any
  rate, after that she would be free; her term of imprisonment embraced no
  subsequent police supervision. Once it was over and done with she could go
  where she liked and do as she pleased.</p>

  <p>She sat down there with ber head in her hands on that cold, hard travesty
  of a bed, the like of which she knew only too well. From time to time she
  could hear the heavy tramp of feet along the corridor; from time to time some
  drunken woman prisoner burst into horrible screams. Now and again from a cell
  close by a man was singing a snatch of comic opera in a pleasant tenor voice.
  Then gradually the sounds died away, and in an uneasy manner Stella
  slept.</p>

  <p>She woke presently chill and cold in the grey dawn, and the whole thing
  came back to her with overwhelming force. She was hungry now, and yet the
  mere thought of food was repulsive to her. Gradually the atmosphere grew
  warmer. She could hear sounds of life and movement about the place. A little
  later the door of her cell opened and a hard-featured woman looked in. She
  threw a bundle on the floor, with an intimation that everything necessary was
  there, and withdrew.  Here was a chance to do something, however trivial, to
  pass away the time. Stella's rings and jewellery had been taken possession of
  the night before, but her dainty dress looked hideously grotesque in the pale
  light of the morning. She stripped it off and cast it aside as if it had been
  some loathsome thing. She was almost thankful to find herself in coarse,
  ill-fitting black garments, with a plain straw hat. At any rate, there was no
  chance of any acquaintance recognising her now. There would be no opportunity
  for the sensational joumalist to make half a column of copy out of her
  story.</p>

  <p>The time had come now. She was walking across the courtyard. She stood
  presently in a dreamy kind of way with her hand clasping the dock; she heard
  her name mentioned, then the magistrate appeared to be asking her a
  question.</p>

  <p>He was a kindly-looking man, and Stella took fresh heart of grace.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "I am waiting for you to speak."</p>

  <p>Stella looked up dreamily. The question seemed to be floating around the
  roof of the court before it reached her ears. She had been watching a bee
  climbing up one of the windows, fighting angrily for liberty; she was
  intensely interested in the efforts of the little insect. Would it manage to
  reach the ventilator or not? she wondered. She was more concerned with this
  now than with her own future. She was quite anxious about it. She gave a
  little sigh of relief, at length, when the bee reached the opening and sped
  away into the open air. Then it was that Stella came back to herself, and the
  knowledge that the grey-haired old gentleman opposite to her was asking her
  questions, and looking at her not unkindly from behind his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she murmured. "I beg your pardon; I was not
  listening."</p>

  <p>"What have you, then, to say?" the magistrate asked.</p>

  <p>Stella shook her head wearily. What was the use of saying anything? She
  knew perfectly well that any plea for mercy on her part would pass unheeded.
  After all said and done, the police were doing no more than their duty. It
  was all part of the diabolical system, part of the constant warfare which
  went on between the law and the criminal. She would have to go back and
  finish her sentence. She had been warned on the first day of her liberty that
  there would be no trifling in this matter. She had lost everything now,
  position, reputation, husband, all at one feel swoop. There was nothing more
  to be said or done.</p>

  <p>The magistrate still paused. So far as Stella was concerned, she had lost
  all interest in the proceedings. Somebody had jumped up in the well of the
  court below the dock and commenced to address the magistrate. He spoke
  clearly and well; evidently he was quite at home with this kind of work. In
  the same dreamy, half&mdash;blind fashion Stella could see that his shrewd,
  clean-shaven face was kindly enough. She gathered that he was saying
  something on her behalf. She heard this advocate of hers addressed presently
  as Mr. Hallam. She wondered in the same dull, groping way where she had heard
  the name before. Then it flashed upon her that this was a famous barrister
  whom she had read of over and over again. She knew that he was a man at the
  head of his profession; she realized that he would not have left other and
  more important work had not his fee been a handsome one. There could be no
  question as to who had procured the services of Mr. Hallam, K.C. Her husband
  must have sent him, and in a way Stella felt grateful.</p>

  <p>She glanced wearily round the court to see if she could see Clive
  anywhere, but he had not put in an appearance. He would never forgive her, of
  course, he would never want to see her again; but that would not necessarily
  prevent him from acting a noble, manly part, and doing everything he could to
  lighten her sentence. She was more interested now; she began to follow
  eagerly and carefully what Hallam was saying.</p>

  <p>"With all due respect, sir," the advocate said, in his smooth tones, "with
  all due respect, I urge this as an exceptional case. As to the facts stated
  by the policel have nothing to say. My unfortunate client was certainly
  convicted at the Old Bailey four years ago on a charge of fraud and
  conspiracy under her maiden name of Treherne. As a matter of fact, there
  would have been no sentence of penal servitude if the prisoner had not been
  identified by the police with a certain notorious woman criminal whose name
  it is not necessary to mention. That was quite a mistake, and would have been
  shown at the trial had my client been properly represented. I appeal to
  Sergeant Swift, who has charge of this case, to confirm this statement. It
  was only after my client disappeared that these facts came to light."</p>

  <p>"That is so, your worship," Swift admitted.</p>

  <p>"An unfortunate mistake was made. We did our best to find the prisoner
  after she vanished, but without effect. But that does not touch the present
  charge&mdash;the charge that the prisoner failed to report herself and
  rendered herself liable to arrest and to be conveyed back to prison, there to
  serve out the balance of her sentence."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am not contesting the point," Hallam cried. "I am entirely in the
  hands of the Court, but I have proved that a cruel mistake has been made, and
  that my client ought never to have been sentenced to penal servitude at all.
  It is not for me to question the system which compels criminals on licence to
  report themselves to the nearest police-station, but I do say that in certain
  cases it is harsh and unnecessarily brutal. Take my client's position as an
  instance. For a year after she came out of jail she had an exceedingly bitter
  struggle to live, but there was nothing against her, and when the opportunity
  came for turning her back upon England, when she had a chance of a happy
  marriage and a new life in a foreign country, the temptation was too much for
  her. My client is well-born, she was carefully brought up, and yet she knew
  what it was more than once to spend the night out of doors. Think of the
  temptation, think of the opportunities! How many women would have hesitated?
  I venture to say, not many. She never told her husband. It is only within the
  last few hours that he has made this terrible discovery. And he is is man in
  an exceedingly good position in South America; he is rich and respected. He
  would have been here to-day, but he is utterly overcome by this unexpected
  revelation, and unfortunately he cannot get here. If your worship likes, I
  will hand the name up to the Bench. You will quite see there is nothing to be
  gained by making my client's husband's name public."</p>

  <p>"Is this a fact, Mr. Hallam?" the magistrate asked.</p>

  <p>"I give you my word for it, sir," the barrister responded. "My statement
  will probably be confirmed by the circumstances in which my client was
  arrested last night. Now I am going to ask you, sir, to exercise your
  discretion in this case and allow this lady to be released on her own
  recognisances. When you have read the name which I propose to write down for
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," Stella Clinash cried, suddenly, "I implore you not to do anything of
  the kind. I would rather suffer any humiliation than allow my husband's name
  to be dragged into this business. I am quite prepared to face the
  consequences of my folly. I shall never see my husband again. He will never
  want to see me. I greatly regret that he should have sent this gentleman here
  to-day. Oh, can't you see that I wish to get this over as soon as possible?
  Can't you see what an unspeakable humiliation this is to me? Send me back
  where I came from. At least I shall be beyond the reach of starvation there.
  I was not so guilty as they said; I was the tool of others, though I do not
  want to shirk my responsibility. I deceived my husband, and that is the
  knowledge that hurts me most."</p>

  <p>The passionate words rang through the court; the few reporters and the
  handful of the public present followed with breathless interest. Here was an
  unexpected human drama unfolding itself before them&mdash;a story more
  profoundly tragic than anything ever yet seen upon the stage. Stella ceased
  to speak; a silence fell upon the Court. It seemed to her that she had the
  sympathy of everyone present.</p>

  <p>"This is unusual," the magistrate murmured. "I am sure this unfortunate
  lady will think better of what she says when she has time for consideration.
  I cannot blind myself to the fact that had the true facts of the case come
  out during the trial she would not be here at all. Also, I have not
  overlooked the inspector's statement that there is nothing against the
  prisoner since she came out of jail. After all said and done, it is merely a
  technical offence which has been committed, and I think the interests of
  justice will be served by a nominal sentence of a day's imprisonment&mdash;in
  other words, the prisoner is free to leave the dock now."</p>

  <p>Stella seemed barely to comprehend. There was something like a murmur of
  applause from those present in the court. A warder touched her on the arm and
  intimated that she might go. She did not seem quite to understand what the
  sentence meant. She stood there dazed and confused in the body of the court,
  trying to collect her scattered senses. Her advocate was still addressing the
  Bench. He wanted to know if this persecution was to continue. He desired to
  know whether application would be made to the Home Secretary to remit the
  inconvenience of these periodical calls upon the police. The magistrate shook
  his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"That will be in your own hands, Mr. Hallam," he said. "I presume the
  police would raise no objection. They have no desire, of course, to turn this
  into a persecution."</p>

  <p>"I am obliged to you, sir," the barrister said. "I may assume, therefore,
  that so long as my client is outside the jurisdiction of the Court no steps
  will be taken."</p>

  <p>The magistrate shook his head with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Ah, now you are assuming too much," he said. "I think you have no cause
  to be dissatisfied. Next case, please."</p>

  <p>Stella wandered slowly out of court. She stood in the open air, undecided
  as to what to do or where to go next. She seemed to understand that Hallam
  wished to speak to her. He was asking her to wait for one moment, and then he
  had certain things to say.</p>

  <p>Stella murmured something; she hardly knew what it was. She was free to go
  now. She had all the world before her. There were just a few shillings in her
  pocket. All she wanted now was to be alone, to get away from all who knew
  her, to start life afresh. She turned and' walked rapidly down the street
  until she came into the thick of the traffic; then she drifted on the breast
  of the tide&mdash;a human derelict, alone and friendless.</p>

  <p>"I shall manage," she murmured to herself. "It can be no worse than it was
  before."</p>

  <p>It was a warm night, fortunately, so that it would be no great hardship to
  sleep out of doors, and anything was better than the foul, horrible den in
  which Stella Clinash had passed the last two nights. Her money was all gone
  now, with the exception of one solitary sixpence, to which she clung
  tenaciously. She was tired and worn out. Her one desire was to fall down
  somewhere and sleep. She walked along the Embankment, looking in vain for a
  quiet corner where the lynx eye of the law might possibly overlook her.</p>

  <p>The clock at Westminster was striking ten, the Embankment was more or less
  deserted, save for a hansom cab or two taking more fortunate people to some
  place of amusement. Here was a seat at length where Stella could sit down and
  rest her weary limbs. She lay back there drowsy and half unconscious. She
  wondered vaguely what this man was doing, this man who was moving from seat
  to seat closely scrutinizing the miserable outcasts who were resting there.
  She could see that he was well dressed, that he was wearing a light coat over
  his evening clothes. Then something rose in her throat and her heart gave a
  great leap as she recognised her husband. She bent down so that he might
  pass. Surely he would never recognise her in the ugly black garments which
  she wore. But all the same he paused before her, and then, as if sure that he
  had come to the end of his search, he laid his hand upon her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" he murmured. "Thank God I have found you! I have been
  searching high and low for the last three days. It is only by a mere accident
  that I have come across you now. Come along."</p>

  <p><a id="pic15"
     name="pic15"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300971h-images/TheFirstStone3.jpg"
         title="Thank God I have found you!">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Come," Stella asked, vaguely, "where?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not here; this is no place for explanations. Good heavens, do you
  suppose I am so black and hard as to desert you like this? When you know
  everything you will see I am more to blame than yourself. But come along,
  everything is ready. I have moved to another hotel. Nobody knows that you are
  the wife of Clive Clinash. Directly I got your note I sent your maid away on
  a pretext. A telephone message will fetch her at any moment. I have moved
  everything to the Blenheim Hotel. They think I am expecting my wife every
  hour. Come, you can change and dress, and we can have supper. Oh, my poor
  child, how white your face is! What awful rings you have under your eyes!
  Why, you are starving."</p>

  <p>All this in a voice of infinite tenderness and feeling. Stella had risen
  to her feet. She could see nothing of her husband's face because her eyes
  were blind with tears. She wanted to run away; she wanted to leave him there
  and hide herself once more under the cover of the darkness. But she was too
  weak and spent for that&mdash;too tired and worn-out to make even the
  semblance of a struggle.</p>

  <p>When she came to herself again her head was on her husband's shoulder; she
  could feel his strong arm about her. She was being half led, half carried.
  She was in a hansom presently; she could hear the click-clack of the horse's
  hoofs on the asphalt. Then she was passing through the brilliantly-lighted
  vestibule of an hotel. She was in a luxuriant bedroom with all her own things
  about her. Here were her jewels and her silver toilet accessories. Here was
  the warm bath that she needed. Then presently, in the same aesthetic dream,
  she found herself looking at her own slim, graceful prcsentment in a looking
  glass.</p>

  <p>The diamonds were in her hair again, a bunch of yellow roses nestled at
  her throat. There was a smile on her trembling lips now, the dark eyes were
  liquid with happiness despite the black rings below them. And yet Stella was
  full of contempt for her own weakness, half ashamed of a resolution she had
  made because she knew that it would never be carried into effect. It was
  good, oh, so good of Clive to treat her like this, to say nothing of the
  past, never to allude even by so much as a look to the disgrace which she had
  brought upon his good name. And here he was again with his arm about her
  waist gazing fondly into her face. He was seated opposite to her now at the
  supper-table, and Stella was eating as, it seemed to her, she had never eaten
  before. The events of the last three days seemed to be disappearing like the
  mists of some hideous nightmare, they seemed to be drifting into space.</p>

  <p>The table was cleared presently and they were alone in that
  luxuriously-appointed sitting-room, where the lights were discreetly shaded
  and the soft gloom invited confidence and the opening out of hearts.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to scold me?" Stella whispered. "Do you know what I
  meant to do? I meant to go away and never see you again. I meant to disappear
  and fight my own battles in the future, because I have treated you
  abominably, Clive, and I am not worthy to be called your wife; but the
  temptation was so great, the life I had led so awful, and&mdash;well, I
  really and truly loved you, and I can think of no better excuse than that.
  You may think that I was cold and reserved, but behind it all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused, and for a moment it seemed as if she had no more to say. What
  more was there to say?</p>

  <p>"I know, sweetheart," Clinash murmured, "I know. I heard all that happened
  in court the other day, and I believe I read your mind then as if it had been
  an open book. And because you are so weak I love you so well. It is good to
  know that you were so ready to come back to me. Perhaps the knowledge of it
  flatters my vanity. But that matters little or nothing, because from the very
  first you never deceived me at all. When I married you in London eighteen
  months ago I knew the history of your troubles as well as I know it now. I
  was aware even then of the cruel injustice of your sentence. But I did not
  tell you I knew, because&mdash;well, why should I torture you? Perhaps I
  thought that if I let you know you would have refused to become my wife. But
  if I had foreseen this I would have sacrificed everything rather than imperil
  your future. I know that that was a mistake now. But you longed to come, and
  I&mdash;well, every man in love is a fool sometimes."</p>

  <p>Stella looked into her husband's face wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"You knew?" she murmured; "You actually knew? Oh! you are not deceiving
  me, Clive? You are not trying to make the way smooth and pleasant for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"My dearest, I am telling you no more than the truth. The first time I
  ever saw you was in court on the day of your trial. I think I fell in love
  with you then. It might have been love born of pity, but it is none the less
  true and sincere for that. And I felt then, as I feel now, that you are the
  victim of circumstances, and that the man who was really behind that
  conspiracy took advantage of your lack of knowledge to get you to alter the
  date on those telegrams for him. Of course, you were not blameless, but you
  were more of a child in the matter. And in the interest I had in watching
  your case I forgot for a moment my own troubles."</p>

  <p>"Your troubles," Stella murmured; "what were they?"</p>

  <p>"Well, simply that I was practically a prisoner, too. I was out on bail; I
  was waiting to be tried. My case came actually next to yours. Oh, it was a
  bad business, and I am making no attempt to palliate it, but it was the only
  slip I ever made in my life, and I registered a vow there and then that when
  I came out of jail I would seek you out and make you my wife. It seemed to me
  that we had much in common, that we should have nothing to reproach one
  another with. And when I did come out the struggle was too hard for me to
  think of anything but bare existence. Like you I felt the iniquity of that
  reporting system, and like you I deliberately broke it. I had marvellous luck
  abroad, and in a few months I came back a rich man. The rest you know. And
  you know now why I dared not appear in court the other morning, why I had to
  keep out of the way for fear that I should be recognised too, and for fear
  that our happiness would collapse altogether. For your sake I had to take
  risks. But it turned out for the best. Luck was on our side for once. And,
  you see, I must get back to Buenos Ayres without delay. My whole prosperity
  turns upon it. And now I must ask you to forgive me."</p>

  <p>"Is there any question of forgiveness between us?" Stella said. The tears
  were running down her cheeks now. "Do you know, I am almost glad. It seems a
  strange thing to say; but I am. And now, when do we sail? I shall know no
  happiness while I remain in this country."</p>

  <p>Clive stooped and kissed his wife.</p>

  <p>"To&mdash;morrow," he whispered. "I have arranged that. And all our future
  is bound up in that word&mdash;to-morrow."</p><br>
